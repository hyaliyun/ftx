It was established in 2003 after the merger of Northern Territory University, the Menzies School of Health Research, and Centralian College. CDU is a member of the group of seven Innovative Research Universities in Australia, and offers academic degrees and vocational education. History Charles Darwin University has evolved over the years through the merging of several higher education institutions. =Darwin Community College= Darwin Community College, founded in 1974 and renamed Darwin Institute of Technology in 1984, was a combined College of Advanced Education and a TAFE College. It was situated on what is now the Casuarina Campus, although it used other buildings at various times in Darwin. By the time of the formation of the Northern Territory University, it gave degrees in arts, education, business and applied science. =Menzies School of Health Research= The Menzies School of Health Research was established in 1985 as a body corporate of the Northern Territory Government under the Menzies Act 1985. This act was amended in 2004 to formalise the relationship with Charles Darwin University. Menzies is now a major partner of CDU and constitutes a school within the university on campus at CDU Casuarina offering post-graduate degrees and higher degrees by research. =University College of the Northern Territory= On several occasions the Government of the Northern Territory requested the Australian Commonwealth Government to finance a university in the territory. The response was always that the population was too small. In 1985, it took the unusual step of financing the University College of the Northern Territory itself for a five-year period from 1987 to 1991. The college was governed by a council, chaired by Austin Asche and led by a warden, Professor Jim Thomson, from the University of Queensland. An arrangement was made with the University of Queensland that the college would award degrees from that institution. Staff were recruited in 1986 and housed in the old Darwin Primary School buildings. Just prior to taking the first students in February 1987, the college moved to converted building of the former Darwin Hospital at Myilly Point in Darwin. The former nurses' hostel became a student residence, named International House. The college had two faculties, of arts and science. It awarded, through the University of Queensland link, the first Doctor of Philosophy degrees in the Northern Territory. =Centralian College= Centralian College was founded in 1993 from the merger of Sadadeen Senior Secondary College and the Alice Springs College of TAFE. During its life, the college delivered senior secondary, TAFE and higher education through its main campus in Alice Springs, and to a lesser extent the whole Northern Territory. Centralian College is a co-educational senior secondary school, for students from Year 10 to Year 12. Centralian College shares its campus with the Charles Darwin University campus of Alice Springs. Centralian College uses the university's facilities and students attending Centralian College can participate in VET courses (as early as Year 10) offered by CDU. =Northern Territory University= The Northern Territory University was founded in January 1989 by a merger of the Darwin Institute of Technology and the University College of the Northern Territory. The merger was controversial, but forced by the so-called Dawkins Revolution under federal Minister of Education John Dawkins. The new university started life on 1 January 1989. Degrees of the University of Queensland continued to be awarded for a few years. The first vice-chancellor was Professor Malcolm Nairn from Murdoch University in Western Australia. Under his leadership the university prospered and morale was high among both staff and students. However funding declined as student numbers rose. During his term of office the various study centres on the territory, that previously had been run directly by the NT Government, became part of the university. The Palmerston campus, for a few years previously a TAFE College, also became part of the university. The Palmerston campus is situated on University Avenue as this was the proposed site for a new university in a submission to the federal government in 1981. The second vice-chancellor was Professor Roger Holmes from Griffith University. After an initial excellent start to his period of office, he disappointed the university and local community by resigning after serving for only one semester to take up the post of vice-chancellor at University of Newcastle. He was replaced as third vice-chancellor by the then deputy vice- chancellor, Professor Ron McKay. Under his leadership, the financial constraints on the university increased. The environment of having to provide as wide as possible a tertiary education to a small population living in a very large area far from alternative institutions became even more hostile and the university did not prosper. In January 2001, the Katherine Rural College, including Mataranka Station, became part of the university. After McKay's resignation due to ill health in 2002, an interim vice-chancellor, Professor Ken McKinnon, former vice-chancellor of the University of Wollongong was appointed. He took various actions to improve the health of the university, some controversial, such as the proposal to merge with Centralian College with a new name for the university. =Charles Darwin University= Library, Palmerston campus On 21 August 2003, the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly passed the Charles Darwin University Act 2003 (NT), merging Alice Springs' Centralian College and the Menzies School of Health Research with the Northern Territory University to form Charles Darwin University from 1 January 2004. The inaugural university council meeting was held on 26 November 2003. In 2020 Charles Darwin University caved to pressure from Chinese students and reprimanded a professor for including the line \\"... global pandemic originating in Wuhan, China has caused over 250,000 deaths, rendered millions of people ill, and inflicted recession on most areas of the global economy.‚Äù in the background for an assignment in a course on sustainability. The University incorrectly claimed that the assignment contained \\"inaccurate and insensitive wording.\\" CDU Student Administration Director Sam Jacob apologized and stated that such an incident would never occur again. Organisation Charles Darwin University is a dual-sector university, which means the university offers Vocational Education and Training (VET) courses and higher education undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, covering a wide range of subjects and disciplines. Enrolments in 2011 totalled 22,111 students, with 13,367 students enrolled in vocational and educational training courses and 8744 enrolled in higher education degrees. There are three areas of study offered by the university: * Faculty of Engineering, Health, Science and the Environment * Faculty of Law, Education, Business and Arts * Vocational Education and Training The formerly independent Menzies School of Health Research is incorporated as a school within the university's Institute of Advanced Studies. The Menzies School of Health Research is a joint venture between CDU, the Menzies Foundation and the University of Sydney and is located both on campus at CDU Casuarina and at the Royal Darwin Hospital. The university has close links with Flinders University in South Australia, which itself has many students from the Northern Territory, including joint management of the Centre for Remote Health in Alice Springs and the Northern Territory Medical Program which is located on campus at Casuarina CDU.

The university was founded in 1457 by the Habsburg dynasty as the second university in Austrian-Habsburg territory after the University of Vienna. Today, Freiburg is the fifth-oldest university in Germany, with a long tradition of teaching the humanities, social sciences and natural sciences and enjoys a high academic reputation both nationally and internationally. The university is made up of 11 faculties and attracts students from across Germany as well as from over 120 other countries. Foreign students constitute about 18.2% of total student numbers. The University of Freiburg has been associated with figures such as Martin Heidegger, Hannah Arendt, Rudolf Carnap, David Daube, Johann Eck, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Friedrich Hayek, Edmund Husserl, Edith Stein, Friedrich Meinecke, Max Weber, Paul Uhlenhuth and Ernst Zermelo. As of October 2020, 22 Nobel laureates are affiliated with the University of Freiburg as alumni, faculty or researchers, and 15 academics have been honored with the highest German research prize, the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize, while working at the university. History =Foundation= Albert VI of Austria, founder of the University Originally Albrechts University, the university started with four faculties (theology, philosophy, medicine, and law). Its establishment belongs to the second wave of university foundings in the German-speaking world in the late Middle Ages, like the University of T√ºbingen and the University of Basel (Switzerland). Established by papal privilege (papal bull), the University in Freiburg actually was - like all or most universities in the Middle Ages - a corporation of the church body and therefore belonged to the Roman Catholic Church and its hierarchy. The bishop of Basel consequently was its provost or chancellor (Kanzler), the bishop of Constance was its patron, and the real founder of the university was the sovereign, Archduke Albert VI of Austria, being the brother of Frederick III, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. At its founding, the university was named after Albert VI of Austria. He provided the university with land and endowments, as well as its own jurisdiction. Also he declared Albrechts University as the \\"county university\\" (German Landesuniversit√§t) for his territory until it was handed over to the Austrian House of Habsburg in 1490. Freiburg around 1900 The university soon attracted many students, such as the humanists Geiler von Kaysersberg, Johann Reuchlin, and Jakob Wimpfeling. When Ulrich Zasius was teaching law (until 1536), Freiburg became a centre of humanist jurisprudence. From 1529 to 1535, Erasmus of Rotterdam after having left Basel, lived and taught in Freiburg, however, never at the university. Hermann Mayer: Erasmus in seinen Beziehungen zur Universit√§t Freiburg http://dl.ub.uni- freiburg.de/diglit/zgb1907/0311/ocr From around 1559 on, the university was housed at the Altes Collegium (\\"Old College\\"), today called the \\"new town- hall\\". The importance of the university decreased during the time of the Counter-Reformation. To counter reformatory tendencies, the administration of two faculties was handed over to the Roman Catholic order of the Jesuits in 1620. From 1682 on, the Jesuits built their college, as well as the Jesuit church (nowadays the \\"University Church\\" or Universit√§tskirche). =Studium Gallicum= In 1679, Freiburg temporarily became French territory, along with the southern parts of the upper Rhine. French King Louis XIV disliked the Austrian system and gave the Jesuits a free hand to operate the university. On November 6, 1684, a bilingual educational program was initiated. From 1686 to 1698, the faculty fled to Konstanz. =Austrian reforms= After Freiburg was re-conquered and appointed as capital of Further Austria, a new time began for the university by the reforms of Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. The requirements for admission were changed for all faculties in 1767 (before that time only Roman Catholics were allowed to study) and Natural Sciences were added as well as Public Administration. Also in 1767, the university became a governmental institution despite the Church's protests. The Church finally lost its predominant influence on the university when the Jesuits were suppressed following a decree signed by Pope Clement XIV in 1773. Consequently, Johann Georg Jacobi (brother of the more famous philosopher Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi) in 1784 was the first Protestant professor teaching at the university in Freiburg. When Freiburg became a part of the newly established Grand Duchy of Baden (in German \\"Gro√üherzogtum Baden\\") in 1805 (after Napoleon occupied the area of the formerly Further Austria), a crisis began for the university in Freiburg. Indeed, there were considerations by Karl Friedrich, Grand Duke of Baden and Karl, Grand Duke of Baden to close down the university in Freiburg while both of them thought that the Grand Duchy could not afford to run two universities at the same time (the Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg had existed since 1386). =University of Freiburg= The university had enough endowments and earnings to survive until the beginning of the regency of Ludwig I, Grand Duke of Baden in 1818. Finally in 1820, he saved the university with an annual contribution. Since then, the university has been named Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg (Albert- Ludwigs-Universit√§t Freiburg) as an acknowledgement of gratitude by the university and the citizens of Freiburg. Postage stamp by Deutsche Bundespost to commemorate the university's 500th anniversary in 1957 In the 1880s, the population of the student body and faculty started to grow quickly. The scientific reputation of Albert Ludwigs University attracted several researchers such as economist Adolph Wagner, historians Georg von Below and Friedrich Meinecke, and jurists Karl von Amira and Paul Lenel. Kollegiengeb√§ude I, erected in 1913 as the main building of the university In 1900, Freiburg became the first German university to accept female students. Before there had been no women at German universities. In the beginning of the 20th century, several new university buildings were built in the centre of Freiburg, such as the new main building in 1911. The university counted 3,000 students just before World War I. After World War I, the philosophers Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger (since 1928) taught at Albert Ludwigs University, as well as Edith Stein. In the field of social sciences, Walter Eucken developed the idea of ordoliberalism, which subsequently is known as the \\"Freiburg School\\". =Third Reich= Hermann Staudinger During the Third Reich, the university went through the process of \\"political alignment\\" (Gleichschaltung) like the rest of the German universities. Under the rector Martin Heidegger, all Jewish faculty members were forced to leave the university in accordance with the \\"Law for the Reintroduction of Professional Civil Service\\". He also informed the Gestapo of the pacifist leanings of a distinguished Faculty member, Hermann Staudinger. The Nazi geneticist Eugen Fischer promoted racist views while a member of the University, ideas which were used to support the notorious Nuremburg laws passed by the Nazis. =Postwar years= The University of Freiburg in 1961 After World War II, the university was reopened. New buildings for natural sciences were erected in the Institutsviertel (\\"institute quarter\\"). In the postwar years, the ideas of ordoliberalism, developed earlier by economists of the Freiburg School, such as Walter Eucken, Franz B√∂hm, Hans Grossmann-Doerth, and Leonhard Miksch, drove the creation of the German social market economy and its attendant Wirtschaftswunder. Nobel Prize winner and former professor at the University of Freiburg, Friedrich Hayek, is also associated with this theory. He directed the Walter Eucken Institut, an economic think tank in Freiburg cooperating with the university. Arnold Bergstraesser, considered a founding father or German political science after World War II, was also a professor at the University of Freiburg. His research group later formed what is now the Arnold Bergstraesser Institute for sociocultural research at the university. In the late 20th century, the university was part of a mass education campaign and expanded rapidly. The student body grew to 10,000 by the 1960s, and doubled to 20,000 students by 1980. In the 1970s, the faculty structure was changed to 14 departments, with the Faculty of Engineering becoming the 15th faculty in 1994. In 2002, the number of faculties was reduced to 11. The university opened a memorial dedicated to the victims of National Socialism among the students, staff, and faculty in 2003. In 2006, the University of Freiburg joined the League of European Research Universities (LERU). One year later, the University was chosen as one of nine German Universities of Excellence. However, it did not receive the third line of funding in 2012. The university seal is set into the floor at the entrance of the largest lecture hall - auditorium maximum =University seal= The seal of the University of Freiburg depicts the educator Christ seated on a gothic throne holding the gospel in his right hand with the temple curtain in the background. Christ offers the teachings of the gospel to the Jewish scholars who are crouched at his feet. To the left and right of Christ are structures resembling towers, most likely symbolic of the Temple of Jerusalem. Located to the right of Christ is the coat of arms of the Austrian duchies, a banner with five eagles. The shield on the opposite side symbolizes the coat of arms used by the Habsburgs in conjunction with their territories. The coat of arms of the city of Freiburg is located at the bottom of the seal, displaying St George's Cross. The Latin inscription on the seal reads Sigillum universitatis studii friburgensis brisgaudie. The seal was slightly modified in 1913, but has otherwise been in continuous use since it was adopted in 1462. Campus Aristotle, in front of the Kollegiengeb√§ude I Having grown with the city since the 15th century, the university's buildings are deeply intertwined with the city. The three large campuses are the university center next to the historical city center, the institutes quarter, and the engineering campus, but other buildings can be found scattered throughout Freiburg. The Department of Surgery at the University Medical Center The university complex in the historical center of Freiburg contains such picturesque buildings as the Jugendstil Kollegiengeb√§ude I, built in 1911 by Hermann Billing, and the gothic revival old university library. The current University Library is also located in the historical center; it is a monumental building erected in the 1970s, and was to be renovated and redesigned beginning in September, 2008. It is one of the largest in Germany and placed fourth in an October, 2007, German national ranking of university libraries. The University Church, located across from Kollegiengeb√§ude II, was built in 1683 by the Jesuit order. The church and the Jesuit college were handed over to the university after the Jesuit order was suppressed in 1773. The church was destroyed in the November 27, 1944, bombing raid on Freiburg, and reconstructed in 1956. The ‚Äúinstitute quarter‚Äù (Institutsviertel) is home to the science faculties. This campus was destroyed almost completely in the Freiburg bombing raid in 1944. After World War II, the reconstruction of the institutes began. Today, the quarter houses the physics buildings, the tall main chemistry building, visible from afar, the famous Institute for Macromolecular Chemistry at the Hermann-Staudinger- Haus, various other science buildings, and the renowned preclinical institutes of the Faculty of Medicine. The University Library in Freiburg The engineering campus is located next to the small Freiburg airfield to the northwest of the city center, close to the University Medical Center. The campus is home to the Institut f√ºr Mikrosystemtechnik ( Department of Microsystems Engineering) and the Department of Computer Science. With the addition of the Faculty of Engineering, the University of Freiburg became the first classical university to combine traditional disciplines with microsystems technologies. The University Medical Center (Universit√§tsklinikum Freiburg) is one of Germany's largest medical centers. It boasts 1,600 beds and handles 55,000 in-patients a year, with another 357,000 being treated as out-patients. It consists of 13 specialized clinics, five clinical institutes, and five centers (e.g. Center for Transplantation Medicine). The University Medical Center achieved many technical advances, such as the first implantation of an artificial heart Jarvik 2000 in 2002. Most recently, the University of Freiburg purchased a large historic villa in the district of Herdern, which will house part of the literature and linguistics, as well as history departments of the Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies. In 2015, the University of Freiburg opened its new library, housed in a modern building with a large glass and chrome facade. The library features a section for quiet work and the permanent collection as well as space for group work, where collaboration is encouraged. The building also includes a student cafe and an outdoor plaza with modern sculpture. Students and admission Kollegiengeb√§ude IV, Humanities Faculty (former University Library) The university has a combined undergraduate and graduate student population of around 21,600. About 16% of these students are foreigners, from about 120 different countries. Admission largely depends on the faculty and program applied for and is strictly merit based, with the average score of final secondary-school examinations (German Abitur) or A-levels playing an important role. Overall, in the fall of 2010, roughly 4,000 of around 26,000 applicants were admitted, this means that the University's acceptance rate that year was equal to 15.38%. The University of Freiburg offers a large variety of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral degree programs at its 11 faculties in 150 fields of study.See more at As common among German universities, the academic year consists of summer and winter terms (semesters). The winter term runs from October 1 to March 31, while the summer term runs from April 1 to September 30. However, lectures and classes usually do not run for the full duration of these periods and allow for breaks in spring and fall. As a German university, tuition is mostly free. The University of Freiburg currently has a semester fee of 155 EUR for all undergraduate and most graduate and doctoral programs, regardless of the EU or non-EU citizenship of students. Additionally, since autumn 2017, non-EU students are charged 1500 EUR tuition fee per semester.http://www.studium.uni- freiburg.de/en/student-services/study-fees?set_language=en =Student life= Numerous student clubs and organizations are active, among them a campus radio station, echo-fm, and a student television station, alma*, which is also available as a podcast. Because of the nearby French and Swiss borders and the adjacent Black Forest, where the university owns a retreat on Schauinsland Mountain, fine opportunities exist for leisure and outdoor activities. Students come from Central and Eastern Europe for language studies, the majority demographic category is females in age range 18-25 (58%). The university provides student housing in its various dormitories, run by the Studentenwerk. Additionally, further dormitories in Freiburg are operated by other institutions, such as the Catholic Archdiocese. Due to the affordable rent and limited spots, rooms in the various dormitories are very popular. Many students find private living arrangements, such as Wohngemeinschaften (shared apartments). However, the popularity of Freiburg for prospective students can make finding an apartment or room quite time-consuming, especially before the start of the academic terms. The university has its own career center, singled out as one of the best in Germany by the Stifterverband f√ºr die Deutsche Wissenschaft. Academics =Excellence initiative= right The university scored well with its submissions to the German Universities Excellence Initiative. The university received funding in all three categories. In the first category, funding for a new graduate school, the Spemann Graduate School of Biology and Medicine, was granted; in the second, funding was granted for the excellence cluster Centre for Biological Signalling Studies (bioss); and in the third category, Institutional Strategy Line of Funding, open only to institutions with submissions qualified in the first two categories, the university is receiving funding for \\"Windows for Research\\", which aims to promote a high level of interdisciplinarity between research fields and attract scientists from all over the world. To that end, the university founded the Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies (FRIAS). Being selected for the third category ranks Freiburg as one of nine \\"excellence universities\\" in Germany. The University is to receive over EUR 130 million in additional funds over five years (from 2007) from this third category of funding. In 2009, the University was also successful in a nationwide competition for excellence in teaching, held by the Stifterverband der deutschen Wissenschaft. The University of Freiburg, with its plans for future innovative teaching concepts, was selected as one of 10 winners from a field of over 100 higher education institutions. In 2012, in the third round of the Excellence Initiative, the university was able to successfully extend funding for the Spemann Graduate School of Biology and Medicine, as well as bioss, while also gaining funding for a new cluster called BrainLinks-Brain Tools, an interdisciplinary neurotechnology project. Citing insufficient evidence of integration of the FRIAS concept into the university's framework, the committee did not extend funding for the FRIAS and the institutional strategy line of funding, despite acknowledging the impressive research and advances achieved at FRIAS in the past years. =Reputation= In university rankings published in 2007 and 2008 by German magazines and periodicals (Der Spiegel, Die Zeit, Focus, etc.) the University of Freiburg has established itself as one of Germany's top universities. The faculties for law, medicine, economics, history, English studies, German studies, biology, dentistry, and pharmacology achieve especially high scores. and In regards to the natural sciences, the University of Freiburg ranked sixth in Europe and second in Germany in a ranking from 2003 of the European Commission of the universities according to their overall impact on scientific research. The Centre for Higher Education Development, a German higher education think tank, periodically publishes comprehensive rankings of European Master's and PhD programs. In 2016, Freiburg garnered five spots in the top Excellence Group among seven subject fields examined. In a recent survey by the Nature Publishing Group, the Nature Publishing Index - 2012 Global Top 100, the University of Freiburg was the highest-ranked German university and ranked 66th worldwide and 18th in Europe. A recent study, \\"Benchmarking China and Germany: An Analysis of Patent Portfolios of Universities and Research Organizations\\", was published in May 2013 and sought to evaluate leading universities and research institutions in Germany and China in regards to their patent applications. The study placed the University of Freiburg as the third-most innovative university in Germany in terms of total patent applications. =Current affairs= Teams of the University of Freiburg frequently participate in academic competitions with considerable success. The moot court team of the Faculty of Law has been the most successful team in the history of the competition Willem C. Vis International Commercial Arbitration Moot. The humanoid robot team of the Faculty of Engineering regularly competes with distinction in international tournaments. The University of Freiburg team has also repeatedly scored highly at the International Genetically Engineered Machine undergraduate synthetic biology competition held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The team was supported by numerous university institutions, among them the recently established bioss cluster of excellence. The University of Freiburg also participates in the National Model United Nations held annually in New York City. The genetically engineered golden rice was developed by the University of Freiburg (Peter Beyer) and the ETH Zurich (Ingo Potrykus) from 1992 to 2000. It was considered a breakthrough in biotechnology at the time of publication and now can help to provide vitamin A to people lacking access to it in their diets. When previous rector Prof. Dr. J√§ger retired in 2008, law professor Prof. Dr. Andreas Vo√ükuhle was chosen as his successor. However, shortly after the start of his term, the Social Democratic Party of Germany nominated Vo√ükuhle as vice-president of the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany. Vo√ükuhle accepted the nomination, was confirmed, and took his seat on the court in May 2008. In July 2008, then vice-rector Prof. Dr. Hans-Jochen Schiewer was elected as successor to Vo√ükuhle. Schiewer has assumed the position of rector with the start of the winter term 2008/2009. The University of Freiburg offers educational audio and video contents on the iTunes U software platform since January 2008. The University of Freiburg Institute of Physics is actively involved with research at the Large Hadron Collider and has contributed significantly to the ATLAS experiment, resulting in the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012. Organization and faculties \\"Die Wahrheit wird euch frei machen\\" (The truth will set you free) Today, about 430 professors, 3,695 academic employees, and 8,644 non-academic employees at the university are working for the Albert Ludwigs University, making it Freiburg's and the region's biggest employer. The university attracts many academics from abroad and was awarded excellent positions in the 2005 and 2009 Humboldt Ranking. =Faculties= The university is headed by a rector and divided into 11 faculties: *Faculty of Theology *Faculty of Law *Faculty of Medicine *Faculty of Economics and Behavioural Sciences *Faculty of Philology *Faculty of Philosophy (history, sociology, etc.) *Faculty of Mathematics and Physics *Faculty of Chemistry, Pharmacy, and Geosciences *Faculty of Biology *Faculty of Forest and Environmental Sciences *Faculty of Engineering =Graduate schools= Kollegiengeb√§ude II and central university square The University of Freiburg has a variety of graduate education and research opportunities. In an evaluation of European graduate programs, Freiburg was ranked among the leading universities in several subject fields examined. One of the notable graduate opportunities is the Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies, a project funded by the German Excellence Initiative. Apart from the many graduate programs of its faculties, Freiburg has set up additional specialized graduate schools and graduate research centers, coordinated by the newly founded International Graduate Academy (IGA) Freiburg. The IGA coordinates five graduate schools: the Spemann Graduate School of Biology and Medicine; the European Cultures and Intercultural Interweaving school; the Theology and Religious Studies school; the Hermann Paul School of Language Sciences, and the Environment, Society and Global Change graduate school of the Faculty of Forest and Environmental Sciences. The IGA also coordinates 12 Graduate Research Centers (Graduiertenkolleg): Biochemistry of Enzymes; Friends, Patrons, Clients; Formation and Development of Present-Day Landscapes; Mathematical Logics and Applications; Mechanisms of Neuronal Signal Transduction; Catalysts and Catalytic Reactions for Organic Synthesis (in cooperation with the University of Basel); Hadron Collider Physics; Embedded Microsystems; From Cells to Organs: Molecular Mechanisms of Organogenesis; Signal Systems in Model Organisms of Plant Origin; Micro Energy Harvesting; and PhD program Computational Neuroscience at the Bernstein Center Freiburg for Computational Neuroscience and Neurotechnology. Finally, the university operates three joint graduate schools with the Max Planck Society: the International Max Planck Research School for Molecular and Cellular Biology; the International Max Planck Research School on Retaliation, Mediation and Punishment; and the International Max Planck Research School for Comparative Criminal Law. Together with the EUCOR universities of Basel and Strasbourg and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, the University of Freiburg also runs the shared graduate school √âcole sup√©rieure de biotechnologie Strasbourg, enabling the students to obtain an international degree in biotechnology and a trilingual education, as classes are taught in English, German, and French. =International language courses= The University of Freiburg has offered German language courses for foreign students since 1911. The courses take place at the university's Language Teaching Centre ('Sprachlehrinstitut) during the semester breaks and attract students from over 50 nations to Freiburg. The intensive language lessons are bolstered by a supplementary program with lectures and seminars on German culture, politics, philosophy, and art, as well as excursions to the Black Forest, the Alsace region in France, Basel (Switzerland) or Lake Constance. In addition to classes for all language levels, professional German courses (e.g. business German) are also offered. =University College Freiburg= Logo at the entrance of University College Freiburg University College Freiburg (UCF) is the University's central facility for promoting and administering international, interdisciplinary teaching activities. It complements and supports the faculties‚Äô work in this field, serves as a laboratory for innovative approaches to teaching and instructional design, and houses high-profile projects, notably the bachelor's program in Liberal Arts and Sciences. This four-year degree is the University of Freiburg's first interdisciplinary, English-taught undergraduate program and the first of its kind in Germany. It started in October 2012. UCF works in close co-operation with the faculties, the Rectorate's departments for Instructional Development and International Relations, and with the Language Teaching Center. Sustainability The green at the central mensa (cafeteria) on Rempartstra√üe The city of Freiburg is known for its environmentally friendly policies and focus on renewable energy and sustainability, attracting solar industry and research to the city. This environmentally conscious attitude also extends to the University of Freiburg which has founded the work group \\"Nachhaltige Universit√§t Freiburg\\" (Sustainable University of Freiburg) and has drawn up environmental guidelines to be implemented in university practice. The university has also founded the initiative Solar-Uni Freiburg in 2007, with the aim of further expanding its capabilities in sustainability and environmental research. Solar panels were installed on the roofs of university buildings. To bundle renewable energy research and teaching at the university, the Center for Renewable Energy (ZEE, Zentrum f√ºr Erneuerbare Energien), an interdisciplinary and cross-faculty facility, was founded. Aside from research in the fields of solar energy, biomass, geothermal energy, energy efficiency and new energies, an international Master of Science degree in Renewable Energy Management is being offered. In addition to its own expertise, the Center for Renewable Energy can draw upon the support of the renewable energy industrial sector in Freiburg, as well as the university's cooperation with other research institutes in the area, such as the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE, the √ñko-Institut - Institute for Applied Ecology, or the University of Applied Sciences Offenburg.

After flowing through southwest Herefordshire, England, and eastern Monmouthshire, Wales, its confluence with the River Wye is approximately south of Monmouth. The Monnow rises near Craswall on Cefn Hill just below the high Black Mountains, Wales. It flows southwards, gaining the waters of its tributaries the Escley Brook and Olchon Brook near Clodock and the waters of the River Honddu, from the Welsh side of the Black Mountains, near Pandy. The river then flows briefly eastwards, to Pontrilas, where it is joined by its largest tributary, the River Dore before again turning southwards. At Monmouth, the Monnow joins into the River Wye with the River Trothy. The unique medieval Monnow Bridge in Monmouth is the only remaining fortified river bridge in Great Britain with its gate tower standing on the bridge. The long-distance Monnow Valley Walk follows the river. Toponymy The River Monnow derives its name from the Welsh (', Myn- wy) and translates to \\"swift water\\". (myn means swift, and wy is one of the many Welsh words for water) Brown trout At one time the river was noted for its substantial brown trout population, with the length from Pontrilas to Skenfrith producing record catches. Numbers fell substantially during the 20th century and especially after the 1960s but in more recent years the trout fishing has improved dramatically and the Monnow catchment once again ranks as one of the best wild trout fisheries in England and Wales and it is now also noted for the grayling fishing. A recently opened fish pass at Monmouth allowing migratory fish to by-pass a previously impassable weir has once more given Atlantic salmon and sea trout access to the majority of the catchment and salmon were seen jumping at the now dismantled Kentchurch weir for the first time for many years in the Autumn of 2008. The Monnow Rivers Association takes a large amount of the credit for the improvement in the fishing through their work on habitat improvement throughout the catchment and encouraging anglers to return a high proportion of fish caught safely to the water. Hydroelectric power At Osbaston, immediately north of Monmouth, the Monmouth New Hydro Scheme harnesses the flow of the Monnow to provide 670,000 kWh of electricity per year. The Osbaston fish pass facilitates the passage of river-spawning fish and other species past what would otherwise be an obstruction.

The filament (which was also the cathode) would be at the lower left inside the tube, but the filament has burned out and is no longer present. The filament's connecting and supporting wires are visible. The plate is at the middle top, and the grid is the serpentine electrode below it. The plate and grid connections leave the tube at the right. The Audion was an electronic detecting or amplifying vacuum tube invented by American electrical engineer Lee de Forest in 1906.De Forest patented a number of variations of his detector tubes starting in 1906. The patent that most clearly covers the Audion is , Space Telegraphy, filed January 29, 1907, issued February 18, 1908 The link is to a reprint of the paper in the Scientific American Supplement, No. 1665, November 30, 1907, p.348-350, copied on Thomas H. White's United States Early Radio History website It was the first triode, consisting of an evacuated glass tube containing three electrodes: a heated filament, a grid, and a plate. It is important in the history of technology because it was the first widely used electronic device which could amplify; a small electrical signal applied to the grid could control a larger current flowing from the filament to plate. The original triode Audion had more residual gas in the tube than later versions and vacuum tubes; the extra residual gas limited the dynamic range and gave the Audion non-linear characteristics and erratic performance. Originally developed as a radio receiver detector by adding a grid electrode to the Fleming valve, it found little use until its amplifying ability was recognized around 1912 by several researchers, who used it to build the first amplifying radio receivers and electronic oscillators.. Republished as The many practical applications for amplification motivated its rapid development, and the original Audion was superseded within a few years by improved versions with higher vacuum.  History  One of the earliest Audion radio receivers, constructed by De Forest in 1914. Audion tubes were mounted upside down, with the delicate filament hanging down, to prevent it from sagging and touching the grid. This was a detector (rectifier) and two stage audio amplifier unit; the radio signal came from a separate \\"tuner\\" unit. It had been known since the middle of the 19th century that gas flames were electrically conductive, and early wireless experimenters had noticed that this conductivity was affected by the presence of radio waves. De Forest found that gas in a partial vacuum heated by a conventional lamp filament behaved much the same way, and that if a wire were wrapped around the glass housing, the device could serve as a detector of radio signals. In his original design, a small metal plate was sealed into the lamp housing, and this was connected to the positive terminal of a 22-volt battery via a pair of headphones, the negative terminal being connected to one side of the lamp filament. When wireless signals were applied to the wire wrapped around the outside of the glass, they caused disturbances in the current which produced sounds in the headphones. This was a significant development as existing commercial wireless systems were heavily protected by patents; a new type of detector would allow De Forest to market his own system. He eventually discovered that connecting the antenna circuit to a third electrode placed directly in the current path greatly improved the sensitivity; in his earliest versions, this was simply a piece of wire bent into the shape of a grid-iron (hence \\"grid\\"). The Audion provided power gain; with other detectors, all of the power to operate the headphones had to come from the antenna circuit itself. Consequently, weak transmitters could be heard at greater distances. = Patents and disputes = De Forest and everybody else at the time greatly underestimated the potential of his original device, imagining it to be limited to mostly military applications. It is significant that he apparently never saw its potential as a telephone repeater amplifier, even though crude electromechanical note magnifiers had been the bane of the telephone industry for at least two decades. (Ironically, in the years of patent disputes leading up to World War I, it was only this \\"loophole\\" that allowed vacuum triodes to be manufactured at all since none of De Forest's patents specifically mentioned this application). De Forest was granted a patent for his early two-electrode version of the Audion on November 13, 1906 (), and the \\"triode\\" (three-electrode) version was patented in 1908 (). De Forest continued to claim that he developed the Audion independently from John Ambrose Fleming's earlier research on the thermionic valve (for which Fleming received Great Britain patent 24850 and the American Fleming valve patent ), and De Forest became embroiled in many radio-related patent disputes. De Forest was famous for saying that he \\"didn't know why it worked, it just did\\". He always referred to the vacuum triodes developed by other researchers as \\"Oscillaudions\\", although there is no evidence that he had any significant input to their development. It is true that after the invention of the true vacuum triode in 1913 (see below), De Forest continued to manufacture various types of radio transmitting and receiving apparatus, (examples of which are illustrated on this page). However, although he routinely described these devices as using \\"Audions\\", they actually used high-vacuum triodes, using circuitry very similar to that developed by other experimenters. In 1914, Columbia University student Edwin Howard Armstrong worked with professor John Harold Morecroft to document the electrical principles of the Audion. Armstrong published his explanation of the Audion in Electrical World in December 1914, complete with circuit diagrams and oscilloscope graphs. In March and April 1915, Armstrong spoke to the Institute of Radio Engineers in New York and Boston, respectively, presenting his paper \\"Some Recent Developments in the Audion Receiver\\", which was published in September. A combination of the two papers was reprinted in other journals such as the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences. When Armstrong and De Forest later faced each other in a dispute over the regeneration patent, Armstrong was able to demonstrate conclusively that De Forest still had no idea how it worked. The problem was that (possibly to distance his invention from the Fleming valve) De Forest's original patents specified that low-pressure gas inside the Audion was essential to its operation (Audion being a contraction of \\"Audio- Ion\\"), and in fact early Audions had severe reliability problems due to this gas being adsorbed by the metal electrodes. The Audions sometimes worked extremely well; at other times they would barely work at all. As well as De Forest himself, numerous researchers had tried to find ways to improve the reliability of the device by stabilizing the partial vacuum. Much of the research that led to the development of true vacuum tubes was carried out by Irving Langmuir in the General Electric (GE) research laboratories. =Kenotron and Pliotron= thumbupright=1.2Audions and early triodes developed from them, 1918. Bottom row (D): De Forest Audions Third row (C): Pliotrons, developed at General Electric by Langmuir Second row (B): triodes developed at Western Electric which bought the rights from De Forest in 1913. These were used in telephone repeaters which made possible the first transcontinental telephone line in 1915. Top row (A): French triodes. The French government gained the right to manufacture Audions in 1912 when De Forest failed to renew his French patents for lack of $125. General Electric Company Pliotron Langmuir had long suspected that certain assumed limitations on the performance of various low- pressure and vacuum electrical devices, might not be fundamental physical limitations at all, but simply due to contamination and impurities in the manufacturing process. His first success was in demonstrating that, contrary to what Edison and others had long asserted, incandescent lamps could function more efficiently and with longer life if the glass envelope was filled with low-pressure inert gas rather than a complete vacuum. However, this only worked if the gas used was meticulously 'scrubbed\\" of all traces of oxygen and water vapor. He then applied the same approach to producing a rectifier for the newly developed \\"Coolidge\\" X-ray tubes. Again contrary to what had been widely believed to be possible, by virtue of meticulous cleanliness and attention to detail, he was able to produce versions of the Fleming Diode that could rectify hundreds of thousands of volts. His rectifiers were called \\"Kenotrons\\" from the Greek keno (empty, contains nothing, as in a vacuum) and tron (device, instrument). He then turned his attention to the Audion tube, again suspecting that its notoriously unpredictable behaviour might be tamed with more care in the manufacturing process. However he took a somewhat unorthodox approach. Instead of trying to stabilize the partial vacuum, he wondered if it was possible to make the Audion function with the total vacuum of a Kenotron, since that was somewhat easier to stabilize. He soon realized that his \\"vacuum\\" Audion had markedly different characteristics from the De Forest version, and was really a quite different device, capable of linear amplification and at much higher frequencies. To distinguish his device from the Audion he named it the \\"Pliotron\\", from the Greek plio (more or extra, in this sense meaning gain, more signal coming out than went in). Essentially, he referred to all his vacuum tube designs as Kenotrons, the Pliotron basically being a specialized type of Kenotron. However, because Pliotron and Kenotron were registered trademarks, technical writers tended to use the more generic term \\"vacuum tube\\". By the mid-1920s, the term \\"Kenotron\\" had come to exclusively refer to vacuum tube rectifiers, while the term \\"Pliotron\\" had fallen into disuse. Ironically, in popular usage, the sound-alike brands \\"Radiotron\\" and \\"Ken-Rad\\" outlasted the original names.  Applications and use  The first Audion AM radio transmitter, built by Lee De Forest and announced April, 1914 Some of the earliest Audion AM radio transmitters, built by De Forest around 1916. The invention of the Audion oscillator in 1912 made inexpensive sound radio transmission possible, and was responsible for the advent of radio broadcasting around 1920. Audion advertisement, Electrical Experimenter magazine, 1916 De Forest continued to manufacture and supply Audions to the US Navy up until the early 1920s, for maintenance of existing equipment, but elsewhere they were regarded as well and truly obsolete by then. It was the vacuum triode that made practical radio broadcasts a reality. Prior to the introduction of the Audion, radio receivers had used a variety of detectors including coherers, barretters, and crystal detectors. The most popular crystal detector consisted of a small piece of galena crystal probed by a fine wire commonly referred to as a \\"cat's-whisker detector\\". They were very unreliable, requiring frequent adjustment of the cat's whisker and offered no amplification. Such systems usually required the user to listen to the signal through headphones, sometimes at very low volume, as the only energy available to operate the headphones was that picked up by the antenna. For long distance communication huge antennas were normally required, and enormous amounts of electrical power had to be fed into the transmitter. The Audion was a considerable improvement on this, but the original devices could not provide any subsequent amplification to what was produced in the signal detection process. The later vacuum triodes allowed the signal to be amplified to any desired level, typically by feeding the amplified output of one triode into the grid of the next, eventually providing more than enough power to drive a full-sized speaker. Apart from this, they were able to amplify the incoming radio signals prior to the detection process, making it work much more efficiently. Vacuum tubes could also be used to make superior radio transmitters. The combination of much more efficient transmitters and much more sensitive receivers revolutionized radio communication during World War I. By the late 1920s such \\"tube radios\\" began to become a fixture of most Western world households, and remained so until long after the introduction of transistor radios in the mid-1950s. In modern electronics, the vacuum tube has been largely superseded by solid state devices such as the transistor, invented in 1947 and implemented in integrated circuits in 1959, although vacuum tubes remain to this day in such applications as high-powered transmitters, guitar amplifiers and some high fidelity audio equipment.

H. Asquith's Liberal government in 1913. Some members of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU, commonly referred to as suffragettes) had been imprisoned for acts of vandalism in support of women's suffrage. In protest at being imprisoned, some of the suffragettes undertook hunger strikes. The hunger strikers were force-fed by the prison staff, leading to a public outcry. The act was a response to the protestations. It allowed the prisoners to be released on licence as soon as the hunger strike affected their health; they then had a predetermined period of time in which to recover after which they were rearrested and taken back to prison to serve out the rest of their sentence. Conditions could be placed on the prisoner during the time of their release. One effect of the act was to make hunger strikes technically legal. The nickname of the act came about because of the domestic cat's habit of playing with its prey, allowing it to temporarily escape a number of times, before killing it. Government use After the act was introduced, force-feeding was no longer used to combat hunger strikes. Instead, suffragettes on hunger strike were kept in prison until they became extremely weak, at which point they would be temporarily released in order to recover. This effectively allowed the government to claim that it was not responsible for any harm (or even death) which might result from the starvation. During the recovery period, any law-breaking on the part of the suffragette would see them put straight back in prison. The time spent out of prison recovering was not counted as time served towards the hunger strikers' prison sentences. Once deemed recovered, they would be recalled to prison to continue their sentence. This meant that suffragettes could be repeatedly released and imprisoned without trial for the same offence. Background Holloway prison, 1911 To attain the goal of suffrage on the same basis as men, the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU, known colloquially as the suffragettes) engaged in acts of protest such as the breaking of windows, arson, and the \\"technical assault\\" (without causing harm) of police officers. Many WSPU members were jailed for these offences. In response to what the organisation viewed as brutal punishment and harsh treatment by the government at the time, imprisoned WSPU members embarked on a sustained campaign of hunger strikes. Some women were freed on taking this action, but this rendered the policy of imprisonment of suffragettes futile. The prison authorities then turned to a policy of force feeding hunger- strikers by nasogastric tube. Repeated uses of this process often caused sickness, which served the WSPU's aims of demonstrating the government's harsh treatment of the prisoners. Faced with growing public disquiet over the tactic of force feeding, and the determination of the jailed suffragettes to continue their hunger strikes, the government rushed the act through Parliament. The effect of the act was to permit the release of prisoners for them to recuperate from the effects of a hunger strike whilst leaving the police free to re-imprison offenders once they had recovered. The intention of the act was to counter the tactic of hunger strikes and the damaging consequences for the government's support among (male) voters by the force feeding of women prisoners but, if anything, it reduced support for the Liberal government. Women writing about the experience of being forcibly fed In a book called Suffrage and the Pankhursts, Jane Marcus argues that forcible feeding was the main image of the women's suffrage movement in the public imagination. Women wrote about how the experience made them feel in letters, diaries, speeches and suffrage publications, including Votes for Women and The Suffragette. One of the force-fed suffragettes, Lady Constance Lytton, wrote a book that suggested that working-class women were more likely to be forcibly fed in prison than upper-class women. In general, the medical procedure of force feeding was described as a physical and mental violation that caused pain, suffering, emotional distress, humiliation, anguish and rage.Purvis, June; Emmeline Pankhurst, London: Routledge, p 134, Violet Bland also wrote in Votes for Women about her experiences of being force-fed, explaining how, \\"they twisted my neck, jerked my head back, closing my throat, held all the time as in a vice,\\" while they tried to force feed her. She wrote how the guards were always six or seven to one and that, \\"there was really no possibility of the victim doing much in the way of protesting excepting verbally, to express one‚Äôs horror of it; therefore no excuse for the brutality shown on several occasions.\\"Votes for Women, 5 July 1912 At the end of what she describes as her assault, when she didn't get up from her chair quickly enough because of her \\"helpless and breathless condition,\\" they snatched the chair from under her, throwing her to the floor. She wrote that she had no doubt the attacks were made with the intention of breaking the hunger-strikers down.Votes for Women, 5 July 1912 Unintended consequences The ineffectiveness of the act was very soon evident as the authorities experienced much more difficulty than anticipated in re-arresting the released hunger-strikers. Many of them eluded arrest with the help of a network of suffragette sympathisers and an all-women team of bodyguards, who employed tactics of misdirection, subterfuge and occasionally direct confrontation with the police. The inability of the government to lay its hands on high-profile suffragettes transformed what had been intended as a discreet device to control suffragette hunger-strikers into a public scandal. This act was aimed at suppressing the power of the organisation by demoralising the activists, but turned out to be counter-productive as it undermined the moral authority of the government. The act was viewed as violating basic human rights, not only of the suffragettes but of other prisoners. The act's nickname of \\"Cat and Mouse Act\\", referring to the way the government seemed to play with prisoners as a cat may with a captured mouse, underlined how the cruelty of repeated releases and re-imprisonments turned the suffragettes from targets of scorn to objects of sympathy. The Asquith government's implementation of the act caused the militant WSPU and the suffragettes to perceive Asquith as the enemy ‚Äì an enemy to be vanquished in what the organisation saw as an all-out war. A related effect of this law was to increase support for the Labour Party, many of whose early founders supported votes for women. For example, philosopher Bertrand Russell left the Liberal Party, and wrote pamphlets denouncing the act and the Liberals for making in his view an illiberal and anti-constitutional law. So the controversy helped to accelerate the decline in the Liberals' electoral position, as segments of the middle class began to defect to Labour. The act also handed the WSPU an issue on which to campaign and rail against other parts of the British establishment, in particular the Church of England. During 1913, the WSPU directly targeted the Bishop of Winchester, Edward Talbot; the Archbishop of Canterbury, Randall Davidson; the Bishop of London, Arthur Winnington-Ingram; the Archbishop of York, Cosmo Gordon Lang, and the Bishops of Croydon, Lewes, Islington and Stepney. Each one was picketed by deputations at their official residences until granted an audience, during which the church leaders were asked to protest against forcible feeding. Norah Dacre Fox led many of the deputations on behalf of the WSPU, which were widely reported in The Suffragette. At one point, the Bishop of London was persuaded to visit Holloway personally in connection with allegations of female prisoners being poisoned during force feeding. The Bishop made several visits to the prison, but this came to nothing, and his public statements said that he could find no evidence of ill treatment during force feeding ‚Äì indeed, he believed that force feeding was carried out \\"in the kindest possible spirit\\" ‚Äì was seen by the WSPU as collusion with the government and prison authorities. If the WSPU had been hoping to win support from the church for their wider cause by pressing on the issue of forcible feeding, they were disappointed. The church chose not to be drawn into a battle between the WSPU and the authorities, and maintained the party line that militancy was a precursor to forcible feeding and militancy was against the will of God, therefore the church could not act against forcible feeding. Research indicates that the act did little to deter the activities of the suffragettes. Their militant actions only ceased with the outbreak of war and their support for the war effort. However, the start of the war in August 1914, and the ending of all suffragette activities for the duration of the war, meant that the full potential impact of the Cat and Mouse Act will never be known.

They can be found in the stomach, intestine and the pancreatic islets. In rodents, delta- cells are located in the periphery of the islets; in humans the islet architecture is generally less organized and delta-cells are frequently observed inside the islets as well. In both species, the peptide hormone Urocortin3 (Ucn3) is a major local signal that is released from beta cells (and alpha cells in primates) to induce the local secretion of somatostatin. . It has also been suggested that somatostatin may be implicated in insulin- induced hypoglycaemia through a mechanism involving SGLT-2 receptors. Ghrelin can also strongly stimulate somatostatin secretion, thus indirectly inhibiting insulin release. Viewed under an electron microscope, delta-cells can be identified as cells with smaller and slightly more compact granules than beta cells. D cells in the stomach contain CCKBR (which respond to gastrin) and M3 receptors (which respond to Ach). Respectively, these receptors will increase somatostatin output and decrease somatostatin output from the D cells. VIP, vasoactive intestinal peptide, acts positively on D cells resulting in more somatostatin being released. In the stomach, somatostatin acts directly on the acid-producing parietal cells via a G-protein coupled receptor (which inhibits adenylate cyclase, thus effectively antagonising the stimulatory effect of histamine) to reduce acid secretion. Somatostatin can also indirectly decrease stomach acid production by preventing the release of other hormones, including gastrin, secretin and histamine which effectively slows down the digestive process. Clinical significance A tumor of the delta cells is called a \\"somatostatinoma\\". When a person is infected with H. pylori the lower region of the stomach, the antrum, is predominantly inflamed. This is where most of the D cells in the stomach are. The bacteria produce a cloud of ammonia around themselves using urease to protect them from the stomach acid; however, this reacts with the acid producing ammonium which is toxic to cells. This leads to many of the D cells dying and therefore a lower level of somatostatin being secreted. This results in higher levels of gastrin and stomach acid being secreted. This, combined with the damage from ammonium, leads to ulceration of the stomach wall.

They are identical twin brothers, and have very substantial business interests primarily in media, retail and property. The Sunday Times Rich List of 2020 estimated their wealth at ¬£7 billion. They have earned a reputation for avoiding publicity, and are often described as reclusive. Sir David's son, Aidan, manages their UK businesses. Their businesses have been accused of tax avoidance, by placing assets under ownership of companies registered abroad and controlled through trusts. Their Press Holdings company owns Apollo and The Spectator magazine and, through a wholly owned subsidiary (Press Acquisitions Limited), they also own Telegraph Group Limited, parent company of The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph.The Telegraph Press office In 1993 the brothers bought the lease of the island of Brecqhou, off the coast of Sark, Brecqhou being one of the smallest of the British Channel Islands.

Frederick, Sr. died when the brothers were twelve years old, and they left school four years later in 1950 to work in the accounts department at the General Electric Company before setting up as painters and decorators. In 1955 David married Zoe Newton, a grammar school girl who trained as a ballet dancer, at St John the Baptist Church, Holland Road, Kensington. Zoe Barclay pursued a modelling career and became the most photographed and highly paid model in Britain of her time,\\"Barclay brothers come out of purdah with biography\\", The Sunday Times, 3 August 2003. appearing on the front of popular magazines such as Picturegoer. She appeared on television and in the Dairy Council advertisements as the \\"drinka pinta milka day\\" girl.\\"Milk Bottle Museum\\", The Birmingham Post (archived at thefreelibrary.com) By the end of the 1950s, the brothers were running Candy Corner, a tobacconists and confectioners on the edge of Kensington. However, in November 1960, the business folded when Frederick and Douglas were made bankrupt at the High Court after their landlord seized the shop because they were in breach of the terms of the lease. A notice in the London Gazette at that time announced the bankruptcies, listing a former business interest of Frederick, then aged 26, and Douglas, two years his junior, as a builders and decorators called Barclay Brothers based at the Barclay family home. Meanwhile, David was registered as a director of Hillgate Estate Agents in 1962, with his wife Zoe as a co-director (she had given up her modelling career to concentrate on her young sons, Aidan, Howard and Duncan). By 1968, however, Frederick was running the family businesses, replacing Zoe on the Hillgate board. He had obtained the discharge of his bankruptcy after David paid the creditors. During this time they redeveloped old boarding houses in London, and made them into hotels. Between 1968 and 1974, the twins received increasingly large loans from the Crown Agents, a government agency designed to help the colonies and developing countries do business in Britain. In 1970, they bought Gestplan Hotels, which operated the exclusive Londonderry House Hotel in Park Lane, from a group of Lebanese bankers. In the mid-1970s, Frederick met and married Hiroko Asada, n√©e Kuzusaka, a familiar figure among Japanese society in London; she had a son from her previous marriage, Ko Asada Barclay who is married to Sara Love. From the late 1960s onwards, the Barclay brothers continued to build up stakes in a variety of businesses, including breweries and casinos. In 1975, they bought the Howard Hotel, overlooking the Thames at Temple Place. In 1983, they bought Ellerman, the brewing and shipping group for ¬£45m. They later sold its brewing division for ¬£240m. They used the proceeds to buy the Ritz Hotel in London's Piccadilly in 1995. They spent ¬£370 million on Gotaas-Larsen, a Bermuda-based shipping company, and ¬£200 million on the Automotive Financial Group, a motor retail chain in 1994. The brothers are involved in philanthropy and were knighted in 2000 for their support to medical research, to which they have donated an estimated ¬£40 million between 1987 and 2000.\\"Barclay twins knighted in 'double dubbing'\\", The Daily Telegraph, 1 November 2000. In 2004, they were listed in 42nd place with an estimate of ¬£750 million on The Sunday Times Rich List, and in 2006, they were ranked 24th with a value of ¬£1,800m. In 2012, they topped the Media Rich List with an estimate of ¬£2.25 billion. Business interests =Shipping= Ellerman Lines In 1983, the brothers purchased brewing and shipping group Ellerman for ¬£45m. They later sold its brewing division (for ¬£240m), and in late 1985 its shipping business (to its management). The Ellerman deal helped the Barclays develop the strategy of buying companies, breaking them up and profiting from the real estate. The technique of approaching an insider in order to obtain an advantage also set a precedent for later deals: the Barclays approached the Ellerman non-executive chairman, David Scott, at a secret meeting in Monte Carlo. Scott recalled in his memoirs that David Barclay requested an exclusive option to buy the firm, and to keep it secret from all but two directors, in return for a promise that Scott would stay on as non-executive chairman. However, moments after signing the sale document, Scott was handed a letter (by the Barclays' lawyer) demanding his immediate resignation on grounds that he had been indiscreet about the offer.\\"Dealmaking Barclays accustomed to getting their way\\", articles.chicagotribune.com, 1 February 2004. =Retail= Shop Direct and Littlewoods In 2002, the brothers purchased the Liverpool-based retail company Littlewoods from its founders, the Moores family, for ¬£750 million. The deal was bankrolled by HBOS, which also took a five percent equity stake in the brothers' bidding vehicle, LW Investments. The brothers merged the company with their earlier purchase, Shop Direct, to form Littlewoods Shop Direct Home Shopping Limited, which operates a majority share of the United Kingdom's home shopping market. They also closed and sold off the Littlewoods department store chain, with the largest parcel of 120 properties being purchased by Associated British Foods for leasing mainly to its subsidiary Primark,\\"Primark takes over Littlewood stores\\", Manchester Evening News while other stores were leased to Marks & Spencer, New Look and British Home Stores.\\"Structure of Industry\\" by Robert Paisley , dialspace.dial.pipex.com Two years after the brothers' acquisition of Littlewoods Ltd., HM Revenue and Customs repaid the company VAT that it had charged in breach of EU law.

The European In 1992, the Barclay brothers entered the newspaper publishing industry by buying The European newspaper, formerly part of Robert Maxwell's holdings. The weekly paper became a high-end business tabloid, but closed in 1998. The Scotsman In 1995, they bought The Scotsman newspaper, and in 1996 appointed former Sunday Times editor Andrew Neil to oversee their publishing interests. On 19 December 2005, the Barclays sold The Scotsman Publications Ltd, itself then part of Press Holdings Group, for ¬£160 million to Johnston Press. The Barclays had owned these publications for a decade, and said they intended to use the capital raised on their other interests. During their ownership of The Scotsman, the newspaper had seven editors in nine years (see The Scotsman: Editors). Sunday Business In 1998 they bought and relaunched the Sunday Business newspaper with editor Jeff Randall. It became a weekly magazine The Business in 2006, and was merged into The Spectator in 2008. The Telegraph Media Group In July 2004, the Barclays bought The Telegraph Group (now Telegraph Media Group), which includes The Daily Telegraph, The Sunday Telegraph, and The Spectator after months of intense bidding and lawsuits. The Telegraph Group was owned by Hollinger Inc. of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the newspaper group controlled by the Canadian-born British businessman Conrad Black. As part of a February 2004 judgment, an American judge, Leo Strine, accused the Barclay brothers of being \\"less than fully candid\\", adding they had \\"remained silent while Lord Black misled the Hollinger Inc. International board\\", remarks that incurred the brothers' wrath, with David branding the criticisms \\"grossly unfair\\". The brothers' period as newspaper proprietors has been more tumultuous than their property interests. At the Telegraph Group, Murdoch MacLennan made over 100 journalists redundant in 2006, prompting the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) to consider strike action. The Sunday Telegraph editor Dominic Lawson was sacked and replaced by Sarah Sands in June 2005, but Sands lasted just nine months. Patience Wheatcroft from The Times was appointed editor in March 2006. She was replaced by Ian McGregor one year later. In February 2015, Peter Oborne, the Chief Political Correspondent resigned from the newspaper in protest at its editorial direction. Jason Seiken was made editor-in-chief and chief content officer of Telegraph Media Group in October 2013, but announced his departure after 18 months in April 2015. In October 2019, it was announced that the brothers were seeking to sell the Telegraph group amid speculation that their business interests were in some difficulty. Controversies =Tax exile accusation= The Guardian has stated that the brothers are tax exiles, and although they reside, at least some of the time, in Monaco (giving Avenue de Grande Bretagne, Monte Carlo as their address) they operate their businesses from an office in the United Kingdom. When asked if he was a tax exile, Frederick stated that he lived abroad for health reasons. The corporate tax arrangements of the Ritz Hotel, purchased and refurbished by the brothers in 1995, were the subject of a December 2012 investigation by BBC's Panorama current affairs television programme, which found the hotel had paid no corporation tax in the UK for 17 years, after legally claiming reliefs. =Sark and Brecqhou disputes= The Barclay Brothers' castle, Brecqhou In 1993, the Barclay brothers bought the tenement of the island of Brecqhou, a small sister island of Sark, one of the Channel Islands. Their mock-Gothic castle on Brecqhou, designed by Quinlan Terry, features granite walls, battlements, two swimming pools and a helicopter pad. Since their purchase of the tenement of Brecqhou, the Barclays have been in several legal disputes with the government of Sark over such issues as the Barclays' violation of Sark's law banning motor cars. They have also expressed a desire to make Brecqhou politically independent from Sark ‚Äì building on the research of William Toplis, the painter, and others, who argued that Brecqhou was not a part of the fief of Sark. In the mid-1990s, the brothers petitioned the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, challenging Sark's inheritance law, which mandated their island be left to David's oldest son. The brothers wanted to will their estate equally to their four children. Sark's legislature decided to amend the inheritance law, allowing residents to leave property to any one of their children. In 2002, the brothers claimed their property tax was too high, particularly since they maintained Brecqhou's paths and dock. Fearing more litigation, Sark officials cut the Barclays' tax rate. In 2008 (partially due to legal activity by the Barclay brothers), Sark dismantled its 443-year-old feudal system of government on the premise that this was necessary to comply with the European Convention on Human Rights. On 16 January 2008 and 21 February 2008, the Chief Pleas approved a law which introduced a 30-member chamber, with 28 members elected in Island-wide elections, one hereditary member and one member appointed for life. On 9 April 2008, the Privy Council approved the Sark law reforms, and the first elections under the new law were held in December 2008. On 11 December 2008, the Barclay brothers were in the news for pulling out their investments (which included hotels) from the island of Sark, causing 170 staff to be made redundant, after local voters did not support candidates championed by the Barclay brothers. The brothers had previously warned that if the voters chose to bring back the 'establishment' Sark leaders that are still aligned with the feudal lord then they would pull out of Sark. After the 2008 election, the brothers claimed that the presence of two unelected figures on Sark's government ‚Äì the seigneur and the seneschal, the local judge ‚Äì was unjustifiable. They took their fight to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, arguing that the two roles break human rights laws that protect the rights of citizens to elect lawmakers.\\"Barclay Brothers lose appeal\\", guardian.co.uk, 1 December 2009. Their challenge was dismissed, but the Barclays said they would continue to fight, taking their case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. On 28 March 2012, BBC Radio 4 dedicated part of its Today programme to analysis of the Barclay brothers' role in Sark. It reported that the islanders were protesting against bullying and intimidation by representatives of the Barclays after a story in their local paper had prompted the only doctor to leave the island. The doctor had used a boat rather than the Barclays' helicopter to transport a patient who was having a seizure to hospital on Guernsey, which was reported in the Barclays' paper as negligent. Despite support from the patient's family and the local BMA, the doctor left Sark after the story, leaving the island without a doctor.\\"Sark Spring\\", The New Yorker, 29 October 2012.

As of February 2020, Aidan Barclay, his son Andrew and two brothers face legal action for misuse of private information, breach of confidence and breach of data protection laws.

The combined forces of the Catholic League and the Spanish Empire under Marshal Tilly and Gonzalo de C√≥rdoba defeated the Protestant forces of Georg Friedrich, Margrave of Baden.  Background  = Bohemian revolt = In the Bohemian revolt phase of the Thirty Years' War, the Protestant Bohemian nobility refused to confirm catholic Ferdinand II as their king and had offered count Frederick V of the Palatinate the crown of Bohemia. Frederick was crowned in 1619 but lost the kingdom to Catholic League troops under General Tilly at the Battle of the White Mountain in 1620. Due to disunity among Protestant princes the Protestant Union was forced to declare its neutrality in the conflict in the Treaty of Ulm in 1620 and dissolved the following year. = Palatinate campaign = Count Georg Friedrich, Margrave of Baden had been one of the Protestant Union's generals and maintained the mercenary army he had raised. When General Tilly moved the Catholic League army from Bavaria towards the Palatinate in April 1622 to continue the war against Frederick V, Georg Friedrich declared for Frederick's cause. He marched his army to join General Mansfeld's troops and met with them a few days after their victory against Tilly at the Battle of Mingolsheim on April 27. By early May, the forces of Christian of Brunswick had arrived to the north of the Neckar River and were prepared to assist their fellow Protestants. While Mansfeld crossed the Neckar at Heidelberg to join with Brunswick and besiege the Spanish garrison at Ladenburg,von Reitzenstein, K. Frhr. (1906). Der Feldzug des Jahres 1622 am Oberrhein. ZGO. pp. 271‚Äì95. Georg Friedrich pursued Tilly's army who were retreating east towards the Neckar crossing at Wimpfen. Unknown to the Protestants, a Spanish army under General C√≥rdoba had reinforced Tilly with several thousand men in the meantime. Late on May 5, the Protestant troops, coming from the southwest, crossed a small creek (called B√∂llinger Bach) near the village of and formed up in battle lines.  Battle  On May 6, both sides launched unsuccessful attacks on each other from early morning to about 11 o' clock. Both sides had erected a wagenburg defense, fielded a strong artillery and were cautious on the attack. Tilly held C√≥rdobas troops in reserve at first, fearing an attack by one of the other Protestant armies in the area that wouldn't come. As the Catholic armies began to break, Tilly's elite regiments held their ground, forming into a tight pike formation and scaring away Georg Friedrich's cavalry regiments. There was a lull in fighting until early afternoon when a Catholic assault on Georg-Friedrich's right flank sent his cavalry into flight. At about six o'clock an enemy cannon shot caused an explosion in the Protestant powder magazine, spreading panic in their ranks. Shortly afterwards, their wagenburg fell to Catholic attacks. Many died trying to escape across the B√∂llinger Bach creek.  Aftermath  Count Georg Friedrich was injured in the face and narrowly escaped to Stuttgart, where he abdicated in favour of his eldest son. However, this did not save his family from punishment. His lands were thoroughly devastated by Catholic troops, and in August a substantial part of his domains was awarded to William, Margrave of Baden-Baden of a rival, Catholic branch of House Baden. Until 1771 the margraviate was split into Protestant Baden-Durlach and catholic Baden-Baden. General Tilly continued his campaign and prevailed again at the Battle of H√∂chst in June, then proceeded to subdue the fortified towns of the Electoral Palatinate one by one. In 1623 the Diet of Regensburg awarded Frederick V's lands and seat in the Electoral College to Duke Maximilian of Bavaria, an eminent leader of the Catholic League. From 1623 he styled himself Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria and his duchy Electorate of Bavaria.

It includes providing life support, invasive monitoring techniques, resuscitation, and end-of-life care. Doctors in this specialty are often called intensive care physicians, critical care physicians or intensivists. Intensive care relies on multidisciplinary teams composed of many different health professionals. Such teams often include doctors, nurses, physical therapists, respiratory therapists, and pharmacists, among others. They usually work together in intensive care units (ICUs) within a hospital.  Scope  Patients are admitted to the intensive care unit if their medical needs are greater than what the general hospital ward can provide. Indications for the ICU include blood pressure support for cardiovascular instability (hypertension/hypotension), sepsis, or certain cardiac arrhythmias. Other ICU needs include airway or ventilator support due to respiratory compromise. The cumulative effects of multiple organ failure, more commonly referred to as multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, also requires advanced care. Patients may also be admitted to the ICU for close monitoring or intensive needs following a major surgery. There are two common ICU structures: closed and open. In a closed unit, the intensivist takes on the primary role for all patients in the unit. In an open ICU, the primary physician, who may or may not be an intensivist, can differ for each patient. There is increasingly strong evidence that closed units provide better patient outcomes. Patient management in intensive care differs between countries. Open units are the most common structure in the United States, but closed units are often found at large academic centers. Intermediate structures that fall between open and closed units also exist. = Types of intensive care units = Intensive care is usually provided in a specialized unit of a hospital called the intensive care unit (ICU) or critical care unit (CCU). Many hospitals also have designated intensive care areas for certain specialities of medicine. The naming is not rigidly standardized, and types of units are dictated by the needs and available resources of each hospital. These include: * coronary intensive care unit (CCU or sometimes CICU) for heart disease * medical intensive care unit (MICU) * surgical intensive care unit (SICU) * pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) * neuroscience critical care unit (NCCU) * overnight intensive-recovery (OIR) * shock/trauma intensive-care unit (STICU) * neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) * ICU in the emergency department (E-ICU) Medical studies suggest a relation between ICU volume and quality of care for mechanically ventilated patients. After adjustment for severity of illness, demographic variables, and characteristics of the ICUs (including staffing by intensivists), higher ICU volume was significantly associated with lower ICU and hospital mortality rates. For example, adjusted ICU mortality (for a patient at average predicted risk for ICU death) was 21.2% in hospitals with 87 to 150 mechanically ventilated patients annually, and 14.5% in hospitals with 401 to 617 mechanically ventilated patients annually. Hospitals with intermediate numbers of patients had outcomes between these extremes. ICU delirium, formerly and inaccurately referred to as ICU psychosis, is a syndrome common in intensive care and cardiac units where patients who are in unfamiliar, monotonous surroundings develop symptoms of delirium (Maxmen & Ward, 1995). This may include interpreting machine noises as human voices, seeing walls quiver, or hallucinating that someone is tapping them on the shoulder.Nolen-Hoeksema, Susan. \\"Neurodevelopmental and Neurocognitive Disorders.\\" (Ab)normal Psychology. Sixth ed. New York City: McGraw-Hill Education, 2014. 314. Print. There exists systematic reviews in which interventions of sleep promotion related outcomes in the ICU have proven impactful in the overall health of patients in the ICU.  History  The English nurse Florence Nightingale pioneered efforts to use a separate hospital area for critically injured patients. During the Crimean War in the 1850s, she introduced the practice of moving the sickest patients to the beds directly opposite the nursing station on each ward so that they could be monitored more closely. In 1923, the American neurosurgeon Walter Dandy created a three-bed unit at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. In these units, specially trained nurses cared for critically ill postoperative neurosurgical patients. The Danish anaesthesiologist Bj√∏rn Aage Ibsen became involved in the 1952 poliomyelitis epidemic in Copenhagen, where 2722 patients developed the illness in a six- month period, with 316 of those suffering some form of respiratory or airway paralysis. Some of these patients had been treated using the few available negative pressure ventilators, but these devices (while helpful) were limited in number and did not protect the patient's lungs from aspiration of secretions. Ibsen changed the management directly by instituting long-term positive pressure ventilation using tracheal intubation, and he enlisted 200 medical students to manually pump oxygen and air into the patients' lungs round the clock.Reisner-S√©n√©lar, Louise (2011). \\"The Birth of Intensive Care Medicine: Bj√∂rn Ibsen‚Äôs Records\\" (PDF format).Intensive Care Medicine. Retrieved 2 October 2012. At this time, Carl-Gunnar Engstr√∂m had developed one of the first artificial positive-pressure volume-controlled ventilators, which eventually replaced the medical students. With the change in care, mortality during the epidemic declined from 90% to around 25%. Patients were managed in three special 35-bed areas, which aided charting medications and other management. In 1953, Ibsen set up what became the world's first intensive care unit in a converted student nurse classroom in Copenhagen Municipal Hospital. He provided one of the first accounts of the management of tetanus using neuromuscular-blocking drugs and controlled ventilation. The following year, Ibsen was elected head of the department of anaesthesiology at that institution. He jointly authored the first known account of intensive care management principles in the journal Nordisk Medicin, with Tone Dahl Kvittingen from Norway. For a time in the early 1960s, it was not clear that specialized intensive care units were needed, so intensive care resources were brought to the room of the patient that needed the additional monitoring, care, and resources. It became rapidly evident, however, that a fixed location where intensive care resources and dedicated personnel were available provided better care than ad hoc provision of intensive care services spread throughout a hospital. In 1962, in the University of Pittsburgh, the first critical care residency was established in the United States. In 1970, the Society of Critical Care Medicine was formed.history reference: Brazilian Society of Critical Care SOBRATI Video:ICU History Historical photos  Monitoring  Monitoring refers to various tools and technologies used to obtain information about a patient's condition. These can include tests to evaluate blood flow and gas exchange in the body, or to assess the function of organs such as the heart and lungs. Broadly, there are two common types of monitoring in the ICU: noninvasive and invasive. = Noninvasive monitoring = Noninvasive monitoring does not require puncturing the skin and usually does not cause pain. These tools are more inexpensive, easier to perform, and faster to result. * Vital signs which includes heart rate, blood pressure, breathing rate, body temperature * Echocardiogram to evaluate the function and structure of the heart *Electroencephalography (EEG) to assess electrical activity of the brain *Electrocardiogram to detect abnormal heart rhythms, electrolyte disturbances, and coronary blood flow * Pulse oximetry for monitoring oxygen levels in the blood *Thoracic electric bioimpedance (TEB) cardiography to monitor fluid status and heart function *Ultrasound to evaluate internal structures including the heart, lungs, gallbladder, liver, kidneys, bladder, and blood vessels = Invasive monitoring = Invasive monitoring generally provides more accurate measurements, but these tests may require blood draws, puncturing the skin, and can be painful or uncomfortable. * Arterial line to directly monitor blood pressure and obtain arterial blood gas measurements *Blood draws or venipucture to monitor various blood components as well as administer therapeutic treatments *Intracranial pressure monitoring to assess pressures inside the skull and on the brain *Intravesicular manometry (bladder pressure) measurements to assess for intra-abdominal pressure * Central line and peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) lines for drug infusions, fluids or total parenteral nutrition * Bronchoscopy to look at lungs and airways and sample fluid within the lungs * Pulmonary artery catheter to monitor the function of the heart, blood volume, and tissue oxygenation  Procedures and treatments  Intensive care usually takes a system-by-system approach to treatment. In alphabetical order, the nine key systems considered in the intensive care setting are: cardiovascular system, central nervous system, endocrine system, gastro-intestinal tract (and nutritional condition), hematology, integumentary system, microbiology (including sepsis status), renal (and metabolic), and respiratory system. As such, the nine key systems are each considered on an observation-intervention-impression basis to produce a daily plan. An endotracheal tube = Cardiovascular = *Temporary cardiac pacing catheters for atrial, ventricular, or dual-chamber pacing *Intra-aortic balloon pumping to stabilize patients with cardiogenic shock *Ventricular assist device to aid in the function of the left ventricle, commonly in patients with advanced heart failure = Gastro-intestinal tract = * Feeding tube for artificial nutrition * Nasogastric intubation can be used to deliver artificial nutrition, but can also be used to remove stomach and intestinal contents * Peritoneal aspiration and lavage to sample fluid in the abdominal cavity = Renal = * Hemofiltration for acute kidney injury = Respiratory = * Mechanical ventilation to assist breathing and oxygenation through an endotracheal tube, tracheotomy (invasive) or mask, helmet (non-invasive). * Thoracentesis or tube thoracostomy to remove fluid or air in the pleural cavity = Drugs = A wide array of drugs including but not limited to: inotropes, sedatives, broad spectrum antibiotics and analgesics.  Common complications in the ICU  Intensive care units are associated with increased risk of various complications that may lengthen a patient's hospitalization. Common complications in the ICU include: * Acute renal failure * Catheter- associated blood stream infection * Catheter-associated urinary tract infection * Delirium * Gastrointestinal bleeding * Pressure ulcer * Venous thromboembolism * Ventilator-associated pneumonia * Ventilator-induced barotrauma * Death Training ICU care requires more specialized patient care; this need has led to the use of a multidisciplinary team to provide care for patients. Staffing between Intensive care units by country, hospital, unit, or institution. = Medicine = Critical care medicine is an increasingly important medical specialty. Physicians with training in critical care medicine are referred to as intensivists. Most medical research has demonstrated that ICU care provided by intensivists produces better outcomes and more cost-effective care.\\"Association between Critical Care Physician Management and Patient Mortality in the Intensive Care Unit\\". Annals of Internal Medicine. 3 June 2008. Volume 148, Issue 11. pp. 801‚Äì809. This has led the Leapfrog Group to make a primary recommendation that all ICU patients be managed or co-managed by a dedicated intensivist who is exclusively responsible for patients in one ICU. In Australia In Australia, the training in intensive care medicine is through College of Intensive Care Medicine. In the United Kingdom In the UK, doctors can only enter intensive care medicine training after completing two foundation years and core training in either emergency medicine, anaesthetics, acute medicine or core medicine. Most trainees dual train with one of these specialties; however, it has recently become possible to train purely in intensive care medicine. It has also possible to train in sub-specialties of intensive care medicine including pre-hospital emergency medicine. In the United States In the United States, the specialty requires additional fellowship training for physicians having completed their primary residency training in internal medicine, pediatrics, anesthesiology, surgery or emergency medicine. US board certification in critical care medicine is available through all five specialty boards. Intensivists with a primary training in internal medicine sometimes pursue combined fellowship training in another subspecialty such as pulmonary medicine, cardiology, infectious disease, or nephrology. The American Society of Critical Care Medicine is a well-established multiprofessional society for practitioners working in the ICU including nurses, respiratory therapists, and physicians. Intensive care physicians have some of the highest percentages of physician burnout among all medical specialties, at 48 percent. = Nursing = Nurses that work in the critical care setting are typically registered nurses. Nurses may pursue additional education and training in critical care medicine leading to certification as a CCRN by the American Association of Critical Care Nurses a standard that was begun in 1975. These certifications became more specialized to the patient population in 1997 by the American Association of Critical care Nurses, to include pediatrics, neonatal and adult. = Nurse practitioners and physician assistants = Nurse practitioners and physician assistants are other types of non-physician providers that care for patients in ICUs. These providers have fewer years of in-school training, typically receive further clinical on the job education, and work as part of the team under the supervision of physicians. = Pharmacists = Critical care pharmacists work with the medical team in many aspects but some include, monitoring serum concentrations of medication, past medication use, current medication use, and medication allergies. Their typically round with the team but it may differ by institution. Some pharmacist after attaining their doctorate or pharmacy may pursue additional training in a postgraduate residency and become certified as critical care pharmacists. Pharmacists help manage all aspects of drug therapy and may pursue additional credentialing in critical care medicine as BCCCP by the Board of Pharmaceutical Specialties. Many critical care pharmacists are a part of the multi-professional Society of Critical Care Medicine. Inclusion of pharmacist decreases drug reactions and poor outcomes for patients. = Registered dietitians = Nutrition in intensive care units presents unique challenges due to changes in patient metabolism and physiology while critically ill. Critical care nutrition is rapidly becoming a subspecialty for dieticians who can pursue additional training and achieve certification in enteral and parenteral nutrition through the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN). = Respiratory therapists = Respiratory therapists often work in intensive care units to monitor how well a patient is breathing. Respiratory therapists may pursue additional education and training leading to credentialing in adult critical care (ACCS) and neonatal and pediatric (NPS) specialties. These therapists have been trained to monitor a patient's breathing, provide treatments to help their breathing and evaluate for respiratory improvement. They may be involved in emergency care like managing an airway, humidification of oxygen, administering diagnostic test, invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation management, training patients weaning the ventilator, aerosol therapy, inhaled Nitric oxide therapy, artery blood gas analysis and providing physiotherapy.  Ethical and medicolegal issues  =Economics= In general, it is the most expensive, technologically advanced and resource-intensive area of medical care. In the United States, estimates of the 2000 expenditure for critical care medicine ranged from US$19‚Äì55 billion. During that year, critical care medicine accounted for 0.56% of GDP, 4.2% of national health expenditure and about 13% of hospital costs. In 2011, hospital stays with ICU services accounted for just over one-quarter of all discharges (29.9%) but nearly one-half of aggregate total hospital charges (47.5%) in the United States. The mean hospital charge was 2.5 times higher for discharges with ICU services than for those without.

The story centers on a Harlem jazz club in the 1930s, the Cotton Club and stars Richard Gere, Gregory Hines, Diane Lane, and Lonette McKee. The supporting cast included Bob Hoskins, James Remar, Nicolas Cage, Allen Garfield, Laurence Fishburne, Gwen Verdon and Fred Gwynne. The film was noted for its over-budget production costs, and took a total of five years to make. Critical reception for The Cotton Club was mostly positive; it was nominated for several awards, including Golden Globes for Best Director and Best Picture (Drama) and Oscars for Best Art Direction (Richard Sylbert, George Gaines) and Best Film Editing. Plot A musician named Dixie Dwyer begins working with mobsters to advance his career but falls in love with the girlfriend of gangland kingpin Dutch Schultz. A dancer from Dixie's neighborhood, Sandman Williams, is hired with his brother by The Cotton Club, a jazz club where most of the performers are black and the customers are white. Owney Madden, a mobster, owns the club and runs it with his right-hand man, Frenchy. Dixie becomes a Hollywood film star, thanks to the help of Madden and the mob but angering Schultz. He also continues to see Schultz's gun moll, Vera Cicero, whose new nightclub has been financed by the jealous gangster. In the meantime, Dixie's ambitious younger brother Vincent becomes a gangster in Schultz's mob and eventually a public enemy, holding Frenchy as a hostage. Sandman alienates his brother Clay at The Cotton Club by agreeing to perform a solo number there. While the club's management interferes with Sandman's romantic interest in Lila, a singer, its cruel treatment of the performers leads to an intervention by Harlem criminal 'Bumpy' Rhodes on their behalf. Dutch Schultz is violently dealt with by Madden's men while Dixie and Sandman perform on The Cotton Club's stage.

He hired William Kennedy and Francis Ford Coppola to re-write Mario Puzo's story and screenplay. Evans eventually decided that he did not want to direct the film and asked Coppola at the last minute. Richard Sylbert said that he told Evans not to hire Coppola because \\"he resents being in the commercial, narrative, Hollywood movie business\\". Coppola said that he had letters from Sylbert asking him to work on the film because Evans was crazy. The director also said that \\"Evans set the tone for the level of extravagance long before I got there\\". Coppola accepted the jobs as screenwriter and then director because he needed the money ‚Äì he was deeply in debt from making One from the Heart with his own money. By the time Evans decided not to direct and brought in Coppola, at least $13 million had already been committed. Las Vegas casino owners Edward and Fred Doumani put $30 million into the film. Other financial backers included Arab arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi, and vaudeville promoter Roy Radin, who was murdered in May 1983 by a drug dealer associate who felt she was cut out of profits from the film. According to William Kennedy in an interview with Vanity Fair, the budget of the film was $47 million. However, Coppola told the head of Gaumont Film Company, Europe's largest distribution and production company, that he thought the film might cost $65 million. According to Splitsider, Richard Pryor was considered for the role of Sandman Williams. Robert Evans wanted to cast his friend Alain Delon in a two-scene role as Lucky Luciano but this did not occur. The role of Luciano was instead portrayed by Joe Dallesandro, starting the dramatic film career for the former Warhol Superstar. Author Mario Puzo was the original screenwriter and was eventually replaced by William Kennedy, who wrote a rehearsal script in eight days which the cast used for three weeks prior to shooting. According to actor Gregory Hines, a three-hour film was shot during rehearsals. Over 600 people built sets, created costumes and arranged music at a reported $250,000 a day. From July 15 to August 22, 1983, twelve scripts were produced, including five during one 48-hour non-stop weekend. Kennedy estimates that between 30‚Äì40 scripts were turned out. On June 7, 1984, Victor L. Sayyah filed a lawsuit against the Doumani brothers, their lawyer David Hurwitz, Evans and Orion Pictures for fraud and breach of contract. Sayyah invested $5 million and said that he had little chance of recouping his money because the budget escalated from $25 to $58 million. He accused the Doumanis of forcing out Evans and said that an Orion loan to the film of $15 million unnecessarily increased the budget. Evans, in turn, sued Edward Doumani to keep from acting as general partner on the film. Soundtrack The soundtrack for the film was written by John Barry. It released on December 14, 1984, via Geffen Records. The album won the Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance, Big Band in 1986. Release The Cotton Club was released on December 14, 1984 in the United States and Canada on 808 screens and grossed $2.9 million on its opening weekend, fifth place behind Beverly Hills Cop, Dune, City Heat and 2010. Evans took the blame for hiring Coppola while the director responded that if he had not been hired, the film would have never been made. Evans said that Coppola made the budget escalate dramatically by rejecting the script, hiring his own crew, and falling behind schedule. The film was a commercial failure, grossing just under $26 million against a $58 million budget. =Home media= Embassy Home Entertainment paid a record $4.7 million for North America home video rights. The film appeared on videotape and videodisc in April 1985. It was the first to use the Macrovision copy protection system, on VHS and Betamax only. Reception , the film holds a 76% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 29 reviews. The site's consensus states: \\"Energetic and brimming with memorable performers, The Cotton Club entertains with its visual and musical pizazz even as its plot only garners polite applause.\\" The film appeared on both Siskel and Ebert's best of 1984. Diane Lane was nominated for the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress category (also for her work in Streets of Fire), ultimately losing to Lynn-Holly Johnson for Where the Boys Are '84. Director's cut In 2015, Coppola found an old Betamax video copy of his original cut that ran 25 minutes longer. When originally editing the picture, he acquiesced to distributors who wanted a shorter film with a different structure. Between 2015 and 2017, Coppola spent over $500,000 of his own money to restore the film to the original cut. This version, titled The Cotton Club: Encore and running 139 minutes, debuted at the Telluride Film Festival on September 1, 2017. Lionsgate (owner of the Zoetrope Corporation backlog, and working in association with original studio Orion Pictures) released that version theatrically, and on DVD and Blu-ray in the fall of 2019. The Film Stage gave The Cotton Club: Encore a rating of A-, while Rolling Stone described the result of this version as 'eye-opening'.NYFF Review: With 'The Cotton Club Encore', Francis Ford Coppola Brings Grandeur to New Reworking‚ÄòThe Cotton Club‚Äô: Francis Ford Coppola's Mangled Epic Gets an Encore Rolling Stone References Further reading * External links  * Roger Ebert review 1984 films 1980s musical films 1984 crime drama films American films American crime drama films English-language films Films about race and ethnicity Films about the Irish Mob Jazz films Films directed by Francis Ford Coppola Films with screenplays by Francis Ford Coppola Films scored by John Barry (composer) American Zoetrope films Orion Pictures films StudioCanal films Films set in New York City Films set in Harlem Films set in the 1930s Films produced by Robert Evans Films about the American Mafia Films about African-American organized crime Films about Jewish-American organized crime Cultural depictions of Lucky Luciano Cultural depictions of Dutch Schultz Cultural depictions of Cab Calloway 1984 drama films ","title":"The Cotton Club (film)"},{"id":"299017","title":"U.S. Chess Championship"},{"id":"299018","text":"ICU commonly refers to: *Intensive care unit, a special department of a hospital ICU may also refer to: Organisations =Universities= *Information and Communications University, South Korea *Istanbul Commerce University, Istanbul, Turkey *International Christian University, Mitaka, Tokyo, Japan *International Christian University ‚Äì Kyiv, Ukraine *Imperial College Union, the students' union of Imperial College London =Politics= *Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union, a South African political group from the 1920s *Industrial and Commercial Workers' Union (Ghana), a general union in Ghana *Internationalist Communist Union, an international grouping of Trotskyist political parties *Islamic Courts Union, a rival administration in Somalia =Other organisations= *ICU Medical, an American company *International Cheer Union, the worldwide governing body of cheerleading *Investment Capital Ukraine, a Kyiv-based financial group *International Clearing Union, a 1944 currency exchange regulatory institution proposal Other uses *I.C.U.

Aztecah is the Nahuatl word for \\"people from Aztlan\\". Aztlan is mentioned in several ethnohistorical sources dating from the colonial period, and each of them give different lists of the different tribal groups who participated in the migration from Aztlan to central Mexico, but the Mexica who went on to found Mexico-Tenochtitlan are mentioned in all of the accounts. Historians have speculated about the possible location of Aztlan and tend to place it either in northwestern Mexico or the southwest US, although there are doubts about whether the place is purely mythical or represents a historical reality. Legend Nahuatl legends relate that seven tribes lived in Chicomoztoc, or \\"the place of the seven caves\\". Each cave represented a different Nahua group: the Xochimilca, Tlahuica, Acolhua, Tlaxcalteca, Tepaneca, Chalca, and Aztec. Because of their common linguistic origin, those groups are called collectively \\"Nahualteca\\" (Nahua people). These tribes subsequently left the caves and settled \\"near\\" Aztl√°n. The various descriptions of Aztl√°n apparently contradict each other. While some legends describe Aztl√°n as a paradise, the Codex Aubin says that the Aztecs were subject to a tyrannical elite called the Azteca Chicomoztoca. Guided by their priest, the Aztec fled. On the road, their god Huitzilopochtli forbade them to call themselves Azteca, telling them that they should be known as Mexica. Scholars of the 19th century‚Äîin particular Alexander von Humboldt and William H. Prescott‚Äîtranslated the word Azteca, as is shown in the Aubin Codex to Aztec. Some sayAnales de Tlatelolco, Rafael Tena INAH-CONACULTA 2004 p 55 that the southward migration began on May 24, 1064 CE, after the Crab Nebula events from May to July 1054. Each of the seven groups is credited with founding a different major city-state in Central Mexico. A 2004 translation of the Anales de Tlatelolco gives the only date known related to the exit from Aztlan; day-sign \\"4 Cuauhtli\\" (Four Eagle) of the year \\"1 Tecpatl\\" (Knife) or 1064‚Äì1065, and correlated to January 4, 1065. Cristobal del Castillo mentions in his book \\"Fragmentos de la Obra General Sobre Historia de los Mexicanos\\", that the lake around the Aztlan island was called Metztliapan or \\"Lake of the moon.\\" Fragmentos de la Obra General Sobre Historia de los Mexicanos, Cristobal del Castillo pages 58‚Äì83 Another version reads: > One day a man heard a bird calling to him, saying, ‚ÄúGo now, go now.‚Äù When > the man told the chief about the bird, the chief was relieved. He had known > his people must find a new land, their own land, but had waited for a sign. > So the people gathered and began a long march.

Places postulated as Aztl√°n Depiction of the departure from Aztl√°n as an island in the 16th-century Codex Boturini. Aztl√°n is also depicted as an island in the Aubin and Azcatitlan codices. Friar Diego Dur√°n (c. 1537‚Äì1588), who chronicled the history of the Aztecs, wrote of Aztec emperor Moctezuma I's attempt to recover the history of the Mexica by congregating warriors and wise men on an expedition to locate Aztl√°n. According to Dur√°n, the expedition was successful in finding a place that offered characteristics unique to Aztl√°n. However, his accounts were written shortly after the conquest of Tenochtitlan and before an accurate mapping of the American continent was made; therefore, he was unable to provide a precise location.Manuel Aguilar-Moreno Handbook to Life in the Aztec World. page 29. During the 1960s, Mexican intellectuals began to seriously speculate about the possibility that Mexcaltit√°n de Uribe was the mythical city of Aztl√°n. One of the first to consider Aztl√°n being linked to the Nayaritian island was historian Alfredo Chavero towards the end of the 19th century. Historical investigators after his death tested his proposition and considered it valid, among them Wigberto Jim√©nez Moreno. This hypothesis is still up for debate. Etymology The meaning of the name Aztlan is uncertain. One suggested meaning is \\"place of Herons\\" or \\"place of egrets\\"‚Äîthe explanation given in the Cr√≥nica Mexic√°yotl‚Äîbut this is not possible under Nahuatl morphology: \\"place of egrets\\" is Aztatlan.Andrews (2003, p.496) Other proposed derivations include \\"place of whiteness\\" and \\"at the place in the vicinity of tools\\", sharing the ƒÅz- element of words such as teponƒÅztli, \\"drum\\" (from tepontli, \\"log\\").Andrews (2003, p. 616) Use by the Chicano movement Territories considered for \\"Aztl√°n\\" The concept of Aztl√°n as the place of origin of the pre-Columbian Mexican civilization has become a symbol for various Mexican nationalist and indigenous movements. In 1969 the notion of Aztlan was introduced by the poet Alurista (Aberto Baltazar Urista Heredia) at the National Chicano Youth Liberation Conference held in Denver, Colorado by the Crusade for Justice. There he read a poem, which has come to be known as the preamble to El Plan de Aztlan or as \\"El Plan Espiritual de Aztlan\\" due to its poetic aesthetic. For some Chicanos, Aztlan refers to the Mexican territories annexed by the United States as a result of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War of 1846‚Äì1848. Aztl√°n became a symbol for mestizo activists who believe they have a legal and primordial right to the land. In order to exercise this right, some members of the Chicano movement propose that a new nation be created, a Rep√∫blica del Norte.Professor Predicts 'Hispanic Homeland' , Associated Press (reprinted by Aztlan.net), 2000 Aztl√°n is also the name of the Chicano studies journal published out of the UCLA Chicano Studies Research Center. =Movements that use or formerly used the concept of Aztl√°n= *Brown Berets *MEChA (Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztl√°n, \\"Chicano Student Movement of Aztl√°n\\") *Plan Espiritual de Aztl√°n *Raza Unida Party *Freedom Road Socialist Organization, which calls for self- determination for the Chicano nation in Aztlan up to and including the right to secession. In popular culture =In literature= \\"Aztl√°n\\" has been used as the name of speculative fictional future states that emerge in the southwest U.S. or Mexico after the central U.S. government suffers collapse or major setback; examples appear in such works as the novels Heart of Aztl√°n (1976), by Rudolfo Anaya; Warday (1984), by Whitley Strieber and James Kunetka; The Peace War (1984), by Vernor Vinge; The House of the Scorpion (2002), by Nancy Farmer; and World War Z (2006), by Max Brooks; as well as the role-playing game Shadowrun, in which the Mexican government was usurped by the Aztechnology Corporation (1989). In Gary Jennings' novel Aztec (1980), the protagonist resides in Aztl√°n for a while, later facilitating contact between Aztl√°n and the Aztec Triple Alliance just before Hern√°n Cort√©s' arrival.

The strait is considered the most important natural passage between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. It was discovered and first traversed by the Spanish expedition of Ferdinand Magellan in 1520, after whom it is named. Magellan's original name for the strait was Estrecho de Todos los Santos (\\"Strait of All Saints\\"). Spanish King Charles V, the sponsor of the Magellan-Elcano expedition, changed the name to Strait of Magellan to honor him. The route is difficult to navigate due to frequent narrows and unpredictable winds and currents. Maritime piloting is now compulsory. The strait is shorter and more sheltered than the Drake Passage, the often stormy open sea route around Cape Horn, which is beset by frequent gale-force winds and icebergs. Along with the Beagle Channel, the strait was one of the few sea routes between the Atlantic and Pacific before the construction of the Panama Canal. History =Pre- history= The Strait of Magellan has been inhabited by indigenous Americans for thousands of years. The Kaw√©sqar lived on the western part of the strait's northern coast. To the east of the Kaw√©sqar were the Tehuelche, whose territory extended to the north in Patagonia. To the south of the Tehuelche across the strait lived the Selk'nam, who inhabited the majority of the eastern portion of Tierra del Fuego. To the west of the Selk'nam were the Yaghan people, who inhabited the southernmost part of Tierra del Fuego. All tribes in the area were nomadic hunter-gatherers. The Tehuelche were the only non-maritime culture in the area; they fished and gathered shellfish along the coast during the winter and moved into the southern Andes in the summer to hunt. The tribes of the region saw little European contact until the late 19th century. Later, European-introduced diseases decimated portions of the indigenous population. =Discovery by Europeans= Magellan Victoria, one of Magellan's ships, in the Museo Nao Victoria, Punta Arenas, Chile Expeditionaries led by Ferdinand Magellan, an explorer and navigator in the service of Spanish King Charles V, became the first Europeans to navigate the strait in 1520 in what later became the first voyage of global circumnavigation. On March 22, 1518, the expedition was organized in Valladolid, naming Magellan captain general of the fleet and governor of all the lands discovered. The fleet would become known as the Armada de Molucas or \\"Fleet of the Moluccas\\". The expeditionary fleet of five ships set sail from Sanl√∫car de Barrameda in southern Spain on September 20, 1519. The five ships included La Trinidad (110 tons, 55 crew members), under the command of Magellan; La San Antonio (120 tons, 60 crew members) under the command of Juan de Cartagena; La Concepci√≥n (90 tons, 45 crew members) under the command of Gaspar de Quezada (Juan Sebasti√°n Elcano served as boatswain); La Victoria (85 tons, 42 crew members) under the command of Luis de Mendoza; and La Santiago (75 tons, 32 crew members), under command of Juan Rodr√≠guez Serrano (Jo√£o Rodrigues Serr√£o). Before the passage of the strait (and after the mutiny in Puerto San Juli√°n), √Ålvaro de Mesquita became captain of the San Antonio, and Duarte Barbosa of the Victoria. Later, Serr√£o became captain of the Concepcion (the Santiago, sent on a mission to find the passage, was caught in a storm and wrecked). San Antonio, charged to explore Magdalen Sound, failed to return to the fleet, instead sailing back to Spain under Est√™v√£o Gomes, who imprisoned the captain Mesquita. Magellan's ships entered the strait on November 1, 1520, All Saints' Day. It was initially called Estrecho de Todos los Santos (\\"Strait of All Saints\\"). Magellan's chronicler, Antonio Pigafetta, called it the Patagonian Strait, and others Victoria Strait, commemorating the first ship that entered. Within seven years, it was being called Estrecho de Magallanes in honor of Magellan. The Spanish Empire and the Captaincy General of Chile used it as the southern boundary of their territory. On All Saints' Day, Magellan planted a flag and claimed the land on behalf of the King of Spain. Accounts before Magellan There is no historical evidence of the knowledge of the strait prior to the Spanish expedition of Ferdinand Magellan . In 1563, Ant√≥nio Galv√£o reported that the position of the strait was previously mentioned in old charts as Dragon's Tail (Draco Cola): Although this would suggest that the strait was mentioned in maps before the Americas were discovered by Europeans, the claim has been considered dubious. =16th century explorations after Magellan= View of the capitulaciones granted by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor in 1534 In the 1530s Charles V divided South America and whatever was to be south of it into a series of grants to different conquistadors. The strait of Magellan and the area south of it went to Pedro S√°nchez de la Hoz. While in a temporary visit to Europe conquistador of Chile Pedro de Valdivia managed to have Charles V extend his governorship all the way to the northern shores of the strait. Meanwhile, S√°nchez de la Hoz was executed in Chile by Francisco de Villagra, one of Valdivia's men. Garc√≠a Jofr√© de Loaiza was the second captain to navigate the strait and the first to discover that Tierra del Fuego was an island. Thereafter, Governor of Chile Pedro de Valdivia dispatched Francisco de Ulloa to survey and explore the strait, thereby facilitating navigation from Spain to Chile. In October 1553, Ulloa sailed from the city of Valdivia in the first expedition to enter the strait from the west. After reaching Woods Bay, Ulloa recognized the steep coastline and lack of provisions. Fearing entrapment in the strait during the winter, Ulloa turned around, returning to Chilean ports in February 1554. In October 1557, Governor of Chile Garc√≠a Hurtado de Mendoza sent out another exploratory squad of 70 men under the command of Juan Ladrillero. They were charged with mapping the coastline and surveying the region's flora, fauna, and ethnography. On August 16, 1558, Ladrillero arrived in the Atlantic Ocean, becoming the first navigator to cross the Strait of Magellan in both directions. Twenty years later, English navigator Francis Drake crossed the strait, creating fear among Pacific coast inhabitants that an attack was imminent. In order to seal the passage, Viceroy of Peru Francisco de Toledo sent a squadron with two ships under Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa. They scrupulously explored the strait, trying to ferret out English invaders, while surveying where to build fortifications. This data was concealed, but new explorations to the area were still organized. In 1599 it took five ships under Simon de Cordes - his pilot was William Adams - four months to pass it; Sebalt de Weert returned before the end. The first map of the Pacific Ocean, Maris Pacifici from 1589, depicts the strait as the only route between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Spanish colonisation attempt Gradual southward colonization by the Spanish in Chile halted after the conquest of Chilo√© Archipelago in 1567. The Spanish are thought to have lacked incentives for further conquests south. The indigenous populations were scarce and had ways of life that differed from the sedentary agricultural life the Spanish were accostumed to. The harsh climate in the fjords and channels of Patagonia may also have deterred further expansion. Indeed, even in Chilo√© did the Spanish encounter difficulties to adapt as their attempts to base the economy on gold extraction and a \\"hispanic-mediterranean\\" agricultural model failed.Torrej√≥n, Fernando; Cisternas, Marco; Alvial, Ingrid and Torres, Laura. 2011. Consecuencias de la tala maderera colonial en los bosques de alece de Chilo√©, sur de Chile (Siglos XVI-XIX)*. Magallania. Vol. 39(2):75‚Äì95. In 1584, Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa founded two colonies in the strait: Nombre de Jes√∫s and Ciudad del Rey Don Felipe. The latter was established north of the strait with 300 settlers. That winter, it became known as Puerto del Hambre, or \\"Port Famine\\"‚Äîmost of the settlers were killed by cold or starvation. When Sir Thomas Cavendish landed at the site of Rey Don Felipe in 1587, he found only ruins of the settlement. He renamed it Port Famine. The Spanish failure at colonizing the Strait of Magellan made Chilo√© Archipelago assume the role of protecting western Patagonia from foreign intrusions. Valdivia, reestablished in 1645, and Chilo√© acted as sentries, being hubs where the Spanish collected information and rumors from all over Patagonia. =17th century explorations= In 1616, Dutch travelers, including Willem Schouten and Jacob Le Maire, discovered Cape Horn and recognized the southern end of Tierra del Fuego. Years later, a Spanish expedition commanded by brothers Bartolom√© and Gonzalo Nodal verified this discovery making in the way also the first circumnavigation of Tierra del Fuego. After this there would be 150 years before the next ship from Spain would traverse the strait. In 1620, one hundred years after European discovery, at least 55 ships had traversed the strait including 23 Spanish, 17 English and 15 Dutch. John Narborough's 1670 explorations in Patagonia caused the Spanish to launch various maritime expeditions to western Patagonia from 1674 to 1676. In the last and largest one, Pascual de Iriate led a party to Evangelistas Islets at the western entrance to the strait. At Evangelistas sixteen men of the party disappeared on February 17 including the son of Pascual de Iriarte.de Vea 1886, p. 587de Vea 1886, p. 590 The ill-fated men had attempted to reach one of the islets to install a metal plaque indicating the King of Spain's ownership of the territory. Viceroy of Peru Baltasar de la Cueva issued orders to the governments of Chile, Chilo√© and R√≠o de la Plata to inquire about the men who disappeared at Evangelistas Islets.Barros Arana 1884, p. 120 However no information about their fate came forth and it is presumed that the boat wrecked in the same storm that forced the remaining party to leave the area.Barros Arana 1884, p. 119 Overall a total of 16‚Äì17 men perished in it. While by 1676 rumours about English bases in Western Patagonia had been dispelled that year new rumours appeared claiming that England was preparing an expedition to settle the Straits of Magellan. The focus of Spanish attention to repel tentative English settlements shifted from the Pacific coast of Patagonia to the Straits of Magellan and Tierra del Fuego. Such a change, from the western archipelagoes to the strait, meant that any English settlement could be approached by Spain by land from the north, which was not the case for the islands in western Patagonia. In February 1696, the first French expedition under the command of M. de Gennes reached the Strait of Magellan. The expedition is described by the French explorer, engineer, and hydrographer in his A Relation of a Voyage (1699). =18th century explorations= In the 18th century further explorations were done by English explorers John Byron and James Cook. The French sent Louis Antoine de Bougainville and JSC Dumont D'Urville. By 1770 the focus of a potential conflict between Spain and Britain had shifted from the strait to Falkland Islands. = 19th century = Explorations From 1826 to 1830, the strait was explored and thoroughly charted by Phillip Parker King, who commanded the British survey vessel HMS Adventure. In consort with HMS Beagle, King surveyed the complex coasts around the strait. A report on the survey was presented at two meetings of the Geographical Society of London in 1831.. ‚Äì p. 563 : Some Observations relating to the Southern Extremity of South America, Tierra del Fuego, and the Strait of Magalhaens; made during the Survey of those Coasts in his Majesty's ships Adventure and Beagle, between the years 1826 and 1830.

Edited by Leslie Stephen and Sidney Lee. 63 vols. and 2 supplements (6 vols.). London: Smith, Elder & Co. 1885--1912 The naturalist on the voyage was Robert Oliver Cunningham. Charles Darwin requested the Lords of the Admiralty to ask Mayne to collect several boatloads of fossils of extinct quadruped species. Admiral Sulivan had previously discovered an astonishingly rich accumulation of fossil bones not far from the strait. These remains apparently belonged to a more ancient period than collections made by Darwin on HMS Beagle and other naturalists, and therefore were of great scientific interest. Many of these fossils were collected with the aid of hydrographer Richards R. N. and deposited in the British Museum.Letter from B.J. Sulivan, 27 June 1866 and nn. 6 and 7 in the Darwin Letters. See:, The Admiralty compiled advice to mariners of the strait in 1871. Incorporation into Chile Chile took possession of the Strait of Magellan on May 23, 1843. President Manuel Bulnes ordered this expedition after consulting the Chilean libertador Bernardo O'Higgins, who feared an occupation by Great Britain or France. The first Chilean settlement, Fuerte Bulnes, was situated in a forested zone on the north side of the strait, and was later abandoned. In 1848, Punta Arenas was founded farther north, where the Magellanic forests meet the Patagonian plains. In Tierra del Fuego, across the strait from Punta Arenas, the village of Porvenir emerged during the Tierra del Fuego gold rush in the late 19th century. Until the opening of the Panama Canal, the town was an important supply stop for mariners. It has been claimed that Chile's annexation of the area originated from a fear of occupation by Great Britain or France. In the Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina, Argentina effectively recognized Chilean sovereignty over the Strait of Magellan. Argentina had previously claimed all of the strait, or at least the eastern third of it. In the Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina the conflicts between two countries were settled and Argentina ratified the strait as Chilean. Steamship navigation In 1840, the Pacific Steam Navigation Company became the first to use steamships for commercial traffic in the strait. Until the Panama Canal opened in 1914, the Strait of Magellan was the main route for steamships traveling from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific. It was often considered the only safe way to move between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as the Drake Passage separating Cape Horn from Antarctica is notorious for turbulent and unpredictable weather, and is frequented by icebergs and sea ice. Ships in the strait, protected by Tierra del Fuego to the south and the coast of continental South America to the north, crossed with relative ease, and Punta Arenas became a primary refueling port that provided coal for steamships in transit. Sailing ships, partly because of variable winds and currents in the strait, generally preferred the Drake Passage, where they had more room to maneuver. Features Map showing the extent of the Patagonian Ice Sheet in the Strait of Magellan area during the Last Glacial Period. Selected modern settlements are shown with yellow dots. The strait is approximately long and wide at its narrowest point (Carlos III Island, west of Cape Froward). The northwestern portion of the strait is connected with other sheltered waterways via the Smyth Channel. This area is similar to the Inside Passage of Alaska. South of Cape Froward, the principal shipping route follows the Magdalena Channel. The climate is generally foggy and cold, and the course is convoluted with several narrow passages. It is several hundred miles shorter than the Drake Passage, but sailing ships, particularly clipper ships, prefer the latter. Its major port is Punta Arenas, a transshipment point for Chilean mutton situated on the Brunswick Peninsula. Exemplifying the difficulty of the passage, it took Magellan 38 days to complete the crossing. The eastern opening is a wide bay on the border of Chile and Argentina between Punta D√∫ngeness on the mainland and Cabo del Esp√≠ritu Santo (\\"Cape of the Holy Spirit\\") on Tierra del Fuego, the border as defined in the Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1984 between Chile and Argentina. Immediately west are Primera Angostura and Segunda Angostura, narrows formed by two terminal moraines of different ages. The Primera Angostura is the closest approach of Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego to mainland South America. Farther west lies Magdalena Island, part of Los Ping√ºinos Natural Monument. The strait's southern boundary in the east follows first the shoreline of the Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego, then the northern end of the Canal Whiteside and the shoreline of Dawson Island. The western part of the strait leads northwest from the northern end of the Magdalena Channel to the strait's Pacific entrance. This is flanked on the south by Capit√°n Aracena Island, Clarence Island, Santa In√©s Island, Desolaci√≥n Island (Cabo Pilar), and other smaller islands, and on the north by Brunswick Peninsula, Riesco Island, Mu√±oz Gamero Peninsula, Manuel Rodriguez Island, and other minor islands of the Queen Adelaide Archipelago. Two narrow channels connect the strait with Seno Otway and Seno Skyring. A broader channel, Smyth Channel, leads north from the strait between Mu√±oz Gamero Peninsula and Manuel Rodriguez Island. Francisco Coloane Coastal and Marine Protected Area, a sanctuary for humpback whales, is located in this area. This part of the strait lies on the elongated Magallanes-Fagnano Fault, which marks a plate boundary between the South American Plate and the Scotia Plate. This fault continues southward under Almirantazgo Fjord and then below Fagnano Lake. Possibly, new tourism industries could be established in the eastern part of the strait for watching southern right whales, as the number of observations in the area has increased in recent years.The Patagon Journal. 2009. Southern Right Whale Spotted in Chilean Waters . Retrieved on October 16, 2014 On the Atlantic side, the strait is characterized by semidiurnal macrotides with mean and spring tide ranges of 7.1 and 9.0 m, respectively. On the Pacific side, tides are mixed and mainly semidiurnal, with mean and spring tide ranges of 1.1 and 1.2 m, respectively. There is enormous tidal energy potential in the strait. The strait is prone to Williwaws, \\"a sudden violent, cold, katabatic gust of wind descending from a mountainous coast of high latitudes to the sea\\". Place names The place names of the area around the strait come from a variety of languages. Many are from Spanish and English, and several are from the Ona language, adapted to Spanish phonology and spelling. Examples include Timaukel (a hamlet at the east side of Tierra del Fuego), Carukinka (the end of the Almirantazgo Fjord), Anika (a channel located at 54¬∞ 7' S and 70¬∞ 30' W), and Arska (the north side of the Dawson Island). Magellan named the strait Todos los Santos, as he began his voyage through the strait on November 1, 1520, the day of \\"All Saints\\" (Todos los Santos in Spanish). Charles V renamed it Estrecho de Magallanes. Magellan named the island on the south side of the strait Tierra del Fuego, which the Yaghan people called Onais√≠n in the Yaghan language. Magellan also gave the name Patagones to the mainland Indians, and their land was subsequently known as Patagonia. Bah√≠a Cordes is named for the Dutch pirate Baltazar de Cordes. The Strait of Magellan Park, south of Punta Arenas, is a protected area. Lighthouses in the strait County of Peebles and Cavenga are used as a breakwater for the harbour at Punta Arenas. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency lists 41 lighthouses in the waterway. Some of them are more than a century old, and some are declared Monumento Nacional (\\"national monument\\"). Among the most notable lighthouses are: County of Peebles hulk, the world's first four- masted, iron-hulled \\"full-rig ship\\", used now as a breakwater for the harbour at Punta Arenas; the San Isidro lighthouse, restored in 2004 and is now a museum and lodge; and the Evangelistas Lighthouse, located at the western mouth of the strait and built by George Slight, who wrote on his arrival in 1934: This strait is one of the region's most popular tourist destinations. Several cruise companies ply its waters, and the lighthouses, including Magdalena Island Light, are popular attractions. Environment Numerous protected systems are located around the strait (S.P.: Sistema Protegido; B.N.P: Bienes Nacionales Protegidos):Mapas ambientales de Ministerio de Obras P√∫blicas , retrieved on 26 August 2013 * B.N.P.

Timaukel Traffic Punta Arenas in winter The strait provides a well-protected inland waterway sheltered from rough weather and high seas, allowing for safe navigation. Ships sail through the strait from the Pacific to the Atlantic and back, from the oceans to the Beagle Channel through the Magdalena Channel, Cockburn Channel, Paso Brecknock or Canal Ocasi√≥n, Ballenero Channel, O'Brien Channel, Paso Timbales, northwest arm of the Beagle Channel and the Beagle Channel and back, and also to cross the strait from north to south and back. This is the case for all traffic between the Chile and Argentina and the cities in Tierra del Fuego, Porvenir, Cerro Sombrero, Timaukel, Ushuaia, and R√≠o Grande. In 2008, 571 Chilean ships and 1,681 non-Chilean ships sailed through the strait. Piloting is compulsory for sailing the strait. As one authority notes, \\"The Pilotage Regulations of the Chilean Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service ('the Regulations\\") provide that pilotage through the Magellan Strait is compulsory\\", with limited exceptions for local traffic. Who pays the fees for the pilot is subject to interpretation, however. Navigation status Article 35 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea states that \\"Nothing in this Part affects: ... the legal regime in straits in which passage is regulated in whole or in part by long-standing international conventions in force specifically relating to such straits\\". Article V of the Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina established a legal regime for the Strait of Magellan, and in a diplomatic letter to major shipping nations in 1873, Chile promised freedom of navigation through and neutrality within the strait.See also Chilean note to the Notable events Joshua Slocum was the first documented person to have single-handedly sailed the strait. He experienced a 40-day hiatus in the strait due to storms and adverse weather, while piloting the gaff-rigged sloop oyster boat Spray in the first solo global circumnavigation. He wrote about the experience in Sailing Alone Around the World. In 1976, American open water swimmer Lynn Cox became the first person to swim across the strait. Almost 40 years later, on January 17, 2014, Hunter Wright became the youngest person to swim across the strait at age 17.

The \\"platform\\" (ÊñΩÊ≥ïÂ£á) refers to the podium on which a Buddhist teacher speaks. Its key themes are the direct perception of one's true nature, and the unity in essence of ≈õƒ´la (conduct), dhyƒÅna (meditation) and praj√±ƒÅ (wisdom). The text centers on teachings and stories ascribed to the sixth Chan patriarch Huineng. It contains the well-known story of the contest for the succession of Hongren (enlightenment by the non-abiding), and discourses and dialogues attributed to Huineng. The text attributes its recollection to Fa-hai, but was probably written within the so-called Oxhead school, which existed along with the East Mountain School and Shenhui's Southern School. The text attempts to reconcile the so-called Northern School with its alleged gradual enlightenment teachings, and the so-called Southern School with its alleged sudden enlightenment teachings. In effect, the text incorporates the \\"rhetorical purity\\" which originated with Shenhui's attack on Shenxiu, while effectively \\"writing him out of the story\\".  History of the text  The Platform Sutra underwent various redactions. Though its recollection has been attributed to Fa-hai, a student of Huineng, its origins are not clear: The Dunhuang versions are the oldest texts available, with the full title Southern School's Sudden Doctrine, Supreme Mahayana Great Perfection of Wisdom: The Platform Sutra as Delivered by the Sixth Patriarch Huineng at the Dafan Temple in Shao Prefecture , subtitled, ‚Äúone roll, recorded by the spreader of the Dharma, the disciple Fahai, who at the same time received the Precepts of Formlessness‚Äù (‰∏ÄÂç∑ÔºåÂÖºÂèóÁÑ°Áõ∏ÊàíÂºòÊ≥ïÂºüÂ≠êÊ≥ïÊµ∑ÈõÜË®ò). Two copies dated to between 830 and 860 have been found in the Mogao Caves in Dunhuang. Both are thought to be based on an edition from about 780. The finds at Dunhuang have been very important for the historical understanding of Zen: In 1056, the Chinese scholar-monk Qisong (Â•ëÂµ©, Wade- Giles: Ch'i-sung) produced a larger edition, entitled Liuzu fabao ji (Ê≥ïÂØ∂Ë®ò ‚ÄòPrecious Record of the Dharma‚Äô). In 1291, Zongbao (ÂÆóÂØ∂, Wade-Giles: Tsung-pao) produced the edition that became part of the Ming Dynasty Chinese Buddhist canon. This canonical version, apparently based on the Qisong edition, is about a third longer than the Mogao Caves version, and structured differently. Contents The Platform Sutra is: =Chapter One - Personal History= Chapter One contains the well-known story of the contest for the succession of Hongren. It is an essential part of the Traditional Zen Narrative. The Fifth Patriarch summoned all his followers and proposed a poem contest for his followers to demonstrate the stage of their understanding of the essence of mind. He decided to pass down his robe and teachings to the winner of the contest, who would become the Sixth Patriarch. Shenxiu, the leading disciple of the Fifth Patriarch, composed a stanza, but did not have the courage to present it to the master. Instead, he wrote his stanza on the south corridor wall to remain anonymous one day at midnight. The other monks saw the stanza and commended it. Shenxiu's stanza is as follows: The Patriarch was not satisfied with Shenxiu's stanza, and pointed out that the poem did not show understanding of \\"[his] own fundamental nature and essence of mind.\\" He gave Shenxiu a chance to submit another poem to demonstrate that he had entered the \\"gate of enlightenment,\\" so that he could transmit his robe and the Dharma to Shenxiu, but the student's mind was agitated and could not write one more stanza. Two days later, the illiterate Huineng heard Shenxiu's stanza being chanted by a young attendant at the monastery and inquired about the context of the poem. The attendant explained to him the poem contest and the transmission of the robe and Dharma. Huineng asked to be led to the corridor, where he could also pay homage to the stanza. He asked a low-ranking official named Zhang Riyong from Jiangzhou to read the verse to him, and then immediately asked him to write down a stanza that he composed. According to McRae, \\"the earliest version of the Platform Sutra contains two versions of Huineng's verse. Later version contain one version of Huineng's stanza, somewhat different from the two older ones: The followers who were present were astonished by the work of a southern barbarian. Being cautious of Huineng's status, the Patriarch wiped away the stanza and claimed that the author of the stanza had not reached enlightenment. According to the traditional interpretation, which is based on Guifeng Zongmi, the fifth- generation successor of Shenhui, the two verses represent respectively the gradual and the sudden approach. According to McRae, this is an incorrect understanding: Huineng's verse does not stand alone, but forms a pair with Shenxiu's verse: McRae notes a similarity in reasoning with the Oxhead School, which used a threefold structure of \\"absolute, relative and middle\\", or \\"thesis-antithesis-synthesis\\". According to McRae, the Platform Sutra itself is the synthesis in this threefold structure, giving a balance between the need of constant practice and the insight into the absolute. =Chapter Two - Prajna (Lecture)= Chapter Two contains a lecture on prajna, given after a recitation of the Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra. From this chapter: =Chapter Three - Questions= In Chapter Three Huineng answers questions from a lay audience. Huineng discusses the famous story of Bodhidharma telling Emperor Wu of Liang that his good deeds would bring him no merit. Next, he discusses the Pure Land of the West, asserting the greater importance of one's inner state compared to one's physical location. This leads to a conclusion in which Huineng asserts that lay practice outside of a monastery is preferable to following the forms of monastic renunciation without inner practice. =Chapter Four - Meditation and Wisdom (Lecture)= In Chapter Four, meditation and wisdom are said to be of the same essence: =Chapter Five - Seated Meditation (Lecture)= Chapter Five details the \\"pureness of our fundamental nature\\": =Chapter Six - Ceremony of Repentance= Chapter Six describes a repentance-ritual. =Chapter Seven - Key Events (Encounter stories and dialogues)= Chapter Seven gives various stories of encounters and dialogues. =Chapter Eight - Immediate and Gradual (Encounter stories and dialogues)= Chapter Eight also gives various stories of encounters and dialogues. =Chapter Nine - The Imperial Summons= Chapter Nine describes the request of the Imperial Court for Huineng to visit the Emperor, and Huineng's decline of this command. =Chapter Ten - Transmission= In the chapter on his final instructions, Huineng instructs his accomplished disciples, giving specific instructions how to \\"preach the Dharma\\", which show the influence of the Buddhist teachings on the five skandhas, the concept of Namarupa, and the Yogacara-teachings: Scholarship and translations =Japanese scholarship= In the 1920s, Japanese scholar Yabuki Keiki (Áü¢ÂêπÊÖ∂Ëºù 1879-1939) produced an edition based on one of the Mogao Caves texts (the only one known at the time), dividing the text into fifty-seven sections. In 1934, D. T. Suzuki published an edition based on the Mogao Cave text, but incorporating corrections from the Tsungpao (Zongbao) edition. In 1993, the Buddhist scholar Yang Zengwen (Ê•äÊõæÊñá, b. 1939, Shandong) published an annotated edition of the second Mogao Caves text (which has fewer errors than the first Mogao Caves text). (Pine, 2006, Introduction) = Translations into English = The first published translation into English was completed in 1930 by Wong Mou-lam (ÈªÉËåÇÊûó -1934) from Guangdong. It was based on the canonical Tsungpao edition, and published by the Yu Ching Press of Shanghai. The Suzuki edition was translated into English by Wing-tsit Chan in 1963 and is written in his book, A source book in Chinese Philosophy. In 1967 Philip Yampolsky published a translation based on the Mogao Cave text. This translation is a landmark in the modern Western scholarship on Zen and its history. Charles Luk translated the sutra as \\"The Dharma Treasure of the Altar Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch\\" which was published in Ch'an and Zen Teachings (Third Series, 1973). John McRae translated the longer Yuan dynasty-era composite edition. It was published by Bukky≈ç Dend≈ç Ky≈çkai. Tripitaka Master Hsuan Hua commented on the Sixth Patriarch Sutra.

He commanded the Challenger Expedition, and the British Arctic Expedition. He was highly thought of as a leader and scientific explorer. In later life he worked for the Board of Trade and as Acting Conservator of the River Mersey.  Biography  = Family = He was born on 24 April 1831, the third son and sixth child of Commander William Henry Nares, a British naval officer, and Elizabeth Rebecca Gould, at Llansenseld, near Abergavenny in Monmouthshire. He was baptised at the church of St Bridget, Llansanffraid on 22 May. He married Mary Grant, the eldest daughter of a Portsmouth banker, on 22 June 1858. They had four sons and six daughters. His two youngest sons, George Edward Nares and John Dodd Nares entered the Royal Navy. = Education and early naval career = He was educated at the Royal Naval School in New Cross, and in 1845 joined the Royal Navy aboard , an old battleship captured from the French. Following a posting to on the Australian station in 1848 during which he served as both midshipman and mate, he returned in 1851 and passed his lieutenant's exam in 1852. = First Arctic experience = While returning to England in Havannah in 1851, Nares had met Commander George Henry Richards, a future Hydrographer of the Navy, who had suggested he apply to Sir Edward Belcher for a place on his search for Sir John Franklin. Nares was accepted as the second mate of , and thus gained valuable early experience of the Arctic during the 1852‚Äì1854 expedition. = Gunnery specialist = In 1854 Nares received his promotion to lieutenant and specialised as a gunnery officer. He joined the new battleship in 1854, including service in the Mediterranean during the Crimean War. During this time he was loaned to the under the command of Captain Arthur Cumming. Glatton arrived in the Black Sea too late to see action. = Instructor and author = He served as a lieutenant in charge of training cadets in , and from 1859, in her successor, . During this time he wrote the best-selling book The Naval Cadet's Guide, which was also republished under the title Seamanship, and was regarded as the best manual of its day. He was promoted to commander in 1862 and took command of the training ship in September 1863. = Surveyor = His next ship was the aging 4-gun wooden paddle sloop , which he commanded from 1865. Although he had served in the steam-assisted Conqueror over ten years previously, this was his first paddle steamer, and in a further departure, she was employed in surveying duties on the east coast of Australia. His duties involved keeping the communications between Sydney and Cape York Peninsula in the furthest north point of Queensland open. On the long journeys between he conducted surveys of the Great Barrier Reef.Obituary of Sir George Nares at JSTOR His next appointment was to the brand new ,The journal Nature (21 January 1915) tells that when Newport was at Malta in 1869 the chief engineer, who was anxious not to go to sea because he wanted to attend some function on shore with his wife, asked to be given forty-eight hours to take off the cylinder covers. Captain Nares replied \\"By all means.\\" The chief engineer was jubilant, but on the planned day of sailing, after the usual morning muster by division, the order was given \\"Hands make sail\\",¬ù and the ship sailed out of the harbour without the aid of the engines, much to the chagrin of the engineer staff. Nature reports this as an example of his competence under sail and that it \\"was a good lesson given with tact and judgement\\".(Nature, 94. pp. 565‚Äì567. (21 January 1915). ) which he commissioned and took to the Mediterranean for survey work, including a survey of the Gulf of Suez, accessed by the newly opened Suez Canal. The Suez Canal opened in November 1869. On the morning of 17 November, a procession of ships entered the canal, headed by the French Imperial yacht Aigle. Among the ships following was the Newport captained by Nares, which would survey the canal a few months later. The Admiralty required a survey and report before it would allow the canal to be used by naval vessels. G.H. Richards, Hydrographer of the Navy joined Newport in January 1870. They traversed the canal in both directions, taking soundings and checking the navigation. They approvedthe canal, subject to completion of improvements that were already under way . In recognition of his work in the Gulf of Suez, Nares was promoted to the rank of captain in 1869. He commissioned in 1871 for the Red Sea, and on the outward voyage the ship conducted studies of the water currents in the Straits of Gibraltar for William Benjamin Carpenter, a biologist who believed that density differences between water masses generated ocean currents. = Challenger expedition = HMS Challenger Charles Wyville Thomson and the Royal Society of London obtained the corvette from the Royal Navy for a 3-year expedition of scientific discovery. Although much of the world was well charted, this extended only to the coastlines and to very shallow depths ‚Äì largely depths significant to the safe navigation of ships. There was a widely held consensus that the oceans were in parts very deep, but almost nothing was known of the make up of the deep oceans, the submarine landscape, nor the life contained within the deep ocean. Challenger was equipped to measure much of this, being loaded with specimen jars, chemical apparatus, trawls and dredges, thermometers and water sampling bottles, sounding leads and devices to collect sediment from the sea bed. Great lengths of rope were provided to allow the sounding of deep oceans, and of Italian hemp alone she carried a total length of . Nares was given command of the Challenger Expedition, a recognition of his experience in this field, but also of his scientific approach to surveying and exploration. His work with William Carpenter in Shearwater had been a key factor in the choice of commanding officer. His officers were all naval surveyors, and the team of civilian scientists, led by Charles Wyville Thomson. Challenger spent a year in the Atlantic and after turning east in early 1874 she turned south in the Indian Ocean, visiting the Prince Edward, Kerguelen, and Heard Islands. She reached as far south as before reaching the ice pack. In the process she became the first steam vessel to cross the Antarctic Circle. Not all similar expeditions had been so successful, and in particular the easy relations between the scientific gentlemen and the naval officers was a testament to the sure leadership of George Nares. It was therefore a measure of his success as the commander of a scientific expedition that he was recalled in November 1874 to lead a similar but more arduous expedition at the opposite end of the earth. = British Arctic Expedition = Because of his previous experience in the Arctic, he was summoned from this assignment to take charge of another Arctic voyage in search of the North Pole in and in 1875, the British Arctic Expedition. On this expedition, Nares became the first explorer to take his ships all the way north through the channel between Greenland and Ellesmere Island--now named Nares Strait in his honor--to the Lincoln Sea. Up to this time, it had been a popular theory that this route would lead to the supposed Open Polar Sea, an ice-free region surrounding the pole, but Nares found only a wasteland of ice. A sledging party under Albert Hastings Markham set a new record farthest north of 83¬∞ 20' 26\\"N, but overall the expedition was a near-disaster. The men suffered badly from scurvy and were hampered by inappropriate clothing and equipment. Realizing that his men could not survive another winter in the ice, Nares hastily retreated southward with both his ships in the summer of 1876. Nares wrote an account of the expedition, Narrative of a Voyage to the Polar Sea during 1875‚Äì6 H.M. Ships \\"Alert\\" and \\"Discovery\\" and published by Sampson, Low, Searle & Rivington of London. Nares was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1876, received the founder's medal of the Royal Geographical Society in 1877 and was awarded the Gold medal from the Soci√©t√© de G√©ographie in 1879. These scientific awards were matched by an appointment as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1876. = Later life = In 1878 he was appointed in command of Alert, his ship from the Arctic expedition, in which he surveyed the Strait of Magellan. He left the ship on 11 March 1879, and from 1879 to 1896 was employed in the harbour department of the Board of Trade. During this period he retired from the Royal Navy, on 24 April 1886. He was promoted on the retired list twice, firstly in 1887 to rear-admiral, and secondly in 1892 to vice-admiral. After leaving the Board of Trade in 1896 he became a conservator of the River Mersey, a post which he held until 1910. He was a member of the ship committee for Robert Falcon Scott's 1912 Terra Nova Expedition. His wife Mary died in 1905. Nares died at home aged 83 at Kingston upon Thames, on 15 January 1915 and was buried in Long Ditton churchyard.

The liger has parents in the same genus but of different species. The liger is distinct from the similar hybrid called the tigon, and is the largest of all known extant felines. They enjoy swimming, which is a characteristic of tigers, and are very sociable like lions. Notably, ligers typically grow larger than either parent species, unlike tigons.Ligers messybeast.com Retrieved 4 September 2012. History The history of lion-tiger hybrids dates to at least the early 19th century in India. In 1798, √âtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1772‚Äì1844) made a colour plate of the offspring of a lion and a tiger. The portmanteau \\"liger\\" was coined by the 1930s.\\"When the sire is a lion the result is termed a Liger, whilst the converse is a Tigon.\\" Edward George Boulenger, World Natural History, B. T. Batsford ltd., 1937, p. 40. \\"Ligress\\" is used to refer to a female liger, on the model of \\"tigress\\". In 1825, G. B. Whittaker made an engraving of liger cubs born in 1824. The parents and their three liger offspring are also depicted with their trainer in a 19th-century painting in the na√Øve style. Two liger cubs born in 1837 were exhibited to King William IV and to his successor Queen Victoria. On 14 December 1900 and on 31 May 1901, Carl Hagenbeck wrote to zoologist James Cossar Ewart with details and photographs of ligers born at the Hagenbeck's Tierpark in Hamburg in 1897. In Animal Life and the World of Nature (1902‚Äì1903), A. H. Bryden described Hagenbeck's \\"lion-tiger\\" hybrids: > It has remained for one of the most enterprising collectors and naturalists > of our time, Mr. Carl Hagenbeck, not only to breed but to bring successfully > to a healthy maturity, specimens of this rare alliance between those two > great and formidable Felidae, the lion and tiger.

(contributor). \\"Animal Life and > the World of Nature\\" (1902‚Äì1903, bound partwork). In 1935, four ligers from two litters were reared in the Zoological Gardens of Bloemfontein, South Africa. Three of them, a male and two females, were still living in 1953. The male weighed and stood a foot and a half (45 cm) taller than a full grown male lion at the shoulder. Although ligers are more commonly found than tigons today, in At Home in the Zoo (1961), Gerald Iles wrote \\"For the record I must say that I have never seen a liger, a hybrid obtained by crossing a lion with a tigress. They seem to be even rarer than tigons.\\"Iles, G. At Home in the Zoo (1961). Appearance Color plate of the offspring of a lion and tiger, √âtienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire The liger has a faint tiger- like striped pattern upon a lionesque tawny background. In addition, it may inherit rosettes from the lion parent (lion cubs are rosetted and some adults retain faint markings). These markings may be black, dark brown or sandy. The background color may be correspondingly tawny, sandy or golden. In common with tigers, as an example of countershading, the underparts are pale. The specific pattern and color depend upon which subspecies the parents were and how the genes interact in the offspring. White tigers have been crossed with lions to produce \\"white\\" (actually pale golden) ligers. In theory, white tigers could be crossed with white lions to produce white, very pale or even stripeless ligers. There are no black ligers. Very few melanistic tigers have ever been recorded, most being due to excessive markings (pseudo-melanism or abundism) rather than true melanism; no reports of black lions have ever been substantiated. As blue or Maltese tigers probably no longer exist, gray or blue ligers are exceedingly improbable. It is not impossible for a liger to be white, but it is very rare. The first known white ligers were born in December 2013 at Myrtle Beach Safari in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina to a white male lion and a white female tiger. Size and growth The liger is often believed to be the largest known cat in the world. Males reach a total length of ,Description of ligers at Bestiarium.kryptozoologie.netDescription of ligers at Lairweb.org.nz which means that they rival even large male lions and tigers in length.Vratislav Maz√°k: Der Tiger. Westarp Wissenschaften; Auflage: 5 (April 2004), unver√§nd. Aufl. von 1983 Imprinted genes may be a factor contributing to the large size of ligers. These are genes that may or may not be expressed on the parent they are inherited from, and that occasionally play a role in issues of hybrid growth. For example, in some dog breed crosses, genes that are expressed only when maternally-inherited cause the young to grow larger than is typical for either parent breed. This growth is not seen in the paternal breeds, as such genes are normally \\"counteracted\\" by genes inherited from the female of the appropriate breed. Other big cat hybrids can reach similar sizes; the litigon, a rare hybrid of a male lion and a female tigon, is roughly the same size as the liger, with a male named Cubanacan (at the Alipore Zoo in India) reaching . The extreme rarity of these second- generation hybrids may make it difficult to ascertain whether they are larger or smaller, on average, than the liger. It is sometimes wrongly believed that ligers continue to grow throughout their lives due to hormonal issues. It may be that they simply grow far more during their growing years and take longer to reach their full adult size. Further growth in shoulder height and body length is not seen in ligers over six years old, as in both lions and tigers. Male ligers also have the same levels of testosterone on average as an adult male lion, yet are azoospermic in accordance with Haldane's rule. In addition, female ligers may also attain great size, weighing approximately and reaching long on average, and are often fertile. In contrast, pumapards (hybrids between pumas and leopards) tend to exhibit dwarfism. Ligers are about the same size as the prehistoric Smilodon populator and American lion. =Records= Hercules the liger and his trainer Bhagavan Antle. Hercules, the largest non-obese liger, is recognised by the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest living cat on Earth, weighing .Largest living cat Hercules was featured on the Today Show, Good Morning America, Anderson Cooper 360, Inside Edition, and in a Maxim article in 2005, when he was only three years old and already weighed . The Valley of the Kings Animal Sanctuary in Wisconsin had a male liger named Nook who weighed over . To compare, the records for the lion and tiger in captivity are under . Health and longevity Though ligers typically have a life expectancy between 13 and 18 years, they are occasionally known to live into their 20s. A ligress named Shasta was born at the Hogle Zoo in Salt Lake City on 14 May 1948 and died in 1972 at age 24. Nook died in 2007, at 21 years old. Hobbs, a male liger at the Sierra Safari Zoo in Reno, Nevada, lived to almost 15 years of age before succumbing to liver failure, and weighed .Largest cat hybrid 242px Panthera hybrids tend to experience a higher rate of injury and neurological disorder than non-hybrids. Though not universal, ligers and tigons may develop health issues. Organ failure issues have been reported in ligers, in addition to neurological deficits, sterility, cancer, and arthritis. Fertility right The fertility of hybrid big cat females is well documented across a number of different hybrids. This is in accordance with Haldane's rule: in hybrids of animals whose sex is determined by sex chromosomes, if one of the two sexes is absent, rare or sterile, it will be the heterogametic sex. Male ligers are consequently sterile, while female ligers are not. Ligers and tigons were long thought to be totally sterile. However, in 1943, a fifteen-year-old hybrid between a lion and an island tiger was successfully mated with a lion at the Munich Hellabrunn Zoo. The female cub, though of delicate health, was raised to adulthood.Guggisberg, C. A. W. Wild Cats of the World (1975). In September 2012, the Russian Novosibirsk Zoo announced the birth of a \\"liliger\\", the offspring of a liger mother and a lion father. The cub was named Kiara. Co- occurrence of parent species As with the tigon, the liger exists only in captivity. Historically, the Asiatic lion and the Bengal tiger co-occurred in some Asian countries, and there are legends of male lions mating with tigresses in the wilderness, or of ligers existing there. The two species' ranges are known to overlap in India's Gir National Park, though no ligers were known to live there until the modern era. The range of the Caspian tiger has overlapped with that of the lion in places such as northern Iran and eastern Anatolia. Zoo policies 236x236px Keeping the two species separate has been standard procedure. However, ligers have occurred, and do occur, by accident in captivity. Several AZA zoos are reported to have ligers. The USA holds the greatest population of around 30 ligers. China holds about 20 ligers. There are a few countries worldwide that hold a few, but probably less than 100 exist worldwide. The breeding of ligers and other Panthera hybrids has come under fire from animal rights activists and organisations, who argue that the health problems experienced by these animals makes their creation immoral. Despite these assertions of immorality, some zoos still breed ligers for profit.

History  The NSG was founded in response to the Indian nuclear test in May 1974 and first met in November 1975. The test demonstrated that certain non-weapons specific nuclear technology could be readily turned to weapons development. Nations already signatories of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) saw the need to further limit the export of nuclear equipment, materials or technology. Another benefit was that non-NPT and non-Zangger Committee nations, then specifically France, could be brought in. A series of meetings in London from 1975 to 1978 resulted in agreements on the guidelines for export; these were published as INFCIRC/254 (essentially the Zangger \\"Trigger List\\") by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Listed items could only be exported to non-nuclear states if certain International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards were agreed to or if exceptional circumstances relating to safety existed. The name of the \\"London Club\\" was due to the series of meetings in London. It has also been referred to as the London Group, or the London Suppliers Group. The NSG did not meet again until 1991. The \\"Trigger List\\" remained unchanged until 1991, although the Zangger list was regularly updated. The revelations about the Iraqi weapons program following the first Gulf War led to a tightening of the export of so-called dual-use equipment. At the first meeting since 1978, held at the Hague in March 1991, the twenty-six participating governments agreed to the changes, which were published as the \\"Dual-use List\\" in 1992, and also to the extension of the original list to more closely match the up- to-date Zangger list.  Participating governments  Initially the NSG had seven participating governments: Canada, West Germany, France, Japan, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In 1976-77, participation was expanded to fifteen with the admittance of Belgium, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, and Switzerland. Germany was reunited in 1990 while Czechoslovakia broke up into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993. Twelve more nations joined up to 1990. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union a number of former republics were given observer status as a stage towards future membership. China became a participating government in 2004. The European Commission and the Zangger Committee Chair participate as observers. The NSG Chair for 2020-2021 is Belgium. , the NSG has 48 participating governments: NUCLEAR SUPPLIERS GROUP.              Candidate Participants  =India= Countries supporting India's NSG membership During a state visit to India in November 2010, U.S. President Barack Obama announced U.S. support for India's participation in the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the Wassenaar Arrangement, the Australia Group and the Missile Technology Control Regime, \\"in a phased manner,\\" and to encourage the evolution of regime participation criteria to that end, \\"consistent with maintaining the core principles of these regimes.\\"FACT SHEET: U.S.-INDIA PARTNERSHIP ON EXPORT CONTROLS AND NON- PROLIFERATION, The White House, Office of the Press Secretary, 8 November 2010. During a visit to India in December 2010, French President Sarkozy also expressed his country's backing for India's inclusion in Nuclear Suppliers Group. The United Kingdom has for a long time been a supporter of India's inclusion in the Nuclear Suppliers Group. During Republic Day visit of India in January 2015, Obama said that India was ready for NSG membership. Russian president Vladimir Putin has also offered unconditional support to India's entry into NSG. Switzerland also announced its backing on India's Membership in 48 member group on 6 June 2016 during PM Modi's visit to Geneva, President Obama reiterated U.S. support for India's NSG membership on 8 June 2016 during PM Modi's visit to Washington DC. Japan has expressed support for India's bid for membership of the NSG. However, China is opposing India's membership citing Pakistan's non-admission in the exclusive group. Other countries opposing Indian membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) on the basis of NPT non-signatory status of India include New Zealand, Ireland and Austria. In June 2016, India got crucial support from Mexico in its bid to become a member of the NSG ahead of a plenary meeting of the 48-nation bloc whose members are allowed to trade in and export nuclear technology. On 17 June, British Prime Minister David Cameron had assured Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the UK's \\"firm support\\" for India's NSG membership bid. In an interview on 18 June, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that he was 'positive' about India's entry into NSG. On 20 June, Canada stated that NSG will be strengthened with India's presence. On 22 June France reiterated its support to India, and urged all the other 48 members of the NSG to allow entry for India into the atomic control body. China remains opposed to Indian membership. In July 2016, South Africa agreed to back India's entry into the NSG. In August 2016, Turkey confirmed support for India's NSG membership bid. On 4 September 2016, Australia reiterated its commitment to India's bid for membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group just ahead of the G20 summit in Hangzhou, China. On 5 September 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi thanked Argentina for backing India's bid. On 17 October 2016, following the BRICS summit in Benaulim, Goa, Brazil officially backed India's bid for NSG membership. On 26 October 2016, Prime Minister Key of New Zealand stated that \\"New Zealand would continue to contribute constructively to the process currently underway in the NSG to consider India‚Äôs membership.\\" Poland and Cyprus backed India's NSG bid in April 2017. Germany reaffirmed India's NSG membership bid in May 2017. Switzerland also showed support for India's NSG bid .The Swiss Foreign Ministry spokesperson Pierre-Alain Eltschinger said that ‚ÄúWe support India‚Äôs application for participation in the NSG and acknowledge India‚Äôs support to global non-proliferation efforts.‚Äù During the 15th RIC(Russia, India,China) foreign ministerial meeting Russia has said it continues to support India‚Äôs entry into the exclusive Nuclear Suppliers‚Äô Group. Describing India as a leading power in the Indo-Pacific region, Washington's envoy to New Delhi, Kenneth Juster reaffirmed support for India‚Äôs NSG bid in January 2018. In the joint press statement of India-Nordic countries summit, The Nordic countries welcomed India‚Äôs application for membership of the Nuclear Suppliers‚Äô Group and reaffirmed their commitment to work constructively within the Group with the aim of reaching a positive outcome at the earliest opportunity in April 2018. On 16 April 2018 Germany supported India's bid for NSG membership saying that India's inclusion into the NSG will boost the global export control system. Reaffirming their commitment to global non-proliferation efforts, PM Conte reiterated Italy's support to India's intensified engagement for admission into the Nuclear Suppliers' Group (NSG) in Oct 2018 during the 24th edition of the India-Italy Technology Summit. As of 2019, China has thwarted every attempt of India's inclusion into NSG and has made it clear that status quo will remain citing \\"lack of consensus\\" among NSG members. =Pakistan= Pakistan applied for membership on 19 May 2016. Pakistan has stressed the need for NSG to adopt a non-discriminatory criteria-based approach for NSG membership of the countries, which have never been party to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Pakistan is supported by Turkey and China. Pakistan has launched a major lobbying campaign to get additional support on its NSG membership. The US has not publicly opposed Pakistan, the US State Department's Spokesperson Mark Toner commented in May 2016: ‚ÄúThey have made public their interest, and certainly any country can submit its application for membership. And we‚Äôll consider [it] based on a consensus decision.‚Äù Subsequently, NSG initiated discussions on the ‚ÄòTechnical, Legal, and Political aspects of participation of non-NPT states in the NSG‚Äô in the Seoul Plenary in June 2017. China has also tied Indian bid to Pakistani bid, blocking the former's entry repeatedly based on the argument that If India can be let in without signing NPT, then Pakistan should be granted membership as well. In 2004, the illicit procurement network run by Pakistani scientist AQ Khan, who led Pakistan's uranium enrichment program, was exposed. This network trafficked in nuclear and dual-use goods and supported nuclear weapons programs in Iran, Libya and North Korea as well as Pakistan itself, and included individuals and entities from over 30 countries. In 2004, Pakistan also promulgated an Export Control Act on Goods, Technologies, Materials and Equipment related to Nuclear and Biological Weapons and their Delivery Systems and published Export Control Lists in 2005, which have been frequently updated. The United States on 26 March 2018 sanctioned seven Pakistani firms for nuclear proliferation, thereby delivering a huge blow to its ambitions of NSG membership. =Namibia= Namibia applied for NSG membership in 2016.  Role in India-US nuclear agreement  In July 2006, the United States Congress amended U.S. law to accommodate civilian nuclear trade with India. A meeting of NSG participating governments on 21‚Äì22 August 2008 on an India-specific exemption to the Guidelines was inconclusive. Several participating governments, including Austria, Switzerland, Norway, Ireland, and New Zealand, expressed reservations about the lack of conditions in the proposed exemption. In another meeting on 6 September 2008, the NSG participating governments agreed to grant India a \\"clean waiver\\" from its existing rules, which forbid nuclear trade with a country which has not signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The NSG's decision came after three days of intense U.S. diplomacy. The approval was based on a formal pledge by India stating that it would not share sensitive nuclear technology or material with others and would uphold its voluntary moratorium on testing nuclear weapons.

This excludes some individuals with prominent financial assets in Britain. The editors estimate subjects' wealth from a range of public information, based on values in January each year. They typically explain their actions by stating: \\"We measure identifiable wealth, whether land, property, racehorses, art or significant shares in publicly quoted companies. We exclude bank accounts‚Äîto which we have no access... We try to give due consideration to liabilities.\\" The 2015 list marked the first year Queen Elizabeth II was not among the list's top 300 most wealthy since the list began in 1989.

The Sunday Times Tax List was inaugurated on 27 January 2019 in the Sunday Times Magazine, using data collected for the Rich List and edited by Robert Watts.  Giving List  Since 2005, as part of the Rich List, The Sunday Times has produced an annual Giving List, which tracks the most generous philanthropists in the UK as a proportion of their wealth. In 2018, it was reported that, of the 300 philanthropists listed in the Giving List, a total of ¬£3.207 billion was given away. Jamie Cooper, the former wife of hedge fund manager Sir Christopher Anthony Hohn, was ranked in first place with a giving index of 88.89%, which amounted to donations in 2018 of ¬£299.6 million.

History = Origins = Flower Clock, one of the main tourist landmarks of the city The valley where Vi√±a del Mar was founded was known as the valley of Peuco by the Changos, native inhabitants of the area dedicated to fishing. With the arrival of the Spanish conquistadores the valley was divided into two large haciendas. North of the Marga Marga creek up to the current location of Re√±aca, Vi√±a del Mar, and to the south up to the current Cerro Bar√≥n (Baron Hill), the Hacienda Las Siete Hermanas (The Seven Sisters). Francisco Javier Alvares authorized the construction of a railroad through his lands to join Santiago and the port of Valpara√≠so. The arrival of the railroad brought a young engineer Jose Francisco Vergara who married Francisco Javier Alvares's granddaughter, Mercedes Alvares. It was Jos√© Francisco Vergara who instigated the idea of the creation of a new city independent of Valpara√≠so. = Arrival of the railroad and founding = Wulff Castle High-rise buildings by the shore. The establishment of Refinadora de Az√∫car de Vi√±a del Mar (Sugar Refining Company), CRAV in 1873 and the arrival of the British company of Lever & Murphy in 1883 gave the necessary economic push to transform the young city into one of the most important cities of Chile. The building of a military installation, Regimiento Coraceros in 1917, naval facilities in Las Salinas, and the housing of military and naval personnel furthered the city's growth. That year, also, a seaside villa was rebuilt as what is known today as Wulff Castle.http://www.patrimoniovina.cl/index.php?ir=pags/det_nuestracasa.php paragraphs under Historia.

It is now home to CD Everton, a soccer team in the Chilean Premier division, which took its name from the English team. According to the 1982 movie, Missing and other sources, Vina Del Mar was focal point for the plotters of the 1973 Chilean coup d'√©tat. Vi√±a del Mar was declared a sister city of Sausalito, California (a city north of San Francisco), in 1971. To demonstrate the sister city relationship, you can find a square (plaza) called \\"Vi√±a del Mar\\" in downtown Sausalito, and a \\"Sausalito\\" stadium and \\"Sausalito\\" lagoon in Vi√±a del Mar. Vi√±a del Mar is also a sister city of Mar del Plata, Argentina since 1993. During the 1980s, a global economic downturn seriously affected the city, a number of small and medium-sized factories went bankrupt, including the stationery manufacturer Coda, and most importantly, CRAV, and Textiles Vi√±a, two of the biggest employers in the city. Unemployment rose to alarmingly high rates. Many factories started to consolidate their operations in Santiago making the situation even worse. The city has failed to fully recover from the blows inflicted by the economic downturn of 1982, but an increase in the number of international tourists visiting the city, and the recent high prices of copper in world markets have promoted an economic recovery. Extensive commercial redevelopment in the 15 Norte Avenue area, previously an abandoned industrial area, has seen most of the large Chilean retail chains settling in the area, which is now covered with large shopping malls, like Marina Arauco, cinemas, fast food stores, and supermarkets. The city has benefitted from major investments in infrastructure that have greatly improved the traffic flow in the downtown area, especially in routes connecting Vi√±a del Mar with Santiago, Valpara√≠so and Quilpu√©. A modern and efficient subway (Merval) connects Vi√±a del Mar with the cities of Limache and Valpara√≠so, following the original railroad tracks between Valpara√≠so and Santiago.

Arcot Mudaliars and Muslims are the dominant communities followed by Naidus and Vanniyars in Arcot town. Etymology Its name is commonly believed to have been derived from the Tamil words aaru (River) + kaadu (forest). However, arkaadu meant 'a forest of fig trees'.Without knowing the actual meaning of the name of a village Arkkadu (Arcot), the Sanskrit scholars translated it Sataranyam, which literally means six forests, whereas the Tamil word arkkadu literally means a forest of fig trees. See Prof. M. Varadarajan, \\"A History of Tamil literature\\" (translated from Tamil by E. Sa. Viswanathan), Sahitya Akademi, New Delhi, 1988, p.1- 17 Jainism was flourishing in this part of Tamil Land who were otherwise known as Arugar most probably corrupted form of Arhants or the perfected souls. The word Arugar is found in many ancient literary works and places dominant with Arugars were related to them viz Arakonam, Arumbakkam, Aruvur, etc. Not far away from present day Arcot (Anglicized form of Aarkaadu) there is a place called Arungundram. Hence Arcot or Aarkaadu would have derived its name from Arugarkaadu. History =Carnatic= The town's strategic location has led to it being repeatedly contested and prompted the construction of a formidable fortress. The Nawabdom of the Carnatic was established by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, who in 1692 appointed Zulfiqar Ali Khan as the first Nawab of the Carnatic. In 1740, the Maratha forces came down upon Arcot. They attacked the Nawab, Dost Ali in the pass of Damalcherry. In the war that followed, Dost Ali, one of his sons Hasan Ali, and a number of prominent persons lost their lives. This initial success at once enhanced Maratha prestige in the south. From Damalcherry the Marathas proceeded to Arcot. It surrendered to them without much resistance. Chanda Saheb and his son were arrested and sent to Nagpur. In 1751, The English captured the town during the conflict between the United Kingdom and France for control of South India. The English successfully held it with only 500 men against the French and the Nawab, resisting for 56 days (23 September to 14 November 1751). The enemy army eventually dissolved and its leader, Chanda Shahib, was killed. Mohammed Ali Khan Walajah took over as Nawab, effectively serving as a vassal of the British. His successors soon ran up enormous debts at the hands of English speculators. In 1801, the town was annexed by the British East India Company. In the 20th century, Arcot declined in importance and was incorporated into Vellore District. Arcot has the tomb of the famous 18th-century Sufi Saint Tipu Mastan Aulia. The story goes that from the blessings of Tipu Mastan Aulia, Hyder Ali had a son Tippu Sultan of Mysore, whom he appropriately named after the saint.

It also has a viable local weaving industry, and groundnut oil industry. Arcot is most famous for edible oil production, mainly focusing on groundnut and gingelly oil production. A number of oil expellers are available in and around Arcot. Certain caste of people are more dominant and involved in this edible oil business. Culture The people who lived in the Arcot region, especially in and near the temple town of Tiruvannamalai, belonged to a clan called the Arcots. The Nawabs fought with and ruled over them for a long period. With the establishment of the Danish Missionary Society, many of these Arcots converted Christians. The Danish Missionary Society (DMS, currently Dan Mission) established many schools and hospitals. The first missionary of the DMS was the German Rev. C.C.E. Ochs. He started his first mission station, Bethanien, at Melpattambakkam in South Arcot in 1861. Now all its activities have been transferred to the nearby town of Nellikuppam. The second mission station of DMS was opened at Tirukkoyilur in 1869 by Rev. P. Andersen and was called \\"Siloam\\". Siloam church was consecrated on 10 October 1886 and on the same day the first Indian pastors were ordained and more than 30 persons were baptized. A week later a church was consecrated in an outstation, Sengalmedu. The beautiful church in Pop ham's Broadway in Madras was built in 1892. Saron, a third mission station of DMS, was opened in 1882 and situated just outside the town Tiruvannamalai. In 1898 a mission station was built in the town. From 1905 it was called \\"Carmel.\\" The fourth mission station in the Arcot District, \\"Bethesda,\\" in Kallakurichi was built in 1893 by Rev. A. Larsen. Later DMS started mission stations at Panruti, Vriddhachalam, Devanampatnam, Darisanapuram, and Servaroj Hills, etc. In 1913 a church constitution was inaugurated. This church is serving the Tamil-speaking population in the districts of South and North Arcot, Tamil Nadu. Mayana Kollai is celebrated here. People paint themselves and appear as gods having goat flesh in their mouths and drumsticks in their hands. They walk over the bazaar street towards the burial ground. Eassayanoor Valavanoor.

He is best known as the co-creator of Colossal Cave Adventure, a seminal computer game that influenced the first decade of game design and inspired the text adventure game genre. Biography IMP Team (left to right): Truett Thatch, Bill Bartell, Dave Walden, Jim Geisman, Robert Kahn, Frank Heart, Ben Barker, Marty Thorpe, Will Crowther, Severo Ornstein During the early 1970s, Crowther worked at defense contractor and internet pioneer Bolt Beranek and Newman (B.B.N.), where he was part of the original small ARPAnet development team. His implementation of a distributed distance vector routing system for the ARPAnet was an important step in the evolution of the internet. Crowther met and married Pat Crowther while studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he received a B.S. in physics in 1958. =Adventure= Following his divorce from his wife, Crowther used his spare time to develop a text-based adventure game in Fortran on BBN's PDP-10. He created it as a diversion his daughters Sandy and Laura could enjoy when they came to visit. Crowther wrote: > I had been involved in a non-computer role-playing game called Dungeons and > Dragons at the time, and also I had been actively exploring in caves - > Mammoth Cave in Kentucky in particular. Suddenly, I got involved in a > divorce, and that left me a bit pulled apart in various ways. In particular > I was missing my kids. Also the caving had stopped, because that had become > awkward, so I decided I would fool around and write a program that was a re- > creation in fantasy of my caving, and also would be a game for the kids, and > perhaps some aspects of the Dungeons and Dragons that I had been playing. My > idea was that it would be a computer game that would not be intimidating to > non-computer people, and that was one of the reasons why I made it so that > the player directs the game with natural language input, instead of more > standardized commands. My kids thought it was a lot of fun. In Colossal Cave, or more simply called Adventure, the player moves around an imaginary cave system by entering simple, two-word commands and reading text describing the result. Crowther used his extensive knowledge of cave exploration as a basis for the game play, and there are many similarities between the locations in the game and those in Mammoth Cave, particularly its Bedquilt section. In 1975 Crowther released the game on the early ARPAnet system, of which BBN was a prime contractor. In the spring of 1976, he was contacted by Stanford researcher Don Woods, seeking his permission to enhance the game. Crowther agreed, and Woods developed several enhanced versions on a PDP-10 housed in the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL) where he worked. Over the following decade the game gained in popularity, being ported to many operating systems, including personal-computer platform CP/M. The basic game structure invented by Crowther (and based in part on the example of the ELIZA text parser) was carried forward by the designers of later adventure games. Marc Blank and the team that created the Zork adventures cite Adventure as the title that inspired them to create their game. They later founded Infocom and published a series of popular text adventures. =Caving= The location of the game in Colossal Cave was not a coincidence. Crowther and his first wife Pat were active and dedicated cavers in the 1960s and early 1970s--both were part of many expeditions to connect the Mammoth and Flint Ridge cave systems. Pat played a key role in the September 9, 1972 expedition that finally made the connection. Indeed, even during his time working at BBN, his colleagues noticed that Crowther spent a fair amount of time doing chin-ups in doorframes, which apparently helped him concentrate. As a member of the MIT Outing Club during the late 1950s and early 1960s, Crowther also played an important role in the development of rock climbing in the Shawangunks in New York State. He began climbing there in the 1950s and continues to climb today. He made the first ascent of several classic routes including Arrow, Hawk, Moonlight, and Sent√©. Some of these routes sparked controversy because protection bolts were placed on rappel, a new tactic that Crowther and several others began to use at the time. The community reaction to this technique was an important part of the evolution of climbing ethics in the Shawangunks and beyond. =Rest of career= Crowther worked at Xerox PARC from 1976 to 1983. During this period he met and married Nancy Sanders Burnes in 1980 in Palo Alto, California. The two of them did a lot of rock climbing with friends in Yosemite and elsewhere. In 1983 he left Xerox and went back to Bolt Beranek and Newman in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He became active with the Appalachian Mountain Club and every year helped teach rock climbing to beginners. He continues doing that each spring, with the most recent session being held in spring of 2013. In the 1990s Cisco Systems bought the part of BBN where Crowther was working. He continued to work for Cisco and retired from there in 1997. He now lives in Delanson, New York, with his second wife Nancy.

It was one of the three formes fixes (the other two were the rondeau and the virelai) and one of the verse forms in France most commonly set to music between the late 13th and the 15th centuries. The formes fixes were standard forms in French-texted song of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The ballade is usually in three stanzas, each ending with a refrain (a repeated segment of text and music). The ballade as a verse form typically consists of three eight-line stanzas, each with a consistent metre and a particular rhyme scheme. The last line in the stanza is a refrain. The stanzas are often followed by a four-line concluding stanza (an envoi) usually addressed to a prince. The rhyme scheme is therefore usually , where the capital \\"C\\" is a refrain. The many different rhyming words that are needed (the 'b' rhyme needs at least fourteen words) makes the form more difficult for English than for French poets. Geoffrey Chaucer wrote in the form. It was revived in the 19th century by English-language poets including Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Algernon Charles Swinburne. Other notable English-language ballade writers are Andrew Lang, Hilaire Belloc and G. K. Chesterton (at Wikisource). A humorous example is Wendy Cope's 'Proverbial Ballade'.  Musical form  Schematic representation of a ballade stanza Balladelle stanza Machaut's \\"Honte, paour, doubtance\\". Note the musical rhyme between the clos of part A (m.15‚Äì18) and the end of the refrain (m.27‚Äì29). The musical form of a ballade stanza is a bar form (AAB), with a first, repeated musical section (stollen) setting the two initial pairs of verses (rhymes \\"ab‚Äìab\\"), and the second section (abgesang) setting the remaining lines including the refrain verse (\\"bcbC\\"). The two statements of the \\"A\\" section often have different endings, known as \\"ouvert\\" and \\"clos\\" respectively, with the harmony of the \\"ouvert\\" ending leading back to the beginning and that of the \\"clos\\" ending leading forward into the \\"B\\" section. In many ballades, the final part of the \\"B\\" section may reintroduce melodic material referring back to the end of the \\"A\\" part, a feature known as \\"musical rhyme\\" (or, in German, R√ºcklaufballade). An alternative form employed by Machaut, known as ballade duplex or balladelle, has the B part also divided into two repetitions, with the refrain line sung as part of the repetition. A famous exception to the normal form is \\"Se la face ay pale\\" by Guillaume Dufay, where the entire stanza is through-composed, i.e. without a repetition between the two \\"A\\" sections. Notable writers of ballades Guillaume de Machaut wrote 42 ballades set to music. A few of them set two or even three poems to music simultaneously, with different texts sung in different voices. Most of the others have a single texted voice with either one or two untexted (instrumental) accompanying voices. One of the most notable writers of ballades in the 15th century was Fran√ßois Villon. Variations There are many easy-to-identify variations to the ballade; it is in many ways similar to the ode and chant royal. Some ballades have five stanzas. A seven-line ballade, or ballade royal, consists of four stanzas of rhyme royal, all using the same three rhymes, all ending in a refrain, without an envoi. A ballade supreme has ten-line stanzas rhyming , with the envoi . An example is Ballade des Pendus by Fran√ßois Villon. There are also instances of a double ballade and double-refrain ballade.

Steinem was a columnist for New York magazine, and a co-founder of Ms. magazine. In 1969, Steinem published an article, \\"After Black Power, Women's Liberation\\", which brought her to national fame as a feminist leader. Steinem speaking with supporters at the Women Together Arizona Summit at Carpenters Local Union in Phoenix, Arizona, September 2016. In 2005, Steinem, Jane Fonda, and Robin Morgan co-founded the Women's Media Center, an organization that \\"works to make women visible and powerful in the media\\". , Steinem traveled internationally as an organizer and lecturer, and was a media spokeswoman on issues of equality.  Early life  Steinem was born on March 25, 1934, in Toledo, Ohio, the daughter of Ruth (n√©e Nuneviller) and Leo Steinem. Her mother was Presbyterian, mostly of German (including Prussian) and some Scottish descent.Finding Your Roots, February 23, 2016, PBS. Her father was Jewish, the son of immigrants from W√ºrttemberg, Germany, and Radziej√≥w, Poland. Her paternal grandmother, Pauline Perlmutter Steinem, was chairwoman of the educational committee of the National Woman Suffrage Association, a delegate to the 1908 International Council of Women, and the first woman to be elected to the Toledo Board of Education, as well as a leader in the movement for vocational education. Pauline also rescued many members of her family from the Holocaust. The Steinems lived and traveled about in a trailer, from which Leo carried out his trade as a roaming antiques dealer. Before Gloria was born, her mother, Ruth, then age 34, had a \\"nervous breakdown,\\" which left her an invalid, trapped in delusional fantasies that occasionally turned violent. She changed \\"from an energetic, fun-loving, book- loving\\" woman into \\"someone who was afraid to be alone, who could not hang on to reality long enough to hold a job, and who could rarely concentrate enough to read a book.\\" Ruth spent long periods in and out of sanatoriums for the mentally ill. Steinem was 10 years old when her parents finally separated in 1944. Her father went to California to find work, while she and her mother continued to live together in Toledo. While her parents divorced under the stress of her mother's illness, Steinem did not attribute it at all to male chauvinism on the father's part‚Äîshe claims to have \\"understood and never blamed him for the breakup.\\"Marcello, Patricia. Gloria Steinem: A Biography. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2004. p. 20. Nevertheless, the impact of these events had a formative effect on her personality: while her father, a traveling salesman, had never provided much financial stability to the family, his exit aggravated their situation.Marcello, Patricia. Gloria Steinem: A Biography. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2004. Steinem concluded that her mother's inability to hold on to a job was evidence of general hostility towards working women. She also concluded that the general apathy of doctors towards her mother emerged from a similar anti-woman animus. Years later, Steinem described her mother's experience as pivotal to her understanding of social injustices. These perspectives convinced Steinem that women lacked social and political equality. Steinem attended Waite High School in Toledo and Western High School in Washington, D.C., graduating from the latter while living with her older sister Susanne Steinem Patch. She then attended Smith College, an institution with which she continues to remain engaged, from which she received her A.B. magna cum laude and graduated as a member of Phi Beta Kappa. In 1957, Steinem had an abortion. The procedure was performed by Dr. John Sharpe, a British physician, when abortion was still illegal. Years later, Steinem dedicated her memoir My Life on the Road (2015) to him. She wrote: \\"Dr. John Sharpe of London, who in 1957, a decade before physicians in England could legally perform an abortion for any reason other than the health of the woman, took the considerable risk of referring for an abortion a twenty-two-year-old American on her way to India. Knowing only that she had broken an engagement at home to seek an unknown fate, he said, 'You must promise me two things. First, you will not tell anyone my name. Second, you will do what you want to do with your life.'\\" In the late 1950s, Steinem spent two years in India as a Chester Bowles Asian Fellow, where she worked as a law clerk to Mehr Chand Mahajan, then Chief Justice of India. After returning to the United States, she served as director of the Independent Research Service, an organization funded in secret by a donor that turned out to be the CIA. She worked to send non-Communist American students to the 1959 World Youth Festival. In 1960, she was hired by Warren Publishing as the first employee of Help! magazine.  Journalism career  Esquire magazine features editor Clay Felker gave freelance writer Steinem what she later called her first \\"serious assignment\\", regarding contraception; he didn't like her first draft and had her re-write the article. Her resulting 1962 article about the way in which women are forced to choose between a career and marriage preceded Betty Friedan's book The Feminine Mystique by one year. In 1963, while working on an article for Huntington Hartford's Show magazine, Steinem was employed as a Playboy Bunny at the New York Playboy Club. The article, published in 1963 as \\"A Bunny's Tale\\", featured a photo of Steinem in Bunny uniform and detailed how women were treated at those clubs. Steinem has maintained that she is proud of the work she did publicizing the exploitative working conditions of the bunnies and especially the sexual demands made of them, which skirted the edge of the law. However, for a brief period after the article was published, Steinem was unable to land other assignments; in her words, this was \\"because I had now become a Bunny‚Äîand it didn't matter why.\\" In the interim, she conducted an interview with John Lennon for Cosmopolitan magazine in 1964. In 1965, she wrote for NBC-TV's weekly satirical revue, That Was The Week That Was (TW3), contributing a regular segment entitled \\"Surrealism in Everyday Life\\". Steinem eventually landed a job at Felker's newly founded New York magazine in 1968. In 1969, she covered an abortion speak-out for New York Magazine, which was held in a church basement in Greenwich Village, New York. Steinem had had an abortion herself in London at the age of 22. She felt what she called a \\"big click\\" at the speak-out, and later said she didn't \\"begin my life as an active feminist\\" until that day. As she recalled, \\"It [abortion] is supposed to make us a bad person. But I must say, I never felt that. I used to sit and try and figure out how old the child would be, trying to make myself feel guilty. But I never could! I think the person who said: 'Honey, if men could get pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament' was right. Speaking for myself, I knew it was the first time I had taken responsibility for my own life. I wasn't going to let things happen to me. I was going to direct my life, and therefore it felt positive. But still, I didn't tell anyone. Because I knew that out there it wasn't [positive].\\" She also said, \\"In later years, if I'm remembered at all it will be for inventing a phrase like 'reproductive freedom' ... as a phrase it includes the freedom to have children or not to. So it makes it possible for us to make a coalition.\\"Gilbert, Lynn & Moore, Gaylen, \\"Particular Passions: Talks With Women Who Shaped Our Times\\". Clarkson Potter, 1981. p. 166. The first issue of Ms., released in 1972 In 1972, she co-founded the feminist-themed magazine Ms. alongside founding editors Letty Cottin Pogrebin, Mary Thom, Patricia Carbine, Joanne Edgar, Nina Finkelstein, Dorothy Pitman Hughes, and Mary Peacock; it began as a special edition of New York, and Clay Felker funded the first issue. Its 300,000 test copies sold out nationwide in eight days. Within weeks, Ms. had received 26,000 subscription orders and over 20,000 reader letters. In 1974, Ms. Magazine collaborated with public television to produce the television program Woman Alive!, and Gloria Steinem was featured in the first episode in her role as co-founder of Ms. Magazine.Woman Alive! Collection, 1974‚Äì1977: A Finding Aid. MC 421. Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. Accessed May 18, 2020. The magazine was sold to the Feminist Majority Foundation in 2001; Steinem remains on the masthead as one of six founding editors and serves on the advisory board. Also in 1972, Steinem became the first woman to speak at the National Press Club. In 1978, Steinem wrote a semi-satirical essay for Cosmopolitan titled \\"If Men Could Menstruate\\" in which she imagined a world where men menstruate instead of women. She concludes in the essay that in such a world, menstruation would become a badge of honor with men comparing their relative sufferings, rather than the source of shame that it had been for women. On March 22, 1998, Steinem published an op-ed in The New York Times (\\"Feminists and the Clinton Question\\") in which, without actually challenging accounts by Bill Clinton's accusers, she claimed they did not represent sexual harassment. This was criticized by various writers, as in the Harvard Crimson and in the Times itself. In 2017, Steinem, in an interview with the British newspaper The Guardian, stood by her 1998 New York Times op-ed, but also claimed \\"I wouldn‚Äôt write the same thing now.\\"  Activism  In 1959, Steinem led a group of activists in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to organize the Independent Service for Information on the Vienna festival, to advocate for American participation in the World Youth Festival, a Soviet-sponsored youth event. In 1968, Steinem signed the \\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\" pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.\\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\\" January 30, 1968 New York Post. In 1969, she published an article, \\"After Black Power, Women's Liberation\\" which brought her to national fame as a feminist leader. As such she campaigned for the Equal Rights Amendment, testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee in its favor in 1970. That same year she published her essay on a utopia of gender equality, \\"What It Would Be Like If Women Win\\", in Time magazine. On July 10, 1971, Steinem was one of over three hundred women who founded the National Women's Political Caucus (NWPC), including such notables as Bella Abzug, Betty Friedan, Shirley Chisholm, and Myrlie Evers- Williams. As a co-convener of the Caucus, she delivered the speech \\"Address to the Women of America\\", stating in part: In 1972, she ran as a delegate for Shirley Chisholm in New York, but lost. In March 1973, she addressed the first national conference of Stewardesses for Women's Rights, which she continued to support throughout its existence. Stewardesses for Women's Rights folded in the spring of 1976. Despite her influence in the feminist movement, Steinem also earned criticism from some feminists as well, who questioned whether she was committed to the movement or using it to promote her glamorous image. The Redstockings also singled her out for agreeing to cooperate with the CIA- backed Independent Research Service. It was also acknowledged that Steinem worked as a CIA agent when this operation was taking place. Steinem, who grew up reading Wonder Woman comics, was also a key player in the restoration of Wonder Woman's powers and traditional costume, which were restored in issue #204 (January‚ÄìFebruary 1973). Steinem, offended that the most famous female superhero had been depowered, had placed Wonder Woman (in costume) on the cover of the first issue of Ms. (1972)‚ÄîWarner Communications, DC Comics' owner, was an investor‚Äîwhich also contained an appreciative essay about the character. In doing so, however, Steinem forced the firing of Samuel R. Delany who had taken over scripting duties with issue #202. Delany was supposed to write a six-issue story arc, which would culminate in a battle over an abortion clinic where Wonder Woman was to defend women trying to use their services, a critical feminist issue at the time. The story outlines and the work already done on the issues was scrapped, something that Steinem was not aware of and made no attempt to rectify. In 1976, the first women-only Passover seder was held in Esther M. Broner's New York City apartment and led by Broner, with 13 women attending, including Steinem.This Week in History ‚Äì E.M. Broner publishes \\"The Telling\\"  Jewish Women's Archive . Jwa.org (March 1, 1993). Retrieved on October 18, 2011. In 1977, Steinem became an associate of the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. In 1984, Steinem was arrested along with a number of members of Congress and civil rights activists for disorderly conduct outside the South African embassy while protesting against the South African apartheid system. At the outset of the Gulf War in 1991, Steinem, along with prominent feminists Robin Morgan and Kate Millett, publicly opposed an incursion into the Middle East and asserted that ostensible goal of \\"defending democracy\\" was a pretense. During the Clarence Thomas sexual harassment scandal in 1991, Steinem voiced strong support for Anita Hill and suggested that one day Hill herself would sit on the Supreme Court. In 1992, Steinem co-founded Choice USA, a non-profit organization that mobilizes and provides ongoing support to a younger generation that lobbies for reproductive choice. In 1993, Steinem co-produced and narrated an Emmy Award-winning TV documentary for HBO about child abuse, called, \\"Multiple Personalities: The Search for Deadly Memories.\\" Also in 1993, she and Rosilyn Heller co-produced an original TV movie for Lifetime, \\"Better Off Dead,\\" which examined the parallel forces that both oppose abortion and support the death penalty. She contributed the piece \\"The Media and the Movement: A User's Guide\\" to the 2003 anthology Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women's Anthology for a New Millennium, edited by Robin Morgan. On June 1, 2013, Steinem performed on stage at the \\"Chime For Change: The Sound Of Change Live\\" Concert at Twickenham Stadium in London, England. Later in 2014, UN Women began its commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women, and as part of that campaign Steinem (and others) spoke at the Apollo Theater in New York City. Chime For Change was funded by Gucci, focusing on using innovative approaches to raise funds and awareness especially regarding girls and women. Steinem has stated, \\"I think the fact that I've become a symbol for the women's movement is somewhat accidental. A woman member of Congress, for example, might be identified as a member of Congress; it doesn't mean she's any less of a feminist but she's identified by her nearest male analog. Well, I don't have a male analog so the press has to identify me with the movement. I suppose I could be referred to as a journalist, but because Ms. is part of a movement and not just a typical magazine, I'm more likely to be identified with the movement. There's no other slot to put me in.\\" Contrary to popular belief, Steinem did not coin the feminist slogan \\"A woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle.\\" Although she helped popularize it, the phrase is actually attributable to Irina Dunn. When Time magazine published an article attributing the saying to Steinem, Steinem wrote a letter saying the phrase had been coined by Dunn.Letters, Time magazine, US edition, September 16, 2000, and Australian edition, October 9, 2000. Retrieved November 11, 2014. Another phrase sometimes wrongly attributed to Steinem is, \\"If men could get pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament.\\" Steinem herself attributed it to \\"an old Irish woman taxi driver in Boston,\\" whom she said she and Florynce Kennedy met. As for 2015, she joined the thirty leading international women peacemakers and became an honorary co-chairwoman of 2015 Women's Walk For Peace In Korea with Mairead Maguire. The group's main goal is to advocate disarmament and seek Korea's reunification. It will be holding international peace symposiums both in Pyongyang and Seoul in which women from both North Korea and South Korea can share experiences and ideas of mobilizing women to stop the Korean crisis. The group's specific hope is to walk across the 2-mile wide Korean Demilitarized Zone that separates North Korea and South Korea which is meant to be a symbolic action taken for peace in the Korean peninsular suffering for 70 years after its division at the end of World War II. It is especially believed that the role of women in this act would help and support the reunification of family members divided by the split prolonged for 70 years. She is also the chair of the advisory board of Apne Aap Women Worldwide, an organization fighting sex trafficking and inter- generational prostitution in India, founded by Ruchira Gupta. She has also written extensively on her travels, experiences with women and the Indian feminist movement with her colleague and friend, Ruchira Gupta.  Involvement in political campaigns  Steinem's involvement in presidential campaigns stretches back to her support of Adlai Stevenson in the 1952 presidential campaign.Lazo, Caroine. Gloria Steinem: Feminist Extraordinaire. New York: Lerner Publications, 1998. p. 28. = 1968 election = A proponent of civil rights and fierce critic of the Vietnam War, Steinem was initially drawn to Senator Eugene McCarthy because of his \\"admirable record\\" on those issues, but in meeting him and hearing him speak, she found him \\"cautious, uninspired, and dry.\\" As the campaign progressed, Steinem became baffled at \\"personally vicious\\" attacks that McCarthy leveled against his primary opponent Robert F. Kennedy, even as \\"his real opponent, Hubert Humphrey, went free.\\" On a late- night radio show, Steinem garnered attention for declaring, \\"George McGovern is the real Eugene McCarthy.\\"Miroff, Bruce. The Liberals' Moment: The McGovern Insurgency and the Identity Crisis of the Democratic Party. University Press of Kansas, 2007. p. 206. In 1968, Steinem was chosen to pitch the arguments to McGovern as to why he should enter the presidential race that year; he agreed, and Steinem \\"consecutively or simultaneously served as pamphlet writer, advance 'man', fund raiser, lobbyist of delegates, errand runner, and press secretary.\\" McGovern lost the nomination at the 1968 Democratic National Convention, and Steinem later wrote of her astonishment at Hubert Humphrey's \\"refusal even to suggest to Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley that he control the rampaging police and the bloodshed in the streets.\\" = 1972 election = Steinem at the LBJ Library in 1975 At the Women's Action Alliance news conference of January 12, 1972 Steinem was reluctant to re-join the McGovern campaign, as although she had brought in McGovern's single largest campaign contributor in 1968, she \\"still had been treated like a frivolous pariah by much of McGovern's campaign staff.\\" In April 1972, Steinem remarked that he \\"still doesn't understand the Women's Movement\\". McGovern ultimately excised the abortion issue from the party's platform, and recent publications show McGovern was deeply conflicted on the issue.Miroff. p. 207. Steinem later wrote this description of the events: Gloria Steinem in 1977, photographed by Lynn Gilbert However, Germaine Greer flatly contradicted Steinem's account, reporting, \\"Jacqui Ceballos called from the crowd to demand abortion rights on the Democratic platform, but Bella [Abzug] and Gloria stared glassily out into the room,\\" thus killing the abortion rights platform,\\" and asking \\"Why had Bella and Gloria not helped Jacqui to nail him on abortion? What reticence, what loserism had afflicted them?\\"Harper's Magazine October 1972. Steinem later recalled that the 1972 Convention was the only time Greer and Steinem ever met. The cover of Harper's that month read, \\"Womanlike, they did not want to get tough with their man, and so, womanlike, they got screwed.\\" = 2004 election = In the run-up to the 2004 election, Steinem voiced fierce criticism of the Bush administration, asserting, \\"There has never been an administration that has been more hostile to women's equality, to reproductive freedom as a fundamental human right, and has acted on that hostility,\\" adding, \\"If he is elected in 2004, abortion will be criminalized in this country.\\" At a Planned Parenthood event in Boston, Steinem declared Bush \\"a danger to health and safety,\\" citing his antagonism to the Clean Water Act, reproductive freedom, sex education, and AIDS relief. = 2008 election = Steinem at Brighton High School (Brighton, Colorado), in November 2008 Steinem was an active participant in the 2008 presidential campaign, and praised both the Democratic front-runners, commenting, Nevertheless, Steinem endorsed Senator Hillary Clinton, citing her broader experience, and saying that the nation was in such bad shape it might require two terms of Clinton and two of Obama to fix it. She also made headlines for a New York Times op-ed in which she cited gender and not race as \\"probably the most restricting force in American life\\". She elaborated, \\"Black men were given the vote a half-century before women of any race were allowed to mark a ballot, and generally have ascended to positions of power, from the military to the boardroom, before any women.\\" This was attacked, however, from critics saying that white women were given the vote unabridged in 1920, whereas many blacks, female or male, could not vote until the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and some were lynched for trying, and that many white women advanced in the business and political worlds before black women and men. Steinem again drew attention for, according to the New York Observer, seeming \\"to denigrate the importance of John McCain's time as a prisoner of war in Vietnam\\"; Steinem's broader argument \\"was that the media and the political world are too admiring of militarism in all its guises.\\" Following McCain's selection of Sarah Palin as his running mate, Steinem penned an op-ed in which she labeled Palin an \\"unqualified woman\\" who \\"opposes everything most other women want and need,\\" described her nomination speech as \\"divisive and deceptive\\", called for a more inclusive Republican Party, and concluded that Palin resembled \\"Phyllis Schlafly, only younger.\\" = 2016 election = Steinem at an event campaigning for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in September 2016. In an HBO interview with Bill Maher, Steinem, when asked to explain the broad support for Bernie Sanders among young Democratic women, responded, \\"When you're young, you're thinking, 'Where are the boys? The boys are with Bernie.'\\" Her comments triggered widespread criticism, and Steinem later issued an apology and said her comments had been \\"misinterpreted\\". Steinem endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the run-up for the 2016 U.S. presidential election.Brendan, J. International Business Times February 10, 2016. Steinem was an honorary co- chair of and speaker at the Women's March on Washington on January 21, 2017, the day after the inauguration of Donald Trump as president.  CIA ties and leader of Independent Research Service  In May 1975, Redstockings, a radical feminist group, published a report that Steinem and others put together on the Vienna Youth Festival and its attendees for the Independent Research Service. Though she acknowledged having worked for the CIA-financed foundation in the late 1950s and early 1960s in interviews given to The New York Times and The Washington Post in 1967 in the wake of the Ramparts magazine CIA exposures (nearly two years before Steinem attended her first Redstockings or feminist meeting), Steinem in 1975 denied any continuing involvement. In 2004, however, a 1975 report by Human Events which noted Steinem's CIA ties and which had been classified by the CIA was made public.https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA- RDP88-01315R000300380009-2.pdf In her book My Life on the Road, Steinem spoke openly about the relationship she had with the CIA in the 1950s and 1960s and defended the CIA relationship, saying: \\"In my experience [the CIA] was completely different from its image; it was liberal, nonviolent and honorable.\\" However, it was acknowledged that Steinem in fact served as the leader of the Independent Research Service when it was receiving money from the CIA. She also maintained ties with her successor Gene Theoroux, who acknowledged that he covered up Steinem's ties to the CIA and that she was \\"very pleased\\" when he \\"killed the CIA reference to her\\" in his \\"column.\\"  Personal life  Steinem was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1986 and trigeminal neuralgia in 1994. Steinem has no biological children.name=The Atlantic> On September 3, 2000, at age 66, Steinem married David Bale, father of actor Christian Bale. The wedding was performed at the home of her friend Wilma Mankiller, the first female Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation. Steinem and Bale were married for only three years before he died of brain lymphoma on December 30, 2003, at age 62. Previously, she had had a four-year relationship with the publisher Mortimer Zuckerman. Commenting on aging, Steinem says that as she approached 60 she felt like she entered a new phase in life that was free of the \\"demands of gender\\" that she faced from adolescence onward.  Political positions  Gloria Steinem (right) and Alice Walker celebrate Steinem's 75th birthday in the Fall 2009 issue of Ms. Although most frequently considered a liberal feminist, Steinem has repeatedly characterized herself as a radical feminist. More importantly, she has repudiated categorization within feminism as \\"nonconstructive to specific problems,\\" saying: \\"I've turned up in every category. So it makes it harder for me to take the divisions with great seriousness.\\" Nevertheless, on concrete issues, Steinem has staked several firm positions. = Female genital mutilation and male genital mutilation = In 1979, Steinem wrote the article on female genital mutilation that brought it into the American public's consciousness; the article, \\"The International Crime of Female Genital Mutilation,\\" was published in the March 1979 issue of Ms..\\"The International Crime of Female Genital Mutilation,\\" by Gloria Steinem. Ms., March 1979, p. 65. The article reported on the \\"75 million women suffering with the results of genital mutilation.\\" According to Steinem, \\"The real reasons for genital mutilation can only be understood in the context of the \\"patriarchy\\": men must control women's bodies as the means of production, and thus repress the independent power of women's sexuality.\\" Steinem's article contains the basic arguments that would later be developed by philosopher Martha Nussbaum.Nussbaum, Martha C. Sex & Social Justice. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999. pp. 118‚Äì129. On circumcision, she commented, \\"These patriarchal controls limit men's sexuality too ... That's why men are asked symbolically to submit the sexual part of themselves and their sons to patriarchal authority, which seems to be the origin of male circumcision, a practice that, even as advocates admit, is medically unnecessary 90% of the time. Speaking for myself, I stand with many brothers in eliminating that practice too.\\" = Feminist theory = Steinem at the LBJ Library in 2019 Steinem has frequently voiced her disapproval of the obscurantism and abstractions some claim to be prevalent in feminist academic theorizing. She said, \\"Nobody cares about feminist academic writing. That's careerism. These poor women in academia have to talk this silly language that nobody can understand in order to be accepted ... But I recognize the fact that we have this ridiculous system of tenure, that the whole thrust of academia is one that values education, in my opinion, in inverse ratio to its usefulness‚Äîand what you write in inverse relationship to its understandability.\\" Steinem later singled out deconstructionists like Judith Butler for criticism, saying, \\"I always wanted to put a sign up on the road to Yale saying, 'Beware: Deconstruction Ahead'. Academics are forced to write in language no one can understand so that they get tenure. They have to say 'discourse', not 'talk'. Knowledge that is not accessible is not helpful. It becomes aerialised‚Äîand I think it's important that women's experiences be given a narrative.\\" = Kinsey Reports = In addition to feminism, Steinem has also been a prominent advocate for analyzing the Kinsey Reports. = Pornography = Steinem has criticized pornography, which she distinguishes from erotica, writing: \\"Erotica is as different from pornography as love is from rape, as dignity is from humiliation, as partnership is from slavery, as pleasure is from pain.\\"Erotica and Pornography: A Clear and Present Difference. Ms. November 1978, p. 53. & Pornography‚ÄîNot Sex but the Obscene Use of Power. Ms. August 1977, p. 43. Both retrieved November 16, 2014. Steinem's argument hinges on the distinction between reciprocity versus domination, as she writes, \\"Blatant or subtle, pornography involves no equal power or mutuality. In fact, much of the tension and drama comes from the clear idea that one person is dominating the other.\\" On the issue of same-sex pornography, Steinem asserts, \\"Whatever the gender of the participants, all pornography including male-male gay pornography is an imitation of the male- female, conqueror-victim paradigm, and almost all of it actually portrays or implies enslaved women and master.\\" Steinem has also cited \\"snuff films\\" as a serious threat to women. = Same-sex marriage = In an essay published in Time magazine on August 31, 1970, \\"What Would It Be Like If Women Win,\\" Steinem wrote about same-sex marriage in the context of the \\"Utopian\\" future she envisioned, writing: > What will exist is a variety of alternative life-styles. Since the > population explosion dictates that childbearing be kept to a minimum, > parents-and-children will be only one of many \\"families\\": couples, age > groups, working groups, mixed communes, blood-related clans, class groups, > creative groups. Single women will have the right to stay single without > ridicule, without the attitudes now betrayed by \\"spinster\\" and \\"bachelor.\\" > Lesbians or homosexuals will no longer be denied legally binding marriages, > complete with mutual-support agreements and inheritance rights. > Paradoxically, the number of homosexuals may get smaller. With fewer over- > possessive mothers and fewer fathers who hold up an impossibly cruel or > perfectionist idea of manhood, boys will be less likely to be denied or > reject their identity as males. Although Steinem did not mention or advocate same-sex marriage in any published works or interviews for more than three decades, she again expressed support for same-sex marriage in the early 2000s, stating in 2004 that \\"[the] idea that sexuality is only okay if it ends in reproduction oppresses women‚Äîwhose health depends on separating sexuality from reproduction‚Äîas well as gay men and lesbians.\\" Steinem is also a signatory of the 2008 manifesto, \\"Beyond Same-Sex Marriage: A New Strategic Vision For All Our Families and Relationships\\", which advocates extending legal rights and privileges to a wide range of relationships, households, and families. = Transgender rights = In 1977, Steinem expressed disapproval that the heavily publicized sex reassignment surgery of tennis player Ren√©e Richards had been characterized as \\"a frightening instance of what feminism could lead to\\" or as \\"living proof that feminism isn't necessary.\\" Steinem wrote, \\"At a minimum, it was a diversion from the widespread problems of sexual inequality.\\" She also wrote that, while she supported the right of individuals to identify as they choose, she claimed that, in many cases, transsexuals \\"surgically mutilate their own bodies\\" in order to conform to a gender role that is inexorably tied to physical body parts. She concluded that \\"feminists are right to feel uncomfortable about the need for and uses of transsexualism.\\" The article concluded with what became one of Steinem's most famous quotes: \\"If the shoe doesn't fit, must we change the foot?\\" Although clearly meant in the context of transsexuality, the quote is frequently mistaken as a general statement about feminism. On October 2, 2013, Steinem clarified her remarks on transgender people in an op-ed for The Advocate, writing that critics failed to consider that her 1977 essay was \\"written in the context of global protests against routine surgical assaults, called female genital mutilation by some survivors.\\" Steinem later in the piece expressed unequivocal support for transgender people, saying that transgender people \\"including those who have transitioned, are living out real, authentic lives. Those lives should be celebrated, not questioned.\\" She also apologized for any pain her words might have caused.

In media  Steinem on the cover of Ms. in 2002 In 1995, Education of a Woman: The Life of Gloria Steinem, by Carolyn Heilbrun, was published. In 1997, Gloria Steinem: Her Passions, Politics, and Mystique, by Sydney Ladensohn Stern, was published. In 2005, Steinem appeared in season 2, episode 13 of The L Word In the musical Legally Blonde, which premiered in 2007, Steinem is mentioned in the scene where Elle Woods wears a flashy Bunny costume to a party, and must pretend to be dressed as Gloria Steinem \\"researching her feminist manifesto 'I Was A Playboy Bunny'.\\" (The actual name of the piece by Steinem being referred to here is \\"A Bunny's Tale\\".) In 2011, Gloria: In Her Own Words, a documentary, first aired. In 2013, Female Force: Gloria Steinem, a comic book by Melissa Seymour, was published. Also in 2013, Steinem was featured in the documentary MAKERS: Women Who Make America about the feminist movement. In 2014, Who Is Gloria Steinem?, by Sarah Fabiny, was published. Also in 2014, Steinem appeared in season 1, episode 8, of the television show The Sixties. Also in 2014, Steinem appeared in season 6, episode 3, of the television show The Good Wife. In 2016, Steinem was featured in the catalog of clothing retailer Lands' End. After an outcry from anti- abortion customers, the company removed Steinem from their website, stating on their Facebook page: \\"It was never our intention to raise a divisive political or religious issue, so when some of our customers saw the recent promotion that way, we heard them. We sincerely apologize for any offense.\\" The company then faced further criticism online, this time both from customers who were still unhappy that Steinem had been featured in the first place, and customers who were unhappy that Steinem had been removed. In Jennifer Lopez's 2016 music video for her song \\"Ain't Your Mama\\", Steinem can be heard saying part of her \\"Address to the Women of America\\" speech, specifically, \\"This is no simple reform. It really is a revolution.\\" Also in 2016, the television series Woman premiered, featuring Steinem as producer and host; it is a documentary series concerning sexist injustice and violence worldwide. The Gloria Steinem Papers are held in the Sophia Smith Collection at Smith College, under collection number MS 237. The play Gloria: A Life, about Steinem's life, opened October 2018 at the Daryl Roth Theatre, directed by Diane Paulus.

It was designed and built by an Air Ministry‚Äìappointed team and was effectively in competition with the government-funded but privately designed and built R100. When built, it was the world's largest flying craft at in length, and it was not surpassed by another hydrogen-filled rigid airship until the Hindenburg flew seven years later. After trial flights and subsequent modifications to increase lifting capacity, which included lengthening the ship by to add another gasbag,\\"R101\\". Airship Heritage Trust via Airshipsonline.com. Retrieved: 23 July 2008. the R101 crashed in France during its maiden overseas voyage on 5 October 1930, killing 48 of the 54 people on board.Report of the R101 Inquiry 1931, p. 7. Among the passengers killed were Lord Thomson, the Air Minister who had initiated the programme, senior government officials, and almost all the dirigible's designers from the Royal Airship Works. The crash of R101 effectively ended British airship development, and was one of the worst airship accidents of the 1930s. The loss of life was more than the 36 killed in the highly public Hindenburg disaster of 1937, though fewer than the 52 killed in the French military Dixmude in 1923, and the 73 killed when the USS Akron crashed in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of New Jersey in 1933. Background R101 was built as part of a British government initiative to develop airships to provide passenger and mail transport from Britain to the most distant parts of the British Empire, including India, Australia and Canada, since the distances were then too great for heavier-than-air aircraft. The Burney Scheme of 1922 had proposed a civil airship development programme to be carried out by a specially-established subsidiary of Vickers with the support of the British government. The scheme drew support from the Air Ministry which sought more airships and a base in India. The Admiralty added that it would forego some light cruisers of which it was very short. However, Prime Minister Lloyd George's government decided it could not afford to support the Burney Scheme.Higham 1961, p. 283-284. When the General Election of 1923 brought Ramsay MacDonald‚Äôs Labour administration to power, the new Air Minister, Lord Thomson, formulated the Imperial Airship Scheme in place of the Burney Scheme.Masefield 1982, p. 30. It called for the building of two experimental airships: one, R101, to be designed and constructed under direction of the Air Ministry, and the other, R100, to be built by a Vickers subsidiary, the Airship Guarantee Company, under a fixed-price contract. They were nicknamed the \\"Socialist Airship\\" and the \\"Capitalist Airship\\".Philpott, Ian: The Royal Air Force ‚Äì Volume 2: An Encyclopedia of the Inter-War Years In addition to the building of the two airships, the scheme involved the establishment of the necessary infrastructure for airship operations; for example, the mooring masts used at Cardington, Ismalia, Karachi and Montreal had to be designed and built, and the meteorological forecasting network extended and improved.Sprigg 1931, p. 128. Specifications for the airships were drawn up by an Air Ministry committee, whose members included Squadron Leader Reginald Colmore and Lieutenant-Colonel Vincent Richmond,Masefield 1982, p. 454. both of whom had extensive experience with airships, most of them non-rigid. They called for airships of not less than five million cubic feet (140,000 m¬≥) capacity and a fixed structural weight not to exceed 90 tons, giving a \\"disposable lift\\" of nearly 62 tons. With the necessary allowance of about 20 tons for the service load consisting of a crew of approximately 40, as well as stores and water ballast, this allowed a possible fuel and passenger load of 42 tons. Accommodation for 100 passengers and tankage for 57 hours' flight was to be provided, and a sustainable cruise speed of and maximum speed of were called for.Report of the R101 Inquiry 1931, p. 14. In wartime, the airships would be expected to carry 200 troops or possibly five parasite fighter aircraft. Vickers' design team was led by Barnes Wallis, who had extensive experience of rigid airship design and later became famous for the geodetic framework of the Wellington bomber and for the bouncing bomb. His principal assistant (the \\"Chief Calculator\\"), Nevil Shute Norway, later well known as the novelist Nevil Shute, much later gave his account of the design and construction of the two airships in his autobiography, Slide Rule: Autobiography of an Engineer, first published in 1954. Shute's book characterises R100 as a pragmatic and conservative design, and R101 as extravagant and overambitious, but one purpose of having two design teams was to test different approaches, with R101 deliberately intended to extend the limits of existing technology.Masefield 1982, p. 111. Shute later admitted that many of his criticisms of the R101 team were unjustified.Masefield 1982, pp. 204‚Äì205, fn. An extremely-optimistic timetable was drawn up, with construction of the government-built airship to begin in July 1925 and be complete by the following July, with a trial flight to India planned for January 1927.Masefield 1982, p. 51. In the event, the extensive experimentation that was necessary delayed the start of construction of R101 until early 1927. R100 was also delayed, and neither flew until late 1929. Design and development One of the airship hangars at Cardington The whole airship programme was under the direction of the Director of Airship Development (DAD), Group Captain Peregrine Fellowes, with Colmore acting as his deputy. Lieutenant-Colonel Richmond was appointed Director of Design: later he was credited as \\"Assistant Director of Airship Development (Technical)\\"Flight 10 October 1930, p. 1126. with Squadron Leader Michael Rope as his assistant. The Director for Flying and Training, responsible for all operational matters for both airships, was Major G.H. Scott, who had developed the design of the mooring masts that were to be built. Work was based at the Royal Airship Works at Cardington, Bedfordshire, which had been built by Shorts during the First World War and had been employed by the Admiralty to copy and improve on the latest German designs from captured rigid airships. The Works had been nationalised in 1919, but after the loss of the R38 (then in the process of being transferred to the US as ZR2), naval airship development was stopped and it had been placed on a care and maintenance basis. R101 was to be built only after completion of an extensive research and test programme by the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). As part of this programme, the Air Ministry funded the costs of refurbishing and flying R33 in order to gather data about structural loads and the airflow around a large airship. This data was also made available to Vickers;\\"Written Answers.\\" Hansard, 3 May 1926. both airships had the same elongated tear-drop shape, unlike previous designs. Hilda Lyon, who was responsible for the aerodynamic development, found that this shape produced the minimum amount of drag. Safety was a primary concern and this would have an important influence on the choice of engines. R101 under constructionAn early decision had been made to construct the primary structure largely from stainless steel rather than lightweight alloys such as duralumin. The design of the primary structure was shared between Cardington and the aircraft manufacturer Boulton and Paul, who had extensive experience in the use of steel and had developed innovative techniques for forming steel strip into structural sections. Working to an outline design prepared with the help of data supplied by the NPL, the stress calculations were performed by Cardington. This information was then supplied to J. D. North and his team at Boulton and Paul, who designed the metalwork.\\"Division of the Design Work.\\" Flight, 29 November 1928. The individual girders were fabricated by Boulton and Paul in Norwich, and transported to Cardington where they were bolted together. This scheme for a prefabricated structure entailed demanding manufacturing tolerances and was entirely successful, as the ease with which R101 was eventually extended bears witness. Before any contracts for the metalwork were signed, an entire bay consisting of a pair of the 15-sided transverse ring frames and the connecting longitudinal girders was assembled at Cardington. After the assembly had passed loading tests, the individual girders were then tested to destruction. The structure of the airframe was innovative: the ring-shaped transverse frames of previous airships had been braced by radial wires meeting at a central hub, but no such bracing was used in R101, the frames being stiff enough in themselves.\\"His Majesty's Airship R100: The construction of R101.\\" Flight (supplement), 29 November 1928, p. 88. However, this resulted in the structure extending further into the envelope, thereby limiting the size of the gasbags. The specifications drawn up in 1924 by the Committee for the Safety of Airships had based weight estimates on the then-existing rules for airframe strengths. However, the Air Ministry Inspectorate introduced a new set of rules for airship safety standards in late 1924 and compliance with these as-yet unformulated rules had been explicitly mentioned in the individual specifications for each airship.Masefield 1982, p. 457. These new rules called for all lifting loads to be transmitted directly to the transverse frames rather than being taken via the longitudinal girders.Morpurgo 1982, pp. 132‚Äì133. The intention behind this ruling was to enable the stressing of the framework to be fully calculated, rather than relying on empirically accumulated data, as was contemporary practice at the Zeppelin design office. Apart from the implications for the airframe weight, one effect of these regulations was to force both teams to contrive a new system of harnessing the gasbags. R101's patented \\"parachute\\" gasbag harnessing, designed by Michael Rope, proved less than satisfactory, permitting the bags to surge unduly, particularly in rough weather.Report of the R101 Inquiry 1931, pp. 39‚Äì40. This caused the gasbags to chafe against the structure, tearing holes in the fabric. Another effect was that both R100 and R101 had a relatively small number of longitudinal girders in order to simplify the stress calculations. R101 used pre-doped linen panels for much of its covering, rather than lacing undoped fabric into place and then applying dope to shrink it. In order to reduce the area of unsupported fabric in the covering, the design alternated the main longitudinals with non-structural \\"reefing booms\\" mounted on kingposts which were adjustable using screw-jacks in order to tension the covering.Masefield 1982, p. 470. The pre-doped fabric proved unsatisfactory from the start, with panels splitting because of humidity changes before the airship had even left its shed.Report of the R101 Inquiry 1931, p. 31. There were other innovative design features. Previously, ballast containers had been made in the form of leather \\"trousers\\", and one or other leg could be opened at the bottom by a cable-release from the control car. In R101, the extreme forward and aft ballast bags were of this type, and were locally operated, but the main ballast was held in tanks connected by pipes so that ballast could be transferred from one to another to alter the airship's trim using compressed air.\\"R101.\\" Flight, 29 November 1929, p. 1094. The arrangement for ventilating the interior of the envelope, necessary both to prevent any build-up of escaped hydrogen and also to equalise pressure between the outside and inside, was also innovative. A series of flap-valves were situated at the nose and stern of the airship cover (those at the nose are clearly visible in photographs) to allow air to enter when the airship was descending, while a series of vents was arranged around the circumference amidships to allow air to exit during ascent. =Engines= Science Museum in London Heavy oil (diesel) engines were specified by the Air Ministry because the airship was intended for use on the India route, where it was thought that high temperatures would make petrol an unacceptable fire hazard because of its low flash point. A petrol explosion had been a major cause of fatalities in the loss of the R.38 in 1921.\\"Boulton and Paul‚Äîthe R101.\\" norfolkancestors.org. Retrieved: 27 August 2010. Initial calculations were based on the use of seven Beardmore Typhoon six-cylinder heavy-oil engines which were expected to weigh and deliver each.Masefield 1982, p. 464. When the development of this engine proved impractical, the use of the eight-cylinder Beardmore Tornado was proposed instead. This was an engine being developed by Beardmore, combining two four-cylinder engines which had originally been developed for railway use. In March 1925 these were expected to weigh and deliver each. Because of the increased weight of each engine, it was decided to use five, resulting in overall power being reduced from to . Severe torsional resonance of the crankshaft was encountered above 950 rpm, limiting the engine to a maximum of 935 rpm, giving an output of only with a continuous power rating at 890 rpm of .Masefield 1982, p. 69. The engine was also considerably above estimated weight, at , over double the initial estimate. Some of this excess weight was the result of the failure to manufacture a satisfactory lightweight aluminium crankcase.Report of the R101 Inquiry p. 37 The original intention had been to fit two of the engines with variable-pitch propellers in order to provide reverse thrust for manoeuvring during docking. The torsional resonance also caused the hollow metal blades of these reversing propellers to develop cracks near the hubs,The Engineer, October 1930 and as a short term measure one of the engines was fitted with a fixed-pitch reverse propeller, consequently becoming dead weight under normal flight conditions. For the airship's final flight, two of the engines were adapted to be capable of running in reverse by a simple modification of the camshaft.R101 Has Two Reversible EnginesFlight 26 September 1930 Each engine car also contained a Ricardo petrol engine for use as a starter motor. Three of these also drove generators to provide electricity when the airship was at rest or flying at low speeds: at normal flight speeds the generators were driven by constant- speed variable-pitch windmills. The other two auxiliary engines drove compressors for the compressed air fuel and ballast transfer system. Before the final flight, one of the petrol engines was replaced by a Beverly heavy oil engine; to lessen the risk of fire, the petrol tanks could be jettisoned.\\"R101.\\" Flight, 11 October 1929, p. 1095. Diesel fuel was contained in tanks in the transverse frames, the majority of the tanks having a capacity of . A mechanism was provided for dumping fuel directly from the tanks in an emergency. By the use of tankage provided for weight compensation, when travelling with a light passenger load a total fuel load of could be carried.Flight 11 October 1929, pp. 1093‚Äì1094. =Crewing and control= In normal service, the R101 carried a crew of 42. This consisted of two watches of 13 men under the officer of the watch, this duty being divided among the three principal ship's officers. In addition there were the chief navigator, the meteorological officer, the chief coxswain, the chief engineer, the chief wireless officer and the chief steward, who were not assigned to watches but were on duty as necessary, and four supernumeraries (three engineers and a radio operator) who were available to provide relief watch keeping if necessary, and an assistant steward, a cook and a galley boy who were on duty as required between 06:30 and 21:30.Masefield 1982, pp. 517‚Äì519. The minimum crew requirement, as specified in the airship's Certificate of Airworthiness, was 15 men. The control car was occupied by the duty officer of the watch and the steering and altitude coxswains, who respectively controlled the rudder and elevators using wheels similar to a ship's wheel. The engines were individually controlled by an engineer in each of the engine cars, orders being given by an individual telegraph to each car. These moved an indicator in the engine car to signal the desired throttle setting and also rang a bell to draw attention to the fact that an order had been transmitted. =Accommodation= The passenger accommodation was spread over two decks within the envelope and as first designed included 50 passenger cabins for one, two, or four people, a dining room for 60 people, two promenade decks with windows down the sides of the airship, a spacious lounge of and an asbestos-lined smoking room for 24 people. Most of the passenger space was on the upper deck, with the smoking room, kitchen and washrooms, crew accommodation, as well as the chart room and radio cabin on the lower deck.\\"Airships: R101 Interior.\\" Airship Heritage Trust via Airshipsonline.com. Retrieved: 27 August 2010. The control car was immediately under the forward section of the lower deck and was reached by a ladder from the chart room. Walls were made of doped linen painted in white and gold. Weight-saving measures included wicker furniture and aluminium cutlery. The promenade windows were lightweight \\"Cellon\\" instead of the intended glass, and one set was removed as part of later weight-saving measures. Operational history =Testing= 1929 R101 in flight The lengthy process of inflating the R101's hydrogen gasbags began on 11 July 1929 and was complete by 21 September. With the airship now airborne and loosely tethered within the shed, it was now possible to carry out lift and trim trials. These were disappointing. A design conference held on 17 June 1929 had estimated a gross lift of 151.8 tons and a total airframe weight, including the power installation, of 105 tons. The actual figures proved to be a gross lift of 148.46 tons and a weight of 113.6 tons.Masefield 1982, pp. 475‚Äì476. Moreover, the airship was tail-heavy, a result of the tail surfaces being considerably above estimated weight. In this form, a flight to India was out of the question. Airship operations under tropical conditions were made more difficult by the loss of lift in high air temperatures: the loss of lift in Karachi was estimated to be as much as 11 tons for an airship the size of R101.Masefield 1982, p. 293. On 2 October the press were invited to Cardington to view the finished airship.Masefield 1982, pp109-14 However, weather conditions made it impossible to take it out of the shed until 12 October, when it was walked out by a ground-handling party of 400. The event attracted a huge number of spectators, with surrounding roads a solid line of cars. The moored airship continued to attract spectators, and it was estimated that more than a million people had made the trip to Cardington to see R101 at the mast by the end of November.Masefield 1982, pp.131‚Äì2 The flying programme was influenced by the Air Ministry's need to generate favourable publicity, illustrating the political pressures which weighed upon the programme. No√´l Atherstone, the first officer, commented in his diary on 6 November \\"All these window-dressing stunts and joy-rides before she has got an Airworthiness Certificate are quite wrong, but there is no-one in the RAW [Royal Airship Works] executive who has got the guts to put their foot down and insist on trials being free of joy-rides\\".Swinfield 2012, p.262 Atherstone's remarks were occasioned by a lunch held on the airship for delegates to a conference on empire legislation, but there were several similar occasions. R101 made its first flight on 14 October. After a short circuit over Bedford, course was set for London, where it passed over the Palace of Westminster, St Paul's Cathedral and the City, returning to Cardington after a flight lasting five hours 40 minutes. During this flight the servos were not used, without any difficulty being experienced in controlling the airship. A second flight lasting nine hours 38 minutes followed on 18 October, with Lord Thomson among the passengers, after which R101 was briefly returned to the shed to enable some modifications to be made to the starting engines. A third flight lasting seven hours 15 minutes was made on 1 November, during which it was flown at full power for the first time, recording a speed of :Masefield 1982 p.133 even at full speed it was not found necessary to use the control servos. During this flight it circled over Sandringham House, observed by the King and Queen, flew on to the previous Secretary of State for Air's country house near Cromer, then to Norwich over Boulton and Paul's works and aerodrome before returning by Newmarket and Cambridge. On 2 November the first night flight was made, slipping the mast at 20:12 before heading south to fly over London and Portsmouth before attempting a speed trial over a circuit over the Solent and the Isle of Wight. These trials were frustrated by pipe breakages in the cooling systems of two of the engines, a problem later solved by replacing the aluminium piping with copper. It returned to Cardington around 09:00, the mooring operation ending in a minor accident, damaging one of the reefing booms at the bow.Masefield 1982, pp. 13‚Äì5 On 8 November a short flight purely for public relations purposes was made, carrying 40 passengers including the Mayor of Bedford and various officials. To accommodate this load, the airship was flown with only a partial fuel and ballast load and was inflated to a pressure height of . In Atherstone's words, it \\"staggered round the vicinity of Bedford for a couple of hours\\" before returning to the mast. Two days later, the wind began to rise and gales were forecast. On 11 November the wind touched , with a maximum gust speed of . Although the ship's behaviour at the mast gave cause for a good deal of satisfaction, there was nevertheless some cause for concern. The movement of the ship had caused considerable movement of the gasbags, the surging being described by Coxswain \\"Sky\\" Hunt as being around four inches (ten cm) from side to side and \\"considerably more\\" longitudinally. This caused the gasbags to foul the framework, and the resulting chafing caused the gasbags to be holed in many places.Masefield 1982 p.137-8 A sixth flight was made on 14 November to test the modifications that had been made to the cooling system and the repairs to the gasbags, carrying a load of 32 passengers, including 10 MPs with a special interest in aviation and a party of air ministry officials headed by Sir Sefton Brancker, the Director of Civil Aviation.Masefield 1982, p.139 On 16 November it had been planned to carry out a demonstration flight for a party of 100 MPs, a scheme that had been suggested by Thomson in the expectation that few would wish to take advantage of the offer; in the event it was oversubscribed.Masefield 1982, p.128 The weather on the day was unfavourable, and the flight was rescheduled. The weather then cleared, and on the following day R101 slipped the mast at 10:33 to carry out an endurance trial, planned to last at least thirty hours. R101 passed over York and Durham before crossing the coast and flying over the North Sea as far north as Edinburgh, where it turned west towards Glasgow. During the night a series of turning trials were made over the Irish Sea, after which the airship was flown south to fly over Dublin (the home town of R101's Captain, Carmichael Irwin) before returning to Cardington via Anglesey and Chester. After some delay in finding Cardington owing to fog, R101 was secured to the mast at 17:14, after a flight lasting 30 hours 41 minutes. The only technical problem encountered during the flight was with the pump for transferring fuel, which broke down several times, although subsequent examination of the engines showed that one was on the point of suffering a failure of a big end bearing.Masefield 1982 pp.141‚Äì5 The flight for the MPs had been rescheduled for 23 November. With the barometric pressure low, R101 lacked sufficient lift to carry 100 passengers, even though all but a bare minimum of fuel was drained off and the ship lightened by removing all unnecessary stores. The flight was cancelled because of the weather, but not before the politicians had arrived at Cardington: they accordingly embarked and had lunch while the ship rode at the mast, only kept in the air by dynamic lift produced by the wind.Masefield 1982, pp. 146‚Äì7 Following this, R101 remained at the mast until 30 November, when the wind had dropped enough for it to be walked back into the shed. While the initial flight trials were being carried out, the design team examined the lift problem. Studies identified possible weight savings of 3.16 tons. The weight-saving measures included deleting twelve of the double-berth cabins, removing the reefing booms from the nose to frame 1 and between frames 13 to 15 at the tail, replacing the glass windows of the observation decks with Cellon, removing two water ballast tanks, and removing the servo mechanism for the rudder and elevators.Masefield 1982, p. 151. Letting the gasbags out would gain 3.18 tons extra lift, although Michael Rope considered this unwise,Masefield 1982, p. 226. since there were thousands of exposed fixings protruding from the girders; chafing of the gasbags would have to be prevented by wrapping these in strips of cloth. To further increase lift, an extra bay of capacity could be installed. This would deliver an extra nine tons disposable lift. After much consultation, all these proposed measures were approved in December. Letting out the gasbags and the weight-saving measures were begun. Delivery by Boulton Paul of the metalwork for the extra bay was expected to take place in June. 1930 R101 at the mooring mast at Cardington The outer cover was also giving cause for concern. An inspection on 20 January 1930 by Michael Rope and J. W. W. Dyer, head of the Fabric Section at Cardington, revealed serious deterioration of the fabric on the top of the airship in areas where rainwater had accumulated, and a decision was made to add reinforcement bands along the whole length of the envelope. Further tests undertaken by Rope had shown that its strength had deteriorated alarmingly. The original specified strength for the cover was a breaking strain of 700 lb per foot run (10 kN/m): the actual strength of samples was at best 85 lb (1.24 kN/m). The calculated load at a speed of was 143 lb per foot run (2.09 kN/m). A further inspection of the cover on 2 June found many small tears had developed.Masefield 1982, p. 206. An immediate decision was taken to replace the pre-doped cover with a new cover which would be doped after fitting. This would take place following the flights which had been planned for June with the purpose of displaying R101 to the public at the Hendon Air Show; for these flights the cover would be further reinforced. Confirmation of the poor state of the cover came on the morning of 23 June, when R101 was walked out of the shed. It had been at the mast for less than an hour in a moderate wind when an alarming rippling movement was observed and shortly afterwards, a tear appeared on the right- hand side of the airship. It was decided to repair this at the mast and to add more strengthening bands. This was done by the end of the day but the next day a second, shorter, split occurred. This was dealt with in the same way, and it was decided that if the reinforcing bands were added to the repaired area the scheduled appearance at the RAF pageant at Hendon could be made.Report of the R101 Inquiry 1931 p.43 R101 made three flights in June, totalling 29 hours 34 minutes duration. On 26 June a short proving flight was made, the controls ‚Äì no longer servo-operated ‚Äì being described as \\"powerful and fully adequate\\".Masefield 1982, p. 213. At the end of this flight, the R101 was found to be \\"flying heavy\\" and two tons of fuel oil had to be jettisoned in order to lighten the airship for mooring. This was initially attributed to changes in air temperature during the flight. On the following two days, R101 made two flights, the first to take part in the rehearsal for the RAF display at Hendon and the second to take place in the display itself. These flights revealed a problem with lift, considerable jettisoning of ballast being necessary. During this time Lt. Cmd. Atherstone was replaced by Capt. G.F. Meager, who was normally the 1st Officer on R100. Captain Meager was \\"alarmed\\" by the heaviness of R101, as after 10 hours of flight R100 would have been considerably light due to fuel consumption. Meager observed that it was the first time he had \\"the wind up\\" in an airship.Meager 1970, p. 190. Meager had dropped a ton of ballast, and in order to weigh off the R101 for mooring, Flight Lieutenant Irwin was required to dump 10 tons of water and fuel oil.Meager 1970, p. 191.Masefield 1982, p. 221. An inspection of the gasbags revealed a large number of holes, a result of the letting out-of the gasbags which allowed them to foul projections on the girders of the framework.Masefield 1982, p. 222. When the gas bag restraints were loosened to allow more gas capacity (R101B) it came to the attention of Dr. Eckener. His concern was conveyed to Willy von Meister, the Deutsche Zeppelin-Reederei representative in America, who was visiting Luftschiffbau Zeppelin at Lake Constance. Dr. Eckener was concerned that the gas bags would be holed by wearing upon the structure and loss of gas would occur. Willy von Meister stopped on his way back to America to visit his mother and met with Lord Thompson to convey Dr. Eckener's offer of technical help. Lord Thompson listened cordially then thanked von Meister and informed him that padding was being installed and British designers felt that would suffice.Meyer 1991, p. 200-201. Concern was also raised over the possibility of loss of gas through the valves, which were of an innovative design by Michael Rope. Airship valves are intended primarily to vent gas automatically if pressure in the bag rises to the point that the bag might rupture; they are also used to adjust lift for handling. Concern was expressed over the valves opening because of either the airship rolling heavily or localised low pressure caused by the outer cover flapping, but after an examination of their operation F. W. McWade, the Air Inspectorate Department inspector at Cardington, concluded that their operation was satisfactory and they were not likely to have been the cause of any significant loss of gas.Masefield 1982, p. 228. As an experimental aircraft, R101 had been operating under a temporary \\"Permit to Fly\\", the responsibility of McWade. On 3 July, bypassing his immediate superior, he wrote a letter to the Director of Aeronautical Inspection, Lieutenant-Colonel H. W. S. Outram, expressing his unwillingness to recommend either an extension to the permit or the granting of the full Certificate of Airworthiness which would be necessary before the airship could fly in the airspace of other countries. His concern was that the padding on the framework was inadequate to protect the gasbags from chafing, the harnessing having been let out so that they were \\"hard up against the longitudinal girders\\", and that any surging of the gasbags would tend to loosen the padding, rendering it ineffective. He also expressed doubts about the use of padding, considering that it made inspection of the airframe more difficult and would also tend to trap moisture, making problems with corrosion more likely.Report of the R101 Inquiry 1931, p. 50. Outram, who knew little about airships, reacted to this by consulting Colmore, now Director of Airship Development, from whom he received a reassuring reply. The matter was taken no further.Report of the R101 Inquiry 1931 p.51 R101 entered its shed for the extension on 29 June. At the same time the gasbags were given a complete overhaul, two of the engines were replaced by the adapted engines capable of running in reverse, and most of the cover was replaced. The original cover was left in place between frames 3 and 5 and in two of the bays at the tail.Masefield 1982, pp. 301‚Äì302. These parts of the cover had been doped after fitting and were therefore thought to be satisfactory, even though an inspection by McWade had found that some areas where reinforcements had been stuck on with a rubber solution were seriously weakened; these areas were further reinforced, using dope as an adhesive.Report of the R101 Inquiry 1931, p. 93. (fn) A schedule was drawn up by the Air Ministry for R101 to undertake the flight to India in early October, in order that the flight would be made during the Imperial Conference which was to be held in London. The entire programme was intended to improve communication with the Empire, and it was hoped that the flight would generate favourable publicity for the airship programme. The final trial flight of R101 was originally scheduled for 26 September 1930, but high winds delayed the move from the shed until 1 October. That evening, R101 slipped the mast for its only trial flight before setting off for India. This lasted 16 hours 51 minutes and was undertaken under near-ideal weather conditions; because of the failure of the oil cooler in one engine, it was not possible to carry out full-speed trials. The flight was curtailed in order to prepare the airship for the flight to India.\\"Airships: R101 Crash.\\" Airship Heritage Trust via Airshipsonline. Retrieved: 27 August 2010. Despite the lack of full endurance and speed trials, and the fact that a proper investigation of the aerodynamic consequences of the extension had not been fully completed by the N.P.L., a Certificate of Airworthiness was issued on 2 October, the Inspectorate expressing their complete satisfaction with the condition of the R101 and the standards to which the remedial work had been carried out. The certificate was handed over to H. C. Irwin, the ship's captain, on the day of its flight to India.Report of the R101 Inquiry 1931, p. 56. =Final flight= The wreckage of R101 R101 departed from Cardington on the evening of 4 October 1930 for its intended destination of Karachi (then part of British India), via a refuelling stop at Isma√Ølia in Egypt, under the command of Flight Lieutenant Carmichael Irwin. Among the 12 passengers were Lord Thomson, Secretary of State for Air; Sir Sefton Brancker, Director of Civil Aviation; Squadron Leader William Palstra, RAAF Air Liaison Officer (ALO) to the British Air Ministry; Director of Airship Development Reginald Colmore; and both Lt. Col. V. C. Richmond and Michael Rope.\\"R101 Passenger List.\\" Airship Heritage Trust via Airshipsonline. Retrieved: 27 August 2010. The weather forecast on the morning of 4 October was generally favourable, predicting south to south-westerly winds of between 20 and 30 m.p.h. (32 and 48 km/h) at over northern France, with conditions improving over southern France and the Mediterranean Sea.Masefield 1982, p. 337. Although the mid-day forecast indicated some deterioration in the situation, this was not considered to be alarming enough to cancel the planned voyage. A course was planned which would take R101 over London, Paris and Toulouse, crossing the French coast near Narbonne. Fine rain was beginning to fall when, at dusk, with all the crew and passengers aboard, the R101 readied for departure. Under the illuminating spotlights, the jettisoning of water ballast to bring the airship into trim was clearly visible. Squadron Leader Booth, the commander of R100, was watching the departure from the tower's observation gallery and estimated that two tons had been discharged from the nose and a further ton from the midships tanks.Masefield 1982, p. 350. R101 cast off from the mast at 18:36 GMT to a cheer from the crowd which had gathered to witness the event, gently backed from the tower and, as another ton of ballast was jettisoned, the engines were opened up to about half power and the airship slowly began to climb away, initially heading northeast to fly over Bedford before making a 180¬∞ turn to port to pass north of Cardington. At about 19:06 the duty engineer in the aft engine car reported an apparent oil pressure problem. At 19:16 he shut the engine down, and after a short discussion with the chief engineer, work began to replace the oil gauge, since there was nothing apparently wrong with the engine. With one engine stopped, airspeed was reduced by around to Masefield 1982, p. 373. At 19:19, having flown but still only from Cardington, a course was set for London. At 20:01, R101, by now over Potters Bar, made its second report to Cardington, confirming the intention to proceed via London, Paris and Narbonne, but making no mention of the engine problem. By that point, the weather had deteriorated, and it was raining heavily. Flying around above the ground, it passed over Alexandra Palace before changing course slightly at the landmark clock tower of the Metropolitan Cattle Market north of Islington, and thence over Shoreditch to cross the Thames in the vicinity of the Isle of Dogs, passing over the Royal Naval College at Greenwich at 20:28. The airship‚Äôs progress, flying with its nose pointing some 30 degrees to the right of its track, was observed by many who braved the rain to watch it pass overhead. An update of the meteorological situation was received at 20:40.Masefield 1982, p. 376. The forecast had deteriorated severely, south-westerly winds of up to with low cloud and rain being predicted for northern France, and similar conditions over central France. That this caused concern on board is demonstrated by the request for more detailed information, which was transmitted at 21:19, by which time R101 was near Hawkhurst in Kent. It is possible that an alternative course was being considered. At 21:35 R101 crossed the English coast near Hastings and at 21:40 transmitted a progress report back to Cardington, mentioning that recovery of rainwater into the ballast tanks was taking place but again not reporting the engine problem. At 22:56 the aft engine was restarted. By now the wind had risen to about with strong gusts, but a further meteorological report received shortly after the airship had crossed the coast had been encouraging about weather conditions south of Paris.Masefield 1982, p. 383. The French coast was crossed at the Point de St Quentin at 23:36 GMT, around east of the intended landfall.Masefield 1982, p. 389. A new course was set to bring R101 over Orly, based on an estimated wind direction of 245 degrees and speed of . The intended course would have taken R101 four miles west of Beauvais, but the estimated wind speed and direction were inaccurate, as a result of which the R101's track was to the east of its intended course. This error would have become apparent when, at about 01:00, R101 passed over Poix-de-Picardie, a distinctive hilltop town that would have been readily recognisable to the navigation officer, Squadron Leader E.L. Johnston. Accordingly, R101 changed course: the new course would take it directly over the Beauvais Ridge, an area notorious for turbulent wind conditions.Masefield 1982, p. 396. R101 memorial in Cardington At 02:00 the watch was changed, Second Officer Maurice Steff taking over the command from Irwin. The R101 was at this point \\"flying heavy\\", relying on dynamic lift generated by forward airspeed to maintain altitude, estimated by the Board of Inquiry as at least above the ground.Report of the R101 Inquiry 1931, p. 81. At about 02:07 R101 went into a dive from which it slowly recovered, probably losing around . As it did so Rigger S. Church, who was returning to the crew quarters to come off duty, was sent forward to release the forward emergency ballast bags, which were locally controlled. This first dive was steep enough to cause A. H. Leech, the Foreman Engineer from Cardington, to be thrown from his seat in the smoking room and to wake Chief Electrician Arthur Disley, who was dozing in the switch room next to the chart cabin. As the airship recovered, Disley was roused by Chief Coxswain G. W. Hunt, who then went to the crew quarters, calling out \\"We're down, lads\\" in warning. As this happened the airship went into a second dive and orders to reduce speed to slow (450 rpm) were received in the engine cars. Before Engineer A. J. Cook, on duty in the left-hand midships engine car, could respond, the airship hit the ground at the edge of a wood outside Allonne southeast of Beauvais and immediately caught fire. The reason for the order to reduce speed is a matter for conjecture because this would have caused the airship to lose dynamic lift and adopt a nose-down attitude. The subsequent inquiry estimated the impact speed at around , with the airship between 15¬∞ and 25¬∞ nose down.Report of the R101 Inquiry1931, p. 79. Unveiling of the memorial to the victims of the R101 disaster outside Allonne A plaque in the Palace of Westminster commemorating the crash Forty- six of the 54 passengers and crew were killed immediately. Church and Rigger W. G. Radcliffe survived the crash but later died in hospital in Beauvais, bringing the total of dead to 48. = Memorials = The bodies were returned to England, and on Friday 10 October a memorial service took place at St Paul's Cathedral while the bodies lay in state in Westminster Hall at the Palace of Westminster. Nearly 90,000 people queued to pay their respects: at one time the queue was half a mile long, and the hall was kept open until 00:35 to admit them all.

The inquiry, held in public, opened on 28 October and spent 10 days taking evidence from witnesses, including Professor Leonard Bairstow and Dr. Hugo Eckener of the Zeppelin company, before adjourning in order to allow Bairstow and the NPL to perform more detailed calculations based on wind-tunnel tests on a specially made model of R101 in its final form. This evidence was presented over three days ending on 5 December 1930. The final report was presented on 27 March 1931. The inquiry examined most aspects of the design and construction of R101 in detail, with particular emphasis on the gasbags and the associated harnessing and valves, although very little examination of the problems that had been encountered with the cover was made. All the technical witnesses provided unhesitating endorsement of the airworthiness of the airship prior to its flight to India. An examination was also made of the various operational decisions that had been made before the airship undertook its final voyage. NPL diagram of possible R101 flight path The possibility of the crash having been the result of a prolonged loss of gas caused by leakage or loss through the valves was discounted since this explanation did not explain the airship's behaviour during its last moments: moreover the fact that the officers on duty had changed watch routinely implied that there had been no particular cause for alarm a few minutes before the crash. The recent change of watch was considered to be a possible contributory factor to the accident, since the new crew would not have had time to get the feel of the airship. It was also considered most unlikely that the accident had been solely caused by a sudden downdraught. A sudden and catastrophic failure was seen as the only explanation. The inquiry discounted the possibility of structural failure of the airframe. The only major fracture found in the wreckage was at the rear of the new framework extension but it was considered that this had either occurred on impact or more probably been caused by the intense heat of the subsequent fire. The inquiry came to the conclusion that a tear had probably developed in the forward cover, this in turn causing one or more of the forward gasbags to fail. Evidence presented by Professor Bairstow showed that this would cause the R101 to become too nose-heavy for the elevators to correct.\\"R101 Inquiry.\\" Flight, 12 December 1930, p. 1446. Retrieved: 4 March 2012. The want of sufficient altitude was considered by the R101 Enquiry and must be considered given that the aircraft was flying in an area of reducing atmospheric pressure. The same evening the Graf Zeppelin at Frankfort was reading 400 feet high. A similar error over France would have put the R101 400 feet lower than her intended height.Higham, Robin. The British Rigid Airship, 1908‚Äì1931. G.T. Foulis & Co Ltd, London, UK 1961, p 315 The altimeter could have been corrected while flying across the channel by timing the flare drop before ignition but over France there was no way to determine altimeter correction. Sightings by observers reporting very low altitudes across France and the belief by the crew that they were at a safe altitude according to the altimeter could both be true. The question of sufficient altitude was considered by the R101 Enquiry but not the attendant issue of altimeter correction.Report of the R101 Inquiry, 1931, p. 90. The cause of the fire was not established. Several hydrogen airships had crashed in similar circumstances without catching fire. The inquiry thought that it was most probable that a spark from the airship's electrics had ignited escaping hydrogen, causing an explosion. Other suggestions put forward included the ignition of the calcium flares carried in the control car on contact with water,Chamberlain 1984, pp. 174‚Äì178. electrostatic discharge or a fire in one of the engine cars, which carried petrol for the starter engines. All that is certain is that it caught fire almost at once and burned fiercely. In the extreme heat, the fuel oil from the wreck soaked into the ground and caught fire; it was still burning when the first party of officials arrived by air the next day.Leasor 1958, p. 151. The inquiry considered that it was \\"impossible to avoid the conclusion that the R101 would not have started for India on the evening of October 4th if it had not been that matters of public policy were considered as making it highly desirable that she should do so\\", but considered this to be the result of all concerned being eager to prove the worth of R101, rather than direct interference from above.Report of the R101 Inquiry, 1931, p. 95. Aftermath The crash of R101 ended British interest in dirigibles during the pre-war period.

The airship's competitor, R100, despite a more successful development programme and a satisfactory, although not entirely trouble-free, transatlantic trial flight, was grounded immediately after R101 crashed. The R100 remained in its hangar at Cardington for a year whilst the fate of the Imperial Airship programme was decided. In November 1931, the R100 was broken up and sold for scrap.\\"Breaking Up the R101.\\" Flight, 11 December 1931. At the time, the Imperial Airship Scheme was a controversial project because of the large sums of public money involved and because some doubted the utility of airships.Swinfield 2012, p.146 Subsequently, there has been controversy about the R101's merits. The extremely poor relationship between the R100 team and both Cardington and the Air Ministry created a climate of resentment and jealousy that may have rankled. Neville Shute's autobiography was serialised by the Sunday Graphic on its publication in 1954 and was misleadingly promoted as containing sensational revelations,\\"Advertisement.\\" Flight, 5 March 1954. and the accuracy of his account is a cause of contention among airship historians.Swinfield 2012, p.141 Barnes Wallis later expressed scathing criticism of the design although they may in part reflect personal animosities. Nevertheless, his listing of Richmond's \\"overweening vanity\\" as a major cause of the debacle and the fact that he had not designed it as another say little for his objectivity.Morpurgo 1982, p. 187.

A femme fatale ( or ; ), sometimes called a maneater or vamp, is a stock character of a mysterious, beautiful, and seductive woman whose charms ensnare her lovers, often leading them into compromising, deadly traps. She is an archetype of literature and art. Her ability to enchant, entice and hypnotize her victim with a spell was in the earliest stories seen as being literally supernatural; hence, the femme fatale today is still often described as having a power akin to an enchantress, seductress, witch, having power over men. In Virginia Allen's opinion, one of the most common traits of the femme fatale includes promiscuity and the \\"rejection of motherhood\\", seen as \\"one of her most threatening qualities since by denying his immortality and his posterity it leads to the ultimate destruction of the male\\". Femmes fatales are typically villainous, or at least morally ambiguous, and always associated with a sense of mystification, and unease.Mary Ann Doane, Femme Fatales (1991) pp. 1‚Äì2 In American early 20th century films, femme fatale characters were referred to as vamps, in reference to Theda Bara, who played a seductive woman referred to as a \\"vampire\\" in the 1915 film A Fool There Was. Many female mobsters (especially members of the Italian-American Mafia or Russian Mafia) have been known to be femme fatales in many films noir as well as James Bond films. The phrase is French for \\"fatal woman\\". A femme fatale tries to achieve her hidden purpose by using feminine wiles such as beauty, charm, or sexual allure. In many cases, her attitude towards sexuality is lackadaisical, intriguing, or frivolous. In some cases, she uses lies or coercion rather than charm. She may also make use of some subduing weapon such as sleeping gas, a modern analog of magical powers in older tales. She may also be (or imply that she is) a victim, caught in a situation from which she cannot escape; The Lady from Shanghai (a 1947 film noir) is one such example. A younger or underage version of a femme fatale is called a fille fatale, or \\"fatal girl\\". History =Ancient archetypes= The divine femme fatale of Hindu mythology, Mohini is described to have enchanted gods, demons and sages alike. The femme fatale archetype exists in the culture, folklore and myths of many cultures.Mario Praz, The Romantic Agony, ch. IV, p. 199: La Belle Dame sans Merci (The Beautiful Lady without Mercy). London/New York, 1933‚Äì1951‚Äì1970 (Oxford University Press). Ancient mythical or legendary examples include Lilith, Mohini, Circe, Medea, Clytemnestra, Lesbia, Tamamo no Mae and Visha Kanyas. Historical examples from Classical times include Cleopatra and Messalina, as well as the Biblical figures Delilah, Jezebel, and Salome.Mario Praz (1970) The Romantic Agony. Oxford University Press: 199, 213‚Äì216, 222, 250, 258, 259, 272, 277, 282, 377 An example from Chinese literature and traditional history is Daji. =Early Western culture to the 19th century= Salome in a 1906 painting by Franz von Stuck The femme fatale was a common figure in the European Middle Ages, often portraying the dangers of unbridled female sexuality. The pre-medieval inherited Biblical figure of Eve offers an example, as does the wicked, seductive enchantress typified in Morgan le Fay. The Queen of the Night in Mozart's The Magic Flute shows her more muted presence during the Age of EnlightenmentC. G. Jung ed, Man and his Symbols (1978) p. 187 The femme fatale flourished in the Romantic period in the works of John Keats, notably \\"La Belle Dame sans Merci\\" and \\"Lamia\\". Along with them, there rose the gothic novel The Monk featuring Matilda, a very powerful femme fatale. This led to her appearing in the work of Edgar Allan Poe, and as the vampire, notably in Carmilla and Brides of Dracula. The Monk was greatly admired by the Marquis de Sade, for whom the femme fatale symbolised not evil, but all the best qualities of women; his novel Juliette is perhaps the earliest wherein the femme fatale triumphs. Pre-Raphaelite painters frequently used the classic personifications of the femme fatale as a subject. In the Western culture of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the femme fatale became a more fashionable trope,Jill Scott, Electra after Freud (2005) p. 66 and she is found in the paintings of the artists Edvard Munch, Gustav Klimt, Franz von Stuck and Gustave Moreau. The novel √Ä rebours by Joris-Karl Huysmans includes these fevered imaginings about an image of Salome in a Moreau painting:Huysmans √Ä rebours ‚Äì Toni Bentley (2002) Sisters of Salome: 24 She also is seen as a prominent figure in late nineteenth and twentieth century opera, appearing in Richard Wagner's Parsifal (Kundry), Georges Bizet's \\"Carmen\\", Camille Saint-Sa√´ns' \\"Samson et Delilah\\" and Alban Berg's \\"Lulu\\" (based on the plays \\"Erdgeist\\" and \\"Die B√ºchse der Pandora\\" by Frank Wedekind). In fin-de-si√®cle decadence, Oscar Wilde reinvented the femme fatale in the play Salome: she manipulates her lust-crazed uncle, King Herod, with her enticing Dance of the Seven Veils (Wilde's invention) to agree to her imperious demand: \\"bring me the head of John the Baptist\\". Later, Salome was the subject of an opera by Strauss, and was popularized on stage, screen, and peep-show booth in countless reincarnations.Toni Bentley (2002) Sisters of Salome Another enduring icon of glamour, seduction, and moral turpitude is Margaretha Geertruida Zelle. While working as an exotic dancer, she took the stage name Mata Hari. She was accused of German espionage and was put to death by a French firing squad. After her death she became the subject of many sensational films and books. Other considerably famous femmes fatales are Isabella of France, Hedda Gabler of Kristiania (now Oslo), Marie Antoinette of Austria, and, most famously, Lucrezia Borgia. =20th-century genres= Alice Hollister, the \\"original vampire\\" of the screen Actress Theda Bara, in the film A Fool There Was. One traditional view portrays the femme fatale as a sexual vampire; her charms leech the virility and independence of lovers, leaving them shells of themselves. Rudyard Kipling took inspiration from a vampire painted by Philip Burne-Jones, an image typical of the era in 1897, to write his poem \\"The Vampire\\". The poem inspired the 1913 eponymous film The Vampire by Robert Vignola, often cited as the earliest surviving \\"vamp\\" movie.John T. Soister, American Silent Horror, Science Fiction and Fantasy Feature Films, 1913‚Äì1929, McFarland, 2012, p. 41 Protagonist Alice Hollister was often labeled as \\"the original vampire\\" at the time. Like much of Kipling's verse it became very popular, and its refrain: \\"A fool there was...\\", describing a seduced man, became the title of the popular 1915 film A Fool There Was that made Theda Bara a star. The poem was used in the publicity for the film. On this account, in the American slang of the era the femme fatale was called a vamp, short for vampire.Per the Oxford English Dictionary, vamp is originally English, used first by G. K. Chesterton, but popularized in the American silent film The Vamp, starring Enid Bennett\\"Vamp\\", Oxford English Dictionary; retrieved 30 December 2016 Femmes fatales appear in detective fiction, especially in its 'hard-boiled' sub-genre which largely originated with the crime stories of Dashiell Hammett in the 1920s. At the end of that decade, the French-Canadian villainess Marie de Sabrevois gave a contemporary edge to the otherwise very historical novels of Kenneth Roberts set during the war for U.S. independence. For film audiences, too, the villainess often appeared foreign, usually either of indeterminate Eastern European or Asian ancestry. She was the sexual counterpart to wholesome actresses such as Lillian Gish and Mary Pickford. Notable silent-cinema vamps included Theda Bara, Helen Gardner, Louise Glaum, Valeska Suratt, Musidora, Virginia Pearson, Olga Petrova, Rosemary Theby, Nita Naldi, Pola Negri, Estelle Taylor, Jetta Goudal, and, in early appearances, Myrna Loy. The story \\"Temptress of the Tower of Torture and Sin\\" is illustrated on the cover of the Avon Fantasy Reader. During the film-noir era of the 1940s and early-1950s, the femme fatale flourished in American cinema. Examples include Brigid O'Shaughnessy, portrayed by Mary Astor, who murders Sam Spade's partner in The Maltese Falcon (1941); manipulative narcissistic daughter Veda (portrayed by Ann Blyth) in Mildred Pierce who exploits her indulgent mother Mildred (portrayed by Joan Crawford) and fatally destroys her mother's remarriage to stepfather Monte Barragon (portrayed by Zachary Scott); Gene Tierney as Ellen Brent Harland in Leave Her to Heaven (1945), and the cabaret singer portrayed by Rita Hayworth in Gilda (1946), narcissistic wives who manipulate their husbands; Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) in Double Indemnity (1944), Ava Gardner in The Killers and Cora (Lana Turner) in The Postman Always Rings Twice, based on novels by Ernest Hemingway and James M. Cain respectively, manipulate men into killing their husbands. In the Hitchcock film The Paradine Case (1947), Alida Valli's character causes the deaths of two men and the near destruction of another. Another frequently cited example is the character Jane played by Lizabeth Scott in Too Late for Tears (1949); during her quest to keep some dirty money from its rightful recipient and her husband, she uses poison, lies, sexual teasing and a gun to keep men wrapped around her finger. Jane Greer remains notable as a murderous femme fatale using her wiles on Robert Mitchum in Out of the Past (1947). In Hitchcock's 1940 film and Daphne du Maurier's 1938 novel Rebecca, the eponymous femme fatale completely dominates the plot, even though she is already dead and we never see an image of her. Rocky and Bullwinkle's Natasha Fatale, a curvaceous spy, takes her name from the femme fatale stock character.

Along with Beren Erchamion and Aragorn, Tuor was one of only three Men ever to marry one of the Eldarin Elves. Tuor's story is one of many told briefly in the 23rd chapter of The Silmarillion. A very early version, written circa 1916‚Äì17, is found in The Book of Lost Tales II, part of The History of Middle-earth. Unfinished Tales contains the start of a more mature and complete narrative, which Tolkien began after finishing The Lord of the Rings in the 1950s. However, it gets no further than Tuor's first sight of Gondolin.  Fictional biography Tuor was a great hero of the Third House of Men in the First Age, the only son of Huor and R√≠an and the cousin of T√∫rin Turambar. Huor was slain covering the retreat of Turgon, King of Gondolin, in the N√≠rnaeth Arnoediad in . R√≠an, having received no tidings of her husband, became distraught and wandered into the wild. She was taken care of by the local Grey-elves, and before the end of the year she bore a son and called him Tuor. But she delivered him to the care of the Elves and departed, dying upon the Haudh-en-Ndengin. Tuor was fostered by the Elves in the caves of Androth in the Mountains of Mithrim, living a hard and wary life. When Tuor was sixteen their leader Annael resolved to forsake the land, but during the march his people were scattered and Tuor was captured by the Easterlings, who had been sent there by Morgoth and who cruelly oppressed the remnant of the House of Hador. After three years of thraldom under Lorgan the Easterling, Tuor escaped and returned to the caves. The Wedding of Tuor and Idril For four years he lived as an outlaw, but never saw a way of escape from Dor-l√≥min; he slew many of the Easterlings that he came upon during his journeys, and Tuor's name was feared. Meanwhile, Ulmo, Vala of Waters, heard of his plight and chose Tuor to bear a message to Turgon, Lord of the Hidden City of Gondolin, and give a hope for the Elves and Men. By Ulmo's power a spring near Tuor's cave overflowed, and following the stream Tuor passed through Dor-l√≥min to Ered L√≥min. Under the guidance of two Elves sent there by Ulmo, Gelmir and Arminas, he passed through the ancient Gate of the Noldor (Sindarin Annon-in- Gelydh) into Nevrast, where Tuor is said to have been the first Man to come to the shore of the Great Sea, Belegaer the shoreless. Thence he was led by seven swans, and came at last to the old dwellings of Turgon at Vinyamar. Tuor found arms and armour in the ruins of Vinyamar left there centuries ago by Turgon at the command of Ulmo, and then met Ulmo himself at the coast of Belegaer. He appointed Tuor to be his messenger and told him to seek King Turgon in Gondolin, and sent him an Elf Voronw√´, saved by Ulmo from a shipwreck, to guide him. Voronw√´ led Tuor along the southern slopes of Ered Wethrin, and they caught a brief glimpse of Tuor's cousin T√∫rin near the Pools of Ivrin, the only time the paths of the two ever crossed. Journeying through the fell winter, they eventually reached Gondolin in Y.S. 495. They were admitted, but Turgon did not hearken to the counsel of Ulmo and would not forsake the Hidden City. Tuor remained in Gondolin, and married Turgon's daughter, Idril Celebrindal. This was the second union between the Elves and Men, after Beren and L√∫thien. Their only child was E√§rendil the Mariner. Tuor was the leader of the House of the Swan Wing, one of the twelve houses of Gondolin, and won the hearts of the Gondolindrim. During the sack of the city, Tuor defended his wife and son from Orcs and Maeglin, whom he slew. With the remnant of the people of Gondolin he escaped the sacking of the city by a secret way contrived by Idril, encountering a Balrog in the mountain heights; saved but by the valour of Glorfindel, chief of the House of the Golden Flower. At last they reached Nan-tathren and the Mouths of Sirion. Tuor eventually felt a longing for the Sea, and built the ship E√§rram√´ (Sea-wing). The Mouths of Sirion were now held by E√§rendil and Elwing, but Tuor sailed to the West with Idril, and it was a tradition under the Eldar and Edain that they arrived in Valinor, bypassing the Ban of the Valar, and that Tuor alone of Men was counted as Elven kindred, still living there now. In a letter Tolkien indicated that Tuor's \\"conversion\\" was allowed by Eru Il√∫vatar as a unique exception, just like L√∫thien's assumption of a mortal fate.  Concept and creation  In the original Fall of Gondolin Tuor is said to have carried an axe, called Dramborleg \\"Thudder-Sharp\\", that \\"smote both a heavy dint as of a club and cleft as a sword\\". The Axe of Tuor is referred to in later writings as preserved in N√∫menor as an heirloom of the Kings, though the name must have been rejected as unfitting later language conceptions. In early versions of the story Tuor was supposed to have travelled all the way from Dor-l√≥min along the shores of the Sea to the Mouths of Sirion. There he met Voronw√´ (or \\"Bronweg\\"), and in Nan-tathren Ulmo appeared to them. The journey to Gondolin was thus up the River Sirion. In some texts Tolkien spells his name T√ªr, but finally decided on Tuor. Samuel Cook, writing in Anor, stated the case for Tuor as a forgotten hero, equal to the better-known Beren and T√∫rin.

They are the primary onhill transport at most ski areas (in such cases referred to as 'skilifts'), but are also found at amusement parks, various tourist attractions, and increasingly in urban transport. Depending on carrier size and loading efficiency, a passenger ropeway can move up to 4000 people per hour, and the fastest lifts achieve operating speeds of up to or . The two-person double chair, which for many years was the workhorse of the ski industry, can move roughly 1200 people per hour at rope speeds of up to . The four person detachable chairlift (\\"high-speed quad\\") can transport 2400 people per hour with an average rope speed of . Some bi and tri cable elevated ropeways and reversible tramways achieve much greater operating speeds. Design and function The Short Cut fixed triple chairlift at Park City Mountain Resort in Park City, Utah Chairlifts in Murree, Pakistan. A chairlift consists of numerous components to provide safe efficient transport. =Terminology= Especially at American ski areas, chairlifts are referred to with a ski industry vernacular. A one-person lift is a \\"single\\", a two-person lift is a \\"double\\", a three-person lift a ‚Äútriple‚Äù, four-person lifts are ‚Äúquads‚Äù, and a six-person lift is a \\"six pack\\". If the lift is a detachable chairlift, it is typically referred to as a ‚Äúhigh-speed‚Äù lift, which results in a ‚Äúhigh-speed quad‚Äù or ‚Äúhigh-speed six pack‚Äù. ;rope speed: the speed in feet per minute or meters per second at which the rope moves ;[load] interval: the spacing between carriers, measured either by distance or time ;capacity: the number of passengers the lift transports per hour ;efficiency: the ratio of fully loaded carriers during peak operation, usually expressed as a percentage of capacity. Because fixed grip lifts move faster than detachables at load and unload, misloads (and missed unloads) are more frequent on fixed grips, and can reduce the efficiency as low as 80%. ;fixed grip: each carrier is fastened to a fixed point on the rope ;detachable grip: each carrier's grip opens and closes during regular operation allowing detachment from the rope and travel slowly for load and unload. Detachable grips allow a greater rope speed to be used, usually twice that of a fixed grip chair, while simultaneously having slower loading and unloading sections. See detachable chairlift. The capacity of a lift is constrained by the motive power (prime mover), the rope speed, the carrier spacing, the vertical displacement, and the number of carriers on the rope (a function of the rope length). Human passengers can load only so quickly until loading efficiency decreases; usually an interval of at least five seconds is needed. =Rope= The rope is the defining characteristic of an elevated passenger ropeway. The rope stretches and contracts as the tension exerted upon it increases and decreases, and it bends and flexes as it passes over sheaves and around the bullwheels. The fibre core contains a lubricant which protects the rope from corrosion and also allows for smooth flexing operation. The rope must be regularly lubricated to ensure safe operation and long life. Various techniques are used for constructing the rope. Dozens of wires are wound into a strand. Several strands are wound around a textile core, their twist is oriented in the same or opposite direction as the individual wires; this is referred to as Lang lay and regular lay respectively. Rope is constructed in a linear fashion, and must be spliced together before carriers are affixed. Splicing involves unwinding long sections of either end of the rope, and then winding each strand from opposing ends around the core. Sections of rope must be removed, as the strands overlap during the splicing process. =Terminals and towers= Italian chairlift's upper terminal with the return bullwheel. This type of terminal is usually used for non-detachable chairlifts. Lifting a rebuilt sheave assembly back into place, S-lift, Copper Mountain (Colorado). Every lift involves at least two terminals and may also have intermediate supporting towers. A bullwheel in each terminal redirects the rope, while sheaves (pulley assemblies) on the towers support the rope well above the ground. The number of towers is engineered based on the length and strength of the rope, worst case environmental conditions, and the type of terrain traversed. The bullwheel with the prime mover is called the drive bullwheel; the other is the return bullwheel. Chairlifts are usually electrically powered, often with Diesel or gasoline engine backup, and sometimes a hand crank tertiary backup. Drive terminals can be located either at the top or the bottom of an installation; though the top-drive configuration is more efficient,Greater top-drive efficiency assumes the chairlift predominantly moves passengers uphill. practicalities of electric service might dictate bottom-drive. Braking systems The drive terminal is also the location of a lift's primary braking system. The service brake is located on the drive shaft beside the main drive, before the gearbox. The emergency brake acts directly on the bullwheel. While not technically a brake, an anti-rollback device (usually a cam) also acts on the bullwheel. This prevents the potentially disastrous situation of runaway reverse operation.See a disastrous failed rollback test at Winter Park, Colorado in 1990 Chairlift Rollback Test Tensioning system The rope must be tensioned to compensate for sag caused by wind load and passenger weight, variations in rope length due to temperature and to maintain friction between the rope and the drive bullwheel. Tension is provided either by a counterweight system or by hydraulic or pneumatic rams, which adjust the position of the bullwheel carriage to maintain design tension. For most chairlifts, the tension is measured in tons. =Prime mover and gearbox= Chairlift in Praz de Lys-Sommand, Haute-Savoie, France Either Diesel engines or electric motors can function as prime movers. The power can range from under 7.5 kW (10 hp) for the smallest of lifts, to more than 750 kW (1000 hp) for a long, swift, detachable eight-seat up a steep slope. DC electric motors and DC drives are the most common, though AC motors and AC drives are becoming economically competitive for certain smaller chairlift installations. DC drives are less expensive than AC variable- frequency drives and were used almost exclusively until the 21st century when costs of AC variable-frequency drive technology dropped. DC motors produce more starting torque than AC motors, so applications of AC motors on chairlifts is largely limited to smaller chairlift installations, otherwise the AC motor would need to be significantly oversized relative to the equivalent horsepower DC motor. The driveshaft turns at high RPM, but with lower torque. The gearbox transforms high RPM/low torque rotation into a low RPM/high torque drive at the bullwheel. More power is able to pull heavier loads or sustain a higher rope speed (the power of a force is the rate at which it does work, and is given by the product of the driving force and the cable velocity) . Secondary and auxiliary movers In most localities, the prime mover is required to have a backup drive; this is usually provided by a Diesel engine that can operate during power outages. The purpose of the backup is to permit clearing the rope to ensure the safety of passengers; it usually is much less powerful and is not used for normal operation. The secondary drive connects with the drive shaft before the gear box, usually with a chain coupling. Some chairlifts are also equipped with an auxiliary drive, to be used to continue regular operation in the event of a problem with the prime mover. Some lifts even have a hydrostatic coupling so the driveshaft of a snowcat can drive the chairlift. =Carriers and grips= Carriers are designed to seat 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 passengers. Each is connected to the cable with a steel cable grip that is either clamped onto or woven into the cable. Clamping systems use either a bolt system or coiled spring or magnets to provide clamping force. For maintenance or servicing, the carriers may be removed from or relocated along the rope by loosening the grip. Restraining bar Chairlifts at Patriata, Pakistan A 6-year old skier in a chairlift. Also called a retention bar or safety bar, these may help hold passengers in the chair in the same way as a safety bar in an amusement park ride. If equipped, each chair has a retractable bar, sometimes with attached foot rests. In most configurations, a passenger may reach up and behind their head, grab the bar or a handle, and pull the restraint forward and down. Once the bar has swung sufficiently, gravity assists positioning the bar to its down limit. Before disembarking, the bar must be swung up, out of the way. The physics of a passenger sitting properly in a chairlift do not require use of a restraining bar. If the chairlift stops suddenly (as from use of the system emergency brake), the carrier's arm connecting to the grip pivots smoothly forward‚Äîdriven by the chair's inertia‚Äîand maintains friction (and seating angle) between the seat and passenger. The restraining bar is useful for children‚Äîwho do not fit comfortably into adult sized chairs‚Äîas well as apprehensive passengers, and for those who are disinclined or unable to sit still. In addition, restraining bars with footrests reduce muscle fatigue from supporting the weight of a snowboard or skis, especially during long lift rides. The restraining bar is also useful in very strong wind and when the chair is coated by ice. Some ski areas mandate the use of safety bars on dangerous or windy lifts, with forfeiture of the lift ticket as a penalty. Vermont and Massachusetts state law also require the use of safety bars, as well as most Ontario and Quebec in Canada. Restraining bars (almost always with foot rests) on chairlifts are more common in Europe and also naturally used by passengers of all ages. Some chairlifts have restraining bars that open and close automatically. Canopy Some lifts also have individual canopies which can be lowered to protect against inclement weather. The canopy, or bubble, is usually constructed of transparent acrylic glass or fiberglass. In most designs, passenger legs are unprotected; however in rain or strong wind this is considerably more comfortable than no canopy. Among more notable bubble lifts are the Ramcharger 8 at Big Sky Resort, North America's first high speed eight pack; and the longest bubble lift in the world is the American Flyer high speed six pack at Copper Mountain. =Control system= To maintain safe operation, the chairlift's control system monitors sensors and controls system parameters. Expected variances are compensated for; out-of-limit and dangerous conditions cause system shutdown. In the unusual instance of system shutdown, inspection by technicians, repair or evacuation might be needed. Both fixed and detachable lifts have sensors to monitor rope speed and hold it within established limits for each defined system operating speed. Also, the minimum and maximum rope tension, and speed feedback redundancy are monitored. Many‚Äîif not most‚Äîinstallations have numerous safety sensors which detect rare but potentially hazardous situations, such as the rope coming out of an individual sheave. Detachable chairlift control systems measure carrier grip tension during each detach and attach cycle, verify proper carrier spacing and verify correct movement of the detached carriers through the terminals. =Safety systems= Aerial lifts have a variety of mechanisms to ensure safe operation over a lifetime often measured in decades. In June 1990, Winter Park Resort performed planned destructive safety testing on Eskimo, a 1963 Riblet Tramway Company two-chair, center-pole fixed grip lift, as it was slated for removal and replacement with a high-speed quad Poma lift. The destructive testing attempted to mimic potential real-life operating scenarios, including tests for braking, rollback, oily rope, tree on line, fire, and tower pull. The data gleaned from this destructive safety testing helped improve the safety and construction of both existing as well as the next generation of chairlifts. Braking As mentioned above, there are multiple redundant braking systems. When a Normal Stop is activated from the control panel, the lift will be slowed and stopped using regenerative braking through the electric motor and the service brake located on the highspeed shaft between the gearbox and electric motor. When an Emergency Stop is activated all power is cut to the motor and the emergency brake or bull-wheel brake is activated. In the case of a rollback, some lifts utilize a ratchet like system to prevent the bull-wheel from spinning backwards while newer installations utilize sensors which activate one or more bull-wheel brakes. All braking systems are fail-safe in that a loss of power or hydraulic pressure will activate the brake. Older chairlifts, for example 1960s-era Riblet Tramway Company lifts, have a hydraulic release emergency brake with pressure maintained by a hydraulic solenoid. If the emergency brake/stop button is depressed by any control panel, the lift cannot be restarted until the hydraulic brake is hand-pumped to proper operating pressure. Brittle bars Example of a brittle bar within a cable catcher beside a sheave train. Wiring connected to the brittle bar is visible immediately to the right of the closest sheave. An anti-derailment plate is visible at top. Some installations use brittle bars to detect several hazardous situations. Brittle bars alongside the sheaves detect the rope coming out of the track. They may also be placed to detect counterweight or hydraulic ram movement beyond safe parameters (sometimes called a brittle fork in this usage) and to detect detached carriers leaving the terminal's track. If a brittle bar breaks, it interrupts a circuit which causes the system controller to immediately stop the system. Cable catcher These are small hooks sometimes installed next to sheaves to catch the rope and prevent it from falling if it should come out of the track. They are designed to allow passage of chair grips while the lift is stopping and for evacuation. It is extremely rare for the rope to leave the sheaves. In May 2006, a cable escaped the sheaves on the Arthurs Seat, Victoria chairlift in Australia causing four chairs to crash into one another. No one was injured, though 13 passengers were stranded for four hours. The operator blamed mandated changes in the height of some towers to improve clearance over a road. Collision Passenger loading and unloading is supervised by lift operators. Their primary purpose is to ensure passenger safety by checking that passengers are suitably outfitted for the elements and not wearing or transporting items which could entangle chairs, towers, trees, etc. If a misload or missed unload occurs‚Äîor is imminent‚Äîthey slow or stop the lift to prevent carriers from colliding with or dragging any person. Also, if the exit area becomes congested, they will slow or stop the chair until safe conditions are established. Communication The lift operators at the terminals of a chairlift communicate with each other to verify that all terminals are safe and ready when restarting the system. Communication is also used to warn of an arriving carrier with a passenger missing a ski, or otherwise unable to efficiently unload, such as patients being transported in a rescue toboggan. These uses are the chief purpose for a visible identification number on each carrier. Evacuation Aerial ropeways always have several backup systems in the event of failure of the prime mover. An additional electric motor, diesel or gasoline engine‚Äîeven a hand crank‚Äîallows movement of the rope to eventually unload passengers. In the event of a failure which prevents rope movement, ski patrol may conduct emergency evacuation using a simple rope harness looped over the aerial ropeway to lower passengers to the ground one by one. Grounding A steel line strung alongside a mountain is likely to attract lightning strikes. To protect against that and electrostatic buildup, all components of the system are electrically bonded together and connected to one or many grounding systems connecting the lift system to earth ground. In areas subject to frequent electrical strikes, a protective aerial line is fixed above the aerial ropeway. A red sheave may indicate it is a grounding sheave. Load testing Old double chair lift in Western New York In most jurisdictions, chairlifts must be load inspected and tested periodically. The typical test consists of loading the uphill chairs with bags of water (secured in boxes) weighing more than the worst case passenger loading scenario. The system's ability to start, stop, and forestall reverse operation are carefully evaluated against the system's design parameters. Load testing a new lift is shown in a short video. Rope testing Frequent visual inspection of the rope is required in most jurisdictions, as well as periodic non-destructive testing. Electromagnetic induction testing detects and quantifies hidden adverse conditions within the strands such as a broken wire, pitting caused by corrosion or wear, variations in cross sectional area, and tightening or loosening of wire lay or strand lay. Safety gate A safety gate at the top terminal detects passengers failing to unload. An open restraining bar is also visible. If a passenger fails to unload, their legs will contact a lightweight bar, line, or pass through a light beam which stops the lift. The lift operator will then help them disembark, reset the safety gate, and initiate the lift restart procedure. While possibly annoying to other passengers on the chairlift, it is preferable to strike the safety gate‚Äîthat is, it should not be avoided‚Äîand stop the lift than be an unexpected downhill passenger. Many lifts are limited in their download capacity; others can transport passengers at 100 percent capacity in either direction.entry for Download at SkiLifts glossary Moving walkways The boarding area of a detachable chairlift can be fitted with a moving walkway which takes the passengers from the entrance gate to the boarding area. This ensures the correct, safe and quick boarding of all passengers. For fixed grip lifts, a walkway can be designed so that it moves at a slightly slower speed than the chairs: passengers stand on the moving walkway while their chair approaches, hence easing the boarding process since the relative speed of the chairlift will be slower. History Early single chair on alt=A metal chair, painted green, with footrest and wooden seat suspended above a grassy area by a metal pole on the right side Aerial passenger ropeways were known in Asia well before the 17th century for crossing chasms in mountainous regions. Men would traverse a woven fiber line hand over hand. Evolutionary refinement added a harness or basket to also transport cargo. The first recorded mechanical ropeway was by Venetian Fausto Veranzio who designed a bicable passenger ropeway in 1616. The industry generally considers Dutchman Adam Wybe to have built the first operational system in 1644. The technology, which was further developed by the people living in the Alpine regions of Europe, progressed rapidly and expanded due to the advent of wire rope and electric drive. World War I motivated extensive use of military tramways for warfare between Italy and Austria. =First chairlifts= The world's first three ski chairlifts were created for the ski resort in Sun Valley, Idaho in 1936 and 1937, then owned by the Union Pacific Railroad.The \\"first known chairlift\\" depends on definition: Miners in Kennecott, Alaska used a mining tram to ski in the 1920s. There were other non-ski \\"chairlifts\\" in British Columbia at the start of the 20th century: Grass Valley (California) in 1896; Aspen (Colorado) in 1890; and British Columbia in 1874. The first chairlift, since removed, was installed on Proctor Mountain, two miles (3 km) east of the more famous Bald Mountain, the primary ski mountain of Sun Valley resort since 1939. One of the chairlifts still remains on Ruud Mountain, named for Thomas Ruud a famous Norwegian ski racer. The chairlift has been preserved with its ski jump and original single chairs as it was during WWII. The chairlift was developed by James Curran of Union Pacific's engineering department in Omaha during the summer of 1936. Prior to working for Union Pacific, Curran worked for Paxton and Vierling Steel, also in Omaha, which engineered banana conveyor systems to load cargo ships in the tropics. (PVS manufactured these chairs in their Omaha, NE facility.) Curran re-engineered the banana hooks with chairs and created a machine with greater capacity than the up-ski toboggan (cable car) and better comfort than the J-bar, the two most common skier transports at the time‚Äîapart from mountain climbing. His basic design is still used for chairlifts today. The patent for the original ski lift was issued to Mr. Curran along with Gordon H. Bannerman and Glen H. Trout (Chief Engineer of the Union Pacific RR) in March 1939. The patent was titled \\"Aerial Ski Tramway,'. W. Averell Harriman, Sun Valley's creator and former governor of New York State, financed the project. Mont Tremblant, Quebec opens in February 1938 with the first Canadian chairlift, built by Joseph Ryan. The ski lift had 4,200 feet of cable and took 250 skiers per hour. The first chairlift in Europe was built in 1940 in Czechoslovakia (present-day Czech Republic), from R√°ztoka, at , to Pustevny, at , in the Moravian-Silesian Beskids mountain range. =Modern chairlifts= New chairlifts built since the 1990s are infrequently fixed-grip. Existing fixed-grip lifts are being replaced with detachable chairlifts at most major ski areas. However the relative simplicity of the fixed-grip design results in lower installation, maintenance and, often, operation costs. For these reasons, they are likely to remain at low volume and community hills, and for short distances, such as beginner terrain.

The term is typically used pejoratively. Although salami slicing is often used to carry out illegal activities, it is only a strategy for gaining an advantage over time by accumulating it in small increments, so it can be used in legal ways as well. An example of salami slicing, also known as penny shaving, is the fraudulent practice of stealing money repeatedly in extremely small quantities, usually by taking advantage of rounding to the nearest cent (or other monetary unit) in financial transactions. It would be done by always rounding down, and putting the fractions of a cent into another account. The idea is to make the change small enough that any single transaction will go undetected. In information security, a salami attack is a series of minor attacks that together results in a larger attack. Computers are ideally suited to automating this type of attack.

Over 13 years, he walked away with 37 tonnes of coins with a face value of nearly CDN$2.4 million, having used a magnet to lift the coins one at a time out of the fare boxes. He was sentenced to 4 years in prison and was eligible for parole after 18 months. In Buffalo, New York, another fare box serviceman stole more than US$200,000 in quarters from the local transit agency over an eight year period (2003 through 2011).

Accenture's current clients include 91 of the Fortune Global 100 and more than three-quarters of the Fortune Global 500. On 11 July 2019, Accenture appointed Julie Sweet as their new chief executive officer. She accepted her office on 1 September 2019. It has been incorporated in Dublin, Ireland since 2009.  History  = Formation and early years = Accenture began as the business and technology consulting division of accounting firm Arthur Andersen in the early 1950s when it conducted a feasibility study for General Electric to install a computer at Appliance Park in Louisville, Kentucky, which led to GE's installation of a UNIVAC I computer and printer, believed to be the first commercial use of a computer in the U.S. Joseph Glickauf, an early pioneer of computer consulting, held a position as head of Arthur Andersen's administrative services division. =Split from Arthur Andersen= In 1989, Arthur Andersen and Andersen Consulting became separate units of Andersen Worldwide Soci√©t√© Coop√©rative (AWSC). Throughout the 1990s, there was increasing tension between Andersen Consulting and Arthur Andersen. Andersen Consulting was paying Arthur Andersen up to 15% of its profits each year (a provision of the 1989 split was that the more profitable unit ‚Äì whether AA or AC ‚Äì pay the other the 15 percent), while at the same time Arthur Andersen was competing with Andersen Consulting through its own newly established business consulting service line called Arthur Andersen Business Consulting (AABC). This dispute came to a head in 1998 when Andersen Consulting put the 15% transfer payment for that year and future years into escrow and issued a claim for breach of contract against AWSC and Arthur Andersen. In August 2000, as a result of the conclusion of arbitration with the International Chamber of Commerce, Andersen Consulting broke all contractual ties with AWSC and Arthur Andersen. As part of the arbitration settlement, Andersen Consulting paid the sum held in escrow (then $1.2 billion) to Arthur Andersen, and was required to change its name, resulting in the entity being renamed Accenture. = Emergence of Accenture = On 1 January 2001, Andersen Consulting adopted its current name, \\"Accenture\\". The word \\"Accenture\\" is derived from \\"Accent on the future\\". The name \\"Accenture\\" was submitted by Kim Petersen, a Danish employee from the company's Oslo, Norway office, as a result of an internal competition. Andersen felt that the name should represent its will to be a global consulting leader and high performer, and also intended that the name should not be offensive in any country in which Accenture operates.Andersen Consulting Changing Name To Accenture ‚Äì 26 Oct. 2000; InformationWeek Accenture's banner hanging on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) building for its initial public offering on 19 July 2001.

Critics, most notably former CNN journalist Lou Dobbs, have reported Accenture's decision to incorporate in Bermuda as a US tax avoidance ploy, because they viewed Accenture as having been a US-based company. The GAO itself did not characterize Accenture as having been a US- based company; it stated that \\"prior to incorporating in Bermuda, Accenture was operating as a series of related partnerships and corporations under the control of its partners through the mechanism of contracts with a Swiss coordinating entity.\\" Accenture engaged in an IT overhaul project for the National Health Service (NHS) in 2003, making headlines when it withdrew from the contract in 2006 over disputes related to delays and cost overruns. The government of the United Kingdom ultimately abandoned the project five years later for the same reasons. Tech Square in Atlanta =2010s: Ireland headquarters and recent history= Accenture announced on 26 May 2009 that its board of directors unanimously approved changing the company's place of incorporation from Bermuda to Ireland and would become Accenture plc. In 2012 it was revealed Accenture was paying only 3.5% in tax in the Republic of Ireland as opposed to the average rate of 24%. Accenture was chosen to replace CGI Group as the lead contractor for HealthCare.gov in January 2014. In December 2014, Accenture won a $563 million contract to provide ongoing maintenance, software development and technology support for HealthCare.gov through 2019. In July 2015, the United States Department of Defense awarded a major Electronic Health Records contract to Cerner, Leidos and Accenture. The contract valued $4.33 billion will serve 55 hospitals and 600 clinics. Accenture Federal Services and Leidos will play the role of configuration specialist, while Cerner is the prime contractor. On 29 August 2017, Apple Inc. announced a partnership with Accenture to create iOS business software. In June 2018, Accenture generated controversy over the amount the firm has been charging to recruit 7,500 Customs and Border Protection officers. Under the $297 million contract, Accenture had been charging the US Government nearly $40,000 per hire, which is more than the annual salary of the average officer. According to a report published by the DHS Office of Inspector General in December 2018, Accenture had been paid $13.6M through the first ten months of the contract. They had hired two agents against a contract goal of 7,500 hires over 5 years. The report was issued as a 'management alert', indicating an issue requiring immediate attention, stating that \\"Accenture has already taken longer to deploy and delivered less capability than promised\\". In January 2019, CEO Pierre Nanterme stepped down from his position, citing health reasons. Twenty days after stepping down, he died in France at the age of 59 after being diagnosed with colon cancer. Chief Financial Officer David Rowland was named as the interim CEO. In July 2019, Julie Sweet, previously CEO of Accenture North America, was named the new chief executive officer of the firm, effective September 2019. She replaced the interim CEO, David Rowland. In February 2019, contractors from Accenture's Austin, Texas location who performed content moderation tasks for Facebook wrote an open letter to Facebook describing poor working conditions and a \\"Big Brother environment\\" that included restricted work breaks and strict non-disclosure agreements. A counselor in the Austin office stated that the content moderators could develop posttraumatic stress disorder as a result of the work, which included evaluating videos and images containing graphic violence, hate speech, animal abuse, and child abuse. On 7 January 2020, news sources reported that Accenture had agreed to acquire Symantec's 300-person cybersecurity services division from Broadcom. The $200 million acquisition was completed in April 2020. In February 2020, Accenture announced that it plans to shut down its media auditing by the end of August. The company also announced the appointment of Jean-Marc Ollagnier as CEO for Europe. In March 2020, Accenture announced that it has agreed to acquire Munich-based ESR Labs, a company that develops embedded software for German car brands and suppliers. In April 2020, Accenture acquired critical infrastructure protection firm Revolutionary Security for an undisclosed amount. In May 2020, Accenture announced that it had acquired Callisto Integration, a Canada-based provider of consulting and technology services and Byte Prophecy, an Ahmedabad-based data analytics company. In June 2020, Accenture finalized its acquisition of Gekko, a France- based Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud services company. The deal improved Accenture's cloud and artificial intelligence leadership position; enhanced its existing alliances with technology suppliers, including industry partners such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft; and complemented the cloud transformation experience and strategic priorities of the Accenture AWS Business Group (AABG) in France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands.

A more complete definition is that current liabilities are obligations that will be settled by current assets or by the creation of new current liabilities. Accounts payable are due within 30 days, and are paid within 30 days, but do often run past 30 days or 60 days in some situations. The laws regarding late payment and claims for unpaid accounts payable is related to the issue of accounts payable. An operating cycle for a firm is the average time that is required to go from cash to cash in producing revenues. For example, accounts payable for goods, services or supplies that were purchased for use in the operation of the business and payable within a normal period would be current liabilities. Amounts listed on a balance sheet as accounts payable represent all bills payable to vendors of a company, whether or not the bills are less than 31 days old or more than 30 days old. Therefore, late payments are not disclosed on the balance sheet for accounts payable. There may be footnotes in audited financial statements regarding age of accounts payable, but this is not common accounting practice. Lawsuits regarding accounts payable are required to be shown on audited financial statements, but this is not necessarily common accounting practice. Bonds, mortgages and loans that are payable over a term exceeding one year would be fixed liabilities or long-term liabilities. However, the payments due on the long-term loans in the current fiscal year could be considered current liabilities if the amounts were material. Amounts due to lenders/ bankers are never shown as accounts payable/ trade accounts payable, but will show up on the balance sheet of a company under the major heading of current liabilities, and often under the sub-heading of other current liabilities, instead of accounts payable, which are due to vendors. Other current liabilities are due for payment according to the terms of the loan agreements, but when lender liabilities are shown as current vs. long term, they are due within the current fiscal year or earlier. Therefore, late payments from a previous fiscal year will carry over into the same position on the balance sheet as current liabilities which are not late in payment. There may be footnotes in audited financial statements regarding past due payments to lenders, but this is not common practice. Lawsuits regarding loans payable are required to be shown on audited financial statements, but this is not necessarily common accounting practice. The proper classification of liabilities provides useful information to investors and other users of the financial statements. It may be regarded as essential for allowing outsiders to consider a true picture of an organization's fiscal health. One application is in the current ratio, defined as the firm's current assets divided by its current liabilities. A ratio higher than one means that current assets, if they can all be converted to cash, are more than sufficient to pay off current obligations. All other things equal, higher values of this ratio imply that a firm is more easily able to meet its obligations in the coming year. The difference between current assets and current liability is referred to as trade working capital. Liability (financial accounting) ","title":"Current liability"},{"id":"299138","text":"Giles of Rome O.S.A. (Latin: Aegidius Romanus; Italian: Egidio Colonna; c. 1243 - 22 December 1316), was a Medieval philosopher and Scholastic theologian and a friar of the Order of St Augustine, who was also appointed to the positions of Prior General of his Order and as Archbishop of Bourges. He is famed as being a logician, producing a commentary on the Organon by Aristotle, and for his authorship of two important works, De Ecclesiastica Potestate, a major text of early 14th century Papalism, and De Regimine Principum, a guide book for Christian temporal leadership. Giles was styled Doctor Fundatissimus (\\"Best-Grounded Teacher\\") by Pope Benedict XIV. Writers in 14th and 15th century England such as John Trevisa and Thomas Hoccleve translated or adapted him into English. Early life Very little is known about his early life, although the Augustinian friar Jordan of Quedlinburg claimed in his Liber Vitasfratrum that Giles belonged to the noble Colonna family of Rome. But Jordan of Saxony was not a contemporary of Giles, and many scholars remain skeptical of his account of Giles' early life. Having entered the Order of the Hermits of St. Augustine in Rome, he was sent by his Order to the University of Paris for his philosophical and theological studies, and there became a disciple of the Dominican Thomas Aquinas, and was later appointed to teach at the university, being the first of his Order to do so. It has been estimated that Giles was taught by Thomas Aquinas between 1269 and 1272, and in the years that followed, he produced many of his commentaries on the works of Aristotle, who had been experiencing an intellectual revival during the thirteenth century, and he also produced his commentary on Peter Lombard's Sentences. Giles remained in Paris studying and teaching theology until Bishop √âtienne Tempier condemned the application of Aristotelianism within the Christian discourse, including those who had produced commentaries on Aristotle's work. Giles, whose work had been condemned, disappeared from the Parisian academic scene. There is no information remaining concerning Giles between the period of 1277 and 1281, when he returned to Italy. However, in 1281, at the Thirty-sixth Council of Paris, in which several differences between the bishops and mendicant orders were dealt with, he sided with the bishops against the mendicants. In reference to this, a contemporary philosopher, Godfrey of Fontaines mentioned Giles as the most renowned theologian of the whole city (qui modo melior de tot√¢ vill√¢ in omnibus reputatur), suggesting that he might have been in Paris during this period before going back to Rome. Philip III of France entrusted to Gile the education of his son and heir, who later, in 1285, ascended the throne as Philip IV. When the new king entered Paris after his consecration at Reims, Giles gave the welcoming address in the name of the university, insisting on justice as the most important virtue for a king to practice. In 1285 Giles' work was again called into question, but by 1287 he was allowed to continue teaching. Eight years later in 1295 Giles was appointed as the Archbishop of Bourges, which he wrote about in his work De renunciatione. Controversy Giles was involved in the condemnation of 1277 promulgated by √âtienne Tempier. Several of his opinions had been found reprehensible by Archbishop Tempier, and in 1285 Pope Honorius IV asked him for a public retraction. This, however, was far from lessening his reputation, for in 1287 a decree of the general chapter of the Augustinians held in Florence, after remarking that Giles's doctrine \\"shines throughout the whole world\\" (venerabilis magistri nostri √Ügidii doctrina mundum universum illustrat), commanded all members of the order to accept and defend all his opinions, written or to be written. After filling several important positions in his order he was elected superior- general/prior-general, in 1292. Three years later Pope Boniface VIII appointed him Archbishop of Bourges, France, although Jean de Savigny had already been designated for this see by Pope Celestine V. The French nobility protested on the ground that Giles was an Italian, but his appointment was maintained and approved by the king. He was present at the Council of Vienne (1311‚Äì1312) in which the Order of Knights Templars was suppressed. He died in Avignon. Works In secundum librum sententiarum quaestiones, 1581 His writings cover the fields of philosophy and theology. There is no complete edition of his works, but several treatises have been published separately. In Holy Scripture and theology he wrote commentaries on the Hexaemeron, the Canticle of Canticles, and the Epistle to the Romans; several Opuscula and Quodlibeta, various treatises, and especially commentaries on Peter the Lombard's Four Books of Sentences. In philosophy, besides commentaries on almost all the works of Aristotle, he wrote several special treatises. But his main work is the treatise De regimine principum, written for, and dedicated to, his pupil, Philip IV. It passed through many editions (the first, Augsburg, 1473) and was translated into several languages. The Roman edition of 1607 contains a life of Egidio. The work is divided into three books: the first treats of the individual conduct of the king, the nature of his true happiness, the choice and acquisition of virtues, and the ruling of passions; the second deals with family life and the relations with wife, children, and servants; the third considers the State, its origin, and the proper mode of governing in times of peace and war. His pedagogical writings have been published in German by Kaufmann (Freiburg, 1904). His attitude in the difficulties between Pope Boniface VIII and King Philip IV was long believed to have been favourable to the king. But it has been proved that he is the author of the treatise De potestate ecclesiastic√¢, in which the rights of the pope are vindicated. The similarity between this treatise and the bull Unam Sanctam seems to support the view taken by some writers that he was the author of the bull. He had already taken an active part in ending the discussions and controversies concerning the validity of Boniface's election to the papacy. In his treatise De renunciatione Pap√¶ sive Apologia pro Bonifacio VIII he shows the legitimacy of Celestine's resignation and consequently of Boniface's election. In philosophy and theology he generally follows the opinions of his master, St. Thomas, whose works he quotes as scripta communia. The Defensorium seu Correctorium corruptorii librorum Sancti Thom√¶ Acquinatis against the Franciscan William de la Mare of Oxford is by some attributed to him; but this remains uncertain. Nevertheless, on many points he holds independent views and abandons the Thomistic doctrine to follow the opinions of St. Augustine and of the Franciscan School. He even errs in asserting that, before the Fall, grace had not been given to Adam, an opinion which he wrongly attributes to St. Augustine. Giles wrote a commentary on Guido Cavalcanti's philosophical love canzone \\"Donna me prega\\" (see Enrico Fenzi, La canzone d'amore di Guido Cavalcanti e i suoi antichi commenti, Melangolo, 1999). The Aegidian school After the decree of the general chapter of 1287, mentioned above, his opinions were generally accepted in the Augustinian Order. He thus became the founder of the √Ügidian School. Among the most prominent representatives of this school must be mentioned Giacomo Capoccio of Viterbo (d. 1307) and Augustinus Triumphus (d. 1328), both of them his contemporaries, and also students and professors in the University of Paris: Prosper of Reggio, Albert of Padua, Gerard of Siena, Henry of Frimar, Thomas of Strasburg -- all in the first half of the fourteenth century. For some time after this other opinions prevailed in the Augustinian Order. But as late as the seventeenth century should be mentioned Raffaello Bonherba (d. 1681) who wrote Disputationes totius philosophi√¶ ‚Ä¶ in quibus omnes philosophic√¶ inter D. Thomam et Scotum controversi√¶ principaliter cum doctrin√¢ nostri √Ügidii Column√¶ illustrantur (Palermo, 1645, 1671); and Augustino Arpe (d. 1704) who wrote Summa totius theologi√¶ √Ügidii Column√¶ (Bologna, 1701, and Genoa, 1704). Federico Nicol√≤ Gavardi (d. 1715), the most important interpreter of Colonna, composed Theologia exantiquata iuxta orthodoxam S. P. Augustini doctrinam ab √Ügidio Column√¢ doctor√¶ fundatissimo expositam ‚Ä¶ (6 vols. fol., Naples and Rome, 1683‚Äì1696); this work was abridged by Anselm H√∂rmannseder in his Hecatombe theologica (Presburg, 1737). Benignus Sichrowsky (d. 1737) wrote also Philosophia vindicata ad erroribus philosophorum gentilium iuxta doctrinam S. Augustini et B. √Ügidii Column√¶ (Nuremberg, 1701).

A prominent figure in the New Age movement, his books and videos have made him one of the best-known and wealthiest figures in alternative medicine. Chopra studied medicine in India before emigrating in 1970 to the United States, where he completed a residency in internal medicine and a fellowship in endocrinology. As a licensed physician, in 1980 he became chief of staff at the New England Memorial Hospital (NEMH). In 1985, he met Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and became involved in the Transcendental Meditation (TM) movement. Shortly thereafter he resigned his position at NEMH to establish the Maharishi Ayurveda Health Center. In 1993, Chopra gained a following after he was interviewed about his books on The Oprah Winfrey Show. He then left the TM movement to become the executive director of Sharp HealthCare's Center for Mind-Body Medicine. In 1996, he co-founded the Chopra Center for Wellbeing. Chopra believes that a person may attain \\"perfect health\\", a condition \\"that is free from disease, that never feels pain\\", and \\"that cannot age or die\\". Seeing the human body as undergirded by a \\"quantum mechanical body\\" composed not of matter but of energy and information, he believes that \\"human aging is fluid and changeable; it can speed up, slow down, stop for a time, and even reverse itself,\\" as determined by one's state of mind. He claims that his practices can also treat chronic disease. The ideas Chopra promotes have regularly been criticized by medical and scientific professionals as pseudoscience. The criticism has been described as ranging \\"from the dismissive to... the damning\\". Philosopher Robert Carroll writes that Chopra, to justify his teachings, attempts to integrate Ayurveda with quantum mechanics. Chopra says that what he calls \\"quantum healing\\" cures any manner of ailments, including cancer, through effects that he claims are literally based on the same principles as quantum mechanics. This has led physicists to object to his use of the term \\"quantum\\" in reference to medical conditions and the human body. Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins has said that Chopra uses \\"quantum jargon as plausible-sounding hocus pocus\\". Chopra's treatments generally elicit nothing but a placebo response and have drawn criticism that the unwarranted claims made for them may raise \\"false hope\\" and lure sick people away from legitimate medical treatments. Biography = Early life and education = Chopra was born in New Delhi, British India to Krishan Lal Chopra (1919‚Äì2001) and Pushpa Chopra.Chopra and Chopra 2013, pp. 5, 161. His paternal grandfather was a sergeant in the British Indian Army. His father was a prominent cardiologist, head of the department of medicine and cardiology at New Delhi's Moolchand Khairati Ram Hospital for over 25 years, and was also a lieutenant in the British army, serving as an army doctor at the front at Burma and acting as a medical adviser to Lord Mountbatten, viceroy of India.Chopra 2013, pp. 5‚Äì6, 11‚Äì13; , Chopra's younger brother, Sanjiv Chopra, is a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and on staff at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.\\"Chopra, Sanjiv, MD\\" , Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.

He spent his first months as a doctor working in rural India, including, he writes, six months in a village where the lights went out whenever it rained.Deepak Chopra, Return of the Rishi, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 1991, p. 1. It was during his early career that he was drawn to study endocrinology, particularly neuroendocrinology, to find a biological basis for the influence of thoughts and emotions. He married in India in 1970 before emigrating, with his wife, to the United States that same year. The Indian government had banned its doctors from sitting for the exam needed to practice in the US, consequently Chopra had to travel to Sri Lanka to take it. After passing he arrived in the United States to take up a clinical internship at Muhlenberg Hospital in Plainfield, New Jersey, where doctors from overseas were being recruited to replace those serving in Vietnam.Chopra 1991, p. 57; Deepak Chopra, \\"Special Keynote with Dr. Deepak Chopra\\", November 2013, from 2:50 mins; Richard Knox, \\"Foreign doctors: a US dilemma\\", Boston Globe, June 30, 1974.

Maharishi Mahesh Yogi was an influence on Chopra in the 1980s. While visiting New Delhi in 1981, he met the Ayurvedic physician Brihaspati Dev Triguna, head of the Indian Council for Ayurvedic Medicine, whose advice prompted him to begin investigating Ayurvedic practices.Chopra 1991, p. 105ff. Chopra was \\"drinking black coffee by the hour and smoking at least a pack of cigarettes a day.\\"Chopra 1991, p. 125. He took up Transcendental Meditation to help him stop, and , he continued to meditate for two hours every morning and half an hour in the evening. Chopra's involvement with TM led to a meeting in 1985 with the leader of the TM movement, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, who asked him to establish an Ayurvedic health center.Baer 2003, p. 237.Chopra 1991, p. 139ff He left his position at the NEMH. Chopra said that one of the reasons he left was his disenchantment at having to prescribe too many drugs: \\"[W]hen all you do is prescribe medication, you start to feel like a legalized drug pusher. That doesn't mean that all prescriptions are useless, but it is true that 80 percent of all drugs prescribed today are of optional or marginal benefit.\\"Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed, \\"The Crisis of Perception\\", Media Monitors Network, February 29, 2008. He became the founding president of the American Association of Ayurvedic Medicine, one of the founders of Maharishi Ayur-Veda Products International, and medical director of the Maharishi Ayur-Veda Health Center in Lancaster, Massachusetts. The center charged between $2,850 and $3,950 per week for Ayurvedic cleansing rituals such as massages, enemas and oil baths, and TM lessons cost an additional $1,000. Celebrity patients included Elizabeth Taylor.Elise Pettus, \\"The Mind‚ÄìBody Problems,\\" New York, August 14, 1995, (pp. 28‚Äì31, 95), p. 30. Also see Deepak Chopra, \\"Letters: Deepak responds,\\" New York Magazine, September 25, 1995, p. 16. Chopra also became one of the TM movement's spokespeople. In 1989, the Maharishi awarded him the title \\"Dhanvantari of Heaven and Earth\\" (Dhanvantari was the Hindu physician to the gods).Cynthia Ann Humes, \\"Schisms within Hindu guru groups: the Transcendental Meditation movement in North America,\\" in James R. Lewis, Sarah M. Lewis (eds.), Sacred Schisms: How Religions Divide, Cambridge University Press, 2009, p. 297.

Forsthoefel, Cynthia Ann Humes (eds.), Gurus in America, State University of New York Press, 2005, pp. 68‚Äì69. That year Chopra's Quantum Healing: Exploring the Frontiers of Mind/Body Medicine was published, followed by Perfect Health: The Complete Mind/Body Guide (1990). = West Coast years = In June 1993, he moved to California as executive director of Sharp HealthCare's Institute for Human Potential and Mind/Body Medicine, and head of their Center for Mind/Body Medicine, a clinic in an exclusive resort in Del Mar, California that charged $4,000 per week and included Michael Jackson's family among its clients.Pettus (New York Magazine) 1995, p. 31. Chopra and Jackson first met in 1988 and remained friends for 20 years. When Jackson died in 2009 after being administered prescription drugs, Chopra said he hoped it would be a call to action against the \\"cult of drug- pushing doctors, with their co-dependent relationships with addicted celebrities\\".Deepak Chopra, \\"A Tribute to My Friend, Michael Jackson\\".The Huffington Post, June 26, 2009; Gerald Posner, \\"Deepak Chopra: How Michael Jackson Could Have Been Saved\\", The Daily Beast, July 2, 2009, p. 4. Chopra left the Transcendental Meditation movement around the time he moved to California in January 1993.Pettus (New York Magazine) 1995, p. 31; Baer 2004, p. 129. Mahesh Yogi claimed that Chopra had competed for the Maharishi's position as guru,Deepak Chopra, \\"The Maharishi Years ‚Äì The Untold Story: Recollections of a Former Disciple\\", The Huffington Post, February 13, 2008. although Chopra rejected this. According to Robert Todd Carroll, Chopra left the TM organization when it \\"became too stressful\\" and was a \\"hindrance to his success\\". Cynthia Ann Humes writes that the Maharishi was concerned, and not only with regard to Chopra, that rival systems were being taught at lower prices.Humes 2005, p. 69; Humes 2009, pp. 299, 302. Chopra, for his part, was worried that his close association with the TM movement might prevent Ayurvedic medicine from being accepted as legitimate, particularly after the problems with the JAMA article.Cynthia Ann Humes, \\"Maharishi Ayur-Veda: Perfect Health through Enlightened Marketing in America,\\" in Frederick M. Smith, Dagmar Wujastyk (eds.), Modern and Global Ayurveda: Pluralism and Paradigms, State University of New York Press, 2008, p. 324. He also stated that he had become uncomfortable with what seemed like a \\"cultish atmosphere around Maharishi\\". In 1995, Chopra was not licensed to practice medicine in California where he had a clinic. However, he did not see patients at this clinic \\"as a doctor\\" during this time. In 2004, he received his California medical license, and is affiliated with Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, California.\\"Chopra, Deepak\\", California Department of Consumer Affairs.

The book and his friendship with Michael Jackson gained him an interview on July 12 that year on Oprah. Paul Offit writes that within 24 hours Chopra had sold 137,000 copies of his book and 400,000 by the end of the week.Paul A. Offit, Do You Believe in Magic? The Sense and Nonsense of Alternative Medicine, HarperCollins, 2013, p. 39; \\"Full Transcript: Your Call with Dr Deepak Chopra\\", NDTV, January 23, 2012; also see Craig Bromberg, \\"Doc of Ages,\\" People, November 15, 1993. Four days after the interview, the Maharishi National Council of the Age of Enlightenment wrote to TM centers in the United States, instructing them not to promote Chopra, and his name and books were removed from the movement's literature and health centers.For the National Council's letter, Humes 2005, p. 68; Humes 2009, p. 297; for the rest, Pettus (New York Magazine) 1995, p. 31. Neuroscientist Tony Nader became the movement's new \\"Dhanvantari of Heaven and Earth\\".Humes 2008, p. 326. Sharp HealthCare changed ownership in 1996 and Chopra left to set up the Chopra Center for Wellbeing with neurologist David Simon, now located at the Omni La Costa Resort and Spa in Carlsbad, California. In his 2013 book, Do You Believe in Magic?, Paul Offit writes that Chopra's business grosses approximately $20 million annually, and is built on the sale of various alternative medicine products such as herbal supplements, massage oils, books, videos and courses. A year's worth of products for \\"anti-ageing\\" can cost up to $10,000, Offit wrote. Chopra himself is estimated to be worth over $80 million .Rowe 2014, Truly, madly, deeply Deepak Chopra. , according to Srinivas Aravamudan, he was able to charge $25,000 to $30,000 per lecture five or six times a month.Srinivas Aravamudan, Guru English: South Asian Religion in a Cosmopolitan Language, Princeton University Press, 2005, p. 257. Medical anthropologist Hans Baer said Chopra was an example of a successful entrepreneur, but that he focused too much on serving the upper-class through an alternative to medical hegemony, rather than a truly holistic approach to health. = Teaching and other roles = Chopra serves as an adjunct professor in the marketing division at Columbia Business School. He serves as adjunct professor of executive programs at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. He participates annually as a lecturer at the Update in Internal Medicine event sponsored by Harvard Medical School and the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Robert Carroll writes of Chopra charging $25,000 per lecture, \\"giving spiritual advice while warning against the ill effects of materialism\\". In 2015, Chopra partnered with businessman Paul Tudor Jones II to found JUST Capital, a non-profit firm which ranks companies in terms of just business practices in an effort to promote economic justice. In 2014, Chopra founded ISHAR (Integrative Studies Historical Archive and Repository). In 2012, Chopra joined the board of advisors for tech startup State.com, creating a browsable network of structured opinions. In 2009, Chopra founded the , a tax-exempt 501(c) organization that raises funds to promote and research alternative health. The Foundation sponsors annual Sages and Scientists conferences. He sits on the board of advisors of the National Ayurvedic Medical Association, an organization based in the United States.\\"NAMA's Board of Advisors\\". Chopra founded the American Association for Ayurvedic Medicine (AAAM) and Maharishi AyurVeda Products International, though he later distanced himself from these organizations. In 2005, Chopra was appointed as a senior scientist at The Gallup Organization. Since 2004, he has been a board member of Men's Wearhouse, a men's clothing distributor. In 2006, he launched Virgin Comics with his son Gotham Chopra and entrepreneur Richard Branson.David Segal, \\"Deepak Chopra And a New Age Of Comic Books\\", The Washington Post, March 3, 2007. In 2016, Chopra was promoted from voluntary assistant clinical professor to voluntary full clinical professor at the University of California, San Diego in their Department of Family Medicine and Public Health. =Personal life= Chopra and his wife have, , two adult children and three grandchildren.Chopra 1991, pp. 54‚Äì57; Joanne Kaufman, \\"Deepak Chopra ‚Äì An 'Inner Stillness,' Even on the Subway,\\" The New York Times, October 17, 2013. , Deepak Chopra lived in a \\"health-centric\\" condominium in Manhattan.  Ideas and reception  Chopra believes that a person may attain \\"perfect health\\", a condition \\"that is free from disease, that never feels pain\\", and \\"that cannot age or die\\". Seeing the human body as being undergirded by a \\"quantum mechanical body\\" comprised not of matter but of energy and information, he believes that \\"human aging is fluid and changeable; it can speed up, slow down, stop for a time, and even reverse itself,\\" as determined by one's state of mind. He claims that his practices can also treat chronic disease. = Consciousness = Chopra speaks and writes regularly about metaphysics, including the study of consciousness and Vedanta philosophy. He is a philosophical idealist, arguing for the primacy of consciousness over matter and for teleology and intelligence in nature that mind, or \\"dynamically active consciousness\\", is a fundamental feature of the universe.Deepak Chopra, \\"What Is Consciousness & Where Is It?\\", discussion with Rudolph Tanzi, Menas Kafatos and Lothar Sch√§fer, Science and Nonduality Conference, 2013, 08:12 mins. * Attila Grandpierre, Deepak Chopra, P. Murali Doraiswamy, Rudolph Tanzi, Menas C. Kafatos, \\"A Multidisciplinary Approach to Mind and Consciousness\\", NeuroQuantology, 11(4), December 2013 (pp. 607‚Äì617), p. 609. In this view, consciousness is both subject and object.Deepak Chopra, Stuart Hameroff, \\"The 'Quantum Soul': A Scientific Hypothesis,\\" in Alexander Moreira-Almeida, Franklin Santana Santos (eds.), Exploring Frontiers of the Mind-Brain Relationship, Springer, 2011 (pp. 79‚Äì93), p. 85. It is consciousness, he writes, that creates reality; we are not \\"physical machines that have somehow learned to think...[but] thoughts that have learned to create a physical machine\\". He argues that the evolution of species is the evolution of consciousness seeking to express itself as multiple observers; the universe experiences itself through our brains: \\"We are the eyes of the universe looking at itself\\".Deepak Chopra, \\"Dangerous Ideas: Deepak Chopra & Richard Dawkins\\", University of Puebla, November 9, 2013, 26:23 mins. * Also see Deepak Chopra, Menas Kafatos, Rudolph E. Tanzi, \\"From Quanta to Qualia: The Mystery of Reality (Part 1)\\", \\"(Part 2)\\", \\"(Part 3)\\", \\"(Part 4)\\", The Huffington Post, October 8, 15, 29 and November 12, 2012. He has been quoted as saying \\"Charles Darwin was wrong. Consciousness is key to evolution and we will soon prove that.\\" As quoted by As quoted by He opposes reductionist thinking in science and medicine, arguing that we can trace the physical structure of the body down to the molecular level and still have no explanation for beliefs, desires, memory and creativity.Deepak Chopra and Leonard Mlodinow, War of the Worldviews, Random House, 2011, p. 123. In his book Quantum Healing, Chopra stated the conclusion that quantum entanglement links everything in the universe, and therefore it must create consciousness. = Approach to health care = Deepak Chopra at a book signing in 2006 Chopra argues that everything that happens in the mind and brain is physically represented elsewhere in the body, with mental states (thoughts, feelings, perceptions, and memories) directly influencing physiology by means of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, oxytocin, and serotonin. He has stated, \\"Your mind, your body and your consciousness which is your spirit and your social interactions, your personal relationships, your environment, how you deal with the environment, and your biology are all inextricably woven into a single process ‚Ä¶ By influencing one, you influence everything.\\"Deepak Chopra, \\"Deepak Chopra Meditation\\", courtesy of YouTube, December 10, 2012. Chopra and physicians at the Chopra Center practise integrative medicine, combining the medical model of conventional Western medicine with alternative therapies such as yoga, mindfulness meditation, and Ayurveda. According to Ayurveda, illness is caused by an imbalance in the patient's doshas or humors, and is treated with diet, exercise and meditative practicesFor imbalance, see Baer 2004, p. 128; for the rest, Chopra 2009 [1989], pp. 222‚Äì224, 234ff. based on the medical evidence there is, however, nothing in Ayurvedic medicine that is known to be effective at treating disease, and some preparations may be actively harmful, although meditation may be useful in promoting general wellbeing. In discussing health care, Chopra has used the term \\"quantum healing\\", which he defined in Quantum Healing (1989) as the \\"ability of one mode of consciousness (the mind) to spontaneously correct the mistakes in another mode of consciousness (the body)\\".Chopra 2009 [1989], pp. 15, 241; Deepak Chopra, \\"Healing wisdom\\" , The Chopra Center, June 12, 2013. * That he uses the term \\"quantum healing\\" as a metaphor, see Richard Dawkins, \\"Interview with Chopra\\", The Enemies of Reason, Channel 4 (UK), 2007, 01:16 mins. This attempted to wed the Maharishi's version of Ayurvedic medicine with concepts from physics, an example of what cultural historian Kenneth Zysk called \\"New Age Ayurveda\\".Suzanne Newcombe, \\"Ayurvedic Medicine in Britain and the Epistemology of Practicing Medicine in Good Faith,\\" in Smith and Wujastyk 2008, pp. 263‚Äì264; Kenneth Zysk, \\"New Age Ayurveda or what happens to Indian medicine when it comes to America,\\" Traditional South Asian Medicine, 6, 2001, pp. 10‚Äì26. Also see Francoise Jeannotat, \\"Maharishi Ayur-veda,\\" in Smith and Wujastyk 2008, p. 285ff. The book introduced Chopra's view that a person's thoughts and feelings give rise to all cellular processes. Chopra coined the term quantum healing to invoke the idea of a process whereby a person's health \\"imbalance\\" is corrected by quantum mechanical means. Chopra said that quantum phenomena are responsible for health and wellbeing. He has attempted to integrate Ayurveda, a traditional Indian system of medicine, with quantum mechanics, in order to justify his teachings. According to Robert Carroll, he \\"charges $25,000 per lecture performance, where he spouts a few platitudes and gives spiritual advice while warning against the ill effects of materialism\\". Chopra has equated spontaneous remission in cancer to a change in quantum state, corresponding to a jump to \\"a new level of consciousness that prohibits the existence of cancer\\". Physics professor Robert L. Park has written that physicists \\"wince\\" at the \\"New Age quackery\\" in Chopra's cancer theories, and characterizes them as a cruel fiction, since adopting them in place of effective treatment risks compounding the ill effects of the disease with guilt, and might rule out the prospect of getting a genuine cure. Chopra's claims of quantum healing have attracted controversy due to what has been described as a \\"systematic misinterpretation\\" of modern physics. Chopra's connections between quantum mechanics and alternative medicine are widely regarded in the scientific community as being invalid. The main criticism revolves around the fact that macroscopic objects are too large to exhibit inherently quantum properties like interference and wave function collapse. Most literature on quantum healing is almost entirely theosophical, omitting the rigorous mathematics that makes quantum electrodynamics possible. Physicists have objected to Chopra's use of terms from quantum physics, although he was awarded the satirical Ig Nobel Prize in physics in 1998 for \\"his unique interpretation of quantum physics as it applies to life, liberty, and the pursuit of economic happiness\\".Park 2000, p. 137; ; * Brian Cox says that \\"for some scientists, the unfortunate distortion and misappropriation of scientific ideas that often accompanies their integration into popular culture is an unacceptable price to pay.\\" See * The main criticism revolves around the fact that macroscopic objects are too large to exhibit inherently quantum properties like interference and wave function collapse. Most literature on quantum healing is almost entirely theosophical, omitting the rigorous mathematics that makes quantum electrodynamics possible. See When Chopra and Jean Houston debated Sam Harris and Michael Shermer in 2010 on the question \\"Does God Have a Future?\\", Harris argued that Chopra's use of \\"spooky physics\\" merged two language games in a \\"completely unprincipled way\\". Interviewed in 2007 by Richard Dawkins, Chopra said that he used the term quantum as a metaphor when discussing healing and that it had little to do with quantum theory in physics.Richard Dawkins, \\"Interview with Chopra\\", The Enemies of Reason, Channel 4 (UK), 2007; Deepak Chopra, \\"Richard Dawkins Plays God: The Video (Updated)\\", The Huffington Post, June 19, 2013. Chopra wrote in 2000 that his AIDS patients were combining mainstream medicine with activities based on Ayurveda, including taking herbs, meditation and yoga.Dann Dulin, \\"The Medicine Man\\", interview with Deepak Chopra, A&U; magazine, 2000. He acknowledges that AIDS is caused by the HIV virus, but says that, \\"'[h]earing' the virus in its vicinity, the DNA mistakes it for a friendly or compatible sound\\". Ayurveda uses vibrations which are said to correct this supposed sound distortion.Chopra 2009 [1989], pp. 37, 237, 239‚Äì241. Medical professor Lawrence Schneiderman writes that Chopra's treatment has \\"to put it mildly...no supporting empirical data\\". In 2001, ABC News aired a show segment on the topic of distance healing and prayer. In it Chopra said that \\"there is a realm of reality that goes beyond the physical where in fact we can influence each other from a distance\\". Chopra was shown using his claimed mental powers in an attempt to relax a person in another room, whose vital signs were recorded in charts which were said to show a correspondence between Chopra's periods of concentration and the subject's periods of relaxation. After the show, a poll of its viewers found that 90% of them believed in distance healing. Health and science journalist Christopher Wanjek has criticized the experiment, saying that any correspondence evident from the charts would prove nothing, but that even so freezing the frame of the video showed the correspondences were not so close as claimed. Wanjek characterized the broadcast as \\"an instructive example of how bad medicine is presented as exciting news\\" which had \\"a dependence on unusual or sensational science results that others in the scientific community renounce as unsound\\". = Alternative medicine = Chopra has been described as \\"America's most prominent spokesman for Ayurveda\\". His treatments benefit from the placebo response. Chopra states \\"The placebo effect is real medicine, because it triggers the body's healing system.\\" Physician and former U.S. Air Force flight surgeon Harriet Hall has criticized Chopra for his promotion of Ayurveda, stating that \\"it can be dangerous\\", referring to studies showing that 64% of Ayurvedic remedies sold in India are contaminated with significant amounts of heavy metals like mercury, arsenic, and cadmium and a 2015 study of users in the United States who found elevated blood lead levels in 40% of those tested.\\" Chopra has metaphorically described the AIDS virus as emitting \\"a sound that lures the DNA to its destruction\\". The condition can be treated, according to Chopra, with \\"Ayurveda's primordial sound\\". Taking issue with this view, medical professor Lawrence Schneiderman has said that ethical issues are raised when alternative medicine is not based on empirical evidence and that, \\"to put it mildly, Dr. Chopra proposes a treatment and prevention program for AIDS that has no supporting empirical data\\". He is placed by David Gorski among the \\"quacks\\", \\"cranks\\" and \\"purveyors of woo\\", and described as \\"arrogantly obstinate\\". The New York Times in 2013 stated that Deepak Chopra is \\"the controversial New Age guru and booster of alternative medicine\\". Time magazine stated that he is \\"the poet-prophet of alternative medicine.\\" He has become one of the best-known and wealthiest figures in the holistic-health movement. The New York Times argued that his publishers have used his medical degree on the covers of his books as a way to promote the books and buttress their claims. In 1999, Time magazine included Chopra in its list of the 20th century's heroes and icons.For Time, Peter Rowe, \\"Truly, madly, deeply Deepak Chopra,\\" U-T San Diego, May 3, 2014, p. 1 ; for Clinton, Public Papers of the presidents of the United States: William J. Clinton, 2000‚Äì2001, January 1 to June 26, 2000, Government Printing Office, 2001, p. 508. Cosmo Landesman wrote in 2005 that Chopra was \\"hardly a man now, more a lucrative new age brand the David Beckham of personal/spiritual growth\\". For Timothy Caulfield, Chopra is an example of someone using scientific language to promote treatments that are not grounded in science: \\"[Chopra] legitimizes these ideas that have no scientific basis at all, and makes them sound scientific. He really is a fountain of meaningless jargon.\\" A 2008 Time magazine article by Ptolemy Tompkins commented that for most of his career Chopra had been a \\"magnet for criticism\\", and most of it was from the medical and scientific professionals. Opinions ranged from the \\"dismissive\\" to the \\"outright damning\\". Chopra's claims for the effectiveness of alternative medicine can, some have argued, lure sick people away from medical treatment. Tompkins however considered Chopra a \\"beloved\\" individual whose basic messages centered on \\"love, health and happiness\\" had made him rich because of their popular appeal. English professor George O'Har argues that Chopra exemplifies the need of human beings for meaning and spirit in their lives, and places what he calls Chopra's \\"sophistries\\" alongside the emotivism of Oprah Winfrey. Paul Kurtz writes that Chopra's \\"regnant spirituality\\" is reinforced by postmodern criticism of the notion of objectivity in science, while Wendy Kaminer equates Chopra's views with irrational belief systems such as New Thought, Christian Science, and Scientology.Paul Kurtz, Skepticism and Humanism: The New Paradigm, Transaction Publishers, 2001, p. 110; = Aging = Chopra believes that \\"ageing is simply learned behaviour\\" that can be slowed or prevented. Chopra has said that he expects \\"to live way beyond 100\\". He states that \\"by consciously using our awareness, we can influence the way we age biologically...You can tell your body not to age.\\"Schwarcz, Joe (2009) Science, Sense & Nonsense, Doubleday Canada. . p153. Conversely, Chopra also says that aging can be accelerated, for example by a person engaging in \\"cynical mistrust\\". Robert Todd Carroll has characterized Chopra's promotion of lengthened life as a selling of \\"hope\\" that seems to be \\"a false hope based on an unscientific imagination steeped in mysticism and cheerily dispensed gibberish\\". = Spirituality and religion = Chopra has likened the universe to a \\"reality sandwich\\" which has three layers: the \\"material\\" world, a \\"quantum\\" zone of matter and energy, and a \\"virtual\\" zone outside of time and space, which is the domain of God, and from which God can direct the other layers. Chopra has written that human beings' brains are \\"hardwired to know God\\" and that the functions of the human nervous system mirror divine experience. commenting on Chopra has written that his thinking has been inspired by Jiddu Krishnamurti, a 20th-century speaker and writer on philosophical and spiritual subjects. In 2012, reviewing War of the Worldviewsa book co-authored by Chopra and Leonard Mlodinow ‚Äì physics professor Mark Alford says that the work is set out as a debate between the two authors, \\"[covering] all the big questions: cosmology, life and evolution, the mind and brain, and God\\". Alford considers the two sides of the debate a false opposition, and says that \\"the counterpoint to Chopra's speculations is not science, with its complicated structure of facts, theories, and hypotheses,\\" but rather Occam's razor. In August 2005, Chopra wrote a series of articles on the creation‚Äìevolution controversy and Intelligent design, which were criticized by science writer Michael Shermer, founder of The Skeptics Society. In 2010, Shermer said that Chopra is \\"the very definition of what we mean by pseudoscience\\". = Position on skepticism = Paul Kurtz, an American skeptic and secular humanist, has written that the popularity of Chopra's views is associated with increasing anti-scientific attitudes in society, and such popularity represents an assault on the objectivity of science itself by seeking new, alternative forms of validation for ideas. Kurtz says that medical claims must always be submitted to open- minded but proper scrutiny, and that skepticism \\"has its work cut out for it\\". In 2013, Chopra published an article on what he saw as \\"skepticism\\" at work in Wikipedia, arguing that a \\"stubborn band of militant skeptics\\" were editing articles to prevent what he believes would be a fair representation of the views of such figures as Rupert Sheldrake, an author, lecturer, and researcher in parapsychology. The result, Chopra argued, was that the encyclopedia's readers were denied the opportunity to read of attempts to \\"expand science beyond its conventional boundaries\\". The biologist Jerry Coyne responded, saying that it was instead Chopra who was losing out as his views were being \\"exposed as a lot of scientifically-sounding psychobabble\\". More broadly, Chopra has attacked skepticism as a whole, writing in The Huffington Post that \\"No skeptic, to my knowledge, ever made a major scientific discovery or advanced the welfare of others.\\" Astronomer Phil Plait said this statement trembled \\"on the very edge of being a blatant and gross lie\\", listing Carl Sagan, Richard Feynman, Stephen Jay Gould, and Edward Jenner among the \\"thousands of scientists [who] are skeptics\\", who he said were counterexamples to Chopra's statement. = Misuse of scientific terminology = Reviewing Susan Jacoby's book, The Age of American Unreason, Wendy Kaminer sees Chopra's popular reception in the US as being symptomatic of many Americans' historical inability (as Jacoby puts it) \\"to distinguish between real scientists and those who peddled theories in the guise of science\\". Chopra's \\"nonsensical references to quantum physics\\" are placed in a lineage of American religious pseudoscience, extending back through Scientology to Christian Science. Physics professor Chad Orzel has written that \\"to a physicist, Chopra's babble about 'energy fields' and 'congealing quantum soup' presents as utter gibberish\\", but that Chopra makes enough references to technical terminology to convince non-scientists that he understands physics. English professor George O'Har writes that Chopra is as an exemplification of the fact that human beings need \\"magic\\" in their lives, and places \\"the sophistries of Chopra\\" alongside the emotivism of Oprah Winfrey, the special effects and logic of Star Trek, and the magic of Harry Potter. Chopra has been criticized for his frequent references to the relationship of quantum mechanics to healing processes, a connection that has drawn skepticism from physicists who say it can be considered as contributing to the general confusion in the popular press regarding quantum measurement, decoherence and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. In 1998, Chopra was awarded the satirical Ig Nobel Prize in physics for \\"his unique interpretation of quantum physics as it applies to life, liberty, and the pursuit of economic happiness\\". When interviewed by ethologist and evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in the Channel 4 (UK) documentary The Enemies of Reason, Chopra said that he used the term \\"quantum physics\\" as \\"a metaphor\\" and that it had little to do with quantum theory in physics. In March 2010, Chopra and Jean Houston debated Sam Harris and Michael Shermer at the California Institute of Technology on the question \\"Does God Have a Future?\\" Shermer and Harris criticized Chopra's use of scientific terminology to expound unrelated spiritual concepts. A 2015 paper examining \\"the reception and detection of pseudo-profound bullshit\\" used Chopra's Twitter feed as the canonical example, and compared this with fake Chopra quotes generated by a spoof website. = Yoga = In April 2010, Aseem Shukla, co-founder of the Hindu American Foundation, criticized Chopra for suggesting that yoga did not have its origins in Hinduism but in an older Indian spiritual tradition. Chopra later said that yoga was rooted in \\"consciousness alone\\" expounded by Vedic rishis long before historic Hinduism ever arose. He said that Shukla had a \\"fundamentalist agenda\\". Shukla responded by saying Chopra was an exponent of the art of \\"How to Deconstruct, Repackage and Sell Hindu Philosophy Without Calling it Hindu!\\", and he said Chopra's mentioning of fundamentalism was an attempt to divert the debate.  Legal actions  In May 1991, the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) published an article by Chopra and two others on Ayurvedic medicine and TM. JAMA subsequently published an erratum stating that the lead author, Hari M. Sharma, had undisclosed financial interests, followed by an article by JAMA associate editor Andrew A. Skolnick which was highly critical of Chopra and the other authors for failing to disclose their financial connections to the article subject.; . * Also see Several experts on meditation and traditional Indian medicine criticized JAMA for accepting the \\"shoddy science\\" of the original article. Chopra and two TM groups sued Skolnick and JAMA for defamation, asking for $194 million in damages, but the case was dismissed in March 1993.Pettus (New York Magazine) 1995, p. 31; After Chopra published his book, Ageless Body, Timeless Mind (1993), he was sued for copyright infringement by Robert Sapolsky for having used, without proper attribution, a chart displaying information on the endocrinology of stress.

An intangible asset is usually very hard to evaluate. Examples are patents, copyright, franchises, goodwill, trademarks, and trade names. The general interpretation also includes software and other intangible computer based assets; these are all examples of intangible assets. Intangible assets generally‚Äîthough not necessarily‚Äîsuffer from typical market failures of non-rivalry and non-excludability.Webster, Elisabeth; Jensen, Paul H. (2006). Investment in Intangible Capital: An Enterprise Perspective. The Economic Record, Vol. 82, No. 256, March, 82-96. Definition Intangible assets may be one possible contributor to the disparity between \\"company value as per their accounting records\\", as well as \\"company value as per their market capitalization\\". Considering this argument, it is important to understand what an intangible asset truly is in the eyes of an accountant. A number of attempts have been made to define intangible assets: * Prior to 2005 the Australian Accounting Standards Board issued the Statement of Accounting Concepts number 4 (SAC 4). This statement did not provide a formal definition of an intangible asset but did provide that tangibility was not an essential characteristic of asset. * International Accounting Standards Board standard 38 (IAS 38) defines an intangible asset as: \\"an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance.\\" This definition is in addition to the standard definition of an asset which requires a past event that has given rise to a resource that the entity controls and from which future economic benefits are expected to flow. Thus, the extra requirement for an intangible asset under IAS 38 is identifiability. This criterion requires that an intangible asset is separable from the entity or that it arises from a contractual or legal right. * The Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standard Codification 350 (ASC 350) defines an intangible asset as an asset, other than a financial asset, that lacks physical substance. The lack of physical substance would therefore seem to be a defining characteristic of an intangible asset. Both the IASB and FASB definitions specifically preclude monetary assets in their definition of an intangible asset. This is necessary in order to avoid the classification of items such as accounts receivable, derivatives and cash in the bank as an intangible asset. IAS 38 contains examples of intangible assets, including: computer software, copyright and patents.  Research and development  Research and development (known also as R&D;) is considered to be an intangible asset (about 16 percent of all intangible assets in the US)Bureau of Economic Analysis (2013). Preview of the 2013 Comprehensive Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts. https://www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/2013/03%20March/0313_nipa_comprehensive_revision_preview.pdf, even though most countries treat R&D; as current expenses for both legal and tax purposes. Most countries report some intangibles in their National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA), yet no country has included a comprehensive measure of intangible assets. The contribution of intangible assets in long- term GDP growth has been recognized by economists.Corrado, Carol. Charles Hulten, and Daniel Sichel (2006). Intangible Capital and Economic Growth. Federal Reserve Board Discussion Paper N. 2006-24. April. http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2006/200624/200624pap.pdf Also of note, acquired \\"In-Process Research and Development\\" (IPR&D;) is considered an asset under US GAAP.https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/pdf/2014/01/Defining- Issues-O-1401-04.pdf IAS 38 requires any project that results in the generation of a resource to the entity be classified into two phases: a research phase, and a development phase. The classification of research and development expenditure can be highly subjective, and it is important to note that organizations may have ulterior motives in their classification of research and development expenditures. Less scrupulous directors may manipulate financial statements through misclassification of research and development expenditures. Related definitions An example of research (as defined as \\"the original and planned investigation undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding\\"): a company can carry a research on one of its products which it will use in the entity of which results in future economic income. Development is defined as \\"the application of research findings to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved materials, devices, products, processes, systems, or services, before the start of commercial production or use.\\" Accounting treatment of expenses depends on whether they are classified as research or development. Where the distinction cannot be made, IAS 38 requires that the entire project be treated as research and expensed through the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Research expenditure is highly speculative. There is no certainty that future economic benefits will flow to the entity. Prudence dictates that research expenditure be expensed through the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Development expenditure, however, is less speculative and it becomes possible to predict the future economic benefits that will flow to the entity. The matching principle dictates that development expenditure be capitalized, as the expenditure is expected to generate future economic benefit to the entity.  Financial accounting  = General standards = The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) offers some guidance (IAS 38) as to how intangible assets should be accounted for in financial statements. In general, legal intangibles that are developed internally are not recognized and legal intangibles that are purchased from third parties are recognized. Wordings are similar to IAS 9. Under US GAAP, intangible assets are classified into: Purchased vs. internally created intangibles, and Limited-life vs. indefinite-life intangibles. = Expense allocation = Intangible assets are typically expensed according to their respective life expectancy. Intangible assets have either an identifiable or an indefinite useful life. Intangible assets with identifiable useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their economic or legal life,For international legal lives by class of intangible asset, see the table in Tax amortization lives of intangible assets whichever is shorter. Examples of intangible assets with identifiable useful lives are copyrights and patents. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are reassessed each year for impairment. If an impairment has occurred, then a loss must be recognized. An impairment loss is determined by subtracting the asset's fair value from the asset's book/carrying value. Trademarks and goodwill are examples of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. Goodwill has to be tested for impairment rather than amortized. If impaired, goodwill is reduced and loss is recognized in the Income statement.  Taxation  For personal income tax purposes, some costs with respect to intangible assets must be capitalized rather than treated as deductible expenses. Treasury regulations in the USA generally require capitalization of costs associated with acquiring, creating, or enhancing intangible assets.Treas. Reg. ¬ß 1.263(a)-4. For example, an amount paid to obtain a trademark must be capitalized. Certain amounts paid to facilitate these transactions are also capitalized. Some types of intangible assets are categorized based on whether the asset is acquired from another party or created by the taxpayer. The regulations contain many provisions intended to make it easier to determine when capitalization is required.Donaldson, Samuel A. Federal Income Taxation Of Individuals: Cases, Problems and Materials (2nd ed.). St. Paul: Thomson West, 2007. pg. 200. Given the growing importance of intangible assets as a source of economic growth and tax revenue, and because their non-physical nature makes it easier for taxpayers to engage in tax strategies such as income-shifting or transfer pricing,\\"Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting.\\" (2013) Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). http://www.oecd.org/sti/inno/46349020.pdf tax authorities and international organizations have been designing ways to link intangible assets to the place where they were created, hence defining nexus. Intangibles for corporations are amortized over a 15-year period, equivalent to 180 months. Definition of \\"intangibles\\" differs from standard accounting, in some US state governments. These governments may refer to stocks and bonds as \\"intangibles\\".Florida Intangible Tax  See also  * Cognitive assets * Intellectual capital * Intellectual property ** Brand ** Copyright ** Patent ** Patent valuation ** Trademark ** Trade secret * Goodwill (accounting) * Tangible common equity * Tangible property  References  External links * National intangible capital NIC 2016 database / Findings and results for economic impacts of national intangible capital 2001 - 2016 Asset Intangible assets ","title":"Intangible asset"},{"id":"299148","text":"Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York KG (17 August 1473), was the sixth child and second son of King Edward IV of England and Elizabeth Woodville, born in Shrewsbury. Richard and his older brother, who briefly reigned as King Edward V of England, mysteriously disappeared shortly after Richard III became king in 1483. Dukedoms Prince Richard was created Duke of York in May 1474 and made a Knight of the Garter the following year. From this time on, it became a tradition for the second son of the English sovereign to be Duke of York. He was created Earl of Nottingham on 12 June 1476. On 15 January 1478, in St Stephen's Chapel, Westminster, when he was about 4 years old, he married the 5-year-old Anne de Mowbray, 8th Countess of Norfolk, who had inherited the vast Mowbray estates in 1476. Because York's father's-in-law dukedom had become extinct when Anne could not inherit it, he was created Duke of Norfolk and Earl Warenne on 7 February 1477. When Anne de Mowbray died in November 1481 her estates should have passed to William, Viscount Berkeley and to John, Lord Howard. In January 1483 Parliament passed an act that gave the Mowbray estates to Richard, Duke of York and Norfolk, for his lifetime, and at his death to his heirs, if he had any. The rights of the two co-heirs at law were extinguished; Viscount Berkeley had financial difficulties and King Edward IV paid off those debts. Berkeley then renounced his claims to the Mowbray estate before parliament in 1483. Nothing was done for Lord Howard. Heir presumptive Edward V and the Duke of York in the Tower of London by Paul Delaroche. Louvre, Paris. His father died on 9 April 1483. Thus his brother Edward, Prince of Wales, became King of England and was acclaimed as such, and Richard his Heir Presumptive. This was not to last. A priest, now generally believed to have been Robert Stillington, the Bishop of Bath and Wells, testified that Edward IV had agreed to marry Lady Eleanor Talbot in 1461.Peter Hancock, Richard III and the Murder in the Tower (History Press, 2011), Lady Eleanor was still alive when Edward married Elizabeth Woodville in 1464. The Regency council under the late King's brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester, concluded that this was a case of bigamy, invalidating the second marriage and the legitimacy of all children of Edward IV by this marriage. Under Gloucester's influence, both Edward and Richard were declared illegitimate and removed from the line of succession on 25 June 1483. The Duke of Gloucester, as the only surviving brother of Edward IV, became King Richard III. The Princes in the Tower by John Everett Millais. Royal Holloway, University of London. Possible fate The Duke of York was sent to the Tower of London, then a royal residence, by King Richard III in mid-1483, where he was held with his brother.

In the period before the boys' disappearance, Edward was regularly being visited by a doctor; historian David Baldwin extrapolates that contemporaries may have believed Edward had died either of an illness or as the result of attempts to cure him.Baldwin, David (2013) \\"The White Queen ‚Äì What happened to the Princes in the Tower?\\", BBC History In the absence of hard evidence a number of other theories have been put forward, of which the most widely discussed are that they were murdered on the orders of the Duke of Buckingham or by Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond (later King Henry VII). Bones reportedly belonging to two children were discovered in 1674 by workmen rebuilding a stairway in the Tower. On the orders of King Charles II, these were subsequently placed in Westminster Abbey, in an urn bearing the names of Edward and Richard.John Steane, The Archaeology of the Medieval English Monarchy (Routledge, 1993), page 65 The bones were re-examined in 1933 at which time it was discovered the skeletons were incomplete and had been interred with animal bones.

Adjoining this was another vault, which was found to contain the coffins of two children. This tomb was inscribed with the names of two of Edward IV's children: George, Duke of Bedford, who had died at the age of 2; and Mary of York who had died at the age of 14.

The island is located in southern Chile, in the Los Lagos Region. Of roughly rectangular shape, the southwestern half of the island is a wilderness of contiguous forests and swamps. Mountains in the island form a belt running from the northwestern to the southeastern corner of the island. Cordillera del Piuch√©n make up the northern mountains and the more subdued Cordillera de Pirulil gathers the southern mountains. The landscape of the northeastern sectors of Chilo√© Island is dominated by rolling hills with a mosaic of pastures, forests and cultivated fields. While the western shores are rocky and relatively straight the eastern and northern shores contain many inlets, bays and peninsulas and it is here where all towns and cities lie. Geographically the bulk of the island is a continuation of the Chilean Coast Range, with the sea of Chilo√© being a submerged portion of the Chilean Central Valley. The climate is cool temperate oceanic with Mediterranean precipitation pattern. Geography Ferry used between Chilean mainland and Chilo√© Island. With an area of , Chilo√© Island is the second largest island in Chile (after the Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego), the largest island completely within Chile, and the fourth largest in South America. It is separated from the Chilean mainland by the Chacao Strait (Canal Chacao) to the north, and by the Gulf of Ancud (Golfo de Ancud) and the Gulf of Corcovado (Golfo Corcovado) to the east; the Pacific Ocean lies to the west, and the Chonos Archipelago lies to the south, across the Boca del Guafo. The island is from north to south, and averages wide. The capital is Castro, on the east side of the island; the second largest town is Ancud, at the island's northwest corner, and there are several smaller port towns on the east side of the island, such as Quell√≥n, Dalcahue and Chonchi. Chilo√© Island and the Chonos Archipelago are a southern extension of the Chilean coastal range at Chilean Patagonia, which runs north and south, parallel to the Pacific coast and the Andes Mountains. The Chilean Central Valley lies between the coastal mountains and the Andes, of which the Gulfs of Ancud and Corcovado form the southern extension. Mountains run north and south along the spine of the island. The east coast is deeply indented, with several natural harbors and numerous smaller islands. Climate Panoramic view of Castro. Chilo√© runs from 41¬∫47‚Ä≤S to 43¬∫26‚Ä≤S, and has a humid, cool temperate climate. The western side of the island is rainy and wild, home to the Valdivian temperate rain forests, one of the world's few temperate rain forests. Chilo√© National Park (Parque Nacional de Chilo√©) is located on the island's western shore and Tantauco Park (Parque Tantauco) a private natural reserve created and owned by Chilean business magnate and President of Chile Sebasti√°n Pi√±era, is located on the island's southern shore and both include parts of the coastal range. The eastern shore, in the rain shadow of the interior mountains, is warmer and drier.  Alfaguara project  The northwestern of Chilo√© Island in Chilo√© National Park has a great diversity of marine fauna, including blue whale, sei whale, Chilean dolphins and Peale's dolphins; sea lions, marine otters, and Magellanic penguin and Humboldt penguins. Nevertheless, this relatively undisturbed area faces different threats, like urban development, habitat degradation, land and marine pollution. The Alfaguara project (blue whale project), conducted by the Cetacean Conservation Center, is based at Pu√±ihuil on the northwest coast. The project combines long-term research, educational and capacity building programs for marine conservation combined with the sustainable development of the local communities. The Islotes de Pu√±ihuil Natural Monument is a group of three islets to the west and north of Pu√±ihuil. The monument is the only known shared breeding site for Humboldt and Magellanic penguins. It is also a breeding area for other species, such as the red-legged cormorant and kelp gull.

The standard also holds that each person owes a duty to behave as a reasonable person would under the same or similar circumstances.Franklin, at 54 While the specific circumstances of each case will require varying kinds of conduct and degrees of care, the reasonable person standard undergoes no variation itself.Franklin, at 55 The \\"reasonable person\\" construct can be found applied in many areas of the law. The standard performs a crucial role in determining negligence in both criminal law‚Äîthat is, criminal negligence‚Äîand tort law. The standard is also used in contract law,For the use in transnational contract law: Trans-Lex.org to determine contractual intent, or (when there is a duty of care) whether there has been a breach of the standard of care. The intent of a party can be determined by examining the understanding of a reasonable person, after consideration is given to all relevant circumstances of the case including the negotiations, any practices the parties have established between themselves, usages and any subsequent conduct of the parties. The standard does not exist independently of other circumstances within a case that could affect an individual's judgement History In 1835, Adolphe Quetelet detailed the characteristics of l'homme moyen (French, \\"average man\\"). His work is translated into English several ways. As a result, some authors pick \\"average man\\", \\"common man\\", \\"reasonable man\\", or stick to the original \\"l'homme moyen\\". Quetelet was a Belgian astronomer, mathematician, statistician and sociologist. He documented the physical characteristics of man on a statistical basis and discussed man's motivations when acting in society. Two years later, the \\"reasonable person\\" made his first appearance in the English case of Vaughan v. Menlove (1837). In Menlove, the defendant had stacked hay on his rental property in a manner prone to spontaneous ignition. After he had been repeatedly warned over the course of five weeks, the hay ignited and burned the defendant's barns and stable and then spread to the landlord's two cottages on the adjacent property. Menlove's attorney admitted his client's \\"misfortune of not possessing the highest order of intelligence,\\" arguing that negligence should only be found if the jury decided Menlove had not acted with \\"bona fide [and] to the best of his [own] judgment.\\" The Menlove court disagreed, reasoning that such a standard would be too subjective, instead preferring to set an objective standard for adjudicating cases: English courts upheld the standard again nearly 20 years later in Blyth v. Company Proprietors of the Birmingham Water Works, holding: Rationale American jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. explained the theory behind the reasonable person standard as stemming from the impossibility of \\"measuring a man's powers and limitations.\\"Holmes, at 108. Individual, personal quirks inadvertently injuring the persons or property of others are no less damaging than intentional acts. For society to function, \\"a certain average of conduct, a sacrifice of individual peculiarities going beyond a certain point, is necessary to the general welfare.\\" Thus, a reasonable application of the law is sought, compatible with planning, working, or getting along with others. As such, \\"his neighbors accordingly require him, at his proper peril, to come up to their standard, and the courts which they establish decline to take his personal equation into account.\\" He heralded the reasonable person as a legal fiction whose care conduct under any common set of facts, is chosen‚Äîor \\"learned\\" permitting there is a compelling consensus of public opinion‚Äîby the courts. The reasonable person standard is by no means democratic in its scope; it is, contrary to popular conception, intentionally distinct from that of the \\"average person,\\" who is not necessarily guaranteed to always be reasonable. The reasonable person will weigh all of the following factors before acting: * the foreseeable risk of harm his actions create versus the utility of his actions; * the extent of the risk so created; * the likelihood such risk will actually cause harm to others; * any alternatives of lesser risk, and the costs of those alternatives. Taking such actions requires the reasonable person to be appropriately informed, capable, aware of the law, and fair-minded. Such a person might do something extraordinary in certain circumstances, but whatever that person does or thinks, it is always reasonable. The reasonable person has been called an \\"excellent but odious character.\\"Herbert, at 12. English legal scholar Percy Henry Winfield summarized much of the literature by observing that: Hand Rule Under United States common law, a well known‚Äîthough nonbinding‚Äîtest for determining how a reasonable person might weigh the criteria listed above was set down in United States v. Carroll Towing Co. in 1947 by the Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Learned Hand. The case concerned a barge that had broken her mooring with the dock. Writing for the court, Hand said: While the test offered by Hand does not encompass all the criteria available above, juries in a negligence case might well still be instructed to take the other factors into consideration in determining whether the defendant was negligent.Glannon, at pg. 74. Personal circumstances While the legal fiction of the reasonable person represents the ideal human actor, one would be hard-pressed to characterize any individual human as meeting the standard, whether in whole or in part, all of the time. Since some human actors have limitations, the standard only requires that people act similarly to how \\"a reasonable person under the circumstance\\" would, as if their limitations were themselves circumstances. As such, courts require that the reasonable person be viewed as experiencing the same limitations as the defendant. For example, a disabled defendant is held to a standard that, by necessity, represents how a reasonable person with that same disability would act. One should not mistake this allowance for physical limitations as an allowance for poor judgment, attempting acts beyond one's abilities, or acting too quickly, etc. Were such allowances made for every defendant, there would be as many different standards for negligence as there were defendants; and courts would spend innumerable hours, and the parties much more money, on determining that particular defendant's reasonableness, character, and intelligence. By using the reasonable person standard, the courts instead use an objective tool and avoid such subjective evaluations. The result is a standard that allows the law to behave in a uniform, foreseeable, and neutral manner when attempting to determine liability. =Children= One broad allowance made to the reasonable person standard is for children. The standard here requires that a child act in a similar manner to how a \\"reasonable person of like age, intelligence, and experience under like circumstances\\" would act.Restatement of the Law, Second, Torts. ¬ß283A In many common law systems, children under the age of 6 or 7 are typically exempt from any liability, whether civil or criminal, as they are deemed to be unable to understand the risk involved in their actions. This is called the defense of infancy: in Latin, doli incapax. In some jurisdictions, one of the exceptions to these allowances concern children engaged in what is primarily considered to be high-risk adult activity, such as operating a motor vehicle, and in some jurisdictions, children can also be \\"tried as an adult\\" for serious crimes, such as murder, which causes the court to disregard the defendant's age. =Mentally ill= The reasonable person standard makes no allowance for the mentally ill. Such a refusal goes back to the standard set in Menlove, where Menlove's attorney argued for the subjective standard. In the 170 years since, the law has kept to the legal judgment of having only the single, objective standard. Such judicial adherence sends a message that the mentally ill would do better to refrain from taking risk-creating actions, unless they exercise a heightened degree of self-restraint and precaution, if they intend to avoid liability. Generally, the courts have rationed that by not accepting mental illness as a bar to recovery, a liable third party, in the form of a caregiver, will be more likely to protect the public because of the potential for liability. The courts have also stated that the reasoning behind the harsh treatment is because, unlike children or the physically disabled, members of the public are unable to identify a person with a mental illness. =Professionals= In cases where a human actor utilizes a professional skill set, the \\"reasonable person under the circumstances\\" test becomes elevated to a standard of whether the person acted how a \\"reasonable professional under the circumstances\\" would have, without regard to whether that actor is actually a professional, and further without regard to the degree of training or experience of that particular actor. Other factors also become relevant, such as the degree to which the professional is educated (i.e., whether a specialist within the specific field, or just a general practitioner of the trade), and customary practices and general procedures of similar professionals. However, such other relevant factors are never dispositive. Some professions may maintain a custom or practice long after a better method has become available. The new practices, though less risky, may be entirely ignored. In such cases, the practitioner may very well have acted unreasonably despite following custom or general practices.Bolitho v. City and Hackney Health Authority [1997] 4 All ER 771 Medical professionals In the realm of healthcare, plaintiffs must prove via expert testimony the standard of medical care owed and a departure from that standard. The only exception to the requirement of expert testimony is where the departure from accepted medical practices was so egregious that a layperson can readily recognize the departure. However, controversial medical practices can be deemed reasonable when followed by a respected and reputable minority of the medical field, or where the medical profession cannot agree over which practices are best. Armed professionals The \\"reasonable officer\\" standard is a method often applied to law enforcement and other armed professions to help determine if a use of force was correctly applied. The test is usually applied to whether the level of force used was excessive or not. If an appropriately trained professional, knowing what the subject of the investigation knew at the time and following their agency guidelines (such as a force continuum), would have used the same level of force or higher, then the standard is met. If the level of response is determined to be justified, the quantity of force used is usually presumed to have been necessary unless there are additional factors. For example, should it be determined that a trained police officer was justified in using deadly force against a suspect, the number of times he fired is presumed to have been necessary to stop the suspect's action that justified use of deadly force, as long as there are no other factors, such as a reckless disregard of other officers' or bystanders' safety, or it is clearly proven that additional force was used after the suspect was no longer a threat. =Inexperience= When any person undertakes a skills-based activity that creates a risk to others, they are held to the minimum standard of how a reasonable person experienced in that task would act, regardless of their actual level of experience. External circumstances Factors external to the defendant are always relevant. Additionally, so is the context within which each action is made. It is within these circumstances that the determinations and actions of the defendant are to be judged. There are myriad factors that could provide inputs into how a person acts: individual perceptions, knowledge, the weather, etc. The standard of care required for each set of circumstances will vary, yet the level of care due is always what is reasonable for that set of circumstances. While community customs may be relied upon to indicate what kind of action is expected in light of given circumstances, such customary requirements are not themselves conclusive of what a reasonable person would do. It is precisely for this wide-ranging variety of possible facts that the reasonable person standard is so broad (and often confusing and difficult to apply). However, a few general areas of relevant circumstances rise above the others. =Emergency doctrine= Allowing for circumstances under which a person must act urgently is important to preventing hindsight bias from affecting the trier of fact. Given pressing circumstances, a reasonable person may not always act in a manner similar to how they would have acted in a more relaxed setting. As such, it is only fair that actions be judged in light of any exigent conditions that could have affected how the defendant acted.Restatement of the Law, Second, Torts. ¬ß296 =Available resources= In certain circumstances, human actors are faced with the problem of making do only with what is available. Such circumstances are relevant to any determination of whether the defendant acted reasonably. Where necessary resources are scarce, certain actions may be reasonable that would be unreasonable if those same resources were available and either readily at hand or realistically obtainable given other circumstances. =Negligence per se= Because a reasonable person is objectively presumed to know the law, noncompliance with a local safety statute may also constitute negligence. The related doctrine of negligence per se addresses the circumstances under which the law of negligence can become an implied cause of action for breaching a statutory standard of care. Conversely, minimal compliance with a safety statute does not always absolve a defendant if the trier of fact determines that the reasonable person should have taken actions beyond and in excess of what the statute required. However, if the trier of fact finds the statute's standard itself is reasonable and the defendant acted in accordance with what the statute contemplated, the duty of care can be deemed met.Restatement of the Law, Second, Torts. ¬ß288C Reasonable bystander For common law contracts, disputes over contract formation are subjected to what is known as the objective test of assent in order to determine whether a contract exists. This standard is also known as the officious bystander, reasonable bystander, reasonable third party, or reasonable person in the position of the party.Blum, at pg. 53. This is in contrast to the subjective test employed in most civil law jurisdictions. The test stems from attempts to balance the competing interests of the judicial policies of assent and of reliability. The former holds that no person ought to be contractually obligated if they did not consent to such an agreement; the latter holds that if no person can rely on actions or words demonstrating consent, then the whole system of commercial exchange will ultimately collapse.Blum, at pg. 52. Prior to the 19th century, courts used a test of subjective evaluation; that is, the trier of fact determined each party's understanding.Blum, at pg. 54. If both parties were of the same mind and understanding on matters, then assent was manifested and the contract was valid. Between the 19th and 20th centuries, the courts shifted toward the objectivist test, reasoning that subjective testimony was often unreliable and self-serving. From those opposite principles, modern law has found its way to a rough middle ground, though it still shows a strong bias toward the objective test. Promises and agreements are reached through manifestations of consent, and parties are liable for actions that deliberately manifest such consent; however, evidence of either party's state of mind can be used to determine the context of the manifestation if said evidence is reliable and compatible with the manifestation in question, though such evidence is typically given very little weight. Another circumstance where the reasonable bystander test is used occurs when one party has inadvertently misstated the terms of the contract, and the other party sues to enforce those terms: if it would have been clear to a reasonable bystander that a mistake had been made, then the contract is voidable by the party who made the error; otherwise, the contract is binding. Reasonable person standard for victims =Reasonable woman=  Sexual harassment  A variant of the reasonable person can be found in sexual harassment law as the reasonable woman standard. The variation recognizes a difference between men and women regarding the effect of unwanted interaction with a sexual tone. As women have historically been more vulnerable to rape and sex-related violence than have men, some courts believe that the proper perspective for evaluating a claim of sexual harassment is that of the reasonable woman. Notably, J. Scalia held that women did not have constitutional protection from discrimination under the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause, where by extension of logic, held the \\"reasonable woman\\" standard to be of moot value. However, such has not been the majority opinion of the court. Satire Though the use of the reasonable woman standard has gained traction in some areas of the law, the standard has not escaped the crosshairs of humorists. In 1924, legal humorist A. P. Herbert considered the concept of the reasonable man at length in the fictional case of \\"Fardell v. Potts.\\" In Herbert's fictional account, the judge addressed the lack of a reasonable woman standard in the common law, and ultimately concluded that \\"a reasonable woman does not exist.\\" =L'homme moyen sensuel= The concept of l'homme moyen sensuel does not speak of a reasonable person's ability, actions, or understandings. Rather it refers to the response of a reasonable person when presented with some form of information either by image or sound, or upon reading a book or magazine. A well-known application of the concept is Judge John M. Woolsey's lifting of the ban on the book Ulysses by James Joyce. That ruling contemplated the effect the book would have upon a reasonable person of reasonable sensibility. Similarly, when the publisher of Howl and Other Poems was charged in California with publishing an obscene book, the concept of l'homme moyen sensuel influenced the court's finding of innocence. It was nearly two decades after Woolsey that the US Supreme Court set down the standard by which materials, when viewed by l'homme moyen sensuel, were judged either obscene or not.A tendency to deprave and corrupt, Washington Law Review Vol.85, No. 2, 2007 Generally, it has been l'homme moyen sensuel that has dictated what is and is not obscene or pornographic in books, movies, pictures, and now the Internet for at least the past 100 years. =Qualifications= Very often, for instance, in the case of noise ordinances, the enforcement of the law is only for the purpose of protecting the right of a \\"reasonable person of normal sensitivity\\".Bozeman, Montana Noise Ordinance  See also  *Objective historian * Bonus pater familias * Casuistry * Contract * Gender discrimination * Jury instructions * Legal Fiction * Officious bystander * Reasonable doubt * Reasonable suspicion * Standard of care in English law * The man on the Clapham omnibus * Torts References =Notes= = Sources =  * Miller, Alan & Perry, Ronen, The Reasonable Person, New York University Law Review  Common law Criminal law Tort law Law of negligence English legal terminology Scots law American legal terminology Elements of crime Legal fictions Legal doctrines and principles Sexual harassment in the United States Legal reasoning ","title":"Reasonable person"},{"id":"299172","text":"M√©dard Chouart des Groseilliers (1618‚Äì1696) was a French explorer and fur trader in Canada. He is often paired with his brother-in-law Pierre-Esprit Radisson, who was about 20 years younger. The pair worked together in fur trading and exploration. Their decision to enter British service led to the foundation of the Hudson's Bay Company in 1670. This company established trading posts and extensive relations with the First Nations in western Canada. It was highly influential in making the region amenable to British colonization. Radisson, with Groseiliers, also mapped many of the Great Lakes and trading routes used by settlers in the early 19th century. Early life M√©dard Chouart was born in Charly-sur-Marne, Champagne province, France, to M√©dard Chouart, his father and Marie Poirier. He also had a cousin named M√©dard Chouart. He later called himself Sieur des Groseilliers after a farm his parents managed in Bassevelle. He was reported to have immigrated to New France in 1641 at age 23, but according to Historian Grace Lee Nute, this has never been proven. He became a donn√© or lay helper at the Jesuit missions in the Huron region near present-day Simcoe County, Ontario. Here he learned the skills of a coureur des bois. In 1646, Groseilliers fought with the Huron against the Iroquois. On 3 September 1647 Groseilliers married the widowed Hel√®ne Martin, the daughter of Abraham Martin, whose land surrounding Quebec City later became famous as the Plains of Abraham. Their first child died in 1648. Their second child, also named M√©dard, was born in 1651, the same year Hel√®ne died. After the Iroquois destroyed the Huron missions and forced the people to move further west in the late 1640s, Groseilliers worked to re- establish trade, especially in the Lake Superior region. In 1653, Groseilliers travelled to Acadia to meet with Claude de la Tour and returned to New France in July and establishing himself at Trois-Rivi√®res. There he married his second wife, Margu√©rite Hayet, (sometimes spelled Hayot) the widowed step- sister of Pierre-Esprit Radisson and from whom he inherited his lands in Trois-Rivi√®res. Two sons from her first marriage became troublesome and in 1654, Groseilliers petitioned the governor of New France to find the boys another guardian, which was accepted. His first child by Margu√©rite, Jean Baptiste, was baptized on 5 July 1654. His second child by Margu√©rite, also named Margu√©rite, was baptized on 15 April 1659 and his third child, Marie- Antoinette, was baptized on 8 June 1661. As a fur trader =French service= Historic marker in Ashland, Wisconsin In August 1654, Groseilliers was sent west along with an unknown partner, to journey west to the new Huron lands. The voyage took two years to complete and upon returning in August 1656, they carried in their canoes reports of contact with several First Nations, among them the Sioux, Pottawattomi, Winnebago and Fox peoples and furs worth \\"14 to 15 thousand livres\\". Leaving in August 1659, Groseilliers and Radisson traveled west to the far end of Lake Superior and wintered at Lac Courte Oreilles in what is now known as Wisconsin. According to Radisson's account of the voyage, they helped repel an Iroquois attack along the Ottawa River and that the idea for trading furs from Hudson Bay came to them at this time. They returned in the summer of 1660 and upon return to New France, they were fined most of their profits by the colonial government because they had left New France without a license. This journey demonstrated that the French could find riches in the interior of the continent and this led more Frenchmen to go west, with seven heading to Lake Superior within the year. From Cree traders, the French men came to understand that the main source of furs lay northwest of the lake. In 1661, Groseilliers traveled to France to appeal the fine without success and returned to New France the same year. Groseilliers and Radisson proposed creating a trading company for the furs to Jean-Baptiste Colbert, the French minister of finance under King Louis XIV. Colbert thought it a waste of resources and refused to support the project. In Spring 1662, Groseilliers and Radisson intended to journey to the west via the Hudson Bay region. In order to get to Hudson Bay from Isle Perc√©e, Groseilliers intended to charter a vessel. However, the plans fell through and Groseilliers and Radisson instead searched further south in New England in hope of finding a suitable vessel. = Formation of the Hudson's Bay Company = Groseilliers and Radisson traveled to Boston in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. They organized another expedition into Hudson Bay in 1663, but it was turned back by the ice. At Boston in 1665 they met Sir George Cartwright, who told them to travel to England to gain support. Captured by Dutch privateers on the voyage, the French men were put ashore in Spain. Reaching England, they were presented to King Charles II and became associated with Prince Rupert. Eventually Prince Rupert chartered two vessels for Radisson and Groseilliers. In 1668 two ships left England for Hudson Bay: under the command of Zachariah Gillam with Groseilliers as his second and Eaglet with William Stannard as captain and Radisson as his second. Eaglet was caught in a storm, was damaged and forced to return to England. Nonsuch made it to Hudson Bay and continued south, into James Bay. Nonsuch reached the mouth of the Rupert River which was named after their benefactor. They landed near what is now the town of Waskaganish, Quebec, where they built a fort and wintered there. The expedition returned to England in 1669 with a rich cargo of furs. The haul of furs impressed King Charles and led Prince Rupert and his fellow investors to create the \\"Company of Adventurers of England Trading into Hudsons Bay\\", also known as the Hudson's Bay Company, on 2 May 1670. The Hudson's Bay Company was given monopoly over the area of land that would become known as Rupert's Land. From 1670 to 1675, Groseilliers and Radisson were employed by the Hudson's Bay Company, voyaging into Hudson Bay to establish trading posts, forts and exploring the area. Their activities were watched with interest by the French whose economy suffered from the arrival of English fur traders. =Return to French service= 1681 French map of the New World above the equator: New France and the Great Lakes in the north, with a dark line as the Mississippi River to the west in the Illinois Country and the mouth of the river (and future New Orleans) then terra incognita In 1674, a French Jesuit priest, Charles Albanel, was sent north into Hudson Bay. Captured by representatives of the Hudson's Bay Company, Albanel was sent to England as a prisoner. In England he convinced Groseilliers and Radisson to return to French service. Groseilliers traveled to France and spent the year before returning to New France in 1676. On 20 May 1682 the French created their own fur-trading company, called La Compagnie de la Baie d‚ÄôHudson or Compagnie du Nord, given charter by the French government. The company was created to compete with the Hudson's Bay Company. Groseilliers joined the company and with Radisson, sailed north to the Hayes and Nelson Rivers to create a French trading post. Similar expeditions from the Hudson's Bay Company and a group from Boston under the leadership of Benjamin Gillam arrived at the same time. The three groups fought with the experienced leadership of Radisson and Groseilliers coming out victorious. They took the majority of the Bostonians and Hudson's Bay Company personnel captive, including the new governor of Hudson Bay, John Bridgar and seized furs from their former employer. Upon their return to New France, the two Frenchmen found that their actions had angered the British and alarmed French officials. In order to cover the British losses the Compagnie du Nord was forced to pay taxes on their furs. Radisson and Groseilliers sailed to France in 1683 for adjudication on the tax matter. The French government found in favour of the British, whose leader the Duke of York was France's best chance to re-convert the English back to Catholicism. While in France, Groseilliers refused an offer to rejoin the Hudson's Bay Company and returned to his farm at Trois-Rivi√®res. His final fate is unknown.

Twelve books were published between 1947 and 1974. The series became a classic among books for children in Chile. The books are written in the form of diaries by the title character, a middle-class, 8-year-old Chilean boy in Santiago. This makes it different from many other children's books, which are set in unreal surroundings. Papelucho is able to find interest and humour in everyday life, and does this by means of an exuberant fantasy, a strong sense of observation and ridicule, and highly developed originality and creativity. In this respect it shows similarity with other widely read works of the European children's literature, which also depict the adventures of children's everyday life, such as Goscinny and Semp√©'s Le petit Nicolas series, Richmal Crompton's Just William series, and Elena Fort√∫n's Celia books. The first book of the series, Papelucho, was published in 1947, after it won an award in a contest arranged by a young Chilean publishing house, Rapa Nui. The illustrations were by Yolanda Huneeus, a sister of the author. The book very quickly became a bestseller in Chile and one edition followed another. Eleven books followed; the last one appeared in 1974: Am I Dys-Lazy? The sales of the series, in all editions starting from 1947, summed in 2007 up to more than five million copies sold. It is listed as \\"recommended reading\\" at Chilean schools and is currently (2011) edited by Random House in Santiago, Chile.  Awards  Chile's main award in letters, the Premio Nacional de Literatura, was given to Marcela Paz in 1982, a few years before her death in 1985. In 1968, Papelucho the Missionary was a candidate for the Hans Christian Andersen Award from the International Board on Books for Young People (IBBY) in Amrisville, Switzerland. There are adaptations for the theater and as comics (2011). Translations A French edition of the first book in the series came out in 1951 in the collection Rouge et Bleu (GP publishers,translated and adapted by G. Tyl-Cambier). The text was adapted and published with coloured illustrations as a large format book, which was very successful, 25,000 copies being rapidly sold and a second edition appearing two years later. In 1980 a new French edition appeared and survived several changes in the editing house: Bordas being succeeded by Pocket, then Havas Poche, until the end of the nineties. The Japanese publishing house Kodansha published in 1972 a Japanese translation with drawings by Marcela Claro Huneeus, the author's daughter. A Greek edition was published by Kedros, Athens, 1984. And recently Anicia in Rome has published an Italian translation of four of the books. There is also a bilingual Spanish-English edition, which was available in Chile at the end of 2006. The English translation was made by Lina Craddock, Ailsa Shaw and Jean Paul Beuchat, Movie Cine Animadores and Canal 13 Films released in 2007 the film Papelucho and the Martian, loosely based on the book of the same name. Comic book Papelucho was also adapted into a comics series, drawn by Walter Carzon.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/c/carzon_walter.htm Bibliography The Papelucho series consists of 12 books:\\"Paz, Marcela\\", article in Kuemmerling-Meibauer, Bettina, Klassiker der Kinder- und Jugendliteratur.

Insoluble compounds (and granulates) remain within the coffee filter. Fig. 2: Percolation in a square lattice (Click to animate) In physics, chemistry and materials science, percolation (from Latin percolare, \\"to filter\\" or \\"trickle through\\") refers to the movement and filtering of fluids through porous materials. It is described by Darcy's law. Broader applications have since been developed that cover connectivity of many systems modeled as lattices or graphs, analogous to connectivity of lattice components in the filtration problem that modulates capacity for percolation. Background During the last decades, percolation theory, the mathematical study of percolation, has brought new understanding and techniques to a broad range of topics in physics, materials science, complex networks, epidemiology, and other fields. For example, in geology, percolation refers to filtration of water through soil and permeable rocks. The water flows to recharge the groundwater in the water table and aquifers. In places where infiltration basins or septic drain fields are planned to dispose of substantial amounts of water, a percolation test is needed beforehand to determine whether the intended structure is likely to succeed or fail. In two dimensional square lattice percolation is defined as follows. A site is \\"occupied\\" with probability p or \\"empty\\" (in which case its edges are removed) with probability 1 ‚Äì p; the corresponding problem is called site percolation, see Fig. 2. Percolation typically exhibits universality. Statistical physics concepts such as scaling theory, renormalization, phase transition, critical phenomena and fractals are used to characterize percolation properties. Combinatorics is commonly employed to study percolation thresholds. Due to the complexity involved in obtaining exact results from analytical models of percolation, computer simulations are typically used. The current fastest algorithm for percolation was published in 2000 by Mark Newman and Robert Ziff. Examples * Coffee percolation (see Fig. 1), where the solvent is water, the permeable substance is the coffee grounds, and the soluble constituents are the chemical compounds that give coffee its color, taste, and aroma. * Movement of weathered material down on a slope under the earth's surface. * Cracking of trees with the presence of two conditions, sunlight and under the influence of pressure. * Collapse and robustness of biological virus shells to random subunit removal (experimentally-verified fragmentation of viruses). * Robustness of networks to random and targeted attacks. * Transport in porous media. * Epidemic spreading. * Surface roughening. * Dental percolation, increase rate of decay under crowns because of a conducive environment for strep mutants and lactobacillus * Potential sites for septic systems are tested by the \\"perk test\\". Example/theory: A hole (usually 6‚Äì10 inches in diameter) is dug in the ground surface (usually 12‚Äì24\\" deep). Water is filled in to the hole, and the time is measured for a drop of one inch in the water surface. If the water surface quickly drops, as usually seen in poorly-graded sands, then it is a potentially good place for a septic \\"leach field\\". If the hydraulic conductivity of the site is low (usually in clayey and loamy soils), then the site is undesirable. * Traffic percolation. *Percolation in the presence of reinforced (decentralization of the network) has been studied by Yuan et al.

Life and career Ali Kelmendi was born on 3 November 1900 in a poor peasant family in the town of ƒ∞pek in the Kosovo Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire (in present-day Kosovo), son of Sulejman Kelmendi. In 1920 he fled to Albania after all communist activities were banned in Kingdom of Yugoslavia. There he joined the left-wing political movement \\"Bashkimi\\" (English:Unity) of Avni Rustemi, Llazar Fundo, and Fuat Asllani. In June 1924, he participated in the resurgence led by Fan Noli in Albania as a fighter. After the fall of Noli's regime (December 1924) he emigrated to Brindisi, Italy, thereafter to Austria. Kelmendi joined the anti- Zogist group KONARE (, ) founded by Noli. On 8 October 1925 Kelmendi went then to the Soviet Union together with other 13 Albanians based on a study-related invitation from COMINTERN. He passed one year in the Dzerzhinsky Academy in Leningrad (today's \\"Grand Duke Mikhail Pavlovich\\"), and after that he moved to Odessa to work as customs official. There he joined the Albanian communist group affiliated to the Balkan Confederation of Communist Parties belonging to the Communist International. In 1930, the Communist International sent Kelmendi to Albania as an organizer of the communist movement. He also made some organizational work in Kosovo. However, his work bore no considerable fruit since Marxism hadn't found any favorable soil in Albania and the clandestine work was very difficult because of the activity of the security police. Kelmendi was arrested several times and in 1936 he was exiled. He went shortly back to Russia in March 1932, and after the exile from Albania to Greece and then Moscow. He later server as an intermediary between COMINTERN and Albanian communist groups. Kelmendi participated in the Spanish Civil War. In 1939, he edited a propagandist newspaper in France together with other Albanian communists. He died in Paris, France, on 11 February 1939 after complications from a stomach surgery, while suffering from tuberculosis.

Life  Born in Valenciennes, Nord, son of a mason, his early studies were under Fran√ßois Rude. Carpeaux entered the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in 1844 and won the Prix de Rome in 1854, and moving to Rome to find inspiration, he there studied the works of Michelangelo, Donatello and Verrocchio. Staying in Rome from 1854 to 1861, he obtained a taste for movement and spontaneity, which he joined with the great principles of baroque art. Carpeaux sought real life subjects in the streets and broke with the classical tradition. Carpeaux debuted at the Salon in 1853 exhibiting La Soumission d'Abd-el-Kader al'Empereur, a bas-relief in plaster that did not attract much attention. Carpeaux was an admirer of Napol√©on III and followed him from city to city during Napol√©on's official trip through the north of France. After initially not making any contact with the emperor, he finally succeeded in arranging a face-to-face encounter at Amiens where he managed to convince Napol√©on to commission a marble statue that was to be carried out by a practitioner, Charles Romain Capellaro. Carpeaux soon grew tired of academicism and became a wanderer on the streets of Rome. He spent free time admiring the frescoes of Michelangelo at the Sistine Chapel. Carpeaux said, \\"When an artist feels pale and cold, he runs to Michelangelo in order to warm himself, as with the rays of the sun\\". While a student in Rome, Carpeaux submitted a plaster version of P√™cheur napolitain √† la coquille, the Neapolitan Fisherboy, to the French Academy. He carved the marble version several years later, showing it in the Salon exhibition of 1863. It was purchased for Napoleon III's empress, Eug√©nie. The statue of the young smiling boy was very popular, and Carpeaux created a number of reproductions and variations in marble and bronze. There is a copy, for instance, in the Samuel H. Kress Collection in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. Some years later, he carved the Girl with a Shell, a similar study. In 1861, he made a bust of Princess Mathilde, and this later brought him several commissions from Napoleon III. Then in 1866, he established his own atelier in order to reproduce and make work on a grander scale. In 1866, he was awarded the chevalier of the Legion of Honour. He employed his brother as the sales manager and made a calculated effort to produce work that would appeal to a larger audience.Frusco, Peter, Janson, H.W., The Romantics to Rodin, George Braziller, Inc., 1980 On 12 October 1875, he died at George Barbu »òtirbei's ch√¢teau in B√©con-les-Bruy√®res, outside Courbevoie.

It was held in conjunction with the Barony of Audley (created 1312 in the Peerage of England), the Barony of Audley of Orier (created with the earldom in the Peerage of Ireland), and the Barony of Audley of Hely (created for the third Earl in 1633, in the Peerage of England). Upon the attainder and execution of the second earl for sodomy, under the Buggery Act 1533 in 1631, he forfeited his English peerage, but not his Irish titles; this was because his English barony of Audley had been created for heirs general, but his Irish earldom and barony was an entailed honour protected by statute De Donis. His son, the third earl, was created Baron Audley of Hely on 3 June 1633 by letters patent, with the precedence of his grandfather, in an attempt to restore to him the original Barony of Audley. However, this was deemed insufficient to do so; a bill was passed in Parliament in 1678 which allowed him to inherit the original Barony despite the attainder. Within months he was barred from the House of Lords as a Roman Catholic under the Second Test Act. With the death of the eighth earl, the Earldom of Castlehaven and the Baronies of Audley of Hely and Audley of Orier became extinct. The Barony of Audley created by writ of 1312 devolved upon his nephew, George Thicknesse, 19th Baron Audley.

A son of George Tuchet, 1st Earl of Castlehaven and 11th Baron Audley, by his wife, Lucy Mervyn, he was known by the courtesy title of Lord Audley during his father's lifetime, so is sometimes referred to as Mervyn Audley. He was knighted by James I in 1608, before he studied law at the Middle Temple. He served as Member of the Parliament of England for Dorset in the Addled Parliament of 1614 and was a Justice of the Peace for the counties of Dorset, Somerset, and Wiltshire. He succeeded his father on 20 February 1616/7 as Earl of Castlehaven and Baron Audley. He left six children upon his death.. Sometime before 1608 (records of the marriage are lacking), Lord Audley married Elizabeth Barnham, a sister-in-law of the philosopher and scientist Francis Bacon, and with her he had six children. By all accounts the marriage was a loving and successful one, ending with her death in 1622.. His second marriage, on 22 July 1624, at Harefield, Middlesex, was to the former Lady Anne Stanley (1580‚Äì1647), elder daughter and co-heiress of Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby (by his wife, Alice Spencer), and widow of Grey Brydges, 5th Baron Chandos. They had a daughter, Anne Touchet, who died young. Lady Anne was significantly older than Castlehaven, and the marriage was not a success, but in 1628 Lord Castlehaven's son was married to her thirteen-year- old daughter, Elizabeth; a marriage of step-children. Trial on charges of rape and sodomy In 1630, Castlehaven was publicly accused of raping his wife and committing sodomy with two of his servants. Castlehaven's son, James, claimed that it was the extent of Castlehaven's \\"uxoriousness\\" toward his male favourites which led to his initial lodging of a complaint.. At a trial by his peers, it was stated that one such favourite, Henry Skipwith, had arrived at Fonthill Gifford in 1621 and that within a few years he was so close to Castlehaven that he sat at the family's table and was to be addressed as \\"Mister Skipwith\\" by the servants. Several years later, Giles Broadway arrived at the house and received similar treatment. It was not long before Castlehaven was providing Skipwith with an annual pension, and he was accused of attempting to have Skipwith inseminate his daughter-in-law, to produce an heir from Skipwith instead of his son. In fact, the countess and Skipwith had an adulterous relationship. Charges were brought against Castlehaven on the complaint of his eldest son and heir, who feared disinheritance, and were heard by the Privy Council under the direction of Thomas Coventry, Lord High Steward. Lady Castlehaven gave evidence of a household which she said was infested with debauchery, and the Attorney-General acting for the prosecution explained to the court that Castlehaven had become ill because \\"he believed not God\\", an impiety which made Castlehaven unsafe. However, he insisted he was not guilty and that his wife and son had conspired together in an attempt to commit judicial murder. All witnesses against Castlehaven would gain materially by his death (as the defendant put it: \\"It is my estate, my Lords, that does accuse me this day, and nothing else\\") and \\"News writers throughout England and as far away as Massachusetts Bay speculated about the outcome.\\" Castlehaven maintained his innocence, and the trial aroused considerable public debate, After some deliberation the Privy Council returned a unanimous verdict of guilty on the charge of rape. The sodomy charge was also upheld, but by a slim margin as not all jurors agreed that actual penetration had taken place. The case remains of interest to some as an early trial concerning male homosexuality, but ultimately its greatest influence proved to be as a precedent in spousal rights, as it became the leading case establishing an injured wife's right to testify against her husband. Castlehaven was convicted, attainted, and three weeks later beheaded on Tower Hill for his sexual crimes: namely the \\"unnatural crime\\" of sodomy, committed with his page Laurence (or Florence) FitzPatrick, who confessed to the crime and was executed; and assisting Giles Browning (alias Broadway), who was also executed, in the rape of his wife Anne, Countess of Castlehaven, in which Lord Castlehaven was found to have participated by restraining her. The page who was executed, Laurence FitzPatrick, testified that Lady Castlehaven \\"was the wickedest woman in the world, and had more to answer for than any woman that lived\\". In The Complete Peerage, Cokayne adds that the death of Castlehaven was certainly brought about by his wife's manipulations and that her undoubted adultery with one Ampthill and with Henry Skipwith renders her motives suspicious. According to the historian Cynthia B. Herrup, Anne was the equal of Lord Castlehaven in immorality. Under the terms of the attainder, Castlehaven forfeited his English barony of Audley, created for heirs general, but retained his Irish earldom and barony since it was an entailed honour protected by the statute De Donis. When he was beheaded on Tower Hill on 14 May 1631, those Irish titles passed to his son James. Children Mervyn Touchet's first marriage (before 1608) was with Elizabeth Barnham (1592 ‚Äì c. 1622/4), daughter of London alderman Benedict Barnham and his wife, Dorothea Smith, and they had six surviving children: * James Tuchet, 3rd Earl of Castlehaven (1612‚Äì1684), who married Elizabeth Brydges (1614/5‚Äì1679), daughter of his stepmother, but left no surviving children * Lady Frances Touchet (born 1617) * Hon.

History Afan Lido F.C. were founded in 1967 shortly after the opening of the Afan Lido Sports Centre in Aberavon. A football team was set up to give the Centre's users a proper organisation. Ken Williams was the prime mover behind the club. Lido gained admission to the Port Talbot and District League for the 1967/68 season. In 1971‚Äì72 the club was accepted into the Welsh Football League, and two years later was promoted into the First Division (now the Second Division), and another two years later they were promoted again into the Premier Division (now the First Division). After a barren spell they were relegated but were promoted in 1984‚Äì85; by this time the League had been reorganised and a higher National Division had been formed, to which Afan Lido were promoted in 1989‚Äì90 after finishing 3rd (they had actually won the Premier Division the two previous seasons, but not been promoted because of the ground criteria set by the League). Afan Lido became founder members of the League of Wales in 1992, and won the League Cup in 1992‚Äì93 and 1993‚Äì94. The next year the porous defence was addressed, and the team finished in second place in the League, winning a UEFA Cup place, but they were defeated by RAF Yelgava of Latvia on the away-goals rule. This was a taste of things to come, and Afan Lido were relegated from the League of Wales before winning their place back after an absence of two years. Lido's young team that emerged during the spell out of the League of Wales grew together and the club enjoyed several encouraging seasons after settling again in the top flight. Lido's policy of choosing players from within the club's huge junior structure (which has 25 teams for all age groups, from under 5s upwards) paid off, when they finished 5th place in 2001‚Äì02. If the club had scored a single point more, in fact, Lido would have taken the town into European football for a second time. Leaner years followed that near miss, and in 2005 the club left the Welsh Premier in controversial circumstances, after being deducted points for fielding an ineligible player in a league game. The points deducted sunk the Lido into the relegation zone below NEWI Cefn Druids, which sealed their fate. In 2011 Lido secured a return to the Welsh Premier and their first season in the top flight saw the club survive the drop. The club also won the Welsh Premier League Cup, defeating Newtown on penalties at Aberystwyth. Off-field issues surfaced the following season, however, and Lido had to assemble an all-new squad under the guidance of Paul Reid. The club finished bottom of the Welsh Premier, but survived relegation due to the demise of Llanelli and the inability of Haverfordwest County to finish in a promotion spot in Welsh League Division One. On 4 July 2013 Afan Lido appointed former club captain and fans favourite Paul Evans to the hotseat as they look to cement their position within the top division. For the 2016‚Äì17 season, the club found themselves in the same division as town rivals Port Talbot. Current squad :As of 4 October 2018.

Castlehaven played a prominent role in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms that took place in the middle of the 17th century, and was particularly active in the conflicts in Ireland at this time.  Titles  He succeeded to the Irish earldom of Castlehaven and Baron Audley of Orier on 14 May 1631, when his father was attainted and beheaded. Most of his estates in England were taken over by others. He was created Baron Audley of Hely with remainder \\"to his heirs forever\\" on 3 June 1633, with place and precedency of George, his grandfather, formerly Baron Audley, in an effort to nullify his father's attainder. However, this was considered insufficient, legally, until a bill was passed by Parliament in 1678 allowing him to inherit the original Barony of Audley.  War in Ireland  Castlehaven was involved in the defence of Ireland during the Confederate Wars of the 1640s and in the subsequent Cromwellian invasion. During the outbreak of the Irish uprising in 1641‚Äì42, Castlehaven volunteered to help suppress the Irish rebels, but because he was a Catholic he was not trusted to take command. Shortly afterwards, he was arrested and detained at Dublin Castle. Fearing that he would meet the same fate of the Earl of Strafford, Tuchet manage to escape 27 September, with the help of a friend and fled south into the Wicklow Mountains. His intention was 'to gain a passage by Wexford into France, and from thence into England;‚Äô but coming to Kilkenny, the headquarters of the confederate Catholics, he was persuaded to accept a command in the army, and was appointed general of horse under Sir Thomas Preston, 1st Viscount Tara. It was believed among the northern Irish that his escape was a contrivance on the part of the Earl of Ormonde 'to work an understanding' between him and his kindred in rebellion, Castlehaven being related to him through the marriage of his sister with Edmund Roe Butler. Even though he considered himself English, he was appointed a member of the 25 strong Supreme council of the Confederation of Kilkenny. In 1644 the Irish Confederate Supreme Council decided to vote for Castlehaven as the commander of a 6,000 strong expedition force in a push against the Ulster Scottish army under Robert Monro. The campaign under Castlehaven proved indecisive, the large army being mostly used to defend the stronghold of Charlemont. Historians generally consider the expedition to have been a wasted opportunity: as a result of this, Owen Roe O'Neill considered Castlehaven to be incompetent and Thomas Preston also developed a dislike of him. (Castlehaven somewhat unconvincingly later blamed O'Neill for the failure of the expedition). However, Castlehaven was not entirely lacking in military ability. Apart from Owen Roe O'Neill, he proved to be the only Irish Confederate commander capable of winning conventional set-piece battles. In 1643 he surprised and routed hundreds of Inchiquin's men in county Cork at the battle of Cloughleagh. In 1650 he won a second small (though inconsequential) victory over an English Parliamentarian force during the battle of Tecroghan with some aid from Ulick Burke. The great weakness of Castlehaven was that he was largely an amateur, lacking the patience to conduct sieges and somewhat touchy- it is said that some referred to him as Tiarna Beag or 'Little Lord.'Padraig Lenihan, Con. Cath, pg 188  Later years  In 1647 he, like many other catholic noble, moved to France and was present at Prince Rupert's siege of Landr√©cy, the capital of Hainault. He went back to Ireland, after seeing the Prince of Wales in Paris, to hold several commands in Leinster, Munster, and Clare but was enable to counter the actions of Cromwell and his son-in-law, Ireton. He was able to return to the continent in April 1652 to further his military career serving Prince de Cond√© in the Fronde, Charles II, and the Spanish Crown. He participated in the battles of Rocroy, Cambrai, Seneffe, Maestricht, Charleroi and Mons Castlehaven wrote his memoirs in 1681James Touchet, 1820 \\"The Memoirs of James Lord Audley Earl of Castlehaven, his engagements and carriage in the wars of Ireland, from the year 1642 to the year 1651\\" in response to the hysteria of the Popish Plot. Like all Catholic peers he had been barred from the House of Lords (where he sat as Baron Audley) by the Test Act 1678,Kenyon, J.P. The Popish Plot 2nd Edition Phoenix Press 2000 p.311 much to the regret of the Protestant peers who held him in high regard. He took his leave on 30 November 1678, with a speech expressing his duty to the Crown, and his concern for the peace and welfare of the Kingdom.Kenyon, p.147 His fellow peers, knowing him to be in financial difficulty, wrote to Charles II recommending Castlehaven to his bounty.  Marriage and issue  He married twice, first Elizabeth Brydges (died March 1678/9) in Kilkenny, daughter of Grey Brydges, 5th Baron Chandos and of his wife Lady Anne Stanley (1580-1647), who married the 2nd Earl of Castlehaven after Lord Chandos' death. (Anne Stanley was thus both the 3rd Earl's stepmother, and his mother-in-law.). Elisabeth was buried at St Martin-in-the- Fields. He married secondly, about 19 June 1679, Elizabeth Graves (died 1720). He died without issue on 11 October 1684, at Kilcash Castle, County Tipperary, Ireland and was succeeded in the earldom by his youngest brother Mervyn. Mervyn's older brother George was passed over by virtue of being a Benedictine monk.

It was the culmination of the nearly half-century struggle between the Byzantine Emperor Basil II and the Bulgarian Emperor Samuel in the late 10th and early 11th centuries. The result was a decisive Byzantine victory. The battle took place in the valley between the mountains of Belasitsa and Ograzhden, near the modern Bulgarian village of Klyuch. The decisive encounter occurred on July 29 with an attack in the rear by a force under the Byzantine general Nikephoros Xiphias, who had infiltrated the Bulgarian positions. The ensuing battle was a major defeat for the Bulgarians. Bulgarian soldiers were captured and reputedly blinded by order of Basil II, who would subsequently be known as the \\"Bulgar-Slayer\\". Samuel survived the battle, but died two months later from a heart attack, reportedly brought on by the sight of his blind soldiers. Although the engagement did not end the First Bulgarian Empire, the Battle of Kleidion reduced its ability to resist Byzantine advances, and it has been considered the pivotal encounter of the war with Byzantium. Background The origins of the conflict date back to the 7th century, when the Bulgars under Khan Asparukh established a state along the Danube in one of the provinces of the Eastern Roman Empire. As a result, the Bulgarian state was forced to fight a series of wars with Byzantium in order to secure its continued existence.Mutafchiev, Book about the Bulgarians, p. 59 In 968, Bulgaria was invaded from the north by the Kievan Prince Sviatoslav.Gyuzelev, Short History of Bulgaria, p. 68 By that time, the Bulgarian Empire, which had once threatened the existence of Byzantium under the reign of Simeon, had lost much of its power.Bozhilov, Tsar Simeon the Great, pp. 115‚Äì116, 124‚Äì126, 137‚Äì144 During the conflict, the Kievan raids were repeatedly defeated by the Byzantines, who were also at war with the Bulgarians, a continuous conflict since the fall of the Bulgarian capital Preslav in 971. This war had resulted in the Bulgarian Emperor Boris II being forced to renounce his Imperial title in Constantinople, and eastern Bulgaria came under Byzantine rule.Pirivatrich, The State of Samuel, pp. 58‚Äì59 The Byzantines assumed that this act would signify the end of independent Bulgaria, but the western Bulgarian lands remained autonomous and under the Comitopuli brothers David, Moses, Aaron and Samuel, resistance against the Byzantines emerged.Ioannes Scylitzes, Historia, in \\"Selected sources\\" Vol. II, p. 64Pirivatrich, The State of Samuel, pp. 94‚Äì95 When the Byzantine emperor Basil II ascended the throne in 976, he made the destruction of independent Bulgaria his first ambition. Opposing him were the Western Bulgarians, now led by Samuel of Bulgaria. Basil II's first campaign was disastrous, the emperor barely escaping with his life when the Bulgarians annihilated the Byzantine army in the Gates of Trajan Pass in 986.Angelov / Cholpanov, Bulgarian Military History in the Middle Ages (10th‚Äì15th centuries), pp. 39‚Äì41, 43‚Äì44 Over the next fifteen years, while Basil was preoccupied with revolts against his rule and the Fatimid threat in the East, Samuel retook most of the previously conquered Bulgarian lands and carried the war into enemy territory in a series of campaigns. However, his invasion of southern Greece, that reached as far as Corinth, resulted in a major defeat in the Battle of Spercheios in 996. The next phase of the war began in 1000, when Basil, having secured his own position, launched a series of offensives against Bulgaria. He secured Moesia, and in 1003, his forces took Vidin. The next year, Basil inflicted a heavy defeat on Samuel in the Battle of Skopie. By 1005, Basil had regained control of Thessaly and parts of southern Macedonia. Over these and the next few years, a regular pattern emerged: the Byzantines would campaign in Bulgaria, laying siege to forts and pillaging the countryside, while the numerically inferior Bulgarians, unable to offer direct opposition, launched diversionary raids in Macedonia and Greece. Despite some successes, these did not achieve any permanent results, nor did they force Basil to abandon his campaigns in Bulgaria. A counter- attack in 1009 failed at the Battle of Kreta,Gyuzelev, Short History of Bulgaria, p. 71Nikolov, Centralism and regionalism in early Medieval Bulgaria (end of the 7th ‚Äì beginning of the 11th centuries) p. 130 and although the Byzantines themselves did not achieve any decisive success, their methodical war of attrition deprived the Bulgarians of their strongholds and gradually weakened their forces.Pirivatrich, The State of Samuel, pp. 135‚Äì136 In the words of Byzantine historian John Skylitzes: \\"The Emperor Basil II continued to invade Bulgaria each year and destroy and devastate everything on his way. Samuel could not stop him in the open field or engage the Emperor in a decisive battle, and suffered many defeats and began to lose his strength.\\"Ioannes Scylitzes, Historia, in \\"Selected sources\\" Vol. II, pp. 65‚Äì66 The culmination of the war came in 1014, when Samuel, at the head of his army, resolved to stop the Byzantine army before it could enter the Bulgarian heartland. Prelude Map of Bulgaria and Byzantium c.1000 Samuel knew that the Byzantine army would have to invade the country through a series of mountain passes, and so took precautions to bar them. The Bulgarians built ditches along the frontier and fortified many of the valleys and passes with walls and towers, especially the pass of Kleidion on the Struma River which Basil would need to pass through to reach the heart of Bulgaria. Samuel heavily fortified the northern slopes of the Belasitsa mountain to the south and east of Strumitsa Castle.Ioannes Scylitzes, Historia, II, p. 45 The wide valley of the Strumitsa River was a convenient place for attack and it had been used by Byzantine forces for this purpose in previous years. The Bulgarians disposed a strong guard to keep the pass safe. In addition, the Bulgarian ruler chose Strumitsa for his defensive base ‚Äî it was located on the road from Thessaloniki leading to Thrace to the east and Ohrid to the west.Zlatarski, History of Bulgaria in the Middle Ages , Vol. I, Part 2, pp. 731‚Äì732, 736 The rugged terrain to the south was dotted with earthworks and walls guarded by strong Bulgarian units.Nikolov, Centralism and Regionalism in Early Medieval Bulgaria , pp. 179‚Äì180A description of the palisade built by Samuel between Belasitsa and Ograzhden (in Bulgarian) ‚Äì G. Mitrev, The palisade of Samuel and the battle in 1014, pp. 76‚Äì79, in: Macedonian Review (journal), in Bulgarian, 1993, issue 2 Samuel's decision to face Basil II and the bulk of his army at Kleidion was not only prompted by the constant defeats and invasions which had devastated the country, but also by concerns over his authority among the nobility, which had been fatally weakened by Basil's campaigns. In 1005 for example, the governor of the important Adriatic port of Dyrrhachium had surrendered the town to Basil II.Ostrogorski, History of Byzantium , pp. 404‚Äì405 To face this threat, Samuel gathered a large army to face the Byzantines, some claiming it numbered as many as 45,000 soldiers.Nikolov, Centralism and Regionalism in Early Medieval Bulgaria , p. 131. G. Nikolov estimates the total number of the Bulgarian army including the squads of local militia at maximum 45,000. The Byzantine historian Georgius Monachus Continuatus wrote that the Bulgarian army had 360,000 men, a greatly exaggerated number, the actual being 10 times smaller Basil II also prepared carefully, assembling a large army of his own and taking his most experienced commanders, including the governor of Philippopolis (modern Plovdiv), Nicephorus Xiphias, who had conquered the old Bulgarian capitals Pliska and Preslav from Samuel in 1001. Battle Manasses Chronicle The Byzantine army marched from Constantinople through Komotini, Drama and Serres and reached the Rupel pass on the Struma river. From there the army entered the Strumitsa valley and reached the vicinity of the village of Klyuch, where the river bent and approached Belasitsa and Ozgrazhden. There the army was stopped by a thick wooden wall, defended by Bulgarian soldiers.Zlatarski, History of Bulgaria in the Middle Ages, Vol. I, Part 2, p. 731Nikolov, Centralism and Regionalism in Early Medieval Bulgaria, p. 180 The Byzantines attacked the palisade immediately, but were repulsed with heavy casualties.Ioannes Scylitzes, Historia, II, p. 457Zonaras, ibid., IV, p. 121 In response, Samuel sent a large army under one of the most able Bulgarian nobles, Nestoritsa, to strike southwards and draw the attention of Basil away from the siege at Klyuch.Nikolov, Centralism and Regionalism in Early Medieval Bulgaria, p. 146 Nestoritsa's Bulgarians reached Thessalonika, but Byzantine troops under Theophylact Botaneiates, the strategos (Governor-General) of the city and his son Mihail managed to defeat them outside the city walls in a bloody battle. Theophylactus captured many soldiers and a large quantity of military equipment and marched north to join Basil II at Klyuch.Ioannes Scylitzes, Historia, \\"Selected sources\\", Vol. II, p. 66Zlatarski, History of Bulgaria in the Middle Ages, Vol. I, Part 2, pp. 732‚Äì734 Basil II's first attempt to overwhelm the defenders of the pass was unsuccessful and his army was unable to pass through the valley, which was defended by 15,000‚Äì20,000 Bulgarians.Ioannes Scylitzes, Historia, p. 457 Despite the difficulties the Byzantine Emperor did not abandon the attack. He ordered his general Nicephorus Xiphias to manoeuvre his troops around the high Belasitsa mountain and threaten the Bulgarians from behind, while he continued the assaults on the wall.Cedrin, pp. 457‚Äì458. George Kedrenos's Historical Synopsis is a compilation chronicle based on the writings of John Skylitzes, George Syncellus, Theophanes the Confessor and several other historians. It is not clear what edition is referred to here. Xiphias led his troops along a steep path that led him into the Bulgarians' rear. On July 29, Xiphias attacked the Bulgarian defenders, trapping them in the valley. The Bulgarians abandoned their towers to face this new threat and Basil was able to break through the front line and destroy the wall.Ioannes Scylitzes, Historia, \\"Selected sources\\", Vol. II, p. 66Zlatarski, History of Bulgaria in the Middle Ages, Vol. I, Part 2, pp. 734‚Äì736 In the confusion of the rout, thousands of Bulgarian troops were killed and the remainder desperately attempted to flee westwards. Samuel and his son Gabriel Radomir immediately headed to the east from their headquarters in the Strumitsa fortress to aid their army, but in desperate fighting near the village of Mokrievo (present-day North Macedonia) they were overwhelmed by the quickly advancing enemy.Angelov / Cholpanov, Bulgarian Military History in the Middle Ages (10th‚Äì15th centuries), p. 55 Many Bulgarian soldiers were killed at Mokrievo and many more were captured.Greek sources on the History of Bulgaria (in Bulgarian), Vol. VI, —Å. 284 (retrieved on 29.01.2008) Emperor Samuel himself barely escaped, only breaking free through the bravery of his son, who mounted his father on his own horse and took him to safety in Prilep.Ioannes Scylitzes, Historia, p. 458 From Prilep, Samuel returned to Prespa while Gabriel Radomir headed towards Strumitsa to continue the struggle.Zonaras, ibid., p. 121 Further developments Battle of Kleidion After his victory, Basil II advanced towards Strumitsa, which was key to holding the whole Vardar valley. On their way to the city, the Byzantines seized the Matsukion fortress to the east of their advance.Ioannes Scylitzes, Historia, p. 459 The Byzantine Emperor also sent an army under Botaneiates to surround Strumitsa and destroy all ramparts to the south and clear the passage to Thessalonica. With the remainder of his troops, Basil laid siege to the city itself. The Bulgarians allowed Botaneiates to destroy the fortifications, but he and his army were ambushed by Bulgarian raiders in a narrow valley, soon after their task was complete. In the ensuing battle Botaneiates was completely defeated and the Bulgarian commander Gabriel Radomir personally stabbed Botaneiates with his spear.Zlatarski, History of Bulgaria in the Middle Ages, Vol. I, Part 2, p. 738Angelov / Cholpanov, Bulgarian Military History in the Middle Ages (10th‚Äì15th centuries), pp. 55‚Äì56 As a result, Basil II was forced to abandon the siege of Strumitsa and retreat. On the return, the eloquence of the cubicularius Sergius convinced the defenders of Melnik to surrender,Ioannes Scylitzes, Historia, —Ä. 460 another heavy blow for the Bulgarians as the town guarded the main road to Sofia from the south. =Prisoners= Skylitzes records that Basil completely routed the Bulgarian army and took 15,000 prisoners (14,000 according to Kekaumenos). Modern historians however, such as Vasil Zlatarski, claim that these numbers are exaggerated. The 14th century Bulgarian translation of the Manasses Chronicle numbers the prisoners at 8,000. Basil divided the prisoners into groups of 100 men, blinded 99 men in each group and left one man in each with one eye so that he could lead the others home;Ioannes Scylitzes, Historia, —Ä. 458 this was done in retaliation for the death of Botaneiates, who was Basil's favourite general and advisor, and also to crush the Bulgarian morale.Gyuzelev, Short History of Bulgaria, p. 74 Another possible reason was that, in Byzantine eyes, the Bulgarians were rebels against their authority, and blinding was the usual punishment meted out to rebels.Pirivatrich, The State of Samuel, p. 178. –°S. Pirivatic indicates that blinding was the traditional punishment in Byzantium for a rebellion against the legitimate ruler. For this action, Basil gained the nickname Boulgaroktonos (, ), \\"the Bulgar-slayer\\". Samuel died of a heart attack on October 6, 1014, reportedly due to seeing his soldiers blinded. (retrieved on 7 September 2008) Aftermath South-eastern Europe c.1000. The Byzantine possessions and independent western Bulgaria are depicted. By that time, eastern Bulgaria was also in Bulgarian hands. The death of Botaneiates and the four more years of war that followed indicate that the Byzantine success was not complete.Holmes, Catherine, Basil II (A.D. 976‚Äì1025) Some modern historians doubt that the Bulgarian defeat was as complete as described by Skylitzes and Kekaumenos.Stephenson, P., The Legend of Basil the Bulgar-Slayer, Cambridge University Press, 2003, , p. 4 Other historians emphasize that the death of Emperor Samuel two months later was much more fateful for Bulgaria.Zlatarski, History of Bulgaria in the Middle Ages, Vol. I, Part 2, pp. 740‚Äì741 His heirs Gabriel Radomir and Ivan Vladislav were unable to effectively resist the attacks of Basil II, and Bulgaria was completely defeated in 1018.Whittow, Making of Orthodox Byzantium, pp. 387‚Äì388 In that year Emperor Ivan Vladislav was killed in a battle at Dyrrhachium,Runciman, A History of the First Bulgarian Empire, p. 248 (retrieved on 7.9.2008) and Bulgaria became a province of the Byzantine Empire until the successful uprising led by the Asen brothers in 1185. Other theses in the historiography stress the significance of the battle. As a result of the battle of Belasitsa, the Bulgarian army suffered heavy casualties that could not be restored. The ability of the central government to control the peripheral and interior provinces of the Empire was reduced and the actions of the local and provincial governors became more decisive for the outcome of the war with Byzantium. Many of them voluntarily surrendered to Basil II.Nikolov, Centralism and Regionalism in Early Medieval Bulgaria, pp. 130‚Äì131, 143 The battle also affected the Serbs and the Croats, who were forced to acknowledge the supremacy of the Byzantine Emperor after 1018.Stephenson, P., The Balkan Frontier in the Year 1000, pp. 123‚Äì124 (–≤: Magdalino, P., Byzantium in the Year 1000, Brill 2003, ); Ostrogorsky, History of Byzantium, p. 408; Mutafchiev, Lecture notes on Byzantine history, Vol. –Ü–Ü, p. 280; ƒÜirkoviƒá, Sima, Doseljavanje slovena i dukljanska dr≈æavaCroatia was not conquered by Byzantium but became its vassal ‚Äî see Matanov, Hristo, The Medieval Balkans.

His ship, Revenge, met 53 Spanish warships near Flores in the Azores. He and his crew fought the fifty three in a three-day running battle. Many Spanish ships were sunk or so badly damaged that they had to retire from the battle. Revenge was boarded three times and each time the boarders were seen off. Grenville was lord of the manors of Stowe, Kilkhampton in Cornwall and of Bideford in Devon. He was also a soldier, an armed merchant fleet owner, privateer, colonizer, and explorer. He took part in the early English attempts to settle the New World, and also participated in the fight against the Spanish Armada. His non- military offices included Member of Parliament for Cornwall, High Sheriff of County Cork in 1569‚Äì70 and Sheriff of Cornwall in 1576‚Äì77. He was the grandfather of Sir Bevil Grenville (1596‚Äì1643) of English Civil War fame, whose son was John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath (1628‚Äì1701). Origins Richard Grenville was the eldest son and heir of Sir Roger Grenville (d. 1545), who was captain of when it sank in Portsmouth Harbour in 1545, by his wife Thomasine Cole, daughter of Thomas Cole of Slade.Vivian, Heralds' Visitations of Cornwall Thomasine remarried to Thomas Arundell. The ancient Grenville family were lords of the manors of Bideford in Devon and of Stowe, Kilkhampton in Cornwall. He was a cousin of Sir Walter Raleigh and the privateer and explorer Humphrey Gilbert. Grenville's birthplace is believed to have been at Bideford. His father (who had pre-deceased his own father Sir Richard Grenville (c. 1495‚Äì1550), the Member of Parliament (MP) for Cornwall in 1529) died when he was an infant, aged 3, and his mother remarried to Thomas Arundell of Clifton Arundell House, where Grenville spent much of his childhood. At age 17, Grenville began law studies at the Inner Temple. Early career As a minor, Grenville was elected to Parliament for Dunheved, Launceston, as Knight of the Shire for 1562‚Äì63. On 19 November 1562, aged 20, he was in an affray in the Strand in the company of his cousin, Nicholes Specott, gentleman, with Lewis Lloyd and Edward Horseman, their attendants. Upon encountering Sir Edmound Unton, Fulke Greville, Robert Bannister, gentleman, and Thomas Allen, yeoman, (with their servants), Grenville ran Robert Bannister through with his sword, then left him to die. Grenville and company were outlawed for three months and then pardoned for public duelling and manslaughter, just in time to resume his seat in Parliament. At age 21, he inherited his grandfather's estates at Stowe in Cornwall, and Bideford and Buckland Abbey in Devon, England. In 1565 Grenville married Mary St Leger (c. 1543‚Äì1623), daughter of Sir John St Ledger and heir to her brother. He was appointed High Sheriff of Cork c. 1568\\\\. Military career =Hungarian campaign= In pursuit of his military career, with his West Country cousins, Godolphins, Carews, Killigrews, Champernownes, Basets, etc., Grenville fought against the Turks in Hungary for the Holy Roman Emperor, Maximilian in 1566. After petitioning Elizabeth I in 1565 to leave England for service abroad to a foreign prince, Grenville and his West Country cousins paid for and recruited a troop of West Countrymen to accompany them. =Activity in Ireland= In 1569, he arrived in Ireland with Sir Warham St. Leger (c. 1525‚Äì1597) to arrange for the settlement of lands in the Barony of Kerricurrihy. These had been mortgaged to St Leger by Gerald Fitzgerald, 15th Earl of Desmond. At about this time Grenville also seized lands for colonisation at Tracton, to the west of Cork harbour. Sir Peter Carew had asserted his claim to lands in south Leinster. St Leger settled nearby, and Humphrey Gilbert pushed westward from Idrone along the Blackwater River. All of these English efforts to take over land in the south of Ireland led to bitter disputes. They escalated into the first of the Desmond rebellions, led by James Fitzmaurice Fitzgerald. As Sheriff of Cork, Grenville witnessed the rebellion in which Fitzmaurice, along with the Earl of Clancar, James Fitzedmund Fitzgerald (the Seneschal of Imokilly); Edmund Fitzgibbon (the White Knight); and others, attacked Tracton. They overcame the English defence with pickaxes and killed nearly the entire garrison. The three surviving English soldiers were hanged the next day by the Irish. Fitzmaurice threatened the imminent arrival of Spanish forces. Having robbed the citizens of Cork, he boasted that he could also take the artillery of the city of Youghal. In June 1569, soon after Grenville's sailing for England, Fitzmaurice camped outside the walls of Waterford and demanded that Grenville's wife and Lady St Leger be given over to him, along with all the English and all prisoners; the citizens refused. His forces put local English farmers to the sword. As Cork ran low on provisions, the people of Youghal expected an attack at any minute. The rebellion continued, but Grenville remained in England. Return to England Grenville sided with the Earl of Arundel and the Duke of Norfolk in 1569 against the Queen's secretary. He was elected MP for Cornwall in 1571 and appointed High Sheriff of Cornwall for 1576. \\"Undeviatingly Protestant\\", he arrested the Catholic priest Cuthbert Mayne at the home of the Tregians in 1577. Mayne was martyred as a result. =Buckland Greynvile Abbey= In 1575‚Äì76, Sir Richard was back home at Bideford expanding his holdings, businesses and properties after his expedition plans were scuppered. He finished remodeling the rest of the interior of Buckland Greynvile Abbey into a suitable home for his growing family. He decorated it with navigational themes in the plaster on the ceilings, the Greynvile coat of arms on the mantle pieces, as well as a knight in repose against a tree. =Development of Bideford= 1575, Grenville played a major role in the transformation of the small fishing port of Bideford in north Devon into what became a significant trading port with the new American colonies, later specialising in tobacco importation. A charter had been granted to his ancestor Richard Grenville in 1272, creating the town's first council. In 1575 he created the port of Bideford. Grenville was never elected as Mayor of Bideford, preferring instead to support John Salterne in that role, but he was Lord of the Manor, a title held by the Grenvilles since 1126 and finally ceded by his descendants in 1711 to the town council he established. He was again elected as MP for Cornwall in 1584 (sitting until 1586). Development of Irish estate Following a period of supporting Sir Walter Raleigh's venture in America (see below) he returned to Munster to arrange the estate granted him under the plantation of the province. Following the suppression of the Second Desmond Rebellion in 1583, he had purchased some in Kinalmeaky and brought settlers over. His renewed efforts beginning in 1588 yielded little success, and Grenville returned to England late in 1590. Privateering plan and sailing around the world In 1574 Grenville submitted a proposal to the Privy Council to take a single ship to plunder Spanish treasure ships and plant colonies in South America and from there to sail across the \\"South Sea\\" (i.e. Pacific Ocean) in hope of finding a short cut to the Spice Islands and terra australis incognita. > Supplication for a new navigation, permission to seek rich and unknown > lands, to discover and annex all or any lands, islands, and countries beyond > the Equinoxial, or where the Pole Antarctic hath any elevation above the > horizon, such lands not being already possessed by any other Christian > Prince. The planting of people and habitations in strange and unknown lands. > Need not offend foreign powers or provoke war, provided no attempts were > made to take from other civilised nations anything they already possess. > Such expeditions should be composed of voluntary adventurers; but under > patronage and benediction of the Crown; the leaders having authority from > the Queen to require that obedience, quiet, unity, and order be maintained. > Gilbert an m'self having pointed out to her Majesty that such undertakings > would provide work and livelihood for many of her subjects; and also bring > honour and strength to Your Majesty with immortal fame, ‚Ä¶ besides great > enrichment of Your Highness and your country, with increase and maintenance > of the Navy. The patent was initially granted, but was rescinded a year later on the grounds that England was still using diplomacy with Spain and had been at great pains to rebuild her relations with Philip II after the tensions of 1568‚Äì1571. It was these plans that were usurped and were eventually executed by Francis Drake when he circumnavigated the globe in 1577. This caused some bad blood and is the reason why Grenville refused to ever serve with Francis Drake in any capacity. That same year Grenville received thanks of the Privy Council and the Earl of Bedford, then Lieutenant of Cornwall, in Ireland for raising troops against Sir Thomas Stukely, styling himself the Duke of Ireland. New World and Roanoke Colony In 1585, Grenville was admiral of the seven-strong fleet that brought English settlers to establish a military colony on Roanoke Island, off the coast of modern North Carolina in North America. Grenville and his companions arrived at the village of Aquascogoc, inhabited by the native Carolina Algonquians, but, before leaving, Grenville furiously reacted to the disappearance of a silver English drinking cup.Miller, Lee, Roanoke: Solving the Mystery of the Lost Colony Retrieved April 2011 His men proceeded to sack and burn the entire village of Aquascogoc.Aquascogoc at www.h-net.org Retrieved April 2011 Grenville was heavily criticised by Ralph Lane, general of the expedition, who referred to Grenville's \\"intolerable pride and insatiable ambition\\". Lane's remark was prompted by a bitter legal feud he then had with Grenville. On his return, Grenville captured a Spanish ship, Santa Maria de Vincente, which he later brought to Bideford to be converted into Galleon Dudley. The cannon from that Spanish ship are thought to be those erroneously labelled \\"Armada cannons\\" in Bideford's Victoria Park. In 1586 Grenville returned to Roanoke to find that the surviving colonists had departed with Drake. Grenville left 15 of his own men to defend Raleigh's New World territory. During his return voyage to England, Grenville raided various towns in the Azores Islands. At about this time, a description was given of his behaviour while dining with Spanish captains: Grenville brought with him a Native American from Roanoke Island to Bideford after returning from a voyage to America that same year. He named the Native American tribesman Raleigh after his cousin Sir Walter Raleigh. Raleigh converted to Christianity and had his baptism at Saint Mary the Virgin's Church Bideford on 27 March 1588, but died from influenza while residing in Grenville's house on 2 April 1589. His interment was at the same church five days later along with Grenville's daughter, Rebecca. Spanish Armada In 1587, Grenville was appointed Deputy Lieutenant of the West Country by the Privy Council, to organize the defences of Devon and Cornwall in preparation for the expected attack by the Spanish Armada the following year. Also was commissioned with overseeing the repair of the Fortifications of the Cinque Ports and Boscastle Harbour. In 1588, was made a member of the council that was created to devise means of defence against the Spanish armada. Grenville equipped seven ships at Bideford with supplies and more colonists for Raleigh's \\"Planters\\" Colony settled at Roanoke the previous year. However, a stay of shipping due to the impending arrival of the Spanish Armada meant that the fleet did not sail. Grenville led five of these ships to Plymouth to join the English defences and returned to Bideford where he provisioned the remaining two ships for Roanoke, a voyage that later turned back after being raided by the French. Later that year, Grenville was commissioned to keep watch at sea on the western approaches to the Bristol Channel in case of the return of the Spanish Armada. Command of Revenge and death Grenville's defence of Revenge at the Battle of Flores Grenville was appointed Vice- Admiral of the Fleet under Thomas Howard. He was charged with maintaining a squadron at the Azores to waylay the return to Spain of the South American treasure fleets. He took command of , a galleon considered to be a masterpiece of naval construction. At Flores Island the English fleet was surprised by a much larger squadron sent by King Philip II of Spain. Howard retreated to safety, but Grenville faced the 53 enemy ships alone, leading his single ship in what amounted to a suicide mission, stating that he \\"utterly refused to turn from the enimie...he would rather chose to die than to dishonour himselfe\\".Milton, p.271 His crew was reduced by nearly 100 men due to sickness on shore, but he chose nonetheless to confront the far superior Spanish force. For twelve hours he and his crew fought-off the Spanish, causing heavy damage to fifteen galleons. According to Raleigh's account, Grenville and his soldiers fought for hour after hour, \\"‚Ä¶until all the powder of The Revenge, to the last barrell, was now spent, all her pikes broken, fortie of her best men slain, and the most part of the rest hurt\\". The ship itself was \\"marvellous unsaverie, filled with bloud and bodies of deade and wounded men like a slaughter house\\". The fight was later romanticized by the poet Alfred Lord Tennyson in his work The Revenge: A Ballad of the Fleet: \\"Out-gunned, out- fought, and out-numbered fifty-three to one\\",The Revenge: A Ballad of the Fleet by Alfred, Lord Tennyson Grenville was said to have wished to blow up his ship rather than give up the fight, as Tennyson wrote: \\"Sink me the ship, Master Gunner! ‚Äî sink her! split her in twain! ... Fall into the hands of God, not into the hands of Spain!\\" Grenville's crew however refused to obey these suicidal orders and his officers surrendered what was left of their vessel to the Spanish, on a promise of fair treatment. Grenville died of his wounds several days later, screaming that his men were \\"traitors and dogs\\",Milton, p.272 but the Spanish were not to enjoy their success, nor would Grenville's men survive their deliverance. The Spanish fleet was caught by a cyclone soon after and during a week-long storm Revenge and fifteen Spanish warships and merchant vessels were lost.Paine p. 150 Revenge sank with her mixed prize-crew of seventy Spaniards and English prisoners near the island of Terceira, at the approximate position .Earle p. 159 Marriage and progeny Arms of Richard Grenville (1542‚Äì1591) (Gules, three clarions or) impaling St Ledger (Azure fretty argent, a chief or), arms of his wife Mary St Ledger. Kilkhampton Church In 1565 Grenville married Mary St Leger (c. 1543‚Äì1623), daughter of Sir John St Ledger of Annery, Monkleigh, near Bideford, and heir to her brother. She outlived her husband and died aged about 80 on 9 November 1623 and was buried at St Mary's Church, Bideford. The family initially lived at Buckland Abbey before moving to a newly built house at Bideford. They had four sons, including Bernard Grenville.

Its origins can be traced back to the 10th century to several European folk tales, including one from Italy called The False Grandmother. The best known version was written by Charles Perrault. The story has been changed considerably in various retellings and subjected to numerous modern adaptations and readings. Other names for the story are: \\"Little Red Ridinghood\\", \\"Little Red Cap\\" or simply \\"Red Riding Hood\\". It is number 333 in the Aarne‚ÄìThompson classification system for folktales. Tale Little Red Riding Hood, illustrated in a 1927 story anthology The story revolves around a girl called Little Red Riding Hood. In Perrault's versions of the tale, she is named after her red hooded cape/cloak that she wears. The girl walks through the woods to deliver food to her sickly grandmother (wine and cake depending on the translation). In Grimms' version, her mother had ordered her to stay strictly on the path. A Big Bad Wolf wants to eat the girl and the food in the basket. He secretly stalks her behind trees, bushes, shrubs, and patches of little and tall grass. He approaches Little Red Riding Hood, who naively tells him where she is going. He suggests that the girl pick some flowers as a present for her grandmother, which she does. In the meantime, he goes to the grandmother's house and gains entry by pretending to be her. He swallows the grandmother whole (in some stories, he locks her in the closet) and waits for the girl, disguised as the grandma. Gustave Dor√©'s engraving of the scene: \\"She was astonished to see how her grandmother looked.\\" When the girl arrives, she notices that her grandmother looks very strange. Little Red then says, \\"What a deep voice you have!\\" (\\"The better to greet you with\\", responds the wolf), \\"Goodness, what big eyes you have!\\" (\\"The better to see you with\\", responds the wolf), \\"And what big hands you have!\\" (\\"The better to embrace you with\\", responds the wolf), and lastly, \\"What a big mouth you have\\" (\\"The better to eat you with!\\", responds the wolf), at which point the wolf jumps out of the bed and eats her, too. Then he falls asleep. In Charles Perrault's version of the story (the first version to be published), the tale ends here. However, in later versions, the story continues generally as follows: A woodcutter in the French version, but a hunter in the Brothers Grimm and traditional German versions, comes to the rescue with an axe, and cuts open the sleeping wolf. Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother emerge shaken, but unharmed. Then they fill the wolf's body with heavy stones. The wolf awakens and attempts to flee, but the stones cause him to collapse and die. In Grimm's version, the wolf leaves the house and tries to drink out of a well, but the stones in his stomach cause him to fall in and drown. Sanitized versions of the story have the grandmother locked in the closet instead of being eaten and some have Little Red Riding Hood saved by the lumberjack as the wolf advances on her rather than after she gets eaten, where the woodcutter kills the wolf with his axe. \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" illustration by Arthur Rackham. The tale makes the clearest contrast between the safe world of the village and the dangers of the forest, conventional antitheses that are essentially medieval, though no written versions are as old as that. It also warns about the dangers of not obeying one's mother (at least in Grimms' version). History =Relationship to other tales= The story displays many similarities to stories from classical Greece and Rome. Scholar Graham Anderson has compared the story to a local legend recounted by Pausanias in which, each year, a virgin girl was offered to a malevolent spirit dressed in the skin of a wolf, who raped the girl. Then, one year, the boxer Euthymos came along, slew the spirit, and married the girl who had been offered as a sacrifice. There are also a number of different stories recounted by Greek authors involving a woman named Pyrrha (literally \\"fire\\") and a man with some name meaning \\"wolf\\". The Roman poet Horace alludes to a tale in which a male child is rescued alive from the belly of Lamia, an ogress in classical mythology. The dialogue between the Big Bad Wolf and Little Red Riding Hood has its analogies to the Norse √ûrymskvi√∞a from the Elder Edda; the giant √ûrymr had stolen Mj√∂lnir, Thor's hammer, and demanded Freyja as his bride for its return. Instead, the gods dressed Thor as a bride and sent him. When the giants note Thor's unladylike eyes, eating, and drinking, Loki explains them as Freyja's not having slept, eaten, or drunk, out of longing for the wedding. A parallel to another Norse myth, the chase and eventual murder of the sun goddess by the wolf Sk√∂ll, has also been drawn.Dundes, Alan & McGlathery, James M. (ed.). \\"Interpreting Little Red Riding Hood Psychoanalytically\\". The Brothers Grimm and Folktale. pp. 26‚Äì7. . A very similar story also belongs to the North African tradition, namely in Kabylia, where a number of versions are attested.The oldest source is the tale Rova in: Leo Frobenius, Volksm√§rchen und Volksdichtungen Afrikas / Band III, Jena 1921: 126-129, fairy tale # 33. The theme of the little girl who visits her (grand)dad in his cabin and is recognized by the sound of her bracelets constitutes the refrain of a well- known song by the modern singer Idir, A Vava Inouva: {  : :‚ÄòI beseech you, open the door for me, father. :Jingle your bracelets, oh my daughter Ghriba. :I'm afraid of the monster in the forest, father. :I, too, am afraid, oh my daughter Ghriba.‚ÄôQuoted from: Jane E. Goodman, Berber Culture on the World Stage: From Village to Video, Indiana University Press, 2005: 62. } The theme of the ravening wolf and of the creature released unharmed from its belly is also reflected in the Russian tale Peter and the Wolf and another Grimm tale The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids, but its general theme of restoration is at least as old as the biblical story, Jonah and the Whale. The theme also appears in the story of the life of Saint Margaret, wherein the saint emerges unharmed from the belly of a dragon, and in the epic \\"The Red Path\\" by Jim C. Hines. A Taiwanese story from the 16th century, known as Grandaunt Tiger bears several striking similarities. When the girl's mother goes out, the tigress comes to the girl's house and pretends to be their aunt, asking to come in. The girl says that her voice does not sound right, so the tigress attempts to disguise her voice. Then, the girl says that her hands feel too coarse, so the tigress attempts to make them smoother. When finally, the tigress gains entry, she eats the girl's sister's hand. The girl comes up with a ruse to go outside and fetch some food for her aunt. Grandaunt Tiger, suspicious of the girl, ties a rope to her leg. The girl ties a bucket to the rope to fool her, but Grandaunt Tiger realises this and chases after her, whereupon she climbs into a tree. The girl tells the tigress that she will let her eat her, but first she would like to feed her some fruit from the tree. The tigress comes closer to eat the food, whereupon, the girl pours boiling hot oil down her throat, killing her. =Earliest versions= \\"The better to see you with\\": woodcut by Walter Crane The origins of the Little Red Riding Hood story can be traced to several likely pre-17th century versions from various European countries. Some of these are significantly different from the currently known, Grimms-inspired version. It was told by French peasants in the 10th century and recorded by the cathedral schoolmaster Egbert of Li√®ge.J.M. Ziolkowski, \\"A fairy tale from before fairy tales: Egbert of Liege's ‚ÄòDe puella a lupellis seruata‚Äô and the medieval background of ‚ÄòLittle Red Riding Hood‚Äô\\", Speculum 67 (1992): 549‚Äì575. In Italy, Little Red Riding Hood was told by peasants in the fourteenth century, where a number of versions exist, including La finta nonna (The False Grandmother), written among others by Italo Calvino in the Italian Folktales collection.Jack Zipes, In Hungarian folklore, the story is known as \\"Piroska\\" (Little Red), and is still told in mostly the original version described above. The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm, p 744, It has also been called \\"The Story of Grandmother\\". It is also possible that this early tale has roots in very similar East Asian tales (e.g. \\"Grandaunt Tiger\\").Alan Dundes, little ducking These early variations of the tale, do differ from the currently known version in several ways. The antagonist is not always a wolf, but sometimes a 'bzou' (werewolf), making these tales relevant to the werewolf trials (similar to witch trials) of the time (e.g. the trial of Peter Stumpp).Catherine Orenstein, Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked: Sex, Morality and the Evolution of a Fairy Tale, pp 92-106, The wolf usually leaves the grandmother's blood and flesh for the girl to eat, who then unwittingly cannibalizes her own grandmother. Furthermore, the wolf was also known to ask her to remove her clothing and toss it into the fire. In some versions, the wolf eats the girl after she gets into bed with him, and the story ends there. In others, she sees through his disguise and tries to escape, complaining to her \\"grandmother\\" that she needs to defecate and would not wish to do so in the bed. The wolf reluctantly lets her go, tied to a piece of string so she does not get away. However, the girl slips the string over something else and runs off. In these stories she escapes with no help from any male or older female figure, instead using her own cunning, or in some versions the help of a younger boy who she happens to run into.Beckett, S. L. (2008). Little Red Riding Hood. In D. Haase, The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairytales: G-P (pp. 522-534). Greenwood Publishing Group. Sometimes, though more rarely, the red hood is even non-existent. In other tellings of the story, the wolf chases after Little Red Riding Hood. She escapes with the help of some laundresses, who spread a sheet taut over a river so she may escape. When the wolf follows Red over the bridge of cloth, the sheet is released and the wolf drowns in the river.Beckett, S. L. (2008). Little Red Riding Hood. In D. Haase, The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folktales and Fairytales: G-P (pp. 583-588). Greenwood Publishing Group. And in another version the wolf is pushed into the fire, while he is preparing the flesh of the grandmother to be eaten by the girl. =Charles Perrault= The earliest known printed versionIona and Peter Opie, The Classic Fairy Tales. p. 93. was known as Le Petit Chaperon Rouge and may have had its origins in 17th-century French folklore. It was included in the collection Tales and Stories of the Past with Morals. Tales of Mother Goose (Histoires et contes du temps pass√©, avec des moralit√©s. Contes de ma m√®re l'Oye), in 1697, by Charles Perrault. As the title implies, this versionCharles Perrault, \\"Le Petit Chaperon Rouge\\" is both more sinister and more overtly moralized than the later ones. The redness of the hood, which has been given symbolic significance in many interpretations of the tale, was a detail introduced by Perrault.Maria Tatar, p 17, The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales, chaperon being worn The story had as its subject an \\"attractive, well-bred young lady\\", a village girl of the country being deceived into giving a wolf she encountered the information he needed to find her grandmother's house successfully and eat the old woman while at the same time avoiding being noticed by woodcutters working in the nearby forest. Then he proceeded to lay a trap for Red Riding Hood. Little Red Riding Hood ends up being asked to climb into the bed before being eaten by the wolf, where the story ends. The wolf emerges the victor of the encounter and there is no happy ending. Charles Perrault explained the 'moral' at the end of the tale so that no doubt is left to his intended meaning: This, the presumed original version of the tale was written for the late seventeenth-century French court of King Louis XIV. This audience, whom the King entertained with extravagant parties, presumably would take from the story the intended meaning. =The Brothers Grimm= Wilhelm (left) and Jacob Grimm, from an 1855 painting by Elisabeth Jerichau-Baumann In the 19th century two separate German versions were retold to Jacob Grimm and his younger brother Wilhelm Grimm, known as the Brothers Grimm, the first by Jeanette Hassenpflug (1791‚Äì1860) and the second by Marie Hassenpflug (1788‚Äì1856). The brothers turned the first version to the main body of the story and the second into a sequel of it. The story as Rotk√§ppchen was included in the first edition of their collection Kinder- und Hausm√§rchen (Children's and Household Tales (1812)).Jacob and Wilheim Grimm, \\"Little Red Cap\\" The earlier parts of the tale agree so closely with Perrault's variant that it is almost certainly the source of the tale.Harry Velten, \\"The Influences of Charles Perrault's Contes de ma M√®re L'oie on German Folklore\\", p 966, Jack Zipes, ed. The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm, However, they modified the ending; this version had the little girl and her grandmother saved by a huntsman who was after the wolf's skin; this ending is identical to that in the tale \\"The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids\\", which appears to be the source.Harry Velten, \\"The Influences of Charles Perrault's Contes de ma M√®re L'oie on German Folklore\\", p 967, Jack Zipes, ed. The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm, The second part featured the girl and her grandmother trapping and killing another wolf, this time anticipating his moves based on their experience with the previous one. The girl did not leave the path when the wolf spoke to her, her grandmother locked the door to keep it out, and when the wolf lurked, the grandmother had Little Red Riding Hood put a trough under the chimney and fill it with water that sausages had been cooked in; the smell lured the wolf down, and it drowned.Maria Tatar, The Annotated Brothers Grimm, p 149 W. W. Norton & company, London, New York, 2004 The Brothers further revised the story in later editions and it reached the above-mentioned final and better-known version in the 1857 edition of their work.Jacob and Wilheim Grimm, \\"Little Red Cap\\" It is notably tamer than the older stories which contained darker themes. =Later versions= An engraving from the Cyclopedia of Wit and Humor. Numerous authors have rewritten or adapted this tale. Andrew Lang included a variant called \\"The True History of Little Goldenhood\\"Andrew Lang, \\"The True History of Little Goldenhood\\", The Red Fairy Book (1890) in The Red Fairy Book (1890). He derived it from the works of Charles Marelles,The proper name of this French author is Charles Marelle (1827-19..), there is a typo in Andrew Lang's Red Fairy Book. See BNF note online. in Contes of Charles Marelles. This version explicitly states that the story had been mistold earlier. The girl is saved, but not by the huntsman; when the wolf tries to eat her, its mouth is burned by the golden hood she wears, which is enchanted. James N. Barker wrote a variation of Little Red Riding Hood in 1827 as an approximately 1000-word story. It was later reprinted in 1858 in a book of collected stories edited by William E Burton, called the Cyclopedia of Wit and Humor. The reprint also features a wood engraving of a clothed wolf on a bended knee holding Little Red Riding Hood's hand. In the 20th century, the popularity of the tale appeared to snowball, with many new versions being written and produced, especially in the wake of Freudian analysis, deconstruction and feminist critical theory. (See \\"Modern uses and adaptations\\" below.) This trend has also led to a number of academic texts being written that focus on Little Red Riding Hood, including works by Alan Dundes and Jack Zipes. Interpretations A depiction by Gustave Dor√©, 1883. Apart from the overt warning about talking to strangers, there are many interpretations of the classic fairy tale, many of them sexual.Jane Yolen, Touch Magic p 25, Some are listed below. =Natural cycles= Folklorists and cultural anthropologists, such as P. Saintyves and Edward Burnett Tylor, saw \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" in terms of solar myths and other naturally occurring cycles. Her red hood could represent the bright sun which is ultimately swallowed by the terrible night (the wolf), and the variations in which she is cut out of the wolf's belly represent the dawn. In this interpretation, there is a connection between the wolf of this tale and Sk√∂ll, the wolf in Norse mythology that will swallow the personified Sun at Ragnar√∂k, or Fenrir. Alternatively, the tale could be about the season of spring or the month of May, escaping the winter. Red Riding Hood by George Frederic Watts =Rite= The tale has been interpreted as a puberty rite, stemming from a prehistoric origin (sometimes an origin stemming from a previous matriarchal era). The girl, leaving home, enters a liminal state and by going through the acts of the tale, is transformed into an adult woman by the act of coming out of the wolf's stomach. =Rebirth= Bruno Bettelheim, in The Uses of Enchantment: The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales (1976), recast the Little Red Riding Hood motif in terms of classic Freudian analysis, that shows how fairy tales educate, support, and liberate children's emotions. The motif of the huntsman cutting open the wolf he interpreted as a \\"rebirth\\"; the girl who foolishly listened to the wolf has been reborn as a new person. =Norse myth= The poem \\"√ûrymskvi√∞a\\" from the Poetic Edda mirrors some elements of Red Riding Hood. Loki's explanations for the strange behavior of \\"Freyja\\" (actually Thor disguised as Freyja) mirror the wolf's explanations for his strange appearance. The red hood has often been given great importance in many interpretations, with a significance from the dawn to blood. =Erotic, romantic, or rape connotations= A sexual analysis of the tale may also include negative connotations in terms of rape or abduction. In Against Our Will, Susan Brownmiller describes the fairy tale as a description of rape. However, many revisionist retellings choose to focus on empowerment, and depict Little Red Riding Hood or the grandmother successfully defending herself against the wolf. Such tellings bear some similarity to the \\"animal bridegroom\\" tales, such as Beauty and the Beast or The Frog Prince, but where the heroines of those tales revert the hero to a prince, these tellings of Little Red Riding Hood reveal to the heroine that she has a wild nature like the hero's. These interpretations refuse to characterize Little Red Riding Hood as a victim; these are tales of female empowerment. In popular culture Works Progress Administration poster by Kenneth Whitley, 1939 =Animation and film= * In Tex Avery's short animated cartoon, Red Hot Riding Hood (1943), the story is recast in an adult-oriented urban setting, with the suave, sharp-dressed Wolf howling after the nightclub singer Red. Avery used the same cast and themes in a subsequent series of cartoons. * Neil Jordan directed a film version of The Company of Wolves (1984) based on the short story by Angela Carter. The wolf in this version of the tale is in fact a werewolf, which comes to the newly-menstruating Red Riding Hood in the forest, in the form of a charming hunter. The hunter turns into a wolf and eats her grandmother, and is about to devour Red Riding Hood as well, but she is equally seductive and ends up lying with the wolf man. This version may be interpreted as a young girl's journey into womanhood, both with regard to menstruation and sexual awakening. * Soyuzmultfilm (1937) is a classic Soviet, black-and-white, animated film by the sisters Brumberg, \\"grandmothers of the Russian animation\\". Its plot differs slightly from the original fairy tale. It was issued on videotapes in various collections in the 1980s, via the SECAM system, and in the 1990s, via the PAL system, in collections of animated films of a video studio \\"Soyuz\\" (since 1994 and 1995 respectively). * The Big Bad Wolf is an animated short released on 13 April 1934 by United Artists, produced by Walt Disney and directed by Burt Gillett as part of the Silly Symphony series.

Now, the animated movie is considered a cult film, many phrases have become part of popular culture, and in 1959 and 1960, the film received awards at festivals in Kyiv, Ukraine and Ansi, Estonia. In Russia, it is repeatedly republished on DVD in collections of animated films. * The 1996 movie Freeway is a modern crime drama loosely adapted from the Riding Hood story, with Riding Hood (Reese Witherspoon) recast as a teenage prostitute, and the wolf (Kiefer Sutherland) being a serial killer named Bob Wolverton.

Super Show! episode, \\"Little Red Riding Princess\\" with Princess Toadstool in the role of 'Red Riding Hood' and King Koopa in the role of the Big Bad Wolf. * Children at Play (2010) is a short film written and directed by Lexan Rosser, starring Bryan Dechart. The film can be interpreted as a reimagining of the classic fairy tale due to its number of overt/subtle parallels and references. *The character Ruby Rose in the popular internet series RWBY is based on \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\". =Television= * In the pilot episode \\"Wolf Moon\\" of the MTV hit series Teen Wolf the protagonist Scott McCall wears a red hoody, when he gets attacked by an alpha werewolf in the woods in the night of a full moon. * The pilot episode of NBC's TV series Grimm reveals that the Red Riding Hood stories were inspired by the fabled attacks of Blutbaden, lycanthropic beings who have a deeply ingrained bloodlust and a weakness for victims wearing red. * Red Riding Hood is a character in ABC's Once Upon a Time (2011) TV series. In this version of the tale, Red (portrayed by Meghan Ory) is a werewolf, and her cape is the only thing that can prevent her from metamorphosing during a full moon.

In her revision of the classic, Carter examines female lust, which according to author Catherine Orenstein is \\"healthy, but also challenging and sometimes disturbing, unbridled and feral lust that delivers up contradictions.\\" As Orenstein points out, Carter does this by unravelling the original tale's \\"underlying sexual currents\\" and by impregnating the new Little Red Riding Hood (Rosaleen played by Sarah Patterson) with \\"animal instincts\\" that lead to her transformation. * In Michelle Augello-Page's story \\"Wolf Moon\\", Little Red is an adult who has been irrevocably changed by the events in her childhood, and it is the hunter who saves her \\"once upon a time, and again\\" in this tale of sexual awakening, bdsm, relationships, female rites and rebirth. * In the manga Tokyo Akazukin the protagonist is an 11-year-old girl nicknamed \\"Red Riding Hood\\" or \\"Red Hood\\".

The book is written as an expression of the Singaporean identity. *Scarlet is a 2013 novel written by Marissa Meyer that was loosely adapted from the fairy tale. In the story, a girl named Scarlet is trying to find her missing grandmother with the help of a mysterious street fighter called Wolf. It is the second book of The Lunar Chronicles. *The Land of Stories is a series written by Chris Colfer.

A hunter killed the wolf before it could kill her. He took her in as his own out of pity. The Red Riding Hood of this story convinced the hunter to teach her how to fight. They protected the forest together until the hunter was killed during a wolf attack. The Red Riding Hood continued on protecting the forest and took in other orphaned girls and taught them to fight too. They take up wearing a red riding hood and cape to honor their teacher. Even after the death of the original Red Riding Hood the girls continue doing what she did in life. * In the fighting game Darkstalkers 3 (1997), the character Baby Bonnie Hood (known in the Japanese release as Bulleta) is a parody of Little Red Riding Hood, complete with a childish look, red hood and picnic basket. But instead of food, her basket is full of guns and grenades. Her personality is somewhat psychotic, guerrilla-crazy. During the fights, a small dog named Harry watches the action from the sidelines and reacts to her taking damage in battle. Two rifle-wielding huntsmen named John and Arthur briefly appear alongside her in a special power-up move titled \\"Beautiful Hunting\\" that inflicts extra damage on opponents. The character may be based on the James Thurber or Roald Dahl versions of the story, where Red pulls a gun from her basket and shoots the wolf, and the idea behind her character was to show that at their worst, humans are scarier than any imaginary monster. * In the free-to-play mobile game Minimon: Adventure of Minions (2016), Luna is a wolflike minion and agent of a secret society with humanlike physical characteristics who wears a red hood when awakened, which references both the Big Bad Wolf and Red Riding Hood. * SINoALICE (2017) is a mobile Gacha game which features Red Riding Hood as one of the main player controlled characters and features in her own dark story-line which features her as a brutally violent girl whose main desire is to inflict violence, pain and death upon her enemies as well as the other fairy-tale characters featured in the game. =Musicals= * Little Red Riding Hood is one of the central characters in the Broadway musical Into the Woods (1987) by Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine. In the song, \\"I Know Things Now\\", she speaks of how the wolf made her feel \\"excited, well, excited and scared\\", in a reference to the sexual undertones of their relationship. Red Riding Hood's cape is also one of the musical's four quest items that are emblematic of fairy tales.

The Congressional budget process Titles I through IX of the law are also known as the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Title II created the Congressional Budget Office. Title III governs the procedures by which Congress annually adopts a budget resolution, a concurrent resolution that is not signed by the President, which sets fiscal policy for the Congress. This budget resolution sets limits on revenues and spending that may be enforced in Congress through procedural objections called points of order. The budget resolution can also specify that a budget reconciliation bill be written, which the Congress will then consider under expedited procedures.  Later amendments  The act has been amended several times, including provisions in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The original 1974 legislation, however, remains the basic blueprint for budget procedures today.  The Byrd Rule  The limitation on debate that prevents a budget reconciliation bill from being filibustered in the Senate (requiring a three-fifths vote to end debate) led to frequent attempts to attach amendments unrelated to the budget to the reconciliation bills. In response, the budget reconciliation acts of 1985, 1986, and 1990 adopted the \\"Byrd Rule\\" (Section 313 of the Budget Act). The Byrd Rule allows Senators to raise points of order (which can be waived by a three-fifths majority of Senators) against provisions in the reconciliation bills that are \\"extraneous\\". Provisions are considered extraneous if they: # do not produce a change in outlays or revenues; # produce changes in outlays or revenue which are merely incidental to the non-budgetary components of the provision; # are outside the jurisdiction of the committee that submitted the title or provision for inclusion in the reconciliation measure; # increase outlays or decrease revenue if the provision's title, as a whole, fails to achieve the Senate reporting committee's reconciliation instructions; # increase net outlays or decrease revenue during a fiscal year after the years covered by the reconciliation bill unless the provision's title, as a whole, remains budget neutral; or # contain recommendations regarding the OASDI (social security) trust funds. = Sunset provisions = Since the reconciliation bill may cover as many as ten years, the fifth provision can have the effect of requiring that any tax cut or spending increase be approved by a three-fifths majority, or else the law must return to its previous state after ten years. This is responsible for the use of sunset clauses in several recent budget acts, when proposed tax cuts commanded majority support but not the necessary three- fifths majority to suspend the Byrd Rule. For example, many of the provisions of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 would have expired as soon as fiscal year 2010 if not extended. The provisions that were to expire included the $1000 per child tax credit, the 10% income tax bracket for low-income workers, and the deduction for state and local sales taxes paid. The expiration dates in those Acts were inserted in order to avoid Byrd Rule points of order. Provisions against which a Byrd Rule point of order is sustained are colloquially referred to as \\"Byrd droppings\\". Impoundment Title X of the Act, also known as the Impoundment Control Act of 1974, specifies that the President may request that Congress rescind appropriated funds. If both the Senate and the House of Representatives have not approved a rescission proposal (by passing legislation) within 45 days of continuous session, any funds being withheld must be made available for obligation. Congress is not required to vote on the request, and has ignored most Presidential requests. In response, some have called for a line item veto to strengthen the rescission power and force Congress to vote on the disputed funds. The Act was passed because Congressional representatives thought that President Nixon had abused his power of impoundment by withholding funds for programs he opposed. The Act, especially after Train v. City of New York (1975), effectively removed the presidential power of impoundment.420 U.S. 35 (1975). Violations of the Act are occasionally recognized and documented by the U. S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) after Congressional representatives request an investigation. In 2011 GAO found that a White House office had violated a budget law that forbade use of a particular budget for partnerships with Chinese representatives. The amount of money was small but a mandate from Congress was violated.GAO's Gibson, letter to Rep.

Among the concerns was the questionable transfer of decision-making authority to Michael Duffey, a political appointee. Further emails released showed that Acting Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) Elaine McCusker emailed the White House Office of Management and Budget expressing her concerns beginning in July 2019 that the White House withholding fund from Ukraine could be violating the Impoundment Control Act. On 16 January 2020, the GAO issued a decision on the \\"Matter of: Office of Management and Budget- Withholding of Ukraine Security Assistance.\\" The GAO report found that, \\"In the summer of 2019, OMB withheld from obligation approximately $214 million appropriated to DOD for security assistance to Ukraine. (...) OMB withheld amounts by issuing a series of nine apportionment schedules with footnotes that made all unobligated balances for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) unavailable for obligation.

In April 1640 Herbert was elected MP for Reading and for Old Sarum and chose to sit for Old Sarum in the Short Parliament. He was re-elected MP for Old Sarum in November 1640 for the Long Parliament. Having been appointed Attorney-General he was instructed by King Charles I to take legal proceedings against various members of parliament who had been concerned in the passing of the Grand Remonstrance.

The Buffalo River, located in Northern Arkansas, was the first National River to be designated in the United States. The Buffalo River is long. The lower flow within the boundaries of an area managed by the National Park Service, where the stream is designated the Buffalo National River. The river flows through Newton, Searcy, Marion, and Baxter Counties, from west to east. The river originates in the highest part of the Boston Mountains of the Ozarks, flows out onto the Springfield Plateau near the historic community of Erbie, and finally crosses a portion of the Salem Plateau just before joining the White River. The Park is home to the state's only elk herd. The upper section of the river in the Ozark National Forest is managed by the U.S. Forest Service and is designated as a National Scenic River and a National Wild River; that section is not part of the area managed as a park by the Park Service but is managed as a part of the Ozark National Forest. The Buffalo National River was established by an Act of Congress on March 1, 1972, ending the recurring plans of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to construct one or more dams on the river. The National River designation protects natural rivers from industrial uses, impoundments and other obstructions that may change the natural character of the river or disrupt the natural habitat for the flora and fauna that live in or near the river. Three segments totaling were designated the Buffalo National River Wilderness in 1975. At a point about above the Park boundary in Newton County, Arkansas, the Buffalo River begins as the Main Prong of Big Buffalo Creek. The river flows north through Boxley to Ponca, where it then begins an eastward trek across northern Arkansas to its confluence with the White River on the Marion-Baxter County line. Advanced canoeists and kayakers often refer to the section upriver from Boxley as the Hailstone River. This extremely challenging section of the river is floatable only during periods of high water and should be attempted only by those with solid whitewater skills. Along the upper river, the gradient is steep and the water is fast, leveling and slowing as the river runs its course. The upper section has most of the whitewater rapids to be found along the river, and features dramatic topography including sink holes and caves, springs, and waterfalls, over tall sandstone and limestone bluffs, and many rock formations. At one point, a hike from the river up a narrow, boxed canyon leads to a waterfall,Ernst, Tim (Nov. 2002). Arkansas Waterfalls Guidebook, Cloudland.net, 224 pp. . Hemmed-In-Hollow Falls, the highest of its kind between the Southern Appalachians and the Rockies. The river's current also gives life to well over 300 species of fish, insects, freshwater mussels, and aquatic plants. The Buffalo National River is a popular camping, hiking, canoeing, and fishing destination. Visitors may bring their own canoes or rent from several independent concessioners. Camping is generally allowed throughout the park with the following exceptions: the Hemmed-in-Hollow area, on Big Bluff, in historical structures, on private property within the park, or within of any trail or watercourse. Camping is, however, permitted on gravel bars and sand bars along the river. In addition, the National Park Service has a number of \\"developed\\" campgrounds along the river.

Lurgan is about 18 miles (29 km) south-west of Belfast and is linked to the city by both the M1 motorway and the Belfast‚ÄìDublin railway line. It had a population of about 25,000 at the 2011 Census and is within the Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon district. For some purposes, Lurgan is treated as part of the \\"Craigavon Urban Area\\" along with neighbouring Craigavon and Portadown. Lurgan is characteristic of many Plantation of Ulster settlements, with its straight, wide planned streets. It is the site of a number of historic listed buildings including Brownlow House and the former town hall. Lurgan Park is the largest urban park in Northern Ireland.Lurgan Park. Outdoor NI. Retrieved 27 July 2019. Historically the town was known as a major centre for the production of textiles (mainly linen) after the industrial revolution and it continued to be a major producer of textiles until that industry steadily declined in the late 20th century. The development of the 'new city' of Craigavon had a major impact on Lurgan in the 1960s when much industry was attracted to the area. The expansion of Craigavon's Rushmere Retail Park in the 2000s has affected the town's retail trade further. History Middle Row, Lurgan, in the late 19th century Birds- eye view of Lurgan in the early 20th century Edward Street, Lurgan, in the early 20th century The name Lurgan is an anglicisation of the Irish name An Lorgain. This literally means \\"the shin\\", but in placenames means a shin- shaped hill or ridge (i.e. one that is long, low and narrow). Earlier names of Lurgan include Lorgain Chlann Bhreasail (anglicised Lurganclanbrassil, meaning \\"the long low ridge of Clanbrassil\\") and Lorgain Bhaile Mhic Cana (anglicised Lurganvallivackan, meaning \\"the long low ridge of McCann's settlement\\").Place Names NI: Lurgan The Mac Cana (McCanns) were a sept of the O'Neills and Lords of Clanbrassil before the Plantation of Ulster in the early 17th century. About 1610, during the Plantation and at a time when the area was sparsely populated by Irish Gaels, the lands of Lurgan were granted to the English lord William Brownlow and his family. Initially the Brownlow family settled near the lough at Annaloist, but by 1619, on a nearby ridge, they had established a castle and bawn for their own accommodation, and \\"a fair Town, consisting of 42 Houses, all of which are inhabited with English Families, and the streets all paved clean through also to water Mills, and a Wind Mill, all for corn.\\" Brownlow became MP for Armagh in the Irish Parliament in 1639. During the Irish Rebellion of 1641, Brownlow's castle and bawn were destroyed, and he and his wife and family were taken prisoner and brought to Armagh and then to Dungannon in County Tyrone. The land was then passed to the Mac Cana clan and the O'Hanlons. In 1642, Brownlow and his family were released by the forces of Lord Conway, and as the rebellion ended they returned to their estate in Lurgan. William Brownlow died in 1660, but the family went on to contribute to the development of the linen industry which peaked in the town in the late 17th century. Theobald Wolfe Tone would often pass through Lurgan on his journeys, writing in 1792 \\"Lurgan green as usual\\". =The Great Famine= A workhouse was built in Lurgan and opened in 1841 under the stipulations of the Poor Law which stated that each Poor Law Union would build a workhouse to give relief to the increasing numbers of destitute poor. In 1821 the population of Lurgan was 2,715, this increased to 4,677 by 1841. There were a couple of reasons for this large growth in population. Firstly the opportunities provided by the booming linen industry led many to abandon their meagre living in rural areas and migrate to Lurgan in the hope of gaining employment. Secondly the ever-expanding town gave tradesmen the opportunity to secure work in the construction of new buildings such as Brownlow House. The large numbers of poor workers migrating to the town inevitably resulted in over-crowding and a very low standard of living. When the potato crop failed for a second time in 1846 the resulting starvation led to a quickly overcrowded workhouse which by the end of 1846 exceeded its 800 capacity. In an attempt to alleviate the problem a relief committee was established in Lurgan as they were in other towns. The relief committees raised money by subscription from local landowners, gentry and members of the clergy and were matched by funds from Dublin. With these monies food was bought and distributed to the ever- increasing numbers of starving people at soup kitchens. In an attempt to provide employment and thereby give the destitute the means to buy food, Lord Lurgan devised a scheme of land- drainage on his estate. The so-called 'famine roads' were not built in Lurgan to the same extent as the rest of Ireland, although land owners also provided outdoor relief by employing labourers to lower hills and repair existing road. During the period 1846 to 1849 the famine claimed 2,933 lives in the Lurgan Union alone. The Lurgan workhouse was situated in the grounds of what is now Lurgan Hospital and a commemorative mural can be seen along the adjacent Tandragee Road. =New city= Lurgan's main street in 1960 The town grew steadily over the centuries as an industrial market town, and in the 1960s, when the UK government was developing a programme of new towns in Great Britain to deal with population growth, the Northern Ireland government also planned a new town to deal with the projected growth of Belfast and to prevent an undue concentration of population in the city. Craigavon (a name unpopular with the Nationalist community) was designated as a new town in 1965, intended to be a linear city incorporating the neighbouring towns of Lurgan and Portadown. The plan largely failed, and today, 'Craigavon' locally refers to the rump of the residential area between the two towns. The Craigavon development, however, did affect Lurgan in a number of ways. The sort of dedicated bicycle and pedestrian paths that were built in Craigavon were also incorporated into newer housing areas in Lurgan, additional land in and around the town was zoned for industrial development, neighbouring rural settlements such as Aghacommon and Aghagallon were developed as housing areas, and there was an increase in the town's population, although not on the scale that had been forecast. The textile industry remained a main employer in the town until the late twentieth century, with the advent of access to cheaper labour in the developing world leading to a decline in the manufacture of clothing in Lurgan. =The Troubles= Lurgan and the associated towns of Portadown and Craigavon made up part of what was known as the \\"murder triangle\\"; an area known for a significant number of incidents and fatalities during The Troubles. Today the town is one of the few areas in Northern Ireland where so-called dissident republicans have a significant level of support. The legacy of the Troubles is continued tension between Roman Catholics and Protestants, which has occasionally erupted into violence at flashpoint 'interface areas'. On 5 March 1992, a 1,000 lb truck bomb, believed to have been planted by the IRA, exploded in Main Street causing mass damage to commercial properties. On 5 February 2020, the PSNI found a bomb on a lorry. The Continuity Irish Republican Army admitted they had planted it. They expected the lorry to be put on a North Channel ferry in January 2020.Continuity IRA admits Brexit Day bomb plot Geography Lurgan sits in a relatively flat part of Ireland by the south east shore of Lough Neagh. The two main formations in north Armagh are an area of estuarine clays by the shore of the lough, and a mass of basalt farther back. The earliest human settlements in the area were to the northwest of the present day town near the shore of the lough. When the land was handed to the Brownlow family, they initially settled near the lough at Annaloist, but later settled where the town was eventually built. The oldest part of the town, the main street, is built on a long ridge in the townland (baile fearainn) of Lurgan. A neighbouring hill is the site of Brownlow House, which overlooks Lurgan Park. =Townlands= Like the rest of Ireland, the Lurgan area has long been divided into townlands, whose names mostly come from the Irish language. Lurgan sprang up in the townland of the same name. Over time, the surrounding townlands have been built upon and they have given their names to many roads and housing estates. The following is a list of townlands within Lurgan's urban area, alongside their likely etymologies: Shankill parish: *Aghnacloy () *Ballyblagh (from Baile Bl√°thach meaning \\"flowery townland\\") *Demesne (an English name ‚Äì this townland was carved out of Drumnamoe and others, and includes Lurgan Park) *Derry (from Doire meaning \\"oak grove\\") *Dougher (formerly Doucharron, probably from An Dubhcharn, D√∫charn meaning \\"the black cairn\\") *Drumnamoe (from Druim na mB√≥ meaning \\"ridge of the cows\\") *Knocknashane (formerly Knocknashangan, from Cnoc na Seang√°n meaning \\"hill of the ants\\") *Lurgantarry (from Lurgain an tSamhraidh meaning \\"summer ridge\\" or \\"ridge of the summer grazing\\") *Shankill (from Seanchill meaning \\"old church\\" or Seanchoill meaning \\"old wood\\") *Taghnevan (formerly Tegnevan, from Teach Neamhain meaning \\"Neamhan's house\\" or \\"Neamhan's church\\")\\"The \\"Danes\\" on Lough Neagh\\". Journal of Craigavon Historical Society, Vol. 1 No. 2. *Tannaghmore North & Tannaghmore South (from an Tamhnach M√≥r meaning \\"the big grassy field\\") *Toberhewny (from Tobar Shuibhne meaning \\"Sweeney's well\\" or Tobar Chainnigh meaning \\"Cainneach's well\\") *Tirsogue (from T√≠r S√≠dhe√≥g meaning \\"land of the fairies\\") Seagoe parish: *Ballynamony (from Baile na M√≥nadh meaning \\"townland of the bog\\") *Drumnakelly (from Dromainn U√≠ Cheallaigh meaning \\"O‚ÄôKelly's ridge\\") *Silverwood (an English name ‚Äì formerly called Killinargit, from Coill an Airgid meaning \\"wood of the silver\\") *Turmoyra (from T√≠r Maighre meaning \\"land of the salmon\\") =Climate= Lurgan has a temperate climate in common with inland areas in Ireland. Summer temperatures can reach the 20s ¬∞C and it is rare for them to go higher than . The consistently humid climate that prevails over Ireland can make temperatures feel uncomfortable when they stray into the high 20s ¬∞C (80‚Äì85 ¬∞F), more so than similar temperatures in hotter climates in the rest of Europe.  Governance  Lurgan Town Hall in Union Street. Built in 1868 and now owned by Craigavon Borough CouncilLurgan is part of the Upper Bann constituency for the purpose of elections to the UK Parliament at Westminster. This has long been a safe unionist seat and the current MP is David Simpson of the Democratic Unionist Party. Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly at Stormont are elected from six-member constituencies using proportional representation and using the same constituencies as for Westminster. Lurgan town commissioners were first elected in 1855, and they were replaced by Lurgan Urban District Council following the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898. This effectively ended landlord control of local government in Ireland. The town council was abolished when local government was reformed in Northern Ireland in 1973 under the Local Government (Boundaries) Act (Northern Ireland) 1971 and the Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) 1972. These abolished the two-tier system of town and county councils replacing it with the single-tier system. Lurgan was placed under the jurisdiction of Craigavon Borough Council, and remained so until a new act streamlined and merged the various districts in 2015. Today Lurgan forms part of the new Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon District. The Lurgan area contains the following wards: Church, Donaghcloney, Knocknashane, Magheralin, Mourneview, Parklake, and Waringstown. Seven councillors are elected to represent the Lurgan electoral area on the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council. The following individuals were elected at the most recent 2014 Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon District Council election: Lurgan Town Hall is owned by the new District Council but has not been used to conduct Council business since the Town Council was abolished in 1972. Demography For census purposes, Lurgan is not treated as a separate entity by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA). Instead, it is combined with Craigavon, Portadown and Bleary to form the \\"Craigavon Urban Area\\". A fairly accurate population count can be found by combining the data of the electoral wards that make up the Lurgan urban area. These are Church, Court, Drumnamoe, Knocknashane, Mourneview, Parklake, Taghnevan and Woodville. On the day of the last census (27 March 2011) the combined population of these wards was 25,093. Of this population: *62.2% were from a Catholic background, and 33.7% were from a Protestant or other Christian background The town is divided along ethnic/political/sectarian lines with entire housing areas being almost exclusively Nationalist/Catholic/Irish or almost exclusively Unionist/Protestant/British. The north end of the town centre is considered Nationalist/Catholic, the south end is considered Unionist/Protestant, with the \\"invisible dividing line\\" crossing Market Street at Castle Lane and Carnegie Street. In the 1980s there were two Unionist/Protestant enclaves in the north end of the town, Gilpinstown and Wakehurst. They have both since changed to become Nationalist/Catholic areas as Unionists/Protestants gradually moved out. There was a Synagogue at 49 North Street for the Lurgan Hebrew Congregation, founded prior to 1906 by Joseph Herbert (originally Herzberg) from Tukums in Latvia, but this closed in the 1920s around the time of the founder's death. Economy Lurgan has historically been an industrial town in which the linen industry predominated as a source of employment during the Industrial Revolution, and is said to have employed as many as 18,000 handloom weavers at the end of the 19th century, a figure significantly higher than the town's resident population at the time. That particular branch of the textile industry declined as consumer tastes changed, but other textiles continued to be produced in the town providing a major source of employment until the 1990s and 2000s when the textile industry across the UK suffered a major decline as a result of outsourcing to low wage countries. The large Goodyear fan-belt factory at Silverwood Industrial Estate was a product of the Craigavon development when large tracts of land in Lurgan, Portadown, and areas in between were zoned off for exclusive industrial use. The Goodyear factory closed in 1983 after failing to make a profit, resulting in the loss of 750 jobs. The facility was later partly occupied by Wilson Double Deck Trailers and DDL Electronics. Silverwood Industrial Estate continues to host other manufacturing and light engineering firms. Other industrial areas in the town are Annesborough and Halfpenny Valley (Portadown Road) industrial estates; areas in which growth has been limited compared to other industrial estates in the Craigavon Borough. A key component of the Craigavon development was a central business district halfway between Lurgan and Portadown that would serve as the city centre for the whole of the new city. What was built was an office building, a court house, a civic building, and a small shopping centre alongside several acres of parkland that were developed around the newly created balancing lakes that also serve as part of the area's drainage system. In the 1990s, the shopping centre was significantly expanded to form what is now Rushmere Retail Park, containing many major retail stores. This has had a detrimental effect on the retail trade in Lurgan in the same way that out-of-town shopping developments in other parts of Northern Ireland have damaged other traditional town centres. The town's Chamber of Commerce is not functioning and has remained dormant despite numerous attempts to revive it. Culture and community =Cultural references= There is a figure of speech used in Ireland ‚Äì to have a face as long as a Lurgan spade ‚Äì meaning \\"to look miserable\\". The origins of this expression are disputed. One theory is that a \\"Lurgan spade\\" was an under-paid workman digging what is now the Lurgan Park lake. Another theory is that it could be from the Irish language lorga sp√°d meaning the shaft (literally \\"shin\\") of a spade. The ballad Master McGrath concerns a greyhound of that name from Lurgan which became an Irish sporting hero. The dog was bought in Lurgan by the Brownlow family, and the song also mentions his owner Charles Brownlow, referred to in the lyrics as Lord Lurgan. Master McGrath won the Waterloo Cup hare coursing competition three times in 1868, 1870 and 1871 at a time when this was a high-profile sport. A post mortem found that he had a heart twice the size of what is normal for a dog of his size. He is remembered all over the town, including in its coat of arms. The dog was named McGrath after the kennel boy responsible for its care. A statue of him was unveiled at Craigavon Civic Centre in 1993, over 120 years after his last glory in 1871. The statue was relocated to Lurgan town centre in 2013. A festival is also held yearly in his honour. A Lurgan pub was also named after Master McGrath, although it has been renamed in recent years. The town is a frequent recipient of derision by the BBC Northern Ireland comedy panel show The Blame Game. =Community facilities= Oxford Island is a nature reserve on the shore of Lough Neagh that includes Kinnego Marina and the Lough Neagh Discovery Center, which is an interpretive visitor centre offering information about the surrounding wildlife, conference facilities, and a caf√©. Lurgan Park, a few hundred yards from the main street, is the largest urban park in Northern Ireland and the second-largest in Ireland after Phoenix Park, Dublin. It used to be part of the estate of Brownlow House, a 19th-century Elizabethan-style manor house. In 1893, the land was purchased by Lurgan Borough Council and opened as a public park in 1909 by Earl Aberdeen, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. It includes a sizeable artificial lake and an original Coalbrookdale fountain. Today the park is home to annual summer events such as the Lurgan Agricultural Show, and the Lurgan Park Rally, noted as the largest annual motor sport event in Northern Ireland and a stage in the Circuit of Ireland rally. Mount Zion House in Edward St, formerly the St Joseph's Convent, is now a cross-community centre run by the Shankill Lurgan Community Association/Community Projects. It is funded by the Department for Social Development, the EU Special Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, and the Physical and Social Environment Programme. Landmarks Brownlow House Lurgan Park, formerly part of the Brownlows' estate, and now a public space. The former Johnson & Allen linen factory on Victoria Street, built in 1888 and now used as multiple small industrial and retail units Lurgan town centre is distinctive for its wide main street, Market Street, one of the widest in Ireland, which is dominated at one end by Shankill (Anglican) Church in Church Place. A grey granite hexagonal temple- shaped war memorial sits at the entrance to Church Place, topped by a bronze- winged statue representing the spirit of Victorious Peace. A marble pillar at the centre displays the names of over 400 men from the town who lost their lives in the First World War. The rows of buildings on either side of Market Street are punctuated periodically by large access gates that lead to the space behind the buildings, gates that are wide enough to drive a horse and cart through. The town's straight planned streets are a common feature in many Plantation towns, and its industrial history is still evident in the presence of many former linen mills that have since been modified for modern use. At the junction of Market Street and Union Street is the former Lurgan Town Hall, a listed building erected in 1868. It was the first site of the town's library in 1891, was temporarily used as a police station in 1972 when it was handed to the Police Authority, and is today owned by the Mechanics' Institute and is available for conferences and community functions. Brownlow House, known locally as 'Lurgan Castle', is a distinctive mansion built in 1833 with Scottish sandstone in an Elizabethan style with a lantern-shaped tower and prominent array of chimney pots. It was originally owned by the Brownlow family, and today is owned by the Lurgan Loyal Orange District Lodge. A former lodge to the Brownlow House estate became the Brownlow Arms Hotel on Market Street, run by the McCaffrey family, which served as the US 5th Army's Officers' Mess during WW2 but closed in the early 1960s. The adjacent Lurgan Park, now a public park owned by Craigavon Borough Council, used to be part of the same estate. The park is the venue for the Lurgan Park Rally. =Religious sites= St Peter's Catholic Church, North St. Built in 1832 The site of what is now Shankill cemetery served as a place of worship over the centuries. It began in ancient times as a simple double ring fort, the outline of which is still noticeable, and is today an historic burial site holding the remains of people who lived in the earliest days of the town's existence, including the Brownlow family. Dougher cemetery is another old graveyard that was donated to the Catholic people by the Brownlows following passage of the Catholic Relief Act. The two most prominent modern places of worship are Shankill Parish Church in Church Place and St Peter's Church in North Street, the steeples of which are visible from far outside the town. Shankill Parish Church belongs to the Anglican Church of Ireland. The original church was established at Oxford Island on the shore of Lough Neagh in 1411, but a new church was built in Lurgan on the site of what is now Shankill Cemetery in 1609 as the town became the main centre of settlement in the area. It was eventually found to be too small given the growth of the town, and the Irish Parliament granted permission to build a replacement in 1725 one mile away on the 'Green of Lurgan', now known as Church Place, where it stands to this day. It is believed to be the largest parish church in Ireland, and contains the only set of change ringing bells in County Armagh. Following passage of the Catholic Relief Act, Charles Brownlow granted a site to the Roman Catholic parish priest the Reverend William O'Brien in 1829 for the construction of a church on Distillery Hill, now known as lower North Street. It was there that work began in 1832 on what is now St Peter's Church. In 1966, another Catholic church, St Paul's, was built at the junction of Francis Street and Parkview Street. This was a radical departure from traditional church architecture with its grey plaster finish, copper roof, slim spire, hexagonal angles and modern design throughout. Many of its architectural features such as the copper roof and gray plaster finish are shared by the neighbouring St Paul's School. It was designed to cope with the extra demand for worship space following the growth of the surrounding Taghnevan and Shankill housing estates. The Lurgan Museum houses one of the largest collections of items relating to Irish History in Northern Ireland. The Museum has many photographs and artefacts connected with Lurgan life over the past 150 years. It houses an extensive collection relating to the periods known as \\"The Troubles\\", \\"Operation Harvest\\" 1956‚Äì62, and \\"The 1916 Easter Rising\\". This collection also has a popular section covering the social history of the area. The first Methodist church was built in Nettleton's Court, Queen Street in 1778. It was found to be too small and a new church was built on High Street in 1802, and replaced by a newer building in front of it in 1826. This was extensively renovated in 1910 and stands to this day sporting a simple facade. Education Lurgan Model Primary SchoolIt was the late 19th century that saw the development of formal education in Lurgan and a significant move away from the less organised hedge schools of before. Today, schools in Lurgan operate under the Dickson Plan, a transfer system in north Armagh that allows pupils at age 11 the option of taking the 11-plus exam to enter grammar schools, with pupils in comprehensive junior high schools being sorted into grammar and non-grammar streams. Pupils can get promoted to or demoted from the grammar stream during their time in those schools depending on the development of their academic performance, and at age 14 can take subject-based exams across the syllabus to qualify for entry into a dedicated grammar school to pursue GCSEs and A-levels. As is common in Northern Ireland, most of the schools in Lurgan are attended mainly by children from one or other of the two main ethno-religious blocs, reflecting the existence of deep-seated ethnic, sectarian and political divisions in society. Some schools are in the Catholic 'maintained' sector, i.e. maintained by the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools, and others are controlled directly by the state. Directly controlled state schools generally have a predominantly Protestant intake. =Primary education= At primary level, schools attended by the Unionist/Protestant community are Carrick Primary School, Dickson Primary School, and King's Park Primary School. The Model School was part of the national schools programme proposed in 1831 in which each county in Ireland would have at least one school that would serve as an example to other national schools in the area and as a teacher training establishment (although teacher training did not take place at this particular school). Initially it had a multi-denominational intake, offered such services as night classes and industry-relevant vocational courses, and was enthusiastically supported by William Brownlow who is thought to have brought the school to the town. It was undermined, however, by church interests, which were opposed to its lack of ecclesiastical control, and criticism of the efficiency of its management, hence losing much of its earlier prestige as the premier educational establishment in the town. Over the years, the intake of Nationalist/Catholic students steadily increased, due mainly to being situated in the Catholic area of Lurgan. The student body is now almost 100% Catholic. Other Catholic primary schools are Carrick Primary School, Bunscoil Naomh Proinsias, St. Francis' Primary School, St Teresa's Primary School, St Anthony's Primary School, Tannaghmore Primary School, and Tullygally Primary School. =Post-primary education= At secondary level, schools attended by the Unionist-Protestant community are Lurgan College, and Lurgan Junior High School (formerly part of Lurgan College of Further Education). Lurgan College, now a co-ed 14‚Äì18 grammar school, was established in 1873 as an all-boys school to provide what was known as 'classical education' as opposed to the more practical vocational education on offer at the Model School. Its initial charter included a provision that \\"no person being in Holy Orders, or a minister of any religious denomination shall at any time interfere in the management of the said school, or be appointed to serve as master\\" and that no religious instruction was to take place during school hours. Secondary schools attended by the Nationalist-Catholic community were previously St Mary's Junior High School, St Paul's Junior High School, and St Michael's Grammar School, which have emerged to become one school spanning the 3 sites, St Ronan's College. St Mary's Intermediate School was built on Kitchen Hill after land was acquired from the Sisters of Mercy in 1955 and was opened in 1959 as an all-girls school. The nearby all-boys St Paul's Intermediate School was opened in 1962, and both of these schools are now known as junior high schools. Pupils attend these schools from age 11 to 13, at which time they have the option of transferring to St Michael's if they qualify. Those who do not qualify may stay on at St Paul's and St Mary's until minimum school leaving age at 16 and where the option of taking GCSE exams is available. A significant number of people from Lurgan also attend the Catholic maintained Lismore Comprehensive School in Craigavon. Lurgan Technical College was renamed Lurgan College of Further Education, and subsequently merged with Portadown CFE and Banbridge CFE into the larger Upper Bann Institute of Further and Higher Education (UBIFHE). Further education in the region was consolidated further when this institution was merged with other FE colleges in Armagh, Newry and Kilkeel to form the Southern Regional College. The Lurgan campus is one of the few educational institutions in the area with a mixed denominational intake. It offers vocational courses as an alternative to A-Levels, and adult education services. =Special needs education= Ceara School provides education for pupils aged 3 through 19 who have severe learning difficulties. Sport and leisure =Facilities= Lurgan has a municipal swimming pool and leisure complex called Waves. This includes a swimming pool, squash courts, a gym, and offers such activities as pilates, circuit training, and spinning classes. Following a vote taken by Craigavon Borough Council on 7 April 2010, Waves is to be closed as will the Cascades Centre in Portadown, and both facilities are to be replaced by a large central swimming facility that will be built near the Craigavon balancing lakes. Lurgan has two 18-hole golf courses, an artificial ski slope and an equestrian centre for show jumping. =GAA= Lurgan has a large GAA presence, with Gaelic football being played by clubs Clan na Gael CLG, Clann √âireann GAC, √âire √ìg CLG, Sarsfields GAC (Derrytrasna), St Mary's GAC (Aghagallon), St Michael's GAC (Magheralin), St Paul's GFC, St Peter's GAC and Wolfe Tone GAC, Derrymacash. There is also a well-respected girls camogie club at Clann √âireann, and boys hurling club Se√°n Treasy's, which has been amalgamated at a youth level with Portadown's St Malachy's, to create North Armagh Hurling. =Football= The town is home to NIFL Premiership club Glenavon, established in 1889 and based at Mourneview Park. In 1952, Glenavon became the first club outside Belfast to win the Irish League title, and picked up a further two titles in 1957 and 1960. NIFL Premier Intermediate League club Dollingstown play at nearby Planters Park. Lurgan also has a strong footballing scene in the lower leagues, with clubs such as Lurgan Town, Oxford Sunnyside and Craigavon City representing the area in the intermediate divisions of the Mid- Ulster Football League, while Derryhirk United, Hill Street, Lurgan BBOB and Goodyear play in the junior divisions. Lurgan Celtic previously played in the NIFL Championship and Premier Intermediate League, but following financial difficulties, the club resigned from league football on 15 August 2019, and will resume senior activities from Mid-Ulster Junior Division 3 for the 2020‚Äì21 season. =Other sport= Boxing is a common sport amongst children and adults of all ages and gender, with clubs such as South Paw Boxing and Fitness club and The Fitness Factory being popular choices. Cricket has two clubs, Lurgan Cricket Club and Victoria Cricket Club. Rugby union is played by Lurgan RFC, who share their Pollock Park ground with Lurgan Cricket Club. Tennis is played by Lurgan Tennis Club which is in Lurgan Park. Lurgan Golf Club is an 18-hole challenging parkland course bordering on Lurgan lake. The Lurgan Park Rally, inaugurated in 1980, was one of the largest motorsport events on the island of Ireland. However, the event has been on hiatus since 2017. Railway links Lurgan railway station opened by the Ulster Railway on 18 November 1841, connecting the town to Belfast Great Victoria Street in the east and Portadown and Armagh in the west. The Great Northern Railway of Ireland provided further access to the west of Ulster which was then closed in the 1950s and 1960s from Portadown railway station. Presently Lurgan railway station is run by Northern Ireland Railways with direct trains to Belfast Great Victoria Street and as part of the Dublin-Belfast railway line. The Enterprise runs through Lurgan from Dublin Connolly to Belfast Central, and a change of train may be required at Portadown to travel to or Dublin Connolly. Railway access at Sydenham links into George Best Belfast City Airport on the line to Bangor. Road transport and public services High Street. Lurgan is also situated by the M1 motorway connecting the town to Belfast. Bus services, provided by Translink, arrive and depart on a regular basis from bus stops on Market Street to Belfast, Portadown, Armagh, Dungannon, and surrounding areas. Electricity is supplied by Northern Ireland Electricity which was privatised in 1993 and is now a subsidiary of ESB Group. The gasworks used to be in North St., but there is no longer any town gas since it was abolished in Northern Ireland in the 1980s by the Thatcher government for being uneconomical, although it was restored to the greater Belfast area in 1996. Water is supplied by Northern Ireland Water, a public owned utility. Media Lurgan is served by two weekly local newspapers. The Lurgan Mail, published by Johnston Publishing (NI), reports news and sport from around the local area. The Lurgan and Portadown Examiner also reports local news and sport with an emphasis on photographs of local people at sporting and social events.

He served as a Teachta D√°la (TD) for the Mayo West constituency from 1977 to 1994. Early life Flynn was born in Castlebar, County Mayo, in 1939. He is the son of Patrick and Anne Flynn. He was educated in St. Gerald's College, Castlebar and qualified as a teacher from St Patrick's College of Education in Dublin. His mother owned a small shop in Castlebar. He was married in 1963, to Dorothy and they have four children, one son and three daughters. One daughter, Beverley Flynn was also a Fianna F√°il politician. He first held political office in 1967, when he became a member of Mayo County Council. Ten years later, at the 1977 general election, he was elected to D√°il √âireann as a Fianna F√°il TD for the Mayo West constituency. On the day the 21st Dail convened in Leinster House, Frank Dunlop described Flynn's encounter with the then Taoiseach Jack Lynch:Sweeney, Eamonn. Down Down Deeper and Down: Ireland in the 70's and 80's, pg 126. Ministerial career Flynn was a supporter of Charles Haughey in the 1979 Fianna F√°il leadership contest. His loyalty was rewarded when he became a Minister of State at the Department of Transport and Power. Flynn joined the Cabinet for the first time following the February 1982 general election when he was appointed Minister for the Gaeltacht. In October 1982, in a minor reshuffle, he became Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism. However, his time in this office was brief, since Fianna F√°il lost the November 1982 general election. Fianna F√°il was returned to power in the 1987 general election and Flynn became Minister for the Environment. Two years later he opposed the formation of the coalition government with the Progressive Democrats, describing it \\"as hitting at Fianna F√°il core values.\\" In 1990, he attacked the opposition presidential candidate Mary Robinson on a radio show, accusing her of \\"having a new-found interest in her family\\" for the purposes of her election campaign. This attack backfired drastically, causing many women who initially supported Lenihan to back Robinson. Lenihan's campaign never recovered, and Robinson became Ireland's first female President. In 1991, Flynn was sacked from the Cabinet because of his support for a motion of no confidence in the Taoiseach, Charles Haughey. Then in 1992, Albert Reynolds became Taoiseach and Flynn was rewarded for supporting Reynolds by becoming Minister for Justice. In 1993, he retired from domestic politics when he was appointed Ireland's European Commissioner. He was reappointed by the Fine Gael-Labour Party government in 1995 and, on both of these occasions, served in the social affairs portfolio. The Late Late Show controversy On 15 January 1999, Flynn made comments on a live chat show (The Late Late Show) regarding Tom Gilmartin and a donation of IR¬£50,000 to the Fianna F√°il party. On the same programme, Flynn made comments about his own lifestyle (following a question by journalist Barry O'Halloran); he boasted of having a salary of IR¬£140,000 together with three houses, cars and housekeepers and travelled regularly, yet complained about the hassle involved. The performance was seen as eccentric and out of touch ‚Äì at a time when house prices were rising significantly. In effect, Flynn was interpreted as behaving in a manner more befitting the Irish stereotype known as the Dublin 4 mentality, complaining of the costs incurred in the pursuit of extravagance. The show's presenter Gay Byrne then asked Flynn if he knew of Gilmartin. Flynn responded that he knew him well. Flynn seemed to be making an attack of Gilmartin's emotional stability, based on the effect of sickness of Gilmartin's wife. If it was to be interpreted as an attack of Gilmartin's credibility, then it backfired in a spectacular manner against Flynn. Also, unknown to Flynn, Gilmartin was actually watching The Late Late Show on Tara Television at his home in Luton. This hurt Gilmartin a great deal, while also bringing the illness of his wife into the picture as the real driving force behind Gilmartin's testimony against Flynn. Gilmartin responded by releasing details of meetings he held with Flynn to the McCracken Tribunal. The interview is widely described as the end of Flynn's political career. Retirement from politics Flynn's second term as European Commissioner ended early in September 1999, when the entire commission resigned due to allegations of malpractice by the European Parliament. He was not reappointed to the commission and retired from politics completely. He is a member of the Comite d'Honneur of the Institute of International and European Affairs. Flynn's daughter Beverley Flynn is a former Fianna F√°il TD for the Mayo constituency. She was readmitted to the party on 8 April 2008, having previously been expelled after failing in a libel action against RT√â which claimed she was involved in selling bogus non- resident accounts to customers while she worked for National Irish Bank. He receives annual pension payments of ‚Ç¨87,129 from his time as a TD and Minister, but this does not include payments for his time as a European Commissioner. =Mahon Tribunal report= Flynn was cited in the Mahon Tribunal for having received money from Frank Dunlop intended for Fianna F√°il, but diverted to Flynn's personal use. On 22 March 2012, the final report of the Mahon Tribunal was published. It found that Flynn \\"wrongly and corruptly\\" sought a substantial donation from Tom Gilmartin for the Fianna F√°il party. It also found that having been paid IR¬£50,000 by Gilmartin, for that purpose, Flynn proceeded to use that money for his personal benefit, and that the donation funded at least a significant portion of the purchase of a farm in County Mayo. Flynn made his first public appearance since the publication of the Mahon Report by attending noon Mass in the Holy Rosary Church in Castlebar. =Resignation from Fianna F√°il= On 26 March 2012, facing expulsion following the Mahon Tribunal, Flynn resigned in disgrace from Fianna F√°il before he could be ousted.

As an advocate of Puerto Rican independence, she served as Secretary General of the Daughters of Freedom, the women's branch of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. She was also a civil rights activist for women and African/Afro-Caribbean writers. Early years Julia de Burgos (birth name: Julia Constanza Burgos Garc√≠a) was born to Francisco Burgos Hans (a farmer) and Paula Garc√≠a de Burgos. Her father was a member of the Puerto Rico National Guard and had a farm near the town of Carolina, Puerto Rico, where she was born. The family later moved to the barrio of Santa Cruz of the same city. She was the oldest of thirteen children. Six of her younger siblings died of malnutrition. Her first work was R√≠o Grande de Lo√≠za. After she graduated from Mu√±oz Rivera Primary School in 1928, her family moved to Rio Piedras where she was awarded a scholarship to attend University High School. In 1931, she enrolled in University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus to become a teacher. In 1933, de Burgos graduated at the age of 19 from the University of Puerto Rico with a degree in teaching. She became a teacher and taught at Feijoo Elementary School in Barrio Cedro Arriba of Naranjito, Puerto Rico. She also worked as writer for a children's program on public radio, but was reportedly fired for her political beliefs. Among her early influences were Luis Llor√©ns Torres, Mercedes Negr√≥n Mu√±oz a.k.a. \\"Clara Lair\\", Rafael Alberti and Pablo Neruda. According to de Burgos, \\"My childhood was all a poem in the river, and a river in the poem of my first dreams.\\" Nationalist In 1934, de Burgos married Ruben Rodriguez Beauchamp and ended her teaching career. In 1936, she became a member of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party (Partido Nacionalista de Puerto Rico) and was elected to the position of Secretary General of the Daughters of Freedom, the women's branch of the Nationalist Party. The Puerto Rican Nationalist Party was the independence party headed by Pedro Albizu Campos, a Puerto Rican Nationalist. She divorced her husband in 1937. Literature \\"R√≠o Grande de Lo√≠za! ... Great river. Great flood of tears ... save those greater that come from the eyes of my soul for my enslaved people\\" Julia de Burgos, \\"El Rio Grande de Loiza\\" By the early 1930s, de Burgos was already a published writer in journals and newspapers. She published three books which contained a collection of her poems. For her first two books, she traveled around the island promoting herself by giving book readings. Her third book was published posthumously in 1954. De Burgos' lyrical poems are a combination of the intimate, the land and the social struggle of the oppressed. Many critics assert that her poetry anticipated the work of feminist writers and poets as well as that of other Hispanic authors.Hispanic Heritage In one of her poems, she writes: \\"I am life, strength, woman.\\" De Burgos received awards and recognition for her work and was celebrated by poets including Pablo Neruda, whom she met in Cuba, and stated that her calling was to be one of the greatest poet of the Americas. Among de Burgos' works are: (My Death Poem), * (I Was My Own Path), * (Dawn of My Silence), * Later years Later in life, de Burgos became romantically involved with Dr. Juan Isidro Jimenes Grull√≥n, a Dominican physician. According to Grull√≥n, many of her poems during that time were inspired by the love that she felt for him. In 1939, de Burgos and Jimenes Grull√≥n traveled first to Cuba where she attended briefly the University of Havana and then later to New York City where she worked as a journalist for Pueblos Hispanos, a progressive newspaper. Shortly after their arrival in Cuba, de Burgos' relationship with Jimenes Grull√≥n began to show tension. After trying to save her relationship, she instead left and returned once again to New York, however this time alone, where she took menial jobs to support herself. In 1943, she married Armando Mar√≠n, a musician from Vieques. In 1947, the marriage also ended in divorce, lapsing de Burgos into further depression and alcoholism. In February 1953, she wrote one of her last poems, \\"Farewell in Welfare Island.\\"Julia de Burgos. Gale It was written during her last hospitalization and is believed by her peers to be one of the only poems she wrote in English. In the poem she foreshadows her death and reveals an ever darker concept of life. Death On June 28, 1953, de Burgos left the home of a relative in Brooklyn, where she had been residing. She disappeared without leaving a clue as to where she went. It was later discovered that on July 6, 1953, she collapsed on a sidewalk in the Spanish Harlem section of Manhattan, and later died of pneumonia at a hospital in Harlem at the age of 39. Since no one claimed her body and she had no identification on her, the city gave her a pauper's burial on Hart Island, the city's only potter's field. Eventually, some of her friends and relatives were able to trace her, find her grave, and claim her body. A committee was organized in Puerto Rico, presided over by Dr. Margot Arce de V√°zquez, to have her remains transferred to the island. De Burgos's remains arrived on September 6, 1953 and funeral services for her were held at the Puerto Rican Atheneum. She was given a hero's burial at the Municipal Cemetery of Carolina. A monument was later built at her burial site by the City of Carolina. Honors In 1986, the Spanish Department of the University of Puerto Rico posthumously honored de Burgos by granting her a doctorate in Human Arts and Letters.P√©rez Rosario, Vanessa (2014).

Puerto Rican poet Giannina Braschi, who was born the year of de Burgos' death, pays homage to her poetry and legend in the Spanglish novel Yo-Yo Boing! At Yale University, the Latino Cultural Center is named in her honor, La Casa Cultural Julia de Burgos. A documentary about the life of de Burgos was made in 2002 titled \\"Julia, Toda en mi ... \\" (Julia, All in me ... ) directed and produced by Ivonne Bel√©n. Another biopic about her life, \\"Vida y poes√≠a de Julia de Burgos,\\" was filmed and released in Puerto Rico in 1978. In New York City, the Julia de Burgos Cultural Center, on 106th Street and Lexington Avenue, is named after her. On September 14, 2010, in a ceremony held in San Juan, the United States Postal Service honored de Burgos' life and literary work with the issuance of a first class postage stamp, the 26th release in the postal system's Literary Arts series. The stamp's portrait was created by Toronto-based artist Jody Hewgill.Postal News: 2010 Stamp Program Unveiled from www.usps.com. December 30, 2010. In 2011, de Burgos was inducted into the New York Writers Hall of Fame. There is a plaque, located at the monument to the Jayuya Uprising participants in Mayag√ºez, Puerto Rico, honoring the women of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. De Burgos' name is on the sixth line of the third plate. Plaque honoring the women of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party On May 29, 2014, The Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico honored 12 illustrious women with plaques in the \\"La Plaza en Honor a la Mujer Puertorrique√±a\\" (Plaza in Honor of Puerto Rican Women) in San Juan. According to the plaques each of the 12 women, who by virtue of their merits and legacies, stand out in the history of Puerto Rico. De Burgos was among the 12 who were honored. In September 2017, artist-activist Molly Crabapple (herself of Puerto Rican descent) disbursed the profits of the sales of her portrait of de Burgos to the Puerto Rico Hurricane Maria Recovery Fund. The Giclee 17‚Ä≥ x 22‚Ä≥ print is captioned with one of the poet's most famous lines: \\"En todo me lo juego a ser lo que soy yo/I gamble everything to be what I am.\\" In 2018, the New York Times published a belated obituary for her.

Each season consists of 22 episodes, totaling 110 episodes over five seasons. The 100th episode (#512, Pride Before the Fall) contains 108 seconds of outtakes (many intentional) at the end as a \\"thank you\\" to the viewers. Series overview Episodes = Season 1 (2000‚Äì01) = Season one of the series shows Dylan Hunt assembling the crew and adjusting to the new universe, while pursuing the creation of the New Systems Commonwealth. The idea of the new Commonwealth proves unpopular; only 6 worlds actually sign the Commonwealth charter in this season. Major powers like the Than Hegemony or the Nietzschean Sabra and Jaguar prides are not really interested in the new Commonwealth; Dylan also manages to make quite a few enemies himself (including the most powerful of all Nietzschean Prides, Drago-Kazov). Dylan also encounters several dysfunctional remnants of the old High Guard and witnesses the consequences of some of his own actions 300 years before. He realizes that the old Commonwealth had made some mistakes, the repetition of which he has to avoid. The unification of Andromeda's crew is a major theme of season one. Dylan's new crew does not really believe in the idea of the Commonwealth, and joins him only for personal gain. To their surprise they find that having something to fight for is not a bad thing. In the season finale, Beka, Dylan's First Officer, even promises to continue his mission if he dies. Initially Trance seems to be a ditzy, naive girl, warm and compassionate but serving little actual purpose on the ship. She quickly demonstrates she is more than she seems. Trance has a strong ability to gauge probabilities in the fabric of space-time, which seems to others as if she could see the future. She describes it as seeing \\"all possible futures\\". She uses this ability several times to help her friends, but her true goals remain unknown. The show hints that she engineered the Battle of Witchhead, where the last remains of the old Commonwealth fleet were destroyed, taking most of the Nietzschean forces with them, by \\"accidentally\\" sending the Andromeda back in time and pulling various members of the crew by the right strings. Dylan himself has a difficult time accepting the fact that the universe he lived in no longer exists and all his friends are long dead. In a bizarre accident he actually manages to contact his fianc√©e, Sara Riley, 300 years before and even to teleport onto her ship - but returns alone, deciding the new Commonwealth is more important than his own life. In the season finale Andromeda encounters the Magog World ship, a huge structure of twenty connected planets and an artificial sun. The World ship contains trillions of Magog and is equipped with a powerful weapon - a point singularity projector, which creates miniature black holes. Andromeda is heavily damaged; Tyr and Harper are abducted to the World ship. Trying to rescue them, Rev Bem follows them to the World ship. The rest of the crew are badly injured. = Season 2 (2001‚Äì02) = Season two begins with the crew of Andromeda in a seemingly hopeless situation. Dylan and Trance are revived by Beka, and Dylan goes to the Magog World ship with Rommie (the android avatar of Andromeda's AI) to recover Tyr, Harper and Rev. Harper is infested with Magog eggs, and Rev's loyalty is strained when he encounters the being the Magog call the Spirit of the Abyss. They believe it to be their creator and god. Although Dylan and Rommie rescue Tyr and Harper, Andromeda is badly damaged, Rev has a spiritual crisis, and there seems to be no possible way to extract the Magog larvae from Harper. A powerful drug will keep them dormant for a time, but it only delays the inevitable. The season shows the crew reacting to the sudden necessity of the New Commonwealth after the discovery of the Worldship (which will arrive at the Known Worlds in a few years), as they continue to make sure the dream comes true. Many worlds became more willing to sign the charter after learning of the Worldship. Dylan becomes more ruthless in his actions as well. The episode \\"Ouroboros\\" (2:12) in the middle of this season became a major turning point for the whole series. \\"Ouroboros\\" was the last episode written solely by Robert Hewitt Wolfe, the show's original developer and head writer, though he returned a few episodes later to finish the writing job on \\"Dance of the Mayflies\\". The producers allegedly felt that the series was becoming too intellectual and complicated (see departure from the show). One immediately visible change was Trance's transformation. She exchanged places with her own future version; New Trance had a different (golden-skinned) appearance and much more serious personality. Behind the scenes, Brent Stait (Rev Bem) also left Andromeda in \\"Ouroboros\\" due to exhaustion. He clarified in an interview \\"I was chemically burned once but that was not due to allergy. The suit was combination of Yak hair and synthetic, I believe, and it was very very hot. The Latex was thick, covered my head and neck completely and the days on set were very long... I just woke up one morning and that was it. I couldn't put that suit on again. I was physically spent.\\" He reprises his role twice later, in seasons three and four. Ethlie Ann Vare, another writer, rounds out the list of people who departed the show in this season. In the second half of season two, restoration of the Systems Commonwealth becomes a much less significant theme. The show mostly concentrated on Star Trek-style standalone adventures. However, by the end of the season, the new Commonwealth had gained a new powerful war fleet and a total of fifty worlds. This period also saw Kevin Sorbo reunited with his Hercules co-star Michael Hurst for one episode. Andromeda's Nietzschean crewman, Tyr Anasazi, is revealed to have a son, Tamerlane Anasazi, who is a genetic reincarnation of Drago Museveni, Founder and Progenitor of the entire Nietzschean Race. Since all the Nietzschean Prides believe that Drago Museveni's genetic reincarnation will necessarily be a great leader, the Nietzschean Messiah, Tyr Anasazi gets a unique opportunity to unite all the Nietzschean Prides. He does not use it yet, biding his time. In the season finale, the Systems Commonwealth is finally reinstated. A ceremony is held on board of the Andromeda, but interrupted by the attack of unknown extra-dimensional aliens. = Season 3 (2002‚Äì03) = For season 3, Bob Engels was brought on the writing staff to fill the hole in that had been left by the departure of Robert Hewitt Wolfe and Ethlie Ann Vare. This season had the most episodic format of all. The Systems Commonwealth is already reunited, but there is not much progress in the fight with the Magog and the Abyss. Several episodes of season three explore Trance and her actual role. One episode (The Dark Backward) is filmed completely from Trance's viewpoint, showing that she indeed \\"lives\\" through all possible alternate futures before choosing the right one. Nietzschean crewman Tyr Anasazi makes his move at the end of the season. He implants his son Tamerlane Anasazi 's DNA into his own cells, and goes on to reunite the various Nietzschean Prides and separate them from the Systems Commonwealth again. The season ends with Nietzscheans withdrawing from the Commonwealth and Tyr Anasazi formally leaving the Andromeda. = Season 4 (2003‚Äì04) = Season 4 marked an extreme change in the writing staff. The writing team of Zack Stentz & Ashley Edward Miller, who had been with the show from the beginning and written more episodes of Season 3 than anyone else, did not return for season 4. The writing team of Matt Kiene & Joe Reinkemeyer, who had also been with the show from the beginning and who had written almost as many season 3 episodes as Zack and Ash, also did not return for season 4, though Kiene did write a single episode on his own. The weight was mostly taken up by new writers: Larry and Paul Barber, who had no previous involvement with the show, wrote the bulk of Season 4. Other newcomers included Ted Mann, Scott Frost, John Kirk, and Lawrence Meyers, and the team of Lu Abbott & Stacey Berman-Woodward, none of whom contributed more than one episode. Naomi Janzen, who had only written a single episode in the show's first three seasons put together, wrote four episodes in season 4. Dylan is nearly outlawed by the Systems Commonwealth he restored. The Collectors (originally keepers of historical information unknown to anyone else), allied with the Spirit of the Abyss, manipulate the fragile government of the New Commonwealth to show him in a bad light. The Abyss infiltrates the Commonwealth using many other agents as well. Eventually the Collectors unite with Tyr Anasazi and his newly united Nietzschean Prides. Tyr mistrusts the Spirit of the Abyss, and hopes to defeat it. He tries to find a map to the Route of Ages, a portal connecting all galaxies together. It is possible to weaken the Abyss by passing through it. Dylan gets the map instead but he allows Tyr to follow Andromeda through the Route of Ages as Tyr knows more about the Abyss. Andromeda is transported into a weird universe where thoughts manifest as reality. With Trance's help, Dylan defeats and kills Tyr who tried to make a deal with the Abyss. Since the Route of Ages closes before the Andromeda can return, Dylan has to use Trance's help. She reveals that she is the Avatar of the Sun, with \\"the power to create and destroy\\". Trance destroys Andromeda and re-creates it in the right universe. In this season, Dylan also finds a new crew member ‚Äî Nietzschean Telemachus Rhade, who does not accept his race's betrayal of the Commonwealth and agrees to join Dylan. Rhade proves to be more manageable than Tyr Anasazi, whom he helped Dylan defeat. The Magog evolve and become more intelligent and cunning. In the season finale their Worldship is rediscovered. It is heading towards the Arkology, an old space station with a pacifist population. Dylan frantically tries to convince them that they have to defend themselves but the people of the Arkology hope to make peace with the Magog. They pay dearly for that mistake, as the Magog never make peace with anyone. Andromeda tries to defend the Arkology against the Worldship, but is horribly outnumbered. The Arkology is destroyed with all its inhabitants. Rhade, Beka and Harper are left in absolutely hopeless situations. Rommie explodes after being shot through her stomach while saving Harper from the Magog. Trance asks Dylan to escape on a slip fighter through the Route of Ages, claiming that now there is nothing more important than saving his life; Marlowe, Arkology's leader (who had disappeared several hours before the battle) tells Dylan that they both are Paradine, two of the few ancient beings with incredible powers. Dylan reluctantly leaves through the Route (in a strange sequence where he finds himself in a large dark room and seemingly meets another version of himself). Trance turns into a sun and crashes into the Worldship on the Andromeda. = Season 5 (2004‚Äì05) = Season five of the series shows Dylan Hunt re-assembling the crew and adjusting Seefra system and his newly discovered role as a Paradine. Dylan finds himself transported into the Seefra system ‚Äî nine identical barren worlds with a superstitious population and two dim suns. Technology (especially spaceflight) is shunned, and water is treasured because of constant drought. Flavin, a Paradine, meets Dylan here, giving him cryptic hints about Dylan's destiny and what Seefra is before disappearing. Dylan eventually finds Nietzschean warrior Telemachus Rhade, pilot Beka Valentine and super-genius engineer Seamus Harper on Seefra, and to his amazement, they all arrived in Seefra at different times and locations. Harper, in particular, arrived three years earlier with the remains of the android Rommie. He tried to repair her but failed, eventually building another android, Doyle, with some of Rommie's memories. Initially he convinces her that she is human, but later her true identity is revealed by a rebel android. (The \\"behind the scenes\\" reason for replacing Rommie with Doyle is Lexa Doig's pregnancy. Rommie was rebuilt by Doyle late in this season.) Trance is also found, but she is weakened by her attempt to transport Andromeda and its crew to Seefra. She does not quite remember who she is and what she is supposed to do. Trance underwent a metamorphosis yet again; she is still golden-skinned but appears younger, and her personality resembles her first purple incarnation. Andromeda itself is transported to Seefra as well, but it has no power and no way to restore it. Trance partially recharges the ships generators, but Andromeda still cannot move (apparently it needs 100 percent power), and its AI behavior is erratic. The first half of the season deals with three main themes: Dylan's conflict with his crew, his attempts to restore Andromeda's power and eventual discovery of the true role of Trance and the Seefra system. Rhade, Beka and Harper are all angry at Dylan for leaving them behind in the Battle of Arkology and for throwing them to Seefra without any way to get back to the Known Worlds. Their loyalty is strained several times, but seems finally reaffirmed after the intervention by Stranger, a Paradine sent by Dylan from an alternate future. Andromeda's power is eventually restored with ancient Vedran artifacts, but it is still unable to leave Seefra. Seefra seems to be located in a \\"pocket universe,\\" and the only way out is the Route of Ages. Although some characters come and leave through it, Dylan cannot use it. Seefra turns out to be Tarn-Vedra, long lost capital of the Commonwealth, but the Vedrans themselves left it long ago, disillusioned with humans. Seefra-1 is the original Tarn-Vedra and Seefra-2 to 9 are copies of it. Tarn-Vedra's original sun was somehow replaced by two artificial constructs, Methus-1 and Methus-2. Methus-2 is now damaged and emits deadly flares, which are the reason for Seefra's drought. Methus Diagram ‚Äî a blueprint for Seefra system, recovered with the help of the mysterious DJ Virgil Vox ‚Äî also reveals the purpose of the eight extra planets. The Vedran sun will return someday, and destroy Seefra-2 through 9 to slow down and take its position. But because of the damage to Methus-2 this mechanism is not working, and the sun threatens to devastate the system completely. The second half of the season builds to major revelations and solutions. In the 100th episode of the series, the crew meet up with Peter, who they eventually deduce will become Drago Musevini, the progenitor of the Nietzschean race. He and Beka have a sexual tryst, after which he takes samples of Beka's DNA to mix with his own to create their children, applying bioengineering and nanobot technology to these offspring to create the Nietzschean race. This makes Beka their Alpha Matriarch, and an instrumental part of the history of the Systems Commonwealth. Peter exits through the Route of Ages to an earlier time, so that the new race will have already existed for 16 generations when the 1st episode happens. The episode also sees Andromeda restored to full power. Trance remembers her identity when she meets Ione, avatar of the Tarn-Vedra moon. She is the Tarn-Vedra sun. When she realizes this, her sun enters the Seefra system, and Dylan has to find a way to fix Methus-2 and evacuate eight doomed planets to Seefra-1. Trance's \\"sisters\\" (who call themselves \\"the Nebula\\"), however, try to persuade her to join them. In their opinion the fate of Dylan, Seefra, or the Known Worlds is irrelevant. Trance stubbornly refuses, and the Nebula imprisons her inside Methus-2, replacing her with Bad Trance (all Avatars of the Suns look alike). It takes some time for Dylan to realize the deception and rescue the real Trance. Dylan proceeds with the evacuation of the Seefra planets, although his plans are hindered by General Burma, a religious leader from Seefra-5. Burma is later revealed to be under the control of the Abyss. In a confrontation with Burma and Evil Trance, Dylan and Beka kill Burma and Trance drives off her evil counterpart. In the series finale, the Vedran sun is back in place and people are safe on Seefra-1. Trance then contacts the Nebula ‚Äî the Lambent Kith Nebula, supreme council of the galaxies which includes fifty Avatars. Trance was once the oldest member of the Nebula, but disagreed with their views of organic life as something insignificant and left long ago. Together with Dylan she appeals to the Nebula and its leader Maura, who plans to destroy the Abyss by expanding the All Forces Nullification Point until it consumes all galaxies. This incidentally will destroy everything alive in existence; only Seefra will survive. Maura refuses to reconsider their plans, but allows Dylan and the Andromeda to return to the Known Worlds. When the Andromeda slipstreams to Tarazed, Dylan finds out that only four days have passed since the Battle of Arkology, and the Magog Worldship is crippled but still operational. Rhade reunites with his wife (only to return to the Andromeda shortly). Andromeda visits Earth (where Harper secretly plans to stay), but as soon as the ship arrives in the system, the planet is promptly destroyed by the Abyss. A huge Nietzschean fleet emerges from behind the debris, and Andromeda barely escapes. Dylan begins to suspect Maura's motives and soon realizes she is the avatar of the Abyss and that all of the Nebula were under its control. Maura had destroyed all Paradines (except Dylan). Trance has Dylan take Andromeda back to Seefra and the Abyss destroys Maura for her failure. At Seefra, Evil Trance returns and reveals herself to be the mysterious Virgil Vox, but Dylan is able to distinguish the real Trance from her counterpart and kills Vox. After a massive battle with the Nietzscheans of the Drago-Kazov Pride, Dylan checks the Methus Diagram once again and discovers that Trance's sun is capable of destroying the Abyss. Andromeda returns to Seefra through the Route of Ages, followed by the Abyss. Trance manages to pull her sun closer and plunge it into the Abyss, burning it. The Abyss is finally destroyed, and Dylan's battle is over. The Route of Ages transforms into a slipstream portal, allowing the Commonwealth fleet to return to Tarn-Vedra.

List of episodes Andromeda ","title":"List of Andromeda episodes"},{"id":"299309","text":"Theatrical constraints are various rules, either of taste or of law, that govern the production, staging, and content of stage plays in the theater. Whether imposed externally, by virtue of monopoly franchises or censorship laws, or whether imposed voluntarily by actors, directors, or producers, these restraints have taxed the creative minds of the theatre to tackle the challenges of working with and around them. The Classical unities, requiring \\"unity\\" of \\"time, place, and subject\\", is the most well-known of all theatrical constraints. It was first employed in Italy in 1514 and later became embraced in France. Another example is the Japanese prohibition of female acting in 1625, then the prohibition of young male actors in 1657, that create \\"Onnagata\\" which is the ground of Japanese theatrical tradition. In the Elizabethan theatre of Shakespeare, a similar ban forbade all actresses from appearing on stage, at all; the parts of women were generally played by boys. The plot of Shakespeare in Love turns on this fact. In cinema, the Dogme 95 films form a body of work produced under voluntary constraints that severely limit both the choice of subjects and the choice of techniques used to bring them to the screen. Another culturally significant constraint occurred in France. In the late seventeenth century (1697 to be exact), Italian companies were prohibited from appearing in France, so native actors ‚Äì strolling players going from fairground to fairground, market place to market place ‚Äì took over the Italian plays and made the roles their own with great success. But this aroused the jealousy of the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise which decided to outlaw all spoken dialogue except in its own theatre. To overcome this, the travelling players divided their plays into soliloquies and performed nothing but monologues ‚Äì which brought them even greater success than previously. One actor would say his lines, run off into the wings, while another appeared in order to reply. He would then go off in his turn, allowing the first one to come back and reply, and so on and so forth. After this, the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise declared that they alone had the right to use speech on stage. Consequently, the public theatre found its way round this by using song instead of speech ‚Äì and this is how French Operetta came into being. But then the Academy of Music proclaimed that they alone should be given the right to sing! So in the markets and fairgrounds the itinerant actors created a new theatrical form by holding up cue-cards (like sub-titles or karaoke) containing the words of the plays or songs, which the audience then acted or sang for them. This became even more successful, with crowds coming from all around to see how the actors had overcome such rigid censorship. Some of the restrictions, or traditions born of them, may have still been in place in the nineteenth century, at least if Marcel Carn√©'s Les Enfants du Paradis is a reliable guide. This also explains why France has given the world so many mimes.

A member of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), he was the first president to be elected after the reunification of Germany. He previously served as a judge of the Federal Constitutional Court, and he was the President of the court 1987‚Äì1994. Before his appointment as a judge he was a professor of law. He received the 1997 Charlemagne Prize. Early life and academic career Roman Herzog was born in Landshut, Bavaria, Germany, in 1934 to a Protestant family. His father was an archivist. He studied law in Munich and passed his state law examination. He completed his doctoral studies in 1958 with a dissertation on Basic Law and the European Convention on Human Rights. He worked as an assistant at the University of Munich until 1964, where he also passed his second juristic state exam. For his paper Die Wesensmerkmale der Staatsorganisation in rechtlicher und entwicklungsgeschichtlicher Sicht (\\"Characteristics of state organization from a juristic and developmental- historical viewpoint\\"), he was awarded the title of professor in 1964, and taught at the University of Munich until 1966. He then taught constitutional law and political science as a full professor at the Free University of Berlin. It was during this period that he coedited a commentary of the Basic Law. In 1969, he accepted a chair of public law at the German University of Administrative Sciences in Speyer, serving as university president in 1971‚Äì72. Political career Election poster for the state election of Rhineland- Palatinate with Roman Herzog, 1975 Herzog's political career began in 1973, as a representative of the state (Land) of Rhineland-Palatinate in the Federal government in Bonn. He served as State Minister for Culture and Sports in the Baden-W√ºrttemberg State Government led by Minister-President Lothar Sp√§th from 1978. In 1980 he was elected to the Landtag of Baden-W√ºrttemberg and took over the State Ministry of the Interior.Werner Filmer, Heribert Schwan: Roman Herzog ‚Äì Die Biographie. Goldmann, Munich 1996, . As the regional interior minister, he attracted attention when he imposed a levy on nonapproved demonstrations and his proposal for the police to be equipped with rubber- bullet guns. Herzog was long active in the Evangelical Church in Germany. Until 1980, he was head of the Chamber for Public Responsibility of this church, and, beginning in 1982, he was a member of the synod. In 1983 Herzog was elected a judge at the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany (Bundesverfassungsgericht) in Karlsruhe, replacing Ernst Benda. From 1987 until 1994, he also served as the president of the Court, this time replacing Wolfgang Zeidler. In September 1994, he was succeeded in that office by Jutta Limbach. =President of Germany, 1994‚Äì1999= Already in 1993, Chancellor Helmut Kohl had selected Herzog as candidate for the 1994 presidential election, after his previous choice, the Saxon State Minister of Justice, Steffen Heitmann, had to withdraw because of an uproar about statements he made on the German past, ethnic conflict and the role of women.Craig R. Whitney (1 May 1994), German Coalition Is Divided Over Kohl's Choice for President New York Times. By early 1994, however, leaders of the Free Democrats, the junior members of Kohl's coalition government, expressed support for Johannes Rau, the candidate whom the opposition Social Democrats nominated. German media also speculated that other potential candidates included Kurt Masur and Walther Leisler Kiep. The former Foreign Minister, Hans Dietrich Genscher refused to run.Craig R. Whitney (6 March 1994), Germans Campaign In President Race New York Times. Herzog was elected President of Germany by the Federal Assembly (Bundesversammlung) on 23 May 1994. In the decisive third round of voting, he won the support of the Free Democrats.Stephen Kinzer (24 May 1994), Kohl's Choice Is Named German President New York Times. Their decision was taken as a sign that the coalition remained firm. Herzog took office as Federal President on 1 July 1994. He participated in the commemorations of the 50th anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising during the Nazi occupation of Poland in 1994. In a widely commended speech, he paid tribute to the Polish fighters and people and asked Poles for \\"forgiveness for what has been done to you by the Germans\\".. In the speech, he strongly emphasized the enormity of anguish the Polish people suffered through Nazi Germany but he also made an indirect reference to the sufferings that the Germans experienced in World War II. In 1995, Herzog was one of the few foreign dignitaries taking part in the observances on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp who chose to attend a Jewish service at the site of the camp rather than the official opening ceremony in Cracow sponsored by the Polish Government.Stephen Kinzer (28 January 1995), Germans Reflect on Meaning of Auschwitz New York Times. In January 1996, Herzog declared 27 January, the anniversary of the 1945 liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp, as Germany's official day of remembrance for the victims of Hitler's regime.Germany Observes Holocaust Memorial Day Los Angeles Times, 28 January 1996. in late 1997, in a major step for Germany officially recognizing the murder and suffering of the Roma and Sinti under the Nazis, he said that the persecution of the Roma and Sinti was the same as the terror against the Jews.Catherine Hickley (24 October 2012), Holocaust Memorial for Roma, Sinti Opens After Delays Bloomberg News. In April 1997, Herzog caused a nationwide controversy when, in a speech given at the Hotel Adlon in Berlin, he portrayed Germany as dangerously delaying social and economic changes. In the speech, he rebuked leaders for legislative gridlock and decried a sense of national \\"dejection,\\" a \\"feeling of paralysis\\" and even an \\"unbelievable mental depression.\\" Compared with what he called the more innovative economies of Asia and America, he said that Germany was \\"threatened with falling behind.\\"John Schmid (30 April 1997), German President's Lament Rejected: Much Distress in Europe Over Talk, Talk, Talk International Herald Tribune. In November 1998, Herzog's office formally moved to Berlin, becoming the first federal agency to shift from Bonn to the redesignated capital city.Christopher S. Wren (24 November 1998), Germany: President Moves To Berlin New York Times. He retained his position until 30 June 1999 and did not seek reelection. At the end of his five-year term as head of state, he was succeeded by Johannes Rau. =Post-presidency= From December 1999 to October 2000, Herzog chaired the European Convention which drafted the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In January‚ÄìMarch 2000, with former central bank President Hans Tietmeyer and former federal judge Paul Kirchhof, Herzog led an independent commission to investigate a financing scandal affecting the CDU.Kohl's Party Names Panel in Funds Probe Los Angeles Times, 15 January 2000. Amid a German debate over the ethics of research in biotechnology and in particular the use of embryos for genetic inquiry and diagnosis, Herzog argued in 2001 that an absolute ban on research on embryonic stem cells ‚Äì which have the ability to develop into the body's different tissues ‚Äì would be excessive, stating: \\"I am not prepared to explain to a child sick with cystic fibrosis, facing death and fighting for breath, the ethical grounds that hinder the science which could save him\\".Roger Cohen (30 May 2001), Clash on Use of Embryos in Germany Stirs Echoes of Nazi Era New York Times. In response to Chancellor Gerhard Schr√∂der's \\"Agenda 2010\\" presented in 2003, the then-opposition leader and CDU chair Angela Merkel assigned the task of drafting alternative proposals for social welfare reform to a commission led by Herzog. The party later approved the Herzog Commission's package of reform proposals, whose recommendations included decoupling health and nursing care premiums from people's earnings and levying a lump monthly sum across the board instead.German Opposition Split Over Reforms Deutsche Welle, 8 October 2003.

A member of the Free Democratic Party of Germany (FDP), he first served in government as Federal Minister of Economic Cooperation and Development from 1961‚Äì66. He led the FDP from 1968‚Äì74. During the Chancellorship of Willy Brandt, Scheel was Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs and Vice Chancellor. Scheel became Acting Chancellor of West Germany from 7‚Äì16 May 1974 following Brandt's resignation after the Guillaume Affair. He was elected shortly after as President, remaining in the role until 1979. Scheel was a member of the Evangelical Church in Germany. Early life Scheel was born in Solingen (now in North Rhine-Westphalia). He completed his Abitur at the Reformrealgymnsasium Schwertstra√üe. Scheel became a member of the Nazi Party in 1942.Geschichte und Politik in den Reden der deutschen Bundespr√§sidenten 1949-1984, Matthias Rensing,p. 152 During World War II, he served in the Luftwaffe during the last years of the war as a radar operator on a Bf 110 night fighter. Political career When his Free Democratic Party reentered government in a coalition with Konrad Adenauer's Christian Democratic Union in 1961, Scheel was appointed federal minister of economic cooperation and development. He continued in that office under Chancellor Ludwig Erhard but brought about the downfall of the latter in late 1966 by resigning. A Christian Democratic/Social Democratic Grand Coalition followed. During this time, in 1968, Scheel took over the party presidency from right wing liberal Erich Mende. According to one study, the election of Walter Scheel to the FDP leadership in 1968 ‚Äúrepresented a turn to the left and the Free Democrats then indicated their wooing of the SPD by voting for the successful Social Democratic candidate for the Presidency of the Republic, Gustav Heinemann, in 1969.‚Äù In 1969, he led his party to form a new coalition with the Social Democrats. Under Chancellor Willy Brandt, Scheel became Foreign Minister and Vice Chancellor. Under their leadership, West Germany pursued a course of rapprochement and d√©tente with the Soviet block and officially recognized the existence of the German Democratic Republic (GDR). This policy caused a massive public debate, with various Free and Social Democrats switching sides to the opposition. Though an attempt to oust Brandt failed, the coalition had lost its slender majority. The parliamentary stalemate was ended by the dissolution of parliament and early elections in 1972, which brought great gains for the Social Democrats and enabled the coalition to continue. Henry Kissinger believed he was \\"an idiot\\" and a \\"bad\\" foreign minister. On 7 May 1974, Brandt resigned as Chancellor after one of his aides, G√ºnter Guillaume, was arrested as a spy for the East German state. Though this had been internally suspected since 1973, Brandt accepted responsibility and resigned. Scheel, as acting chancellor, chaired the government meetings for a little over a week, until Helmut Schmidt was elected. Hans Dietrich Genscher became Scheel's successor as party chairman and as minister. Scheel with Jimmy Carter, 1978 Scheel was elected President of West Germany, a week after relinquishing his other government roles. He held the office from July 1974 until June 1979. At the funeral of Hanns Martin Schleyer in October 1977, Scheel gave a speech entitled shame. After the federal presidency, Scheel was Chairman of the Bilderberg Conference as well as President of the European Movement in Germany from 1980-85. From 1980-89 he was also President of the German section of the Union of European Federalists (UEF). He was named honorary chairman of the Friedrich Naumann Foundation in 1991. Death Scheel died on 24 August 2016 following a long illness. Having lived to he holds the record as the longest-lived German head of state, either imperial or elected.

Prior to his presidency he served as Federal Minister for Agriculture. Besides agriculture he was interested in the state of developing countries. The moderate conservative suffered from deteriorating health towards the end of his career, and is known for a series of embarrassing incidents that may have resulted from his health issues. L√ºbke resigned three months before the scheduled end of his second term. Biography L√ºbke with fifth Adenauer cabinet L√ºbke with President of Kenya Jomo Kenyatta and his son Uhuru Born in Enkhausen, Westphalia, L√ºbke had a very humble upbringing. He was the son of a shoemaker and farmer from the Sauerland, and was a surveyor by training.Die Zeit: \\"Der Fall L√ºbke\\" (The L√ºbke Case) (2007, in German) He volunteered for service in World War I, reaching the rank of lieutenant. After working from 1923 as an officer of a pressure group representing the interests of small-scale farmers in Berlin, in 1930 he became a member of the Roman Catholic Centre Party (Zentrumspartei) and in April 1932 was elected as a member of the Prussian Parliament. After the seizure of power by the National Socialists in 1933 and the subsequent dissolution of the Zentrumspartei, L√ºbke was accused of misappropriating public funds and imprisoned; after 20 months in prison he was released, when no evidence could be produced to back up the politically motivated charges. It was not until 1937 that he was able to get a senior position with a building society (German: Wohnungsbaugesellschaft). In 1939, just before the outbreak of World War II, he moved to a company of building engineers managed by the architect Walter Schlempp. Here he came to the notice of Albert Speer and was given responsibility for major building projects, some of which were under the aegis of the Armaments Ministry run by Speer. One of these was the extension of the 'Army Research Center Peenem√ºnde' (Heeresversuchsanstalt Peenem√ºnde in German, abbreviated HVP) and the 'Air Force Test Centre' (Erprobungsstelle der Luftwaffe in German), Peenem√ºnde- West. After the war, L√ºbke returned to his career in politics, becoming a member of the West German CDU party, being appointed Minister of Agriculture in the state parliament of North Rhine-Westphalia in 1947. In 1953 Konrad Adenauer appointed him to his cabinet as Federal Minister of Agriculture in Bonn. Definitive stamp during his term L√ºbke was chosen by Adenauer as a candidate for the largely ceremonial post of president to ensure that Adenauer's political schemes were not disturbed by too strong a personality in this position, which is nominally the highest post in the German state. L√ºbke defeated Carlo Schmid, the SPD candidate, and Max Becker, the FDP candidate for the presidency, in the second round of voting in 1959. L√ºbke's status as a one-time political prisoner under the National Socialists placed him in good stead, and it was not until 1966 that accusations started to be made by sources in the GDR that he had at the very least been aware of the use of slave labour on his projects; building plans bearing his signature and containing concentration camp barrack blocks were advanced as evidence of his complicity, but these were dismissed in the West as East German propaganda. Nevertheless, the potential scandal threatened to damage the office of the Federal President; in 1968 L√ºbke announced that he would resign the following year, his resignation taking effect three months before the scheduled end of his term of office. The former president's health deteriorated. His intention to live in West Berlin from time to time could not be realized, nor could he, with his private library of about 5,000 books, pursue his scientific hobbies in comparative linguistics and microbiology. L√ºbke's political friends ignored him, if they did not avoid him. His successor in the presidency, Gustav Heinemann, however, kept in contact with him. Trips to Tenerife in the fall of 1969 and at Christmas in 1970 and 1971 brought no improvement in his condition. Progressive cerebral sclerosis was becoming increasingly noticeable, leading to serious speech disorders and progressive memory loss. In retrospect, it became clear that this disease had started several years earlier and explained many aspects of the West German president's behavior during his last years in office. In November 1971, the former president visited his birthplace in Enkhausen for the last time. On 30 March 1972, acute stomach bleeding required an emergency operation. It turned out that he was suffering from a very advanced stomach cancer which had already metastasized to the brain. After two more bleedings L√ºbke died on 6 April 1972 at the age of 77 in Bonn. As a speaker L√ºbke was a poor public speaker and was frequently subject to ridicule, especially near the end of his term of office when his age and his failing health started to affect his memory. He frequently forgot where he was (L√ºbke: \\"When I talk to you today in...eh... in..\\" Voice from the crowd shouting: \\"Helmstedt!\\" L√ºbke: \\"...eh...when I talk to you today in ... Helmstedt, then it was following my own will...\\", etc.). This was further ridiculed in the German translation of Danger Mouse, where Penfold is called \\"L√ºbke\\" and is frequently ordered to \\"shut up\\" (\\"L√ºbke, Schnauze!\\"). Various other slips are well documented, such as the address in Antananarivo, Madagascar: \\"My very dear Mr. President, dear Mrs. Tananarive...\\"Die Zeit: L√ºbke und die Neger (2002, in German) His word-for- word translations of German into English (see L√ºbke English) were also the subject of much mockery. Tapes from L√ºbke's speeches were collected by the German satirical magazine Pardon and distributed on a best-selling record.

His cordial nature ‚Äì something of a contrast to the stern character of chancellor Konrad Adenauer ‚Äì largely contributed to the stabilization of democracy in West Germany during the Wirtschaftswunder years. Before beginning his career as a politician, Heuss had been a political journalist. Early life and education Heuss was born in Brackenheim, a small town and wine-making community near Heilbronn in W√ºrttemberg, on the border between the historic regions of Swabia and Franconia. He attended the Karlsgymnasium in Heilbronn, from which he graduated in 1902. This selective secondary school has since been renamed the Theodor-Heuss-Gymnasium, in honor of its famous alumnus. Heuss studied economics, art history and political science at the universities of Munich and Berlin. He received his doctorate at Munich, with Lujo Brentano as his thesis adviser, in 1905. He also became a student of Friedrich Naumann, a German politician and theologian. On 11 April 1908, he married Elly Heuss-Knapp (1881‚Äì1952), with whom he had a son. The minister at the Lutheran wedding ceremony held in Stra√üburg was Albert Schweitzer, a close friend of Elly's. Personal life Heuss was a member of the Evangelical Church in Germany. Career After his studies Heuss worked as a political journalist in Berlin and from 1905 until 1912 presided over the magazine Die Hilfe (\\"The Aid\\") published by Friedrich Naumann. From 1912 to 1918, he was editor in chief of the Neckarzeitung (Neckar Newspaper) in Heilbronn. In Berlin, he worked as editor for the weekly newsletter Deutsche Politik (\\"German Politics\\"). With Naumann, Heuss in 1903 he joined the liberal Free-minded Union, which in 1910 merged in the Progressive People's Party (Fortschrittliche Volkspartei), in which he was engaged until its dissolution in 1918. After World War I, Heuss between 1923 and 1926 published the magazine Die Deutsche Nation (\\"The German Nation\\"). He had become a member of the German Democratic Party (Deutsche Demokratische Partei, DDP), from 1930 renamed German State Party (Deutsche Staatspartei, DStP), the political heir of the Fortschrittliche Volkspartei in 1918 and was a member of the Reichstag parliament from 1924 to 1928 and again from 1930 to 1933. =Nazi Germany= On 23 March 1933, along with his four fellow DStP parliamentarians, Heuss voted in favour of the Enabling Act (Erm√§chtigungsgesetz), granting Chancellor Adolf Hitler quasi-dictatorial powers.Official Record of the Reichstag Bavarian State Library, 23 March 1933, last access: 27 November 2017. He had set out to abstain, but after Heinrich Br√ºning indicated that with regard to the Reichskonkordat the Centre Party MPs would assent, ultimately subordinated to party discipline.Information on the webpage of the German foundation 'Stiftung Bundespr√§sident-Theodor-Heuss-Haus' (Foundation Federal President Theodor Heuss House) Alternative views of Hermann Dietrich, Weimar Republic finance minister claim that he was part of the majority in favor of voting for the enabling law.Hjamar Schacht. The Magic of Money, London: Oldbourne, 1967, p.105 When Germany became a one-party state, the DStP was dissolved on 28 June 1933 and Heuss was divested of his Reichstag mandate by decree of Minister of the Interior Wilhelm Frick with effect from 8 July. Following the end of his term he returned to private life. During the Third Reich he stayed in contact with a network of liberals, leading to contacts with the German resistance towards the end of the war, though he was not an active resister. In 1936 Heuss faced a publication ban, nevertheless in 1941 he became an employee of the Frankfurter Zeitung, one of the few remaining liberal newspapers at that time. Heuss wrote under pseudonyms until publishing of the paper was finally prohibited in 1943. He spent the following years writing a biography of Robert Bosch. Heuss was a contributor to the Nazi newspaper Das Reich, launched by Joseph Goebbels as a more erudite version of the crude antisemitism promulgated by Nazi publications. =Postwar= After World War II the US Office of Military Government on 24 September 1945 appointed Heuss the first Minister of Education and Cultural Affairs in the German state of W√ºrttemberg- Baden under his fellow party member Minister-president Reinhold Maier, in favour of whom he resigned in 1946. As a co-founder of the Democratic People's Party (Demokratische Volkspartei, DVP), the predecessor of the German Free Democratic Party (Freie Demokratische Partei, FDP) in the southwestern German states, he was a member of the W√ºrttemberg-Baden state parliament (Landtag) from 1946 to 1949. Heuss also taught history at the Stuttgart Institute of Technology in 1946 and 1947, receiving the title of an honorary professor in 1948. After plans elaborated with Wilhelm K√ºlz to build up an all-German liberal party had failed, Heuss in December 1948 was elected head of West German and Berlin sections of the newly founded Free Democratic Party. He advocated uniting all liberal parties in the Western occupation zones, overcoming the split between right liberals and left liberals that had existed in the Weimar Republic. In 1948, he was a member of the Parlamentarischer Rat (Parliamentary Council) at Bonn with considerable influence in the drafting of West Germany's constitution, the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany. Presidency Heuss with King Paul of Greece and Mayor Pafsanias Katsotas in Athens in May 1956. After being elected to the first German Bundestag, he relinquished his parliamentary mandate on 12 September 1949, when he was elected President by the Federal Convention (Bundesversammlung) defeating the Social Democrat leader Kurt Schumacher in the second ballot. He took the oath required by article 56 of the Basic Law before a joint session of the Bundestag and the Bundesrat on the same date. By the time he was confirmed as the first democratic German president since Paul von Hindenburg, he refused to be called ‚ÄúExcellency‚Äù, preferring instead to be called simply ‚ÄúHerr Heuss‚Äù,GERMANY: Out by the Kitchen. TIME Magazine, 26 September 1949 Herr Bundespr√§sident is the German term of address up to today. Heuss's plans for a new national anthem were aborted by Adenauer, who - in rare accordance with Kurt Schumacher - had the third stanza of the old Deutschlandlied established in 1952. A widower since 1952, Heuss was re-elected in 1954 with practically no opposition, after the Social Democrats had renounced the nomination of a rival candidate. Not until May 1956, could he make his first state visit, invited by King Paul of Greece. The president, accompanied by Foreign Minister Heinrich von Brentano, was overwhelmed by the warm reception in Athens, considering that the country had heavily suffered under German occupation in World War II. He held office until the end of his term on 12 September 1959, succeeded by Heinrich L√ºbke. He had declined a third term in office, as this would have necessitated changing the constitution. Adenauer and Heuss on 14 September 1959. Heuss shaped the office of president by his non-partisan governing. As a representative of the democratic-liberal and cultural traditions of Germany, he was a symbol of confidence in the German post-war republic in the international community. His further state visits to Turkey, Italy, Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom contributed greatly to the increase of appreciation toward the still young Federal Republic of Germany. He was opposed to re-armament and the founding of the new West German Army in 1955, but had no power to stop it. His ironic speech at the swearing in of the first new soldiers, \\"Nun siegt mal sch√∂n!\\" (\\"Happy war- winning!\\"), is well remembered. In 1959, Heuss was awarded the prestigious Friedenspreis des Deutschen Buchhandels. In addressing the memory of Nazism and the Third Reich, Heuss introduced the concept of collective shame as opposed to collective guilt. His rhetoric encouraged the Germans to never forget the Holocaust and precisely described the crimes against the Jews but he refrained from citing those who were responsible for their suffering. On 12 December 1963 Heuss died in Stuttgart, aged 79. In 1957 Heuss donated a sculpted portal entry to the Camposanto of the Teutons and the Flemish in Vatican city. The portal, by sculptor Elmar Hillebrand of Cologne, gives access from the Teutonic Cemetery to the Church of Santa Maria della Piet√† in Camposanto dei Teutonici, the National Church in Rome of Austria, Germany, and the Netherlands.\\"Campo Santo Teutonico\\", Stato Della Citt√† del Vaticano Since 1964, the Theodor Heuss Prize has been awarded for exemplary democratic disposition. Heuss's former residence is now open to the public as the Theodor-Heuss-Haus. His image appeared on one series of the two-mark coin and numerous streets and squares all over Germany have been named in his honour.

He was Minister President of North Rhine-Westphalia from 1947 to 1956. Early life and education Arnold was born in Herrlish√∂fen in W√ºrttemberg on 21 March 1901. He was trained as shoemaker and later (1920/21) studied at the Soziale Hochschule Leohaus, Munich. From 1920 onwards, Arnold worked as functionary of the movement of Christian workers. In 1924, he became secretary of the Christian workers union for the D√ºsseldorf region. He was elected in the town council of D√ºsseldorf for the Centre Party in 1929. In 1933, Arnold was co- owner of a sanitary installation shop in D√ºsseldorf. The Gestapo observed and hunted him in the following years because of his political activities. In 1944, he was jailed by the Gestapo. Career After World War II, Arnold became politically active again. In 1945, he was co-founder of the local Christian-Democratic Party in D√ºsseldorf, which became part of the CDU later in 1945. Also in 1945, the D√ºsseldorf chapter of the united workers union was founded, presided by Arnold. On 29 January 1946 Arnold was named mayor of D√ºsseldorf and later elected in the first free elections (26 October 1946). In December 1946, Arnold became deputy minister-president of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia and in 1947 he was elected minister-president. Until 1950 he presided over a coalition of CDU, Centre Party, SPD and (briefly) the Communist Party. He considered himself a \\"christian socialist\\". The only in- parliament-party he did not let enter the government was the FDP, whose North- Rhine Westphalian branch had a particular nationalist bent. On 7 September 1949, he was elected as the first president of the Bundesrat of Germany, the representation of German states at the federal level. From 1950 to 1956, Arnold was elected minister-president for North Rhine-Westphalia twice again, governing with the help of conservative parties and the Free Democrats. Important acts of his government were the foundation of the North Rhine- Westphalian broadcasting system (today: Westdeutscher Rundfunk) and the German system of workers union influence in steel and coal industries. On 20 February 1956, the FDP switched coalition affiliation to the SPD, ending the Arnold government in North Rhine-Westphalia. In 1957, he was elected into the German Bundestag (with a 72% majority in his constituency). He was member of the Bundestag until 29 June 1958, when he died of a heart attack. Personal life In 1928, Arnold married Liesel Joeres. Arnold was a Catholic and a member of the German branch of the lay Catholic organization Catholic Action.

He served as a Teachta D√°la (TD) from 1921 to 1923 and 1927 to 1957. Early life and career Derrig was born on 26 November 1897, in Westport, County Mayo. He was educated locally and later at University College Galway. During his time in college he organised a corps of the Irish Volunteers. After the 1916 Easter Rising he was arrested and imprisoned, and sent to the prisons of Woking, Wormwood Scrubs and Frongoch internment camp. He was arrested in 1918, and was accused of attempting to disarm a soldier. He was sentenced to five months imprisonment by a court in Belfast. When he was released, he supported Joseph MacBride at the 1918 Irish general election. After his release, he graduated from college and became headmaster in a technical college in Mayo. During the Irish War of Independence he was the commander of the Westport Brigade of the Irish Republican Army, before being captured and interned at the Curragh Camp. While there he was elected a Sinn F√©in TD for Mayo North and West. Derrig took the Republican/Anti-treaty side during the Irish Civil War. During the Civil War, he was an auxiliary assistant to Liam Lynch. He was later captured by the Irish Free State army. While in custody of the Criminal Investigation Department he was severely injured, having an eye shot out by CID detectives. Political career At the June 1927 general election he was elected to D√°il √âireann as a Fianna F√°il TD for Carlow‚ÄìKilkenny. In √âamon de Valera's first government in 1932 Derrig was appointed Minister for Education. Derrig initiated a review of industrial and reformatory schools and the rules under the Children Act 1908, resulting in the critical 1936 Cussen Report, which he shelved. His lack of action was noted in 2009 when the Ryan Report examined the subsequent management of these \\"residential institutions\\"; Derrig was the first Minister to seek a report that could have resulted in much-needed reforms. It has been suggested that he did not want to follow British law reforms in the 1920s and 1930s, because of his strong anti-British views, and that Irish children had suffered needlessly as a result.Arnold, Bruce, The Irish Gulag, (Gill & Macmillan, Dublin 2009), page 41. From 1939 to 1943, he served as Minister for Lands. He was re-appointed to Education in 1943 until 1948. During this period a bitter teachers' strike, involving the Irish National Teachers Organisation (INTO), took place, lasting from 20 March to 30 October. Between 1951 and 1954, he became Minister for Lands again. Thomas Derrig died in Dublin on 19 November 1956, seven days before his 59th birthday.

The novel explores how world history might have been different if the Black Death plague had killed 99% of Europe's population, instead of a third as it did in reality. Divided into ten parts, the story spans hundreds of years, from the army of the Muslim conqueror Timur to the 21st century, with Europe being re-populated by Muslim pioneers, the indigenous peoples of the Americas forming a league to resist Chinese and Muslim invaders, and a 67-year-long world war being fought primarily between Muslim states and the Chinese and their allies. While the ten parts take place in different times and places, they are connected by a group of characters that are reincarnated into each time but are identified to the reader by the first letter of their name being consistent in each life. The novel explores themes of history, religion, and social movements. The historical narrative is guided more by social history than political or military history. Critics found the book to be rich in detail, realistic, and thoughtful. The Years of Rice and Salt won the Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 2003. In the same year it was nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke Award, a Hugo Award, and a British Science Fiction Award. Background At the time of publication in 2002, science fiction author Kim Stanley Robinson was 49 years old and living in Davis, California. He had conceived of the premise for The Years of Rice and Salt in the 1970s while thinking about what alternate history scenario would result in \\"the biggest change that would still work in terms of comparison to our history\\". He subsequently developed an interest in China and in Buddhism which he would study for this project. Robinson's only other alternate history story prior to this project was the short story \\"The Lucky Strike\\" (1984), where the Enola Gay crashes in a training exercise and the secondary crew must complete the Hiroshima bombing. Robinson also wrote an essay titled \\"A Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions\\" (1991), comparing different theories of history and laws of science, such as the covering law model, to explain how alternate histories can be arrived at, using \\"The Lucky Strike\\" as an example. He explored the idea of non-Western influences creating a new culture while working on his Mars trilogy, which involved a heavy Muslim influence in a Martian colony. The Mars trilogy gave Robinson a reputation for quality of writing and a richness of detail comparable to James Michener, as well as winning him a Nebula Award for Red Mars (1993) and two Hugo and Locus Awards for Green Mars (1994) and Blue Mars (1996). Robinson followed the Mars trilogy with the novel Antarctica (1997), which won an Alex Award, and two short story collections, The Martians (1999) and Vinland the Dream (2001), before publishing The Years of Rice and Salt. Plot The story is divided into ten parts. =Book One= Book One, Awake to Emptiness, begins with Bold and Psin, scouts in Timur's army, discovering a Magyar city where all the inhabitants have died from a plague. Timur turns his army around and orders the scouting party executed to avoid the plague, but Bold escapes and wanders through the dead lands of Eastern Europe, encountering only one lone native. Upon reaching the sea he is captured by Turkish Muslim slave-traders and sold into Zheng He's Chinese treasure fleet. Bold befriends a young African slave, named Kyu, whom he cares for after the Chinese castrate him. In China, they are kept as kitchen slaves until escaping and eventually making their way north to Beijing where they find work at the palace of Zhu Gaozhi, heir to the Yongle Emperor. The vengeful Kyu hates the Chinese for what they have done to him and he incites violence between the eunuchs and the Confucian administrative officials. =Book Two= Book Two, The Haj in the Heart, begins in Mughal India where a Hindu girl named Kokila poisons her husband's father and brother after discovering their plot to defraud the village. She is executed for her crime, but is reborn as a tiger that befriends a man named Bistami, a Sufi mystic of Persian origin. Bistami goes on to become a judge for Mughal Emperor Akbar, but later falls into his disfavour, being exiled to Mecca. Bistami spends one year in Mecca before travelling overland to the Maghreb and Iberia (Al-Andalus). Bistami then joins a caravan led by Sultan Mawji and his wife, Katima, who seek to leave Al-Andalus and found a new city on the other side of the Pyrenees, beyond the control of the Caliph of Al-Andalus. They build the city of Baraka on the abandoned former site of Bayonne, France, and create a model society in which Sultana Katima is highly influential. Katima seeks to change the Islamic religion to create equality between men and women, by rejecting the Hadiths and relying only on her interpretation of the Quran. She rules the community after her husband dies (something not allowed in normal Islamic practice), but the Caliph of Al-Andalus eventually hears of their \\"heresy\\" and sends an army against them. The community flees further to the north, where they build a new city named Nsara (near Nantes, France) and are able to defend it from further aggression in later years. =Book Three= In Book Three, Ocean Continents, the Wanli Emperor launches an invasion against Nippon (Japan) but the huge fleet is swept out to sea by the Kuroshio Current and they are set adrift on the unexplored Pacific Ocean. The fleet hopes to be brought back to China eventually by the great circular currents of the Pacific, but they accidentally discover the New World. The sailors make landfall on the West coast of North America and make contact with the indigenous population (the peaceful Miwok people), but quickly leave once Admiral Kheim discovers they have inadvertently infected the indigenous people with devastating diseases. They take a small girl with them (whom they have taught Chinese and named \\"Butterfly\\") and sail south where they meet another civilization rich in gold. There they narrowly escape being ritually sacrificed by using their flintlock firearms, something the natives have never seen before. They eventually return to China and tell the Emperor that he could easily conquer this new land and gain its great wealth. =Book Four= Book Four, The Alchemist, takes place in Samarkand, in the 17th century. An alchemist named Khalid attempts to fool the Khan into believing that he has discovered the Philosopher's stone, but his fraud is uncovered and his hand is chopped off as punishment. Khalid becomes depressed and disenchanted with alchemy and decides to destroy all his Alchemical books. His friend Iwang (a Tibetan Buddhist mathematician) and son-in-law Bahram (a Sufi blacksmith) instead convince him to test the veracity of the claims in the books and thus see if there is any true wisdom to be gained. They devote themselves to practical demonstrations and experiments that greatly improve knowledge of various aspects of physics, chemistry, mathematics, biology, and weaponry, and in the process create the scientific method. Their discoveries create interest (and alarm) amongst the religious madrasahs of the city, many of whom also go along with the new fashion of building and testing scientific apparatuses. But most of all, they catch the eye of the Khan's powerful advisor, who sees in their inventions the possibility of great military technology, to fight the rising Chinese threat to the East. =Book Five= Book Five, Warp and Weft, describes how a former Samurai, fleeing from Japan (which was conquered by China along with most of the rest of East Asia) to the New World, travels all the way across the continent to meet the Iroquois people. They name him \\"Fromwest\\" and make him a chief of their confederacy. He helps organize their society into a larger defensive alliance of all the North American tribes (the Hodenosaunee League) and shows them how to make their own guns with which to resist the Chinese coming from the West and the Muslims coming from the East. =Book Six= Book Six, Widow Kang, follows the life of Chinese widow Kang Tongbi during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor. She takes in a poor Buddhist monk, Bao Ssu, and his son whom she finds scavenging, but the monk is wrongly implicated in a series of queue cuttings and is killed by Qing magistrates. Later, Kang meets a Hui Muslim scholar named Ibrahim ibn Hasam and together they discover it is possible to remember their past lives. They marry and move to Lanzhou in western China, where they undertake work to try to reconcile Islamic and Confucian beliefs. Kang creates and collects works of proto- feminist poetry and becomes a known writer. There is a Muslim rebellion in the region due to the Qing intolerance of new Islamic sects coming from the west, but the revolt is crushed with massive force. =Book Seven= Book Seven, The Age of Great Progress, is set during the 19th century and begins during a war between the Ottoman Empire and the Indian state of Travancore. The Indians have previously defeated the Mughals and the Safavids and have developed more modern forms of warfare, emphasising surprise and mobility, they have also invented steam engines and ironclad warships which they sail straight to the city of Konstantiniyye and capture it with the aid of military balloons. The Ottomans are defeated easily. A Muslim Armenian doctor named Ismail ibn Mani al-Dir, who had served the Ottoman Sultan, is captured and sent to Travancore where he learns of the amazing advancements that have been made on the sub- continent such as railways and factories. He happily joins the hospital of Travancore and begins work in anatomy and physiology. Ismail eventually meets their ruler, the Kerala of Travancore, who pursues scientific and philosophical advancement (a kind of Enlightened Despot). The Kerala's aim is to drive the Muslim invaders away and peacefully unify India into a kind of democratic confederation. Later, during the Xianfeng Emperor's reign, in the Chinese colony known as Gold Mountain, major flooding in the Central Valley of California forces the evacuation of Chinese colonial towns and Japanese settlers alike. The Japanese had originally fled to the new world to escape Chinese oppression in their homeland, but find themselves once again under the Chinese yoke. A displaced Japanese slave, Kiyoaki, and a pregnant Chinese refugee, Peng-ti, manage to flee to the great coastal city of Fangzhang.https://www.kimstanleyrobinson.info/tags/years-rice-and-salt There Kiyoaki joins a secret Japanese freedom movement which is being aided by Travancore, with Ismail acting as a go-between agent. thumb360pxMap of the world of The Years of Rice and Salt in the year 1333 AH (1915 AD), showing the four major blocks/alliances on the eve of the \\"Long War\\". \\\\---- =Book Eight= Book Eight, War of the Asuras, is set in the 20th century, during the \\"Long War\\". The world has become divided into three large alliances, the Chinese Empire and its colonies, the fractured Muslim world (Dar al-Islam), and the democratic Indian and Hodenosaunee Leagues. At the outbreak of war the Muslim states put aside their differences and unite to fight the larger threat of China (whom they fear will soon achieve global hegemony). The Indian and Hodenosaunee Leagues stay neutral at first, but eventually ally with China, as they see the Muslims as their greater enemy, however the Muslims invade northern India all the way down to Burma to stop the Indians and Chinese from linking up. The war drags on for decades causing major changes in the societies involved, with rapid industrialisation, mass conscription and mass casualties (both sides are forced to use women in the fighting to make up for manpower losses). Being the first industrial war, new devastating weapons and methods are employed, such as trench warfare, poison gas and aerial bombing. The story follows Chinese officers, Kuo, Bai and Iwa as they desperately fight in the trenches of the Gansu Corridor, where the ground has been blasted down to bedrock by sixty years of bombardments. The new Chinese government, the \\"Fourth Assemblage of Military Talent\\", orders a new offensive against the Muslim lines in Gansu. Kuo, Bai and Iwa are told to use poison gas and then frontally assault the enemy trenches. They do this successfully, but are beaten back by the second line of Muslim defences, losing tens of thousands of soldiers and gaining nothing. They are then told that their attack was merely a diversion for the real offensive which is being conducted by the Japanese (who have recently been freed by China in exchange for alliance in the war) through Siberia. The Muslims are in retreat but the Japanese get bogged down at the Ural Mountains. In the meantime, Kuo is killed by a shell which penetrates their bunker. Bai and Iwa are ordered to move with their company south through Tibet to support their Indian allies. At a pass in the Himalayas they witness the Muslim artillery blasting the top of Mount Everest down so that the tallest mountain in the world will be in Muslim lands. After extreme difficulties they manage to breach the Muslim defences at the pass and the Chinese army pours through to meet up with the Indians, turning the course of the war in their favour. Bai is plagued by visions of his dead friend Kuo, who tells him that none of this is happening and that he is already dead, killed by the shell earlier. Bai does not know whether he is indeed living real life or is already in the afterlife. =Book Nine= Book Nine, Nsara, follows the life of a young Muslim woman named Budur and her aunt Idelba in Europe, in the aftermath of the Long War. Budur's family is highly traditional and as there are not enough men left after the war for marriage prospects, she is forced to live in seclusion with her female cousins in the family's compound in Turi, a city in one of the Alpine Emirates.https://www.kimstanleyrobinson.info/content/nsara Idelba is an educated woman and was involved in physics research in Firanja before her husband's death, she is just as unhappy in Turi as Budur and wishes to return to her former work. One night, Idelba escapes and Budur follows her. Together they leave the life of captivity in the Alps and move to the more liberal and cosmopolitan city of Nsara (Saint-Nazaire in France). There they stay at a zawiyya, a refuge for women, Idelba restarts her work in physics and Budur enrolls in university where she studies history. The history class is presided over by Kirana, a radical feminist lecturer who questions everything about Muslim society. Budur becomes close to Kirana who opens her eyes to the injustices that women face and how they can seek emancipation and liberation (the two have a brief affair). Life at the university allows for open debate about all issues and Kirana focuses on the nature of history and contemporary events, such as the Muslim defeat in the Long War, which she blames on the failure of the Islamic countries to properly mobilize women for the war effort (something which the Chinese did almost totally). There is also a newfound interest in ancient history as the field of archaeology is taking off (theories about how and why the plague killed off the Europeans centuries before are a popular topic). thumbright360pxThe world of The Years of Rice and Salt in 1423 AH (2002 AD), after the \\"Long War\\". \\\\---- Life in Nsara (and all the Muslim nations) becomes increasingly difficult as they face the effects of defeat in the war. Since casualties were so massive, there is a great shortage of men over women and many men who survived the fighting returned as disabled veterans (Budur volunteers to help veterans blinded by gas at a hospital by reading to them). The Muslims were forced to pay reparations to the victorious countries and to make various humiliating concessions such as allowing Buddhist monasteries to open in their cities. There is a general depression and malaise in post-war Muslim society, made worse by the economic difficulties; hyperinflation, food shortages and strikes. In many counties this leads to governments being overthrown in coups of various kinds. In Nsara itself, order begins to break down as people are near starvation and the military attempts to overthrow the government and impose a police state. However many liberals, including Budur and Kirana start mass street protests against this reactionary dictatorship. Eventually the Hodenosaunee League (who have become very powerful after their victory in the war) intervene by sending a fleet (from their naval base at Orkney) to Nsara, insisting that the military relinquish power, which they do. After this, things slowly start to improve, but most of the Muslim states continue to suffer grave problems. Even in China, a victorious country, there is unrest which turns into a civil war. Throughout this, Idelba has been secretly working on atomic physics and she and her fellow researchers have made some disturbing discoveries. They conclude that it would be possible to make a devastating weapon from nuclear chain reactions and fear that the military will try to create such bombs and restart the war. In order to prevent this, Idelba tries desperately to hide all evidence about her research and contacts concerned scientists in other parts of the world. The government learns of her work however and raids the Zawiyya to get hold of her papers, but Budur manages to hide them. Idelba eventually dies of radiation poisoning from the materials she was working with and leaves all her research to Budur, who keeps her secret and eventually manages to organize an international conference of scientists to discuss the nuclear issue. The meeting is held in Isfahan in Iran (one of the few Islamic nations which has prospered since the war) and scientists from all over the world attend. They agree that none of them will work on the creation of nuclear weapons for their respective countries, no matter what pressure they are put under by their governments and also start a new international scientific movement to break down barriers between cultures in a spirit of reconciliation and friendship (they even create a new scientific calendar to be used by the whole world, with its year zero set from the time of the conference). =Book Ten= Book Ten, The First Years, follows Bao Xinhua. Bao is a revolutionary in China, who works under the leadership of his friend, Kung Jianguo. Bao and Kung successfully overthrow the oppressive Chinese government, but Kung is killed on the cusp of their victory. Deeply depressed and disillusioned, Bao leaves China and begins a voyage around the world. Bao marries and raises two children before accepting a diplomatic post in Myanmar. Eventually, Bao's wife dies, and he begins to wander once again. Bao spends time studying with a comrade from his revolutionary years named Isao Zhu, who poses many macrohistorical questions about the world in which they live. In his later years, Bao moves to Fangzhang to teach history and the philosophy of history, and at the end of the novel, he meets a new student named Kali. Style, themes and genre The novel is divided into ten chapters which each act as a short story, linked by the use of a group of people who appear in each story. After spending time in bardo, the group (or jƒÅti) are reincarnated into different times and places. While characters in each story are unique, they share some characteristics with their previous incarnations and are linked, for convenience, by the first letter of their name. The characters whose names begin with the letter K are \\"combative, imprudent and prone to getting himself (or herself) killed\\" and \\"striking blows against injustice that typically lead to more suffering\\". The B characters are \\"more comfortable in the world, meliorist and optimistic\\" and \\"survivors, nurturing friends and family through bad times and patiently waiting for something better\\". The I characters are \\"the ones who care, who follow the other two, and may be necessary if their works are to flourish, but who tend to the domestic and always find the world worth loving.\\" The style of writing also changes every chapter to reflect the style of writing associated with the culture being depicted. For example, the first chapter is written similarly to Monkey's Journey to the West and a later chapter incorporates postmodernism. Also, later chapters take on metafictional elements, with characters discussing the nature of history, whether it is cyclical or linear, whether they believe in reincarnation, and feelings that some people are intrinsically linked. Robinson incorporated utopian themes in his previous works but reviewers were divided on whether The Years of Rice and Salt qualified as a utopian story. Those that did call the world described in the story as utopian cited the story's illustration of progress. However, those that wrote The Years of Rice and Salt was not a utopian story say that the world history presented is not necessarily better or worse than the real history, just different. Robinson calls himself a \\"utopian novelist\\" in that he claims \\"all science fiction has a utopian element, in that it tends to say that what we do now matters and will have consequences\\". Several other themes were identified by reviewers. Robinson had previously used the theme of memory (or identity) and incorporates it into this story with characters who are reincarnated versions of previous characters and who only recognize each other while in the bardo, but sometimes feel a connection between themselves while on earth. The reviewer in The Globe and Mail identified feminism and \\"struggles over the nature of Islam\\" as recurring themes. =Alternate history= The Years of Rice and Salt belongs to the alternate history subgenre of speculative fiction. The novel starts at the point of divergence with Timur turning his army away from Europe where the Black Death killed 99% of Europe's population, instead of a third. Robinson explores world history from that point in AD 1405 (807 AH) to about AD 2045 (1467 AH) with Mughal Emperor Akbar being the last character with a real-world counterpart. Robinson's take on alternate history is that because it \\"is set in the same lawful universe as ours, its science must be the same [and] because its people have the same basic human needs, their societies resemble ours.\\" Therefore, despite the difference in who specifically is there, \\"the great majority of humanity [is] doing their work, and that work would tend to forge along at a certain pace as people tried to solve the problems of making themselves more comfortable in this world.\\" While most alternate histories use the Great Man theory of history, focusing on leaders, wars, and big events, Robinson writes more about social history, similar to the Annales School of historical theory and Marxist historiography, focusing on the lives of ordinary people living in their time and place. This is reflected in the title of the novel, The Years of Rice and Salt, which refers to the everyday chores of raising a family, often performed by women, despite the politics and wars of men. Reviewers noted this allows for the \\"history [to be] experienced by readers on a human scale\\" and \\"an implicit but thorough rebuke to the kind of war-gaming determinism that most alternate histories embody.\\" The novel has characters that explore subjects like philosophy, theology, history, and scientific theory. Publication and reception Released in March 2002, the book was published in North America by Bantam Books and in the United Kingdom by HarperCollins. The paperback was released in 2003 along with a Spanish translation. In the subsequent years, other translated versions were published, in French, Polish, Chinese, and Hungarian. The novel was well received by critics who variously called it \\"thoughtful\\", \\"realistic\\", and \\"rich\\". In Publishers Weekly, the reviewers called it a \\"highly realistic and credible alternate history\\", and in the School Library Journal, Christine Menefee called it \\"an addictive, surprising, and suspenseful novel\\". The Library Journal \\"highly recommended\\" it, saying that its \\"superb storytelling and imaginative historic speculation make [it] a priority choice for all SF and general fiction collections\\". The critic at Kirkus Reviews found it \\"overlong, but blessed with moments of wry and gentle beauty\\". Likewise, Roz Kaveney stated that \\"if there is a weakness in Robinson's work, it is perhaps this; his characters are so intelligent that they never shut up\\". For The Globe and Mail, Sol Chrom lauded the epic scope, calling it a \\"magnificent achievement\\", and for The Belfast News Letter, the reviewer called the novel \\"extraordinary, ambitious, poetic and powerful\\". Science fiction critic Paul Kincaid concluded that it is \\"a huge, complex and highly enjoyable book\\". =Awards= It won the 2003 Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel and was nominated for the Hugo Award, the Arthur C.

Probabilistic context free grammars (PCFGs) have been applied in probabilistic modeling of RNA structures almost 40 years after they were introduced in computational linguistics. PCFGs extend context-free grammars similar to how hidden Markov models extend regular grammars. Each production is assigned a probability. The probability of a derivation (parse) is the product of the probabilities of the productions used in that derivation. These probabilities can be viewed as parameters of the model, and for large problems it is convenient to learn these parameters via machine learning. A probabilistic grammar's validity is constrained by context of its training dataset. PCFGs have application in areas as diverse as natural language processing to the study the structure of RNA molecules and design of programming languages. Designing efficient PCFGs has to weigh factors of scalability and generality. Issues such as grammar ambiguity must be resolved. The grammar design affects results accuracy. Grammar parsing algorithms have various time and memory requirements. Definitions Derivation: The process of recursive generation of strings from a grammar. Parsing: Finding a valid derivation using an automaton. Parse Tree: The alignment of the grammar to a sequence. An example of a parser for PCFG grammars is the pushdown automaton. The algorithm parses grammar nonterminals from left to right in a stack-like manner. This brute- force approach is not very efficient. In RNA secondary structure prediction variants of the Cocke‚ÄìYounger‚ÄìKasami (CYK) algorithm provide more efficient alternatives to grammar parsing than pushdown automata. Another example of a PCFG parser is the Stanford Statistical Parser which has been trained using Treebank.  Formal definition  Similar to a CFG, a probabilistic context- free grammar can be defined by a quintuple: :G = (M, T, R, S, P) where * is the set of non-terminal symbols * is the set of terminal symbols * is the set of production rules * is the start symbol * is the set of probabilities on production rules Relation with hidden Markov models PCFGs models extend context-free grammars the same way as hidden Markov models extend regular grammars. The Inside-Outside algorithm is an analogue of the Forward-Backward algorithm. It computes the total probability of all derivations that are consistent with a given sequence, based on some PCFG. This is equivalent to the probability of the PCFG generating the sequence, and is intuitively a measure of how consistent the sequence is with the given grammar. The Inside- Outside algorithm is used in model parametrization to estimate prior frequencies observed from training sequences in the case of RNAs. Dynamic programming variants of the CYK algorithm find the Viterbi parse of a RNA sequence for a PCFG model. This parse is the most likely derivation of the sequence by the given PCFG. Grammar construction Context-free grammars are represented as a set of rules inspired from attempts to model natural languages. The rules are absolute and have a typical syntax representation known as Backus‚ÄìNaur form. The production rules consist of terminal \\\\left \\\\\\\\{a, b \\\\right\\\\\\\\}' and non-terminal ' symbols and a blank \\\\epsilon may also be used as an end point. In the production rules of CFG and PCFG the left side has only one nonterminal whereas the right side can be any string of terminal or nonterminals. In PCFG nulls are excluded. An example of a grammar: : S \\\\to aS, S \\\\to bS, S \\\\to \\\\epsilon This grammar can be shortened using the '' ('or') character into: : S\\\\to aS  bS \\\\epsilon Terminals in a grammar are words and through the grammar rules a non-terminal symbol is transformed into a string of either terminals and/or non-terminals. The above grammar is read as \\"beginning from a non-terminal the emission can generate either or or \\\\epsilon\\". Its derivation is: : S \\\\Rightarrow aS\\\\Rightarrow abS\\\\Rightarrow abbS \\\\Rightarrow abb Ambiguous grammar may result in ambiguous parsing if applied on homographs since the same word sequence can have more than one interpretation. Pun sentences such as the newspaper headline \\"Iraqi Head Seeks Arms\\" are an example of ambiguous parses. One strategy of dealing with ambiguous parses (originating with grammarians as early as PƒÅ·πáini) is to add yet more rules, or prioritize them so that one rule takes precedence over others. This, however, has the drawback of proliferating the rules, often to the point where they become difficult to manage. Another difficulty is overgeneration, where unlicensed structures are also generated. Probabilistic grammars circumvent these problems by ranking various productions on frequency weights, resulting in a \\"most likely\\" (winner-take-all) interpretation. As usage patterns are altered in diachronic shifts, these probabilistic rules can be re-learned, thus updating the grammar. Assigning probability to production rules makes a PCFG. These probabilities are informed by observing distributions on a training set of similar composition to the language to be modeled. On most samples of broad language, probabilistic grammars where probabilities are estimated from data typically outperform hand-crafted grammars. CFGs when contrasted with PCFGs are not applicable to RNA structure prediction because while they incorporate sequence-structure relationship they lack the scoring metrics that reveal a sequence structural potential Weighted context-free grammar A weighted context-free grammar (WCFG) is a more general category of context-free grammar, where each production has a numeric weight associated with it. The weight of a specific parse tree in a WCFG is the product (or sum ) of all rule weights in the tree. Each rule weight is included as often as the rule is used in the tree. A special case of WCFGs are PCFGs, where the weights are (logarithms of ) probabilities. An extended version of the CYK algorithm can be used to find the \\"lightest\\" (least-weight) derivation of a string given some WCFG. When the tree weight is the product of the rule weights, WCFGs and PCFGs can express the same set of probability distributions. Applications =RNA structure prediction= Energy minimization and PCFG provide ways of predicting RNA secondary structure with comparable performance. However structure prediction by PCFGs is scored probabilistically rather than by minimum free energy calculation. PCFG model parameters are directly derived from frequencies of different features observed in databases of RNA structures rather than by experimental determination as is the case with energy minimization methods. The types of various structure that can be modeled by a PCFG include long range interactions, pairwise structure and other nested structures. However, pseudoknots can not be modeled. PCFGs extend CFG by assigning probabilities to each production rule. A maximum probability parse tree from the grammar implies a maximum probability structure. Since RNAs preserve their structures over their primary sequence; RNA structure prediction can be guided by combining evolutionary information from comparative sequence analysis with biophysical knowledge about a structure plausibility based on such probabilities. Also search results for structural homologs using PCFG rules are scored according to PCFG derivations probabilities. Therefore, building grammar to model the behavior of base-pairs and single-stranded regions starts with exploring features of structural multiple sequence alignment of related RNAs. : S \\\\to aSa  bSb  aa  bb The above grammar generates a string in an outside-in fashion, that is the basepair on the furthest extremes of the terminal is derived first. So a string such as aabaabaa is derived by first generating the distal 's on both sides before moving inwards: : S \\\\Rightarrow aSa \\\\Rightarrow aaSaa \\\\Rightarrow aabSbaa \\\\Rightarrow aabaabaa A PCFG model extendibility allows constraining structure prediction by incorporating expectations about different features of an RNA . Such expectation may reflect for example the propensity for assuming a certain structure by an RNA. However incorporation of too much information may increase PCFG space and memory complexity and it is desirable that a PCFG-based model be as simple as possible. Every possible string a grammar generates is assigned a probability weight P(x\\\\theta) given the PCFG model \\\\theta. It follows that the sum of all probabilities to all possible grammar productions is \\\\sum_{\\\\text{x}}P(x\\\\theta)=1. The scores for each paired and unpaired residue explain likelihood for secondary structure formations. Production rules also allow scoring loop lengths as well as the order of base pair stacking hence it is possible to explore the range of all possible generations including suboptimal structures from the grammar and accept or reject structures based on score thresholds. Implementations RNA secondary structure implementations based on PCFG approaches can be utilized in : * Finding consensus structure by optimizing structure joint probabilities over MSA. * Modeling base-pair covariation to detecting homology in database searches. * pairwise simultaneous folding and alignment. Different implementation of these approaches exist. For example, Pfold is used in secondary structure prediction from a group of related RNA sequences, covariance models are used in searching databases for homologous sequences and RNA annotation and classification, RNApromo, CMFinder and TEISER are used in finding stable structural motifs in RNAs. Design considerations PCFG design impacts the secondary structure prediction accuracy. Any useful structure prediction probabilistic model based on PCFG has to maintain simplicity without much compromise to prediction accuracy. Too complex a model of excellent performance on a single sequence may not scale. A grammar based model should be able to: * Find the optimal alignment between a sequence and the PCFG. * Score the probability of the structures for the sequence and subsequences. * Parameterize the model by training on sequences/structures. * Find the optimal grammar parse tree (CYK algorithm). * Check for ambiguous grammar (Conditional Inside algorithm). The resulting of multiple parse trees per grammar denotes grammar ambiguity. This may be useful in revealing all possible base-pair structures for a grammar. However an optimal structure is the one where there is one and only one correspondence between the parse tree and the secondary structure. Two types of ambiguities can be distinguished. Parse tree ambiguity and structural ambiguity. Structural ambiguity does not affect thermodynamic approaches as the optimal structure selection is always on the basis of lowest free energy scores. Parse tree ambiguity concerns the existence of multiple parse trees per sequence. Such an ambiguity can reveal all possible base-paired structures for the sequence by generating all possible parse trees then finding the optimal one. In the case of structural ambiguity multiple parse trees describe the same secondary structure. This obscures the CYK algorithm decision on finding an optimal structure as the correspondence between the parse tree and the structure is not unique. Grammar ambiguity can be checked for by the conditional-inside algorithm. Building a PCFG model A probabilistic context free grammar consists of terminal and nonterminal variables. Each feature to be modeled has a production rule that is assigned a probability estimated from a training set of RNA structures. Production rules are recursively applied until only terminal residues are left. A starting non- terminal \\\\mathbf{\\\\mathit{S}} produces loops. The rest of the grammar proceeds with parameter \\\\mathbf{\\\\mathit{L}} that decide whether a loop is a start of a stem or a single stranded region and parameter \\\\mathbf{\\\\mathit{F}} that produces paired bases. The formalism of this simple PCFG looks like: : \\\\mathit{S \\\\to LSL} : \\\\mathit{L \\\\to s  dFd} : \\\\mathit{F \\\\to dFd  LS} The application of PCFGs in predicting structures is a multi-step process. In addition, the PCFG itself can be incorporated into probabilistic models that consider RNA evolutionary history or search homologous sequences in databases. In an evolutionary history context inclusion of prior distributions of RNA structures of a structural alignment in the production rules of the PCFG facilitates good prediction accuracy. A summary of general steps for utilizing PCFGs in various scenarios: * Generate production rules for the sequences. * Check ambiguity. * Recursively generate parse trees of the possible structures using the grammar. * Rank and score the parse trees for the most plausible sequence. Algorithms Several algorithms dealing with aspects of PCFG based probabilistic models in RNA structure prediction exist. For instance the inside-outside algorithm and the CYK algorithm. The inside-outside algorithm is a recursive dynamic programming scoring algorithm that can follow expectation-maximization paradigms. It computes the total probability of all derivations that are consistent with a given sequence, based on some PCFG. The inside part scores the subtrees from a parse tree and therefore subsequences probabilities given an PCFG. The outside part scores the probability of the complete parse tree for a full sequence. CYK modifies the inside-outside scoring. Note that the term 'CYK algorithm' describes the CYK variant of the inside algorithm that finds an optimal parse tree for a sequence using a PCFG. It extends the actual CYK algorithm used in non-probabilistic CFGs. The inside algorithm calculates \\\\alpha(i,j,v) probabilities for all i, j, v of a parse subtree rooted at W_v for subsequence x_i,...,x_j. Outside algorithm calculates \\\\beta(i,j,v) probabilities of a complete parse tree for sequence from root excluding the calculation of x_i,...,x_j. The variables and refine the estimation of probability parameters of an PCFG. It is possible to reestimate the PCFG algorithm by finding the expected number of times a state is used in a derivation through summing all the products of and divided by the probability for a sequence given the model P(x\\\\theta). It is also possible to find the expected number of times a production rule is used by an expectation- maximization that utilizes the values of and . The CYK algorithm calculates \\\\gamma(i, j, v) to find the most probable parse tree \\\\hat{\\\\pi} and yields \\\\log P(x, \\\\hat{\\\\pi}\\\\theta). Memory and time complexity for general PCFG algorithms in RNA structure predictions are O(L^2M) and O(L^3M^3) respectively. Restricting a PCFG may alter this requirement as is the case with database searches methods. PCFG in homology search Covariance models (CMs) are a special type of PCFGs with applications in database searches for homologs, annotation and RNA classification. Through CMs it is possible to build PCFG- based RNA profiles where related RNAs can be represented by a consensus secondary structure. The RNA analysis package Infernal uses such profiles in inference of RNA alignments. The Rfam database also uses CMs in classifying RNAs into families based on their structure and sequence information. CMs are designed from a consensus RNA structure. A CM allows indels of unlimited length in the alignment. Terminals constitute states in the CM and the transition probabilities between the states is 1 if no indels are considered. Grammars in a CM are as follows: :; P \\\\to aWb:probabilities of pairwise interactions between 16 possible pairs :; L \\\\to aW:probabilities of generating 4 possible single bases on the left :; R \\\\to Wa:probabilities of generating 4 possible single bases on the right :; B \\\\to SS:bifurcation with a probability of 1 :; S \\\\to W:start with a probability of 1 :; E \\\\to \\\\epsilon:end with a probability of 1 The model has 6 possible states and each state grammar includes different types of secondary structure probabilities of the non- terminals. The states are connected by transitions. Ideally current node states connect to all insert states and subsequent node states connect to non- insert states. In order to allow insertion of more than one base insert states connect to themselves. In order to score a CM model the inside-outside algorithms are used. CMs use a slightly different implementation of CYK. Log- odds emission scores for the optimum parse tree - \\\\log \\\\hat{e} \\\\- are calculated out of the emitting states P,~L,~R. Since these scores are a function of sequence length a more discriminative measure to recover an optimum parse tree probability score- \\\\log\\\\text{P}(x, \\\\hat{\\\\pi}\\\\theta) \\\\- is reached by limiting the maximum length of the sequence to be aligned and calculating the log-odds relative to a null. The computation time of this step is linear to the database size and the algorithm has a memory complexity of O(M_aD+M_bD^2).  Example: Using evolutionary information to guide structure prediction  The KH-99 algorithm by Knudsen and Hein lays the basis of the Pfold approach to predicting RNA secondary structure. In this approach the parameterization requires evolutionary history information derived from an alignment tree in addition to probabilities of columns and mutations. The grammar probabilities are observed from a training dataset. = Estimate column probabilities for paired and unpaired bases = In a structural alignment the probabilities of the unpaired bases columns and the paired bases columns are independent of other columns. By counting bases in single base positions and paired positions one obtains the frequencies of bases in loops and stems. For basepair and an occurrence of XY is also counted as an occurrence of YX. Identical basepairs such as XX are counted twice. = Calculate mutation rates for paired and unpaired bases = By pairing sequences in all possible ways overall mutation rates are estimated. In order to recover plausible mutations a sequence identity threshold should be used so that the comparison is between similar sequences. This approach uses 85% identity threshold between pairing sequences. First single base positions differences -except for gapped columns- between sequence pairs are counted such that if the same position in two sequences had different bases the count of the difference is incremented for each sequence. +1 first sequence pair}} +1 second sequence pair}} = mutation of base X to base Y = \\\\frac {K~C_{\\\\text{XY}}} {P_{x}P_{s}}}} = the negative of the rate of X mutation to other bases = - \\\\sum r_{\\\\text{XY}}}} For unpaired bases a 4 X 4 mutation rate matrix is used that satisfies that the mutation flow from X to Y is reversible: : PX^rXY = PY^rYX For basepairs a 16 X 16 rate distribution matrix is similarly generated. The PCFG is used to predict the prior probability distribution of the structure whereas posterior probabilities are estimated by the inside-outside algorithm and the most likely structure is found by the CYK algorithm. = Estimate alignment probabilities = After calculating the column prior probabilities the alignment probability is estimated by summing over all possible secondary structures. Any column in a secondary structure \\\\sigma for a sequence of length such that D=(C_1,~C_2, ...C_l ) can be scored with respect to the alignment tree and the mutational model . The prior distribution given by the PCFG is P(\\\\sigmaM). The phylogenetic tree, can be calculated from the model by maximum likelihood estimation. Note that gaps are treated as unknown bases and the summation can be done through dynamic programming. : P(DT,M) : =\\\\sum P (D, \\\\sigma T,M) : =\\\\sum P(D\\\\sigma, T, M) P(\\\\sigmaT,M) : =\\\\sum P(D\\\\sigma,T,M) P(\\\\sigmaM) = Assign production probabilities to each rule in the grammar = Each structure in the grammar is assigned production probabilities devised from the structures of the training dataset. These prior probabilities give weight to predictions accuracy. The number of times each rule is used depends on the observations from the training dataset for that particular grammar feature. These probabilities are written in parenthesis in the grammar formalism and each rule will have a total of 100%. For instance: : S \\\\to LS (80\\\\%) L (20\\\\%) : L \\\\to s (70\\\\%)  dFd (30\\\\%) : F \\\\to dFd (60.4\\\\%) LS (39.6\\\\%) = Predict the structure likelihood = Given the prior alignment frequencies of the data the most likely structure from the ensemble predicted by the grammar can then be computed by maximizing P(\\\\sigmaD,T,M) through the CYK algorithm. The structure with the highest predicted number of correct predictions is reported as the consensus structure. : \\\\sigma_{MAP}= \\\\arg\\\\underset{\\\\sigma}\\\\max P(D \\\\sigma,T^ML, M) P(\\\\sigmaM) = Pfold improvements on the KH-99 algorithm = PCFG based approaches are desired to be scalable and general enough. Compromising speed for accuracy needs to as minimal as possible. Pfold addresses the limitations of the KH-99 algorithm with respect to scalability, gaps, speed and accuracy. *In Pfold gaps are treated as unknown. In this sense the probability of a gapped column equals that of an ungapped one. *In Pfold the tree is calculated prior to structure prediction through neighbor joining and not by maximum likelihood through the PCFG grammar. Only the branch lengths are adjusted to maximum likelihood estimates. *An assumption of Pfold is that all sequences have the same structure. Sequence identity threshold and allowing a 1% probability that any nucleotide becomes another limit the performance deterioration due to alignment errors. =Protein sequence analysis= Whereas PCFGs have proved powerful tools for predicting RNA secondary structure, usage in the field of protein sequence analysis has been limited. Indeed, the size of the amino acid alphabet and the variety of interactions seen in proteins make grammar inference much more challenging. As a consequence, most applications of formal language theory to protein analysis have been mainly restricted to the production of grammars of lower expressive power to model simple functional patterns based on local interactions. Since protein structures commonly display higher-order dependencies including nested and crossing relationships, they clearly exceed the capabilities of any CFG. Still, development of PCFGs allows expressing some of those dependencies and providing the ability to model a wider range of protein patterns. One of the main obstacles in inferring a protein grammar is the size of the alphabet that should encode the 20 different amino acids. It has been proposed to address this by using physico-chemical properties of amino acids to reduce significantly the number of possible combinations of right side symbols in production rules: 3 levels of a quantitative property are utilised instead of the 20 amino acid types, e.g. small, medium or large van der Waals volume. Based on such a scheme, PCFGs have been produced to generate both binding site and helix-helix contact site descriptors. A significant feature of those grammars is that analysis of their rules and parse trees can provide biologically meaningful information.

Los Tres recorded nine albums from 1989 until 2000, starting with Los Tres in 1991. The band dissolved in 2000 and its members continued their musical careers. In February 2006 Alvaro Henr√≠quez, √Ångel Parra, and Roberto Lindl announced the reunion of the band without drummer Francisco Molina and the recording of their 2006 studio album H√°galo Usted Mismo. Introduction During the nineties, massive commercial entertainment (and only bits of culture and art) rose immensely in Chile; prior to that most \\"left-wing\\" or anti-military cultural expressions were repressed for almost 20 years (see Chile under Pinochet). In this context appeared Los Tres whose work is based, in contrast to most rock/pop groups from this era, on the folk and popular music of Chile with added rock and jazz influences. The band's attitude was to reject commercial pop/rock and easy trends. Furthermore, their music and mostly their lyrics, though not following the style, can be considered as \\"grunge\\" in spirit. Given this, it was against all odds for them to succeed. History In 1982, three guys from Concepci√≥n, √Ålvaro Henr√≠quez, Roberto Titae Lindl, and \\"Pancho\\" Molina started a band called Los Dick Stones, whose set list was based on songs by Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, and Gene Vincent. They quickly became very popular in universities, bars, and clubs around the southern city of Concepci√≥n. Given their ambition, to achieve success in the Chilean mainstream, they decided to move to the capital city of Santiago and changed their name to Los Tres. In 1988, √Ångel Parra joined the band, and even though Los Tres is Spanish for \\"the three\\", they decided to keep the name. In 1991, with the alternative Alerce music label, Los Tres recorded their first album, Los Tres. Despite being only a moderately successful album with songs that mixed Rock, Jazz, and Blues, Los Tres nevertheless became an important album in the early nineties. The single Un Amor Violento, and its low-budget music video became very popular in Chile. The lyrics in some songs of this album (like in La Primera Vez and Flores Secas) talk strongly about their opposition to the Pinochet coup and the human rights abuses during the military regime. The second album of the band was called Se Remata el Siglo. In 1993, now signed with the Sony music label, the band achieved a much better quality LP. This album showed more rock elements, in the singles No sabes que desperdicio tengo en el alma and El Aval, but without straying too far from their blues influences in songs like So√±e que estabas justo sobre mi and the BB King's cover The Thrill is Gone. La Espada & la Pared (1995) was the third album of the band. This album was very popular and the most important of their career. Singles like Dejate Caer and La Espada & La Pared were popular in all of Latin America, thanks to the diffusion on MTV Latino and became a Gold record in 46 days. One of the popular songs in La Espada & La Pared was the remake of Buddy Richard's cover 1960 rock tune Tu Cari√±o se me Va, where Buddy himself did some back-up vocals. The popularity achieved by La Espada y La Pared, was an important motivation for the MTV network, who invited Los Tres to perform an Unplugged session in Miami. This was recorded on 14 September 1995, with the participation of the Chilean musicians and friends of the band To√±o Restucci and Cuti Aste. The performance was just a few months after the death of Roberto Parra, an important Chilean folk musician and an inspiration for √Ålvaro and the band in general. Therefore, the guys decided to dedicate the Unplugged session to el t√≠o Roberto memories, and played two cuecas choras, El Arrepentido and La Vida que yo He Pasado, and the popular foxtrot ¬øQui√©n es la que viene all√≠? \\"composed\\" by him but actually a mock of the American popular song Yes Sir, That's My Baby music by Walter Donaldson and original lyrics by Gus Kahn and sung by Lee Morse in 1925. This was that the first time a Chilean band recorded an Unplugged with MTV. Unplugged, released in 1996, was a big success in Chile and Latin America. The LP became a 4-platinum album in Chile in just three months and the band promoted the LP with unplugged concerts in the Teatro California in Santiago, with guest musicians like To√±o Restucci, Pepe Fuentes, Rabanito, Cuti Aste, and Javiera Parra, √Ångel's sister. The following years, Los Tres began a short folk-based era. They performed in February 1996 as a guest band in the Vi√±a del Mar international music festival. The show began with √Ålvaro imitating the characteristic voice of Antonio Vodanovic, the festival's MC. They played a lot of cuecas by Roberto Parra and received the Gaviota de Plata, an award that is reserved only for the festival's music contest, but the crowd insisted strongly until the band received it. The band began a new traditional event during the 1996 Chilean national independence holiday, on 18 September, by founding a Fonda called Yein Fonda (a pun on Jane Fonda) in the park Plaza √ëunoa in Santiago, where they performed during several days folk music with friends. The records of this event were released in an LP called La Yein Fonda later that year. During the following years they organized more Fondas, but with time these became more commercial and not as popular as Yein Fonda. In 1998 the band recorded Peineta, an album with cuecas choras and jazz huachaca, featuring Lalo Parra, brother of Roberto. After the great success of Los Tres with La Espada & La Pared and Unplugged, the following studio album with new material came only in 1998. Fome (named after a Chilean word that means boring) didn't achieve the popularity of their preceding albums. The lyrics this time were more poetic and with the exception of La Torre de Babel and Restaurant, not so easy to understand. During these years Parra and Lindl started a parallel jazz project called √Ångel Parra Tr√≠o, with the jazz drummer Moncho P√©rez and Molina started the Jazz band Los Titulares. Both bands started having great popularity into the Chilean Jazz movement, and this summed up to create internal problems in Los Tres because of the directions that √Ålvaro wanted for the band. Their last studio album was released in 1999. La Sangre en el Cuerpo, and didn't enjoy great success in Chile. Even though the album is very different from when the band began, great songs like Feria Verdadera, La Sangre en el Cuerpo and the instrumental El Rey del Mariscal showed √Ålvaro and the band in a great musical moment that, unfortunately, the Chilean mainstream didn't appreciate. Personal differences, the poor sales of the latest LPs, and the increasing interest in the personal projects of individual members culminated with the band announcing their separation in 2000. They performed several goodbye concerts in Santiago, Concepci√≥n, and other Chilean cities. One of these concerts, in Teatro Providencia, 27 May 2000, was recorded and later that year released as the live album Freno de Mano. Aftermath (up to February 2007) Two years after the breakup of the band (2002), a DVD, Vermouth & Noche, was released. It included part of the history of the band, some original videoclips and live performances. √Ålvaro started in 2001 a band called Los Petinellis which released an album in 2002 and dissolved in 2004. Later, he started a solo career. √Ångel Parra Tr√≠o has recorded in total eight albums. After Los tres, he issued one live album in 2001 and two studio albums (in 2003 and 2005): ‚Ä¢ √Ångel Parra Tr√≠o 1992 ‚Ä¢ Patana 1995 ‚Ä¢ Piscola Standard 1996 ‚Ä¢ Tequila 1998 ‚Ä¢ No junta ni Pega 2000 ‚Ä¢ La Hora Feliz 2002 ‚Ä¢ Vamos que se puede 2003 ‚Ä¢ La playa Solitaria 2005 Los Titulares have released three LPs: Los Titulares in 1999 ‚Äì El perseguidor in 2001 and Bipolar in 2005. In 2006 three of the band's four members announced a reunion and a new album. √Ålvaro Henr√≠quez, √Ångel Parra, and Roberto Lindl are working on the recording of the twelve new songs for the album, due out around August 2006.La Tercera (in Spanish), retrieved 16 April 2006 In February 2007 the band played at the Vi√±a del Mar International Song Festival, Chile. Playing to a crowd of 15,000 attendees at the most important Latin American music festival, the band received multiple standing ovations and were awarded the Antorcha de Plata (Silver Torch), the Antorcha de Oro (Golden Torch), and ultimately the Gaviota de Plata (the Silver Seagull), the festival's highest honor.

It has hundreds of miles of lake arms and coves, and common activities include boating, water sports, swimming, and fishing. Nineteen developed parks around the shoreline provide campgrounds, boat launches, swim areas, and marinas.  History  Bull Shoals Dam Aerial Photo of Bull Shoals Dam Bull Shoals Dam was created to impound the White River by one of the largest concrete dams in the United States and the 5th largest dam in the world at its inception. Work on the dam began in 1947, was completed in 1951 and dedicated by President Harry S. Truman in 1952. At least seven small family cemeteries and 20 larger cemeteries were meticulously relocated to accommodate the new lake. Recent national events include Brostock 2010 and 2011 and the TBF Bass Federation and Bassmaster Elite Series Tournaments in 2012.  Hydrology  Bull Shoals Lake impounds the White River for the last time as water travels toward its mouth on the Mississippi River. Bull Shoals is thus the lake farthest downstream in a chain of four artificial lakes that include (from upstream to downstream) Beaver Lake, Table Rock Lake and Lake Taneycomo. The lake is controlled by the Army Corps of Engineers and has the primary purpose of flood control. The level of the lake fluctuates regularly with a normal pool level elevation of 654 feet above sea level, which is locally known as powerpool. However, the lake regularly fluctuates between an elevation of 630 to 680 feet. The upper part of the lake, below nearby Powersite Dam, is known as the \\"Pothole\\". The shoreline of the lake is totally undeveloped and protected by a buffer zone (locally called the ‚Äútake line‚Äù) owned, operated, managed, and controlled by the Army Corps of Engineers. The dam is designed for a maximum elevation of 695 feet (top of the flood pool). Bull Shoals Lake covers 45,000 acres (182 km¬≤) with a 700-mile (1,120-km) shoreline at powerpool to more than 70,000 acres (284 km¬≤)with a 1,000-mile (1,600-km) shoreline at 690 feet. The bottom of the lake consists of bedrock with very limited vegetation. The shoreline is heavily forested.Bull Shoals, Fishing Hot Spots  State park  The Bull Shoals-White River State Park is a 725-acre (2.9 km¬≤) park in Baxter and Marion Counties of Arkansas both above and below the massive dam. Facilities, including camping, pavilions, dock and interpretive programs, stretch along the banks of the White River. Along the lakeshore, the park offers picnic sites and playgrounds. Flooding of 2008 In the spring of 2008, due to the record rainfall, Bull Shoals reached its highest water level since 1957. The lake crested at 695.02 feet above sea level, prompting the Army Corps of Engineers to open the floodgates to relieve the lake from further flooding. A record crest of 696.51 was achieved at 5 p.m. Friday May 27, 2011 due to record rainfall, exceeding the Spring 2008 lake levels and 1957 levels.

From 1967 until the late 1980s, the magazine featured the writings of authors such as Thomas Sowell, Tom Wolfe, P.J. O'Rourke, George F. Will, Malcolm Gladwell, Patrick J. Buchanan, and Malcolm Muggeridge. During the 1990s, the magazine was better known for its reports on Bill Clinton and its \\"Arkansas Project,\\" funded by businessman Richard Mellon Scaife and the Bradley Foundation. The American Spectator has carried articles by Thomas Sowell, a regular column by economist and celebrity Ben Stein, as well as former Reagan aide Jeffrey Lord, conservative health care consultant David Catron, and editorial director Wladyslaw Pleszczynski, as well as occasional articles by P.J. O'Rourke. Founding and history The American Spectator was founded in 1924 by George Jean Nathan and Truman Newberry. In 1967, the Saturday Evening Club took it over and renamed it The Alternative: An American Spectator. After operating under the name The Alternative: An American Spectator for several years, in 1977 the magazine changed its name to The American Spectator because, in editor Tyrrell's words, \\"the word 'alternative' had come to be associated almost exclusively with radicals and with their way of life.\\" In fact, Tyrrell had started the magazine on the campus of Indiana University Bloomington in 1967 as a conservative alternative to the student radicalism at the nation's universities in the 1960s. American Spectator is not affiliated with The Spectator, a British magazine of somewhat similar format and conservatism. During the Reagan Administration, the magazine moved from Bloomington, Indiana to suburban Washington, D.C. 1990s  The publication gained prominence in the 1990s by reporting on political scandals. The March 1992 issue contained David Brock's criticisms of Clarence Thomas accuser Anita Hill. Brock and his colleague Daniel Wattenberg soon aimed at a bigger target: Hillary and Bill Clinton. A January 1994 article about then-President Bill Clinton's sex life contained the first reference in print to Clinton accuser Paula Jones, although the article focused on allegations that Clinton used Arkansas state troopers to facilitate his extramarital sexual activities (see Troopergate). It only referred to Jones by her first name and corroborated few if any elements of her story. This article was the basis for the claim of damages in a sexual harassment lawsuit, which started the chain of events resulting in President Clinton's impeachment. David Brock recanted his accusations upon his departure from the conservative movement. He also denounced his Anita Hill article in his 2003 book Blinded by the Right: the Conscience of an Ex- Conservative. He implies that Rush Limbaugh's coverage of his Anita Hill article instigated advertising on Limbaugh's network, which resulted in a large increase in the magazine's circulation. He also implies that this caused the magazine's content to move \\"away from thoughtful essays and scholarly reviews and humor pieces\\" to \\"hit jobs.\\" An entire chapter (Chapter 5) is devoted to describing Brock's experience writing \\"The Real Anita Hill\\" article and book in the early 1990s. The \\"hit jobs\\" quote is from p. 110. For his part, Wattenberg eventually incurred the displeasure of many fellow conservatives when he belatedly admitted that he had killed a story about rumors of Clinton fathering a child out of wedlock as a result of his relationship with a young African American woman. Wattenberg actually tracked down a videotape of the woman being interviewed by an unnamed third party who asked her what Wattenberg described as \\"softball\\" questions, but he never was able to interview her himself. Wattenberg's rationales for killing the story were that he had no proof that the story was true and that the woman's testimony was unconvincing. He said that she \\"seemed like a junkie.\\" The story was revived in 1999 by Matt Drudge. Internal strife eventually led to the departure of long-time publisher Ronald Burr after a disagreement with Tyrrell led Burr to call for an independent audit of the magazine's finances. The departure of Burr and several prominent conservative figures from the magazine's board of directors resulted in conservative foundations pulling much of the funding the nonprofit had relied on to pay high salaries to Brock and Tyrrell, as well as to fund direct-mail campaigns needed to keep up the monthly's circulation. Faced with a budget crisis, the magazine, then led by publisher Terry Eastland, a former spokesman in the Reagan Justice Department, laid off staffers and cut spending significantly. The magazine also struggled to pay legal bills incurred from an investigation launched against it by the Justice Department for alleged witness tampering in the Whitewater investigation. The Justice Department investigation led to revelations about the \\"Arkansas Project,\\" a campaign by businessman Richard Mellon Scaife to discredit the Clintons by funding investigative reporting at several conservative media outlets. 2000s As shortfalls continued, George Gilder, a longtime supporter of the magazine, who was newly wealthy from an Internet business, purchased the magazine with the goal of turning it into a profit- making glossy with significant media buzz. Numerous staff members, demoralized by the ever-looming budget crises, were laid off or departed after Joshua Gilder and Richard Vigilante took the reins and vowed to reach a new technology- and business-savvy audience. Circulation and budget losses continued and even increased in the Gilder era, and at one point the entire Washington-based staff, other than Tyrrell and executive editor and web site editor Wladyslaw Pleszczynski, were laid off as operations were moved to Massachusetts, where the rest of George Gilder's businesses were based. In 2003, George Gilder, who had lost most of his fortune with the bursting of the Internet stock bubble, sold the magazine for $1 back to Tyrrell and the American Alternative Foundation, the magazine's original owner. Later, the name of the owner was changed to the American Spectator Foundation. The magazine then moved operations back to the Washington, D.C. area. Later that year, former book publisher Alfred S. Regnery became the magazine's publisher. By 2004, circulation hovered at around 50,000. 2010s In 2013, the magazine reverted to a tabloid format, reflecting the roots of the magazine, which was originally published at a large size. For most of the 1990s and all of the 2000s the Spectator had been published in a traditional magazine format. In 2011, Assistant Editor Patrick Howley published a piece detailing his infiltration of a Washington, D.C. protest. In the article, Howley asserts his aim to \\"mock and undermine\\" the protest against American Imperialism, and writes in the first person about his experiences protesting at the National Air and Space Museum. This article, and the methods detailed within, was condemned by The Guardian, The Atlantics \\"Atlantic Wire\\" blog, and The Economist, because they believed the correspondents who worked on the story had conflated journalism and politics Matt Steinglass of The Economist wrote that Howley \\"winds up offering a vision of politics as a kind of self-focused performance art, or perhaps (to say the same thing) a version of Jackass.\\" Online publication The magazine's final monthly print publication was released in July/August 2014. While the Spectator did issue a September/October PDF-only version late in mid-November 2014, the masthead still claimed that it was \\"published monthly, except for combined July/Aug and Jan/Feb issues.\\" A note from Editorial Director Wlady Pleszczynski admitted that \\"...we have some problems of our own.\\" Pleszczynski added that the issue \\"was ready for release well over a month ago but for reasons affecting many a print publication these days couldn't be published on actual pages and after considerable delay is now being released in digital form only.\\" Core editorial staff *Editor in Chief: R.

Section 60 of the Constitution Act, 1982 states that the Act may be called the \\"Constitution Act, 1982\\", and that the Constitution Acts can be collectively called the \\"Constitution Acts, 1867 to 1982\\". The Act was introduced as part of Canada's process of patriating the constitution, introducing several amendments to the British North America Act, 1867, including re-naming it the Constitution Act, 1867.Section 1 of the British North America Act, 1867 was amended to be re-named as the Constitution Act, 1867. Section 20 of the Constitution Act, 1867 was repealed and replaced by section 5 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms; and sections 91(1) and 92(1) were repealed: Constitution Act, 1982, s. 53 and Schedule, Item 1. A new section, s. 92A, was also added: Constitution Act, 1982, ss. 50 and 51. In addition to patriating the Constitution, the Constitution Act, 1982 enacted the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms; guaranteed rights of the Aboriginal peoples of Canada; provided for future constitutional conferences; and set out the procedures for amending the Constitution in the future. This process was necessary because, after the Statute of Westminster, 1931, Canada decided to allow the British Parliament to temporarily retain the power to amend Canada's constitution, on request from the Parliament of Canada. In 1981, the Parliament of Canada requested that the Parliament of the United Kingdom remove that authority from the UK. The passing of the UK's Canada Act 1982 in March 1982 confirmed the Patriation of the Constitution and transferred to Canada the power of amending its own Constitution. On April 17, 1982, Queen Elizabeth II and Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, as well as the Minister of Justice, Jean Chr√©tien, and Andr√© Ouellet, the Registrar General, signed the Proclamation which brought the Constitution Act, 1982 into force. The proclamation confirmed that Canada had formally assumed authority over its constitution, the final step to full sovereignty.\\"The signing of the proclamation on April 17, 1982, marked the end of efforts by many successive governments. The new Constitution was accompanied by The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and an amending formula that would no longer require an appeal to the British Parliament.\\" (Library and Archives Canada 2017).\\"The Constitution Act itself cleaned up a bit of unfinished business from the Statute of Westminster in 1931, in which Britain granted each of the Dominions full legal autonomy if they chose to accept it. All but one Dominion ‚Äî that would be us, Canada ‚Äî chose to accept every resolution. Our leaders couldn't decide on how to amend the Constitution, so that power stayed with Britain until 1982.\\" (Couture 2017). As of 2020, the government of Quebec has never formally approved of the enactment of the act, though the Supreme Court concluded that Quebec's formal consent was never necessaryReference re Amendment to the Canadian Constitution, [1982] 2 SCR 793. (aka Quebec Veto Reference). See also Reference re Resolution to Amend the Constitution, [1981] 1 SCR 753 (aka Patriation Reference). and 15 years after ratification the government of Quebec \\"passed a resolution authorizing an amendment.\\" Nonetheless, the lack of formal approval has remained a persistent political issue in Quebec. The Meech Lake and Charlottetown Accords were designed to secure approval from Quebec, but both efforts failed to do so. Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is the first Part of the Constitution Act, 1982. The Charter is a bill of rights to protect certain political rights, legal rights and human rights of people in Canada from the policies and actions of all levels of government. An additional goal of the Charter is to unify Canadians around a set of principles that embody those rights.Trudeau, Pierre Elliott. 1993. Memoirs, Toronto: McClelland & Stewart. pp. 322‚Äì23. The Charter was preceded by the Canadian Bill of Rights, which was created by the government of John Diefenbaker in 1960. However, the Bill of Rights was only a federal statute and was limited in its effectiveness because it is not directly applicable to provincial laws. This motivated some within government to establish unambiguously-constitutional-level bill of rights for all Canadians. The movement for human rights and freedoms that emerged after World War II also wanted to entrench the principles enunciated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Hogg, Peter W. 2003. Constitutional Law of Canada (student ed.). Scarborough, ON: Thomson Canada Ltd. p. 689. The Charter was drafted by the federal government with consultations with the provincial governments in the years leading up to the passage of the Constitution Act, 1982. One of the most notable effects of the adoption of the Charter was to greatly expand the range of judicial review, because the Charter is more explicit with respect to the guarantee of rights and the role of judges in enforcing them than was the Canadian Bill of Rights. The courts, when confronted with violations of Charter rights, have struck down unconstitutional statutes or parts of statutes, as they did when Canadian case law was primarily concerned with resolving issues of federalism. However, section 24 of the Charter granted new powers to the courts to enforce more creative remedies and to exclude improperly obtained evidence in criminal trials. These powers are greater than what was typical under the common law and under the principle of Parliamentary supremacy, which Canada had inherited from the United Kingdom.Weinrib, Lorraine Eisenstat. 1998. \\"Trudeau and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms: A Question of Constitutional Maturation.\\" In Trudeau's Shadow: The Life and Legacy of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, edited by A. Cohen and J. L. Granatstein. Toronto: Vintage Canada. Pp. 271‚Äì2. Section 59 limits the application of section 23 of the Charter in Quebec. Paragraph 23(1)(a) of the Charter, which guarantees the minority language education rights of Canadian citizens \\"whose first language learned and still understood is that of the English or French minority linguistic minority population of the province in which they reside\\" will not be in force in Quebec until the Quebec government or legislature chooses to ratify it.\\"The Government [of Quebec] shall not authorize a proclamation under [subsection 59(1)] of the Constitution Act, 1982 without obtaining the prior consent of the National Assembly [of Quebec].\\" (An Act Respecting the Constitution Act, 1982). Aboriginal and treaty rights Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 \\"recognizes and affirms\\" the \\"existing\\" aboriginal and treaty rights in Canada. These aboriginal rights protect the activities, practice, or traditions that are integral to the distinct cultures of the aboriginal peoples. The treaty rights protect and enforce agreements between the Crown and aboriginal peoples. Section 35 also provides protection of aboriginal title which protects the use of land for traditional practices. Subsection 35(2) provides that aboriginal and treaty rights extend to Indian, Inuit, and M√©tis peoples and subsection 35(4), which was added in 1983, ensures that they \\"are guaranteed equally to any male and female persons\\". Subsection 35(3), which was also added in 1983, clarifies that \\"treaty rights\\" include \\"rights that now exist by way of land claims agreements or may be so acquired\\". As a result, by entering into land claims agreements, the government of Canada and members of an aboriginal people can establish new treaty rights, which are constitutionally recognized and affirmed. There are other sections of the Constitution Act, 1982 that address aboriginal rights. Section 25 of the Charter provides that the guarantee of rights and freedoms in the Charter should not be understood to \\"abrogate or derogate from any aboriginal, treaty or other rights or freedoms that pertain to the aboriginal peoples of Canada, including (a) any rights or freedoms that have been recognized by the Royal Proclamation of October 7, 1763; and (b) any rights or freedoms that now exist by way of land claims agreements or may be so acquired.\\" Equalization and equal opportunity Section 36 enshrines in the Constitution a value on equal opportunity for the Canadian people, economic development to support that equality, and government services available for public consumption. Subsection 2 goes further in recognizing a \\"principle\\" that the federal government should ensure equalization payments. Writing in 1982, Professor Peter Hogg expressed skepticism as to whether the courts could interpret and enforce this provision, noting its \\"political and moral, rather than legal\\" character.Hogg, Peter W. 1982. Canada Act 1982 Annotated. Toronto: The Carswell Company Ltd. Other scholars have noted section 36 is too vague. Since the courts would not be of much use in interpreting the section, the section was nearly amended in 1992 with the Charlottetown Accord to make it enforceable. The Accord never came into effect. Amending the Constitution Subsection 52(3) of the Constitution Act, 1982 requires constitutional amendments to be made in accordance with the rules set out in the Constitution itself. Subsection 52(3) entrenches constitutional supremacy and prevents Parliament and the provincial legislatures from making most constitutional amendments using simple legislation. The rules for amending Canada's constitution are quite dense. They are mostly laid out in Part V of the Constitution Act, 1982. There are five different amendment procedures, each applicable to different types of amendments. These five formulas are: # The general procedure (the \\"7/50\\" procedure) - section 38. The amendment must be passed by the House of Commons, the Senate, and at least two-thirds of the provincial legislative assemblies representing at least 50% of the total population of the provinces. This is the default procedure and it covers any amendment procedure not covered more specifically in sections 41, 43, 44 or 45. The general formula must be used for any of the six situations identified in section 42. # The unanimity Procedure - section 41. The amendment must be passed by the House of Commons, Senate, and all provincial legislative assemblies. # The special arrangements procedure (somewhat inaccurately referred to as the \\"bilateral\\" or \\"some-but- not-all-provinces\\" procedure) - section 43. The amendment must be passed by the House of Commons, the Senate, and the legislative assemblies of those provinces that are affected by the amendment. # Federal Parliament Alone (or \\"federal unilateral\\" procedure) - section 44. The amendment must only be passed by Parliament under its ordinary legislative procedure. # Provincial Legislature Alone (or \\"provincial unilateral\\" procedure) - section 45. The amendment must only be passed by the provincial legislature under its ordinary legislative procedure. Neither aboriginal peoples' or the territories' agreement is required to make a constitutional amendment, even if it affects their interests. Section 35.1 commits the governments of Canada and the provinces \\"to the principle that, before any amendment is made [to subsection 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867, section 25 of the Charter or sections 35 or 35.1 of the Constitution Act, 1982]\\" that the Prime Minister will convene a conference of first ministers (i.e. provincial premiers) to discuss the amendment and invite \\"representatives of the aboriginal peoples of Canada\\" to discuss the amendment. Section 35.1 was added to Part II of the Constitution Act, 1982 in 1983. Section 35.1 was invoked in the negotiations that led to the Charlottetown Accord, which would have greatly expanded aboriginal rights and recognized a right to self-government. Various other sections of Part V lay out such things as compensation for opting out, when and how a province may opt out of a constitutional amendment, and time limits for achieving a constitutional amendment. Supremacy and scope of the Constitution Subsection 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 provides that the Constitution of Canada is the \\"supreme law of Canada\\", and that \\"any law inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution of Canada is, to the extent of the inconsistency, of no force or effect.\\"Constitution Act, 1982, s. 52. A law that is inconsistent with the Constitution is theoretically of no force or effect from the moment it is made.. para 28. In practical terms, however, such a law is not seen to be invalid until a court declares it to be inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution. The executive cannot enforce a law that a court has declared to be without force or effect. But only Parliament or a provincial legislature can repeal such a law. Before the 1982 Act came into effect, the British North America Act, 1867 (now known as the Constitution Act, 1867) had been the supreme law of Canada. The supremacy of the 1867 Act had originally been established by virtue of s. 2 of the Colonial Laws Validity Act,Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865, (U.K.) 28 & 29 Vict. c. 63. a British Imperial statute declaring the invalidity of any colonial law that violated an Imperial statute extending to a colony. Since the British North America Act was an Imperial statute extending to Canada, any Canadian law violating the BNA Act was inoperative. Although there was no express provision giving the courts the power to decide that a Canadian law violated the BNA Act and was therefore inoperative, this power was implicit in s. 2 of the Colonial Laws Validity Act, which established the priority of statutes to be applied by the courts. In 1931, the British Parliament enacted the Statute of Westminster, 1931. This Act provided that the Colonial Laws Validity Act no longer applied to the British Dominions, including Canada.Statute of Westminster, 1931, (U.K.) 22 & 23 Geo. 5 c. 4, s. 2. However, it provided that Canada could not amend the British North America Act,Statute of Westminster, 1931, (U.K.) 22 & 23 Geo. 5 c. 4, s. 7. which remained subject to amendment only by the British Parliament. This provision maintained the supremacy of the British North America Act in Canadian law until the enactment of the Constitution Act, 1982. =Definition of the Constitution= Section 52(2) of the Constitution Act, 1982 defines the \\"Constitution of Canada.\\" The Constitution of Canada is said to include: ::(a) the Canada Act 1982 (which includes the Constitution Act, 1982 in Schedule B), ::(b) 30 Acts and Orders contained in the Schedule to the Constitution Act, 1982 (including, most significantly, the Constitution Act, 1867), and ::(c) any amendments which may have been made to any of the instruments in the first two categories. Section 52(2), in addition to containing many Imperial Statutes, contains eight Canadian statutes, three of which created the provinces of Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, and five of which were amendments to the Constitution Act, 1867. The Canadian courts have reserved the right to add and entrench principles and conventions into the Constitution unilaterally. Although a court's ability to recognize human rights not explicitly stated in a constitution is not particularly unusual, the Canadian situation is unique in that this ability extends to procedural issues not related to human rights. In particular, in New Brunswick Broadcasting Co v Nova Scotia (Speaker of the House of Assembly), the Supreme Court of Canada said that s. 52(2) was not an exhaustive listing of all that comprised the Constitution. The Court reserved the right to add unwritten principles to the Constitution, thereby entrenching them and granting them constitutional supremacy (in this case, they added parliamentary privilege to the Constitution). The Court did note, however, that the list of written documents was static and could not be modified except for through the amending formulas.. English and French versions Section 56 of the Act provides that the parts of the Constitution that were enacted in English and French are equally authoritative, and section 57 adds that the English and French versions of the Constitution Act, 1982 itself are equal. Section 57 is akin section 18 of the Charter, which provides that English and French versions of federal and New Brunswick statutes are equal.Bastarache, Michel, Andre Braen, Emmanuel Didier, and Pierre Foucher. 1987. Language Rights in Canada, edited by M. Bastarache, translated by Translation Devinat et Associ√©s. Montr√©al: Editions Yvon Blais. p. 103. The Supreme Court has interpreted section 133 of the Constitution Act, 1867 and section 23 of the Manitoba Act, 1870 to mean that the English and French versions of federal, Quebec and Manitoba statutes are equal.Quebec (Attorney General) v Blaikie, [1979] 2 SCR 1016.Reference re Manitoba Language Rights, [1985] 1 SCR 721. Despite sections 56 and 57, significant portions of the Constitution of Canada were only enacted in English and even if there exist unofficial French translations, their English versions alone have force of law. To address this problem, section 55 requires that the federal Minister of Justice prepare \\"a French version of the‚Ä¶Constitution of Canada as expeditiously as possible.\\" The Minister of Justice established a French Constitution Drafting Committee in 1984, which prepared French versions of the Constitution, and presented them to the Minister in 1990. Section 55 also requires that \\"when any portion thereof sufficient to warrant action being taken has been so prepared, it shall but put forward for enactment by proclamation issued by the Governor General under the Great Seal of Canada pursuant to the procedure then applicable to an amendment of the same provisions of the Constitution of Canada.\\" No action has been taken to put forward the French version for enactment. The reference to a proclamation by the Governor-General implies that some combination of the general, unanimity and special arrangements procedures would be required to enact the French version. Although the intention was presumably that the government of Canada would do so by introducing an amendment resolution in the House of Commons, a Senator or a provincial government could presumably do so since, under section 46, such amendments \\"may be initiated either by the Senate or the House of Commons or by the legislative assembly of a province\\".  Australia and New Zealand  The patriation of the Canadian constitution set an example for similar actions by Australia and New Zealand. In 1985 and 1986, the Australian and British parliaments passed the Australia Act 1986. The Australian High Court subsequently recognized that the Act established Australia as an independent country, making Britain a foreign power. New Zealand experienced a constitutional crisis in 1984, which led to a desire for constitutional reform. The New Zealand Parliament patriated its own constitution in the Constitution Act 1986. Unlike Canada, New Zealand already had the right to amend its own constitution, so there was no corresponding British legislation.

Oil sands are either loose sands or partially consolidated sandstone containing a naturally occurring mixture of sand, clay, and water, soaked with a dense and extremely viscous form of petroleum technically referred to as bitumen. Natural bitumen deposits are reported in many countries, but in particular are found in extremely large quantities in Canada. Other large reserves are located in Kazakhstan, Russia, and Venezuela. The estimated worldwide deposits of oil are more than ; the estimates include deposits that have not been discovered. Proven reserves of bitumen contain approximately 100 billion barrels, and total natural bitumen reserves are estimated at worldwide, of which , or 70.8%, are in Alberta, Canada. The crude bitumen contained in the Canadian oil sands is described by the National Energy Board of Canada as \\"a highly viscous mixture of hydrocarbons heavier than pentanes which, in its natural state, is not usually recoverable at a commercial rate through a well because it is too thick to flow.\\" Crude bitumen is a thick, sticky form of crude oil, so heavy and viscous (thick) that it will not flow unless heated or diluted with lighter hydrocarbons such as light crude oil or natural-gas condensate. At room temperature, it is much like cold molasses. The World Energy Council (WEC) defines natural bitumen as \\"oil having a viscosity greater than 10,000 centipoise under reservoir conditions and an API gravity of less than 10¬∞ API\\". The Orinoco Belt in Venezuela is sometimes described as oil sands, but these deposits are non-bituminous, falling instead into the category of heavy or extra-heavy oil due to their lower viscosity. Natural bitumen and extra- heavy oil differ in the degree by which they have been degraded from the original conventional oils by bacteria. According to the WEC, extra-heavy oil has \\"a gravity of less than 10¬∞ API and a reservoir viscosity of no more than 10,000 centipoise\\". The 1973 and 1979 oil crises, which resulting in a spike in the price of oil, as well as the development of improved technologies, such as steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), enabled profitable extraction and processing of the oil sands. Together with other so-called unconventional oil extraction practices, oil sands are implicated in the unburnable carbon debate but also contribute to energy security and counteract the international price cartel OPEC. According to the Oil Climate Index, carbon emissions from oil- sand crude are 31% higher than from conventional oil. In Canada, oil sands production in general, and in-situ extraction, in particular, are the largest contributors to the increase in the nation's GHG emissions from 2005 to 2017, according to Natural Resources Canada (NRCan). History The exploitation of bituminous deposits and seeps dates back to Paleolithic times. The earliest known use of bitumen was by Neanderthals, some 40,000 years ago. Bitumen has been found adhering to stone tools used by Neanderthals at sites in Syria. After the arrival of Homo sapiens, humans used bitumen for construction of buildings and waterproofing of reed boats, among other uses. In ancient Egypt, the use of bitumen was important in preparing mummies. In ancient times, bitumen was primarily a Mesopotamian commodity used by the Sumerians and Babylonians, although it was also found in the Levant and Persia. The area along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers was littered with hundreds of pure bitumen seepages. The Mesopotamians used the bitumen for waterproofing boats and buildings. In Europe, they were extensively mined near the French city of Pechelbronn, where the vapour separation process was in use in 1742. In Canada, the First Nation peoples had used bitumen from seeps along the Athabasca and Clearwater Rivers to waterproof their birch bark canoes from early prehistoric times. The Canadian oil sands first became known to Europeans in 1719 when a Cree native named Wa-Pa-Su brought a sample to Hudsons Bay Company fur trader Henry Kelsey, who commented on it in his journals. Fur trader Peter Pond paddled down the Clearwater River to Athabasca in 1778, saw the deposits and wrote of \\"springs of bitumen that flow along the ground.\\" In 1787, fur trader and explorer Alexander MacKenzie on his way to the Arctic Ocean saw the Athabasca oil sands, and commented, \\"At about 24 miles from the fork (of the Athabasca and Clearwater Rivers) are some bituminous fountains into which a pole of 20 feet long may be inserted without the least resistance.\\" Cost of oil sands petroleum-mining operations In their May 2019 comparison of the \\"cost of supply curve update\\" in which the Norway-based Rystad Energy‚Äîan \\"independent energy research and consultancy\\"‚Äîranked the \\"worlds total recoverable liquid resources by their breakeven price\\", Rystad reported that the average breakeven price for oil from the oil sands was US$83 in 2019, making it the most expensive to produce, compared to all other \\"significant oil producing regions\\" in the world. The International Energy Agency made similar comparisons. The price per barrel of heavier, sour crude oils lacking in tidewater access‚Äîsuch as Western Canadian Select (WCS) from the Athabaska oil sands, are priced at a differential to the lighter, sweeter oil‚Äîsuch as West Texas Intermediate (WTI). The price is based on its grade‚Äîdetermined by factors such as its specific gravity or API and its sulfur content‚Äîand its location‚Äîfor example, its proximity to tidewater and/or refineries. Because the cost of production is so much higher at oil sands petroleum-mining operations, the breakeven point is much higher than for sweeter lighter oils like that produced by Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, and, the United States. Oil sands productions expand and prosper as the global price of oil increased to peak highs because of the Arab oil embargo of 1973, the 1979 Iranian Revolution, the 1990 Persian Gulf crisis and war, the 11 September 2001 attacks, and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The boom periods were followed by the bust, as the global price of oil dropped during the 1980s and again in the 1990s, during a period of global recessions, and again in 2003. Nomenclature The name tar sands was applied to bituminous sands in the late 19th and early 20th century. People who saw the bituminous sands during this period were familiar with the large amounts of tar residue produced in urban areas as a by-product of the manufacture of coal gas for urban heating and lighting. The word \\"tar\\" to describe these natural bitumen deposits is really a misnomer, since, chemically speaking, tar is a human-made substance produced by the destructive distillation of organic material, usually coal. Since then, coal gas has almost completely been replaced by natural gas as a fuel, and coal tar as a material for paving roads has been replaced by the petroleum product asphalt. Naturally occurring bitumen is chemically more similar to asphalt than to coal tar, and the term oil sands (or oilsands) is more commonly used by industry in the producing areas than tar sands because synthetic oil is manufactured from the bitumen, and due to the feeling that the terminology of tar sands is less politically acceptable to the public. Oil sands are now an alternative to conventional crude oil. Geology The world's largest deposits of oil sands are in Venezuela and Canada. The geology of the deposits in the two countries is generally rather similar. They are vast heavy oil, extra-heavy oil, and/or bitumen deposits with oil heavier than 20¬∞API, found largely in unconsolidated sandstones with similar properties. \\"Unconsolidated\\" in this context means that the sands have high porosity, no significant cohesion, and a tensile strength close to zero. The sands are saturated with oil which has prevented them from consolidating into hard sandstone. =Size of resources= The magnitude of the resources in the two countries is on the order of 3.5 to 4 trillion barrels (550 to 650 billion cubic metres) of original oil in place (OOIP). Oil in place is not necessarily oil reserves, and the amount that can be produced depends on technological evolution. Rapid technological developments in Canada in the 1985‚Äì2000 period resulted in techniques such as steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) that can recover a much greater percentage of the OOIP than conventional methods. The Alberta government estimates that with current technology, 10% of its bitumen and heavy oil can be recovered, which would give it about 200 billion barrels (32 billion m3) of recoverable oil reserves. Venezuela estimates its recoverable oil at 267 billion barrels (42 billion m3). This places Canada and Venezuela in the same league as Saudi Arabia, having the three largest oil reserves in the world. = Major deposits = There are numerous deposits of oil sands in the world, but the biggest and most important are in Canada and Venezuela, with lesser deposits in Kazakhstan and Russia. The total volume of non-conventional oil in the oil sands of these countries exceeds the reserves of conventional oil in all other countries combined. Vast deposits of bitumen ‚Äì over 350 billion cubic metres (2.2 trillion barrels) of oil in place ‚Äì exist in the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. If only 30% of this oil could be extracted, it could supply the entire needs of North America for over 100 years at 2002 consumption levels. These deposits represent plentiful oil, but not cheap oil. They require advanced technology to extract the oil and transport it to oil refineries. Canada The oil sands of the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) are a result of the formation of the Canadian Rocky Mountains by the Pacific Plate overthrusting the North American Plate as it pushed in from the west, carrying the formerly large island chains which now comprise most of British Columbia. The collision compressed the Alberta plains and raised the Rockies above the plains, forming mountain ranges. This mountain building process buried the sedimentary rock layers which underlie most of Alberta to a great depth, creating high subsurface temperatures, and producing a giant pressure cooker effect that converted the kerogen in the deeply buried organic-rich shales to light oil and natural gas. These source rocks were similar to the American so-called oil shales, except the latter have never been buried deep enough to convert the kerogen in them into liquid oil. This overthrusting also tilted the pre-Cretaceous sedimentary rock formations underlying most of the sub-surface of Alberta, depressing the rock formations in southwest Alberta up to deep near the Rockies, but to zero depth in the northeast, where they pinched out against the igneous rocks of the Canadian Shield, which outcrop on the surface. This tilting is not apparent on the surface because the resulting trench has been filled in by eroded material from the mountains. The light oil migrated up-dip through hydro-dynamic transport from the Rockies in the southwest toward the Canadian Shield in the northeast following a complex pre-Cretaceous unconformity that exists in the formations under Alberta. The total distance of oil migration southwest to northeast was about . At the shallow depths of sedimentary formations in the northeast, massive microbial biodegradation as the oil approached the surface caused the oil to become highly viscous and immobile. Almost all of the remaining oil is found in the far north of Alberta, in Middle Cretaceous (115 million-year old) sand-silt-shale deposits overlain by thick shales, although large amounts of heavy oil lighter than bitumen are found in the Heavy Oil Belt along the Alberta-Saskatchewan border, extending into Saskatchewan and approaching the Montana border. Note that, although adjacent to Alberta, Saskatchewan has no massive deposits of bitumen, only large reservoirs of heavy oil >10¬∞API. Most of the Canadian oil sands are in three major deposits in northern Alberta. They are the Athabasca-Wabiskaw oil sands of north northeastern Alberta, the Cold Lake deposits of east northeastern Alberta, and the Peace River deposits of northwestern Alberta. Between them, they cover over ‚Äîan area larger than England‚Äîand contain approximately of crude bitumen in them. About 10% of the oil in place, or , is estimated by the government of Alberta to be recoverable at current prices, using current technology, which amounts to 97% of Canadian oil reserves and 75% of total North American petroleum reserves. Although the Athabasca deposit is the only one in the world which has areas shallow enough to mine from the surface, all three Alberta areas are suitable for production using in-situ methods, such as cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) and steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). The largest Canadian oil sands deposit, the Athabasca oil sands is in the McMurray Formation, centered on the city of Fort McMurray, Alberta. It outcrops on the surface (zero burial depth) about north of Fort McMurray, where enormous oil sands mines have been established, but is deep southeast of Fort McMurray. Only 3% of the oil sands area containing about 20% of the recoverable oil can be produced by surface mining, so the remaining 80% will have to be produced using in-situ wells. The other Canadian deposits are between deep and will require in-situ production. =Athabasca= The City of Fort McMurray on the banks of the Athabasca River The Athabasca oil sands lie along the Athabasca River and are the largest natural bitumen deposit in the world, containing about 80% of the Alberta total, and the only one suitable for surface mining, according to a 2009 Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers publication. With modern unconventional oil production technology, at least 10% of these deposits, or about are considered to be economically recoverable, making Canada's total proven reserves the third largest in the world, after Saudi Arabia's conventional oil and Venezuela's Orinoco oil sands. In Canada, the benchmark of Canadian heavy oils is Western Canada Select (WCS), which is a \\"blend of conventionally produced heavy oils and bitumen, blended with diluent (condensate)\\". WCS typically trades at a differential below the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (WTI) benchmark price for crude oil. The Athabasca oil sands are more or less centered around the remote northern city of Fort McMurray. They are by far the largest deposit of bitumen in Canada, probably containing over 150 billion cubic metres (900 billion barrels) of oil in place. The bitumen is highly viscous and is often denser than water (10¬∞API or 1000 kg/m3). The oil saturated sands range from thick in places, and the oil saturation in the oil-rich zones is on the order of 90% bitumen by weight. The Athabasca River cuts through the heart of the deposit, and traces of the heavy oil are readily observed as black stains on the river banks. Since portions of the Athabasca sands are shallow enough to be surface- mineable, they were the earliest ones to see development. Historically, the bitumen was used by the indigenous Cree and Dene Aboriginal peoples to waterproof their canoes. The Athabasca oil sands first came to the attention of European fur traders in 1719 when Wa-pa-su, a Cree trader, brought a sample of bituminous sands to the Hudson's Bay Company post at York Factory on Hudson Bay. Oil sands on the banks of the Athabasca River, c. 1900 In 1778, Peter Pond, a fur trader for the rival North West Company, was the first European to see the Athabasca deposits. In 1788, fur trader and explorer Alexander Mackenzie from the Hudson Bay Company, who later discovered the Mackenzie River and routes to both the Arctic and Pacific Oceans, described the oil sands in great detail. He said, \\"At about from the fork (of the Athabasca and Clearwater Rivers) are some bituminous fountains into which a pole of long may be inserted without the least resistance. The bitumen is in a fluid state and when mixed with gum, the resinous substance collected from the spruce fir, it serves to gum the Indians' canoes.\\" In 1883, G.C. Hoffman of the Geological Survey of Canada tried separating the bitumen from oil sand with the use of water and reported that it separated readily. In 1888, Robert Bell of the Geological Survey of Canada reported to a Senate Committee that \\"The evidence ... points to the existence in the Athabasca and Mackenzie valleys of the most extensive petroleum field in America, if not the world.\\" In 1926, Karl Clark of the University of Alberta patented a hot water separation process which was the forerunner of today's thermal extraction processes. However, it was 1967 before the first large scale commercial operation began with the opening of the Great Canadian Oil Sands mine by the Sun Oil Company of Ohio. The commercial possibilities of Canada's vast oil sands were realized early by Canadian government researchers. In 1884, Robert Bell of the Geological Survey of Canada commented, \\"The banks of the Athabasca would furnish an inexhaustible supply of fuel... the material occurs in such enormous quantities that a profitable means of extracting oil...may be found\\". In 1915, Sidney Ells of the Federal Mines Branch experimented with separation techniques and used the material to pave of road in Edmonton as well as in other places. In 1920, chemist Karl Clark of the Alberta Research Council began experimenting with methods to extract bitumen from the oil sands and in 1928 he patented the first commercial hot water separation process. Commercial development began in 1923 when businessman Robert Fitzsimmons began drilling oil wells at Bitumount, north of Fort McMurray but obtained disappointing results with conventional drilling. In 1927 he formed the International Bitumen Company and in 1930 built a small hot-water separation plant based on Clark's design. He produced about of bitumen in 1930 and shipped it by barge and rail to Edmonton. The bitumen from the mine had numerous uses but most of it was used to waterproof roofs. Costs were too high and Fitzsimmons went bankrupt. In 1941 the company was renamed Oil Sands Limited and attempted to iron out technical problems but was never very successful. It went through several changes of ownership and in 1958 closed down permanently. In 1974 Bitumount became an Alberta Provincial Historic Site. In 1930 businessman Max Ball formed Canadian Oil Sand Product, Ltd, which later became Abasand Oils. He built a separation plant capable of handling 250 tons of oil sands per day which opened in 1936 and produced an average of of oil. The plant burned down in late 1941 but was rebuilt in 1942 with even larger capacity. In 1943 the Canadian government took control of the Abasand plant under the War Measures Act and planned to expand it further. However, in 1945 the plant burned down again and in 1946 the Canadian government abandoned the project because the need for fuel had diminished with the end of the war. The Abasand site is also an Alberta Historic Site. Today its successor company, Suncor Energy (no longer affiliated with Sun Oil), is the largest oil company in Canada. In addition, other companies such as Royal Dutch Shell, ExxonMobil, and various national oil companies are developing the Athabasca oil sands. As a result, Canada is now by far the largest exporter of oil to the United States. The smaller Wabasca (or Wabiskaw) oil sands lie above the western edge of the Athabasca oil sands and overlap them. They probably contain over 15 billion cubic metres (90 billion barrels) of oil in place. The deposit is buried from deep and ranges from thick. In many regions the oil-rich Wabasca formation overlies the similarly oil-rich McMurray formation, and as a result the two overlapping oil sands are often treated as one oil sands deposit. However, the two deposits are invariable separated by a minimum of of clay shale and silt. The bitumen in the Wabasca is as highly viscous as that in the Athabasca, but lies too deep to be surface-mined, so in-situ production methods must be used to produce the crude bitumen. =Cold Lake= Cold Lake viewed from Meadow Lake Provincial Park, Saskatchewan The Cold Lake oil sands are northeast of Alberta's capital, Edmonton, near the border with Saskatchewan. A small portion of the Cold Lake deposit lies in Saskatchewan. Although smaller than the Athabasca oil sands, the Cold Lake oil sands are important because some of the oil is fluid enough to be extracted by conventional methods. The Cold Lake bitumen contains more alkanes and less asphaltenes than the other major Alberta oil sands and the oil is more fluid. As a result, cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) is commonly used for production. The Cold Lake oil sands are of a roughly circular shape, centered around Bonnyville, Alberta. They probably contain over 60 billion cubic metres (370 billion barrels) of extra- heavy oil-in-place. The oil is highly viscous, but considerably less so than the Athabasca oil sands, and is somewhat less sulfurous. The depth of the deposits is and they are from thick. They are too deep to surface mine. Much of the oil sands are on Canadian Forces Base Cold Lake. CFB Cold Lake's CF-18 Hornet jet fighters defend the western half of Canadian air space and cover Canada's Arctic territory. Cold Lake Air Weapons Range (CLAWR) is one of the largest live-drop bombing ranges in the world, including testing of cruise missiles. As oil sands production continues to grow, various sectors vie for access to airspace, land, and resources, and this complicates oil well drilling and production significantly. =Peace River= Peace River The Peace River oil sands located in northwest-central Alberta are the smallest of the three major oil sands deposits in Alberta. The Peace River oil sands lie generally in the watershed of the Peace River, the largest river in Alberta. The Peace and Athabasca rivers, which are by far the largest rivers in Alberta, flow through their respective oil sands and merge at Lake Athabasca to form the Slave River, which flows into the MacKenzie River, one of the largest rivers in the world. All of the water from these rivers flow into the Arctic Ocean. The Peace River oil sands probably contain over 30 billion cubic metres (200 billion barrels) of oil-in-place. The thickness of the deposit ranges from and it is buried about deep. Whereas the Athabasca oil sands lie close enough to the surface that the bitumen can be excavated in open-pit mines, the smaller Peace River deposits are too deep, and must be exploited using in situ methods such as steam-assisted gravity drainage and Cold Heavy Oil Production with Sand (CHOPS). Venezuela The Eastern Venezuelan Basin has a structure similar to the WCSB, but on a shorter scale. The distance the oil has migrated up-dip from the Sierra Orientale mountain front to the Orinoco oil sands where it pinches out against the igneous rocks of the Guyana Shield is only about . The hydrodynamic conditions of oil transport were similar, source rocks buried deep by the rise of the mountains of the Sierra Orientale produced light oil that moved up-dip toward the south until it was gradually immobilized by the viscosity increase caused by biodgradation near the surface. The Orinoco deposits are early Tertiary (50 to 60 million years old) sand-silt-shale sequences overlain by continuous thick shales, much like the Canadian deposits. In Venezuela, the Orinoco Belt oil sands range from deep and no surface outcrops exist. The deposit is about long east-to- west and wide north-to-south, much less than the combined area covered by the Canadian deposits. In general, the Canadian deposits are found over a much wider area, have a broader range of properties, and have a broader range of reservoir types than the Venezuelan ones, but the geological structures and mechanisms involved are similar. The main differences is that the oil in the sands in Venezuela is less viscous than in Canada, allowing some of it to be produced by conventional drilling techniques, but none of it approaches the surface as in Canada, meaning none of it can be produced using surface mining. The Canadian deposits will almost all have to be produced by mining or using new non-conventional techniques. =Orinoco= Panorama of the Orinoco River The Orinoco Belt is a territory in the southern strip of the eastern Orinoco River Basin in Venezuela which overlies one of the world's largest deposits of petroleum. The Orinoco Belt follows the line of the river. It is approximately from east to west, and from north to south, with an area about . The oil sands consist of large deposits of extra heavy crude. Venezuela's heavy oil deposits of about of oil in place are estimated to approximately equal the world's reserves of lighter oil. Petr√≥leos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), Venezuela's national oil company, has estimated that the producible reserves of the Orinoco Belt are up to which would make it the largest petroleum reserve in the world. In 2009, the US Geological Survey (USGS) increased its estimates of the reserves to of oil which is \\"technically recoverable (producible using currently available technology and industry practices).\\" No estimate of how much of the oil is economically recoverable was made. =Other deposits= Location of Melville Island In addition to the three major Canadian oil sands in Alberta, there is a fourth major oil sands deposit in Canada, the Melville Island oil sands in the Canadian Arctic islands, which are too remote to expect commercial production in the foreseeable future. Apart from the megagiant oil sands deposits in Canada and Venezuela, numerous other countries hold smaller oil sands deposits. In the United States, there are supergiant oil sands resources primarily concentrated in Eastern Utah, with a total of of oil (known and potential) in eight major deposits in Carbon, Garfield, Grand, Uintah, and Wayne counties. In addition to being much smaller than the Canadian oil sands deposits, the US oil sands are hydrocarbon-wet, whereas the Canadian oil sands are water-wet. This requires somewhat different extraction techniques for the Utah oil sands than those used for the Alberta oil sands. Russia holds oil sands in two main regions. Large resources are present in the Tunguska Basin, East Siberia, with the largest deposits being Olenek and Siligir. Other deposits are located in the Timan-Pechora and Volga-Urals basins (in and around Tatarstan), which is an important but very mature province in terms of conventional oil, holds large amounts of oil sands in a shallow permian formation. In Kazakhstan, large bitumen deposits are located in the North Caspian Basin. In Madagascar, Tsimiroro and Bemolanga are two heavy oil sands deposits, with a pilot well already producing small amounts of oil in Tsimiroro. and larger scale exploitation in the early planning phase. In the Republic of the Congo reserves are estimated between . Production Bituminous sands are a major source of unconventional oil, although only Canada has a large-scale commercial oil sands industry. In 2006, bitumen production in Canada averaged through 81 oil sands projects. 44% of Canadian oil production in 2007 was from oil sands. This proportion was (as of 2008) expected to increase in coming decades as bitumen production grows while conventional oil production declines, although due to the 2008 economic downturn work on new projects has been deferred. Petroleum is not produced from oil sands on a significant level in other countries. =Canada= The Alberta oil sands have been in commercial production since the original Great Canadian Oil Sands (now Suncor Energy) mine began operation in 1967. Syncrude's second mine began operation in 1978 and is the biggest mine of any type in the world. The third mine in the Athabasca Oil Sands, the Albian Sands consortium of Shell Canada, Chevron Corporation, and Western Oil Sands Inc. [purchased by Marathon Oil Corporation in 2007] began operation in 2003. Petro-Canada was also developing a $33 billion Fort Hills Project, in partnership with UTS Energy Corporation and Teck Cominco, which lost momentum after the 2009 merger of Petro-Canada into Suncor. By 2013 there were nine oil sands mining projects in the Athabasca oil sands deposit: Suncor Energy Inc. (Suncor), Syncrude Canada Limited (Syncrude)'s Mildred Lake and Aurora North, Shell Canada Limited (Shell)'s Muskeg River and Jackpine, Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNRL)'s Horizon, Imperial Oil Resources Ventures Limited (Imperial), Kearl Oil Sands Project (KOSP), Total E&P; Canada Ltd. Joslyn North Mine and Fort Hills Energy Corporation (FHEC). In 2011 alone they produced over 52 million cubic metres of bitumen. =Venezuela= No significant development of Venezuela's extra- heavy oil deposits was undertaken before 2000, except for the BITOR operation which produced somewhat less than 100,000 barrels of oil per day (16,000 m3/d) of 9¬∞API oil by primary production. This was mostly shipped as an emulsion (Orimulsion) of 70% oil and 30% water with similar characteristics as heavy fuel oil for burning in thermal power plants. However, when a major strike hit the Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA, most of the engineers were fired as punishment. Orimulsion had been the pride of the PDVSA engineers, so Orimulsion fell out of favor with the key political leaders. As a result, the government has been trying to \\"Wind Down\\" the Orimulsion program. Despite the fact that the Orinoco oil sands contain extra-heavy oil which is easier to produce than Canada's similarly sized reserves of bitumen, Venezuela's oil production has been declining in recent years because of the country's political and economic problems, while Canada's has been increasing. As a result, Canadian heavy oil and bitumen exports have been backing Venezuelan heavy and extra-heavy oil out of the US market, and Canada's total exports of oil to the US have become several times as great as Venezuela's. By 2016, with the economy of Venezuela in a tailspin and the country experiencing widespread shortages of food, rolling power blackouts, rioting, and anti-government protests, it was unclear how much new oil sands production would occur in the near future. = Other countries = In May 2008, the Italian oil company Eni announced a project to develop a small oil sands deposit in the Republic of the Congo. Production is scheduled to commence in 2014 and is estimated to eventually yield a total of . Methods of extraction Except for a fraction of the extra-heavy oil or bitumen which can be extracted by conventional oil well technology, oil sands must be produced by strip mining or the oil made to flow into wells using sophisticated in-situ techniques. These methods usually use more water and require larger amounts of energy than conventional oil extraction. While much of Canada's oil sands are being produced using open-pit mining, approximately 90% of Canadian oil sands and all of Venezuela's oil sands are too far below the surface to use surface mining. =Primary production= Conventional crude oil is normally extracted from the ground by drilling oil wells into a petroleum reservoir, allowing oil to flow into them under natural reservoir pressures, although artificial lift and techniques such as horizontal drilling, water flooding and gas injection are often required to maintain production. When primary production is used in the Venezuelan oil sands, where the extra-heavy oil is about 50 degrees Celsius, the typical oil recovery rates are about 8‚Äì12%. Canadian oil sands are much colder and more biodegraded, so bitumen recovery rates are usually only about 5‚Äì6%. Historically, primary recovery was used in the more fluid areas of Canadian oil sands. However, it recovered only a small fraction of the oil in place, so it is not often used today. =Surface mining= Mining operations in the Athabasca oil sands. NASA Earth Observatory image, 2009. The Athabasca oil sands are the only major oil sands deposits which are shallow enough to surface mine. In the Athabasca sands there are very large amounts of bitumen covered by little overburden, making surface mining the most efficient method of extracting it. The overburden consists of water-laden muskeg (peat bog) over top of clay and barren sand. The oil sands themselves are typically thick deposits of crude bitumen embedded in unconsolidated sandstone, sitting on top of flat limestone rock. Since Great Canadian Oil Sands (now Suncor Energy) started operation of the first large-scale oil sands mine in 1967, bitumen has been extracted on a commercial scale and the volume has grown at a steady rate ever since. A large number of oil sands mines are currently in operation and more are in the stages of approval or development. The Syncrude Canada mine was the second to open in 1978, Shell Canada opened its Muskeg River mine (Albian Sands) in 2003 and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd (CNRL) opened its Horizon Oil Sands project in 2009. Newer mines include Shell Canada's Jackpine mine, Imperial Oil's Kearl Oil Sands Project, the Synenco Energy (now owned by Total S.A.) Northern Lights mine, and Suncor's Fort Hills mine. Oil sands tailings ponds  Syncrude's Mildred Lake site, plant and tailings ponds Fort McMurray, Alberta Oil sands tailings ponds are engineered dam and dyke systems that contain salts, suspended solids and other dissolvable chemical compounds such as naphthenic acids, benzene, hydrocarbons residual bitumen, fine silts (mature fine tails MFT), and water. Large volumes of tailings are a byproduct of surface mining of the oil sands and managing these tailings is one of the most difficult environmental challenges facing the oil sands industry. The Government of Alberta reported in 2013 that tailings ponds in the Alberta oil sands covered an area of about . The Syncrude Tailings Dam or Mildred Lake Settling Basin (MLSB) is an embankment dam that is, by volume of construction material, the largest earth structure in the world in 2001. =Cold Heavy Oil Production with Sand (CHOPS)= Some years ago Canadian oil companies discovered that if they removed the sand filters from heavy oil wells and produced as much sand as possible with the oil, production rates improved significantly. This technique became known as Cold Heavy Oil Production with Sand (CHOPS). Further research disclosed that pumping out sand opened \\"wormholes\\" in the sand formation which allowed more oil to reach the wellbore. The advantage of this method is better production rates and recovery (around 10% versus 5‚Äì6% with sand filters in place) and the disadvantage that disposing of the produced sand is a problem. A novel way to do this was spreading it on rural roads, which rural governments liked because the oily sand reduced dust and the oil companies did their road maintenance for them. However, governments have become concerned about the large volume and composition of oil spread on roads. so in recent years disposing of oily sand in underground salt caverns has become more common. =Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS)= The use of steam injection to recover heavy oil has been in use in the oil fields of California since the 1950s. The cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) \\"huff-and-puff\\" method is now widely used in heavy oil production worldwide due to its quick early production rates; however recovery factors are relatively low (10‚Äì40% of oil in place) compared to SAGD (60‚Äì70% of OIP). CSS has been in use by Imperial Oil at Cold Lake since 1985 and is also used by Canadian Natural Resources at Primrose and Wolf Lake and by Shell Canada at Peace River. In this method, the well is put through cycles of steam injection, soak, and oil production. First, steam is injected into a well at a temperature of 300 to 340 degrees Celsius for a period of weeks to months; then, the well is allowed to sit for days to weeks to allow heat to soak into the formation; and, later, the hot oil is pumped out of the well for a period of weeks or months. Once the production rate falls off, the well is put through another cycle of injection, soak and production. This process is repeated until the cost of injecting steam becomes higher than the money made from producing oil. =Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD)= Steam assisted gravity drainage was developed in the 1980s by the Alberta Oil Sands Technology and Research Authority and fortuitously coincided with improvements in directional drilling technology that made it quick and inexpensive to do by the mid 1990s. In SAGD, two horizontal wells are drilled in the oil sands, one at the bottom of the formation and another about 5 metres above it. These wells are typically drilled in groups off central pads and can extend for miles in all directions. In each well pair, steam is injected into the upper well, the heat melts the bitumen, which allows it to flow into the lower well, where it is pumped to the surface. SAGD has proved to be a major breakthrough in production technology since it is cheaper than CSS, allows very high oil production rates, and recovers up to 60% of the oil in place. Because of its economic feasibility and applicability to a vast area of oil sands, this method alone quadrupled North American oil reserves and allowed Canada to move to second place in world oil reserves after Saudi Arabia. Most major Canadian oil companies now have SAGD projects in production or under construction in Alberta's oil sands areas and in Wyoming. Examples include Japan Canada Oil Sands Ltd's (JACOS) project, Suncor's Firebag project, Nexen's Long Lake project, Suncor's (formerly Petro-Canada's) MacKay River project, Husky Energy's Tucker Lake and Sunrise projects, Shell Canada's Peace River project, Cenovus Energy's Foster Creek and Christina Lake developments, ConocoPhillips' Surmont project, Devon Canada's Jackfish project, and Derek Oil & Gas's LAK Ranch project. Alberta's OSUM Corp has combined proven underground mining technology with SAGD to enable higher recovery rates by running wells underground from within the oil sands deposit, thus also reducing energy requirements compared to traditional SAGD. This particular technology application is in its testing phase. =Vapor Extraction (VAPEX)= Several methods use solvents, instead of steam, to separate bitumen from sand. Some solvent extraction methods may work better in in situ production and other in mining. Solvent can be beneficial if it produces more oil while requiring less energy to produce steam. Vapor Extraction Process (VAPEX) is an in situ technology, similar to SAGD. Instead of steam, hydrocarbon solvents are injected into an upper well to dilute bitumen and enables the diluted bitumen to flow into a lower well. It has the advantage of much better energy efficiency over steam injection, and it does some partial upgrading of bitumen to oil right in the formation. The process has attracted attention from oil companies, who are experimenting with it. The above methods are not mutually exclusive. It is becoming common for wells to be put through one CSS injection-soak-production cycle to condition the formation prior to going to SAGD production, and companies are experimenting with combining VAPEX with SAGD to improve recovery rates and lower energy costs. = Toe to Heel Air Injection (THAI) = This is a very new and experimental method that combines a vertical air injection well with a horizontal production well. The process ignites oil in the reservoir and creates a vertical wall of fire moving from the \\"toe\\" of the horizontal well toward the \\"heel\\", which burns the heavier oil components and upgrades some of the heavy bitumen into lighter oil right in the formation. Historically fireflood projects have not worked out well because of difficulty in controlling the flame front and a propensity to set the producing wells on fire. However, some oil companies feel the THAI method will be more controllable and practical, and have the advantage of not requiring energy to create steam. Advocates of this method of extraction state that it uses less freshwater, produces 50% less greenhouse gases, and has a smaller footprint than other production techniques. Petrobank Energy and Resources has reported encouraging results from their test wells in Alberta, with production rates of up to per well, and the oil upgraded from 8 to 12 API degrees. The company hopes to get a further 7-degree upgrade from its CAPRI (controlled atmospheric pressure resin infusion) system, which pulls the oil through a catalyst lining the lower pipe. After several years of production in situ, it has become clear that current THAI methods do not work as planned. Amid steady drops in production from their THAI wells at Kerrobert, Petrobank has written down the value of their THAI patents and the reserves at the facility to zero. They have plans to experiment with a new configuration they call \\"multi-THAI,\\" involving adding more air injection wells. =Combustion Overhead Gravity Drainage (COGD)= This is an experimental method that employs a number of vertical air injection wells above a horizontal production well located at the base of the bitumen pay zone. An initial Steam Cycle similar to CSS is used to prepare the bitumen for ignition and mobility. Following that cycle, air is injected into the vertical wells, igniting the upper bitumen and mobilizing (through heating) the lower bitumen to flow into the production well. It is expected that COGD will result in water savings of 80% compared to SAGD. Froth treatment Froth treatment converts bitumen into diluted bitumen, a marketable product.  Energy balance  Approximately of energy is needed to extract a barrel of bitumen and upgrade it to synthetic crude. As of 2006, most of this is produced by burning natural gas. Since a barrel of oil equivalent is about , its EROEI is 5‚Äì6. That means this extracts about 5 or 6 times as much energy as is consumed. Energy efficiency is expected to improve to an average of of natural gas or of energy per barrel by 2015, giving an EROEI of about 6.5. Alternatives to natural gas exist and are available in the oil sands area. Bitumen can itself be used as the fuel, consuming about 30‚Äì35% of the raw bitumen per produced unit of synthetic crude. Nexen's Long Lake project will use a proprietary deasphalting technology to upgrade the bitumen, using asphaltene residue fed to a gasifier whose syngas will be used by a cogeneration turbine and a hydrogen producing unit, providing all the energy needs of the project: steam, hydrogen, and electricity. Thus, it will produce syncrude without consuming natural gas, but the capital cost is very high. Shortages of natural gas for project fuel were forecast to be a problem for Canadian oil sands production a few years ago, but recent increases in US shale gas production have eliminated much of the problem for North America. With the increasing use of hydraulic fracturing making US largely self-sufficient in natural gas and exporting more natural gas to Eastern Canada to replace Alberta gas, the Alberta government is using its powers under the NAFTA and the Canadian Constitution to reduce shipments of natural gas to the US and Eastern Canada, and divert the gas to domestic Alberta use, particularly for oil sands fuel. The natural gas pipelines to the east and south are being converted to carry increasing oil sands production to these destinations instead of gas. Canada also has huge undeveloped shale gas deposits in addition to those of the US, so natural gas for future oil sands production does not seem to be a serious problem. The low price of natural gas as the result of new production has considerably improved the economics of oil sands production. Upgrading and/or blending The extra-heavy crude oil or crude bitumen extracted from oil sands is a very viscous semisolid form of oil that does not easily flow at normal temperatures, making it difficult to transport to market by pipeline. To flow through oil pipelines, it must either be upgraded to lighter synthetic crude oil (SCO), blended with diluents to form dilbit, or heated to reduce its viscosity. =Canada= In the Canadian oil sands, bitumen produced by surface mining is generally upgraded on-site and delivered as synthetic crude oil. This makes delivery of oil to market through conventional oil pipelines quite easy. On the other hand, bitumen produced by the in-situ projects is generally not upgraded but delivered to market in raw form. If the agent used to upgrade the bitumen to synthetic crude is not produced on site, it must be sourced elsewhere and transported to the site of upgrading. If the upgraded crude is being transported from the site by pipeline, and additional pipeline will be required to bring in sufficient upgrading agent. The costs of production of the upgrading agent, the pipeline to transport it and the cost to operate the pipeline must be calculated into the production cost of the synthetic crude. Upon reaching a refinery, the synthetic crude is processed and a significant portion of the upgrading agent will be removed during the refining process. It may be used for other fuel fractions, but the end result is that liquid fuel has to be piped to the upgrading facility simply to make the bitumen transportable by pipeline. If all costs are considered, synthetic crude production and transfer using bitumen and an upgrading agent may prove economically unsustainable. When the first oil sands plants were built over 50 years ago, most oil refineries in their market area were designed to handle light or medium crude oil with lower sulfur content than the 4‚Äì7% that is typically found in bitumen. The original oil sands upgraders were designed to produce a high- quality synthetic crude oil (SCO) with lower density and lower sulfur content. These are large, expensive plants which are much like heavy oil refineries. Research is currently being done on designing simpler upgraders which do not produce SCO but simply treat the bitumen to reduce its viscosity, allowing to be transported unblended like conventional heavy oil. Western Canadian Select, launched in 2004 as a new heavy oil stream, blended at the Husky Energy terminal in Hardisty, Alberta, is the largest crude oil stream coming from the Canadian oil sands and the benchmark for emerging heavy, high TAN (acidic) crudes. Western Canadian Select (WCS) is traded at Cushing, Oklahoma, a major oil supply hub connecting oil suppliers to the Gulf Coast, which has become the most significant trading hub for crude oil in North America. While its major component is bitumen, it also contains a combination of sweet synthetic and condensate diluents, and 25 existing streams of both conventional and unconventional oil making it a syndilbit‚Äî both a dilbit and a synbit. The first step in upgrading is vacuum distillation to separate the lighter fractions. After that, de-asphalting is used to separate the asphalt from the feedstock. Cracking is used to break the heavier hydrocarbon molecules down into simpler ones. Since cracking produces products which are rich in sulfur, desulfurization must be done to get the sulfur content below 0.5% and create sweet, light synthetic crude oil. In 2012, Alberta produced about of crude bitumen from its three major oil sands deposits, of which about was upgraded to lighter products and the rest sold as raw bitumen. The volume of both upgraded and non-upgraded bitumen is increasing yearly. Alberta has five oil sands upgraders producing a variety of products. These include: * Suncor Energy can upgrade of bitumen to light sweet and medium sour synthetic crude oil (SCO), plus produce diesel fuel for its oil sands operations at the upgrader. * Syncrude can upgrade of bitumen to sweet light SCO. * Canadian Natural Resources Limited (CNRL) can upgrade of bitumen to sweet light SCO. * Nexen, since 2013 wholly owned by China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), can upgrade of bitumen to sweet light SCO. * Shell Canada operates its Scotford Upgrader in combination with an oil refinery and chemical plant at Scotford, Alberta, near Edmonton. The complex can upgrade of bitumen to sweet and heavy SCO as well as a range of refinery and chemical products. Modernized and new large refineries such as are found in the Midwestern United States and on the Gulf Coast of the United States, as well as many in China, can handle upgrading heavy oil themselves, so their demand is for non-upgraded bitumen and extra-heavy oil rather than SCO. The main problem is that the feedstock would be too viscous to flow through pipelines, so unless it is delivered by tanker or rail car, it must be blended with diluent to enable it to flow. This requires mixing the crude bitumen with a lighter hydrocarbon diluent such as condensate from gas wells, pentanes and other light products from oil refineries or gas plants, or synthetic crude oil from oil sands upgraders to allow it to flow through pipelines to market. Typically, blended bitumen contains about 30% natural gas condensate or other diluents and 70% bitumen. Alternatively, bitumen can also be delivered to market by specially designed railway tank cars, tank trucks, liquid cargo barges, or ocean-going oil tankers. These do not necessarily require the bitumen be blended with diluent since the tanks can be heated to allow the oil to be pumped out. The demand for condensate for oil sands diluent is expected to be more than by 2020, double 2012 volumes. Since Western Canada only produces about of condensate, the supply was expected to become a major constraint on bitumen transport. However, the recent huge increase in US tight oil production has largely solved this problem, because much of the production is too light for US refinery use but ideal for diluting bitumen. The surplus American condensate and light oil is being exported to Canada and blended with bitumen, and then re-imported to the US as feedstock for refineries. Since the diluent is simply exported and then immediately re-imported, it is not subject to the US ban on exports of crude oil. Once it is back in the US, refineries separate the diluent and re-export it to Canada, which again bypasses US crude oil export laws since it is now a refinery product. To aid in this process, Kinder Morgan Energy Partners is reversing its Cochin Pipeline, which used to carry propane from Edmonton to Chicago, to transport of condensate from Chicago to Edmonton by mid-2014; and Enbridge is considering the expansion of its Southern Lights pipeline, which currently ships of diluent from the Chicago area to Edmonton, by adding another . =Venezuela= Although Venezuelan extra-heavy oil is less viscous than Canadian bitumen, much of the difference is due to temperature. Once the oil comes out of the ground and cools, it has the same difficulty in that it is too viscous to flow through pipelines. Venezuela is now producing more extra heavy crude in the Orinoco oil sands than its four upgraders, which were built by foreign oil companies over a decade ago, can handle. The upgraders have a combined capacity of , which is only half of its production of extra-heavy oil. In addition Venezuela produces insufficient volumes of naphtha to use as diluent to move extra-heavy oil to market. Unlike Canada, Venezuela does not produce much natural gas condensate from its own gas wells, and unlike Canada, it does not have easy access to condensate from new US shale gas production. Since Venezuela also has insufficient refinery capacity to supply its domestic market, supplies of naptha are insufficient to use as pipeline diluent, and it is having to import naptha to fill the gap. Since Venezuela also has financial problems ‚Äì as a result of the country's economic crisis -, and political disagreements with the US government and oil companies, the situation remains unresolved. Transportation A network of gathering and feeder pipelines collects crude bitumen and SCO from Alberta's northern oil sands deposits (primarily Athabasca, Cold Lake, and Peace River), and feeds them into two main collection points for southbound deliveries: Edmonton, Alberta and Hardisty, Alberta. Most of the feeder pipelines move blended bitumen or SCO southbound and diluent northbound, but a few move product laterally within the oil sands region. In 2012, the capacity of the southbound feeder lines was over 300,000 m¬≥/d (2 million bbl/d) and more capacity was being added. The building of new oil sands feeder pipelines requires only the approval of the Alberta Energy Regulator, an agency that deals with matters entirely within Alberta and is likely to give little consideration to interference from political and environmental interest from outside Alberta. =Existing pipelines= From Edmonton and Hardisty, main transmission pipelines move blended bitumen and SCO, as well as conventional crude oil and various oil and natural productions to market destinations across North America. The main transmission systems include: * Enbridge has a complex existing system of pipelines that takes crude oil from Edmonton and Hardisty east to Montreal and south as far as the Gulf Coast of the United States, with a total capacity of . It also has a northbound pipeline that takes diluent from refineries in Illinois and other Midwestern states to Edmonton with a capacity of of light hydrocarbons. * Kinder Morgan has the Trans Mountain Pipeline that takes crude oil from Edmonton over the Rocky Mountains to the west coasts of British Columbia and Washington State, with an existing capacity of . It has plans to add an additional of capacity to this pipeline within the existing pipeline easement. * Spectra Energy has a system of pipelines that takes crude oil from Hardisty south to Casper, Wyoming and then east to Wood River, Illinois. The first segment has a capacity of and the second segment . * TransCanada Corporation has the Keystone Pipeline system. Phase 1 currently takes crude oil from Hardisty south to Steele City, Nebraska and then east to Wood River, Illinois. The existing Phase 2 moves crude oil from Steele City to the main US oil marketing hub at Cushing, Oklahoma. Phases 1 and 2 have a combined capacity of . Overall, the total pipeline capacity for the movement of crude oil from Edmonton and Hardisty to the rest of North America is about . However, other substances such as conventional crude oil and refined petroleum products also share this pipeline network. The rapidly increasing tight oil production from the Bakken formation of North Dakota also competes for space on the Canadian export pipeline system. North Dakota oil producers are using the Canadian pipelines to deliver their oil to US refineries. In 2012, the Canadian export pipeline system began to become overloaded with new oil production. As a result, Enbridge implemented pipeline apportionment on its southbound lines, and Kinder Morgan on its westbound line. This rationed pipeline space by reducing the monthly allocation of each shipper to a certain percentage of its requirements. The Chevron Corporation Burnaby Refinery, the last remaining oil refinery on Canada's west coast, applied to the NEB for preferential access to Canadian oil since American refineries in Washington and California were outbidding it for pipeline space, but was denied because it would violate NAFTA equal access to energy rules. Similarly, new North Dakota tight oil production began to block new Canadian production from using the Enbridge, Kinder Morgan, and TransCanada southbound systems. In addition, the US oil marketing hub at Cushing was flooded with new oil because most new North American production from Canada, North Dakota, and Texas converged at that point, and there was insufficient capacity to take it from there to refineries on the Gulf Coast, where half of US oil refinery capacity is located. The American pipeline system is designed to take imported oil from the Gulf Coast and Texas to the refineries in the northern US, and the new oil was flowing in the opposite direction, toward the Gulf Coast. The price of West Texas Intermediate delivered at Cushing, which is the main benchmark for US oil prices, fell to unprecedented low levels below other international benchmark oils such as Brent Crude and Dubai Crude. Since the price of WTI at Cushing is usually quoted by US media as the price of oil, this gave many Americans a distorted view of world oil prices as being lower than they were, and the supply being better than it was internationally. Canada used to be in a similar position to the US in that offshore oil was cheaper than domestic oil, so the oil pipelines used to run westward from the east coast to Central Canada, now they are being reversed to carry cheaper domestic oil sands production from Alberta to the east coast. =New pipelines= Lack of access to markets, limited export capacity, and oversupply in the US market have been a problem for oil sands producers in recent years. They have caused lower prices to Canadian oil sands producers and reduced royalty and tax revenues to Canadian governments. The pipeline companies have moved forward with a number of solutions to the transportation problems: * Enbridge's line from Sarnia, Ontario to Westover, Ontario near the head of Lake Erie has been reversed. This line used to take offshore oil to refineries in the Sarnia area. Now it takes Alberta SCO and blended bitumen to most refineries in Ontario. * Enbridge has applied to reverse its line from Westover to Montreal, Quebec. This line used to take offshore oil to refineries in southern Ontario. After reversal, it will take Alberta SCO and bitumen to Montreal. Since Suncor Energy owns a very large oil sands mine and upgrader in Alberta and also owns a large oil refinery in Montreal, it finds this project appealing. The alternative is closing the refinery since it is noncompetitive using offshore oil. *TransCanada is evaluating converting part of its mainline natural gas transmission system from western Canada to eastern North America to transport oil. Eastern North America is well supplied with natural gas as a result of the recent increases in US shale gas production, but has problems with oil supply since most of their oil comes from offshore. *Enbridge's Seaway Pipeline which used to take oil from the US Gulf Coast to the oil trading hub at Cushing was reversed in 2012 to take oil from Cushing to the Coast, helping to alleviate the bottleneck at Cushing. It has a capacity of but Enbridge is twinning the pipeline to add an additional . *Following the denial of a US regulatory permit for its Keystone XL pipeline, TransCanada went ahead with the southern leg of the Keystone project. This will deliver from Cushing to the Coast. Since it is entirely within the states of Oklahoma and Texas, it does not require US federal government approval. =Future pipelines= With the main constraint on Canadian oil sands development becoming the availability of export pipeline capacity, pipeline companies have proposed a number of major new transmission pipelines. Many of these became stalled in government regulatory processes, both by the Canadian and American governments. Another factor is competition for pipeline space from rapidly increasing tight oil production from North Dakota, which under NAFTA trade rules has equal access to Canadian pipelines. * Enbridge has announced its intention to expand its Alberta Clipper line from to and its Southern Access line from to . It is also proposing to build a Flanagan South line with an initial capacity of expandable to . * Enbridge is proposing to build the Northern Gateway Pipeline from Bruderheim, near Edmonton, Alberta to the port of Kitimat, BC for loading on supertankers with an initial capacity of with a reverse flow condensate pipeline to take diluent from tankers at Kitimat to Alberta. This was approved by the Canadian federal cabinet on 17 June 2014, subject to 209 conditions. After this point, the company has to satisfy most of the conditions to National Energy Board satisfaction before construction can start. Satisfying the conditions is expected to take a year or more. The leaders of both main opposition parties promised to reverse the decision if they form the government in the 2015 election. This in fact occurred, as the Liberal party under Justin Trudeau won a majority government. * Kinder Morgan is proposing to increase the capacity of its Trans Mountain pipeline through British Columbia to by 2017. Kinder Morgan is also proposing to build the Trans Mountain Expansion pipeline which will add of capacity to the West Coast of Canada and the US. * TransCanada has proposed the construction of the Keystone XL extension to its Keystone Pipeline which would add of capacity from Alberta to the US Gulf Coast. On 6 November 2015, American president Barack Obama announced that the State Department had rejected the proposed expansion. * TransCanada has also proposed to build the Energy East Pipeline, which would carry of oil from Alberta to refineries in Eastern Canada, including Quebec and New Brunswick. It would also have marine facilities that would enable Alberta production to be delivered to Atlantic markets by oil tanker. The Irving Oil Refinery in New Brunswick, which is the largest oil refinery in Canada, is especially interested in it since its traditional sources such as North Sea oil are shrinking and international oil is more expensive than Alberta oil delivered to the Atlantic coast. In addition, there are a large number of new pipelines proposed for Alberta. These will likely be approved rapidly by the Alberta Energy Regulator, so there are likely to be few capacity problems within Alberta. =Rail= The movement of crude oil by rail is far from new, but it is now a rapidly growing market for North American railroads. The growth is driven by several factors. One is that the transmission pipelines from Alberta are operating at or near capacity and companies who cannot get pipeline space have to move oil by rail instead. Another is that many refineries on the east, west, and Gulf coasts of North America are under-served by pipelines since they assumed that they would obtain their oil by ocean tanker. Producers of new oil in Alberta, North Dakota, and West Texas are now shipping oil by rail to coastal refiners who are having difficulty obtaining international oil at prices competitive with those in the interior of North America. In addition, crude bitumen can be loaded directly into tank cars equipped with steam heating coils, avoiding the need for blending it with expensive condensate in order to ship it to market. Tank cars can also be built to transport condensate on the back-haul from refineries to the oil sands to make additional revenue rather than returning empty. A single-track rail line carrying 10 trains per day, each with 120 tank cars, can move to , which is the capacity of a large transmission pipeline. This would require 300 locomotives and 18,000 tank cars, which is a small part of the fleet of a Class 1 railroad. By comparison, the two Canadian Class 1 railways, Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and Canadian National Railway (CN), have 2,400 locomotives and 65,000 freight cars between them, and CP moves 30‚Äì35 trains per day on its main line to Vancouver. Two US Class 1 railways, Union Pacific Railroad (UP) and BNSF Railway handle more than 100 trains per day on their western corridors. CN Rail has said that it could move of bitumen from Edmonton to the deepwater port of Prince Rupert, BC if the Northern Gateway Pipeline from Edmonton to the port of Kitimat, BC was not approved. With many of their lines being underused, railroads find transporting crude oil an attractive source of revenue. With enough new tank cars they could carry all the new oil being produced in North America, albeit at higher prices than pipelines. In the short term, the use of rail will probably continue to grow as producers try to bypass short-term pipeline bottlenecks to take advantage of higher prices in areas with refineries capable of handling heavier crudes. In the long term the growth in rail transport will largely depend on the continued pipeline bottlenecks due to increased production in North America and regulatory delays for new pipelines. At present rail moves over of crude oil, and with continued growth in oil production and building of new terminals, rail movements will probably continue to grow into the foreseeable future. By 2013, exports of oil from Canada to the US by rail had increased 9-fold in less than two years, from in early 2012 to in late 2013, mainly because new export pipelines had been held up by regulatory delays. As a result, Canadian farmers suffered an acute shortage of rail capacity to export their grains because so much of Canada's rail capacity was tied up by oil products. The safety of rail transport of oil was being called into question after several derailments, especially after a train with 74 tank cars of oil derailed and caught fire in Lac Megantic, Quebec. The ensuing explosion and firestorm burned down 40 buildings in the town center and killed 47 people. The cleanup of the derailment area could take 5 years, and another 160 buildings may need to be demolished. Ironically, the oil was not Canadian bitumen being exported to the United States but Bakken formation light crude oil being imported into Canada from North Dakota to the Irving Oil Refinery in New Brunswick. Although near a huge oil import port on the Atlantic Ocean, the Irving refinery is importing US Bakken oil by rail because oil from outside North America is too expensive to be economic, and there are no pipelines to deliver heavier but cheaper Western Canadian oil to New Brunswick. It was subsequently pointed out that the Bakken light oil was much more flammable than Alberta bitumen, and the rail cars were mislabeled by the North Dakota producers as to their flammability. By 2014, the movement of crude by rail had become very profitable to oil companies. Suncor Energy, Canada's largest oil company declared record profits and attributed much of it to transporting oil to market by rail. It was moving about to Cushing, Oklahoma, and putting it into TransCanada's new Gulf Coast pipeline ‚Äì which was originally going to be the southern leg of the Keystone XL pipeline, before the northern leg across the border from Canada was stalled by US federal government delays. Suncor has also been moving of Alberta bitumen and North Dakota tight oil by rail to its Montreal Refinery with plans to increase it to . Suncor claimed this saved about $10/bbl off the price of buying offshore oil. However, it was also anticipating the reversal of Enbridge's Line 9 from southwestern Ontario to Montreal to deliver oil even cheaper. Suncor has been considering adding a coker to its Montreal refinery to upgrade heavy oil sands bitumen, which would be cheaper than adding another upgrader to its oil sands operation. It was also shipping marine cargoes on an \\"opportunistic basis\\" from Texas and Louisiana \\"at significant discounts to the international crudes we would typically run in Montreal\\", thereby taking advantage of the recent US tight oil glut in addition to increased supplies of cheap Canadian oil sands bitumen. Refining Heavy crude oil feedstock#crude feedstock needs pre- processing before it is fit for conventional refineries, although heavy oil and bitumen refineries can do the pre-processing themselves. This pre- processing is called 'upgrading', the key components of which are as follows: # removal of water, sand, physical waste, and lighter products # catalytic purification by hydrodemetallisation (HDM), hydrodesulfurization (HDS) and hydrodenitrogenation (HDN) # hydrogenation through carbon rejection or catalytic hydrocracking (HCR) As carbon rejection is very inefficient and wasteful in most cases, catalytic hydrocracking is preferred in most cases. All these processes take large amounts of energy and water, while emitting more carbon dioxide than conventional oil. Catalytic purification and hydrocracking are together known as hydroprocessing. The big challenge in hydroprocessing is to deal with the impurities found in heavy crude, as they poison the catalysts over time. Many efforts have been made to deal with this to ensure high activity and long life of a catalyst. Catalyst materials and pore size distributions are key parameters that need to be optimized to deal with this challenge and varies from place to place, depending on the kind of feedstock present. =Alberta= There are four major oil refineries in Alberta which supply most of Western Canada with petroleum products, but as of 2012 these processed less than 1/4 of the approximately of bitumen and SCO produced in Alberta. Some of the large oil sands upgraders also produced diesel fuel as part of their operations. Some of the oil sands bitumen and SCO went to refineries other provinces, but most of it was exported to the United States. The four major Alberta refineries are: * Suncor Energy, the largest oil company in Canada, operates the Petro-Canada refinery near Edmonton, Alberta which can process of all types of oil and bitumen into all types of products. * Imperial Oil, controlled by ExxonMobil, operates the Strathcona Refinery near Edmonton, which can process of SCO and conventional oil into all types of products. * Shell Canada, a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell, operates the Scotford Refinery near Edmonton, which is integrated with the Scotford Upgrader, and which can process of all types of oil and bitumen into all types of products. * Husky Energy, a Canadian company controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, operates the Husky Lloydminster Refinery in Lloydminster on the Alberta/Saskatchewan border, which can process of feedstock from the adjacent Husky Upgrader into asphalt and other products. The $8.5-billion Sturgeon Refinery, a fifth major Alberta refinery, is under construction near Fort Saskatchewan with a completion date of 2017. The proponents are Alberta Petroleum Marketing Commission, Canadian Natural Resources Limited and North West Upgrading Inc. NWU, which was founded in 2004, is a private, Alberta-based company with headquarters in Calgary. Canadian Natural Resources Limited 50/50 entered into a joint venture partnership with NWU in February 2011 forming North West Redwater Partnership. This is the first oil refinery to be constructed in Alberta in thirty years ‚Äì the last was Shell's Scotford refinery which was completed in 1984. The Sturgeon Refinery is the \\"first new refinery to be built with a carbon capture and storage system.\\" The plant is designed to convert up to of crude bitumen directly to diesel fuel. \\"In addition to producing ultra low-sulphur diesel and naphtha, the project will capture carbon dioxide which will be sold to Enhance Energy‚Äôs Alberta Carbon Trunk Line for use in enhanced oil recovery.\\" The refinery will process bitumen into diesel fuel not SCO so it is more of an upgrader than a refinery. A petroleum coker is required to upgrade the raw product before it can be made into diesel.\\" By June 2014 the estimated cost of construction had increased from $5.7 billion to $8.5 billion ‚Äì or $170,000 per barrel of new capacity. The Alberta government has guaranteed NWU's loans and signed a firm contract for feedstock deliveries because of some economic issues. Alberta levies royalties on bitumen at \\"before payout\\" (2%) and \\"after payout\\" (25%) rates, and accepts payments \\"in kind\\" rather than \\"in cash.\\" (BRIK), Alberta will receive 300,000 bpd of bitumen under this BRIK program. With bitumen production expected to reach by 2035, it means that after the projects pay out, the Alberta government will have of bitumen to sell. Since Alberta has a chronic shortage of diesel fuel, the government would prefer to sell diesel fuel rather than bitumen to Alberta and international oil companies. =British Columbia= The Pacific Future Energy project proposes a new refinery in British Columbia that would bring in Western Canadian bitumen and process it into fuels for Asian and Canadian markets. Pacific Future Energy proposes to transport near-solid bitumen to the refinery using railway tank cars. =Rest of Canada= Canadian oil exports have increased tenfold since 1980, mostly as the result of new oil sands bitumen and heavy oil output, but at the same time Canadian oil consumption and refining capacity has hardly grown at all. Since the 1970s, the number of oil refineries in Canada has declined from 40 to 19. There hasn't been a new oil refinery (other than oil sands upgraders) built in Canada since 1984. Most of the Canadian oil refining industry is foreign-owned, and except for Alberta, international companies preferred to build refining capacity elsewhere than in Canada. The result is a serious imbalance between Canadian oil production versus Canadian oil refining. Although Canada produces much more oil than it refines, and exports more oil and refined products than it consumes, most of the new production is heavier than traditional oil and concentrated in the landlocked provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. Canadian refineries have pipeline access to and can process only about 25% of the oil produced in Canada. The remainder of Canadian oil production is exported, almost all of it to the US. At the same time Canada imports of crude oil from other countries and exports much of the oil products to other countries, most of it to the US. Canadian refineries, outside of the major oil producing provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan, were originally built on the assumption that light and medium crude oil would continue to be cheap in the long term, and that imported oil would be cheaper than oil sands production. With new oil sands production coming on production at lower prices than international oil, market price imbalances have ruined the economics of refineries which could not process it. Most of the Canadian oil refineries which closed were in the oil deficient regions of Quebec, the Atlantic Provinces, and British Columbia where they had no access to cheaper domestic Canadian production. They also were not designed to refine the heavier grades which comprised most new Canadian production. These refinery closures were part of an international trend, since about a dozen refineries in Europe, the Caribbean and along the US east coast have shut down recent years due to sharp increases in the cost of imported oil and declining domestic demand for fuel. =United States= Prior to 2013, when China surpassed it, the United States was the largest oil importer in the world. Unlike Canada, the US has hundreds of oil refineries, many of which have been modified to process heavy oil as US production of light and medium oil declined. The main market for Canadian bitumen as well as Venezuelan extra-heavy oil was assumed to be the US. The United States has historically been Canada's largest customer for crude oil and products, particularly in recent years. American imports of oil and products from Canada grew from in 1981 to in 2013 as Canada's oil sands produced more and more oil, while in the US, domestic production and imports from other countries declined. However, this relationship is becoming strained due to physical, economic and political influences. Export pipeline capacity is approaching its limits; Canadian oil is selling at a discount to world market prices; US demand for crude oil and product imports has declined because of US economic problems; and US oil domestic unconventional oil production (shale oil production from fracking is growing rapidly. The US resumed export of crude oil in 2016; as of early 2019, the US produced as much oil as it consumed, with shale oil displacing Canadian imports. For the benefit of oil marketers, in 2004 Western Canadian producers created a new benchmark crude oil called Western Canadian Select, (WCS), a bitumen-derived heavy crude oil blend that is similar in its transportation and refining characteristics to California, Mexico Maya, or Venezuela heavy crude oils. This heavy oil has an API gravity of 19‚Äì21 and despite containing large amounts of bitumen and synthetic crude oil, flows through pipelines well and is classified as \\"conventional heavy oil\\" by governments. There are several hundred thousand barrels per day of this blend being imported into the US, in addition to larger amounts of crude bitumen and synthetic crude oil (SCO) from the oil sands. The demand from US refineries is increasingly for non-upgraded bitumen rather than SCO. The Canadian National Energy Board (NEB) expects SCO volumes to double to around by 2035, but not keep pace with the total increase in bitumen production. It projects that the portion of oil sands production that is upgraded to SCO to decline from 49% in 2010 to 37% in 2035. This implies that over of bitumen will have to be blended with diluent for delivery to market. =Asia= Demand for oil in Asia has been growing much faster than in North America or Europe. In 2013, China replaced the United States as the world's largest importer of crude oil, and its demand continues to grow much faster than its production. The main impediment to Canadian exports to Asia is pipeline capacity ‚Äì The only pipeline capable of delivering oil sands production to Canada's Pacific Coast is the Trans Mountain Pipeline from Edmonton to Vancouver, which is now operating at its capacity of supplying refineries in B.C. and Washington State. However, once complete, the Northern Gateway pipeline and the Trans Mountain expansion currently undergoing government review are expected to deliver an additional to to tankers on the Pacific coast, from where they could deliver it anywhere in the world. There is sufficient heavy oil refinery capacity in China and India to refine the additional Canadian volume, possibly with some modifications to the refineries. In recent years, Chinese oil companies such as China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec), China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), and PetroChina have bought over $30 billion in assets in Canadian oil sands projects, so they would probably like to export some of their newly acquired oil to China. Economics The world's largest deposits of bitumen are in Canada, although Venezuela's deposits of extra-heavy crude oil are even bigger. Canada has vast energy resources of all types and its oil and natural gas resource base would be large enough to meet Canadian needs for generations if demand was sustained. Abundant hydroelectric resources account for the majority of Canada's electricity production and very little electricity is produced from oil. The National Energy Board (NEB) reported in 2013, that if oil prices are above US$100, Canada would have more than enough energy to meet its growing needs. The excess oil production from the oil sands could be exported. The major importing country would probably continue to be the United States, although before the developments in 2014, there was increasing demand for oil, particularly heavy oil, from Asian countries such as China and India. Canada has abundant resources of bitumen and crude oil, with an estimated remaining ultimate resource potential of 54 billion cubic metres (340 billion barrels). Of this, oil sands bitumen accounts for 90 per cent. Alberta currently accounts for all of Canada's bitumen resources. \\"Resources\\" become \\"reserves\\" only after it is proven that economic recovery can be achieved. At 2013 prices using current technology, Canada had remaining oil reserves of 27 billion m3 (170 billion bbls), with 98% of this attributed to oil sands bitumen. This put its reserves in third place in the world behind Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. At the much lower prices of 2015, the reserves are much smaller. =Costs= The costs of production and transportation of saleable petroleum from oil sands is typically significantly higher than from conventional global sources. Hence the economic viability of oil sands production is more vulnerable to the price of oil. The price of benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil at Cushing, Oklahoma above US$100/bbl that prevailed until late 2014 was sufficient to promote active growth in oil sands production. Major Canadian oil companies had announced expansion plans and foreign companies were investing significant amounts of capital, in many cases forming partnerships with Canadian companies. Investment had been shifting towards in-situ steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) projects and away from mining and upgrading projects, as oil sands operators foresee better opportunities from selling bitumen and heavy oil directly to refineries than from upgrading it to synthetic crude oil. Cost estimates for Canada include the effects of the mining when the mines are returned to the environment in \\"as good as or better than original condition\\". Cleanup of the end products of consumption are the responsibility of the consuming jurisdictions, which are mostly in provinces or countries other than the producing one. The Alberta government estimated that in 2012, the supply cost of oil sands new mining operations was $70 to $85 per barrel, whereas the cost of new SAGD projects was $50 to $80 per barrel. These costs included capital and operating costs, royalties and taxes, plus a reasonable profit to the investors. Since the price of WTI rose to $100/bbl beginning in 2011, production from oil sands was then expected to be highly profitable assuming the product could be delivered to markets. The main market was the huge refinery complexes on the US Gulf Coast, which are generally capable of processing Canadian bitumen and Venezuelan extra-heavy oil without upgrading. The Canadian Energy Research Institute (CERI) performed an analysis, estimating that in 2012 the average plant gate costs (including 10% profit margin, but excluding blending and transport) of primary recovery was $30.32/bbl, of SAGD was $47.57/bbl, of mining and upgrading was $99.02/bbl, and of mining without upgrading was $68.30/bbl. Thus, all types of oil sands projects except new mining projects with integrated upgraders were expected to be consistently profitable from 2011 onward, provided that global oil prices remained favourable. Since the larger and more sophisticated refineries preferred to buy raw bitumen and heavy oil rather than synthetic crude oil, new oil sands projects avoided the costs of building new upgraders. Although primary recovery such as is done in Venezuela is cheaper than SAGD, it only recovers about 10% of the oil in place versus 60% or more for SAGD and over 99% for mining. Canadian oil companies were in a more competitive market and had access to more capital than in Venezuela, and preferred to spend that extra money on SAGD or mining to recover more oil. Then in late 2014 the dramatic rise in U.S. production from shale formations, combined with a global economic malaise that reduced demand, caused the price of WTI to drop below $50, where it remained as of late 2015. In 2015, the Canadian Energy Research Institute (CERI) re-estimated the average plant gate costs (again including 10% profit margin) of SAGD to be $58.65/bbl, and 70.18/bbl for mining without upgrading. Including costs of blending and transportation, the WTI equivalent supply costs for delivery to Cushing become US$80.06/bbl for SAGD projects, and US$89.71/bbl for a standalone mine. In this economic environment, plans for further development of production from oil sands have been slowed or deferred, or even abandoned during construction. Production of synthetic crude from mining operations may continue at a loss because of the costs of shutdown and restart, as well as commitments to supply contracts. During the 2020 Russia‚ÄìSaudi Arabia oil price war, the price of Canadian heavy crude dipped below $5 per barrel. =Production forecasts= Oil sands production forecasts released by the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER), and the Canadian Energy Research Institute (CERI) are comparable to National Energy Board (NEB) projections, in terms of total bitumen production. None of these forecasts take into account probable international constraints to be imposed on combustion of all hydrocarbons in order to limit global temperature rise, giving rise to a situation denoted by the term \\"carbon bubble\\". Ignoring such constraints, and also assuming that the price of oil recovers from its collapse in late 2014, the list of currently proposed projects, many of which are in the early planning stages, would suggest that by 2035 Canadian bitumen production could potentially reach as much as 1.3 million m3/d (8.3 million barrels per day) if most were to go ahead. Under the same assumptions, a more likely scenario is that by 2035, Canadian oil sands bitumen production would reach 800,000 m3/d (5.0 million barrels/day), 2.6 times the production for 2012. The majority of the growth would likely occur in the in-situ category, as in-situ projects usually have better economics than mining projects. Also, 80% of Canada's oil sands reserves are well-suited to in-situ extraction, versus 20% for mining methods. An additional assumption is that there would be sufficient pipeline infrastructure to deliver increased Canadian oil production to export markets. If this were a limiting factor, there could be impacts on Canadian crude oil prices, constraining future production growth. Another assumption is that US markets will continue to absorb increased Canadian exports. Rapid growth of tight oil production in the US, Canada's primary oil export market, has greatly reduced US reliance on imported crude. The potential for Canadian oil exports to alternative markets such as Asia is also uncertain. There are increasing political obstacles to building any new pipelines to deliver oil in Canada and the US. In November 2015, U.S. President Barack Obama rejected the proposal to build the Keystone XL pipeline from Alberta to Steele City, Nebraska. In the absence of new pipeline capacity, companies are increasingly shipping bitumen to US markets by railway, river barge, tanker, and other transportation methods. Other than ocean tankers, these alternatives are all more expensive than pipelines. A shortage of skilled workers in the Canadian oil sands developed during periods of rapid development of new projects. In the absence of other constraints on further development, the oil and gas industry would need to fill tens of thousands of job openings in the next few years as a result of industry activity levels as well as age-related attrition. In the longer term, under a scenario of higher oil and gas prices, the labor shortages would continue to get worse. A potential labor shortage can increase construction costs and slow the pace of oil sands development. The skilled worker shortage was much more severe in Venezuela because the government controlled oil company PDVSA fired most of its heavy oil experts after the Venezuelan general strike of 2002‚Äì03, and wound down the production of Orimulsion, which was the primary product from its oil sands. Following that, the government re-nationalized the Venezuelan oil industry and increased taxes on it. The result was that foreign companies left Venezuela, as did most of its elite heavy oil technical experts. In recent years, Venezuela's heavy oil production has been falling, and it has consistently been failing to meet its production targets. As of late 2015, development of new oil sand projects were deterred by the price of WTI below US$50, which is barely enough to support production from existing operations. Demand recovery was suppressed by economic problems that may continue indefinitely to bedevil both the European Community and China. Low-cost production by OPEC continued at maximum capacity, efficiency of production from U.S. shales continued to improve, and Russian exports were mandated even below cost of production, as their only source of hard currency. There is also the possibility that there will emerge an international agreement to introduce measures to constrain the combustion of hydrocarbons in an effort to limit global temperature rise to the nominal 2 ¬∞C that is consensually predicted to limit environmental harm to tolerable levels. Rapid technological progress is being made to reduce the cost of competing renewable sources of energy. Hence there is no consensus about when, if ever, oil prices paid to producers may substantially recover. A detailed academic study of the consequences for the producers of the various hydrocarbon fuels concluded in early 2015 that a third of global oil reserves, half of gas reserves and over 80% of current coal reserves should remain underground from 2010 to 2050 in order to meet the target of 2 ¬∞C. Hence continued exploration or development of reserves would be extraneous to needs. To meet the 2 ¬∞C target, strong measures would be needed to suppress demand, such as a substantial carbon tax leaving a lower price for the producers from a smaller market. The impact on producers in Canada would be far larger than in the U.S. Open-pit mining of natural bitumen in Canada would soon drop to negligible levels after 2020 in all scenarios considered because it is considerably less economic than other methods of production. Environmental issues Satellite images show the growth of pit mines over Canada's oil sands between 1984 and 2011. Demonstration of citizens against tar sands and the Keystone Pipeline. In their 2011 commissioned report entitled \\"Prudent Development: Realizing the Potential of North America‚Äôs Abundant Natural Gas and Oil Resources,\\" the National Petroleum Council, an advisory committee to the U.S. Secretary of Energy, acknowledged health and safety concerns regarding the oil sands which include \\"volumes of water needed to generate issues of water sourcing; removal of overburden for surface mining can fragment wildlife habitat and increase the risk of soil erosion or surface run-off events to nearby water systems; GHG and other air emissions from production.\\" Oil sands extraction can affect the land when the bitumen is initially mined, water resources by its requirement for large quantities of water during separation of the oil and sand, and the air due to the release of carbon dioxide and other emissions.R. Smandych and R. Kueneman, \\"The Canadian- Alberta Tar Sands: A Case Study of State-Corporate Environmental Crime\\" in R. White (ed.) Global Environmental Harm. Cullompton: willan, 2010 Heavy metals such as vanadium, nickel, lead, cobalt, mercury, chromium, cadmium, arsenic, selenium, copper, manganese, iron and zinc are naturally present in oil sands and may be concentrated by the extraction process. The environmental impact caused by oil sand extraction is frequently criticized by environmental groups such as Greenpeace, Climate Reality Project, Pembina Institute, 350.org, MoveOn.org, League of Conservation Voters, Patagonia, Sierra Club, and Energy Action Coalition. In particular, mercury contamination has been found around oil sands production in Alberta, Canada.Researchers find 7,300-sq-mile ring of mercury around tar sands in Canada http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/12/29/7-500-mile-ring- ofmercuryfoundaroundcanadastarsands.html The European Union has indicated that it may vote to label oil sands oil as \\"highly polluting\\". Although oil sands exports to Europe are minimal, the issue has caused friction between the EU and Canada. According to the California-based Jacobs Consultancy, the European Union used inaccurate and incomplete data in assigning a high greenhouse gas rating to gasoline derived from Alberta's oilsands. Also, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Russia do not provide data on how much natural gas is released via flaring or venting in the oil extraction process. The Jacobs report pointed out that extra carbon emissions from oil-sand crude are 12 percent higher than from regular crude, although it was assigned a GHG rating 22% above the conventional benchmark by EU. In 2014 results of a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showed that official reports on emissions were not high enough. Report authors noted that, \\"emissions of organic substances with potential toxicity to humans and the environment are a major concern surrounding the rapid industrial development in the Athabasca oil sands region (AOSR).\\" This study found that tailings ponds were an indirect pathway transporting uncontrolled releases of evaporative emissions of three representative polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)s (phenanthrene, pyrene, and benzo(a)pyrene) and that these emissions had been previously unreported. =Air pollution management= The Alberta government computes an Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) from sensors in five communities in the oil sands region, operated by a \\"partner\\" called the Wood Buffalo Environmental Association (WBEA). Each of their 17 continuously monitoring stations measure 3 to 10 air quality parameters among carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen sulfide (), total reduced sulfur (TRS), Ammonia (), nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone (), particulate matter (PM2.5), sulfur dioxide (), total hydrocarbons (THC), and methane/non-methane hydrocarbons (/NMHC). These AQHI are said to indicate \\"low risk\\" air quality more than 95% of the time. Prior to 2012, air monitoring showed significant increases in exceedances of hydrogen sulfide () both in the Fort McMurray area and near the oil sands upgraders. In 2007, the Alberta government issued an environmental protection order to Suncor in response to numerous occasions when ground level concentration for ) exceeded standards. The Alberta Ambient Air Data Management System (AAADMS) of the Clean Air Strategic Alliancehttp://casahome.org/AboutCASA.aspx (aka CASA Data Warehouse) records that, during the year ending on 1 November 2015, there were 6 hourly reports of values exceeding the limit of 10 ppb for , and 4 in 2013, down from 11 in 2014, and 73 in 2012. In September 2015, the Pembina Institute published a brief report about \\"a recent surge of odour and air quality concerns in northern Alberta associated with the expansion of oilsands development\\", contrasting the responses to these concerns in Peace River and Fort McKay. In Fort McKay, air quality is actively addressed by stakeholders represented in the WBEA, whereas the Peace River community must rely on the response of the Alberta Energy Regulator. In an effort to identify the sources of the noxious odours in the Fort McKay community, a Fort McKay Air Quality Index was established, extending the provincial Air Quality Health Index to include possible contributors to the problem: , TRS, and THC. Despite these advantages, more progress was made in remediating the odour problems in the Peace River community, although only after some families had already abandoned their homes. The odour concerns in Fort McKay were reported to remain unresolved. =Land use and waste management= A large part of oil sands mining operations involves clearing trees and brush from a site and removing the overburden‚Äî topsoil, muskeg, sand, clay and gravel ‚Äì that sits atop the oil sands deposit. Approximately 2.5 tons of oil sands are needed to produce one barrel of oil (roughly ‚Öõ of a ton). As a condition of licensing, projects are required to implement a reclamation plan. The mining industry asserts that the boreal forest will eventually colonize the reclaimed lands, but their operations are massive and work on long-term timeframes. As of 2013, about of land in the oil sands region have been disturbed, and of that land is under reclamation. In March 2008, Alberta issued the first-ever oil sands land reclamation certificate to Syncrude for the parcel of land known as Gateway Hill approximately north of Fort McMurray. Several reclamation certificate applications for oil sands projects are expected within the next 10 years. =Water management= Between 2 and 4.5 volume units of water are used to produce each volume unit of synthetic crude oil in an ex-situ mining operation. According to Greenpeace, the Canadian oil sands operations use of water, twice the amount of water used by the city of Calgary. However, in SAGD operations, 90‚Äì95% of the water is recycled and only about 0.2 volume units of water is used per volume unit of bitumen produced. For the Athabasca oil sand operations water is supplied from the Athabasca River, the ninth longest river in Canada. The average flow just downstream of Fort McMurray is with its highest daily average measuring . Oil sands industries water license allocations totals about 1.8% of the Athabasca river flow. Actual use in 2006 was about 0.4%. In addition, according to the Water Management Framework for the Lower Athabasca River, during periods of low river flow water consumption from the Athabasca River is limited to 1.3% of annual average flow. In December 2010, the Oil Sands Advisory Panel, commissioned by former environment minister Jim Prentice, found that the system in place for monitoring water quality in the region, including work by the Regional Aquatic Monitoring Program, the Alberta Water Research Institute, the Cumulative Environmental Management Association and others, was piecemeal and should become more comprehensive and coordinated. =Greenhouse gas emissions= The production of bitumen and synthetic crude oil emits more greenhouse gases than the production of conventional crude oil. A 2009 study by the consulting firm IHS CERA estimated that production from Canada's oil sands emits \\"about 5% to 15% more carbon dioxide, over the \\"well-to-wheels\\" (WTW) lifetime analysis of the fuel, than average crude oil.\\" Author and investigative journalist David Strahan that same year stated that IEA figures show that carbon dioxide emissions from the oil sands are 20% higher than average emissions from the petroleum production. A Stanford University study commissioned by the EU in 2011 found that oil sands crude was as much as 22% more carbon intensive than other fuels. Greenpeace says the oil sands industry has been identified as the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions growth in Canada, as it accounts for 40 million tons of emissions per year. According to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers and Environment Canada the industrial activity undertaken to produce oil sands make up about 5% of Canada's greenhouse gas emissions, or 0.1% of global greenhouse gas emissions. It predicts the oil sands will grow to make up 8% of Canada's greenhouse gas emissions by 2015. While the production industrial activity emissions per barrel of bitumen produced decreased 26% over the decade 1992‚Äì2002, total emissions from production activity were expected to increase due to higher production levels. As of 2006, to produce one barrel of oil from the oil sands released almost of greenhouse gases with total emissions estimated to be per year by 2015. A study by IHS CERA found that fuels made from Canadian oil sands resulted in significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions than many commonly cited estimates. A 2012 study by Swart and Weaver estimated that if only the economically viable reserve of oil sands was burnt, the global mean temperature would increase by 0.02 to 0.05 ¬∞C. If the entire oil-in-place of 1.8 trillion barrels were to be burnt, the predicted global mean temperature increase is 0.24 to 0.50 ¬∞C. (supplement) Bergerson et al. found that while the WTW emissions can be higher than crude oil, the lower emitting oil sands cases can outperform higher emitting conventional crude cases.Bergerson, Joule A. et al., Life Cycle Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Current Oil Sands Technologies: Surface Mining and In Situ Applications, Environmental Science & Technology 46 (14), pp. 7865‚Äì7874, 2012. To offset greenhouse gas emissions from the oil sands and elsewhere in Alberta, sequestering carbon dioxide emissions inside depleted oil and gas reservoirs has been proposed. This technology is inherited from enhanced oil recovery methods. In July 2008, the Alberta government announced a C$2 billion fund to support sequestration projects in Alberta power plants and oil sands extraction and upgrading facilities. In November 2014, Fatih Birol, the chief economist of the International Energy Agency, described additional greenhouse gas emissions from Canada's oil sands as \\"extremely low\\". The IEA forecasts that in the next 25 years oil sands production in Canada will increase by more than , but Dr. Birol said \\"the emissions of this additional production is equal to only 23 hours of emissions of China ‚Äî not even one day.\\" The IEA is charged with responsibility for battling climate change, but Dr. Birol said he spends little time worrying about carbon emissions from oil sands. \\"There is a lot of discussion on oil sands projects in Canada and the United States and other parts of the world, but to be frank, the additional CO2 emissions coming from the oil sands is extremely low.\\" Dr. Birol acknowledged that there is tremendous difference of opinion on the course of action regarding climate change, but added, \\"I hope all these reactions are based on scientific facts and sound analysis.\\" In 2014, the U.S. Congressional Research Service published a report in preparation for the decision about permitting construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. The report states in part: \\"Canadian oil sands crudes are generally more GHG emission-intensive than other crudes they may displace in U.S. refineries, and emit an estimated 17% more GHGs on a life-cycle basis than the average barrel of crude oil refined in the United States\\". According to Natural Resources Canada (NRCan), by 2017, the 23 percent increase in GHG emissions in Canada from 2005 to 2017, was \\"largely from increased oil sands production, particularly in-situ extraction.\\" =Aquatic life deformities= There is conflicting research on the effects of the oil sands development on aquatic life. In 2007, Environment Canada completed a study that shows high deformity rates in fish embryos exposed to the oil sands. David W. Schindler, a limnologist from the University of Alberta, co-authored a study on Alberta's oil sands' contribution of aromatic polycyclic compounds, some of which are known carcinogens, to the Athabasca River and its tributaries. Scientists, local doctors, and residents supported a letter sent to the Prime Minister in September 2010 calling for an independent study of Lake Athabasca (which is downstream of the oil sands) to be initiated due to the rise of deformities and tumors found in fish caught there. The bulk of the research that defends the oil sands development is done by the Regional Aquatics Monitoring Program (RAMP). RAMP studies show that deformity rates are normal compared to historical data and the deformity rates in rivers upstream of the oil sands. =Public health impacts= In 2007, it was suggested that wildlife has been negatively affected by the oil sands; for instance, moose were found in a 2006 study to have as high as 453 times the acceptable levels of arsenic in their systems, though later studies lowered this to 17 to 33 times the acceptable level (although below international thresholds for consumption). Concerns have been raised concerning the negative impacts that the oil sands have on public health, including higher than normal rates of cancer among residents of Fort Chipewyan. However, John O'Connor, the doctor who initially reported the higher cancer rates and linked them to the oil sands development, was subsequently investigated by the Alberta College of Physicians and Surgeons. The College later reported that O'Connor's statements consisted of \\"mistruths, inaccuracies and unconfirmed information.\\" In 2010, the Royal Society of Canada released a report stating that \\"there is currently no credible evidence of environmental contaminant exposures from oil sands reaching Fort Chipewyan at levels expected to cause elevated human cancer rates.\\" In August 2011, the Alberta government initiated a provincial health study to examine whether a link exists between the higher rates of cancer and the oil sands emissions. In a report released in 2014, Alberta's Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. James Talbot, stated that \\"There isn‚Äôt strong evidence for an association between any of these cancers and environmental exposure [to oil sands].\\" Rather, Talbot suggested that the cancer rates at Fort Chipewyan, which were slightly higher compared with the provincial average, were likely due to a combination of factors such as high rates of smoking, obesity, diabetes, and alcoholism as well as poor levels of vaccination.Oil sands foes ignore the facts as cancer claims dealt a blow by study by Claudia Cattaneo, Financial Post, March 24, 2014.

In 2002, Weymouth was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Talking Heads. Early life Born in Coronado, California, Weymouth is the daughter of Laura Bouchage and U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Ralph Weymouth. She has seven siblings, including Lani and Laura Weymouth, who are collaborators in Weymouth's band Tom Tom Club, and architect Yann Weymouth, the designer of the Salvador Dal√≠ Museum. Weymouth is of French heritage on her mother's side (she is the great-granddaughter of Anatole Le Braz, a Breton writer).Heritage-d'Anatole Le Braz aux talking heads dated August 31, 2012 at letelegramme.fr At age 12, Weymouth joined the Potomac English Hand Bell Ringers, an amateur music group directed by Nancy Tufts, and toured with them. At 14, she started to teach herself the guitar. Talking Heads As a student at the Rhode Island School of Design, she met Chris Frantz and David Byrne, who later formed a band and were searching for a bass guitar player. She joined them at Frantz's request, and began learning and playing bass. As a bass player she combined the minimalist art-punk bass lines of groups such as Wire and Pere Ubu with danceable, funk-inflected riffs to provide the bedrock of Talking Heads's signature sound. Other musical activities Full members of the Compass Point All Stars, Weymouth and Frantz formed the Tom Tom Club in 1980, which kept them busy during a fairly long hiatus in Talking Heads activity. When it became obvious that Talking Heads frontman David Byrne had no interest in another Talking Heads album, Weymouth, Frantz, and Jerry Harrison reunited without him for a single album called No Talking, Just Head under the name \\"The Heads\\" in 1996, featuring a rotating cast of vocalists. Weymouth has been critical of Byrne, describing him as \\"a man incapable of returning friendship.\\" Weymouth playing with Talking Heads, Toronto, May 13, 1978 She co-produced the Happy Mondays' 1992 album Yes Please! and has contributed backing vocals and percussion for the alternative rock virtual band Gorillaz on their track \\"19-2000.\\" Weymouth was a judge for the second annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers. She collaborated with Chicks on Speed on their cover of the Tom Tom Club's \\"Wordy Rappinghood\\" for their album 99 Cents in 2003 along with other female musicians such as Miss Kittin, Kevin Blechdom, Le Tigre, and Adult.'s Nicola Kuperus. \\"Wordy Rappinghood\\" became a moderate dance hit in Europe, peaking at number two in the Dutch Top 40, number five on the Belgian Dance Chart, and at number seven on the UK Singles Chart.

The title was also given occasionally to another woman of the same generation, while a woman from the previous generation was sometimes given the title of grand empress dowager (). Numerous empress dowagers held regency during the reign of underage emperors. Many of the most prominent empress dowagers also extended their control for long periods after the emperor was old enough to govern. This was a source of political turmoil according to the traditional view of Chinese history. The title dowager empress was given to the wife of a deceased emperor of Russia or Holy Roman emperor.

Although never referred to as a dowager, Empress Matilda was controversially the Holy Roman Empress and continued to be referred to as \\"empress\\" long after her husband's death; Although having abandoned the throne for her son Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, Empress Constance widow of Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor remained her title as \\"empress dowager\\" till her death. Russian dowager empresses Dowager empresses of Russia held precedence over the empress consort. This was occasionally a source of tension. For example, when Paul I was assassinated, Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna (Sophie Dorothea of W√ºrttemberg), for whom this tradition was started, often took the arm of her son Tsar Alexander I at court functions and ceremonies while his wife Empress Elizabeth Alexeievna (Louise of Baden) walked behind, which caused resentment on the part of the young empress. The same thing happened decades later when Emperor Alexander III died, and the Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark) held precedence over Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna (Alix of Hesse), which put an enormous strain on their already tense relationship. The power struggle culminated when the Dowager Empress refused to hand over certain jewels traditionally associated with the Empress Consort. There have been four dowager empresses in Russia: *HIM Empress Maria Feodorovna (Sophie Dorothea of W√ºrttemberg) Empress Consort of Paul I of Russia *HIM Empress Elizabeth Alexeievna (Louise of Baden) Empress Consort of Alexander I of Russia *HIM Empress Alexandra Feodorovna (Charlotte of Prussia) Empress Consort of Nicholas I of Russia *HIM Empress Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark) Empress Consort of Alexander III of Russia Empress Elizabeth Alexeievna was briefly and concurrently, along with her mother in-law Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna, a Dowager empress. She is therefore often forgotten as an Dowager Empress. =South Asia=  Indian empresses dowager  Queen-Empress Victoria was widowed in 1861, before her accession as Queen-Empress of India. Her son, her grandson and her great- grandson all died before their wives, and their widows were known as empresses dowager in this Indian context. Had George VI, the last Emperor of India, died before the independence of India was proclaimed in 1947, his widow would have been known as the dowager empress of India. However, George VI did not die until 1952, some years after India's formal independence and the renunciation of the title Emperor of India by the British monarch (which took place formally in 1948). * Queen-Empress Alexandra (d. 20 Nov. 1925), widow of King- Emperor Edward VII (r. 1901‚Äì1910) * Queen-Empress Mary (d. 24 Mar. 1953), widow of King-Emperor George V (r. 1910‚Äì1936) * Queen-Empress Elizabeth (d. 30 Mar. 2002), widow of King-Emperor George VI (r. 1936‚Äì1947) =Southeast Asia= Vietnamese empresses dowager ; ƒêinh-Early L√™ dynasties * Empress Dowager D∆∞∆°ng V√¢n Nga (952‚Äì1000): In 979, her husband Emperor ƒêinh B·ªô Lƒ©nh died after an assassination, her son Prince ƒêinh To√†n ascended to the throne, she became empress dowager and handled all political matters.

Web. 28 Sept 2009 from: <> Pluralism sees politics primarily as a contest among competing interest groups. Elite or managerial theory is sometimes called a state-centered approach. It explains what the state does by looking at constraints from organizational structure, semi- autonomous state managers, and interests that arise from the state as a unique, power-concentrating organization. A leading representative is Theda Skocpol. Social class theory analysis emphasizes the political power of capitalist elites.Lewis A. Coser. Masters of sociological Thought.Class Theory 1977: 48‚Äì50. Web. Retrieved 29 Sept 2009 from It can be split into two parts: one is the \\"power structure\\" or \\"instrumentalist\\" approach, whereas another is the structuralist approach. The power structure approach focuses on the question of who rules and its most well-known representative is G. William Domhoff. The structuralist approach emphasizes the way a capitalist economy operates; only allowing and encouraging the state to do some things but not others (Nicos Poulantzas, Bob Jessop).  Marxist theory of the state  Marx's ideas about the state can be divided into three subject areas: pre- capitalist states, states in the capitalist (i.e. present) era and the state (or absence of one) in post-capitalist society. Overlaying this is the fact that his own ideas about the state changed as he grew older, differing in his early pre-communist phase, the young Marx phase which predates the unsuccessful 1848 uprisings in Europe and in his mature, more nuanced work. In Marx's 1843 Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right, his basic conception is that the state and civil society are separate. However, he already saw some limitations to that model, arguing: By the time he wrote The German Ideology (1846), Marx viewed the state as a creature of the bourgeois economic interest. Two years later, that idea was expounded in The Communist Manifesto:Marx, Karl; Engels, Friedrich (1848). The Communist Manifesto. \\"Chapter I. Bourgeois and Proletarians\\". Marxists Internet Archive. Retrieved 10 August 2019. This represents the high point of conformance of the state theory to an economic interpretation of history in which the forces of production determine peoples' production relations and their production relations determine all other relations, including the political. Although \\"determines\\" is the strong form of the claim, Marx also uses \\"conditions\\". Even \\"determination\\" is not causality and some reciprocity of action is admitted. The bourgeoisie control the economy, therefore they control the state. In this theory, the state is an instrument of class rule. Antonio Gramsci's theory of hegemony is tied to his conception of the capitalist state. Gramsci does not understand the state in the narrow sense of the government. Instead, he divides it between political society (the police, the army, legal system, etc.) ‚Äì the arena of political institutions and legal constitutional control ‚Äì and civil society (the family, the education system, trade unions, etc.) ‚Äì commonly seen as the private or non-state sphere, which mediates between the state and the economy. However, he stresses that the division is purely conceptual and that the two often overlap in reality.Gramsci 1982, p. 160. Gramsci claims the capitalist state rules through force plus consent: political society is the realm of force and civil society is the realm of consent. Gramsci proffers that under modern capitalism the bourgeoisie can maintain its economic control by allowing certain demands made by trade unions and mass political parties within civil society to be met by the political sphere. Thus, the bourgeoisie engages in passive revolution by going beyond its immediate economic interests and allowing the forms of its hegemony to change. Gramsci posits that movements such as reformism and fascism, as well as the scientific management and assembly line methods of Frederick Taylor and Henry Ford respectively, are examples of this. English marxist sociologist Ralph Miliband was influenced by American sociologist C. Wright Mills, of whom he had been a friend. He published The State in Capitalist Society in 1969, a study in Marxist political sociology, rejecting the idea that pluralism spread political power, and maintaining that power in Western democracies was concentrated in the hands of a dominant class. Nicos Poulantzas's theory of the state reacted to what he saw as simplistic understandings within Marxism. For him Instrumentalist Marxist accounts such as that of Miliband held that the state was simply an instrument in the hands of a particular class. Poulantzas disagreed with this because he saw the capitalist class as too focused on its individual short-term profit, rather than on maintaining the class's power as a whole, to simply exercise the whole of state power in its own interest. Poulantzas argued that the state, though relatively autonomous from the capitalist class, nonetheless functions to ensure the smooth operation of capitalist society, and therefore benefits the capitalist class. In particular, he focused on how an inherently divisive system such as capitalism could coexist with the social stability necessary for it to reproduce itself--looking in particular to nationalism as a means to overcome the class divisions within capitalism. Borrowing from Gramsci's notion of cultural hegemony, Poulantzas argued that repressing movements of the oppressed is not the sole function of the state. Rather, state power must also obtain the consent of the oppressed. It does this through class alliances, where the dominant group makes an \\"alliance\\" with subordinate groups as a means to obtain the consent of the subordinate group. Bob Jessop was influenced by Gramsci, Miliband and Poulantzas to propose that the state is not as an entity but as a social relation with differential strategic effects. This means that the state is not something with an essential, fixed property such as a neutral coordinator of different social interests, an autonomous corporate actor with its own bureaucratic goals and interests, or the 'executive committee of the bourgeoisie' as often described by pluralists, elitists/statists and conventional marxists respectively. Rather, what the state is essentially determined by is the nature of the wider social relations in which it is situated, especially the balance of social forces.  Max Weber on the state and rationalization  In political sociology, one of Weber's most influential contributions is his \\"Politics as a Vocation\\" (Politik als Beruf) essay. Therein, Weber unveils the definition of the state as that entity that possesses a monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force.Weber, Max (1919/2015) \\"Politics as Vocation\\" in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society, edited and translated by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters, pp. 129‚Äì98 Weber wrote that politics is the sharing of state's power between various groups, and political leaders are those who wield this power. Weber distinguished three ideal types of political leadership (alternatively referred to as three types of domination, legitimisation or authority):Jeong Chun Hai @Ibrahim, & Nor Fadzlina Nawi. (2012). Principles of Public Administration: Malaysian Perspectives. Kuala Lumpur: Pearson Publishers. pp. 135‚Äì36 in \\"Politics as Vocation\\" by Max Weber in Weber's Rationalism and Modern Society, edited and translated by Tony Waters and Dagmar Waters. New York: Palgrave MacMillan 21919/2015 # charismatic authority (familial and religious), # traditional authority (patriarchs, patrimonialism, feudalism) and # legal authority (modern law and state, bureaucracy). In his view, every historical relation between rulers and ruled contained such elements and they can be analysed on the basis of this tripartite distinction. He notes that the instability of charismatic authority forces it to \\"routinise\\" into a more structured form of authority. In a pure type of traditional rule, sufficient resistance to a ruler can lead to a \\"traditional revolution\\". The move towards a rational-legal structure of authority, utilising a bureaucratic structure, is inevitable in the end. Thus this theory can be sometimes viewed as part of the social evolutionism theory. This ties to his broader concept of rationalisation by suggesting the inevitability of a move in this direction. Weber described many ideal types of public administration and government in Economy and Society (1922). His critical study of the bureaucratisation of society became one of the most enduring parts of his work. It was Weber who began the studies of bureaucracy and whose works led to the popularisation of this term. Many aspects of modern public administration go back to him and a classic, hierarchically organised civil service of the Continental type is called \\"Weberian civil service\\". As the most efficient and rational way of organising, bureaucratisation for Weber was the key part of the rational-legal authority and furthermore, he saw it as the key process in the ongoing rationalisation of the Western society. Weber's ideal bureaucracy is characterised by hierarchical organisation, by delineated lines of authority in a fixed area of activity, by action taken (and recorded) on the basis of written rules, by bureaucratic officials needing expert training, by rules being implemented neutrally and by career advancement depending on technical qualifications judged by organisations, not by individuals.  The italian school of elite theory  Vilfredo Pareto (1848‚Äì1923), Gaetano Mosca (1858‚Äì1941), and Robert Michels (1876‚Äì1936), were cofounders of the Italian school of elitism which influenced subsequent elite theory in the Western tradition.Robert A. Nye, The Anti-Democratic Sources of Elite Theory: Pareto, Mosca, Michels, Sage, 1977.J. J. Chambliss (ed.), Philosophy of Education: An Encyclopedia, Routledge, 2013, p. 179. The outlook of the Italian school of elitism is based on two ideas: Power lies in position of authority in key economic and political institutions. The psychological difference that sets elites apart is that they have personal resources, for instance intelligence and skills, and a vested interest in the government; while the rest are incompetent and do not have the capabilities of governing themselves, the elite are resourceful and strive to make the government work. For in reality, the elite would have the most to lose in a failed state. Pareto emphasized the psychological and intellectual superiority of elites, believing that they were the highest accomplishers in any field. He discussed the existence of two types of elites: Governing elites and Non-governing elites. He also extended the idea that a whole elite can be replaced by a new one and how one can circulate from being elite to non-elite. Mosca emphasized the sociological and personal characteristics of elites. He said elites are an organized minority and that the masses are an unorganized majority. The ruling class is composed of the ruling elite and the sub-elites. He divides the world into two group: Political class and Non-Political class. Mosca asserts that elites have intellectual, moral, and material superiority that is highly esteemed and influential. Sociologist Michels developed the iron law of oligarchy where, he asserts, social and political organizations are run by few individuals, and social organization and labor division are key. He believed that all organizations were elitist and that elites have three basic principles that help in the bureaucratic structure of political organization: # Need for leaders, specialized staff and facilities # Utilization of facilities by leaders within their organization # The importance of the psychological attributes of the leaders  Pluralism and power relations  Contemporary political sociology takes these questions seriously, but it is concerned with the play of power and politics across societies, which includes, but is not restricted to, relations between the state and society. In part, this is a product of the growing complexity of social relations, the impact of social movement organizing, and the relative weakening of the state as a result of globalization. To a significant part, however, it is due to the radical rethinking of social theory. This is as much focused now on micro questions (such as the formation of identity through social interaction, the politics of knowledge, and the effects of the contestation of meaning on structures), as it is on macro questions (such as how to capture and use state power). Chief influences here include cultural studies (Stuart Hall), post-structuralism (Michel Foucault, Judith Butler), pragmatism (Luc Boltanski), structuration theory (Anthony Giddens), and cultural sociology (Jeffrey C. Alexander). Political sociology attempts to explore the dynamics between the two institutional systems introduced by the advent of Western capitalist system that are the democratic constitutional liberal state and the capitalist economy. While democracy promises impartiality and legal equality before all citizens, the capitalist system results in unequal economic power and thus possible political inequality as well. For pluralists,Dahl, R. (1989). Democracy and its Critics, New Haven the distribution of political power is not determined by economic interests but by multiple social divisions and political agendas. The diverse political interests and beliefs of different factions work together through collective organizations to create a flexible and fair representation that in turn influences political parties which make the decisions. The distribution of power is then achieved through the interplay of contending interest groups. The government in this model functions just as a mediating broker and is free from control by any economic power. This pluralistic democracy however requires the existence of an underlying framework that would offer mechanisms for citizenship and expression and the opportunity to organize representations through social and industrial organizations, such as trade unions. Ultimately, decisions are reached through the complex process of bargaining and compromise between various groups pushing for their interests. Many factors, pluralists believe, have ended the domination of the political sphere by an economic elite. The power of organized labour and the increasingly interventionist state have placed restrictions on the power of capital to manipulate and control the state. Additionally, capital is no longer owned by a dominant class, but by an expanding managerial sector and diversified shareholders, none of whom can exert their will upon another. The pluralist emphasis on fair representation however overshadows the constraints imposed on the extent of choice offered. Bachrauch and BaratzBachrach, P. and M. Baratz (1963). Decision and non- decisions. American Political Science Review, Vol 57 (1963) examined the deliberate withdrawal of certain policies from the political arena. For example, organized movements that express what might seem as radical change in a society can often by portrayed as illegitimate.  The \\"power elite\\"  A main rival to pluralist theory in the United States was the theory of the \\"power elite\\" by sociologist C. Wright Mills. According to Mills, the eponymous \\"power elite\\" are those that occupy the dominant positions, in the dominant institutions (military, economic and political) of a dominant country, and their decisions (or lack of decisions) have enormous consequences, not only for the U.S. population but, \\"the underlying populations of the world.\\" The institutions which they head, Mills posits, are a triumvirate of groups that have succeeded weaker predecessors: (1) \\"two or three hundred giant corporations\\" which have replaced the traditional agrarian and craft economy, (2) a strong federal political order that has inherited power from \\"a decentralized set of several dozen states\\" and \\"now enters into each and every cranny of the social structure,\\" and (3) the military establishment, formerly an object of \\"distrust fed by state militia,\\" but now an entity with \\"all the grim and clumsy efficiency of a sprawling bureaucratic domain.\\" ortantly, and in distinction from modern American conspiracy theory, Mills explains that the elite themselves may not be aware of their status as an elite, noting that \\"often they are uncertain about their roles\\" and \\"without conscious effort, they absorb the aspiration to be ... The Onecide.\\" Nonetheless, he sees them as a quasi-hereditary caste. The members of the power elite, according to Mills, often enter into positions of societal prominence through educations obtained at establishment universities. The resulting elites, who control the three dominant institutions (military, economy and political system) can be generally grouped into one of six types, according to Mills: * the \\"Metropolitan 400\\" - members of historically notable local families in the principal American cities, generally represented on the Social Register * \\"Celebrities\\" - prominent entertainers and media personalities * the \\"Chief Executives\\" - presidents and CEOs of the most important companies within each industrial sector * the \\"Corporate Rich\\" - major landowners and corporate shareholders * the \\"Warlords\\" - senior military officers, most importantly the Joint Chiefs of Staff * the \\"Political Directorate\\" - \\"fifty-odd men of the executive branch\\" of the U.S. federal government, including the senior leadership in the Executive Office of the President, sometimes variously drawn from elected officials of the Democratic and Republican parties but usually professional government bureaucrats Mills formulated a very short summary of his book: \\"Who, after all, runs America? No one runs it altogether, but in so far as any group does, the power elite.\\"  T.H. Marshall on citizenship  T. H. Marshall's Social Citizenship is a political concept first highlighted in his essay, Citizenship and Social Class in 1949. Marshall's concept defines the social responsibilities the state has to its citizens or, as Marshall puts it, ‚Äúfrom [granting] the right to a modicum of economic welfare and security to the right to share to the full in the social heritage and to live the life of a civilized being according to the standards prevailing in the society‚Äù.Marshall, T H. Citizenship and Social Class: And Other Essays. Cambridge [Eng.: University Press, 1950. Print. One of the key points made by Marshall is his belief in an evolution of rights in England acquired via citizenship, from ‚Äúcivil rights in the eighteenth [century], political in the nineteenth, and social in the twentieth‚Äù. This evolution however, has been criticized by many for only being from the perspective of the white working man. Marshall concludes his essay with three major factors for the evolution of social rights and for their further evolution, listed below: # The lessening of the income gap # ‚ÄúThe great extension of the area of common culture and common experience‚Äù # An enlargement of citizenship and more rights granted to these citizens. Many of the social responsibilities of a state have since become a major part of many state‚Äôs policies (see United States Social Security). However, these have also become controversial issues as there is a debate over whether a citizen truly has the right to education and even more so, to social welfare.  Seymour Martin Lipset on the social \\"requisites\\" of democracy  In Political Man: The Social Bases of Politics political sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset provided a very influential analysis of the bases of democracy across the world. Larry Diamond and Gary Marks argue that \\"Lipset's assertion of a direct relationship between economic development and democracy has been subjected to extensive empirical examination, both quantitative and qualitative, in the past 30 years. And the evidence shows, with striking clarity and consistency, a strong causal relationship between economic development and democracy.\\"Diamond, Larry and Gary Marks .

He was chancellor of Austria from 1997 to 2000. Early career Born in Schwechat, Lower Austria, Klima started working for the then state- owned OMV oil company in 1969 and remained with the company up to the beginning of his political career in 1992, in his later years serving as a member of their management board. Minister Although Klima was then unknown to the majority of Austrians, in 1992 Chancellor Franz Vranitzky made him Minister of Transportation and Nationalised Industry, a position Klima held till 1996, when he became Finance Minister for a year. Chancellor of Austria In 1997, upon Vranitzky's resignation, Klima was elected chairman of the Social Democratic party and was sworn in as Chancellor of Austria, having renewed the grand coalition between his own party (Social Democratic Party of Austria, SP√ñ) and the Austrian People's Party (√ñVP), with Wolfgang Sch√ºssel serving as his vice chancellor. Influenced by the \\"Third Way\\" strategy of other European leaders such as Tony Blair and Gerhard Schr√∂der, under Klima's chairmanship the Social Democrats played down their allegiance to Marxism and thus to their own political roots and very clearly continued their move from the political left towards the centre, frequently using spin doctors and embracing populism as a political strategy. For example, further privatizations took place, and several public services that had been subsumed under the policies of the welfare state were tentatively reduced. As a consequence, a high percentage of the party's traditional working-class clientele, dissatisfied with Klima and his party, diverted their support to J√∂rg Haider's populist far-right Freedom Party (FP√ñ). However, just as his predecessor Vranitzky, Klima repeatedly and publicly announced that under no circumstances was he prepared to enter into a coalition with Haider's party. Following the elections of October 1999, in which the Social Democrats sustained heavy losses, Viktor Klima stepped down as the chairman of his party and was succeeded in this capacity by Alfred Gusenbauer. As chancellor he was succeeded by Wolfgang Sch√ºssel from the Austrian People's Party, who formed a coalition government with the Freedom Party in February 2000. Klima and his party heavily resented the fact that they were removed from rulership. While negotiations to form a new government on the basis of the October 1999 elections were ongoing, Klima \\"urged fellow EU leaders to help influence the coalition bargaining,EU leaders urged to keep Haider out. The Guardian, January 29, 2000. Archived\\" an unprecedented call for foreign interference in the political affairs of the sovereign Austrian state whose acting chancellor he still was at the time of this statement. While this failed to influence the outcome of the coalition talks, it led directly to the so-called \\"sanctions\\" against Austria, which had no basis whatsoever in the EU charter. Business career A few weeks later, with the help of his friend Gerhard Schr√∂der, Klima took up a senior management position with Volkswagen in Argentina at a time when the country was in a deep economic crisis. Klima became General Manager of Volkswagen's entire South American operations in mid-2006, and was under contract until 2011. Klima's background in politics as well as in economy predestines him for networking, a capability he has continued to cultivate on the highest level, such as with Argentina's former president, N√©stor Kirchner and his predecessor, Eduardo Duhalde. Klima retired in 2011 and lives on a cattle farm near Buenos Aires. References * \\"Austria.\\" Britannica Book of the Year, 2001. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2010.

It has a pay grade of E-7. The gunnery sergeant insignia consists of two M1 Garands centered vertically between three chevrons and two rockers. Responsibilities Gunnery sergeants in infantry units typically serve in the billet of \\"company gunnery sergeant\\" or as the platoon sergeant of 23‚Äì69 Marines in a reconnaissance platoon or a crew-served weapons platoon (i.e., machine guns, mortars, assault weapons/rockets, and anti-tank missiles). In artillery batteries, gunnery sergeants serve as the \\"battery gunnery sergeant\\" in the headquarters section of the firing battery's 94-member firing platoon. In tank and assault amphibian units gunnery sergeants may serve as a platoon sergeant of a 16-member platoon of four tanks or a 39-member platoon of 12 amphibious assault vehicles (AAVs), respectively. Tank and assault amphibian gunnery sergeants are also assigned as section leaders, in charge of either two tanks and 8 Marines or three AAVs and 9 Marines. Gunnery sergeants serving as platoon sergeants perform essentially the same duties as staff sergeant platoon sergeants, with the additional responsibility of supervising other staff non-commissioned officers (i.e., the gunnery/staff sergeants leading the organic sections of the platoon). The company/battery gunnery sergeant serves as the unit's operations chief and works with the executive officer to plan and coordinate unit training and operations. In combat, as a member of the unit's command group, he/she serves as a tactical adviser to the commanding officer/battery commander regarding employment of the unit and assists in operating the command post or tactical operations center. In garrison, he/she is responsible to the company/battery commander for supervising and coordinating individual training for the enlisted members of the company or battery and may assist the company/battery first sergeant in the administration and non-tactical leadership of the unit and by supervising the property (logistics) NCO, advising the officers, mentoring subordinate ranking Marines, and performing other duties as assigned. The company/battery gunnery sergeant has been described as a \\"hands on disciplinarian\\". An approximate former equivalent in the United States Army would have been \\"field first sergeant\\". Gunnery sergeants also serve as senior staff non-commissioned officers in military staff sections and headquarters and service companies and headquarters batteries at battalion/squadron, regiment/group, and division/wing headquarters levels. Typical gunnery sergeant billets in combat support companies and battalion, regiment, and division headquarters are: Personnel Administration Chief, Staff Secretary Personnel/Administration Clerk, Administration Assistance Chief, Division Reproduction NCO, Equal Opportunity Advisor, Human Affairs NCO, Career Planner, Intelligence Chief, Operations Chief, Operations Assistant, Watch Team NCOIC, Schools Coordinator, MAGTF Plans Chief, Cinematography Specialist, Logistics Chief, Embarkation Chief, Infantry Weapons Chief, Analyst and Review Fiscal Chief, Information Systems Maintenance Chief, Public Affairs Chief, Communications-Electronics Maintenance Section Chief, Radio Chief, Wire Chief, Motor Transport Chief, Battery Motor Transport Chief, Roadmaster, Assistant Roadmaster, Maintenance Chief, Assistant Maintenance Chief, Management Team Inspector, Engineer Equipment Chief, and Mess Manager. In Command Element, Combat Logistics Element, and Aviation Combat Element organizations, gunnery sergeants serve in basically similar positions of responsibility, authority, and accountability as their Ground Combat Element counterparts, with perhaps slightly different titles, such as Division/Branch Chief/NCOIC or Department SNCOIC (Staff Non- Commissioned Officer-In-Charge) in the aircraft maintenance department of a Marine aircraft squadron. Non Fleet Marine Force (or other operating forces) assignments may include supervisory or staff positions in recruiting, drill instructor, Marine Security Guard, Naval ROTC instructor or service school instructor, and major/joint/combined headquarters commands. History and insignia The rank of gunnery sergeant in the Marine Corps was established by the Navy personnel act of March 3, 1899 () reflecting the duties of Marines in ship's detachments. The original insignia was three chevrons point up with three straight \\"ties\\" with an insignia of a bursting bomb over a crossed rifle and naval gun. From 1904 to 1929 the insignia went to three stripes only over a bursting bomb on top of crossed rifles. In 1929, like the rank of first sergeant, two \\"rockers\\" were added beneath the stripes with the same insignia in the middle. In 1937 the middle insignia was dropped. The rank was replaced by technical sergeant in 1946 until restored in 1959, when the crossed rifles insignia were added to Marine chevrons. Qualifications The qualifications and selection of gunnery sergeants in the \\"Old Corps\\" was explained in congressional testimony in 1912: > The following qualifications are required for appointment to the rank of > gunnery sergeant: A candidate for appointment as gunnery sergeant in the > United States Marine Corps should be sufficiently proficient in the drill > regulations to thoroughly drill recruits and to drill the squad and company. > They should be thoroughly conversant with the nomenclature of the rapid-fire > and machine guns used in the naval service and be sufficiently acquainted > with their drill to be able to act as gun captains and to instruct the > enlisted in their duties at such guns. They should have knowledge of the > kinds and quantities of ammunition used in those guns. They should have a > thorough knowledge of the instructions pertaining to target practice. They > should have sufficient knowledge of the system of accountability of the > United States Marine Corps to take charge of and properly render the > accounts of a guard aboard ship, and should be competent in all respects to > perform the duties of a first sergeant in charge of a guard on ship to which > no marine officer is attached; also a knowledge of the duties involved in > the subsistence of Marines ordered on detached duty, as well as the duties > of an officer in command of a part of a landing party on shore. Gunnery > sergeants are selected from the sergeants of the corps on account of > superior intelligence, reliability, and mechanical knowledge. The grade was > provided with the idea that they should be somewhat higher in standard than > first sergeants; that their knowledge of ordnance and of gunnery should be > such that they would be able to make minor repairs to guns‚Äîto supervise all > work in connection with guns; to command detachments which were of such size > as not to warrant a commissioned officer being assigned to them. They are at > present in command of marine detachments at naval magazines; are performing > duty as first sergeants of regularly organized companies at various posts; > in connection with the repair of guns at various Marine Corps stations; in > connection with the training of recruits; and, in general, performing duties > that require the utmost reliability. For a number of years candidates for > promotion to this grade were required to take a special course of > instruction before receiving their warrants, but recently, because of the > lack of first sergeants and the numerous small detachments organized, it has > been necessary to detail many of them for duty as first sergeants. As soon > as there are a sufficient number of first sergeants available, it is > intended to reestablish the school and to give gunnery sergeants a thorough > course of instruction prior to their permanent appointment to this grade, in > order that they may be experts in all matters pertaining to the care and > preservation of naval ordnance. At the time of this congressional testimony there were 82 gunnery sergeants in the USMC. Culture Gunnery sergeants are commonly referred to by the informal abbreviation \\"gunny\\". This nickname, which is usually regarded as a title of both esteem and camaraderie, is generally acceptable for use in all but formal and ceremonial situations. Use of the term by lower-ranking personnel, however, remains at the gunnery sergeant's discretion. Notable gunnery sergeants *John Basilone *Jack Coughlin *R.

For example, the producers of a television or radio program might wish to produce the aural illusion that a conversation is taking place in a large room or a cave; these effects can be accomplished by playing the recording of the conversation inside an echo chamber, with an accompanying microphone to catch the reverberation. Nowadays effects units are more widely used to create such effects, but echo chambers are still used today, such as the famous echo chambers at Capitol Studios. In music, the use of acoustic echo and reverberation effects has taken many forms and dates back many hundreds of years. Medieval and Renaissance sacred music relied heavily on the composers' extensive understanding and use of the complex natural reverberation and echoes inside churches and cathedrals. This early acoustical knowledge informed the design of opera houses and concert halls in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Architects designed these to create internal reflections that would enhance and project sound from the stage in the days before electrical amplification. Sometimes echo effects were the unintentional side effect of the architectural or engineering design, such as for the Hamilton Mausoleum in Scotland, which has one of the longest reverberation times of any building. Electro-acoustic Developments in electronics in the early 20th century‚Äîspecifically the invention of the amplifier and the microphone‚Äîled to the creation of the first artificial echo chambers, built for radio and recording studios. Until the 1950s echo and reverberation were typically created by a combination of electrical and physical methods. Acoustically speaking, the \\"classic novel\\" echo chamber creates echoes in the same way as they are created in churches or caves‚Äîthey are all simply large, enclosed, empty spaces with floors and walls made of hard materials (such as polished stone or concrete) that reflect sound waves well. The basic purpose of such chambers is to add colour and depth to the original sound, and to simulate the rich natural reverberation that is a feature of large concert halls. The development of artificial echo/reverberation chambers was important for sound recording because of the limitations of early recording systems. Except in the case of live performances, most commercial popular recordings were made in specially constructed studios. These rooms were both heavily insulated to exclude external noises and internally somewhat anechoic‚Äîthat is, they were designed not to produce any internal echoes or sound reverberation. Because virtually every sound in everyday life is a complex mixture of direct sound from the source and its echoes and reverberations, audiences naturally found the totally 'dry' and reverberation-free sound of early recordings unappealing. Consequently, record producers and engineers quickly came up with an effective method of adding 'artificial' echo and reverberation that experts could control with a remarkable degree of accuracy. Producing echo and reverberation in this form of echo chamber is simple. A signal from the studio mixing desk‚Äîsuch as a voice or instrument‚Äîis fed to a large high-fidelity loudspeaker located at one end of the chamber. One or more microphones are placed along the length of the room and these pick up both the sound from the speaker and its reflections off the walls of the chamber. The farther away from the loudspeaker, the more echo and reverberation the microphone(s) picks up and the louder the reverberation becomes in relation to the source. The signal from the microphone line is then fed back to the mixing desk, where the echo/reverberation-enhanced sound can be blended with the original 'dry' input. An example of this physical effect can be heard on the 1978 David Bowie song \\"Heroes\\", from the album of the same name. The song, produced by Tony Visconti, was recorded in the large concert hall in the Hansa recording studio in Berlin and Visconti has since been much praised for the striking sound he achieved on Bowie's vocals. Visconti placed three microphones at intervals along the length of the hall, one very close to Bowie, one halfway down the hall and the third at the far end of the hall. During the recording, Bowie sang each verse progressively louder than the last and as he increased volume in each verse, Visconti opened up each of the three microphones in turn, from closest to farthest. Thus, in the first verse, Bowie's voice sounds close, warm and present; by the end of the song, Visconti has mixed in a large amount of signal from all three microphones, giving Bowie's voice a strikingly reverberant sound. The original echo chamber at EMI's Abbey Road Studios was improved by the late Clive Robinson, who was site foreman at the time of construction. His construction and engineering team perfected the echo booth at Abbey Road Studios in London. It was one of the first studios in the world to be specially built for recording purposes when it was established in 1931; it remains in place and is a prime example of the early 20th-century electro- acoustic echo chamber. Buildings such as churches, church halls and ballrooms have often been chosen as recording sites for classical and other music because of their rich, 'natural' echo and reverberation characteristics. Famous examples include Sir George Martin's AIR Studios at Lyndhurst Hall in Belsize Park, London, a large, vaulted 19th century building originally constructed as a church and missionary school. Montreal's Church of St. Eustache is the favoured recording venue of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra and many others, and is much sought after for classical recordings because of its unique acoustic characteristics. The distinctive reverberation on the early hit records by Bill Haley & His Comets was created by recording the band under the domed ceiling of Decca's studio in New York City, located in a former ballroom called The Pythian Temple. Some recording companies and many small independent labels could not afford large purpose-built echo chambers such as the Abbey Road chamber, so enterprising producers and engineers often made use of any large reverberant space. Corridors, lift-wells, stairwells, tiled bathrooms and toilets were all used as substitute echo chambers. Many famous soul music and R&B; music recordings released by the New York-based Atlantic Records feature echo and reverb effects produced by simply placing a speaker and microphone in the office toilet‚Äîa process also used by Producer/Engineer Bruce Botnick while recording The Doors for their 1970 album L.A. Woman. Electronic echo machines The Roland RE-501 is an audio effects device capable of creating echo, chorus, reverb and sound on sound type effects In the 1950s and 1960s, the development of magnetic audio tape technology made it possible to duplicate physical echo and reverberation effects entirely electronically. The Watkins Copicat, designed and built by renowned British electronics engineer Charlie Watkins in the late 1950s, is typical of this kind of electronic delay device. Tape echo units use an endless loop of magnetic tape, which is drawn across a series of recording and playback heads. When a signal from a voice or instrument is fed into the machine, it records the signal onto the tape loop as it passed over the record head. As the tape advances, the newly recorded signal is then picked up by a series of playback heads mounted in line with the record head. These play the sound back as the signal passes over each head in turn, creating the classic rippling or cascading echoes that are typical of tape echo units. The number of playback heads determines the number of repeats, and the physical distance between each playback head determines the ratio of delay between each repeat of the sound (usually some fraction of a second). The actual length of the delay between each repeat can be varied by a pitch control that alters the speed of the tape loop across the heads. Typically, the playback heads of tape echo machines are also connected to controls that allow the user to determine the volume of each echo relative to the original signal. Another control (sometimes called \\"regeneration\\") allows the signal from the playback heads to be fed back into and variably mixed with the original input signal, creating a distinctive \\"feedback\\" effect that adds more and more noise to the loop with each repeat. If fully activated, this control ultimately produces a continuous feedback loop of pure noise. Roland manufactured various models of magnetic tape echo and reverb sound effect machines from 1973 until the introduction of digital sound effect machines. Tape echo that has few repeats and a very short delay between each repeat is often referred to as \\"slapback\\" echo. This distinctive sound is one of the key sonic characteristics of 1950s rock and roll and rockabilly, and can be heard on the classic mid-50s Sun Records recordings by Elvis Presley and others. This effect was a result of the unintentional combination of the recording and monitoring tape heads (physically located a few inches apart) which, on playback, created a gap that inadvertently produced the iconic \\"slap-back\\" effect. =Digital echo= Maxon DE-01 digital echo sound effect pedal With the advent of digital signal processing and other digital audio technologies, it became possible to simulate almost every \\"echo chamber\\" effect by processing the signal digitally. Because digital devices are able to simulate an almost limitless variety of real reverberant spaces as well as replicate the classic tape-based echo effects, physical echo chambers fell into disuse. However, as noted above, naturally reverberant spaces such as churches continue to be used as recording venues for classical and other forms of acoustic music. Oil-can delay method An alternative echo system was the so-called \\"oil-can delay\\" method, which uses electrostatic rather than electromagnetic recording. Invented by Ray Lubow, the oil-can method uses a rotating disc of anodized aluminium coated with a suspension of carbon particles. An AC signal to a conductive neoprene wiper transfers the charge to the high impedance disc. As the particles pass by the wiper, they act as thousands of tiny capacitors, holding a small part of the charge. A second wiper reads this representation of the signal, and sends it to a voltage amplifier that mixes it with the original source. To protect the charge held in each capacitor and to lubricate the entire assembly, the disc runs inside a sealed can with enough of a special oil to assure that an even coating is applied as it spins. The effect resembles an echo, but the whimsical nature of the storage medium causes variations in the sound that can be heard as a vibrato effect. Some early models featured control circuitry designed to feed the output of the read wiper to the write head, causing a reverberant effect as well. Many different companies marketed these devices under various names. Fender sold the Dimension IV, the Variable Delay, the Echo-Reverb I, II, and III, and included an oil can in their Special Effects box. Gibson sold the GA-4RE from 1965‚Äì7. Ray Lubow himself sold many different versions under the Tel-Ray/Morley brand, starting out in the early sixties with the Ad-n-echo, and eventually producing the Echo-ver-brato, the Electrostatic Delay Line, and many others into the eighties.

It is prevalent in Central, Northern and Southeast Europe (in particular Germany, Austria, Albania, Bulgaria, Finland, Slovenia, Serbia, Croatia, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Switzerland, Scandinavia, and the Baltic states), and also (to a lesser extent) in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the UK. In the United States it is also known as 'entertainer music' or 'German hit mix'. Michelle performing in Berlin, 15 March 2017, where she sang Schlagers as well as ballads Typical schlager tracks are either sweet, sentimental ballads with a simple, catchy melody or light pop tunes. Lyrics typically center on love, relationships, and feelings. The northern variant of schlager (notably in Finland) has taken elements from Nordic and Slavic folk songs, with lyrics tending towards melancholic and elegiac themes. Musically, schlager bears similarities to styles such as easy listening. The German word Schlager is also a loanword in some other languages (such as Hungarian, Lithuanian, Serbian, Russian, Hebrew, and Romanian, for example), where it retained its meaning of a \\"(musical) hit\\". The style has been frequently represented at the Eurovision Song Contest and has been popular since the contest began in 1956, although it is gradually being replaced by other pop music styles. Over time, schlager music has gradually shifted on to electronic music rather than generic pop music, due to its widespread use of synthesizers throughout its various implementations in recent decades. Variations by country =The Netherlands and Flanders= A Dutch version of the schlager is called the levenslied (literally 'life song', i.e. 'song about real life'). It is a sentimental, Dutch-language subgenre of pop music. Typical levenslied lyrics treat subjects such as love, misery, and nostalgia, besides longing for sunny, exotic holiday places. A typical levenslied has catchy, simple rhythms and melodies (in common with many pop and folk tunes) and is structured in couplets and refrains. Traditional instruments in levenslied music are the accordion and the barrel organ: for example, Nicole and Hugo. =Finland= The roots of Finnish schlager () date back to the interwar period and popular singers such as Georg Malmst√©n and Matti Jurva. A particularly notable song was opera singer Ture Ara's \\"Emma\\" in 1929. Schlager tradition has an important place in Finnish popular music, and its melodic language has also influenced Finnish rock. Schlager shares its audience with Finnish tango music; both are popular among older and middle-aged Finns. A particular feature of Finnish schlager music are \\"translation schlagers\\" (). Noteworthy Finnish schlager composers include Juha Vainio. According to polls of Finnish audiences, \\"Hopeinen kuu\\", (originally \\"Guarda che luna\\" by Walter Malgoni and Bruno Pallesi), recorded in Finnish by Olavi Virta and \\"Satulinna\\" (composed by Jukka Kuoppam√§ki and sung by Jari Sillanp√§√§) are the most popular Finnish schlagers of all time. =Germany and Austria= Austrian singer and presenter Andy Borg and Swiss singer Francine Jordi The roots of German schlager are old: The first use of the word Schlager was in a opening night critique by the \\"Wiener Fremdenblatt\\" on Februar 17, 1867 about The Blue Danube by Johann Strauss II.Norbert Linke: Musik erobert die Welt. Wie die Wiener Familie Strau√ü die ‚ÄûUnterhaltungsmusik‚Äú revolutionierte. Herold, Wien 1987, , S. 204. One ancestor of schlager may be operetta, which was highly popular in the early twentieth century. In the 1920s and 1930s, the Comedian Harmonists and Rudi Schuricke laid the foundations for this new music. Well-known schlager singers of the 1950s and early 1960s include Lale Andersen, Freddy Quinn, Ivo Robiƒá, Gerhard Wendland, Caterina Valente, Margot Eskens and Conny Froboess. Schlager reached a peak of popularity in Germany and Austria in the 1960s (featuring Peter Alexander and Roy Black) and the early 1970s. From the mid-1990s through the early 2000s, schlager also saw an extensive revival in Germany by, for example, Guildo Horn, Dieter Thomas Kuhn, Michelle and Petra Perle. Dance clubs would play a stretch of schlager titles during the course of an evening, and numerous new bands were formed specialising in 1970s schlager cover versions and newer material. In Hamburg in the 2010s, schlager fans still gathered annually by the hundreds of thousands, dressing in 1970s clothing for street parades called \\"Schlager Move\\". The Schlager Move designation is also used for a number of smaller schlager music parties in several major German cities throughout the year. (This revival is sometimes associated with kitsch and camp.) German artist Helene Fischer Germans view schlager as their country music, and American country and Tex-Mex music are both major elements in schlager culture. (\\"Is This the Way to Amarillo\\" is regularly played in schlager contexts, usually in the English-language original.) Popular schlager singers include Roland Kaiser, Hansi Hinterseer, J√ºrgen Drews, Andrea Berg, Heintje Simons, Helene Fischer, Nicole, Claudia Jung, Andrea J√ºrgens, Michelle, Kristina Bach, Marianne Rosenberg, Simone Stelzer, Daniela Alfinito, Semino Rossi, Vicky Leandros, Leonard, DJ √ñtzi, and Andreas Gabalier. Stylistically, schlager continues to influence German \\"party pop\\": that is, music most often heard in apr√®s-ski bars and Majorcan mass discos. Contemporary schlager is often mingled with Volkst√ºmliche Musik. If it is not part of an ironic kitsch revival, a taste for both styles of music is commonly associated with folksy pubs, fun fairs, and bowling league venues. Between 1975 and 1981 German-style schlager became disco-oriented, in many ways merging with the mainstream disco music of the time. Singers such as Marianne Rosenberg recorded both schlager and disco hits. The song \\"Moskau\\" by German band Dschinghis Khan was one of the earliest of modern, dance-based schlager, again showing how schlager of the 1970s and early 1980s merged with mainstream disco and Euro-disco. Dschinghis Khan, while primarily a disco band, also played disco-influenced schlager. =Romania= In Romania, schlager is known as \\"MuzicƒÉ U≈üoarƒÉ\\", which could be translated literally as \\"Easy Music\\" and, in the most common sense, this music is synonym with \\"MuzicƒÉ de stradƒÉ\\" (from French \\"estrade\\", which means \\"podium\\"), defining a branch of Pop music developed in Romania after World War II, which appears generally in the form of easy danceable songs, made on arrangements, which are performed by orchestras. This music shows many similarities with Western Popular music, as most songs could be defined as a form of Schlager. It supported influences from other similar melodic styles, like Musica leggera italiana (from Italy) and canci√≥n mel√≥dica (from Spain). This Romanian style of music was popularized abroad through the international Golden Stag Festival, held in Bra»ôov, since 1968. The most representative singers of that era are those from the 1980s, 1970s and rarely, 1960s: Aurelian Andreescu, Elena C√¢rstea, Corina Chiriac, Mirabela Dauer, Stela Enache, Luigi Ionescu, Horia Moculescu, Margareta P√¢slaru, Angela Similea, Dan SpƒÉtaru and Aura Urziceanu. =Sweden= In Sweden, schlager has waxed and waned in popularity since at least the 1930s. It still enjoys a large place in Swedish culture. Although the original schlager was heavily influenced by operetta, cabaret, variety- style music, and jazz, this started to change in the 1960s, when schlager music became more pop-oriented. Since the early 1990s, schlager songs have included elements of rock and techno. Therefore, modern Swedish schlager little resembles that of the 1940s. Despite this, many old schlager tunes are still popular; they are performed by many artists and at the Alls√•ng p√• Skansen. Melodifestivalen, often features modern Schlager hits, giving it a second name by some: Schlagerfestivalen The Melodifestival (which selects the Swedish competitor at the Eurovision Song Contest) is popularly also called Schlagerfestivalen (\\"the Schlager Festival\\") or Schlager-SM (Swedish schlager championship), since it has traditionally been characterised by schlager songs. The Eurovision Song Contest has also been called \\"Eurovisionsschlagerfestivalen\\" (Eurovision schlager festival) or schlager-EM (\\"European schlager championship\\"). The amount of Swedish schlager has decreased in recent years, but schlager is still the most likely genre to win the competition (\\"Evighet\\" ( in 2006 by Carola and \\"Hero\\" by Charlotte Perrelli in 2008, for example). Melodifestivalen is the most popular TV program in Sweden. It is broadcast annually, and in 2006 an estimated 47 percent of the Swedish population watched the final. In Sweden \\"schlager\\" is often used to refer to Eurovision-participating songs. Two characteristics of Swedish schlager are a pronounced key change before the final chorus and their three-minute length (the maximum song length permitted at the Eurovision Song Contest). Some Swedes dispute the meaning of \\"schlager\\" with respect to Swedish music; it may be used indiscriminately to describe popular music, Melodifestivalen songs, Eurovision songs, dansband music, and any song with a catchy chorus. Both Bj√∂rn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson of ABBA were influenced by schlager early in their careers. =United Kingdom= British schlager singer Tony Christie In the United Kingdom, schlager is often categorized simply as pop.Nico Roicke, \\"Schlager louts: meet Germany's biggest pop stars\\", The Guardian, 15 March 2011. Retrieved 13 July 2015 The style was especially popular there between the 1950s and 1980s, with singers such as Tony Christie, who enjoyed success among schlager audiences in both Germany and the UK; Engelbert Humperdinck, most notably with schlager hit \\"Release Me\\"; and Petula Clark, who gained her first number 1 in the UK Singles Chart with \\"Sailor\\", the English schlager version of \\"Seemann (Deine Heimat ist das Meer)\\", originally performed by Austrian singer Lolita. Artists from other countries have also had schlager hits in the UK. American singers Al Martino and Roy Orbison both entered the British charts with schlager hits \\"Blue Spanish Eyes\\" and \\"Only the Lonely\\" respectively. Within the American popular music lexicon, most schlager music falls vaguely between country music and traditional pop music; the Nashville sound (which produced \\"Only the Lonely\\" and the original versions of \\"Release Me,\\" among other songs Humperdinck would cover in that era) produced numerous songs fitting the schlager sound. Billy Fury's \\"Halfway to Paradise\\" reached number 3 in the UK Singles Chart. From the Netherlands and the UK, Dutch band Pussycat reached number 1 with the song \\"Mississippi\\". German and Austrian singers have also had hits in the UK; German singer Nicole charted in the UK with \\"A Little Peace,\\" peaking at number 1. That song also won Germany the Eurovision Song Contest in 1982. The UK has itself entered many schlager artists into the Eurovision Song Contest; for example, Brotherhood of Man won for the UK in 1976 with \\"Save Your Kisses for Me\\". Distinctively German schlager (including Volksmusik and its modern version Volkst√ºmliche Musik), sung in German, has also attracted a small fan base in the United Kingdom, including BBC Radio Manchester commentator Ian Cheeseman. Germany's top-selling schlager singer Helene Fischer released the album The English Ones in 2010, with several English-language versions of her German hits for her Anglophone fans. British schlager singers including Ross Antony, Tony Christie and Roger Whittaker have appeared on shows such as Musikantenstadl and ZDF Fernsehgarten. =Yugoslavia= The first schlager music in Yugoslavia began to appear in the late 1940s. The first (and most influential) festival of schlager music was the Zagreb Festival of Popular Music (later known as Zagrebfest), which began in 1953 and still takes place annually in Zagreb. Many schlagers () performed at Zagrebfest over the past five decades are an integral part of the Croatian and Yugoslav pop music scene. The first schlager singers were Ivo Robiƒá and Rajka Vali, but over time Zagreb school of schlagers came to include such singers as Vice Vukov, Arsen Dediƒá, Hrvoje Hegedu≈°iƒá, Ivica Percl, Gabi Novak, Frano Lasiƒá, Jasna Zlokiƒá, Zdravko ƒåoliƒá, and many others. Main composers of schlagers included Fedor Kopsa, Kre≈°imir Oblak, Ferdo Pomykalo, Miljenko Prohaska, Nikica Kalogjera, Bojan Hohnjec, Vanja Lisak, Zvonko ≈†pi≈°iƒá, Ivica Stamaƒá and Hrvoje Hegedu≈°iƒá. Some Zagrebfest artists (such as Ivo Robiƒá and Tereza Kesovija) would go on to have successful careers in Germany and France. Other pioneers include Darko Kraljiƒá (from Zagreb), who worked in Belgrade. He is best known by his hit \\"ƒåamac na Tisi\\" (sung by Lola Novakoviƒá and popular in revolutionary Hungary) and his music for the film Ljubav i moda (\\"Devojko mala\\" and \\"Pod sjajem zvezda\\", performed by Vokalni kvartet Predraga Ivanoviƒáa).
