During this month, international events were linked to domestic troubles, particularly the German Revolution. Overview In the wake of the German Revolution, Marxist councils of workers and soldiers (Soldaten- und Arbeiterr√§te) formed in Mulhouse on November 9 and in Colmar and Strasbourg on November 10, in parallel to other such bodies set up in the general revolutionary atmosphere of the expiring Reich and in imitation of the Russian equivalent soviets. Under the Empire of 1871‚Äì1918, the territory constituting the Reichsland (or Imperial Province) of Alsace- Lorraine was administered directly by the imperial government in Berlin, and was granted some measure of autonomy in 1911. Similarly, the Kaiser was also the local sovereign of the Land, so that Kaiser Wilhelm II's abdication on November 9 involved the fall of the monarchy both at the national and at the regional level, with a consequent legal power vacuum. In this chaotic situation the Landtag proclaimed itself the supreme authority of the land with the name of Nationalrat, the Soviet of Strasbourg claimed the foundation of a Republic of Alsace-Lorraine, while SPD Reichstag representative for Colmar, Jacques Peirotes, announced the establishment of the French rule, asking Paris to send troops quickly.Jacques Fortier, ¬´ La chute de l'Empire ¬ª, Derni√®res Nouvelles d'Alsace, 16 november 2008 (Fr.) While the soviet councils disbanded themselves with the departure of the German troops between November 11 and 17,Jean-No√´l Grandhomme, ¬´ Le retour de l'Alsace-Lorraine ¬ª, L'Histoire, number 336, november 2008 (Fr.) the arrival of the French Army stabilized the situation: French troops put the region under military occupation and entered Strasbourg on November 21. The Nationalrat proclaimed the return of Alsace to France on December 5, even though this process did not gain international recognition until the signature of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. Council of Strasbourg Ren√© Beeh (1886-1922), La R√©volution (1918-1919, Mus√©e d'art moderne et contemporain de Strasbourg) The Alsace-Lorraine Soviet Republic (or Alsace-Lorraine Republic of Councils; ; ; ; Moselle Franconian/) was a short- lived Soviet republic created during the German Revolution at the end of World War I in the province of Alsace-Lorraine, which had been part of Germany since 1871. Disquiet had spread amongst Alsatian soldiers, particularly in early 1918. There was a mutiny by Alsatian troops at the Beverloo Camp on 12 May 1918. In October 1918, the Imperial German Navy, whose surface ships had largely remained in port after the Battle of Jutland (1916), was ordered to leave port to fight the British Royal Navy. However, the naval troops refused to obey: this led to a sailors' mutiny at Kiel. The mutineers took over the main military port and were quickly joined by workers and the trade unions. The revolution spread quickly across Germany, overthrowing the monarchy within a few days. At that time, about 15,000 Alsatians and Lorrainers had been incorporated into the Imperial Navy. Several of them joined the insurrection, and decided to rouse their homeland to revolt. On 8 November, the proclamation of a Republic of Councils in Bavaria was aired in Strasbourg, the capital of Alsace. Inspired by this, thousands of demonstrators rallied on the Place Kl√©ber, the main square in Strasbourg, to acclaim the first insurgents returning from northern Germany. A train controlled by insurgents was blocked on the Kehl bridge, and a loyal commander ordered to shoot on the train. One insurgent was killed, but his fellows took control of the city of Kehl. From Strasbourg, the revolution spread throughout Alsace and Lorraine, and similar Soviets were established in Haguenau, Mulhouse, S√©lestat, Colmar, Metz, and other cities. The insurgent seamen established the Soldiers' Council of Strasbourg, and took control of the city. A council of workers and soldiers was then established, with the leader of the brewery workers' union presiding. Red flags flew all over the city, including on the spire of the cathedral. An amnesty was declared, and freedom of the press was proclaimed. Factory workers went on strike, demanding higher wages; the Soviets (councils) raised wages by decree against the opposition of the factory owners. The Social Democratic Party leader in Strasbourg, Jacques Peirotes, then asked the French generals to send in their troops to restore order. Eleven days later, France occupied and incorporated Alsace-Lorraine. French soldiers under the command of general Henri Gouraud entered the suburbs of Strasbourg on November 22, 1918, strikes were terminated by force, and agitators were arrested. The streets named \\"Rue du 22 novembre\\" in Strasbourg and Mulhouse commemorate the return of Alsace to France. The region lost its recently acquired autonomy and reverted to the centralised French system as the d√©partements of Moselle and Haut and Bas- Rhin.

In contrast, a classically behaving neutron or molecule will strike the same surface much like a thrown ball, hitting only at one atomic-scale location where it is either absorbed or scattered. Quantum reflection provides a powerful experimental demonstration of particle-wave duality, since it is the extended quantum wave packet of the particle, rather than the particle itself, that reflects from the larger surface. Definition Quantum reflection became an important branch of physics in the 21st century. In a workshop about quantum reflection,Quantum Reflection, workshop; October 22‚Äì24, 2007, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA; http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/itamp/QuantumReflection.html the following definition of quantum reflection was suggested: > Quantum reflection is a classically counterintuitive phenomenon whereby the > motion of particles is reverted \\"against the force\\" acting on them. This > effect manifests the wave nature of particles and influences collisions of > ultracold atoms and interaction of atoms with solid surfaces. Observation of quantum reflection has become possible thanks to recent advances in trapping and cooling atoms. Reflection of slow atoms Although the principles of quantum mechanics apply to any particles, usually the term \\"quantum reflection\\" means reflection of atoms from a surface of condensed matter (liquid or solid). The full potential experienced by the incident atom does become repulsive at a very small distance from the surface (of order of size of atoms). This is when the atom becomes aware of the discrete character of material. This repulsion is responsible for the classical scattering one would expect for particles incident on a surface. Such scattering is diffuse rather than specular, and so this component of the reflection is easy to distinguish. Indeed, to reduce this part of the physical process, a grazing angle of incidence is used; this enhances the quantum reflection. This requirement of small incident velocities for the particles means that the non- relativistic approximation to quantum mechanics is all that is required. Single-dimensional approximation So far, one usually considers the single- dimensional case of this phenomenon, that is when the potential has translational symmetry in two directions (say y and z), such that only a single coordinate (say x) is important. In this case one can examine the specular reflection of a slow neutral atom from a solid state surface . Where one has an atom in a region of free space close to a material capable of being polarized, a combination of the pure van der Waals interaction, and the related Casimir-Polder interaction attracts the atom to the surface of the material. The latter force dominates when the atom is comparatively far from the surface, and the former when the atom comes closer to the surface. The intermediate region is controversial as it is dependent upon the specific nature and quantum state of the incident atom. The condition for a reflection to occur as the atom experiences the attractive potential can be given by the presence of regions of space where the WKB approximation to the atomic wave- function breaks down. If, in accordance with this approximation we write the wavelength of the gross motion of the atom system toward the surface as a quantity local to every region along the x axis, :: lambdaleft(xright)=frac{h}{sqrt{2mleft(E-Vleft(xright)right)}} where m is the atomic mass, ~E~ is its energy, and ~V(x)~ is the potential it experiences, then it is clear that we cannot give meaning to this quantity where, :: leftfrac{dlambdaleft(xright)}{dx}rightsim 1 That is, in regions of space where the variation of the atomic wavelength is significant over its own length (i.e. the gradient of V(x) is steep), there is no meaning in the approximation of a local wavelength. This breakdown occurs irrespective of the sign of the potential, ~V(x)~. In such regions part of the incident atom wave-function may become reflected. Such a reflection may occur for slow atoms experiencing the comparatively rapid variation of the van der Waals potential near the material surface. This is just the same kind of phenomenon as occurs when light passes from a material of one refractive index to another of a significantly different index over a small region of space. Irrespective of the sign of the difference in index, there will be a reflected component of the light from the interface. Indeed, quantum reflection from the surface of solid-state wafer allows one to make the quantum optical analogue of a mirror - the atomic mirror - to a high precision. Experiments with grazing incidence Fig. A. Observation of quantum reflection at grazing incidence Practically, in many experiments with quantum reflection from Si, the grazing incidence angle is used (figure A). The set-up is mounted in a vacuum chamber to provide a several-meter path free of atoms; a good vacuum (at the level of 10‚àí7 Torr or ) is required. The magneto-optical trap (MOT) is used to collect cold atoms, usually excited He or Ne, approaching the point-like source of atoms. The excitation of atoms is not essential for the quantum reflection but it allows the efficient trapping and cooling using optical frequencies. In addition, the excitation of atoms allows the registration at the micro-channel plate (MCP) detector (bottom of the figure). Movable edges are used to stop atoms which do not go toward the sample (for example a Si plate), providing the collimated atomic beam. The He-Ne laser was used to control the orientation of the sample and measure the grazing angle ~theta~. At the MCP, there was observed relatively intensive strip of atoms which come straightly (without reflection) from the MOT, by-passing the sample, strong shadow of the sample (the thickness of this shadow could be used for rough control of the grazing angle), and the relatively weak strip produced by the reflected atoms. The ratio ~r~ of density of atoms registered at the center of this strip to the density of atoms at the directly illuminated region was considered as efficiency of quantum reflection, i.e., reflectivity. This reflectivity strongly depends on the grazing angle and speed of atoms. In the experiments with Ne atoms, usually just fall down, when the MOT is suddenly switched off. Then, the speed of atoms is determined as ~v=sqrt{2gh}~, where ~g~ is acceleration of free fall, and ~h~ is distance from the MOT to the sample. In experiments described, this distance was of order of , providing the speed of order of . Then, the transversal wavenumber can be calculated as ~k=sin(theta)frac{mv}{hbar}~, where ~m~ is mass of the atom, and hbar is the Planck constant. In the case with He, the additional resonant laser could be used to release the atoms and provide them an additional velocity; the delay since the release of the atoms till the registration allowed to estimate this additional velocity; roughly, ~v=frac{1}{t!~h}~, where ~t~ is time delay since the release of atoms till the click at the detector. Practically, v could vary from . Although the scheme at the figure looks simple, the extend facility is necessary to slow atoms, trap them and cool to millikelvin temperature, providing a micrometre size source of cold atoms. Practically, the mounting and maintaining of this facility (not shown in the figure) is the heaviest job in the experiments with quantum reflection of cold atoms. The possibility of an experiment with the quantum reflection with just a pinhole instead of MOT are discussed in the literature. Casimir and van der Waals attraction Despite this, there is some doubt as to the physical origin of quantum reflection from solid surfaces. As was briefly mentioned above, the potential in the intermediate region between the regions dominated by the Casimir-Polder and Van der Waals interactions requires an explicit Quantum Electrodynamical calculation for the particular state and type of atom incident on the surface. Such a calculation is very difficult. Indeed, there is no reason to suppose that this potential is solely attractive within the intermediate region. Thus the reflection could simply be explained by a repulsive force, which would make the phenomenon not quite so surprising. Furthermore, a similar dependence for reflectivity on the incident velocity is observed in the case of the absorption of particles in vicinity of a surface. In the simplest case, such absorption could be described with a non-Hermitian potential (i.e. one where probability is not conserved). Until 2006, the published papers interpreted the reflection in terms of a Hermitian potential; this assumption allows to build a quantitative theory. Efficient quantum reflection Fig.1. Approximation r=frac{1}{(1+kw)^4}, compared to experimental data. A qualitative estimate for the efficiency of quantum reflection can be made using dimensional analysis. Letting m be mass of the atom and k=2pi/lambda the normal component of its wave-vector, then the energy of the normal motion of the particle, :E=frac{(hbar k)^2}{2m} should be compared to the potential, V(x) of interaction. The distance, x_{t} at which E=V(x) can be considered as the distance at which the atom will come across a troublesome discontinuity in the potential. This is the point at which the WKB method truly becomes nonsense. The condition for efficient quantum reflection can be written as kx_{t}<1. In other words, the wavelength is small compared to the distance at which the atom may become reflected from the surface. If this condition holds, the aforementioned effect of the discrete character of the surface may be neglected. This argument produces a simple estimate for the reflectivity, r, :r=frac{1}{(1+kx_{t})^4} which shows good agreement with experimental data for excited neon and helium atoms, reflected from a flat silicon surface (fig.1), see and references therein. Such a fit is also in good agreement with a single-dimensional analysis of the scattering of atoms from an attractive potential,. Such agreement indicates, that, at least in the case of noble gases and Si surface, the quantum reflection can be described with single-dimensional hermitian potential, as the result of attraction of atoms to the surface. Ridged mirror Fig.2. The ridges may enhance the quantum reflection The effect of quantum reflection can be enhanced using ridged mirrors . If one produces a surface consisting of a set of narrow ridges then the resulting non-uniformity of the material allows the reduction of the effective van der Waals constant; this extends the working ranges of the grazing angle. For this reduction to be valid, we must have small distances, L between the ridges. Where L becomes large, the non-uniformity is such that the ridged mirror must be interpreted in terms of multiple Fresnel diffraction or the Zeno effect; these interpretations give similar estimates for the reflectivity . See ridged mirror for the details. Similar enhancement of quantum reflection takes place where one has particles incident on an array of pillars . This was observed with very slow atoms (Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensate) at almost normal incidence. Application of quantum reflection Quantum reflection makes the idea of solid-state atomic mirrors and atomic-beam imaging systems (atomic nanoscope) possible. The use of quantum reflection in the production of atomic traps has also been suggested. Up to year 2007, no commercial application of quantum reflection was reported.

It is situated between Midhurst and Petworth, half a mile north of the A272 road. It lies within the South Downs National Park, just to the north of the valley of the River Rother and a tributary stream the River Lod runs close to the east end of the village.  Geography  In the 2001 census the parish covered 12.46 km¬≤ and had 282 households with a total population of 690. 298 residents were economically active. The population at the 2011 Census (including Selham) was 672. The parish is a long thin strip running north to south, from the slopes of Blackdown in the north to Gallows Hill on the border with Graffham south of the River Rother. It includes the hamlet of Lickfold, with a pub beside the River Lod and a triangular green where the road to the top of Bexley Hill meets the Lodsworth to Haslemere road. South of the village there are more houses, a pub and a small factory at Halfway Bridge on the A272. It has a small Church of England parish church, Saint Peter's, a pub, the Hollist Arms, and a village hall. After nearly 20 years without a grocery shop, a group of villagers launched in 2007 a community-run shop, the Lodsworth Larder, built with ecological material to provide local products to local people. The Manor House Lodsworth Manor HouseBuilt by the Bishop of London, who owned the manor during the Middle Ages, when first built the Manor House would have been the finest building in Lodsworth. The present house is likely to have been the home of the Bishop's steward, who would have administered the manor. Manorial courts would have been held there and there was a basement dungeon to hold prisoners. The Manor was held as a liberty by the Bishop, making it independent of the county justice system, so even the most serious crimes would have been tried there, and executions would have been carried out at Gallows Hill on the border with Graffham. Archaeological work during the autumn of 2002Chichester District Council, Heritage Annual Report 1998-2003 ISSN 1742-2663 p26. revealed the foundations of a 7-metre extension to the east of the building, with 1 metre foundations resting on solid rock which may have supported a tower. It is likely that there was a great hall to the south of the building. St. Peter's Well St Peter's Well in 2007 The spring near St Peter's church was a place of pilgrimage in the Middle Ages, especially for people with eye problems, and a source of revenue for the village. The well is located a few yards along a footpath that joins the lower junction of Church Lane and Vicarage Lane. History The name Lodsworth is Anglo-Saxon meaning Lod or Loda‚Äôs enclosure, but little is known for certain of the village until after the Norman conquest of England, when the area was given to Robert de Montgomerie, Earl of Shrewsbury. There is no certain reference to Lodsworth in the Domesday Book, although it may have been regarded as part of Grittenham, now part of Tillington but then a much larger settlement. Lodsworth was part of the hundred of Easebourne, a Saxon administrative area. In 1119 Richard de Belmas, the Bishop of London, was given the manor by the Montgomerie family; and Lodsworth was made a Liberty by Royal Charter of King Henry I. This unusual status made the manor independent from the county and hundred legal system so that even the most serious crimes were tried at the manorial court held at the manor house. The manor was run by the Bishop of London‚Äôs representative the Sheriff who lived at the manor house. Villagers were exempt from tolls at markets and fairs in other parishes, and all income from the manor went straight to the bishop. The manor must have been a valuable source of income to the bishop with revenue from pilgrims to St. Peter‚Äôs well and probably from stone quarrying, and the status of Liberty was vigorously defended and was reaffirmed by several kings, the last being Henry VI. Transport and industry Agriculture and Forestry use most of the land area. There is arable cropping, dairying and other grazing livestock. There are large areas of chestnut coppice on Bexley Hill, cut in rotation to produce fence materials, and areas of oak and conifers.

This was used mainly to bring chalk and coal in and to export timber. The railway line from Pulborough to Petworth was extended to Midhurst in the 1860s with stations at Selham and Midhurst.

A barrister's chambers or barristers' chambers are the rooms used by a barrister or a group of barristers. A judge's chambers, on the other hand, is the office of a judge, where the judge may hear certain types of cases, instead of in open court.  Judge's chambers  A judge's chambers is the office of a judge, where certain types of matters can be heard \\"in chambers\\", also known as in camera, rather than in open court. Generally, cases heard in chambers are cases, or parts of cases, in which the public and press are not allowed to observe the procedure.. Judge's chambers are often located on upper floors of the court house, away from the courtrooms, sometimes in groupings of judge's chambers. In some jurisdictions, a courtroom, rather than the judge's actual chambers, are used to hear matters \\"in chambers\\". Such courtrooms may also be called \\"chambers\\".  Barristers' chambers  In England and Wales, New Zealand, Australia, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Hong Kong, chambers may refer to the office premises used by a barrister or to a group of barristers, especially in the Inns of Court. To share costs and expenses, barristers typically operate fraternally with each other, as unincorporated associations known as \\"chambers\\". The term \\"Chambers\\" is used to refer both to the physical premises where the Barrister's Set conduct most of their work from, as well as the 'set' or unincorporated association itself. Chambers typically have office spaces for the barristers to work from, conference rooms with infrastructure to conduct video conferencing for a large audience, printing and photocopying sections, a substantially large and updated library, as well as rooms for the Barristers' and clients' dining and entertainment. Most Chambers have a staff to look after administrative matters, including a full-fledged kitchen and dining hall to serve up meals and refreshments. The transactional side of chambers are administered by barristers' clerks who receive cases from solicitors and agree on matters such as fees on behalf of their employers; they then provide case details to the barristers and conduct office management for them. Some chambers specialise in particular areas of law. Members are known as tenants, and can only be dismissed for gross misconduct. There are chambers all over England and Wales; however, the largest concentration of them is in London. A report by the General Council of the Bar in 2006, showed that of the 355 practising chambers in the United Kingdom, 210 were based in London. In Hong Kong, the 133 chambers within the special administrative region are almost exclusively located in the City of Victoria. In Sri Lanka, Counsels would maintain their chambers at their residence, which serve as their office and contain their personal library.

It is nearly extinct. It was spoken mostly by Namibians who did not learn standard German during the period of German rule. It was never a first language. It is currently spoken as a second language by people over 50 years old, who today usually also speak German, Afrikaans, or English.  History  Colonial acquisition of German in Namibia often took place outside of formal education and was primarily self-taught. Like many pidgin languages, Namibian Black German developed through limited access to the standard language and was restricted to the work environment. Currently several hundred thousand Namibians speak German as a second language, and while Namibian German often does not adhere to standard German, it is not pidgin. Prepositions English and Afrikaans have left an influence on the development of NBG, leading to three primary prepositional patterns: *adding a preposition where Standard German would use the accusative *dropping prepositions which are usually present in Standard German *changing the preposition that is required by the verb Examples Examples of phrases with Standard German equivalents: * Lange nicht sehen - long no see (\\"Lange nicht gesehen\\") * Was Banane kosten? - How much does the banana cost?

He was born in Amagasaki City, Hy≈çgo Prefecture. He received eighth place in his entrance exam to the illustrious Nada High School, and continued on to the Osaka University of Arts, where he graduated from the school of broadcasting. He then worked for a publishing company for five years, where he became famous for his catchy advertisements and commercials. He was given his own advice column in Asahi Shimbun, called the \\"Lighthearted Worry Column\\", which highlighted his strange and unique sense of humor and made him a household name. He began to work as a freelance copywriter in 1987, and in his free time, wrote the novels that would give him his cult following in Japan, as well as a variety of rakugo, essays, scripts and short stories. His best-known work includes the novels Tonight, from Every Bar in Town (13th Eiji Yoshikawa New Author Prize), The Pigs of Gadara (Mystery Writers of Japan Award), and The Night of Human Models (Naoki Prize). After his success in novels, he then expanded into theater, producing Laugh-to-Death Lilliput Army, as well as creating his own rock band, PISS, of which he was the lead singer and guitar player. After the band dissolved, he then formed Ramo and the Mother's Boys, where he played rhythm guitar and sang. Nakajima was known for his wild lifestyle and his constant use of drugs and alcohol. His appearances on television in the late 1990s and early 2000s were always an audience draw because of his slurred speech‚Äîprobably from years of alcohol and drug abuse)‚Äîand humorous personality. He was arrested and convicted of marijuana possession in 2003; he was sentenced to five years incarceration. He was put into a mental hospital for a brief period, and then served his 10-month sentence, with a suspended sentence of five years.

Biography He was born near Pemberton, New Jersey. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in 1828, began to practice medicine, and in 1830, in Imlaystown, New Jersey, married Anna Marie Bodine, they had four children. Fort's public career began when he was elected to the 1844 New Jersey Constitutional Convention as a Democrat from Monmouth County. At the convention, Fort supported universal suffrage, open eligibility for office, and popular election of all state and county officials. Later that year, he was elected to the New Jersey General Assembly, and, upon finishing a term, was elected to the New Jersey Senate, serving from 1846 through 1848. In 1850, he captured his party's nomination for Governor, and defeated the Whig candidate, John Runk (who had previously been a Congressman in the Twenty-ninth United States Congress). At that time, the Whigs were somewhat splintered, as some were adamantly opposed to the Fugitive Slave Law, while others were more aligned to the Democratic position that supporting the law was necessary in order to support the Union. Whigs also attacked Fort, with some justification, as being aligned too closely with the powerful railroad interests in the state. Nevertheless, the Whigs were not united, and Fort won the election fairly soundly. During his gubernatorial term, major reform legislation passed, including the ten-hour work day, and child protection. At the end of his term, his Democratic successor, Rodman M. Price, appointed him as a judge. From 1863 to 1868 he served on the Court of Errors and Appeals. After that term, he resumed the practice of medicine. He lived close to the railroad office in New Egypt. He died on April 22, 1872, at his home in the New Egypt section of Plumsted Township. He was buried in the United Methodist Church Cemetery in Pemberton. Legacy His nephew, John Franklin Fort was a Republican Governor of New Jersey, who served from 1908 to 1911.

The ITV Play name continued on the ITV Network until December 2007/2008. It was launched as a standalone channel on Freeview (taking on the slot which was previously occupied by the Men & Motors channel) on 19 April 2006 and started broadcasting on the Sky platform on 24 July 2006. The ITV Play channel was created in response to and hoping to cash in on the popularity of late night quiz shows on the ITV Network and ITV2 such as Quizmania and The Mint. ITV Play also offered additional gambling services on their website. It cost at least 75p per call to participate. This charge was made even if the caller was not put through to the studio. A free entry route was available through the website. Users were restricted to 150 calls/web entries in a 24-hour period. At peak times callers had a 1 in 8500 chance of getting through to the studio to play. Criticisms The 75p per call cost of a chance of involvement in shows, higher from mobile phones. Callers were charged for each call they made, whether connected to the studio or not. ITV had promised to make its programmes with higher production values than quiz programmes on other quiz channels, but with little evidence of such. Many of the callers were kept on hold and unable to connect. Restrictions put on the number of attempts to call, 150 per day, mean that in a 24-hour period BT callers could still spend a maximum of ¬£112.50 per day. This changed in February 2007 to 100 calls per day, so the maximum was ¬£75 a day on BT. In January 2007, Ofcom found ITV guilty of breaching its broadcasting code for making answers to its quizzes too obscure. Viewers complained after two answers to the question \\"what items might be found in a woman's handbag?\\" were revealed to be \\"balaclava\\" and \\"rawlplugs\\". The 21 September 2006 quiz was found to be in breach of the rule that \\"competitions should be conducted fairly\\". Ofcom warned ITV Play that there must be no further incident. Ofcom subsequently confirmed this was the first formal breach of the code recorded against ITV Play. For its part, ITV Play described it as a \\"one-off\\" incident of poor judgement. The genre of interactive Quiz TV shows has also been heavily criticised by the Culture, Media and Sport Committee. They stated that call TV programmes \\"generally look and feel like gambling\\", have \\"a lack of fairness and transparency\\" and that they encourage people to call more times than they can afford. Had ITV Play been classed as a gambling channel, it would have been forced to give 20% of its profits to good causes. Labour MP Paul Farrelly went further in his criticism of channels in the participation Quiz TV genre, describing them as \\"tantamount to theft.\\" Suspension and closure On 5 March 2007, ITV announced that all premium rate phone competitions and quizzes, including the ITV Play channel, would be suspended while an audit took place. Programmes ended in the early hours of 6 March 2007. The audit was announced after a number of problems with premium rate services affecting ITV, BBC One and Channel 4, all of whom were to meet with the regulator ICSTIS. ITV appointed Deloitte as independent auditors. On 13 March 2007, ITV announced that the ITV Play channel would permanently cease transmission following the recent concerns over participation television. On 16 March 2007, the channel finally closed and was removed from the Sky EPG. On Freeview, the channel slot was replaced by ITV2+1. Shows All of the shows below were shown on the ITV Play channel.

The show started off at weekends on ITV, with shows airing on the ITV Play channel the rest of the week. The show had larger cash prizes than most other ITV Play shows, as a result calls were put through to the studio on a much less regular basis. In the later end of its run the show was broadcast seven nights a week on ITV Play and ITV. The series was produced by ITV Productions (Granada) in Manchester. Make Your Play was also the last ITV Play show to be broadcast before the brand was ditched by ITV. However it was announced that ITV Play would not be returning in 2008. =The Zone= The Zone was only on air for six programmes.

The show ended on 6 March 2007. The series was produced by ITV Productions (Granada) in Manchester. The show was generally a Make Your Play clone, with a different colour theme and lower cash prizes. =Glitterball= Glitterball was introduced as a replacement for The Mint. The show was broadcast by the same company that produced The Mint, and featured one of the show's main presenters. Unlike other ITV Play shows, the games were shown on a giant screen in the studio rather than by graphics on the viewers own screens. The show also had a double presenter format, usually male and female. The show also survived the Ofcom investigation into ITV Play, after a few nights break they returned to ITV and ITV Play at the same time, with some callers saying, ' It's good to have you back.' =Glitterball Extra= Glitterball Extra, much like The Mint Extra, was shown on the ITV Play channel earlier in the evening, prior to the main shows broadcast. Due to bad publicity from the Ofcom investigation, call volumes dropped, so the show was ditched after seven episodes.

He performed some of the first modern evolutionary studies, starting with a collection of Hawaiian land snails. Life Gulick was born in Waimea on Kauai Island, during the Kingdom of Hawaii. His father was missionary Peter Johnson Gulick (1796-1877) and mother was Fanny (Thomas) Gulick (1798-1883). In 1851, he started to collect and study Hawaiian land snails. He had been interested in snails (a field now known as Conchology) since his early teens, and developed independently the concept of their evolution. He discovered many species of snails were only found in very specific areas within the islands, and there was no overlap between these areas. In 1853, after reading Charles Darwin's The Voyage of the Beagle and Hugh Miller's The Footprints of the Creator, Gulick presented his paper, \\"The Distribution of Plants and Animals\\", to the Punahou School Debating Society. In 1855, he enrolled for one year at New York University and then Williams College in Massachusetts, and studied in their Lyceum of Natural History. In 1859, he was elected Lyceum President, and graduated with an A.B. degree. He then followed the family tradition of attending theological school, and enrolled in Union Theological Seminary in New York City from 1859 to 1861. While there, he read Darwin's On the Origin of Species. He then collected shells in Panama and Japan. On August 22, 1864, Gulick was ordained as a missionary in China, but also continued his study of snails. On September 3, 1864, he married Emily de la Cour. In 1872, he wrote \\"On the Variation of Species as Related to Their Geographical Distribution, Illustrated by the Achatinellinae\\", which was published in the journal Nature. In 1872, he traveled to England for two years. While there, he corresponded with Charles Darwin regarding his studies. He finally met Darwin and gave him a synopsis of an upcoming paper. That paper was \\"On Diversity of Evolution Under One Set of External Conditions\\", which was published in the Journal of the Linnean Society of London, Zoology in 1873. Gulick then returned to China, and remained there until 1875. After his first wife died in 1875, he moved to Japan to continue missionary work. As in China, he studied snails while performing as a missionary. On May 31, 1880, he married Frances Amelia Stevens (1848‚Äì1928). In 1888, he went again to London where his paper \\"Divergent Evolution Through Cumulative Segregation\\" was published in the Journal of the Linnean Society of London, Zoology. He met George Romanes who worked with Gulick to refine evolutionary biology. In 1889, he received an honorary A.M. and Ph.D from Adelbert College of Western Reserve University. In 1891, another paper, \\"Intensive Segregation, or Divergence Through Independent Transformation\\" was published in the Journal of the Linnean Society of London, Zoology. He moved to Oberlin, Ohio in 1899. He expanded his study to societal evolution in humans, coming to believe societal evolution could be attributed to altruistic motives and a spirit of cooperation between humanity. He put forth this thesis in his paper \\"Evolution, Racial and Habitudinal\\" in 1905 and received an honorary Ph.D. by Oberlin College. Later in 1905, he returned to Hawaii and sold his shell collection to Charles Montague Cooke Jr. the new curator of the Bernice P. Bishop Museum. He remained there until his death in Honolulu on April 14, 1923. He and his second wife are buried in the Mission Houses cemetery. They had two children, Addison and Louise (Gulick) Whitaker. Evolutionary theories In 1872, Gulick was the first to propose the theory that the majority of evolutionary changes are the result of chance variation, which has no effect on the survival and reproductive success of a species (today called \\"genetic drift\\"). He came to this theory while noting that there was a large diversity of local populations of Hawaiian land snails (Achatinella) which showed random variation under seemingly identical environmental conditions. Although he certainly promoted the importance of random factors in evolution, he also was a strong supporter of Darwinian natural selection, and this led to disagreement with Moritz Wagner's \\"Migration Theory\\" of the origin of species. In 1888, Gulick introduced new terms for two patterns of evolution that can be observed: the term monotypic evolution (previously called \\"transformation;\\" today \\"anagenesis\\") and the term \\"polytypic evolution\\" (previously called \\"diversification\\"; today \\"cladogenesis\\") ‚Äì simultaneous processes, such as the multiplication of species, manifested by different populations and incipient species. George Romanes later adopted this terminology during his evolutionary studies. Gulick later proposed general geographic models of speciation, and disputed Moritz Wagner's more extreme claims that geographic speciation was the only possible route to speciation.Gulick J.T. 1908. Isolation and selection in the evolution of species. The need of clear definitions. Amer. Nat. 42[493], 48-57. Romanes said of Gulick: > ...to his essays on the subject I attribute a higher value than to any other > work in the field of Darwinian thought since the date of Darwin's death. Criticism Gulick reported collecting 44,500 Hawaiian snails in just three years. Some were of no scientific value because he did not record where they were obtained. Of many of the species he collected, no similar species remain in the wild today. Some modern observers attribute the extinction of many endemic Hawaiian snail species to him and fellow collectors such as his schoolmate David Dwight Baldwin.

He was working as an employee for the Hudson's Bay Company.  Biography  Jacob Fahlstrom was known to the Indians, as \\"Yellowhead,\\" (because of his blond hair) and to the white settlers as the \\"Swede Indian.\\" He was, in fact, the first Swede in Minnesota, for which reason Prince Bertil of Sweden in June 1948, unveiled a plaque in his honor on Kellogg Blvd. in St. Paul. Fahlstrom was born in Stockholm in 1795 of a well-to-do family, but the boy had a wandering foot which took him down to the docks where he shipped as cabin boy on a vessel captained by his uncle. At 14 he experienced shipwreck on the English coast, after which he made his way to London where he joined up with Lord Selkirk's expedition to Hudson Bay. He became a fur trader, first for the Hudson's Bay Company and later for the American Fur Company. As he traveled from one Indian village to another in quest of pelts, he learned in addition to the English he had picked up, an Indian language and with it a handy working knowledge of Indian psychology. In his wanderings Jacob Fahlstrom drifted southward to Ft. Snelling where he took two jobs: supplying the fort with wood and carrying the mail north to the Lake Superior region, and from Prairie du Chien to St. Croix Falls. In 1823 he married Marguerite, daughter of Pierre Bonga of the Lake Superior Chippewas. In 1837 or 1838 the \\"Swede Indian\\" was converted at the Kaposia mission. Thereafter he became a sort of missionary to the Indians and also to the men of the lumber camps in the north woods. In 1841 Fahlstrom moved to what was to be Washington County where he took up a claim at Valley Creek near Afton. His home there was pretty well filled with nine children, but still the latch string was always for traveling purposes. It is said that he once owned where the business district of St. Paul stands today. Unfortunately he gave up this claim because he thought the place was too hilly. He had more use for the island he owned in White Bear Lake; it was covered with sugar maples, and his wife and children made sugar there every spring. Jacob Fahlstrom died in 1859, his wife surviving until 1880. Their graves are marked in a small grave yard on Fahlstrom Place road in Afton, Minnesota,personal visit to the sitehttp://projects.wchsmn.org/name_index/sources/99/ he has also been honored by having his portrait hung in the Swedish Art Institute of Minneapolis. It is not a work of art, however, but rather dark and forbidding with a half-circle fringe of whiskers, revealing nothing of the character of the man which was kindly, sincere and devoted. In Easton's HISTORY OF THE ST. CROIX VALLEY we catch this glimpse of him: \\"Jacob Fahlstrom was a sort of preacher, and he could pray pretty well, and could be depended on upon to do so, providing a good meal was in sight. Many a good meal he got at Carli's (Tamarack House at Stillwater) in return for his old-fashioned prayers.\\" The missionaries at Kaposia and Red Rock considered \\"Father Jacob\\" as he had now came to be called, such a valuable brand snatched from the burning that his conversion seemed like compensation for their unproductive labors among the Sioux. Elder Brunson is said to have stated that this event alone justified the existence of the Kaposia mission. Here was one who understood the red men far better than they, one who could be depended upon to carry the Gospel on all his adventurous journeys among the Indians and likewise the white settlements in what is now Washington County.

UNESCO was designated as the lead agency. The Year's activities spanned the three years 2006‚Äì2009.International Year of Planet Earth: FAQ Goals The Year aimed to raise $20 million from industry and governments, of which half was to be spent on co-funding research, and half on \\"outreach\\" activities. It was intended to be the biggest ever international effort to promote the Earth sciences. Apart from researchers, who were expected to benefit under the Year's Science Programme, the principal target groups for the Year's broader messages were: * Decision makers and politicians, to better inform them about the how Earth scientific knowledge can be used for sustainable development * The voting public, to communicate to them how Earth scientific knowledge can contribute to a better society * Geoscientists, to help them use their knowledge of various aspects of the Earth for the benefit of the world‚Äôs population. The research themes of the year, set out in ten science prospectuses, were chosen for their societal relevance, multidisciplinary nature, and outreach potential. The Year had twelve founding partners, 23 associate partners, and was backed politically by 97 countries representing 87% of the world‚Äôs population. The Year was promoted politically at UNESCO and at the United Nations in New York by the People‚Äôs Republic of Tanzania. The Year encouraged contributions from researchers within ten separate themes. The outreach programme worked in a similar way, receiving bids for support from individuals and organisations worldwide. The Year's Project Leader was former IUGS President Professor Eduardo F J de Mulder. The Year's Science Committee was chaired by Professor Edward Derbyshire (Royal Holloway) and its Outreach Committee by Dr Ted Nield (Geological Society of London). The International Year of Planet Earth project was initiated jointly by the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS) and the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). The UN press release reads: \\"By a draft on the International Year of Planet Earth, 2008, which the Committee approved without a vote on 11 November, the Assembly would declare 2008 the International Year of Planet Earth. It would also designate the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to organize activities to be undertaken during the Year, in collaboration with UNEP and other relevant United Nations bodies, the International Union of Geological Sciences and other Earth sciences societies and groups throughout the world. Also by that draft, the Assembly would encourage Member States, the United Nations system and other actors to use the Year to increase awareness of the importance of Earth sciences in achieving sustainable development and promoting local, national, regional and international action.\\"  Background  The project was backed by the following founding partners: *International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) *International Geographical Union *International Union of Soil Sciences (IUSS) *International Lithosphere Programme (ILP) *National Geological Survey of the Netherlands (NITG-TNO) *Geological Society of London *International Soil Reference and Information Centre (ISRIC) *A consortium of the International Association for Engineering Geology and the Environment (IAEG) *International Society for Rock Mechanics (ISRM) *International Society of Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering (ISSMGE) *International Union for Quaternary Research (INQUA) *American Geological Institute (AGI) *American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) *American Institute of Professional Geologists (AIPG) The Year was also supported by 23 Associate Partners, including all major international geoscientific and other relevant organisations: *International Council for Science (ICSU) *Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO (IOC) *International Permafrost Association (IPA) *International Association on the Genesis of Ore Deposits (IAGOD) *Society of Economic Geologists (SEG) *Society for Geology Applied to Mineral Deposits (SGA) *International Association of Hydrogeologists (IAH) *International Geoscience Programme (IGCP) *European Federation of Geoscientists (EFG) *African Association of Remote Sensing of the Environment (AARSE) *Science Council of Asia (SCA) *European Association for the Conservation of the Geological Heritage (ProGEO) *Society for Sedimentary Geology (SEPM) *Coordinating Committee for Geoscience Programmes in East and Southeast Asia (CCOP) *Geological Society of Africa (GSAf) *United Nations University (UNU) *Association of Geoscientists for International Development (AGID) *United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UN/ISDR) *North-eastern Science Foundation (USA) (NESF) *Association of American State Geologists (AASG) *International Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) *Geological Society of America (GSA) *North American Committee for Stratigraphic Nomenclature (NACSN)  Objectives  The Year's stated objective was to: > Reduce risks for society caused by natural and human-induced hazards, reduce > health problems by improving understanding of the medical aspects of Earth > science, discover new natural resources and make them available in a > sustainable manner, build safer structures and expand urban areas, utilizing > natural subsurface conditions, determine the non-human factor in climatic > change, enhance understanding of the occurrence of natural resources so as > to contribute to efforts to reduce political tension, detect deep and poorly > accessible groundwater resources, improve understanding of the evolution of > life, increase interest in the Earth sciences in society at large, encourage > more young people to study Earth science in university.  Themes  Research themes for the Year included: *Groundwater: reservoir for a thirsty planet? *Hazards: minimizing risk, maximizing awareness *Earth and Health: building a safer environment *Climate change: the ‚Äòstone tape‚Äô *Resource Issues: towards sustainable use *Megacities: going deeper, building safer *Deep Earth: from crust to core *Ocean: abyss of time *Soil: Earth‚Äôs living skin *Earth and Life: origins of diversity  Output and Legacy  As part of the IYPE legacy, 80 National and Regional IYPE Committees were set up to bring together key figures from various organisations into a single campaign dedicated to raising awareness of the Earth sciences among decision makers and the public. The Young Earth-Science Initiative (YES) was also created, providing a platform for young professionals in the Earth sciences. Initiated by two Italian geoscientists, David Govoni and Luca Micucci, it started in 2007 and grew rapidly at the Global Launch Event of the IYPE in Paris in 2008, during which many young geoscientists were invited to participate. From there, the YES Initiative expanded, eventually adopting a formal structure, a network of supporting organisations (including IYPE) and an invitation by the Chinese government to host the first International YES Conference in October 2009 in Beijing. An international collaborative project known as OneGeology was launched, aiming to bring together geological data from all nations into a digital database and thus transform them into a single computer language, providing free access to the online digital geological world map in the scale of 1:1 million. That initiative, spearheaded by Ian Jackson of the British Geological Survey, came under the IYPE banner in 2007.

Prior to his trip over the falls he owned a restaurant on Bridge Street and would boast to customers that anything Annie could do, he could do better. Leach returned to Niagara Falls, New York, in 1920 and operated a pool hall. While in his sixties he attempted to swim the whirlpool rapids but failed after several attempts. During these aborted attempts, Bobby Leach was rescued by William \\"Red\\" Hill Sr., a riverman, who knew the Falls well and became well known in the area for later rescues. In 1926, while on a publicity tour in New Zealand, Leach injured his leg when he slipped on an orange peel. The leg became infected, and eventually gangrene necessitated the amputation of the leg.

The name derives from Old English relating to a hawthorn tree on a farm (or settlement) and Steward. The village was formerly owned by Wymar, who was the steward of the Earls of Richmond. The village is very similar to the others that dot Wensleydale, but Thornton Steward has a reservoir owned by Yorkshire Water. The village includes the ancient St Oswald's Church, which is reputedly the oldest church in Wensleydale with some parts being dated back to the year 680. The church was subject to Channel 4's show Time Team, where they found remains of a communion of monks. The village was also featured in the British television series All Creatures Great and Small, in the episode \\"If Wishes Were Horses\\". The hill, East Witton fell, is visible from Thornton Steward and on the western side Jervaulx Abbey is visible. The school house was founded in 1815 by George Horn, with a budget of '¬£10 per annum', but was closed during the 20th century.

This is corroborated by archaeological findings and the innumerable Latin names. The name Corti√ßada was abandoned in C.XVI in favour of Proen√ßa. Corti√ßada perhaps related to the abundant production of cork oak (corti√ßa) or the number of tenement houses (colmeias) that had been of great importance in the region. \\"The town of Proen√ßa, situated nine leagues (35km) north of Crato, Portugal Crato , and seven (23km) west of Castelo Branco, was chartered by King Afonzo III of Portugal (1248-1279).

The origin of name Proen√ßa-a-Nova (New Province) is unclear. The philological scholar Leite de Vasconcelos (Lusitana Magazine 1889, Portuguese Archaeologist 1895, and Museum Etnol√≥gico de Bel√©m 1893, Religions of Lusit√¢nia (1897‚Äì1913) ) thought that it related to Provence in France and that the inhabitants of Old Provence migrated to Lusit√¢nia. However, this theory has to compete with both the theoretical possibility that the Lusitani may have migrated from the Swiss mountains in the 6th century BCE, long before Julius Caesar conquered and named Provence/Provincia, and another theoretical possibility that they may be autochthonous to the Iberian region. The population was primitive until being given to the Monks of the Order of the Hospitallers, who collaborated with the first Kings to stabilise and defend the new lands. In 1244, the Prior of the Hospitallers, Frei Rodrigo Eg√≠dio, gave Proenca its first charter, a document of great importance establishing the general duties for its inhabitants and a guarantee of defense of rights. In 1512 the first Proen√ßa charter was updated under the rule of King Manuel I of Portugal.

Its southern terminus is at PA 100 in Pottstown and its northern terminus is at PA 309 and PA 313 in Quakertown, where it continues eastward as PA 313. Along the way, PA 663 also passes through the borough of Pennsburg. It is called John Fries Highway between Pennsburg and Quakertown. It has an interchange with Interstate 476 (I-476, the Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike) at exit 44 west of Quakertown. The route was assigned in 1930, and it has had several realignments since its commissioning, including two major ones. Route description PA 663 northbound just north of Pottstown PA 663 begins at an intersection with PA 100 in the borough of Pottstown in Montgomery County, heading east on four-lane undivided West King Street. The road passes through commercial areas and crosses the Colebrookdale Railroad at-grade and Manatawny Creek. The route becomes two-lane undivided King Street and is lined with residences. PA 663 turns north onto North Charlotte Street and continues past homes, curving to the northeast. The road crosses Mervine Street and becomes the border between Upper Pottsgrove Township to the northwest and Lower Pottsgrove Township to the southeast, running through a mix of residential and commercial areas. The route turns east to fully enter Lower Pottsgrove Township before it curves back to the northeast, again following the border between Upper Pottsgrove Township and Lower Pottsgrove Township past the Keim Street intersection. PA 663 continues through wooded areas with a few homes and enters New Hanover Township. The road runs through more rural areas with some development and comes to the Swamp Pike intersection. Farther northeast, PA 663 intersects PA 73 and turns east to form a concurrency with that route on Big Road. The road crosses Swamp Creek before PA 663 splits from PA 73 by heading northeast on Layfield Road. The route runs through farmland and woodland with some development. Farther northeast, the road heads into Upper Hanover Township and crosses the Green Lane Reservoir along the Perkiomen Creek. PA 663 heads into the borough of Pennsburg, where it becomes Pottstown Avenue and runs past homes and a few businesses, passing east of the terminus of an East Penn Railroad line. In the center of town, the route intersects PA 29. Past this intersection, the road becomes Quakertown Avenue and passes more development before leaving Pennsburg for Upper Hanover Township again. At this point, the route becomes John Fries Highway and heads through farm fields and woods. PA 663 northbound in New Hanover Township Past the Geryville Pike intersection, PA 663 enters Milford Township in Bucks County and continues through more rural areas. The road passes to the southeast of Spinnerstown and widens into a four-lane divided highway at the Spinnerstown Road/Krammes Road intersection, where it curves to the east. The route becomes undivided and comes to an interchange with I-476 (Pennsylvania Turnpike Northeast Extension). A park and ride lot is located south of the road at this interchange. PA 663 becomes a divided highway again and passes businesses. The route becomes a two-lane undivided road again and continues back into rural areas, where it crosses Allentown Road and Unami Creek. The road passes to the north of Milford Square and runs near some development, heading south of St. Luke's Hospital-Upper Bucks Campus. The route enters Richland Township at the Portzer Road intersection and passes homes, becoming the border between Richland Township to the north and the borough of Quakertown to the south at the Milford Square Pike intersection, with the name becoming West Broad Street. PA 663 heads into commercial areas and fully enters Quakertown, where it widens back into a four-lane divided highway and comes to its northern terminus at an intersection with PA 309. Past this intersection, the road continues east as PA 313.  History  PA 663 was once part of the Steinsburg and Milford Square Turnpike. The turnpike was chartered in March 1858. When Pennsylvania legislated routes in 1911, what is now PA 663 was not given a number. PA 663 was designated in 1930 to run from in US 422 (High Street) in Pottstown north to PA 73 in New Hanover Township. At this time, the entire length of the route was paved, along with the unnumbered road between PA 73 and Quakertown. In 1936, PA 663 was extended north to an intersection with US 309 (now PA 309) and PA 212 (now PA 313) in Quakertown. The route followed its current alignment between PA 73 and Pennsburg before it followed Quakertown Road and Sleepy Hollow Road to Spinnerstown, where it turned east and followed Spinnerstown Road and Milford Square Pike to Quakertown. By 1967, the southern terminus of PA 663 was rerouted to PA 100 in Pottstown, heading west on King Street. In the 1960s, PA 663 was shifted from Milford Square Pike to a new alignment to the north between the Northeast Extension and Quakertown. After construction began in 1973, a new alignment of PA 663 to the south from Pennsburg to the Northeast Extension opened a year later, with the route moved off Quakertown Road, Sleepy Hollow Road, and Spinnerstown Road.

It has developed over the last century and a half and has affected many other Christian churches, including the Church of England and other churches of the Anglican Communion, and some Protestant churches. A similar reform in the Church of England and Anglican Communion, known as the Oxford Movement, began to change theology and liturgy in the United Kingdom and United States in the mid-nineteenth century. The Liturgical Movement has been one of the major influences on the process of the Ecumenical Movement, in favor of reversing the divisions which began at the Reformation. The movement has a number of facets. First, it was an attempt to rediscover the worship practices of the ancient and to some extent the Medieval Church, which in the 19th century was held to be the ideal form of worship and expression of faith. Second, it developed as scholarship to study and analyze the history of worship. Third, it broadened into an examination of the nature of worship as an organic human activity. Fourth, it attempted to renew worship in order that it could be more expressive for worshippers and as an instrument of teaching and mission. Fifth, it has been a movement attempting to bring about reconciliation among the churches on both sides of the Protestant Reformation. At the Reformation of the sixteenth century, while some of the new Protestant churches abandoned the old Latin Mass, the Roman Catholic Church, under the direction of Pope Pius V, formally codified and united the Roman Rite. The split between Roman Catholic and Protestant churches was in part a difference about beliefs regarding the language to be used in the liturgy. A Mass in Latin, some argued, would be something one would primarily see and hear as a sacred event; a vernacular service, one in the language of the worshipper, would be one which the worshipper was supposed to understand and take part in. The revision of the Roman liturgy which followed, and which provided a single use for the whole Western Church, emphasized the sacramental and sacrificial nature of the Eucharist, rather than a direction urged by reformers toward lay participation. The Liturgical Movement, which originated in the work to restore the liturgy to its ancient principles, resulted in changes that have affected both Roman Catholics and Protestants of various denominations. Catholic origins The Roman Catholic Church responded to the breaking away of European Protestants by engaging in its own reform, the so-called Counter Reformation. Following the Council of Trent, (1545‚Äì1563), which adopted the Tridentine Mass as the standard for Roman Catholic worship, the Latin Mass remained substantially unchanged for four hundred years. Meanwhile, the churches of the Reformation (Anglican, Lutheran, Calvinist, and others) altered their liturgies more or less radically: specifically, the vernacular language of the people was used in the worship service. Deliberately distancing themselves from \\"Roman\\" practices, these churches became \\"Churches of the Word\\" ‚Äì of Scripture and preaching ‚Äì breaking away from the Roman Catholic Church's focus on sacraments. The ritual of remembrance of the Last Supper and Christ's Crucifixion on Calvary became more infrequent and was supplemented in many churches by the services of Morning and Evening Prayer. In some Lutheran traditions, the Mass was stripped of some of its character, such as replacing the Canon of the Mass with the Words of Institution (\\"This is my Body... this is my Blood\\"). Common practice was to make the service of the day (the ante-communion) into a preaching service. The first stirrings of interest in liturgical scholarship (and thence liturgical change) within the Roman Catholic Church arose in 1832, when the French Benedictine abbey at Solesmes was refounded under Dom Prosper Gu√©ranger. For a long time, Benedictines were the pioneers in restoring Roman liturgy to its early medieval form. At first Gu√©ranger and his contemporaries focused on studying and recovering authentic Gregorian Chant and the liturgical forms of the Middle Ages, which were held to be the ideals. Other scholars, such as Fernand Cabrol and Pierre Batiffol, also contributed to the investigation of the origins and history of the liturgy, but practical application of this learning was lacking. During the 19th century patristic texts were increasingly available and new ones were discovered and published. Jacques Paul Migne published editions of various early theological texts in two massive compilations: Patrologia Latina and Patrologia Graeca. In addition, the Didache, one of the earliest manuals of Christian morals and practice, was found in 1875 in a library in Constantinople. The Apostolic Tradition, often attributed in the 20th century to the 3rd-century Roman theologian Hippolytus, was published in 1900. This latter was a Church Orders containing the full text of a Eucharistic liturgy; it was to prove highly influential. Pope Pius X, elected in 1903, encouraged such reforms. In the same year he issued a motu proprio on church music, inviting the faithful to participate actively in the liturgy, which he saw as a source for the renewal of Christian spirituality. He called for more frequent communion of the faithful, the young in particular. Subsequently, he was concerned with the revision of the Breviary. Pius' engagement would prove to be the necessary spark. =Development= The movement had a number of elements: Liturgical Scholarship, Pastoral Theology, and Liturgical Renewal. As to the first of these, in his influential book Mysterium Fidei (1921), Maurice de la Taille argued that Christ's sacrifice, beginning from his self-offering at the Last Supper, completed in the Passion and continued in the Mass, were all one act. There was only one immolation ‚Äì that of Christ at Calvary, to which the Supper looks forward and on which the Mass looks back. Although Taille was not a liturgist, his work generated a huge controversy which raised interest in the form and character of the Mass. His argument, whilst not yet accepted by Protestants, removed the objection that each mass was a separate and new 'immolation' of Christ, a repeated and thus efficacious act. Pastoral considerations played a major part. Such motives lay behind the tone of the papacy of Pius X. In 1909 he called a conference, the Congr√®s National des Oeuvres Catholiques in Mechelen in Belgium, which is held to have inaugurated the Liturgical Movement proper in the Catholic Church. Liturgy was to be the means of instructing the people in Christian faith and life; the mass would be translated into the vernacular to promote active participation of the faithful. One of the leading participants in the conference, Dom Lambert Beauduin of Louvain, argued that worship was the common action of the people of God and not solely performed by the priest. Many of the movement's principles were based in Beauduin's book, La Piet√© de l'Eglise. At almost the same time, in Germany Abbot Ildefons Herwegen of Maria Laach convened a liturgical conference in Holy Week 1914 for lay people. Herwegen thereafter promoted research which resulted in a series of publications for clergy and lay people during and after World War I. One of the foremost German scholars was Odo Casel. Having begun by studying the Middle Ages, Casel looked at the origins of Christian liturgy in pagan cultic acts, understanding liturgy as a profound universal human act as well as a religious one. In his Ecclesia Orans (The Praying Church) (1918), Casel studied and interpreted the pagan mysteries of ancient Greece and Rome, discussing similarities and differences between them and the Christian mysteries. His conclusions were studied in various places, notably at Klosterneuburg in Austria, where the Augustinian canon Pius Parsch applied the principles in his church of St. Gertrude, which he took over in 1919. With laymen he worked out the relevance of the Bible to liturgy. Similar experiments were to take place in Leipzig during the Second World War.Ernest Benjamin Koenker, The Liturgical Renaissance in the Roman Catholic Church (1954), p. 10 In France, the Dictionnaire d'arch√©ologie chr√©tienne et de liturgie, was published, but most practical experiments in liturgy were initiated after contact with the German and Austrian movements. Most changes occurred after the Second World War. In 1943 the Centre National de Pastorale Liturgique was founded and the magazine La Maison-Dieu began publication. The idea of liturgy as an inclusive activity, subversive of individualism, while exciting to some, also raised anxieties in Rome. In 1947 Pope Pius XII issued the encyclical Mediator Dei which warned of false innovations, radical changes and Protestant influences in the liturgical movement. At the same time he encouraged the \\"authentic\\" liturgical movement, which promoted active participation of the congregation in chant and gestures. =Second Vatican Council= The Latin Tridentine Mass remained the standard eucharistic liturgy in the Roman Catholic Church in the West until the Second Vatican Council. Josef Andreas Jungmann had considerable influence on the Council through his Mass of the Roman Rite: Its Origins and Development and his presence as a peritus, as well as on the Commission that would implement the liturgical changes. In 1963, the Council adopted, by an overwhelming majority, the Constitution On Sacred Liturgy, \\"Sacrosanctum Concilium\\". For the first time the vernacular liturgy was permitted, even if to a minor extent in relation to those practiced afterward by national churches. The influence of Hippolytus was evident in the form of Eucharistic Prayers. Accompanying this was the encouragement for liturgies to express local culture (subject to approval by the Holy See). The close connection between more intelligible participation in the Eucharistic celebration and carrying one's faith \\"into the marketplace\\", exhibiting commitment to social justice in one's life, has been observed. The recovery of the Liturgy of the Hours (also called the Divine Office or [Roman] Breviary), the daily prayer of the Church, was just as startling. As liturgical prayer is the prayer of the Church, the Constitution states that \\"in choir\\" (common) office prayer is always preferable to individual recitation. Anglican Communion At the time of the English Reformation, the liturgy was revised and replaced with the Book of Common Prayer (first issued in 1549). The changes were relatively conservative and did not substantially shift after the sixteenth century. The 1552 edition of the prayer book showed more Protestant influence; after the Book of Common Prayer of 1662, no official revision was attempted until the 1920s. In Victorian England, interest in medieval liturgy had grown through the work of the Oxford Movement, which drew attention to the church's history and relation to the Roman Catholic Church. The Cambridge Camden Society (1839‚Äì63), originally formed for the study of ecclesiastical art, generated an interest in liturgy that led to the ceremonial revival of the later nineteenth century, with an adoption of medieval practices. The revival brought Anglican scholars into conversation with their Roman colleagues. The Oxford Movement was also influential in the United States, where the Episcopal Church adopted many ritual changes. Many new churches were built in medieval styles through the early decades of the 20th century. By the 20th century, the Church of England had made quite radical ceremonial and ritual changes, most of them incorporating revival of medieval Christian practice.Contemporary commentators, such as Benjamin Jowett, saw the changes as indicative of Romantic and aesthetic influences (and 'revolting to the reverent mind'), but the models were Roman Catholic. Judith Pinnington, \\"Rubric and Spirit: a diagnostic reading of Tractarian Worship\\", in Essays Catholic and Radical, ed. Kenneth Leech and Rowan Williams (Bowerdean 1983) p. 98f; see also Valerie Pitt: \\"The Oxford Movement: a case of Cultural Distortion?\\", in Essays Catholic and Radical,, p. 205ff. Tractarians, followers of the Oxford Movement who published religious tracts, were initially concerned with the relationship of the Church of England to the universal Church. They became interested in liturgy and, in particular, the practice of Communion. Gradually, dress and ceremonial were altered with adoption of traditional Roman aspects from the Middle Ages, e.g. stoles, chasubles, copes and birettas; the use of candles multiplied, incense was burnt; priests learned to genuflect and bow. Gradually, the Eucharist became more common as the main Sunday Service instead of Morning Prayer, often enhanced by using prayers translated from the Missal. The English Missal, published first in 1912, was a conflation of the Eucharistic rite in the 1662 Book of Common Prayer and the Latin prayers of the Roman Missal, including the rubrics indicating the posture and manual acts. It was a recognition of practices which had been widespread for many years. The changes were the subject of controversy, opposition, hostility and legal action.Chadwick, Owen The Victorian Church; vol. 2; Carpenter, S. C. Church and People (SPCK 1933); pp.212ff. Some viewed such liturgical change not as reform, but a retreat to mediaeval models; many bishops and clergy perceived such change as 'popish'.see footnote 2 The attempt to revise the Book of Common Prayer in 1927 and 1928 was rooted in the past, owing little to the researches or practices of continental scholars.Gray, Donald, Earth and Altar, (Canterbury Press 1986); p. 196 With the publication in 1935 of Gabriel Hebert's Liturgy and Society, the debate in England began about the relationship between worship and the world. Hebert, a Kelham Father, interpreted the liturgy on wider social principles, rejecting, in the process, the idea of the eucharistic fast as being impractical. Its members wished for more frequent communion, not merely attendance at Mass; they wanted to relate the eucharist to the world of ordinary life. Through its influence, the offertory was restored, though not without protracted controversy.Buchanan, Colin. The End of the Offertory (Grove Books)Arguile, Roger. The Offering of the People (Jubilee, 1989) The ideas of the Parish Communion movement, as it came to be called, were in advance of English Roman Catholic scholars. The liturgy remained officially unaltered until the 1960s, when the synodical process began which was to produce the Alternative Service Book in 1980 and Common Worship in 2000. Churches of the Lutheran tradition Equally dramatic in some places has been the change in some of the Lutheran churches. The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, for example, has been strongly influenced by the movement in its vesture and ritual. Black gowns have long been replaced by traditional Catholic vestments. The St. Thomas Mass returned the fuller use of ceremonial (the liturgical action, in which movement takes place during the liturgy to express its different parts). The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the largest Lutheran body in the United States, has also revived a greater appreciation of the liturgy and its ancient origins. Its clergy and congregations have adopted many traditional liturgical symbols, such as the sign of the cross, incense, and the full chasuble, which have become more common than in years past. While some freedom in style is exercised by individual congregations, the overall style of the aspects of liturgical worship ‚Äì including vestments, altar adornments, and a general return of many formal practices ‚Äì has become closer to the styles of the Roman Catholic and Anglican traditions. The Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod has led in the recovery of Lutheran liturgical practice. Such practices as chanting the psalms and other parts of the service, and the imposition of ashes on Ash Wednesday, are now relatively common. In the United States, numerous inter- church organizations identifying as Lutheran bodies were formed, due mostly to the waves of immigration in the late 19th century and early 20th from nations of northern European and Scandinavia. Because of the differences in languages and customs, congregations developed along 'national' lines, establishing their own versions of the 'church back home' ‚Äì for example, the Norwegian Lutherans, Danish Lutherans, etc. These early churches used the vernacular language of their native country. As settlers and their descendants adopted the use of English and assimilated as Americans, the need for foreign-language worship and identification with national churches was reduced. In the state churches of the Saxon Electorate and the Thuringian principalities, the excising of the Eucharistic Prayer by Martin Luther was reversed in the decade after the Second World War. New service books were published. Influence and criticisms Horton M. Davies, a professor at Princeton University, states that \\"What is fascinating about (the liturgical) movement is that it has enabled Protestant churches to recover in part the Catholic liturgical heritage, while the Catholics seem to have appropriated the Protestant valuation of preaching, of shared worship in the vernacular tongue, and the importance of laity as the people of God.\\" The influence of the Roman shape of the liturgy has been considerable among most liturgical churches of the west, including the whole of the Anglican communion, and the Methodist Church in England, and less formally liturgical churches such as the United Methodist Church of the United States. On the other hand, critics have lamented, mostly from within the Roman Catholic Church, the loss of mystery and the reduction in the sacrificial element of the Mass (see Mass of Paul VI).

According to this view, justice demands that variations in how well-off people are should be wholly determined by the responsible choices people make and not by differences in their unchosen circumstances. This expresses the intuition that it is a bad thing for some people to be worse off than others through no fault of their own. Theory = Origins = Theories of luck egalitarianism were foreshadowed by 20th century philosopher John Rawls‚Äô theory of distributive justice in which he observed that a person‚Äôs skills and abilities led to differential distributive justice outcomes. Rawls argued that this is unfair because one‚Äôs natural talents or circumstances are morally arbitrary as they have been determined by a ‚Äúnatural lottery‚Äù rather than one‚Äôs own choices. This concern influenced later egalitarians theories of justice, of which, Ronald Dworkin‚Äôs theory of equality of resources is considered to be the first with clearly luck egalitarian features, although he rejected the label himself. Following Dworkin, Richard Arneson‚Äôs equality of opportunity for welfare theory and Gerald Cohen‚Äôs equal access to advantage theory were two of the most prominent early luck egalitarian theories. = Basic principles = Luck egalitarians therefore distinguish between outcomes that are the result of brute luck (e.g. misfortunes in genetic makeup, or being struck by a bolt of lightning) and those that are the consequence of conscious options (such as career choice or fair gambles). Luck egalitarianism is intended as a fundamental normative idea that might guide our thinking about justice rather than as an immediate policy prescription. The idea has its origin in John Rawls' thought that distributive shares should not be influenced by arbitrary factors. Luck egalitarians disagree among themselves about the proper way to measure how well off people are (for instance, whether we should measure material wealth, psychological happiness or some other factor) and the related issue of how to assess the value of their resources. Many philosophers think that the term \\"luck egalitarianism\\" is a misnomer, because many so-called \\"luck egalitarians\\" (of the 'resourcist' strand at least) do not in fact want to equalize luck or eliminate uncertainty, but instead believe that individuals should be equal in the amount of resources they have when facing luck or uncertainty. Criticism The position is controversial within some currents of egalitarian thought, and the philosopher Elizabeth S. Anderson has been a vocal critic of it -- on the ground that, amongst other things, the fact that something is chosen does not necessarily make it acceptable. An example of this would be a robber offering someone the choice \\"Your money or your life,\\" which choice some theorists, including Thomas Hobbes (Leviathan XIV: \\"Covenants Extorted by Feare are Valide\\") have regarded as presumptively binding. She also claims that luck egalitarianism expresses a demeaning pity towards the disadvantaged, basing their claims to compensation not on equality but inferiority, and excludes many individuals from the social conditions of their freedom simply on the basis that it is judged to be their fault for losing them. Further, it involves the state making highly moralistic and intrusive judgements about the choices that individuals make, and seems to lead to very counter-intuitive conclusions: those who voluntarily enter jobs with higher-than-average risks, or who 'choose' to live in geographical locations prone to natural disasters may make no claim on others if they suffer as a result of it. Susan Hurley has argued that any attempt to ground egalitarianism in issues concerning luck and responsibility must fail, because there is no non-circular way of specifying an egalitarian baseline rather than any other baseline. For instance, a luck inegalitarian could believe that the baseline from which we should correct luck is one where huge inequalities exist. Without merely assuming equality, there seems to be no way of coming to prefer one approach over the other. Global luck egalitarianism Global luck egalitarianism is a view about distributive justice at the global level associated with cosmopolitan moral theory. It starts from the premise that it is a bad thing for some people to be worse off than others through no fault of their own and applies this intuition across borders. Global luck egalitarians characteristically believe that moral agents may have duties to mitigate the brute luck of distant others. Proponents of this school of thought are amongst others Simon Caney and arguably Charles Beitz; opponents, most of whom reject the above premise either in its entirety or with respect to inequalities in which one party's welfare is at least above some minimum level, include Robert Nozick. Advocates Prominent advocates of luck egalitarianism have included Ronald Dworkin, Richard Arneson, Gerald Cohen, John Roemer, Eric Rakowski, and Kok-Chor Tan. References  Further reading  * G. A.

Freedom of education is a constitutional (legal) concept that has been included in the European Convention on Human Rights, Protocol 1, Article 2, International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights Article 13 and several national constitutions, e.g. the Belgian constitution (former article 17, now article 24) and the Dutch constitution (article 23).Stichting Advisering Bestuursrechtspraak, grondwet artikel 23 (In Dutch) The English liberal philosopher John Stuart Mill was a strong advocate of education without the state. In his essay On Liberty, he wrote: :There are no libertarian objections to the state making the education of children compulsory. However, there are to the state providing and directing education. I go as far as anyone in deprecating that the whole or any large part of education should be in the hands of government. :Individual freedom and diversity in people‚Äôs characters, opinions, and modes of conduct require freedom and diversity in education ‚Äì and any general system of state education would be a contrivance for casting people into the same mould and shape. Education would aim to suit the governing power ‚Äì whether a monarch, a priesthood, an aristocracy, or a majority of the existing generation. The more efficient and successful state education was, the greater the despotism the state could establish over the minds and bodies of the people. If societies allow state-schools and universities to operate at all, these institutions should be just one among many competing forms and experiments in education. The government might establish them simply to provide models or examples of how to achieve certain standards of educational excellence.  Europe  The European forum for freedom in education was formed in 1989 and has 69 members across 13 countries.History of European forum for freedom in education , the European forum for freedom in education official website. Their official demands include a need for autonomy to students and teachers. It also establishes the importance of diversity in education, to allow parents the choice of sending their child to a school that aligns with their views.Demands of European forum for freedom in education , European forum for freedom in education demand's on EU policies. = The Netherlands = In the Netherlands, a political battle raged throughout the nineteenth century over the issue of the state monopoly on tuition-free education. It was opposed under the banner of \\"Freedom of Education\\" and the Separation of Church and State. The Dutch called it \\"De Schoolstrijd\\" (The Battle of the Schools). The Dutch solution was the separation of school and state by funding all schools equally, both public and private from 1917. The freedom of education resulted in the establishment of many new school types in the total spectrum of education in the Netherlands. New methods of education were introduced inspired by ideals on education (like those of Maria Montessori, Rudolf Steiner, Jenaplan). Schools were also funded based on religion. After the influx of workers from Islamic countries, Islamic schools were introduced. In 2003, in total 35 Islamic schools were in operation. However, a study in 2015 showed that the introduction of new schools for secondary education appeared difficult. Local communities, including existing local schools, resisted the introduction of new schools, for instance by delaying the procedure to find a location for a new school. Presently, freedom to teach religion in schools is a protected right, both for individuals or groups to teach, and for an individual to learn. While this plainly means children, it can also be interpreted to apply to parents' rights to have their valued beliefs or principles taught to the child.Marcel Maussen & Floris Vermeulen (2015) Liberal equality and toleration for conservative religious minorities. Decreasing opportunities for religious schools in the Netherlands?, Comparative Education, 51:1, 87-104, DOI: 10.1080/03050068.2014.935576 There have been issues around limiting the abilities of religious schools within the Netherlands. This includes serious threats to orthodox Jewish and Islamic schools' ability to enjoy this freedom. Following a general change in attitudes within the Netherlands there has been controversy surrounding balancing the freedom of education with the other rights of non-discrimination that might be seen, particularly towards women in many conservative Islamic schools. Most religious schools in the Netherlands have also since stopped acting within their own subset of institutions, thus lessening their power within the education system. Combined with the growth in diversity, and an overriding importance of non-discrimination, the ability for religious groups with conservative views in the Netherlands to educate their children in the manner that they were has been tarnished. =Situation in Europe (2013)= A University of Amsterdam study of 2013 ranked six member states by their parallel education (the ability to voluntary create a religious denomination which can be aided/impeded through funding) to give an indication of the freedom of groups and individuals to instill their religious beliefs through education.Applying tolerance indicators: assessing tolerance for religious schools, 2013, Marcel Maussen. The conclusions are listed below. Denmark Denmark achieved a high rating. Denmark‚Äôs constitution requires a duty of education, but not one aimed at the school. This creates an option for private education or home-school. Private schools receive a subsidy that covers approximately 3/4 of the costs. Over the last ten years, Denmark has raised its level of supervision of these schools and the obligations on the schools to regulate themselves. The Netherlands The Netherlands achieved a high rating; religious schools in the Netherlands which are private are funded equally to public schools and are subject to the same regulations. Well over half of the Netherlands' schools are built on the grounds of a religion. The Dutch constitution (article 23) protects freedom of education and means the government must hold private and state schools equally. While private schools need to employ proper teachers, they may select their teachers or pupils based on their spiritual beliefs or values. Ireland Ireland received a high rating. 95% of primary and 57% of secondary Irish schools are denominational, though this number is decreasing. Education is supported predominantly by Catholic but also Protestant, Jewish, and Muslim institutions and trusts. There are also Irish language schools for parents who want to teach their children through the national language, as a vast majority of the population of Ireland speaks English. Compared with the rest of the continent, religious educational groups have had strong levels of freedom, and have been able to establish schools that receive considerable State funding. Italy Italy received a medium rating. Religious schools in Italy are private, which can request to become treated like public schools. If they achieve this, they will be under the same rules as public schools. They can receive funding, but in most successful instances it was only Catholic schools managed by Catholic groups, the dominant religion in the country. Spain Spain received a medium rating. In theory Spain's constitution protects the right to create a school based upon a certain belief. However, in practice, establishing schools for minority groups can be problematic mostly due to the availability of resources. Fewer than ten schools in the country actually educate religious minority groups. Sweden Sweden received a high rating. The freedom of Swedish private schools is equal to that of state schools. While religious schools can select their own staff or students, the national regulations clearly state what can and cannot be omitted from teaching, such as gender. Rules surrounding dress or behaviour are allowed provided they comply within the general law. The ability to teach a notably Islamic curriculum is restricted, however, which meant that the rating of Sweden came close to being downgraded to medium. North America =United States of America= Around 17% of schools in the United States are faith- based. However, America does not offer families any public support to attend such schools routinely.Religious Schools in America Public schools are required by certain state laws to educate their students in a secular manner so as not to endorse any specific religion. However, most public schools in the US have become more responsive to a variety of dietary requirements, such as nut-free or vegetarian options, and children are allowed to be exempt from activities that would normally be inconsistent with their religious teachings. However, despite there being no constitutional pressures on the freedom of parents to choose education, the American society still opposes religious education in some states. Negative news reporting combined with the general attitude of American citizens places pressure upon parents who want to send their children to religious private schools. Though private schools are a great source of religious education for those who do not share the same views and opinions, joining a private school may not be the same option. South America Religious freedom of schools is supported through the Constitution of many South American countries. In Chile, funds are provided to both state and private schools at all ages. There is no non-Catholic teaching in most schools within this region, however.Religious education in schools While there is still some frequency of religious discrimination in South America, the legal and societal restrictions have been overcome through a combination of influence by the Vatican, the spread of Protestantism and Constitutional change. Freedom of education through a belief outside the Christian faith still remains a contested issue throughout South America.Education and religious freedom in South America Africa The South African Charter of Religious Rights and Freedoms section 15 allows for observance of religious observances in State or private schools, provided they are compliant with other laws.South African Bill of Rights Article 15. Australia There is legal support for free and open religious education within the Australian public schooling system, but its actual application is very rare. However, there is also support for a \\"confessional\\" method of religious education which has been commonplace since the 19th century. This method lets churches visit to give religious lessons in schools.Finding the balance: Religious education in Australia There are also many Islamic and Jewish schools throughout the country, with a strong presence in New South Wales and Victoria. The Australian government provides funding to private schools, over half of which are faith based.Australian funding of private schools. Asia =Israel= Israel currently offers a growing number of Haredi and Arab schools, as well as special private schools that reflect certain beliefs of parents, or are based around a foreign country curriculum, for example, Jerusalem American International School. Despite this, the success rate of Haredi students at the national level is significantly low. Israel also operates an Arab education system for their minority, including lessons on their own culture and history to support Arab parents. However, there have been allegations of better funding directed towards the Jewish education system. One report suggested that the Israeli government spends $192 per year on each Arab student, compared to $1,100 per Jewish student. A 2001 Human Rights Watch report claimed Arab school students were getting an inferior education from fewer resources and poorly constructed institutions.Israeli schools separate, not equal. =Arab countries= Women in the Arab world may still be denied equality of opportunity, although their disempowerment is a critical factor crippling the markets of the Arab nations to return to the first pitch of global leaders in star commerce, teenage learning and pop culture, according to a new United States-sponsored report in 2012. Education in the Arab World has made progress over the past decade. However, the quality of education remains poor, many children still leave primary education prematurely and illiteracy rates are relatively high, according to a new United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) report.Arab education lags behind world, says UNESCO  Educational and Academic Freedom  The Right to Education initiative described educational freedom as the \\"liberty of parents to ascertain religious as well as moral education of their children in accordance with their beliefs to choose schools aside from public institutions.\\" The State must respect this freedom within public education. Educational freedom includes the right of all people to institute and guide institutions that adhere to the State‚Äôs minimum standards in learning. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (General Comment 13) stipulates that the State must guarantee this right does not cause excessive disparities of educational opportunity for certain groups in society. Academic freedom pertains to the autonomy of academic community members to practice, develop, and communicate knowledge and ideas through research, teaching, dialogue, documentation, production, and writing either jointly or individually. Academic freedom calls for the independence of higher education entities. Freedom in education indicates the need for parents to become accountable for the education of their children. Governments do not possess authority or capability to force families and individuals or finance the education of students directly or indirectly.

The station is south of Lincoln Central. The station is now owned by Network Rail and managed by East Midlands Railway who provide all rail services.  History  = Early proposals = The Sleaford Navigation, which canalised a 12.5-mile stretch of the River Slea from its junction with the River Witham to Sleaford, opened in 1794. It facilitated the export of agricultural produce to the midlands and the import of coal and oil. Mills sprang up along the river's course and the Navigation Company's wharves were built near its office on Carre Street in Sleaford.Pawley 1996, pp. 64‚Äì66 Archived at the Internet Archive on In 1827, the River Witham Navigation committee investigated the possibility of a railway allowing Ancaster stone to be transported to the Sleaford Navigation. The cost of doing so and competition from other quarries meant that their plans came to nothing.Ellis 1981, p. 79 An 1836 scheme envisaged a railway between Nottingham and Boston which would have stopped at Sleaford, but the plans never left the drawing board. Another attempt, the Eastern Counties scheme, unsuccessfully tried to build a railway between Lincoln and Cambridge, with a branch to Boston via Heckington and an extension to Sleaford. After protests from the Sleaford Navigation company, the necessary Bill never passed. In 1845, the Ambergate Company designed a railway from Ambergate to Nottingham, with branches to Boston, Spalding, Grantham and Sleaford. A Bill to that effect passed through the Houses of Parliament in 1846, but the railway only reached Grantham. In the meantime, the more ambitious Great Northern Railway from London to York was also endorsed by an Act of Parliament; it passed through Grantham and a loop line from Boston to Lincoln was operating by 1848, yet its planned extension between Boston and Sleaford was not sanctioned.Ellis 1981, p. 79-80 = The railways arrive = A new plan emerged in 1852 and was presented before Parliament the following year. The Sleaford, Boston and Midland Counties Railway would pass through Boston, Sleaford and Grantham. The proposals met with considerable support from businessmen in Sleaford, including a number of Navigation officials; they envisaged it as a mode of transporting coal and stone.Ellis 1981, p. 80 The Bill passed in August 1853. Constructed by Smith, Knight & Co. under the supervision of the engineers W. H. Brydone and Edward Harrison, the line between Barkston, near Grantham, and Sleaford opened on 15 June 1857.Ellis 1981, pp. 80‚Äì81 An elaborate set of celebrations were organised for the opening day of the new Sleaford railway station, which saw all of the town's businesses close to allow their employees chance take part in the festivities; over 700 men from the area were invited to a free lunch on the cricket fields.Ellis 1981, pp. 81‚Äì82 The Grantham‚ÄìSleaford line cost ¬£130,000 to construct, averaging at ¬£11,850 per mile; the extension to Boston opened on 12 April 1859, at a cost of ¬£6,500 per mile, considerably cheaper thanks to the flat terrain (the hillier Ancaster area, by contrast, required cuttings).Ellis 1981, pp. 83‚Äì84 From the outset, the rolling stock was owned by the Great Northern Railway Company (GNR), who took over ownership of the line on 1 July 1864.Ellis 1981, p. 85 = New connections = The Great Eastern Railway wanted to build a line from Cambridge to York, which would have passed through Sleaford and Bourne, but Parliament would not allow it. The GNR submitted a proposal for a line between Bourne and Sleaford, which, after amendments to the route, was approved in 1865 and opened in 1872.Ellis 1981, p. 86 Next came the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway which opened from Spalding through Sleaford to Ruskington and from there to Lincoln Central in 1882. Kirk and Parry, Sleaford-based building contractors, built the line, while the Ruskington-based builders Pattinson's constructed the new stations along the route. The line was designed to transport freight, which necessitated an avoiding line around Sleaford; Sleaford station was also extended. The last new line through Sleaford ran to RAF Cranwell and opened in 1916. = Operations and later history = The Cranwell branch ran at a loss: in response to a Parliamentary Question, it was revealed that, allowing for a credit in respect of the c.15,000 tons of Government stores that were transported along it during 1924, the line made a loss of some ¬£3,570, although it was reported that \\"any alternative means ... would involve considerably greater expenditure\\".

Diagram of the frog heart preparation used by Loewi. Vagus nerve stimulation slows heart rate while accelerator (sympathetic) nerve stimulation speeds up heart rate. Vagusstoff (literally translated from German as \\"Vagus Substance\\") refers to the substance released by stimulation of the vagus nerve which causes a reduction in the heart rate. Discovered in 1921 by physiologist Otto Loewi, vagusstoff was the first confirmation of chemical synaptic transmission and the first neurotransmitter ever discovered. It was later confirmed to be acetylcholine, which was first identified by Sir Henry Hallett Dale in 1914. Because of his pioneering experiments, in 1936 Loewi was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, which he shared with Dale. The discovery of Vagusstoff By the time Loewi began his experiments there was much discussion among scientists whether communication between nerves and muscles was chemical or electrical by nature. Experiments by Luigi Galvani in the 18th century had demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the frog sciatic nerve resulted in twitching of the leg muscles, and from this he developed the concept of bioelectricity. This led to the idea that direct electrical contact between nerves and muscles mediated transmission of excitation. However, work by John Newport Langley had suggested that in the autonomic nervous system communication in the ciliary ganglion was chemical. Loewi's experiments, published in 1921 , finally settled the issue, proving that synaptic transmission was chemical. Figure 2. Loewi's experiment proving that neurotransmision was chemical, rather than electrical. Loewi performed a very simple yet elegant experiment. Using an isolated frog heart he had previously found that stimulation of the vagus nerve resulted in a slowing of the heart rate, while stimulation of the sympathetic nerve caused the heart rate to speed up (Figure 1). He reasoned that stimulation of either the vagus or sympathetic nerve would cause the nerve terminal to release a substance which would either slow or accelerate the heart rate. To prove this, he took a frog heart, which had been cannulated in order to perfuse the fluid surrounding the heart, and electrically stimulated the vagus nerve until the heart rate slowed. He then collected the fluid surrounding the heart and added it to a second frog heart which had been stripped of its vagal and sympathetic nerves. By adding the fluid surrounding the first heart to the second heart, he caused the heart rate of the second heart to slow down. This proved that stimulation of the vagus nerve caused the release of a substance which acted upon the heart tissue and directly caused the heart rate to slow down. (Figure 2) This substance was called vagusstoff. Vagustoff was later confirmed to be acetylcholine and was found to be the principal neurotransmitter in the parasympathetic nervous system. Original records from Loewi's experiment in 1921. Saline from the stimulated heart was added to the unstimulated heart whenever the number \\"2\\" is indicated in the graph. In an interesting aside, Loewi apparently had the idea for his experiment in a dream. He wrote it down in the middle of the night but the next morning could not decipher his writing. He eventually had the same dream on another night, and decided to run to the laboratory to perform the experiment in the middle of the night. About this incident, Loewi writes: :On mature consideration, in the cold light of the morning, I would not have done it. After all, it was an unlikely enough assumption that the vagus should secrete an inhibitory substance; it was still more unlikely that a chemical substance that was supposed to be effective at very close range between nerve terminal and muscle be secreted in such large amounts that it would spill over and, after being diluted by the perfusion fluid, still be able to inhibit another heart. (Loewi 1921) Loewi was fortunate in his choice of experimental preparation. In the species of frog used (Rana esculenta), the vagus contains both inhibitory and stimulatory fibers. In the winter, inhibitory fibers predominate, so Loewi was also fortunate to have performed his experiments in February or March. Additionally, acetylcholinesterase activity (the enzyme that degrades acetylcholine) is low, particularly in an unheated laboratory, allowing the neurotransmitter to remain long enough to be collected and applied to a second heart. Thanks to this confluence of events, Loewi was able to describe the existence of vagusstoff and prove the existence of chemical synaptic transmission.

It lies around west of North Berwick, and around east of Edinburgh. The oldest parts of the castle date to the 13th century, and it was abandoned by the end of the 17th century. Begun in around 1240 by John De Vaux, the castle was heavily damaged during the Wars of Scottish Independence, when it was twice taken by the English. In the 14th century, Dirleton was repaired by the Haliburton family, and it was acquired by the Ruthvens in 1505. The Ruthvens were involved in several plots against Mary, Queen of Scots, and King James VI, and eventually forfeited the castle in 1600. Dirleton ceased to be a residence, although Oliver Cromwell was forced to besiege the castle to flush out a band of \\"mosstroopers\\" (marauders), during the Third English Civil War in 1650. The damaged castle was then acquired by John Nisbet, Lord Dirleton, who decided to build a new country house on the nearby Archerfield Estate. The Nisbet family of Dirleton continued to maintain the castle's gardens, before handing Dirleton into state care in 1923. The ruins and gardens are now maintained by Historic Environment Scotland. Dirleton Castle stands on a rocky outcrop, at the heart of the rich agricultural lands of the barony of Dirleton, and guards the coastal approach to Edinburgh from England, via the port of North Berwick. The ruins comprise a 13th-century keep, and a 16th-century house which the Ruthvens built adjacent. Only the basement levels survive of the 14th- and 15th-century additions built by the Haliburtons, although these comprised a large hall and tower house along the east range. Other buildings within the courtyard have also been demolished. Surrounding the castle are gardens, which may have been first laid out in the 16th century, although the present planting is largely of the 20th century. The garden walls enclose a 16th-century doocot, or pigeon house. History =de Vaux= Latinised to de Vallibus, lairds of Dirletoun: Argent, a bend gules. De Vaux, Baron of Gilsland in Cumberland, bore arms: Argent, a bend checqy or and gulesNisbet, Alexander, A System of Heraldry Speculative and Practical : with the True Art of Blazon ..., p.93 and: Vans Agnew, Sketch of a genealogical and historical account of the family of Vaux, Vans ..., p.23 The English family of de Vaux, Baron of Gilesland in Cumberland, bore arms: Argent, a bend checqy or and gules (Vans Agnew, p.23) Reconstruction drawing, by Eug√®ne Viollet-le-Duc, of the Ch√¢teau de Coucy, which probably influenced the design of Dirleton The Norman family of de Vaux originated in Rouen, northern France, and settled in England following the Norman Conquest of 1066. Two de Vaux brothers, or cousins, were among a number of Anglo-Norman knights invited to Scotland, and granted land, by King David I of Scotland in the 12th century. Hubert de Vaux was given the barony of Gilsland in Cumbria, at that time part of Scotland, while John de Vaux was granted the barony of Dirleton. John built a castle at Eldbotle, probably to the north-west of modern Dirleton, and another, named Tarbet Castle, on the island of Fidra, although neither survives.Tabraham (2007), p.21 In 1220, Fidra was gifted to the monks of Dryburgh Abbey by William de Vaux.Tabraham (2007), p.22 William's son, another John, had been held hostage in England as surety for the good conduct of King William the Lion in 1213, and succeeded to the barony in the 1220s. He then began the construction of a replacement for Tarbet at Dirleton, which was recorded as a \\"castellum\\" in 1225,McWilliam, pp.174-177 although this may refer to an earlier timber structure. In 1239, de Vaux was appointed seneschal, or steward, to Marie de Coucy, on her marriage to King Alexander II. Marie de Coucy was the daughter of Enguerrand III, Lord of Coucy (d.1242), builder of the Ch√¢teau de Coucy, in Picardy (c.1220s), which probably served as a model for Dirleton.Tabraham (2007), p.23 The 13th- century stone castle, of which only the donjon, or keep, remains, represented a show of de Vaux's status, and would have required peaceful times to permit a prolonged construction project.Tabraham (1997), p.40 Peaceful times ended in 1296, with the outbreak of the Wars of Scottish Independence. Dirleton, which guarded the route between Edinburgh and the English border, changed hands several times through the invasions of the English under King Edward I. During the campaign of summer 1298, the castle was besieged by English forces under Antony Bek, the Bishop of Durham.Salter, pp.41-42 Dirleton withstood the assault for several months, until the English victory at Falkirk allowed them to bring up large siege engines, after which the castle was soon reduced.Tabraham (2007), p.24 Dirleton was garrisoned by the English, but must have been retaken by the Scots before 1306, when the English commander Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke recaptured Dirleton once more. It was finally retaken by the Scots some time before 1314, and was slighted, or deliberately damaged, to prevent its reuse by the English. left =Haliburton= The castle and lands of Dirleton passed to the Berwickshire family of Haliburton (or Halyburton) when John Haliburton (d.1355) married the heiress of the de Vaux family, shortly before 1350. The castle had been repaired by 1363, when it was seized by William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas, during his brief rebellion against King David II, although it was later returned to the Haliburtons. In the 1420s, Sir Walter Haliburton (d. before 1447) acted as a hostage in exchange for the release of King James I, who had been held captive by the English since 1406. He was rewarded in 1439 by being appointed Treasurer of Scotland.Tabraham (2007), p.26 Either Walter, or his eldest son John (d. before 1454), was ennobled as a Lord of Parliament in the 1440s, with the title Lord Dirletoun. The Haliburtons carried out extensive works at Dirleton, heightening the original towers, and constructing a new gatehouse to the south-east. A large hall and tower house were added to the castle in the 15th century, forming the east range. King James IV visited Dirleton in September 1505, and gave money to the masons then engaged on works in the north-east part of the castle. Later that year, Patrick, the last Haliburton of Dirleton, died, and his estates were divided among his three daughters, Janet, Margaret, and Mariotta.Tabraham (2007), p.28 =Ruthven= William Allan, depicting Lord Ruthven and others killing the Queen's secretary in her presence The eldest daughter, Janet, married William Ruthven, 2nd Lord Ruthven (d. 1552) in 1515, and the castle and lordship of Dirleton passed to the Ruthven family. The son of William and Janet, Patrick, 3rd Lord Ruthven (c. 1520‚Äì1566), was one of the leaders of the group who murdered David Riccio, private secretary to Mary, Queen of Scots, in 1566. Patrick was forced to flee to England, where he died, leaving Dirleton to his son William (c. 1541‚Äì1584), who was created Earl of Gowrie in 1581. Lord Gowrie led a plot, later known as the Raid of Ruthven, in which the 16-year-old King James VI was seized, in August 1582. Ruthven then ruled in the king's name, while James was held captive. Although Gowrie was pardoned the following year, he was executed in 1584 for his part in another plot to seize Stirling Castle, and his lands were forfeited to the crown. A keen amateur arboriculturalist, Lord Gowrie is thought to have laid out the gardens at Dirleton, and planted numerous trees. After the attempted coup failed in May 1584, Dorothea Stewart, Countess of Gowrie, was commanded to surrender Dirleton, Ruthven, Cousland, and the Gowrie lodging in Perth to the crown.David Masson, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland: 1578-1585, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1880), p. 663. James VI granted Dirleton to the Earl of Arran, who entertained the King there for twelve days in May 1585, while there was plague in Edinburgh. The entertainment includeed a sumptuous banquet and a Robin Hood play.David Masson, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland: 1578-1585, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1880), p. 744. The following year, the castle was restored to Dorothea Stewart, widow of the first Earl, and by 1600 had passed to John Ruthven, 3rd Earl of Gowrie (c. 1577‚Äì1600), their second son. Dorothea Stewart and her new husband Andrew Kerr of Faldonsyde complained in 1597 about a group of local men who stole rabbits from the links of Dirleton and terrorised her tenants. She was still living in the castle in November 1600.Register of the Privy Council, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1882), p. 408; vol. 6 (1884), p. 497: HMC 9th Report and Appendix: Elphinstone (London, 1884), p. 196. Dirleton played a role in the story of the ‚ÄúGowrie Conspiracy‚Äù of 1600 in that there has long been suspicion that the castle was taken from the Ruthvens and given to Thomas Erskine as a reward for assisting James VI in the murder of Patrick Ruthven‚Äôs sons: John, 3rd Earl of Gowrie, and his brother Alexander. The official narrative of the Gowrie Conspiracy, provided afterwards by the king, was that he and fifteen retainers, Erskine among them, had arrived at Gowrie House one night in August 1600 because he had been invited there by Alexander. However, as the narrative goes, the two brothers attempted to assassinate James, and in the melee that followed, the two Ruthvens were killed. While this was happening at Gowrie House, the other two Ruthven brothers, William and Patrick, were at Dirleton, apparently unaware of the plot afoot. Finding much to doubt in the king‚Äôs account, many have argued that James went to Gowrie House with his retinue for the express purpose of murdering John and Alexander, partly because the king owed the Earl of Gowrie a large sum of money and partly because there had long been a rumor that Gowrie was the grandson of James IV, which, if true, would have put him in line for the throne ahead of James VI. After the killings, the king divided the Gowrie estates and bestowed them on the men who had been with him that night. Erskine received the gift of Dirleton Castle in November 1600, which some perceive to be a form of ‚Äúblood money.‚Äù This perception is further substantiated by the fact that Erskine was created Baron Erskine of Dirletowne in 1604. Erskine sold the castle to Sir James Douglas in 1625. Douglas sold it on to Alexander Morieson of Prestongrange, who sold it in turn, in 1631, to James Maxwell of Innerwick (d. c. 1650), who was created Earl of Dirletoun in 1646. =Cromwell= Oliver Cromwell's army invaded Scotland in 1650, during the Third English Civil War, and defeated the Scots Royalists at Dunbar on 3 September. With this victory, Cromwell gained effective control of southern Scotland, but bands of Royalist moss-troopers continued to harry the English supply lines. One such band was based at Dirleton, and Cromwell ordered General Monck and General Lambert, with 1,600 troops, to capture the castle. This was achieved on 10 November, using mortars to destroy the drawbridge and inner gate.Lindsay, pp.188-190, Salter, pp.41-42 The captain of the moss- troopers was hanged from the walls with two of his comrades. The castle was slighted once more, and although briefly used as a field hospital, it was then left to decay.Tabraham (2007), p.30 The soldier and engineer responsible for Cromwell's effective use of artillery was a German, Major Joachim Hane. He also designed fortresses near Inverness and in Ayr, and directed the mortar fire at the siege of Stirling Castle in August 1651. He later spent a year spying for Cromwell's Secretary of State, John Thurloe. left =Nisbet= Dirleton Castle and estate were purchased, from the widowed Countess of Dirletoun, by the lawyer John Nisbet (c. 1609‚Äì1687) in 1663. Nisbet, who took the title Lord Dirleton when he was appointed as a judge, built a new house at Archerfield, to the north-west of the village. The Nisbets continued to maintain the gardens around the castle as part of the park around Archerfield, and installed the bowling green. The 19th-century garden walls were added by Mary Nisbet, Lady Elgin (1778‚Äì1855), wife of the Earl of Elgin, as part of a \\"beautification\\" of Dirleton village. In the mid-19th century, two new parterres were laid out by the head gardener, David Thompson. Although neither survived, the west garden was restored, based on 19th-century plans, in 1993. The north garden was replaced in the 1920s with an Arts and Crafts-style garden of herbaceous borders.Tabraham (2007), p.31 Also in the 1920s, the castle was passed into state care, and is now maintained by Historic Environment Scotland, an agency of the Scottish Government. The castle and grounds are protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument, while the gardens appear on the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland, the national register of historic gardens. The castle, doocot, and boundary walls are Category A listed buildings, the highest level of protection for a historic building in Scotland. Description thumb300pxFloor plans of the castle.

The castle is built on a natural rocky outcrop, on a low ridge overlooking the farmland of East Lothian. It comprises a kite-shaped courtyard, by , flanked by buildings on the south and east sides. The most substantial remains are the Ruthven Lodging, the gatehouse, and the de Vaux keep to the south, while only the basement of the east range survives. Fragments of the north and west curtain walls outline the courtyard, which was formerly divided in two by further 16th-century buildings. The castle was originally approached from the south, via a bridge and drawbridge, across a wide ditch. In the 16th century, steps were built to access the Ruthven lodging from the west. =The keep= The keep, or donjon, survives largely intact from the 13th century, and forms the south-west part of the present castle. Described by architectural historian W. D. Simpson as a \\"cluster keep\\",Lindsay, pp.188-190 it comprises a large round tower to the south, a smaller round tower to the west, with the two joined by a square tower. The masonry is of squared ashlar, or dressed stone blocks. Internally, the original use of the rooms is difficult to interpret, although the round towers may have served as private suites for Lord Dirleton and his Lady.Tabraham (2007), p.12 The large tower contains a six-sided chamber at ground level, possibly a kitchen, with a seven-sided main chamber above. This room has a pointed vaulted ceiling, window seats in the large windows around the south wall, and a carved fireplace at the north. To the east is a postern, or side door, and beyond is a well. Adjacent to the well is a floor hatch, which would have allowed food to be transferred directly from the kitchen to a servery above.Tabraham (2007), p.13 A room in the square tower to the west, possibly the lord's bedroom, has holes in the ceiling to allow smoke from braziers to escape. The more ruined west round tower probably contained another hall, with chambers above and storage below. In the 17th century, the top of the main round tower was lowered and remodelled to form a gun platform.Tabraham (2007), p.6 Only fragments of the rest of the 13th-century castle remain. A fourth tower, where the Ruthven lodging now stands, may have completed the \\"cluster keep\\". Bases of round towers at the south-east and north-east corners of the castle are visible below the later walls. Parts of the north-west wall are 13th-century work, as is the blocked postern in the basement of the east range. The overall plan of the castle, however, was not greatly changed through later rebuilding work. Dirleton is the earliest dated example in Scotland of a castle with round towers that project beyond the curtain wall, as opposed to those at Dunstaffnage, for example, where the towers are contained within the walls. This new form was subsequently used in other 13th-century Scottish castles, including Bothwell and Kildrummy. left =The east range and gatehouse= The gatehouse, kitchens, and east range were built by the Haliburtons in the 14th and 15th centuries. The gatehouse, built in the 14th century to the east of the keep, is similar to the one at nearby Tantallon Castle. It is fronted by a high, pointed arch, formerly with bartizans, small round turrets, at the top. The gate was protected by a drawbridge over the outer ditch, a portcullis, and three sets of doors. Guard rooms open off the entrance passage, and a round opening in the roof, known as a \\"murder hole\\", allowed defenders to drop objects on to any attacker who breached the outer gate.Tabraham (2007), p.9 The large kitchens occupy the south-east angle of the castle. The high main kitchen has two wide fireplaces for cooking, and a circular vent in the vaulted ceiling. Hatches in the floor give access to a well ( deep) and cellars below. The adjacent passage linked the kitchen to the hall in the east range. right The east range itself runs the length of the east side of the castle, and originally comprised a large hall, with a square tower house at the north-east corner. Although only the basement survives, this once formed one of the finest noble residences of its time in Scotland, and would have been similar to the contemporary buildings at Doune Castle.Tabraham (2007), p.14 The basement is a single tunnel vault, with low walls subdividing the area into stores. Two large ovens and a well lie at the south end, while at the east is the 13th-century postern, blocked when the wall was thickened to support the new buildings above, and re-used as a fireplace. At the north end of the basement is a vaulted prison for freemen, and below this, a rock-cut pit, square, to house prisoners of the peasant classes. Above the prison, but still within the basement, is a vaulted chapel with various ceremonial recesses, such as a sacristy and a piscina, or water basin. A private chamber for the priest is next door. The hall above is by , and once had a high timber roof, and a minstrel's gallery at the south end. An ornately carved stone buffet, or cupboard, is located on this wall, which formed part of the servery next to the kitchen.Tabraham (2007), p.17 At the north-east corner of the castle, a tower house provided accommodation for the Lord's family and guests. Again, only the lowest floor remains, above the chapel. This probably formed a private chamber for the Lord, and was connected to the adjacent hall. left =The Ruthven Lodging= Constructed by the Ruthvens after they acquired the castle around 1515, the Ruthven Lodging represents the final stage of building at Dirleton. In the later part of the 16th century, it served as the main residence of Lady Dorothea, wife of the first Earl of Gowrie, and their 15 children.Tabraham (1997), p.10 The three-storey building is constructed, like the Haliburton range, from undressed stone, although the Ruthven Lodging is decorated with string courses, horizontal mouldings running around the walls. The large windows were protected by iron grilles and small gun holes. The rectangular Lodging is immediately to the north of the de Vaux building, separated by a narrow irregular courtyard, which is accessed via a passage in the ground floor of the Lodging. The remainder of the ground floor was occupied by cellars, with family rooms and bedrooms on the upper floors. The first-floor dining room was paved with patterned floor tiles, and may once have had a painted timber ceiling. The gardens right The castle is set within extensive gardens, bounded by a 19th-century wall. The gardens were first laid out in the 16th century, but have undergone many changes. A bowling green lies to the west of the castle, fringed by yew trees, which may once have formed a hedge around a parterre in this area.Tabraham (2007), p.18 West of the bowling green is a flower garden, laid out in 1993 to an 18th-century design, and containing yew, cedar, monkey puzzle and Lawson's cypress trees. To the north is the 1920s Arts and Crafts garden, which is home to a -long herbaceous border, and is overlooked by a castellated 19th-century gazebo, or summer house. The border is recognised by the Guinness Book of Records as being the longest in the world. The rest of the gardens comprise lawns, with numerous mature specimen trees, including redwood, beech, and sycamore. There is a well-preserved 16th-century beehive-shaped doocot, or pigeon house, in the castle grounds. The doocot is high, and contains around 1000 nesting boxes for pigeons, which were an important source of food for the castle's inhabitants. To the north-east, now located outside the castle gardens, is a 16th-century gateway which formerly served the castle, but now serves the adjacent farm.

In 2014 it was split again, between Hadlow College and East Kent College, with West Kent College being reestablished and the campus in Ashford becoming Ashford College. The Interim Principal was Phil Frier and the Patron was Lord Mayhew of Twysden. History K College was formed in April 2010 by the merger of South Kent College with West Kent College. The college had campuses in Ashford, Dover, Folkestone, Tonbridge and Royal Tunbridge Wells and at one point had more than 25,000 students. , when the decision was taken to split it, the college had approximately 15,000 students and more than 1,100 staff. The college sustained a large amount of debt,Private Eye no 1355 p. 31. after which the principal, Bill Fearon, and some members of the Board of Governors resigned, and the Skills Funding Agency recommended it be sold. The college received an \\"inadequate\\" grading by Ofsted in December 2013, and from 1 August 2014 it was again split into two units: *Hadlow College Group formally acquired K College Group; it took over the Tonbridge and Tunbridge Wells campuses as West Kent College and Ashford campus as Ashford College. *East Kent College took over Folkestone and Dover. In July 2014 prior to Hadlow College managing the Ashford, Tonbridge and Tunbridge Wells campuses, K College announced that there would be up to 127 redundancies of those not transferred under TUPE to East Kent College. However, East Kent College expanded offerings and recruited additional staff for the Folkestone and Dover campuses after the takeover.  Courses  K College offered Higher Education courses in conjunction with the College‚Äôs partner universities: Canterbury Christ Church University, University of Greenwich and University of Kent. The main campus in Tonbridge taught a large number of A-level and vocational courses including apprenticeships. It also ran teacher training courses, including additional teaching courses on deaf issues and dyslexia, and TUC courses and had a Professional Development Centre. The college also ran a construction-orientated teaching centre based at the Construction Crafts & Engineering Centre on North Farm Industrial Estate in Tunbridge Wells.  Student Union  The West Kent College Student Association was rebranded as K College Student Union. The main rebrand involved developing a new logo, changing its name and initiating a consultation on its constitution. It consisted of a President, Vice-President, Communications Officer and six Union Officers. These have since split apart to cover each separate 'chain', but retain a similar democratic structure.

Life and works The Moulins Triptych (detail of central panel) Margaret of Austria Little is known about Hey, whose style has led to speculation that he may have studied under Hugo van der Goes. It is possible that he spent his last years in Paris. Hey's most well-known work, the triptych in Moulins Cathedral, dates from the end of 15th century. The central panel shows the Madonna and Child adored by angels, and is flanked by portraits of the duke Pierre II and the duchess Anne de Beaujeu with their daughter Suzanne. The triptych's state of preservation is generally excellent, although at some time before the 1830s the top and bottom of the wings were trimmed (the left wing more at the bottom and the right wing more at the top).Reynolds 1996 p. 732 Identifying the Master of Moulins Nativity with donor portrait of Cardinal Rolin Until the 1902 Exposition des primitifs flamands √† Bruges, the name of the painter of the Moulins Triptych was unknown, although art historians identified a number of other works that were evidently by the same hand. Georges Hulin de Loo first made the connection between this artist and a Jehan P√©rreal de Paris when he compared the drapery and sleeves of the Mary Magdalene lent from the L√©on de Somzee collection, to the Moulins triptych.Maitres Anonymes, extract of Hulin de Loo's critical catalog of the Bruges 1902 art exhibition File:Meister von Moulins 002.jpgMary Magdalene from the Somzee collection in the 1902 exhibition File:Hay7.JPGPortrait of Francis de Chateaubriand, also on loan from Glasgow to the 1902 exhibition File:Georges Hulin de Loo - Titlepage Maitres Anonymes 1902.jpgExtract of Hulin de Loo's critical catalog with his anonymous master identifications The first monograph on the Master of Moulins, written in 1961 by Madeleine Huillet d'Istria, argued that this artist did not actually exist, and that more than 12 different artists were responsible for the corpus of works traditionally ascribed to him.Ch√¢telet, p. 517 The Master's identity was established after an inscription was found on the reverse of a damaged painting, Christ with Crown of Thorns (1494) in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels, identifying the artist as Jean Hey, teutonicus and pictor egregius (\\"the famous painter\\"), and identifying the patron as Jean Cueillette, who was secretary to the King and an associate of the Bourbon family.Reynolds 1996, p. 733 Stylistic similarities link this painting to the works attributed to the Master of Moulins. The Master of Moulins appears to have been the court painter for the Bourbons,Reynolds 1996, p. 734 and from a surviving account for 1502‚Äì03, it is clear that the court painter's name was Jean; other candidates once considered plausible, such as Jean Perr√©al and Jean Pr√©vost (an artist from Lyon who worked in stained glass), have proven untenable in the light of subsequent research.

This low melting colorless solid is a powerful lachrymator. As a precursor to a variety of valuable bioactive compounds, it is the most important organic isothiocyanate in industry. Synthesis It is prepared industrially by two routes. Annual production in 1993 was estimated to be 4M kg. The main method involves the thermal rearrangement of methyl thiocyanate: :CH3S-C‚â°N ‚Üí CH3N=C=S It is also prepared via with the reaction of methylamine with carbon disulfide followed by oxidation of the resulting dithiocarbamate with hydrogen peroxide. A related method is useful to prepare this compound in the laboratory. MITC forms naturally upon the enzymatic degradation of glucocapparin, a modified sugar found in capers. Reactions A characteristic reaction is with amines to give methyl thioureas: :CH3NCS + R2NH ‚Üí R2NC(S)NHCH3 :Reaction scheme: MITC and secondary amine react to form a thiourea Other nucleophiles add similarly. Applications Solutions of MITC are used in agriculture as soil fumigants, mainly for protection against fungi and nematodes.

In 1565 the House of Stewart of Darnley was re-united with the Royal House of Stewart when Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley married his first cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots, both being grandchildren of Margaret Tudor, daughter of King Henry VII of England, and hence both having claim to the English throne. The son of this union James VI of Scots succeeded to the throne of England as James I. The later English kings of the House of Stuart, from James I and Charles I onwards, were more properly members of the Stewart of Darnley branch, and all drew upon their feudal heritage in Lennox. Origins and name The Stewarts of Darnley were descended from Sir John Stewart of Bonkyll, the second son of Alexander Stewart, 4th High Steward of Scotland. Their name is derived from Derneley, a barony in Eastwood parish, Renfrewshire. It was located east of Barrhead, present day Darnley, within the city of Glasgow. In 1356, Robert Stewart, High Steward of Scotland granted the barony to Sir John Stewart. Like the Royal Stewarts, the Stewarts of Darnley used both the Stuart and the Stewart spelling of their surname. =Ancestors= *Alexander Stewart, 4th High Steward of Scotland *John Stewart of Bonkyll (d.1298) *Alan Stewart of Dreghorn (d.1333) *Alexander Stewart of Darnley (d.1374) *Alexander Stewart of Darnley (d.1404) *John Stewart of Darnley (d.1429) *Alan Stewart of Darnley (d.1439) Lordship of Aubigny Sir John Stewart of Darnley (d.1429) fought in the Hundred Years' War under his namesake and distant cousin John Stewart, 2nd Earl of Buchan in the army of Charles VII of France. For his services he was rewarded with the lands of Aubigny-sur-Nere and Concressault which were given to the second son in the family so they could live in France to strengthen the Auld Alliance. Important members of this branch were: *Bernard Stewart, Lord of Aubigny, commander of the Garde √âcossaise, commander in the armies of King Charles VIII of France and Louis XII of France during the Italian Wars. *Robert Stewart, Lord of Aubigny, Marshal of France, fought in the Battle of Marignano and Battle of Pavia. *George Stewart, 9th Seigneur d'Aubigny, fought with the French against the Spanish at the Battle of Montju√Øc (1641). Killed during the English Civil War at the Battle of Edge Hill. The Earldom of Lennox The eldest son of Alan Stewart of Darnley (d.1439) was John Stewart, Lord Darnley, head of the House of Stewart of Darnley, who was created Earl of Lennox. He died in 1495 and was succeeded by the following descendants: *Matthew Stewart, 2nd Earl of Lennox (1488- ob Flodden, 1513) *John Stewart, 3rd Earl of Lennox (ob 1526) *Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox (1516‚Äì1571) In 1580 the head of the House of Darnley King James VI of Scots granted the title Duke of Lennox to Esm√© Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox a cousin and a member of a French branch of the Royal Stewarts. The following English members of the House of Stewart of Darnley were styled Earls of Lennox by the English Crown, although the King of Scots, in whose Kingdom the Earldom of Lennox lay, did not recognize their title. *Charles Stuart, 1st Earl of Lennox (1555‚Äì1576), second son of the 4th Earl of the second creation *Lady Arbella Stuart, 2nd Countess of Lennox (1575‚Äì1615) (over-ridden) Claimants to the English Throne In 1544 Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox married Margaret Douglas, the granddaughter of Henry VII. Their sons Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley and Charles Stuart, 1st Earl of Lennox, were held by contemporaries to have a credible claim to the throne of England. Margaret Douglas was the fruit of the 1514 union of Margaret Tudor, Dowager Queen of Scots and elder daughter of Henry VII with Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus. Born in England and raised at the court of her uncle Henry VIII, Margaret was Henry's officially recognized heir between the disgrace of Anne Boleyn and the birth of the future Edward VI. In 1565 Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley married his cousin Mary Queen of Scots, like him a descendant of Margaret Tudor and Henry VII. Mary's descent from Margaret Tudor's first marriage to James IV of Scots also placed her in line for the English throne, but many argued that Margaret Douglas's claim was superior as Margaret and her sons Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley and Charles Stuart, 1st Earl of Lennox had been born in England. According to English custom it is desirable that the monarch be naturalized or born in England. By marrying Darnley, Mary neutralized a dangerous rival claim to the throne of England whilst strengthening that of her own house. In 1603 Mary and Darnley's son, James VI of Scotland, succeeded Elizabeth I as King of England, thereby uniting the crowns of England and Scotland and laying the basis for the future United Kingdom.

One night stand on the streetsThe Hindu, Metro Plus Bangalore. 12 July 2005.Women take to streets to stake claim to their rights The Hindu, New Delhi. 17 September 2006. The project, initiated by Jasmeen Patheja in August 2003, started out as a student project at Srishti School of Art Design and Technology in Bangalore and has since spread out to other cities in India.  Activities  Blank Noise is led and run completely by volunteers. A core team of male and female volunteers from across geographical locations and age groups work with the collective. Blank Noise seeks to trigger public dialogue on the issue of street sexual harassment. Conversations range from collectively building a definition of \\"eve-teasing\\" to defining the boundaries of \\"teasing\\", \\"harassment\\", \\"flirting\\". The collective builds testimonials of street sexual violence, harassment and \\"eve-teasing\\" and disperses them back in public, thereby creating public debate. It addresses women's fear based relationship with their cities via direct street action and public interventions, which ask women to be \\"Action Heroes\\" by not being idle in public. They are referred to as Blank Noise Guys. Blank Noise works towards an attitudinal shift towards 'eve-teasing' and involves the public to take collective responsibility of the issue. Poster of the campaign \\"I Never Ask For It\\". Though Blank Noise was founded in Bangalore, it has spread to other cities such as Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Calcutta, Chandigarh, Hyderabad, and Lucknow. It tackles the notion of shame and blame through campaigns such as \\"I never ask for it\\" (ask to be sexually harassed when on the streets). A major notion that it seeks to dispel is that women get harassed because of the clothing they wear. Through street actions and dialogue, Blank Noise hopes to achieve its aims of achieving a safe and free environment for women on the streets, and enable society to become more egalitarian towards women in general. In Dec 2012, following the brutal gang rape of a young woman in a moving bus in Delhi, Blank Noise started the Safe City Pledge, an initiative urging citizens to pledge ways in which they can make cities safer for women. The project has undertaken actions such as spray painting messages, recording the testimonies of victims of sexual harassment in public places, and printing tee shirts with anti- harassment messages on them. It has also staged demonstrations.A night out on Capital pavements to end eveteasing Indian Express Delhi Newsline. 17 September 2006.

Its tall bell tower, the Torre dos Cl√©rigos, can be seen from various points of the city and is one of its most characteristic symbols.  History  The church was built for the Brotherhood of the Cl√©rigos (Clergy) by Nicolau Nasoni, an Italian architect and painter who left an extensive body of work in the north of Portugal during the 18th century. Construction of the church began in 1732 and was finished in 1750, while the bell tower and the monumental divided stairway in front of the church were completed in 1763. The main fa√ßade of the church is heavily decorated with baroque motifs (such as garlands and shells) and an indented broken pediment. This was based on an early 17th-century Roman scheme. The central frieze above the windows present symbols of worship and an incense boat. The lateral fa√ßades reveal the almost elliptic floorplan of the church nave.  Overview  Cl√©rigos Church interior Cl√©rigos Church facade The Cl√©rigos Church was one of the first baroque churches in Portugal to adopt a typical baroque elliptic floorplan. The altarpiece of the main chapel, made of polychromed marble, was executed by Manuel dos Santos Porto. The monumental tower of the church, located at the back of the building, was only built between 1754 and 1763. The baroque decoration here also shows influence from the Roman Baroque, while the whole design was inspired by Tuscan campaniles. The tower is 75.6 metres high, dominating the city. There are 240 steps to be climbed to reach the top of its six floors. This great structure has become the symbol of the city. In Porto, Nicolau Nasoni was also responsible for the construction of the Miseric√≥rida Church, the Archbishop's Palace and the lateral loggia of Porto Cathedral. He entered the Cl√©rigos Brotherhood and was buried, at his request, in the crypt of the Cl√©rigos Church, with the exact place remaining unknown. In June 2015, the Cl√©rigos Brotherhood announced that after 250 years, the Cl√©rigos Tower and Church will open its doors during nighttime hours.

Early years Nichols graduated in 1968 from Lamar University in Beaumont, Texas, with a degree in industrial engineering. He had a career as a small businessman before being elected mayor of Jacksonville, Texas, and served as mayor 1985-1989. Public service During his tenure as mayor, Nichols streamlined the city government and helped to cut property tax rates. His service as Mayor eventually convinced then-Governor of Texas George W.

Nichols was appointed again in 2003 by former Texas Governor Rick Perry, and continued to serve until he resigned to prepare for a bid for the Texas Senate. 2006 and 2018 elections Nichols faced stiff competition in 2006 from Republicans Bob Reeves of Center; David Kleimann of Willis; and Frank Denton of Conroe in the Republican primary. Nichols secured a 54% win, thus avoiding a runoff. Nichols' primary win was tantamount to winning the general election, as he did not have a Democratic candidate run against him in 2006. In the general election of November 6, 2018, Nichols defeated the Democrat, Shirley Layton, and the Libertarian Party nominee, Bruce Quarels. Nichols received 214,756 votes (78.3 percent) to Layton's 56,274 (20.5 percent) and Quarles' 3,280 (1.2 percent).

The station is now owned by Network Rail and managed by East Midlands Railway who provide all rail services. History The station opened for service on 17 October 1848 with the opening of the Great Northern Railway East Lincolnshire line. The station has declined in importance since the 1960s. In its heyday the station employed over 50 staff and had two through tracks and cover over the platform tracks. The Skegness bound platform had classic Great Northern Railway architecture buildings as well, now replaced with plastic shelters. The station frontage remains, albeit altered, in partially reconstructed manner, and some of the buildings have found new uses. Boston station was once an important junction, with two lines diverging in either direction. Today, only the eastbound line to Skegness, and the westbound line towards Sleaford remain in use. There was previously a southbound line to Spalding (closed in October 1970) that joined the line to Peterborough (and formed part of the original GNR main line from London to York), and a north-westbound line to Woodhall Junction (closed in June 1963) and thence on towards Lincoln, Horncastle, or Louth. Both surviving routes are single line, with a passing loop at the station. To the south of the station the access to Boston Docks via the swing bridge and the site of the Broadfield Lane depot remain (the rail link into the docks still sees occasional use).

He has also played with the bands Sharkboy, Oysterband and Goat. Biography =Early years, and work with Goat= Adrian Oxaal was born in California, United States, of mixed Norwegian-American and Guyanese ancestry, however, he grew up in Kingston upon Hull where he learned guitar and cello and befriended his future James colleague Saul Davies when both were members of the City of Hull Youth Symphony Orchestra. Oxaal went on to study music at the University of Sussex in Brighton, where he settled permanently.'One of the Three ‚Äì Adrian Oxaal page, Oneofthethree.co.uk Oxaal's heart was not in the world of classical music, and after leaving university he chose to play in bar bands ‚Äì a process which led to him being asked to play on a demo for a band named Goat (not the Swedish band of the same name) whose music Oxaal would later describe as being \\"a kind of melodic hard rock.\\" Goat went to sign a deal with Beggars Banquet, although he admitted that it did not really amount to much apart from some studio experience. =Sharkboy= Oxaal was then recruited by singer-songwriter Avy to her band Sharkboy, in which he predominantly played guitar and cello. Somewhat different to ‚Äì and more experimental than ‚Äì the usual Britpop acts of the time, Sharkboy were nonetheless signed to Nude and went on to support Suede (whose frontman Brett Anderson was a fan) on their first big UK tour. Sharkboy recorded two albums (Matinee and The Valentine Tapes) which were critically well received but sold poorly, and the band folded circa 1995. =James= At around the same time the band James were having personnel problems, as lead guitarist Larry Gott had announced his departure. Oxaal's friend Saul Davies had been in James since 1989 (playing rhythm guitar, violin and percussion) and suggested Oxaal as a possible replacement for Gott. Oxaal was given an introduction to James that he regards as \\"bizarre\\", in which he was only given a drum loop and a vocal track and was asked to just \\"do something\\". The remaining members of James were impressed with his guitar skills and gave him the job immediately, relieved that they did not have to go through the long audition process which they had already experienced with the search for previous members. Oxaal formally joined James in 1996 and remained as lead guitarist until the band went on hiatus in early 2002. During this time he played on three studio albums (Whiplash, Millionaires and Pleased To Meet You, as well as the live album/DVD Getting Away With It... Live. When James reformed in January 2007, Larry Gott resumed his position as lead guitarist and the band resumed their early 1990s Gold Mother line-up, which includes neither Oxaal nor the subsequent James member Michael Kulas. In 2015, Oxaal was recalled to play lead guitar again, while Gott took an extended sabbatical. He also played mandolin and cello on the album Girl at the End of the World (2016). James fans still debate about whether Oxaal or Gott was best suited to be James' lead guitarist, as many preferred Gott's simpler playing style and use of slide. However, drummer Dave Baynton-Power described Oxaal in 1997 as being \\"a really good guitar player....a bit more rocking than Larry, he's got a bit of an edge, which has injected a new spark into the band\\". This became evident on both the Whiplash and Millionaires albums, as well as in the live environment in which Oxaal was noted for his willingness to play \\"storming\\" guitar solos from time to time (something never really attempted by either Gott or his own predecessor in James, Paul Gilbertson). =Post-James (work in music education)= Following his time in James, Oxaal returned to Brighton and performed a handful of solo bar gigs, seemingly having gone full circle since leaving University. He then moved into music education, having worked as Course Team Leader for the BTEC National Diploma in Contemporary Music at South East Essex College of Arts and Technology in Southend-on-Sea, Essex. He left this post during the summer of 2007, and worked as a music teacher at Bexhill College, East Sussex, followed by a stint at City College, Brighton. When not touring with James or Oysterband, Oxaal performs solo, either singing to blues guitar, or singing to cello accompaniment. He also plays with Lucky Jim, a pub band comprising Gordon Grahame of The Lost Soul Band on vocals and guitar and Eddie Myer of Turin Brakes on bass. He has also appeared in many stage productions including: Motherland by Vincent Dance Theatre (2013), The Opinion Makers by Brian Mitchell and Joseph Nixon (2013) and Trumpton Comes Alive!, also with the Foundry Group (2015). =Oysterband= Since 2012, Oxaal has toured the UK, Germany, Austria, Canada and Scandinavia with folk rock band Oysterband, mainly playing cello, but also taking over on bass guitar and electric guitar. He played on their 2014 album Diamonds on the Water.

The remaining section of a defensive ditch, dug to close the gap between forest and marsh, is known as Brent Ditch, which runs between Abington Park and Dickman's Grove, and is most clearly seen in the park of Pampisford Hall. Famous local families The Herald's Visitations (1575 and 1619) record an armiger holding an estate here, John Killingworth, who is designated \\"of Pampisford\\", although he appears to have resided at another Killingworth estate, West Hall Manor at Mundford, in Norfolk.Blomefield, the Rev. Francis, The Topographical History of Norfolk, London, vol.2, 1805, pps: 244 & 247. John had been educated at Queens' College, Cambridge.Venn, J & J A, Alumni Cantabrigienses'. vol.1, Part 3, p.16. The Killingworths also held Balsham Place Manor in CambridgeshireThe Victoria County History, Cambridgeshire, vol.vi, p.129. and John purchased Clare Priory in Suffolk from John Frende in 1589, who had it at the dissolution. It appears that the Killingworths were feudal tenants of the manor at Pampisford, held from the Cloville family as superiorsIn 1584 Eustace Cloville sold his holding to Thomas Marsh (d. 1587), a Star Chamber notary. who held the manors at Pampisford as far back as 1428 from the Abbot of Ely, the original superior. The Victoria County History states \\"the lords [superiors] of the manor were non-resident from the mid 15th to the mid 19th century\\". In his Will, John Killingworth describes Pampisford as his \\"chief mansion\\".Prerogative Court of Canterbury Wills, John Killingworth of Pampisford, proved 21 June 1617 (dated 1 April 1613). The old parish registers for Pampisford record the burial there of \\"John Killingworth, Esquire\\", on 24 May 1617. \\"In a house in Pampisford there are, in the parlour window, Arms for Richard Killingworth [d.1586] and his wife Margaret Beriff, and in one of the main bedrooms are Arms for his son (inscription:) 'John Killingworth Esquire [who] married Beatrice daughter of Robert Alington'. In the same window are another set of Arms for John Killingworth and his second wife Elizabeth Cheyney.Palmer, 1932 It is presumed this was the manor house at that time. Pampisford Hall, the principal manor of the village, was acquired by marriage with the Marsh heiress in the early 18th century by the Parker family.It seems probable that John Killingworth's descendant sold up or died about this time. They also held Balsham Place Manor and other lands in that parish, which a \\"Mr Killingworth\\" still held in 1715, but in 1756 it was for sale. Refer: The Victoria County History of Cambridgeshire, vol. vi, p.129. On the death of William Parker in 1776 the estate was divided for a time between his sisters, Grace and Elizabeth. Grace died in 1781 and her portion passed to Elizabeth, who married William Hamond. On her death in 1789 the whole estate passed to her son William Parker Hamond I who, in 1812, was succeeded by his son William Parker Hamond II. It was he who was responsible for erecting the hall (1820-1831) on farmland belonging to the Manor Farm, and laying out the grounds. During the 1860s the architectural partnership of Messrs Goldie and Child (see George Goldie) was commissioned to extend the Hall and in 1873, following his father's death, William Parker Hamond III continued to develop and extend the pleasure grounds and arboretum for a further twenty years until his death in 1893. In the park is a pinetum, planted with fir trees from Japan, Mexico, China, California, Austria, and the Pyrenees. His successor, Col R T Hamond (a cousin) sold most of the estate, including the park and Hall, to James Binney. He further extended the Hall, adding a new wing and a loggia along the south-west front. The Binney family remain today as the proprietors.https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1000321 The sculptor Antony Gormley lived in a cottage at Pampisford whilst an undergraduate of Trinity College, Cambridge. Parish church Inside the church porch is a simple Norman doorway with a tympanum. The porch contains ten small arches, which are filled with crude carvings that perhaps tell the story of John the Baptist, as evidenced by the block and the head of the figure lying on the floor. There is a modern carving of St John the Baptist with Christ as a finial for the domed cover of the Norman baptismal font. The 650-year-old tower has a tiny spire, and the 15th-century chancel arch opens into a massive arcade in the Transitional style from Norman to Early English. The arch is screened with delicate oak tracery of the same age. There is a chest tomb, possibly that of the founder of the chancel, against the north wall, just at the foot of the steps. It is covered with old English marble. Formerly there were labels around its rims, but they have been lost. There are large shields on the front and on each end of the monument, but no carvings can be seen on them now. In 1742 the monuments inside the church were recorded and included: \\"on the south wall within the rails is a Mural Monument of white marble, with this inscription on a square of black marble in gold letters, which are now scarce[ly] visible: Here lyeth the Bodye of John Killingworth Esquier whoe was twyse married: his former [1st] wife was Beatrix, daughter of Robert Alington of Horseheath, by whome he had two sons and four daughters. The latter [2nd wife] was Elizabeth, daughter of William Cheyney, Esquier, by whom he had three sons and four daughters. He dyed the 23rd of Maye Anno 1617. Aetatis suae 70.\\"Palmer, 1932. In the first south window of the nave are shields for four coats of arms, but the markings on only two of them can be understood, the other two being defaced. One is for the Parker family, who in the mid-18th century are said to be the then Lords of the Manor at Pampisford. Another is the Arms of the earlier Clovill family, superiors at Pampisford after the dissolution of Ely monastery. In the churchyard are two more chest tombs, one of which is made of free-stone with a black marble top for Dr Robert Gell who died in 1665 aged 70.

Currently, seven genes: Pil1, Lsp1 and Sur7, Eis1, Seg1 and Ygr130C, Seg2,Seger S and Philippsen P (2010), Personal Communication to SGD are annotated to the formation of the proteins identified in eisosomes. These organelle-like structures have put to rest the idea that sites of endocytosis in cells are chosen at random. Eisosomes have a profound role in regulating plasma membrane architecture and organization in yeast. Microscopic and genetic analyses link these stable, ultrastructural assemblies to the endocytosis of both lipid and protein cargoes in cells. There are approximately 50‚Äì100 eisosomes in each mature yeast cell distributed uniformly across the cell surface periphery in a characteristic dotted pattern with each eisosome containing approximately 2000‚Äì5000 copies of Pil1 and Lsp1 proteins, as well as, integral membrane protein Sur7. Only a few of the eisosomes present in a cell are active at any one time, suggesting that eisosomes function by using reversible phosphorylation and are regulated portals that govern both location and magnitude of membrane traffic into the cell. Endocytosis in yeast The yeast plasma membrane consists of three compartments: * Membrane compartment containing Can1 (MCC) * Membrane compartment containing Pma1 (MCP) * Membrane compartment containing TORC2 (MCT) The MCC, a furrow in the plasma membrane, is generated by eisosomes, it disappears in a cell lacking Pil1 which is one of the main eisosome components. Structural classification These are large protein complexes composed primarily of subunits of two Bin-Amphiphysin-RVS (BAR) domain containing proteins Pil1 and Lsp1.

HyperCourseware is a prototype electronic educational environment developed in 1990 by Kent Norman at the University of Maryland, College Park, to be used in an electronic classroom called the \\"Teaching Theater.\\" The goal was to rehost electronically all of the things that go into education: the materials, (e.g., textbooks, maps and charts, lesson plans, etc.), the tools (e.g., the blackboard, notebooks, calculators, etc.), and the processes (e.g., lectures, discussions, question and answer, etc.). The objective embraced by HyperCourseware has been quite broad: to provide an integrated and seamless hypermedia infrastructure to support the full range of classroom activities (Norman & Carter, 1992). At the global level, HyperCourseware was organized around educational tools, materials, and objectives rather than around semantic or domain specific knowledge. It is only at the local or content level in the materials that knowledge structure becomes important and is incorporated into the materials by the instructor. Consequently, HyperCourseware was written to host any subject and to support many activities common across courses. These activities range from record keeping and on-line testing to hypermedia presentations and from individual exploration to group collaboration. HyperCoursware uses the conventional objects of classroom instruction and implements them in electronic form in the electronic classroom. Objects such as the course syllabus, the lesson plan, the lecture notes, the class roll, etc. are instantiated in graphic form in a hypermedia database. Furthermore, in HyperCourseware the hypermedia database is used to provide the same sort of natural links between objects as one would expect in the educational materials themselves. For example, the syllabus is a natural navigational mechanism to jump to lectures, readings, and assignments; the classroll is a natural navigational jump to information about students and grades; and the grade list is a natural navigational jump to exams and assignments. It was first written in a HyperCard like language called \\"ObjectPlus\\" that ran on both the Macintosh platform and Windows on a local area network. In 1998 it was rewritten for the World Wide Web using HTML on a WebStar server using FileMaker Pro databases. Currently, it is hosted by an Apple OS X Server and a FileMaker Pro database server.

Despite the name, normally the entire hand moves, and sometimes the entire upper arm. It can also refer to vibrato on some woodwind instruments, achieved by lowering one or more fingers over one of the uncovered holes in a trill-like manner. This flattens the note periodically creating the vibrato. Violin & viola There are two types of violin vibrato: finger, wrist. In finger vibrato, the performer only moves his/her fingers. In wrist vibrato, the performer will move the wrist back and forth while keeping the arm in a resting position. Along with using different bodily movements to create vibrato, there are different methods in regards to forward or backward vibrato movements. Vibrato can be achieved by altering the tone of the note being played. Varying the pitch however, is the most crucial aspect in vibrato. This can be achieved by either altering the note to a higher or lower tone. Moving the finger, wrist, or arm forward or backward primarily determines the tone. In common practice, violin vibrato oscillates on and below a pitch, though dramatic effect may allow for oscillation above as well as below a pitch. Throughout the 20th century, finger vibrato was normally used in playing all members of the violin family unless otherwise indicated. Toward the end of the century, playing without vibrato became a more accepted technique in certain contexts. Guitar In its pure form, vibrato is usually achieved by twisting the wrist rapidly to bend the note slightly, moving to and from the starting pitch. The speed of the vibrato oftentimes has a great effect on the way the note is perceived, with faster vibratos commonly adding tension and stress, while slower vibratos produce a more lyrical sound. The slowest of vibratos can be used to imitate a bowed instrument \\"growing\\" a note after its initial inception. Even though this effect refers to volume in bowed instruments, having a pitch variation that follows the same structure of the volume variation in many situations can have the same effect for the listeners. In contemporary music, finger vibrato is also routinely used by classical guitarists on longer notes, to create an impression of a longer sustain. The technique is also used by jazz bassists to add depth of tone. =Axial pitch- shifting= Axial vibrato is produced by moving a stopped (held-down) string with the left hand in a direction parallel to its axis, which increases or reduces the tension on the string and thereby alters the pitch. This type of vibrato is typically used by classical guitarists (see Classical guitar technique), but can be performed on any kind of guitar, and is frequently used on steel string and electric guitars. When a classical guitarist sees the term vibrato written in a score, this is generally the first effect that comes to mind.Classical Guitar Vibrato Explained =Radial pitch-shifting (string bending)= Example of bending on electric guitar whole tone on electric guitar Radial pitch-shifting (also referred to as \\"string bending\\" or \\"bending\\") is produced by moving the stopped (held-down) string with the fretting hand in a direction perpendicular to its axis and parallel to the frets. This type of pitch-shifting is associated with blues, rock, country and pop music. The effect generally shifts the pitch over a wider range than axial pitch-shifting. It can produce vibrato as a cyclic variation in pitch, a single up-and-down swoop, or as a shift from one pitch to another that is then held. If the strings and action of the guitar are light enough, a player can bend notes by a semitone or more‚Äîso string bending can be a way of making a portamento transition between notes, and not just as a decoration on a note. String bends are one of the few ways to achieve microtonality, especially blue notes, on the guitar.  Basic technique  A guitar bend demonstrated. To produce a bend, the guitarist puts a finger on the string and then, while pressing the string down to the fingerboard, strikes a tone, and pushes or pulls the string to the side. This has the effect of stretching the string and thus makes its pitch higher. Generally a bend on the lower (6th‚Äì4th) strings moves them down vertically, as seen from the guitarist's point of view, and a bend on the higher (3rd‚Äì1st) strings moves them up. The technique can also be used with pinch harmonics to make \\"squealies\\". A backward, reverse or release bend involves pressing the string to the fingerboard, pulling or pushing it up to stretch the string first, then striking the string and relaxing the string to normal position. This causes the note to go flat, the reverse direction of straight bend. Sometimes a guitarist bends a note on a certain string up, while playing the note the string is being bent to on another string, creating a unison bend. Bends of one or two semitones are the most common, but skilled players may use bends from three semitones to as many as five or more semitones, as can be heard in the solo played by David Gilmour on the song \\"Another Brick In the Wall Pt.2\\" from Pink Floyd's album The Wall. In addition to the player's skill, the range of a pitch bend is limited to some extent by the type of guitar, material and string gauge, and area of the neck where the bends are played. For example, steel strings bend further in pitch than nylon strings, thin strings further than thick strings, bends in the middle of the neck further than bends near the nut, etc. In blues playing, the target note can be slightly higher or lower than the fretted note one or two frets higher. It can be a quarter tone or not even exactly that, but a pitch not present in the tempered scale, being a natural third or seventh instead (or close to it). These are the blue notes, one of which is, for example, between the minor and major third of the scale. The exact location varies from performer to performer.  Difficulties  * The most difficult moment for beginners practicing bends is getting the note bent to proper pitch. Usually the bend changes note pitch exactly by one semitone or one whole tone (two semitones), and most beginners fail to bend a string exactly to proper pitch, producing overbends and underbends. Most guitar teachers advise playing the target note on a higher fret, listening closely to its sound and trying to bend the string aiming to get exactly the same pitch. * Bending (especially heavy bending, more than one semitone) usually involves touching more than one string with a left (fretting) hand, as seen in the illustration. * Bending can make strings break or the guitar go out of tune. * Bending, especially wide bending, requires specialized finger strength. It is not uncommon for bending to be awkward or tiring for the hands. However, with proper practice, this subsides. String gauge also plays a big role; typically thicker strings are more difficult to bend. Notable guitarists who used very heavy-gauge strings while still producing musical bends include Stevie Ray Vaughan and Peter Green. =Behind-the-nut pitch-shifting= : Also known as \\"Behind-the-nut bending\\" Press the string between the nut and the machine head (tuning key), and the pitch shifts. Examples include Jimmy Page's unaccompanied solo break in Led Zeppelin's \\"Heartbreaker\\". * Classical guitar (nylon-string): This works on the unwound strings on a classical (nylon-string) guitar, and also works better on the strings whose heads (tuning keys) are further from the nut. * Bass guitar: works on all strings The particular advantage of this technique is that unstopped notes can be pitch-shifted (bent). = Variations = * Several strings can be bent at once. * Innumerable bend patterns exist: for example, straight bending of a string two semitones up, then one semitone down, then one up, then two down. =Sound= When a string is bent, the sound it creates is much smoother than would be otherwise, even using other slurred techniques such as hammer-ons, pull-offs, or finger slides. String bending on the guitar was first used in blues to mimic the smooth sound of a slide guitar. It has since become an integral part of playing lead guitar. Some masters of string bending on guitar include David Gilmour, Tony Iommi, Brian May, T-Bone Walker, B. B. King, and Eric Clapton, as well as many other blues, country, and jazz-influenced guitarists. To facilitate his extensive string bending, Clapton used to substitute an unwound banjo string for the third string on his guitar. At that time, no set of light-gauge strings with an unwound third string was available. Keyboard instruments Finger vibrato is also a standard part of clavichord technique, known as Bebung. Until the first half of the 20th century, the clavichord was the only keyboard instrument on which finger vibrato was possible. In 1928, Maurice Martenot‚Äîinspired by his experience as a cellist‚Äîinvented the Ondes Martenot, which featured a keyboard that the player could rock back and forth laterally. Other finger vibrato techniques may also be used on pressure-sensitive electronic keyboards with appropriate sounds and patches. For example, some Rodgers digital church organs have an optional voice for the upper keyboard that provides a solo trumpet with velocity-sensitive volume and pressure-sensitive pitch, so a skilled player can play a realistic trumpet solo. Some 2010s and 2020s MIDI controllers and synthesizer keyboards have pressure or aftertouch sensors which sense if the player is continuing to press down a key after the initial striking; on some synth module patches (sounds), continued pressure on a key triggers an electronic vibrato effect, in imitation of the expressive vocal, bowed strings, or wind technique of adding vibrato to a held note. On accordion, vibrato-type effects can be produced using movements of the bellows, changes in bellows pressure, or by rocking the fingers on a key. Wind instruments Finger vibrato is used on several woodwind instruments, in both classical and traditional music. In Baroque music, it was called flattement in French and used, usually on long notes, on the Baroque flute and recorder, and noted in the writings of Jacques-Martin Hotteterre and Michel Corrette. In Irish music, it is used on the uillean pipes and pennywhistle. In contemporary terms this technique is more usually referred to as a \\"timbral trill\\".

The project was announced on February 22, 2005. Current plans call for making approximately of the Floyds Fork floodplain in eastern Jefferson County into park space, expanding area in the Jefferson Memorial Forest, and adding riverfront land and wharfs along the Riverwalk Trail and Levee Trail. There are also plans to connect the Louisville trail to a planned seven mile (11 km) trail connecting the Southern Indiana cities of New Albany, Clarksville and Jeffersonville. Louisville Loop The Louisville Loop is a planned bike and pedestrian trail which will circle the city of Louisville, Kentucky when completed, using the trail to connect many of the city's existing parks and future parks. =History= Dedication plaque for the trail, located near the Belvedere The city's first bike path effort, Beargrass Bikeway, which connects Cherokee Park to the Belvedere, was opened in 1980 but received little use. The section connecting the Belvedere to Shawnee Park was first proposed in 1988. Existing sections The Louisville Loop currently extends a total of 30 miles from the Farnsley- Moremen House to Downtown. The first completed section of the Louisville Loop was created in the 1980s and is known as the Riverwalk. It is a bike and jogging trail running along the city's Ohio River waterfront from the Belvedere to Chickasaw Park. It passes through Lannan Park in Portland and Shawnee Park along the way. A portion of the trail runs along city streets Portland, with about of the total route existing on city sidewalks. The trail passes through the former Portland Wharf area, which was razed for I-64 development, and the old street grid is still visible. Along the way, there are mileage markers on the surface of the trail every tenth of a mile, as well as markers giving information on 19th century river culture, such as units of measurement, river jobs, and types of riverboats. The second oldest section of the Louisville Loop is the Levee Trail, which spanning the flood protection from runs from Riverside Park in Pleasure Ridge Park to the Farnsley-Moremen House to Lees Lane. Shively In 2007, the Mill Creek Trail was completed, connecting the Levee Trail and The Riverwalk, ending at Lee Lane in Riverside Gardens. A small stretch of the Mill Creek Trail had been completed in 2002 by LG&E;, on whose property much of the trail is located, which ran from Greenwood Rd. to Mill Creek. An extension added by the city in 2007 included a $2 million bridge over Mill Creek. =Future sections= The total trail length for a completed Louisville Loop is estimated at 110 mile one way. The next sections of the Louisville Loop are slated for completion by 2013 and they will connect the Jefferson Memorial Forest, McNeely Park, Floyds Fork watershed, EP Sawyer State Park, and River Road corridor using the proposed trails: *Jefferson Memorial Forest Trail *Floyds Fork Trail *Eastern Suburbs Trail *River Road/Waterfront Trail Gallery Image:MetroLoopP1653.jpgThe RiverWalk near the vertical liftgate bridge Image:MetroLoopP182.jpgRail crossing for the trail in Rubbertown Image:MetroLoopP184.jpgSection of the trail in West Louisville Image:RiverWalkCausway.jpgThe RiverWalk going under the I-64 Causeway Image:MetroLoopLBT.jpgJunction of the trails leading to Mill Creek bridge and landing Image:PortlandWharf.jpgRiverWalk at the Old Portland Wharf File:1863 Mansion, Portland, Louisville.jpgA Civil War era house off the RiverWalk Image:RiverWalkskyl.jpgLouisville skyline viewed from the RiverWalk See also *List of attractions and events in the Louisville metropolitan area *List of parks in the Louisville metropolitan area *Louisville Waterfront Park *Emerald Necklace, a series of connected parks around Boston References External links * Louisville Loop official site * 21st Century Parks‚ÄîWebsite * The Parklands of Floyds Fork‚ÄîWebsite * Mayor Greg Fischer announced increasing the Tree Canopy over the city by more than 1,500 trees over 10 years‚ÄîLouisville.gov October 24, 2013 * Bridges Progressing At The Parklands of Floyds Fork ‚Äì BrokenSidewalk January 2012 * City of Parks page at LouisvilleKY.gov (includes a map) * Louisville Olmsted Parks Conservancy * Construction begins on Parklands of Floyds Fork ‚Äì August 2010 * Floyds Fork Parks Get $10 Million Boost -- August 2010 * New park system named Parklands of Floyds Fork -- August 2010 * New Property Connects Sections of Jefferson Memorial Forest -- November 2009 (includes a map) Parks in Louisville, Kentucky Tourist attractions in Louisville, Kentucky Projects established in 2005 2005 establishments in Kentucky Proposed parks in the United States ","title":"City of Parks"},{"id":"4320027","text":"Thorpe Culvert railway station serves the village of Thorpe St Peter in Lincolnshire, England.

It is located in the Finnish capital Helsinki, in the district of T√∂√∂l√∂. History In 1923 a competition was held to choose a site for a new parliament house. Arkadianm√§ki, a hill beside what is now Mannerheimintie, was chosen as the best site. The architectural competition which was held in 1924 was won by the firm of Borg‚ÄìSir√©n‚Äì√Öberg with a proposal called Oratoribus (Latin for \\"for the speakers\\"). Johan Sigfrid Sir√©n (1889‚Äì1961), who was mainly responsible for preparing the proposal, was given the task of designing Parliament House. The building was constructed 1926‚Äì1931 and was officially inaugurated on March 7, 1931. Ever since then, and especially during the Winter War and Continuation War, it has been the scene of many key moments in the nation's political life. Architecture and features Exterior wall of the Parliament House. The Corinthian capitals of Parliament House are made of red Kalvola granite. Sir√©n designed Parliament House in a stripped classical architectural style combining Neoclassicism with early twentieth century modernism. Sir√©n's combination of simplified columns and balusters with simplified planar geometry bears comparison to similar explorations by Erik Gunnar Asplund and Jo≈æe Pleƒçnik. The exterior is red Kalvola granite. The fa√ßade is lined by fourteen columns with Corinthian capitals. The building has five floors, each of which is unique. The floors are connected by a white marble staircase and famous paternoster lifts. Most important for visitors are the main lobby, the stately plenary chamber (Session Hall) and the large reception hall (State Hall). Notable later additions to the building are the library annex completed in 1978 and a separate office block, Pikkuparlamentti (), the necessity of which was an object of some controversy, completed in 2004. =First floor= The first floor contains the main lobby, the Speaker's reception rooms, the newspaper room, the information service, the documents office, the messenger centre, the copying room, the restaurant, and some separate function rooms. At both ends of the lobby are marble staircases leading up to the fifth floor. =Second floor= The second floor, also known as the main floor, is centered on the plenary chamber. Its galleries have seats for the public, the press, and diplomats. Also located on this floor are the reception hall (the Hall of State), the Speaker's Corridor, the Government Corridor, the cafeteria, and adjacent function rooms. =Third floor= The third floor includes facilities for the information unit and the media, and provides direct access to the press gallery of the plenary chamber. The Minutes Office and a number of committee rooms are also located here. =Fourth floor= The fourth floor is reserved for committees. Its largest rooms are the Grand Committee room and the Finance Committee room. =Fifth floor= The fifth floor contains meeting rooms and offices for the parliamentary groups. Additional offices for the parliamentary groups are located on the sixth floor, along with additional facilities for the media. Sightseeing Guided tours are arranged on Saturdays at 11:00 and 12:30 and on Sundays at 12:00 and 13:30; in July and August also at 14:00 on weekdays. On Tuesdays and Fridays, one can watch the Parliament in session from the public balcony.

Significant variations exist between the species. For example, some are medium sized and bright orange above, but mottled gray or brown below. This underwing coloration helps them resemble a dead leaf when they are at rest, as they keep their wings closed. With relatively few exceptions, the hindwings of the members of this subfamily have jagged edges. Adults are very robust and fast flyers, and many are strongly attracted to drink liquids from carrion, dung, and rotten fruits, rather than nectar from flowers. Males establish territories and perch on tree trunks, branches, and even the ground. The eggs are smooth and round and generally with a somewhat concave apex.

The closed integral is carried out along a thermodynamic process path from the initial/final state to the same initial/final state. In principal, the closed integral can start and end at an arbitrary point along the path. If there are multiple reservoirs with different temperatures left(T_1,T_2, cdots T_nright), then Clausius inequality reads: :oint left(frac{delta Q_1}{T_1}+frac{delta Q_2}{T_2}+cdots+frac{delta Q_n}{T_n}right) leq 0. In the special case of a reversible process, the equality holds.Clausius theorem at Wolfram Research The reversible case is used to introduce the state function known as entropy. This is because in a cyclic process the variation of a state function is zero. In other words, the Clausius statement states that it is impossible to construct a device whose sole effect is the transfer of heat from a cool reservoir to a hot reservoir.Finn, Colin B. P.

History The Clausius theorem is a mathematical explanation of the second law of thermodynamics. It was developed by Rudolf Clausius who intended to explain the relationship between the heat flow in a system and the entropy of the system and its surroundings. Clausius developed this in his efforts to explain entropy and define it quantitatively. In more direct terms, the theorem gives us a way to determine if a cyclical process is reversible or irreversible. The Clausius theorem provides a quantitative formula for understanding the second law. Clausius was one of the first to work on the idea of entropy and is even responsible for giving it that name. What is now known as the Clausius theorem was first published in 1862 in Clausius' sixth memoir, \\"On the Application of the Theorem of the Equivalence of Transformations to Interior Work\\". Clausius sought to show a proportional relationship between entropy and the energy flow by heating (Œ¥Q) into a system. In a system, this heat energy can be transformed into work, and work can be transformed into heat through a cyclical process. Clausius writes that \\"The algebraic sum of all the transformations occurring in a cyclical process can only be less than zero, or, as an extreme case, equal to nothing.\\" In other words, the equation :oint frac{delta Q}{T} = 0 with ùõøQ being energy flow into the system due to heating and T being absolute temperature of the body when that energy is absorbed, is found to be true for any process that is cyclical and reversible. Clausius then took this a step further and determined that the following relation must be found true for any cyclical process that is possible, reversible or not. This relation is the \\"Clausius inequality\\". :oint frac{delta Q}{T_{surr}} leq 0 Now that this is known, there must be a relation developed between the Clausius inequality and entropy. The amount of entropy S added to the system during the cycle is defined as :Delta S oint frac{delta Q}{T} It has been determined, as stated in the second law of thermodynamics, that the entropy is a state function: It depends only upon the state that the system is in, and not what path the system took to get there. This is in contrast to the amount of energy added as heat (ùõøQ) and as work (ùõøW), which may vary depending on the path. In a cyclic process, therefore, the entropy of the system at the beginning of the cycle must equal the entropy at the end of the cycle, Delta S=0, regardless of whether the process is reversible or irreversible. In the irreversible case, entropy will be created in the system, and more entropy must be extracted than was added (Delta S_{surr}>0) in order to return the system to its original state. In the reversible case, no entropy is created and the amount of entropy added is equal to the amount extracted. If the amount of energy added by heating can be measured during the process, and the temperature can be measured during the process, the Clausius inequality can be used to determine whether the process is reversible or irreversible by carrying out the integration in the Clausius inequality. Proof The temperature that enters in the denominator of the integrand in the Clausius inequality is actually the temperature of the external reservoir with which the system exchanges heat. At each instant of the process, the system is in contact with an external reservoir. Because of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, in each infinitesimal heat exchange process between the system and the reservoir, the net change in entropy of the \\"universe\\", so to say, is dS_{Total}=dS_{Sys} +dS_{Res} geq 0 . When the system takes in heat by an infinitesimal amount delta Q_{1}(geq 0), for the net change in entropy dS_{Total_{1}} in this step to be positive, the temperature of the \\"hot\\" reservoir T_{Hot} needs to be slightly greater than the temperature of the system at that instant. If the temperature of the system is given by T_{1} at that instant, then dS_{Sys_{1}}=frac{delta Q_{1}}{T_{1}}, and T_{Hot}geq T_{1} forces us to have: : -dS_{Res_{1}} =frac{delta Q_{1}}{T_{Hot}}leq frac{delta Q_{1}}{T_{1}} = dS_{Sys_{1}} This means the magnitude of the entropy \\"loss\\" from the reservoir, dS_{Res_{1}}=frac{delta Q_{1}}{T_{Hot}} is less than the magnitude of the entropy gain dS_{Sys_{1}}(geq 0) by the system: Similarly, when the system at temperature T_{2} expels heat in magnitude -delta Q_{2} (delta Q_{2}leq 0) into a colder reservoir (at temperature T_{Cold}leq T_{2}) in an infinitesimal step, then again, for the Second Law of Thermodynamics to hold, one would have, in an exactly similar manner: : -dS_{Res_{2}}=frac{delta Q_{2}}{T_{Cold}}leq frac{delta Q_{2}}{T_{2}}= dS_{Sys_{2}} Here, the amount of heat 'absorbed' by the system is given by delta Q_{2}(leq 0), signifying that heat is transferring from the system to the reservoir, with dS_{Sys_{2}}leq 0. The magnitude of the entropy gained by the reservoir, dS_{Res_{2}}=frac{delta Q_{2}}{T_{cold}} is greater than the magnitude of the entropy loss of the system dS_{Sys_{2}} Since the total change in entropy for the system is 0 in a cyclic process, if one adds all the infinitesimal steps of heat intake and heat expulsion from the reservoir, signified by the previous two equations, with the temperature of the reservoir at each instant given by T_{surr}, one gets, : -oint dS_{Res}= oint frac{delta Q}{T_{surr}}leq oint dS_{Sys}=0 In particular, :oint frac{delta Q}{T_{surr}}leq 0, which was to be proven. In summary, (the inequality in the third statement below, being obviously guaranteed by the second law of thermodynamics, which is the basis of our calculation), :oint dS_{Res}geq 0 :oint dS_{Sys}=0 (as hypothesized) :oint dS_{Total}=oint dS_{Res}+oint dS_{Sys}geq 0 For a reversible cyclic process, there is no generation of entropy in each of the infinitesimal heat transfer processes, so the following equality holds, :oint frac{delta Q_{rev}}{T}=0. Thus, the Clausius inequality is a consequence of applying the second law of thermodynamics at each infinitesimal stage of heat transfer, and is thus in a sense a weaker condition than the Second Law itself.

Robots must infiltrate the mystery-ship (dubbed the \\"Omega\\") and deactivate it within the hour or Earth will be destroyed. Gameplay involves a mixture of arcade adventure, maze game and strategy. The player controls robots (which are designed, built and named in- game) around the interior of the Omega and must shut down its four reactors. These robots have a limited amount of artificial intelligence and can be programmed to take set routes or allowed to explore of their own accord. The player can also directly control the robots. Occasionally, simple puzzles (often involving setting levers correctly) must be solved or hostile robots aboard the Omega must be combatted. The player has one hour in real-time to deactivate Omega's four reactors. Critical reception CRASH magazine found Mission Omega to be \\"an interesting, difficult but colourful and enjoyable hybrid game that should appeal to equally to strategy and arcade fans.\\" However, the instructions printed on the cassette inlay were criticized for being contradictory and lacking keyboard controls.

Starring the actor and comedian Jonathan Watson, the show features impressions of some of Scottish football's great characters such as Denis Law, Tommy Burns, Barry Ferguson, Sir Alex Ferguson, Frank McAvennie, Walter Smith and Graeme Souness, as well as caricatures of the \\"stereotypical\\" Old Firm fan.  History  Only an Excuse? was first broadcast as a one-off special on BBC Radio Scotland, prior to the 1987 Scottish Cup Final. It was a parody of the five-part BBC Scotland television documentary Only a Game?,\\"Scotzine.com ‚Äì The Home of Scottish Football\\" which had aired in Scotland prior to the 1986 World Cup Finals and comprehensively documented the history of Scottish football. The documentary was narrated by Scottish novelist William McIlvanney, whose distinctive voice was expertly mimicked by Jonathan Watson for the radio spoof. After further occasional radio specials including Only Another Excuse?, A Tale of Two Seasons and Only a World Cup Excuse, all of which were released on cassette by BBC Scotland, the show switched to television in 1993, retaining its original double act of Rangers fan Watson and Celtic fan Tony Roper. The first episode replaced Rikki Fulton's long-running annual comedy sketch show Scotch and Wry in the Hogmanay television schedules. By 2019, 32 episodes had been aired. The show has also been performed at the theatre, with the most recent performance of Only An Excuse? taking place at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall in September 2004. The scripts of the early theatre shows, written by Philip Differ, were published in the book Only an Excuse?: The Scripts by Mainstream Publishing in 1995.  Spin-offs  Jonathan Watson appeared in a spin-off called Only a Wee Excuse on Tam Cowan's weekly Offside programme. Up until the last series, Watson's slot was a scaled-down version of the full show, but from the last series onward saw Watson appearing in the studio without costume to perform his impersonations (as in his theatre performances). Another noticeable difference is that Watson starts each segment in his own voice and sets the context and then ends again in his own voice saying, \\"And that Tam was the week that wisnae.\\" Watson appeared in a sketch in the BBC's Children in Need 2008 telethon as Alex Ferguson being interviewed by Adrian Chiles.

The film focuses on the troubles of Lead Belly's youth in the segregated South including his time in prison, and his efforts to use his music to gain release. Plot Huddie Ledbetter leaves his father's house just barely into his twenties and arrives at a brothel on Fannin' Street ran by Miss Eula, who nicknames him Leadbelly and has him play at the bar. For a while, she takes care of him until the police arrive, breaking up a party. Leadbelly and an old man escape via a train and Leadbelly buys a twelve-string acoustic guitar from the old man. Seeking work, he takes a job picking cotton. He soon leaves on a train to Silver City where he meets Blind Lemon and they start playing shows together. At one show, a drunken man tells Leadbelly to keep playing, and threatens him. Leadbelly responds by smashing his guitar onto him and is arrested. He escapes from jail and leads a normal life until he and a drunken friend are playing around with a gun, and Leadbelly accidentally shoots him. He is thrown in prison where he is forced to work in a chain gang. When he tries to escape, he is caught and put in a box. His father arrives and tries to bail Leadbelly out, but fails. Before leaving, he manages to convince the warden to get Leadbelly a twelve-string acoustic guitar. After getting the new guitar, he plays a song for Governor Pat Neff who reassures Leadbelly he will be set free. After he leaves prison, he returns to Fannin Street, sees it has lost its former glory, and he is reunited with Miss Eula. He returns to his father's home only to find that a new family lives there. A group of men attack Leadbelly and slash his throat. Leadbelly happens to stab and kill a man in self-defense but is thrown back in prison. John and Alan Lomax visit the prison and interview Leadbelly, having him play all his songs for them. After he finishes telling his life story, they tell him they will see what they can do about getting him out of prison.

Dutton was born in Wallingford, Connecticut on May 15, 1841. He graduated from Yale College in 1860 and took postgraduate courses there until 1862, when he enlisted in the 21st Connecticut Volunteer Infantry; he fought at Fredericksburg, Suffolk, Nashville and Petersburg. In 1875, he began work as a geologist for John Wesley Powell ‚Äì and eventually the U.S. Geological Survey. Working chiefly in the Colorado Plateau region, he wrote several classic papers, including geological studies of the high plateaus of Utah (1879‚Äì80), the Cenozoic history of the Grand Canyon district (1882), and the Charleston, South Carolina, earthquake of 1886. As head of the division of volcanic geology at the USGS, he studied volcanism in Hawaii, California, and Oregon; his studies of basaltic lava flows in Hawaii led him to introduce the native Hawaiian language terms \\" ªa ªƒÅ\\" and \\"pƒÅhoehoe\\" for cool, clinkery lava flows and smooth, billowy lava flows respectively. He helped coordinate the scientific response to a large earthquake in the Mexican state of Sonora in 1887. He was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1884. In 1886, Dutton led a USGS party to Crater Lake, Oregon. His team carried a half-ton survey boat, the Cleetwood, up the steep mountain slope and lowered it into the lake. From the Cleetwood, Dutton used piano wire with lead weights to measure the depth of the lake at 168 different points. The survey team determined the lake was deep. The currently-accepted maximum depth figure, measured by sonar, is 1,943 feet (592 m).Facts and Figures about Crater Lake In a footnote to an 1882 review in the American Journal of Science, Dutton coined the term \\"isostasy\\". He later stated: ' ' In an unpublished paper I have used the terms isostatic and isostacy (sic) to express that condition of the terrestrial surface which would follow from the flotation of the crust upon a liquid or highly plastic substratum; ‚Äî different portions of the crust being of unequal density' ' } Thus he realised that there is a general balance within the Earth's crust, with lighter weight blocks coming to stand higher than adjacent blocks with higher density, an idea first expressed by Pratt and Airy in the 1850s. Dutton elaborated these ideas in his address to the Philosophical Society of Washington in 1889. When this was printed in 1892 the term isostasy was formally proposed, Dutton having, on the advice of Greek scholars, changed the ‚Äòc‚Äô to an ‚Äòs‚Äô. Dutton was a close associate of John Wesley Powell, G.K. Gilbert, and William Henry Holmes at the USGS. He was an energetic and effective field geologist: in 1875-1877 Dutton's field party mapped of the high plateaus of southern Utah, an area of rugged topography and poor access. Dutton had a distinctive flair for literary description, and is best remembered today for his colorful (and sometimes flamboyant) descriptions of the geology and scenery of the Grand Canyon region of Arizona. \\"Dutton first taught the world to look at that country and see it as it was... Dutton is almost as much the genius loci of the Grand Canyon as Muir is of Yosemite\\" -- Wallace Stegner, Beyond the Hundredth Meridian. In 1891 he retired from the USGS to serve as commander of the arsenal of San Antonio, Texas; then as ordnance officer of the department of Texas. After retiring from the Army in 1901, he returned to the study of geology. Dutton spent his last years at the home of his son in Englewood, New Jersey.

The station is now owned by Network Rail and managed by East Midlands Railway who provide all rail services which run to and from Nottingham. History The line to Wainfleet was opened in August 1873 by the Wainfleet and Firsby Railway. This line was then extended to Skegness; the station opened on 28 July 1873. Statue of the Jolly Fisherman Skegness was dubbed \\"the Blackpool of the East Coast\\" or \\"Nottingham by the Sea\\", and has a mascot, the Jolly Fisherman (designed by John Hassall in 1908 for the Great Northern Railway), and a slogan - Skegness is so bracing - a reference to the chilly prevailing north-easterly winds that can and frequently do blow off the North Sea. A statue of The Jolly Fisherman now greets passengers as they arrive at the station when entering through the main entrance. Up until 1966 the railway station used to have a goods yard with sheds, however this area along with platform one was demolished between 1980 and 1983. This area is now used as a car park belonging to nearby offices. There was a Seacroft railway station located just outside Skegness but this has also now closed. The next station on the line is Havenhouse. In 2006, all locomotive hauled services to Skegness were halted due to the weight of the locos buckling the rails frequently. However this ban has since been lifted after Network Rail began a track renewal scheme which is now entering the final phase. =Station Masters= *George Tuckerman 1881 - 1899 *George Henry Dales 1900 - 1906 (afterwards stationmaster at Horncastle) *George Chambers 1906 - 1921 *William Mountain 1921 - 1929 *Herbert Joseph Osborn 1930 - 1943 *W.E.

There is also a return service from Derby to Skegness using a High Speed Train on summer Saturdays and Bank Holidays On summer Sundays some services start and terminate at Mansfield Woodhouse. In the winter a limited service (four departures per day, all after midday) operates. Present day The current station has toilet facilities with a baby change and a specialist service for the disabled, and a small refreshment/newsagent stall. There is 24-hour CCTV in operation at this station and there are staff patrolling the concourse area to give information when trains are due to arrive or depart. There is also a ticket office, staffed for part of the traffic day, and a self-service ticket vending machine (TVM) has been installed; this also enables customers who have booked their tickets online to collect them outside office hours. Six platforms remain in place (numbered 2 to 7), however platforms 2 and 7 are now out of use and in practice only two platforms (3 and 4) are used regularly. Remodelling 2011 Network Rail and Lincolnshire County Council announced a major renovation programme costing ¬£290,000, which has seen the derelict buildings demolished, the customer toilets being modernised and the gents relocated. There was much debate in Skegness about the old stationmaster's house being part of Skegness' heritage and should have been refurbished rather than demolished. Local transport connections Skegness railway station has good links to local public transport with a taxi rank at the front of the station. Adjacent to the railway station is the town's bus station which has services in all directions, including frequent buses up the coast as far as Mablethorpe, Louth and Alford all year round.

Croft started as a left-back, but also filled in as a makeshift right back in John McDermott's absence, as well as also being known to cover central midfield, left midfield, right midfield and even as a support striker. Croft became an integral part of the Blundell Park setup and was one of a number of successful professional footballers in the mid nineties who came from the club, others included the likes of Jack Lester, Danny Butterfield and John Oster. His performances in the second tier of English football had attracted interest for a number of Premier League teams. His versatility and composure on the ball led to interest from Blackburn Rovers in 1996 who had won the Premier League title in the previous season. =Blackburn Rovers= Croft transferred to Blackburn for ¬£1.6 million in 1996, brought to the club by Ray Harford, but although not usually a regular for the Rovers he would feature more under Roy Hodgson.

The pilots' amphetamine usage was also covered by the BBC and the New York Times. =Afghan Massacre: The Convoy of Death (2002)= Interviewees presented as eyewitnesses state that several thousand Taliban prisoners of war were transported to Sheberghan prison in sealed containers and that hundreds or thousands of prisoners died. Afghans interviewed in the film claim that U.S. personnel were present and involved in mass killings. A short preliminary version of the documentary was shown to the European Parliament and the German Parliament in June 2002, under the title Massacre at Mazar, prompting calls for investigations from human rights bodies. The Pentagon denied allegations of U.S. involvement and released a statement, saying \\"U.S. Central Command looked into it a few months ago, when allegations first surfaced when there were graves discovered in the area of Sherberghan prison. They looked into it and did not substantiate any knowledge, presence or participation of US service members.\\" An August 2002 report in Newsweek, based on a UN memo, described a mass grave site in the Dasht-i-Leili desert, but said there was no evidence that U.S. personnel had been involved.

It is a monoterpenoid that contains a thiol (also known as a mercaptan) functional group. Structurally a hydroxy group of terpineol is replaced by the thiol in grapefruit mercaptan, so it also called thioterpineol. Volatile thiols typically have very strong, often unpleasant odors that can be detected by humans in very low concentrations. Grapefruit mercaptan has a very potent, but not unpleasant, odor, and it is the chemical constituent primarily responsible for the aroma of grapefruit. This characteristic aroma is a property of only the R enantiomer. Pure grapefruit mercaptan, or citrus-derived oils rich in grapefruit mercaptan, are sometimes used in perfumery and the flavor industry to impart citrus aromas and flavors. However, both industries actively seek substitutes for grapefruit mercaptans for use as a grapefruit flavorant, since its decomposition products are often highly disagreeable to the human sense of smell. The detection threshold for the (+)-(R) enantiomer of grapefruit mercaptan is 2√ó10‚àí5 ppb, or equivalently a concentration of 2√ó10‚àí14. This corresponds to being able to detect 2√ó10‚àí5 mg in one metric ton of water - one of the lowest detection thresholds ever recorded for a naturally occurring compound.

An OEM partner was Northern Telecom. According to information on display in 2005 at the NSA's National Cryptologic Museum, the STU-II was in use from the 1980s to the present. It uses the linear predictive coding algorithm LPC-10 at 2.4 kilobits/second to digitize voice, and the \\"Key Distribution Center\\" (KDC) for key management. The display also stated that the STU-II B is the standard narrow band secure telephone. STU-II replaced the STU-I, KY-3 and the Navajo I. The last was a secure telephone in a briefcase, of which 110 were built in the 1980s for use by senior government officials when traveling. The Navaho I also used LPC-10. Some 10 000 STU-II units were produced. STU-II cabinet with desk set on top.

A. Salvatore. It is the first book in his series Legacy of the Drow. Plot summary The Legacy continues the plot-line of The Icewind Dale Trilogy, with Wulfgar and Catti- brie preparing for their marriage and Drizzt returning from the first of many visits to Lady Alustriel of Silverymoon. Drizzt returns to a disturbed Catti- brie and eccentric Regis, who has returned to Mithral Hall after a stint as master of Pasha Pook's thieves' guild. While Bruenor plans the wedding, Wulfgar's tribe settles the appropriately named Settlestone and begins to prosper. Wulfgar, on the other hand, is straining his relationship with Catti- brie, who feels his possessiveness is excessive and unwise. When Wulfgar unexpectedly attacks Drizzt and appears to have lethal motives, the tension builds, despite the drow's diffusion of the situation. Newly introduced is the dwarf battlerager, Thibbledorf Pwent. The dwarf, knocked unconscious during the invasion of Mithral Hall, pledges fealty to Bruenor. Among his personality quirks are a disgusting smell, and ungreased, ridged armor, which also serves as Pwent's primary weapon. Meanwhile, in Menzoberranzan, Drizzt's sister Vierna (Taken in by Matron Baenre after the fall of House Do'Urden) is preparing to recapture her brother. Vierna believes that this quest, if successful, will gain her the full favor of Lolth, the chief drow goddess. Vierna enlists the help of Bregan D'aerthe, the most prominent mercenary band in Menzoberranzan. Jarlaxle, Bregan D'aerthe's leader, briefly doubts Vierna's sanity and designs, but is convinced when Vierna turns her brother Dinin into a drider. The story returns to Mithral Hall, with Bruenor preparing a detachment to investigate a goblin disturbance in Mithral Hall's unexplored lower tunnels. After the goblins are routed, tension builds between Wulfgar and Catti-brie. Wulfgar had wanted his fianc√©e to stay out of the fight, for reasons that didn't satisfy the woman. A patrol goes missing soon afterward, and Drizzt prepares to investigate. Oddly, Bruenor suggests that Regis accompany the drow. Drizzt, with a few second thoughts, allows the halfling to join him. The pair discover the patrol, slaughtered; Drizzt identifies the murderers as dark elves and leads a pursuit. After the battle with the drow, Drizzt questions Regis on his new-found combat abilities, and discovers that the halfling is actually Artemis Entreri, wearing a familiar magical mask. Drizzt had previously used the item to pass as a surface elf, and had not realized its capabilities. Entreri then turns Drizzt over to the dark elves, who escape to the Underdark. Entreri then challenges Drizzt, attempting to settle their feud from The Halfling's Gem. Apparently, this was Entreri's price in the operation to recover the wayward drow. The assassin is informed that he cannot kill Drizzt in the duel, because Vierna intends to sacrifice her brother to Lolth. Meanwhile, Bruenor and Wulfgar realize Regis' deception and manipulation: Bruenor was charmed to allow Regis to follow the ranger on his expedition; and Wulfgar was persuaded that Drizzt had kissed Catti-brie. Catti-brie, Bruenor, and Wulfgar, together with Cobble (Mithral Hall's High Priest) and Pwent, move to rescue Drizzt. The duel between Drizzt and Entreri begins slowly, Drizzt not wanting to give the assassin satisfaction. Entreri counters by successfully taunting the drow with the whereabouts and well-being of Regis. Jarlaxle and Vierna are impressed with the battle, allowing it to continue until Wulfgar and company arrive. In the mele√©, Vierna crushes Cobble beneath a steel wall and Drizzt escapes, but violates his vow to never take a dark elf's life. The moral struggle inherently ends with a repudiation of the vow, if necessary to save the lives of those for whom Drizzt cares. Bruenor and his entourage also escape, and Entreri asks for an opportunity to pursue his nemesis. He kills his appointed escorts when alone and fails to find a hidden Drizzt. Drizzt's friends are also searching for him, as are Vierna and Bregan D'aerthe. The parties of Bruenor and Vierna collide, with another raucous combat. Bruenor attacks the Drider Dinin. Pwent is separated from the group, falling down a pit after overcoming dark elf poison. Vierna summons a Yochlol, a demonic handmaiden of Lolth, which attacks Wulfgar, then wraps a tentacle around Cattie-brie's leg. Wulfgar, desperate, repeatedly strikes the chambers ceiling with his hammer, causing a collapse that kills both Wulfgar and the Yochlol. Reception The Legacy, TSR's first hardcover novel, leapt to the top of The New York Times bestseller list within weeks of its release.

It was founded in 2001 by Mitchell Miller and Johnny Rodger. Although its title is Scots (Eng: The Thirst) the magazine is published mostly in Scottish Standard English though features and fiction do regularly appear in languages such as French, Italian, Spanish, Broad Scots and Scottish Gaelic. The Drouth is unusual for a Scottish literary magazine in that it only infrequently publishes poetry, arguing that as poetry covers a good portion of other magazines‚Äô content, its efforts are better focused on other art-forms less well represented in Scotland's 'small mags'. The magazine works on a commissioning basis, and does not encourage unsolicited submissions. It has a particular focus on literature, film and politics but also covers visual art, music, architecture, photography and comix, as well as giving generous space to creative fiction. The magazine sponsors a number of cultural events, mostly in Glasgow. Every issue also features a guest editor (usually someone of distinction in a given field) and guest cover artist. Editorial stance The Drouth's editorial stance could be described as non-aligned left with occasional anarchistic and libertarian overtones as shown by its ties to radical online publications such as Pulse and Spinwatch, and with the author James Kelman. Nevertheless, it also publishes work by more establishment figures on the left and right of the political spectrum, and editorial board members such as Owen Dudley Edwards retain links to the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru. The magazine is a frequent critic of the Scottish Labour Party but maintains it follows no party alignment and is uncommitted on the issue of Scottish independence. In general, the magazine has taken an aggressively non-institutional stance and has found common cause with magazines such as Variant, though it retains an independent approach on political issues and does not maintain formal links with major organisations and institutions. Its editorial board is nevertheless, drawn from a mainly institutional background across the two major Scottish cities and currently consists of; *David Archibald, Lecturer, Dept of Film Theatre and Television The University of Glasgow (2006‚Äìpresent) *Gerard Carruthers, Head of Dept of Scottish Literature, The University of Glasgow (2001‚Äìpresent) *Steve Davismoon, Composer and lecturer at Napier University, Edinburgh (2003‚Äìpresent) *Owen Dudley Edwards, Reader in History, The University of Edinburgh (2001‚Äìpresent) *Dorian Grieve, Editor and Researcher in Linguistics, University of Glasgow (2004‚Äìpresent) *Simon Kovesi, Head of English and Modern Languages, Oxford Brookes University (2009‚Äìpresent) *Emily Munro, Head of Learning, Glasgow Film Theatre (2008‚Äìpresent) *Ruaridh Nicoll, Journalist and novelist (2004‚Äìpresent) *Miriam Ross, Researcher in film and related studies (also web editor) (2010) *Elke Weissmann, Lecturer, Liverpool Edgehill University Editorial board members primarily offer advice, but can also commission work, initiate ideas for issues and get involved in production.

A. Salvatore, set in his world of Corona, shared with his Demon Wars Saga. The Highwayman tells the story of a young crippled boy named Bransen Garibond. The orphaned son of the Jhesta Tu mystic Sen Wi and the Abellican priest Brother Dynard, he eventually is able to move normally by learning to center his body to become the hero known as the Highwayman. Plot Pryd Holding, where much of the story is set, is troubled by the threat of powrie dwarves, domination by other kingdoms and religious conflicts between the brutal Samhaists, led by the cruel and evil Bernivvigar and the seemingly more benevolent brothers of Blessed Abelle, to which Brother Bran Dynard belongs. Also complicating matters is that Prince Prydae, the last of his line, suffers an injury in battle that leaves him impotent. Brother Dynard has recently returned from the south, where he was sent to enlighten the people, but instead became fascinated and enlightened by the people, and took a wife, the beautiful Jhesta Tu mystic Sen Wi. Sen Wi has come to Pryd holding with Dynard to help explain the ways of her people to the brothers of Blessed Abelle. One night, a beautiful young woman, Callen Duwornay, is sentenced to death for adultery. Forced to endure sexual humiliation as part of her punishment, she is stripped completely naked in front of the community, is bitten by a poison snake and then left for dead, hung over the road that is being constructed to connect Pryd Holding with the other kingdoms as a warning to others. Sen Wi and Dynard find her hanging naked and rescue her from the dwarves that are beating her. Sen Wi uses her training to heal Callen and they take her to Dynard's friend, Garibond, to heal. After recovering, an apparently still naked Callen leaves Garibonds home and disappears. Some time later, after changing her name, Callen gives birth to a daughter, whom she names Cadayale. Brother Dynard and Sen Wi go before the brothers of Abelle, but they are appalled to find that he was \\"enlightened\\" by the \\"beasts of Behr\\" rather than enlightening them as he was supposed to. Additionally, the brothers refuse to recognize Sen Wi as his wife, referring to her instead dismissively as his concubine. Sen Wi realizes that she is pregnant and that her baby is suffering within her due to her having taken the poison and pain from Callen into herself. Sen Wi later dies giving birth in Garibond's home, using the last of her strength to save her son, whom Garibond names Bransen, combining his parents name. Dynard himself is later killed by a dwarf on the highway when he is sent to see the higher order of Abelle. Adopted by Garibond, Bransen is a constant source of ridicule, mockery and abuse in the town by local bullies due to his disfigurement, shown kindness only by Cadayale, daughter of Callen. With old age overtaking him and suffering a terrible injury to himself due to the cruel machinations of Bernivvigar, who wishes to sacrifice Bransen, Garibond makes a deal with the brothers of Abelle to take in Bransen should he die. Garibond himself is later burned to death for heresy and for harboring the Book of Jhest, written by Dynard. After this, Bransen is taken in by the monks, but most of them treat him cruelly as well. Bransen utilizes both sides of his heritage in the novel to overcome his crippled state and become the Highwayman. With help from a soul stone, the hematite, combined with his knowledge of The Book of Jhest, Bransen overcomes his physically weak form by centering his chi, which greatly increases his mobility. With his newfound ability, he rescues Cadayale from the bullies who wished to rape and beat her for helping him, killing the lead bully, Tarkus Breen. After weeks of robbing from the tax collectors to give back to the poor, becoming a local Robin Hood, Bransen risks everything to rescue Cadayale and Callen from Bernivvigar and Prydae, who sought to rape Cadayale to beget an heir, leading to the deaths of both men. Afterward, Bransen, Cadayale and Callen are banished from Pryd Holding by Bannagran, Prydae's closest friend and temporary ruler. With hope in their hearts, the three depart for the south to seek a better life. In 2007, Matthew Hansen of Marvel Comics/Dabel Brothers Productions adapted The Highwayman to a comic book.

Goodman was the fourth of six children, and she began singing in church as a child. Raised inside the Church of God, her original intent was to study for the Metropolitan Opera, but being raised in church she felt compelled to sing gospel music. She married Howard Goodman, a preacher nine years her senior, on November 7, 1949. They had a son Rick, and a daughter Vicki. They pastored churches and sang for congregations across the country. Along with Howard's two brothers Sam and Rusty, they became known as The Happy Goodman Family, helping pave the way for Southern gospel music during the 1960s. With the formation of Word Records in the early 1960s, Vestal and The Happy Goodman Family were the flagship artists signed to the company. In 1969, she won the first ever Female Vocalist of the Year Dove Award. As a natural step in her career, Vestal Goodman released her first solo album, \\"Hallelujah!\\" in 1971, from which came the well-known single, \\"It'll All Be Over But the Shoutin'\\". Her autobiography, Vestal! 'Lord I Wouldn't Take Nothin' For My Journey Now', was published in 1999. It details her life in Southern gospel music, her heart problems, her subsequent bout with cancer and her struggle with prescription drug addiction. The Happy Goodmans won multiple Grammy and Dove awards, charted 15 No. 1 hit songs including \\"I Wouldn't Take Nothin' For My Journey Now,\\" and performed more than 3,500 concerts, including performing at the White House for President Jimmy Carter in 1979. Goodman was honored by being named \\"The Queen of Southern Gospel Music\\", which was proclaimed in a wide array of magazines, from Rolling Stone, Billboard Magazine, Time, People, and The Singing News. She was also known for her trademark handkerchief, which she held in her hand during virtually every performance, sometimes waving it over her head.

A. Salvatore. The series is set in the world of Corona, principally in the kingdoms of Honce-the-Bear and Behren, and amongst the nomadic To-gai-ru. The saga is separated into two trilogies bridged by a single book, Mortalis. The saga has an accompanying roleplaying game, entitled Demon Wars. The first trilogy =The Demon Awakens= The first book in the trilogy introduces the reader to Elbryan Wyndon and Jilseponie Ault, two young friends whose lives are irrevocably changed by the destruction of their village of Dundalis, and Avelyn Desbris, a pious young man who enters the monastery of St.-Mere-Abelle in order to study and to serve God. Divided by the catastrophe, Elbryan and Pony (Jilseponie's nickname) struggle to sort out their lives. Elbryan is taken in by the Touel'alfar, the winged elves of Corona. Jilseponie makes her way to the city of Palmaris where she is raised by the Chilichunks, a husband and wife who own a tavern in the city. Meanwhile, Avelyn comes to terms with the all-too-human brothers of the Abellican Church and the myriad injustices he witnesses them cause. Years pass before the trio meet. During their time apart Elbryan is trained by the Touel'alfar as a ranger and takes on the name Nightbird. Meanwhile, Pony becomes a barmaid at the Chilichunk's tavern, Fellowship Way and eventually enters into the military after marrying the nobleman Conner Bildeborough and then rejecting him on their wedding night; the marriage is immediately annulled. Avelyn, a promising young monk at St. Mere-Abelle begins learning the use of the powerful gemstone magic, but eventually leaves the Church after finding it to not be the holy place he had hoped for and receiving a vision of the awakened demon dactyl. It will be up to these three, along with a group of friends and allies, to save the world from the demon dactyl, Bestesbulzibar, and his dark force of goblins, powries and fomorian giants. In order to accomplish this feat Elbryan and his friends take the people of the Timberlands, whose homes have been destroyed by the demon's army, and forge them into a guerrilla fighting force. With them, Elbryan Wyndon and his friends strike quickly at the edges of the enemy, doing all in their power to weaken them. However, it quickly becomes apparent that the only way to truly stop the encroaching darkness is to defeat the dactyl itself. Intent on this quest, the three friends, accompanied by the elves Belli'mar Juraviel and Tuntun and others, journey to the Barbican and Mount Aida to face their enemy. In the end the demon is defeated by Avelyn Desbris and his amethyst gemstone. Though they are victorious, victory comes at a high price. The monk Avelyn gives his life to end the demon dactyl's influence. =The Demon Spirit= Even with the destruction of the dactyl, all is not well in the Kingdom of Honce-the-Bear. The servants of Bestesbulzibar still roam the land, creating havoc. Elbryan and Pony, along with the small group of fighters they've formed, commence to mopping up the demon's army as best they can. Soon, though, they discover that their friend Bradwarden, who they thought was dead, is still alive and in the clutches of the Church. Furthermore, the Chilichunks, Pony's adopted family, have also been captured as a means to lure Pony out so that Markwart can take back the Ring Stones stolen by Avelyn. It is up to Elbryan and Pony, with help from their friends such as the new character Roger Lockless, to attempt a rescue while fighting the enemy. During this time Elbryan teaches Pony Bi'nelle dasada, the forbidden sword-dance of the Touel'alfar, the short winged elves of Corona. Meanwhile, Father Abbot Markwart schemes to get back the stolen gemstones from Jilseponie. One of his servants, Marcalo De'Unnero, uses his exceptional training in the martial arts to create two new Brothers Justice to find the woman and the gemstones and deal with them both. While this is going on, another of Markwart's servants, an ambitious monk named Brother Francis, comes to the forefront of the story. With his closeness to the Father Abbot, Francis becomes a powerful force in the monastery and eventually leads his own party in search of the gemstones, at the Father Abbot's command. The Church no longer has a solid foundation, however. Master Jojonah is a high-ranking member of the Church and a former teacher of Avelyn Desbris. He, along with others, begins to see the rot in their beloved institution and work quietly to bring about the truth of Avelyn. This work eventually leads to the death of the master as Elbryan and his companions free Bradwarden. =The Demon Apostle= The final novel in the first trilogy begins with the mopping up of Bestesbulzibar's army and the battle against the demon's spirit, which has possessed the highest levels of power within the Abellican Church. Again, it is up to Elbryan and Pony, along with their friends, to combat the corruption and attempt to end its terrible hold forever. The protagonists' courage is tested as they work to heal their home; their wits are challenged constantly as they strive to defeat the enemy; and their convictions regarding right and wrong battle against what might be necessary to end the evil. Elbryan Wyndon, the Nightbird, travels north to take back the Timberlands while Pony moves south to the city of Palmaris. In their journeys they learn of dire news and find unexpected allies. On the one hand a civil war in Honce-the-Bear seems imminent. On the other, the intrigues of the Abellican Church, and her Father Abbot's desire to take back the magic gemstones‚Äîa desire manipulated and enhanced by the spirit of the demon dactyl‚Äîdog the steps of the heroes, especially those of Jilseponie, who has recently learned of her pregnancy. Elbryan, Pony and their companions fight their way through numerous battles and intrigues before finally confronting Father Abbot Markwart, his lackey Marcalo De'Unnero and the spirit of Bestesbulzibar. In the end De'Unnero is defeated and Markwart is slain. The demon dactyl's spirit flees again, bringing victory for the forces of good. However, the victory comes with a heavy price as Elbryan Wyndon, the Nightbird, dies of wounds inflicted in his battle with Marcalo De'Unnero. Mortalis The novel which bridges the two trilogies of the Saga tells of Pony's life after the war: her fight against the crushing grief of her husband Elbryan's death and her fight to stop a plague infecting the people of the kingdom. At this time, the characters of Aydrian Wyndon, Elbryan's and Pony's child, and Brynn Dharielle, a To-Gai girl turned ranger, are introduced to the story. The second trilogy =Ascendance= The novel Ascendance begins the tale of Aydrian Wyndon, a tortured and lonely young man raised by the Touel'alfar to be a ranger even greater than his father and, hopefully, be the salvation of the elves. The plans of the Touel'alfar go awry due to Aydrian's own arrogance, cultivated by a dark force. When he leaves the home of the elves, events occur which bring about great sorrow for himself, his mother and the kingdom. =Transcendence= Transcendence is the story of Brynn Dharielle and her quest to free her people from the tyranny of the Behrenese kingdom. With the help of Belli'mar Juraviel, elven trainer of the rangers Elbryan and Brynn (among many others), a dragon named Agradeleas, and others, Brynn works hard throughout the story to see her dream of freedom come true. =Immortalis= The final novel of the DemonWars Saga brings all of the main players from the previous two books together to combat the evil still residing in the land. With the end of this novel, and the final destruction of the evil presence, the saga concludes. Characters =Elbryan Wyndon= The nephew of the ranger Mather Wyndon, he was taken in and trained by the Touel'alfar, the winged elves of Corona. After several years of training under his mentor and close friend Belli'mar Juraviel, he is given the name 'Nightbird' and is charged to defend the lands of the North against the armies of Bestesbulzibar, the Demon dactyl. Alongside his mate and later wife Pony and her mentor, former Abellican Brother Avelyn Desbris, Elbryan goes to Mount Aida and defies the dactyl. The demon is destroyed but Avelyn is killed. After this victory, Elbryan leads the resistance against the remaining evil forces and takes the fight to the corrupt leadership of the Abellican Church that betrayed Avelyn. He was killed in the final battle against the Church after fighting the Bishop of Palmaris Marcalo De'Unnero. He then assisted Pony in defeating Father Abbot Dalebert Markwart, who was being possessed by Bestesbulzibar. The strain was too much and it killed him. He was given a national funeral and recognized as a ranger even greater than his uncle was. During the final days of the war between Pony and her son Aydrian (who was also possessed by the demon), the young man summoned his father's zombie-spirit to defeat his mother. Pony awoke Elbryan's consciousness from within the zombie and they banished Bestesbulzibar from Aydrian's body. Years later, after Pony's death, Aydrian broke the spell protecting Andur'Blough, the hidden valley of the elves, and destroyed what remained of Bestesbulzibar with the help from his father, his mother, his great-uncle and all the rangers dead before them. =Jilseponie \\"Pony\\" Wyndon Ursal= Pony was Elbryan's childhood friend. When their village was attacked by goblins, they were the only survivors. The horrors witnessed by Pony broke her mind and she was unable to remember what had happened. She was adopted by a family of Palmaris, the Chilichunks, and slowly started to regain her memory. She married a young nobleman named Connor but all her attempts to love him made the dark memories of her past return. Although patient at first, Connor cracked when she refused to make love to him on their wedding night and he tried to rape her. However, he stopped just in time and broke off the marriage. He gave Pony a way out by offering to let her join the army which she accepted. After joining the army, she met former Abellican Brother Avelyn Desbris, who had run away from the Church with hundreds of gemstones, the source of their power. Pony and Avelyn ran away together and the monk trained her in the ways of the stones. She became a powerful magician and was soon reunited with her lost love-Elbryan. After the dactyl's destruction and Avelyn's death, Pony helped the resistance against the advance of goblin and powrie forces in the North of Corona. However, the Abellican Church wanted the gemstones back and they sent two monks after her. The monks were defeated but Father Abbot Markwart captured her family. When she found them dead, she vowed revenge against the Church. In the next book, it was revealed that she was pregnant with Elbryan's child but it was seemingly killed during a duel with Markwart. In her rage, she fought the powerful old man again and managed to defeat and kill him. She lost her husband during this battle. Years later, Pony discovered that her son Aydrian was still alive and had been trained by the elves like his father. Around this time, she fell in love with and married King Danube Brock Ursal becoming Queen of Honce-The- Bear. Aydrian, who had been corrupted by Bestesbulzibar's spirit, killed her new husband and usurped the throne. Allying with her brother-in-law, Prince Midalis, Pony declared war on her son. In the final battle against Aydrian's army, Pony fought against her son, her husband's zombie-spirit and Bestesbulzibar's spirit. She summoned Elbryan's consciousness from within the zombie and they released Aydrian from the hold of the demon. Ten years later, Pony died after spending the last decade with her son. After her death, Aydrian sought to release Andur'Blough from Bestesbulzibar's stain and succeeded with help from the spirits of all the dead rangers. =Avelyn Desbris= Brother Avelyn Desbris was an Abellican monk and Pony's mentor in the art of the Stones' magic. Devoted to God, Avelyn worked hard to join the Abellican Church and finally succeeded. He quickly became a center of great attention when he crossed the Gauntlet of Pain without flinching. Father Abbot Dalebert Markwart, the supreme leader of the Church, and Master Jojonah thought very highly of him and started to groom him to be one of the four monks to travel to the island of Pimaninicuit where the gemstones fell from the skies. After having collected the greatest number of gemstones ever and losing one brother, Avelyn and his companions returned to St. Mere Abelle. During the trip, Avelyn fell in love with Dansally Comerwick, a woman who was on the ship for the crew's pleasure. However, after returning, the Abellican monks killed the crew, including Dansally. Avelyn stole the gemstones and ran away after killing Master Siherton. As he escaped, he had a vision of the Demon Dactyl and realized that the great evil had returned to Corona. For the next ten years, Avelyn wandered around Corona, attempting to warn the people of the Dactyl's return but also falling progressively into a brawler and an alcoholic. However, his life begun to mean something again when he met Jilseponie, a soldier who had escaped the massacre of her garrison by the poweries. The two formed a strong bond and ran away together. During this time, Avelyn taught the young woman how to use the gemstones he had stolen and she became a powerful magician herself. However, the Church hadn't forgotten about Avelyn and, using his fellow student Quintall as their tool, their Brother Justice, they tried to reclaim the gemstones and assassinate Avelyn for his heresy. After Jilseponie was captured by Brother Justice and used as bait, Avelyn allied with the ranger Elbryan Wyndon to release her. It was there, after defeating Quintall, that Elbryan was revealed to be Jilseponie's childhood love. Avelyn remained with the resistance run by Elbryan and Pony, using his magic to defeat the hordes of goblins, giants and powries that served as the Dactyl's armies. Avelyn was later killed during his duel with the Dactyl in Mount Aida where he managed to destroy the Demon's physical form. However, even in death, Avelyn's name was remembered. His former Master in the Church, Master Jojonah, came to embrace Avelyn's belief that the Church was corrupted and he began preaching Avelyn's ways to other Brothers, most notably Braumin Herde. After the death of Father Abbot Markwart, Bishop Francis Delacourt of Palmaris, once the Father Abbot's most trusted advisor and staunch anti-Avelynist, recommended to Bishop of Honce-the-Bear, Je'howeth, that Avelyn be canonized as a saint of the Abellican Church. His teachings help change the Abellican Church for the better. =Aydrian Wyndon= Aydrian Wyndon is the son of Elbryan and Jilseponie (Pony) Wyndon. He was taken and raised secretly by Lady Dasselrond, the Queen of the Touel'alfar. The elves had allowed Pony to believe her child had died in the womb in her spirit battle with Father Abbot Markwart (who at the time was possessed by the spirit of the Demon Dactyl). Also kept secret from all, including the elves, was that the Demon Dactyl's spirit had infected the child's soul, and left a piece of itself there. Aydrian was raised under the harsh tutelage of the elves. From a very young age he began his ranger training, like his father and great uncle before him. His father, Elbryan \\"The Nightbird\\", is said to have been the greatest swordsman and possibly the greatest ranger to have ever lived in the thousands of years that the Elves had been training human rangers. He help destroy the Demon Dactyl's corporeal form and its armies as well as besting Marcalo De'Unnero in combat, who was said to have been the greatest fighter the Abellican Monks ever produced. Lady Dasselrond also trained him to use the magic gemstones, being the only elf to possess a stone and have any knowledge with using them. No creature, man, or elf used the magic gemstones besides the Abellican Monks, who believed them to be holy stones from heaven. Aydrian's mother, Pony, was incredibly powerful with the gemstones, performing feats no other human alive could and only a handful in history would be capable of. Aydrian showed to not only be as good of a fighter as his father, but to also be as powerful as his mother with the magic gemstones‚Äîin fact even more so. Under the guidance of the Demon Dactyl's spirit, he was able to tap deeper into the magic gemstones than anyone in history besides the legendary St. Abelle, who was the founder of the entire Abellican Order. When Aydrian matured he left the elves after overpowering the Queen in a magical test of wills. Upon his journeys he came to a little town where he took up the Ranger name of Nighthawk, as his father's was called Nightbird. During his journeys he met his parent's sworn enemy Marcalo De'Unnero (who had become a Weretiger). They allied and began to plot until Aydrian killed King Danube and took the throne for himself. As king he threw the lands into war and was eventually defeated by the King's Brother Midalis who fought alongside Aydrian's mother Pony, his former friend who was a ranger-in-training with him Brynn Dharielle, a Jhesta Tu mystic Pagonel, a large barbarian ranger Andacanvar, and the dragon Agradeleous. During the battle Aydrian displayed his gemstone power by bringing his father's decayed corpse back to life. However, as his father became whole he regained control of himself and with Pony they used a soul stone to attack their son's spirit, only to find the Demon Dactyl there. They fought the Demon as they had done so years before, on the day Elbryan had died, and again they destroyed it, freeing their son. Unfortunately, while the spiritual battle ensued, Aydrian was physically rendered frozen and had his heart pierced by Brynn Dharielle and died shortly after being freed from the demon. Pony used her soul stone and dove into it again, with Elbryan's help they brought Aydrian back to life as he had brought his father back. The strain was too great for Elbryan though, and he faded back into death again moments after.

The Voyager was modeled after the classic Minimoog synthesizer that was popular in the 1970s, and is meant to be a successor to that instrument. History In November 2001, Moog Music (then Big Briar) announced that they planned to release an updated version of the Minimoog. The new synthesizer promised to have modern features, yet continue to be authentic to the original sound quality. The company offered a new synthesizer to the customer who could come up with a name for the project. Early in 2002, they announced that the synthesizer would be named the \\"Minimoog Voyager\\". Late in the summer of 2002, Moog Music began shipping the new Voyagers. Occasionally a new system software release is made available, which can be downloaded from Moog Music's website and sent to the Voyager via MIDI. Recent software versions allow complex internal patching of control voltages, a very powerful and convenient feature for the user. Also available is the VX-351 Voyager Expander, an external box that is wired to the Voyager featuring 25 control-voltage outputs for physical CV patching. Recent versions of the Voyager software expand the original 128-patch memory to 896 patches by implementing seven selectable banks, A to G, with 128 patches each. The current model (2007) has most of the patches pre-programmed in groups corresponding to earlier software releases. In September 2015, Moog Music announced that after 13 years of production and over 14,000 units sold, sales of the Voyager would be discontinued. Models The first 600 units could be preordered at the price of US$3495 and featured Bob Moog's autograph. The standard edition continues to sell for US$2995. Apart from the signature and price, the models are identical. Wood finish on the models is offered in walnut, cherry or maple. For 2004, Moog Music released a limited 50th Anniversary Edition Voyager. The wood cabinet was painted black and the control panel was backlit using electroluminescent technology. 2005 marked the end of production of these units, while Moog Music continues to sell a backlit model called the Electric Blue that features an iridescent blue cabinet finish. Both of these models have the same features of the non-backlit models but sell for US$3295. Since 2006 they had offered a customizable version named the Select Series, in which the customer can choose between mahogany, electric blue, traditional ash, white wash, maple, black, cherry, and walnut cabinets with red, blue, white, orange, green, or purple backlighting. Their retail price is the same as that of the Electric Blue model. In 2005, Moog Music released the Voyager Rack Mount Edition (RME), a synthesizer based on the Voyager. The RME was designed to occupy 5 spaces in a 19-inch rack. The model has all of the features of other Voyagers except the touch panel control and keyboard. The RME is designed to be controlled via MIDI. Up to 16 RME Voyagers can be combined to achieve polyphony. In 2008, Moog Music released the Minimoog Voyager Old School. (Voyager OS). The Voyager OS has enhanced modulation busses with more sources on the panel to compensate for the lack of software and an operating system. The Voyager OS also does not have a touch pad or MIDI inputs and outputs. Unlike other Voyagers, it features a keyboard pitch CV out and keyboard gate CV out, without the aid of the VX-351. The Voyager OS's pitch bender is set to +/- 7 semitones, and can be modified by an internal jumper. The OS is sold with one wood panelling option, \\"traditional ash\\". However, a few limited edition models were housed in white wash cabinets. The Voyager Old School was discontinued in 2009. In 2010, for the 40th anniversary of the Minimoog Model D, Moog Music released the Minimoog Voyager XL model. It is an expanded Voyager that includes, in addition to the original Voyager features, a five octave 61-note keyboard, a ribbon controller, an additional Six Waveform LFO with positive and negative outputs, a Lag Processor, two Attenuators with Offset Control, a four by one Mixer also with Offset Control, and most notably, a patch bay on the far left of the instrument--providing a similar modular functionality to the VX-series products. In 2012 to commemorate the 10th Anniversary of the Voyager, Moog made a limited run of 31 units that were dipped in 24 karat Gold, finished in Black Piano Lacquered Wood with Japanese Awabi Pearl inlayed sides and Translucent Rotary Knobs. One was given away and the others were distributed for sale worldwide. The 10th Anniversary Gold Minimoog Voyager is perhaps the world's rarest and most desirable synthesizer.

It is native to the southwestern Pacific Ocean from Australia to New Zealand. Description The silver sweep has deep and strongly compressed body with a thin caudal peduncle. The head is moderately sized with an almost straight dorsal profile, a short snout and quite large eyes. The mouth is small and oblique with small but strong teeth in the jaws arranged in broad bands with the outer band being enlarged and recurved. Most of the body is covered in very small ctenoid scales and there is a gently curved lateral line. The dorsal fin continuous with a very short first spine, there are a 10 spines which progressively become higher towards the tail, the first rays in the soft-rayed portion of the dorsal fin is only slightly higher than the spiny portion giving the dorsal fin an almost straight profile. The soft-rayed part of the dorsal fin contains 26-28 soft rays. The anal fin has 3 spines and 27-28 soft rays. The soft portion of the dorsal fin is notably longer than they spiny portion. It has small pectoral fin are small with the uppermost rays being the longest. The pelvic fins are also small and are located below and to the rear of the pectoral fins. Silver sweeps are greyish, blue-grey or green-grey dorsally and silver-grey ventrally, with the edge of the gill cover and the base of the pectoral fin being blackish. This species can reach a length of . Distribution The silver sweep is found in the southwestern Pacific Ocean off Australia and New Zealand. In Australia it is found from Moreton Bay in Queensland south to Tasmania and west as far as Victor Harbor, South Australia. It is also found in the Tasman Sea around Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island. Silver sweep are a common fish on the east coast of Australia, particularly in New South Wales. In New Zealand silver sweep are distributed around the coast of the North Island. Habitat and biology Adult silver sweeps are found on coastal reefs at depths down to at least , It feeds on plankton over rock reefs where it forms schools while juveniles settle in tide pools and can be found in the brackish waters of estuaries. They spawn in the winter with the peak breeding season between May and August. The eggs are pelagic. The young fish grow very quickly for the first 2-3 years but growth slows down significantly after sexual maturity, although they may live over 50 years. Silver sweeps have separate sexes. Taxonomy The silver sweep was firs formally described by the Austrian ichthyologist Rudolf Kner in 1865 with the type locality given as Sydney in New South Wales. Fisheries The silver sweep is of secondary importance as a target for commercial fisheries and is caught using purse seines and trap nets. Since 1997-98 the amount landed in New South Wales has declined from nearly 15t to less than 50t. About 60t are caught annually in New South Wales by recreational fishermen. The flesh of the silver sweep is said to be firm and of excellent quality.

The first was built in 1992 and entered production in March 1993, replacing the Leyland Olympian. History The design was based on its predecessor, the Leyland Olympian, but the chassis was modified such that only the chassis design and layout remained, with even the grade of steel for the chassis members being changed, Volvo's standard electrical system was used, as well as standard Volvo steering/\\"Z cam\\" braking systems. The early Volvo Olympians were offered with Cummins L10 or Volvo TD102KF engine, coupled to Voith DIWA or ZF Ecomat gearbox.Volvo power for Olympian Commercial Motor 27 February 1992Volvo opens bus lines in Irvine Commercial Motor 1 April 1993 From late 1996, only the 9.6-litre Volvo D10A-245 Euro II engine with electronic diesel control was offered. It was available with Alexander R-type, Northern Counties Palatine/Palatine 2 and East Lancs E Type/Pyoneer bodywork. The Volvo Olympian is likely to be built as either closed top or open top. The Volvo Olympian remained as popular as the Leyland Olympian in the United Kingdom and Ireland. A large number of Olympians were exported to Hong Kong and Singapore; most of them being air-conditioned. Orders =United Kingdom= The buses were very popular in the United Kingdom; most of the UK versions had two rather than three axles. London United, Metroline, Stagecoach London, London Central, London General, Capital Citybus, MTL London, Harris Bus and First CentreWest had received 687 Volvo Olympians between 1994 and 1999. Because of a low-floor rule that had to be complied with by 2006, these buses were not in service for long. Only two buses from London United survived for rail replacement services. In 2008, the Low Emission Zone puts a final class of the Volvo Olympians in London. Metroline quit Volvo Olympians service in June 2008, displaced by Alexander Dennis Enviro200Darts. Some of them went to Ensignbus for rail replacement work. In April 2000, Singapore Bus Services had sent two Volvo Olympians, one to Nottingham and one to Metroline. Metroline replaced the tropical windows and the doors with British standard products and reregistered it. It was the first to be sent to Ensignbus in September 2005. Many other operators outside London did receive Volvo Olympians, the main operator being FirstGroup. =Ireland= Dublin Bus RA-class Alexander bodied Volvo Olympian in D√∫n Laoghaire in May 2005 Northern Counties Palatine II bodied Volvo Olympian in Yellow Buses livery in May 2009 Dublin Bus had continued their Olympian orders with the RA batch being ordered first (RA176 - RA325), 150 buses between 1994 and 1996. In January 1997, Dublin Bus ordered a further 315 Volvo Olympians, which were designated as RV. During that period, new liveries were introduced, such as CitySwift and the switch of the core livery from two-tone green/orange to white/blue/orange. All Volvo Olympians were withdrawn by 2012. =Hong Kong= Citybus Volvo Olympian in Hong Kong in May 2009 Kowloon Motor Bus had ordered 531 Volvo Olympian 11m, 338 Volvo Olympian 12m and 30 Volvo Olympian non-aircon buses between 1994 and 1999. Long Win sold 10 12-metre Volvo Olympians to KMB in 1999. Due to the modernisation of the fleet, all Volvo Olympians have been withdrawn or converted to training buses, but they were withdrawn in November 2017. Citybus had ordered 10 Volvo Olympian 10.4m, 2 Volvo Olympian 12m (second hand from China Light & Power), 310 Volvo Olympian 12m and 142 Volvo Olympian 11m (two second-hand from China Motor Bus) between 1994 and 1998. Due to the modernisation of the fleet, most of the buses were either withdrawn, sold or converted to training buses. These were withdrawn in March 2019. China Motor Bus ordered 64 Volvo Olympians between 1996 and 1998. 62 were sold to New World First Bus in 1998 and 5 of them were converted to open-top for Rickshaw Sightseeing Bus. New World First Bus received 2 12-metre Volvo Olympians from HACTL in 1999 and 10 from Citybus in 2014. All buses were withdrawn as they aged 16 ‚Äì 17 years and the last batch of buses were withdrawn in October 2015. NWFB transferred two second-hand buses to Citybus for private hire fleet, these were withdrawn again by March 2019. =Singapore= SBS Transit Alexander bodied Volvo Olympian in Singapore in April 2006 In 1993, Singapore Bus Services had ordered 100 Volvo Olympian 2-Axle and 201 Volvo Olympian 3-Axle to replace the then retiring earlier batches of Leyland Atlanteans with Walter Alexander Royale bodywork. These Volvo Olympians were delivered between June 1994 and June 1995. The Volvo Olympian 2-Axle are the last ever non-air conditioned buses to be brought in by Singapore Bus Services and also the last non air-conditioned buses in Singapore. Due to the additional weight of the air-compressor which necessitated a third axle, they were unable to be retrofitted with air-conditioning. In late 2003, most of these buses were redeployed to industrial routes to replace the then outgoing Leyland Olympian 2-Axles. Half of this batch had their lifespan extended by 2 years due to insufficient deliveries of new buses. All units were retired between June 2011 and September 2013, and the non-airconditioned bus fare structure was abolished shortly after. The first batch of Volvo Olympian 3-Axle were largely similar in appearance to the Leyland Olympian 3-Axle, except for some minor technical differences. To maximise capacity, all buses except one were retrofitted with a standee area on the offside by removing 4 pairs of seats in the early 2000s. In 2011, most of these buses were given a 2 year lifespan extension, with some units receiving an additional six months to 1 year extension owing to insufficient deliveries of replacements. All units of this batch were retired between March 2012 and June 2015. In 1996, SBS ordered a second batch of 200 Volvo Olympian 3-Axle to replace some of the then-retiring Mercedes-Benz O305 and Leyland Atlantean. These buses were delivered between August 1996 and February 1998. To maximise capacity, all buses had 4 pairs of seats removed on the offside to create a standee area in the early 2000s. In 2014, most of these buses in this batch were given a lifespan extension of 2 years due to insufficient deliveries of new buses. All units were retired between August 2013 and October 2016. These buses were also the last double deck buses in Singapore to use plastic destination signages. In 1998, SBS ordered the last batch of 70 Volvo Olympian 3-Axle with Walter Alexander Royale bodywork, which were delivered with the standee area pre-installed. Registered between March 1999 and December 2000, all units were retrofitted with LECIP electronic destination signages (EDS) in the early 2010s. Unlike the earlier batches, none of these buses received a lifespan extension of 2 years owing to a large influx of replacements. All units of this batch were retired between March 2016 and December 2017. End of production Production of Volvo Olympian ended in 2000 and concluded a run of over 10,000 Leyland/Volvo Olympian chassis. The last built were for Yorkshire Coastliner and had Alexander Royale bodies. The chassis had two low-floor successors: the 2-axle Volvo B7TL and the 3-axle Volvo Super Olympian. It was intended that the Volvo B7L replace the Olympian, however, very few Dual Axle, Double deck B7Ls were produced, with the B7TL chassis carrying out the B7Ls intended role.

History A 1903 Railway Clearing House map of railways in the vicinity of Spalding (upper centre) Spalding gained its first rail links to Peterborough, Boston and Lincoln in 1848, courtesy of the Great Northern Railway (GNR) who built their main line from London to Doncaster through the town; Spalding railway station opened on 17 October 1848. This route was superseded by the direct line via Grantham within four years, but it remained well used by traffic heading towards Louth and Grimsby over the former East Lincolnshire Railway. The GNR subsequently added a line eastwards to Sutton Bridge via Holbeach (the Norwich & Spalding Railway) in stages between 1858 and 1862, a westward route to Bourne in 1866 and another to the following year in an attempt to thwart the ambitions of the competing Great Eastern Railway (GER). These efforts did not succeed however and the company eventually agreed to work these routes jointly with the Midland Railway (the former pair forming the backbone of the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway system) and the GER (March line) by the beginning of the 1870s. The collaboration between GNR and GER also led to the construction of the last route out of the town, the GE&GN; Joint line to Sleaford which opened to traffic on 1 August 1882. By the end of the nineteenth century the town had become a major rail crossroads and the station had grown to reflect this, having more than doubled in size from its opening half a century earlier. It would also later become a popular destination in its own right, with the annual Tulip Festival bringing excursion trains into the town from all over the country from the late 1950s onwards. British Railways was formed on 1 January 1948, and Spalding station was renamed Spalding Town on 1 December 1948. The Midland & Great Northern routes into the town were heavily used, particularly in the summer months, well into the 1950s, but they were the first to suffer from the BR economy drive of the time, closing to passengers on 28 February 1959.Body, p.156 The East Lincolnshire line to Boston was to suffer a similar fate a decade later, with the last trains to Grimsby and Peterborough running on 3 October 1970. This left the Joint Line as the only surviving route through the town; typically just three trains per day each way between Lincoln and March/Cambridge called at the station in this period. However, its status as a junction was restored within months, the line to Peterborough regaining a limited (thrice daily, peak hours only) passenger service from 7 June 1971.Disused Stations - SpaldingDisused Stations, Retrieved 2014-01-10https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en- GB#!topic/uk.railway/JlEis2cCzaE The Joint line remained a busy freight artery for the next few years, serving as one as the main outlets for the marshalling yard complex at Whitemoor but the general decline in freight traffic in the area would ultimately lead to the Spalding to March portion's closure to all traffic on 27 November 1982.East Anglian Railway Archive - The March to Spalding Line Retrieved 2014-01-10 This left the town effectively with the same rail access as it had back in 1848, albeit with trains to Lincoln running via Sleaford rather than Boston. Services to and from Peterborough did improve following the closure of the March line, with the existing service from Lincoln diverted to start and terminate there and some extra trains being added to the timetable. The station, known in steam days as Spalding Town, was honoured on 3 May 2002 when a main line locomotive was dedicated to it. Class 31 diesel No. 31106, owned by Cambridgeshire businessman and enthusiast Howard Johnston, who was born nearby, arrived on a Tulip Parade day special train, and a short stopover was arranged for Colin Fisher, Chairman of South Holland District Council, to unveil the cast Spalding Town nameplate (which includes the authority's crest within it) on the side of the engine. He was also presented with a replica plate as a permanent reminder of the occasion. Although intended for public display, this has not yet taken place. =Station Masters= *Mr. Fellowes ???? - 1858 *Thomas Blunt ca. 1875 - 1885 *James L.

The station is staffed part-time and offers limited facilities other than two shelters, bicycle storage, timetables, platform departure screens and Help Points. There is also a ticket machine on platform 1. Other than a snack machine in the booking hall, there are no other retail facilities on the station; however local shops are within walking distance.

Spalding has two platforms.Spalding Station in 2002; Retrieved 2014-01-10 Platform 1, adjacent to the station building, is mainly used for southbound services towards Peterborough and terminating trains from Peterborough, but is also used by some northbound through services towards Sleaford and Lincoln; Platform 2 can only be used by northbound services. The station used to have seven platforms: five through faces (up main and two islands) and two terminal bays, with services to March and Sleaford on the Great Northern and Great Eastern Joint Railway, Bourne and on the Midland & Great Northern Joint Railway and the Great Northern \\"Lincolnshire Loop\\" line to and then onwards to and Grimsby. There was also, past the Northern Junction a freight line going off to the former British Sugar plant.Body, p.155 Only the routes to Werrington Junction, Peterborough and are still in use and the station has been remodelled and downsized considerably since the demise of the March line in 1982. The bridge connecting Platforms 1 and 2 to the rest of the station still exists, but the old platform 5 has been fenced off, the bays filled in and the walk through on the bridge to platforms 6 and 7 bricked up. The tracks meanwhile have been lifted, the western island platforms cleared and the site now used for housing. Though very little remains of the old station, the fa√ßade remains as it was when first built.

It originally aired on April 3, 1964 on CBS. Opening narration Plot Roswell G. Flemington, owner of a model ship company and formerly a serviceman of the United States Navy, grew up in a home where his mother required silence. Thus, as an adult, he makes as much noise as he possibly can, is obsessed with the Navy, and behaves thunderously in response to any slight. One day, after twenty years his wife has had enough of his obsession with noise and finally walks out on him. Now alone, he begins to hear every little noise ‚Äì a drip of water, the margin bell on a typewriter ‚Äì like an explosion or gunshot. He sees a psychiatrist who helps him understand that conflict with his wife has caused him to relive his resentment against his mother to the point that he internalizes his mother's affliction. He now realizes it is all in his head, all he needs to do is overcome the mental block with \\"mind over matter\\", and he does. The only problem is that when his wife returns to pick up her jewelry, he tells her about it and proceeds to \\"shut her out\\". Unfortunately, his solution proves too effective, and Flemington finds that he can hear nothing. Now desperate to hear anything, Flemington puts a record on, setting the volume at its highest setting. Although the scene is silent, the insides of his apartment vibrate from the sound of his stereo. As the episode ends, Flemington opens up the windows to the street below, and begs for noise.

It followed the First Battle of the Aisne as both sides moved northwards, trying to turn the northern flank of their opponent. The Second Army (No√´l de Castelnau), began to assemble at Amiens in mid-September and was directed by General Joseph Joffre, the Generalissimo of the French Army, to attack near Albert. On 25 September, the Second Army advanced eastwards but instead of advancing round an open northern flank, encountered the German 6th Army which had attacked in the opposite direction, reaching Bapaume on 26 September and Thiepval the next day. The Germans had intended to outflank the French and drive westward to the English Channel, seizing the industrial and agricultural regions of northern France and isolating Belgium. Neither side could defeat their opponent and the battle ended in stalemate around 29 September, as both sides made another outflanking attempt to the north of Albert, at the Battle of Arras (1‚Äì4 October). Background =Battle of the Frontiers= On 18 August, General Albert d'Amade formed a defence line from Maubeuge to Dunkirk, to prevent the disruption of railways by German cavalry raids. The Scarpe, Escaut and Rhonelle sluices were opened to extend the floods of the Scarpe and the old forts of de Maulde, Flines, Curgies, Cond√© and Le Quesnoy around Valenciennes were re-occupied. On 20 August, d'Amade formed a line of three territorial divisions de campagne, with the 84th Territorial Division from the Scarpe to the Sambre, the 82nd Territorial Division from the Sambre to the Lys and the 81st Territorial Division from the Lys to the sea. When the BEF advanced to the west of Maubeuge, the 84th Territorial Division advanced to Cond√© and formed a new defensive line along the Escaut, from Cond√© to Maulde. On 23 August, the 88th Territorial Division arrived near Lille from Paris, with orders to recapture Tournai. The division was bombarded by heavy artillery when close to Cysoing the next morning and slowly retired to Templeuve and Arras. After the Battle of Charleroi (21 August) and the Battle of Mons (23 August), Amiens became vulnerable to the advance of the 1st Army as it pursued the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and the Fifth Army. At on 24 August, the Siege of Maubeuge began and the 84th Territorial Division fell back towards Cambrai and Marquion. The rearguard was attacked near Fresnes, just south of Cond√© and next day, the division was engaged near Haspres and defeated. Orders came from Paris to abandon Lille, which was evacuated on 24 August and the 82nd Territorial Division formed a line from La Bass√©e to Corbehem, with the 81st Territorial Division forming a line from Aire to the sea. The Sixth Group of Reserve Divisions (also known as Group Ebener, with the 61st and 62d Reserve divisions) were sent from Paris, increasing d'Amade's force to six divisions, to hold a line from Douai to B√©thune and Aire, to the sea, with another of the Lille garrison. On 25 August, the German II Corps advanced westwards through Denain, to get behind the left flank of the BEF and after dark reached the vicinity of Cambrai, where rearguards of the 84th Territorial Division defended the Sens√©e Canal at Bouchain, against a German attempt to cross. During 26 August, the division slowly retreated west of Cambrai; Group Ebener arrived at Marquion and were then ordered by Joffre to Combles and P√©ronne, to become part of the Sixth Army. The divisions retreated westwards, covered by the 84th Territorial Division, in actions which diverted part of the German II Corps from the BEF during the Battle of Le Cateau (26 August). =Action of Mesnil= Early on 28 August, the two reserve divisions advanced from Bapaume, taking the German II Cavalry Corps by surprise in its billets around P√©ronne. The action continued into the next day and the French divisions were then driven back from Manancourt, south-west of Bapaume, by elements of II Corps and the IV Reserve Corps. Further to the east, the French II Cavalry Corps on the left of the BEF, failed to prevent the Germans from reaching the outskirts of P√©ronne on the evening of 27 August. The cavalry withdrew south of the Somme and next day P√©ronne was captured. The German advance continued towards Amiens and on 29 August, the Sixth Army counter-attacked the German advance guards, which had reached Bray-sur-Somme, Chuignolles and Framerville near Amiens. A Moroccan Chasseur brigade, the 14th division of VII Corps, the 45th and 55th battalions of Chasseurs and the 55th Division on the right flank near Nesle, captured Proyart as the four Territorial divisions advanced on Amiens. During the evening, a German counter-attack retook Proyart and forced the French to the south. The Territorial divisions retreated from Amiens on 30 August, skirmishing with German patrols near Cagny. On 11 September, the German garrison withdrew from Amiens and next day the Territorial divisions arrived from Rouen and captured a few stragglers. The Territorial divisions advanced to the north-east towards P√©ronne and Fricourt on 17 September. Prelude =German offensive preparations= General Erich von Falkenhayn replaced Colonel-General Helmuth von Moltke the Younger as Chief of the German General Staff on 14 September, when the German front in France was being consolidated in Lorraine and on the Aisne. The open western flank beyond the 1st Army and the danger of attacks from the National redoubt of Belgium, where the Siege of Antwerp had begun on 20 August, created a dilemma. The German positions in France had to be maintained, when only offensive operations could lead to decisive victory. Appeals for the reinforcement of the Eastern Front could not be ignored and Falkenhayn cancelled a plan for the 6th Army to break through near Verdun. The army was sent to the right wing of the German armies, where the flank of 1st army was at Compi√®gne, beyond which there were no German forces until Antwerp. Falkenhayn could reinforce the 1st Army with the 6th Army, send it to Antwerp or divide the army by reinforcing the 1st Army and the Antwerp siege with part of the army, while the rest operated in the area between. Falkenhayn chose to move the 6th Army to Maubeuge and outflank the Franco-British left wing, withdrawing the 1st, 7th and 2nd armies to La F√®re, Laon and Reims while the 6th Army was redeploying. The 3rd, 4th and 5th armies were to defend if the French attacked first and then attack to the south-west beginning on 18 September. General Karl von B√ºlow, the 2nd Army commander and Colonel Gerhard Tappen of the Operations Branch of the (OHL, Supreme Army Command) objected because the time needed to move the 6th Army, would concede the initiative to the French. B√ºlow and Tappen recommended an attack by the 1st and 7th armies, with reinforcements from the armies to the east, for an offensive from Reims to Fismes and Soissons, since the French could redeploy troops on undamaged railways. The risk of separating the 1st and 2nd armies again would be avoided; Falkenhayn agreed and ordered the 6th Army to assemble at St. Quentin. Attacks to encircle Verdun from the south and from Soissons to Reims would pin down French troops. On 21 September, Falkenhayn met B√ºlow and agreed that the 6th Army should concentrate close to Amiens, attack towards the Channel coast and then envelop the French south of the Somme, in a (decisive battle). The XXI Corps, which had moved from Lun√©ville on 15 September and the I Bavarian Corps which marched from Namur, arrived during 24 September but were diverted against the Second Army as soon as they arrived on 24 September, with orders to extend the front northwards from Chaulnes to P√©ronne, attack the French bridgehead and drive the French back over the Somme. =French offensive preparations= French attempts to advance after the German retirement to the Aisne were frustrated after 14 September, when German troops were discovered to have stopped their retirement and dug in on the north bank of the Aisne. Joffre ordered that the German 1st and 2nd armies be attacked but attempts by the Fifth, Ninth and Sixth armies to advance from had little success. French Military Intelligence reported German troop movements from east to west, which led Joffre to continue moving French troops from the east, which had begun on 2 September with IV Corps and continued on 9 September with XX Corps, 11 September with XIII Corps and XIV Corps on 18 September. The depletion of the French forces in the east, took place just before the Battle of Flirey , a German offensive against the Third Army on either side of Verdun, the Fifth Army north of Reims and the Sixth Army along the Aisne, which ended with the creation of the St Mihiel Salient. Joffre maintained the French emphasis on the western flank, after receiving intercepted wireless messages, which showed that the Germans were moving an army to the western flank. Joffre continued to send units to the Second Army, north of the Sixth Army. On 24 September, the Second Army was attacked and found difficulty in holding ground, rather than advancing round the German flank as intended. General Ferdinand Foch ordered the left flank of the French armies to move northward to Arras, Lens and Lille, to recreate a threat to the German northern flank, by moving through Arras to Cambrai and Le Cateau and from Lens to Valenciennes and Maubeuge. If the French occupied the area between Cambrai, Valenciennes, Maubeuge and Le Cateau, the German forces on the upper Somme, Oise and the Aisne would lose the use of the two main railways to Liege, although this would not be decisive, since the line from Laon to Vervins, Hirson, Charleroi, Namur and Liege and that from Laon to M√©zi√®res and Montm√©dy to either Luxemburg and Treves or Thionville and Metz, would still be available to the Germans. French moves to the north were also influenced by events in the siege of Antwerp, where Termonde fell on 26 September and increased the danger that the city and the Belgian army would be lost. The new Tenth Army was ordered to concentrate around Arras and Lens. =First Battle of Picardy= On 18 September, the Sixth Army advance was stopped on a south-east to north-west line at Carlepont on the south bank of the Oise and Noyon on the north bank, which ended the first French outflanking move. Joffre dissolved the Second Army in Lorraine and sent Castelnau and the Second Army headquarters to the north of the Sixth Army, to take over the IV and XIII corps, along with the 1st, 5th, 8th and 10th Cavalry divisions of the French II Cavalry Corps (General Louis Conneau) from the Sixth Army. The XIV Corps was transferred from the First Army and XX Corps from the original Second Army, to assemble south of Amiens, behind a screen of the 81st, 82nd, 84th and 88th Territorial divisions protecting French communications. The Second Army prepared to advance on 22 September, on a line from Lassigny northwards to Roye and Chaulnes, around the German flank. Next day, the German II Corps joined the right flank of the 1st Army, for an attack to the south- west with the IV Corps, IX Reserve Corps and the 4th and 7th cavalry divisions. B√ºlow, ordered Kluck to cancel the offensive and withdraw the two corps behind the right flank of the 1st Army. On 16 September, the 2nd and 9th Cavalry divisions were dispatched from the Aisne front as reinforcements but before the retirement began, the French XIII and IV corps on the left flank of Sixth Army, with the 61st and 62nd divisions of the 6th Group of Reserve Divisions, began to advance along the Oise and met the right flank of the 1st Army between Carlepont and Noyon on 17 September. On the right flank, the French 17th and 45th divisions attacked near Soissons and gained a foothold on the plateau of Cuffies, just north of the city. The First Battle of Picardy from was the first of the reciprocal outflanking attempts by the French and German armies after the First Battle of the Aisne and resulted in an encounter battle in Picardy. The French Sixth Army attacked up the Oise river valley towards Noyon, as the Second Army assembled further north, ready to advance round the northern flank of the German 1st Army. The Second Army crossed the Avre on a line from Lassigny northwards to Roye and Chaulnes but met the German II Corps from the 1st Army that had arrived from the Aisne front, where new entrenchments had enabled fewer men to garrison the front line. The corps moved into line on on the right flank of the IX Reserve Corps. Despite the assistance of four divisions of the II Cavalry Corps (Lieutenant-General Georg von der Marwitz), the Germans were pushed back to a line from Rib√©court to Lassigny and Roye, which menaced German communications through Ham and St. Quentin. On 21 September, the German XVIII Corps had begun a forced march from Reims and reached Ham on the evening of 23 September. On 24 September, the corps attacked towards Roye and with II Corps, forced back the French IV Corps of the Sixth Army. To the north, the Second Army reached P√©ronne and formed a bridgehead on the east bank of the Somme, which exhausted the offensive capacity of the Second Army. Joffre sent the XI Corps, the last French reserve, to the Second Army and began to withdraw three more corps for dispatch to the Second Army. On 25 September, a German attack near Noyon pushed back the Second Army. French reinforcements attacked again and from a general action took place along the Western Front from the Vosges to P√©ronne, after which the main effort of both sides took place further north. Battle =25‚Äì29 September= The offensive by the French Second Army forced Falkenhayn to divert the XXI and I Bavarian corps as soon as they arrived, to extend the front northwards from Chaulnes to P√©ronne on 24 September and drive the French back over the Somme. Overcrowded and damaged railways behind the German front slowed the transit of German forces and infantry marched from Namur and Cambrai. On 25 September, the German reinforcements attacked, crossed the Somme south of P√©ronne and then advanced to take a bridge between Hem and Feuill√®res. A French attack north of the Somme against the II Bavarian Corps, forced a hurried withdrawal. As more Bavarian units arrived in the north, the 3rd Bavarian Division advanced north of the Somme through Bouchavesnes, Leforest and Hardecourt until held up at Maricourt. The 4th Bavarian Division further to the north, defeated the French Territorials and then attacked westwards towards Albert, through Sailly, Combles, Guillemont and Montauban. On 27 September, the II Cavalry Corps drove back the 61st and 62nd Reserve divisions (General Joseph Brug√®re, d'Amade had been replaced), to make way for the XIV Reserve Corps to link with the right flank of the II Bavarian Corps, ready for an attack towards Albert. The French (General Louis de Maud'huy) began to assemble at Arras and de Maud'huy found that instead of making another attempt to get round the German flank, the was menaced by a German offensive. The II Bavarian and XIV Reserve corps pushed back a French Territorial division from the area around Bapaume and advanced towards Bray- sur-Somme and Albert, as part of the offensive down the Somme valley to reach the sea. The German offensive was confronted north of the Somme by the French XXI and X corps and the 81st, 82nd, 84th and 88th Territorial divisions (Brug√®re) further north and the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 10th Cavalry divisions of the II Cavalry Corps (General Louis Conneau), east of Albert. The XIV Reserve Corps attacked on 28 September, along the Roman road from Bapaume to Albert and Amiens, intending to reach the Ancre and then continue westwards along the Somme valley. The 28th Reserve Division advanced close to Fricourt, against scattered resistance from French infantry and cavalry. On 28 September, the French were able to stop the German advance, on a line from Maricourt to Fricourt and Thi√©pval. The German II Cavalry Corps, moved north but was held up near Arras, by the French II Cavalry Corps. On 29 September, the 28th Reserve Division attacked Fricourt and captured the village but was prevented by French small-arms and artillery-fire, from advancing beyond. North of the road, the 26th Reserve Division advance was also stopped by the French. Next day French units counter-attacked several times and almost recaptured Fricourt. A lull in the fighting occurred overnight and then both sides began to dig in haphazardly, where the opposing lines had stopped moving, which was not always on easily defended ground. At Maricourt, about to the south, the German advance had been stopped short of the village. North of the road, the 26th Reserve Division fought to capture the high ground of Bazentin Ridge, which overlooked the Ancre valley but instead of rolling up the French northern flank, was endangered by a reciprocal French attack. (The French attack reached Sapignies behind the right flank, until counter-attacked by the Guards Corps, which arrived at Bapaume on 2 October.) Joffre added X Corps, north of Amiens, the II Cavalry Corps, south-east of Arras and a provisional corps under General Victor d'Urbal, which had the 77th Reserve Division south- east of Arras and the 70th Reserve Division in Lens, to the which was renamed the Tenth Army, to make another outflanking move near Arras. Aftermath =Analysis= The French had been able to use the undamaged railways behind their front to move troops more quickly than the Germans, who had to take long detours, wait for repairs to damaged tracks and replace rolling stock. The French IV Corps moved from Lorraine on 2 September in and assembled by 6 September. The French had been able to move troops in up to per day and use hundreds of motor-vehicles, which were co-ordinated by two staff officers, Commandant G√©rard and Captain Doumenc. The French could also use Belgian and captured German rail wagons and the domestic telephone and telegraph systems. The initiative held by the Germans in August was not recovered and the troop movements to the right flank were piecemeal. Until the end of the Siege of Maubeuge only the single line from Trier to Li√®ge, Brussels, Valenciennes and Cambrai was available and had to be used to supply the German armies on the right as the 6th Army travelled in the opposite direction, limiting the army to forty trains a day, taking four days to move a corps. Information on German troop movements from wireless interception, enabled the French to forestall German moves but the Germans had to rely on reports from spies, which were frequently wrong. The French resorted to more cautious infantry tactics, using cover to reduce casualties and a centralised system of control as the German army commanders followed contradictory plans. The French did not need quickly to obtain a decisive result and could concentrate on conserving the French army. =Subsequent operations= On 30 September, a French division arrived at Arras and on 1 October was slowly pushed back from Gu√©mappe, Wancourt and Monchy-le-Preux until the arrival of X Corps. Two more French corps, three infantry and two cavalry divisions had been sent northwards to Amiens, Arras, Lens and Lille, which increased the Second Army to eight corps, along a front of . On 28 September, Falkenhayn had ordered the 6th Army to conduct an offensive on the existing northern flank by the IV, Guard and I Bavarian corps near Arras, and offensives further north. On 1 October, the French attacked to the south-east, expecting only a cavalry screen. Three German corps attacked from Arras to Douai on 1 October, forestalling the French. From costly German attacks were made on Beaurains, Mercatel and the Arras suburbs of St. Laurent- Blangy and St. Nicolas, which were repulsed and Lens fell. German attacks were made from the north of Arras to reach the Scarpe but were eventually repulsed by the X Corps. By 4 October, German troops had also reached Givenchy-en- Gohelle and on the right flank of the French to the south, several Territorial divisions were separated from X Corps. Joffre made Maud'huy's independent as the Tenth Army and told Castelnau to keep the Second Army in position, to wait while the increasing number of troops further north diverted German pressure. By 6 October, the Second Army front from the Oise to the Somme and the Tenth Army front from Thiepval to Gommecourt, Blaireville, the eastern fringe of Arras, Bailleul, Vimy and Souchez had been stabilised. The operation by the cavalry under Marwitz to the north of the 6th Army, had pushed back the French Territorial divisions to a line between Lens and Lille and on 5 October, Marwitz issued orders for the cavalry to advance westwards to Abbeville on the Channel coast and cut the railways leading south. At the end of 6 October, Falkenhayn terminated attempts by the 2nd Army to break through in Picardy. To the north, the I and II Cavalry corps attacked between Lens and Lille, were quickly repulsed and forced back behind the Lorette Spur. Next day the cavalry was attacked by the first troops of the French XXI Corps, advancing from B√©thune.

The three are much less about traditional skit or story based stand-up humor (which is common in Japanese comedy), choosing instead to focus on physical humor and a loud, boisterous style that resonates with most manzai audiences. They formed in 2001, and received their name from owarai kombi Masuda Okada's Kisuke Masuda in parody of the famous \\"Kinoshita Dai Circus\\". The group's name simply means \\"Great Yasuda Circus\\". The characters The group's uniqueness can be attributed to Danch≈ç, HIRO, and Kuro-chan's unconventional characters and strange manner. HIRO (real name Yasuyuki Hirose (Â∫ÉÁÄ¨Â∫∑Âπ∏), born April 20, 1977 in Wakayama) stands out as the huge, lumbering mass of the group, and his obesity-related difficulties are often the topic of the group's jokes. Notably, HIRO is said to look like a Japanese taiko when he smiles, and the lump of fatty skin on the back of his neck is often pointed out. As can be expected, he is also known for his large appetite, and is often called upon by variety shows to perform various feats of eating (Â§ßÈ£ü„ÅÑ). In particular he is known for being able to drink a 2-liter bottle of orange fanta in a mere 10 seconds. As de facto leader of the group, Danch≈ç (real name Hiromi Yasuda (ÂÆâÁî∞Ë£ïÂ∑±), born April 26, 1974 in Hy≈çgo) is probably the least notable character, though he often takes the center stage while performing the groups gags, and is prone to stripping down to his fundoshi (a traditional Japanese loincloth) at the end of every performance. Danch≈ç, who was previously a member of the failed group \\"Yasuda and Takeuchi\\", is also generally considered to be the tsukkomi of Yasuda Dai Circus. Kuro-chan (real name Akihiro Kurokawa (ÈªíÂ∑ùÊòé‰∫∫), born December 10, 1976 in Hiroshima) is fairly heavy-set, and has a tough look to him, but looks only go so far as he always speaks in a piercing falsetto. To further boost his image he often adopts feminine mannerisms and acts in a way that is often considered \\"cute\\" in Japanese culture. Kuro-chan is prone to lose his temper, as he is often taunted for his voice and odd demeanor, and fits into the traditional owarai role as boke. The jokes Though an essential part of their image, the trio's jokes are repetitive and predictable, and much more popular (though almost as predictable) is the ad libbed humour that is interjected between each of their gags. Some of the group's most well-known gags are: *D≈çn, d≈çn, d≈çn! Beta-betta! („Å©„Éº„ÇìÔºÅ„Å©„Éº„ÇìÔºÅ„Å©„Éº„ÇìÔºÅ„Éô„Çø„Éô„ÉÉ„Çø). Often chanted after a close-up on HIRO's smiling, sweaty face, this phrase could be said to be the \\"theme song\\" of the group. It basically means \\"Boom, boom, boom! Sweaty sweaty!\\"; boom being the sound a drum makes, as HIRO's face is said to look like a Japanese taiko when he smiles. *D≈çn, d≈çn, d≈çn! Nori-tsukkomi! Daiseik≈ç! („Å©„Éº„Çì!„Å©„Éº„Çì!„Å©„Éº„Çì! ‰πó„ÇäÁ™Å„Å£Ëæº„Åø! Â§ßÊàêÂäü!!). This chant, basically meaning \\"Boom, boom, boom! Self-tsukkomi! Big success!\\" refers to the way that the group often sets up their own jokes in a very obvious manner; a silly process called nori-tsukkomi. All gags of this type usually end with Danch≈ç marching around with arms straight out signaling a peace sign, while HIRO pumps his fists in the air and Kuro-chan throws confetti. *Ochi deesu! („Ç™„ÉÅ„Åß„Éº„ÅôÔºÅ). Their short konto (skits) usually end with Danch≈ç's breakaway suit being ripped off, revealing his fundoshi, and all members of the group shout Ochi deesu!, meaning \\"That's the punchline!\\". Media * In 2008, the Yasuda Dai Circus played Neo Terra's three Executives in Tomica Hero: Rescue Force. * In 2014, HIRO played Crush Roidmude in Kamen Rider Drive with Danch≈ç and Kuro-Chan as his Roidmude lackeys. * In K-tai Investigator 7.

A Scottish regiment is any regiment (or similar military unit) that at some time in its history has or had a name that referred to Scotland or some part, thereof, and adopted items of Scottish dress. These regiments were created after the Acts of Union in 1707 between England and Scotland, either directly serving Britain during its various wars, or as part of the military establishments of Commonwealth countries. Their \\"Scottishness\\" is no longer necessarily due to recruitment in Scotland nor any proportion of members of Scottish ancestry. Traditionally, Scottish regiments cultivate a reputation of exceptional fierceness in combat and are often given romantic portrayals in popular media. Within Scotland, itself, regiments of the Scottish Lowlands did not adopt as distinctively \\"Scottish\\" (specifically Scottish Highland) uniforms until the late Victorian Era and even then the kilt, that most distinctive aspect of the Highland soldier, was not adopted wholesale. History =Lowland regiments= These generally predate the more widely known Highland regiments (see below). The senior Lowland regiment was the Royal Scots (the Royal Regiment) which dates from 1633. The Royal Scots Fusiliers and the King's Own Scottish Borderers were subsequently raised in 1678 and 1689 respectively. Throughout the 17th, 18th and most of the 19th centuries these Scottish regiments served widely and with distinction. They did not however differ significantly in appearance or public perception from the bulk of the line infantry of the British Army. In 1881 the introduction of the Cardwell system of reforms provided the opportunity to adopt a modified form of Scottish dress for the Lowland regiments. Comprising doublets and tartan trews this gave the Lowlanders a distinctive identity, separate from their English, Welsh, Irish and Highland counterparts.W.Y.Carman, pages 146 & 152, \\"British Military Uniforms From Contemporary Pictures\\" At the same time, the absence of kilts (except for pipers) and the substitution of Kilmarnock bonnets for feather bonnets prevented confusion between Lowlanders and their Highland counterparts. The Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) was created at the same time from the merging of two existing numbered regiments.Major R.M. Barnes, \\"The Uniforms and History of the Scottish Regiments\\", page 282, Sphere Books 1972 =Highland regiments= Depiction of a Highland soldier in 1801. The original Highland regiments were raised in the 18th century with the object of recruiting rank and file solely from the Scottish Highlands. However, due to the Highlands becoming extensively depopulated through the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, the Highland regiments of the British Army have witnessed a long-term decline in the proportion of recruits from the Highlands and have long recruited many Lowland Scots and others. The major 20th century exceptions to this rule were the First and Second World Wars, when many Highland men joined up. Around the time that the first Highland regiments were raised the Highlands had recently been a hotbed for several revolts against the establishment, namely the Jacobite Rebellions, so the loyalties of the Highlanders were often deemed suspect in the early history of the Highland regiments. The first Highland regiment, the Black Watch was originally raised from clans openly loyal to the status quo in order for the government to better police the Highlands, which were deemed to be both rebellious and lawless by the contemporary British establishment. However, due to a pressing need for personnel in North America during the Seven Years' War, William Pitt the Elder made the decision to raise new Highland regiments to fight in this global conflict. The war ended in victory and among other things, Canada was secured as a part of the British Empire, while the British East India Company's position in India was consolidated and expanded, both at the expense of the French. These Highland regiments were disbanded after the war, but other Highland regiments were raised later and, like the rest of the British Army, saw service in various wars including in the Napoleonic Wars. Depiction of The Thin Red Line at the Battle of Balaclava. Highland regiments played a conspicuous role in conflicts throughout the Victorian era. By the Victorian era the loyalty of the Highlanders was no longer suspect. Queen Victoria had a personal interest in things Scottish, in particular relating to the Highlands. In addition Highland regiments had played a conspicuous role in such Victorian conflicts as the Crimean War and the putting down of the Indian Mutiny. The Highland regiments earned a reputation which influenced the mindset of those Scottish regiments which were Lowland in origin. This resulted in the wearing of tartan by Lowland regiments which had previously worn uniforms not clearly distinguishable from their Irish, Welsh and English counterparts. In the case of the Highland Light Infantry, the distinction between Highlanders and Lowlanders was slightly blurred: although classified as a non-kilted Highland regiment it was recruited from Glasgow in Lowland Scotland and bore the title of \\"City of Glasgow Regiment\\". Scottish bagpipes have been adopted in a number of countries, largely in imitation of the pipers of Highland regiments which served throughout the British Empire. Highland regiments were raised in a number of Commonwealth armies, often adopting formal honorary affiliations with Scottish regiments of the British Army.

It is assigned to the 354th Fighter Wing, being stationed at Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska. It was reactivated in 2019 to operate the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II. The squadron was first activated during World War II and flew the North American P-51 Mustang on escort missions for Eighth Air Force bombers over western Europe from mid-1943. With IX Fighter Command, it was re-equipped with the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt in early 1944 and flew ground attack missions until the end of the war. It was reactivated in 1956 and became the 356th Tactical Fighter Squadron, flying the North American F-100 Super Sabre. It was deployed to Misawa Air Base in Japan between 1965 and 1971, and after a brief inactivation was reactivated at Myrtle Beach Air Force Base. The squadron fought in the Gulf War, equipped with the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II, and was inactivated in 1992 after briefly returning to its original designation. History =World War II= Activated on 15 November 1942 at Hamilton Field, California, initially equipped with P-39 Airacobras and assigned to IV Fighter Command for training. Moved to several bases in California and Nevada then to Portland Army Air Base, Oregon, in June 1943 and re-equipped with new P-51B Mustangs. Transitioned to the Mustang throughout the summer of 1943 the deployed to the European Theater of Operations (ETO), being assigned to IX Fighter Command in England. In late 1943, the strategic bombardment campaign over Occupied Europe and Nazi Germany being conducted by VIII Bomber Command was taking heavy losses in aircraft and flight crews as the VIII Fighter Command's P-38 Lightnings and P-47 Thunderbolts lacked the range to escort the heavy B-17 Flying Fortress and B-24 Liberator bombers deep into Germany to attack industrial and military targets. The P-51 had the range to perform the escort duties and the unit's operational control was transferred to Headquarters, Eighth Air Force to perform escort missions. From its base at RAF Boxted, the unit flew long-range strategic escort missions with VIII Bomber Command groups, escorting the heavy bombers to targets such as Frankfurt, Leipzig, Augsburg, and Schweinfurt, engaging Luftwaffe day interceptors frequently, with the P-51s outperforming the German Bf 109 and Fw 190 interceptors, causing heavy losses to the Luftwaffe. Remained under operational control of Eighth Air Force until April 1944, when sufficient numbers of P-51D Mustangs and arrived from the United States and were assigned to VIII Fighter Command units for escort duty. Was relieved from escort duty and was re-equipped with P-47D Thunderbolts, and reassigned to RAF Lashenden on the southern coast of England. Mission was redefined to provide tactical air support for the forthcoming invasion of France, to support the Third, and later Ninth United States Armies. Flew fighter sweeps over Normandy and along the English Channel coast of France and the Low Countries, April‚ÄìJune 1944, then engaged in heavy tactical bombing of enemy military targets as well as roads, railroads and bridges in the Normandy area to support ground forces in the immediate aftermath of D-Day. Moved to Advanced Landing Grounds in France beginning at the end of June, 1944, moving eastwards to combat airfields and liberated French airports supporting Allied Ground forces as the advanced across Northern France. Later, in 1944, the squadron became involved in dive- bombing and strafing missions, striking railroad yards, bridges, troop concentrations, and airfields. Participated in attacks on German forces in Belgium in the aftermath of the Battle of the Bulge, then moved eastward as part of the Western Allied invasion of Germany. The squadron flew its last mission of the war on 7 May 1945 from the captured Luftwaffe airfield at Ansbach (R-45). Remained in Occupied Germany as part of the United States Air Forces in Europe XII Tactical Air Command occupying force after the German Capitulation, being stationed at AAF Station Herzogenaurach. Was inactivated on 31 March 1946. =Cold War= Reactivated by Tactical Air Command, United States Air Force on 19 November 1956, being assigned to the reactivated 354th Fighter-Day Group at the new Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, South Carolina. Equipped with North American F-100 Super Sabre fighters, the squadron participated in exercises, operations, tests, and firepower demonstrations conducted by the Tactical Air Command within the US and abroad. The unit frequently deployed to Aviano Air Base, Italy and Wheelus Air Base, Libya. Was deployed to Europe during the 1958 Lebanon crisis and was moved to McCoy AFB, Florida in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis. =Korean duty= During the Vietnam War, the unit was deployed to Misawa Air Base, Japan on 16 March 1965. At Misawa, it was assigned to the 39th Air Division, whose mission was to support Misawa, Taegu Air Base and Kunsan Air Base in South Korea which all had just been reactivated. From Misawa, aircraft and personnel of the 356th rotated six F-100D aircraft every ten days to Kunsan and Taegu performing Nuclear alert duty. The 356th was on a TDY status to Misawa AB until 13 August 1965 when it was permanently reassigned to the 39th AD. In August 1967, the F-100's were sent to Vietnam as replacement aircraft and the 356 TFS converted to the F-4 Phantom II.USAFHRA Document 00470754 On 15 January 1968, the 475th Tactical Fighter Wing was activated at Misawa and took over as host unit from the 39th Air Division. On 23 January 1968, as a response to the capture by the North Koreans of the USS Pueblo, the 356 TFS was immediately dispatched to Kunsan. For a week, the 356 TFS was the only deterrent at Kunsan until the 4th Tactical Fighter Wing was deployed from Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, NC and took over alert duties. When the 354 TFW became the permanent host unit at Kunsan AB in July 1968, the 356th was NOT assigned to its 354th TFW host unit at Myrtle Beach AFB. At Kunsan, the 356 TFS was part of Detachment 1, 475th Tactical Fighter Wing, which was a separate operating unit. On 15 March 1971, the 3d Tactical Fighter Wing replaced the 475 TFW at Misawa and absorbed its assets. The 356 TFS was inactivated and the squadron was reassigned back to the 354 TFW at Myrtle Beach AFB. =Post-Vietnam era= Returning to Myrtle Beach AFB in 1971, the unit was re-equipped with A-7D Corsair II fighter- bombers. From 1971-1977 the squadron remained at Myrtle Beach AFB and became a LIFT Training Squadron, not being on operational deployment status, supporting the 353d and 355th Tactical Fighter Squadrons which were deployed to Thailand for combat operations, 1972‚Äì1974, and to NATO bases in Germany (1975‚Äì1976). Frequently interchanged personnel with the provisional 4554th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron assigned to the 354th at Myrtle Beach. The 356th Tactical Fighter Squadron was re-equipped with the Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II in 1977, and on 1 July 1977 was the first squadron in the USAF to be declared operationally ready with the A-10.USAFHRA Document 01027768 The unit deployed to King Fahd International Airport, Saudi Arabia 15 August 1990. During Desert Storm, the squadron engaged in combat operations, January‚ÄìFebruary 1991, inflicting heavy damage to enemy armor and artillery emplacements, cut off enemy supply lines, and engaged in search and rescue operations. Returned to the United States in March 1991, and returned to peacetime training operations. Immediately began phasing down with the designated BRAC 1990 closure of Myrtle Beach AFB and the pending inactivation of its host Wing. The squadron's aircraft were dispersed, being reassigned to Air National Guard and other active Air Force Fighter Squadrons throughout the balance of 1991 and early 1992. The squadron was inactivated 10 June 1992. The squadron was reactivated on 10 October 2019 at Eielson Air Force Base, assigned to the 354th Operations Group. It is to be equipped with the F-35A Lightning II. =Lineage= * Constituted 356th Fighter Squadron 12 November 1942. : Activated 15 November 1942. : Inactivated 31 March 1946. * Redesignated 356th Fighter-Day Squadron 28 September 1956. : Activated 19 November 1956. : Redesignated 356th Tactical Fighter Squadron 1 July 1958. : Redesignated 356th Fighter Squadron 1 November 1991 : Inactivated 10 June 1992 : Activated 10 October 2019 =Assignments= * 354th Fighter Group, 12 November 1942 ‚Äì 31 March 1946 * 354th Fighter-Day Group, 19 November 1956 * 354th Fighter-Day (later, Tactical Fighter) Wing, 25 September 1957 * 39th Air Division, 29 November 1965 * 475th Tactical Fighter Wing, 15 January 1968 : Attached to: Detachment 1 or Detachment 2, 475th Tactical Fighter Wing, 15 January 1968 ‚Äì 15 March 1971 :: Attachments were for 10-day periods, rotating every 30 days * 3d Tactical Fighter Wing, 15 March 1971 * 354th Tactical Fighter (later, Fighter) Wing, 15 May 1971 ‚Äì 10 June 1992 * 354th Operations Group, 10 October 2019 - =Stations= * Hamilton AAF, California, 15 November 1942 * Tonapah AAF, Nevada, 20 January 1943 * Salem AAF, Oregon, 3 June ‚Äì 6 October 1943 * RAF Greenham Common, England, 4 November 1943 * RAF Boxted, England, 13 November 1943 * RAF Lashenden, England, c. 14 April 1944 * Cricqueville-en- Bessin, France (ALG A-2), c. 18 June 1944 * Ga√´l, France (ALG A-31), 14 August 1944 * Orconte, France (ALG A-66), 21 September 1944 : Operated from Saint- Dizier/Robinson, France (ALG A-64), c. 18 November ‚Äì 1 December 1944 * Rosieres en Haye, France (ALG A-98), 1 December 1944 * Mainz-Finthen Airdrome (ALG Y-64), Ober-Olm, Germany, c. 4 April 1945 * Ansbach Airdrome, Germany (ALG R-82), 1 May 1945 * Herzogenaurach Airdrome, Germany (ALG R-29), c. 15 May 1945 ‚Äì 15 February 1946 * Bolling Field, Washington, D.C., 15 February ‚Äì 31 March 1946 * Myrtle Beach AFB, South Carolina, 19 November 1956 ‚Äì 29 November 1965 : Rotational 90-day deployments to Aviano AB, Italy and Incirlik AB, Turkey 1958‚Äì1966 : Deployed to: McCoy AFB, Florida, 21 October ‚Äì 1 December 1962 (Cuban Missile Crisis) : Deployed to: Misawa AB, Japan, 13 August ‚Äì 29 November 1965 * Misawa AB, Japan, 29 November 1965 ‚Äì 15 May 1971 : Deployed to: Kunsan AB, South Korea, January 1968 ‚Äì March 1971 (Rotational deployment for a 10-day period every 30 days) : Deployed to: Tageu AB, South Korea, July 1968 ‚Äì April 1970 (Rotational deployment for a 10-day period every 30 days) : Not equipped or manned, 15 March ‚Äì 15 May 1971 * Myrtle Beach AFB, South Carolina, 15 May 1971 ‚Äì 10 June 1992 : Operated from King Fahd International Airport, Saudi Arabia, 15 August 1990 ‚Äì 2 August 1991 * Eielson AFB, Alaska, 10 October, 2019 - Survivor 56-3417, F-100D-86-NA painted in its original 356th TFS, 354th TFW colors Aircraft number 56-3417, F-100D-86-NA (formerly F-100D-85-NH), with High Wire Mods, is on display at Wings Over the Rockies Air and Space Museum, Denver, Colorado.

History Although the exact date for foundation of PCBC is unclear, the club was competing in Eights and Torpids as early as 1842 and had adopted its modern-day flag with the \\"Rose Gules\\" (Red Rose) taken from the Pembroke heraldic shield by 1846. Amongst the giants in PCBC history, two leading Pembroke oarsmen of the 1870‚Äì1873 period were the three times President of the Oxford University Boat Club, Robert Lesley, who came up from Radley College and R S Mitchison, an old Etonian. Rowing historians indicate that sliding seats were first used during the Fours racing at Oxford in 1872 by PCBC and that ‚Äúthe new system of sliding seats was first used in Oxford by Lesley‚Äôs crew and also by the College (Pembroke) Eight at Henley ‚Äú.W E Sherwood, p. Pembroke were the first known crew to use seats with wheels.Burnell, Swing Together, Thoughts on Rowing, OUP, Oxford, 1952 In the club minutes it is recorded that the Pembroke crew were the pioneers of the sliding seat at Oxford, using it in the Fours before they left for Henley, and of the seat with wheels for the first time worldwide.It would seem that the Pembroke College Boat Club Minutes provide reliable original source evidence of the truth of the statement DoddHenley Royal Regatta, 1981 states that London Rowing Club and Pembroke were the first to use the sliding seat at Henley. Pembroke‚Äôs win of the Visitors‚Äô Cup at Henley has been described as \\"one of the best races of the whole Regatta\\".Jackson‚Äôs Oxford Journal, 1872 Pembroke won by approximately half a length from University College Dublin, who were using fixed seats. The Dublin crew were regarded as one of the best ever sent to Henley. What is also significant is that Pembroke were using wheels, which were soon discarded by boat builders in favour of greased glass or steel grooves or tubes, but wheels were to return to favour again in 1885. Pembroke then, were not only early adopters of the sliding seat, ahead of others in Oxford, but also pioneers in terms of the materials being used, as they anticipated the later wheeled models of sliding seats which did not become current until 1885 and remain until the modern day. =Modern day= In 2003, Pembroke achieved a historic victory in the Oxford Summer Eights competition by becoming the first college to win the 'Double Headship', having both men's and women's first boats end the week at the 'Head of the River'. Double Headship has yet to be repeated by any college in the Summer Eights competition, although the competitive years since 2003 has seen both men's and women's boats remain within striking distance of the Head of the River with the women regaining headship in 2018. Consistent ambition to go Head has been the goal: the Men's First Summer Eight (M1) has remained within the top 5 since 1992http://www.atm.ox.ac.uk/rowing/bumps/pemb/pemb_me.html and within the top 3 during that time in all years except 2008. In 2013, the 1st VIII bumped Oriel to regain the Head of the River whilst the First Torpid also retained the Torpids Headship. PCBC is supported by the Friends of PCBC who strive to support rowers at all levels, particularly through their scholarship programme. PCBC also has a strong current record in external regattas: M1 placed 42nd in the HORR in 2012 and competed in the Temple Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta in 2006, 2012 and 2017. =Rivalries= Although tension began to ease off as of 2006, Pembroke and Oriel College, historically two of the best performing crews of the past 30 years, have had a strong and at times heated rivalry. In 2009, Pembroke's Eights M1 achieved a particularly emphatic bump on Oriel, further fuelling the rivalry. The rivalry remains fierce. St Edmund Hall Boat Club, whose boat house is adjacent to that of Pembroke, are also rivals, particularly on the women's side. The traditional Pembroke rivalry with Christ Church permeates to rowing as well. Recent strong performances at the Fairbairn's Cup in Cambridge and the Oxford vs Cambridge College race at Henley Boat Races has led to new rivalries with some Cambridge colleges such as First and Third Trinity Boat Club and Caius Boat Club. Pembroke became the first male Oxford college crew to win the Fairbairn Cup in 2014, an achievement they repeated in 2015. Facilities =Equipment= The club has a reputation for good equipment and coaching. The men's side of the club has three Empacher VIIIs (2008, 2003, 1994), two Janouseks (2000, 1990) and a Sims. The top women had a Stampfli VIII (2005) which was written off at the Women's Eights Head of the River Race 2007 after being crashed into Putney Bridge. This has now been replaced and was used by the Women's 1st VIII to gain blades from the bottom of Division I in Torpids 2008. They also have an Eton Phoenix (1996), a Janousek and an Aylings. In small boats the club maintains a fleet of one Empacher coxless four (2008), three Janousek coxed- fours, a Janousek coxless-pair and a single scull. In addition there are two Eton coaching launches for the men's and women's 1st VIIIs. In general the top boats are replaced every four years, with purchases alternating between men and women every two years. Pembroke has a gymnasium at the boat house and is one of a very limited number of clubs to possess a fleet of 20 Concept D ergos which are situated adjacent to the weights gymnasium. =Coaching= Recent coaches have included Ben Lewis, current Thames Rowing Club coach; GB coach Rob Dauncey and GB lightweights Chris Bartley and Simon Jones, and John Gearing (former-South African international and Master in Charge of Rowing at Radley College). The college has also recently created one of the only permanent college coaching staff positions in Oxford to further increase the quality of its training system. The first coach to take this position on was Barrie-Jon Mulder, from 2011‚Äì2014. He was succeeded by Rory Copus for the 2014/2015 season, whilst the current coach is James Scott. =Training locations= Novice and development crews train on the local Isis river by the boathouse but senior crews train further afield. In recent years both the men and women's senior squads have trained at Radley College's boat house. In the past, senior crews have trained at St Edward's boathouse, Abingdon School's boat house and Wallingford. Results Isis during VIIIs Week 2007. In 2013, for the first time since 1903, the M1 Torpid maintained its Headship with female double Olympic gold medallist Caryn Davies at stroke. The Women's First Eight was the first to gain Headship from a mixed college in 2000 and held that position for four straight years;http://www.atm.ox.ac.uk/rowing/bumps/pemb/pemb_we.html they are Head of the River again in 2012. In 2015 the Women's 1st VIII bumped up from 4th to 2nd on the river and was clearly the fastest boat on the river, closing down on Wadham on the Friday and Saturday to gain the Headship, but eventually missed out by less than half of a length. In 2018 they bumped Wadham easily on the Wednesday and successfully held them off for the remaining days of the campaign. Lower down in the club, Pembroke's development program is one of the most successful in Oxford College Rowing, and has produced more Blues in the last 10 years than any other college. This is indicated by the high placing of all PCBC crews; M2 previously in Division 1 was the only 2nd boat crew placed in the first 2 divisions in Torpids, as 11th crew on the river. Pembroke's 2nd Men's Summer VIII is also one of the highest ranked 2nd VIII in VIIIs Week. =Headships= Eights * Men: 1872, 1995, 2003, 2013 * Women: 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2012, 2018 Torpids * Men: 1858, 1877, 1878, 1879, 1999, 2000 (No racing), 2012, 2013, 2014 (No racing), 2015, 2016, 2017 =Henley Royal Regatta= Stewards' Challenge Cup * 1854 Ladies' Challenge Plate * 1852, 1871 Thames Challenge Cup * 1868 Wyfold Challenge Cup * 1857 Visitors' Challenge Cup * 1857, 1872 See also *University rowing (UK) References * External links *PCBC website *Oxford University Rowing Clubs *Friends of PCBC Rowing clubs of the University of Oxford Boat Club 1842 establishments in England Sports clubs established in 1842 Rowing clubs in Oxfordshire Rowing clubs of the River Thames ","title":"Pembroke College Boat Club (Oxford)"},{"id":"4320567","text":"John Crace may refer to: *John Dibblee Crace (1838‚Äì1919), British interior designer *John Gregory Crace (designer) (1809‚Äì1889), British interior designer *Sir John Gregory Crace (1887‚Äì1968), British rear admiral *John Crace (writer), British journalist and critic ","title":"John Crace"},{"id":"4320575","text":"Radio Limerick One, also called Limerick 95FM and RLO at times, was the licensed radio station serving Limerick city and county. Licensed by the Independent Radio and Television Commission in 1989, its licence was removed in 1996 for misbehaviour, although the station did not leave the airwaves. It was eventually replaced by Limerick's Live 95FM as the licensed operator. History The station started broadcasting in October 1989 from studios in Dooradoyle, Limerick. Its early days were the most memorable as the station had separate radio shows covering about 20 different topics; given Limerick's tradition for a multitude of high-quality pirates covering a wide range of tastes, having a single station to cater for everybody was a task, but one which RLO took to, assisted by the talents of some of those former pirates. Initially the main presenters at the station were John Ryan, Dr. John Moloney, Declan Copues, Pamela Wilson, Francis Jones and Ger Bradshaw. \\"Stereo 95 FM, Radio Limerick One\\" was how one of their main jingles used to go, with the station's catchphrase, \\"Closer to You\\", being the main thrust in the promotion of the station to a community that had been starved of local, non-Dublin- focussed radio. Due to falling ratings the station rebranded itself as Limerick 95FM and moved to 100 O'Connell St. in the centre of Limerick city, around 1992. Changes in ownership occurred through the years as well. During this period, the station became among the first Irish radio stations to transmit via satellite - a service called \\"Ireland's Overnight Network\\", allowing other stations to air its generic overnight content in order to operate 24 hours a day without relying on automated playlists. Irish Satellite Radio Limerick 95FM also had a sister station for a time called Irish Satellite Radio broadcast via Astra 1B on frequency 11538 V. The station was on the VH1 TV channel transponder using the analogue transmission system known as Panda. It featured a different schedule, programs and news than the Local variant but at times would simulcast with Limerick 95FM for special events. The Astra satellite allowed the station to broadcast to Europe and parts of North Africa. ISR was popular with listeners around the world including ex-pats who enjoyed listening to another Irish radio station, an alternative to RT√â Radio 1, which incidentally also broadcast from the same transponder. Both the UK and Germany in particular tuned into Astra 1 transmissions due to their respective countries subscription TV packages emanating from the bird. Thus Irish satellite radio picked up a large audience from subscribers to the Sky UK service or indeed people who had installed free-to-air satellite equipment. Several prominent satellite TV listings magazines including Satellite Times and What Satellite TV listed the stations program schedule every month. Pirate operation In controversial circumstances which would see court actions continuing into the next century, the station lost its license in 1998. However, it continued broadcasting through its UK legal licence on satellite; this was deflected by unknown community groups back on to the fm band. Its satellite license was removed in 1999 by the Radio Authority in the UK (who had issued it) due to intervention by the then IRTC in Ireland; it was now also broadcasting on the internet worldwide and this source was now deflected again providing a continuous FM broadcast until the Comreg clamp-downs on pirate broadcasting in the early 2000s, and had continued rebroadcasting after many raids. During the pirate years Radio Limerick One continued to operate as it did when it was a licensed station. News bulletins were broadcast hourly by the newsroom staff such as Anne O' Grady, Trevor Anderson, Mary Beth Henschel and Aodhan Halligan with night time reports from UK commercial service IRN. Local obituaries were also read several times a day by the on-air presenter. RLO also had a dedicated sports team headed up by the then GAA PRO John Ryan and including Keith Fitzpatrick and Dominic Fitzgerald. Local Gaelic Athletic Association matches were broadcast during season on Sundays using professional outside broadcast equipment where permitted. The station had a full schedule of programming from 7am-1am. In the Morning, the breakfast show featured a mix of classic hits, news, weather and travel reports and some chat with presenters such as John Moloney, Frank Carberry, Sean Griffin and Eric Clarke. This was followed in the afternoon with a lean towards Oldies/M.O.R/Country music often presented by Ger Bradshaw, formerly of Limerick 95fm, Darren Moloney and Fergus Hannan. Drive-time and evenings featured a 60s/70s/80s music mix over the years including Francis Jones, Fintan Moloney and many others like Enda Caldwell with RLX a Top 40 / Alternative version of RLO and Eric Murphy with Lovesongs. The night time hours of RLO typically featured chat shows. The \\"Late and Live\\" show was a phone in program made popular by Gerry Hannan. Uniquely the show had little or no telephone screening process thus meaning most anyone could get on the air. This led to some controversial incidents over the years and the show was infamous for its \\"anything goes\\" approach. During overnight hours non-stop classic hits were played and in the latter years the \\"Late and Live\\" program would be repeated throughout the night. In 2002, it applied for, was refused, and appealed to no effect a license to operate a medium wave service in the city of Limerick The license was won by a group chaired by Joe Harrington, a former RLO presenter and ironically never went on air. During its period as a pirate, much use has been made of the Radio Data System to provide politically loaded messages to users with suitable equipment, ranging from \\"NO RLO NO VOTE\\" during a protest at the 2002 Irish General Election to \\"HELP RLO STOP BCI SLEEZE\\", a message of such length as to require scrolling. This only provoked more raids and court cases. By late 2005 the station was under the management of Gerry Hannan who also resumed his late night talk show. The studio was moved to his local book shop. After a Comreg raid on 13 December 2006, the station never returned. The engineers and 'community groups' are now busy working on other projects. Current owner Gerry Hannan announced he intended to go the legal route of IP broadcasting online. This involved broadcasting by web, anyone with a wireless router and broadband service could buy a WI-FI radio and tune in legally. However, the service was short lived and RLO has remained off air since. Notable former presenters from the pirate incarnation of RLO to subsequently work on other radio stations include Francis Jones on Radio Kerry as well as John Moloney and Sean Buckley who are both now on Tipperary Mid west radio and Enda Caldwell now at Pulse 87 in New York. Mary Beth Henschel was Live 95FM's Executive Producer for its talk show Limerick Today for a short time. She then moved on to RT√â's Lyric FM station in Limerick. Colm Mcgrath is in Cork and Padraig Gallagher on Newstalk. Fintan Moloney founded a variety of Internet-based stations & now provides mixes for Spin South West FM & presents on Party 934 in the U.S. Throughout the years some of the Live95fm presenters and staff worked for RLO. Other programs include comedy legend Tom O'Donnell (Dear Hearts and Gentle People), Fr. Cletus Noone (Noone at Night), Tony Browne (Local History show), Frank Carberry (The Politics Show), Darren Moloney (American and Irish country, Classic Love, Top 40 show), Fergus Hannon (Saturday Sportsbeat), Fintan Moloney (Solid Gold Sunday), Eric Murphy (Pillow Talk) and Sean Buckley (Buckley's People). RLO TV Gerard Madden also operated a local TV station under the name RLO TV. The station was initially broadcast from the Sirius satellite commencing in 1997 and also transmitted in later years via Hot Bird on the frequency 12.597 GHz. Free satellite equipment was offered to pubs and establishments around the city and county to facilitate reception of Ireland's first digital television channel. The satellite incarnation of the channel featured a schedule that was looped every few hours with pre-recorded programs presented by several staff from the radio station. The broadcast was uplinked from London, a staff member flew each day with a new tape to play every morning and flew home again. Programs included the Sean Buckley fronted \\"Buckleys people\\" with regular chat style interviews featuring local dignitaries and \\"Dr. John's Diaries\\" presented by breakfast show host John Moloney. Many other programs were featured on the schedule at this time including recorded coverage of Local Gaelic Athletic Association games often unseen on other channels, Irish music video showcases and other general entertainment fare all produced in house at the RLO studios. After a brief period broadcasting from Hot Bird, satellite transmissions ceased in late 1999. Upon obtaining several licenses to deflect UK terrestrial TV stations to the county area of the region, the station began broadcasting on UHF Channel 51 from Woodcock Hill to Limerick city. This was linked directly to the main studio and live broadcasting could begin. Gerry Hannan's \\"Late & Live\\" radio programme was broadcast live on TV showing the radio studio. Provisions were being sought to set up equipment at prominent 'guests' private houses to broadcast live from, but this never came to light. Live production began on the second floor and the radio was suppressed on one channel to up-link to the hill-sites. There were two other transmission sites at Newcastlewest and Knockfierna intended for reception in the county. Superimposing background images of limerick on green screens with high end technology began on the Gerry Hannan, Tom O'Donnell and History show. Lighting, sound, vision and transmission were all handled in-house. Staff were trained with high end digital editing suites and high resolution camera's for the time. At night time Channel 5 was rebroadcast between RLO TV shows. Broadcasts were usually between 22:00 and 01:00 with the frequency reverting to Channel 5 straight after the local broadcast had ended. During this period, a live element was introduced. Cameras were set up in the Radio Limerick one studio and joint TV/Radio simulcasts began. Programs that were featured in this live format included Gerry Hannan Late and Live, The Tom O' Donnell show, The History show and John Ryan's regular GAA special, broadcast both in and out of studio usually titled \\"Up for the final\\". After an ODTR raid in 2001 the radio and TV equipment were seized and the channel never returned. Previous staff from RLO TV included Mary Beth Henschel, Bridget O'Grady, Keith Fitzpatrick, Mark Dempsey,Valerie Nolan, Dominic Fitzgerald, Colm McGrath, Eric Murphy, Enda Caldwell, Darren Moloney, Anne O Grady, Fintan Moloney, Dale Clancy and Simon McGuire.

The 353rd Combat Training Squadron is a United States Air Force training squadron responsible for Exercise RED FLAG ‚Äì ALASKA held annually in Alaska. Overview All the activities on Alaska‚Äôs three weapons training ranges ‚Äì incorporating more than 68,000 square miles (180,000 km¬≤) of airspace, 28 threat systems, and 225 targets for range and exercise operations ‚Äì are planned and controlled by 353rd CTS personnel. The three tactical ranges supervised by the squadron‚Äôs range division are Blair Lakes, Yukon and Oklahoma. The Blair Lakes Conventional Range is located about 26 miles southwest of Eielson AFB. Isolated in a sub-Arctic tundra environment, this range is manned continuously and is normally accessible only by helicopter. The Yukon Tactical and Electronic Warfare Range is 15 miles (24 km) east of Eielson. Accessible most of the year, this mountainous complex is only manned as necessary to provide electronic warfare training. The Oklahoma Tactical Range is located within the U.S. Army's Cold Region Test Center at Fort Greely, Alaska, and is the largest of the three ranges, encompassing more than 900,000 acres (3,600 km¬≤) of relatively flat, open terrain. Cope Thunder exercises take place over Alaskan and Canadian airspace. The airspace ‚Äì 17 permanent military operations areas and high-altitude training areas, plus two restricted areas ‚Äì total more than 68,000 square miles (180,000 km¬≤). Cope Thunder‚Äôs economic impact on the communities surrounding Eielson and Elmendorf AFBs have been large and should continue to be so. In 2001 alone, military members taking part in the exercises poured more than $2 million into the local economies. Eielson AFB building projects resulting all or in part from Cope Thunder include a $23 million transient personnel facility, a $13 million Cope Thunder operations building, a $35 million air-to-air tracking system; eight two-bay all-weather aircraft shelters valued at $25 million, and a $2 million range microwave link. Additionally, the number of threat emitters on Cope Thunder ranges was doubled from 14 to 28 and several of the communication systems between ranges and Eielson have been upgraded. History =World War II= Activated on 15 November 1942 at Hamilton Field, California, initially equipped with Bell P-39 Airacobras and assigned to IV Fighter Command for training. Moved to several bases in California and Nevada then to Portland Army Air Base, Oregon in June 1943 and re-equipped with new North American P-51B Mustangs. Transitioned to the Mustang throughout the summer of 1943 the deployed to the European Theater of Operations, being assigned to IX Fighter Command in England. In late 1943, the strategic bombardment campaign over Occupied Europe and Nazi Germany being conducted by VIII Bomber Command was taking heavy losses in aircraft and flight crews as the VIII Fighter Command's Lockheed P-38 Lightnings and Republic P-47 Thunderbolts lacked the range to escort the heavy Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers deep into Germany to attack industrial and military targets. The P-51 had the range to perform the escort duties and the unit's operational control was transferred to Eighth Air Force to perform escort missions. From its base at RAF Boxted, the unit flew long-range strategic escort missions with VIII Bomber Command groups, escorting the heavy bombers to targets such as Frankfurt, Leipzig, Augsburg, and Schweinfurt, engaging Luftwaffe day interceptors frequently, with the P-51s outperforming the German Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Focke-Wulf Fw 190 interceptors, causing heavy losses to the Luftwaffe. Remained under operational control of Eighth Air Force until April 1944, when sufficient numbers of P-51D Mustangs and arrived from the United States and were assigned to VIII Fighter Command units for escort duty. Was relieved from escort duty and was re-equipped with Republic P-47D Thunderbolts, and moved to RAF Lashenden on the southern coast of England. Mission was redefined to provide tactical air support for the forthcoming invasion of France, to support the Third, and later Ninth United States Armies. Flew fighter sweeps over Normandy and along the English Channel coast of France and the Low Countries, April‚ÄìJune 1944, then engaged in heavy tactical bombing of enemy military targets as well as roads, railroads and bridges in the Normandy area to support ground forces in the immediate aftermath of D-Day. Moved to Advanced Landing Grounds in France beginning at the end of June 1944, moving eastwards to combat airfields and liberated French airports supporting Allied Ground forces as the advanced across Northern France. Later, in 1944, the squadron became involved in dive-bombing and strafing missions, striking railroad yards, bridges, troop concentrations, and airfields. Participated in attacks on German forces in Belgium]in the aftermath of the Battle of the Bulge, then moved eastward as part of the Western Allied invasion of Germany. The squadron flew its last mission of the war on 7 May 1945 from the captured Ansbach Airfield. Remained in Occupied Germany as part of the United States Air Forces in Europe XII Tactical Air Command occupying force after the German Capitulation, being stationed at AAF Station Herzogenaurach. Was inactivated on 31 March 1946. =Cold War= Reactivated by Tactical Air Command, United States Air Force on 19 November 1956, being assigned to the reactivated 354th Fighter-Day Group at the new Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, South Carolina. Equipped with North American F-100 Super Sabre fighters, the squadron participated in exercises, operations, tests, and firepower demonstrations conducted by the Tactical Air Command within the US and abroad. The unit frequently deployed to Aviano Air Base, Italy and Wheelus Air Base, Libya. Was deployed to Europe during the 1958 Lebanon crisis and was moved to McCoy Air Force Base, Florida in 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis. During the Dominican Civil War, the squadron deployed eighteen of its F-100s to Ramey Air Force Base, Puerto Rico to guard against Cuban intervention in the war.Greenberg, p.44 =United States Air Forces in Europe= In 1966 the 353rd Tactical Fighter Squadron was reassigned to the 401st Tactical Fighter Wing, Torrejon AB, Spain when Strategic Air Command ended B-47 Stratojet deployments to the base and it was reassigned to the United States Air Forces in Europe. The host 401st TFW was itself reassigned to Torrejon from England AFB, Louisiana, with its operational fighter squadrons being deployed to Pacific Air Forces in South Vietnam for combat missions during the Vietnam War. The 353rd, along with the 307th TFS from Homestead and 613th from England to provide the 401st a full complement of aircraft. At Torrejon, the squadron continued to fly the F-100D \\"Super Sabre.\\" Major operations consisted of maintaining combat readiness; rotating units to other bases in Europe or the Middle East and participating in various United States Air Force, North Atlantic TreatyOrganization and Spanish Air Defense exercises. In 1970 the squadron had its aging F-100 fleet replaced, being re-equipped with F-4D Phantom II aircraft, its personnel being drawn from existing USAFE squadrons or new assignments from the United States. The 353rd's F-4's were tail-coded TK, and from Torrejon, the squadron made periodic partial deployments to Wheelus AB, Libya and Incirlik AB, Turkey, for weapons training. Beginning in June 1970, the 401st TFW was re-equipped with F-4E's. =Vietnam War= In 1971, the 612th and 613th Tactical Fighter Squadrons were reassigned back to the 401st TFW from their deployment in South Vietnam as part of the drawdown of USAF forces in Southeast Asia. As a result, on 15 July, the 353 TFS was inactivated and reassigned without equipment or personnel to the 354 TFW at Myrtle Beach AFB. At Myrtle Beach, the squadron assumed the personnel and A-7D Corsair IIs of the inactivating 511th Tactical Fighter Squadron, and begin training flights from Myrtle Beach with the new equipment. On 12 October 1972, the 353rd (commanded by Lt. Col Brown G. Howard III) deployed to Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand as part of the 354th Tactical Fighter Wing (Forward), and engaged in combat operations in the Vietnam War. The squadron used A-7 aircraft for close air support and in search and rescue operations. In January 1973, with the Vietnam War ceasefire in place, the squadron reassigned its deployed aircraft to the newly activated 3rd Tactical Fighter Squadron, 388th Tactical Fighter Wing at Korat, and its personnel returned to Myrtle Beach AFB without equipment. The squadron received new A-7D Corsair IIs upon its return to Myrtle Beach AFB, and the unit resumed training. It again deployed to Korat 31 March 1973, where it flew bombing missions until the bombing halt on 15 August 1973. The 353rd claims the distinction of dropping the last bomb and making the last strafing run of the war. =Post Vietnam era= On 18 October 1973 the squadron returned to Myrtle Beach AFB and resumed normal training activities. In 1978 the squadron obtained A-10 aircraft and flew training missions with the A-10s for over a decade, being deployed frequently to NATO bases in Germany for annual training exercises. The unit deployed to King Fahd International Airport, Saudi Arabia 15 August 1990. During Desert Storm, the squadron engaged in combat operations, January‚ÄìFebruary 1991, inflicting heavy damage to enemy armor and artillery emplacements, cut off enemy supply lines, and engaged in search and rescue operations. Returned to the United States in March 1991, and returned to peacetime training operations. Immediately began phasing down with the designated BRAC 1990 closure of Myrtle Beach AFB and the pending inactivation of its host Wing. The squadron's aircraft were dispersed, being reassigned to Air National Guard and other active Air Force Fighter Squadrons throughout the balance of 1991 and early 1992.

This included celebrities, such as Shammi Kapoor,Radhe Shyam. (1990). I Am Harmony. P.158. and gradually more Westerners.See for instance: Gaura Devi. (2001). Fire of Transformation. My life with Babaji. Though some of his followersSee for instance: Orr, Leonard, 1988, 1995. believed he was immortal, Haidakhan Babaji took Mahasamadhi on 14 February 1984, local sources would say it appeared to be a heart failure. He was buried in Haidakhan Ashram. This is how Babaji foretold and explained his death:  Teachings  Haidakhan Babaji maintained that: \\"All religions are incorporated in the principle of Truth, Simplicity and Love\\".The Teachings of Babaji, 25 December 1981 In his living years he taught intensively the importance to live a simple life with loving principles in truth. Although worshipped according to local customs, Haidakhan Babaji explained that he came to restore Sanatana Dharma rather than Hindu Dharma (Hinduism). Sanatan Dharma can be understood as a primordial religion reflecting natural laws established at the beginning of the Creation.The Teachings of Babaji, 25 March 1983. He explained further: \\"I have come to guide humanity to a higher path. I do not belong to any particular religion, but respect all religions. I seek the elevation of all mankind. \\"The Teachings of Babaji, 29 July 1983. He stressed the unity of all religions as expressed in the following words: \\"In any town there is always a central place; all the roads in the town or from out of town lead to that central place. Similarly, all religions lead to one point, and that is God Himself; and therefore following any religion you will ultimately reach God.\\"The Teachings of Babaji, 24 December 1981 He said: \\"We are all one with each other and with God.\\"The Teachings of Babaji, 2 April 1980. Haidakhan Babaji said: \\"You should seek harmony in everything you do. I am harmony. Thank you for your love.\\"The Teachings of Babaji, 12 April 1980.More on this subject can be found in the book: \\"I Am Harmony\\", by Radhe Shyam (1990). Haidakhan Babaji proclaimed: \\"One can follow any religion, one can follow any practice or path, but one must be humane.\\"The Teachings of Babaji, 22 January 1983 He said: \\"The world now is in a state of turmoil. It is suffering from three kinds of pain ‚Äì physical, mental, spiritual ‚Äì and there is only one way of being cured from these. We have to root out inhumanity and replace it with humanity. (‚Ä¶)\\"The Teachings of Babaji, 23 September 1983. He also made the following statement: \\"The only true man is one who practices 'humanism.' (‚Ä¶) this is the only way to success in life.\\"The Teachings of Babaji, 29 October 1983. Babaji talked about the importance of hard work and proper performance of one's duty so often that Karma Yoga should be considered the central element of his teachings. Babaji used to say that: \\"Work is worship\\"The Teachings of Babaji, 23 October 1981. and that hard work is the best spiritual practice. On another occasion he said: \\"If you are engaged in doing good deeds and go on doing good acts, you will have good sleep, good appetite and bad thoughts will not cross your mind. Otherwise, you will always be criticizing others. In inaction, your minds will always be engaged in thinking critically of others. Karma ‚Äì activity ‚Äì is the only thing which can drive out all evils\\".The Teachings of Babaji, 17 November 1983 Babaji also taught that \\"perfection in work\\" was the real meaning of Kriya Yoga.The Teachings of Babaji, 10 November 1983 Nama Japa, the repetition of God's Name, was a fundamental part of Haidakhan Babaji's teachings. He explained that God's name is the most powerful sound of the Creation ‚Äì \\"more powerful than a thousand atomic and hydrogen bombs.\\"The Teachings of Babaji, 26 December 1982 ‚Äì and that this is the only real thing. Haidakhan Babaji especially recommended the use of the mantra \\"O·πÉ nama·∏• ≈õivƒÅy\\" (Sanskrit: ‡•ê ‡§®‡§Æ‡§É ‡§∂‡§ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§Ø‡•ç ) ‚Äì because of its protective qualities,E.g. \\"Chant OM NAMAH SHIVAY and you can defy death.\\" The Teachings of Babaji, 28 July 1979. but also stated that one can use any God's name \\"his religion teaches.\\"Gaura Devi.

The mantra is always written internationally simplified as \\"Om Namah Shivay\\" in books about Babaji written in English or other languages.Maria Gabriele Wosien: Ich bin Du ‚Äì Botschaften des Meisters vom Himalaya, G. Reichel Verlag, Haidakhan Babaji warned his followers about the forthcoming Great Revolution or Maha Kranti. He described Maha Kranti as involving \\"earthquakes, floods, accidents, collisions and wars (...).\\"The Teachings of Babaji, 26 July 1979 In the context of these upcoming calamities, he called for courage: \\"Walk on with courage and bravery. Go on working to improve humankind and establish the Path of Truth. (‚Ä¶) Fight for truth! To face life you must have great courage every day\\".The Teachings of Babaji, 16 January 1983 Haidakhan Babaji urged his followers to be \\"inspired.\\" He stated: \\"Everything in this world is 'PHURO' ‚Äì transient. It has no reality. True reality is to proceed on the path of truth, to keep the company of saintly people, and to render service to men.\\"The Teachings of Babaji, 31 August 1983 Babaji advocated on behalf of the less- fortunate. He stated: \\"you should look to the areas of your countries where people are poverty-stricken and helpless and then do all you can to raise their standard of living, teaching them cleanliness and high morals. To serve the needy truly and from the heart is true service to God. (...)\\"The Teachings of Babaji, 20 April 1983  Spiritual routine  Babaji would typically start his day around 3:00 am, with a bath, often in cold Gautama Ganga, which was followed by meditation or a fire ceremony. Around 5:00 am he would see his devotees for ceremonial chandan (placing a mark on forehead), followed by morning Aarti (devotional singing) around 6:00 am. Then until noon everybody would be engaged in some form of karma yoga. At noon the only meal of the day was being served, followed by more karma yoga in the afternoon. Sometimes a more elaborate ceremony such as havan would be performed around the noon time. Havan is a fire ceremony.http://sanskrit.org/the-fire-ritual-havanhoma/ In the afternoon, Babaji would sometimes see the devotees for individual audiences, known as darshan. Then there would be another bath, followed by the evening Aarti. After the evening Aarti, Babaji was giving short speeches that were recorded in \\"The Teachings of Babaji.\\"For more description of daily routines around Babaji see also Gaura Devi (2001), for instance PP.63‚Äì67, 73.  Identity  Haidakhan Babaji was often asked who he was. He made the following assertions about himself: Old Hairakhan Baba ‚Äì as mentioned above Haidakhan Babaji maintained that he was identical with Hairakhan Baba (also spelled as Hariakhan or Heriakhan) who lived around Hairakhan in the years 1860‚Äì1922.The Teachings of Babaji, Foreword. See also Radhe Shyam. (1990). PP.50‚Äì65. Mahavatar Babaji ‚Äì it appears that Haidakhan Babaji pointed out or implied a few times that he was identical with Mahavatar Babaji described in Yogandanda's \\"Autobiography of a Yogi.\\"The Teachings of Babaji, Foreword. This claim is apparently disputed by the Self-Realization Fellowship, the society founded by Paramahansa Yogananda.Radhe Shyam. (1990). P.xvi. The practices of these latter differ. Those by Baba Haidakhan were much simpler and did not involve any secret ceremony. Messenger ‚Äì Haidakhan Babaji would sometimes refer to himself as \\"messenger of revolution\\" He often urged the followers to \\"spread his Message.\\"The Teachings of Babaji, e.g. 14 September 1981. Mahaprabhuji ‚Äì on one occasion Babaji stated: \\"I am Bhole Baba (Simple Father). I am nobody and nothing. I am only like a mirror in which you can see yourself. I am like a fire. Don‚Äôt keep too far away or you will not get warmth. But don‚Äôt get too near or you may burn yourself. Learn the right distance. My name is Maha Prabhuji (The Great God).\\"Gaura Devi. (1990). Babaji‚Äôs Teachings. P.7. Vishnu Dutt Shastriji said the following about Mahaprabhuji: \\"Sitting here at Haidakhan, Mahaprabhuji has control over every particle of the Creation by the power of His mere wish, by His very thought. (...) Mahaprabhuji has control over the elements, the spiritual world ‚Äì to say nothing of the world of men. He is the Creator, Sustainer and Destroyer of the world. Not a single blade of grass can grow but that He wills it. He has incarnated in a human body for the welfare of mankind. His sole desire ‚Äì is to make it possible for the whole world to be liberated. He shall do His utmost to achieve liberation of the world.\\"The Teachings of Babaji, 31 August 1983. The Guru of all Gurus ‚Äì Gaura Devi recorded Babaji saying: \\"I am no one‚Äôs Guru, but I am the Guru of gurus.\\"Gaura Devi. (1990). Babaji‚Äôs Teachings. P.9. I am everywhere ‚Äì Haidakhan Babaji was recorded saying: \\"I am everywhere ‚Äì in your every breath. I have come to help you realize unity beyond division. I will show you a freedom you have not imagined. You must seek that unity from whence there is awareness that we are all one. Seek harmony in all that you do. I am harmony. If you are in peace, I am in peace. If you are troubled, I am troubled. If you are happy, I am happy. Be happy.

He is one of the founders of solid-state chemistry, starting with his work at the University of Wales, Bangor, in 1958 when he investigated the various ways in which dislocations inÔ¨Çuence the chemical, electronic and excitonic properties of a range of solids. He was one of the first to exploit electron microscopy as a chemical tool, especially to deduce active-site reactivities from the surface topography of many minerals and crystal hydrates. At Aberystwyth (1969‚Äì1978) he elucidated the surface chemistry of diamond, clay minerals, metals and intercalates by pioneering UV and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. He also initiated the field of crystal engineering of organic molecules. As head of physical chemistry at Cambridge (1978‚Äì1986), he used magic-angle-spinning NMR and high-resolution electron microscopy to characterize and determine the structures of zeolites and other nanoporous catalysts. As Fullerian Professor and Director of the Royal Institution and of the Davy Faraday Research Laboratory, he utilized synchrotron radiation to characterize, in situ, new catalysts designed for green chemistry and clean technology. He is the recipient of many national and international awards; and, for his contribution to geochemistry, the mineral meurigite was named in his honor. He was Master of Peterhouse, University of Cambridge (1993‚Äì2002), and was knighted in 1991 \\"for services to chemistry and the popularisation of science\\". Thomas has authored more than 1200 scientific articles and several books, including Michael Faraday and the Royal Institution: The Genius of Man and Place (1991), Principles and Practice of Heterogeneous Catalysis (with W. John Thomas, 1997, 2014), and Design and Applications of Single-Site Heterogeneous Catalysts: Contributions to Green Chemistry, Clean Technology and Sustainability (2012).  Biography  = Early life and education = Thomas was born and brought up in the Gwendraeth Valley, Carmarthenshire, Wales, near the mining town of Llanelli, where his father and brother were miners. Thomas earned a BSc degree from the University College of Wales, Swansea (later Swansea University) in 1954,. He earned a PhD from Queen Mary College (later Queen Mary University of London) in 1958, working with Keble W. Sykes. =Personal life= In 1959, Thomas married Margaret Edwards with whom he had two daughters, Lisa and Naomi. Margaret Thomas died in 2002. In April 2010, Thomas married Jehane Ragai of the American University in Cairo; the events took place in Cambridge and London. The recreations he lists in Who's Who include ancient civilisations, bird watching, and Welsh literature. = Early career = After a year's work for the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority as scientific officer (1957‚Äì1958), Thomas joined the Department of Chemistry at the University College of North Wales (later Bangor University) as of September 1958. There he rose through the ranks from Assistant Lecturer (1958), to Lecturer (1959), to Senior Lecturer (1964) and then to Reader in 1965. Thomas demonstrated the profound influence of dislocations and other structural imperfections upon the chemical, electronic, and surface properties of solids. In 1969 Thomas became Professor and Head of Chemistry at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, where he broadened his interests in solid-state, surface and materials chemistry and pioneered new techniques for the application of electron microscopy in chemistry. In 1977 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1978, Thomas succeeded Jack Linnett as Head of the Department of Physical Chemistry at the University of Cambridge (then a separate department from the Department of Chemistry, which covered Organic, Inorganic and Theoretical Chemistry). He also became a Professorial Fellow at King's College, Cambridge, holding both positions until 1986. Thomas continued developing new techniques in solid-state and materials science, and designing and synthesising new catalysts. For example, he extended his earlier electron microscopic and surface studies of minerals and intercalates to encompass the synthesis and structural determination of zeolitic materials by a combination of solid-state NMR, neutron scattering, and real-space imaging. = Director of the Royal Institution = In 1986, Thomas succeeded Sir George Porter as Director of the Royal Institution of Great Britain, London. He also became the holder of the Michael Faraday chair, and the Director of the Davy Faraday Research Laboratory (DFRL). The Royal Institution was founded in 1799. Its earliest directors were Humphry Davy (1801‚Äì1825) and Michael Faraday (1825‚Äì1867). The Davy Faraday Research Laboratory opened on 22 December 1896, with funding from Ludwig Mond. It was \\"unique of its kind, being the only public laboratory in the world solely devoted to research in pure science\\". At this time, Thomas began using synchrotron radiation and devised techniques which combine X-ray spectroscopy and high-resolution X-ray diffraction to determine the atomic structure of the active sites of solid catalysts under operating conditions. He also devised new mesoporous, microporous, and molecular sieve catalysts. In 1987 the BBC televised Thomas' Royal Institution Christmas Lectures on crystals, continuing the tradition of lectures for children started by Faraday in 1825. In 1991 Thomas published the book Michael Faraday and the Royal Institution: The Genius of Man and Place, which has since been translated into Japanese (1994) and Italian (2007). In 1991, Thomas resigned as Director of the Royal Institution and the Davy Faraday Research Laboratory, to be succeeded by Peter Day. = Return to Cambridge = After a period as Deputy Pro-Chancellor of the University of Wales (1991‚Äì1994), Thomas returned to Cambridge in 1993 as Master of Peterhouse, the oldest college of the university. He was the first scientist to hold the position. In 1997 Thomas co-authored the text Principles and Practice of Heterogeneous Catalysis with W. John Thomas (no relation). In 1999 John Meurig Thomas was elected Honorary Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering for work that \\"has profoundly added to the science-base of heterogeneous catalysis leading to the commercial exploitation of zeolites through engineering processes\\". Thomas is the author of some thirty patents, some of which have made chemical processes more environmentally benign (\\"greener\\") by eliminating the use of solvents and reducing the number of manufacturing steps involved. The single-step, solvent- free catalytic synthesis of ethyl acetate that he invented is the basis of a 200,000 ton/year plant in the UK, the largest of its kind in the world. He has recently devised single-step, solvent-free processes for the production of caprolactam (the raw material for nylon-6) and vitamin B3 (niacin). In 2002, Thomas stepped down from his position as Master of Peterhouse. He became Honorary Professor of Materials Science at the University of Cambridge and Emeritus Professor of Chemistry at the Davy Faraday Research Laboratory of the Royal Institution. He continued to be active in research at the Davy Faraday laboratory until 2006.  Awards and honors  Thomas holds an Honorary Distinguished Professorship of Materials Chemistry at Cardiff University,. He is an Advisory Professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University and at the Catalysis Center of Hokkaido University. He is an Honorary Bencher of Gray's Inn. Thomas has received twenty three honorary degrees from Australian, British, Canadian, Chinese, Dutch, Egyptian, French, Italian, Japanese, Spanish, and U.S. universities, including an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Science from the University of St Andrews in 2012. He has been elected to honorary membership in over fifteen foreign academies, including the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (2013), the American Philosophical Society (1992), the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1990), the Accademia dei Lincei (Rome, 2012), and the Russian Academy of Sciences (1994). In 1993 he was elected a Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Recent awards include the Kapitza Gold Medal from the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences (2011), the Jayne Prize Lectureship of the American Philosophical Society (2011), the Bragg Prize Lectureship of the British Crystallographic Association (2010), the Sven Berggren Prize Lectureship, Lund (2010), the Ertl Prize Lectureship of the Max Planck Gesellschaft (2010), the Sir George Stokes Medal from the Royal Society of Chemistry (2005), the Giulio Natta Gold Medal from the Societ√† Chimica Italiana (2004), the Linus Pauling Gold Medal from Stanford University (2003), and the American Chemical Society Annual Award (first recipient) for Creative Research in Heterogeneous and Homogeneous Catalysis (1999). He has won the Davy Medal of the Royal Society and the Faraday Lectureship Prize (1989) of the Royal Society of Chemistry. In 1995 he became the first British scientist in 80 years to be awarded the Willard Gibbs Award by the Chicago Section of the American Chemical Society. In 1967 he was a recipient of the Corday‚ÄìMorgan Prize. Yellowish-white hairy meurigite on brown ruifrancoite spheres In recognition of his contributions to geochemistry, a new mineral, meurigite, was named after him in 1995 by the International Mineralogical Association. A hydrated potassium iron phosphate, meurigite is described as \\"tabular, elongated crystals forming spherical and hemispherical clusters and drusy coatings. The colour ranges from creamy white to pale yellow and yellowish brown.\\" It is found in only a few locations worldwide, of which the designated type locality is the Santa Rita mine in New Mexico. Thomas's 75th birthday was celebrated at the University of Cambridge with a symposium and several musical and social events. It was attended by Angela Merkel and Ahmed Zewail. The papers presented were published in 2008 by the Royal Society of Chemistry as Turning Points in Solid-State, Materials and Surface Science: A Book in Celebration of the Life and Work of Sir John Meurig Thomas. In 2010 Imperial College Press published 4D Electron Microscopy: Imaging in Space and Time, which he co-authored with Ahmed Zewail (Nobel Laureate, Chemistry, 1999). His most recent publication is Design and Applications of Single-Site Heterogeneous Catalysts: Contributions to Green Chemistry, Clean Technology and Sustainability (2012) In 2003, he was the first scientist to be awarded the Medal of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion (London) for services to Welsh culture and British public life. He is also a Founding Fellow of the Learned Society of Wales and a Member of its inaugural Council. Since 2011 he has been a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee for Wales. He is an overseer of the Science History Institute (Philadelphia), and a member of the International Advisory Board of the Zewail City of Science and Technology (Egypt). Thomas was appointed as a Honorary Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 2013. In 2016, he was conferred an Honorary Fellowship by Beijing Normal University-Hong Kong Baptist University United International College (UIC), in view of his distinguished achievements in catalysis and materials science, and his dedication and outstanding contributions to the popularisation of science. In October 2016, the Royal Society awarded Thomas the Royal Medal for Physical Sciences \\"for his pioneering work within catalytic chemistry, in particular on single-site heterogeneous catalysts, which have had a major impact on green chemistry, clean technology and sustainability.\\" The Duke of York represented Her Majesty the Queen at the ceremony. Also in 2016, the UK Catalysis Hub launched a new medal that \\"honours the achievements of Sir John Meurig Thomas, a distinguished professor in the field of catalysis.\\" The JMT Medal will be awarded every year, to a person working in the United Kingdom, for outstanding achievement in catalysis or a closely related field.

He played as a forward for clubs in Morocco, Scotland and the United Arab Emirates. He was a Moroccan international who won 7 caps. Club career =Aberdeen= After playing in his native country for Yaakoub El Mansouria and USP Police, Zerouali was signed by Aberdeen manager Ebbe Skovdahl from FUS de Rabat in November 1999 for a fee of ¬£450,000, on the recommendation of the club's director of football, Keith Burkinshaw. He became the first player in Scotland to wear the shirt number '0' in 2000 (something outlawed the following season by the Scottish Premier League and the Premier League in England). In January 2000, Zerouali scored a thirty-yard free kick in a fourth round Scottish Cup tie away to St Mirren to take the tie to a replay. Zerouali then scored in the 2‚Äì0 replay win at Pittodrie to help the club into the next round of the competition. Aberdeen reached both the 2000 Scottish League Cup Final and the 2000 Scottish Cup Final with the Moroccan playing in both matches, although they ended in defeat to Celtic and Rangers respectively. In August 2000, Zerouali was injured with a broken ankle during a match against Motherwell, and subsequently missed out on a place at the Sydney Olympic Games, and was eventually out of action for a full year. In one of his more memorable outings after his return, he scored a hat-trick against Dundee. =Al-Nassr and FAR Rabat= After his contract at Aberdeen expired, he then moved to play his football in the United Arab Emirates with the team Al-Nassr for a year, before returning to live in his home country of Morocco in 2003, signing for FAR Rabat, where he won the Coupe du Tr√¥ne that year. International career Zerouali won 17 caps for the Morocco national football team and scored three goals. He featured for Morocco in the 2002 Africa Cup of Nations in Mali, and scored two goals in a 2‚Äì1 win over Burkina Faso. He also played in the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship. He was in the international squad a month before his death. Death Zerouali was killed in a car accident in Rabat in December 2004 aged 27. Only the previous Saturday, he had scored two goals in a league game for his club. He is survived by a daughter to his girlfriend in Aberdeen. A firm fans' favourite at Aberdeen, he was affectionately known as 'Zero' to the supporters. A memorial and tribute was held at Pittodrie Stadium after he died, which was attended by thousands of fans, despite him not playing for the club at the time and only having spent a short period there.

He rose to prominence as a former member of Transglobal Underground and the founder of the Dhol Foundation. He also is a member of the Afro Celt Sound System and The Imagined Village. Biography =Early life= Kalsi and Martin Carthy performing with The Imagined Village at the Big Chill Festival Kalsi performing with The Imagined Village in 2008 Kalsi was born in Leeds, Yorkshire in 1967. His parents had emigrated to the United Kingdom from Kenya. His grandfather had earlier moved to Mombasa from Punjab. As a youth, he was interested in music, though his parents had other aspirations for him, hoping he would become a doctor or lawyer. Kalsi was self-taught as a drummer when he joined a school jazz trio and they performed at school concerts and assembly hall meetings. He was also the drummer in the orchestra as well as in a rock band in school. His exposure to a variety of genres embraced both traditional Indian music and Western influences, and he began making Eastern drum rhythms using Western instruments; along the way he redesigned the traditional dhol drum to his own specifications. =Early career= In 1986, after leaving school and while in college, Kalsi joined a band called Mela Group for a few years and on the side he was also a session player for Wanjara Group & DJ Harvey. In 1989, he joined bhangra band Alaap, and assumed the role of lead percussionist and dhol player for the band. In 1995, Kalsi joined an emerging world music organisation founded by Peter Gabriel, based at Real World Studios in Box, Wiltshire, England. He performed at a number of World of Music, Arts and Dance (WOMAD) festivals around the world. While performing at ceremonial weddings, Kalsi was encouraged to teach his techniques to others. He became the first dhol player to perform live with DJs, which appealed to younger audiences. Kalsi's first dhol classes in Britain took place in 1989. No one had previously taught dhol as an ensemble instrument. Kalsi self funded his first tutorial classes in Slough, England in 1990. During 1991 he assembled lead drummers to perform in local charity events. Kalsi took on the role of a sideman in addition to session work, and performed with the Afro Celt Sound System on their second album, Release, which also featured Sin√©ad O'Connor. During the time he was with Transglobal underground Kalsi and The Dhol Foundation provided support in a European tour with rock musicians Page & Plant. Kalsi worked as a session musician for Fundamental and Transglobal Underground during the early 1990s, and later joined the Afro Celt Sound System.< During 1997, Kalsi was touring with Fundamental performing at WOMAD festivals all over the world. =Later career= In 1999 Kalsi's drumming troupe, The Dhol Foundation recorded their first album. The album was recorded live at performances around the world, absorbing the differing musical influences of bands they toured with, and contributed to their sound. Big Drum Small World, featuring a large photo of Kalsi on the album cover, was released on Shakti Records in 2001. The album received positive mention from critics. Kalsi drew upon his experience as a session player and his understanding of ethnic and western instrumentsto work as producer for the album. . Peter Gabriel's label, Real World Records, recorded Kalsi's first album in 2002. Martin Scorsese's movie, Gangs of New York featured one of his songs, as did The Incredible Hulk. As a member of the Dhol Foundation and in a solo capacity, he also worked on Gabriel's albums Up and OVO, and his soundtrack for the album Rabbit Proof Fence. Towards the end of 2002 Kalsi worked with the teenage pop singer Avril Lavigne, when she recorded a cover of Bob Dylan's \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\\". It was sung by Lavigne at a War Child Charity Concert covered by MTV. Kalsi was selected to give the track an ethnic Indian feel and add some light percussion. In early 2013 Johnny Kalsi tookThe Dhol Foundation to perform for Stand up To Cancer. Johnny is a member of the Sikh Welfare Awareness Team and each week he donates some of his time to feeding and clothing the homeless and people below the poverty line in central London. =2015= Kalsi received an Honorary Fellowship Degree from Leeds College of Music.

Biography They released one full-length record on Crank! Records and achieved some success gaining radio play, reaching 24 on the CMJ charts and charting in The Gavin Report in the summer of 1998. They toured extensively throughout the United States. Travis Morrison from The Dismemberment Plan recorded and produced most of their early output, and the two bands frequently played shows together. The VB played rock music with a wide dynamic range. The band experimented with the different fads of the time and kept the bits they found relevant from free-form improvisation; math rock (frequent time signature changes and odd meters); lo-fi; slowcore; and emo/spazcore/screamo as it developed on the East Coast through bands such as Rites of Spring and Fugazi, and in the Northwest with more mainstream acts such as Sunny Day Real Estate; and heavy use of tape delay. Some songs were fairly straightforward, but a common theme was creating tension through music and then providing a release. The VB began performing at the Dharma Coffeehouse and The Music Store in Fairfax City, Virginia. At that time the band was performing with bands like The Dismemberment Plan (the band would record several times with Travis from The Dismemberment Plan). In 1994, they moved to Boston, Massachusetts, continued to tour, and released several 7‚Äù records. A 1996 session in Rhode Island was self-released as an LP called Tragedy in early 1997. In 1998, Crank! Records re-released it, providing greater distribution. Touring proved to be stressful for the band, and they chose to end their existence in 1999, playing their last show in Portland, Oregon The Vehicle Birth reunited for two Virginia shows, one in Arlington @ Galaxy Hut on 03/19/11 and the other in Fairfax @ The Dharma Coffeehouse.

It is made from unripe green walnuts. The walnuts and the liquor are handled using ceramic or wooden tools (to avoid oxidation) and placed in an alcoholic base. After steeping in spirit, the walnuts are removed and the alcohol is mixed with simple syrup. Nocino has an aromatic but bittersweet flavor. It may be homemade; villages and even individual families often have their own (oftentimes secret) recipes, including different additions like cinnamon, juniper berries, lemon or orange zest, vanilla pods, coffee beans, or clove. The spices are added lightly, to avoid overpowering the flavour of the walnuts. The classic base consists of pure alcohol but Vodka can also be used. Nocino is also available commercially in bottled form. Commercially available nocino is typically 40% alcohol by volume, or 80 proof. History According to Roman historians, the nocino actually was born in Britain. The earliest records are related to the Picts (from the Latin picti, meaning painted) so called by the Romans because they used to paint their skin in blue. The Romans also recorded the strange traditions of these people on June 24, when they drank a very special brew, and they said they could talk with goblins, with elves and goddesses. When the Romans made Christianity the official religion of the Empire (in 313 AD), these ancient rites, in order to survive, had to be \\"translated\\" into the tradition of the Bible. Thus, they became associated to St. John the Baptist, who, according to the tradition, was born on the Summer Solstice. While references to nocino often hail its ancient or Medieval roots, extant documentation is lacking. Conrad Gessner provided a potential exception to this observation in his 1552 book The Treasure of Euonymus. Peter Morwen's translation of Gessner's Latin text states, \\"The water of walnuts not rype made aboute saint Ihons tyde, ministred without, is good for woundes and hoat byles, and the pestilent anthrax. Also being dronke a two or thre vnces, it cooleth and resisteth the pestilence.\\" Gessner's conception of this medicinal drink contains important components of nocino. \\"Water\\" likely refers to a distillation. Unripe walnuts should be collected on Saint John's Tide (June 24). Nicholas Culpeper wrote, \\"The young green nuts taken before they be half ripe and preserved with sugar, are of good use for those who have weak stomachs.\\" He also mentions that ounce or two of a distillation of the same age of husk, is used to \\"cool the heat of agues and resist the infection of the plague.\\"[Culpeper, N., Culpeper's Complete Herbal and English Physician, (Manchester: J Gleave and Son, 1826), 194.] This drink or potion made its way to Celtic France and to this day, a similar drink called liqueur or Brou De Noix is made in many French regions. At some point, this practice of infusing green walnuts came to the Italian peninsula where it became known as Nocino or, in the case of Piedmont, Ratafi√† Di Noci (walnut ratafi√†). During the Middle Ages, Italian monasteries used Nocino for its medicinal properties and also as an alcoholic treat.Celtic origin of Nocino Ordine del Nocino Modenese is an association of Spilamberto, Province of Modena, Emilia-Romagna, Italy, which, since 1978, promotes the traditional Nocino of Modena.http://www.ordinedelnocinomodenese.it/ According to tradition, Italian nocino requires barefoot virgins gathering an uneven number (21 or 23) of soft, green, dew-laden walnuts, which they would leave to dry by the remains of the threshing fires that had been used to quicken the process of separating the wheat. Tradition also dictates that the walnuts have to be and harvested by hand, one at a time, so as not to damage the shell, during the \\"night of San Giovanni\\" or St John the Baptist Day (24 June). The date is appropriate, since this is the time when walnuts are still flexible, if one is too late, one may find that the walnuts have hardened, thus making them inappropriate for making Nocino. Nocino mustn't be tried before 3 November, although if the liquor is left to mellow for more than one year the flavour will be richer. However, global warming has started to affect the ripening process, and in certain areas walnuts are already too ripe for Nocino on 24 June. The ideal time to harvest the walnuts is when the walnuts haven't hardened yet. Depending upon the local temperature, the walnuts may have to be harvested earlier, such as on 14 or 15 June instead of 24 June. Availability Nocino is also produced in New Zealand by NewZino, under the name NutZino Walnut LiqueurNewZino and in Australia by Timboon Railway Shed Distillery in Timboon, Victoria.Timboon Railway Shed Distillery A handful of craft distillers have started producing the liqueur in the United States. Walnut liquor is also produced in Romania, where it is called NucatƒÉ and used both recreationally and as a digestive. Besides the walnuts, the recipe includes various combinations of additional flavours, such as anise, black pepper, lemon peel, orange peel, nutmeg or vanilla pods. When making walnut liquor, Romanians sometimes set aside some of the softer walnuts to make walnut jam as well since in June the walnuts are suitable for both uses. In Romania, walnut liquor is sometimes made in autumn as well, out of the green husks of 15-18 walnuts.Romanian Walnut liquor (in Romanian) In Slovenia walnut liquor is known as orehovec and is flavored with coffee, while in Croatia, it is known as Orahovac and it is flavored with orange, lemon, and vanilla.. In Serbia, it is called orahovaƒça, it is widely made in homes in the villages and is considered to be very good for health.

It is native to the southwestern Pacific Ocean from Australia to New Zealand and the Kermadec Islands, where it can be found in inshore waters from the surface to depths of . This fish can reach a length of . It is commercially important and is also a popular game fish. Description The blue maomao has a laterally, compressed and relatively deep body with a noticeably forked tail. They have protrusible jaws, equipped with a number of rows of small, closely set teeth, which are used to capture larger zooplankton. The adults are deep blue dorsally and pale ventrally, at night they change colour to a mottled dark green. The juveniles are grey with a yellow anal fin. They can grow to a fork length. The dorsal fin has 9 spines and 27 soft rays and the anal fin has 2 spines and 25 soft rays. Distribution Blue maomao are found in the southwestern Pacific Ocean around North Island, New Zealand, the Kermadec Islands and have been recorded in Australia. Habitat and biology The blue maomao is a schooling fish of inshore waters, especially rocky areas, which feed on zooplankton although when zooplankton are scarce they will graze on algae. When feeding in schools chasing shrimps near the surface they can cause the water to foam. Each fish has a favoured sleeping spot among the rocks during the night and they change colour from blue to mottle green at night. Occasionally they will sleep in groups over sheltered, sandy areas. They are tactile fish and when not feeding will rub themselves on pebbles and they will also visit cleaner fish when there is no apparent need for them to be cleaned. They spawn from September to November and the juveniles are recorded from October to December, the eggs are 0.8mm in diameter and contain an oil droplet. These fish can live to be 15 years old.

The history of Shanghai spans over a thousand years and closely parallels the development of modern China. Originally a small agricultural village, Shanghai developed during the late Qing dynasty (1644‚Äì1912) as one of China's principal trading ports. Since the economic reforms of the early 1990s the city has burgeoned to become one of Asia's major financial centers and the world's busiest container port.  Early Era  Early settlements of Shanghai Around 6000 BCE, only the western part of the Shanghai region encompassing today's Qingpu, Songjiang and Jinshan districts were dry land formed by lacustrine silting from ancient Lake Tai. The modern Jiading, Minhang and Fengxian districts emerged around 1,000 BC while the downtown area remained underwater. The earliest Neolithic settlements known in this area date to the Majiabang culture (50003300 BCE). This was overlapped by the Songze culture between around 3800‚Äì3300 BCE. In the lower stratum of the Songze excavation site in the modern-day Qingpu District, archaeologists found the prone skeleton of one of the Shanghai's earliest inhabitantsa 25-30-year- old male with an almost complete skull dated to the Majiabang era. By the 4th and 5th centuries CE, during the Eastern Jin dynasty (317420), a thriving fishing industry had developed along the Song Rivernow known as Suzhou Creek,a tributary of the Huangpu River. Located some from the Yangtze River estuary, China's largest inland waterway, the creek was at that time known as the Hu (), a character that represents a fishing trap, of which there were a number in the river. The character Hu is still used as an abbreviation to denote the city, for example on car license plates. Qinglong Zhen (), the \\"Garrison of the Green Dragon\\", the first garrison in this area, was founded in 746 during the Tang dynasty (618‚Äì907) in what is now the Qingpu District of Shanghai. Five years later, Huating Zh√®n () followed, demonstrating the growth of the region and its increasing political and geographical importance. In 1074, Emperor Shenzong of Song, established a Marine Office and a Goods Control Bureau north-west of Huating Zhen at the approximate location of Shanghai's old city, adjacent to a ditch or pu () that ran north into Suzhou Creek and allowed for the loading and unloading of freight. Later on, the area's proximity to Hangzhou, the capital of the Southern Song dynasty (1127-1279), proved beneficial. Along with its commercial activities, Qinglong Zhen became a military and naval base and by the early 12th century a Superintendent of Foreign Trade was established in the settlement to supervise trade and tax collections across five counties. As a result, the flourishing and prosperous town earn the sobriquet \\"Little Hangzhou.\\" According to official government sources, Shanghai first became a city in 1291 during the Yuan dynasty (1271‚Äì1368). At this time, five of Huating Zhen's villages were amalgamated to form a new Shanghai County () on the site of the modern city centre. This new settlement had a population of about 300,000 with many engaged in the shipping trade.  Ming dynasty  Map of the Old City of Shanghai. By the early 15th century, Shanghai had become important enough for Ming dynasty engineers to begin dredging the Huangpu River (also known as Shen). In 1553, a city wall was built around the Old Town (Nanshi) as a defense against the depredations of the Wokou (Japanese pirates). Shanghai had its first contact with the Jesuits in 1603 when the Shanghai scholar-bureaucrat Xu Guangqi was baptized by Jesuit priest Matteo Ricci. Xu later bequeathed some of his land in Shanghai, today's Xujiahui, meaning Xu family village, to the Catholic Church. By the end of the Ming dynasty in 1644, Shanghai had become a major cotton and textile center with a population that would soon reach 200,000.  Qing dynasty  Guards of Shanghai Old City. During the late Qing dynasty, Shanghai's economy began to rival that of the traditionally larger market at Suzhou. In the 18th and early 19th centuries, exports of cotton, silk, and fertilizer reached as far as Polynesia and Persia. In 1832, the British East India Company explored Shanghai and the Yangzi River as a potential trading center for tea, silk, and opium, but was rebuffed by local officials. The British then forced the Chinese to import British opium (which it produced in British India) by waging the First Opium War between 1839 and 1842. The Qing military forces proved no match for the British. The war finally ended with the Treaty of Nanjing and Shanghai was one of five Chinese cities to be opened up to British consuls, merchants, and their families. Soon merchants from France, the US, Germany and other foreign powers began to move into Shanghai, carving out for themselves sovereign \\"concessions\\" where they were not subject to Chinese laws. The British established their concession in 1845, the Americans in 1848 in Hongkou, north of Suzhou Creek, and the French set up their concession in 1849 west of the old Chinese city and south of the British Concession. In 1846, Peter Richards founded Richards' Hotel, the first western hotel in China. It would later become the Astor House. In 1850, the first English-language newspaper in Shanghai, the North China Herald, was launched. Shanghai\\" in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 1886. The Taiping Rebellion was the largest of a number of widespread rebellions against the hugely unpopular Qing regime. In 1853, Shanghai was occupied by a triad offshoot of the rebels called the Small Swords Society. The fighting devastated much of the countryside but left the foreign settlements untouched. Gun transportation at Shanghai Jiangnan Arsenal (‰∏äÊµ∑Ê±üÂçóÂà∂ÈÄ†ÂÖµÂ∑•ÂéÇ), during the Self-Strengthening Movement. In 1854 a group of Western businessmen met and formed the Shanghai Municipal Council to organise road repairs, refuse clearance and tax collection across the concessions. In 1863 the American concession (land fronting the Huangpu River to the north-east of Suzhou Creek) officially joined the British Settlement (stretching from Yang-ching-pang Creek to Suzhou Creek) to become the Shanghai International Settlement. Its waterfront became the internationally famous Bund. The French concession, to the west of the old town, remained independent and the Chinese retained control over the original walled city and the area surrounding the foreign enclaves. By the late-1860s Shanghai's official governing body had been practically transferred from the individual concessions to the Shanghai Municipal Council. The International Settlement was wholly foreign-controlled with the British holding the largest number of seats on the Council and heading all the Municipal departments. No Chinese residing in the International Settlement were permitted to join the council until 1928. Jardine's attempt to construct the Woosung \\"Road\\" railway in 1876China's firstproved initially successful until the death of a soldier on the tracks prompted the Chinese government to demand its nationalization.

Modern Asian Studies, Vol. VII, No. 4. Cambridge University Press, 1973. The telegraph that had been strung along the line of the railwayalso China's firstwas, however, allowed to remain in operation. By the mid-1880s, the Shanghai Municipal Council had a practical monopoly over a large part of the city's services. It bought up all the local gas-suppliers, electricity producers and water- companies. In the early 20th century, it took control over all non-private rickshaws and the Settlement tramways. It also regulated opium sales and prostitution until their banning in 1918 and 1920 respectively. The Treaty of Shimonoseki which ended the First Sino-Japanese War saw Japan emerge as an additional foreign power in Shanghai. Japan built the first factories in Shanghai, which were soon followed by other foreign powers. The Chinese defeat also spurred reformers within the Qing government to modernize more quickly, leading to the re√´stablishment of the Songhu Railway and its expansion into the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway.  Republic of China  1933 map of Shanghai. The 1911 Xinhai Revolution, spurred in part by actions against the native- owned railways around Shanghai, led to the establishment of the Republic of China. During that time, Shanghai became the focal point of many activities that would eventually shape modern China. In 1936, Shanghai was one of the largest cities in the world with 3 million inhabitants. Of those, only 35,000-50,000 were of European origin, but these controlled half the city. Many White Russians fled to China after the 1917 Revolution, trickling to Shanghai along the 1920s. The number of people with Russian origins was about 35,000 by the 1930s, well exceeding number of other people with European origin. These Shanghai Russians were sometimes poorly regarded by westerners, as their general poverty led them to take jobs considered unsuitable for Europeans, including prostitution.Newham, Fraser. \\"The White Russians of Shanghai\\". History Today, Dec 2005, Vol. 55, No. 12, pp. 20-27. However, among Russian emigration was layered, also including several well-to-do members. Also, Russian artists controlled Shanghai's artistic life almost single- handedly. The city was thus divided between its more European western half and the more traditionally Chinese eastern half. New inventions like electricity and trams were quickly introduced, and westerners helped transform Shanghai into a metropolis. British and American businessmen made a great deal of money in trade and finance, and Germans used Shanghai as a base for investing in China. Shanghai accounted for half of the imports and exports of China. The western part of Shanghai grew to a size four times larger than the Chinese part had been in the early 20th century. Park regulations, 1917 European and American inhabitants of Shanghai called themselves the Shanghailanders. After problems during its initial few years, the Public Garden north of the BundChina's first public park and today's Huangpu Parkwas for decades reserved for the foreign nationals and forbidden to Chinese natives. The International Settlement was built in the British style with a large racetrack at the site of today's People's Square. A new class emerged, the compradors, which mixed with the local landlords to form a new class, a Chinese bourgeoisie. The compradors were indispensable mediators for the western companies. Many compradors were on the leading edge of the movement to modernize China. Shanghai was then the biggest financial city in East Asia. = Chinese society = Chinese society was divided into native place associations or provincial guilds. These guilds defended the interests of traders from shared hometowns. They had their own dress codes and sub-cultures. Chinese government was hardly organized. Instead, society was controlled by the native place associations. The Guangdong native place associations represented the skilled workers of Shanghai. These native place associations belonged to the top of Shanghainese society. The Ningbo and Jiangsu native place associations were the most numerous. They represented the common workers. Some came from the north of China. They were on the bottom rung of the social ladder. Many of them were forced to work as seasonal workers or even mobsters. Buck Clayton performing in the 1930s in the Canidrome =Shanghai Grand= During the 1920s and 1930s Shanghai became known as \\"The Paris of the East, the New York of the West\\".Concierge Traveler. \\"Concierge .\\" Shanghai Shadows. Retrieved on May 13, 2007. Shanghai was made a special city in 1927, and a municipality in May 1930. The city's industrial and financial power increased, because the merchants were in control of the city, while the rest of China was divided among warlords. Artistically, Shanghai became the hub for three new art forms: Chinese cinema, Chinese animation, and Chinese popular music. Other forms of entertainment included Lianhuanhua comic books. The architectural style at the time was modeled after British and American design. Many of the grandest-scale buildings on The Bundsuch as Shanghai Club, the Asia Building and the HSBC buildingwere constructed or renovated at this time. The city created a distinct image that separated it from all other Chinese cities that had come before it. \\"Bizarre advertising displays were an everyday reality ... though I sometimes wonder if everyday reality was the one element missing from the city,\\" British novelist J.G. Ballard, who was born and raised in Shanghai during this era, recalled in his autobiography. \\"I would see something strange and mysterious, but treat it as normal ... Anything was possible, and everything could be bought and sold.\\" The experience inspired much of his later fiction. Economic achievements include the city becoming the commercial center of East Asia, attracting banks from all over the world. When movies and literature depict the golden days of by-gone Shanghai, it is generally associated with this era. =Power struggle= Suzhou Creek around 1920 Jiujiang Road, Shanghai, late 1920s The city was also the center of national and international opium smuggling during the 1920s. In the 1930s, \\"The Great World\\" amusement palace was a place where opium, prostitution and gambling came together under the leadership of gangster Huang Jinrong also known as \\"Pockmarked Huang\\". Huang was the highest-ranked Chinese detective in the French Concession Police (FCP) and employed Green Gang (Qing Bang) leader Du Yuesheng as his gambling and opium enforcer. The Green Gang became a major influence in the Shanghai International Settlement, with the Commissioner of the Shanghai Municipal Police reporting that corruption associated with the trade had affected a large proportion of his force. An extensive crackdown in 1925 simply displaced the focus of the trade to the neighboring French Concession. Meanwhile, traditional division of society by native place associations was falling apart. The new working classes were not prepared to listen to the bosses of the same native place associations during the 1910s. Resentment against the foreign presence in Shanghai rose among both the entrepreneurs and the workers of Shanghai. In 1919, protests by the May Fourth Movement against the Treaty of Versailles led to the rise of a new group of philosophers like Chen Duxiu and Hu Shih who challenged Chinese traditionalism with new ideologies. Books like New Youth disseminated the new school of thought, while crime and warlord banditry convinced many that the existing government was largely ineffective. In this atmosphere, the Communist Party of China was founded in Shanghai in 1921. The Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek and the Shanghailanders entered into an informal alliance with the Green Gang, which acted against the Communists and organized labor unions. The nationalists had cooperated with gang leaders since the revolution. Although sporadic fighting between gangsters and communists had occurred previously, many communists were killed in a major surprise attack during the April 12 Incident in the Chinese-administered part of Shanghai. Suspected leftists were shot on sight, so that manyincluding Zhou Enlaifled the city. In the late 1920s and early '30s, large residential areas were built north of the foreign concessions. These residential areas were modern, with good roads and parking lots for automobiles. A new Chinese port was built, which could compete with the Shanghailanders' ports. Chiang Kai-shek continuously demanded large amounts of money from the financial world in Shanghai. Most bankers and merchants were willing to invest in the army, but this stopped in 1928. Chiang responded by nationalizing all enterprises. T. V. Soong, Chiang's brother-in- law, chastised his erstwhile relative, writing that it is better to strengthen the party and the economy as well instead of focusing only on the army. Supported by the progressive native place associations, Chiang Kai-shek's rule turned increasingly autocratic.Brian G. Martin, Shanghai Green Gang: Politics & Organized Crime, 1919-1937 (1996) ch 4 The power of the gangsters rose in the early 1930s, especially the power of the Green Gang leader Du Yuesheng who started his own native place association. Chiang Kai-shek chose to cooperate with gangsters in order to maintain his grip on Chinese society. This meant that the gangsters remained middlemen during the rule of the nationalists, controlling society by frequently organizing strikes. Mobsters stormed the Shanghai Stock Exchange to gain control over it. No one interfered: the police because they had been dominated by the mobsters since 1919, the Shanghailanders because it was an internal Chinese affair, and the nationalists because they were trying to break the power of the entrepreneurs. The entrepreneurs were forced to make a deal after a second raid.Brian G. Martin, Shanghai Green Gang: Politics & Organized Crime, 1919-1937 (1996) ch 5 = Greater Shanghai Plan = In 1927, the government of the Nationalist Government of the Republic of China drew up a plan to develop land in the north east of the city adjacent to the Huangpu River. In 1922, this area had also been earmarked by Sun Yat-sen, founder of the Chinese Republic, as the center of China's development plans with a view to Shanghai becoming a global commercial centre. By 1931, the new Shanghai Special City Government had approved and started work on the Greater Shanghai Plan utilising ideas drawn from British expert Ebenezer Howard's 1902 book Garden Cities of Tomorrow. The grid layout of the new area also followed contemporary trends in European and American urban planning. End of Old Shanghai (1937-1945) Battle of Shanghai =World War II and the Japanese Occupation= The Japanese Navy bombed Shanghai on January 28, 1932, nominally to crush Chinese student protests against the Japanese occupation of Manchuria. The Chinese fought back in what was known as the January 28 Incident. The two sides fought to a standstill and a ceasefire was brokered in May. During the Second Sino- Japanese War, the Chinese-controlled parts of the city fell after the 1937 Battle of Shanghai (known in China as the Battle of Songhu). The foreign concessions, which remained largely intact, entered what became known as the \\"Solitary Island\\" period ‚Äî an enclave of prosperity surrounded by war zones ‚Äî attracting some 400,000 Chinese refugees in 4 years. Tensions within the city led to a wave of assassinations against Chinese officials who worked with the Japanese authorities: during January and February, 1939, 16 pro-Japanese officials and businessmen were assassinated by Chinese resistance organizations.\\"War in China\\" Time, March 6, 1939. With the beginning of the Pacific War, the foreign concessions too were occupied by Japan on 8 December 1941. Shanghai suffered less than many other cities during World War II, and the Japanese occupiers attempted to maintain many aspects of life as they had been before. The Shanghai Race Club reopened soon after the occupation and continued to host races throughout the war, even after most British and American Shanghai residents were interned. The races continued as late as August, 1945. During World War II, the extraterritoriality of the foreign concessions provided a haven for visa-less European refugees. It was, along with Franco's Spain, the only location in the world unconditionally open to Jews at the time. However, under pressure from their ally Germany, the Japanese removed the Jews in late 1941 to what became known as the Shanghai ghetto, where hunger and infectious diseases such as dysentery became rife. The foreign population rose from 35,000 in 1936 to 150,000 in 1942 (Jewish immigration was 20000-25000 from 1933 to 1941). The Japanese were still harsher on belligerent nationals: the British, Americans and Dutch. These slowly lost their privileges and had to wear lettersB, A, or Nwhen walking in public places; their villas were turned into brothels and gambling houses., and they were finally interned in concentration camps, notably Lunghua Civilian Assembly Center, in 1943. The whole of Shanghai remained under Japanese occupation until the surrender of Japan on 15 August 1945. =End of the Foreign Concessions= Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese ended all foreign concessions in Shanghai except for the French. This state of affairs was conceded by an Anglo-Chinese Friendship Treaty in 1943. The French themselves ceded their privileges in 1946 following the end of World War II. Tightened Communist rule (1949-1980s) Li Jinhui, one of the many prominent figures in the artistic circle of Shanghai who would die under political persecution. =Communist Transition= People's Liberation Army troops entered to Nanjing Road on May 25, 1949 On May 27, 1949, Shanghai came under Communist control. Despite Communist claims that the city was taken over in a \\"peaceful\\" manner, one of the first actions taken by the Communist party was to kill people considered counter-revolutionaries. Places such as the Canidrome were transformed from elegant ballrooms to mass execution facilities.Time magazine. \\"Time magazine.\\" Kill nice! Retrieved on May 8, 2007.Bellucci, Lucille. [2005] (2005). Journey from Shanghai. iUniverse Publishing. This reality has been largely censored, despite numerous western texts describing the hostile takeover following the arrival of the People's Liberation Army. Most foreign firms moved their offices from Shanghai to Hong Kong, specifically North Point, whose Eastern District became known as \\"Little Shanghai\\". =Home of leftism= Shanghai was, along with Beijing, the only former ROC municipality not merged into neighboring provinces over the next decade. Shanghai then underwent a series of changes in the boundaries of its subdivisions. During the 1950s and 1960s, Shanghai became an industrial center and center for revolutionary leftism. The city stagnated economically during the Maoist era. Shanghai remained the largest contributor of tax revenue to the central government, but this came at the cost of severely crippling Shanghai's infrastructure, capital, and artistic development. This also initially denied economic freedoms to the city that were later available to southern provinces such as Guangdong. During the mid-1980s, Guangdong province paid nearly no taxes to the central government and thus was perceived as fiscally expendable. Guangdong would benefit from economic reform under Deng Xiaoping, while Shanghai would have to wait another decade until 1991. Economic and cultural rebound (1990s-Present) Nanjing Road in Shanghai in 2003 Although political power in Shanghai has traditionally been seen as a stepping stone to higher positions within the PRC central government, the city's modern transformation really did not begin until the third generation General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Jiang Zemin came to power in 1989. Along with his premier Zhu Rongji, Jiang represented the politically right-of-center \\"Shanghai clique\\" and began reducing the tax burden on Shanghai. Encouraging both foreign and domestic investment, he sought to promote the cityparticularly the Lujiazui area of Pudongas the economic hub of East Asia and gateway to the Chinese interior. Since that time, Shanghai has led China's overall development and experienced continuous economic growth of between 9-15% annuallyarguably at the expense of Hong Kong. Shanghai is China's largest and greatest commercial and industrial city. With 0.1% of the land area of the country, it supplies over 12% of the municipal revenue and handles more than a quarter of total trade passing through China's ports. Its year 2010 population, according to China's latest census, was 23.02 million and represented an increase of 6.61 million from the 2000 census. The average size of a family in Shanghai declined to fewer than three people during the 1990s, and it is clear that most of Shanghai's population growth is driven by migration rather than natural factors based on high birth and fertility rates. Shanghai has for many years had the lowest birth rate in China, a rate lower than large American cities such as New York. As with most cities in China, Shanghai is overbounded in its administrative territory. The city in the year 2010 was composed of 16 districts and one county, together occupying of land area. Chongming contains substantial rural land and a number of rural residents who continue to farm for their livelihood. The city has the highest population density of all the first-order administrative units in China, with 3630.5/km¬≤ (9402.9/sq mi) in 2010. Owing to its continued growth and industrial and commercial development, Shanghai also has the highest index of urbanization among all of China's first order administrative units, with 89.3% of the official population (20.6 million) classified as urban. The amount of building activity in Shanghai fueled by government investment expenditures continues to be astounding. Since the 1980s, Shanghai's economy shifted from over 77% of gross domestic product in secondary sector manufacturing to a more balanced sectoral distribution of 48% in industry and 51% in services in 2000 and 2001. Employment in manufacturing reached almost 60% in 1990 and has declined steadily since to 41% in 2001, while employment in the tertiary sector has grown from 30% in 1990 to more than 47% in 2001. The rapid growth in population, factories and motor vehicles has generated environmental issues. Experts say the chief problems involve air and water pollution and the accumulation of solid wastes.Yevgeny Biryulin, \\"Shanghai's Environmental Problems,\\" Far Eastern Affairs, 2010, Vol. 38 Issue 3, pp 63-79 See also * Timeline of Shanghai history * The Shanghai Document, a documentary film portraying Shanghai in the early 1920s Notes References = Citations = = Sources = Further reading * Arkaraprasertkul, Non. \\"Power, politics, and the making of Shanghai.\\" 'Journal of Planning History 9.4 (2010): 232-259, since 1980 * Balfour, Alan and Zheng Zhiling, Shanghai (Chichester 2002). * Berg√®re, Marie-Claire.

The Faculty also houses the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science, formerly the Faculty's computer science department. History The Faculty was founded on January 1, 1967, a successor to the University of Waterloo's Department of Mathematics, which had grown to be the largest department in the Faculty of Arts under the chairmanship of Ralph Stanton (and included such influential professors as W. T. Tutte). Initially located in the Physics building, the Faculty was moved in May 1968 into the newly constructed Mathematics and Computing (MC) Building. Inspired by Stanton's famously gaudy ties, the students draped a large pink tie over the MC Building on the occasion of its opening, which later became a symbol of the Faculty. At the time of its founding, the Faculty included five departments: Applied Analysis and Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, Combinatorics and Optimization, Pure Mathematics, and Statistics. In 1975 the Department of Applied Analysis and Computer Science became simply the Department of Computer Science; in 2005 it became the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science. The Statistics Department also was later renamed the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science. The Faculty of Mathematics finished construction of a third building, Mathematics 3 (M3), in 2011. It now houses the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science and a large lecture hall. Academics =Degrees= The Faculty of Mathematics grants the BMath (Bachelor of Mathematics) degree for most of its undergraduate programs. Computer Science undergraduates can generally choose between graduating with a BMath or a BCS (Bachelor of Computer Science) degree. The former requires more coursework in mathematics. Specialized degrees exist for the Software Engineering program (the BSE, or Bachelor of Software Engineering) and Computing and Financial Management (BCFM, or Bachelor of Computing and Financial Management). Postgraduate students are generally awarded an MMath (Master of Mathematics) or PhD. =Rankings= In the 2018 QS World University Rankings, the University of Waterloo was ranked 39th globally for Mathematics (and 3rd in Canada) and 31st globally for Computer Science (and 2nd in Canada). The University was ranked third in Canada for Mathematics and second in Canada for Computer Science in 2018 by the Maclean's University Rankings. Student life The Pink Tie Students in the Faculty of Mathematics are represented by the Mathematics Society (MathSoc), which represents student interests to the university, operates the Math Coffee and Donut Shop, publishes the Faculty newspaper mathNEWS, and runs student services including an exam bank and lounge space. Pi Day is celebrated by the Department in each term: on 14 March (3/14), on 22 July (22/7, Pi Approximation Day), and on 10 November (the 314th day of the year). Typical activities include throwing pie at MathSoc executives and/or popular professors, viewing mathematics-related films, competing in pi recitation contests, and eating pie (on 22/7, cake is served instead, which is approximately pie). =Tie Guard= A yearly tradition at the University of Waterloo, a group of senior math students volunteer for the position of Tie Guard each year, and are selected by the University of Waterloo Federation of Students representatives from the Faculty of Mathematics. It is expected that the appointed Tie Guard volunteers will be on hand 24 hours a day for the duration of the orientation week, to guard the Faculty's mascot (a 40-foot pink tie which hangs off the side of the building) and to provide first aid and information to incoming students. The Tie Guard was founded in 1994 after several previous attempts on the Pink Tie resulted in both damaged mascots and injuries to students, the most notorious of which was the Tie Liberation Organization (TLO) kidnapping in 1988. In more recent years the tie guard has expanded and now several students are appointed to the Tie Guard each year. A new pink tie was draped over the Mathematics 3 Building in 2011.

It documents anarchist theory and ideas and argues in favor of social anarchism.\\"A.3 What types of anarchists are there\\". \\"[W]e think social anarchism is more appropriate for modern society\\". \\"G.4 Why do social anarchists reject individualist anarchism?\\" . \\"[I]ndividualist anarchists [...] a form of anarchism [...] with many flaws\\". It also explores other debates internal to the anarchist movement and counters common arguments against anarchism. It has been in constant evolution since 1995. While it was started as a critique of anarcho-capitalism, by the time it was officially released it had become a general introduction to anarchism. The FAQ is published under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License (copyleft) and it is dedicated \\"to the millions of anarchists, living and dead, who tried and are trying to create a better world\\". It was officially released online on 19 July 1996 \\"to celebrate the Spanish Revolution of 1936 and the heroism of the Spanish anarchist movement\\".  History  The FAQ was started in 1995 when a group of anarchists got together in order to write an FAQ arguing against capitalist claims of being anarchists. Those who were involved in the project had spent many hours in online debate with self- described anarcho-capitalists concerning whether or not anarchism and capitalism are compatible. Eventually, a group of net-activists decided to write an FAQ explaining their thoughts on why anarchism and capitalism are incompatible. While the FAQ was written by many collaborators, the main contributors are listed in the introduction as Iain McKay (primary contributor and editor), Gary Elkin, Dave Neal and Ed Boraas, who refer to themselves as The Anarchist FAQ Editorial Collective. However, the editors eventually decided that an anarchist FAQ which focused on anarchism itself would be a better idea than one solely devoted to refuting the notion of anarcho- capitalism and so the FAQ was born. The authors acknowledge that \\"it still bears some of the signs of its past-history. For example it gives the likes of Ayn Rand, Murray Rothbard, and so on, far too much space outside of Section F‚Äîthey really are not that important\\". The FAQ thanks the following people for their contributions: Andrew Flood, Mike Ballard, Francois Coquet, Jamal Hannah, Mike Huben, Greg Alt, Chuck Munson, Pauline McCormack, Nestor McNab, Kevin Carson, Shawn Wilbur \\"and our comrades on the anarchy, oneunion and organise! mailing lists\\". A 2003 Critical Studies in Media Communication study declared the FAQ the most prominent core anarchist website, finding that it received incoming links from 20% of the anarchist websites studied. The FAQ was published in paperback in two volumes by AK Press, Oakland/Edinburgh: * Volume I: 2008, 558 pages, . * Volume II: 2012; 550 pages, .  Content  The editors of the FAQ identify themselves as belonging to the social anarchist branch of anarchism (defined as anarcho-communism, anarcho-syndicalism, collectivist anarchism and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's mutualism). Despite this, the FAQ presents and describes other anarchist schools of thought such as individualist anarchism, anarcha-feminism and some lesser known theories like platformism and anarcho-primitivism. It cites references from a variety of authors from these schools and its bibliography contains over five hundred sources. According to the FAQ, anarchism is synonymous with libertarian socialism, free socialism, libertarian communism and free communism.\\"A.1 What is anarchism?\\". Given the wide range of anarchist ideas, the authors acknowledge that many anarchists will not agree with everything that the FAQ says. However, they express their belief that \\"most anarchists will agree with most of what we present and respect those parts with which they do disagree with as genuine expressions of anarchist ideas and ideals\\". The FAQ also explains disputes within anarchist thought, such as where and why social anarchists and individualist anarchists disagree. As social anarchists, the writers also explain their own views on individualist anarchism, arguing that while individualist anarchism has importance it also has contradictions and \\"many flaws\\", stating that it would lead to a \\"hierarchical and non-anarchist\\" society.\\"G.4 Why do social anarchists reject individualist anarchism?\\". They also defend against individualist anarchists' criticisms of social anarchism, claiming that \\"much of this opposition was rooted in misunderstandings and, at times, outright distortion\\". The FAQ does not accept anarcho-capitalism as part of individualist anarchism, nor of anarchism in general. The FAQ writers explain and criticise anarcho-capitalism in sections F and to some extent G of the FAQ. They assert that \\"outside the net [anarcho-capitalists] are irrelevant and on the net they are just annoying\\" and call the arguments of anarcho-capitalists \\"inane'\\". A critique of Bryan Caplan's \\"Anarchism Theory FAQ\\" is also presented in the first appendix, along with arguments that Caplan's FAQ distorts anarchism's relationship with anarcho-capitalism.  Influence and reception  The FAQ has been complimented by several sources. The anarcho-syndicalist Solidarity Federation called it an \\"invaluable resource\\" and \\"highly recommended\\" for people wishing \\"to gain a better understanding of anarchism\\".Direct Action (44). p. 30. Flint Jones, a member of NEFAC, hailed the FAQ as \\"the most comprehensive [anarchist] resource available\\". The Workers Solidarity Movement, an Irish anarchist group, called it \\"the primary source of information about anarchism on the world wide web\\".Workers Solidarity (62). Quebecer anarchist Normand Baillargeon calls it a \\"monumental and essential FAQ dedicated to anarchism\\".L'order moins le pouvoir: Histoire et actualit√© de l'anarchisme (in French). The FAQ has been cited by communications scholar Joseph M. Reagle Jr. \\"[as] an exemplar of the principles [of community governance]\\". In recent years, the FAQ has been cited in various published works, such as Viable Utopian Ideas: Shaping a Better World (2003) by Arthur Shostak and Utopia and Organization (2002) by Martin Parker. It has been described as \\"very comprehensive\\" by Paul Graham and John Hoffman in their Introduction to Political Ideologies (2006). Various versions of the FAQ have been translated into eight languages and it has been included in every stable Debian release since 1999.\\"An Anarchist FAQ ‚Äì Translations\\" (1 January 2018). Infoshop. Retrieved 21 February 2019. An older version of the FAQ was once criticised by one of the anarcho-capitalists it was written to oppose. Writing in 1997 and referring to the 1996 version of the FAQ, David D. Friedman complained about what he called the authors' \\"irresponsibility\\" in making errors in their account of Icelandic history and by attributing to him a position which he did not hold. He claimed that the authors' methodology was to first \\"make up their facts\\", then correct errors as he points them out, hoping that they eventually come up with a true account. The authors corrected their misstatement of Friedman's view in later versions when they became aware of his criticism. While they acknowledged that the 1996 version of the FAQ did contain some errors concerning medieval Iceland and was poorly fact-checked, they denied that this represents a \\"disregard for the truth\\" and they argue their critique was still valid despite \\"some serious errors in details\\".\\"An Anarchist FAQ, David Friedman and Medieval Iceland\\". . Retrieved 27 July 2008. Mutualist and individualist anarchist Kevin Carson called the FAQ a \\"[m]onumental compendium on anarchist history, theory and practice\\". However, Carson disagreed with the FAQ's analysis of anarcho-capitalism.Carson, Kevin (July 2006). \\"Anarchist FAQ Update\\". Mutualist Blog: Free Market Anti- Capitalism. Blog Spot. Retrieved 20 January 2020. He referred to the FAQ's treatment of anarcho-capitalism as \\"probably the FAQ's weakest spot\\", continuing: \\"[While] I consider anarcho-capitalism to be considerably diverged from classical individualist anarchism, [I] also reject any blanket assertion that they can't be 'real anarchists'\\".

Tolver Jr. (born January 13, 1980) is a 6\\"1' 205 lbs. wide receiver for the Los Angeles Avengers in the Arena Football League (AFL). He was born on January 13, 1980, in Long Beach, California, to Gregory Tolver Sr. and Brenda Tolver. Tolver attended Mira Mesa Senior High School where he began his football career. Playing career =High school= He was a two-year starter and a three-year letterman as the quarterback of the Mira Mesa Marauders. During his senior year, he was selected to the All-Academic team and he was also named the most valuable player for the Marauders. He passed for 1,880 yards and 15 touchdown along with 1,004 yards and 5 touchdowns in his last year. Tolver accounted for 410 yards alone (278 yards passing and 132 yards rushing). Although Tolver's main focus was football, he was also a two- year letterman on the Mira Mesa men's basketball team. =College career= Tolver attended college at San Diego State University where he would earn a degree in business. Tolver finished his collegiate career for the San Diego State Aztecs with a total of 262 receptions for 3,572 yards and 17 touchdowns. During his senior year with the Aztecs, he accumulated 128 catches for 1,785 yards and 13 touchdowns, which made him a unanimous choice to be on the All- Mountain West Conference First Team. He was also placed on a couple of All- American teams after leading the entire nation in receiving yards per game with 137 yards per contest (13.9 yards per reception). He also finished second in the nation in catches per game averaging close to 9 receptions per game. By scoring 86 points as a senior, Tolver led the San Diego State Aztecs in scoring and was honored by the Mountain West Conference as the Player of the Week three time including after a 12-reception, 296-yard game versus the Arizona State Sun Devils. During his junior season, he was the Aztecs' leading receiver with 63 receptions for 878 yards and 2 touchdowns. He became a starter as a redshirt sophomore followed by a 62-catch, 808-yard season. =Professional career= In the 2003 NFL Draft, Tolver was selected in the 5th round as the 169th pick by the Miami Dolphins. On November 25, 2003, he was placed on the injured reserve list due to a right knee injury. He was removed from the Injured Reserved list on February 23, 2004, but would eventually be cut on September 5, 2004. On October 19, 2005, Tolver was the newest addition to the Dallas Cowboys practice squad and on January 3, 2006, the Cowboys signed him to the team. But it would not last long with him being cut from the team on August 28, 2006. After spending four years in and out of the NFL, he finally landed in the Arena Football League signing a contract with the Los Angeles Avengers on February 14, 2008. Broadcasting career Tolver is a guest member on the NBC 7/39 Football Night sportscaster team in San Diego. Coaching career Tolver is the head coach for Sage Hill School's football team. His first season was the fall 2009 season where he led the Lightning a 7‚Äì4 season (2‚Äì1 in league) which helped redeem the team who only won 2 games in the 2008 season before Tolver signed on as the coach. In his second season, he led the Lightning to an 8‚Äì3 record. Tolver also serves as the school's athletic director. Personal life During his younger years, he collected over 5,000 sports card including Barry Sanders' and Jerry Rice's rookie cards. He also started a business of his own in solid waste management. Tolver's younger brother, Tredale Tolver, attended and played football at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. Tolver also spent a number of years in Mansfield, Louisiana.

It was named after United States Army Air Forces Brigadier General Howard Knox Ramey. Following its closure, it was redeveloped into Rafael Hernandez Airport. History =Pre-World War II= In 1939, the U.S. Army Air Corps sent Major George C. Kenney to Puerto Rico to conduct a preliminary survey of possible air base sites on Puerto Rico. He examined a total of 42 sites and declared that Punta Borinquen the best site for a major air base. Planted sugar cane farms covered some 3796 acres that the government purchased for military use in the first week of September 1939 at a cost of $1,215,000. Later that year, Major Karl S. Axtater assumed command of what was to become Borinquen Army Airfield. =World War II era= During World War II, the following squadrons were assigned to the airfield: * Headquarters, 25th Bombardment Group, 1 November 1940 ‚Äì 1 November 1942; 5 October 1943 ‚Äì 24 March 1944 : 417th Bombardment Squadron, 21 November 1939 ‚Äì 13 April 1942 (Douglas B-18 Bolo) : 10th Bombardment Squadron, 1 November 1940 ‚Äì 1 November 1942 (B-18 Bolo) : 12th Bombardment Squadron, 1 November 1940 ‚Äì 8 November 1941 (B-18 Bolo) : 35th Bombardment Squadron, 31 October-11 November 1941 (B-18 Bolo) * 44th Bombardment Squadron (40th Bombardment Group) 1 April 1941 ‚Äì 16 June 1942 (B-18 Bolo) * 20th Troop Carrier Squadron (Panama Air Depot) June 1942 ‚Äì July 1943 (Douglas C-47 Skytrain) * 4th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron (72d Reconnaissance Group) 27 October 1943 ‚Äì 21 May 1945; 5 October 1945 ‚Äì 20 August 1946 =Cold War era= With the establishment of an independent United States Air Force in 1947, the complex was renamed Ramey Air Force Base in 1948. Ramey AFB was home to a succession of Strategic Air Command (SAC) strategic reconnaissance wings and a bombardment wing, and housed a number of B-36 Peacemaker intercontinental bombers, albeit in its RB-36 strategic reconnaissance version. The RB-36s were later replaced by B-52 Stratofortress heavy bombers and KC-135 Stratotanker aerial refueling aircraft, while a tenant weather reconnaissance squadron operated WB-47 Stratojet and WC-130 Hercules aircraft. Due to the size and weight of the B-36, the runway at Ramey had to be built to a length of 11,702 ft and a width of 200 ft, with an added 870 ft Blast Pad at each end and an additional 50 ft shoulder on each side. The closure of Ramey Air Force Base began in 1971 as part of a SAC-wide reduction in bombardment wings and lasted until 1973. Following its closure, it was converted into a joint civilian-military airport with the U.S. Coast Guard comprising the remaining military aviation activities at the airport as Coast Guard Air Station Borinquen and Puerto Rico Air National Guard, Army National Guard and the United States Army Reserve maintaining non-aviation units. * Antilles Air Command, 1 March-25 August 1946 : As: Antilles Air Division, 12 January 1948 ‚Äì 22 January 1949 * 24th Composite Wing, 25 August 1946 ‚Äì 28 June 1948 * 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing, 1 November 1950 - 1953 * 72nd Strategic Reconnaissance Wing, 1953 - 1959 (RB-36 Peacemaker) * 72nd Bombardment Wing, 1959 - 30 June 1971 (B-52 Stratofortress) =U.S. Naval Facility Ramey/Punta Borinquen= Success with a test array and then a full scale forty element operational array at Eleuthera, Bahamas 1951-1952 led the Navy in 1952 to order six, quickly expanded to nine, undersea surveillance systems under the classified name of Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) to be installed under the unclassified name Project Caesar. The shore terminals were described as supporting \\"oceanographic research\\" and given the generic and ambiguous name \\"Naval Facility\\" with the actual submarine detection purpose classified on a strict need-to-know. The first of the systems was to terminate at a Naval Facility (NAVFAC) on a beach under the cliff of the Air Force Base (). Construction began in 1953 with Naval Facility Ramey commissioned on 18 September 1954. In 1985 with mobile, towed arrays entering the system, SOSUS became the Integrated Undersea Surveillance System (IUSS). SOSUS/IUSS mark their beginnings with the commissioning of Naval Facility Ramey. The facility, unlike NAVFAC Grand Turk and NAVFAC San Salvador completed later that year and not close to a military base, got support for all functions except its classified operations from the base. When the Air Force Base closed 1 January 1974 the facility became Naval Facility Punta Borinquen and self supporting until it was decommissioned 30 April 1976. Remaining military presence In 1971, as a result of the closing of Naval Air Station Isla Grande, the United States Coast Guard relocated its aviation activities to Ramey. The Coast Guard took possession of an outstanding hangar, a part of the Air Force housing area and the DoDEA Ramey School for the newly formed Coast Guard Air Station Borinquen. The Coast Guard Exchange system operates a CGX near the coast guard air station. The Punta Borinquen Light was also transferred to the Coast Guard. Punta Borinquen Radar Station near the Ramey Golf Course is a Puerto Rico Air National Guard facility, home for the 141st Air Control Squadron. The United States Army Reserve operates the Ramey United States Army Reserve Center. The Puerto Rico National Guard also has some Army National Guard units and facilities at the former Air Force Base. Military retirees choose to settle in the area mostly because of the Ramey Golf Course and services they are entitled to at the coast guard air station.

She was sentenced to death for conspiring to commit high treason and undermining the fighting forces (Wehrkraftzersetzung). Early life and family Elisabeth von Thadden was born in Mohrungen, East Prussia (present-day MorƒÖg, Poland) to the long-established noble Thadden family. Her parents were Adolf Gerhard Ludwig von Thadden (1858-1932), Prussian county commissioner (Landrat) of Landkreis Greifenberg in Pomerania (now Powiat Gryficki in Poland), and Ehrengard von Gerlach (1868‚Äì1909).Schw√∂bel 2005, p. 247Riemenschneider 2013, pp. 231-232 She was the eldest of five children. In 1905, the family moved to the Trieglaff (Trzyg≈Ç√≥w) estate in Pomerania, where Thadden grew up in a big Protestant family. Elisabeth's brother, Reinold (1891-1976), grew up to be a famous theologian and jurist, and her nephew, Reinold's son, Rudolf (born 1932) is a well-known German historian. Her sister, Ehrengard Schramm (1900‚Äì1985), was a Social Democratic politician and member of the Lower Saxon Landtag. Her half- brother Adolf von Thadden (1921-1996), however, rose to be the National Democratic Party's chairman after World War II in West Germany. Elisabeth herself never married and has no direct descendants. Elisabeth attended boarding school in Baden-Baden and the renowned Reifenstein school.Riemenschneider 2013, p. 233 Upon her mother's death in 1909, Thadden took over managing the family estate, as well as the care of her youngest siblings.Schw√∂bel 2005, p. 248 She kept an open and hospitable house in Trieglaff, which also was the scene of several discussion circles organized by her and her father. These Trieglaffer Konferenzen attracted politicians, theologians, jurists, and scientists of many political stripes. Here she met with Friedrich Siegmund-Schultze, a theologian, social pedagogue and pioneer of the peace movement, who became a close friend. Thadden always felt a keen connection with her fellow human beings, and this showed up early on when, during World War I, she made it possible for many city children to spend time in the somewhat more idyllic setting of Trieglaff.Riemenschneider, Thierfelde 2013, p. 235 Career Elisabeth von Thadden School, Heidelberg After the war, in 1920, Elisabeth's father remarried to Barbara Blank (1895‚Äì1972). Thadden and her sisters left Trieglaff, she herself moved to Berlin to pursue a career in education. She attended the Soziale Frauenschule led by social reformer Alice Salomon, where she came into contact with educational progressivism.Schw√∂bel 2005, p. 250 After training there, she got a job at a children's camp in Heuberg in the Swabian Jura, later also gaining experience at the Kurt Hahn school.Riemenschneider 2013, pp. 237-238 Having been offered the opportunity to lease an unoccupied country house, Schloss Wieblingen near Heidelberg, in 1926, Thadden quickly found a use for it. At Easter 1927, after receiving government approval to do so, as well as obtaining the requisite funds, Schloss Wieblingen became the home of Thadden's Evangelisches Landerziehungsheim f√ºr M√§dchen, a private boarding school for girls incorporating the Christian ethics that Thadden had been brought up with and held dear, as well as Kurt Hahn's educational ideas.Riemenschneider 2013, pp. 239-240 The initial enrolment was thirteen girls, whom Thadden hoped to train \\"strictly and fairly to (be) independently thinking, emancipated women.\\" The 1920s were also the time when the National Socialists were rising to prominence. By the time Thadden founded her school, Adolf Hitler had already been released from prison after the Beerhall Putsch, and the Nazis were gaining popularity. Thadden herself even found a certain appeal in Nazi ideas in the beginning, but she soon decided otherwise, and came to regard the Nazis' vision for Germany as one quite at odds with her own humanitarian views.Schw√∂bel 2005, p. 252  Third Reich  After the Nazis came to power in 1933, tension between the authorities and Thadden's school began to grow. Thadden disregarded official edicts and continued to enroll Jewish girls at her school.Riemenschneider 2013, p. 245 She also kept seeing her Jewish friends. Thadden was also not shy about stating her views out loud, and for this reason she was ever more under the Gestapo's gaze. In October 1940, after the school had been evacuated to Tutzing in Bavaria because it was too near the French border, a pupil denounced the school to the Gestapo and the SD. Thadden decided to take the school back to Wieblingen, where she hoped that its widely acknowledged good name would keep such harassment away. It did not, however. In May 1941, the Education Ministry of Baden saw in Thadden's school \\"no satisfactory guarantee for a National-Socialist-aligned education\\", whereupon the school was nationalized.Riemenschneider 2013, pp. 245-246 Thadden went back to Berlin and joined the Red Cross as a nursing assistant. Here, according to her sister Ehrengard, she learnt, among other things, that letters reaching Germany from German prisoners of war in the Soviet Union had to be destroyed because Hitler believed that they would weaken morale at the front.Riemenschneider 2013, p. 247  Arrest and execution  Thadden developed contacts with opponents of the Nazi r√©gime, including Helmut Gollwitzer, Martin Niem√∂ller, and Elly Heuss-Knapp, and she also engaged in activities such as gathering food stamps for people in hiding and affording those threatened by the r√©gime a chance to leave the country. In doing so she either underestimated how dangerous these activities were, or acted without regard for her own safety. She also belonged to the Solf Circle, a group considered by the Nazis to be part of the German Resistance. Led by an ambassador's widow and her daughter, and much like the Trieglaffer Konferenzen of Thadden's youth, it attracted people from various walks of life with a variety of political views, who came to discuss pressing issues. At one such meeting on 10 September 1943, hosted by Elisabeth von Thadden, one of the guests was an assistant doctor named Paul Reckzeh, who, as it turned out, was a Gestapo informant. He had been sent by order of investigator Herbert Lange to make contact with the Solf Circle to find traitors to the Reich.So wurde Elisabeth von Thadden an die Gestapo verraten, Rhein-Neckar Zeitung, 8.September 2019, His report to his Gestapo superiors was quite damning, leading the Gestapo to observe the participants to uncover their connections abroad. Over the next few months many were arrested, including Elisabeth von Thadden early on 12 January 1944, after she had moved to a post in Meaux in occupied France. From Meaux she was brought to Paris and later to Berlin. There followed months of dreadful treatment and lengthy interrogations in various prisons and in the penal bunker at Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp. On 1 July 1944, the Volksgerichtshof, presided over by Roland Freisler, sentenced Elisabeth von Thadden to death for conspiring to commit high treason and undermining the fighting forces (Wehrkraftzersetzung). Ten weeks later, on 8 September 1944, at 17:00, she was beheaded at Pl√∂tzensee Prison in Berlin. Her last words were: \\"Put an end, Lord, to all our sufferings\\" quoted from Befiehl du deine Wege, a Lutheran hymn by Paul Gerhardt.Schw√∂bel 2005, p. 256Riemenschneider 2013, pp. 251  Legacy  Stolperstein in Berlin- Charlottenburg A doctor from Charit√© saw to it that Thadden's body was returned to her family for cremation. In 1949, the urn containing her ashes was entombed in the grounds of Schloss Wieblingen.Baron, R√ºdeger (2013). Elisabeth von Thadden (1890-1944), Soziale Arbeit 3:2013, 116-117 The now renamed Elisabeth-von-Thadden-Schule, the school that she had founded in the 1920s, is once again a private school in Heidelberg-Wieblingen, although since 1982 it is now coeducational and since 1992 has ceased to be a boarding school. It does, however, retain a strong link with its founder's philosophy and her memory. The chapel \\"Redemptoris Mater\\" in the Vatikan contains mosaics showing martyrs, including Elisabeth von Thadden.Ringshausen, Gerhard (2004).

It is approximately east of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The Ministry of Science and Higher Education admits qualified students to Haramaya University based on their score on the Ethiopian Higher Education Entrance Examination (EHEEE).  History  Front entrance to Haramaya University. Haramaya University is one of the oldest higher learning institutions in Ethiopia which has gone through more than six decades of gigantic transformations since its establishment as an Imperial Ethiopian College of Agricultural and Mechanical of Arts (IECAMA) in the early 1950s. Its foundation was necessitated with the need for modernizing and advancing Ethiopia's agriculture through the production of trained manpower and pragmatic research and extension programs. To this end, the governments of Ethiopia and the United States of America signed an Agreement under the Point Four Program on May 15, 1952. This was followed by the establishment of Jimma Agricultural Technical School and IECAMA. The Jimma School began to function as a source of and interim institution for the College students pending the foundation of an agricultural College. The Agreement between the Government of Ethiopia and the Technical Cooperation Administration of the Government of the United States of America was signed on May 16, 1952, which gave the mandate to Oklahoma State University (OSU) to establish and operate the college, carry out a nationwide system of Agricultural Extension via agricultural research and experimental station. Subsequently, with the recommendation of His Imperial Majesty, Emperor Haile Sellasie I, the envisioned IECAMA was established at its present location, Haramaya, near the historic Lake Haramaya. The area covers a total of 440 hectares of land. The establishment involved the construction of physical plant and enormous facilities of the campus including students‚Äô dormitories, the cafeteria, the classrooms, the clinic, farm shop and staff dwellings largely in 1950s. With the completion of the first phase of construction in 1956, the college began its function with the arrival of its 1954 first batch of 14 students of senior class from Addis Ababa to the emerging Haramaya campus for their final semester. During its 1956/57 academic year, 11 of these students completed their studies and graduated with a B.Sc. Degree in General Agriculture. The formal inauguration of the college with the presence of the Emperor came on 10 January 1958 with the aim of producing trained manpower in field of agriculture. This was subsequently followed by the commencement of such new B.Sc. fields of training programs in agriculture as Plant Sciences and Animal Sciences (1960), Agricultural Engineering Technology (1961), and Agricultural Economics and Business (1962). With these, the enrolment of students started to steadily increase. Since its inception to 1963, the college's academic and administration wings remained virtually under the mandate and assistance of Oklahoma State University. Nevertheless, following the appointment of Mekonnen Kibret as the first Ethiopian dean of the college in 1966, the Oklahomans‚Äô role began to be limited to the levels of supervisory and technical assistance. Following the contractual termination of Oklahoma State University in 1968, the College became a chartered member of Haile Sellasie I University (now Addis Ababa University). Apart from agriculture, the need for trained manpower in other field of studies led to the launching of such additional academic programs in the college as Home Economics (1967), Science Teachers‚Äô Training Program (1978) and Continuing Education Program (1980). The other milestone in the institutional history of the College of Agriculture was the launching of graduate program in the fields of Plant Sciences, Animal Sciences and Agricultural Economics in 1980. Former Presidents of Haramaya University.The College's three decades of functions and advances in terms of teaching, research and extension programs bore remarkable value in venturing in to a new chapter of institutional development in 1985 when the Alemaya College of Agriculture upgraded its status in to a University of Agriculture. This was followed by the launching of Forestry program in 1987. The academic programs of became further diversified towards training qualified manpower in different fields of studies both at undergraduate and graduate programs. The 1995/96 academic year ushered in another phase of institutional transformation of the University with the commencement of the Faculty of Education and Faculty of Health Sciences. These new faculties further diversified the academic programs and enabled the institution to be transformed into a full- fledged University. In the subsequent years, the University perpetuated to go through unprecedented phases of expansion and transformation in terms of physical facilities and academic programs. New Faculties were opened which include Faculty of Law, Faculty of Business and Economics (September, 2002) Faculty of Veterinary Medicine (2003), Faculty of Technology (2004). In February 2006, Alemaya University was named as Haramaya University (HU). In 2008/09 academic years, Faculty of Applied Sciences and Faculty of Computing and Informatics were further added. The diversification of such academic units has expanded both the undergraduate and graduate programs. Going through such remarkable phases of transformations, the University then started to function in three campus premises (main campus, Harar and Chiro). Subsequently, HU reorganized the previous faculties in to 10 Colleges, one Institute, and one Academy, namely: College of Agriculture and Environmental Science (CAES),College of Business and Economics(CBE), College of Computing and Informatics (CCI), College of Medical and Health Sciences(CMHS), College of Social Sciences and Humanities(CSSH), College of Law (COL), College of Veterinary Medicine(CVM), College of Natural and Computational Sciences (CNCS), College of Education and Behavioral Sciences(CEBS), Directorate of Continuing and Distance Education (CCDE) and Haramaya Institute of Technology (HIT) and Academy of Sport Sciences. Under these Colleges and Institutes, the University offers diverse academic programs in both regular, and non-regular programs which include summer, Distance and Continuing Education. Besides, the University has also undertaken diverse reform activities towards restructuring itself customer responsive and offer high standard services. Likewise, trend of research and extension programs in HU has also steadily evolved since its inception as a College. Through decades, the institution has also established linkages with the national and international organizations to strength its academic programs, research and outreach activities. As the oldest institution of agricultural education, research and extension in Ethiopia for more than six decades, the University has been developing and releasing several improved crop varieties and many crop and livestock management practices. The traditions of research and outreach programs in other emerging academic units have also been evolving, despite lack of experiences and the required manpower. In such long decades of research endeavors, the University has also produced numerous textbooks, book chapters, research articles, bulletins, proceedings, posters and PhD dissertations and master thesis research reports. The University is expected to further reorient and link its academic programs to its research and outreach activities towards making its training programs more pertinent to the needs of stakeholders and the society at large. This necessitates the need to make proper linkage with diverse stockholders. In general, in terms of research, the University is also striving to be one of the leading research Universities in Africa in 2025. Currently, HU functions in two campus premises: the historic and main campus at Haramaya which is situated in East Hararghe Zone, close to Haramaya town, at about east of Addis Ababa between Dire Dawa and Harar cities. The other campus which is exclusively devoted to the College of Health and Medical Sciences with Hiwot Fana Specialized University Teaching Hospital, is located in Harar city. In its both regular and non-regular programs, HU offers a total of 197 Regular academic programs, of which 74 are undergraduate programs, 119 postgraduate programs (92 second degree and 27 third degree program) and 4 are specialty certificates in Medicine and 6 are special certificates of Postgraduate Diploma. In these academic units, the University has now a total of 30,355 enrolled students, including 24,542 are undergraduate students, 4371 are Masters‚Äô students are 1540 postgraduate diploma students. Besides, the University has 1,760 academic and 5,236 administrative staff members.

As a pioneering institution of research and extension in Ethiopia, the university has developed and released considerable number of technologies. It has also been disseminating the generated technologies and knowledge to end users in partnership with a number of local, national, and international stakeholders. Given the university's vision of moving to a postgraduate and research university, the Research Affairs Office has re- structured its research undertakings into six broad research thematic areas. These are Poverty and Environmental Sustainability; Human Health, Nutrition and Welfare; Energy, Engineering, and Information Technologies; Human and Social Development; Institutions, Innovation Systems, and Economic Development; and Basic Sciences Research. The Office has good track record of granting and managing research undertakings supported by various organizations. Through projects, the university has established a long- standing collaboration and relationships with universities and institutions nationally and internationally. Internationally, collaborative institutions and funding organizations are from various European, African, Asian, and American countries. Major funding institutions, among others, include the World Bank, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, European Union, CDC, WHO, and USAID. To disseminate its research findings to the users, the university regularly publishes East African Journal of Sciences, East African Journal of Health and Biomedical Sciences, East African Journal of Social Sciences and Humanities, East African Journal of Animal and Veterinary and Animal Sciences; and Haramaya Law Review. In addition, it disseminates information through proceedings of Annual Research and Extension Review Workshops and occasionally hosted workshops organized focusing on contemporary issues. For supporting its research undertakings, the university provides various research facilities to researchers. These include, among others, its various research stations spread over diverse geographical areas and research specialties (Rare Crops Research Station, Haramaya Animal Sciences Research Station, Babile Lowland Crops Research Station, Berkele Tropical Fruits Research Station, Erer Camel Research Station, Fedis Research Station, Hirna Crops Research Station, Gurawa Research Station, Dire Dawa Tony Farm Fruits Research Station, and Kersa Demographic Surveillance System). The research and extension office of the university has been in charge of coordinating the research and extension activities of the university.

In 1933 she travelled to Shanghai, a city that before World War II attracted many European √©migr√©s including revolutionaries from the Spanish Civil War, Jews and other refugees escaping the Nazis. She decided to stay, as did many others, and became fascinated by the social and political goals of the unfolding Chinese Revolution. Initially Weiss worked as a freelance journalist in Shanghai.

He is the son of Prince Moulay Abdallah of Morocco, the late brother of former King Hassan II, and Princess Lalla Lamia Solh, daughter of Riad Al Solh, the first Prime Minister of Lebanon. He is also the cousin of Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia, whose mother Mona Al Solh is another daughter of the Lebanese family. Under the Moroccan constitution, Moulay Hicham stands fourth in the line of succession to the Alaouite throne. In his youth, Prince Moulay Hicham garnered the nickname \\"Red Prince\\" because of his progressive political positions. Since the 1990s, he has become an outspoken advocate for constitutional monarchy in Morocco and democracy in the broader Middle East. These controversial positions have distanced him from the Moroccan palace, and are thought to have created personal conflict with King Mohammed VI and other political forces. Partly for this reason, in recent years, he has attracted the new label of the \\"Rebel Prince.\\" In 2018, he publicly announced his desire to renounce his royal title and institutionally sever ties with the Moroccan monarchy. In a widely watched January 2019 interview on BBC Arabic, the prince expressed his hope that while the Moroccan monarchy could eventually embark upon meaningful democratic reforms, he wished his role to be that of a scholarly advocate rather than a political figure. Prince Moulay Hicham regularly speaks on issues of human rights, democratic reform, and social movements at public forums around the world, among them the University of M√°laga, HEC Paris, University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, Northwestern University, Tufts University, University of California at Berkeley, Columbia University, Harvard University, and Yale University, as well as prominent broadcast media like BBC News and France 24. Since the 1990s, he has also published numerous essays on political reform, democracy, religion, culture, and development in the Middle East in English, French, and Arabic language journals and newspapers. He was most recently a consulting professor at the Center for Democracy, Development, and Rule of Law at Stanford University.Faculty Profile He is currently based at Harvard University as a Research Associate at the Weatherhead Center.Hicham Alaoui Profile at Weatherhead Center Professional activities *Founder and President of the Hicham Alaoui Foundation, a non-profit private foundation supporting social science research on the Arab world at leading universities, such as the Arab Reform and Democracy program at Stanford. *Co-founder, along with John Waterbury and Abdellah Hammoudi, of the Institute for the Transregional Study of the Contemporary Middle East, North Africa and Central Asia (TRI) at Princeton University. *Founder and principal of Al Tayyar Energy, a renewable energy firm with major investments in Thailand and other developing nations. *Principal officer for United Nations peacekeeping missions, most prominently in Kosovo in 2000. *Advisory Board Member of the Middle East program of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. *Numerous past advisory positions for pro-democracy NGOs, including Human Rights Watch and the Carter Center. *Producer of the 2012 award-winning documentary on democratization and dictatorship, A Whisper to a Roar, in collaboration with director Ben Moses. Personal life As a member of the Moroccan royal family, Prince Moulay Hicham was raised in the palace quarter of Rabat alongside his brother and cousins, including the current King Mohammed VI. He attended the Rabat American School and graduated from Princeton University in 1985 with an A.B. in an independent concentration after completing a 137-page senior thesis titled \\"Sources of Success and Failure in the Palestinian National Movement.\\" As his father, Moulay Abdallah, died during his college education, the prince developed a close relationship with King Hassan. He later attended Stanford University for graduate study in political science. Many of these events are outlined in his memoirs, Journal d'un Prince Banni, published in April 2014 to considerable controversy. In 2002, Prince Moulay Hicham relocated to Princeton, New Jersey with his family due to political tensions with King Mohammed VI and other elements of the Moroccan monarchy. He is married since 1995 to Sharifa Lalla Malika Benabdelali, a cousin of the Moroccan businessman, longtime Minister of Agriculture, and RNI party luminary Aziz Akhannouch. He has two daughters: Sharifa Lalla Faizah Alaoui (born 1996) who attended Yale University, and Sharifa Lalla Haajar Alaoui (born 1999) who attends Princeton University. In 2014, he began pursuing a D.Phil. research degree in Middle East studies at the University of Oxford, which he successfully defended in February 2020. Prince Moulay Hicham's positions have often instigated outside pressures, including personal and financial threats, as well as smear campaigns in Morocco's state-run media sector. In August 2012, Moroccan MP Abdelhadi Khairat accused him of financial embezzlement, a charge that instigated a successful defamation lawsuit and Khairat's eventual apology for the allegations. In May 2014, the French police arrested an individual on stalking charges at Orly Airport, who in turn claimed that several Moroccans had asked him to monitor the prince's movements. In September 2017, he was controversially deported from Tunisia while scheduled to speak at an academic conference held by Stanford University for reasons suspected to be politically motivated. In November 2018, he won a major libel trial in the United Kingdom against the Arabic-language Elaph media outlet, which had published a story accusing him to have plotted against the Moroccan monarchy. That case was also notable in compelling British courts, in the wider context of UK law, to clarify and deepen the meaning of defamation within electronic publications.

History Of Human Rights  = French rule (1920‚Äì1946) = Syrian Revolt of 1925‚Äì1927 From the early 1920s until 1946, Syria and Lebanon were under the control of a French Mandate, officially ratified by the League of Nations on 29 September 1923.League of Nations Official Journal, Vol 3, August 1922, p1013 Human rights concerns during this period included the colonialist treatment of the Druze within their autonomous state in the southern portion of the mandate, as prisoners and peasants there were often used for forced labor. During the Great Revolt, French military forces sieged much of Damascus and the countryside, killing at least 7,000 rebels and displacing over 100,000 civilians. Authorities would publicly display mutilated corpses in central squares within Damascus and villages throughout Syria as a means of intimidating opponents of the government. In 1926, the Damascus military court executed 355 Syrians without any legal representation. Hundreds of Syrians were sentenced to death in absentia, prison terms of various lengths, and life imprisonment with hard labour. Additionally, it was during this period that Syrian Women's Rights groups began to assert themselves, led by individuals like Naziq al-Abid. = Post 1948 = Jews in Syria have been discriminated against, especially since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948. In 1948, Jews were banned from leaving the country and from selling their property. In 1953, all Jewish bank accounts were frozen and Jewish property confiscated. In 1954, Jews were temporarily permitted to emigrate, but they had to leave all their property to the government. In March 1964, Jews were banned from traveling more than from their hometowns. Jews were not allowed to work for the government or banks, could not acquire drivers' licenses, and were banned from purchasing property. Although Jews were prohibited from leaving the country, they were sometimes allowed to travel abroad for commercial or medical reasons. Any Jew granted clearance to leave the country had to leave behind a bond of $300‚Äì$1,000 and family members to be used as hostages to ensure they returned. An airport road was paved over the Jewish cemetery in Damascus, and Jewish schools were closed and handed over to Muslims. The Jewish Quarter of Damascus was under constant surveillance by the secret police, who were present at synagogue services, weddings, bar mitzvahs, and other Jewish gatherings. The secret police closely monitored contact between Syrian Jews and foreigners and kept a file on every member of the Jewish community. Jews also had their phones tapped and their mail read by the secret police.Congressional Record, V. 146, Part 10, July 10 to July 17, 2000 After Israel's victory in the 1967 Six-Day War, restrictions were further tightened, and 57 Jews in Qamishli may have been killed in a pogrom.http://www.sixdaywar.co.uk/jews_in_arab-countries_syrua.htm The communities of Damascus, Aleppo, and Qamishli were under house arrest for eight months following the war. Many Jewish workers were laid off following the Six-Day War. In 1982, President Hafez al-Assad responded to an insurrection led by the Muslim Brotherhood in the city of Hama by sending a paramilitary force that indiscriminately killed between 10,000 and 55,000 civilians including children, women, and the elderly during what became known as the Hama massacre.Syrian Human Rights Committee, The Massacre of Hama, February 19, 2004, reporting 30,000-40,000 massacred and 10,000-15,000 disappeared.

The sign reads: \\"Stop torture and inhumane treatment of prisoners in Syria!\\" Among the scores of prisoners of conscience arrested in 2009, and hundreds of political prisoners already in prison, some of the more prominent prisoners were: * Kamal al-Labwani, a prisoner of conscience who had three years added to his 12-year sentence for allegedly \\"broadcasting false or exaggerated news which could affect the morale of the country\\", on account of remarks he was alleged to have made in his prison cell. * Nabil Khlioui, an alleged Islamist from Deir al-Zour, who with at least 10 other Islamists \\"remained in incommunicado detention without charge or trial at the end of 2009. * Nabil Khlioui and at least 12 other alleged Islamists, mostly from Deir al-Zour, were arrested. At least 10 of them remained in incommunicado detention without charge or trial at the end of the year. * Mashaal Tammo, the killed spokesperson for the unauthorized Kurdish Future Current group, who was \`held incommunicado for 12 days and charged with \\"aiming to provoke civil war or sectarian fighting\\", \\"conspiracy\\" and three other charges commonly brought against Kurdish activists, charges that could lead to the death penalty. * Twelve leaders of a prominent gathering of opposition groups, the Damascus Declaration, continue to serve 30-month prison terms. Among those detained is Riad Seif, 62, a former member of parliament who is in poor health. * Habib Saleh was sentenced to three years in jail for \\"spreading false information\\" and \\"weakening national sentiment\\" in the form of writing articles criticizing the government and defending opposition figure Riad al-Turk. * One released prisoner was Aref Dalila. He had served seven of the ten years in his prison sentence, much of it in solitary confinement and in increasingly poor health, for his involvement in the so-called \\"Damascus Spring\\" before being released by a presidential pardon. * In June 2010, Mohannad al-Hassani, head of the Syrian Organisation for Human Rights (Swasiya) and winner of the 2010 Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders, was convicted of \\"weakening national morale\\" and \\"conveying within Syria false news that could debilitate the morale of the nation.\\" He was sentenced to three years in prison. Sednaya prison alone houses more than 600 political prisoners. The authorities have kept many for years behind bars, often well past their legal sentence. The estimated 17,000 prisoners who have disappeared over the years suggests that Syria may have hidden mass graves. In a 2006 report, Human Rights Watch reported on the continued detention of \\"thousands\\" of political prisoners in Syria, \\"many of them members of the banned Muslim Brotherhood and the Communist Party.\\" According to the Syrian Human Rights Committee that there were 4,000 political prisoners held in Syrian jails in 2006. August 2016, Amnesty International released a report tackling the issue of torture and ill- treatment in Syrian government prisons which amount to crimes against humanity. Since the crisis began in March 2011, the international organization estimated that 17,723 people have died in custody in Syria ‚Äì an average rate of more than 300 deaths each month. According to the report, governmental forces have used torture to scare the opponents. But today, they use it as a part of systematic attack against opposition members. According to testimonies of some survivors, detainees were subjected to numerous kind of torture aiming at dehumanizing them, and in many cases killing them. Amnesty international said that those, who are responsible for these atrocities, must be brought to justice. On 6 July 2020, families of detainees in Syrian government prisons found the pictures of their dead relatives in the media graphics of a forensic police photographer-turned-whistleblower, codenamed, Caesar. The photos are among tens of thousands of images of torture victims, smuggled out of Syria in 2013.  Freedom of religion  The Constitution provides for freedom of religion.Syrian Constitution, Article 35, Paragraphs (1) and (2). However, the Government restricts this right. While there is no official state religion, the Constitution requires that the president be Muslim and stipulates that Islamic jurisprudence, an expansion of Sharia Islamic law, is a principal source of legislation. According to the U.S. Department of State's \\"International Religious Freedom Report 2007\\", the Constitution provides for freedom of faith and religious practice, provided that the religious rites do not disturb the public order. According to the report, the Syrian Government monitored the activities of all groups, including religious groups, discouraged proselytism, which it deemed a threat to relations among religious groups. The report said that the Government discriminated against the Jehovah's Witnesses and that there were occasional reports of minor tensions between religious groups, some attributable to economic rivalries rather than religious affiliation.United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. Syria: International Religious Freedom Report 2007. This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. There is some concern among religious minorities that democratic reforms will result in oppression of religious minorities by Islamist movements that are now repressed.For Syria's minorities, Assad is security. Al Jazeera, 16 September 2011.  Women's rights and LGBT rights  Article 520 of the penal code of 1949, prohibits having homosexual relations, i.e. \\"carnal relations against the order of nature\\", and provides for up to three-years imprisonment. In 2010 the Syrian police began a crackdown that led to the arrest of over 25 men. The men were charged with various crimes ranging from homosexual acts and illegal drug use, to encouraging homosexual behavior and organizing obscene parties. An independent gathering on International Women's Day was violently dispersed by Y.P.G. security forces in 2017.  Freedom of movement  Syrians can not leave the country without an \\"exit visa\\" granted by the authorities. Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides for the human right of Freedom of Movement as such \\"(1) Everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state. (2) Everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own, and return to his country.\\"Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948 Despite this universal human right travel within Syria is discouraged, by the government and the rebels, and Extremist groups and the government have imposed restrictions on the freedom of movement on the people of Syria. Bans have been said to have increased significantly since 2006, though exact statistics are hard to come by as secret security agencies are commonly the ones issuing the bans. The Syrian Constitution, in Article 38(3), allows freedom of movement \\"within the territories of the state unless restricted by a judicial decision or by the implementation of laws of public health and safety.\\"Constitution of the Syrian Arabic Republic 2012 (reformed) From 2011 to 2015, the last four years of the Syrian war, the freedom of movement has been most widely restricted in certain areas and on certain individuals. Restrictions vary between regions, partly because of continuous fighting in certain areas. In rebel held areas there are severe restrictions on the movement of government supporters (or people thought to be government supporters). Foreign diplomats are unable to visit a majority of Syria, and are often not allowed outside of Damascus (Syrian capital). In the areas of Jindires in Afrin, and Ras al Ayn, curfews were executed in 2012 and 2013 as extremist groups put in place a curfew of 5 pm, after which nobody could be seen in public. Then in December 2014, a travel ban was announced on Syrian men aged 18 to 42 (military age). The memorandum supposedly states that all Syrian males must have special permission to leave the country, obtained from army officials.Human Rights Watch, www.hrw.org An example of an individual travel ban is Louay Hussein, president of an opposition group in Syria (Building the Syrian State, or the BSS party), was unable to attend peace talks in Moscow in April 2015 because the government refused to rid of his lifelong travel ban, however on 26 April 2015 Hussein managed to evade his ban and flee to Spain.BBC News, Syrian Dissident Louay Hussein flees to Spain, 27 April 2015 Also Syrian human rights defenders are having their movement restrained by being held in arbitrary arrest. The human rights defenders Mazen Darwish, Hani Al-Zitani, and Hussein Gharir were arrested in February 2012 for ‚Äòpublicizing terrorist acts‚Äô. The United Nations General Assembly has repeatedly called for their release.Human Rights Watch, www.hrw.org Al-Furat University in the city of Deir ez-Zor has been facing movement restrictions by ISIS recently. In January 2015 circulars were issued to ISIS checkpoints in the area to scrutinize all university students passing. To encourage students to abandon their studies and join the ranks of ISIS, the rebels have been restricting the students from traveling between government areas and ISIS-held areas, preventing many students from entering or exiting the university grounds.Ara News, ISIS checkpoints constrain Syrian movements, 9 January 2015 Further from this, there are certain restrictions on movement placed on Women, for example, Syrian law now allows males to place restrictions on certain female relatives. Women over the age of 18 are entitled to travel outside of Syria, however, a woman's husband may file a request for his wife to be banned from leaving the country. From July 2013, in certain villages in Syria (namely Mosul, Raqqu and Deir el-Zour), ISIS no longer allow women to appear in public alone, they must be accompanied by a male relative/guardian known as a mahram.The Guardian, Double-layered Veils and Despair, 17 February 2015 Security checkpoints in civilian areas set up by the government and by ISIS have allowed them to monitor these restrictions. With the males of Syria often being involved in the fighting, no matter which side, this is leaving many Syrian women at home alone with the children, stranded and unable to leave to purchase food and supplies. Further, women in Tel Abyad and Idlib city have been banned from driving by ISIS and Jabhat al- Nursa. Other countries have begun closing their borders to Syrian refugees. On 7 October 2013, Turkey built a two-meter wall on the Syrian border in the Nusaybin district where there was frequent fighting with the rebels. Then on March 9 Turkey closed a further two of its border crossings from Syria, Oncupinar and Cilvegozu, in response to the escalating violence and worries of a terrorist plot. Up until this date Turkey had accepted nearly 2 million Syrian refugees. Aid trucks are still welcome to cross the border, but it is strictly closed to individuals.The Telegraph, Turkey closes two border crossings with Syria amid fears of 'terrorist attack', 30 March 2015 The Syrian government continues its practice of issuing exit visas with strict requirements. They have also closed the Damascus airport frequently because of growing violence. Bans on travel are frequently used against human rights activists and their associates, often these people would not learn about their travel ban until they were prevented leaving the country. Usually no explanations are given for these travel restrictions. The government often bans members of the opposition and their families from traveling abroad, and they are targeted if they attempt to, causing opposition families to fear to attempt to leave Syria for fear of being attacked at the airport or border crossing. Though this action is illegal under international law, Syrian courts have been known to decline to interfere in matters of national security. Article 38(1) provides that \\"no citizen may be deported from the country, or prevented from returning to it\\". This, along with Article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights creates a general legal right to travel internationally. As well as preventing citizens from leaving Syria, there have also been many instances of citizens being prevented from returning to Syria, whether they left illegally or not. A positive step in regards to this was taken on 28 April 2015, when it was announced by Syrian authorities that citizens who had previously fled the war would be able to re-attain passports without a review by the intelligence service, or going through the Department of emigration and passports. These citizens had fled the country illegally and either not taken their passports, or lost them.Ara News, Syria regime to issue passports for citizens abroad, including refugees, 28 April 2015  Freedom of speech and the media  The number of news media has increased in the past decade, but the Ba'ath Party continues to maintain control of the press.Ten years after Bashar el-Assad‚Äôs installation, the government still decides who can be a journalist , Reporters Without Borders USA. Journalists and bloggers have been arrested and tried. In 2009, the Committee to Protect Journalists named Syria number three in a list of the ten worst countries in which to be a blogger, given the arrests, harassment, and restrictions which online writers in Syria faced.\\"10 Worst Countries to be a Blogger\\" , Committee to Protect Journalists, 30 April 2009 Internet censorship in Syria is extensive. Syria bans websites for political reasons and arrests people accessing them. Internet cafes are required to record all the comments users post on chat forums. Websites such as Wikipedia Arabic, YouTube and Facebook were blocked from 2008 to 2011. Filtering and blocking was found to be pervasive in the political and Internet tools areas, and selective in the social and conflict/security areas by the OpenNet Initiative in August 2009.\\"ONI Country Profile: Syria\\" , OpenNet Initiative, August 2009 Syria has been on Reporters Without Borders' Enemy of the Internet list since 2006 when the list was established.\\"Internet Enemies: Syria\\" , Reporters Without Borders, March 2011 In addition to filtering a wide range of Web content, the Syrian government monitors Internet use very closely and has detained citizens \\"for expressing their opinions or reporting information online.\\" Vague and broadly worded laws invite government abuse and have prompted Internet users to engage in self- censorship to avoid the state's ambiguous grounds for arrest. The Syrian Centre for Media and Free Expression was closed by the government in September 2009. It was the country's only NGO specializing in media issues, Internet access, and media monitoring during election campaigns. It had operated without government approval, and had monitored violations of journalists‚Äô rights and had taken up the cause of the ban on the dissemination of many newspapers and magazines. Syrian security forces arrested and beat up protestors on June 15, 2020. The protest started on June 7, 2020, in front of the governorate center against government‚Äôs failure of handling economic downfall, deteriorating living conditions and corruption. HRW appealed the Syrian authority to release the peacefully protesting detainees.  Syrian civil war  During the Syrian civil war, a UN report described actions by the security forces as being \\"gross violations of human rights\\". The UN report documented shooting recruits that refused to fire into peaceful crowds without warning, brutal interrogations including elements of sexual abuse of men and gang rape of young boys, staking out hospitals when wounded sought assistance, and shooting of children as young as two. In 2011 Human Rights Watch stated that Syria's bleak human rights record stood out in the region. While Human Rights Watch doesn't rank offenders, many have characterized Syria's human rights report as among the worst in the world in 2010. While it is claimed that \\"the majority of these violations have been committed by the Syrian government's forces\\", Navi Pillay, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said that each side appeared to have committed war crimes. On 2 March 2018, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said, \\"Syria must be referred to the International Criminal Court. Attempts to thwart justice, and shield these criminals, are disgraceful.\\"Statement by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein Statement by UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein = Detention Centers = Detention Centers run by the Assad government have been one of the most glaring human rights abuses in Syria. In 2014, the Caesar Report showed gruesome photographs smuggled out of a Syria detention center showed \\"the systematic killing of more than 11,000 detainees by the Syrian government in one region\\" during a two and a half year period of the Syria Civil War. In 2017 details emerged about Sednaya Prison, a military prison near Damascus operated by the Assad government. The prison has been used to hold thousands of prisoners, both civilian and government opposition. Amnesty International estimated that between 5,000 and 13,000 people were extrajudicially executed at the one prison between September 2011 and December 2015. Survivor accounts from state-run prisons describe inhumane conditions, starvation, psychological trauma, and torture. Women have also faced human rights abuses and war crimes inside Assad prisons. A 2017 report by Lawyers and Doctors for Human Rights (LDHR) collected first-hand accounts from women who survived rape and torture in Assad prisons. On April 23, 2020, two ex-Syrian secret police officers, Anwar R. and Eyad A., accused of committing war crimes in Syria‚Äôs government- run detention center, appeared in a German court for a first of its kind trial. According to a 2018 report released by the expert panel of United Nations, the Assad government-run detention centers tortured more than 4,000 of the detained protestors and murdered at least 58 others. = Human rights in ISIL-controlled territory = The state of human rights in territories controlled by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has been criticized by many political, religious and other organizations and individuals. The United Nations Commission on Human Rights has stated that ISIL \\"seeks to subjugate civilians under its control and dominate every aspect of their lives through terror, indoctrination, and the provision of services to those who obey\\".  Human rights in the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria  Human rights violations against Kurds included depriving ethnic Kurdish citizens of their citizenship; suppressing Kurdish language and culture; discrimination against citizens based on Kurdish ethnicity; confiscation of Kurdish land and settlement by Arabs. In the course of the Syrian Civil War, parts of Northern Syria gained de facto autonomy within the Kurdish-led Democratic Federation of Northern Syria. In a report \\"'We Had Nowhere Else to Go': Forced Displacement and Demolition in Northern Syria,‚Äù Amnesty International documented allegations of forced evictions of Arabs, Turkmens and Kurds and the destruction of their homes. According to Amnesty International, YPG accused them of having links with ISIL and other Islamist groupa. The report said that ‚Äúin some cases, entire villages have been demolished‚Äù, and that villagers were \\"ordered to leave at gunpoint, their livestock shot at\\". Some persons claimed to Amnesty that ‚Äúthey told us we had to leave or they would tell the US coalition that we were terrorists and their planes would hit us and our families. Threats by the YPG of calling in US airstrikes against villagers were reported. Amnesty International claimed that ‚Äúthese instances of forced displacement constitute war crimes.‚Äù Some Arab and Turkmen claimed that YPG militias have stolen their homes and livestock, burned their personal documents and claimed the land as theirs, and that Turkmen ‚Äúare losing lands where they have been living for centuries.‚Äùhttp://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation- world/world/article24785716.html \\" During the Syrian civil war, several attacks by Arab or Kurdish Muslims have targeted Syrian Christians, including the 2015 al-Qamishli bombings. In January 2016, YPG militias conducted a surprise attack on Assyrian checkpoints in Qamishli, in a predominantly Assyrian area, killing one Assyrian and wounding three others. In October 2015, Amnesty International reported that the YPG had driven civilians from northern Syria and destroyed their homes in retaliation for perceived links to ISIL. The majority of the destroyed homes belonged to Arabs, but some belonged to Turkmens and Kurds. Turkish \\"Daily Sabah\\" claimed that Amnesty International has said that Kurdish PYD conducted ethnic cleansing against Turkmens and Arabs after seizing Tal Abyad. However, Amnesty International has published only one report about the Syrian Kurdish forces and it is related to destroying villages and homes, not ethnic cleansing at all. The Amnesty International report concluded that there are documented cases of forced displacement that constitute war crimes. In 2015, Assyrian and Armenian organizations protested the enforcement of Kurdish self-administration in the Hasaka province, including expropriation of private property by the PYD and interference in church school curricula and also criticized illegal seizure of property, and targeted killings(AINA 2015-11-02) (AINA 2015-11-10). http://www.aina.org/news/20160524145527.htm (AINA 2015-11-02). http://www.aina.org/news/20151110161115.htm http://www.aina.org/news/20151102170051.htm http://www.aina.org/news/20160331123112.htm Assyrians have also criticized the enforcement of revisionist curricula in private and public schools with a Kurdish-nationalist bias. They have claimed that in textbookss the Kurds \\"alter historical and geographical facts\\", including Assyrian place names which are changed to Kurdish names, and students are taught that King Nebuchadnezzar from the Old Testament married a Kurdish woman. Of particular concern are the \\"harassment and arbitrary arrests of the PYD‚Äôs Kurdish political rivals\\" and of civil society leaders noted by human rights organizations. The Y.P.G. is accused of having arrested hundreds of political prisoners. It is claimed that about 150 people were abducted by the Y.P.G. in 2013 alone. Human Rights Watch reported in 2014 that \\"there have been numerous cases of maltreatment in prisons in Rojava\\". Some dissidents were tortured and killedhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/opinion/syria-kurds-isis-raqqa.html \\"Fadhil Dawood, a law professor at a university in a Y.P.G.-held area of northeastern Syria, also said that when he expelled the relative of a Y.P.G. commander from an exam for cheating, he was beaten up and had to flee Rojava.\\" Amnesty International reported in 2015 that the PYD \\"is using a crackdown against terrorism...as a pretext to unlawfully detain and unfairly try peaceful critics and civilians.\\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/four-myths-about- kurds-debunked \\"There are numerous examples of raids of opposition offices and civil society leaders (and killings of protestors) by the PYD in Syria.\\" The PYD has also shot demonstrators, arrested political opponents, and shut down media outlets. Ethnic tensions between Kurds and Arabs have been at the forefront of the conflicts in Syria and Iraq. In Syria, there are widespread reports of Kurdish abuses against Arab civilians, including arbitrary arrests, forced displacement, and reports of YPG forces razing villages. Similar reports of Kurdish forces destroying Arab homes have emerged in the fight for Mosul.

Anyone can make an iStory about anything, as long as they have a program like iWriter, iStory Creator or are familiar with the use of basic HTML coding. iStories is a simple and addictive PC educational tool that allows people to create their own linear or interactive stories by piecing together images, sound and text. It was designed to be simple to use, yet powerful underneath the surface, and it is now being used across the globe for both personal and educational use. iStories links into the highly successful and award-winning digital series, Inanimate Alice, and is co-production between nDreams and the Bradfield Company Ltd. iStories was a project on a short piece of work that was completed by nDreams in early 2008. Formats iStories can be found in three main formats: *.xsp: An .XSP file is an iStory that was created with iStory Creator, but can be played with or without iStory Creator. *.xnp: A .XNP file is an iStory created with iWriter and can only be read with iWriter. *text format: Text Format is the process of creating the HTML text files from scratch, using Notepad or another similar text editor and coding each file individually.  iMag  In September 2007, MAD Studios member, Ethan_odd, created a technology centered \\"iMag\\" (Interactive Magazine) with the title EOE (Ethan_Odd's Electronics). EOE was a \\"pseudo-iStory\\" and reviewed and previewed different technology. On April 28, 2008, EOE was terminated. Even though the site is still up for old EOE downloads, no more have been made. Programs iStories are written with programs like iStory Creator or iWriter. iStory Creator is no longer available through its main site, iPodSoft, but the Windows version can still be downloaded at MAD Studios. iWriter can be downloaded as a 15-day trial version. iPodSoft no longer features iStories on its website. A new iStory creation software is being developed by MAD Studios member, seraphrevan. The project goes by the codename, \\"Project Arcalius\\", named after one of seraphrevan's abandoned iStories. Details on what features the new software will contain have not been disclosed. MAD Shut Down As of May 18, 2008. iStory hosting site, MAD Studios, the #1 iStory distributor, has been shut down by its administrative figure.  Conclusion  Although iStories are not a new concept, as text choose-your-own-adventure (CYOA) games have existed in the past, due to iPodSoft's development of iStory Creator, and with the help of such sites as iStory Silver, iPod Arcade, MAD Studios, and iPodSoft the term iStory has become popular amongst many iPod users who enjoy this form of text entertainment. iStory Silver still hosts their old iStories for download, though new ones sent are no longer being added. They are a good example of what has been achievable with this medium.

It also controlled squadrons without associated same-function wings, i.e., 17th Defense Systems Evaluation Squadron had no associated wing, but its function was part of the 24th Air Division. It is now considered obsolete. History On 16 September 1947, the United States Army Air Forces became the United States Air Force as a separate and equal element of the United States armed forces. Earlier, on 21 March 1946, General Carl A. Spaatz had undertaken a major reorganization of the Army Air Forces that had included the establishment of the major command echelon as the first level of command below Headquarters, USAAF. The World War II commands, which had been subordinate to the numbered air forces, were eliminated in the reorganization of 1946, and the Numbered Air Forces were made components of the major commands at home and overseas. The new organizational hierarchy thus contained the following levels : squadron, group, wing, air force, command. In 1948, and afterward, the World War II wings were redesignated \\"divisions\\", and placed immediately below the numbered air forces in the organizational pyramid. The \\"wing\\" was redefined to be the USAF basic organizational unit which exercised command and control over a \\"Base\\", the physical facility that included the airfield and the support units (groups, squadrons) to support the operation of a wing. In the years after 1948, the Air Force \\"division\\" carried several designations of the name \\"strategic aerospace division\\"; \\"strategic missile division\\"; \\"space division\\", however the most common designation was \\"air division\\". Usage Air divisions were found in all major commands between 1948 and 1992, when the last air division was inactivated. Official policy dictated the use of Arabic numerals for numbered air and aerospace divisions. Examples: 2nd Air Division, 7th Air Division, and 1st Strategic Aerospace Division. Following the initiation of major command-controlled (MAJCON) four-digit Table of Distribution (T/D) organizations in 1948, the major commands were briefly authorized to organize air divisions, provided they secured USAF approval. Two four-digit air divisions (4310th Air Division and 7217th Air Division) were subsequently organized. Besides numbered air divisions, a named air division was an organization within a large support command that was assigned a major or important segment of that command's mission‚Äîe.g., the Electronic Systems Division handled a large part of the Air Force Systems Command's work-load in electronic systems. Because they were usually technical or highly specialized in nature, named divisions generally had a large number of personnel. One named division of an operational command was the USAF Southern Air Division which absorbed resources of the United States Air Forces Southern Command in 1976, and was part of Tactical Air Command. An air division's numerical identification was usually unique to a major command, however when inactivated, the numerical identification could and was used by a different major command if it was reactivated. During the Cuban Missile Crisis three air divisions, provisional, were organized. Air Force record cards contain the following information: *The HQ, Air Division Provisional 1 was organized on 10 Nov 1962 at Homestead AFB, Florida, and assigned to the Air Force Provisional 33 (Fighter Reconnaissance). On 29 Nov 1962, the division was relieved from assignment to Air Force Provisional 33 and assigned directly to Tactical Air Command. At the same time, it was attached to the Air Force Atlantic (ADVON). The HQ, Air Division Provisional 1 was discontinued on 1 June 1963. *The HQ, Air Division Provisional 2 was also organized on 10 Nov 1962 at McCoy AFB, Florida, and assigned to AF Prov 33 (Ftr Recon). On 29 Nov 1962, the division was relieved from assignment to AFProv 33 and assigned directly to Tactical Air Command, with attachment to AF Atlantic (ADVON). The division was discontinued on 1 June 1963. *The Hq, Air Division Provisional 3 was organized on 25 Oct 1962 at MacDill AFB, Florida, and assigned to AF Prov 33 (Ftr Recon). On 29 Nov 1962, the division was relieved from assignment to 33 AF Prov 33 (Ftr Recon) and assigned directly to Tactical Air Command, with attachment to AF Atlantic (ADVON). On 1 June 1963, the division was discontinued. During the Vietnam War air divisions were commonly used as 'placeholder' organizations when the operational wing at an Air Force Base was deployed to Southeast Asia and commanded the remaining groups and squadrons at a single or multiple Air Force bases. Air divisions were gradually phased out of the Air Force command structure after the end of the Vietnam War, with the numbered air force assuming direct command of its subordinate wings. The last existed into the early 1990s and their usage ended with the 1992 major reorganization of the USAF major commands. Vietnam War In Vietnam the USAF's 834th Air Division also had small Divisional lateral units called an \\"elements.\\" The 834th Air Division Airlift Command Center (ALCC commonly called \\"mother\\") operated eight airlift command elements (ALCEs) throughout South Vietnam. The ALCEs were commanded by lieutenant colonels, usually had several supervising majors, a supervising senior NCO (usually an E-7) over AFSC 27150 (mission monitors or mission controllers) E-3s to E-6s. Two famous ALCEs in South Vietnam were Rocket Alley ALCE (pronounce Al-See) at Bien Hoa AB and Sandbox ALCE at Cam Rahn Bay AB. Rocket Alley ALCE was a hard-luck combat assignment while Sandbox ALCE was only occasionally attacked. Branched off of the ALCE were TDY assignments with mobile ALCE units into the Central Highlands and other locations in country. These usually consisted of a lt. col or major, E-6 or E-7, and one or two E-4 or E-5 AFSC 271XX to coordinate C-130, C-7A, and occasional C-123 traffic on unimproved airfields. These mobile ALCE units were testing facilities for newly developed fold-up aluminum honeycomb sleeping quarters, radio rooms, and toilet facilities, all collapsible and moveable aboard a C-130.

Defectors from the Center Union were branded by Papandreou's sympathizers as Apostates (\\"renegades\\"). The Apostasia heralded a prolonged period of political instability, which weakened the fragile post-civil war order, and ultimately led to the establishment of the military regime in April 1967. Background = Rise of the Center Union = In 1961, various factions of Greece's liberal centrist political forces, then known as the \\"Center\\", joined together in a new political party, the Center Union (EK), whose aim was to provide a credible alternative to the National Radical Union (ERE) of Prime Minister Konstantinos Karamanlis. Soon after, Karamanlis called a general election which led to a clear victory for his party. However, Papandreou and other Center Union politicians, as well as the leftist EDA started claiming that Karamanlis' election victory was largely due to \\"violence and vote-rigging\\". Papandreou, a gifted orator, launched a \\"relentless struggle\\" (Greek: ŒëŒΩŒ≠ŒΩŒ¥ŒøœÑŒøœÇ ŒëŒ≥œéŒΩ) aimed at forcing the \\"illegal government\\" of Karamanlis from power. In May 1963 Karamanlis resigned, officially over a dispute with King Paul on the latter's planned visit to the UK, although there is speculation that the \\"Relentless Struggle\\" and other crises (most notably the assassination of leftist independent MP Gregorios Lambrakis, with alleged involvement of the police and the secret service) had greatly weakened Karamanlis' position. A general election in late 1963 resulted in Center Union coming first, although without achieving an absolute majority. Papandreou was appointed Prime Minister and gained a vote of confidence in Parliament, since EDA also voted for him. However, EDA was considered, by Greece's political establishment of the time, including Papandreou himself, as a simple front for the outlawed Communist Party of Greece (and not totally without cause; while EDA was by no means Communist, the Communist Party supported EDA and several sympathizers were prominent EDA members). Papandreou, refusing to govern with Communist backing, tendered his resignation. In a move interpreted as favorable to Papandreou, King Paul immediately dissolved Parliament and called for a new general election. Papandreou, who had had time to implement a number of popular measures as Prime Minister before his resignation, won 53% of the popular vote and an absolute parliamentary majority in that election. It is claimed that, as repayment of such favorable treatment, Papandreou agreed to accept an increased role for the Crown in the running of the armed forces which, at the time, traditionally favored the Right, and were fiercely anti-Communist. Whether there was an express agreement or rather a tacit understanding is still disputed, but it is true that Papandreou chose figures who were unlikely to offend the Crown as his Ministers for Defense, and even chose the Crown's favorite, Lieutenant General Ioannis Gennimatas, for the key post of Chief of the Army General Staff. In his 1963 government, the Minister of Defense Minister of Defense was a retired general who had, in fact, also been the Minister of Defense in the previous (caretaker) government which supervised the election. In the government formed after the 1964 election, the Minister of Defense was Petros Garoufalias, a loyal friend of Papandreou (and one of his financial backers). Garoufalias was conservative and could be said to belong to the right-wing of the Center Union. Soon after Papandreou was sworn in again as Prime Minister, in early 1964, King Paul died and his 24-year-old son succeeded him as Constantine II. Initially, relationships between the King and his Prime Minister seemed cordial, but the horizon soon clouded over. By early 1965 Papandreou and the King had even stopped talking to each other: their last meeting, before the crisis, was in March 1965. A number of other factors played an important role in the genesis and the development of the crisis. The Center Union was a party hastily formed, in late 1961, by the fusion of various centrist factions, which had previously been bitterly bickering with each other. It spanned a broad segment of the political spectrum, managing to house, under the same roof, both Stefanos Stefanopoulos who, but for the sudden emergence of Karamanlis, would have been leader of ERE in 1955 and Prime Minister, and Ilias Tsirimokos, a former minister of the provisional government set up in the mountains of Greece by the Communist resistance in 1944. For this reason, Tsirimokos was commonly regarded, at least by the Right, as a Communist or, at least, a sympathizer. To complicate matters even further, Papandreou, 76 years of age in 1964, was expected soon to have to cede his place to a new leader, and many aspired to this position, most of all the powerful and considerably younger Finance Minister, Konstantinos Mitsotakis. Furthermore, Papandreou's son, Andreas, emerged from political obscurity in 1964 as a new leader of the party's left wing. =The ASPIDA scandal= ASPIDA is a backronym of \\"Officers Save Fatherland Ideals Democracy Meritocracy\\" (in Greek: ŒëŒæŒπœâŒºŒ±œÑŒπŒ∫ŒøŒØ Œ£œéœÉŒ±œÑŒµ Œ†Œ±œÑœÅŒØŒ¥Œ± ŒôŒ¥Œ±ŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ¨ ŒîŒ∑ŒºŒøŒ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒØŒ± ŒëŒæŒπŒøŒ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒØŒ±\\", which forms the Greek word for \\"shield\\"). It was essentially a group of relatively junior army officers (captains or majors) centered on Captain Aristidis Bouloukos. Generally speaking, they were antiRight centrists who also seemed to harbor little sympathy for Communists. The purpose of this secret organization was apparently on the one hand, to oppose actual or perceived right-wing domination of the Greek army, through the IDEA secret organization which was perceived as still being active; and to help its own members obtain favorable postings (hence the reference to \\"meritocracy\\" in the acronym ; there was a perception that choice postings and promotions went to sympathizers of the IDEA independent of merits). The alleged scandal, which had been revealed in 1965, would have had no serious implications in the political life of Greece, if it were not for the alleged membership in this group by Andreas Papandreou, the prime minister's son and a prominent figure of the center-left. This accusation was never accepted by Papandreou, who was later to become Prime Minister himself. Garoufalias decided to form a committee, which would examine the political implications of the ASPIDA scandal, including Andreas' involvement. Georgios Papandreou disapproved of this decision, while Andreas Papandreou reacted vehemently. This resulted in Petros Garoufalias submitting his resignation. =The resignation of Georgios Papandreou= After Petros Garoufalias resigned, Georgios Papandreos, spurred by his son's advice, decided to assume total control of the army, by succeeding Garoufalias as Defense Minister. The relations with the King were already bad after a letter the King had sent to the Prime Minister. In this letter, considered by some to be insulting, the King expressed his discontent because Papandreou refused to meet with him. Georgios Papandreou replied to the King in a bitter but careful and polite way. King Constantine, following his advisors' advice, refused to accept the Prime Minister's appointment as Defense Minister. Certain historians and journalists believe the court sought to control the military for a number of generations. The argument was that there was a conflict of interest, since the son of the Prime Minister was accused of involvement in an alleged scandal which the new Defense Minister, namely his father, would have to clear up. In turn, the King proposed the appointment of any person the Prime Minister would like, but not himself. Initially, Papandreou seemed willing to consider the King's proposal, but during their last and bitter meeting, the Prime Minister refused Constantine's proposal and threatened to resign, if he was not appointed Defense Minister. Constantine II refused Papandreou's demand and accepted his subsequent resignation. The political turmoil began from this point onwards, and arose from the fact that the King had already decided upon Papandreou's successor, Georgios Athanasiadis-Novas, who was waiting in an adjoining room during that meeting. The fact that Papandreou's successor was sworn in just a few moments after Papandreou's resignation caused a great amount of criticism, and created the impression that the King wanted to get rid of Papandreou all along. The July apostasy At this point, Papandreou appealed to public opinion with the slogan \\"the King reigns but the people rule\\", and called upon the people to support him. King Constantine thusly made several attempts to form new governments, but none of them lasted for long. He appointed Speaker of Parliament Georgios Athanasiadis-Novas as Prime Minister. Athanasiadis-Novas was followed by many dissidents from the Center Union (the infamous apostates, most prominent among whom was the future Prime Minister, Konstantinos Mitsotakis) and conservative ERE MPs, but not enough to gain a vote of confidence in parliament. He was replaced on August 20 of the same year by Ilias Tsirimokos with similar results. Failing to gain a vote of confidence, Tsirimokos was dismissed on September 17. Constantine II next induced some of Papandreou's dissidents, led by Stephanos Stephanopoulos, to form a government of \\"King's men\\", which lasted until December 22, 1966, amid mounting strikes and protests. When Stephanopoulos resigned in frustration, Constantine appointed an interim government under Ioannis Paraskevopoulos, which called elections for 28 May 1967. This government did not even last till the scheduled elections. It was replaced on April 3, 1967, by another interim government under Panagiotis Kanellopoulos, Kanellopoulos being the active leader of the National Radical Union and still supposed to organize a fair election. There were many indications that Papandreou's Center Union would not be able to form a working government by itself in the scheduled elections. There therefore existed a strong possibility that the Center Union would be forced into an alliance with the socialist EDA. This sense of a \\"Communist threat\\", along with putschist tendencies existent in some right-wing nationalist fractions of the Hellenic Armed Forces, eventually led to the coup d'√©tat of April 21, 1967, which established a military dictatorship, better known as the \\"Regime of the Colonels\\".

Renfroe. (Photo courtesy UIC College of Dentistry.) Allan Gibson Brodie (October 31, 1897, in New York City ‚Äì January 2, 1976) was an American dentist and orthodonist. An orthodontics teacher, writer, and researcher, Brodie served in a variety of professional positions, such as President of the Chicago Association of Orthodontics, served on advisory boards, achieved a number of professional awards, and was a member of the American Association of Orthodontists (AAO), where he established the Prize Essay Award to promote research. Education After earning his DDS (Doctor of Dental Surgery) degree from the University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine in 1919, he began practicing dentistry in Newark, NJ, the next year. Brodie studied under Edward Angle, the \\"father of orthodontics,\\" at the Angle School of Orthodontia in Pasadena, California, in 1925 and 1926, and matriculated in the school's final graduating class. Brodie, in turn, often referred to the Angles as his foster parents. In 1923, he married Vera Elizabeth Smock. They had three children. Professional life Brodie returned to practice in Newark, but in 1929 he was invited by Dean Frederick Bogue Noyes came to the University of Illinois College of Dentistry to organize its Department of Orthodontics‚Äîone of the first graduate orthodontics departments established in the United States. The Journal of the Charles H. Tweed International Foundation called Noyes' hiring of Brodie the beginning of \\"the golden age of orthodontics,\\" and considered the department under Brodie \\"the West Point of orthodontics.\\" The Journal also noted that the establishment of the Department of Orthodontics at the University of Illinois College of Dentistry \\"marked the fulfillment of Dr. Edward Angle lifelong ambition‚Äîto provide a broader and more scientific foundation for the practitioners of his specialty.\\" Brodie ran the department until 1966, and was Dean of the College from 1944 to 1956, while also maintaining a private practice. Brodie received his MS (Master of Science) degree in anatomy and histology from the University in 1934, and his PhD in anatomy in 1940. At the time of his death on January 2, 1976, Brodie was writing his own book on orthodontics.

It is unclear just how the fire started, but it was fueled by hot temperatures and strong winds which propelled the fire. The fire, which burned for nearly 10 hours, destroyed and 1,900 structures displacing over 10,000 people. Damages were estimated at $5 million, ($ million in ). The Day of the Fire It was a clear, warm and sunny day with a brisk breeze from the south. This was not the only fire of the day, but the fourth call in the span of an hour: a small fire at the Candler Warehouse at 11:39 AM and at 11:43 a fire seven blocks north that destroyed three houses; and at 12:15, south of the Georgia Railroad from the big fire, ten homes were destroyed before being extinguished. At 12:46 a call came from a small warehouse just north of Decatur Street between Fort and Hilliard, and the crew sent to inspect it found a stack of burning mattresses, but had no firefighting equipment with them. If the fire department had not been spread across so many different parts of the city already, the fire would have been put out there; but by the time reinforcements arrived, it was quickly leaping north. The Great Fire The fire in the 4th Ward The fire spread quickly up to Edgewood Avenue and from there throughout the main residential areas of Sweet Auburn, sparing little. The area between Decatur and Edgewood was crammed with shanties and lean-tos, which provided fuel for the fire to grow very strong and move fast through the area. A corridor was burned due north between Jackson (now Parkway and Charles Allen) and Boulevard, with a few prominent bulges at Highland and just south of Ponce de Leon Avenue. At Houston Street, the fire was still being stopped on the east by Boulevard (just sparing John Wesley Dobbs' block). When the fire reached Highland, it raced both east and west through many fine homes. Around 4:00 in the afternoon, fire-fighters had begun to stall the fire by using dynamite to destroy many homes along Pine, Boulevard and finally Ponce de Leon. By nightfall the fire crossed Ponce de Leon. While reduced, it headed north through the recently built-out neighborhood along St. Charles, Vedado Way and Greenwood Avenue. It finally stopped at 10 PM, more than north of where it began. In eleven hours, of water were pumped to put out the fire. Additional fire trucks had been sent from nine Georgia towns (as far away as Macon and Augusta), as well as from Chattanooga and Knoxville in Tennessee. 1,938 buildings were destroyed over spanning 73 city blocks. Fires smoldered for the rest of the week. Aftermath View of area destroyed by the fire Since more than 85% of the destroyed buildings had wood shingles, the city quickly passed an ordinance banning them for new construction. By 1931 all older buildings had replaced the wood shingles. In the history of the city, only Sherman's fire of 1864 did more extensive damage. Rebuilding was sporadic, with large swaths kept open for years. Commercial strips were quickly built on the destroyed portions of Edgewood and Auburn where busy streetcar routes ran: 17 and 3 respectively. Where large estates with spacious front yards had been, along the entire stretch of Boulevard up to Ponce, dozens of two- and three- storey apartment buildings that hugged the sidewalk were built. Large open spaces were left at what is now the King Memorial and at Bedford-Pine Park, now named Central Park (host of Music Midtown in the 2000s). Low-income housing developments were built in the destroyed extreme southern section and the areas south of North Avenue. Some around Boulevard and Highland were eventually developed as the campus for Atlanta Medical Center. Except for where single family homes were quickly rebuilt north of Ponce de Leon, the character of this large area of Atlanta was changed forever. The next U.S. fire of more significance wouldn't occur for more than 70 years: The Oakland Hills firestorm of 1991.

Released after a five-year hiatus, the album saw the band drop their former gothic, alternative rock sound in favour of a hi-tech electronic, ambient direction, taking influences from ambient techno artists such as The Orb and Orbital, while retaining the band's psychedelic focus. The group were first intrigued in making electronic music at the start of the decade. The songs on are longer than those on Love and Rocket's previous albums, encompassing a broader tonal range. Natacha Atlas, who drummer Kevin Haskins worked with during the band's hiatus, performs additional vocals and percussion the record, lending it a world music influence. Promoted by the singles \\"Body and Soul\\" and \\"This Heaven\\", Hot Trip to Heaven was released to indifference from fans, alienating much of their core college rock audience, and was a commercial failure. However, the album received generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised the band's radical new direction, with some calling the album sensual and among the band's greatest work to date. Lead singer Daniel Ash remains proud of the album.  Background and recording  Artists such as The Orb (pictured) helped inspire the band's change in sound on Hot Trip to Heaven. After the commercial success of alternative rock band Love and Rockets' self-titled fourth album from 1989, which produced the hit single \\"So Alive\\", which reached number 3 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart the same year, the band took a hiatus in the early 1990s, during which the band worked on solo material and on other projects, including the band's drummer Kevin Haskins producing material by Egyptian-Belgian singer Natacha Atlas of Trans-Global Underground. The band became intrigued in recording dance-oriented music around 1989‚Äì1990, as the band listened to the music of Happy Mondays, Spiritualized and The Orb. Furthermore, Haskins had been using drum machines for some time, whereas vocalist Daniel Ash used a $35 drum machine when recording as Tones on Tail in the early 1980s. Ash later recalled that it was primarily listening to the Orb, Orbital and Leftfield that sparked the band's interest in making electronic music: \\"I started to hear that stuff in the '90s. It completely seduced Love and Rockets. We completely fell in with that attitude toward music. That's why we made Hot Trip to Heaven.\\" After the band's break, the band began working on Hot Trip to Heaven around 1993, deliberately starting work on the album without any guitars \\"so that it would be something new and novel for us.\\" This was a departure from the band's 1980s work, where the band started songs and them worked on them using guitar, bass and drums. The band self-produced Hot Trip to Heaven, while working with engineer Kevin White. While the band remained signed to Beggars Banquet in their native United Kingdom, they were dropped by the label in the United States for failing to follow-up on hit single \\"So Alive\\", and signed to Rick Rubin's label American Recordings for the release of the album.  Music  Natacha Atlas contributed additional vocals and percussion to the album. Hot Trip to Heaven is a diverse and experimental album, radically replacing the alternative rock sound of their previous work with electronic and dance influences, including from genres such as ambient, techno, ambient techno, trip hop, and house, and incorporating elements from Britain's house and ambient dance scenes. Hot Press described the album as a highly unique hybrid of trance, ambient, techno, world and industrial music. Billboard felt the album saw the band reinventing themselves \\"as moody, ambient groovemeisters.\\" The songs on the album are longer and possess a broader tonal range in comparison to the band's previous records. Ash's guitar work on the album has been compared to Robert Fripp and Phil Manzanera, though critic Fay Wolftree felt the shaping of his guitar sound \\"owes more to Brian Eno and his bank of analogue synths than any player of stringed instruments.\\" David J's bass playing largely leans towards dub, while also running with Haskins' drumming \\"to maintain an insistent sense of threat or promise.\\" Natacha Atlas, who had worked with earlier in the 1990s, also contributes additional vocals and percussion to the album, which Wolftree feel largely contribute to the album's \\"world and ethnic feel,\\" feeling Atlas' sporadic singing and warm percussion contrast well with Ash's voice. =Songs= The hypnotic 14-minute long \\"Body and Soul\\", inspired particularly by The Orb, opens the album, signalling the band's new direction with whispered vocals and \\"pulsing cycles of electrotones,\\" before reaching a lengthy, chiming main phase \\"of repetitive psychedelic melodies\\" that pay homage to Eno and the Beatles, two of the band's biggest influences. Journalist Frank Tortorici described the song as \\"electronica meets the Beatles.\\" Wolftree called the song \\"insistently trancey\\" with a conspicuous rhythm section. \\"Ugly\\", one of the songs to feature Atlas' Middle Eastern-inflicted vocals, features a \\"mysterious,\\" chugging dance beat, whereas \\"Trip and Glide\\" combines Atlas' wordless vocals with \\"Bolan-meets-Seal atmospherics.\\" \\"This Heaven\\" flirts with an alternative house style reminiscent of Stereo MC's with its usage of a distorted rap and arousing samples, while its thrust beat and \\"breathy female panting and cooing\\" led Wolftree to describe it as \\"the nineties answer to Donna Summer's awesome dancefloor hit 'I Feel Love', as the more enlightened club DJs in London have already realised.\\" She described the song's style as \\"sex trance dub or hardbeat world trance.\\" \\"No Worries\\" features sitar sounds, while \\"Voodoo Baby\\" features tingling keys and a brooding bassline. \\"Be the Revolution\\" features wiry and wry vocals from David J and a guitar loop from Louis Metoyer. The title track, which appears halfway through the album, is the first track where Ash uses his signature fuzz bass guitar. Wolfree said of the song: \\"More than a little reminiscent of Bolan in Twentieth Century Boy mode plus a twinge of Jim Foetus, it‚Äôs still a fuck-off hard dance track.\\"  Release and reception  The band's first album in five years, Hot Trip to Heaven was released on 26 September 1994 by Beggars Banquet in the UK American Recordings in the US. One writer noted the album's scheduled release date coincided with that of the Cult's self-titled album, also that band's comeback album. \\"Body and Soul\\" and \\"This Heaven\\" were released as singles, though failed to chart. Similarly, while the album did make the CMJ Top 75 Alternative Radio Play chart, reaching number 49 in January 1995, the album ultimately failed to chart highly on any alternative chart, or at all on the pop charts. Many fans of the band were disillusioned by the album. Ash recalled the album was \\"commercial suicide because we were sort of known as a guitar band. I heard stories of, especially in the U.S., of people taking the CD back and saying, 'This isn't Love and Rockets. I want my money back'.\\" It was also reported that fans of ambient and techno music felt the album's \\"spacious dance tracks\\" were compromised by the inclusion of vocals. However, the album was released to generally positive reviews. Fay Wolftree of Hot Press said Hot Trip to Heaven was \\"their most mature and cohesive work to date\\" and \\"the sex album of the year,\\" citing the album's \\"sheer throbbing sensuality,\\" and concluding: \\"Put simply, if Hot Trip To Heaven doesn‚Äôt make your body want to dance or make love (or both) you‚Äôre dead.\\" Greg Fasolino and Ira Robbins of Trouser Press wrote: \\"Beyond the simple surprise of resurrection, Love and Rockets' Hot Trip to Heaven is a radical rethink.\\" They said the album was an unusual case of a band creating \\"something vital and new after such an extended hibernation,\\" and praised the band's \\"penchant for diversity [working] hand in hand with the band's fresh, creative ideas.\\" New York Magazine called the album \\"hypnotic, glistening, dark and crashing‚Äìeverything you'd expect from the musician side of goth rock progenitors, Bauhaus [Love and Rockets' previous band.]\\" AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine was less receptive, saying \\"they sound like they're trying to figure out what the hell is going on,\\" though colleague Bill Cassel wrote that the album, \\"though flawed, boasted strong songwriting and an intriguing mix of electronics and old-fashioned instruments.\\" =Legacy and aftermath= Hot Trip to Heaven has been hailed in retrospect by some critics in ways it had not been upon its release. Chris Molanphy of CMJ New Music Monthly wrote in 1998 that the album reimagined the band \\"as an electronica collective before that term had been coined.\\" Meanwhile, Westword called it one of Ash's \\"best and most interesting albums,\\" later noting in 2013 that \\"Love and Rockets all but committed career suicide with its daring, largely synth-driven 1994 album Hot Trip to Heaven, but like OMD's Dazzle Ships, the project is coming to be seen as a masterpiece ahead of its time.\\" Sandy Masuo of the Los Angeles Times wrote that with Hot Trip to Heaven, \\"the group demonstrated that the suave, gritty pop it's cultivated is as effective stretched across wide, ambient spaces as it is compressed into more concise, rock-related forms.\\" In 2002, critic Dave Thompson praised Hot Trip To Heaven, saying it \\"should have been Love And Rockets' biggest album yet.\\" Ash reflected on Hot Trip in Heaven in 2013, saying \\"as a band we needed to do that to keep it fresh for us. But, you know, I was hoping it was going to be our Dark Side of the Moon. It was either going to be that, or it was going to be a flop. Unfortunately it was a flop. But I'm still proud of the record.\\" American Recordings persuaded Love and Rockets to return to a more guitar-based alternative rock sound on their next album, 1996's Sweet F.A., which helped retrieve some of the band's earlier fans who felt puzzled by Hot Trip to Heaven, before further exploring electronic music on their swan song, 1998's Lift, where the band had \\" to tinker and experiment\\" after creating their own label.

The NSHL survived for 8 seasons. After their 7th season, they tried to expand to increase the competition in the small league, but the expansion was blocked by the NOHA. The league threatened to take the issue to the Ontario Hockey Federation, but nothing came of it. The victors of the league's playoffs earned the right to compete against the Hockey Northwestern Ontario's Thunder Bay Junior B Hockey League in the Northwestern Ontario Regionals. The winner of that series used to earn the right to compete for the Keystone Cup, the Western Canadian championship. In 2004, the NSHL took a leave of absence from the NOHA. The Wawa Travellers were the only healthy team that still wanted to compete in the NSHL. The Marathon Renegades left the league for a season to attempt to find better ways of drawing players and came back in 2005 to find there was nothing left. The Thessalon Flyers were officially defunct as their owner was thrown out of Hockey Canada for shady business practices. The last team, the Aguasabon River Rats left the league because they did not want to compete in such a small league, they left for the rival TBJBHL with an all-star contingent of NSHL players, lost their 2005 league final and never came back. With the Wawa Travellers being the only team registered to the league in 2004-05 and for the 2005-06 season, the league official closed its doors in early 2005. In the aftermath of the dispersal of the league in 2004, the Aguasabon River Rats took a shot at covering the distance to play in the Thunder Bay Junior \\"B\\" league.

A heavier, more rugged development of the earlier Lanchester 4x2 armoured car, it remained in service with Territorial and colonial units until the early 1940s and saw action in the Battle of Malaya. Production history and description In 1927, the Lanchester Motor Company was awarded a contract for a six-wheeled armoured car. By March 1928 two prototypes, D1E1 and D1E2 (the latter equipped with rear doors for a swift exit) were built with different armament and turret shapes, D1E2 also having an additional rear driving position. Following the trials it was realised the existing chassis was insufficiently strong or rigid for such a heavy vehicle driven cross-country. In July 1928 Twenty-two Mk1 production vehicles with an improved chassis and other detail changes were ordered, eighteen with one .5 and one .303 (7.7 mm) Vickers machine guns dual-mounted in the turret and one in the hull position to the left of the driver, and four 'A' command variants in which communications gear replaced the hull-mounted .303 Vickers and the gunner's position was occupied by a wireless operator. In both versions the turret featured an independently rotating cupola. In October 1929 eight more vehicles were ordered: three MkII and three MIIA command variants, and two more instructional vehicles, D1E3 and D1E4. The developed Lanchester, while having a 6x4 drive train (six wheels, four driven) was fitted with an armoured body similar in shape to that of the Rolls-Royce Armoured Car rather than the sloped engine compartment of the earlier model which could deflect glancing shots into the car.In photographs of both types it is clear the six-wheel version features a horizontally aligned engine. In some, angle-section ribs intended to deflect skimming shots away from the fighting compartment can be clearly seen. In both marks and all versions the Lanchesters featured the same basic functional arrangement: a frontal engine compartment; a main fighting compartment mounting a fully traversing turret; and rear equipment stowage; a two-man turret mounting one .5 inch (12.7 mm) and one .303 inch (7.7 mm) Vickers machine guns co-axially; and fitted with a cupola that could be independently rotated, greatly aiding observation while hatches were closed. Lanchesters had good cross-country performance (particularly in the new 6X4 form), they were considered reliable and easy to maintain but proved too big, too top-heavy and too slow for the reconnaissance missions for which they were originally conceived. When alternative reconnaissance vehicles became available, notably the Morris Light Reconnaissance Car (MLR), Lanchesters were assigned to the colonial policing role, one in which they served until the outbreak of World War Two. Deployment history Lanchester of the 12th Lancers during manoeuvres In January 1929 the first Lanchesters (and Rolls- Royce armoured cars transferred from Navy and Air force stocks) were received by the 11th Hussars regiment as part of its mechanization from horse-mounted cavalry. Because of slow rate of delivery, it took until 1934 to fully equip the unit. In November the regiment was relocated to Egypt to relieve the 12th Royal Lancers, which returned to Britain and took over the cars. In January‚ÄìFebruary 1935 a provisional D squadron of the 12th Lancers with eight armoured cars served as a peacekeeping force in the Saar region. On 31 December B and C squadrons were sent again to Egypt with 29 armoured cars as a response to the Italian invasion of Abyssinia and strengthening garrisons in Libya. They were used in patrolling the western frontier. By the end of 1936 the squadrons were returned to Britain, where the regiment was re-equipped with Morris Light Reconnaissance Cars. By 1939, most Lanchesters (13 Mk I; 1 Mk IA; 5 Mk II; and 3 Mk IIA) were sent to the Far East and assigned to the Selangor and Perak battalions of Federated Malay States Volunteer Force, the Singapore Volunteer Corps, Straits Settlements Volunteer Force and the 2nd battalion of Argyll & Sutherland Highlanders in Malay, some of which took part in the Malayan Campaign (December 1941 - 15 February 1942) against Japan. 10 Lanchesters were given to the Territorial Army (23rd London Armoured Car Company and 1st Derbyshire Yeomanry) and in 1940 one was converted to provide protected transportation for use by Cabinet ministers and other VIPs. In 1941 two were given to the 1st Belgian armoured car squadron. The only surviving vehicle is a Mk II on display at the Bovington Tank Museum.

It designs, produces and sells guitar tuners, bridges, tremolos, strap locks and other accessories primarily for guitars. Schaller was founded in Feucht near Nuremberg in 1945 by Helmut Schaller as a radio repair shop. Since then, Schaller has developed into one of the foremost regarded suppliers for the music instrument industry. Dr. Lars B√ºnning has been the company's owner since 2009. History First Advertisement of Schaller for Pickups The Schaller company was founded in 1945 by Helmut Schaller (1923 ‚Äì 1999). Helmut Schaller was a toolmaker and a radio master mechanic. His radio repair shop prospered in the 1950s. During that time another department was created, dedicated to the development of amplifiers and speakers, which turned out to be so successful that the entire company was restructured and renamed to \\"Schaller Electronic\\". Echos and reverb devices were soon added to the portfolio. By 1953, Schaller had begun manufacturing electronic guitar components such as pickups and switches for Fred Wilfer's guitar company Framus in Bubenreuth, Bavaria. A couple of years later, other German guitar manufacturers such as H√∂fner, Hopf and Hoyer also became customers. By the 1960s American guitar makers including Fender, Gibson, C. F. Martin and Ovation started to rely on Schaller products for their guitars and basses. Schaller M6 Machine Head At the same time Schaller extended its portfolio to tremolos (1961), bridges (1962) and machine heads (1966). The \\"M6\\" tuning machine made a mark as the world's first fully enclosed and self-locking precision tuner. In 1968 Schaller moved about 15 kilometres from Feucht to Postbauer-Heng into a new site. A new production facility was set up in order to meet the rising demand for Schaller products. The product portfolio was constantly expanded in the 1970s. The \\"M4\\" bass tuners, various bridges including the \\"TOM\\" bridges for Gibson guitars and numerous other variants of pickups (\\"Golden 50\\", \\"S6\\", \\"T6\\" etc.) were added. In addition, Schaller was coming up with many product designs on its own. Renowned guitar makers therefore came in touch with Schaller and were convinced to equip their guitars with components by Schaller. In 1977, Floyd D. Rose uttered the idea of a double-locking tremolo system. After a joint workshop (that lasted for about three months) Schaller was able to develop this novel tremolo. The first prototype was produced soon after. Due to the lack of demand, at the beginning of the 1980s the production of loudspeakers, amplifiers and reverberators was ceased. The core business shifted to metal components for guitars. In 1981 a new product was designed and patented in this respect: the security lock,German Patent Office: \\"Offenlegungsschrift\\", dated 11th May 1989; Nr.: DE 29 33 845 C2 a part which helps provide a secure connection between guitar and strap. It has been Schaller's most-sold product since then. The product portfolio steadily expanded during the 1980s and 1990s. This came to a stop after both Helmut Schaller and his son Ren√© Schaller died (in 1999 resp. in 1998). Until the late 1990s violin accessories were added to the portfolio as well as cables, and even special spinning machines for strings and ballends, however the newly introduced products did not achieve the same success as the earlier guitar components.Schaller's official catalogue, dated 2005, still contains violin accessories and cables. A vital period for the company were the years 1999 till 2006 since a community of heirs ran the company then. Grete Schaller (1926 ‚Äì 2007), Helmut Schaller's widow, tried to lead the company without being able to generate new impetus, without providing ideas for new products and without modernising the production facility at Postbauer-Heng. This led to the company stagnating.Schaller's official product catalogue, dated 2005, p. 67: \\"Helmut Schaller's Vision\\" New Schaller In August 2006, a breakthrough was achieved, when the Schaller company was legally and financially restructured. It was renamed to a limited liability company (\\"GmbH\\") by a partnership. Subsequently, Dr. Lars B√ºnning became managing director of the company by December 2006. In January 2009, Dr. B√ºnning took over the shares of the GmbH belonging to the Schaller family, and has since then acted as both owner and CEO. Further restructuring occurred after 2007.

Males reach only 3.5, females 4.5 centimetres. The upper side of the body is variable in colour, usually with irregular green patches on a light brown, grey or light olive background. The frog's back is dotted with elongated warts, often in undulating longitudinal rows that can be orange along the flanks. Behind the protruding eyes and above the tympanum, there is short, small gland. It does not have parotid glands. The underside is white, and around the pelvis yellowy orange. In the mating season, males develop dark swellings on the insides of their digits and forelimbs, as well as on the chest. The males' forelimbs are stronger than females'.  Reproduction  In France, the breeding season lasts from the end of February to early April; in Portugal, it is from November to March. In Andalusia, this parsley frog may spawn several times a year. For laying places, it prefers weedy ponds and sometimes streams. The males create a relatively quiet croaking noise with the help of their paired inner vocal sacs, under water. The females may respond with a \\"kee, kee\\" vocalisation, similar to those of the little bustard and corn crake. During mating, the male grabs the female around the waist with its front limbs, not under the arms, as the Neobatrachia do (also see amplexus). For laying the eggs, the amplexed couple will seek a vertical twig or reed in the water, on which the female attaches an egg mass only a few centimetres long, containing 40 to 300 eggs. These are dark grey to black on top and covered in jelly. The tadpoles need approximately three months until metamorphosis if no hibernation intervenes. Previous to this, they can reach a considerable 6.5 centimetres (9.5 cm) - longer than the adult animal!  Distribution  Common parsley frogs are found in open or semi-open, even arid landscapes, that are typically characterised by the occurrence of pine and holm oak stands. They seem to furthermore prefer calcareous soils. In the North of its distribution, this parsley frog hibernates from November to February/March, but does not hibernate in the South. The distribution ranges from Spain up to the North of France, including France, Spain, Portugal and a small part of Northwestern Italy (Piemont and Liguria). In altitude, these frogs reach from sea level to middle mountainous regions. The distribution in France is the most continuous; here, only the Eastern edge and parts of the South West are not colonised. In the South of the Iberian peninsula, the Iberian parsley frog (P. ibericus S√°nchez-Herra√≠z, Barbadillo-Escriv√°, Machordom & Sanch√≠z, 2000) has come to be regarded as a separate species in recent years. The third Pelodytes species, the Caucasian parsley frog (P. caucasicus Boulenger, 1896), is spatially set apart with its distribution in the Caucasus and Turkey. This may be an example of allopatric speciation in ice age refugia.  Ecology and behaviour  During the day, the animals rest under stones or in burrows that they dig. They can also climb reasonably well. They hunt insects at night, and are predated by barn owls, amongst others.

The work done by teaching fellows can vary enormously from institution to institution, depending on the requirements and position of individual institutions. United Kingdom and Ireland In the UK and Ireland, teaching fellows are typically full members of academic staff who are involved in teaching. Teaching fellows can undertake the full range of teaching, pastoral and administrative duties, and can also be involved in research activity, specifically pedagogic research. Their responsibilities can include developing innovative learning materials, mentoring colleagues and contributing to staff development activities, shaping the faculty's and the university's agenda in learning and teaching and spreading good practice in learning, teaching and assessment. Other UK institutions may use the title of teaching fellow as an additional accolade, awarded to a member of academic staff who has shown excellence in teaching. Teaching fellows may have the same rank and pay as 'traditional' research-active academic staff, although this depends on the attitude of the individual department and the institution. The equivalence in rank and status is relatively new in some institutions, since teaching fellows in the past were sometimes paid at a grade lower than their research-active colleagues. Teaching fellows are present at a number of institutions across the UK. Institutions such as UCL as well as The Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen and the universities of Aberdeen, Stirling, Bristol, Manchester and Newcastle all employ academics known as teaching fellows. Thus, a senior teaching fellow may have the same salary, status and teaching responsibilities as a senior lecturer. Teaching fellows in institutions such as the University of Aberdeen may also potentially reach the rank of professor. The University of Reading runs a University Teaching Fellowship scheme that was launched in 2007/8. The scheme is open to academic and support staff across the university and it has awarded so far 21 University and 11 Early Career Teaching Fellowships since it was launched. The criteria for the scheme is consistent with the Higher Education Academy's National Teaching Fellowship Scheme (NTFS). =National Teaching Fellowship Scheme= The National Teaching Fellowship Scheme recognises and rewards individual excellence in teaching in higher education in the UK and supports individuals' professional development in learning and teaching. The National Teaching Fellows (NTFs) are an active community, currently consisting of 643 NTFs from more than 40 disciplines. The Association of National Teaching Fellows (ANTF) promotes innovation and supports the sharing of best practice. National Teaching Fellows automatically become a member of the ANTF. The Committee of the Association of the National Teaching Fellows (CANTF) organises the ANTF's work and is the official voice of the association. United States In the U.S. a teaching fellow is an advanced graduate student who serves as the primary instructor for an undergraduate course. Known as teaching fellows at many private universities, such as Harvard University, Boston College, and Boston University, they are also referred to as 'graduate student instructors' (GSIs) at some other universities, such as the University of Michigan and the University of California system. Typically, TFs teach courses in their area of research specialty, in which they hold a master's degree or equivalent. Teaching fellows differ from teaching assistants in that they are responsible for all aspects of the course, including lecture, whereas TAs assist the instructor by performing ancillary course-related tasks such as grading and holding discussion section or laboratory. Many (about two-thirds) of the graduate students who have served as TAs serve as a TF for one or more classes each semester. Although TFs are fairly autonomous in their duties, many universities, such as the University of Pittsburgh, require supervision of TFs by professors experienced in teaching the course content, with whom TFs must hold regular meetings and receive feedback about the quality of their teaching. As a general rule, TFs receive a higher stipend than TAs in accordance with the greater responsibility and time commitment of a teaching fellowship, but like TAs, their contracts are renewed on a semester-by-semester basis, and they cannot be granted tenure. Many state universities, such as Florida State University and the University of Florida, do not use the title \\"teaching fellow\\", and \\"teaching assistants\\" are the sole instructors of many classes. They are not required to have a master's degree, and do not usually teach in their area of research specialization, but rather introductory courses in such fields as English Composition (writing) and foreign languages, in which class size must be limited, large lectures are impractical, and multiple \\"sections\\" of the same course run simultaneously. Usually a full-time instructor or professor supervises all the sections of a given course, though the extent of supervision and coordination can vary significantly from one school or one course to another. =Teaching associate= A teaching associate is an academically qualified and registered graduate student, usually in full-time residence, employed temporarily to teach freshman- and sophomore-level courses (or occasionally more advanced undergraduate courses) in an American university. They are an advanced form of graduate teaching assistant, normally doctoral students, and are paid better than teaching assistants. India To tackle faculty shortage in the university departments, Anna University recruits postgraduates on contract basis and allow them to complete their doctoral degrees on the job. Candidates are shortlisted through a written test and an interview. Candidates are given the opportunity to pursue their PhD in the university departments simultaneously as they teach. Technically they are employed only for six months, but contracts get renewed through the years, they do almost the same job as regular staff, but receive what has been described as an \\"abysmally low\\" salary.

Its status is somewhat similar to that of the Italo-Celtic grouping: each is widely considered plausible without being accepted as established communis opinio. The hypothetical Proto-Graeco-Armenian stage would need to date to the 3rd millennium BC and would be only barely different from either late Proto-Indo- European or Graeco-Armeno-Aryan. History The Graeco-Armenian hypothesis originated in 1924 with Holger Pedersen, who noted that agreements between Armenian and Greek lexical cognates are more common than between Armenian and any other Indo-European language.. During the mid-to-late 1920s, Antoine Meillet further investigated morphological and phonological agreements and postulated that the parent languages of Greek and Armenian were dialects in immediate geographical proximity to their parent language, Proto-Indo- European.; . Meillet's hypothesis became popular in the wake of his Esquisse d'une grammaire compar√©e de l'arm√©nien classique.. G. R. Solta does not go as far as postulating a Proto-Graeco-Armenian stage but concludes that the lexicon and the morphology clearly make Greek the language that is the most closely related to Armenian.. Eric Hamp supports the Graeco-Armenian thesis and even anticipates a time that \\"we should speak of Helleno-Armenian\\" (the postulate of a Graeco-Armenian proto-language).. James Clackson is more reserved, considers the evidence of a Graeco-Armenian subgroup to be inconclusive and believes Armenian to be in a larger Graeco-Armeno-Aryan family.. Evaluation of the hypothesis is tied up with the analysis of Indo- European languages, such as Phrygian and languages within the Anatolian subgroup (such as Hittite), many of which are poorly attested, but which were geographically located between the Greek and Armenian-speaking areas, and which would therefore be expected to have traits intermediate between the two. While Greek is attested from very early times, allowing a secure reconstruction of a Proto-Greek language dating to about the 3rd millennium BC,. the history of Armenian is opaque where its earliest testimony is the 5th-century Bible translation of Mesrob Mashtots. Armenian has many loanwords showing traces of long language contact with Greek and Indo-Iranian languages; in particular, it is a satem language. Also, although Armenian and Attic (Ancient) Greek share a voiceless aspirate series, they originate from different PIE series (in Armenian from voiceless consonants and in Greek from the voiced aspirates).. In a 2005 publication, a group of linguists and statisticians, comprising Luay Nakhleh, Tandy Warnow, Donald Ringe and Steven N. Evans, compared quantitative phylogenetic linguistic methods and found that a Graeco-Armenian subgroup was supported by that five procedures ‚Äì maximum parsimony, weighted versus unweighted maximum compatibility, neighbor-joining, and the widely-criticized binary lexical coding technique (devised by Russell Gray and Quentin D. Atkinson).; . An interrelated problem is whether there is a \\"Balkan Indo-European\\" subgroup of Indo-European, which would consist not only of Greek and Armenian but also Albanian and possibly dead languages, such as Ancient Macedonian and Phrygian. This has been argued for in research by scholars such as G. Neumann, G. Klingenschmitt, J. Matzinger, J. H. Holst. The Balkan subgroup, in turn, is supported by the lexico-statistical method of Hans J. Holm..

Vobster The parish includes the village of Vobster, which had a coal mine of the same name on the Somerset coalfield and a quarry, both of which are now disused. The old quarry is now used as a diving centre. The Church of St Edmund, at Vobster by Benjamin Ferrey, dates from 1846 and is a Grade II listed building. Vobster Inn Bridge, which carries the lane over the Mells River, is dated 1764, and is Grade II listed. History and description In the Domesday Book of 1086 the village was known as \\"Mulne\\" meaning several mills. The parish was part of the hundred of Frome. Around 1500 Mells seems to have been known as Iron Burgh, as a result of the iron ore extracted in the area. The village hall was built in the 14th century as a tithe barn for Glastonbury Abbey and now serves as the village hall. During the 19th and early 20th centuries Mells and surrounding villages had several coal mines on the Somerset coalfield, much of which may have supplied the iron works of James Fussell. The Old Ironstone Works is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest due to the population of Greater and Lesser Horseshoe bats. The site is a ruined iron works, which mainly produced agricultural edge-tools which were exported all over the world, and is now, in addition to its unique and major importance in relation to industrial archaeology. The block of buildings adjacent to the entrance is listed Grade II* and most of the rest of the site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. It is included in the Heritage at Risk Register produced by English Heritage. Mells War Memorial is a grade II* listed building. It was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and is one of several structures in the village by the same architect. The memorial was unveiled in 1921 by Brigadier-General Arthur Asquith, whose brother‚Äîkilled in action in the First World War‚Äîis listed on the memorial. The Asquith family have a long association with the village. The nearby former railway is now the route of NCR 24, the Colliers Way. Mells Road railway station opened in 1875 and closed in 1959. Close to the church is the Grade I listed 16th-century Manor House, formerly in the Horner family and now the residence of Raymond Asquith, 3rd Earl of Oxford and Asquith. The other large house, Mells Park, was largely rebuilt by Lutyens in 1923; Pevsner calls attention to its ashlar masonry, Doric pilasters and hipped roof. The Talbot Inn, a former coaching inn, dates from the 15th century and is Grade II* listed. It was voted Sunday Times Hotel of the Year in 2013. The stone village lock-up was built in the 17th century. The Mells Post Office and Shop was refurbished and reopened in 2009 as a community social enterprise, following the retirement of the postmaster the previous year. The attached Mells Caf√© was opened in 2011 by The Great British Bake Off star Mary Berry. The Walled Garden, part of a former monastery, is now a cafe, shop and plant nursery. Mells Church of England First School, on the edge of the village green, was established in the mid-nineteenth century. It serves Mells and nearby villages and had 71 children on the roll in 2016. Mells Nursery School provides full day care for children from two years old to school age in a dedicated building which has been constructed adjacent to the school. Mells holds on Easter Mondays a popular and traditional event called Mells Daffodil Festival. Mells Manor was purportedly procured by Jack Horner upon discovering the deed in a pie given to him to carry to London by Richard Whiting, the last Abbot of Glastonbury. This act is referenced in the popular nursery rhyme \\"Little Jack Horner\\". An alternative explanation is that the manor was bought in 1543. After successive generations Thomas Strangways Horner moved out of the manor house in the village and commissioned Nathaniel Ireson to build Park House within Mells Park. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Frome Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. The village is part of the 'Ammerdown' electoral ward. The ward stretches north to Hemington also visiting Kilmersdon. The ward has a total population at the 2011 census of 2,371. It is also part of the Somerton and Frome county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Religious sites The village's most notable feature is St Andrew's Church, a Grade I listed building praised by Pevsner and predominantly from the late 15th century. The tower, which reaches , dates from the mid 16th century. The centre of the chapel is dominated by an equestrian statue of Edward Horner (who fell at the Battle of Cambrai in 1917) by Sir Alfred Munnings. A number of benches are Jacobean. There is a large piece of embroidery in the pre-Raphaelite manner, made by the Mrs Horner who was a friend of Burne-Jones. There is also a memorial, designed by Edwin Lutyens, to Raymond Asquith, who died in France in 1916. The churchyard is the last resting place of the poet Siegfried Sassoon and the Roman Catholic priest and writer Ronald Knox. There is a small Roman Catholic chapel in the grounds of the Manor House.

IEEE 802.11y is only being allowed as a licensed band. It was approved for publication by the IEEE on September 26, 2008. Background In June 2007 the a \\"light licensing\\" scheme was introduced in 3650‚Äì3700 MHz band. Licensees pay a small fee for a nationwide, non-exclusive license. They then pay an additional nominal fee for each high powered base station that they deploy. Neither the client devices (which may be fixed or mobile), nor their operators require a license, but these devices must receive an enabling signal from a licensed base station before transmitting. All stations must be identifiable in the event they cause interference to incumbent operators in the band. Further, there is a requirement that multiple licensees' devices are given the opportunity to transmit in the same area using a \\"contention based protocol\\" when possible. If interference between licensees, or the devices that they have enabled, cannot be mediated by technical means, licensees are required to resolve the dispute between themselves. Features The 3650 MHz rules allow for registered stations to operate at much higher power than traditional Wi-Fi gear (Up to 20 watts equivalent isotropically radiated power). The combination of higher power limits and enhancements made to the MAC timing in 802.11-2007, will allow for the development of standards based 802.11 devices that could operate at distances of or more. IEEE 802.11y adds three new concepts to 802.11-2007 base Standard: :Contention based protocol (CBP) Enhancements have been made to the carrier sensing and energy detection mechanisms of 802.11 in order to meet the FCC's requirements for a contention based protocol. :Extended channel switch announcement (ECSA) provides a mechanism for an access point to notify the stations connected to it of its intention to change channels or to change channel bandwidth. This mechanism will allow for the WLAN to continuously choose the channel that is the least noisy and the least likely to cause interference. ECSA also provides for other functionalities besides dynamic channel selection based on quality & noise characteristics. :For instance, in 802.11y Amendment, the licensed operator can send ECSA commands to any stations operating under their control, registered or unregistered. ECSA is also used in 802.11n. In the 802.11n D2.0 implementation (which is shipping & undergoes Wi-Fi Alliance testing) 20 MHz & 40 MHz channel switching is provided for by the 11n PHY's ECSA implementation. Note that 802.11n is specified for operation in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz license exempt bands but future amendments could permit 11n's PHY to operate in other bands as well. :Dependent station enablement (DSE) is the mechanism by which an operator extends and retracts permission to license exempt devices (referred to as dependent STAs in .11y) to use licensed radio spectrum. Fundamentally, this process satisfies a regulatory requirement that dictates that a dependent STAs operation is contingent upon its ability to receive periodic messages from a licensees base station, but DSE is extensible to other purposes in regards to channel management and coordination. :Some of the benefits of DSE include: :* The enabling station (aka the licensee's base station) may or may not be the access point that the dependent STA connects to. In fact, an enabling station may enable both an access point and its clients. Also, although the dependent STAs are required by regulation to receive information from the enabling station over the air, they are not required to transmit over the air to complete the DSE process. A dependent STA may connect to a nearby Access Point for a short period of time and use the internet or some other means to complete the channel permissioning process with the enabling station. This flexibility reduces the likelihood of a dependent STA causing interference while attempting to connect to a far off enabling station. :* The personal privacy and security of end users are ensured while, at the same time, licensees will have the information necessary to resolve disputes. All .11y devices transmit a unique identifier for the purpose of resolving interference. The high powered fixed stations and enabling stations transmit the location that they are operating from as their unique identifier. This location is also registered in an FCC database that will identify the licensee. The dependent STAs broadcast the location of the station that enabled it plus a unique string supplied by the enabling station. This ensures that the responsible party, the licensee, is contacted to resolve disputes. This mechanism also alleviates the problems associated with having the dependent STA broadcasting its location. Requiring all devices to have GPS or some other means of verifying their location would increase the cost and complexity of devices, and this solution may be inadequate indoors. This method also resolves fears that a mobile devices that constantly beacons its location could be used inappropriately by third parties to track a user's location. Beyond the 3650 band While the scope of 802.11y was limited to operation in the US 3650‚Äì3700 MHz band in the US, care was taken so that, if the light licensing concept was well received, it would not be necessary to start the 3+ year task group process in order for 802.11y devices to operate in other countries or in other frequency bands. As a result, lightly licensed 802.11 devices will be able to operate in any 5, 10, or 20 MHz channel that regulators make available by simply adding entries to the country and regulatory information tables in Annex I and J of 802.11. Other potential bands for 802.11y include: :4.9 GHz The regulatory classes and channel sizing needed to support the US public safety allocation at 4.9 GHz were added to 802.11-2007. DSE and ECSA will allow frequency coordinators to have dynamic control over channel access. :5 GHz Regulators and equipment manufacturers continue to debate the effectiveness of dynamic frequency selection (DFS) as a mechanism to avoid incumbent users in the 5 GHz bands. For example, Canada is not currently certifying 802.11 equipment for use in the 5600‚Äì5650 MHz band that is used by certain types of weather radars. 802.11y may provide a solution that will allow WLANs access to these bands. Firstly, DSE can be used to create exclusion zones around incumbent users; Secondly, when combined with DSE, the 802.11y device identification mechanism allows devices that cause interference to be denied further access to a channel within seconds. :IMT- Advanced candidate bands (450‚Äì862, 2300‚Äì2400, 2700‚Äì2900, 3400‚Äì4200, and 4400‚Äì5000 MHz Since 2003, The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) has been studying the potential for IMT-advanced services (aka systems beyond IMT-2000 or 4G) to use a number of frequencies between 450 and 5000 MHz for the next generation of cellular infrastructure. These systems will be capable of transmitting 100 Mb/s when mobile and 1000 Mb/s while stationary. Unfortunately, with the exception of a small amount of UHF spectrum that will become available upon the completion of the transition from analogue to digital television, these bands are occupied on a piecemeal basis by incumbent users that are not easily relocated. Extensive sharing studies have concluded that co-existence with legacy equipment over the same area is not feasible, so traditional mobile licensing approaches are not practical. Yet academic studies have shown that at any give time, even in dense urban environment, there is ample unused spectrum across the candidate bands. The problem is that usage by the primary services in these bands may change over time (as is the case with some radar systems) or vary by sub-channel based on location (as is the case in the TV bands \\"white spaces\\") 802.11y, along with the continued advances in multi-band radio technology, may provide a solution to this problem by granting channel access dynamically to users based on primary user avoidance techniques, location and time. :It is of note that the US has not been able to adopt a single position on the suitability of the 3650‚Äì3700 band for IMT-advanced, and that neither of the proposed positions seem to recognize the FCC's rules, or the standardization work that has been done to date.

The Spa Conference was a meeting between the Supreme War Council and the government of the Weimar Republic in Spa, Belgium on 5‚Äì16 July 1920. The main topics were German disarmament, coal shipments to the Allies and war reparations. Attendees The Spa Conference was the first post-war conference to include German representatives. The Allies considered that if there were violations of the peace treaty and issues concerning reparations it would be better to discuss the problems face-to-face than through an exchange of notes. The conference was attended by heads of state, heads of government and foreign secretaries. The attendees included British and French Prime Ministers David Lloyd George and Alexandre Millerand, German Chancellor Constantin Fehrenbach. The British and French ambassadors to Germany, Lord d'Abernon and Charles Fran√ßois Laurent, were invited to the Conference and tasked with supervision of reparation payments and control of the Berlin-based Reparation Commission. Discussions =Coal shipments= Contrary to German expectations the conference did not focus on the issue of war reparations but was initially dominated by the topic of disarmament, also part of the Treaty of Versailles. Due to current events the coal negotiations then moved to centre stage. The issue of coal pertained to shipments from Germany to France, Belgium and Italy according to Art. 236 of Part VIII of the Versailles Treaty. In a protocol signed on 19 August 1919 Germany had agreed on these deliveries, but due to the uprisings of spring 1920 (Kapp Putsch, Red Ruhr Army) and associated strikes in the coal industry had been unable to comply. Discussion of the coal issue, which began on 9 July, soon showed that the Allied side was unwilling to compromise. At the very beginning threats about sanctions were issued, with Millerand acting as the spokesman on the Allied side. After days of tough negotiations, the talks almost broke down on 14 July. On 16 July, Fehrenbach and foreign minister Walter Simons signed the Spa coal protocol as drawn up by the Allies. Germany promised to deliver 2 million tons of coal per month for six months. In exchange for the Allied right to insist on the delivery of specifics types or quality of coal, Germany was granted 5 Goldmark per ton to purchase food for the miners. In addition, the Allies agreed to monthly advance payments for the coal. The German side did not sign up to the Allied threat that missed deliveries would be answered by military occupation of the Ruhr or other German territories. Despite Allied financial concessions the coal agreement dealt a heavy blow to the German economy. Supply of coal had been adequate before the conference, but now domestic bottlenecks emerged that damaged output of the iron and steel industry, the railways and coal conversion industry. =War reparations= The German foreign minister, Walter Simons only got a chance on the afternoon of 10 July to outline the German position on reparations. He mostly followed a proposal endorsed by the cabinet beforehand, and avoided naming any hard numbers or dates. On 12 July, the German delegation handed over a number of proposals, once again without definite sums, calling for a total of 30 annual payments. On 13 July these proposals were discussed by a sub-committee of the conference but the concurrent coal discussions had escalated to such a degree that debate on this issue was stopped. The topic was only revisited a few weeks later at a conference in Geneva. There was no settlement of the total sum of German reparations, but the shares of the recipients were fixed: France 52%, UK 22%, Italy 10%, Belgium 8% with the remainder (8%) distributed among the other Allied nations. =Disarmament= The discussions of disarmament focused on the strength of the German army and the treatment of the Sicherheitspolizei, paramilitary police units. The German side arrived with the negotiation goal of a 200,000-man army and the intent to keep the police units, while possibly making concessions on their equipment. However, on this issue also the Allied side was unwilling to move. By the second day the Allies threatened to break off the talks and to implement sanctions unless the German delegation abandoned the 200,000-target. The German counterproposal agreed to 100,000 men but asked for a longer period of implementation. This was rejected by the Allies and on 8 July they handed over a note that specified their position and demanded its signature by the Germans by the next day. Fehrenbach contacted Berlin and on the morning of 9 July his cabinet agreed, but instructed the delegation not to sign the sanction threat the protocol contained. The protocol signed by Fehrenbach and Simons on 9 July called for Sicherheitspolizei and militias to be disarmed immediately and for laws to be passed to disarm the general population. The regular German army was scheduled to be reduced to 100,000 men by 1 January 1921 (this was less than six months away, but later than initially demanded by the Allies), conscription was to be abolished and replaced by a professional army and substantial materiel was to be handed over to the Allies. This was backed up by an Allied threat to occupy additional German territory in case of violations. However, the German side introduced a proviso clause that they did not accede to this last point. =Other topics= Other controversial issues included the trial of German war criminals and the status of Gda≈Ñsk. There was also discussion of the territorial dispute over Cieszyn Silesia between the Second Polish Republic and Czechoslovakia. After the conference, on 28 July 1920, the territory was divided between the states leaving Zaolzie with a sizable Polish minority on the Czech side of the border. This division also created further future animosities between these two countries.

Preparation and structure Pd2(dba)3 First reported in 1970, it is prepared from dibenzylideneacetone and sodium tetrachloropalladate. Because it is commonly recrystallized from chloroform, the complex is often supplied as the adduct [Pd2(dba)3¬∑CHCl3].Jiro Tsuji and Ian J. S.

In this view, meaning and value of actions done to people or the environment are attributed to God. The tenets of theocentrism, such as humility, respect, moderations, selflessness, and mindfulness, can lend themselves towards a form of environmentalism. In modern theology, theocentricism is often linked with stewardship and environmental ethics or Creation care. It is the belief that human beings should look after the world as guardians and therefore in the way God wants them to. Humans should be considerate to all, from animals to plants to humans themselves. It maintains that human beings are merely here for a short time and should be looking after the world for future generations. In Christian theology, theocentricism has sometimes been used to describe theologies that focus on God the Father, as opposed to those that focus on Christ (Christocentric) or the Holy Spirit (Pneumocentric). Theocentrism was a key element of the Christology of Saint Augustine.Orthodox readings of Augustine by George E. Demacopoulos, Aristotle Papanikolaou 2008 page 271 This view is resisted among some theologians on the grounds that it poses a challenge to trinity. One of these theologians is Carl Baaten who said, \\"If one can speak of God who is really God apart from Christ, there is indeed no reason for the doctrine of the Trinity. Some kind of Unitarianism will do the job.\\" Paul F. Knitter, in his defense as a Theocentric Christian, said it depends on how the unity between God and Jesus Christ within trinity is seen. He says that, \\"we cannot so neatly or exclusively affirm that the Logos/Christ is Jesus. The 'incarnating' activity of the Logos is actualized in but not restricted to Jesus. The God manifested in and as Jesus of Nazareth is the only true God\\". However, the term can be confusing because theocentrism can also refer to a theology that does not center on any one person of the Trinity, but rather emphases the entire Godhead as a whole. Theologies that center on the Father are sometimes referred to as paterocentric instead. It is popular with Christianity, Judaism and Islam.

Stuart Hall was refounded by the Episcopal Church as the Virginia Female Institute in 1844. In the spirit of the Lost Cause, it was renamed in 1907 in honor of its most famous headmistress Mrs. Gen. Flora Cooke Stuart, the widow of Confederate cavalry leader Maj. Gen. J. E. B. Stuart. Flora and J.E.B. owned several slaves before the Civil War. History In 1827, Stuart Hall started as Mrs. Maria Sheffey's school which held classes in her Staunton home - Kalorama. It was called Kalorama Seminary. After being approached by Trinity Episcopal Church to compete with Mary Baldwin, Sheffey agreed to join with their organization. In 1844, they renamed the school to \\"Virginia Female Institute\\" marking the first of many branding changes of the school. Very quickly, the powers that be pushed out the widow and kept her students. In the original charter of 1844, the Board of Governors stated its purpose was to educate ‚Äúwhite women.‚Äù However, black women were not uncommon on the school grounds. Richer students would often bring their slaves with them. They would sleep on the floor beside the student‚Äôs beds to be at the beck and call if ever the need arose. Old Main is a three-story, five bay, brick Greek Revival style building completed in 1844. It features an impressive two-story, three bay, Doric order portico with a simple heavy frieze supported by four paneled piers. and Accompanying photo It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. \\"Old Main\\" is a common nickname for Stuart Hall. It is located in the Newtown Historic District. Dr. Reverend Phillips, the highly regarded headmaster, came to the Virginia Female Institute in 1848. The handsome Philips started to model the school after the University of Virginia, elevated the academics, and introduced the Honor Code system. Phillips also brought his slaves. He had split up his sister‚Äôs slaves to bring some to Staunton as punishment. John Washington, slave and noted author, recalled this event and his time at Stuart Hall as a lasting lesson in ‚Äúthe brutality of the white man.‚Äù Phillips very quickly separated John from his mother and sent him back the sister's house after proving to be too hard to discipline. John Washington never saw his mother again who remained enslaved in Stuart Hall. The highest award at Stuart Hall is named after Dr. Reverend Phillips. During the American Civil War, the school's building was used to house the Virginia School for the Deaf and the Blind while the latter's building was being used as a hospital. Students then attended classes in a nearby home in Staunton. Under the direction of Robert E. Lee and Flora Cooke Stuart, the school prospered through the Reconstruction. Mrs. Stuart revised the curriculum, stressed proper decorum for southern ladies and raised the standards of scholarship. Their name recognition proved to be a boom for the school. From 1899 to 1915, the principal was Miss Maria Pendleton Duval, Mrs. Stuart's cousin, and the first faculty advisor to ELA, the student group that founded the library in 1882. Under her oversight and following the movement to honor \\"The Lost Cause\\", the school was renamed to \\"Stuart Hall\\" in 1907 and was expanded to include kindergarten to Grade 12, with boys being admitted to the Lower School. In 1940, the Lower School was discontinued. In 1954, the Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that public schools would have to desegregate. This ruling and the resulting white flight proved to be the golden years for Stuart Hall both in terms of enrollment and money. While the Episcopal Church encouraged change from the school in the late 1950s, Miss Martha Dabney Jones, now serving in the role of Head Mistress, managed to assuage the church and the board while dragging her feet to prevent any social change at the school. During this time, the connections between the ‚ÄúOld South‚Äù and the school were strengthened through celebrations; like the gifting of the JEB Stuart Confederate battle flag in 1968. It was not until 1970 when IRS agents visited the school to inform her that the school could lose its tax status as a non-profit organization, that Stuart Hall started considering allowing black students. Black students were finally allowed in 1972. The JEB Stuart‚Äôs confederate flag was proudly displayed until 1996. In 1992, the Middle School was opened, serving male and female day students in Grades 6 to 8. In 1999, boys were accepted as day students into the Upper School. In 2007, Stuart Hall School merged with Hunter McGuire School in Verona, VA and again became a K-12 independent school. A prekindergarten class was added in 2008. Current operations Stuart Hall is a private boarding and day school. It provides co-educational boarding (Grades 8 to 12) and day schooling (Grade 3 to Grade 12). In 2003, after going into financial distress from building the Echols Wing, Stuart Hall School was forced once again became a member of the Church Schools of the Diocese of Virginia. Stuart Hall boarding students come from all over the United States. Stuart Hall (known by the students as STU), also boards international students who come from several countries and continents outside the US, including Canada, Africa, Korea, China and Mexico. Stuart Hall is located near Mary Baldwin College, at 235 W. Frederick Street in Staunton. Because of the proximity, students in 11th and 12th grades have the opportunity to participate in classes at the College. The students and staff participate in traditions that existed since the school first opened. Most of the traditions, such as Ring Banquet (giving of the class rings), Junior-Senior Banquet, Loving Cup, and even graduation, are planned by students and faculty members. Some traditions stopped over the years. Many of the secret societies and clubs were disbanded. In the late 1990‚Äôs, the annual ‚ÄòFreshman Slave Auction was discontinued.The school also holds the Red and White competition, which is a friendly competition between students and faculty. The school colors were inspired by the confederate flag that was hand-sewed by the Mrs. General JEB Stuart.

Wemyss Ware was a line of pottery first produced in 1882 by Czech decorator Karel Nekola and Fife pottery-owner Robert Heron. The pottery took its name from the Wemyss family, titled incumbents of Wemyss Castle on the east coast of Fife, who were early and enthusiastic patrons of Nekola and Heron's ceramic creations. After being desirable in its own day, the pottery subsequently became extremely popular with collectors. Since 1985, the name has been used by the Griselda Hill Pottery in Ceres, Fife. History The Wemyss Ware name has gone through four distinct phases of use. In the period 1882‚Äì1930, it was used by the Fife Pottery in Kirkcaldy, and then from 1930 to 1957, it was used by the Bovey Pottery in Devon. From 1985 to the present day, it is used by the Griselda Hill Pottery in Ceres, Fife which owns the Wemyss Trade Mark. =Wemyss pottery= alt=A painted plate, surrounded by cabbage roses, has a bearded man painting an umbrella stand with cabbage roses. At the bottom a caption reads \\"Karel Nekola 1857‚Äì1915\\". One of several potteries in Kirkcaldy, the Fife Pottery or Gallatown Pottery was founded in 1817 by Archibald and Andrew Grey. It was bought ten years later by John Methven, and from there passed to Robert Heron. When his son, Robert Methven Heron (1833‚Äì1906) took over the pottery in around 1850, it became Robert Heron and Son. By the 1880s, Robert Heron and Son were branding their products as \\"Wemyss ware\\" in honour of the Wemyss family who were avid and lucrative patrons. Karel Nekola, a native of Bohemia, was brought over to Kirkcaldy in about 1882 by Robert Heron to become head of the decorating shop there. Aged 25, he was the only one of a group of decorators to remain in Scotland, after Heron had returned from a Grand Tour of Europe with a group of Bohemian craftsmen. Nekola married Heron's cook, and the couple had six children. Thomas Goode of London, an upmarket tableware retailer, had the exclusive right to sell Wemyss Ware in England. Nekola's health began to deteriorate in 1910, and a pottery was built at his home in order to allow him to continue to work. He died in 1915, and was succeeded by Edwin Sandland, a painter from Staffordshire that descended from a long line of master-potters, who worked at the pottery until he died in 1928, aged 55. =Devon= The original Fife pottery closed in 1930, during the Great Depression, and the rights to Wemyss Ware were bought by the Bovey pottery in Devon. Karel Nekola's son Joseph, himself a designer, moved to Devon, where he carried on producing Wemyss Ware and training apprentices, including Esther Weeks (n√©e Clark). Joseph taught her painting techniques he had learned from his father. A number of pieces produced during this time are marked as \\"Plichta.\\" Jan Plichta was a Czech immigrant that sold and exported wholesale glass and pottery, and items he ordered from the Bovey Pottery were marked with his name. Some confusion exists between the Plichta and Wemyss names, as sometimes Wemyss decorators produced items for Plichta, but in the most part Plichta items are inferior in quality. When Joseph died in 1952, Esther became head decorator and continued to paint Wemyss Ware until the Bovey Pottery closed in 1957 after a protracted strike by the workforce. The rights to the Wemyss name were assumed to be acquired by Royal Doulton, but they produced one piece of Wemyss, a commemorative goblet for the Queen Mother's 80th birthday. This piece also commemorated the centenary of Wemyss Ware, but was two years early, celebrating the production of Wemyss from 1880, when it had commenced in 1882. =Revival= alt=Two women are in a workshop full of moulds. The woman on the left, Griselda Hill, is standing, while the other woman sits with an unpainted pig in front of her. The Wemyss name was resurrected in the 1980s when Griselda Hill became interested in pottery while teaching art in London. She moved to Fife in 1984, and after seeing Wemyss Ware in the Kirkcaldy Museum and Art Gallery, she decided to create Wemyss Ware-inspired pottery. Since the first figure, a cat modelled on an original displayed in the museum, was produced, the line has grown. In 1994, the Wemyss Ware trademark was acquired by the Griselda Hill Pottery in Ceres, Fife. Esther Weeks taught the painters at Ceres techniques she learned from Joseph Nekola at Bovey. Style and technique alt=A large pig with comical features sits among other items in a shop display. After moulding, the pottery was first fired at a low temperature to produce a porous biscuit body onto which paint could be applied. The colours were then applied, followed by a lead ceramic glaze, a technique known as underglazing. The pottery was then fired again at a low temperature in order to preserve the colour, making the product soft and fragile and contributing to the scarcity of original Wemyss. Pottery produced by the Griselda Hill pottery uses a different technique, and is much more robust. Wemyss was decorated with natural subjects, such as fruit and flowers, in particular the cabbage rose, and British wildlife. Collecting After being desirable in its own day, the pottery subsequently became extremely popular with collectors. The Queen Mother was a great fan of Wemyss, and is said to have amassed one of the largest private collections of the pottery. The high value of Wemyss Ware has led to a proliferation of fakes, in particular of pigs. In 2004, a pair of sleeping piglets were sold for each at the Sotheby's annual Scottish Sale.

A downrigger consists of a three to six- foot horizontal pole which supports a cannonball, generally 10 to 15 pounds, by a steel cable (generally stainless steel or wire). A clip, also known as a \\"release,\\" attaches a fishing line to the cannonball weight. The bait or lure is attached to the release. Operation of a downrigger Downriggers consist of four major components, the weight, cable, pole or boom, and the spool. A fishing line is attached to the downrigger cable by means of a \\"line release.\\" The weight is normally a five-to-twenty-pound mass of lead which is connected to the stainless steel cable. The spool is brought up either by a manual crank or via an electric motor. In addition to attaching a lure to the fishing line, an oval piece of metal or plastic (often hammered or curved for reflective purposes) called a dodger or flasher is often used to attract fish from greater distances. The types of lures used to troll with using dowriggers range from metal \\"spoons\\" that are often decorated using color tape or paint, plastic or rubber \\"squids\\", tinsel beaded flies, or painted plastic J-plugs. These all come in a variety of colors, finishes, and glow patterns for various fishing conditions. The length of fishing line between the downrigger release and the lure is known as the \\"lead\\" and this varies in length depending on how far behind the boat the fisherman would like to lure to trail. This fishing line is typically between ten and twenty pound test. When fishing for salmon this lead is often quite lengthy in order to avoid the fish being frightened by the noise of the boat's trolling motor. When many boats are trolling in a small area this often results in crossed lines and tangles which are a detriment to the fishing experience. The speed at which the lure is pulled through the water has a great impact on success or failure. For this reason fishermen use devices that accurately track speed. Typically, trolling from one to five knots is the range that allows for fish to be caught. This varies from species to species as Chinook Salmon may prefer higher speeds while the more docile Lake Trout may prefer a much slower-moving lure. Trolling motors are used to calibrate this speed more accurately than large outboard motors. Trolling plates may be used with larger motors to slow the boat to the desired speed, although some anglers experience mixed results using plates. The downrigger should be set at the depth the target fish are schooling. Different species of fish school at different depths, and those depths also change at different times of year. A fish finder is useful determining this depth. Using a downrigger may be hazardous. Many manmade reservoirs mask submerged trees and other structure beneath the surface. A downrigger's weight may foul on such objects. When such a snag occurs in conjunction with high winds, it may cause a lighter boat to capsize. It is therefore prudent to carry wire cutters to avoid this potentially lethal scenario. Brief history Using a downrigger began in effort to increase productivity of fishing in larger bodies of water. Downriggers are used to troll and maintain the lure's depth in accordance with the thermocline at which the fish species being sought normally feeds. People began using downriggers first in the Great Lakes area. They are now used all over the world to help catch a large variety of fish. In the Great Lakes, downriggers are used to catch a variety of species including chinook salmon, atlantic salmon, lake trout, brown trout and steelhead. Recently discovery of an Edward vom Hofe late 1860s-1870s downrigger found local to Niagara Falls and the Salmon River area point to the reelmaker Edward Vom Hofe Brooklyn New York as the father of the modern downrigger. Prior it was thought that the great lakes Michigan anglers had invented the modern rig. However it was intended for the deep water basin fish listed above and most likely prior to the Hydroelectric plant being built on the Niagara River late 1870s. Somehow the device was lost in time due to the construction of the electric plant most likely causing a disruption in the Salmon fishing. Only one of these examples exist today. Not until the 1950s would a device similar to the Vom Hofe design reappear. It is possible that the modern downrigger introduced in the 1950s was copied from another Vom Hofe made device but for now that can not be proven due to the great time span in between the two designs. Edward vom Hofe was a premier tackle smith and reel maker. There are two main classifications of downriggers today. There are manual downriggers, such as the Cannon Uni-Troll or Scotty Downrigger. There are also electric downriggers like the Scotty electric Downrigger and Cannon's Optimum Downrigger. A manual downrigger requires the user to crank the line to retrieve the weight. An electric downrigger utilizes an input screen and has automatic functions controlled by the user with the press of a button.

A person has an insurable interest in something when loss of or damage to that thing would cause the person to suffer a financial or other kind of loss. Normally, insurable interest is established by ownership, possession, or direct relationship. For example, people have insurable interests in their own homes and vehicles, but not in their neighbors' homes and vehicles, and almost certainly not those of strangers. The \\"factual expectancy test\\" and \\"legal interest test\\" are the two major concepts of insurable interest.Kimball- Stanley A. (2008). Insurance and Credit Default Swaps: Should Like Things Be Treated Alike . CONNECTICUT INSURANCE LAW JOURNAL. Historical background The concept of insurable interest as a prerequisite for the purchase of insurance distanced the insurance business from gambling, thereby enhancing the industry's reputation and leading to greater acceptance of the insurance industry. The United Kingdom was a leader in that trend by passing legislation that prohibited insurance contracts if no insurable interest could be proven. Notably the Marine Insurance Act 1745 (which introduced the concept of an insurable interest, although it did not use the term expressly), the Life Assurance Act 1774 which renders such life insurance contracts illegal, and the Marine Insurance Act 1906, s.4 which renders such contracts void. In 1806 Lord Eldon LC sitting in English House of Lords in Lucena v Craufurd (1806) 2 Bos & PNR 269 sought to define an insurable interest, and although that definition is often used, modern commentators regard it as unsatisfactory. Lord Eldon defined it as \\"a right in property, or a right derivable out of some contract about the property, which in either case may be lost upon some contingency affecting the possession or enjoyment of the party\\". Life insurance Insurable interest refers to the right of property to be insured.The Free Dictionary definition of Insurable interest, citing cases at 1 Burr. 489. See 20 Pick. 259; 1 Pet. 163. Accessed June 18, 2009.Anthony Steuer, Questions and Answers on Life Insurance: The Life Insurance Toolbook, p. 310 (Anthony Steuer, 2007) found at Google Books. Accessed June 18, 2009. It may also mean the interest of a beneficiary of a life insurance policy to prove need for the proceeds, called the \\"insurable interest doctrine\\". Specifically, insurable interest is: Insurable interest is no longer strictly an element of life insurance contracts under modern law. Exceptions include viatication agreements and charitable donations. The principle of insurable interest on life insurance is that a person or organization can obtain an insurance policy on the life of another person if the person or organization obtaining the insurance values the life of the insured more than the amount of the policy. In this way, insurance can compensate for loss. A company may have an insurable interest in a President/CEO or other employee with special knowledge and skills. A creditor has an insurable interest in the life of a debtor, up to the amount of the loan. A person who is financially dependent on a second person has an insurable interest in the life of that second person. Legal guidelines have been established in many jurisdictions which establish the kinds of family relationships for which an insurable interest exists. The insurable interest of family members is assumed to be emotional as well as financial. The law allows insurable interest on the presumption that a personal connection makes the family member more valuable alive than dead. Thus, husbands/wives have an insurable interest in their spouse, and children have an insurable interest in their parents (and vice versa). Brothers/sisters and grandchildren/grandparents are also assumed to have an insurable interest in the lives of those relatives. But cousins, nieces/nephews, aunts/uncles, stepchildren/stepparents and in-laws cannot buy insurance on the lives of others related by these connections. However in life insurance relationships are more looked into than the pecuniary value that one holds against the other, because without an immediate family or a relationship that is recognized by law there is no insurable interest. = Law in the United Kingdom = A person is presumed to have an insurable interest in his or her own life,Griffiths v. Fleming [1909] 1 KB 805; M'Farlane v. Royal London Friendly Society (1886) 2 TLR 755 preferring to be alive and in good health rather than being sick, injured or dead. The unlimited interest extends to the life of spouses (and, since 2004, civil partners), even if there is no financial dependency.Griffiths v. Fleming [1909] 1 KB 805; Married Women's Property Act 1882, section 11. Law in the United Kingdom does not recognize other classes of so-called 'natural affection' however, thus: *Parents have no interest in the lives of their children *Siblings have no interest in the lives of their fellow siblings *Children have no interest in the lives of their parents (Scotland only) Nor is insurable interest recognized for cohabiting couples. Although many insurers will accept such policies, they could potentially be invalidated because they have not been tested in court. In recent years, there have been moves to pass clear statutory provisions in this regard, which have not yet borne fruit.Report on Family Law; Cohabitation, s. XVI , Scottish Law Commission. In practice these problems are solved by people assigning their policies or placing them in trust with named beneficiaries. If a person obtains an insurance policy on their own life, it is presumed that the person would only name a beneficiary who wants the insured to be alive and healthy. There is no requirement that the beneficiary have a proven insurable interest in the life of the insured when the insured has purchased the insurance. In 2008, the Scottish Law Commission and the Law Commission of England and Wales tentatively proposed some reforms to the existing law, hoping to clarify the complex rules. Their preliminary recommendations included increasing the category of 'natural affection' to include dependent children and parents and also cohabitees. Officially this is still under review.\\"Legal basis of insurance: insurable interest\\". General Insurance Manual. HM Revenue and Customs. 16 August 2016. Credit default swaps In eConned, Yves Smith argues that credit default swaps were/are used to take out insurance-like contracts against financial products in which buyers had no insurable interest. This was related to the financial crisis of 2008 because hedge funds and others allegedly helped produce bad subprime mortgages on purpose so that they could buy insurance on them, and then profit when the home buyers failed to make payments.EConned, by Yves Smith, 2010, Palgrave Macmillan, p 243, and entire chapter Heart of Darkness See also *Insurability *Liability insurance *Life insurance *Property insurance References Insurable interest ","title":"Insurable interest"},{"id":"4321383","text":"Fior di latte may refer to: Foods * Mozzarella made from cow rather than buffalo milk * A popular gelato type with no flavor added ","title":"Fior di latte"},{"id":"4321393","text":"Snelrewaard is a hamlet in the Dutch province of Utrecht.

Background  Previously, the war against Mithridates (commonly known as the Third Mithridatic War) had been conducted by Lucius Licinius Lucullus. By the winter of 68‚Äì7 BC, Lucullus had ejected Mithridates from his kingdom of Pontus and had invaded the Armenian empire of Mithridates' ally, Tigranes the Great. However, Lucullus was forced to halt his advances when his discontented legions (the 'Fimbrian Legions', many of whom who had been in the East since the command of Gaius Flavius Fimbria in 86 BC) mutinied under the leadership of Publius Clodius Pulcher.A.N.

The movie was shot in Malta and starred Milton Berle, Joan Collins, and George Jessel. Personal life Los Angeles Times writer Joyce Haber mentioned Kreski in a newspaper column just days after the murder of Sharon Tate by followers of Charles Manson. Kreski was a member of the murdered actress's social circle along with John Phillips, Michelle Phillips, Tina Sinatra, Jacqueline Bisset, Sharmagne Leland-St. John, Michael Sarrazin, and Andrew Prine. Kreski was among those invited to the mansion Tate shared with her husband, director Roman Polanski, on Cielo Drive in Los Angeles, California. Haber reported that some of those invited declined to attend on the fatal night of August 9, 1969. Death Kreski died of a blocked carotid artery on March 21, 1995 in Beverly Hills, California.

A shortstop in college,\\"Ryan Theriot Bio\\", LSUSports.net, May 30, 2006. Theriot was converted to second base for his major league debut, but played shortstop throughout the 2007‚Äì2009 seasons.\\"Ryan Theriot Statistics\\", Baseball-Reference.com. Theriot then was switched back to second base to make room for the rookie Starlin Castro, who took his spot at shortstop on May 7, 2010. Theriot also played third base, right field, and left field. Early years Theriot graduated from Broadmoor High School in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in 1998. While there he played three seasons on the basketball team as a point guard and four seasons on the baseball team as a shortstop. He was a highly decorated baseball player, so he opted to not play basketball during his senior year of high school to focus on his baseball skills. While at Broadmoor he played alongside childhood friends, Mike Woods and Trae Duncan, and together they set Louisiana High School Athletic Association history by becoming All American infielders from the same high school. They all later became 1st team All State for class 4A at third base, shortstop, and second base, becoming the first trio to earn such awards. College career Theriot played college baseball at Louisiana State University and was named to the College World Series all-tournament team in 2000. On June 12, 2000, Theriot broke up a no-hitter that was being thrown by his future teammate, Mark Prior, then pitching for Southern Cal. Theriot scored the game-winning run in the 2000 national championship game following a Brad Cresse single. The CWS title was the fifth for LSU in nine seasons. Theriot was named The Most Stylish Athlete. After the 2000 season, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Ryan followed up the 2000 season with a very good 2001 campaign that resulted in a 2nd Team All-SEC selection, the only All-conference honor of his college career. Prior to the 2001 season, Theriot was voted team captain by his teammates. Theriot began his career as LSU's starting second baseman in 1999. He moved to shortstop in 2000 to make way for future Cubs teammate and former LSU teammate Mike Fontenot. Professional career =Chicago Cubs= Theriot warms up before a game in . Theriot made his Major League Baseball debut on September 13, 2005, as a pinch hitter against the Cincinnati Reds, and gained his first hit the following day against Brian Shackelford.Ryan Theriot Bio, 2007 Chicago Cubs Media Guide, page 157. In 2006, he split time between the Iowa Cubs and the major league team, hitting .328 in 53 games with the Chicago team. In 2007, Theriot made the opening day roster as a utility player. However, the early season struggles of C√©sar Izturis lead to Theriot getting more starts and quickly became the starter. Izturis was traded in July. Also in 2007, Theriot was reunited with his former collegiate teammate Mike Fontenot.LSU Athletics, Theriot, Fontenot Reunite in Cubs Infield (June 12, 2007), LSUsports.net, Retrieved on July 28, 2007. Theriot and Fontenot made up the double play combination for the 2000 National Champion LSU Tigers. Theriot was notably versatile throughout the 2007 season, playing multiple positions defensively and hitting all over the batting order. Despite impressive numbers from Theriot in the lead-off spot, albeit a small sample size, the return of Alfonso Soriano resulted in Theriot returning to second in the batting order. While not expected to hit for power, Theriot was asked to try to drive in more runs early in 2009 as the Cubs dealt with injuries and poor performance from their power hitters, including Aramis Ram√≠rez, Alfonso Soriano, Geovany Soto, and Milton Bradley. He quickly went on a relative tear and smacked 7 home runs, including his first two ever outside Wrigley Field, as the other players regained their health. Theriot hit his first career grand slam on May 1, 2009, against the Florida Marlins. The Cubs were down 5‚Äì2 when he hit it, and it gave them the lead. The Cubs won 8‚Äì6. On February 19, 2010, the Cubs went to salary arbitration with Theriot, the first time they had gone to arbitration with a player since 1993. Theriot's figure was one year, $3.4M. The Cubs' figure was also one year, $2.6M. The Cubs won the case. He appeared in 96 games with the Cubs in 2010, hitting .284. =Los Angeles Dodgers = On July 31, 2010, Theriot and Ted Lilly were traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Blake DeWitt. He was assigned the number 13. He hit .242 in 54 games with the Dodgers. At 2nd base, Theriot had a .996 fielding percentage. =St. Louis Cardinals = On November 30, 2010, Theriot was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals for Blake Hawksworth. Theriot wore number 3 on his uniform, as his familiar number 2 was unavailable. During the 2011 season, Theriot had a 20-game hitting streak. He also drove in 47 runs and hit 26 doubles in only 442 at-bats. On July 17, 2011, Theriot was ejected from the game between the Cardinals and the Reds for arguing and making contact with an umpire with his hat after a call that Theriot's foot was dragged off the bag during a catch at second base. He was suspended for two games and fined, but the suspension was later reduced to only one game. Theriot won the World Series with the Cardinals in 2011. He contributed greatly with his bat, especially in the National League Division Series with the Philadelphia Phillies. Against the Milwaukee Brewers, Theriot at second base robbed Prince Fielder of a seemingly sure hit for the third out of the inning. Fielder was so impressed with the play that he waited for Theriot to exit the field and gave him an enthusiastic high five. =San Francisco Giants = On January 27, 2012, Theriot agreed to a one-year, $1.25 million non-guaranteed contract with the San Francisco Giants, providing depth to the team's middle infield. Theriot was briefly reunited with his college teammate and double play partner Mike Fontenot, before Fontenot was released by the Giants at the end of Spring Training. Theriot shared playing time at second base with Emmanuel Burriss at the beginning of the season, but went on the 15-day disabled list in May. When he returned, he became the regular second baseman, replacing the struggling Burriss. He would remain in the lineup virtually every day until August, when he was moved back to the bench and lost his starting job to the newly acquired Marco Scutaro, whom the Giants had acquired in a trade with the Colorado Rockies. Theriot won the World Series with the San Francisco Giants in 2012. In Game 4 of the Series, Theriot was used as a designated hitter for the first time in his major league career. In the tenth inning, he hit a leadoff single and eventually scored the go-ahead and winning run (coincidentally being driven in by Scutaro, the same man who had taken his spot in the lineup 2 months before), which gave the Giants the clinching victory in a 4-game sweep of the Detroit Tigers. As it turned out, Theriot scored the game- and world series-clinching run in his final on-field action in the Major Leagues. After sitting out the entire 2013 season, Theriot announced his retirement on January 6, 2014. =Career statistics= In 899 games over eight seasons, Theriot posted a .281 batting average (911-for-3246) with 446 runs, 17 home runs, 257 RBI, 121 stolen bases and 285 bases on balls. He finished his career with a .976 fielding percentage playing primarily at shortstop and second base. Personal Theriot and his wife, Johnnah Haik, live in Baton Rouge, Louisiana with their three children. Theriot was sometimes referred to by Cubs (and later Giants) fans and broadcasters as \\"The Riot\\" as a play on the spelling of his last name. On November 12, 2010, Theriot hosted the Ryan Theriot Golf Classic which benefits the National Wildlife Federation, the Autism Society, and the Fore Kids Foundation. Theriot is good friends with Mike Fontenot, who were teammates in college at Louisiana State University and with the Chicago Cubs. Ryan is a founder of Traction Sports Performance and alongside does AFR , a radio show with Matt Moscona. His two girls play soccer and are top tier and his son plays baseball, basketball,and football.

The graph illustrates the free energy vs oxidation state of a chemical species. This effect is dependent on pH, so this parameter also must be included. The free energy is determined by the oxidation‚Äìreduction half-reactions. The Frost diagram allows easier comprehension of these reduction potentials than the earlier-designed Latimer diagram, because the ‚Äúlack of additivity of potentials‚Äù was confusing. The free energy ŒîG¬∞ is related to reduction potential E in the graph by given formula: ŒîG¬∞ = ‚àínFE¬∞ or nE¬∞ = ‚àíŒîG¬∞/F, where n is the number of transferred electrons, and F is Faraday constant (F = 96,485 J/(V¬∑mol)). The Frost diagram is named after , who originally created it as a way to \\"show both free energy and oxidation potential data conveniently\\" in a 1951 paper. pH dependence Frost diagram for nitrogen at different pH levels The pH dependence is given by the factor ‚àí0.059m/n per pH unit, where m relates to the number of protons in the equation, and n the number of electrons exchanged. Electrons are always exchanged in electrochemistry, but not necessarily protons. If there is no proton exchange in the reaction equilibrium, the reaction is said to be pH- independent. This means that the values for the electrochemical potential rendered in a redox half-reaction, whereby the elements in question change oxidation states are the same whatever the pH conditions under which the procedure is carried out. The Frost diagram is also a useful tool for comparing the trends of standard potentials (slope) of acidic and basic solutions. The pure, neutral element transitions to different compounds depending whether the species is in acidic and basic pHs. Though the value and amount of oxidation states remain unchanged, the free energies can vary greatly. The Frost diagram allows the superimposition of acidic and basic graphs for easy and convenient comparison.  Unit and scale  The standard free-energy scale is measured in electron-volts, and the nE¬∞ = 0 value is usually the pure, neutral element. The Frost diagram normally shows free- energy values above and below nE¬∞ = 0 and is scaled in integers. The y axis of the graph displays the free energy. Increasing stability (lower free energy) is lower on the graph, so the higher free energy and higher on the graph an element is, the more unstable and reactive it is. The oxidation state of the element is shown on the x axis of the Frost diagram. Oxidation states are unitless and are also scaled in positive and negative integers. Most often, the Frost diagram displays oxidation number in increasing order, but in some cases it is displayed in decreasing order. The neutral, pure element with a free energy of zero (nE¬∞ = 0) also has an oxidation state equal to zero. The slope of the line therefore represents the standard potential between two oxidation states. In other words, the steepness of the line shows the tendency for those two reactants to react and form the lowest-energy product. There is a possibility of having either a positive or negative slope. A positive slope between two species indicates a tendency for an oxidation reaction, while a negative slope between two species indicates a tendency for reduction. For example, if the manganese in [HMnO4]‚àí has an oxidation state of +6 and nE¬∞ = 4, and in MnO2 the oxidation state is +4 and nE¬∞ = 0, then the slope Œîy/Œîx is 4/2 = 2, yielding the standard potential of +2. The stability of any terms can be similarly found by this graph. Gradient The gradient of the line between any two points on a Frost diagram gives the potential for the reaction. A species that lies in a peak, above the gradient of the two points on either side, denotes a species unstable with respect to disproportionation, and a point that falls below the gradient of the line joining its two adjacent points lies in a thermodynamic sink, and is intrinsically stable. Axes The axes of the Frost diagram show (horizontally) the oxidation state of the species in question and (vertically) the electron exchange number multiplied by the voltage (nE) or the Gibbs free energy per unit of the Faraday constant, ŒîG/F.  Disproportionation and comproportionation  In regards to electrochemical reactions, two main types of reactions can be visualized using the Frost diagram. Comproportionation is when two equivalents of an element, differing in oxidation number, combine to form a product with an intermediate oxidation number. Disproportionation is the opposite reaction, in which two equivalents of an element, identical in oxidation number, react to form two products of differing oxidation numbers. Disproportionation: 2 Mn+ ‚Üí Mm+ + Mp+. Comproportionation: Mm+ + Mp+ ‚Üí 2 Mn+. 2 n = m + p in both examples. Using a Frost diagram, one can predict whether one oxidation number would undergo disproportionation or two oxidation numbers would undergo comproportionation. Looking at two slopes among a set of three oxidation numbers on the diagram, assuming the two standard potentials (slopes) are not equal, the middle oxidation will either be in a ‚Äúhill‚Äù or ‚Äúvalley‚Äù form. A hill is formed when the left slope is steeper than the right, and a valley is formed when the right slope is steeper than the left. An oxidation number that is on ‚Äútop of the hill‚Äù tends to favor disproportionation into the adjacent oxidation states. The adjacent oxidation states, however, will favor comproportionation if the middle oxidation state is in the ‚Äúbottom of a valley‚Äù.  Criticisms/discrepancies  Arthur Frost stated in his own original publication that there may be potential criticism for his Frost diagram. He predicts that ‚Äúthe slopes may not be as easily or accurately recognized as they are the direct numerical values of the oxidation potentials [of the Latimer diagram]‚Äù. Many inorganic chemists use both the Latimer and Frost diagrams in tandem, using the Latimer for quantitative data, and then converting those data into a Frost diagram for visualization. Frost suggested that the numerical values of standard potentials could be added next to the slopes to provide supplemental information. In a paper by Jes√∫s M. Martinez de Ilarduya, he warns users of Frost diagrams to be aware of the definition of free energy being used to construct the diagrams. In acid-solution graphs, the standard nE¬∞ = ‚àíŒîG/F is universally used; therefore all sources‚Äô acid-solution Frost diagrams will be identical. However, various textbooks show discrepancies in the Frost diagram of an element, in regards to the energy. Some textbooks use the same reduction potential (E¬∞(H+/H2)) as an acid- solution for a basic-solution. In the Phillips and Williams Inorganic Chemistry textbook, however, a new reduction potential is used for the basic solutions given by the following formula: E¬∞(OH) = E¬∞b ‚àí E¬∞(H2O/H2OH‚àí) = E¬∞b + 0.828. This new type of reduction potential is used in some textbooks and not others, and is not always notated on the graph. Users of the Frost diagram should be aware of which free-energy scale their diagram displays.

His most famous work is Pokuraamat (The Poku Book).  Life  Edgar Valter was born on 21 September 1929, in Tallinn, the fourth child of a family of eight kids. He completed middle-school in 1945, but didn't graduate from Secondary School. He began working as a freelance artist in 1950, eventually illustrating some of the most famous Estonian children literature characters, including the Kr√µll, the Naksitrallid, the Sipsik, and the Kunksmoor. Edgar Valter illustrated over 250 books, most of them being books for children. His caricatures were published by many journals and newspapers. Edgar Valter worked for the magazines Hea Laps (a good kid), T√§heke (a star), Pioneer, and Pikker (a humor and satire magazine published during soviet times). Edgar Valter lived his last 15 years in the P√∂√∂rism√§e farm, located at the Urvaste rural municipality of the V√µrumaa County. He died on 4 March 2006. His remains were cremated and buried on 17 May 2006 at Metsakalmistu in Tallinn.  The Poku Book and Pokus  The Pokuhall in Pokuland, Urvaste Parish, V√µru County. First published in 1994, Pokuraamat (The Poku Book) tells the tale of Pokus. A poku is a grass mound that grows in south-eastern Estonian bogs. In the book, Valter interprets pokus as animated childlike creatures, the grass actually being their golden head hair, which grows down to their feet. Its central theme is emphasizing the need to respect and to live in harmony with nature. Pokuraamat was the first book that was both written and illustrated by Edgar Valter. In 1996, the book won the prestigious Nukits Competition award for best children book of the year. Edgar Valter wrote two subsequent Poku-related books after that: Pokuaabits (The Poku ABC) (2002) and Pokulood (Poku Stories) (2004).

The medium-sized segment (M) codes for a precursor of the viral glycoproteins and non-structural components. The product of the largest segment (L) is the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Clinical significance The following twelve viruses have been linked to disease in humans: Alenquer virus, Bhanja virus,Vesenjak-Hirjan J, Calisher CH, Beus I. Marton E.

Publication history The Pre-Crisis Reaper debuted in Batman #237 (Dec. 1971) and was created by Denny O'Neil. The character was inspired by science- fiction writer Harlan Ellison suggesting to O'Neill that he write a story about Nazi war criminals. Created by writer Mike W. Barr, and designed by artist Alan Davis, the Judson Caspian version of Reaper first appeared in Detective Comics #575 (June 1987), the first part of the four-part Batman: Year Two storyline. After the changes in DC continuity Zero Hour established, Year Two, Joe Chill's death and the Reaper have been wiped out. Chill was back in continuity after 2005's Infinite Crisis. A character dressed as the Reaper has appeared in The New 52, a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe, but it has not been revealed which (if any) of the previous Reapers is in the costume. Fictional character biographies =Dr. Benjamin Gruener= Dr. Benjamin Gruener is a German Jew who was placed in a concentration camp run by Colonel Kurt Schloss. He kills Schloss at a Halloween parade and seemingly dies battling Batman when he falls off the edge of a dam.Batman #237 (December 1971). DC Comics. In Tony S. Daniel's \\"Batman: Life After Death\\" story arc, Reaper is \\"resurrected\\" by Hugo Strange who is working with the Black Mask to take down Batman. He is seen in an underground chamber in a glass tub, while Hugo instructs his doctors on bringing him back to life. When he regains consciousnesses, Black Mask reminds Gruener of his childhood in a concentration camp in hopes of fueling him with anger and revenge. Black Mask hands him a necklace with the Star of David on it that was given to him by his father, and then his scythe, the weapon he chose when first taking up the alias Reaper.Batman (vol. 1) #692-697 (December 2009-May 2010) Reaper is seen briefly in scenes and it is understood that he is murdering people because he wishes to bring justice to the \\"children of Gotham\\". He is fueled by his hatred toward Colonel Kurt Schloss, the Nazi who killed his parents. Reaper is then seen at Gotham Harbor demanding Hugo give him a serum that is later found to keep his skin from deteriorating. The serum is injected into him by Doctor Death. He soon attacks Mario Falcone and Huntress comes to Mario's defense, to prevent Reaper from killing him. Batman sweeps in to take out Reaper but instead he escapes by throwing gas at Batman. Batman later finds him and when he sees that Reaper's face is rotting, he asks Batman what they have done to him, Batman explains that he is only a pawn. \\"You weren't built to last, just to follow orders. The gentlemen behind you might want to explain themselves\\". he says, referring to Hugo Strange who had appeared behind him. With that, Batman leaves. =Judson Caspian= Judson Caspian is a socialite by day and a vigilante by night. After losing his wife to a robber in the streets, he becomes the Reaper who prowls Gotham City during the 1950s, targeting public menaces and murdering them with a scythe. He has a run-in with Green Lantern Alan Scott and disappears for a couple decades. After Caspian returns from Europe he renews his rampage as the Reaper, which brings him into conflict with Batman. Barely escaping with his life, Batman turns to the mob and finds himself working witn their button man Joe Chill, the man who killed his parents. Having been assigned by the Gotham mob to kill both the Reaper and Batman when he had finished, Chill hunts the Reaper alongside Batman, the two briefly assuming that the Reaper has been killed in an explosion. After revealing his identity to Chill in a confrontation in Crime Alley and putting a gun to his head, Batman's revenge is taken from him by the Reaper, who shoots Chill in the head. Batman tracks the Reaper to a construction site, they fight, Batman gains the upper hand with Reaper hanging off a ledge. Batman finally unmasks him. Batman, who had intended to marry Caspian's daughter, Rachel, is shocked, and holds out his hand to help the Reaper. However, Caspian, who knows what charges he is up against, tells Batman that he will make a fine successor, and lets go of the ledge, plummeting to his death. After being exposed as the Reaper, Caspian is given a funeral funded by Bruce Wayne, who says that he deserves to rest in peace. Rachel, who was initially unaware of her father's crimes, becomes a nun after Caspian's life as the Reaper is exposed. =Joe Chill, Jr.= In the 1991 one-shot sequel, Batman: Full Circle, Chill's son Joe Jr. briefly assumes the mantle of Reaper, as part of a plan to drive Batman insane. Chill, in collaboration with his sister Marcia, attempts to lure Batman into a confrontation, where they would finally dispose of the Dark Knight with a very different kind of weapon. Chill's schemes are hampered by the arrival of his own son, Joey, with whom Chill attempts to bond. It is revealed that Chill witnessed his father's death at the original Reaper's hands, though he could not make out Bruce Wayne's unmasked face. Overcome with grief, Chill seeks revenge on Batman by taking up the mantle of the Reaper. At the same time, Batman faces some personal issues with Rachel Caspian, who has returned to Gotham convinced the Reaper is her father reborn. Chill and his sister use this to their advantage, plaguing Rachel with a series of encounters which create doubt in her and Batman's minds that he is the returned Judson Caspian (It is also revealed in this story that Joe Chill Sr.'s body was stolen before it could be taken into custody at the end of Year Two). The Reaper uses an explosive to destroy the cornerstone of the Wayne Foundation building, freeing his father's old gun, which was used to murder Batman's parents. Batman is eventually captured by Chill, who unmasks the unconscious crime-fighter, but does not recognize him (Batman had applied extensive make up to hide his identity). Chill subjects Batman to a video reel showing a child witnessing his parents' death and showing glee at the fact that he wasn't killed, which, combined with a hallucinogenic drug, is intended to reduce Batman to a quivering wreck suffering from survivor's guilt. Chill has Batman posed at the top of a tall pedestal overlooking a pool of acid, and hopes Batman will kill himself. Marcia, who sees her father as nothing more than a thug who abused her mother, attempts to double cross her brother in order to deliver Batman to mob boss Morgan Jones. Chill slashes Marcia, apparently killing her. Robin arrives on the scene and coaxes Batman out of his hallucinogenic haze, spurring him to break free of his bonds. Batman and the Reaper fight, and Batman emerges victorious. As Batman holds the unmasked Chill over the acid pool, urged by Robin to drop him in, Chill's son Joey reveals himself and his father's identity. Deciding to act on the indecision that he faced when he had Joe Chill at his mercy years earlier, Bruce spares Chill's life. After the police arrive and Chill is taken away in an ambulance, Batman goes to a bridge and discards Joe Chill's firearm into the ocean. = The New 52 = Introduced in The New 52, The Reaper is a criminal in Gotham City who was beaten and thrown into Blackgate Penitentiary. Batman: The Dark Knight Vol 2 #1 When the Crime Syndicate arrived on Earth and killed the heroes, Bane opened up Blackgate so its prisoners would help him take back the city from the Arkham Asylum freaks who broke out earlier. Forever Evil: Arkham War 1 Reaper participated in relatively minor battles until, in Union Circle, he gets into a major clash with the Asylum inmate Firefly. Reaper almost kills Firefly, but the pyromaniac is saved by fellow lunatic Sumo, who jumps onto Reaper from a nearby building. Reaper's bones are broken, according to Sumo, by the big man's massive weight. Forever Evil: Arkham War 4 = DC Rebirth = In DC Rebirth, Judson Caspian spent his life as a crime fighter after the death of his wife and ruthlessly killed criminals. He was scorned by many people including Thomas Wayne. For unknown reasons, he moved to Europe, where his son, Julian, would leave him, before moving back to Gotham City, during Batman's earlier days with Judson once more assumed the identity of the Reaper. This led Batman to go to extreme measures to stop him including using a gun, Batman ultimately defeated and unmasked him at a construction site and found out that he was his fiancee's father. Batman tried to save him, but Caspian chose to fall to his death rather than go to jail. After his funeral, Rachel left Bruce, and they never saw each other again. Meanwhile, his son created the Reapers in order to continue his father's work around the world. In Gotham, an unrelated criminal took up the mantle of Reaper but used it to kill and rob innocent people.Detective Comics Annual 2009 Equipment As the Reaper, Caspian wears a large hooded black cloak with heavily armored red leather or cuir bouilli, which prevents bullets and punches from affecting him in any way. The knees and elbows of the red leather armor are tipped with spikes that add more power to blows Caspian inflicts. Caspian also wears a skull shaped mask with hooks on the mouth to cover up the lower part of the face, and red glowing eyes. The Reaper also wields two scythe-shaped weapons, with various other lethal implements contained in the spiked shafts of both weapons. The haft contains a very powerful handgun and smoke pellets to help give to the illusion that the Reaper is in fact an incarnation of death. The scythes are stored in two inverted sheaths located on his back, under his cloak.

Since 1994, Vietnam Human Rights Day is celebrated each year on 11 May.Pressure Mounting on Vietnam to Improve Human Rights, Epoch Times, 20 May 2013  Vietnam's report about human rights in UN human rights council  A report drafted by the Vietnamese government on 18 June 2007 for the United Nations Human Rights Council to review the implementation of human rights in the territory of Viet Nam stated: For Viet Nam, the people are both the ultimate objective and driving force of any social and economic development policy, and protecting and promoting human rights are always the Government's consistent policy. The 1992 Constitution, the supreme law of the country, guarantees that all citizens enjoy equal political, economic, cultural and social rights, and are equal before the law. Every citizen has the right to participate in the management of the State and the society, the freedoms of religion and belief, the right to free movement and residence in the territory of Viet Nam, the right to complaints and petitions, the right to employment, education and healthcare etc. regardless of gender, race and religion. On that basis, Vietnamese laws enumerate the specific rights in accordance with international human rights standards. The report argued that freedoms of expression, press and information of the Vietnamese people were clearly illustrated through the rapid and diverse development of the mass media. As of 2008, there were over 700 press agencies with 850 publications, nearly 15,000 licensed journalists, 68 radio and television stations at central and provincial levels and land- based digital TV stations, 80 e-newspapers, thousands of news websites and 55 publishers. The people of Viet Nam were provided with greater access to advanced information technology, especially the internet, with about 20 million internet users, accounting for 23.5% of the population, higher than Asia's average rate of 18%. Apart from the domestic media, the people of Viet Nam had access to dozens of foreign press agencies and television channels, including Reuters, BBC, VOA, AP, AFP, CNN and many other major international papers and magazines. The growing economy had enabled the Government to concentrate resources on such priorities as education, health, infrastructure development, human resource development, poverty reduction and assistance to underdeveloped areas. The government had promulgated and amended around 13,000 laws and by-law documents, in which civil and political rights are elaborated. The 1992 Constitution recognized fully all human rights (Articles 2 and 50). The report highlighted the rapid growth, diverse forms of mass media, belief in the lively and diverse society in Vietnam, as well as securing the rights of women, children and the disabled. It argued that thanks to the protection and promotion of human rights, Vietnam's economy, society, and culture have made great strides. But the report also acknowledged that there are still inadequacies in the country, difficulties to be solved, in which the legal system lacks uniformity and spot overlapping conflicts, not keep up with reality, leading to difficulties, misunderstandings and even affect the constitutional guarantee, the feasibility and transparency in the process of ensuring human rights. According to the Vietnamese embassy, the UN ratified Vietnam's human rights report. The embassy also stated that many of these countries appreciated Vietnam's renewal, achievements and strong commitment to fostering human rights. Also, there were some opinions against the adoption but these were rejected. According to a 1997 report by the China Internet Information Center, Vietnam has made a number of changes to its constitution, laws, and practical policies in the area of human rights since the Doi Moi, or the economic reform in 1986. For instance, the Constitution was amended in 1991 to enshrine the protection of \\"political, civil, economic, cultural and cultural rights\\" for the first time, and the penal code explicitly banned torture. Internationally, Vietnam was the second signatory of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Although Vietnam retains capital punishment, the Constitution of 1992 reduced the number of eligible crimes from 44 to 29, and over 90% of the population has access to health care. In women's rights, Vietnam ranks 2nd among Asia-Pacific countries and 9th among 135 countries in percentage of Female Parliamentarians.  Recent reports regarding human rights in Vietnam  In its 2004 report on Human Rights Practices, the U.S. State Department characterized Vietnam's human rights record as \\"poor\\" and cited the continuation of \\"serious abuses.\\" According to the report, the government has imposed restrictions on freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, and freedom of association. Recent US reports maintain the same observations and international human rights organizations that share these views include Human Rights Watch and the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization. The United Nations has highlighted religious persecution. In 2009, the European Parliament expressed concern about \\"the growing climate of intolerance in Vietnam towards human rights defenders and members of officially unrecognized religious communities.\\" It called on the government to end repression against freedom of expression, belief, and assembly, and to release its \\"political prisoners\\". The government officially provides for freedom of religion and recognizes Buddhist, Roman Catholic, Protestant, H√≤a H·∫£o, Cao ƒê√†i, and Muslim denominations. However, the government supervises the clergies of the sanctioned groups (by approving appointments, for example) in the interest of \\"national unity\\". Freedom of expression remains a problem as the Vietnamese authorities continue to use tough national security laws to punish critics of the regime. The official media remained tightly controlled by government censorship and obstruction. Restrictions on the freedom to assemble remain a problem in Vietnam. There is an effort of the government to delay issuing a law for legalizing demonstration/strike although demonstration is legal as written in Vietnam's Constitution. As of 2017, Vietnam held over 100 political prisoners for the crime of criticizing the government or participating in religions, protests, activism, or political parties not sanctioned by the government. According to Human Rights Watch, government of Vietnam is increasing its crackdown on dissidents, human rights activist and independent journalists, ahead of the 13th party congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam that will take place in January 2021. The court has also increased the prison time for dissidents serving detention. Current human-rights related dissidents In 2009, Le Cong Dinh, a lawyer who several years previously had acted for the government in a successful case against American catfish farmers, was arrested and charged with the capital crime of subversion; several of his associates were also arrested. Many Western governments condemned the move, and human rights groups alleged that the arrest was due to Le Cong Dinhs' support for freedom of speech. Amnesty International named him and his arrested associates prisoners of conscience. Vietnam currently holds several other individuals in detention whom Amnesty International considers to be prisoners of conscience: C√π Huy H√† V≈©, convicted of \\"conducting propaganda against the state\\" for giving interviews to foreign press; Nguyen Dan Que, convicted of \\"red-handed keeping and distributing documents\\" calling for the overthrow of the government; and Roman Catholic priest Nguyen Van Ly (also known as Father Thaddeus) detained for \\"spreading propaganda against the state.\\" Amnesty International has called for the immediate and unconditional release of all three men. In January 2019, the authorities of Vietnam arrested and sentenced an Australian democracy activist, Chau Van Kham, to 12 months of imprisonment on charges of ‚Äúfinancing terrorism‚Äù. The 70-year-old was arrested over his membership of pro-democracy group Viet Tan. The charges against him were claimed to be baseless and politically motivated by human rights advocates, lawyers and his family. In June 2020, The Guardian reported that the activist ‚Äúdisappeared‚Äù inside the Vietnam‚Äôs prison system for nearly four months, as his family and the Australian government have no contact or information about him. Ethnic minorities The Cham, Montagnard and Khmer Krom minorities joined together in the United Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races (FULRO), to wage war against the Vietnamese for independence during the Vietnam War. The last remaining FULRO insurgents surrendered to the United Nations in 1992. Various ethnic minority organizations like the Montagnard Foundation, Inc., International Office of Champa, and Khmers Kampuchea-Krom Federation allege that the Vietnamese people and government perpetuate human rights abuses against the Degar (Montagnards), Cham, and Khmer Krom. Vietnam has settled over a million ethnic Vietnamese on Montagnard lands in the Central Highlands. The Montagnard staged a massive protest against the Vietnamese in 2001, which led the Vietnamese to forcefully crush the uprising and seal the entire area off to foreigners. The Cham in Vietnam are only recognized as a minority, and not as an indigenous people by the Vietnamese government despite being indigenous to the region. Both Hindu and Muslim Chams have experienced religious and ethnic persecution and restrictions on their faith under the current Vietnamese government, with the Vietnamese state confiscating Cham property and forbidding Cham from observing their religious beliefs. Hindu temples were turned into tourist sites against the wishes of the Cham Hindus. In 2010 and 2013, several incidents occurred in the villages of Th√†nh T√≠n and Ph∆∞∆°c Nh∆°n, where Cham were murdered by Vietnamese. Cham Muslims in the Mekong Delta have also been economically marginalized and pushed into poverty by Vietnamese government policies, with ethnic Vietnamese Kinh settling on majority Cham lands with state support, and the religious practices of minorities have been targeted for elimination by the Vietnamese government. The Vietnamese government fears that evidence of Champa's influence over the disputed area in the South China Sea would bring attention to human rights violations and killings of ethnic minorities in Vietnam such as those which were committed in the 2001 and 2004 uprisings, and lead to the issue of Cham autonomy being brought into the dispute, since the Vietnamese conquered the Hindu and Muslim Cham people in a war in 1832, and the Vietnamese continue to destroy evidence of Cham culture and artifacts left behind, plundering or building on top of Cham temples, building farms over them, banning Cham religious practices, and omitting references to the destroyed Cham capital of Song Luy in the 1832 invasion in history books and tourist guides. The situation of the Cham compared to that of ethnic Vietnamese is substandard, with the Cham lacking water and electricity and living in houses made out of mud.

Publication history He first appeared in Batman: The Cult #1 (1988) and was created by Jim Starlin and Bernie Wrightson. Fictional character biography Deacon Blackfire is the main antagonist in the four-issue miniseries, Batman: The Cult. Blackfire is a con man and cult leader who may be over 100 years old.Batman: The Cult #3. DC Comics. He forms an army in the sewers beneath Gotham City, largely composed of the homeless. Blackfire uses this army to begin a violent war on crime, which escalates into him taking over the entire city, resulting in it being isolated from the rest of the country. Blackfire captures and brainwashes Batman, temporarily making the Caped Crusader a member of Blackfire's cult, during which Batman breaks his cardinal rule of not killing. Batman eventually breaks his conditioning, but its aftereffects make it difficult for him to capture Blackfire. After a brutal search through the sewers, Batman confronts Blackfire, who demands that Batman kill him, making him a martyr. Batman refuses, and instead savagely beats Blackfire in front of his army.

In the same issue, flashbacks are shown of the previous time Batman encountered the Deacon. The Deacon had an army of devoted homeless and underprivileged, but he also kept many of them drugged and under his control. He attempted to do the same with Batman, keeping him chained and drugged in his basement for seven days and seven nights, but the Dark Knight's resiliency led to the Deacon ordering his devotees to kill him. Batman, however, brought up the question of why Deacon Blackfire would not kill him himself, if he was as powerful as he wanted his army to believe. Batman is able to break the pipe that he is chained to, and in a reversal of their confrontation in Batman: The Cult, orders the Deacon to kill him to prove himself in front of his followers. Deacon Blackfire refuses multiple times, and his disillusioned army turns on him and appears to beat him to death.Batman: Eternal #17. DC Comics.

It was based on the show, Top of the Pops, following on from its predecessor Top of the Pops Saturday. It was shown on BBC Two at 11am on Saturdays and repeated at 6pm on the CBBC Channel on Sunday. Presenters included Fearne Cotton, Sam Nixon and Mark Rhodes. The show also regularly featured Radio 1 DJs JK & Joel. From episode twelve onwards, a new feature was introduced where digital viewers could press their red button to access a different choice of music. Richard Oliff was the first ever 'Dad-Dancer' to be featured on the show, performing to Mylo's Doctor Pressure. TOTP Saturday and TOTP Reloaded Top of the Pops Saturday began in September 2002 as part of the relaunched format of The Saturday Show, as a 45-minute show-within-a-show taking up the final section of the programme; TOTP Saturday was presented by The Saturday Shows presenters of the time, Fearne Cotton and Simon Grant. The introduction of TOTP Saturday was seen as an attempt by the BBC to combat the successful ITV Saturday morning series SMTV Live, the last hour of which was given over to music magazine CD:UK. Whereas the BBC had traditionally been dominant in the Saturday morning slot, SMTV and CD:UK were hugely successful, something which had contributed to the poor reception of the original version of The Saturday Show, and its subsequent relaunch. Following the decision to end The Saturday Show as a year-round run (and instead run it between series of Dick & Dom in da Bungalow), TOTP Saturday split off and continued as a billed show in its own right, hosted primarily by Cotton. This continued until the summer of 2005, when the programme took a break from the screen, returning in the Reloaded format in the autumn of 2005. This ran alongside the final series of Dick and Dom in da Bungalow, and both Dick & Dom... and TOTP Reloaded ended in March 2006. Shortly after the demise of ...Reloaded, the main weekly Top of the Pops also came to an end. As a result of the demise of the parent show, the Saturday morning spin-off was also decommissioned, though another spin-off series, TOTP2, continues.

The character was created by Bob Kane as an enemy of the superhero Batman, and first appeared in Detective Comics #29 (July 1939). He is notable as the first traditional supervillain to be encountered by the Batman, as well as his first supervillain foe. Fictional character biography =Golden Age= In his first appearance in Detective Comics #29, Dr. Death develops a lethal chemical agent from pollen extract and enacts a plan to use the poison to extort money from wealthy Gotham City citizens. He is assisted by a large East Indian manservant, Jabah. He decides to eliminate Batman, and threatens to kill someone unless Batman stops him. Batman defeats his two henchmen, but is wounded when Jabah shoots him, though he escapes using a gas pellet. He then gets to Dr. Death's base, meeting him in his lab, and chases him around the building. In order to evade capture, Dr. Death ignites chemicals in his laboratory, presumably killing Jabah and himself in the resulting explosion. Dr. Death next appears the following month in Detective Comics #30. With a new accomplice, a Cossack named Mikhail, Dr. Death is this time successful in claiming a victim in his extortion scheme, but discovers from the widow that the poisoned man lost his fortune in the Great Depression. Batman intervenes in the plot, following Mikhail back to Dr. Death's base, and upon apprehending the doctor, discovers that his face had been horribly disfigured from the lab explosion, resulting in a brown, skeletal appearance. The scriptwriter for Detective Comics #29 and #30 is an issue of dispute, leaving the creator of Dr. Death uncertain. Batman creator Bob Kane is officially credited as scriptwriter of these issues, though later Gardner Fox, the scriptwriter of Detective Comics #31 and #32, claimed authorship. =Bronze Age revival= After several decades' absence, Dr. Death was reintroduced by writer Gerry Conway in Batman #345 and Detective Comics #512 (1982). Conway's story is an update of the original 1939 tale. In this version, Dr. Death is depicted as a paraplegic, but his deadly gas gimmick remains the same. He is assisted this time by a manservant named Togo. =Modern Age= Dr. Death was revived once again in Batgirl #42-44 and #50 (2003‚Äì2004) by writer Dylan Horrocks. The modern version of the character is a producer of biological weapons, often selling them on the black market to terrorists and other criminals. He is now depicted as a bald, gnome-like man wearing a lab coat and an oxygen mask. This incarnation of Dr. Death plays a minor role in Batman: War Games where he is seen working with the crime lord Black Mask, releasing a gas into a crowd of panicking gangsters. Batman suspects that he and Black Mask are attempting to wipe out their competition. Batgirl #44 Dr. Death remains active in the DC Universe following the events of Infinite Crisis. In 52 #2, he is mentioned as one of many mad scientists who have gone missing. 52 #2He is depicted later in the series among other captured scientists and mad geniuses on Oolong Island that make up the Science Squad. 52 #23 He was seen joining forces with Black Mask again in Batman #692 in his \\"Ministry of Science\\". In Batman: Streets of Gotham #17-18, the reader comes to know of his backstory, involving an altercation with Thomas and Martha Wayne as well an alliance with gangster Judson Pierce and Hush. Batman: Streets of Gotham #20 =The New 52= In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, a new version of Dr. Death makes an appearance in Batman #25 as part of the story arc Batman: Zero Year. Batman Vol 2 #25 He is once again established as one of the first supervillains encountered by Batman early in his career. A disgruntled former Wayne Enterprises scientist, Dr. Death murders several people with a serum that causes uncontrolled bone growth. He is depicted with a skeletal appearance, a result of testing his serum on himself. Dr. Death joins forces with the Riddler to try to seize control of Gotham City during a super-storm. Batman Vol 2 #26 In Batman #29 (2014), it is revealed that Hellfern created his bone serum in an attempt to eliminate human weakness. This was motivated by the death of his son, a soldier who had been sent to locate the missing Bruce Wayne overseas. Dr. Death battles Batman aboard a blimp in the midst of the storm. He is struck by shrapnel from an explosion, which causes his mutated bones to begin growing again, seemingly killing him.Batman' Vol 2 #29 Other characters named Doctor Death *A different character named Doctor Death appears in Doom Patrol (vol. 1) #107 (November 1966). *In Sandman Mystery Theatre #21 (December 1994) Wesley Dodds encounters a serial killer named \\"Doctor Death\\", a.k.a.

The film introduces Corinne Calvet, and features Sam Jaffe, John Bromfield, and Kenny Washington in supporting roles.. Desert portions of the film were shot in Yuma, Arizona. Plot Hunting guide Mike Davis (Burt Lancaster) came across a cache of diamonds in a mining area located in a remote region of South West Africa. He was caught by the mine's police but refused to reveal the diamonds' location, even under torture at the hand of the diamond company's security chief, Vogel. He left South Africa for some time. Davis returns to get the diamonds which he still expects will be at the spot where he found them. The mining company's owner, Martingale (Claude Rains), tries to find out where the diamonds can be found by guile rather than force. He hires a beautiful prostitute, Suzanne Renaud (Corinne Calvet), to seduce Davis and get him to reveal the secret location. Davis plans an illegal entry into the diamond mining area to retrieve the diamonds and plans to escape to Portuguese Angola. Meanwhile, Vogel is attracted to Suzanne and offers to marry her. But Suzanne is attracted to Davis who is more interested in his diamonds than Suzanne. Davis finds the diamonds but Martingale threatens to kill Suzanne unless Davis gives him the diamonds. Davis gives up the diamonds and ends up leaving the country with Suzanne, discovering that he loves her more than the diamonds.

Paul Henreid was blacklisted from major studios at the time but says he was cast because Dieterle was an old friend of his and Hal Wallis was supportive of the actor being cast. Henreid said the role was a departure for him but \\"it had the greatest lines in the script and I had a lot of fun doing it.\\" Reception =Critical response= Film critic Glenn Erickson reflected on the background of the film and how it was received when first released, \\"A polished production on all technical levels, the gritty Rope of Sand was filmed from a screenplay purchased by producer Wallis specifically for Burt Lancaster in 1947. Although William Dieterle's direction is capable, the script works too hard to introduce an overly familiar collection of stock thriller types ... Critics generally liked Lancaster's performance, even if they slighted the work of Claude Rains and Peter Lorre and saved the bulk of their praise for Paul Henried's nasty villain.

It is on the northern edge of Sevenoaks district, adjoining its border with Dartford district, south of the village of Longfield. The M20 motorway marks the south-east boundary of the parish, and the London to Chatham railway line the north-east boundary. Brands Hatch motor racing circuit is close by. Baldwins Green Conservation Area covers part of the village and includes the church. The 12th-century parish church is dedicated to St Mary and is a Grade I listed building. The ecclesiastical parish of Fawkham is part of the united benefice of Fawkham and Hartley. Fawkham was formerly in Dartford Rural District along with the neighbouring parishes. In medieval times the parish was part of Axstane Hundred. Edward Hasted in his The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent: Volume 2(Canterbury, 1797) describes Fawkham Parish as having \\"two hamlets in it called Fawkham-green and Fawkham-street. The church stands near the northern boundary of it\\". Longfield railway station was called Fawkham Station until 1961.

As the name indicates, this farm is centrally located in and now surrounded by the City of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The farm is a National Historic Site of Canada and most buildings are protected and preserved as heritage buildings. The CEF original intent was to perform scientific research for improvement in agricultural methods and crops. While such research is still being conducted, the park-like atmosphere of the CEF has become an important place of recreation and education for the residents of Ottawa. Furthermore, over the years several other departments and agencies have encroached onto the CEF property, such as Natural Resources Canada, National Defence (HMCS Carleton on Dow's Lake), and the Ottawa Civic Hospital (helicopter pad). The CEF is bordered by the Rideau Canal (a National Historic Site as well) to the east, Prince of Wales Drive to the South-East, Baseline Road to the south, and Merivale and Fisher Roads to the west, and Carling Avenue to the north. History Overview map of the CEF The Victorian era was a time of great interest in the advancement of natural sciences and many nations built zoos, observatories, botanical gardens, and experimental farms. Canada followed suit and as the result of lobbying by John Carling, the Minister of Agriculture, and William Saunders, the first director of the research branch, the \\"Act Respecting Experimental Stations\\" came into force in 1886. The CEF started out with 188 hectares, chosen because of their proximity to Parliament Hill but (at that time) outside the city. Over the next few years the site was prepared by improving the land, building the facilities, and planting the Arboretum and forest belt. Early research projects focused only on entomology, botany, and horticulture. The Chief Dominion Architect(s) designed a number of prominent public buildings in Canada including those at the CEF: Thomas Seaton Scott (1871‚Äì1881); Thomas Fuller (architect) (1880‚Äì1897); David Ewart (1897‚Äì1914); Edgar Lewis Horwood (1914‚Äì1918); Richard Cotsman Wright (1918‚Äì1927); Thomas W.

The Horticulturalist's house and staff residences were removed by the 1930s (they were no longer needed since the city had grown around the farm), the forest belt gradually disappeared, and new larger centralized facilities were built, starting with the Saunders Building in 1935, followed by the Neatby Building, Geophysical Lab, Laboratory Services Building, and the Carling Building. From 1940-47, building 136, operated as a high frequency Naval Radio Station -CFF which frequently intercepted enemy transmissions. On May 1, 1993, a memorial was erected by NOAC and Royal Canadian Naval Association Ottawa and dedicated to the Naval Veterans and those who served at this station which provided a link during World War II between Canadian naval headquarters and ships at sea, allied naval headquarters and operational naval authorities. In 1983, the agricultural museum was created in the former Dairy Barn. The Federal Heritage Buildings Review Office recognized or classified a number of CEF buildings on the Register of the Government of Canada Heritage Buildings between 1984-1997. The Cereal Barn Building 76 was classified in 1984. The Victoria Memorial Museum was classified in 1986. The Main Dairy Barn Building 88 was classified in 1987. In 1988, the Botanical Laboratory / Horticulture Building 74 and the Sheep Showcase / Small Dairy Barn Building 95 were recognized. The Nutrition Building 59 was recognized in 1992.

It is the oldest surviving animated feature film; two earlier ones were made in Argentina by Quirino Cristiani, but they are considered lost. The Adventures of Prince Achmed features a silhouette animation technique Reiniger had invented which involved manipulated cutouts made from cardboard and thin sheets of lead under a camera. The technique she used for the camera is similar to Wayang shadow puppets, though hers were animated frame by frame, not manipulated in live action. The original prints featured color tinting. Several famous avant-garde animators worked on this film with Lotte Reiniger, among them Walter Ruttmann, Berthold Bartosch, and Carl Koch. The story is based on elements from the One Thousand and One Nights written by Hanna Diyab, including \\"Aladdin\\" and \\"The Story of Prince Ahmed and the Fairy Perƒ´-BƒÅn≈´\\". Plot An African sorcerer conjures up a flying horse, which he shows to the Caliph. When the sorcerer refuses to sell it for any amount of gold, the Caliph offers any treasure he has. The sorcerer chooses Dinarsade, the Caliph's daughter, to her great distress. Prince Achmed, Dinarsade's brother, objects, but the sorcerer persuades him to try out the horse. It carries the prince away, higher and higher into the sky, as he does not know how to control it. The Caliph has the sorcerer imprisoned. Pari Banu (center) with her attendants, preparing to bathe When Achmed discovers how to make the horse descend, he finds himself in a strange foreign land, a magical island called Wak Wak. He is greeted by a bevy of attractive maidens. When they begin fighting for his attention, he flies away to a lake. There, he watches as Pari Banu, the beautiful ruler of the land of Wak Wak, arrives with her attendants to bathe. When they spot him, they all fly away, except for Pari Banu, for Achmed has her magical flying feather costume. She flees on foot, but he captures her. He gains her trust when he returns her feathers. They fall in love. She warns him, however, that the demons of Wak Wak will try to kill him. The sorcerer frees himself from his chains. Transforming himself into a bat, he seeks out Achmed. The prince chases the sorcerer (back in human form) and falls into a pit. While Achmed fights a giant snake, the sorcerer takes Pari Banu to China and sells her to the Emperor. The sorcerer returns and pins Achmed under a boulder on top of a mountain. However, the Witch of the Flaming Mountain notices him and rescues Achmed. The sorcerer is her arch-enemy, so she helps Achmed rescue Pari Banu from the Emperor. Then the demons of Wak Wak find the couple and, despite Achmed's fierce resistance, carry Pari Banu off. Achmed forces a captive demon to fly him to Wak Wak. However, the gates of Wak Wak are locked. He then slays a monster who is attacking a boy named Aladdin. Aladdin tells of how he, a poor tailor, was recruited by the sorcerer to retrieve a magic lamp from a cave. When Aladdin returned to the cave entrance, the sorcerer demanded the lamp before letting him out. Aladdin refused, so the sorcerer sealed him in. Aladdin accidentally released one of the genies of the lamp and ordered it to take him home. He then courted and married Dinarsade. One night, Dinarsade, Aladdin's magnificent palace and the lamp disappeared. Blamed by the Caliph, Aladdin fled to avoid being executed. A storm at sea cast him ashore at Wak Wak. When he tried to pluck fruit from a \\"tree\\", it turned into a monster and grabbed him, but Achmed killed it. Achmed realizes the sorcerer had been behind this and is further enraged. He reveals to Aladdin that his palace and the lamp were stolen by the sorcerer because of his obsession for Dinarsade. Then the witch arrives. Since only the lamp can open the gates, she agrees to attack the sorcerer to get it. They engage in a magical duel, each transforming into various creatures. After a while, they resume their human forms and fling fireballs at each other. Finally, the witch slays the sorcerer. With the lamp, they are able to enter Wak Wak, just in time to save Pari Banu from being thrown to her death. A fierce battle erupts. A demon steals the lamp, but the witch gets it back. She summons creatures from the lamp who defeat the demons. One hydra-like creature seizes Pari Banu. When Achmed cuts off one of its heads, two more grow back immediately, but the witch stops this regeneration, allowing Achmed to kill it. A flying palace then settles to the ground. Inside, Aladdin finds Dinarsade and Dinasade reunites with her brother. The two couples bid goodbye to the witch and fly home in the palace. Production Reiniger required several years, from 1923 to 1926, to make this film. Each frame had to be painstakingly filmed, and 24 frames were needed per second. Restoration No original German nitrate prints of the film are known to still exist. While the original film featured color tinting, prints available just before the restoration had all been in black and white. Working from surviving nitrate prints, German and British archivists restored the film during 1998 and 1999, including reinstating the original tinted image by using the Desmet method.  Availability  The film is screened fairly often on Turner Classic Movies. Before shuttering in November 2018, the film was available to stream through the subscription-based FilmStruck. Filmstruck's follow up service, Criterion Channel, a service from the Criterion Collection, now streams it in Region 1. English-market DVDs are available, distributed by Milestone Films and available in NTSC R1 (from Image) and PAL R2 (from the BFI). Both versions of the DVD are identical. They feature both an English-subtitled version (the intertitles are in German) and an English voice-over. The English-subtitled film is available via Fandor and LiveTree.  Legacy  A homage to this film can be spotted in Disney's Aladdin (1992); a character named Prince Achmed has a minor role in the film. The art style also served as inspiration for the Steven Universe episode \\"The Answer\\". Score The original score was composed by German composer Wolfgang Zeller in direct collaboration with the animation of the film. Reiniger created photograms for the orchestras, which were common in better theatres of the time, to follow along the action. =Contemporary Scorings= * The Silk Road Ensemble accompanied the film with a live improvised performance on Western strings and instruments such as the oud, ney and sheng in October 2006 at the Rubin Museum of Art in New York, NY.

Set up in 1822, the partners became interested in the production of steam locomotives after the Rainhill Trials. The company's first engine was Union, a vertical boiler, with horizontal cylinders for the Bolton and Leigh Railway of which Hick and Rothwell were promoters and original shareholders, followed by three more locomotives the following year for American railways. Rothwell and Company In 1832, Benjamin Hick left to set up his own business, B. Hick and Sons, to be replaced by Benjamin Cubitt, (younger brother of William Cubitt) from Fenton, Murray and Jackson. The firm then became Rothwell and Company. A further order for America was fulfilled in 1833, then for a couple of years the firm was occupied with pumps and stationary engines. Locomotives, steam engines and cranes =1820s= About 1827 the company supplied three steam engines to Andr√© Koechlin & Cie in France, one for the Mulhouse cotton mill for which Sharp, Roberts and Co. supplied most of the equipment, one for coal mines at Ronchamp, and one for the Bourcart factory. Hick attended at least two of these installations in person during 1827. A 1:10 scale model of a double jib crane designed by Benjamin Hick is displayed at the Musee des Arts et Metiers. =1830s= From 1836 steam locomotives became their main business. Up to 1840 they produced 56, 28 of which went abroad. Of note is a for the South Carolina Railroad to the design of Horatio Allen. This had drivers, with a swivelling front bogie, and reputed to have worked for 35 years. A deal of sub-contract work came from Edward Bury and Company. =1840s= From 1841, the company began a batch of engines for the broad gauge Great Western Railway. The largest order came in 1847 for 28 engines for the London and South Western Railway. =1850s= Possibly the most remarkable were some 4-2-4 engines for the Bristol and Exeter Railway built in 1853/4 with unflanged driving wheels, and two ball-and-socket swivelled bogies. They weighed 42 tons and achieved speeds of , the fastest engines of the time. The quality of the company's products brought in repeat orders. Many of the engines were still in service twenty years later. From 1857 the engines were to Alexander Allan's design and were similar to the Old Crewe type. These were sold to the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway and the Eastern Counties Railway. The last to be built were four broad gauge engines for the Bristol and Exeter Railway and two saddle tanks for the Carmarthen and Cardigan Railway. Closure In the face of reduced business and increasing competition, the company closed in 1864. Part of the works was taken over by the Bolton Iron and Steel Company, which was later absorbed by Henry Bessemer and Company in 1906.

Originally built as a boat works, it became notable as a night club in the now-defunct Sunnyside Amusement Park, hosting many prominent 'big band' jazz bands. Since the Park's demolition, the building has ceased to be a nightclub, being used for special occasions and concerts. It has recently been remodeled and is in use for special occasions and meetings. History Dean's Boat Works, 1911 In the 1900s and 1910s, the Sunnyside area was undeveloped except for a few waterfront uses. One waterfront business was Dean's Boat House, building canoes, renting boats and providing local boat cruises, located on Lake Shore Road at Queen Street, south-east of High Park. Starting in the 1910s, the waterfront was redeveloped by the Toronto Harbour Commission and all of the waterfront buildings were removed. The waterfront was extended to the south and new buildings were constructed to replace those removed. The new Dean's Sunnyside Pleasure Boats, a canoe boat-building factory and a supplier to the local Parkdale canoe club was opened in 1922 as part of the new Sunnyside Beach. The new building was designed by the architectural firm of Chapman, Oxley & Bishop, architects who designed the Sunnyside Bathing Pavilion, which opened that same year nearby. The boat-building activities occupied the basement and part of the first floor, which was at shoreline level. The second floor, at ground level from the front, became a dance hall. Although Dean's Pleasure Boats was successful for some time, it eventually went out of business and the Palais became a dance hall only.Filey (1981), p. 62-63 Palais Royale, circa 1930 In 1932 Bill Cuthbert and George Deller took over the Palais Royale and this was the period of its greatest popularity. 'Big bands' such as Duke Ellington and Count Basie, Paul Whiteman and the Dorsey Brothers played there.Toronto Historical Board Plaque, 1985 The largest audience was in 1933, when 3000 people danced to Eddie Duchin's Park Central Orchestra from New York. From 1933 to 1950, Bert Niosi \\"Canada's King of Swing\\" and his orchestra were the house band. Admission was 10 cents plus five cents a dance. Only soft drinks were available and certain dances, such as the jitterbug, were forbidden as they were considered too risqu√©. Dances were held six nights a week (dancing was not allowed on Sundays). The land on which the Palais Royale was built was originally leased from the Toronto Harbour Commission in 1922 for 21 years. Cuthbert and Deller renewed the lease in 1944 for another 21 years.1944 lease, Toronto Harbour Commission Archives RG12/3/3950 They sold their rights to Joe Broderick in 1949. Broderick operated the facility as a dance hall from 1949 to 1966. =1955‚Äìpresent: After the Amusement Park= In 1955, Sunnyside Amusement Park was demolished for the Gardiner Expressway and Lake Shore Boulevard expansions. In the period 1956-1959 the hall lost money, but Broderick was showing profits again by 1964.Joe Broderick to George A Wilson, Toronto Harbour Commission, September 28, 1964, Toronto Harbour Commission Archives, RG313, Box 363, Folder 17 Broderick attempted to negotiate a further lease in 1965 but he was not successful and he sold his rights to the Polish National Union in January 1966. By this time the land had been transferred to the City of Toronto, which had placed the Palais Royale on its list of properties for demolition in 1965. It was then that the City removed the hall's east-side parking lot, formerly the mini-golf course, planting grass and willow trees. However, instead of being demolished, the property was instead designated as a historic site by the City in 1974.City of Toronto Minutes 1982, Appendix A, page 523 Since then, the hall has been used for concerts by a diverse range of musicians. From Stan Kenton, Benny Louis, Woody Herman, The Carlton Show Band, The Specials, Joe Jackson and Rough Trade around 1980 to concerts by Blur, Blue Rodeo, Sigur R√≥s, Echo & the Bunnymen, The Sadies, Constantines, Sloan and a The Rolling Stones concert on August 16, 2002. The building was a film location for the 1990 film \\"Queen of Mean\\". On June 18, 1986, the City of Toronto attempted to buy out the lease for the Palais Royale for $82,500, the price at which the property was valued in 1922. The Polish National Union claimed it had spent $236,697 on repairs to the building and refused the offer.City of Toronto Minutes, 1987, Executive Committee Report no. 8, pg. 4521 In June 1987, the City began legal action to retain control of the property, a process which ended with a decision by the Ontario Court of Appeal on March 28, 1994 which terminated the lease on April 16, 1999.City of Toronto Minutes, 1994, Executive Committee Report 13, pg. 45 In 1988 a feature film entitled Palais Royale was released, set and filmed in the nightclub. The Property was leased to Shoreline Entertainment in 2000, on the condition that repairs and renovations be made to the hall. Shoreline transferred the lease to the Pegasus Group in 2005.Toronto Staff Report, May 18, 2005 The Group spent $3.5 million on renovations, gutting the interior, replacing the windows and rebuilding the rear terrace. Described by Den Farnworth of Goldsmith Borgal Architects as \\"it's not a true restoration, it's more an adaptive reuse\\", the renovations attracted some controversy. In September 2006, the Palais Royale hosted its official Grand Re-Opening, and the house band for the evening was the stellar Toronto All-Star Big Band, composed of young performers from around Ontario. This band is reminiscent of the Goodman, Miller, and Shaw era of swinging dance tunes and is fronted by one of Toronto's finest vocal groups, the TABB-5. =Controversies= View of Palais and median parking lot, 2007 Critics of the renovation denounced the new design for its destruction of major architectural elements and inept approximation of historical stylings. Detractors claim the new design uses many contemporary elements which are anachronistic on a building of the Art Deco era. Supporters tout the security of its contemporized design, one more likely to attract paying customers and ensure future maintenance, and ultimately, the existence of the structure. In addition to the design controversy, a controversy erupted over the restoration of the facility's parking lot, which was removed in 1965 City of Toronto Minutes, 1966, Appendix A, Parks and Recreation Report no. 11, pp. 2237-2239 and replaced by grass and willow trees, which had grown to mature height in the meantime. Local groups opposed the removal of the trees to repave the parking lot and opposed paving a new parking lot, proposing on-street parking. After public consultations, the City of Toronto has since paved a new parking lot for the hall across the street on former Amusement Park lands between the east and west lanes of Lake Shore Boulevard, and provided a set of stoplights for customers to cross the street to the hall, but preserving the willow trees of the old lot. Redevelopment plans for the waterfront area include the relocation of Lake Shore Boulevard and the parking lots north, against the Gardiner right-of-way, freeing up park lands along the water.

Early years  Agnethe was born in 1947 to mother Agathe Lund and father Villy Wael (1928-98), but she was raised by her grandmother. At 16, she met her future husband, the blacksmith Aqqaluartaaq Davidsen, whom she married in 1966, and they had two children, S√∏ren (1965) and Heidi (1967). In 1969, seeking more education, she took the children to Ikast, Denmark and graduated in 1970 with a \\"trade degree in commerce and office.\\" After returning to Greenland, she began working in the national court system in Nuuk. In 1979, she began her work as a circuit judge in the Nuuk district court, a position she held 1979-1983 and again 1989-1993.  Political life  In 1983, Davidsen was appointed to the Parliament (Landsting) as substitute for Hans Pavia Rosing, representing the social democrat-oriented Forward (Siumut) party. Later that year, she was appointed Member of Parliament for social affairs (a position similar to a governmental minister), thereby becoming the first female member of the Landsstyret. In 1989, she was elected to the city council of Nuuk, again under the banner of the Forward party, and between 1989 and 1991 held the position of second vice mayor. After the election of 1991, she was appointed first vice mayor, and in 1993 she became presiding officer of the city council and the mayor of the city. Davidsen was only second female mayor of the capital city after Laannguaq Lynge, who occupied the post 1991-1993. In 1997, Davidsen was inducted by Queen Margrethe II of Denmark into the Order of the Dannebrog. In that year she resigned from political life in Greenland so she could work full-time in Nuuk politics. She was a vocal advocate for hosting the 2002 Arctic Winter Games, which were held in both Nuuk and in Iqaluit, Canada. In 2004 Davidsen played herself as the mayor in the 58-minute documentary film, \\"Dronningen og prinsen med Frederik og Mary i Gr√∏nland\\" (The Queen and Prince with Frederick and Mary in Greenland). In April 2005, voters returned Davidsen to the mayor's office in Nuuk defeating then deputy mayor, Per Berthelsen, by 2.7 percent of the vote. She died suddenly in 2007 of a brain hemorrhage while serving as mayor.

The last years of Spain under Franco were shattered by a generation of singers that claimed and called for democracy. In this context, La Nova Can√ß√≥ is the protest song musical and political movement of artists singing in Catalan, like Llu√≠s Llach, Raimon or Ovidi Montllor. In the late 1960s and during the 1970s, the Nova Can√ß√≥ movement introduced lyrics in Catalan in contemporary music in order to reach wider audiences (until then, this language was only used in folk songs); then, by the 1980s and the return to democracy in Spain, their popularity was waning. Then, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Generalitat de Catalunya, in the absence of a wide enough demand, offered grants for rock bands singing in Catalan. This made possible the formation of several bands singing in Catalan and, with them, the introduction of the then innovative concept of a rock music scene in Catalan. The musical styles are diverse within the movement, being sole relation between these bands the use of the Catalan language in their lyrics.

Often referred to simply as 'The Brig' (Scots for 'bridge'). The village grew up on the south bank of an important crossing of the River Earn, whose sandstone bridge existed from at least the early 14th century, when it is known to have been repaired by order of King Robert I of Scotland (1306‚Äì1329) (site: NO 133 185). Substantial remains of the medieval bridge (rendered redundant by a replacement, still in use, slightly upstream in 1821-22) survived into the 1970s, when almost all the stonework was demolished, for (allegedly) being in a dangerously ruinous condition. This ancient bridge was a major landmark on the road between Edinburgh ( south) and Perth ( north) for several centuries. The village's oldest houses are to be found lining the road (Back Street/Old Edinburgh Road) leading south from the site of the demolished bridge. Among them are some with 18th-century datestones. The ruined Old Bridge of Earn (and part of the village) are featured in the 1857 painting Sir Isumbras at the Ford by John Everett Millais (1829‚Äì1896), who often stayed at nearby Perth. There is also an early 19th-century lithograph showing the structure as complete in Sketches of Scenery in Perthshire by David Octavius Hill (1802‚Äì1870). History Bridge of Earn is the main village in the parish of Dunbarney (sometimes Dumbarney in older documents). The place-name is of uncertain (though probably Gaelic) origin, and may contain the element druim, 'ridge, spine'. The ancient ecclesiastical focus of the parish was not within the present village, but about 1.5 km to the west at NO 113 190. The site of the medieval parish church is marked by a walled burial ground a little south of the River Earn. There are no visible remains of the medieval building (or of the medieval village that is said to have adjoined it to the south), but the churchyard contains an interesting collection of 18th-century headstones carved with symbols of mortality, trades etc. In 1689 the church was rebuilt much nearer to the Bridge, by then the main focus of settlement in the parish, at NO 130 185. In 1787 the church was rebuilt yet again, using the same stones, on its present site just to the east of the second, which also became a graveyard. The present congregation is a large and flourishing one, and a modern hall and kitchen has been built adjoining the church in recent years. The parish has recently been merged with Forgandenny, its neighbouring village to the west. The remains of two medieval chapels survive in Dunbarney parish, in the grounds of Moncrieffe Estate (originally a private chapel of the Moncrieffe family, now their burial vault), and at Ecclesiamagirdle (pronounced 'Exmagirdle'), a site of probably early Christian origin adjoining Ecclesiamagirdle House (early 17th century) on the Glenearn Estate below the Ochil Hills. It is sometimes suggested that the latter was a parish church in its own right up to the Reformation (1559), though there seems to be no conclusive documentation on this point. The small surviving late medieval building (roofless but largely complete) might seem too modest in size to have served as a parish church. The surrounding graveyard contains several well- preserved gravestones from the 17th and 18th centuries, which are interesting examples of 'folk art'. The parish of Dunbarney was very much part of the traditional agricultural economy of lowland Scotland up to the late 19th century, with most of the inhabitants engaged in agriculture or associated rural crafts. The traffic on the main north road from Edinburgh also gave a certain scope for the inn and hotel trade to accommodate travellers. From the late 18th century the spa (now closed) at Pitkeathly Wells became an important economic focus, with large numbers of visitors resorting to the parish to 'take the waters'. During the 19th century the coming of the railway to the village and the building of a station (closed in the 1960s) provided a further source of local employment, with much local produce being moved out by rail. Bridge of Earn has had two railway stations, the second and most recent having closed on 15 June 1964, when the Bridge of Earn to Mawcarse line was closed down. Bridge of Earn's original station had been located a few hundred yards further east when the existing line first opened on 18 July 1848. This station was closed on 1 February 1892, not as a consequence of economic cutbacks, but rather as a consequence of expansion. The Bridge of Earn to Mawcarse line, which followed closely to the route of the current M90 motorway southwards towards Balmanno Hill, before cutting right through the heart of it via the two tunnels which still exist today, opened to passengers on 1 June 1890. It made logistical sense to move Bridge of Earn's station to a better position to accommodate this new junction and so the original station was replaced. Salmon fishing on the Earn (a major tributary of the Tay), was also long an important source of income, though since the late 20th century commercial net fishing on both rivers has died out (sport fishing continues in season). Since the Second World War, Bridge of Earn has increasingly become a dormitory town for families whose wage-earners commute to Perth, Dundee, Edinburgh or other large towns, and this has led to a great expansion in the numbers of homes being built, and a corresponding increase in the number of local shops and services. Expansion Bridge of Earn, and the formerly neighbouring but now conjoined village of Kintillo, have expanded out of all recognition since the 1960s, with hundreds of new homes being built. An entire new settlement called Oudenarde--named for the Flemish town of Oudenaarde--is currently being built on the site of the large former hospital (NO 142 181) to the east of the old village. The financial crisis of 2012 caused a temporary halt in construction, though the project later resumed, with the approach roads under construction as of June 2015. Bridge of Earn's proximity to Perth, and convenient transport links to Edinburgh and Dundee, make it a desirable 'dormitory' town, though its second and most recent railway station was closed on 15 June 1964, following the Beeching reforms of the 1960s. Sport The local football teams including Bridge of Earn AFC and Dunbarney Rovers AFC teams play their games at Victory Park. The local Bridge of Earn Bowling Club on Main Street is the one of the oldest (founded in 1859 on land leased to the village by Sir Thomas Moncreiffe) and largest sports clubs in the village. Facilities Apart from the parish church and the primary school, the facilities in the village include three parks (Victory, Balmanno & Kintillo), a bowling club, tennis courts, Moncreiffe nursing home, three pubs (Last Cast, Cypress Inn & Village Inn), two restaurants (Village Inn & The Roost), a dentist, a GP surgery, Used car dealership/ garage (Cargill's Auto Repairs) and several shops including The Co-operative Food supermarket, a newsagents (S&V; Newsagents), a bakery (Tower Bakery), two hairdressers (Tanya Black's & Little Hair Company), beauty salon (The Retreat), a Chinese takeaway (Wok In) and a small family run Indian restaurant and takeaway. (The Spice Garden above the Village Inn). There are also self-catering holiday lodges in Bridge of Earn by the banks of the River Earn (River Edge Lodges). The spa at the neighbouring hamlet ( west) of Pitkeathly Wells was formerly well-known and popular as a health and social resort, but was closed in 1949. Until 1964, Bridge of Earn had a railway station opened by the North British Railway Education The village school is Dunbarney Primary School (run by Perth and Kinross Council), which was extended and modernised in 1996. Dunbarney Primary School is a feeder school for Secondary Bertha Park High School in the north of Perth, Scotland. The Carloways, an upcoming band were classmates at Dunbarney Primary School. The band have toured Scotland for over 4 years and have played as Alex Salmond's house band on his Edinburgh fringe tour and Scottish nationwide tour. The Carloways have played at Belladrum tartan heart festival for the past 4 years and released their well-received debut EP in July 2018. The band intend to record their debut album in 2018 or early 2019. On the south west outskirts of the village, there is the independent Kilgraston School, which is centred upon a mansion house built around 1800 by Francis Grant of Glenlochy. Estates Local estates that surround the village (none of whose houses are open to the public) include Moncreiffe House (the seat of the ancient family of Moncrieffe), Glenearn House (with early 17th century Ecclesiamagirdle House in its grounds), and Dunbarney House. Hospital Bridge of Earn Hospital was established as an Emergency Hospital Service facility in 1939. It finally closed in 1992.

The RDF data-model mapping enables its use for embedding RDF subject-predicate-object expressions within XHTML documents. It also enables the extraction of RDF model triples by compliant user agents. The RDFa community runs a wiki website to host tools, examples, and tutorials.  History  RDFa was first proposed by Mark Birbeck in the form of a W3C note entitled XHTML and RDF, which was then presented to the Semantic Web Interest Group at the W3C's 2004 Technical Plenary. Later that year the work became part of the sixth public Working Draft of XHTML 2.0. Although it is generally assumed that RDFa was originally intended only for XHTML 2, in fact the purpose of RDFa was always to provide a way to add a metadata to any XML-based language. Indeed, one of the earliest documents bearing the RDF/A Syntax name has the sub-title A collection of attributes for layering RDF on XML languages. The document was written by Mark Birbeck and Steven Pemberton, and was made available for discussion on October 11, 2004. In April 2007 the XHTML 2 Working Group produced a module to support RDF annotation within the XHTML 1 family. As an example, it included an extended version of XHTML 1.1 dubbed XHTML+RDFa 1.0. Although described as not representing an intended direction in terms of a formal markup language from the W3C, limited use of the XHTML+RDFa 1.0 DTD did subsequently appear on the public Web.For examples of this, see: October 2007 saw the first public Working Draft of a document entitled RDFa in XHTML: Syntax and Processing. This superseded and expanded upon the April draft; it contained rules for creating an RDFa parser, as well as guidelines for organizations wishing to make practical use of the technology. In October 2008 RDFa 1.0 reached recommendation status. RDFa 1.1 reached recommendation status in June 2012. It differs from RDFa 1.0 in that it no longer relies on the XML-specific namespace mechanism. Therefore, it is possible to use RDFa 1.1 with non-XML document types such as HTML 4 or HTML 5. Details can be found in an appendix to HTML 5. An additional RDFa 1.1 Primer document was last updated 17 March 2015. (The first public Working Draft dates back to 10 March 2006.) Versions and variants  There are some main well-defined variants of the basic concepts, that are used as reference and as abbreviation to the W3C standards. = HTML+RDFa = RDFa was defined in 2008 with the \\"RDFa in XHTML: Syntax and Processing\\" Recommendation.\\"RDFa in XHTML: Syntax and Processing - A collection of attributes and processing rules for extending XHTML to support RDF\\", W3C Recommendation 14 October 2008. http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-rdfa- syntax-20081014/ Its first application was to be a module of XHTML. The HTML applications remained, \\"a collection of attributes and processing rules for extending XHTML to support RDF\\" expanded to HTML5, are now expressed in a specialized standard, the \\"HTML+RDFa\\" (the last is \\"HTML+RDFa 1.1 - Support for RDFa in HTML4 and HTML5\\"\\"HTML+RDFa 1.1 - Support for RDFa in HTML4 and HTML5\\", W3C Recommendation 22 August 2013. http://www.w3.org/TR/html-rdfa/). = RDFa 1.0 = The \\"HTML+RDFa\\" syntax of 2008 was also termed \\"RDFa 1.0\\", so, there are no \\"RDFa Core 1.0\\" standard. In general this 2008's RDFa 1.0 is used with the old XHTML standards (as long as RDFa 1.1 is used with XHTML5 and HTML5). = RDFa 1.1 = Is the first generic (for HTML and XML) RDFa standard, now (2015) the \\"RDFa Core 1.1\\" is in the Third Edition.\\"RDFa Core 1.1 - Third Edition - Syntax and processing rules for embedding RDF through attribute\\", W3C Recommendation 17 March 2015. https://www.w3.org/TR/2015/REC- rdfa-core-20150317/ =RDFa Lite = Is a W3C Recommendation (1.0 and 1.1) since 2009,first draft 1.1 cite ~2009 as ~year of \\"RDFa Lite 1.0\\"... Please check better reference. as \\"a minimal subset of RDFa, the Resource Description Framework in attributes, consisting of a few attributes that may be used to express machine-readable data in Web documents like HTML, SVG, and XML. While it is not a complete solution for advanced data markup tasks, it does work for most day-to-day needs and can be learned by most Web authors in a day\\".\\"RDFa Lite 1.1\\", W3C Recommendation 07 June 2012. http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-lite/ (second edition at 2015) In 2009 the W3C was positionedFinal W3C position (ISSUE-76), establishing that Microdata syntax simply duplicates what RDFa Lite already does. to retain RDFa Lite as unique and definitive standard alternative to Microdata. The position was confirmed with the publication of the HTML5 Recommendation in 2014. Essence The essence of RDFa is to provide a set of attributes that can be used to carry metadata in an XML language (hence the 'a' in RDFa). These attributes are: ; : a URI or CURIE specifying the resource the metadata is about ; and : specifying a relationship and reverse-relationship with another resource, respectively ; , and : specifying the partner resource ; : specifying a property for the content of an element or the partner resource ; : optional attribute that overrides the content of the element when using the property attribute ; : optional attribute that specifies the datatype of text specified for use with the property attribute ; : optional attribute that specifies the RDF type(s) of the subject or the partner resource (the resource that the metadata is about). Benefits There are five \\"principles of interoperable metadata\\" met by RDFa.Building Interoperable Web Metadata * Publisher Independence ‚Äì each site can use its own standards * Data Reuse ‚Äì data are not duplicated. Separate XML and HTML sections are not required for the same content. * Self Containment ‚Äì the HTML and the RDF are separated * Schema Modularity ‚Äì the attributes are reusable Additionally RDFa may benefit web accessibility as more information is available to assistive technology. Usage  There is a growing number of tools for better usage of RDFa vocabularies and RDFa annotation. = HTML+RDFa statistics = 2013 survey pizza charts of percentual usage, showing that 79% of URLs and 43% of domains use HTML+RDFa. The average 61% (the other 39% was Microformats) is the usage indicator. The simplified approaches to semantically annotate information items in webpages were greatly encouraged by the HTML+RDFa (released in 2008) and Microformats (since ~2005) standards. these standards were encoding events, contact information, products, and so on. Despite the vCard semantics (only basic items of person and organization annotations) dominance, and some cloning of annotations along the same domain, the counting of webpages (URLs) and domains with annotations is an important statistical indicator for usage of semantically annotated information in the Web. The statistics of 2017 show that usage of HTML+RDFa is now less than that of Microformats. = RDFa editors = ;Web-based RDFa editors: There are already a few RDFa editors available online. RDFaCE (RDFa Content Editor) is a WYSIWYM editor based on TinyMCE to support RDFa content authoring. It supports manual and semi- automatic generation of RDFa with the support of annotation services such as DBpedia Spotlight, OpenCalais, Alchemy API, among others. RDFaCE-Lite is a version of RDFaCE also supporting Microdata and available as a WordPress plugin. ;Desktop RDFa editors: Aut√¥Meta is an environment for semi-automatic (or automatic) annotation of documents for publishing on the Web using RDFa. It also includes a RDFa extraction tool to provide the user with a view of the annotated triples. It is available in both CLI and GUI interfaces. =Examples= The following is an example of adding Dublin Core metadata to an XML element in an XHTML file. Dublin Core data elements are data typically added to a book or article (title, author, subject etc.) Wikinomics Don Tapscott 2006-10-01 Moreover, RDFa allows the passages and words within a text to be associated with semantic markup: In his latest book Wikinomics, Don Tapscott explains deep changes in technology, demographics and business. The book is due to be published in October 2006. XHTML + RDFa 1.0 The following is an example of a complete XHTML+RDFa 1.0 document. It uses Dublin Core and FOAF, an ontology for describing people and their relationships with other people and things: # John's Home Page My name is John D and I like [Einst√ºrzende Neubauten](http://www.neubauten.org/). My favorite book is the inspiring Weaving the Web by Tim Berners-Lee. In the example above, the document URI can be seen as representing an HTML document, but the document URI plus the \\"#me\\" string \`http://example.org/john-d/#me\` represents the actual person, as distinct from a document about them. The foaf:primaryTopic in the header tells us a URI of the person the document is about. The foaf:nick property (in the first \`span\` element) contains a nickname for this person, and the dc:creator property (in the \`meta\` element) tells us who created the document. The hyperlink to the Einst√ºrzende Neubauten website contains \`rel=\\"foaf:interest\\"\`, suggesting that John Doe is interested in this band. The URI of their website is a resource. The foaf:interest inside the second \`p\` element is referring to a book by ISBN number. The \`resource\` attribute defines a resource in a similar way to the \`href\` attribute, but without defining a hyperlink. Further into the paragraph, a \`span\` element containing an \`about\` attribute defines the book as another resource to specify metadata about. The book title and author are defined within the contents of this tag using the dc:title and dc:creator properties. Here are the same triples when the above document is automatically converted to RDF/XML: Jonathan Doe John D Tim Berners-Lee Weaving the Web HTML5 + RDFa 1.1  The above example can be expressed without XML namespaces in HTML5: # John's Home Page My name is John D and I like [Einst√ºrzende Neubauten](http://www.neubauten.org/). My favorite book is the inspiring Weaving the Web by Tim Berners-Lee. Note how the prefix foaf is still used without declaration. RDFa 1.1 automatically includes prefixes for popular vocabularies such as FOAF. The minimal \\"Example of an HTML+RDFa 1.1 document\\" at http://www.w3.org/TR/html- rdfa/#document-conformance document is: Welcome to my [blog](http://example.org/).

A controversial interpretation holds that the Battle of Point Pleasant on October 10, 1774 in what is now West Virginia was the initial military engagement of the Revolutionary War, and a 1908 United States Senate resolution designating it as such. However, few historians subscribe to this interpretation, even in West Virginia. The battles were fought on April 19, 1775 in Middlesex County, Province of Massachusetts Bay, within the towns of Lexington, Concord, Lincoln, Menotomy (present-day Arlington), and Cambridge. They marked the outbreak of armed conflict between the Kingdom of Great Britain and its thirteen colonies in America. In late 1774, Colonial leaders adopted the Suffolk Resolves in resistance to the alterations made to the Massachusetts colonial government by the British parliament following the Boston Tea Party. The colonial assembly responded by forming a Patriot provisional government known as the Massachusetts Provincial Congress and calling for local militias to train for possible hostilities. The Colonial government exercised effective control of the colony outside of British-controlled Boston. In response, the British government in February 1775 declared Massachusetts to be in a state of rebellion. About 700 British Army regulars in Boston, under Lieutenant Colonel Francis Smith, were given secret orders to capture and destroy Colonial military supplies reportedly stored by the Massachusetts militia at Concord. Through effective intelligence gathering, Patriot leaders had received word weeks before the expedition that their supplies might be at risk and had moved most of them to other locations. On the night before the battle, warning of the British expedition had been rapidly sent from Boston to militias in the area by several riders, including Paul Revere and Samuel Prescott, with information about British plans. The initial mode of the Army's arrival by water was signaled from the Old North Church in Boston to Charlestown using lanterns to communicate \\"one if by land, two if by sea\\". The first shots were fired just as the sun was rising at Lexington. Eight militiamen were killed, including Ensign Robert Munroe, their third in command. The British suffered only one casualty. The militia were outnumbered and fell back, and the regulars proceeded on to Concord, where they broke apart into companies to search for the supplies. At the North Bridge in Concord, approximately 400 militiamen engaged 100 regulars from three companies of the King's troops at about 11:00am, resulting in casualties on both sides. The outnumbered regulars fell back from the bridge and rejoined the main body of British forces in Concord. The British forces began their return march to Boston after completing their search for military supplies, and more militiamen continued to arrive from the neighboring towns. Gunfire erupted again between the two sides and continued throughout the day as the regulars marched back towards Boston. Upon returning to Lexington, Lt. Col. Smith's expedition was rescued by reinforcements under Brigadier General Hugh Percy, a future duke of Northumberland styled at this time by the courtesy title Earl Percy. The combined force of about 1,700 men marched back to Boston under heavy fire in a tactical withdrawal and eventually reached the safety of Charlestown. The accumulated militias then blockaded the narrow land accesses to Charlestown and Boston, starting the Siege of Boston. Ralph Waldo Emerson describes the first shot fired by the Patriots at the North Bridge in his \\"Concord Hymn\\" as the \\"shot heard round the world\\".Emerson's Concord Hymn  Background  Thomas Gage The British Army's infantry was nicknamed \\"redcoats\\" and sometimes \\"devils\\" by the colonists. They had occupied Boston since 1768 and had been augmented by naval forces and marines to enforce what the colonists called The Intolerable Acts, which had been passed by the British Parliament to punish the Province of Massachusetts Bay for the Boston Tea Party and other acts of protest. General Thomas Gage was the military governor of Massachusetts and commander-in-chief of the roughly 3,000 British military forces garrisoned in Boston. He had no control over Massachusetts outside of Boston, however, where implementation of the Acts had increased tensions between the Patriot Whig majority and the pro-British Tory minority. Gage's plan was to avoid conflict by removing military supplies from Whig militias using small, secret, and rapid strikes. This struggle for supplies led to one British success and several Patriot successes in a series of nearly bloodless conflicts known as the Powder Alarms. Gage considered himself to be a friend of liberty and attempted to separate his duties as governor of the colony and as general of an occupying force. Edmund Burke described Gage's conflicted relationship with Massachusetts by saying in Parliament, \\"An Englishman is the unfittest person on Earth to argue another Englishman into slavery.\\"Fischer, p. 30 The colonists had been forming militias since the very beginnings of Colonial settlement for the purpose of defense against Indian attacks. These forces also saw action in the French and Indian War between 1754 and 1763 when they fought alongside British regulars. Under the laws of each New England colony, all towns were obligated to form militia companies composed of all males 16 years of age and older (there were exemptions for some categories), and to ensure that the members were properly armed. The Massachusetts militias were formally under the jurisdiction of the provincial government, but militia companies throughout New England elected their own officers.Fred Anderson, A People's Army, and John Shy, \\"A New Look at Colonial Militias\\", pp. 29‚Äì41 Gage effectively dissolved the provincial government under the terms of the Massachusetts Government Act, and these existing connections were employed by the colonists under the Massachusetts Provincial Congress for the purpose of resistance to the military threat from Britain.Fischer, p. 51 = British government preparations = A February 1775 address to King George III, by both houses of Parliament, declared that a state of rebellion existed: On April 14, 1775, Gage received instructions from Secretary of State William Legge, Earl of Dartmouth, to disarm the rebels and to imprison the rebellion's leaders, but Dartmouth gave Gage considerable discretion in his commands.Fischer, pp. 75‚Äì76 Gage's decision to act promptly may have been influenced by information he received on April 15, from a spy within the Provincial Congress, telling him that although the Congress was still divided on the need for armed resistance, delegates were being sent to the other New England colonies to see if they would cooperate in raising a New England army of 18,000 colonial soldiers.French, pp.23-28. Francis Smith, commander of the military expedition, in a 1763 portrait On the morning of April 18, Gage ordered a mounted patrol of about 20 men under the command of Major Mitchell of the 5th Regiment of Foot into the surrounding country to intercept messengers who might be out on horseback.Fischer, p. 89 This patrol behaved differently from patrols sent out from Boston in the past, staying out after dark and asking travelers about the location of Samuel Adams and John Hancock. This had the unintended effect of alarming many residents and increasing their preparedness. The Lexington militia in particular began to muster early that evening, hours before receiving any word from Boston. A well-known story alleges that after nightfall one farmer, Josiah Nelson, mistook the British patrol for the colonists and asked them, \\"Have you heard anything about when the regulars are coming out?\\" upon which he was slashed on his scalp with a sword. However, the story of this incident was not published until over a century later, which suggests that it may be little more than a family myth.Hafner discusses this incident in detail, noting how the story can be reconciled with other established facts. Lieutenant Colonel Francis Smith received orders from Gage on the afternoon of April 18 with instructions that he was not to read them until his troops were underway. He was to proceed from Boston \\"with utmost expedition and secrecy to Concord, where you will seize and destroy ... all Military stores ... But you will take care that the soldiers do not plunder the inhabitants or hurt private property.\\" Gage used his discretion and did not issue written orders for the arrest of rebel leaders, as he feared doing so might spark an uprising.Fischer, p. 85 = American preparations = Margaret Kemble Gage may have given military intelligence to the rebels. On March 30, 1775, the Massachusetts Provincial Congress issued the following resolution: The rebellion's leaders‚Äîwith the exception of Paul Revere and Joseph Warren‚Äîhad all left Boston by April 8. They had received word of Dartmouth's secret instructions to General Gage from sources in London well before they reached Gage himself.Tourtellot, pp. 71‚Äì72 (colonists have intelligence in late March) & p. 87 (Gage receives instructions April 16) Adams and Hancock had fled Boston to the home of one of Hancock's relatives, Jonas Clarke, where they thought they would be safe from the immediate threat of arrest.Tourtellot, p. 70 The Massachusetts militias had indeed been gathering a stock of weapons, powder, and supplies at Concord and much further west in Worcester.Fischer, pp. 80‚Äì85 An expedition from Boston to Concord was widely anticipated. After a large contingent of regulars alarmed the countryside by an expedition from Boston to Watertown on March 30, The Pennsylvania Journal, a newspaper in Philadelphia, reported, \\"It was supposed they were going to Concord, where the Provincial Congress is now sitting. A quantity of provisions and warlike stores are lodged there .... It is ... said they are intending to go out again soon.Moore, p. 62.\\" On April 18, Paul Revere began the \\"midnight ride\\" to Concord to warn the inhabitants that the British appeared to be planning an expedition. The ride was finished by Samuel Prescott. Upon hearing Prescott's news, the townspeople decided to remove the stores and distribute them among other towns nearby.Fischer, p. 87. The colonists were also aware that April 19 would be the date of the expedition, despite Gage's efforts to keep the details hidden from all the British rank and file and even from the officers who would command the mission. There is reasonable speculation that the confidential source of this intelligence was Margaret Gage, General Gage's New Jersey-born wife, who had sympathies with the Colonial cause and a friendly relationship with Warren. Between 9 and 10 pm on the night of April 18, 1775, Joseph Warren told Revere and William Dawes that the British troops were about to embark in boats from Boston bound for Cambridge and the road to Lexington and Concord. Warren's intelligence suggested that the most likely objectives of the regulars' movements later that night would be the capture of Adams and Hancock. They did not worry about the possibility of regulars marching to Concord, since the supplies at Concord were safe, but they did think their leaders in Lexington were unaware of the potential danger that night. Revere and Dawes were sent out to warn them and to alert colonial militias in nearby towns.Paul Revere, Letter to Jeremy Belknap, January, 1798, and Paul Revere, Deposition, April, 1775. = Militia forces assemble = Dawes covered the southern land route by horseback across Boston Neck and over the Great Bridge to Lexington.Fischer, p. 97 Revere first gave instructions to send a signal to Charlestown using lanterns hung in the steeple of Boston's Old North Church. He then traveled the northern water route, crossing the mouth of the Charles River by rowboat, slipping past the British warship HMS Somerset at anchor. Crossings were banned at that hour, but Revere safely landed in Charlestown and rode west to Lexington, warning almost every house along the route.Paul Revere, Letter to Jeremy Belknap, January, 1798. Additional riders were sent north from Charlestown. Silversmith Paul Revere and several other messengers on horseback sounded the alarm that the regulars were leaving Boston. After they arrived in Lexington, Revere, Dawes, Hancock, and Adams discussed the situation with the militia assembling there. They believed that the forces leaving the city were too large for the sole task of arresting two men and that Concord was the main target. The Lexington men dispatched riders to the surrounding towns, and Revere and Dawes continued along the road to Concord accompanied by Samuel Prescott. In Lincoln, they ran into the British patrol led by Major Mitchell. Revere was captured, Dawes was thrown from his horse, and only Prescott escaped to reach Concord.Paul Revere, Deposition of April, 1775. Additional riders were sent out from Concord. The ride of Revere, Dawes, and Prescott triggered a flexible system of \\"alarm and muster\\" that had been carefully developed months before, in reaction to the colonists' impotent response to the Powder Alarm. This system was an improved version of an old notification network for use in times of emergency. The colonists had periodically used it during the early years of Indian wars in the colony, before it fell into disuse in the French and Indian War. In addition to other express riders delivering messages, bells, drums, alarm guns, bonfires and a trumpet were used for rapid communication from town to town, notifying the rebels in dozens of eastern Massachusetts villages that they should muster their militias because over 500 regulars were leaving Boston. This system was so effective that people in towns from Boston were aware of the army's movements while they were still unloading boats in Cambridge.Fischer, pp. 138‚Äì145 These early warnings played a crucial role in assembling a sufficient number of colonial militia to inflict heavy damage on the British regulars later in the day. Adams and Hancock were eventually moved to safety, first to what is now Burlington and later to Billerica.Frothingham, p. 60 A National Park Service map showing the routes of the initial Patriot messengers and of the British expedition = British forces advance = Around dusk, General Gage called a meeting of his senior officers at the Province House. He informed them that instructions from Lord Dartmouth had arrived, ordering him to take action against the colonials. He also told them that the senior colonel of his regiments, Lieutenant Colonel Smith, would command, with Major John Pitcairn as his executive officer. The meeting adjourned around 8:30 pm, after which Earl Percy mingled with town folk on Boston Common. According to one account, the discussion among people there turned to the unusual movement of the British soldiers in the town. When Percy questioned one man further, the man replied, \\"Well, the regulars will miss their aim.\\" \\"What aim?\\" asked Percy. \\"Why, the cannon at Concord\\" was the reply.Fischer, p. 96 Upon hearing this, Percy quickly returned to Province House and relayed this information to General Gage. Stunned, Gage issued orders to prevent messengers from getting out of Boston, but these were too late to prevent Dawes and Revere from leaving.Frothingham, p. 58 1775 map of the battles and of the Siege of Boston The British regulars, around 700 infantry, were drawn from 11 of Gage's 13 occupying infantry regiments. Major Pitcairn commanded ten elite light infantry companies, and Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Bernard commanded 11 grenadier companies, under the overall command of Lieutenant Colonel Smith.Tourtellot, pp. 105‚Äì107 Of the troops assigned to the expedition, 350 were from grenadier companies drawn from the 4th (King's Own), 5th, 10th, 18th (Royal Irish), 23rd, 38th, 43rd, 47th, 52nd and 59th Regiments of Foot, and the 1st Battalion of His Majesty's Marine Forces. Protecting the grenadier companies were about 320 light infantry from the 4th, 5th, 10th, 23rd, 38th, 43rd, 47th, 52nd, and 59th Regiments, and the 1st Battalion of the Marines. Each company had its own lieutenant, but the majority of the captains commanding them were volunteers attached to them at the last minute, drawn from all the regiments stationed in Boston. This lack of familiarity between commander and company would cause problems during the battle.Fischer, pp. 70, 121 The British began to awaken their troops at 9 pm on the night of April 18 and assembled them on the water's edge on the western end of Boston Common by 10 pm. Colonel Smith was late in arriving, and there was no organized boat- loading operation, resulting in confusion at the staging area. The boats used were naval barges that were packed so tightly that there was no room to sit down. When they disembarked near Phipps Farm in Cambridge, it was into waist- deep water at midnight. After a lengthy halt to unload their gear, the regulars began their march to Concord at about 2 am. During the wait they were provided with extra ammunition, cold salt pork, and hard sea biscuits. They did not carry knapsacks, since they would not be encamped. They carried their haversacks (food bags), canteens, muskets, and accoutrements, and marched off in wet, muddy shoes and soggy uniforms. As they marched through Menotomy, sounds of the colonial alarms throughout the countryside caused the few officers who were aware of their mission to realize they had lost the element of surprise.Tourtellot, pp. 109‚Äì115 At about 3 am, Colonel Smith sent Major Pitcairn ahead with six companies of light infantry under orders to quick march to Concord. At about 4 am Smith made the wise but belated decision to send a messenger back to Boston asking for reinforcements.Fischer, pp. 127‚Äì128 = Order of Battle =  Continentals  The continental force included some 4,000 militia and local minuteman companies.George Nafziger, Battle of Concord 19 April 1775, United States Army Combined Arms Center. Although the Provincial Congress had organized local companies into regiments and brigades with designated commanders, units turned out piecemeal over the course of the day. Thirty towns from the surrounding area sent men into combat with many more on the way. By afternoon, many regimental commands were fundamentally present and acting in a coordinated manner. Several provincial generals were en route to the fighting during the day but not in a position to assert overall command. General William Heath of Roxbury, Massachusetts exerted command of a phase of the fighting toward day's end.Daughan, pp. 235-236  British Forces  The British force was organized into: * Column ** Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Francis Smith ** Supernumeraries (6 Officers) ** Mitchell's Party (8+ Officers) ** Flank Companies (Grenadiers and Light Infantry) from: *** 4th (The King's Own) Regiment of Foot *** 5th Regiment of Foot *** 10th Regiment of Foot *** 18th (The Royal Irish) Regiment of Foot (Grenadiers only) *** 23rd Regiment of Foot (Royal Welch Fusiliers) *** 38th Regiment of Foot *** 43rd Regiment of Foot *** 47th Regiment of Foot *** 52nd Regiment of Foot *** 59th Regiment of Foot *** 1st Battalion, Royal Marines * Relief Force ** Commander, Brigadier General His Grace Hugh Percy, 2nd Duke of Northumberland ** 2 6-pounder guns from 4th Battalion, Royal Artillery ** Battalion Companies from (7 regular companies, these didn't include the flank companies): *** 4th (The King's Own) Regiment of Foot *** 23rd Regiment of Foot (Royal Welch Fusiliers) *** 47th Regiment of Foot *** 1st Battalion, Royal Marines  The Battles  = Lexington = BEP engraved vignette Battle of Lexington which appeared on the $20 National Bank Note Battle of Lexington, April 19, 1775, New York Public Library Although often styled a battle, in reality the engagement at Lexington was a minor brush or skirmish.The Oxford Illustrated History of the British Army (1994) p. 122 As the regulars' advance guard under Pitcairn entered Lexington at sunrise on April 19, 1775, about 80 Lexington militiamen emerged from Buckman Tavern and stood in ranks on the village common watching them, and between 40 and 100 spectators watched from along the side of the road.Fischer, p. 400 Their leader was Captain John Parker, a veteran of the French and Indian War, who was suffering from tuberculosis and was at times difficult to hear. Of the militiamen who lined up, nine had the surname Harrington, seven Munroe (including the company's orderly sergeant, William Munroe), four Parker, three Tidd, three Locke, and three Reed; fully one quarter of them were related to Captain Parker in some way.Fischer, p. 158 This group of militiamen was part of Lexington's \\"training band\\", a way of organizing local militias dating back to the Puritans, and not what was styled a minuteman company.Fischer, p. 153 After having waited most of the night with no sign of any British troops (and wondering if Paul Revere's warning was true), at about 4:15 a.m., Parker got his confirmation.Fischer, p. 151. Thaddeus Bowman, the last scout that Parker had sent out, rode up at a gallop and told him that they were not only coming, but coming in force and they were close.Tourtellot, A pp. 116-126. Captain Parker was clearly aware that he was outmatched in the confrontation and was not prepared to sacrifice his men for no purpose. He knew that most of the colonists' powder and military supplies at Concord had already been hidden. No war had been declared. (The Declaration of Independence was a year in the future.) He also knew the British had gone on such expeditions before in Massachusetts, found nothing, and marched back to Boston.Fischer, pp. 43, 75‚Äì86. Parker had every reason to expect that to occur again. The Regulars would march to Concord, find nothing, and return to Boston, tired but empty- handed. He positioned his company carefully. He placed them in parade-ground formation, on Lexington Common. They were in plain sight (not hiding behind walls), but not blocking the road to Concord. They made a show of political and military determination, but no effort to prevent the march of the Regulars.Galvin, pp. 120-124. Many years later, one of the participants recalled Parker's words as being what is now engraved in stone at the site of the battle: \\"Stand your ground; don't fire unless fired upon, but if they mean to have a war, let it begin here.\\"Coburn, p. 63 According to Parker's sworn deposition taken after the battle: Rather than turn left towards Concord, Marine Lieutenant Jesse Adair, at the head of the advance guard, decided on his own to protect the flank of the British column by first turning right and then leading the companies onto the Common itself, in a confused effort to surround and disarm the militia. Major Pitcairn arrived from the rear of the advance force and led his three companies to the left and halted them. The remaining companies under Colonel Smith lay further down the road toward Boston.Fischer, pp. 189‚Äì190  First shot  A British officer (probably Pitcairn, but accounts are uncertain, as it may also have been Lieutenant William Sutherland) then rode forward, waving his sword, and called out for the assembled militia to disperse, and may also have ordered them to \\"lay down your arms, you damned rebels!\\"Deposition of Elijah Sanderson, April 25, 1775: \\"I heard one of the Regulars, whom I took to be an officer, say 'damn them, we will have them;' and immediately the Regulars shouted aloud, run, and fired on the Lexington Company, which did not fire a gun before the Regulars discharged on them.\\" Deposition of Thomas Price Willard, April 23, 1775: \\"Directly after this an officer rode before the Regulars to the other side of the body, and hallooed after the militia of said Lexington, and said 'Lay down your arms, damn you; why don't you lay down your arms?'\\" Deposition of John Robbins, April 25, 1775: \\"... I being in the front rank, there suddenly appeared a number of the King's troops ... at a distance of about sixty or seventy yards from us, huzzaing and on a quick pace toward us, with three officers in their front on horseback, and on full gallop towards us; the foremost of which cried, 'Throw down you arms, ye villains, ye rebels;' upon which said [Lexington] Company dispersing, the foremost of the three officers ordered their men, saying 'Fire, by God, fire;' at which moment we received a very heavy and close fire from them;\\" Journals of the Continental Congress, May 11, 1775. Captain Parker told his men instead to disperse and go home, but, because of the confusion, the yelling all around, and due to the raspiness of Parker's tubercular voice, some did not hear him, some left very slowly, and none laid down their arms. Both Parker and Pitcairn ordered their men to hold fire, but a shot was fired from an unknown source.Fischer, pp.190‚Äì191 The first of four engravings by Amos Doolittle from 1775. Doolittle visited the battle sites and interviewed soldiers and witnesses. Contains controversial elements, possibly inaccuracies. Fire from the militia may have occurred but is not depicted. According to one member of Parker's militia, none of the Americans had discharged their muskets as they faced the oncoming British troops. The British did suffer one casualty, a slight wound, the particulars of which were corroborated by a deposition made by Corporal John Munroe. Munroe stated that: Some witnesses among the regulars reported the first shot was fired by a colonial onlooker from behind a hedge or around the corner of a tavern. Some observers reported a mounted British officer firing first. Both sides generally agreed that the initial shot did not come from the men on the ground immediately facing each other.Fischer, p. 193 Speculation arose later in Lexington that a man named Solomon Brown fired the first shot from inside the tavern or from behind a wall, but this has been discredited.Fischer, p. 402 Some witnesses (on each side) claimed that someone on the other side fired first; however, many more witnesses claimed to not know. Yet another theory is that the first shot was one fired by the British, that killed Asahel Porter, their prisoner who was running away (he had been told to walk away and he would be let go, though he panicked and began to run). Historian David Hackett Fischer has proposed that there may actually have been multiple near- simultaneous shots.Fischer discusses the shot on pp. 193‚Äì194, with detailed footnotes on pp. 399‚Äì403, in which he discusses some of the testimony in detail. Historian Mark Urban claims the British surged forward with bayonets ready in an undisciplined way, provoking a few scattered shots from the militia. In response the British troops, without orders, fired a devastating volley. This lack of discipline among the British troops had a key role in the escalation of violence.Urban, pp. 19‚Äì20 Witnesses at the scene described several intermittent shots fired from both sides before the lines of regulars began to fire volleys without receiving orders to do so. A few of the militiamen believed at first that the regulars were only firing powder with no ball, but when they realized the truth, few if any of the militia managed to load and return fire. The rest ran for their lives.Fischer, pp. 194‚Äì195 The regulars then charged forward with bayonets. Captain Parker's cousin Jonas was run through. Eight Lexington men were killed, and ten were wounded. The only British casualty was a soldier who was wounded in the thigh. The eight colonists killed were John Brown, Samuel Hadley, Caleb Harrington, Jonathon Harrington, Robert Munroe, Isaac Muzzey, Asahel Porter, and Jonas Parker. Jonathon Harrington, fatally wounded by a British musket ball, managed to crawl back to his home, and died on his own doorstep. One wounded man, Prince Estabrook, was a black slave who was serving in the militia.Benjamin Quarles, p. 10. The companies under Pitcairn's command got beyond their officers' control in part because they were unaware of the actual purpose of the day's mission. They fired in different directions and prepared to enter private homes. Colonel Smith, who was just arriving with the remainder of the regulars, heard the musket fire and rode forward from the grenadier column to see the action. He quickly found a drummer and ordered him to beat assembly. The grenadiers arrived shortly thereafter, and once order was restored among the soldiers, the light infantry were permitted to fire a victory volley, after which the column was reformed and marched on toward Concord.Fischer, pp. 198‚Äì200 = Concord = The second of four engravings by Amos Doolittle from 1775, depicting the British entering Concord In response to the raised alarm, the militiamen of Concord and Lincoln had mustered in Concord. They received reports of firing at Lexington, and were not sure whether to wait until they could be reinforced by troops from towns nearby, or to stay and defend the town, or to move east and greet the British Army from superior terrain. A column of militia marched down the road toward Lexington to meet the British, traveling about until they met the approaching column of regulars. As the regulars numbered about 700 and the militia at this time only numbered about 250, the militia column turned around and marched back into Concord, preceding the regulars by a distance of about .Tourtellot, p. 152 The militia retreated to a ridge overlooking the town, and their officers discussed what to do next. Caution prevailed, and Colonel James Barrett withdrew from the center of town and led the men across the North Bridge to a hill about a mile north, where they could continue to watch the troop movements of the British and the activities in the town center. This step proved fortuitous, as the ranks of the militia continued to grow as minuteman companies arriving from the western towns joined them there.Tourtellot, p. 154  The search for militia supplies  When the British troops arrived in the village of Concord, Lt. Col. Smith divided them to carry out Gage's orders. The 10th Regiment's company of grenadiers secured South Bridge under Captain Mundy Pole, while seven companies of light infantry under Captain Parsons, numbering about 100, secured the North Bridge, where they were visible across the cleared fields to the assembling militia companies. Captain Parsons took four companies from the 5th, 23rd, 38th and 52nd Regiments up the road beyond the North Bridge to search Barrett's Farm, where intelligence indicated supplies would be found.Frothingham, p. 67 Two companies from the 4th and 10th Regiments were stationed to guard their return route, and one company from the 43rd remained guarding the bridge itself. These companies, which were under the relatively inexperienced command of Captain Walter Laurie, were aware that they were significantly outnumbered by the 400-plus militiamen. The concerned Captain Laurie sent a messenger to Lt. Col. Smith requesting reinforcements.Fischer, p. 215 Using detailed information provided by Loyalist spies, the grenadier companies searched the small town for military supplies. When they arrived at Ephraim Jones's tavern, by the jail on the South Bridge road, they found the door barred shut, and Jones refused them entry. According to reports provided by local Loyalists, Pitcairn knew cannon had been buried on the property. Jones was ordered at gunpoint to show where the guns were buried. These turned out to be three massive pieces, firing 24-pound shot, that were much too heavy to use defensively, but very effective against fortifications, with sufficient range to bombard the city of Boston from other parts of nearby mainland.Fischer p.207 The grenadiers smashed the trunnions of these three guns so they could not be mounted. They also burned some gun carriages found in the village meetinghouse, and when the fire spread to the meetinghouse itself, local resident Martha Moulton persuaded the soldiers to help in a bucket brigade to save the building.Martha Moulton deposition Nearly a hundred barrels of flour and salted food were thrown into the millpond, as were 550 pounds of musket balls. Of the damage done, only that done to the cannon was significant. All of the shot and much of the food was recovered after the British left. During the search, the regulars were generally scrupulous in their treatment of the locals, including paying for food and drink consumed. This excessive politeness was used to advantage by the locals, who were able to misdirect searches from several smaller caches of militia supplies.Tourtellot, pp. 155‚Äì158. In his orders to Lt. Col. Smith for the expedition, General Gage had explicitly instructed that \\"you will take care that the soldiers do not plunder the inhabitants, or hurt private property\\". Barrett's Farm had been an arsenal weeks before, but few weapons remained now, and according to family legend, these were quickly buried in furrows to look like a crop had been planted. The troops sent there did not find any supplies of consequence.French, p. 197  The North Bridge  The reconstructed North Bridge in Minute Man National Historical Park, Concord Colonel Barrett's troops, upon seeing smoke rising from the village square as the British burned cannon carriages, and seeing only a few light infantry companies directly below them, decided to march back toward the town from their vantage point on Punkatasset Hill to a lower, closer flat hilltop about from the North Bridge. As the militia advanced, the two British companies from the 4th and 10th Regiments that held the position near the road retreated to the bridge and yielded the hill to Barrett's men.Fischer, p. 208 Five full companies of Minutemen and five more of militia from Acton, Concord, Bedford and Lincoln occupied this hill as more groups of men streamed in, totaling at least 400 against Captain Laurie's light infantry companies, a force totaling 90‚Äì95 men. Barrett ordered the Massachusetts men to form one long line two abreast on the highway leading down to the bridge, and then he called for another consultation. While overlooking North Bridge from the top of the hill, Barrett, Lt. Col. John Robinson of WestfordRobinson arrived earlier with several Westford Minutemen after he was alerted by rider at his home in Westford-David Hackett Fischer, Paul Revere's Ride, Oxford, page 146. George E. Downey, A History of the First Parish of Westford, Town of Westford, 1975, page 27. Allen French, Historic Concord, Cambria, 1942, pages 66 and 68. and the other Captains discussed possible courses of action. Captain Isaac Davis of Acton, whose troops had arrived late, declared his willingness to defend a town not their own by saying, \\"I'm not afraid to go, and I haven't a man that's afraid to go.\\"Fischer, p. 209 Barrett told the men to load their weapons but not to fire unless fired upon, and then ordered them to advance. Laurie ordered the British companies guarding the bridge to retreat across it. One officer then tried to pull up the loose planks of the bridge to impede the colonial advance, but Major Buttrick began to yell at the regulars to stop harming the bridge. The Minutemen and militia from Concord, Acton and a handful of Westford Minutemen, advanced in column formation, two by two, led by Major Buttrick, Lt. Col. Robinson,A. Doolittle print of the Battle indicates this after interviews with eyewtiness accounts one month after the Battle then Capt. Davis,Rev. Joseph Thaxter from the United States Literary Gazette, Vol 1, page 264., (Letter by Minuteman at the Battle), Concord resident and Witness of the battle Rev. Dr. Ripley in his published account of 1827, Hodgman, Rev. Edwin. History of the Town of Westford, 1659‚Äì1883. Lowell: Morning Mail Co.,1883. on the light infantry, keeping to the road, since it was surrounded by the spring floodwaters of the Concord River.Fischer, pp. 209‚Äì212 The third of four engravings by Amos Doolittle from 1775, depicting the engagement at the North Bridge Captain Laurie then made a poor tactical decision. Since his summons for help had not produced any results, he ordered his men to form positions for \\"street firing\\" behind the bridge in a column running perpendicular to the river. This formation was appropriate for sending a large volume of fire into a narrow alley between the buildings of a city, but not for an open path behind a bridge. Confusion reigned as regulars retreating over the bridge tried to form up in the street-firing position of the other troops. Lieutenant Sutherland, who was in the rear of the formation, saw Laurie's mistake and ordered flankers to be sent out. But as he was from a company different from the men under his command, only three soldiers obeyed him. The remainder tried as best they could in the confusion to follow the orders of the superior officer.Fischer, p. 212 A shot rang out. It was likely a warning shot fired by a panicked, exhausted British soldier from the 43rd, according to Captain Laurie's report to his commander after the fight. Two other regulars then fired immediately after that, shots splashing in the river, and then the narrow group up front, possibly thinking the order to fire had been given, fired a ragged volley before Laurie could stop them.French, General Gage's Informers, p. 97. Laurie reported, \\"I imagine myself that a man of my Company (afterwards killed) did first fire his piece, tho' Mr. [Lt.] Sutherland has since assured me that the Country people fired first.\\" Two of the Acton Minutemen, Private Abner Hosmer and Captain Isaac Davis, who were at the head of the line marching to the bridge, were hit and killed instantly. Rev. Dr. Ripley recalled: Four more men were wounded. Major Buttrick then yelled to the militia, \\"Fire, for God's sake, fellow soldiers, fire!\\"Tourtellot, pp. 165‚Äì166 At this point the lines were separated by the Concord River and the bridge, and were only apart. The few front rows of colonists, bound by the road and blocked from forming a line of fire, managed to fire over each other's heads and shoulders at the regulars massed across the bridge. Four of the eight British officers and sergeants, who were leading from the front of their troops, were wounded by the volley of musket fire. At least three privates (Thomas Smith, Patrick Gray, and James Hall, all from the 4th) were killed or mortally wounded, and nine were wounded.Fischer, p. 214 In 1824, Reverend and Minuteman Joseph Thaxter wrote: The regulars found themselves trapped in a situation where they were both outnumbered and outmaneuvered. Lacking effective leadership and terrified at the superior numbers of the enemy, with their spirit broken, and likely not having experienced combat before, they abandoned their wounded, and fled to the safety of the approaching grenadier companies coming from the town center, isolating Captain Parsons and the companies searching for arms at Barrett's Farm.  After the fight  Statue memorializing the battle at the North Bridge, inscribed with verse from Emerson's \\"Concord Hymn\\" The colonists were stunned by their success. No one had actually believed either side would shoot to kill the other. Some advanced; many more retreated; and some went home to see to the safety of their homes and families. Colonel Barrett eventually began to recover control. He moved some of the militia back to the hilltop away and sent Major Buttrick with others across the bridge to a defensive position on a hill behind a stone wall.Fischer, pp. 214‚Äì215 Lieutenant Colonel Smith heard the exchange of fire from his position in the town moments after he received the request for reinforcements from Laurie. He quickly assembled two companies of grenadiers to lead toward the North Bridge himself. As these troops marched, they met the shattered remnants of the three light infantry companies running towards them. Smith was concerned about the four companies that had been at Barrett's, since their route to town was now unprotected. When he saw the Minutemen in the distance behind their wall, he halted his two companies and moved forward with only his officers to take a closer look. One of the Minutemen behind that wall observed, \\"If we had fired, I believe we could have killed almost every officer there was in the front, but we had no orders to fire and there wasn't a gun fired.\\"Fischer, p. 216 During a tense standoff lasting about 10 minutes, a mentally ill local man named Elias Brown wandered through both sides selling hard cider. At this point, the detachment of regulars sent to Barrett's farm marched back from their fruitless search of that area. They passed through the now mostly- deserted battlefield, and saw dead and wounded comrades lying on the bridge. There was one who looked to them as if he had been scalped, which angered and shocked the British soldiers. They crossed the bridge and returned to the town by 11:30 a.m., under the watchful eyes of the colonists, who continued to maintain defensive positions. The regulars continued to search for and destroy colonial military supplies in the town, ate lunch, reassembled for marching, and left Concord after noon. This delay in departure gave colonial militiamen from outlying towns additional time to reach the road back to Boston.Tourtellot, pp. 166‚Äì168 = Return march =  Concord to Lexington  A National Park Service map showing the retreat from Concord and Percy's rescue Lieutenant Colonel Smith, concerned about the safety of his men, sent flankers to follow a ridge and protect his forces from the roughly 1,000 colonials now in the field as the British marched east out of Concord. This ridge ended near Meriam's Corner, a crossroads about a mile (2 km) outside the village of Concord, where the main road came to a bridge across a small stream. To cross the narrow bridge, the British had to pull the flankers back into the main column and close ranks to a mere three soldiers abreast. Colonial militia companies arriving from the north and east had converged at this point, and presented a clear numerical advantage over the regulars.Muster rolls for the militia and minute companies converging at this point are included in Coburn, pp. 7-35. However, as Coburn notes, these rolls are not a complete tally of the militiamen present, because some muster lists were either not submitted or have not been found in archives. The British were now witnessing once again what General Gage had hoped to avoid by dispatching the expedition in secrecy and in the dark of night: the ability of the colonial militiamen to rise and converge by the thousands when British forces ventured out of Boston. As the last of the British column marched over the narrow bridge, the British rear guard wheeled and fired a volley at the colonial militiamen, who had been firing irregularly and ineffectively from a distance but now had closed to within musket range.Both the British and the local militias were armed with smooth-bore muskets that had an effective range of aimed fire of only 80-100 yards (75-90 m), although the musket ball could have serious effect at a greater distance, if it happened by chance to hit a person. There is no record that any soldiers on either side were armed with longer-range, more accurate rifles. Dr. Benjamin Church, a member of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress and the Committee of Safety, informed General Gage in March, 1775, that the colonial militiamen \\"from their adroitness in the habitual use of the firelock suppose themselves sure of their mark at a distance of 200 rods\\". Even if Church meant yards rather than rods (600 feet versus 3300 feet), it is unclear whether he was profoundly ignorant of the capabilities of a musket, was exaggerating in order to mislead Gage (as Church later claimed when accused of being a spy), or was ridiculing the American militiamen. See Philbrick, p. 92, and French, p. 57-58. On whether Church was a spy, see French, Chapter V. The colonists returned fire, this time with deadly effect. Two regulars were killed and perhaps six wounded, with no colonial casualties. Smith sent out his flanking troops again after crossing the small bridge.French, p. 219, and Lister, Concord Fight, being so much of the narrative of Ensign Jeremy Lister of the 10th regiment of foot. On Brooks Hill (also known as Hardy's Hill) about past Meriam's Corner, nearly 500 militiamen had assembled to the south of the road, awaiting opportunity to fire down upon the British column on the road below.Fischer, pp. 408‚Äì409. Fischer notes conflicting accounts of which militia companies were engaged at this point, and the number of militiamen. Smith's leading forces charged up the hill to drive them off, but the colonists did not withdraw, inflicting significant casualties on the attackers. Smith withdrew his men from Brooks Hill, and the column continued on to another small bridge into Lincoln, at Brooks Tavern, where more militia companies intensified the attack from the north side of the road. Captain John Parker. It is by Henry Hudson Kitson and stands at the town green of Lexington, Massachusetts. The regulars soon reached a point in the road now referred to as the \\"Bloody Angle\\" where the road rises and curves sharply to the left through a lightly- wooded area.Fischer notes on p. 409, \\"This is not correctly called the Bloody Angle, an error term introduced after the Civil War that is both inaccurate and anachronistic. It has been used uncritically by many historians of the battle and is perpetuated by the National Park Service.\\" The Interim Report of the Boston National Historic Sites Commission, submitted to Congress in 1958 in support of legislation that established the Minute Man National Historical Park, asserted that: \\"Fittingly, this curving section of the road was soon to be named 'The Bloody Angle'.\\" (p. 47; emphasis added). However, there is no evidence that the term Bloody Angle was ever used by the battle participants or local residents following April 19, 1775, nor did historians use the term prior to the mid-20th century. See Boston National Historic Sites Commission, The Lexington-Concord Battle Road: Interim Report, June 16, 1958. At this place, the militia company from Woburn had positioned themselves on the southeast side of the bend in the road in a rocky, lightly-wooded field. Additional militia flowing parallel to the road from the engagement at Meriam's Corner positioned themselves on the northwest side of the road, catching the British in a crossfire, while other militia companies on the road closed from behind to attack. Some further along, the road took another sharp curve, this time to the right, and again the British column was caught by another large force of militiamen firing from both sides. In passing through these two sharp curves, the British force lost thirty soldiers killed or wounded, and four colonial militia were also killed, including Captain Jonathan Wilson of Bedford, Captain Nathan Wyman of Billerica, Lt. John Bacon of Natick, and Daniel Thompson of Woburn. The British soldiers escaped by breaking into a trot, a pace that the colonials could not maintain through the woods and swampy terrain. Colonial forces on the road itself behind the British were too densely packed and disorganized to mount more than a harassing attack from the rear.Fischer, pp. 226‚Äì227 As militia forces from other towns continued to arrive, the colonial forces had risen to about 2,000 men. The road now straightened to the east, with cleared fields and orchards along the sides. Lt. Col. Smith sent out flankers again, who succeeded in trapping some militia from behind and inflicting casualties. British casualties were also mounting from these engagements and from persistent long- range fire from the militiamen, and the exhausted British were running out of ammunition.Fischer, p. 232. According to one British officer, ammunition had been wasted earlier in the day out of \\"too great eagerness of the soldiers in the first action of a war. Most of them were young soldiers who had never been in action, and had been taught that every thing was to be effected by a quick firing. This ineffectual fire gave the rebels more confidence, as they soon found that notwithstanding there was so much [firing], they suffered but little from it.\\" Lt. Frederick Mackenzie, 23rd Royal Welch Fusiliers, Diary of Frederick Mackenzie, in Allen French, editor, A British Fusilier in Revolutionary Boston, Cambridge, 1926. When the British column neared the boundary between Lincoln and Lexington, it encountered another ambush from a hill overlooking the road, set by Captain John Parker's Lexington militiamen, including some of them bandaged up from the encounter in Lexington earlier in the day. At this point, Lt. Col. Smith was wounded in the thigh and knocked from his horse. Major John Pitcairn assumed effective command of the column and sent light infantry companies up the hill to clear the militia forces.Fischer, pp. 410‚Äì411. Fischer notes conflicting accounts about where this ambush‚Äînow sometimes referred to as \\"Parker's Revenge\\"‚Äîtook place, whether within Lincoln or Lexington. The light infantry cleared two additional hills as the column continued east‚Äî\\"The Bluff\\" and \\"Fiske Hill\\"‚Äî and took still more casualties from ambushes set by fresh militia companies joining the battle. In one of the musket volleys from the colonial soldiers, Major Pitcairn's horse bolted in fright, throwing Pitcairn to the ground and injuring his arm.Coburn, pp. 106-107 Now both principal leaders of the expedition were injured or unhorsed, and their men were tired, thirsty, and exhausting their ammunition. A few surrendered or were captured; some now broke formation and ran forward toward Lexington. In the words of one British officer, \\"we began to run rather than retreat in order. ... We attempted to stop the men and form them two deep, but to no purpose, the confusion increased rather than lessened. ... the officers got to the front and presented their bayonets, and told the men if they advanced they should die. Upon this, they began to form up under heavy fire.\\"Ensign Henry De Berniere, \\"Report to General Gage on April 19, 1775\\", quoted in Fischer, pp. 231-232 Only one British officer remained uninjured among the three companies at the head of the British column as it approach Lexington Center. He understood the column's perilous situation: \\"There were very few men had any ammunition left, and so fatigued that we could not keep flanking parties out, so that we must soon have laid down our arms, or been picked off by the Rebels at their pleasure‚Äînearer to‚Äîand we were not able to keep them off.\\"Lt. John Barker, The King's Own Regiment, \\"Diary of a British Soldier\\", Atlantic Monthly, April 1877, vol. 39 He then heard cheering further ahead. A full brigade, about 1,000 men with artillery under the command of Earl Percy, had arrived to rescue them. It was about 2:30 p.m., and the British column had now been on the march since 2 o'clock in the morning.Fischer, p. 232. Westford Minuteman, Rev. Joseph Thaxter, wrote of his account: In their accounts afterward, British officers and soldiers alike noted their frustration that the colonial militiamen fired at them from behind trees and stone walls, rather than confronting them in large, linear formations in the style of European warfare.A remark in Lt. Col. Smith's report to General Gage, dated April 22, 1775, is typical: \\"Notwithstanding the enemy's numbers, they did not make one gallant attempt during so long an action, though our men were so very fatigued, but [instead] kept under cover.\\" Henry S. Commager, editor. Documents of American History, New York, 1948, p. 90 This image of the individual colonial farmer, musket in hand and fighting under his own command, has also been fostered in American myth: \\"Chasing the red-coats down the lane / Then crossing the fields to emerge again / Under the trees at the turn of the road, / And only pausing to fire and load.\\"Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Paul Revere's Ride, 1861. To the contrary, beginning at the North Bridge and throughout the British retreat, the colonial militias repeatedly operated as coordinated companies, even when dispersed to take advantage of cover. Reflecting on the British experience that day, Earl Percy understood the significance of the American tactics:  Percy's rescue  The fourth of four engravings by Amos Doolittle from 1775, showing Percy's rescue in Lexington General Gage had anticipated that Lt. Col. Smith's expedition might require reinforcement, so Gage drafted orders for reinforcing units to assemble in Boston at 4 a.m. But in his obsession for secrecy, Gage had sent only one copy of the orders to the adjutant of the 1st Brigade, whose servant then left the envelope on a table. Also at about 4 a.m., the British column was within three miles of Lexington, and Lt. Col. Smith now had clear indication that all element of surprise had been lost and that alarm was spreading throughout the countryside. So he sent a rider back to Boston with a request for reinforcements. At about 5 a.m., the rider reached Boston, and the 1st Brigade was ordered to assemble: the line infantry companies of the 4th, 23rd, and 47th Regiments, and a battalion of Royal Marines, under the command of Earl Percy. Unfortunately for the British, once again only one copy of the orders were sent to each commander, and the order for the Royal Marines was delivered to the desk of Major John Pitcairn, who was already on the Lexington Common with Smith's column at that hour. After these delays, Percy's brigade, about 1,000 strong, left Boston at about 8:45 a.m., headed toward Lexington. Along the way, the story is told, they marched to the tune of \\"Yankee Doodle\\" to taunt the inhabitants of the area.French, p. 228 By the Battle of Bunker Hill less than two months later, the song would become a popular anthem for the colonial forces.Frothingham, p. 178 Percy took the land route across Boston Neck and over the Great Bridge, which some quick-thinking colonists had stripped of its planking to delay the British.Tourtellot, pp. 184‚Äì185 His men then came upon an absent-minded tutor at Harvard College and asked him which road would take them to Lexington. The Harvard man, apparently oblivious to the reality of what was happening around him, showed him the proper road without thinking. (He was later compelled to leave the country for inadvertently supporting the enemy.)Tourtellot, p. 185 Percy's troops arrived in Lexington at about 2:00 p.m. They could hear gunfire in the distance as they set up their cannon and deployed lines of regulars on high ground with commanding views of the town. Colonel Smith's men approached like a fleeing mob with the full complement of colonial militia in close formation pursuing them. Percy ordered his artillery to open fire at extreme range, dispersing the colonial militiamen. Smith's men collapsed with exhaustion once they reached the safety of Percy's lines.Fischer, pp. 241‚Äì242 Against the advice of his Master of Ordnance, Percy had left Boston without spare ammunition for his men or for the two artillery pieces they brought with them, thinking the extra wagons would slow him down. Each man in Percy's brigade had only 36 rounds, and each artillery piece was supplied with only a few rounds carried in side- boxes.Fischer, pp. 243‚Äì244 After Percy had left the city, Gage directed two ammunition wagons guarded by one officer and thirteen men to follow. This convoy was intercepted by a small party of older, veteran militiamen still on the \\"alarm list\\", who could not join their militia companies because they were well over 60 years of age. These men rose up in ambush and demanded the surrender of the wagons, but the regulars ignored them and drove their horses on. The old men opened fire, shot the lead horses, killed two sergeants, and wounded the officer. The British survivors ran, and six of them threw their weapons into a pond before they surrendered.There are several versions of this story. See French, p. 230, and Samuel Abbot Smith, pp. 27-32.  Lexington to Menotomy  Percy's return to Charlestown (detail from 1775 map of the battle) Percy assumed control of the combined forces of about 1,700 men and let them rest, eat, drink, and have their wounds tended at field headquarters (Munroe Tavern) before resuming the march. They set out from Lexington at about 3:30 p.m., in a formation that emphasized defense along the sides and rear of the column. Wounded regulars rode on the cannon and were forced to hop off when they were fired at by gatherings of militia. Percy's men were often surrounded, but they had the tactical advantage of interior lines. Percy could shift his units more easily to where they were needed, while the colonial militia were required to move around the outside of his formation. Percy placed Smith's men in the middle of the column, while the 23rd Regiment's line companies made up the column's rear guard. Because of information provided by Smith and Pitcairn about how the Americans were attacking, Percy ordered the rear guard to be rotated every mile or so, to allow some of his troops to rest briefly. Flanking companies were sent to both sides of the road, and a powerful force of Marines acted as the vanguard to clear the road ahead.Fischer, pp. 245‚Äì246 During the respite at Lexington, Brigadier General William Heath arrived and took command of the militia. Earlier in the day, he had traveled first to Watertown to discuss tactics with Joseph Warren, who had left Boston that morning, and other members of the Massachusetts Committee of Safety. Heath and Warren reacted to Percy's artillery and flankers by ordering the militiamen to avoid close formations that would attract cannon fire. Instead, they surrounded Percy's marching square with a moving ring of skirmishers at a distance to inflict maximum casualties at minimum risk.Fischer, pp. 250‚Äì251 A few mounted militiamen on the road would dismount, fire muskets at the approaching regulars, then remount and gallop ahead to repeat the tactic. Unmounted militia would often fire from long range, in the hope of hitting somebody in the main column of soldiers on the road and surviving, since both British and colonials used muskets with an effective combat range of about . Infantry units would apply pressure to the sides of the British column. When it moved out of range, those units would move around and forward to re-engage the column further down the road. Heath sent messengers out to intercept arriving militia units, directing them to appropriate places along the road to engage the regulars. Some towns sent supply wagons to assist in feeding and rearming the militia. Heath and Warren did lead skirmishers in small actions into battle themselves, but it was the presence of effective leadership that probably had the greatest impact on the success of these tactics. The Jason Russell House in Arlington The fighting grew more intense as Percy's forces crossed from Lexington into Menotomy. Fresh militia poured gunfire into the British ranks from a distance, and individual homeowners began to fight from their own property. Some homes were also used as sniper positions, turning the situation into a soldier's nightmare: house-to-house fighting. Jason Russell pleaded for his friends to fight alongside him to defend his house by saying, \\"An Englishman's home is his castle.\\"Fischer, p. 256 He stayed and was killed in his doorway. His friends, depending on which account is to be believed, either hid in the cellar, or died in the house from bullets and bayonets after shooting at the soldiers who followed them in. The Jason Russell House still stands and contains bullet holes from this fight. A militia unit that attempted an ambush from Russell's orchard was caught by flankers, and eleven men were killed, some allegedly after they had surrendered. Percy lost control of his men, and many regulars began to commit atrocities to repay for the supposed scalping at the North Bridge and for their own casualties at the hands of a distant, often unseen enemy. Based on the word of Pitcairn and other wounded officers from Smith's command, Percy had learned that the Minutemen were using stone walls, trees and buildings in these more thickly settled towns closer to Boston to hide behind and shoot at the column. He ordered the flank companies to clear the colonial militiamen out of such places.Fischer, p. 258 Many of the junior officers in the flank parties had difficulty stopping their exhausted, enraged men from killing everyone they found inside these buildings. For example, two innocent drunks who refused to hide in the basement of a tavern in Menotomy were killed only because they were suspected of being involved with the day's events.Tourtellot, p. 197 Although many of the accounts of ransacking and burnings were exaggerated later by the colonists for propaganda value (and to get financial compensation from the colonial government), it is certainly true that taverns along the road were ransacked and the liquor stolen by the troops, who in some cases became drunk themselves. One church's communion silver was stolen but was later recovered after it was sold in Boston. Aged Menotomy resident Samuel Whittemore killed three regulars before he was attacked by a British contingent and left for dead. (He recovered from his wounds and later died in 1793 at age 98.)Fischer, p. 257 All told, far more blood was shed in Menotomy and Cambridge than elsewhere that day. The colonists lost 25 men killed and nine wounded there, and the British lost 40 killed and 80 wounded, with the 47th Foot and the Marines suffering the highest casualties. Each was about half the day's fatalities.Hurd, p. 181  Menotomy to Charlestown  The British troops crossed the Menotomy River (today known as Alewife Brook) into Cambridge, and the fight grew more intense. Fresh militia arrived in close array instead of in a scattered formation, and Percy used his two artillery pieces and flankers at a crossroads called Watson's Corner to inflict heavy damage on them.Fischer, pp. 258‚Äì260 Earlier in the day, Heath had ordered the Great Bridge to be dismantled. Percy's brigade was about to approach the broken-down bridge and a riverbank filled with militia when Percy directed his troops down a narrow track (now Beech Street, near present-day Porter Square) and onto the road to Charlestown. The militia (now numbering about 4,000) were unprepared for this movement, and the circle of fire was broken. An American force moved to occupy Prospect Hill (in modern-day Somerville), which dominated the road, but Percy moved his cannon to the front and dispersed them with his last rounds of ammunition. A large militia force arrived from Salem and Marblehead. They might have cut off Percy's route to Charlestown, but these men halted on nearby Winter Hill and allowed the British to escape. Some accused the commander of this force, Colonel Timothy Pickering, of permitting the troops to pass because he still hoped to avoid war by preventing a total defeat of the regulars. Pickering later claimed that he had stopped on Heath's orders, but Heath denied this. It was nearly dark when Pitcairn's Marines defended a final attack on Percy's rear as they entered Charlestown. The regulars took up strong positions on the hills of Charlestown. Some of them had been without sleep for two days and had marched in 21 hours, eight hours of which had been spent under fire. But now they held high ground protected by heavy guns from HMS Somerset. Gage quickly sent over line companies of two fresh regiments‚Äîthe 10th and 64th‚Äîto occupy the high ground in Charlestown and build fortifications. Although they were begun, the fortifications were never completed and would later be a starting point for the militia works built two months later in June before the Battle of Bunker Hill. General Heath studied the position of the British Army and decided to withdraw the militia to Cambridge.Fischer, p. 261  Aftermath  The Siege of Boston 1775‚Äì1776 In the morning, Boston was surrounded by a huge militia army, numbering over 15,000, which had marched from throughout New England.Brooks, p. 96 Unlike the Powder Alarm, the rumors of spilled blood were true, and the Revolutionary War had begun. Now under the leadership of General Artemas Ward, who arrived on the 20th and replaced Brigadier General William Heath,McCullough, p. 35 they formed a siege line extending from Chelsea, around the peninsulas of Boston and Charlestown, to Roxbury, effectively surrounding Boston on three sides. In the days immediately following, the size of the colonial forces grew, as militias from New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Connecticut arrived on the scene.Frothingham, pp. 100‚Äì101 The Second Continental Congress adopted these men into the beginnings of the Continental Army. Even now, after open warfare had started, Gage still refused to impose martial law in Boston. He persuaded the town's selectmen to surrender all private weapons in return for promising that any inhabitant could leave town.Fischer, p. 265 The battle was not a major one in terms of tactics or casualties. However, in terms of supporting the British political strategy behind the Intolerable Acts and the military strategy behind the Powder Alarms, the battle was a significant failure because the expedition contributed to the fighting it was intended to prevent, and because few weapons were actually seized.Tourtellot, p. 203 The battle was followed by a war for British political opinion. Within four days of the battle, the Massachusetts Provincial Congress had collected scores of sworn testimonies from militiamen and from British prisoners. When word leaked out a week after the battle that Gage was sending his official description of events to London, the Provincial Congress sent a packet of these detailed depositions, signed by over 100 participants in the events, on a faster ship. The documents were presented to a sympathetic official and printed by the London newspapers two weeks before Gage's report arrived.Brooks, pp. 96‚Äì97Journals of the Continental Congress, pp. 26-44. Images of the original depositions can be found at http://www.fold3.com/image/474129/ Gage's official report was too vague on particulars to influence anyone's opinion. George Germain, no friend of the colonists, wrote, \\"the Bostonians are in the right to make the King's troops the aggressors and claim a victory\\".Fischer, pp. 275‚Äì276 Politicians in London tended to blame Gage for the conflict instead of their own policies and instructions. The British troops in Boston variously blamed General Gage and Colonel Smith for the failures at Lexington and Concord.Fischer, p. 263 The day after the battle, John Adams left his home in Braintree to ride along the battlefields. He became convinced that \\"the Die was cast, the Rubicon crossed\\".Fischer, p. 279 Thomas Paine in Philadelphia had previously thought of the argument between the colonies and the Home Country as \\"a kind of law-suit\\", but after news of the battle reached him, he \\"rejected the hardened, sullen-tempered Pharaoh of England forever\\".Fischer, p. 280 George Washington received the news at Mount Vernon and wrote to a friend, \\"the once-happy and peaceful plains of America are either to be drenched in blood or inhabited by slaves. Sad alternative! But can a virtuous man hesitate in his choice?\\" A group of hunters on the frontier named their campsite Lexington when they heard news of the battle in June. It eventually became the city of Lexington, Kentucky.Fischer, p. 271  Legacy  Union Flag. It was important to the early American government that an image of British fault and American innocence be maintained for this first battle of the war. The history of Patriot preparations, intelligence, warning signals, and uncertainty about the first shot was rarely discussed in the public sphere for decades. The story of the wounded British soldier at the North Bridge, hors de combat, struck down on the head by a Minuteman using a hatchet, the purported \\"scalping\\", was strongly suppressed. Depositions mentioning some of these activities were not published and were returned to the participants (this notably happened to Paul Revere).Fischer, pp. 327-328 Paintings portrayed the Lexington fight as an unjustified slaughter. The issue of which side was to blame grew during the early nineteenth century. For example, older participants' testimony in later life about Lexington and Concord differed greatly from their depositions taken under oath in 1775. All now said the British fired first at Lexington, whereas fifty or so years before, they weren't sure. All now said they fired back, but in 1775, they said few were able to. The \\"Battle\\" took on an almost mythical quality in the American consciousness. Legend became more important than truth. A complete shift occurred, and the Patriots were portrayed as actively fighting for their cause, rather than as suffering innocents. Paintings of the Lexington skirmish began to portray the militia standing and fighting back in defiance.Fischer, p. 329 Ralph Waldo Emerson immortalized the events at the North Bridge in his 1837 \\"Concord Hymn\\". The \\"Concord Hymn\\" became important because it commemorated the beginning of the American Revolution, and that for much of the 19th century it was a means by which Americans learned about the Revolution, helping to forge the identity of the nation.Napierkowski After 1860, several generations of schoolchildren memorized Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem \\"Paul Revere's Ride\\". Historically it is inaccurate (for example, Paul Revere never made it to Concord), but it captures the idea that an individual can change the course of history.Fischer, pp. 331‚Äì333 In the 20th century, popular and historical opinion varied about the events of the historic day, often reflecting the political mood of the time. Isolationist anti-war sentiments before the World Wars bred skepticism about the nature of Paul Revere's contribution (if any) to the efforts to rouse the militia. Anglophilia in the United States after the turn of the twentieth century led to more balanced approaches to the history of the battle. During World War I, a film about Paul Revere's ride was seized under the Espionage Act of 1917 for promoting discord between the United States and Britain.Fischer, pp. 336‚Äì338 During the Cold War, Revere was used not only as a patriotic symbol, but also as a capitalist one. In 1961, novelist Howard Fast published April Morning, an account of the battle from a fictional 15-year-old's perspective, and reading of the book has been frequently assigned in American secondary schools. A film version was produced for television in 1987, starring Chad Lowe and Tommy Lee Jones. In the 1990s, parallels were drawn between American tactics in the Vietnam War and those of the British Army at Lexington and Concord.Fischer, pp. 340‚Äì342 The site of the battle in Lexington is now known as the Lexington Battle Green. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a National Historic Landmark. Several memorials commemorating the battle have been established there. The lands surrounding the North Bridge in Concord, as well as approximately of the road along with surrounding lands and period buildings between Meriam's Corner and western Lexington are part of Minuteman National Historical Park. There are walking trails with interpretive displays along routes that the colonists might have used that skirted the road, and the Park Service often has personnel (usually dressed in period dress) offering descriptions of the area and explanations of the events of the day.Minuteman National Historical Park Things To Do A bronze bas relief of Major Buttrick, designed by Daniel Chester French and executed by Edmond Thomas Quinn in 1915, is in the park, along with French's Minute Man statue.

The three stamps were first placed on sale in Washington, D.C. and in five Massachusetts cities and towns that played major roles in the Lexington and Concord story: Lexington, Concord, Boston, Cambridge, and Concord Junction (as West Concord was then known).Scott's United States Stamp Catalog: First Day Covers This is not to say that other locations were not involved in the battles.

The population in 2011 was 5,104,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 321.95 km¬≤. History Early archaeological sites, such as Castro hill fort-settlements, can be found scattered throughout the municipality. The municipality has an origin that comes from mixed Moorish influences and Christian faith. Alfandagh, the Arabic term for this region, which means hospice, castle or frontier, or literally \\"a place of calm hospitality populated by peaceful or hard-working peoples\\". In a published work of Jo√£o Manuel d‚ÄôAlmeida Moraes Pessanha: :\\"Alf√¢ndega, public hospice, market likely, like the Kahn's Orient...It is a village of Arab foundation, in likely the 8th century; The Arabs maintained their nomadic lifestyle. Charmed by the conquest of Spain, they immediately molded the country according to their use and customs: a soil that many liked, a land that, many said was similar to Syria in its climate and purity of its atmosphere, or Yemen in its fertility, in India its flowers and aromas, Hedjaz in its products, and in Aden in its ports and coasts.\\" There are historical convictions that Alf√¢ndega, during Moorish occupation, was an administrative seat of some importance to a region referred to as Valiato de Aldandica. The conquest by Asturian Christians was to have likely resulted in the expulsion of the Moors, and the extension of its name with F√© (). Some suggest that the settlement was the seat of an ancient order that pre-dated the Templars, that was referred to as the Ordem dos Cavaleiros das Esporas Douradas (). Legend suggests that these Templar Knights were responsible for liberating the lands, known as the Tributo das Donzelas. The first foral was attributed on 8 May 1294, by King Dinis of Portugal, in a document that first defined the geographic limits of the municipality. On 17 September 1295, the monarch conceded a market charter, similar to one established for Covilh√£ (a new market charter was later passed by King John of Portugal on 13 January 1410). King Dinis then ordered the re-construction of the Moorish castle (yet, over time, the structure fell into ruins and its remains eventually disappeared). A 1530 census found the structure in ruins. The town's landmarks are considered the remains of the Moorish influences in the town, for example the clock tower Torre do Rel√≥gio. Tombo dos Bens do Concelho (1766) makes references to Moorish influences. In 1385, King John forced the residents of Alf√¢ndega da F√© to rebuild the Torre de Moncorvo, probably an effort to gain the community's support of the Kingdom of Castelo during the Interregnum (1383‚Äì1385). The king visited Alf√¢ndega in order to evaluate the Torre de Moncorvo, while travelling to Bragan√ßa. In 1510, Manuel I of Portugal established a new foral that redefined and expanded the limits of the municipality. The 1530 census noted that the castle was already \\"derrubado e malbaratado\\" (in ruins and of little value), and the 1766 assessments of the municipality identified that \\"the ancient walls\\" near the Clock Tower were located in a zone identified as \\"the castle\\", referring to the medieval castle. Historical records from this period until the 18th century are rare, and it is known that there were few inhabitants during these eras (less than 100 houses by one source). Yet in the second half of the 18th century, the population had grown considerably, in part due to the export of 1.72 tons of silk (by the 19th century). On 24 October 1855, the municipality was abolished, and its parishes were incorporated into the municipalities of Moncorvo, Vila Flor, Macedo de Cavaleiros and Mogadouro. The municipality was subsequently restored by January 1898. Geography =Physical geography= Although there have been changes throughout its history, Alf√¢ndega da F√© has always maintained a few geographic landmarks: the Serra de Bornes in the north, the valley of the Sabor River to the south, the Plateau of Castro Vicente in the east, and the valley of Vilari√ßa in the west. Covering an area of approximately 320 square kilometres, the extent is a synthesis of the Tr√°s- os-Montes region which covers Serras, small plateaus, plains, as well as shallow and deep valleys. The flora is a mixture of natural and introduced species ranging from chestnut, cork, oak, olive, almond, cherry, orange trees, vineyards to intensely cultivated cereal species (namely rye, which is still cultivated in the area, on lands ~1000 meters above sea level). =Climate= The region has a climate that varies between extremes: in the winter, the mountains are covered in snow and temperatures are cold; in the spring, the region is covered by wild flowering plants of enormous diversity with almond, cherry and apple orchards covered in blooms; in the summer, the dry heat is responsible for an arid environment; and in the fall, the temperate climate transforms the green of tree leaves into several hues. =Human geography= { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"20\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"float:right;\\"  } The population declined through the late 20th century. Much like other regions of the interior, there is a pull of emigrants towards more urbanized centres in the south, and slow human desertification in areas such as Alf√¢ndega da F√©. The slow aging of the population and the difficulty in attracting a young resident base has depopulated many of the parishes. The municipality retains its 1898 limits, from the Serra de Bornes to the Sabor River, and from the plateau of Castro Vicente to the Vale da Vilari√ßa. Administratively, the municipality is divided into 12 civil parishes (freguesias): * Agrobom, Saldonha e Vale Pereiro * Alf√¢ndega da F√© * Cerejais * Eucisia, Gouveia e Valverde * Ferradosa e Sendim da Serra * Gebelim e Soeima * Parada e Sendim da Ribeira * Pombal e Vales * Sambade * Vilar Ch√£o * Vilarelhos * Vilares de Vilari√ßa Electricity, indoor plumbing, basic sanitation and asphalted roads are present and available throughout the municipality, and it is one of the first municipalities to close its public dump. Although the community is not free from problems, it does have many services that are uncommon in the region, primarily due to its distance from the district capital. Its Centros de Sa√∫de (health centres), along with private initiatives, have made it one of the more dynamic municipalities in the country, providing local service without unnecessary trips to distant hospitals. The local Bombeiros Volunt√°rios (volunteer fire brigade) has been active in this role, responsible for both protection from civil and forest fires and transporting the sick and injured. The Lar da Terceira Idade da Santa Casa da Miseric√≥rdia, the Santu√°rio de Cerejais (Mariano) and other smaller institutions in the parishes provide local assistance to seniors, in addition to home-care. The largest schools, both primary and secondary level, are located within the city of Alf√¢ndega da F√©. While the establishment of a municipal library and Casa da Cultura have assisted education within these communities, the area has also experienced a decrease in local enrollment, resulting in the closure of several smaller schools. Sports facilities, such as the Pavilh√µes Desportivos (sports pavilions) and Piscinas (pools), improved community activity, as well as providing a source of water instruction (in this landlocked region). Economy With about 7000 residents, the municipality still finds agriculture its main economic stimulus. Although growth has been difficult (due to changes caused by market competition, the introduction of industrialization and lack of a national agriculture policy), most of its citizens still identify themselves as farmers. The lack of a serious quality certification for local biological products, such as olive oil, almonds, chestnuts, fruits, cheeses, local smoked meats/sausages, sweets, compotes and traditional liqueurs, has generally been a complaint of local farmers trying to expand their businesses. A number of handicrafts from the traditional culture of the region are locally produced: embroidery and quilt-making, basket-weaving, metal-smithing, shoe-making and sewing, which had been abandoned in the modernization of Portugal. One of these, the creation of fine cloths from silkworms, was common in the region. These traditions have been slowly explored for their economic and tourist-friendly benefits. This reemergence of traditional handicrafts has, over the past decades, added to the tertiary sector of the economy, along with the expansion of commerce, hotels and small industries associated with tourism. The construction of a new municipal market has improved local commerce, in addition to the expansion of the medieval fair which has been a lure for tourists, the Recinto da Feira and Feira da Cereja. Industrial activities are concentrated in an industrial zone within the main city of Alf√¢ndega. Agriculture, the base of the economy, still requires many improvements, including the expansion of dams in order to cover larger areas (another two projects have been planned). Tourism, although gaining importance recently in the region, has been aided by the construction of a modern hotel in the Serra de Bornes (Estalagem Senhora das Neves), new restaurants and the expansion of hunting lodges (for clubs, associations and huntsmen). The opening of the Parque de Usos M√∫ltiplos (Multi-Use Park) offers locals and visitors a variety of nature activities (e.g. camping).

The population in 2011 was 6,373,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 279.24 km2. History Portuguese Flag waving in Carrazeda The territory began its historical journey, from ancient vestiges discovered, during the Neolithic period, from dolmens from Zedes and Vilarinho da Castanheira. This structures were both monumental and served to support the hunter-gathering cultures. The local dolmen were discovered with paintings, consisting of circular and spiral patterns, in addition to ceramics with undulating painted lines. Vilarinho da Castanheira also shows evidence of the areas importance as a graveyard and burial site: bodies were buried here, surrounded by large rock monuments and objects of the local religion. In Cach√£o da Rapa, in the shadow of the Douro river, there are similar paintings of dark red and blues, that include anthropomorphic stylized human beings. The discovery of archeological artifacts, namely lithic flakes of quartz, fragments of metamorphic schist implements, rounded pebbles and machetes, support the belief that indigenous peoples used the space. There are also lithic remnants scattered throughout the municipality with many symbols (arcs, circles or semi-circles). In the Chalcolithic and Iron Age, settlements were common in the region of Carrazed de Ansi√£es: places such as Castro, Lapa, Serro and Castelo Fontoura, indicate the exists of organized settlement during these periods. The Romans also reorganized the territory; in the Roman villa in Quinta da Senhora da Ribeira (in Tralhariz), there were discovered vestiges of the construction of a sumptuous residence, completed with polychromatic tile, colonnaded interiors and carved relief. During this era Ansi√£es was a Roman city, designated Aquas Quintianas. The town had three altars dedicated to the local protector Tutelae Tiriensi, the other to Bandu Vordeaeco (to the cult of Lusitania in Seixo de Ansi√£es) and lastly to Jupiter Optimum M√°ximo () in Pombal. There are also visible remains of the Roman roads, including a variant of the Roman road that connect Braga and Chave, over many Roman era bridges, such as Ponte das Olgas (Pereiros) and Ponte do Torno (Amedo). The Roman era reached its end with barbarian invasions, the Suebi controlling the territory with their administrative seat in Pagus Auneco, which ultimately led to the growing influence of the walled settlement of Ansi√£es. The Berber settlers vacilited considerable with Moorish influence after 711. Taking advantage of the ancient territories, Pagus gave way to Valiato de Alf√¢ndica. There are several local toponymic names from this period, including Reimoira, Mourinha, Pala da Moura and Mour√£ozinho. It was the arrival of the Moors that drove many Christians, who did not wish to be ruled by Muslim tribes, to take refuge in Asturias, pushing there, for the Reconquista of Christian Iberia. It was at this time that the town of Ansi√£es began to take on a strategic role. The town was a walled outpost that defended Christian territory, and for that role Ferdinand I of Le√≥n and Castile issued a foral in the 11th century (1055/1065) in order to fix the frontier. This foral, which pre-dated the Portuguese Kingdom, was the first to be issued for lands that today pertain to Portugal. Ansi√£es importance maintained itself, successively, resulting in various confirmations: by Afonso Henriques, Sancho I, Afonso II and a final foral, promulgated in 1510 by Manuel I. In addition to administrative and strategic roles, Ansi√£es controlled aspects of the regional economy; Ansi√£es, due its location and access to communication channels (relics of its Roman history), which rapidly transformed it into a \\"dry port\\" that served commercial interests in the area. Because of this, on 16 April 1277, it received a Market Charter (), signed by King Afonso III, that stipulated the towns right to have a monthly fair, at the end of every month, which lasted a day. It also guaranteed that those who attended the fair were secure (either coming or going to the event) three days before and after the fair. These privileges were granted by the monarchy in order to promote internal commerce, interpersonal relations, and enrich the kingdom's coffers. For this reason, the King suspended debts of those that attended the fairs, as well as imposing fines for those who swindled participants. Ansi√£es was encircled by a double- wall: the interior wall protected the administrative and military facilities, while the outer wall secured the local populous. There were four main gates. Of these, the Gate of S√£o Francisco (to the northeast), which served as the entranceway for horsemen and carts, while the Gate of S√£o Salvador linked the areas within the walls. During this epoch, the principal settlements were Ansi√£es, Vilarinho da Castanheira and Linhares, that included the ecclesiastical parishes of S√£o Salvador, S√£o Jo√£o, Santa Maria and S√£o Miguel. On 23 May 1320, a Bull by Pope John XXII, conceded to King Denis of Portugal a three-year war subsidy, from a tithe of ecclesiastical rents within his Kingdom, knowing that the parishes were taxed in large increments. Ansi√£es was also highlighted during the Portuguese Interregnum, after the death of King Ferdinand, when its population positioned themselves on the side of John I, the Master of Aviz, while Vilarinho da Castanheira supported the other pretender Beatrice. Local support was resolved with the Battle of Valdrange (1384), when Vasco Pires Sampaio's forces triumph over the pretenders subjects, and squarely aligned the region with John. When the new monarch assumed the throne, John travelled to the places where supporters had sworn allegiance to his Order, arriving on 23 October 1396 in Linhares, where he signed a regal proclamation. Diogo de Sampaio, donatorio of Ansi√£es, later accompanied with 14 squires and many infantrymen, supported King Afonso V in the Battle of Toro (1476), when he reclaimed the throne of Castile, and which resulted in Sampaio being honoured with the title of Alcaide-mor of Ansi√£es. This loyalty, which resulted in the motto Anci√£es leal ao Reyno de Portugal (Ansi√£es Loyal to the Kingdom of Portugal), also resulted in local unflinching support of Sebastian on his conquest of North Africa; many local residents joined the King at the Battle of Alc√°cer Quibir (1578). This episode was the origin of Ansi√£es' slow demographic decline, in addition to the eventual loss of autonomy: the people of Ansi√£es also supported Ant√≥nio, Prior of Crato against Philip II of Spain' Iberian Union, which disadvantaged it economically and socially. During the War of Spanish Succession (1704‚Äì15), Portugal joined the English, Dutch and Austrian Empires against Philip V, which included many men from the farms and villages of Ansi√£es. This was one of the last autonomic interventions of its residents, since in 1734 its administrative sovereignty was suppressed by its amalgamation with Carrazeda, its toponymy the only vestige of the municipal history. The Liberal Revolution of 1820, resulted in appeals from liberalist forces of Peter IV in Porto, arriving to swear allegiance to the 1822 Constitution years later. On 7 October 1910, during a meeting in the municipal hall: \\"[The President] congratulates the Government, the troops and the people of Lisbon for the victory achieved in the Implantation of Portuguese Republic and sends votes that she has a future in peace and order.\\" With the First World War, the municipality lost many lives during Portuguese participation, which included the loss of life in Infantry Regiment 30, stationed in Mozambique. The military coup on 28 May 1926, which ushered in the Estado Novo dictatorship was the impetus for the creation of the Comiss√£o da Alian√ßa Republicana Socialista (Commission for Republican Socialist Alliance) in which was established in Carrazeda de Ansi√£es. In 1974, once again, the municipal authorities joined together (9 May), to declare: \\"...unanimously, make it expressed in meeting notes, today, its support for the Movimento das For√ßas Armadas and manifest their entire confidence in the acts of the Junta de Salva√ß√£o Nacional, with entire concordance in the program presented.\\" Geography =Physical geography= Grapes ripening on the vine, emblematic of the wine region of the DouroThe municipality of Carrazeda de Ansi√£es is situated on the right margin of the Douro River, and left margin of its tributary, the Tua River. On the Douro it is fronted by the municipality of Torre de Moncorvo (at Cadima), dividing the parish of Vilarinho da Castanheira from the neighbouring parish of Lousa (in Torre de Moncorvo). The confluence of the Tua and Douro Rivers angle to the south in the settlement of Foz Tua, its rich waters separating Carrazeda de Ansi√£es from the municipalities of Alij√≥, Mur√ßa and Mirandela, in addition to S√£o Jo√£o da Pesqueira. Territorially, its limites are defined in the north, by Mur√ßa and Mirandela; to the northeast, by Vila Flor; south by the River Douro; east by Torre de Moncorvo; and west by the Tua River. Carrazeda de Ansi√£es pertains to the old district of Bragan√ßa (its municipal seat located to the extreme south), and is buttressed by the districts of Vila Real in the west and Viseu in the south, across the Douro, but within the region of the Tr√°s-os-Montes e Alto Douro. Carrazeda de Ansi√£es has a lot of its territory integrated within the Alto Douro, characterized by boxed-in valleys along the Douro and Tua Rivers, with steep inclines known for its wine-producing vineyards characteristic of Porto. The lands are covered in olive, almonds and fig orchards, in addition to peaches, wheat, pears, lands for the raising of dairy- and beef-cattle, sheep and honey production. Schists predominate this area. Meanwhile, the area of the main village (Carrazeda de Ansi√£es) lies on the Planalto de Carrazeda (Carrazeda Plateau), which extends until the municipalities of Vila Flor and Moncorvo (an extension of the Iberian Meseta), and is surrounded by mountains (which extend to 900 metres), such as the Serra da Reborosa, Serra da Fonte Longa, Serra da Senhora da Assun√ß√£o (Vilarinho da Castanheira) and the Serra da Senhora da Gra√ßa. The plateau zone of Carrazeda is the primary location of cereal production, the cultivation of potato, beans, corn, apple and chestnuts (which predominate), in addition to open- spaces interspersed by natural forests of pine, oak, cork oak and chestnut trees. =Climate= Carrazeda de Ansi√£es has a Warm-summer Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen: Csb) caracterized by cool winters and warm to hot summers with cool nights due to its altitude. =Human geography= Administratively, the municipality is divided into 14 civil parishes (freguesias): * Amedo e Zedes * Belver e Mogo de Malta * Carrazeda de Ansi√£es * Castanheiro do Norte e Ribalonga * Fonte Longa * Lavandeira, Beira Grande e Selores * Linhares * Marzag√£o * Parambos * Pereiros * Pinhal do Norte * Pombal * Seixo de Ansi√£es * Vilarinho da Castanheira Transport The locality is served by Tua Station on the Douro Valley railway line. Tua station was also the junction for the Tua line, a narrow gauge railway to Mirandela and (until 1991) further north to Bragan√ßa. The Tua line closed in 2008. Architecture Many of the municipalities architecture date to the late 19th century, in addition to the medieval structures that highlight the regions history. The Church of S√£o Salvador, dating to the 13th century, the church in the Romanesque-style, identifiable by its ornate entrance portico with sculpted images of the four evangelical saints in granite, is the most prominent example. Many of the villages are dotted by pillories marking the administrative authority of Kingdom, including the pelourinho de Ansi√£es (the oldest) dating to the 15th century, while the 18th century pillory of Carrazeda de Ansi√£es was erected after Ansi√£es was substituted as the municipal seat.

Volvo engine) Saracakis Group of companies is a major Greek commercial and industrial group, for two decades a traditional competitor to Biamax (between themselves the two companies virtually dominated the bus market in Greece). Two of the most talented Greek vehicle engineers who had worked for Biamax, A. Rizos and I. Dracoulis also worked for Saracakis, Dracoulis having designed the company's characteristic, recognizable 'Œ£' logo. History Ioannis Saracakis started his company in Thessaloniki in 1923 importing and selling vehicles and vehicle parts. In 1941 headquarters were moved to Athens, where the Group was formally created in 1954. Production of bus bodies on imported chassis started in 1962, but in 1966 the company introduced its own-developed chassis with Volvo engines. From then on, all Saracakis' own chassis types had designations starting with 'SB' (standing for 'Saracakis Brothers') the first being the SB55 line, on which a variety of city and inter-city buses were developed, followed by SB556, SB85 and SB95. Its first chassisless bus type was the SBAV of 1974, a type improved over the years up to the innovative SBAV90 of 1990. Exports were also made, mainly to the Middle East. In addition to building complete vehicles (which included light three-wheeler trucks), the company remained a major bus and truck body builder, also assembling 4x4's, tractors, motorbikes, construction equipment, etc. Its best known bus bodies on Volvo chassis were the articulated models for Athens and Thessaloniki (the company boasts the world's first low-floor articulated bus). Present situation Saracakis survived the storm of the early 1980s (opening of the market to used imports) that almost wiped out the Greek commercial vehicle industry, but its import and trading sectors became predominant. Construction of complete vehicles and other production activities has stopped. The company is the official importer and distributor for the Greek market of Honda motorcycles and cars, Mitsubishi Motors, Volvo Trucks and Bus, Komatsu, Volvo Penta, Volvo construction equipment, Kumho tyres, SDMO, Infinity, Titan, Apollo tyres and Massey Ferguson agricultural machinery. The Saracakis Atrotos (2002) with its body featuring the company's \\"stainless steel technique\\" was Saracakis's last original creation; it used imported Volvo (rather than company's own) chassis.

Maemi formed on September 4, 2003 from a disturbance in a monsoon trough in the western Pacific Ocean. It slowly intensified into Tropical Storm Maemi while moving northwestward, becoming a typhoon on September 8. That day, favorable conditions facilitated more rapid strengthening; the storm developed a well-defined eye and reached peak maximum sustained winds of 195 km/h (120 mph). While near peak intensity, Maemi decelerated and began turning to the north-northeast. Soon after, the eyewall passed over the Japanese island of Miyako-jima on September 10 and produced an air pressure reading of , the fourth-lowest recorded in the nation. Due to warm waters, Maemi was able to maintain much of its intensity before it made landfall just west of Busan, South Korea, on September 12. The typhoon became extratropical in the Sea of Japan the next day, although its remnants persisted for several days, lashing northern Japan with strong winds. The typhoon first affected the Ryukyu Islands of Japan. On Miyako-jima, strong winds damaged 104 buildings and left 95% of residents without power. Maemi caused heavy rainfall there, with rates of in an hour and in 24 hours, the latter setting a record. One person died on Miyako-jima after being struck by airborne debris. Elsewhere in Japan, the storm caused flights to be canceled, and rainfall-induced landslides blocked roads. There were two other deaths in Japan, and damage totaled ¬•11.3 billion yen (JPY, $96 million USD). Damage was heaviest in South Korea, particularly where it moved ashore. On Jeju Island, Maemi produced a peak wind gust of 216 km/h (134 mph) and a minimum pressure of , both setting records for the country; the pressure reading broke the longstanding lowest pressure set by Typhoon Sarah in 1959. Winds in Busan near the landfall location reached 154 km/h (96 mph), the second-highest on record. The port there sustained heavy damage, restricting exports in the months following the storm. Nationwide, the high winds destroyed about 5,000 houses and damaged 13,000 homes and businesses, leaving 25,000 people homeless. About 1.47 million households lost power, and widespread crop damage occurred, resulting in the poorest rice harvest in 23 years. Across South Korea, Maemi killed 117 people, and overall damage totaled ‚Ç©5.52 trillion won (KRW, US$4.8 billion). Meteorological history In early September 2003, a monsoon trough spawned a tropical disturbance near Guam. The system consisted of a disorganized area of convection, or thunderstorms, in an area of moderate wind shear. By September 4, the convection was becoming better organized around a weak low-level circulation. Despite the wind shear, the system continued to develop, becoming a tropical depression north of Chuuk State. At 0200 UTC on September 5, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, and later that day initiated advisories on Tropical Depression 15W just west of Guam. By that time, the convection had increased over the center. For the first week of its existence, the cyclone tracked generally northwestward, steered by a subtropical ridge to the north. Early on September 6, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and named it Maemi. With more favorable conditions, including lesser wind shear and enhanced outflow, the storm continued to intensify. The JMA upgraded Maemi to a severe tropical storm on September 7 and to typhoon status ‚Äì winds of over 119 km/h (74 mph) ‚Äì the next day. The JTWC had upgraded Maemi to typhoon status on September 7 after an eye feature appeared on satellite imagery. Also around that time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) began issuing advisories on the storm, giving it the local name \\"Pogi\\", although the typhoon would remain away from the country. On September 8, Maemi began undergoing rapid deepening due to enhanced outflow, aided by the flow of an approaching shortwave trough. At 1200 UTC on September 9, the JTWC estimated 1-minute sustained winds of 240 km/h (150 mph) and designated Maemi as a super typhoon. The next day, the same agency estimated peak winds of 280 km/h (175 mph) and gusts to 335 km/h (205 mph), the equivalent of a Category 5 on the Saffir- Simpson scale. At 1200 UTC on September 10, the JMA estimated peak 10-minute winds of 195 km/h (120 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of while the storm was 155 km (100 mi) southeast of the Japanese island of Miyako-jima. At peak intensity, Maemi was a small typhoon, with gale-force winds extending only 240 km (150 mi) from the well-defined eye. Around the time of peak intensity, Maemi was slowing its forward motion and began turning to the north, after the eastward-moving trough weakened the ridge. At 1900 UTC on September 10, the typhoon passed within 10 km (7 mi) of Miyako-jima. While the eye was passing over the island, the pressure fell to and winds reached 250 km/h (155 mph). Maemi weakened slightly as it continued north, passing about 220 km (140 mi) west of Okinawa on September 11 while undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle. Increasingly hostile conditions from the approaching trough caused further weakening, and the JTWC estimated the typhoon passed just east of Jeju Island with 1-minute winds of 185 km/h (115 mph) at 0600 UTC on September 12. Shortly after, Maemi made landfall just west of Busan, South Korea, with the JMA estimating 10-minute winds of 140 km/h (85 mph), and JTWC estimating 1-minute winds of 165 km/h (105 mph). Risk Management Solutions estimated landfall winds of 190 km/h (120 mph), which surpassed Typhoon Sarah in 1959. This made Maemi the strongest typhoon to strike the country since the Korea Meteorological Administration began keeping records in 1904. The storm was able to maintain much of its intensity due to warm sea surface temperatures and its fast forward motion. Maemi rapidly weakened to tropical storm status while moving over land, and was undergoing extratropical transition by the time it entered the Sea of Japan. Increasing wind shear removed the convection from the increasingly ill-defined circulation center. The JTWC issued its final warning on Maemi early on September 13, declaring the storm extratropical. The JMA followed suit later that day, tracking Maemi over northern Japan and declaring it extratropical over the Sea of Okhotsk. The remnants of Maemi persisted for several more days, until the JMA stopped tracking it on September 16 southwest of the Kamchatka Peninsula. According to the Mariners Weather Log, the remnants of Maemi continued to the east, eventually striking the coast of Alaska on September 21. Preparations In Japan, the threat of the typhoon caused airlines to cancel 145 flights, mostly in and around Okinawa. About 50 American army bases in Okinawa were closed, and non-essential workers were told to remain home. Before Maemi made landfall in South Korea, officials issued flood warnings along the Nakdong River due to dams opening floodgates. About 25,000 people were forced to evacuate, either to schools or relatives' houses. The Korea Meteorological Administration advised travelers to take precaution in advance of the storm. Ferry and airplane services were canceled to Jeju island, stranding residents ahead of the Chuseok holiday. Officials in Primorsky Krai in the Russian Far East issued a storm warning, noting the potential for strong winds and heavy rainfall. Impact =Japan= Typhoon Maemi over Ryukyu Islands on September 11 Typhoon Maemi first affected the Japanese island of Miyako-jima, where gusts reached 266 km/h (166 mph), and sustained winds reached 152 km/h (94 mph). For 16 hours, excluding the 2‚Äìhour passage of the eye, the pressure fell to , the second-lowest on record on the island after Typhoon Sarah in 1959, and at the time the fourth lowest in all of Japan. The typhoon produced heavy rainfall on Miyako-jima totaling , of which fell in 24 hours, breaking the daily record. Also on the island, fell in one hour, and fell in just 10 minutes. On the island, Maemi damaged 104 buildings, including two severely damaged houses. The storm damaged roads in 36 locations and caused a power outage, affecting about 20,900 people, or 95% of the island. One person on Miyako-jima died after being struck by flying glass. News agencies considered Maemi the strongest typhoon to affect Okinawa since 1968. Elsewhere in Okinawa Prefecture, wind gusts reached 109 km/h (69 mph) in Nago. On Ishigaki Island, strong winds damaged houses and crops, while high tides flooded low-lying buildings. Across the region, 94 people were injured, mostly from broken glass. Shortly before Maemi made its final landfall, it produced wind gusts of 167 km/h (104 mph) at Izuhara, a Japanese island halfway between South Korea and Japan. Along the southwest coast of Japan, a weather station in Hirado reported gusts of 113 km/h (70 mph). The typhoon resulted in heavy rainfall on the Japanese main island of Kyushu, reaching at a station in Miyazaki Prefecture. Rainfall-induced landslides in Nagasaki forced 191 people to evacuate their homes. Heavy rainfall also caused landslides in ≈åita Prefecture, and K≈çchi Prefecture, where several roads were closed. The threat of the storm caused schools to close in Yamaguchi Prefecture. The storm spawned an F1 tornado in K≈çchi that damaged several houses and flipped over a car, injuring a woman inside. As an extratropical storm, Maemi left 2,500 people in Hokkaido without power after producing gusts of 108 km/h (67 mph) in Hakodate. Wind gusts reached 116 km/h (72 mph) in Akita, the third-highest September wind gust at the station. A falling tree in Sapporo killed one person and injured two others. High waves damaged fisheries and 54 ships in Matsumae alone, and nationwide 262 ships were damaged. Rough seas also killed one person in Akita Prefecture. The typhoon destroyed 1,498 homes across the country and flooded 363 others. The storm also damaged of fields. In total, Maemi killed three people and injured 107 in Japan, two severely. Overall damage totaled ¬•11.3 billion (JPY, $96 million USD). =South Korea= Typhoon Maemi approaching South Korea on September 12 Since Typhoon Maemi took a path closer to the form of a parabolic, a typical pattern of typhoons from outbreak to extinction, it was relatively possible to predict its course and the possibility of landing on the Korean Peninsula was expected fairly early. The Korea Meteorological Administration officially announced the typhoon's possible landing off the southern coast of the Korean Peninsula at 5 p.m. on Sept. 10, making the news widely known through major media organizations. When Typhoon Maemi struck South Korea, it caused heavy rainfall that peaked at . Rainfall reached in Namhae County, and on Jeju Island. The rain was less widespread and caused less flooding than Typhoon Rusa, which struck the country a year prior, but damage from Maemi was heavier due to strong winds. On Jeju Island, Maemi produced a wind gust of 216 km/h (134 mph) and a minimum pressure of , both setting records for the country. The winds broke the record of 210 km/h (130 mph) set by Typhoon Prapiroon in 2000, and the pressure was 1.5 mbar lower than that during Typhoon Sarah in 1959, which was one of the strongest storms to strike South Korea after Maemi. On the South Korean mainland, the Pusan International Airport reported wind gusts of 143 km/h (89 mph). Winds in Busan reached 154 km/h (96 mph), the second-highest wind speed for the city after Typhoon Thelma in 1987. Due to high winds, five nuclear power plants were shut down automatically, but were ultimately unaffected. In South Korea, damage was heaviest in South Gyeongsang Province, where 71 people were killed. Damage was particularly heavy in Busan, as well in as Yecheon, Ulsan, and Daegu. In Busan, strong winds wrecked 11 lifting cranes, each weighing about 900 tons, which injured five people and killed two in one incident. Many shipyards in the region were closed, and initial reports estimated it would take a year to fully reopen the Busan port. The estimated damage to the Busan port was about $50 million (USD), causing cargo capacity to be cut by 20%. High waves turned a large ship on its side in Busan, and in Ulsan the waves knocked an offshore shipbuilding plant into a petroleum facility, damaging them both. Sixteen people were killed in Busan. Wrecked ship below Yeongdo Bridge, Busan, after Maemi Ship cafe wrecked by Typhoon Maemi, Busan, South Korea High tides flooded hundreds of houses along the coast, particularly in areas without seawalls. In Masan, the storm caused 12 fatalities when it flooded an underground shopping center. On Jeju Island to the south of the country, Maemi destroyed sets of the Korean drama TV series All In, and wrecked 32 houses. Two people were killed on the island, one of whom while attempting to secure his boat. Throughout the country, 465 boats were damaged or beached. The heavy rainfall caused mudslides, one of which in Chungcheong derailed a train, injuring 28 aboard. Mudslides closed several roads, and damaged five rail lines in ten locations. Nationwide, the storm damaged 2,278 roads and bridges, as well as nearly 40,000 cars. Intense rainfall also caused flooding along the Nakdong River, reaching a flood stage of near Busan. There, the river produced a discharge of about 13,000 m¬≥/s (460,000 ft¬≥/s), strong enough to destroy a section of the Gupo bridge. Along a tributary of the Nakdong River, floods destroyed a dyke near Daegu. Maemi also flooded of fields before the fall harvest, causing widespread damage to the rice crop. On Ulleungdo island off the eastern coast, Maemi washed away the primary road and many houses, killing three. Residents there complained about the lack of advance warning. Typhoon Maemi left about 1.47 million electric customers without power around the country, causing ‚Ç©12.9 billion (KRW, US$11.61 million) in damage to power companies. Widespread damage interrupted mobile and cell phone service. United States military bases in the country sustained about $4.5 million in damage. Nationwide, Maemi destroyed about 5,000 houses and damaged 13,000 homes and businesses, leaving 25,000 people homeless. About 150 businesses in Gangwon Province were destroyed by Typhoon Rusa in 2002, only to be destroyed again by Maemi when they were rebuilt. Insured damages from Maemi were estimated at ‚Ç©650 billion (KRW, $565 million), mostly property damage. The insured damage was over four times the amount of insured damage from Typhoon Rusa the year prior. Overall damage was estimated at ‚Ç©5.52 trillion (KRW, US$4.8 billion). By comparison, this total was ‚Ç©2.52 trillion (KRW, US$1.9 billion) less than Rusa; the discrepancy between the insured and overall damage was due to Maemi causing heavier industrial damage, while Rusa caused more damage overall. The storm killed 117 people throughout South Korea. =Elsewhere= Although the typhoon prompted the PAGASA to hoist warnings‚Äîand in spite of initial concerns that the cyclone would enhance monsoonal rainfall‚ÄîMaemi did not cause any damage in the Philippines. While recurving east of Taiwan, Maemi dropped significant rainfall, peaking at in Ilan County. The rains helped ease drought conditions and replenished parched reservoirs. In North Korea, Maemi produced about 186 mm (7.32 in) of rainfall, although further details of the storm's effects there were unknown due to press censorship. Aftermath Tropical Storm Maemi in the Sea of Japan on September 13 Following the storm, South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun declared the entire of the country excluding Seoul and Incheon as special disaster areas, after touring the storm damage in Busan. The government provided tax breaks and allocated ‚Ç©1.4 trillion (KRW, $1.2 billion) in assistance to the affected residents, after an additional budget was passed in late September 2003. This included ‚Ç©100 billion (KRW, US$90 million) in immediate funds for search and rescue missions. After the storm, residents complained they did not receive adequate warning and not enough coastal areas were evacuated, which led to the high death toll. Widespread damage and continued flooding caused traffic jams in the days following the storm. A damaged rail line prompted operators to provide alternate bus service. Landslides throughout the country forced travelers to use alternate routes. By three days after the storm, most damaged roads and highways were reopened. About 33,000 members of the South Korean Army were deployed to assist in relief efforts, such as clearing roads and delivering aid to storm victims. Workers quickly restored power to 95% of customers within 24 hours. The government installed four new cranes for the Busan port, and assisted operators to ensure exports would not be delayed. Heavy crop damage caused fruit and vegetable prices to rise, and fish and crop exports rose 9.2% on average. The rice harvest was the lowest in 23 years, due to the storm and a government effort to limit production. To assist farmers, the government increased purchases in federal contracts. Three government-run banks provided low-rate loans for businesses damaged by the storm. Residual flooding from Maemi contributed to an outbreak of conjunctivitis in the southern portion of the country. To prevent additional outbreaks, the Korean National Institute of Health sent 1,000 workers to storm-damaged areas. The Korea Stock Exchange fell 1.8% due to fears that storm damage would disrupt exports. For the month of September 2003, the Korea Electric Power Corporation waived electric bills for residents who lost their homes, and cut bills in half for residents and businesses who lost power. The South Korean government allowed companies to increase premiums for car insurance by 3.5% due to the widespread car damage. Due to storm damage, 34 companies were forced to temporarily close. Loss of production and disruptions were expected to subtract 0.5% from the forecast economic growth in 2003. The Consumer Confidence Index dropped to its lowest level in five years, largely due to the typhoon damage and weakened economic conditions. Following the strikes of Rusa and Maemi in consecutive years, the South Korean government worked on disaster management and mitigation programs. In March 2004, the government passed the \\"Emergency and Safety Management Basic Act\\", largely due to the storm as well as the Daegu metro fire, which effectively set up a nationwide emergency management system. The Gupo bridge damaged during the storm was repaired in 2007. Although the South Korean government did not request international aid, several countries sent aid to the country. A few days after Maemi struck, the United States Agency for International Development sent $50,000 (USD) to the Korean Red Cross. Later, the government of Japan sent ¬•9.5 million (US$85,000) worth of supplies to South Korea, including sleeping mats, generators, and water units. Taiwan also provided $100,000 in aid. The Republic of Korea National Red Cross utilized 700 volunteers and 200 staff members to distribute food and blankets to 8,190 houses, while local offices provided over 5,500 meals. Members of Food for the Hungry delivered food and clothing to storm-damaged residents in Masan. As a result of the damage and deaths caused by the storm, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Maemi in 2006 and replaced it with Mujigae.

Reuss played for eight teams in his major league career; along with the Dodgers (1979‚Äì87), he played for the St. Louis Cardinals (1969‚Äì71), Houston Astros (1972‚Äì73), and Pittsburgh Pirates (1974‚Äì78). At the end of his career (1987‚Äì90), he played for the Cincinnati Reds, California Angels, Chicago White Sox, Milwaukee Brewers, and the Pirates again (Reuss is one of only two Pirates to have played for Danny Murtaugh, Chuck Tanner, and Jim Leyland, the other being John Candelaria). In he became the second pitcher in history, joining Milt Pappas, to win 200 career games without ever winning 20 in a single season. Reuss is one of only 29 players in major league history to play in four different decades. Career Reuss was drafted in the second round of the 1967 Major League Baseball draft by the Cardinals after graduating from Ritenour High School in Overland, Missouri. He won his first Major League game in 1969, and became part of the starting rotation in 1970. In the spring of , Reuss wanted a raise from $17,000 to $25,000. Cardinals General Manager Bing Devine, under owner Gussie Busch's directive, was unwilling to give more than $20,000. Reuss also grew a mustache that raised Busch's ire. When Reuss refused to bend on the salary issue, Busch directed Devine to \\"get rid of him\\". Devine then traded Reuss to the Astros for pitcher Scipio Spinks and Lance Clemons. The trade looked like a fairly even swap at the time. While Spinks had shuttled between Houston and their top minor league affiliate, the Oklahoma City 89ers, over the last three years, he had been almost unhittable during his minor league stints. However, Spinks never recovered from a freak knee injury suffered on July 4, 1972 and was out of baseball by 1976. Reuss played two seasons before being traded to the Pirates after the season for Milt May after a season in which he led the National League in walks with 117. Reuss was a two time All-Star ‚Äì first in with the Pirates, having 18 wins and 11 losses that season and an earned run average of 2.54, and then again in with the Dodgers, striking out all three batters he faced in that year's game, and earning the win. In 1980 Reuss had one of the best seasons of his career with 18 wins and only six losses, and leading the majors in shutouts with six; he also threw a no-hitter against the San Francisco Giants on June 27, striking out only 2 batters, narrowly missing a perfect game due to a throwing error in the first inning by shortstop Bill Russell; Reuss's no-hitter is just one of ten in baseball history in which a pitcher did not walk or hit a batter, but whose perfect game bid was foiled by a fielding error. Reuss finished second behind Steve Carlton in the running for the Cy Young Award, and won Sporting News Comeback Player of the Year Award. In Reuss went 10-4 with a career-low 2.30 ERA in a strike-shortened season, and won two postseason games including one against the New York Yankees in the 1981 World Series, helping the Dodgers win the title. On June 11, 1982, Jerry Reuss recorded 27 consecutive outs in a game, with only the opponent's leadoff batter reaching base (double by Reds' Eddie Milner, who reached third on a sacrifice bunt and scored on a fielder's choice). Reuss had two more winning seasons with the Dodgers before injuries took their toll from to , and was released at the beginning of the season. He then played for the Reds, going 0-5 before getting released again, and then for the Angels before becoming a free agent. Reuss then signed with the Chicago White Sox, having a 13-9 season and earning his 200th career win in 1988, and played a few more seasons before retiring in 1990. Retirement Reuss in September 2008 Reuss became a baseball broadcaster, working nationally for ESPN from 1991 to 1993, and was also a color commentator for the California/Anaheim Angels from 1996-98. He served as a pitching coach with the minor league Iowa Cubs before returning to broadcasting with the Dodgers from 2006-2008, serving as a color commentator alongside Rick Monday. Jerry has also broadcast for the Las Vegas Stars (1994, 1995, and 1999), the Las Vegas 51's (2005-2018) and the Las Vegas Aviators (2019-current). In 2014, Reuss's autobiography, Bring In the Right Hander!, was published by University of Nebraska Press. Library Journal called Reuss \\"a gifted storyteller\\" who describes \\"what it's like to be both an aspiring teenage ballplayer newly signed to a contract and a 40-year-old athlete clinging to the baseball life he loves so much.\\" On January 31, 2016, Jerry was inducted into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame located in Springfield, Missouri. Jerry was also inducted into the St. Louis Sports Hall of Fame on May 23, 2019.

Legal custody of a child may or may not be involved, and the child may be related by blood, marriage, or adoption. This arrangement is also known as \\"kincare\\" or \\"relative care.\\" Kinship placement may reduce the number of home placements children experience; allow children to maintain connections to communities, schools, and family members; and increase the likelihood of eventual reunification with birth parents. It is less costly to taxpayers than formal foster care and keeps many children out of the foster care system. \\"Grandfamily\\" is a recently coined term in the United States that refers to families engaged in kinship care.http://www.grandfamiliesofamerica.com, http://www.grandfamilies.org In 2010, there were 7.8 million children who live in households where the heads were grandparents or other relatives and parents were not present. In 2012, according to the Annie E. Casey Foundation Kids Count Data Center, there were 2.7 million children or 4% of all children who are being raised by grandparents or other kinship care. According to a 2003 U.S. Census Bureau report, 2.4 million grandparents had primary responsibility for their coresident grandchildren younger than 18. Among grandparent caregivers, 39 percent had cared for their grandchildren for 5 or more years. 594,000 grandparents nationally are raising children below the federal poverty level. Relatives care for a quarter of all children in foster care in the United States.Adoption and Foster Care Analysis Reporting System, http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/cb/systems/index.htm Kinship =Kinship children= According to the 2010 U.S. Census, almost 7.8 million U.S. children live in homes under kinship care. There are many reasons that a parent may be unwilling or unable to care for their child, including death, incarceration, illness, substance abuse and financial instability. Many kinship children are placed by child protective services (CPS) agencies after removing the child from the biological home. This can also happen in family court without CPS being involved. When CPS removes children, local children services will seek out relative placements before placing a child in non- relative foster care. Most kinship children have experienced some form of trauma that resulted in estrangement from their natural families. Kinship children may have been victims of abuse and neglect in the biological home, exhibit signs of post-traumatic stress disorder, have special needs or disabilities resulting from in utero substance abuse, be in need of counseling or other support services, or require specialized social and educational services. =Kinship caregivers= Kinship caregivers may be grandparents, great-grandparents, siblings, aunts, uncles, or family friends of the children in their care. Caregivers often feel responsible for extended family members and prefer to care personally for relative children who may otherwise end up in non-relative foster care. In many cases, grandparents and other relatives have not planned for the addition of children to the home, and may have problems accessing social and educational services that have changed drastically since they raised their own children. Some caregivers experience feelings of guilt and social isolation resulting from fear of the perception that one failed in raising one's own child. Caregivers may be hesitant to pursue legal custody of children in their care if they want to maintain relationships with the child's biological parent, or if they view the arrangement as temporary. Grandfamilies face obstacles not encountered by biological parents such as obtaining medical and educational services for the children in their care and securing affordable housing in which they can live with the children. Many of the public assistance benefits available to birth parents and foster families are not available to kinship caregivers even if the child was receiving assistance in the parent's home. Some states offer \\"subsidized guardianship\\" payments for kinship families with children placed through children services agencies or foster care agencies, although these payments are substantially less than payments that non-relative foster families receive. Financial issues are common for many older grandparents and great-grandparents who are living on fixed incomes, Social Security or disability payments, who did not plan to raise children late in life, or who are raising children with demanding educational or medical needs. The prevalence of these financial issues has led to a high rate of food insecurity, job loss and home foreclosure in families who support additional children without adequate financial and service assistance. The obstacles can be even greater in \\"informal\\" care arrangements, where the relative caregiver lacks a legal relationship (such as legal custody or guardianship) with the child. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, less than 20% of children raised by grandparents have legal custody arrangements.U.S. Census Bureau, https://www.census.gov/ Some states have established avenues towards legal guardianship for grandparent caregivers who are informally caring for children. Ohio's HB 130, the Grandparent Affidavit and Power of Attorney Bill,Public Children Services Association of Ohio, http://www.pcsao.org/In%20The%20News/3.04%20HB%20130%20Outline%20Final2.pdf establishes two legal mechanisms to assist caregivers to access educational and medical services for children in their residential care as an alternative to intrusive children services intervention or expensive legal processes. This type of temporary guardianship is preferred by families who hope for eventual reunification of birth parents and biological children. Recent legislation, the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008, P.L. 110-351 includes several provisions affecting kinship families. The legislation authorizes federal funding of subsidized guardianship payments, establishes kinship navigator programs to assist caregivers in accessing community assistance and support services for the children in their care, requires notice be given to adult relatives when a child enters care, and allows states more flexibility with licensing standards when placing a child with a relative. The AARP and Generations United both maintain searchable online databases of kinship programs in the United States.AARP, http://www.aarp.org/families/grandparents/raising_grandchild/Generations United, http://ipath.gu.org//Kinsh6261201.asp = Types of Kinship Care = There are four different types of Kinship Care. Informal Kinship Care means that living arrangement of the child was created by the parents and other family members without the help of the court or child welfare agencies. An example of this care could be if the parents are ill and can no longer care for their children, so a relative like a grandparent, aunt or uncle may care for the children until the parents recover. Temporary Guardianship occurs when the parent of a child plans to temporary leave their children with a relative. This type also requires the parents to consult an attorney and the attorney will write up papers to be sent to the court for a judge to approve. During this time of temporary guardianship, the relatives who were granted this type of kinship can make decisions for the children in the sectors of medical and education. Voluntary Kinship Care occurs when the child was placed in the home or a relative and the child welfare agency is involved. Examples of circumstances that result in this type of kinship care include; if there are signs of abuse or neglect by the parents, and while parents are in treatment for substance abuse or mental health issues, parents can place their children with relatives with the help of child welfare workers. Formal Kinship Care. In this type of kinship care, \\"the child is placed in the legal custody of the State by a judge and the child welfare places the child with family members.\\" The state will remain having legal custody of the child and the relatives will have physical custody, which means they must support the child financially and give them a home. If the parents and relatives agree on the child visiting their parents or siblings, the child welfare agency is responsible for creating the visits and making sure that the visits happen. With this type of kinship care, the relatives become the foster parents of the child. =Mental development of children in kinship care= The first few years are crucial for early childhood, during which children develop rapidly. The relationships established with their caregivers predict children's later performance in social lives, marriage relationships and relationships with their own children.Messina, S. L. (2013). Grandmother kinship care: The relation between grandmother's experiences as a primary caregiver and young children's development Therefore, it is important to understand the quality of kinship care in terms of mental development of children to see how these early relationships influence children socially, emotionally and cognitively and further impact school readiness. Studies that have examined custodial kinship families have reported high prevalence of poverty and low educational levels compared with other family arrangement.Dunifon, R. (2013). The influence of grandparents on the lives of children and adolescents. Child Development Perspectives,7(1), 55-60. As such, kinship caregivers are often associated with high level of strain when playing caring and rearing role to children. These obstacles are less energy, limited financial resource, and more health problems and concerns. Besides, psychological challenges include difficulties of re-entering parent roles, implementing effective disciplinary strategies, dealing with relationship among children, caregivers and biological parents, and overcoming a generation gap. These multi-aspect factors potentially influence children in kinship care and expose them to more mental health risks. A study of 733 custodial grandmothers and 9,878 caregivers from the 2001 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) who completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) reported that children raised by grandparents have more behavioral and emotional disturbances than children in the overall U.S. population. Among the subjects, major Caucasian custodial grandparents reported more difficulties with the children than African American grandparents. The white grandparents often report their grandchildren with behavior problems of argumentative, impulsive and depressed characteristic, school withdraw, less independent, and low self-esteem, while black grandparents report their custodial children had lied or cheated, were disobedient at school, destroyed things, and got into fightsSmith, G. C., & Palmieri, P. A. (2007). Risk of psychological difficulties among children raised by custodial grandparents.Psychiatric Services, 58(10), 1303-1310.Ôºâ. Another study of 59 New York custodial grandparent families reported that more than half of the children have developed some level of health conditions, among the most common conditions were attention deficit disorders.Dunifon, R., & Kopko, K. (2011). Relationship quality and parenting among grandparent caregivers and teens. Other studies found high incidence of behavioral problems of kinship care than other family arrangements. In school settings, children being raised by grandparents have higher rates of suspension and expulsion and lower engagement than children living with parents. A 2016 systematic review of 102 quasi-experimental studies involving 666,161 children found kinship care to be a viable option for the well being of children removed from home for maltreatment. = Strength of kinship care = Kinship care also has many sources of strength. Kinship families that often have a history of support create a more sustainable and stable emotional tie with children, and thus improve well-being of the whole family. Older caregivers tend to provide wisdom and knowledge gained through experience, gratitude for having a second chance at raising children, and having more time to spend with children. In terms of well-being of children, it is important to help them building up personal and cultural identity. Children in kinship care are placed within a social class and culture familiar to them and have more contact with relatives who reinforce their self-identities, self-esteem and the sense of belonging with shared family history, routine and rituals. Also children in kinship care experience fewer placements than non-kinship care children, remain in the community they familiar with, and are exposed to less risk factors associate with unstable physical and mental environment. Besides, they have relatively more contact with their biological parents, from whom they receive compensative social and financial support than non-kinship care children. Kinship care children enjoy a functional social network from local community other than ‚Äúcold-blooded‚Äù professional assistance by governmental department that associated with severe neglect before placement. A healthy and natural local community compensate for the poor utilization of medical and educational services due to low level of educational status of kinship parents, especially grandparents. It also lower the risks of receiving peer pressure, isolation, social stigma and enable children maintaining sustainable network in school and leisure settings.Holtan, A., R√∏nning, J. A., Handeg√•rd, B. H., & Sourander, A. (2005). A comparison of mental health problems in kinship and nonkinship foster care. European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, 14(4), 200-207. For kinship care children who keep contact with their biological parents, biological parents continue playing their role in the relationships among kinship parents, biological parents and children. One study shows that 88% of teens being raised by a grandparent have some contact with at least one of their parents, whereas 64% of the children interviewed in another study saw their mother at least each year; many of these children's mothers lived nearby and had regular contact with their children. These studies indicate that biological parents‚Äô role can be disturbing, often seen as inconsistent involvement breaking up trust and confidence of children, legal wrangling and undermining grandparents‚Äô rules, leading to less effective parenting on the part of the grandparent. = Child Welfare System involvement with kinship care = The Child Welfare System and Kinship Care tend to go hand in hand in most cases. From state to state, the child welfare system are different from one another, but they always include departments that focus on social services or children's services. Each agency contains Caseworkers who are normally Social Workers who are required by law to help create a safe environment, better the well being and create permanent living arrangements for children. The involvement of the child welfare system in kinship care varies from State to State due to each state having their own laws and practices that govern these situations. A caseworker within the department of Social Services or Children's services will be the first to approach grandparents or other relatives when the individuals want to become a kinship caregiver. Families are also able to contact their local welfare agencies when seeking help. \\" Assistance for grandparents and relatives raising children In many U.S. states, financial and service assistance programs that are available to birth parents and foster families are not available to kinship caregivers based on the family relationship to the child. Some states have more kinship support services in place than others, but the following financial assistance is available to qualified caregivers nationwide. In the United Kingdom kinship carers get less help than people fostering or adopting children. Kinship carers can be pushed into debt, poverty, poor health or even homelessness. Judith Blake of the Local Government Association‚Äôs children and young people's Board, said councils were ‚Äúdoing what they can‚Äù supporting kinship carers in the face of severe pressure on children‚Äôs services‚Äô budgets. ‚ÄúGovernment needs to ensure that councils receive the long-term, consistent funding they need to make sure all children and families are able to thrive.‚ÄùKinship carers left with debt and ill health for 'doing the right thing' The Guardian Supportive services The National Family Caregiver Support Program (NFCSP) became law in 2000 under the reauthorization of the Older Americans Act and provides funding for supportive services to grandfamilies. Reauthorized and amended in 2006, NFCSP provides federal funding for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration on Aging (AoA) to administer the program. The AoA funds local Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs) to provide supportive services to grandparents and other relatives aged 55 and older who are relative caregivers of children. Supportive services fall into 5 categories designated by NFCSP: #information to caregivers about available services; #assistance to caregivers in gaining access to the services; #individual counseling, organization of support groups, training to assist the caregivers in the areas of health, nutrition, financial literacy, and in making decisions and solving problems relating to their caregiving roles; #respite care to enable caregivers to be temporarily relieved from their caregiving responsibilities; and #supplemental services, on a limited basis, to complement the care provided by caregivers.Generations United. (2007) \\"Fact Sheet: Grandparents and Other Relatives Raising Children:Their Inclusion in the National Family Caregiver Support Program \\" = Services available for kinship families = When fostering children or raising your relatives children it can become expensive. \\"According to the 2002 Urban League and the National Survey of American Families, over 50% of children in kinship care live in low-income housing.\\"Depending on the families circumstances they may be eligible for the following services: * The Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF)- This program provides financial assistance for low-income families. The goal for this program is to help the families that use it, become self-sufficient. * Food Stamps- This program helps families who are low-income afford groceries each month. The amount the families are eligible for are determined by the size of the family and their income. * Supplemental Security Income (SSI)- This program helps children who are disabled in kinship care. The eligibility is based solely on whether the child is disabled, and helps with the living expenses of the child. * Foster Care Payments- This program may be available to kinship families under certain circumstances and \\"the requirements for receiving these payments vary from state to state.\\" Due recent changes and the passage of the Fostering Connections Act, states have more options when using title IV-E funds for kinship guardian payments. Funding =Child-only TANF funds= The federal government has set aside Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) funding in all U.S. states to support working families with children under a certain income level. While eligibility to receive regular TANF funds is dependent on a family's annual household income and employment status, a \\"Child-Only\\" version is available nationally. This Child-Only grant only takes into consideration the income level of the dependent child, not the work or income eligibility of the caregiver. Some sort of temporary or permanent custody is required through juvenile court, Children Services, or another foster care agency to apply for the TANF Child-Only grant. TANF funding can be obtained through county Job and Family Services facilities. Tax credits Families must meet income requirements that depend on the number of children they are raising. Caregivers do not have to be the child's legal guardian or custodian, and the child doesn't have to be defined as the caregiver's dependent by the IRS. The child must be your biological child, grandchild, stepchild, foster or adoptive child, sibling, or a descendant of one of these. The child must have lived with you for more than half of the filing year and be under the age of 19, a full-time student under the age of 24, or totally disabled. =Child and dependent care credit= Child and Dependent Care Credit helps families who pay for child care so that they can work or look for work. The dollar amount of the credit depends on the number of children in the family, the annual household income, and the amount of money paid annually for child care. Caregivers do not have to be the child's legal guardian or custodian, but the child must be defined as the caregiver's dependent by the IRS. =Child tax credit= Child Tax Credit offers a tax credit of up to $1000 per child. The maximum income allowable to receive this credit is fairly high, so many families who are over-income for other programs may be eligible. The qualifying child must be younger than 17. Caregivers do not have to be the child's legal guardian or custodian, but the child must be defined as a dependent by the IRS. = Qualifications for Child Tax Credit = According to Turbo Tax, there are seven factors that determine who qualifies for the Child Tax Credit. First, the child must be under the age of 17 years old at the end of the tax year you are filing for. Second, the child must be related to the individual filing for Child Tax Credit. Examples of relationships are, ‚Äúthe child is their own child, stepchild or a foster child. When looking at other children within the individual‚Äôs family, they can also claim brothers, sisters, stepbrothers and sisters and also nieces, nephews and grandchildren.‚Äù When looking at the financial support the child has, ‚Äúthe child cannot be making more than half of their own income.‚Äù This means, the child cannot be financially stable on their own, otherwise the individual filing for the Child Tax Credit may not qualify. The child must be your dependent, which means the individual filing for the tax credit must be supporting them financially throughout the tax year. The child must also be a United States Citizen. Another qualification is that the child must be living with the individual filing for more than 6 months out of the year the tax credit is being filed for.

Background  The Bugojno group was organized by the Croatian Revolutionary Brotherhood (Hrvatsko revolucionarno bratstvo or HRB). The HRB was formed in Australia in 1961 and was active in Europe and the United States. The founding principle of the HRB was the separation of Croatia from Yugoslavia, and the reestablishment of the Independent State of Croatia through violence.  Operation Phoenix  After the suppression of the Croatian Spring movement in 1971, the HRB believed that there existed in Croatia a political climate which would support the beginning of an armed rebellion. After short preparations, the HRB organized their personnel, weapons and funding to support an initial group to start a rebellion. Most of the fighters and money came from Australia while the armed training was done in West Germany. After a short preparation in Austria, the 19-member group traveled through Dravograd into Yugoslavia by truck (the driver of which later reported them to police), on June 20, 1972. The Yugoslav territorial defense units soon began a massive search to find them. The insurgents were armed with M-16 and HK G-3 rifles. The group was named after the Bosnian town of Bugojno, as their goal was to reach the mountain of Radu≈°a south of the town. The operation was called \\"Phoenix\\" by the Croatian militants, while the counterinsurgency operation carried out by the Yugoslav forces bore the codename \\"Radu≈°a 72\\". = Main actions = The Yugoslav Army had no special forces at its disposal, and relied exclusively on some 30,000 poorly trained conscript soldiers and reservists units for the search. The first clash with the security forces took place on June 25 at the edge of a wood near Uskoplje (Gornji Vakuf). The group successfully drove back a team of 30 Yugoslav troops and policemen, killing the officer in charge, captain Milo≈° Popoviƒá, and a soldier. Two other soldiers were wounded. The group, however, fled in disarray as their own commander, Adolf Andriƒá, was also killed in the action. Three other members were caught over the next 24 hours. Although forced to hide, the insurgents managed to regroup near Ramsko Lake. Cornered once more by 1,000 territorial defense soldiers, the rebels were dispersed and compelled to seek shelter among the civilian population. During the withdrawal, one unit of the territorial defense was ambushed by the militants in a forest clearing near their hideout, a cave in the surroundings of Rumboci, a village on the northern shores of Ramsko Lake, in the region of Bukovac. Nine Yugoslav soldiers were killed, one of them after being captured. The paramilitaries headed for Sinj and Imotski, in Croatia, where they became decimated in a series of ambushes and counter-ambushes with Yugoslav forces. With the help of an informer the Bugojno group was eventually apprehended by July 24.  Aftermath  The Yugoslav losses were 13 killed in action and 14 wounded. Of the 19 members of the group, 15 were killed, 10 in action, whilst 5 were summarily executed after having surrendered. The last four members of the group were captured, tried and sentenced on December 21, 1972. Ludvig Pavloviƒá, who was a minor at the time, was sentenced to 20 years in prison, and the remaining three were executed by firing squad on March 17, 1973, at the Police headquarters in Sarajevo. Pavloviƒá was released from prison in 1990 and was killed in controversial circumstances during the Croatian War of Independence on September 18, 1991.

It is situated on the River Nore south of Kilkenny city, in the centre of the county. Bennettsbridge is a census town, and has population of 745 as of the 2016 census. The village is on the R700 road at a stone bridge crossing of the Nore between Kilkenny and Thomastown. It has become a craft centre in recent years, with several pottery and craft producers located at the old mill beside the weir. The village is part of the parish of Tullaherin which contains an almost intact 9th-century round tower.  History  Bennettsbridge‚Äîview from the pottery weir Bennettsbridge owes its name to Saint Benet and its strategic importance to its position at a major crossing of the river Nore. The first bridge was built on the site in 1285 and was dedicated to the saint, and was important for transport until the establishment of the railway. The current bridge dates from the 18th century after the original bridge was swept away in a flood in 1763. There were flour-mills at the weir and there was a Royal Irish Constabulary police station in the village.  Geography  Bennettsbridge is located along the river Nore at a ford of the river about from Gowran. There are two old mills downstream from the bridge. Ducks and swans and other river life are present in abundance. Transport Fortified police station =Road= Bennettsbridge lies on the R700 regional road which carries much tourist traffic in the summertime from the Rosslare ferries, through Kilkenny and on into the midlands and Galway. =Bus= The village is served daily by Bus √âireann route 73 (Waterford ‚ÄìKilkenny- Athlone). Kilbride Coaches' New Ross to Kilkenny route provides two journeys each way daily but none on Sundays. The first journey arrives into Kilkenny at 08.30 and the last return journey is at 18.00 making commuting possible. On Thursdays Bus √âireann route 374 provides a journey in each direction along the same route.

Nowadays the nearest rail station is Kilkenny railway station around 9 kilometres distant.  Landmarks  = Bennett's Bridge = Bennett's Bridge, in Bennettsbridge, over the River Nore There is record of Bennett's Bridge in 1393, when John Midleton, guardian of the chapel of St. Mary received licence to fortify the bridge. The ancient viaduct was destroyed by the great flood of 1793. The flood washed away many of the major bridges crossing the River Nore and so a comprehensive rebuilding programme was initiated in the eighteenth century. Kilkenny architect William Robertson worked on it in 1826, with the design of the bridge attributed (according to the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage) to George Smith. Other bridges, built or rebuilt in the same period, include Green's Bridge in Kilkenny City, Thomastown Bridge on the River Nore, Graiguenamanagh Bridge on the River Barrow, Inistioge Bridge on the Nore, Goresbridge on the Barrow, and the bridge at Mount Juliet. =Parks and recreation= Nore Valley Park, 3.2 km from Bennettsbridge, includes a camping and caravan park, activity centre, open farm, farm trail, crazy golf course and a picnic and barbecue area.Nore Valley Park There is lake fishing at Wallslough Village.

DAW Books published the remaining titles, inaugurating the \\"Elemental Masters\\" moniker and numeration. Hence Serpent's Shadow is the first numbered title in the series.  * In addition to the main books, two anthologies (Elemental Magic released in December 2012, and Elementary released in December 2013) have been published, containing works by various fantasy and science fiction authors set in the Elemental Masters universe.http://www.isfdb.org/cgi- bin/pl.cgi?400975http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pl.cgi?440098 World The setting of the \\"Elemental Masters\\" is an alternative Earth during the early 1900s. The main and perhaps sole difference between this world and our reality is that magic exists, controlled by those who have mastery over the four classical elements (fire, air, water, earth). The majority of the tales take place in England, with The Fire Rose taking place in North America and focusing on the San Francisco area, while Blood Red and From a High Tower are set in Germany, with a focus on the Black Forest. While history does tend to follow the real-life time line, historic calamities such as the Great Chicago Fire and the earthquake in San Francisco are attributed to the elemental mages that serve as the series namesakes. Also the 1918 flu pandemic is hinted in Phoenix and Ashes to be due to the machinations of a malevolent Master. Magic The world of the \\"Elemental Masters\\" is home to two main types of magic: the elemental magic that plays an important part in the series and ESP that is largely explored in The Wizard of London. There have been mentions of different types and degrees of magical ability in the series. =Elemental magic= Elemental magic is the most commonly seen form of magic in the series, with every book having at least a couple of elemental masters as major characters, with one serving as the antagonist. The masters' abilities are tied with their ability to see and control spirits of a particular elemental affinity. Different regions of the world have different Elementals. Elemental magicians are classed by their affinity (Earth, Air, Fire, and/or Water) and by their mastery of their magic; one can be an Elemental Magician or an Elemental Master. It is mentioned in Blood Red that there is a fifth kind of magic, Spirit, which has no Masters, as the Masters of this element would be able to control the very angels of heaven, and as such no master can be born of this element. This is later proven to not be the case in \\"A Study In Sable\\", which features a Master of Spirit who uses a violin to summon spirits and communicate with them. The Power of Ice and Necromancy The power of Ice can be the seen as a partial exception of the normal abilities of an Elemental mage. Ice can be controlled by a skilled master of Fire, with cold being the inverse of heat. As seen in The Wizard of London, the power of ice is seen as a perversion and innately destructive, as it calls for a basic twisting of a master's nature as well as the world around them. Similarly, Necromancy, the power of death, in Unnatural Issue is a destructive perversion of the power of Earth. If Water and Air have similar perversions, we have not yet seen them. =The Talented= Most of the details given about the talented (those who have some degree of psychic abilities) are seen in The Wizard of London. While the talented in most part fit the descriptions and abilities given psychics in the modern world, there are two main differences. First, certain psychics are able to gain familiars; the second difference is that powerful talents or the talented have psychic Avatars that represent their duties as champions of the light. These avatars tend to draw imagery from fiction and the past. =Sensitives= Details are given in Reserved for the Cat. Sensitives are those who do not have direct magical talents but are able to see and feel to a degree, magic cast by the Elemental Wizards. Some are capable of seeing and sometimes communicating with elemental spirits. Some sensitives may also cast small magics that are often based on emotions. A powerful Sensitive can use their powers to influence people. Sensitives often form the bulk of an Elemental Wizards's household. =Other forms of magic= While psychics, wizards and elemental masters are portrayed as the more common magic users in the western world, the series also focuses on other forms of power such as the Hindu sorcerers of India and the various spirits of the world (such as the fey of England and avatars of the Hindu gods).Lackey, Mercedes. The serpents's shadow - Young Adult Review - Book Review  Kliatt  Find Articles at BNET.com =Variation on fairy tale models= Each book in the series is loosely based on a famous fairy tale. However, female protagonists in the books are noticeably stronger and more assertive than the fairy tale characters on which they are modeled. The Serpent's Shadow, The Gates of Sleep and Phoenix And Ashes are each based on fairy tales (Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella, respectively) in which a girl faces the malevolence of an older and far more powerful woman, before being saved by the intervention of a Prince. In Lackey's novels, the equivalent character does not merely wait passively to be saved, and rather takes an active role in fighting for herself, on equal terms with the male character. Much of this fierce fighting takes place in astral form, when the original fairy tale female was completely passive in deep sleep or coma.

Vocalist Howard Jackson was replaced by John Grant after Jackson failed to turn up to a band rehearsal at a squat in Battersea. John Grant was there along with And Sex Gang & Grant jumped in to help out on vocals & was hired on the spot. Their original bassist, Green, died of a heroin overdose and was temporarily replaced on bass by Grant's roommate, Andi Sex Gang, for a show at the Latchmere Pub in Battersea. Stan Stammers, a former Epileptics bassist, joined in 1979, and guitarist Steve MacIntosh was replaced by Andy \\"Heed\\" Forbes. Drummers in this period included Luke Rendal (previously of Crisis) and the short-lived member Cliff Warby. Stammers and Rendal left to form Theatre Of Hate with Kirk Brandon, while Forbes left to join the Wall. For the recording of the Straps' debut single, 1980's \\"Just Can't Take Anymore\\" (Donut Records), the lineup was Grant, Reeves and three former members of the Pack: Jim Walker (also original drummer of Public Image Ltd.) and brothers Jonathan and Simon Werner. The same lineup recorded their second single, \\"Brixton,\\" likewise released in 1982 on Walker's Donut label. The band's debut album was issued in 1982 on the Cyclops label. The album featured UK Subs drummer Pete Davies (Walker only played on one track, departing for the Human Condition) and guest appearances by Andi Sex Gang and the Damned's Rat Scabies. The Straps enjoyed a cult following around London, and performed alongside the Damned on their 1980 Black Album tour, as well as Sham 69 and Stiff Little Fingers, before splitting in 1983. Frontman Grant and Simon Werner later formed Bartok with Jah Wobble, recording a 12\\" single, \\"Insanity\\" (1983). Grant went on to form Freakshow 1984, performing around the UK without any record releases. The Straps reformed in 1991 for a one-off gig at the Brixton Academy with other original punk bands including Sham 69, UK Subs and the Lurkers. In 2005, Captain Oi! Records) issued a Straps compilation, The Punk Collection, and the reunited band (including Grant, Reeves, Stuart Phillips on guitar, Mark Hobbs on bass and Lloyd Dudley on drums) released the limited-edition album In Love With the New World Order to coincide with that year's Rebellion Festival performance. The Straps played the Rebellion Festival three years running, until Grant suffered an accidental knee injury, and they separated again in 2008. The band returned to the UK gig scene in 2012 for the ill-fated Last Jubilee and Punk by the Sea festivals, with a new lineup of Grant, Reeves, Pete Davies (UK Subs) and two new members: ex-Concrete Gods guitarist Phil McDermott and Morgellons bassist Mark Geraghty. As well as playing a now infamous DIY show in Southsea with Sham 69, UK Subs, Vice Squad and the Defects, this lineup played the legendary 100 Club with Chelsea and sold out a headline show at Camden's Barfly.

Brook Benton version In 1969, after several years without a major hit, Benton had signed to a new record label, Cotillion Records (a subsidiary of Atlantic Records), by label A&R; chief and producer Jerry Wexler. Benton recorded the song in November 1969 with arranger/producer Arif Mardin. Session personnel on the record included Billy Carter on organ, Dave Crawford on piano, Cornell Dupree and Jimmy O'Rourke on guitar, Harold Cowart on bass, Tubby Ziegler on drums, and Toots Thielemans on harmonica. Included on his \\"come-back\\" album Brook Benton Today, the melancholy song became an instant hit. In the spring of 1970, the song had topped the Billboard Best Selling Soul Singles chart. It also reached number four on the Billboard Hot 100, and number two on the Adult Contemporary chart. In Canada, the song made #2 on the RPM Magazine Hot Singles chart, #2 on the AC Chart, and #58 in the 1970 Year End Chart. The RIAA certified the single gold for sales of one million copies. In 2004, it was ranked #498 on the List of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. Covers The song has been covered by a number of musicians, including Ray Charles, Otis Rush, Gil Parris, Little Milton, Dolla, Hearts Of Stone, Randy Crawford, George Benson, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Al Hirt, Johnny Rivers, Amos Garrett, Hank Williams Jr.(#21 Can.), Nat Stuckey, a Conway Twitty/Sam Moore duet (#33 Can.), Arthur Prysock, Aaron Neville, Chris Young, Ana Popovic, The Street People, and Shelby Lynne. Randy Crawford's version from the album Secret Combination reached No. 18 in the UK Singles Chart in 1981. David Ruffin recorded a cover version of the song the same year as Benton, but Motown did not release the album until 2004.David Ruffin - David on Motown MS 733, 2004 B.J. Thomas also recorded the song the same year as Benton for his album Most of All. Several reggae covers have been recorded including ones by: Ken Parker, Lord Tanamo, Nicky Thomas, John Holt, and reggae bands The Gladiators, Manna, and The Congos. In 1967 Prince Buster rewrote the lyrics and recorded a sexually explicit reggae version of this song called \\"Big Five\\", usually found with certain words bleeped out. Gregory Isaacs did a dancehall style version at the start of the 90s. More recent covers include those by indie folk-rock band Hem from their album No Word from Tom (2006), and by Boz Scaggs from his album Memphis (2013). Australian band Ross Hanniford Trio recorded a cover of the song on their 1994 album. In 2000, guitarist Eric Essix covered the song on his album Southbound. An electronic- influenced downtempo/chillout version was recorded by Boozoo Bajou and Tony Joe White in 2006. Rod Stewart included the song on his 2009 album Soulbook. Singer Frank Shiner released the song as the first single and video from his 2017 album Lonely Town, Lonely Street. The song is featured in Haruki Murakami's novel Hear the Wind Sing.

The commission that the agent receives is usually a percentage of this figure, although some firms like Merrill Lynch use figures called Production Credits, usually smaller than GDC, to determine payouts and retain more revenue. For example, a mutual fund with a 5.75% sales charge is sold to someone who invests $10,000. $575 GDC is created by the sale, and the investor has an initial account balance of $9425. If the sales agent receives 32% of the GDC, he makes $184. If the payout is based on Production Credits or PCs, it would perhaps be about 5.5% of the total sale, or 32% of 550: $176.

Note that h {~wedge!!!!!!!!;bigcirc~} k = k {~wedge!!!!!!!!;bigcirc~} h, as it is clear from the second expression. With respect to a basis {partial_i} of the tangent space, it takes the compact form :(h~wedge!!!!!!!!;bigcirc~k)_{ijlm} = (h{~wedge!!!!!!!!;bigcirc~}k )(partial_i, partial_j, partial_l,partial_m) = 2h_{i [l}k_{m]j}+2h_{j [m}k_{l]i},, where [dots] denotes the total antisymmetrisation symbol. The Kulkarni‚ÄìNomizu product is a special case of the product in the graded algebra :bigoplus_{p=1}^n S^2(Omega^p M), where, on simple elements, :(alphacdotbeta) {~wedge!!!!!!!!;bigcirc~} (gammacdotdelta) = (alphawedgegamma)odot(betawedgedelta) (odot denotes the symmetric product). Properties The Kulkarni‚ÄìNomizu product of a pair of symmetric tensors has the algebraic symmetries of the Riemann tensorA (0,4)-tensor which satisfies the skew-symmetry property, the interchange symmetry property and the first (algebraic) Bianchi identity (see symmetries and identities of the Riemann curvature) is called an algebraic curvature tensor.. For instance, on space forms (i.e. spaces of constant sectional curvature) and two-dimensional smooth Riemannian manifolds, the Riemann curvature tensor has a simple expression in terms of the Kulkarni-Nomizu product of the metric g=g_{ij}dx^iotimes dx^j with itself; namely, if we denote by :operatorname{R}(partial_i, partial_j) partial_k = {R^l}_{ijk} partial_l the (1,3)-curvature tensor and by :operatorname{Rm}=R_{ijkl} dx^iotimes dx^jotimes dx^kotimes dx^l the Riemann curvature tensor with R_{ijkl}= g_{im} {R^m}_{jkl}, then :operatorname{Rm}=frac{operatorname{Scal}}{4} g~wedge!!!!!!!!;bigcirc~g, where operatorname{Scal}=operatorname{tr}_goperatorname{Ric}={R^i}_i is the scalar curvature and :operatorname{Ric}(Y,Z) = operatorname{tr}_glbrace Xmapstooperatorname{R}(X,Y)Zrbrace is the Ricci tensor, which in components reads R_{ij}={R^k}_{ikj}. Expanding the Kulkarni-Nomizu product g~wedge!!!!!!!!;bigcirc~g using the definition from above, one obtains :R_{ijkl} = frac{operatorname{Scal}}{4} g_{i[k} g_{l]j} = frac{operatorname{Scal}}{2} ( g_{ik} g_{jl} - g_{il} g_{jk} ),. This is the same expression as stated in the article on the Riemann curvature tensor. For this very reason, it is commonly used to express the contribution that the Ricci curvature (or rather, the Schouten tensor) and the Weyl tensor each makes to the curvature of a Riemannian manifold. This so-called Ricci decomposition is useful in differential geometry. When there is a metric tensor g, the Kulkarni‚ÄìNomizu product of g with itself is the identity endomorphism of the space of 2-forms, Œ©2(M), under the identification (using the metric) of the endomorphism ring End(Œ©2(M)) with the tensor product Œ©2(M) ‚äó Œ©2(M). A Riemannian manifold has constant sectional curvature k if and only if the Riemann tensor has the form :R = frac{k}{2}g {~wedge!!!!!!!!;bigcirc~} g where g is the metric tensor.

Critical geography is also used as an umbrella term for Marxist, feminist, postmodern, poststructural, queer, left-wing, and activist geography. Critical geography is one variant of critical social science and humanities that adopt Marx‚Äôs thesis to interpret and change the world. Fay (1987) defines contemporary critical science as the effort to understand the oppression in a society and use this understanding to promote societal change and liberation. Agger (1998) identifies a number of features of critical social theory practiced in fields like geography, which include: a rejection of positivism; an endorsement of the possibility of progress; a claim for the structural dynamics of domination; an argument that dominance derived from forms of false consciousness, ideology, and myth; a faith in the agency of everyday change and self-transformation and an attendant rejection of determinism; and a rejection of revolutionary expediency.  Origin  Critical geography in the Anglo-American world rooted in the radical geography that emerged in the early 1970s. Peet (2000) provides an overview of the evolution of radical and critical geography. In the early 1970s, radical geographers tried to transform the scope of the discipline of geography by responding to the great issues of the time - civil rights, environmental pollution, and war. From the mid- to late-1970s saw ascending critiques of the quantitative revolution and the adoption of Marxist approach. The 1980s is marked by fissures between humanistic, feminist and Marxist streams, and a reversal of structural excess. In the late 1980s, critical geography emerged and gradually became a self- identified field. Although closely related, critical geography and radical geography are not interchangeable. Critical geography has two crucial departures from radical geography: (1) a rejection of the structural excess of Marxism, in accordance with the post-modern turn; and (2) an increasing interest in culture and representation, in contrast to radical geography‚Äôs focus on the economy. Peet (2000) notices a rapprochement between critical and radical geography after heated debate in the 1990s. Nevertheless, Castree (2000) posits that critical and radical geography entail different commitments. He contends that the eclipse of radical geography indicates the professionalization and academicization of Left geography, and therefore worries about the loss of the \\"radical\\" tradition.  Common themes  As a consequence of the post-modern turn, critical geography doesn‚Äôt have a unified commitment. Hubbard, Kitchin, Bartley, and Fuller (2002) asserts that critical geography has a diverse epistemology, ontology, and methodology, and does not have a distinctive theoretical identity. Nonetheless, Blomley (2006) identifies six common themes of critical geography, encompassing: # A commitment to theory and a rejection of empiricism. Critical geographers consciously deploy theories of some form, but they draw from a variety of theoretical wells, such as political economy, governmentality, feminism, anti- racism, and anti-imperialism. # A commitment to reveal the processes that produce inequalities. Critical geographers seek to unveil power, uncover inequality, expose resistance, and cultivate liberating politics and social changes. # An emphasis on representation as a means of domination and resistance. A common focus of critical geography is to study how representations of space sustain power; or on the contrary, how representations of space can be used to challenge power. # An optimistic faith in the power of critical scholarship. Critical geographers believe that scholarship can be used to resist the dominant representations, and scholar can undo power domination and free the oppressed. There exists an implicit confidence in the power of critical scholarship to reach the ignorant, and in the capacities of people to defeat alienation by means of reflexive self- education. # A commitment to progressive practices. Critical geographers want to make a difference. They claim to be united with social movements and activists with commitments to social justice. The relationship between critical geography and activism has been much debated. # An understanding of space as a critical tool. Critical geographers pay special attention to how spatial arrangements and representations can be used to produce oppression and inequality. Critical geographers identify to varying degrees how space can be used as both a veil and tool of power.  Critiques  A few important questions remain unsolved in critical geography. The first one is that there has been relatively limited discussion over the shared commitments of critical geographers, with a few exceptions such as Harvey (2000). The question such as \\"what are geographers critical of\\", and \\"to what end\\" needs to be answered. Barnes (2002) comments that critical geographers are better at providing explanatory diagnoses than offering anticipatory-utopian imaginations to reconfigure the world. The second question concerns the institutionalization of critical geography. Even though critical geographers conceive themselves as rebels and outsiders, critical thinking has become prevalent in geography. Critical geography is now situated at the very heart of the discipline of geography. Some see institutionalization as a natural result of the analytical strength and insights of critical geography, while others fear that institutionalization has entailed cooptation. The question is whether critical geography still holds its commitment to political change. Lastly, as critical geography is practiced across the world, the insights of critical geographers outside the Anglophone world should be better acknowledged. In this regard, Mizuoka et al. (2005) offered an overview of Japanese critical geography praxis since the 1920s. In addition, critical geography should also forge stronger linkage with critical scholars in other disciplines.

It is one of the prototypical organic nitroso compounds. Characteristic of its functional group, it is a dark green species that exists in equilibrium with its pale yellow dimer. Both monomer and dimer are diamagnetic. Monomer-dimer equilibrium Nitrosobenzene and other nitrosoarenes typically participate in a monomer-dimer equilibrium. The dimers are often favored in the solid state, whereas the deeply colored monomers are favored in dilute solution or at higher temperatures. The dimers can be formulated as Ar(O‚àí)N+=N+(O‚àí)Ar. They exist as cis- and trans-isomers due to the presence of the N‚ÄìN double bond. The dimers are sometimes called azobenzenedioxides. The cis-trans isomerization occurs via the intermediacy of the monomer. In the case of nitrosobenzene itself, the metastable monomeric form could be prepared by sublimation onto a cold finger. The monomeric material is selectively sublimed due to its lower molecular weight and is collected on a cold finger as lustrous, dark green crystals. Over time, the monomeric material dimerizes to give the parent azobenzene-N,N‚Ä≤-dioxide as a pale yellow solid. As dictated by Le Ch√¢telier's principle, nitrosobenzene exists in the solution phase as a mixture of monomer and dimer in dynamic equilibrium whose composition is dependent on temperature (monomer favored at higher temperature) and concentration (monomer favored at low concentration), as well as the identity of the solvent. Structure of 2-nitrosotoluene dimer. Preparation Nitrosobenzene was first prepared by Adolf von Baeyer by the reaction of diphenylmercury and nitrosyl bromide: :(C6H5)2Hg + BrNO ‚Üí C6H5NO + C6H5HgBr A modern synthesis entails reduction of nitrobenzene to phenylhydroxylamine (C6H5NHOH) which is then oxidized by sodium dichromate (Na2Cr2O7). Nitrosobenzene can also be prepared by oxidation of aniline using peroxymonosulfuric acid (Caro's acid) or Oxone under biphasic conditions. It is usually purified by sublimation or by steam distillation, where it comes over as a green liquid that solidifies to a colorless solid. Characteristic reactions Nitrosobenzene undergoes Diels-Alder reactions with dienes.H. Yamamoto, N. Momiyama \\"Rich Chemistry of Nitroso Compounds\\" Chemical Communications 2005, pp.3514‚Äì25. Condensation with anilines affords azobenzene derivatives in a reaction known as the Mills reaction. Reduction of nitrosobenzene produces aniline. Most characteristically, nitrosobenzene condenses with active methylene groups, such as those of malonic esters and benzyl cyanide.

The album was released in May 2006 and was the first new recording released by the band in sixteen years. Upon its release, the album was met with critical acclaim. Development Preparation and development work for the project had been ongoing since 2000. The first recording sessions for the album started in late October 2002. The band consisted of founding members Martin Eric Ain (bass/vocals) and Tom Gabriel Fischer (voice/guitars/keyboards), along with guitarist/producer Erol Unala, Fischer's long-time songwriting partner. Unala became an increasingly significant part of Celtic Frost during the songwriting. \\"Obscured\\" comes from the demo track \\"November\\" from the 2002 demo album \\"Prototype\\". \\"Drown In Ashes\\" uses lyrics from the demo track \\"The Dying I\\". Working titles for the album included Probe and Dark Matter Manifest. Music Celtic Frost's earlier work melded elements of thrash metal and black metal. The sound of Monotheist has been described as difficult to reduce to specifics, as the songs vary from doom metal to \\"blackened thrash\\" to gothic metal to symphonic metal. The result is a wide-ranging but very dark heavy metal experience. Don Kaye at Blabbermouth called it \\"a monstrously heavy and oppressive slab of metal\\" which goes \\"into even heavier, blacker territory\\" than previous albums. Adrien Begrand of PopMatters said that the album was nearly a masterpiece of \\"brutally heavy\\" metal, \\"completely devoid of light.\\" Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic noted more subtle touches such as the \\"instantaneously infectious melody\\" of \\"A Dying God Coming into Human Flesh\\", and the \\"haunting female voices\\" heard in duet with bandleader Tom Warrior on \\"Drown in Ashes\\". According to Fischer,Matt√∂rhead: Celtic Frost (Tom Gabriel Fischer) . some of the lyrics were influenced by the writings of the English occultist Aleister Crowley.

It is a Grade II* listed building History The mill was constructed in 1800 by Henry Hayter on a plot of land called Frog Island. The mill is probably on the same site as one of the four mills recorded in the Domesday Book. Originally it was a fulling mill (part of the finishing process of cloth weaving). Some years later, in 1817, it was bought by William Madick who changed its operation to throw silk. In 1844 it was acquired by Alexander Bannerman and John Spencer, merchants of Manchester. William Chappell, the manager of the mill, purchased it from them in 1846. At this time the mill employed 108 staff, including 39 children under the age of 13. By 1866 the mill had passed into the ownership of the Hide family with whom it remained until the death of James Hide in 1955. It ultimately passed to Ede and Ravenscroft who operated it up to 1985, producing legal and academic gowns. It was then acquired by the Hampshire Buildings Preservation Trust who, after renovation works, opened it to the public in 1990. In December 2012, the Trustees recommenced silk production. Ownership and Management The building is owned by the Hampshire Buildings Preservation Trust and leased to a dedicated trust, the Whitchurch Silk Mill Trust, to ensure preservation. The Trust operates as a registered charity and two registered companies. The Whitchurch Silk Mill states on the UK Charity Commission website: Local organisations, including the Town Council, and the public offered support to the Silk Mill so that weaving activity was restored to the Mill. Machinery Weaving machines The mill was powered by a low breastshot water wheel, in diameter driving the machinery through line shafting. There are currently 15 looms in total, 10 Tappet looms dating to 1890‚Äì1932, 3 Dobby looms dating to the 1950s and 2 1960s Hattersley looms acquired in 1972. These days the looms are powered by individual electric motors. In addition there is a warping mill and winding frames also dating from the 1890s. Public Access The mill is open for commissions and visitors, there is a gift shop and tea room on site.

The first two settlers along the creek were Robert Todd and Samuel Bigham who were partners in business as packers and were both former Hudson's Bay Company employees. They took out adjoining preemptions with Bourdignon (Heffley) Creek as the northern boundary. Todd's lot was more westerly, bordering on the North Thompson River. Bigham was the uncle of Joseph McKay, the Chief Trader at the Hudson's Bay Company post at Kamloops from 1860 to 1865. Bigham is first mentioned as leading a mule train to the fort in 1862. He and Todd settled at Heffley Creek in 1864 but didn't stay long. Bigham leased the hotel and restaurant in the fort at Kamloops, and Todd left for the Shushwap. Bigham died at the fort in 1867. =Adam Heffley= Heffley Creek takes its name from Adam Heffley who entered B.C. as a miner and packer during the gold rush of 1858. In 1860 he was one of the handlers for the famous camels that were unsuccessfully used as pack animals on the Cariboo Road. He settled at Bourdignon Creek in 1865 and took over Todd's and Bigham's preemptions at the end of 1869. Heffley raised horses on his ranch and continued to work as a packer. Some of his horses were used for racing, and he apparently had a friendly rivalry in races with Chief Louis of the Kamloops Indian Band. Heffley died of a heart attack in 1872, and though he left heirs, his property was sold at auction. =John Thomas Edwards= Adam Heffley's stock sold for $8,000, a lot of money at that time, and his land was bought by John Thomas Edwards for over $4,000. Edwards was to become a prominent rancher and businessman in the southern interior with careers as rancher, hotelier, road builder, Justice of the Peace and civic politician. He was born in Wales where he worked as a coal miner before leaving for B.C. in 1865. After some success as a miner and storekeeper in Barkerville, he moved to Kamloops in 1872. His new ranch raised horses and a large herd of cattle which he made larger. In 1874 he planted alfalfa, thirty years before this forage crop was popular elsewhere in the district. In spite of a setback during the bad had winter of 1879 when he lost a large number of his cattle, Edwards' ranch prospered. In 1888 Michael Hagan, editor of the Sentinel newspaper, described the ranch. \\"About 12 miles from town is the celebrated ranch of John T. Edwards, where the tasty residence, extensive barns, sheds, and corrals give a pleasant appearance to the ranch, while extensive fields and miles of fencing provide for perhaps the largest bands of cattle and horses along the river.\\" By this time Heffley Creek was called Edwards Creek. =Other notable settlers= Michael Sullivan and J.T. Ussher In the meantime other settlers had moved in the area. One of the earliest was Michael Sullivan who, in partnership with J.T. Ussher, took up land immediately north of Heffley's (Edwards') ranch in 1868. J.T. Ussher was the government agent who was killed by the McLean gang in 1879. J.T. Edwards headed up the posse that captured them. Sullivan, after whom Sullivan Lake and Vinsulla (an anagram of Sullivan) are named, sold his ranch to Edwards in 1889 and moved to Shuswap on the South Thompson. James Knouff James Knouff took up land around the lake that now bears his name in about 1870 though his pre-emption wasn't registered until 1873. In 1888 Hagan of the Sentinel recorded that his property adjoined the ranch of Michael Sullivan. J.T. Edwards In 1870, Cyrus Robbins settled about four miles (6 km) south of Heffley Creek. His land was purchased by the ever-expanding J.T. Edwards in 1882. John McIver John McIver, a former Hudson's Bay Company employee who started one of the first farms in the region at Cherry Creek in 1860, moved to Heffley Creek in 1869. His land, now occupied by the Rayleigh jail and formerly the Department of National Defense ammunition depot, was bought by Sam Armout in 1888. McIver's log house, built in the late 1860s, is still standing today as the oldest home in the City. By the 1880s other ranchers had settled up the valley towards Heffley Lake and on the heights above the North Thompson River. The Sentinel noted half a dozen different families apart from the major landowners, Edwards, Sullivan and Knouff. The paper also mentioned a good deal of prospecting in the region. In the 1890s many other families settled around Heffley Creek. The Bedard family homesteaded near Knouff Lake in 1898. =1890-1910= The greatest change took place when J.T. Edwards sold his entire operation to Michael Sullivan in the same year. Sullivan, who continued to reside at Shuswap, rented the Circle Bar Ranch, as Edwards' place was named, to various people including W.W. Shaw in 1898 and John McCannell in 1905. They lived in the fine wood and brick house built near the river by J.T. Edwards. Henri Louis Devick arrived from Switzerland in 1904 and after he died in 1906 his sons continued to operate the farm for many years. C.E. Lawrence homesteaded at Silent Pool beginning in 1905, and he also worked as foreman on the Circle Bar Ranch. In the meantime, J.T. Edwards, now in his late fifties, tried to make a new start in the gold rush town of Atlin in northern B.C. His luck was poor, however, and he returned to start a smaller farm at Louis Creek in 1900. He died in 1919 at age 74. Also, in 1870, Cyrus Robbins settled about four miles (6 km) south of Heffley. Until recent years, when it has become a residential community, Heffley Creek has been primarily a quiet farming village raising cattle, sheep and mixed vegetables. What conflicts did occur were most often over water rights as one can imagine in a region where irrigation is essential. Local residents quipped that the people of Heffley would quarrel over dividing the rain drops. After J.T. Edwards became the major rancher there in the 1870s the areas was known both as Heffley Creek and Edwards Creek. The name was officially Heffley Creek in 1905 with establishment of the post office, but the name Edwards Creek was commonly used for many years. During the days of stage coaches frequent rest stops were necessary for the horses. Heffley Creek was known as Fourteen Mile in 1897 when the road went as far as Louis Creek. A cattle trail was cut through to Bridge Lake in 1898 by cattle boss J.T. Edwards to enable transport of cattle to various mining districts in northern B.C. In 1897 the ranching Spratt family of four brothers opened a small hotel at Heffley Creek called the \\"Travellers Retreat\\". The hotel included a licensed bar and general store. It opened on January 19 with a duck shoot and community dance. The name of the hotel was changed to the \\"Halfway House\\" in June and by September it was sold to N.G. Armstrong. During the mining boom in the Kamloops region a gold dredge operated from August 1901 to May 1902 at the mouth of Heffley Creek. Results were not satisfactory, however, and it was moved to Tranquille where it also failed to earn its keep. It was left derelict at Tranquille for many years. The dredge lived on in memory at Heffley Creek, however. The hotel there was renamed the \\"Gold Dredge Hotel\\", a name it retained until 1910. The building was originally log in construction, but in the 1900s wood siding was added There were nine bedrooms upstairs and a bar downstairs. By 1905 Denis Spratt was operating the hotel once again, and he held a turkey shoot to advertise its new ownership. He seemed to have trouble keeping a liquor licence, however. The licence expired in 1910 but the boarding house and stables remained open. In July 1910 the village was threatened by a forest fire. Exhausted local residents appealed for help from Kamloops, and damage to homes and crops was averted. The Edwards Creek School, built in 1909, had been the most threatened. =1911-1930= In 1911 W.R. Austin purchased the old Edwards Ranch, comprising over . He also bought the hotel and built a general store. This was the period of construction for the Canadian Northern Railway, and Austin was optimistic about the future. By 1913 he had built a dairy and a sawmill and formed the North Thompson Land Settlement Company. He had a townsite surveyed at Heffley Creek close to the railway station where he planned to sell small farms from in size. Few of the dreams materialized, however, and he continued to farm the land he owned. After his death in 1918 his son-in-law, E.J. Webb, operated the ranch for many years. In 1913, Kamloops' pioneer Chinese resident, Ah Mee, purchased a farm at the north end of Heffley Creek Canyon. He owned it until his death in 1926. *By 1912 Heffley Creek had become the centre of a thriving agriculture district. That October the community hosted the first North Thompson Exhibition in its exhibition building, called Union Hall. It was a successful event that featured agricultural exhibits, a sports program of various track events, as well as a turkey shoot and tug of war. The evening concert in the hall employed Kamloops Mayor J.T. Robinson as master of ceremonies. The community hall was called Union Hall because it was used as a meeting hall, reading room, social hall and church. The hotel was now called the \\"Gold Ridge Temperance Hotel\\" which meant it didn't have a liquor licence. The village had long distance telephone service at the general store even though it didn't have residential electricity until 1929. The population of the district grew to about three hundred during the 1920s and 1930s. =1931-1940= In 1931 a group of Kamloops businessmen made another attempt at dredging gold at the creek. This time, perhaps with improved technology, the dredge paid for itself until disaster struck. On June 5 the dredge broke away from its moorings and drifted downstream. When it struck a small island the dredge overturned and the operator, Henry Stevens, and his son had to swim for their lives. They were marooned on the island overnight before the police arrived from Kamloops to rescue them. Unfortunately, there wasn't enough profit from the operation to repair the dredge and start again. In 1939 Charles McGillivray 'bought part of the old Edwards ranch, now called the Webb Ranch, and turned it into a large 'market vegetable farm. It adjoined onto the Department of National Defense property to the south, now the Rayleigh jail. =1941-present= There was another serious incident in May 1948. This was a record flood year, and the enormous runoff caused the earth dam at Devick Lake to give way. At about three o'clock in the morning of the 25th, a wall of water rushed down Heffley Creek. Fortunately, the great roar of the water could be heard for miles, and people along the creek were able to wake up and run for safety. A number of homes, barns and vehicles were smashed or swept away by the water, but there were no injuries except for a few drowned cattle and other livestock. The Heffley Creek road bridge collapsed, and the water tore two large chasms in the roadbed of the C.N.R., leaving the tracks hanging in mid-air like ladders. People feared that the larger dam at Heffley Lake might also collapse so a crew of men was sent to strengthen it.

Jacob Two-Two Meets the Hooded Fang has twice been filmed, in 1978 and 1999, the latter film starring Gary Busey as the villainous Hooded Fang. The titles by Mordecai Richler have inspired an animated TV series Jacob Two-Two (TV series) produced by Nelvana, in Canada in English on YTV and in French on VRAK TV (French), and in the United States on Qubo. Jacob is the youngest child of five and has to say things twice because people do not hear him the first time, which lead to his distinctive nickname. The character was once believed to have been inspired by Jacob Richler, the author's youngest son. Every character in Jacob's family has the same name as their counterpart in the real Richler family. However, despite the names, Richler stated that the characters were not based on his family. In September 2009 Tundra Books, the publisher of the Jacob Two-Two series, released a new fourth book The Return of Jacob Two-Two titled Jacob Two-Two on the High Seas. Mordecai Richler had always planned to write new adventures and had started a fourth book before he died in 2001. With the full support of the Richler family, the new book was finished by Canadian author Cary Fagan. It is a prequel to the first three books, with the family sailing back to Canada from England after Jacob's father writes an important novel. Tundra will also re-release the previous three titles in the series with new art and covers by Toronto artist, Du≈°an Petriƒçiƒá. Characters Jacob Two-Two :The protagonist of the story, Jacob Two-Two is the youngest child in his family and tends not to be heard. As a result, he repeats everything twice automatically, which is the origin of his nickname. (See Jacob Richler.) X. Barnaby Dinglebat :Jacob's next door neighbour is an international spy, working for CMIST (Canadian Ministry of Intrigue, Spying, and Tattling). Jacob later helps Mr. Dinglebat and his agent Intrepid (a hamster) on top secret missions. Morty :Jacob's dad, the writer of the popular \\"Amazing Ronald\\" books, is said to be based on Mordecai Richler. He is described as being fairly laid back and easygoing. Noah and Emma :Jacob's older twin brother and sister respectively. The two of them are avid readers and wrestling fans, but they do not take Jacob seriously and treat him like a nuisance who cannot keep up with them. They form a superhero team known as \\"Child Power\\" and refer to themselves as Fearless O'Toole (Noah) and Intrepid Shapiro (Emma). They pick on Jacob a lot.(See also Noah Richler and Emma Richler.) Marfa :Jacob's oldest sister, who is vain, loud-mouthed, and short-tempered but very smart. While she and Jacob argue a lot, she is proud of his achievements and they care about each other. Daniel :Jacob's oldest brother, the epitome of cool in Jacob's eyes. He treats Jacob like a nuisance at times, but also seems to take him more seriously than Noah, Emma, and Marfa. He likes music, especially classics like the Beatles. (See Daniel Richler.) Florence :Jacob's mother, who takes everything in stride. Mrs Sour Pickle :Jacob's geography teacher Miss Sour Pickle has a permanent scowl plastered on her face, like she smells something bad. She glories in catching her students not paying attention or talking in class, then giving them snap quizzes on the obscure capitals of equally obscure countries. The only thing Sour Pickle loves to do more than torment Two Two is cheer for her favourite team, the marvelous Montreal Marvels. It's her biggest secret that she simply adores hockey. Miss Darling Sweetiepie :This absolutely adorable little old lady down the street constantly roaming about offering everyone she meets delicious baked goods. Buford :An odd little kid with a string of unfortunate names. His full name is \\"Buford Orville Gaylord Pugh\\". His lack of anxiety and worries aren't due to a lack of intelligence, they're more due to his inability to FOCUS. He is prone to recounting pointless, meandering shaggy dog stories at the drop of a hat. Buford and Jacob are both new at school.

The demonym Ladino is a Spanish word that derives from Latino. Ladino is an exonym invented during the colonial era to refer to those Spanish-speakers who were not Peninsulares, Criollos or indigenous peoples. Guatemala The Ladino population in Guatemala is officially recognized as a distinct ethnic group, and the Ministry of Education of Guatemala uses the following definition: > \\"The ladino population has been characterized as a heterogeneous population > which expresses itself in the Spanish language as a maternal language, which > possesses specific cultural traits of Hispanic origin mixed with indigenous > cultural elements, and dresses in a style commonly considered as western.\\" The population censuses include the ladino population as one of the different ethnic groups in Guatemala. In popular use, the term ladino commonly refers to non-indigenous Guatemalans, as well as mestizos and westernized amerindians. The word was popularly thought to be derived from a mix of Latino and ladr√≥n, the Spanish word for \\"thief\\", but is not necessarily or popularly considered a pejorative.Silence on the Mountain, by Daniel Wilkinson, The word is actually derived from the old Spanish ladino (inherited from the same Latin root that the word latino was later borrowed from), originally referring to those who spoke Romance languages in medieval times, and later also developing the separate meaning of \\"crafty\\" or \\"astute\\". In the Central American colonial context, it was first used refer to those Amerindians who came to speak only Spanish, and later included their mestizo descendants.Diccionario Critico Etimologico castellano G-MA, by Joan Corominas, Ladino is sometimes used to refer to the mestizo middle class, or to the population of indigenous peoples who have attained some level of upward social mobility above the largely impoverished indigenous masses. This relates especially to achieving some material wealth and adopting a North American lifestyle. In many areas of Guatemala, it is used in a wider sense, meaning \\"any Guatemalan whose primary language is Spanish\\". Indigenist rhetoric sometimes uses ladino in the second sense, as a derogatory term for indigenous peoples who are seen as having betrayed their homes by becoming part of the middle class. Some may deny indigenous heritage to assimilate. \\"The 20th century Amerindian political activist, Rigoberta Mench√∫, born in 1959, used the term this way in her noted memoir, which many considered controversial. She illustrates the use of ladino both as a derogatory term, when discussing an indigenous person becoming mestizo/ladino, and in terms of the general mestizo community identifying as ladino as a kind of happiness.

It was against parliamentarism but favoured decentralization, national syndicalism, the Roman Catholic Church and the monarchy. It was especially active during the Portuguese First Republic. Lusitanian Integralism is a variant of integralism that evolved in Portugal; the term \\"Lusitania\\" is derived from the Latin term for Portugal. It initially supported the last king of Portugal, Manuel II, but it refused to back him after 1920 after the attempts to restore the monarchy initiated in Monsanto Forest Park, Lisbon, and during the Monarchy of the North. Instead, it supported Manuel's cousin, Miguel of Braganza.

Reeve was paralyzed from the neck down after being thrown from his horse in a cross-country equestrian riding event on May 27, 1995.\\"Is there a 'Superman' curse?\\" CNN. March 17, 2003 Reeve died on October 10, 2004 aged 52, 15 days after his birthday. No official autopsy was performed on the actor, but both Reeve's wife Dana and his doctor John McDonald believed that an adverse reaction to a drug caused Reeve's death. Other alleged victims =Marlon Brando= Marlon Brando, who played Jor-El in the 1978 film, is cited for the misfortune he suffered in his private life, such as his son Christian's shooting of his half-sister Cheyenne's boyfriend in 1990 and subsequent five-year imprisonment, Brando's own admission in court that he had failed his son and daughter, his daughter's 1995 suicide and his later reclusiveness. He died in July 2004, three months before his Superman co-star Christopher Reeve. Footage of him would later be posthumously used in 2006's Superman Returns. =Margot Kidder= Margot Kidder, who played Superman's love interest Lois Lane opposite Christopher Reeve, had bipolar disorder. In April 1996, she went missing for several days and was found by police in a paranoid, delusional state.Kevin Williamson and Jim Slotek. \\"Will Amy Adams face Superman curse?\\". Toronto Sun. April 3, 2011 Kidder dismissed the notion of a curse, remarking in a 2002 interview, \\"That is all newspaper-created rubbish. The idea cracks me up. What about the luck of Superman? When my car crashed this August, if I hadn't hit a telegraph pole after rolling three times, I would have dropped down a 50ft to 60ft ravine. Why don't people focus on that?\\"Poole, Oliver. \\"Curse? It's the luck of Superman\\". The Daily Telegraph. December 9, 2002 Kidder died on May 13, 2018 in Livingston, Montana after a drug and alcohol overdose. Her death was ruled a suicide.Volz, Matt (August 8, 2018). \\"Margot Kidder's death ruled a suicide\\". Associated Press. =Richard Pryor= Comedian Richard Pryor, who had previously had a drug addiction that led to a near-fatal suicide attempt, starred as villain Gus Gorman in 1983‚Äôs Superman III, but later took Superman's side near the end of the movie and became a hero. Three years later, he announced that he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. He died of a heart attack on December 10, 2005 at the age of 65. =Dana Reeve= The curse has been mentioned regarding the death of actress Dana Reeve (the widow of actor Christopher Reeve), who, despite being a non-smoker, died of lung cancer in 2006 at the age of 44.\\"Superman 'curse' is back\\". London Evening Standard. July 12, 2006 =Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster= Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, the writer and artist who co-created Superman, sold the rights to their creation to DC Comics for a relatively small amount of money, in contrast to the amount of money the character has generated over the decades. Despite the repeated efforts over the course of the rest of their lives to recover legal ownership of Superman, and a share in the immense profits that the character brought for DC Comics, DC's copyright on the character was renewed. By the 1950s, Shuster's worsening eyesight prevented him from drawing, and he worked as a deliveryman in order to earn a living. Jerry Robinson claimed that Shuster had delivered a package to the DC building, embarrassing the employees. He was summoned to the CEO, given $100.00, and told to buy a new coat and find another job. By 1976, Shuster was almost blind and living in a California nursing home.Horn, Maurice. The World Encyclopedia of Comics: Shuster, Joe. (Scribner, 1976) In 1975, Siegel launched a publicity campaign, in which Shuster participated, protesting DC Comics' treatment of him and Shuster. In the face of a great deal of negative publicity over their handling of the affair (and with the Superman movie coming soon), DC's parent company Warner Communications reinstated the byline dropped more than 30 years earlier and granted the pair a lifetime pension of $20,000 a year, plus health benefits. The first issue with the restored credit was Superman (vol. 1) #302 (August 1976). Siegel died in 1996 and Shuster in 1992. =Max and Dave Fleischer= Brothers Max Fleischer and Dave Fleischer of Fleischer Studios, who produced the Paramount Superman cartoons began to quarrel with one another and their studio suffered financial disaster. After selling to Paramount Studios, the new owners fired the two brothers. One of them died in poverty.Pinkney, John; Spudvilas, Anne (Aug 25, 2011). The Mary Celeste Syndrome Plus 18 Other Tantalizing Mysteries, Amazon Digital Services LLC. =DVD Crew of Superman Returns= The curse was invoked after three people involved in the creation of the Superman Returns DVD were injured. One of them fell down a flight of stairs, another was mugged and physically assaulted, and a third smashed into a glass window. Director Bryan Singer remarked, \\"My DVD crew absorbed the curse for us.\\" =Allison Mack= Allison Mack, who played Chloe Sullivan on the TV series Smallville, was accused of sex trafficking and forced human labor and was arrested in April 2018 on those charges. An article on Fox News speculated whether this was related to the curse. Superman actors not generally believed to have become victims of the curse The following actors have either portrayed Superman or voiced him in animated cartoons, but are not typically associated with the curse. =Dean Cain= Dean Cain became a household name in the early to mid-1990s for his portrayal of Superman/Clark Kent in Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman. He went on to have various roles in shows such as Frasier and Law & Order, as well as made-for-TV movies. He has also made guest appearances in two other Superman-related series: in an episode of Smallville as the villainous Dr. Curtis Knox, and a recurring role in Supergirl as the title character's foster father, Jeremiah Danvers. ABC News correspondent Buck Wolf once commented, \\"(Cain) has yet to find the right role.\\" =Bud Collyer= Bud Collyer voiced the first series of Superman cartoons from 1941‚Äì1943. He went on to enjoy a career in TV, hosting the game show To Tell the Truth. He returned to Superman by voicing The New Adventures of Superman for CBS in 1966. He died of in 1969 circulatory ailment at the age of 61. Voice actors have generally been considered not to be affected by the curse. =Brandon Routh= Actor Brandon Routh, who played Superman in the 2006 film Superman Returns, dismisses the notion of the curse. He stated that what occurs to one person or set of people will not necessarily occur to everyone, and that he does not live his life in fear.\\"Talking the Man Of Steel with Superman Returns Brandon Routh\\". Movieweb. June 22, 2006 Routh eventually played Ray Palmer (the Atom) on other DC Comics-related projects, is a recurring character in Arrow and The Flash, and is a regular in the spin-off series Legends of Tomorrow (occasionally, his role as Superman is referenced in the Arrowverse). He revisited the role in Crisis on Infinite Earths. =Bob Holiday= Bob Holiday played Superman on Broadway in the 1960s musical It's a Bird, It's a Plane, It's Superman!.

The group was founded in 2004 in an attempt to gain more control over the region's vast petroleum resources, particularly in Delta State. The NDPVF has frequently demanded a greater share of the oil wealth from both the state and federal government and has occasionally supported independence for the Delta region. Until 2005 the group was spearheaded by Alhaji Mujahid Dokubo-Asari, who is viewed by many Delta residents as a folk hero. Founding and initial conflict The NDPVF's strongly Ijaw agenda has led to conflict with both the Nigerian state and federal governments, as well as with neighboring ethnic groups, notably long- time rivals the Itsekiri. This rivalry precipitated a number of conflicts in the region, centered primarily around the cities of Warri and subsequently the 'oil capital' of Port Harcourt. The issue of local government ward allocation has proven particularly contentious, as the Ijaw feel that the way in which wards have been allocated ensures that their superior numbers will not be reflected in the number of wards controlled by politicians of Ijaw ethnicity. Control of the city of Warri, the largest metropolitan area in Delta State and therefore a prime source of political patronage, has been an especially fiercely contested prize. This has given birth to heated disputes between the Ijaw, the Itsekiri and the Urhobo about which of the three groups are \\"truly\\" indigenous to the Warri region, with the underlying presumption being that the \\"real\\" indigenes should have control of the levers of power, regardless of the fact that all three groups enjoy ostensibly equal political rights in their places of residence. Prior to 2003, the center of regional violence was Warri. However, after the violent convergence of NDPVF with the Niger Delta Vigilante (NDV) led by Ateke Tom (the NDV is also composed primarily of Ijaws), conflict became focused on Port Harcourt and outlying towns. The two groups dwarf a plethora of smaller militias supposedly numbering more than one hundred. All of the groups are constituted mostly by disaffected young men from Warri, Port Harcourt, and their sub-urban areas. Although the smaller groups are autonomous from within, they have formed alliances with and are largely controlled from above by either Asari and his NDPVF or Tom's NDV who provide military support and instruction. The NDPFV attempted control such resources primarily through oil \\"bunkering\\", a process in which a petroleum pipeline is tapped and the petroleum extracted onto a barge. Bunkering is illegal in the eyes of both the Nigerian state and the petroleum corporations, but is justified by the militias on the basis that they are being exploited and have not received adequate profits from the monstrously profitable but ecologically destructive petroleum industry. Bunkered petroleum is usually sold for profit, usually to destinations in West Africa, but also further afield. Bunkering is a fairly common practice in the Delta but in this case the militia groups are the primary 'perpetrators'.Rivers and Blood: Guns, Oil and Power in Nigeria‚Äôs Rivers State (Human Rights Watch, 2005) The intense confrontation between the NDPVF and NDV seems to have been brought about by Asari‚Äôs political falling out with the NDPVF‚Äôs financial supporter Peter Odili, governor of Rivers State following the April 2003 local and state elections. After Asari publicly criticized the election process as fraudulent, the Odili government withdrew its financial support from the NDPVF and began to support Tom‚Äôs NDV, effectively launching a paramilitary campaign against the NDPVF.

During the decade-long war against the Ming dynasty, Tr·ªãnh Kh·∫£ served as an advisor to L√™ L·ª£i. With victory, Tr·ªãnh Kh·∫£ was elevated to a high position in the new court of Emperor L√™ L·ª£i. Tr·ªãnh Kh·∫£ (and the other councilors) were given the privilege of wearing red silk and were called H√†nh-khi·ªÉn. Other members of this new elite were: Nguy·ªÖn Tr√£i, Tran Nguyen Han, L√™ S√°t, Ph·∫°m VƒÉn X·∫£o, Dinh Li√™t, and L√™ Ngan. When L√™ L·ª£i died in 1433, L√™ S√°t was appointed regent for the young emperor, L√™ L·ª£i's second son, L√™ Th√°i T√¥ng. L√™ S√°t made use of his new power to remove rivals from the government, some were killed (like Ph·∫°m VƒÉn X·∫£o), while others, like Tr·ªãnh Kh·∫£, were sent away to govern distant provinces of Vietnam. L√™ Th√°i T√¥ng officially came of age in 1438 but found L√™ S√°t was unwilling to give up his power as regent. L√™ Th√°i T√¥ng looked for political allies and found Tr·ªãnh Kh·∫£. The new emperor appointed Tr·ªãnh Kh·∫£ to command the Palace Guard. A few months later, L√™ S√°t was accused of ruling in place of the emperor and with the aid of Kh·∫£'s guards, L√™ S√°t was arrested and then condemned to death. Not long after this, L√™ Ngan was also removed from power, leaving Tr·ªãnh Kh·∫£ as the main power behind L√™ Th√°i T√¥ng. Officially, Tr·ªãnh Kh·∫£ was the head of the Administrative Bureau (Chinh-su-vien) but the next four years were filled with intrigue as the various noble families in the court plotted to expand their power at the expense of their rivals. Tr·ªãnh Kh·∫£ came out on top of this fight, being promoted to the position of Imperial Councilor shortly before L√™ Th√°i T√¥ng became sick and died in 1442. With the death of the young emperor, the new heir to the throne was an infant L√™ Nh√¢n T√¥ng. The government was nominally controlled by the boy's mother, Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã Anh (as Dowager Queen and Regent), but she was very young herself. Real power seems to have been wielded by Tr·ªãnh Kh·∫£ along with Nguy·ªÖn X√≠, Le Thu and two generals: Dinh Li√™t and Pham Boi. The government of the oligarchy was not very active but they sent six missions to the Ming Court. Some of the missions were complaints about raids by the Champa kingdom into Vietnam. In 1446, the government launched an attack on the Champa. The campaign was reasonably successful as the Vietnamese army captured the capital city of Vijaya but they lost the city to a counter-attack a year later. This was the forerunner of the 1470 campaign which would destroy the Champa. As the years passed, Queen Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã Anh came into greater conflict with the Tr·ªãnh Kh·∫£ and the other oligarchs who ruled the country. The Queen gained some support from the Confucian scholars who had passed the Imperial examinations and tried to rule much like their Chinese colleges to the north ruled in the Ming imperial system. The nobles in turn tried to limit the power of the scholars and maintain their own control over the government. For reasons lost to history, the Queen ordered Tr·ªãnh Kh·∫£ and his eldest son executed in August 1451. Two years later, upon the official enthronement of L√™ Nh√¢n T√¥ng (at the age of 12), Tr·ªãnh Kh·∫£ was pardoned and new lands were given to the Tr·ªãnh family. The Tr·ªãnh family continued to be a major noble family in Vi·ªát Nam. In 1545, a great-grandson named Tr·ªãnh Ki·ªÉm, took control of a large part of Vietnam. His descendants ruled the north for the next 240 years (see the Tr·ªãnh Lords for details). Three hundred years later, the Vietnamese officer, L√™ Qu√Ω ƒê√¥n, said of Tr·ªãnh Kh·∫£ he \\"served the public good, exhausted his virtue (on it), and considered the correction of evil and the presentation of instruction to be his own duty\\".

It is the fifteenth novel in the series. Publication history Amber and Iron was written by Margaret Weis and published in November 2006. Other books in the series include Amber and Ashes (Volume 1) and Amber and Blood (Volume 3). Plot introduction The novel begins with where Amber and Ashes leaves off. Former Majere monk Rhys Mason is trying to escape the clutches of the death knight Auseric Krell after Rhys has the kender Nightshade, in the guise of a Khas piece, recover the imprisoned soul of Ariakan for his mother, the god Zeboim. Mina, as enigmatic as ever, escapes imprisonment to set off on a quest that will test even her considerable will. All the while, evil spreads across the land, gaining ground with each new day. With so much at stake, with the very soul of Krynn on the line, champions must be found even in the darkest places. Plot summary Rhys Mason, former monk of Majere, begins the novel trying to escape death knight Auseric Krell. Rhys, having retrieved the soul of the Dark Knight Ariakan imprisoned by Chemosh in a khas piece, hands the piece over to Zeboim. She sends Rhys and Nightshade back to Solace. Once there, the sheriff, Gerard, seeks others for counsel about the mounting Beloved situation. Rhys agrees with Gerard to stay in Solace and help in any way possible. After an encounter with a Beloved, Rhys, Nightshade, and Atta (Rhys' dog) head after the creature, eventually ending up in New Port. Here, Rhys finally finds his brother Lleu, a Beloved introduced in the first Dark Disciple novel, who he has been tracking ever since. Elsewhere, Mina has been imprisoned in a new tower of magic in Istar, at the bottom of the Blood Sea. It has been newly erected by the dark god of magic, Nuitari. At a Conclave of Wizards meeting, Nuitari reveals to his cousins about his tower. The three agree to erect three Towers of High Sorcery again, one for each of them. Back in the Tower, Mina begins her task set before her by Chemosh of searching for the Solia Febalas (Hall of Sacrilege). Once she has found it, she is unable to take anything for Chemosh because she becomes so overwhelmed by the god-presence in the Hall. Finally, Nuitari returns and gives Mina over to Zeboim who had begun an assault upon the Tower. Zeboim takes Mina first to New Port where Rhys and his brother are at to have them meet. While there, Mina has a vision of Rhys and insists he knows the truth about her. Rhys' brother also pleads with Mina to take his life as a Beloved because he wishes it no longer. Before Mina can answer, Zeboim gives her back to Chemosh, who is irate with Mina for not getting any artifacts for him. He has been growing increasingly agitated that the Beloved will only follow her command and resist any by him or Krell. Rhys again tails his brother and finally confronts him again along with New Port authority when his brother tries to kill a woman. The woman's child attacks the Beloved on behalf of his mother and the Beloved is instantly destroyed, leaving the child in a coma-like state. Krell decides it would be in Chemosh's best interest if Krell would kill Mina, who is now being imprisoned by Chemosh. As he tries to follow through with his plan, Mina does something extraordinary; she makes him a human again. Then, because she believes Chemosh would want it, she pulls the Tower of Istar from the sea bottom and places it on top on an island in the middle of the ocean. Passing out from such exertion, the novel ends with all of the major and minor gods showing up and pondering over the nature of the unconscious Mina. Majere finally reveals that Mina is in fact a god like them, one of light, who was swayed and corrupted somehow by the Dark Queen Takhisis.

Best known for figures from her own life and those beyond it, including close friends, historical personae, and icons of contemporary culture, Peyton‚Äôs portraits have regularly featured artists, writers, musicians, and actors. Early life and education Born in Danbury, Connecticut in 1965, Peyton began drawing and painting people at a young age. Between 1984 and 1987, she studied fine arts at the School of Visual Arts in New York City. Work Peyton‚Äôs artwork, mainly figurative, can be characterized by a coupling of understatement and intensity, depicting subjects from her own life and beyond with both startling immediacy and her signature richly modulated surfaces.Karen Rosenberg (July 11, 2008), A Painter's Social Network, Traced in Her Photographs The New York Times. Peyton draws much inspiration from the creative work of historical figures like Gustave Flaubert and John Singer Sargent, and she has expressed that she is part of a lineage of artists and writers like Balzac, Camille Claudel, Delacroix, Isa Genzken, Giorgione, Georgia O‚ÄôKeefe, etc. who look at subjects and portray them with an economy of expression to unite passive sensation with emotion.Elizabeth Peyton, 30 April - 30 May 2009 Sadie Coles HQ, London.Bell, Kirsty.‚ÄúPeyton After Peyton: On Reality and Archetype,‚Äù Dark Incandescence, New York: Rizzoli, 2017. Peyton works from both life and photography, generally using painting, drawing, or printmaking, and often exploring successive degrees of removal from her source material, such as in her paintings of Camille Claudel‚Äôs sculptures in which Peyton creates paintings of photographs of sculptures. In her interview with Frieze magazine, Peyton expressed that when she chooses to paint from another artist‚Äôs work, it allows her to explore ‚Äúharder-to-reach things inside herself‚Äù because the composition is already decided. In another manner of reworking, Peyton will revisit an image that she has previously used, cropping it in different dimensions and thus altering the amount of context given. This manipulation of context is significant to Peyton because of its effect on the feelings of proximity and intimacy. Since 1998, when Parkett magazine commissioned her to create a lithograph, Peyton has created a broad range of prints, including monotypes, lithographs, and woodcuts.Bosie (1998) MoMA, New York. Experimenting with different techniques, she also uses a variety of diverse and handmade papers as well as various colored and monochromatic inks. In addition to portraits, Peyton also produces work that engages with the still-life tradition, often featuring cropped portraits in complex compositions with flowers, statuary, and other motifs associated with the genre. This exploration, beginning around 2007, represented a reorientation of attention from the figure to the broader context of the individual‚Äôs environment and the expression of feelings. Examples featured in Peyton‚Äôs 2017 Dark Incandescence monograph include Pati (2007), Balzac + Roses (2008), Flaubert + Madame Bovary (Elephants) (2008), Camille Claudel and Flowers (Still Life) (2009), Actaeon, Justin Bieber and Grey Roses (2010), Flowers, Lichtenstein, Parsifal (2011), Berlin, Hyacinth and Black Teapot (2014), and Universe of the World-Breath (2018).Collector's Edition: Elizabeth Peyton - Camille Claudel Flowers and Books Hatje Cantz Publishing, Ostfildern.Elizabeth Peyton: Dark Incandescence, November 18, 2014 - January 16, 2015 Barbara Gladstone, Brussels. In 2009, Peyton collaborated with Matthew Barney on Blood of Two, an art project on the Greek island of Hydra. She later worked with Jonathan Horowitz on a series of monotypes which develop upon the concepts of plants and flowers as motifs of love and death, resulting in a series of paintings, prints, drawings, sculptures and photographs, as well as a collaborative artists book.Secret Life, 7 June - 25 August 2012 Sadie Coles HQ, London congratulations you made it to the end . Exhibitions One of Peyton's first exhibitions in New York City was held in a room of the Hotel Chelsea (mainly drawings) in 1993.Calvin Tomkins (October 6, 2008), The Artist of the Portrait The New Yorker. People who wished to see the exhibition would ask the hotel reception for the key to Room 828; Calvin Tompkins speculated that about 50 people visited Peyton's drawings of Napoleon, Marie Antoinette, and other portraits of European historical figures, but this show succeeded in bringing her into the public eye. A mid- career exhibition of her work started at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York City in October 2008, and traveled to the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; Whitechapel Gallery, London; and Bonnefantenmuseum, Maastricht (2009‚Äì10). This first survey of Peyton's work in an American institution included her latest portraits, which revealed a greater emphasis on the psychology of subjects such as Matthew Barney and John Giorno. The day following Barack Obama's election to the U.S. presidency, a new painting, created in August 2008, was added to the exhibition, representing Michelle Obama and her daughter at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. Her work has also been the subject of solo exhibitions at the Royal Academy in London (2002); Salzburger Kunstverein, Salzburg, Austria (2002); Deichtorhallen, Hamburg, Germany; Irish Museum of Modern Art (2009); Guild Hall, Easthampton, New York (2006); Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, Ridgefield, Connecticut (2008); Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum, where Ghost: Elizabeth Peyton, a retrospective of the artist‚Äôs prints, was presented concurrently with the same exhibition at the Opelvillen in R√ºsselsheim, Germany (2011); Metropolitan Opera, New York (2011 and 2016).

The Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) is an internationally agreed- upon standard managed by the United Nations that was set up to replace the assortment of hazardous material classification and labelling schemes previously used around the world. Core elements of the GHS include standardized hazard testing criteria, universal warning pictograms, and harmonized safety data sheets which provide users of dangerous goods with a host of information. The system acts as a complement to the UN Numbered system of regulated hazardous material transport. Implementation is managed through the UN Secretariat. Although adoption has taken time, as of 2017, the system has been enacted to significant extents in most major countries of the world. This includes the European Union, which has implemented the United Nations' GHS into EU law as the CLP Regulation, and United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration standards. History Before the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) was created and implemented, there were many different regulations on hazard classification in use in different countries, resulting in multiple standards, classifications and labels for the same hazard. Given the $1.7 trillion per year international trade in chemicals requiring hazard classification, the cost of compliance with multiple systems of classification and labeling is significant. Developing a worldwide standard accepted as an alternative to local and regional systems presented an opportunity to reduce cost and improve compliance. The GHS development began at the 1992 Rio Conference on Environment and Development by the United Nations also called Earth Summit (1992) when the International Labour Organization (ILO), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), various governments and other stakeholders agreed that \\"A globally harmonized hazard classification and compatible labelling system, including material safety data sheets and easily understandable symbols, should be available if feasible, by the year 2000\\". The universal standard for all countries was to replace all the diverse classification systems; however, it is not a compulsory provision of any treaty. The GHS provides a common infrastructure for participating countries to use when implementing a hazard classification and Hazard Communication Standard. Hazard classification The GHS classification system is a complex system with data obtained from tests, literature, and practical experience. The main elements of the hazard classification criteria are summarized below: =Physical hazards= Substances or articles are assigned to 8 different hazard classes largely based on the United Nations Dangerous Goods System.UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods - Model Regulations, Rev. 19 Volume I 2015, United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, retrieved 6 November 2015 Additions and changes have been necessary since the scope of the GHS includes all target audiences. # Explosives, which are assigned to one of six subcategories depending on the type of hazard they present, as used in the UN Dangerous Goods System. # Gases are category 1 flammable if they start to flame in a range in air at 20 ¬∞C (68 ¬∞F) and a standard pressure of 101.3 kPa. Category 2 is Non flammable and non toxic gases, and category 3 is toxic gases. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories on the basis of the outcome of the test or calculation method. # A flammable liquid is a liquid with a flash point of not more than 93 ¬∞C (199.4 ¬∞F). Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of four hazard categories on the basis of the flash point and boiling point. A pyrophoric liquid is a liquid that, even in small quantities, is liable to ignite within five minutes after coming into contact with air. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to a single hazard category on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test N.3. # A flammable solid is one that is readily combustible or may cause or contribute to fire through friction. Readily combustible solids are powdered, granular, or pasty substances which are dangerous if they can be easily ignited by brief contact with an ignition source, such as a burning match, and if the flame spreads rapidly. it is further divided into ‚Ä¢ flammable solids, ‚Ä¢ polymerizing substances # self-reactive substances, are thermally unstable solids liable to undergo a strongly exothermic thermal decomposition even without participation of oxygen (air), other than materials classified as explosive, organic peroxides or as oxidizing. # pyrophoric substance more colloquially described as spontaneously combusting substances are those solids or liquids that even in small quantities are liable to ignite within five minutes after coming into contact with air. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to a single hazard category on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test N.2. # Self-heating substances A self-heating solids or liquids, other than a pyrophoric substance, is one which, by reaction with air and without energy supply, are liable to self-heat. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test N.4. Substances which on contact with water emit flammable gases are liable to become spontaneously flammable or to give off flammable gases in dangerous quantities. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of three hazard categories on the basis of the outcome of UN Test N.5, which measures gas evolution and speed of evolution. Flammable aerosols can be classified as Class 1 or Class 2 if they contain any component, which is classified as flammable. # Oxidizing substances and organic peroxides contain ‚Ä¢ category 1: oxidizing substances and ‚Ä¢ category 2: organic peroxides, organic liquids or solids that contain the bivalent -O-O- structure and may be considered a derivative of hydrogen peroxide, where one or both of the hydrogen atoms have been replaced by organic radicals. The term also includes organic peroxide formulations (mixtures). Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of seven 'Types', A to G, on the basis of the outcome of the UN Test Series A to H. #Radioactive substances # Substances corrosive to metal are substances or mixtures that by chemical action will materially damage or even destroy metals. These substances or mixtures are classified in a single hazard category on the basis of tests (Steel: ISO 9328 (II): 1991 - Steel type P235; Aluminum: ASTM G31-72 (1990) - non-clad types 7075-T6 or AZ5GU-T66). The GHS criteria are a corrosion rate on steel or aluminum surfaces exceeding 6.25 mm (0.246063in) per year at a test temperature of 55 ¬∞C (131¬∞F). #Miscellaneous dangerous substances =Health hazards= * Acute toxicity includes five GHS categories from which the appropriate elements relevant to transport, consumer, worker and environment protection can be selected. Substances are assigned to one of the five toxicity categories on the basis of LD50 (oral, dermal) or LC50 (inhalation). * Skin corrosion means the production of irreversible damage to the skin following the application of a test substance for up to 4 hours. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to a single harmonized corrosion category. * Skin irritation means the production of reversible damage to the skin following the application of a test substance for up to 4 hours. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to a single irritant category. For those authorities, such as pesticide regulators, wanting more than one designation for skin irritation, an additional mild irritant category is provided. * Serious eye damage means the production of tissue damage in the eye, or serious physical decay of vision, following application of a test substance to the front surface of the eye, which is not fully reversible within 21 days of application. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to a single harmonized category. * Eye irritation means changes in the eye following the application of a test substance to the front surface of the eye, which are fully reversible within 21 days of application. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to a single harmonized hazard category. For authorities, such as pesticide regulators, wanting more than one designation for eye irritation, one of two subcategories can be selected, depending on whether the effects are reversible in 21 or 7 days. * Respiratory sensitizer means a substance that induces hypersensitivity of the airways following inhalation of the substance. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to one hazard category. * Skin sensitizer means a substance that will induce an allergic response following skin contact. The definition for \\"skin sensitizer\\" is equivalent to \\"contact sensitizer\\". Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to one hazard category. * Germ cell mutagenicity means an agent giving rise to an increased occurrence of mutations in populations of cells and/or organisms. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories. Category 1 has two subcategories. * Carcinogenicity means a chemical substance or a mixture of chemical substances that induce cancer or increase its incidence. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories. Category 1 has two subcategories. * Reproductive toxicity includes adverse effects on sexual function and fertility in adult males and females, as well as developmental toxicity in offspring. Substances and mixtures with reproductive and/or developmental effects are assigned to one of two hazard categories, 'known or presumed' and 'suspected'. Category 1 has two subcategories for reproductive and developmental effects. Materials which cause concern for the health of breastfed children have a separate  effects on or via Lactation. * Specific target organ toxicity (STOT) category distinguishes between single and repeated exposure for Target Organ Effects. All significant health effects, not otherwise specifically included in the GHS, that can impair function, both reversible and irreversible, immediate and/or delayed are included in the non-lethal target organ/systemic toxicity class (TOST). Narcotic effects and respiratory tract irritation are considered to be target organ systemic effects following a single exposure. Substances and mixtures of the single exposure target organ toxicity hazard class are assigned to one of three hazard categories. Substances and mixtures of the repeated exposure target organ toxicity hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories. * Aspiration hazard includes severe acute effects such as chemical pneumonia, varying degrees of pulmonary injury or death following aspiration. Aspiration is the entry of a liquid or solid directly through the oral or nasal cavity, or indirectly from vomiting, into the trachea and lower respiratory system. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of two hazard categories this hazard class on the basis of viscosity. =Substitute substances= Sometimes companies are able to replace hazardous substances with substances featuring a reduced health risk. As an assistance to assess possible substitute substances, the Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the German Social Accident Insurance (IFA) has developed the Column Model. On the basis of just a small amount of information on a product, substitute substances can be evaluated with the support of this table. The current version from 2020 already includes the amendments of the 12th CLP Adaptation Regulation 2019/521.Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the German Social Accident Insurance: The GHS Column Model as an aid to selecting substitute substances =Environmental hazards= * Acute aquatic toxicity means the intrinsic property of a material of causing injury to an aquatic organism in a short-term exposure. Substances and mixtures of this hazard class are assigned to one of three toxicity categories on the basis of acute toxicity data: LC50 (fish) or EC50 (crustacean) or ErC50 (for algae or other aquatic plants). In some regulatory systems these acute toxicity categories may be subdivided or extended for certain sectors. * Chronic aquatic toxicity means the potential or actual properties of a material to cause adverse effects to aquatic organisms during exposures that are determined in relation to the lifecycle of the organism. Substances and mixtures in this hazard class are assigned to one of four toxicity categories on the basis of acute data and environmental fate data: LC50 (fish) or EC50 (crustacea) or ErC50 (for algae or other aquatic plants) and degradation or bioaccumulation. =Classification of mixtures= The GHS approach to the classification of mixtures for health and environmental hazards is also complex. It uses a tiered approach and is dependent upon the amount of information available for the mixture itself and for its components. Principles that have been developed for the classification of mixtures, drawing on existing systems such as the European Union (EU) system for classification of preparations laid down in Directive 1999/45/EC. The process for the classification of mixtures is based on the following steps: # Where toxicological or ecotoxicological test data are available for the mixture itself, the classification of the mixture will be based on that data; # Where test data are not available for the mixture itself, then the appropriate bridging principles should be applied, which uses test data for components and/or similar mixtures; # If (1) test data are not available for the mixture itself, and (2) the bridging principles cannot be applied, then use the calculation or cutoff values described in the specific endpoint to classify the mixture. Testing requirements The GHS document does not include testing requirements for substances or mixtures. In fact, one of the main goals of the GHS is to reduce the need for animal testing. The GHS criteria for determining health and environmental hazards are test method neutral, allowing different approaches as long as they are scientifically sound and validated according to international procedures and criteria already referred to in existing systems. Test data already generated for the classification of chemicals under existing systems should be accepted when classifying these chemicals under the GHS, thereby avoiding duplicative testing and the unnecessary use of test animals. The GHS physical hazard criteria are linked to specific UN test methods. It is assumed that mixtures will be tested for physical hazards. Hazard communication Per GHS, hazards need to be communicated: * in more than one form (for example, placards, labels or SDS's). * with hazard statements and precautionary statements. * in an easily comprehensible and standardized manner. * consistent with other statements to reduce confusion. * taking into account all existing research and any new evidence. Comprehensibility is challenging for a single culture and language, so global harmonization is complex. The GHS Purple Book includes a comprehensibility-testing instrument in Annex 6. Factors that were considered in developing the GHS communication tools include: * Different philosophies in existing systems on how and what should be communicated; * Language differences around the world; * Ability to translate phrases meaningfully; * Ability to understand and appropriately respond to pictograms. =GHS label elements = The symbol for substances hazardous to the human health as implemented by the GHS. The standardized label elements included in the GHS are: * Symbols (GHS hazard pictograms): Convey health, physical and environmental hazard information, assigned to a GHS hazard class and category. Pictograms include the harmonized hazard symbols plus other graphic elements, such as borders, background patterns or cozers and substances which have target organ toxicity. Also, harmful chemicals and irritants are marked with an exclamation mark, replacing the European saltire. Pictograms will have a black symbol on a white background with a red diamond frame. For transport, pictograms will have the background, symbol and colors currently used in the UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods. Where a transport pictogram appears, the GHS pictogram for the same hazard should not appear. * Signal word: \\"Danger\\" or \\"Warning\\" will be used to emphasize hazards and indicate the relative level of severity of the hazard, assigned to a GHS hazard class and category. Some lower level hazard categories do not use signal words. Only one signal word corresponding to the class of the most severe hazard should be used on a label. * GHS hazard statement: Standard phrases assigned to a hazard class and category that describe the nature of the hazard. An appropriate statement for each GHS hazard should be included on the label for products possessing more than one hazard. The additional label elements included in the GHS are: * GHS precautionary statements: Measures to minimize or prevent adverse effects. There are four types of precautionary statements covering: prevention, response in cases of accidental spillage or exposure, storage, and disposal. The precautionary statements have been linked to each GHS hazard statement and type of hazard. * Product identifier (ingredient disclosure): Name or number used for a hazardous product on a label or in the SDS. The GHS label for a substance should include the chemical identity of the substance. For mixtures, the label should include the chemical identities of all ingredients that contribute to acute toxicity, skin corrosion or serious eye damage, germ cell mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive toxicity, skin or respiratory sensitization, or Specific Target Organ Toxicity (STOT), when these hazards appear on the label. * Supplier identification: The name, address and telephone number should be provided on the label. * Supplemental information: Non-harmonized information on the container of a hazardous product that is not required or specified under the GHS. Supplemental information may be used to provide further detail that does not contradict or cast doubt on the validity of the standardized hazard information. =GHS label format= The GHS includes directions for application of the hazard communication elements on the label. In particular, it specifies for each hazard, and for each class within the hazard, what signal word, pictogram, and hazard statement should be used. The GHS hazard pictograms, signal words and hazard statements should be located together on the label. The actual label format or layout is not specified in the GHS. National authorities may choose to specify where information should appear on the label or allow supplier discretion. There has been discussion about the size of GHS pictograms and that a GHS pictogram might be confused with a transport pictogram or \\"diamond\\". Transport pictograms are different in appearance than the GHS pictograms. Annex 7 of the Purple Book explains how the GHS pictograms are expected to be proportional to the size of the label text so that generally the GHS pictograms would be smaller than the transport pictograms. =Safety data sheet= The safety data sheet or SDS (The GHS dropped the word \\"material\\" from material safety data sheet in its final revisions) is specifically aimed at use in the workplace. It should provide comprehensive information about the chemical product that allows employers and workers to obtain concise, relevant and accurate information in perspective to the hazards, uses and risk management of the chemical product in the workplace. While there were some differences in existing industry recommendations and country specific requirements, there was agreement on a 16 section SDS to include the following headings in the order specified: # Identification # Hazard(s) identification # Composition/ information on ingredients # First-aid measures # Fire-fighting measures # Accidental release measures # Handling and storage # Exposure control/ personal protection # Physical and chemical properties # chemical stability and reactivity # Toxicological information # Ecological information # Disposal considerations # Transport information # Regulatory information # Other information The primary difference between the GHS and the international industry recommendations is that sections 2 and 3 have been reversed in order. The GHS SDS headings, sequence and content are similar to the ISO, European Union and ANSI MSDS/SDS requirements. The SDS should provide a clear description of the data used to identify the hazards. A table comparing the content and format of a MSDS/SDS versus the GHS SDS is provided in Appendix A of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) GHS guidance. Training Current training procedures for Hazard Communication in the United States are more detailed than the GHS training recommendations. Educating employees on the updated chemical and product classifications and related pictograms, signal words, hazard statements and precautionary measures at the level of detail by the national authority represents the greatest training challenge. Training will be a key component of the overall GHS approach and should incorporate information as it is introduced into the workplace. Employees and emergency responders will need to be trained on all new program elements, from hazard statements to pictograms. Bear in mind, if the importation of products using only GHS labeling is permitted prior to its adoption in the United States and Canada, employers may need to begin employee training earlier than expected. Implementation The United Nations goal was broad international adoption, and as of 2017, GHS has been adopted to varying degrees in nearly all major countries.

During an encounter with the Justice Society of America, Sandy the Golden Boy destroyed the Subspace Prototype, which unexpectedly tore Sorrow apart and hurled his remains into what Sorrow described as another \\"fractional dimension\\" and one of the \\"Subtle Realms\\". Sorrow's remains were found by a huge Lovecraftian entity called the \\"King of Tears\\", who revived him and bestowed on the villain a golden mask to contain his new form and allow him to manifest in the material world. Sorrow's face, warped beyond description, was now instantly fatal to all who see it. Sorrow was returned to Earth on the condition that he find a way to allow the King of Tears to manifest. On his return to Earth, Sorrow killed his wife by accident in his haste to remove his mask so she could see that it was him, and kidnaps Sandy, blaming him for his disfigurement and taking him to a theatre. Newly formed superhero team the \\"Seven Shadows\\"‚Äîconsisting of Dr. Nowhere, Jake Justice, the Shard, Man-At-Arms, Lodestar, the Scarab, and the Veil‚Äîattempted to stop Sorrow but, with the exception of the Scarab, they were all killed by Sorrow's gaze. The Scarab requested the aid of the Justice Society, who arrived as the King of Tears was materializing. The entity the Spectre reduced the monster to actual tears, which were contained and stored by the Green Lantern. Defeated, Sorrow fled. Later he helped remove a tumour from Black Adam's brain, causing him to join Sorrow to repay the debt. Sorrow somehow gained access to the Rock of Eternity and turns the wizard Shazam to stone with his gaze. In the present, the Justice Society defeat their evil counterparts in another rematch, but Sorrow then reveals that the artifact he stole was in fact the liquid form of the King of Tears, who materializes once freed. Although the Spectre is summoned to deal with the entity, the King of Tears on this occasion disables the Spectre. The Flash solicits the aid of Black Adam (who has had a change of heart) and uses their combined speed‚Äîthe Flash borrowing Black Adam's speed by tapping into the Speed Force‚Äîto punch Sorrow just as Doctor Mid-Nite‚Äîhis goggles having recorded Sorrow's face when Sorrow tried to attack the blind Mid-Nite earlier but only knocked him out briefly‚Äîshows Sorrow his own face, rendering Sorrow solid long enough for Garrick to strike him with such force that it apparently destroys both Sorrow and the King of Tears.JSA #16 - 20 (Nov. 2000 - March 2001). DC Comics. Reforming in an alternate dimension, Sorrow eventually encounters the consciousness of former Justice League of America villain Despero, and together the pair plan to take revenge on both the JLA and the Justice Society. After Sorrow turns the wizard Shazam to stone with his deadly stare, the pair free the Seven Deadly Sins from the Rock of Eternity. Despero takes control of Lex Luthor's form while seven members of the combined super teams are possessed by the Sins. The heroes are freed from the influence of the Sins by their team mates, and battle Sorrow and Despero, defeating them with teamwork.Virtue and Vice (Jan. 2002) Banished once again, Sorrow is retrieved when a new version of the Injustice Society, led by the Wizard, forms.

While Flash and Captain Boomerang face his monsters, Sorrow is defeated by Wonder Woman and Harley Quinn, Harley's insanity rendering her immune to his gaze while Wonder Woman uses her bracelet to hit Sorrow with his own reflection.Justice League VS Suicide Squad #4. DC Comics. Powers and abilities Johnny Sorrow was a normal human until an accident with a teleportational device shredded his body and transported his remains to another dimension. An entity called the King of Tears restores Sorrow's consciousness, which now inhabits a floating suit and mask. The character can become solid (and vulnerable) by removing the mask, although this also reveals Sorrow's altered face. Seeing Sorrow's face is instantly fatal to almost all living creatures, while in other cases it can cause catastrophic madness; there are only two people depicted who've survived gazing upon him. The first is Doctor Mid-Nite who does not perceive Sorrow's face the normal way. There also appears to be a psychological element to the effect of his face, as Harley Quinn looked at him directly and simply called him cute. In the aftermath, Quinn claimed that she has already gazed into the abyss once, plus she was already insane. Sorrow himself is apparently also vulnerable to his own gaze, due to a recorded image of his face causing temporary paralysis and the reflection of his face in Wonder Woman's bracelets causing him to 'disperse'. The character can also teleport, levitate, and has vast energy manipulation capabilities as he is able to bend both the physical and mystical energies of any opposing parties at will. In his most recent appearance, Sorrow has shown to be a leader of his benefactor's legions, as clashing his fists together over his mask calls forth a horde of eldritch demons through flaming portals which serve at his beck and call. If he's otherwise indisposed, his hordes are banished back to the inbetween dimension they hail from. He's also shown to have some minor matter altering abilities as he was able to readjust his mask back to its proper shape after Firestorm morphed it into tar.

An ammunition technical officer (ATO) is an officer involved in all aspects of the army's use of ammunition. This includes: bomb disposal, clearance of ERW, explosives accident investigation, procurement, in service management, storage, and inspection and repair. British Army ATOs are generally selected as captains, exclusively from within the Royal Logistic Corps; however when an ammunition technician (AT) warrant officer (WO) or senior non-commissioned officer (SNCO) is selected for commission, their AT qualification transfers to that of an ATO. One such example is Major Peter Norton GC. ATO training takes 17 months and requires attendance at the Royal Military College of Science and the Defence EOD Munitions Search School Kineton, formerly known as the Army School of Ammunition. After conclusion of the training, the new ATO may take command of an EOD troop within 11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal and Search Regiment RLC or be employed within an ammunition squadron or ammunition depot. In 11 EOD Regiment, the ATO performs, in addition to the troop commander's role, counterterrorism bomb disposal activities and IEDD within the UK, leading an EOD team. WO and SNCO ATs may also lead EOD teams, and when doing so are often referred to as the ATO. ATs and ATOs can undergo further EOD training at the Felix Centre within the Defence EOD Munitions Search School Kineton. ATOs are the UK's ammunition experts, with many years of experience in Palestine, Aden, Cyprus, Northern Ireland, the Balkans, Iraq, Afghanistan, and anywhere where the British Army have forces deployed and require EOD expertise and advice. Armed forces of other nations also have ATOs, some of which are trained by the British Army. These countries include Canada, New Zealand, and Singapore. =Operational honours= George Cross *Lieutenant WM Eastman GC, Royal Army Ordnance Corps. 24 December 1940. *Captain RL Jephson-Jones GC, Royal Army Ordnance Corps. 24 December 1940. *Major George Styles GC, Royal Army Ordnance Corps. 11 January 1972. *Captain Peter Norton GC, Royal Logistic Corps. 24 July 2005. *Captain Joe Varey GC.

Australian Army The Australian Army also employs ATOs, who are members of the Royal Australian Army Ordnance Corps (RAAOC). RAAOC ATOs are trained in Australia, and this training has also been made available to members of other regional (Asia/South Pacific) Defence Forces. Pakistan Army The Pakistan Army has ATOs who are trained at the Pakistan Army Ordnance College. They are selected from the officers of the Pakistan Army Ordnance Corps in almost the same manner as that of the British Army ATOs. They are specialists in the ammunition field, and have many years of experience within Pakistan and other countries, such as Liberia, Congo, Ivory Coast, Sudan, Congo, CAR and else where the Pakistan Army is deployed as part of the UN. Pakistan ATOs have the unique honour of handling / clearing IEDs and completing EOD Operations during War On Terror in Swat, North and South Waziristan Agencies and even in the settled areas of the countries. Most of the ATOs have specialized from CIED and EOD Trg programmes covered by British and US EOD institutes to assist the Engineers Corps as a technical expert to handle all IEDs and supervise their EOD activities and clearance of ERW. The major part of ATOs was in recent Operation Zarb-e-Azab. It is imperative to note and mention here, that, every field formation of Pakistan Army has a specified ATO appointment amongst its Staff Appointments to work as Advisor on Ammunition Matters to the Formation Commander directly. In UN, ATOs of the Battalions and Sector HQ work hand in glove with UNMAS for all EOD operations and clearance of ERW. South African Army The role and function of the South African Ammunition Corps is to ensure that only safe and effective ammunition is supplied to the Department of Defence and other users. Their functions includes participation in research and development, quality assurance, unit inspection, maintenance and disposal of ammunition.

There is a dual notion of cofiltered category which will be recalled below. Filtered categories A category J is filtered when * it is not empty, * for every two objects j and j' in J there exists an object k and two arrows f:jto k and f':j'to k in J, * for every two parallel arrows u,v:ito j in J, there exists an object k and an arrow w:jto k such that wu=wv. A filtered colimit is a colimit of a functor F:Jto C where J is a filtered category. Cofiltered categories A category J is cofiltered if the opposite category J^{mathrm{op}} is filtered. In detail, a category is cofiltered when * it is not empty * for every two objects j and j' in J there exists an object k and two arrows f:kto j and f':k to j' in J, * for every two parallel arrows u,v:jto i in J, there exists an object k and an arrow w:kto j such that uw=vw. A cofiltered limit is a limit of a functor F:J to C where J is a cofiltered category. Ind-objects and pro-objects Given a small category C, a presheaf of sets C^{op}to Set that is a small filtered colimit of representable presheaves, is called an ind-object of the category C. Ind- objects of a category C form a full subcategory Ind(C) in the category of functors (presheaves) C^{op}to Set. The category Pro(C)=Ind(C^{op})^{op} of pro-objects in C is the opposite of the category of ind-objects in the opposite category C^{op}. Œ∫-filtered categories There is a variant of \\"filtered category\\" known as a \\"Œ∫-filtered category\\", defined as follows. This begins with the following observation: the three conditions in the definition of filtered category above say respectively that there exists a cocone over any diagram in J of the form {  }rightarrow J, {j   j'}rightarrow J, or {irightrightarrows j}rightarrow J. The existence of cocones for these three shapes of diagrams turns out to imply that cocones exist for any finite diagram; in other words, a category J is filtered (according to the above definition) if and only if there is a cocone over any finite diagram d: Dto J. Extending this, given a regular cardinal Œ∫, a category J is defined to be Œ∫-filtered if there is a cocone over every diagram d in J of cardinality smaller than Œ∫. (A small diagram is of cardinality Œ∫ if the morphism set of its domain is of cardinality Œ∫.) A Œ∫-filtered (co)limit is a (co)limit of a functor F:Jto C where J is a Œ∫-filtered category.

Waves of Hinemoana are eroding the land A poetic name for the Pacific Ocean is Te moana nui a Kiwa (The great ocean of Kiwa). Kiwa's first wife, in some of these traditions, was Parawhenuamea, ancestor of streams that flow from the land to the sea and of fresh water generally. Kiwa's second wife was Hinemoana (Ocean woman), a personification of the sea. Kiwa and Hinemoana had a number of children.Orbell 1998:60 Children The names and numbers of their children vary in different accounts. One version names ten children and for most of these, gives details about the creatures they gave rise to:Best 1982:257 #Pipihura, ancestor of the cockle. #Te Uru-kahikahika, source of eels, lampreys and frostfish. #Wharerimu, ancestor of seaweed. #Hine- tapiritia, ancestor of certain molluscs and oysters. #Te Raengawha, origin of sea urchins, as well as various fishes. #Te Kiri-pakapaka, origin of the snapper and the gurnard. #Whatu-maomao, whose offspring include the grouper, the kingfish, and the kahawai. #Te Kohurangi #Kapuwai #Kaiwahawera, ancestor of the octopus. Others say that Kiwa is the brother of Hinemoana, or her guardian.Orbell 1998:60 Some MƒÅori tribes have stories in which Hinemoana is married to Rangi, the god of the sky. This causes jealousy on the part of Papa, the earth mother, another of Rangi's wives. The enmity between Hinemoana and Papa is shown in the way the sea is constantly attacking and eroding the land. In other areas of New Zealand, traditions about the guardians of the sea and the origin of its creatures were very different. For instance in the Mataatua canoe area, (the eastern Bay of Plenty) it appears that Hinemoana was unknown; their traditions concern a female deity named Wainui (Great Water) instead.Best 1982:252-257, Reed 1963:397 Shellfish family Kiwaidae  The shellfish family Kiwaidae are named after 'Kiwa, the goddess of shellfish in Polynesian Mythology'.

Built under the pretext of the 2004 Athens Olympic Games, its construction and operation have evolved into one of the biggest Greek scandals of the last decadefacthemall , a non-profit journalistic project on the Mall Athens case (in greek),Damian Mac Con Uladh, \\"Mall mayor gets a year in jail,\\" Athens News, 20 February 2009. involving real-estate, construction and commercial corporations, heads of government, ministers, mayors and the media. Its main competitors in the region of Attica are Golden Hall, Avenue, Athens Heart, River West and mainly Athens Metro Mall. Visitor information The Mall provides access for handicapped persons and has a play area for children, along with a babysitting service and a special children‚Äôs care area. It also has a first-aid area. Automated teller machines are available. Opening hours are Monday to Friday from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. and Saturday, 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. Restaurants, cafes and cinemas are open Monday to Sunday until the early hours, while parking areas operate from 9 a.m. to 3 a.m. The Mall‚Äôs Third Level houses a Village Cinema multiplex, an amusement park and a restaurant/food court area, which is open from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. Help desk, which can be found on the entrance, is open from 8.30 a.m. until 2 p.m. ss Access is by metro and suburban railway networks (Nerantziotissa station), as well as by the Attiki Odos highway. The Mall Athens controversy =The Olympic Games pretext= A sign outside The Mall reads: ‚ÄúOlympic Media Village‚Äù. That‚Äôs because The Mall is an Olympic project that was, nevertheless, inaugurated a full year after the Games (the Media Village was meant to provide accommodation to foreign journalists). Before the Olympics, the site currently occupied by the shopping center was grazing land for sheep. However, major road and rail infrastructure projects turned it into a prime piece of real-estate. The site belonged to the state and was meant for social housing. Instead, it was sold at a discount to Lamda Development, the Latsis Group subsidiary which erected The Mall. The agreement between the Greek state and Lamda focused on the construction of a housing complex to accommodate a number of foreign journalists during a 15-day period.\\"100.000 sq.m. built forever = How many journalists for 15 days?\\", facthemall (in greek) In exchange, the state changed the laws so that Lamda could build a giant shopping center on land which it did not own, under terms not allowed by the Greek Constitution. =\\"The largest illegal construction in Europe\\"?= The Mall scandal involves Spiros Latsis and his corporation, members of both major Greek political parties (including the former and current Prime Ministers), their government ministers (who introduced legislation contrary to the Constitution), the local mayor, Mr. Tzanikos (who came up with the idea for the construction and is currently being sued in court) and, last but not least, the president of Athens 2004, Gianna Angelopoulou. Against them, stood only a handful of citizens along with some members of the judiciary. Following a motion brought by a citizen, Dorilaos Klapakis, the Greek Supreme Court (SC) ruled in 2003 that the laws passed for The Mall were indeed unconstitutional and ordered the cessation of its construction. The housing impact of the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens (pdf), Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions, 2007 Lamda corporation and the state (ministries in charge and the police) ignored the ruling, so construction proceeded regardless. Over the next 3 years, major Greek politicians tried to fight the SC‚Äôs decision and avoid further legal repercussions by introducing legislation, contrary to the Constitution but favorable to the Mall, and then ruling the new laws untouchable by the Greek Supreme Court. In November 2005, one year after the Olympic Games, The Mall is inaugurated. Tens of stores and movie theatres, including multinational brands, operate illegally and without a license in spite of the police having pressed charges against them. The Mall also served at the time as an experiment in labor market conditions: within The Mall, the branch of Eurobank Ergasias, a bank also owned by the Latsis Group, operated for a while on Saturdays, in violation of labor legislation and with the acquiescence of the government. Moreover, Lamda has yet to meet most of the commitments it made towards Athens 2004, the local authority and the public organization that owned the land, when it was awarded the ‚ÄúMedia Village‚Äù project in March 2002: - Instead of hosting 6.000 journalists, as originally planned, the Media Village accommodated a mere 1.000. - The land purchase was only settled in early 2006. That means that the Mall was being built from 2001 to 2005 and eventually opened in late 2005 on public land that Lamda Development did not own or rent. - The park that Lamda was supposed to build next to The Mall is still a bus parking lot. =The Mall Athens trial= The case of the Mall was brought for a second time before the Supreme Court of Greece in 2003. Since then, and six years after the building was first ruled illegal, the SC has not yet reached a decision. A new date was set for October 2009. Lots of things will be at stake during the trial and the subsequent court decision. First and foremost, the very existence of The Mall itself. Second, whether the Greek government will still be able, through the gimmick of ad hoc legislation that it used over the Mall case, to ignore the Supreme Court's decisions in other important environmental cases that trouble this country. =The media black- out= Greek media (with slight exceptions,) played a dual part in the Mall case: while The Mall was under construction, they concealed the Media Village scandal, which, despite being obvious, did not receive as much as a comment. Outside Greece, the Latsis Group (which holds a majority stake in the Mall Athens) is also dealt with extreme caution by the international media. While the British newspapers The Times,Yachts and storms, Brussels has weathered it all, The Times, 28/10/2008Mandelson rejects ‚ÄòEU tittle-tattle‚Äô, The Times, 20/4/2005 and The Telegraph Latsis links with the EU are above board, Christopher Booker's notebook, The Telegraph, 1/5/2005 dealt with the close relationship between Spiro Latsis and Jos√© Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, they soon backtracked, under the threat of litigation. =Bomb attack= An explosive device behind a newspaper stand at The Mall Athens slightly injured two security staff on Sunday morning 20 January 2013. A warning was issued by telephone to a newspaper and a website about an hour earlier, allowing evacuation of the mall.http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_20/01/2013_479386 Ekhatemirini 20 January 2013, Bomb injures two at The Mall Athens. =Death= On March 27, 2019, a 40-year-old woman started approaching the handrail of the mall's 3rd floor, only to be seen falling from it internal stairs, and ending up on the 1st floor. There was direct intervention by the National Emergency Center, the police and the competent authorities. The woman was shortly after transported to the KAT Hospital, where it was confirmed that she had passed away. The event received wide news coverage and is believed that it was a suicide attempt. Ownership The Mall is owned by Lamda Development, a real- estate development firm within the Latsis Group, and HSBC Property Investments, each holding a 49.2% stake. The municipality of Marousi owns the rest.

The remains were discovered in 1911 in the Dordogne region of southwestern France in a limestone cave known as the Cap Blanc rock shelter. The find was made when a workman drove a pickaxe into the cliff face in the rock shelter, shattering the skull. It is the most complete Upper Paleolithic skeleton in Northern Europe. When Magdalenian Girl was acquired in 1926 for the Field Museum in Chicago, Illinois by Henry Field, then curator of Physical Anthropology, it was hailed as one of the most significant acquisitions the museum ever made. On the first day the precious specimen was exhibited, tens of thousands of visitors flocked to the museum to see it.  Skeletal analysis  = Sex = There was some speculation as to her sex but it was ultimately decided by the size and shape of her pelvic bones, which is a major indicator of sex in skeletons. = Age = There is still some debate about the age of Magdalenian Girl. For years, the individual was thought to be a young girl, because her wisdom teeth had not yet advanced, but new analysis indicates that her wisdom teeth were impacted, and that she was actually 25 to 35 years old when she died. This is the oldest recorded case of impacted wisdom teeth. Other evidence that indicated her age were fully fused epiphyses and degenerative wear on her vertebrae. According to Dr. Robert D. Martin, primatologist and Field Museum provost, along with Dr. William Pestle, Field Museum Collection Manager, Drs. Michael Colvard and Richard Jurevic of the College of Dentistry at the University of Illinois at Chicago, Magdalenian Girl is most likely significantly older than 18‚Äì21 years.  Teeth  There has been much debate over Magdalenian Girl's age due to her impacted wisdom teeth. According to Science Daily, impaction during the Stone Age was unknown because of the coarse diet of the period. This diet would have required more chewing and higher bite forces which could result in more growth of the jawbone and thereby creating more room for wisdom teeth to erupt. According to Robert D. Martin, \\"Finding impacted wisdom teeth 15,000 years ago indicates that the human diet might have already changed, some would say 'deteriorated,' earlier than previously thought.\\" Dr. Martin, along with Dr. William Pestle, Field Museum Collection Manager, Drs. Michael Colvard and Richard Jurevic of the College of Dentistry at the University of Illinois at Chicago studied the impacted wisdom teeth and came to the conclusion that she was employing new tools and technology.  Digital reconstruction  In 2012, anthropologists began scanning a replica skull of Magdalenian Girl to create a high resolution digital model. In order to do this, they used a high quality x-ray scanning machine to produce a CT scan, which recorded images of the skull from multiple angles. The digital reconstruction took place at Alloyweld Inspection Company. Unfortunately, when these remains were originally found, the archaeologists had accidentally shattered the skull with a pickaxe and had to piece it back together. Before the scanning process, the skull was in at least six pieces and was inexpertly put back together. This makes it difficult for anthropologists to understand what Magdalenian Girl looked like and to answer important questions about the remains. The new digital images will allow anthropologists to know if the skull has deteriorated in recent decades. The new images can also be used to digitally reconstruct the skull in order to prevent further damage. If a good enough scan is constructed, then facial reconstruction experts will be able to give a more accurate depiction of the individual. According to the Daily Herald, the best description for Magdalenian girl to date is that she was 5'4 and died around 24 years old. In 2013, a French sculptor named Elisabeth Daynes completed a facial reconstruction of Magdalenian Girl by using a printed version of the CT scan of the skull. The reconstruction includes strong cheekbones, decorative hair beads, and a Mona Lisa-like smile, in which the teeth are not visible.
