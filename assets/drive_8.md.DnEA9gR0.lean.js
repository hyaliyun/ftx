Willaumez joined the French Navy at the age of 14, and proved a competent sailor. Having risen to the rank of pilot, he started studying navigation, attracting the attention of his superiors up to Louis XVI himself. He became an officer and served under Antoine Bruni d'Entrecasteaux in his expedition to rescue Lap√©rouse and explore the Indian Ocean and Oceania (including Tasmania, also known as Van Diemen's Land). At the French Revolution, Willaumez rose in rank and served in Saint-Domingue, where he led a brilliant defence of the frigate Poursuivante against the 74-gun HMS Hercule in the Action of 28 June 1803. He fought the Haitian Revolution, commanding the station of Saint-Domingue. During the Empire, in 1806, Willaumez commanded a squadron in Atlantic campaign of 1806. He sailed to the Cape of Good Hope, Brazil and the Caribbean, disrupting British trade and harassing their forces. However, the insubordination of Prince J√©r√¥me Bonaparte, who served as Captain of V√©t√©ran in his squadron, forced him to miss a rich convoy. Later, a hurricane damaged and dispersed his ships, of which three were ultimately lost; the others limped back to France one by one. In May 1808, he attempted to regroup the ships scattered in Brest, Lorient and Rochefort into an eighteen-strong fleet to support the French colonies of the Caribbean; adverse weather and the poor state of the squadron thwarted the plan and he ended being blockaded in Rochefort, leading to the Battle of the Basque Roads, and fell out of favour with Napol√©on. After the war, Willaumez served at the Council of Naval Constructions and as Pair de France. He authored a dictionary of naval terms and sponsored a collection of ship models. He also commissioned Fran√ßois Roux to paint portraits of all the ships on which he had served, a collection known as the Album de Willaumez.  Career  = Early life = Willaumez was born to an infantry captainQuintin, (p. 367) says \\"artillery'; Levot (p.554) says \\"coast-guard\\". who died without fortune at the age of 68, leaving six orphan children. Jean-Baptiste being the older, he took upon himself to teach his younger brothers, all of whom would die in the service of the French Navy.Hennequin, p.237 In 1777, at the age of 14, he enlisted as an apprentice pilot boy on the 74-gun Bien-Aim√©, under Captain de Bougainville,Levot, p.554 in the squadron under Admiral du Chaffault. The year after, he was appointed to the 56-gun Flamand, bound for Mauritius, as an apprentice helmsman. Upon his arrival, he transferred to the coastal schooner Fourmi. When Fourmi was condemned,Roche (p.213) states that Fourmi was captured by a British privateer in 1797. he transferred to the Louise, on which he was wrecked on the reef off Tamarin.Roche (p.286) states that Louise served as a fluyt at Rochefort from 1778 and was condemned in 1783. Possibly a different ship. Willaumez eventually returned to France on the corvette Les Amis. = Service on Amazone = Arrived at Lorient, and finding no ship in need for his services, Willaumez went to Brest, where he was quickly enlisted as aid-pilot on the 90-gun Ville de Paris,Hennequin, p.238 which in late 1780 was being overhauled.La Ville de Paris (1764 ‚Äì 1782), troisponts.wordpress.com Weary of his inactivity during the work on Ville de Paris, Willaumez requested a transfer on a departing ship, and was appointed as a pilot to the frigate Amazone, under La P√©rouse, in January 1781. Cruising in the Bay of Biscay, Amazone captured the twelve-gun privateer lugger Pitt; Willaumez was given command of a prize crew and sailed her to Lorient. He then rejoined Amazone, which was escorting a convoy to America. Upon her arrival, Amazone was attached to the fleet of Admiral de Grasse, and took part in the Battle of the Saintes in April 1782. On 29 July, while sailing at the entrance of Chesapeake Bay, Amazone, then under Lieutenant de Moniguyot,Levot, p.555 met the British frigate HMS Santa Margarita; in the ensuing battle, Amazon lost her main mast, her foremast, struck her colours with half her crew dead or wounded. On the next day, the French squadron under Vaudreuil appeared and recaptured Amazon. Having stayed alone on the quarterdeck of Amazon, and twice seriously wounded, Willaumez was praised by the Admiral and promoted to first pilot. = Service on Astr√©e = In 1784, returned to France, Willaumez enlisted as first officer on the 700-ton merchantman Tharon, on which he made two trips to Saint Domingue. On the second time, he saved his ship, which was in danger of being wrecked at the entrance of the Loire. The year after, he returned to the French Royal Navy and embarked as first pilot on the aviso Sylphe;Hennequin, p.239 there again, he saved his ship when she sprang a leak after sailing off harbour, and sailed her to Rochefort. In Rochefort, Willaumez transferred on the fluyt Lionne, which sailed to the Caribbean. In 1786, he enlisted on the Forte, and transferred on the frigate Astr√©e, bound for the Indies. In this period, Willaumez took upon himself to study navigation and astronomy, for which he displayed such passion that the chief of the station, Saint-Riveuil, offered him a sextant and a chronometer. Willaumez also received a Reflecting circle from Louis XVI inscribed \\"Donn√© par le roi √† M. Willaumez, premier pilote\\". Astr√©e was called back to France, ferrying Antoine Bruni d'Entrecasteaux, governor of Mauritius. When, upon his arrival, Entrecasteaux was appointed to command the Patriote, he took Willaumez with him.Hennequin, p.240 = Service on Recherche in D'Entrecasteaux' expedition = When D'Entrecasteaux was tasked to investigate the fate of Lap√©rouse's expedition and given command of the Recherche, Willaumez, promoted to Ensign in 1791, followed him, and was tasked with navigation and chronometers. During the campaign, D'Entrecasteaux promoted him to Lieutenant, and appointed Knight of the Order of Saint Louis. In the course of the exploration, he also named the Willaumez Peninsula after him. D'Entrecasteaux died of scurvy on 21 July 1793 and his ships sailed to Java, where they were interned by the Dutch, who were then at war with France. Willaumez was detained for some time before he was able to sail to Mauritius, where he enlisted on the frigate Prudente, under Jean-Marie Renaud. On Prudente, he took part in the Action of 22 October 1794, where he commanded the battery of the frigate and received a hand wound. In recognition of his conduct, the governor of Mauritius granted Willaumez command of the corvette L√©g√®re and tasked him to carry the documents of D'Entrecasteaux' expedition to France. L√©g√®re anchored in Brest two months later. = Command of R√©g√©n√©r√©e in Sercey's squadron = In March 1795, Willaumez was promoted to Captain; in May, he was appointed to arm the 74-gun Pluton, on which he perfected techniques of rigging and cargo arrangement. He then ferried the corvette Berg√®re from Brest to Rochefort, in spite of the British blockade, and took command of the 40-gun frigate R√©g√©n√©r√©e.Hennequin, p.241 R√©g√©n√©r√©e was part of a two-corvette and four-frigate naval division under Rear-Admiral Sercey, tasked to sail to Mauritius and prey on British merchantmen in the Indian Ocean. During the campaign, she captured nineteen of the 23 prizes captured by the squadron and took part in the Action of 8 September 1796, where she suffered two killed and six wounded. With dwindling support from the colony of Mauritius, Sercey had to send R√©g√©n√©r√©e and Vertu, under Captain Magon, back to France.Troude, vol.3, p.55 The frigates departed the Indian Ocean theatre in September sailing from Mauritius to RochefortRoche, p.460 and escorting two merchantmen of the Spanish Royal Company of the Philippines to Europe.Fonds Marine, p.215 En route, the two frigates and two merchantmen stopped at √éles de Los to effect repair and gather water;Troude, vol.3, p.130 they anchored at Tamara, Vertu disassembling her masts and yards to restore her rigging, while R√©g√©n√©r√©e sailed to the nearby island of Factori. On 24 April, the 32-gun HMS Pearl, under Captain James Ballard, attacked Vertu; one hour into the battle, R√©g√©n√©r√©e, attracted by the cannonade, intervened and forced Pearl to flee. R√©g√©n√©r√©e chased Pearl for 36 hours before abandoning the pursuit. Chase between HMS Brilliant and Vertu and R√©g√©n√©r√©e. On 10 May 1798, the ships departed for Europe. Arrived at Tenerife, the merchantmen were put under the care of the governor, as they considerably retarded the travel of the frigates. On 27 July, as the frigates prepared to pursue their journey, they were observed by the 28-gun HMS Brilliant, under Henry Blackwood. At 6, the French frigates put to sail and started firing on Brilliant; R√©g√©n√©r√©e was closing in to her opponent when Vertu, which had sailed large, touched the wind; R√©g√©n√©r√©e imitated her manoeuver, but lost her mizzen and bowsprit, allowing Brilliant to flee. Vertu gave chase, but could not overhaul her opponent and returned to Tenerife. There, R√©g√©n√©r√©e replaced her rigging, and both frigates eventually arrived in Rochefort on 5 September. = Service in Saint-Domingue on Poursuivante = Promoted to Chef de Division in January 1799, Willaumez was ordered to Saint-Malo to lead a campaign of his own design with a three-frigate and one-corvette division. However, the expedition could not depart and Willaumez returned to Paris, where, along with Fleurieu, he documented D'Entrecasteaux' expedition. In 1801, at the Peace of Amiens, Willaumez was appointed to command the 74-gun Duguay-Trouin, part of a squadron under Rear-Admiral Latouche-Tr√©ville in Villaret de Joyeuse's fleet bound for Saint-Domingue;Hennequin, p.242 the squadron counted six ships of the line, six frigates and two corvettes, and was to ferry 3000 soldiers. Willaumez was given command of the Southern station of Saint-Domingue, and although he had no troops at his disposal there, he managed to maintain order. He also gained the trust of the black population, to the extent that General Laplume entrusted him two millions francs to carry to Port-au-Prince. In November 1802, after General de Rochambeau replaced Charles Leclerc, he started executing blacks by drowning; he had the entire garrison of Fort Dauphin transferred to Swiftsure and thrown overboard by her crew.Herpin, p.78 Rochambeau then ordered all French ships to carry out such executions; only Willaumez refused, stating that \\"The officers of the French Navy are not executioners. I will not obey.\\"Merrien, p.114Les officiers de la Marine fran√ßaise ne sont pas des bourreaux. Je n'ob√©irai pas! HMS Hercules, by Louis- Philippe Cr√©pin. After 18 months, Willaumez transferred his flag on the frigate Poursuivante, on which he served successively at the Western and Southern stations, and carried out a number of raids against the Haitian revolutionaries. On 27 June 1803, Poursuivante departed Les Cayes, bound for Cap-Ha√Øtien, in the company of the sixteen-gun corvette Mignonne,Troude, vol.3, p.286 under Jean Pierre Bargeau.James, p.187 In the early morning of 28 June 1803, Poursuivante spotted a large convoy of about fifty ships, with three ships of the line for escort; they were the 74-gun HMS Hercules, Cumberland and Goliath, which detached and set a course to intercept. At eight, the 74-gun HMS Hercules came in range, hoisted the British flag, prompting Poursuivante to hoist the French colours,Hennequin, p.243 and opened fire at nine. After two hours of mutual cannonade, the ships were close to shore and at eleven, the wind fell, favouring the shallower and more manoeuvrable frigate, which quickly came in position to rake Hercule and delivered a devastating broadside at her stern. The damage and confusion on Hercule were such that, probably fearing to run aground,Troude, vol.3, p.287James, p. she effectively dropped out of action, allowing Poursuivante to reach the safety of M√¥le-Saint-Nicolas.James, p.188 Goliath captured Mignonne after a brief chase and the exchange of a few token shots. Poursuivante had ten men killed and fifteen wounded. Her hull had sustained several shots and her rigging was much damaged. As Cap-Ha√Øtien lacked the resources to repair the frigate, Willaumez was authorised to sail her back to France.Hennequin, p.245 He then left harbour and sailed around the South of Cuba. A few days later, he spotted a British privateer, which he captured and had to scuttle by fire because his lack of food did not allow him to sail her to Charlestown. A gust of wind having dismasted Poursuivante, Willaumez was forced to make a port call in Baltimore and overhaul his frigate. When ready, he departed the Chesapeake, avoided the British blockade and crossed the Atlantic, reaching Rochefort on 28 May 1804. There, he was intercepted by a British ship of the line, which he battled for thirty minutes before breaking off and finding shelter at √éle-d'Aix. Willaumez had been made a Knight of the Order of the Legion of Honour in February. He was promoted to Officer in June, and congratulated by Navy minister Decr√®s. = Willaumez' raid in the Atlantic = In August 1804, Willaumez was appointed to command the 74-gun Alg√©siras. Departing from Lorient in December bound for Rochefort, Alg√©siras suffered a gust of wind that broke her tops. Willaumez nevertheless pursued and safely reached Rochefort, despite a British division blockading Quiberon and another anchored at Basque Roads.Hennequin, p.246 In March 1805, Willaumez had been promoted to Rear-Admiral, and he took command of the light squadron of the Naval Army in Brest, under Vice-Admiral Ganteaume. Willaumez set is flag on the 74-gun Alexandre. During one sortie of the French fleet, Alexandre had a duel with the 110-gun .Levot p.556 In late 1805, eleven ships were readied to set sail in two squadrons,Hennequin, p.247 one under Rear-Admiral Leiss√®gues, and the other under Willaumez; the squadrons departed on 13 December and separated on 15. Willaumez' comprised the 80-gun flagship Foudroyant, the 74-gun V√©t√©ran, Cassard, Imp√©tueux, √âole and Patriote, and the 40-gun frigates Valeureuse and Volontaire. Its mission was to sail to the Cape of Good Hope, replenish its water and provisions, harass British interests wherever opportune, and return no later than 15 months after. In the first days of the cruise, the division captured a number of prizes, before making a two-day port call at the Canary Islands to replenish its food. Willaumez detached Volontaire to ferry his prisoners to Santa Cruz de Tenerife. Arrived at the Cape of Good Hope, Willaumez learnt from the captain of a captured ship that Cape Town had been seized by the British in the Battle of Blaauwberg, in January 1806.Hennequin, p.248 With food supplies now unavailable and many of his men suffering from scurvy, Willaumez set sail for Brazil, where he arrived in early April 1806. After a 17-day port call in S√£o Salvador da Bahia, Willaumez set sail for Cayenne. There, he divided his squadron into three divisions, which he dispersed from Cayenne to the 9th parallel south; however, this tactic yielded disappointing results, and Willaumez regrouped his ships. He then decided to raid Barbados, and adverse winds and storms forced him to renounce and shelter in Martinique, where he arrived on 20 June. He replenished his water and food, and raided Montserrat. On 3 July his squadron captured a British schooner that the French took into service as Villaret. Three days later, on 6 July, off Saint Thomas, Willaumez spotted a British squadron comprising five ships of the line and seven frigates and corvettes, which sailed away with the advantage of the wind.Hennequin, p.249 He was then informed of the arrival of a squadron under Admiral Warren, and another under Admiral Strachan; without marines to attack British colonies in the Caribbean and reckoning that no convoy would depart for Europe as long as he would be known to lurk in the area, Willaumez decided to position his forces to intercept the convoy from Jamaica. However, in the night of 1 August, the 74-gun V√©t√©ran, under Prince J√©r√¥me Bonaparte, disappeared.Hennequin, p.250 Willaumez fruitlessly searched the missing ship in several directions until he became certain that she was en route for France, and returned to his station; the convoy, however, had already passed. Willaumez lingered a while in the hope that the convoy might still be yet to come, but in the night of 19 to 20 August, his fleet sustained a hurricane that damaged most of the ships. Foudroyant, having lost both her rudder and her masts, managed to limp back to Havana on jury rigging, but was intercepted and attacked by HMS Anson; as she had retained her full firepower, Foudroyant drove her opponent away within half an hour despite her lack of manoeuvrability, and entered harbour. After a four-month stay in Havana, Willaumez departed for Chesapeake Bay to rejoin Patriote, √âole and Valeureuse, which had taken refuge there after the hurricane. Adverse weather prevented him, and Willaumez instead sailed back to France, arriving in Brest in February 1807. The division had returned dispersed and lost several ships: Imp√©tueux had managed to build a jury rudder, but had been intercepted by a British squadron and forced to beach herself to avoid capture; √âole and Valeureuse had been sold for scrap in Annapolis; V√©t√©ran had found an unlikely shelter in Concarneau, normally far too shallow to harbour a ship of the line, where she was blockaded; Patriote later reached Brest, and Cassard, Lorient.Hennequin, p.251 The damage to British shipping was evaluated to 12 to 15 million francs. = Attempt at uniting the Brest, Lorient and Rochefort squadrons = In May 1808, Willaumez was appointed to command a nine-ship, three-frigate and three-corvette squadron.Hennequin, p.252 It departed on 21 February 1809, with orders to make its junction with the division of Lorient that was blockaded in its harbour, attach these ships, attack the British squadron blockading Rochefort, attach the Rochefort squadron under Admiral BergeretGloires Maritimes, p.4 and, by then totaling 18 ships, sail to the Caribbean to rescue Martinique and Guadeloupe. Willaumez led his division to Lorient and Rochefort as instructed, but none of the squadrons joined forces with his: The Lorient squadron was becalmed and could not depart until after Willaumez had left, leading to the Battle of Les Sables-d'Olonne; and the Rochefort squadron was too affected by sickness to sail. Displeased with Willaumez' performance, Napol√©on removed him from command of the fleet and kept him in subordinate roles from then on.Levot, p.557 The arrival of a large British squadron blockaded Willaumez himself in Rochefort, where the concentration of French ships constituted a tempting target for the British. They eventually attacked with fireships at the Battle of the Basque Roads. = Later life = Willaumez in 1840, wearing the badge and silver star of Grand Officier on the Legion of Honour. Portrait by Pierre-Victorien Lottin. In 1811, Willaumez was ordered to Holland to command a division in the fleet under Admiral de Winter. However, his declining health forced him to request his transfer back to France after one year. In 1819, after the Bourbon Restoration, Willaumez was promoted to Vice- Admiral. In 1825, he published a dictionary of naval terms,Willaumez, Dictionnaire de marine and later presided over the Council of Constructions of the Navy. He also commissioned a collection of ship models. He was promoted Grand-Officier of the Order of the Legion of Honour in 1828. In January 1834, Willaumez became the president of the Council of Constructions.Taillemite, p.446 In 1836, he led an enquiry, along with Baron Rolland, into the destruction by fire of the 120-gun ship Trocad√©ro.Taillemite, p.442 In 1837, he was made a pair de France, and retired. In 1844, Louis-Phillipe made him a Count, a title that Willaumez transmitted to then Captain Bou√´t, who from then on assumed the name of Bou√´t-Willaumez.  Honours  Willaumez' name on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. * pair de France in 1837 * His name is inscribed on the 22nd column of the Southern pillar of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.  Legacy  During the Empire, Willaumez advocated the construction of strong, sixty-gun frigates, capable of carrying food for ten months and water for four, mounting the new 30-pounder long gun rather than the 36- and 24-pounders that dated from before the French Revolution. In 1822, the project was adopted by Jean Tupinier,Taillemite, p.432 resulting in the Surveillante-class frigates and similar developments during the Bourbon Restoration.

The station is owned by Knight Broadcasting Inc. and broadcasts a news/talk format. History The station first signed on January 17, 1947 as KCOY at the 1400 kHz frequency. It was launched by News-Press Publishing Company, owner of KTMS in Santa Barbara and the Santa Barbara News-Press. On April 5, 1955, KCOY was sold to Arenze Broadcasters, headed by James H. Ranger, for $34,000. It moved to 1440 kHz in 1960. In its early years, KCOY was a full service station, broadcasting a variety of news, sports, and rock music programming. In April 1969, Ranger bought out his Arenze Broadcasters partners for $250,000, taking full ownership of KCOY. The station then changed its call letters to KUHL. In 1986, Ranger sold KUHL and FM sister station KXFM in Santa Maria to Great Electric Communications Inc. for $2.25 million. Five years later, in 1991, Great Electric sold KUHL and KXFM to Roger Blaemire's Blackhawk Communications Inc. for $1.15 million. On September 19, 2006, KUHL switched call signs to KINF. Three years later, on January 27, 2009, the station reverted to the KUHL call letters. Transmission issues On March 1, 1989, the transmitters for four stations in Santa Maria, including KUHL, were knocked off the air due to acts of vandalism. That evening, the towers fell as guy wires supporting the structures had been cut. Two males, ages 18 and 15, were suspected of inflicting the damage, which was estimated to be $100,000. On January 20, 2010, lightning struck the KUHL transmitter, knocking the station off the air temporarily.

Consisting of 5 dwellings plus numerous other buildings used for commercial or farming business, in 2001 the parish had a population of 12 people. In the 2011 Census population details were recorded under Long Lawford. It is located just to the north of the River Avon, which is crossed here by a ford on the lane linking it with Long Lawford. It is also linked to Long Lawford by a bridleway which crosses the Avon on a bridge.OS Explorer 222 Little Lawford Hall The current Little Lawford Hall, originally the stables of the former hall In the hamlet is Little Lawford Hall. The original hall was built during the reign of Henry VII, possibly on the site of an earlier monastic grange which belonged to the monks of Pipewell. It became the ancestral home of the Rouse-Boughton family. According to folklore, one of the Boughtons lost his arm during the reign of Elizabeth I and his ghost known as 'One-handed Boughton' continues to haunt the area. In 1780 the hall was the scene of a notorious murder case, when the heir to the family fortune Theodosius Boughton, died under mysterious circumstances while still a minor. It was soon determined that the cause of his death was poisoning, and suspicion soon fell on his brother-in-law, Captain John Donellan, husband of his sister, who would stand to gain the family inheritance if Theodosius died before the age of 21. Despite protesting his innocence, Donellan was tried and convicted of Boughton's murder, and hanged at Warwick the following year. Following these tragic events the family decided to demolish the hall in around 1790, sell the estate, and move elsewhere. Nothing now remains of it except foundations. The current house known as Little Lawford Hall was originally the stables to the previous hall which were converted for human habitation in around 1800. The date inset above the front porch is 1604, which may have been when it was first built. Little Lawford Mill Little Lawford Mill Also at Little Lawford is the former watermill on the Avon. A mill was recorded here in the Domesday Book, and milling was a continuous activity here until as late as the 1920s. The former mill now without a waterwheel is now a private house.

History SKS was founded in 1956 by the municipalities of Bod√∏, Bodin and Fauske to create a power grid from the power stations in Sulitjelma to Outer Salten where the largest population was located. The municipalities had cooperated in building the power plants, but needed a separate company to transport the electricity. In the end of the 50s SKS built the Deja station. The current structure of the company arose in 1975 with a merger of Salten Kraftlag. In the 1980s there was major work on creating a vertical integrated power company for all of Salten, and in the long term a county municipality owned company for all of Nordland. But local fluctuation and concern for every petty local job made a consolidation impossible. In 1991 the new energy law was passed, killing the process.

He spent most of his adult life in Mid Glamorgan, first at Tondu and later at Porthcawl. He was the junior partner in John Brogden and Sons. In 1853/4, Brogdens bought the iron and coal mining business at Tondu, Mid-Glamorgan of Sir Robert Price. Price had got into difficulties during recessions in the iron trade in the 1840s. In February 1854, John Brogden sent his son James, then aged 22, to revive and run the business, which was very run down. In July 1854, John Brogden signed a new 99-year lease with Jane Nicholl. James rapidly reorganised the works and established his home at Tondu House, which he rebuilt. In the 1861 census, James said he was employing 900 men and farming with 20 men. In September 1859, James married Helen Dunbar Milne, a granddaughter of Lady Helen Dunbar of Tunbridge Wells, in St George's, Hanover Square. At first, the marriage was happy but in February 1864 an affair began between Helen and John Popkin Traherne, who lived at nearby Coytrahen House. Brogden petitioned for a divorce in February 1865 and this was granted. When John Brogden Senior died in December 1869, Alexander assumed his father‚Äôs position as head of John Brogden and Sons and came to Tondu to assume control. He took a lease on Coytrahen House ‚Äì where Mrs Brogden had committed adultery - even though James had offered to vacate Tondu House for his use. This hurt James terribly and created a rift, which was bad for both the family and the business because it was hard for the two men to maintain cordial relations.See Letter JB to AB deposited at National Library of Wales in Picton Papers (Brogden Papers) James went out to New Zealand on behalf of the family firm to negotiate the contracts with the government to build railways using emigrants from the UK. He left Liverpool in August 1871 and returned to England early in 1873. The diaryNational Library of Wales Picton Papers (Brogden No. 1) Online that he kept during his journey shows that he was engaged in very difficult and protracted negotiations. It runs to over 100 pages of manuscript and offers a very readable account of the places he visited and the people he met. James's companions on this journey were: \\"Dunny\\" (his son Duncan Dunbar Milne Brogden), \\"Fielding\\" (his servant) and \\"Llewellyn\\" (a friend). By \\"Llewellyn\\" he almost certainly meant Robert William Llewellyn (1849-1910). This gentleman was at the right age for such an adventure. He later inherited Baglan Hall and Court Colman Manor and Court Colman is close to Tondu.W. T. Pike (1907), Contemporary Biographies (Pike's New Century Series, No. 20), pub. W. T. Pike & Co., 19 Grand Parade, Brighton, tells us that Robert went to New Zealand in 1872. In 1874 shortly after his return, James married as his second wife Mary Caroline Beete, daughter of John Picton Beete, a nephew of Gen. Sir Thomas Picton. While James was in New Zealand, Alexander had taken control of the South Wales business, forming a new company, the Llynvi, Tondu and Ogmore Coal and Iron Company. As he was no longer required at Tondu, James made his new home in Porthcawl. After the dissolution of John Brogden and Sons, Mrs Brogden purchased approximately adjoining the new Porthcawl dock that her husband had bought for the company in 1865, and by the end of the century, she had developed the early stages of the modern town of Porthcawl. In 1906, however, the Great Western Railway that then owned the dock, closed it because its trade had been diverted to newer docks at Port Talbot and Barry. This reduced the value of her properties, which were heavily mortgaged. This hastened James's death, which occurred at his home, the Esplanade Hotel, on 25 January 1907. Afterwards, most of Mrs Brogden‚Äôs property had to be sold and she moved to 72 Victoria Avenue where she died on 5 November 1927. .

Hugh was given the middle name \\"Owen\\" after Robert Owen, the patron of the utopian socialist community that Pentecost's parents had joined at New Harmony. At the age of two, his family moved to Albion, Illinois.Robert Helms, \\"Hugh Owen Pentecost (1848‚Äì1907) A Biographical Sketch\\". After a short stint as a printer in Kentucky, Pentecost attended Colgate University in upstate New York, and after graduating in 1872, he entered the Baptist ministry. He preached at Baptist churches in Brooklyn; Long Island; Westerly, Rhode Island; Hartford, Connecticut; and Brooklyn. In 1871, while pastoring the Rockville Center, Long Island Baptist Church, he married Laura Anderson, the daughter of a successful Brooklyn confectioner. In 1873, Hugh and Laura left the Baptists in a dispute over the practice of \\"Free Communion,\\"\\"Rev.

Shortly after his wedding, he once again became a pastor for a Baptist church in Brooklyn, but Pentecost left the Baptist denomination, and became a pastor for non-denominational church in Manhattan and then the Belleville-Avenue Congregation Church in Newark, New Jersey. Pentecost became widely known for his eloquent sermons and his support for anti-poverty causes, Georgist land reform, socialism, and nonresistance. In 1887, he began to make speeches for Henry George's Anti-Poverty Society,\\"Anti-Poverty's Apostles: Speeches at Two Meetings of the Society,\\" New York Times, June 20, 1887; \\"Talking to the Printers: Mr. Pentecost at an Anti-Poverty Meeting,\\" New York Times, September 24, 1887. ran and lost a race for mayor of Newark on the United Labor ticket,\\"Pentecost for Mayor,\\" New York Times, October 5, 1887; \\"Surprises of the Election,\\" New York Times, October 13, 1887; \\"Tired of Mr. Pentecost's Vagaries,\\" New York Times, November 23, 1887. and delivered a sermon in protest of the hanging of the Haymarket martyrs.\\"Pentecost Defends Them,\\" New York Times, November 14, 1887; \\"Tired of Mr. Pentecost's Vagaries,\\" New York Times, November 23, 1887. His increasingly political and theologically unorthodox sermons led to controversy within his congregation in Newark; in December 1887, he resigned from his post and announced that \\"My studies furthermore have given me such changed opinions regarding many fundamental doctrinal ideas that I feel I can no longer remain in the orthodox ministry or the orthodox church.\\"\\"Tired of Mr. Pentecost's Vagaries,\\" New York Times, November 23, 1887; \\"His Advice to the Jury; the Rev.

He often corresponded and shared platforms with radicals such as Benjamin Tucker and Daniel De Leon.

In December 1893, John R. Fellows appointed him as an Assistant District Attorney in New York City,\\"Hugh O. Pentecost's Appointment: Made an Assistant District Attorney‚ÄîHis Varied Career,\\" New York Times, December 30, 1893. Page 9 but news of the appointment soon provoked controversy over both his lack of experience as a lawyer, and his radical political and religious views.\\"Pentecost Doesn't Please: Much Fault-Finding with Col. Fellows's Appointee,\\" New York Times, December 31, 1893. Page 3; \\"Pentecost Out in the Cold: His Infliction on the Public May Be Averted,\\" New York Times, January 2, 1894. In response to the protests, Fellows claimed that he had known nothing of Pentecost's views at the time of the appointment. Fellows withdrew the appointment, and Pentecost prepared a statement, in which he disavowed his protests against the Haymarket hangings, and stated that \\"he who says that I am or ever was a Socialist or Anarchist, says what is not true.\\" He added that \\"I now know that we live in a world in which the government and the social system which prevail are the best that human beings, in their highest wisdom, have been able to construct; that law is necessary and must be obeyed if society is to exist at all; that punishments must be inflicted on those who infringe the personal or property rights of others. I am now as firm a believer as any one in the practical necessity of the governmental system we have and enjoy.\\" Pentecost stated that although he believed he could faithfully fulfill the position with his current beliefs, he would decline the position so as not to embarrass Fellows by association with him.\\"Pentecost Loses the Plum: Forced to Yield a Place with the District Attorney,\\" New York Times, January 3, 1894. Page 5. Pentecost's statement, which was reprinted in the Twentieth Century and many newspapers, drew sharp criticism from some of Pentecost's radical friends, who believed him to be dissembling about his views in order to curry public opinion.Benjamin Tucker, \\"A False Confession,\\" Liberty, February 24, 1894; Voltairine de Cleyre, \\"They Who Marry Do Ill,\\" Mother Earth 11, no. 11, January 1908. ¬∂ 27. After the withdrawal of his appointment, Pentecost continued in private practice and became prominent in both civil and criminal law. In 1896, he unsuccessfully defended Carl Feigenbaum, who was executed for the murder of Mrs Juliana Hoffmann. Feigenbaum gained posthumous infamy as an unlikely suspect in the Jack the Ripper murders.Vanderlinden, Wolf (2008). \\"Carl Ferdinand Feigenbaum: An Old Suspect Resurfaces\\", in Ripper Notes: The Legend Continues, Inklings Press, pp. 4‚Äì24,  Return to radical politics  In 1897, Pentecost returned to lecturing on political and religious topics, and reopened his \\"Unity Congregation.\\"\\"Pentecost Starts Anew: A Congregation That Will Not Be Asked to Subscribe to Any Set Creed,\\" New York Times, September 13, 1897; \\"On Good Citizenship: Hugh O.

Pentecost Arrested: Ex-Assistant District Attorney Was About to Speak in Schenectady,\\" New York Times, February 26, 1906. Pentecost repeatedly spoke out against the turn-of-the-century prohibitionist campaigns to shut down saloons, gambling, and brothels. He argued that the \\"vice crusades\\" little more than hypocritical cover for the Republican Party's ambitions to unseat Tammany Hall in the New York City government. Pentecost argued that vice laws only relocated vice behind closed doors, and created opportunities for police corruption. Instead of crackdowns by city government, he argued, all vice laws should be repealed, as \\"The true remedy for all evil is in freedom. Truth makes you free.\\"\\"Hugh O.

Ford told William Colby, the Director of Central Intelligence, to \\"go ahead and do it,\\" with an initial US$ 6 million in funding.

Two days prior to the program's approval Assistant Secretary Davis told Henry Kissinger, the Secretary of State, that he believed maintaining the secrecy of IA Feature would be impossible.

When Ford approved the program Davis resigned.Brown, Seyom. The Faces of Power: Constancy and Change in United States Foreign Policy from Truman to Clinton, 1994. Page 303. John Stockwell, the CIA's station chief in Angola, echoed Davis' criticism saying the program needed to be expanded to be successful, but the program was already too large to be kept out of the public eye. Mulcahy, Davis' deputy also opposed direct involvement. Mulcahy presented three options for U.S. policy towards Angola on May 13, 1975. He believed the Ford administration could use diplomacy to campaign against foreign aid to the Communist People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), refuse to take sides in factional fighting, or increase support for the FNLA and UNITA.

Description The Port of Vancouver USA is the furthest-inland deep-water port along the Columbia River, located in Vancouver, Washington and founded in 1912. The port contains five terminals along with the largest mobile harbor crane in North America which is typically used to unload wind energy equipment. The port is a government agency governed by three locally elected commissioners.  Marine terminals  The Port of Vancouver owns and operates four active marine terminals, with berths maintained at a mean depth of 43 feet. Port terminals handle liquid bulk, dry bulk, break bulk, project cargo, and roll-on-roll-off \\"RORO\\" cargo. Frequent callers include ships exporting grain, bentonite clay, and copper concentrate, and importing slab steel, Subaru automobiles, and wind energy components. Twin mobile harbor cranes allow offloading and handling of non-conventional high, wide, and heavy (HWH) cargoes. Waterfront redevelopment The port is redeveloping a 10-acre part of its Terminal 1 property on the Columbia River, located between the proposed Waterfront Park and the Interstate Bridge, into a mixed-use waterfront neighborhood. The NBBJ- designed project is planned to begin construction in 2017 and will include of office space targeted towards biotech companies, retail spaces, up to 180 hotel rooms, up to 250 housing units, and a public market. Vancouver Energy project The Vancouver Energy project was a proposed crude oil transport hub, with crude-by-rail offloading, storage, and marine export. Proposed by a joint venture between Tesoro Refining & Marketing Company and Savage Companies,Vancouver Energy Who we are Vancouver Energy n.d.retrieved January 8, 2016 it was met with significant resistance locally, with critics citing safety risks and environmental impacts. Opposition arose from a wide array of organizations including firefighters, local elected officials and neighborhood associations, faith groups, small businesses, Native American tribes, and environmental non-profits. During its lengthy review process by the Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council (EFSEC), contentious elections resulted in two of the Board of Commissioner's three members being replaced with candidates opposed to the terminal's construction. In December 2017, EFSEC unanimously recommended denial of a permit to build the project, and in January 2018 Washington Governor Jay Inslee denied the permit. In February 2018, the Port of Vancouver and the joint venture agreed to terminate the ground lease, effectively ending the proposed project.

In March 1999, the station revamped its lineup, replacing Sandy Shore and Christopher with live DJ's Jae Jae (middays) and Maverick (afternoons). Prior to KCDU, Maverick worked at crosstown KDON-FM for two years. When the new KDON PD (Danny Ocean) came in, he fired Maverick. 10 minutes later, Mav was back on the air at CD93 doing afternoons and soon became the assistant program director. Jae Jae became famous for her \\"I'm outtie like a belly-button\\" sign-off phrase, and great stunts like the walk from Monterey to Santa Cruz for a Children's care center in Santa Cruz. Several programming changes also occurred in March 1999. The first was \\"10-in- a-row's\\" - where the station now played 10 songs each hour non-stop without commercials. The second was a new program called \\"Underground Planet\\", hosted by Sini Man. \\"UP\\" highlighted non-mainstream artists such as Rufus Wainwright, Fleming & John, and Vertical Horizon. The show aired 10-12 weeknights. Finally, the station dropped some of its most pop-leaning artists (including Ace of Base), and shifted back to a true Modern Adult Contemporary station. In December 1999, Sini Man retired from radio to pursue other interests including his singing career. In January 2000, the station adopted new sonic imaging with the \\"Modern Music\\" slogan. In May 2000, the station moved to NuWave's new radio facility in Monterey, and began using a new music library. \\"10-in-a- row's\\" were dropped at this point in favor of a 3-stopset music hour. All NuWave stations were sold to Mapleton Communications in Spring 2002. After being sold, the station immediately dropped the \\"Underground Planet\\" program. The playlist also shifted to a more Hot Adult Contemporary blend, which included current songs by LeAnn Rimes and Jennifer Love Hewitt. The 80's songs also changed to include more Bon Jovi and Def Leppard, and the \\"80's New-Wave\\" Saturday night show was subsequently dropped. =Rhythmic CHR era (2003-2004)= On February 28, 2003, KCDU switched callsigns to KBTU and flipped to Rhythmic CHR, branded as 93.5 The Bomb. On January 9, 2004. KBTU switched callsigns to KOTR. The callsign would only last 1.5 years =Language change and sale (2005-present)= In summer 2004, Mapleton Communications put KOTR up for sale. In spring 2005 after nearly 25 years as an English language station, it was announced that Lazer Broadcasting would be acquiring the station for an undisclosed amount. The sale was approved by the FCC on June 7. Upon the closure of the acquisition on July 25, the new owners flipped the station to Regional Mexican. Lazer also changed the callsign to its current KXSM. On April 8, 2012, KXSM moved down the spectrum to 93.1 FM after receiving regulatory approval.

The ship later served in the Royal Netherlands Navy (RNN) as HNLMS Boeroe. Design and construction In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose 'local defence vessel' capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate.Stevens, The Australian Corvettes, p. 1Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 103 The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103‚Äì4 The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar- class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti- submarine vessels.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103‚Äì5 Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 104 The need for locally built 'all-rounder' vessels at the start of World War II saw the \\"Australian Minesweepers\\" (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as \\"corvettes\\") approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 ordered by the RAN, 20 (including Toowoomba) ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 105, 148Donohue, From Empire Defence to the Long Haul, p. 29Stevens et al., The Royal Australian Navy, p. 108 Toowoomba was laid down by Walkers Limited at Maryborough, Queensland on 6 August 1940.

Operational history =RAN= Toowoomba entered operational service immediately on commissioning. She was initially based in Sydney, and was tasked with convoy escort duties along the east coast of Australia until January 1942, when Toowoomba and two sister ships were ordered to Batavia. Toowoomba was in constant action over the next two months, and on 14 February was one of the last ships to enter Singapore Harbour before it was captured by the Japanese. Retreating to Fremantle, Western Australia after the capture of Singapore, Toowoomba was repaired and recommenced convoy escort duties, this time on the west coast of Australia and with a new captain and crew, until assignment to the British Eastern Fleet on 23 November 1942. During this time, she was involved in escort and patrol duties across the Indian Ocean, reaching as far west as the Persian Gulf. On 22 November 1944, Toowoomba was assigned to the newly created British Pacific Fleet, and operated with the fleet until returning to Fremantle on 3 December 1944 for refit. The refit was completed in March 1945, and Toowoomba was assigned to escort and patrol duties between Australia and New Guinea until the end of hostilities. Following the end of World War II, Toowoomba spent time in Hong Kong, performing minesweeping and hydrological survey duties. She returned to Australia in December 1945. The corvette earned two battle honours for her wartime service, \\"Pacific 1942\\" and \\"Indian Ocean 1942‚Äì44\\". =RNLN= On 5 July 1946, Toowoomba decommissioned from RAN service and immediately commissioned into the Royal Netherlands Navy (RNLN). Renamed HNLMS Boeroe, she served with the RNLN until 1958.

This page deals with the other aspects of counter-terrorism: * the national authority over it * identification and monitoring of threats * clandestine and covert interference with the internal organization of those threats (and detection of/interference with their finances) * warning of planned attacks * mitigation of incidents (this may involve the organization that also deals with major accidents and natural disasters) Nations differ in how they implement their system of counter-intelligence and counter-terrorism organizations. This page summarizes several countries' models as examples. As a response to global terror, the United States Department of Defense has created and implemented various special operations forces in the Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps. These elite forces deployed to high risk areas in the East to conduct their missions. These missions included direct action against groups, counter intelligence, and reconsisence. The Air Force special forces are referred to combat controllers. The Army special operators are known as Rangers and are the army's version of Navy special operators, better known as the Navy Seals. Finally, the Marine Corps has instilled various special operations to the Corps: The Raiders, Recon, and Force Recon. These elite personal are in the top 1% of all active military. Each force endures their own specialized training course that they must pass in order to be awarded the operator title. Often, the war on terror goes unknown to the public. The public eye is not exposed to even half of what actually occurs in the war on terrorism and it is important for officials to remain discrete in their mission and covert actions. Role of counter-intelligence in national security Counterintelligence, and closely related counterterrorism, can be described as a source of positive intelligence on the opposition's priorities and thinking, not just a defensive measure. Still, foreign intelligence capability is an important part of early warning. Not all nations maintain offensive counterespionage and counterterrorism capability, and not all countries can have a worldwide presence. \\"Charles Burton Marshall wrote that his college studies failed to teach him about espionage, the role of intelligence services, or the role of propaganda. \\"States‚Äô propensities for leading double lives‚Äîhaving at once forensic and efficient policies, one sort for display, the other to be pursued‚Äîwere sloughed over.\\" This window into the \\"double lives\\" of states which Marshall wrote of is a less familiar dimension of CI work, one that national security decision-makers and scholars alike have largely neglected. inferred from Marshall's remark, \\"the positive intelligence that counter-intelligence may supply‚Äîthat is, how and to what ends governments use the precious resources that their intelligence services represent‚Äîcan help inform the underlying [national] foreign and defense policy debate, but only if our policy leadership is alert enough to appreciate the value of such insights.\\" She emphasizes that CI is directed not at all hostile actions against one's own countries, but those originated by foreign intelligence services (FIS), a term of art that includes transnational and non-national adversaries. Nations vary in how they organize defenses against FIS. Most of these defenses are composed of separate services with no common authority below the head of government. The civilian side may be split by foreign and domestic responsibilities, or by intelligence versus law enforcement responsibility. Australia Australia treats terrorism with a modified law enforcement model, with the domestic intelligence agency authorized to direct the police to make secret arrests and conduct interrogations. =Foreign intelligence on terrorist threats= Foreign intelligence is the responsibility of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS). Australia belongs to the Five Powers Defense Arrangement (FPDA) of Australia, Great Britain, New Zealand, Singapore and Malaysia, which appears to be concerned primarily with counter-terrorism. In addition, Australia is a member of the UKUSA agreement for sharing communications intelligence. They have over 350 intelligence services in more than 130 countries. =Internal security and police= The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) is the domestic security agency, which, following the British model, has no police powers. Due to this, it operates closely with the Australian Federal Police or with State and Territory police forces. The Australian anti-terrorism legislation, 2004 gave ASIO the authority to have police detain suspects without charge to enable their interrogation by ASIO officers, with severe penalties for those who reveal that questioning or detention has taken place. This change generated controversy over the balance between security and civil liberties, as it does in many countries. Belgium The Prime Minister has direct responsibility for counter-terrorism, with the Council of Ministers setting strategic policy. A Ministerial Committee on Intelligence and Security works out detailed policies. Belgium, with due regard to domestic concern about sovereignty, takes a leadership role in European cooperation on terrorism. Principally, counter terrorism is seen as a police responsibility, coordinated principally by the Ministry of the Interior, with some work in the Ministry of Justice. Either the police or a federal magistrate do investigations. =Foreign intelligence on terrorist threats= The Ministry of Justice controls the civilian intelligence agency, the State Security and General Intelligence Service, which may call on the military intelligence service under specific and limited circumstances. =Measures to interfere with terrorist organizations= Two organizations are responsible for investigating and preventing the financing of terrorism. The Financial Information Processing Unit, an independent agency supervised by the Finance and Justice Ministries, collects and analyzes financial data about possible terrorist linkages. The Treasury, part of the Federal Public Finance Department, is responsible for freezing assets belonging to terrorists. In addition, Belgium is a member of the international Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering, a 31-country organization formed by the G-7 in 1989 to combat money laundering. =Internal security and police= Anti-terrorism and homeland security intelligence is handled by the civilian intelligence agency ‚Äî the State Security and General Intelligence Service under the Ministry of Justice. Four agencies have some anti-terrorism role: :*the Department of Terrorism and Sects of the Federal Police, responsible mainly for coordinating activities relating to the Turkish Kurd issue, terrorism, and religious sects; :*the mixed anti-terrorist group, a small group, supervised by the Justice and Interior Ministries, that collects and analyzes information for the development of policy and legislation (this group has since been replaced by the OCAM/CODA); :*State Security, which handles intelligence and security matters in several areas, including terrorism, proliferation, and organized crime; :*the Terrorism and Public Order Service of the Federal Police, a deliberately low-profile group of about 40 field staff with wide-ranging responsibilities. =Warning and coordination= A new organization, OCAM/CODA (Organe de coordination pour l‚Äôanalyse de la menace/Co√∂rdinatieorgaan voor de dreigingsanalyse), does terrorist threat analysis and coordinates intelligence and police activity. =Criminal justice for terrorists= Individual components of homeland security, counter-terrorism, and emergency management responsibilities are spread throughout the government; different agencies look at various issues; for example, one group handles threat assessment, while another one is responsible for intelligence gathering, and border control and financial questions are handled by two other ministries. =Incident mitigation= Monitoring and response to major disasters and terrorist incidents is under Governmental Coordination and Crisis Center, part of the Interior Ministry, It is one of five divisions of the Interior Ministry along with the General Directorate of Civil Defense. Brazil Ag√™ncia Brasileira de Intelig√™ncia (Abin) Canada =Foreign intelligence on terrorist threats= Canada does not maintain a foreign HUMINT function, but has a strong analytic capability in the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), which is also responsible for personnel security clearances. The military is served by the Intelligence Branch (Canadian Forces). Communications Security Establishment does collect SIGINT, and is Canada's only acknowledged foreign intelligence collection agency beyond the tactical intelligence units of the military. =Internal security and police= The Royal Canadian Mounted Police was once the principal counter-intelligence agency, but most functions transferred to CSIS. =Incident mitigation= Public Safety Canada (PSC) is Canada's national emergency management agency, with a counterpart in each province. France France, for example, builds its domestic counterterrorism in a law enforcement framework. =Foreign intelligence on terrorist threats= In France, a senior anti-terrorism magistrate is in charge of defense against terrorism. French magistrates have multiple functions that overlap US and UK functions of investigators, prosecutors, and judges. An anti-terrorism magistrate may call upon France's domestic intelligence service Direction de la surveillance du territoire (DST), which may work with the Direction g√©n√©rale de la s√©curit√© ext√©rieure (DGSE), foreign intelligence service. Germany German authorities rely on intelligence, law enforcement, and judicial prosecution to prevent terrorist acts and to identify and neutralize potential terrorists. =Foreign intelligence on terrorist threats= Federal Intelligence Service (BND) under the Federal Chancellory and Milit√§rischer Abschirmdienst (MAD) is responsible for strategic-level preparation of military forces against all threats for which they are responsible. =Measures to interfere with terrorist organizations= Within the BKA (Federal Criminal Police Office), a Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) serves as Germany's central office for tracking money laundering as well as a main contact point with foreign authorities concerning financial crime. In the financial area, new measures against money laundering were announced in October 2001. A new office within the Ministry of the Interior was charged with collecting and analyzing information contained in financial disclosures. Procedures were set up to better enforce asset seizure and forfeiture laws. German authorities were given wider latitude in accessing financial data of terrorist groups. Steps were taken to curb international money laundering and improve bank customer screening procedures. The Federal Criminal Police Office set up an independent unit responsible for the surveillance of suspicious financial flows. Measures to prevent money laundering now include the checking of electronic databases to ensure that banks are properly screening their clients‚Äô business relationships and that they are meeting the requirement to set up internal monitoring systems. In seeking to dry up the sources of terrorist financing, recent regulations aim to strengthen Germany's own capabilities, as well as German cooperation with international efforts. Under the oversight of the German Federal Banking Supervisory Office, banks, financial service providers and others must monitor all financial flows for illegal activity. Germany was the first country to implement an EU guideline against money laundering as well as the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF). =Internal security and police= The Federal Bureau for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) is given authority to track any activities of extremist groups that seek to foment ideological or religious strife domestically. The Federal Police, also on airliners The most important law enforcement authorities are the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) and the German Federal Police, both under the Ministry of the Interior, and the Federal Public Prosecutor General (GBA). Post- 9/11, the BKA has the authority to lead its own investigations, replacing the former system which required a formal request from the BfV. =Criminal justice for Terrorists= The Federal Public Prosecutor General at the Federal Court of Justice is charged with prosecution of terrorist offenses. A Criminal Senate within the Federal Court of Justice deals with national security measures and is responsible for ruling on complaints of investigative abuse, under the Courts Constitution Act. Italy The Italian Council of Ministers (or cabinet), headed by the President of the Council (the Prime Minister) is the supreme, collective decision-making body in the Italian government. Protecting domestic security and combating terrorism involves a coordinated effort by the main governmental ministries. Within the Prime Minister's office exists a Political-Military Unit that reports directly to the Prime Minister. The members of the Unit are the senior representatives of all government departments and agencies responsible for combating terrorism and protecting the population throughout Italy. Italian officials assert that the Political-Military Unit's role, powers, and responsibilities have been strengthened further post‚ÄìSeptember 11. Among other measures since then, the Unit has: updated the national emergency plan to deal with any chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) incidents, coordinated action plans and operations relating to transport safety and bio-terrorism; and sought to enhance both civil and military preemptive measures against terrorism. =Foreign intelligence on terrorist threats= Intelligence and security policy are under the Inter-ministerial Committee for Intelligence and Security (CIIS) provides advice and makes proposals to the Prime Minister on the general direction and fundamental objectives for intelligence and security policy. The CIIS is chaired by the Prime Minister; other statutory members are the ministers for the Interior, Defense, Foreign Affairs, Justice, and Economy and Finance; the heads of the intelligence services and other ministers or government officials may be invited to participate as required. =Measures to interfere with terrorist organizations= The Economics and Finance Ministry has the lead on stemming terrorist financing and customs policy. =Internal security and police= The Ministry of the Interior is the lead government ministry on counterterrorism policy, public order and security, immigration and border controls, and civil protection. Within the Interior Ministry, the Public Security Department directs and manages the national police force and is responsible for implementing the public order and security policy; the Civil Liberty and Immigration Department sets immigration and asylum policy; and the Fire Brigade, Public Aid, and Civil Defense Department has the lead on setting emergency preparedness and response policy, including for terrorist incidents. Several other government ministries may also play a role in different aspects of combating terrorism and homeland security affairs; these include the Defense Ministry, the Health Ministry, and the Infrastructure and Transport Ministry. Chaired by the Interior Minister, The Public Order and Security Committee examines every issue relative to the protection of public order and security and to the organization of the police forces. Other key members are the Chief of Police/Director General of Public Security (who heads the Interior Ministry's Public Security Department), and a Council of Ministers‚Äô undersecretary with special responsibility for the intelligence services (this undersecretary is designated by the Prime Minister). The heads of Italy's other police forces also take part in the Public Order and Security Committee, and additional ministers may be involved depending on the particular issue to be discussed. The Interior Ministry has ministerial responsibility for Italy's Polizia di Stato (State Police), or national police force. At the central government level, the Interior Ministry's Public Security Department coordinates the tasks and activities of the Polizia di Stato. At the provincial level, the top public security authorities are the prefect, who is appointed by and answerable to the central government, and the questore, or the senior provincial official of the Polizia di Stato. Each questore has operational control of the provincial police headquarters, which has jurisdiction in the field of public order, security, and criminal and intelligence matters. There are also Polizia di Stato officials at the local level in charge of detached police stations. Other relevant specialist police units are the traffic police, which patrol Italy's roads and highways; the railway police, which ensure the security of travelers and their belongings on Italy's railway system, the security of railway stations, and control of dangerous goods transported by rail; the immigration and border police, which are responsible for the entry and stay of foreign nationals and immigrants in Italy, as well as the prevention and control of illegal immigrants; and the postal and communications police, which seek to prevent and tackle the illegal use of communication technologies (for example, computer hackers and computer viruses). The police air service and the nautical squads perform services ranging from mountain or sea rescues to contributing to the fight against illegal immigration by patrolling the national coasts and other points of entry. =Warning and coordination= The Polizia di Stato includes various specialist units that may play a role in combating terrorism and protecting different aspects of Italian homeland security. The anti-terrorism police, at both the central and provincial level, have primary responsibility for investigations aimed at preventing and fighting terrorism, including the collection and analysis of information related to terrorist offenses. =Incident mitigation= There is also an Inter-ministerial Committee for Civil Defense. Also within the Prime Minister's office is the Department of Civil Protection, which is responsible at the national level for prevention, preparedness, and coordination of responses to both natural and man-made disasters. This Department coordinates Italy's \\"National Service\\" for civil protection, which consists of central, regional, provincial, and local (or municipal) state administrations, public agencies, and voluntary organizations. This national service system operates on the principle of subsidiarity. In the event of an emergency, primary responsibility for managing the response falls on the local mayor. If the resources at the disposal of the mayor are insufficient, support may be drawn from provincial, regional, or national assets. Military assets can also be used to assist with a large-scale emergency, including those with a CBRN dimension. Any military forces deployed, however, would be under the command of the civil authorities. Italy also has a military corps, or Carabinieri, that carries out police duties among its civilian population. The Italian Carabinieri is similar to France's Gendarmerie, or Spain's Guardia Civil. The Carabinieri has an elite counterterrorism unit with the authority to combat domestic and international terrorism; it is empowered to gather intelligence, investigate terrorist organizations, and respond to high-risk situations or instances in which military installations are under threat. Institutionally, the Carabinieri are responsible primarily to the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Interior, although various specialist departments may also report to different government ministries, such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on issues such as the protection of Italian diplomatic institutions abroad. Italy has two main intelligence and security services engaged in the fight against terrorism. The Military Intelligence and Security Service (SISMI) reports directly to the Minister of Defense and fulfills all intelligence and security tasks for the defense of the state's independence and integrity against any danger on the military front; it has both counterespionage and counter- intelligence duties. The Democratic Intelligence and Security Service (SISDE) reports directly to the Minister of the Interior and has responsibility for intelligence and security tasks related to the defense of the democratic state and its institutions against all forms of subversion. The division of responsibilities between SISMI and SISDE is based on the interests to be protected (military and democratic security), rather than on a territorial basis (domestic and international security). The directors of SISMI and SISDE have operational control over their respective services. The main instrument for coordinating the work of the two services and for advising the Prime Minister and other government officials on intelligence priorities is the Executive Committee for the Intelligence and Security Services (CESIS). CESIS is strategic in nature; it analyzes the intelligence provided by the services as well as the police and presents coordinated assessments to the government. Some have likened CESIS to the U.S. National Intelligence Council, or the UK's Joint Intelligence Committee. Italy has also created a Committee for Strategic Anti-Terrorism Analysis (CASA) within the Interior Ministry to collate and evaluate intelligence about potential threats and provide early warning. CASA is composed of representatives of all law enforcement bodies and the secret services, and seeks to break down institutional barriers among these bodies; it appears to be similar to the U.S. National Counter Terrorism Center or the UK's Joint Intelligence Analysis Center India =Foreign intelligence on terrorist threats= The lead anti-terrorism organization is the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), which reports to the Prime Minister. =Internal security and police= Domestically, the Intelligence Bureau is the domestic intelligence service. India's lead police agency is the (National investigation agency). As opposed to the British Security Service and US FBI, its jurisdiction is much more restricted, with state police agencies often taking the lead. Israel =Foreign intelligence on terrorist threats= External and offensive counter-intelligence, counter-terrorism, and some direct action is the general responsibility of Mossad, although military units will carry out specific counterterrorism actions. There are some standing military special operations forces, such as Sayeret Matkal, but ad hoc task forces were assembled for major operations such as the 1976 Entebbe rescue. Mossad, on foreign intelligence, also works with Aman, the military intelligence service. =Internal security and police= Shabak is the Israeli domestic counterintelligence organization. It works with police organizations, especially the Israel Border Police (Hebrew: ◊û◊©◊û◊® ◊î◊í◊ë◊ï◊ú, Mishmar HaGvul) is the combat branch of the Israeli Police, known by its Hebrew abbreviation Magav. Shabak also works with the Yamam special police unit, =Incident mitigation= The Home Front Command provides emergency services for major disasters and terrorist attacks. Pakistan Inter- Services Intelligence Portugal Servi√ßo de Informa√ß√µes e Seguran√ßa (SIS) =Foreign Intelligence on Terrorist Threats= Servi√ßo de Informa√ß√µes Estrat√©gicas de Defesa (SIED, Defense and Strategic Informations Service) is responsible for foreign intelligence in Portugal. =Internal Security and Police= Servi√ßo de Informa√ß√µes de Seguran√ßa (SIS, Security Intelligence Service) is responsible for internal security intelligence in Portugal. Romania Serviciul Rom√¢n de Informa≈£ii (SRI) Russia and former USSR Unlike many other nations, Russia and the former USSR has not made a clear split between foreign and domestic intelligence. =Foreign intelligence on terrorist threats= The current intelligence service is the Federal Security Service (FSB). Under the Soviet Union, the Committee for State Security (KGB) was the main security agency. =Internal security and police= There are some anti-terrorism capabilities under the Ministry of the Interior. =Incident mitigation= Ministry of Emergency Situations (EMERCOM) does emergency management for natural and human-made disasters. South Africa National Intelligence Agency (NIA) - South Africa Counter Intelligence Agency (CIA) - South Africa The Counter Intelligence Agency (CIA) of South Africa was established in 2010 to develop Industrial fraud prevention and counter intelligence measures in Africa. Presently there is an industrial legislation bill one the way to prevent industrial espionage in South Africa. The organizations main collaboration is with Governments, industrial organization and law enforcement. The organization is non-accessible to public. Spain Spain gives its Interior Ministry, with military support, the leadership in domestic counterterrorism. The military has organic counter-intelligence to meet specific military needs. =Foreign intelligence on terrorist threats= For international threats, the National Intelligence Center (CNI) has responsibility. CNI, which reports directly to the Prime Minister, is staffed principally by which is subordinated directly to the Prime Minister's office. =Domestinc intelligence, Warning and coordination= After the March 11, 2004 Madrid train bombings, the national investigation found problems between the Interior Ministry and CNI, and as a result, the National Anti-Terrorism Coordination Center was created. Spain's 3/11 Commission called for this Center to do operational coordination as well as information collection and dissemination. This Center was later integrated in a new agency created on 2014 and called Intelligence Center for Counter-Terrorism and Organized Crime (CITCO). Sweden The Swedish Security Service (S√§po) is the domestic intelligence and counterterrorism organization, under the Swedish National Police Board. United Kingdom The UK Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister, is the top decision-making body of the UK government. The Cabinet Office supports the UK ministerial committee system by coordinating policy and strategy across government departments, and as such, has a role in bringing together department ministers, officials, and others involved in homeland security affairs and counterterrorism. The Cabinet Secretariat, which sits in the Cabinet Office, largely manages the day-to-day business of the Cabinet committees and is divided into six individual secretariats that support the different Cabinet committees. A Security and Intelligence Coordinator within the Cabinet Office is directly responsible to the Prime Minister and is tasked with coordinating and developing, across all government departments, work on counterterrorism and crisis management. The Security and Intelligence Coordinator plays a key role in setting priorities and budgets for the intelligence services. In April 2004, the British government unveiled a new comprehensive, cross-departmental Counterterrorism Strategy (known as CONTEST) centered on the \\"4Ps\\" of prevent, pursue, protect, and prepare. Prevention work seeks to address the underlying causes of terrorism both at home and abroad; pursuit efforts aim to disrupt terrorist organizations and their ability to operate; protection measures focus on protecting the public, critical national infrastructure, and key sites at particular risk; preparedness work aims to enable the UK to respond and recover from the consequences of a terrorist attack. The \\"4Ps\\" seek to give greater coherence to UK counterterrorism measures and take advantage of existing expertise and resources throughout the UK government. =Foreign intelligence on terrorist threats= The UK has three main intelligence and security services engaged in the fight against terrorism. The Secret Intelligence Service (SIS, or MI6), the UK's foreign intelligence service, gathers intelligence overseas. The Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) provides signals intelligence to counter a range of threats, including terrorism, and is also the national technical authority for information assurance, helping to keep data residing on government communication and information systems safe from theft, manipulation, and other threats. Both MI6 and GCHQ operate under the statutory authority of the Foreign Secretary, although neither is part of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC), part of the Cabinet Office, advises on intelligence priorities. Like the US National Intelligence Council, the JIC, is intended to improve intelligence-sharing and cooperation against terrorism further among the UK's different law enforcement and intelligence agencies. =Measures to interfere with terrorist organizations= HM Revenue and Customs, a nonministerial department that reports to the Chancellor of the Exchequer (or Treasury Secretary), has the lead responsibility for detecting prohibited and restricted goods at import and export, including those goods that may be used by terrorists. Customs officers also have the power to seize terrorist-linked cash anywhere in the UK, although the Treasury ministry has the lead in the fight against terrorist financing. The Department for Transport's Transport Security and Contingencies Directorate is responsible for the security of the traveling public and transport facilities through regulation of the aviation, maritime, and railway industries. =Internal security and police= The Home Office, which would be called the Interior Ministry in many European countries, is the government department that has the lead on several aspects of homeland security affairs, including counterterrorism policy within the UK. The Security Service (MI5) is responsible for the protection of national security against threats from espionage, sabotage, and terrorism. MI5 operates under the statutory authority of the Home Secretary, although it is not part of the Home Office. It is the focal point for the response to the terrorist threat, both through promulgation of legislative measures and counter-terrorist contingency planning. It is also responsible for domestic security policies, planning for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) incidents, and the national counterterrorism exercise program. The Home Office also has the lead on setting immigration and asylum policy, and ministerial responsibility for the UK immigration service, which controls entry and exit to the UK at air, sea, land, and rail ports and identifies, monitors, and removes immigration offenders. The Home Secretary is a member of the full Defense and Overseas Policy ministerial committee, deputy chair of the DOP's international terrorism subcommittee, and chair of the DOP's protective security and resilience subcommittee. The Home Secretary also chairs the Civil Contingencies Committee and sits on the Intelligence Services ministerial committee. Policing in the UK is largely decentralized. The Home Office has ministerial responsibility for the police services in England and Wales. The Scottish Ministry of Justice has ministerial responsibility for policing in Scotland, while the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland sets policy for policing there. Operational control, however, of all of the police services in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland rests with the chief constable of each force. Currently, there are 43 regional police forces in England and Wales, and 1 in Scotland; the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) is responsible for policing in Northern Ireland. In England, Wales, and Scotland, these regional police forces have primary responsibility for the investigation of terrorist offenses; the PSNI has lead responsibility for terrorist investigations related to the affairs of Northern Ireland. Each police force also has its own Special Branch, which works in partnership with the Security Service (MI5), the UK's domestic security service, to acquire intelligence on those who may be involved in terrorism. The Metropolitan Police (Scotland Yard) has responsibility for London and also has various specialist units, such as those that deal with anti-terrorism, that may be called upon to fulfill a national role. In addition to the regional forces, there are a few other British police forces that may play a role in homeland security affairs. The British Transport Police (BTP) police the railway systems of England, Wales, and Scotland; the BTP is also responsible for policing some metro and commuter systems, including the London Underground. The Department of Transport has ministerial responsibility over the BTP. The Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC) is an armed police force that protects civil nuclear installations and nuclear materials in the UK; it operates under the strategic direction of the Department of Trade and Industry. Although the police and security services have the primary role in domestic protection against terrorism, the armed forces may be called upon domestically in the event of a major terrorist incident requiring military units with specialized skills (such as the Special Forces hostage rescue commandos or those trained to deal with CBRN events). There is a formal turnover of authority from a police organization to the military for a rescue operation, such as the Special Air Service intervention in the Iranian Embassy Siege in 1980. =Warning and coordination= In the event of an actual terrorist incident, a Cabinet-level emergency crisis management body ‚Äî known as Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms (COBR) convenes to coordinate the government's immediate emergency response; COBR brings together the Prime Minister and other Cabinet ministers and officials. The Joint Intelligence Analysis Center (JTAC) collates and evaluates intelligence about potential threats and provide early warning. JTAC seeks to break down institutional barriers between analysts of the different security and intelligence agencies by drawing together about 100 officials from 11 government departments and agencies, including MI5, MI6, GCHQ, the police, and the defence and transport ministries. JTAC provides both long-term studies of international terrorism and immediate assessments of current threats; it is analogous to the U.S. National Counter Terrorism Center. JTAC is responsible to the director-general of MI5. =Incident mitigation= The Civil Contingencies Committee (CCC) is heavily involved in longer-term emergency preparedness and response, and has a Civil Contingencies Secretariat (CCS) within the Cabinet Secretariat to support the CCC, review UK emergency planning arrangements, and improve UK preparedness for and response to emergencies. The Health Protection Agency (HPA), a non-departmental body accountable to the Health Secretary, was established in 2003 to help provide a coordinated and consistent public health response to a range of national emergencies, from a disease outbreak to a terrorist attack. The UK armed forces may also be deployed to assist in the management of a natural disaster. The decision to deploy the military to assist the civil authorities in an emergency would be made by COBR, and the armed forces would have no jurisdiction outside of supporting the civil powers. The Ministry of Defence and the armed forces are also responsible for protecting 160 key UK sites, and for guarding UK nuclear weapons. United States Few nations have as complex a structure as the United States, and the structure is reorganized frequently. In the US, there is a very careful line drawn between intelligence and law enforcement. Several supervisory and coordinating organizations report to the President, principally the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) and Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive (NCIX). Before WWII the United States had no state intelligence service, and therefore lagged behind other world powers. During WWII President Roosevelt started the OSS or Office of Strategic Services to serve as a wartime intelligence agency. The OSS focused on foreign intelligence during the war. In 1946 the CIA was formed after the OSS was disbanded by President Truman. =Foreign intelligence on terrorist threats= The large and complex intelligence community all gather information. Agencies variously have capabilities for collection, analysis, or both. Information is sent to the National Counterterrorism Center, which reports to the DNI. Certain counter-intelligence agencies to protect military forces are largely classified functions called Counterintelligence Force Protection Source Operations (CFSO). These report to military chains of command for direct support, but coordinate offensive activities through the NCS. Each major military service has a counter-intelligence function: United States Army Counterintelligence, the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI),and the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), formerly (NIS). NCIS serves the US Marine Corps. NOTE: The U.S. Marine Corps also has Counterintelligence/Tactical HUMINT assets (CI/HUMINT). The Defense Intelligence Agency is responsible for Defense-wide counterintelligence, a capability and mission it subsumed when the Counterintelligence Field Activity (CIFA) was integrated within it. =Internal security and police= Domestic counter-intelligence is principally under Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which serves a dual role as both the United States' premier law enforcement agency and an intelligence agency. The FBI and CIA jointly operate the National Counter terrorism Center, although the CIA is not allowed to do field operations within the US. The lead agency for terrorism and counterintelligence law enforcement is the FBI, although a number of units of the Department of Homeland Security may provide support After the Oklahoma City bombing of 19 April 1995, by Timothy McVeigh, an American, the CI definition reasonably extends to include domestically-originated terrorism. There is also the challenge of what organizations, laws, and doctrines are relevant to protection against all sorts of terrorism in one's own country. See Counter-intelligence Force Protection Source Operations for a discussion of special considerations of protection of government personnel and facilities, both in the US and internationally. Immigration services, which had been under the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), were transferred from the Department of Justice to the Department of Homeland Security in March 2003. The administration of immigration services, including permanent residence, naturalization, asylum, and other functions became the responsibility of the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services (BCIS), which existed only for a short time before changing to its current name, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The investigative and enforcement functions (including investigations, deportation, and intelligence) were combined with U.S. Customs investigators, the Federal Protective Service, and the Federal Air Marshal Service, to create U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The border functions of the INS, which included the Border Patrol along with INS Inspectors, were combined with U.S. Customs Inspectors into the newly created U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). =Warning and coordination= The National Counterterrorism Center, reporting to the Director of National Intelligence receives information from intelligence agencies and law enforcement, does threat analysis, and disseminates as appropriate. According to a 2001 report, the State Department keeps a record of nations with state sponsored terrorist efforts that is referred to as the \\"terrorist list\\": \\"Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria\\". This list has been created based on the findings detailed in Patterns of Global Terrorism. =Criminal Justice System as a Counterterrorism Tool= In the United States, the criminal justice system has been considered a \\"the source of extremely valuable intelligence on al-Qaeda and other terrorist organizations.\\" Some examples of this are the apprehensions of terrorists such as L'Houssaine Kherchtou and Mohammed Junaid Babar. There is some debate within the criminal justice system and more generally about whether or not domestic terrorism should be considered acts of war or domestic crimes, which is outlined in writing by Andrew Majoran. =Measures to interfere with terrorist organizations= Offensive counterespionage, which also includes offensive (but not combat) activity against terrorists, appears to have remained in the Central Intelligence Agency's National Clandestine Service (NCS), which used to be the CIA Directorate of Operations. In an attempt to strengthen the power of US intelligence the Counterterrorism Act of 2000 \\"[ensured]‚Ä¶ easier recruitment of CIA counter-terrorist informants.\\" The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), in the Department of the Treasury, is the clearinghouse for banks and other institutions' reporting of suspected money laundering, terrorist financing, etc. In general, if there is a matter to be prosecuted, the FBI will take the case. =Incident mitigation= DHS contains a number of organizations for mitigation, which work with state and local organizations. All use the Incident Command System operations paradigm, which scales from local level to the National Incident Management System/National Response Plan. DHS organizations involved in mitigation include the Federal Emergency Management Agency, National Communications System and US Coast Guard. National Guard units, variously federalized, used by agreement between states, or in their own states, are a major resource, especially for large disasters.

They are also often depicted as individuals highly unsuited for espionage. At times, the absurdities take on a comic dimension - such as in the arrest of Henry Obed, an Indian working for Abwehr. It is notable that the German plans for Operation Green (the intended invasion of Ireland) also included a considerable amount of outdated information. Whilst dramatised (and some names have been changed, notably that of Sch√ºtz to \\"Schultz\\") the plots in Caught in a Free State are based on actual events and persons. The anachronistic reference to \\"Free State\\" is deliberate as the Irish Free State had been superseded by the new Constitution of Ireland of 1937, which is a recurring theme.

DEVS is a timed event system. History DEVS abbreviating Discrete Event System Specification is a modular and hierarchical formalism for modeling and analyzing general systems that can be discrete event systems which might be described by state transition tables, and continuous state systems which might be described by differential equations, and hybrid ... DEVS is a formalism for modeling and analysis of discrete event systems (DESs). The DEVS formalism was invented by Bernard P. Zeigler, who is emeritus professor at the University of Arizona. DEVS was introduced to the public in Zeigler's first book, Theory of Modeling and Simulation, in 1976, while Zeigler was an associate professor at University of Michigan. DEVS can be seen as an extension of the Moore machine formalism,automata were the mathematical models of Dr. Zeigler's Ph.D. thesis [Zeigler68] which is a finite state automaton where the outputs are determined by the current state alone (and do not depend directly on the input). The extension was done by # associating a lifespan with each state [Zeigler76], # providing a hierarchical concept with an operation, called coupling [Zeigler84]. Since the lifespan of each state is a real number (more precisely, non-negative real) or infinity, it is distinguished from discrete time systems, sequential machines, and Moore machines, in which time is determined by a tick time multiplied by non-negative integers. Moreover, the lifespan can be a random variable; for example the lifespan of a given state can be distributed exponentially or uniformly. The state transition and output functions of DEVS can also be stochastic. Zeigler proposed a hierarchical algorithm for DEVS model simulation in 1984 [Zeigler84] which was published in Simulation journal in 1987. Since then, many extended formalism from DEVS have been introduced with their own purposes: DESS/DEVS for combined continuous and discrete event systems, P-DEVS for parallel DESs, G-DEVS for piecewise continuous state trajectory modeling of DESs, RT-DEVS for realtime DESs, Cell- DEVS for cellular DESs, Fuzzy-DEVS for fuzzy DESs, Dynamic Structuring DEVS for DESs changing their coupling structures dynamically, and so on. In addition to its extensions, there are some subclasses such as SP-DEVS and FD- DEVS have been researched for achieving decidability of system properties. Due to the modular and hierarchical modeling views, as well as its simulation- based analysis capability, the DEVS formalism and its variations have been used in many application of engineering (such as hardware design, hardware/software codesign, communications systems, manufacturing systems) and science (such as biology, and sociology) Formalism Fig. 1. A DEVS Model for Ping-Pong Game ; Intuitive Example DEVS defines system behavior as well as system structure. System behavior in DEVS formalism is described using input and output events as well as states. For example, for the ping-pong player of Fig. 1, the input event is ?receive, and the output event is !send. Each player, A, B, has its states: Send and Wait. Send state takes 0.1 seconds to send back the ball that is the output event !send, while the Wait state lasts until the player receives the ball that is the input event ?receive. The structure of ping-pong game is to connect two players: Player A 's output event !send is transmitted to Player B 's input event ?receive, and vice versa. In the classic DEVS formalism, Atomic DEVS captures the system behavior, while Coupled DEVS describes the structure of system. The following formal definition is for Classic DEVS [ZKP00]. In this article, we will use the time base, \\\\mathbb{T}=[0,\\\\infty) that is the set of non-negative real numbers; the extended time base, \\\\mathbb{T}^\\\\infty=[0,\\\\infty] that is the set of non-negative real numbers plus infinity. =Atomic DEVS= An atomic DEVS model is defined as a 7-tuple M= where > *X is the set of input events; *Y is the set of output events; *S is the set > of sequential states (or also called the set of partial states); *s_0\\\\in S > is the initial state; *ta:S \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{T}^\\\\infty is the time > advance function which is used to determine the lifespan of a state; > *\\\\delta_{ext}:Q \\\\times X \\\\rightarrow S is the external transition function > which defines how an input event changes a state of the system, where > Q=\\\\\\\\{(s,t_e)s \\\\in S, t_e \\\\in (\\\\mathbb{T} \\\\cap [0, ta(s)])\\\\\\\\} is the set of > total states, and t_e is the elapsed time since the last event; We can also > define the external transition function as \\\\delta_{ext}:Q \\\\times X > \\\\rightarrow S \\\\times \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\} where Q = S \\\\times \\\\mathbb{T}^\\\\infty \\\\times > \\\\mathbb{T} such that for a total state (s, t_s, t_e) \\\\in Q, s \\\\in S is a > partial state, t_s \\\\in \\\\mathbb{T}^\\\\infty is the lifespan of s, and t_e \\\\in > (\\\\mathbb{T} \\\\cap [0,t_s]) is the elapsed time since last update of t_s.

Behavior of Atomic DEVS  Simply speaking, there are two cases that an atomic DEVS model M can change its state s \\\\in S: (1) when an external input x \\\\in X comes into the system M ; (2) when the elapsed time t_e reaches the lifespan of s which is defined by ta(s) . (At the same time of (2), M generates an output y \\\\in Y which is defined by \\\\lambda(s) .) . For formal behavior description of given an Atomic DEVS model, refer to the page Behavior of DEVS. Computer algorithms to implement the behavior of a given Atomic DEVS model are available at Simulation Algorithms for Atomic DEVS. = Coupled DEVS = The coupled DEVS defines which sub-components belong to it and how they are connected with each other. A coupled DEVS model is defined as an 8-tuple N= where > *X is the set of input events; *Y is the set of output events; *D is the > name set of sub-components; *\\\\\\\\{M_i\\\\\\\\} is the set of sub-components where > for each i \\\\in D, M_i can be either an atomic DEVS model or a coupled DEVS > model. *C_{xx}\\\\subseteq X \\\\times \\\\bigcup_{i \\\\in D} X_i is the set of > external input couplings; *C_{yx}\\\\subseteq \\\\bigcup_{i \\\\in D} Y_i \\\\times > \\\\bigcup_{i \\\\in D} X_i is the set of internal couplings; *C_{yy}: \\\\bigcup_{i > \\\\in D} Y_i \\\\rightarrow Y^\\\\phi is the external output coupling function; > *Select:2^D \\\\rightarrow D is the tie-breaking function which defines how to > select the event from the set of simultaneous events; ; The coupled DEVS model for Ping-Pong Game The ping-pong game of Fig. 1 can be modeled as a coupled DEVS model N= where X=\\\\\\\\{\\\\\\\\} ;Y=\\\\\\\\{\\\\\\\\} ;D=\\\\\\\\{A,B\\\\\\\\} ; M_A \\\\text{ and } M_B is described as above; C_{xx}=\\\\\\\\{\\\\\\\\}; C_{yx}=\\\\\\\\{(A.!send, B.?receive), (B.!send, A.?receive)\\\\\\\\}; and C_{yy}(A.!send)=\\\\phi, C_{yy}(B.!send)=\\\\phi.  Behavior of Coupled DEVS  Simply speaking, like the behavior of the atomic DEVS class, a coupled DEVS model N changes its components' states (1) when an external event x \\\\in X comes into N ; (2) when one of components M_i where i \\\\in D executes its internal state transition and generates its output y_i \\\\in Y_i. In both cases (1) and (2), a triggering event is transmitted to all influencees which are defined by coupling sets C_{xx}, C_{yx}, and C_{yy} . For formal definition of behavior of the coupled DEVS, you can refer to Behavior of Coupled DEVS. Computer algorithms to implement the behavior of a given coupled DEVS mode are available at Simulation Algorithms for Coupled DEVS. Analysis Methods = Simulation for Discrete Event Systems = The simulation algorithm of DEVS models considers two issues: time synchronization and message propagation. Time synchronization of DEVS is to control all models to have the identical current time. However, for an efficient execution, the algorithm makes the current time jump to the most urgent time when an event is scheduled to execute its internal state transition as well as its output generation. Message propagation is to transmit a triggering message which can be either an input or output event along the associated couplings which are defined in a coupled DEVS model. For more detailed information, the reader can refer to Simulation Algorithms for Atomic DEVS and Simulation Algorithms for Coupled DEVS. =Simulation for Continuous State Systems= By introducing a quantization method which abstracts a continuous segment as a piecewise const segment, DEVS can simulate behaviors of continuous state systems which are described by networks of differential algebraic equations. This research has been initiated by Zeigler in 1990sthe use of quantized values in order to simulate continuous systems by means of a discrete event method was empirically tried out a few years sooner - in the early 1990s - by a French engineer . He was then working for a company spun off from University of Valenciennes, and now part of the Schneider Electric. This quantization is a feature of a simulation software of which this engineer is the conceptor and main developer, that is used for PLC programs checking and operator training. and many properties have been clarified by Prof. Kofman in 2000s and Dr. Nutaro. In 2006, Prof. Cellier who is the author of Continuous System Modeling[Cellier91], and Prof. Kofman wrote a text book, Continuous System Simulation[CK06] in which Chapters 11 and 12 cover how DEVS simulates continuous state systems. Dr. Nutaro's book [Nutaro10], covers the discrete event simulation of continuous state systems too. = Verification for Discrete Event Systems = As an alternative analysis method against the sampling-based simulation method, an exhaustive generating behavior approach, generally called verification has been applied for analysis of DEVS models. It is proven that infinite states of a given DEVS model (especially a coupled DEVS model ) can be abstracted by behaviorally isomorphic finite structure, called a reachability graph when the given DEVS model is a sub-class of DEVS such as Schedule-Preserving DEVS (SP-DEVS), Finite & Deterministic DEVS (FD- DEVS) [HZ09], and Finite & Real-time DEVS (FRT-DEVS) [Hwang12]. As a result, based on the rechability graph, (1) dead-lock and live-lock freeness as qualitative properties are decidable with SP-DEVS [Hwang05], FD-DEVS [HZ06], and FRT-DEVS [Hwang12]; and (2) min/max processing time bounds as a quantitative property are decidable with SP-DEVS so far by 2012. Variations of DEVS =Extensions (Superclassing)= Numerous extensions of the classic DEVS formalism have been developed in the last decades. Among them formalisms which allow to have changing model structures while the simulation time evolves. G-DEVS [Giambiasi01][Zacharewicz08], Parallel DEVS, Dynamic Structuring DEVS, Cell-DEVS [Wainer09], dynDEVS, Fuzzy-DEVS, GK-DEVS, ml-DEVS, Symbolic DEVS, Real-Time DEVS, rho-DEVS =Restrictions (Subclassing)= There are some sub-classes known as Schedule-Preserving DEVS (SP-DEVS) and Finite and Deterministic DEVS (FD-DEVS) which were designated to support verification analysis. SP-DEVS and FD-DEVS whose expressiveness are E(SP-DEVS) \\\\subset E(FD-DEVS)\\\\subset E(DEVS) where E(formalism) denotes the expressiveness of formalism.

Sherry owned and managed the station until Walton Broadcasting bought it in the mid-1970s. Sherry had been an NBC staff announcer in New York. Conway was an entertainer who had a million-selling record, \\"Jingle Jangle Jingle.\\" Walton, owner of several stations in the Southwest, brought Claude D. Barnett to Monterey. Walton had to surrender the license of KIKX, Tucson, Arizona, to the FCC after his staff staged a phony kidnapping as a ratings stunt. For many years, KIDD offered an adult standards/MOR format, using the name \\"Magic 63\\". On April 7, 2009, the station shifted to an oldies playlist comprising a wide range of mid-1950s to 1970s pop songs. This was prompted by KOMY's dropping of the oldies format. The morning hours were hosted by Kevin Kahl, who had been an on-air voice for \\"Magic 63\\".

KIDD remained a driving force in Monterey radio until 1985. In 1985, while facing strong competition from FM stations, under the direction of General Manager Claude D. Barnett, KIDD fired the entire air staff and joined a growing movement at the time in radio by switching to satellite programming. Many of the Central Coast's top personalities worked there, including Dave Andrews (the son of movie star Dana Andrews), Dave Bennett, Buck Buchanan, Byng Robbins, Phil Keller and Rob Mahr. Others appearing on KIDD include Jack Paar, Anthony Mafazolli, Jerry Teal, Ed Dickinson, Nick Souza, Sloan \\"Not So Loud the Neighbors Will Hear Us\\" Brown, Eileen Cashman, news stringer Jerry, Gene Rusco of KGO fame, and Rich Dixon who had a brief run at KGO in the late 1980s. Art Bell was on KIDD, when he lived in the Monterey area in the 1970s. Sean \\"Hollywood\\" Hamilton also spent some time on KIDD before moving on to Z-100 in New York and KIIS-FM in Los Angeles.

It is said to evoke the classic Western film The Searchers (1956). Plot summary Pella Marsh is the only daughter and eldest child in a family that is leaving behind New York City, in a near-future where the Earth has sustained severe damage from climate change. Before they can leave, Caitlin, Pella's mother, dies of a brain tumour, leaving Clement, her ineffectual father, to try to care for Pella and her brothers, Raymond and David. After twenty months of cryogenic suspended animation, the Marshs reach the Planet of the Archbuilders. This oceanless planet is inhabited by an advanced alien species known only as the Archbuilders, who are hermaphrodites. They built the complex and beautiful arch-like structures that dominate the terrain, terraformed their planet to provide a controlled climate, and used bioengineering to create several varieties of readily grown \\"potatoes\\" for a constant food supply. The Archbuilders themselves are furry and scaled creatures, with frond-like tentacles. There are also small, nearly invisible animals called \\"household deer,\\" which inhabit most every corner of the region without much obvious impact. Despite their apparent lack of high technology, the Archbuilders are skilled communicators, and have twenty thousand indigenous languages on their world. They also rarely give birth, implying considerable longevity. Like the other colonists, Pella is instructed to take acclimatisation pills, ostensibly to ward off indigenous Archbuilder viruses, but, because of her father's new plans for the humans in living with the world, she does not take them‚Äîmuch to the chagrin of the enigmatic resident Efram Nugent. After some time, rather like Ethan Edwards and Debbie in The Searchers (1956), Efram and Pella develop a love/hate relationship as she resists his misanthropic and speciesist attitudes toward both his fellow colonists and the Archbuilders. After she has decided to stop acclimatisation, she discovers that she has a rapport with the Archbuilders, and becomes increasingly influenced by their culture, civilisation and ecology, \\"going native\\". Her brother David and fellow child Morris Grant are similarly affected, as is the infant Melissa Richmond-Concorse. The four of them discover that one side-effect of adaptation to their new environment allows them to inhabit the bodies of the household deer temporarily. Ultimately, other colonists either leave the planet (like the Kincaids, after a mistaken child sexual abuse incident); die, like Efram Nugent (shot); or become similarly absorbed by Archbuilder culture. The latter are transformed into semi-nomads who dwell in the ruins of their former houses, as apparent entropy consumes their abortive colony - like Pella, David, Morris, Raymond and Doug. As for the Archbuilders, Truth Renowned dies in the fire that destroys Hugh Merrow's abandoned house and art studio, and Hiding Kneel is injured after Efram imprisons it in a shed. However, their community survives as a cohesive group, belying human perceptions of their alleged weakness and 'decay' of their civilisation and culture.

They specialise in high-end violin cases, which are handmade at their workshop in Cremona, Italy. Their cases are internationally renowned and are used by many leading soloists including Sarah Chang, Joshua Bell, Salvatore Accardo, Anne-Sophie Mutter, Isaac Stern, Uto Ughi, and Chlo√´ Hanslip. History The company was founded in 1983 by violinist and luthier Dimitri Musafia, who studied violin making at the Stradivari Institute. Musafia's objective was to create a violin case which focused primarily on instrument safety and aesthetics. After experimenting with variety of different materials over several years, a \\"specially-milled wood laminate\\" emerged as the preferred choice for the basis of construction, satisfying the requirements for both instrument safety and portability. Since then, Musafia cases have been the preferred choice for some of the most famous and expensive violins in the world, including Guarneris and the 1715 Stradivarius \\"Cremonese\\", previously played by Joseph Joachim. The construction specifics have changed over the years to ensure that their high standards are upheld. Up to this day, Musafia has remained a family-owned business, with all aspects of design and construction taking place in the company's Cremona workshop and overseen by Dmitri personally. Build The cases are manufactured from a high quality laminate shell and a four-point instrument suspension system is standard on all cases. Other important safety features include locking bow spinners, a hygrometer and a humidifier. Second to safety, aesthetic appeal and convenience are very important in the construction of Musafia cases. The vast majority of cases are equipped with the standard features such as a screw- attached teflon-treated cordura nylon cover (with an exterior music pocket), backpack provisions, a subway handle, a string tube and a large leather/leatherette handle. All the fittings and materials used in the construction of the case are of the highest quality. As well as violin cases, Musafia also build viola cases and double cases (cases for two violins, two violas or violin and viola). Current models As of October 2019, the current models in production are: *Lievissima EVOLUTION *Momentum *Momentum Z *Superleggero *Luxury Model (series 3) *Aeternum (series 4) *Master Series *Engima (series 2) Options and accessories Musafia has a wide range of accessories and options which can be added to any case.

Former Los Angeles KHJ boss jock Don Murray (Carlson) began the station along with radio veteran Denis 'Catfish' Miller . The station used the call letters KYA, minus the additional 'A', as a tribute to the top 40 station in San Francisco in the 1960s and 1970s with the same call letters. Murray and Miller used the old KYA jingle package, and the station sounded just as it had before. Local radio veteran David Mars also worked on the station for a time. The station was simulcast on FM and AM and reached its peak of success in 2004. It was sold back to Salinas' Wolfhouse broadcasting after a failed LMA by People's Radio, and the format was dropped in favor of a more urban hip hop format, ending KYA and its rock and roll roots.

It was situated in the former residence of the Ba'ath Party governor of Maysan province. Determined to take the strongpoint, militia of the Shia Mahdi Army launched sustained attacks on the British positions at CIMIC House and the neighbouring Pink Palace, the seat of local government, beginning on 5 August 2004. Al Amarah was garrisoned by fewer than 90 Soldiers from Y Company of the 1st Battalion, The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (including TA elements from 52nd Lowland Regiment) and 60 from the Royal Welch Fusiliers. Both units were part of the 1st Mechanised Brigade on TELIC IV. The forces in Amarah were isolated some from the main Battle Group in Abu Naji, and dependent on convoys for resupply. During the siege, they faced an estimated 500 militia who launched a total of 86 assaults on the compound over the next 23 days, ranging from section strength up to a series of company-level assaults with 100-plus fighters. Incoming fire from the Mahdi Army included 595 mortar rounds from 230 different bombardments, direct hits with 57 rocket- propelled grenades and six 107 mm rockets plus 86 ground assaults on CIMIC (Civil-Military Co-operation) House itself. Y Company, 1 PWRR, based at CIMIC House, became the most attacked company in the entire Iraqi theatre of operations. In defending the compound, the British fired 33,000 rounds, and many Challenger 2, Warrior, and High Explosive 81mm Mortar shells and managed to persuade the US Air Force to drop a precision laser guided 500 lb bomb onto enemy mortar positions in open ground right in the middle of a built up-city, defending their positions in trying to repulse the Mahdi Army in what has been described by Y Company's Sergeant Dan Mill's book \\"Sniper One\\" as \\"the longest continuous action fought by the British Army since the Korean War 50 years ago\\". It was also the \\"lengthiest defensive stand since World War II\\". Fighting reached a peak between the 5 and 25 August when the intensity was such that armoured convoys were unable to reach the base to resupply the British, although none of the waves of infantry attacks by the Mahdi Army got within 30 metres of the British lines. During this time commanding officer, Major Justin Featherstone, was given permission to withdraw by his commanding officer if he felt events on the ground required it but refused to have his men leave their posts. Captain Charlie Curry was given command for 6 days during this time when Major Featherstone went on R&R.; At the end of the siege, six British soldiers were injured seriously in the battle, the only fatality on the British side was Private Chris Rayment who died when a traffic barrier fell on his head, after the linkage was caught by a Snatch Land Rover which was entering the camp in a convoy, under heavy enemy fire. Mahdi Army casualties at the end of the battle were estimated by the British to be at least 200 dead, leaving them as a seriously depleted force in Al Amarah, incapable of attacking the British in large numbers for the remainder of the coalition occupation of the town. CIMIC House was handed over to the Iraqis at the end of August 2004, with the British consolidating their forces in Camp Abu Naji. Among the soldiers defending CIMIC house was a large contingent of Territorial Army soldiers who were mobilised to serve with the PWRR and QRL Battle Groups in April 2004. They included one Warrior (AFV) from B Coy 3 Scots The Blackwatch. Territorial soldiers from the 52nd Lowland Regiment and Soldiers from various different squadrons of the Royal Yeomanry regiment. Although these reservists contributed significantly to the defence of CIMIC house, their efforts were largely overshadowed by the regular PWRR (Y Company).https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/oct/26/iraq.iraqhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/oct/14/iraq.military References External links * Details on the battle * View of CIMIC- House from Google Maps Books on the siege *Sniper One - Sgt Dan Mills (The blistering true story of a British battle group under siege Category:Military operations involving the United Kingdom Category:Military operations of the Iraq War Category:2004 in Iraq Category:Conflicts in 2004 Category:Iraqi insurgency (2003‚Äì2011) Category:Occupation of Iraq Category:Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment Category:Royal Welch Fusiliers ","title":"Battle of the CIMIC House"},{"id":"14093309","text":"The Social Action Centre (Centro de Acci√≥n Social) was a political party in Guatemala.

In July 1962 the Tuaikaepau was under sail between Tonga and Auckland, carrying a crew and illegal immigrants totalling 17. On 7 July 1962 the Tuaikaepau, under the command of captain David Fifita, hit the outer edge of the Southern Minerva Reef. They all survived having spent the night clinging to the hull and at day break saw what would be their saviour: the hull of a Japanese fishing boat, Number 10, Noshemi Maru, K30, which had been wrecked in 1960, two years earlier. In the hull of the Japanese fishing boat they built a still from which they were able to make fresh water. A fire to run the still was kept burning almost constantly with wood from the hull of the wreck in which they were living. By the end of August it was decided that the only hope of rescue was to build a small boat and sail to Fiji, which they promptly did with tools found in the hull of the Japanese boat and from the wreck of Tuaikaepau. The makeshift outrigger canoe, with the captain and two others on board, reached Kadavu Island with the news that there were 13 survivors shipwrecked on the reef, although the captain's son, one of the two crewmembers, died just before arriving at Kadavu. On Monday 16 October, an RNZAF Sunderland flying boat from Laucala Bay, Fiji, flown by Group Captain J.D. Robbins, dropped supplies to them. The next day, Tuesday 16 October, the same Sunderland landed in the lagoon and rescued the ten survivors (of whom five were by now bedridden) and one body, departing Minerva at 3:30 p.m. and reaching Suva by dark. The Tongans were taken to Suva's Colonial War Memorial Hospital, but the only real health issues were dehydration and, for one, the onset of tuberculosis.

Nearly half of the total area is devoted to agricultural teaching and research fields, most of which are located west of the freeway. Development history View from Box Springs Mountain The original buildings that formed the earliest kernel of the campus included the UC Citrus Experiment Station laboratory, residential buildings, and barn, all of which are still in use today, although for different purposes. They were designed by Lester H. Hibbard of Los Angeles, a graduate of the University of California School of Architecture, in association with a colleague, H.B. Cody. Built at a cost of $165,000, the architecture of the major buildings followed the Mission Revival style suggesting the Spanish colonial heritage of Southern California. The site eventually opened in 1917. A third building, the North Wing, now known as Chapman Hall, was attached to the CES in 1931. View of the San Gabriel Mountains from the Botanic Gardens Further major construction largely ceased on the site until the groundbreaking for the new College of Letters and Science in April 1951. A group of five buildings in decidedly more Modern styles were completed by 1954: the Tom√°s Rivera Library, Webber Hall, Geology Building, Physical Education Building and Watkins Hall. These buildings were all constructed out of reinforced concrete and brick and designed by different architects paid for by state appropriation. The library was designed by the firm of Latta & Denny and constructed at a cost of $625,829. The Webber hall was designed by Chambers & Hibbard and cost $1,135,960, partially paid by State Fair and Exposition funds. The Geology Building cost $857,800 and was designed by Bennett & Bennett. The Physical Education building cost $983,000 and was designed by Arthur Froehlic. The Social Sciences Building, later renamed Watkins Hall, was designed by the firm of Clark & Frey and cost $1,051,000. In 1955, UCR purchased the 275 unit Canyon Crest housing complex, previously used by personnel stationed at nearby March Air Force Base, for use as student family housing. After five years of construction, UCR's first residence hall, the Aberdeen-Inverness, was completed in 1959. It was designed by the firm of Allison and Rible at a cost of $3,839,000 paid for by Federal loan funds. After the Regent's designation of UCR as \\"general campus\\" of UC system in 1958, many new buildings and additions were laid out over the following decade. Following an east-west axis, new student residence halls and athletic facilities were developed along the southeastern quadrant of the main campus, while academic and research facilities were built up along the central campus area closer to the freeway. The Carillon Tower, the only ornamental structure on campus, was built in this period. Past the freeway, over of agricultural fields extended northwest to the intersection of Chicago Avenue and Le Conte Drive, forming the borders of \\"West Campus.\\" After the drop in enrollment and subsequent restructuring of academic programs in the 1970s, little capacity construction was undertaken over the next two decades, except as required by the developing research interests of CNAS. Boyce Hall, completed in 1974, was the only major addition in the period, although several greenhouses and agricultural support units continued to be built. However, in the mid-80s, enrollment started to grow significantly, by 76% over six years (from 4,655 students in 1983 to 8220 students in 1989). This growth justified considerable further campus expansion over the 1990s. Major additions built in the 90s include the Entomology Research Museum completed in 1993, Bourns Hall completed in 1995, the Humanities & Social Science building in 1996, the Science Library in 1998, Pentland and Stonehaven residence halls in 2000, and the Arts building in 2001. Since 1999, to accommodate a further wave of enrollment growth, more than $730 million have been invested in new construction projects. Active construction projects include: Phase II of the Campus Commons expansion, Engineering Unit 3 and Materials Science Building, Psychology Research Building, Genomics Building, CHASS Instructional and Research Center, and a new Students Academic Support Services Building. The Campus Commons (Phase I), 'Glen Mor' Arroyo Student Housing Apartments, and Alumni & Visitors Center were recently completed. East campus notable features The Carillon Bell Tower is the dominant landmark in the center of the main campus. East Campus, comprising approximately , provides the core cluster of academic buildings and services. Student housing and recreational facilities are provided in its northern and easternmost portion near the Box Spring Mountains. Wide grassy pedestrian malls run throughout the campus. In the center of the main campus stands the UCR Carillon Bell Tower, one of only four in California. It was given as a gift by former UC regent Philip L. Boyd and his wife Dorothy. The dedication of the carillon and tower took place on October 2, 1966. Designed by A. Quincy Jones - Jones & Emmons of Los Angeles, the tower is tall and contains 48 bells, cast in France. The bells cover four chromatic octaves and weigh from 28 to 5,091 pounds. Live performances generally occur Wednesdays at noon during the academic year, with occasional performances scheduled on the weekends. The Commons student center was previously located directly northwest of the Bell tower. The four-decade old building was demolished at the end of 2005, and construction is under way to more than double the size of the center from 65,000 to . The first phase of the new $50 million Commons was recently completed, and includes meeting rooms, dining areas, places to study, and office space for student programs. And in March 2009, the Commons officially changed its name to the Highlander Union Building, or \\"The HUB\\" for short.http://hub.ucr.edu Southeast of the Bell tower is the Tom√°s Rivera Library, the main library. Further southeast past the intersection of Citrus and Eucalyptus Avenues are the buildings that make up the instruction halls and research centers of the College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences, including some of the original 1917 buildings. Forming the southeastern border of the Riverside campus are the Botanic Gardens, which occupy of rugged terrain in the Box Springs foothills. Prominent natural features include two arroyos and a variety of plants native to the site. More than four miles (6 km) of hiking trails traverse the grounds. The 60 freeway's University Avenue underpass separates the city and the university. Painted on the support walls of the underpass is the Gluck Gateway Mural, a murall of Riverside and UCR history from the days before the Citrus Experiment Station through 2000, the year the mural was painted. West campus notable features Route 60 forms a boundary between east and west campus. Of the of UCR property comprising the West Campus, approximately are citrus groves and row crops used primarily by the College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences. University Extension, the USDA Germplasm Repository, International Village (student housing), a parking lot, office buildings (Human Resources and Highlander Hall), and other small facilities are also located on the West Campus. University Village, a mixed use development located across from University Avenue adjacent to the freeway, provides a movie theater, stores, restaurants, office space, an apartment complex, as well as a parking structure and surface parking. The movie theaters serve as lecture halls during the day. Future capital expansion plans will convert dormant agricultural fields into new UCR infrastructure.

It is long and begins at a dead end at Riegelmann Boardwalk on Coney Island. The road goes north, leaving Coney Island, ending at Bay Parkway, where the road continues as the Bay Ridge Parkway (former Route 439). On December 11, 2008 it acquired the subsidiary name Polar Bear Club Walk, named for the Coney Island Polar Bear Club. The Stillwell Avenue/Surf Avenue intersection on Coney Island is the location of the Coney Island‚ÄìStillwell Avenue subway station, a major subway station in New York City. History Stillwell Avenue was named after settler Nicholas Stillwell (1603‚Äì1671), who had a farm in the area and became the progenitor of an influential Brooklyn family by the same name. Plans for Stillwell Avenue began in October 1926. The street was to stretch from Bay Parkway (its current northern terminus) and Neptune Avenue on Coney Island ( from the southern terminus). The project was to cost $331,500 and was certified by Brooklyn borough president James J. Byrne. Stillwell Avenue, at the intersection with Surf Avenue, is the location of an original Nathan's after the first one was torn down. The New York Sun newspaper released a story in 2006 about plans to reinvigorate Coney Island. Most of it was for amusement parks, as well as a large waterpark and a three-story carousel. A scaled down version of this plan would later become Luna Park. In 2016, plans were released for the redevelopment of the Shore Theater at the intersection with Surf Avenue.  Street description  South end North end Stillwell Avenue begins at the Atlantic Ocean on Coney Island, just north of the Riegelmann Boardwalk, occupying the position of West 14th Street. The road parallels Henderson Walk for a short distance to the intersection with Surf Avenue at 0.2 mile. Surf Avenue stretches parallel to the boardwalk on Coney Island. Neptune Avenue is the next intersection, intersecting at 0.4 mile. Soon afterwards, Stillwell Avenue crosses Coney Island Creek, which reaches into Lower New York Bay. Just after crossing the creek, Stillwell Avenue goes under the Shore Parkway, a section of the Belt Parkway system. Although it does not have an interchange with the road, Exit 6N on the westbound Shore Parkway is for Stillwell Avenue. Instead, the exit lets off at Avenue Z and accesses Stillwell within a mile. Bay 50th Street intersects just afterwards . Stillwell Avenue then passes Scarangella Park and intersects 86th Street at . At , there is an intersection with Kings Highway, which ends soon afterwards at Bay Parkway. Stillwell Avenue also comes to an end at Bay Parkway, from its start.

OMA is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums (AAM) and is a member of the North American Reciprocal Museums program.  History  The history of the Orlando Museum of Art (OMA) is one of growth guided by community leadership. OMA was founded in 1924 as Orlando Art Association. Its name was changed to the Loch Haven Art Center in 1960, and again to the Orlando Museum of Art in 1986. The organization began as a small art center with a group of artists who met informally in the early 1920s, displaying and critiquing their work. In the late 1950s, the community raised funds to build a new facility designed by James Gamble Rogers III, which was completed in 1960. OMA began to collect art in 1960 when it accepted the donations of important American paintings by Georgia O'Keeffe and Charles Sheeler. OMA continued its expansion, working with architects Nils Schweizer and Duane Stark, both students of Frank Lloyd Wright. By 1969 OMA had added new galleries, a 250-seat auditorium, three studio classrooms, a library, vault and offices. During the 1970s, OMA was given a major collection of Art of the Ancient Americas, and additional works of African Art, and also formed the nucleus of its acclaimed Contemporary American Graphics Collection. In 1985, OMA was designated a \\"major cultural institution\\" by the State of Florida. In the 1997, OMA completed a $13.5 million facility renovation and building project which expanded the facility to its current size of 80,000 square feet.  Collections  OMA's collection boasts more than 2,400 objects including Contemporary Art, American Art from the 18th century to 1945, Art of the Ancient Americas and African Art. The Art of the Ancient Americas collection is among the finest of its kind in the Southeastern United States. On May 1, 2018, OMA announced that it may become the permanent home of an extensive collection of the paintings of Belgian Post-Impressionist painter, Louis Dewis. OMA presented a small exhibition of seven Dewis paintings from May 18 through September 9, 2018, as a preview of a major Dewis exhibition presented January 25 through May 5, 2019.

Archaeology A large pagan burial ground from the 5th and 6th centuries AD has been found south of Malthouse Farm (OS grid reference SP382033) in Brighthampton. It was revealed when ploughing disturbed human bones in 1820. Excavation in 1857‚Äì58 found 54 burials, 10 cremation burials and a wide range grave goods, which are now in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford. Notable artefacts found include an iron sword with a gilt scabbard and an ornate gilt brooch. Since then set of six burials was found at Malthouse Farm in 1892, and the burial of a child was found in 1949. History Brighthampton's toponym means Beorhthelm's t≈´n. In the 10th century it was part of the royal manor of Bampton, and in AD 984 √Üthelred II gave land at Brighthampton to one of his ministers. The Domesday Book records that in 1086 William the Conqueror's half-brother Odo, Bishop of Bayeux was Brighthampton's feudal overlord. However, William I imprisoned Odo from 1082 until 1087 and confiscated his lands. In 1131 Henry I granted land at Brighthampton to S√©es Priory in Normandy. This is likely to have been the same land that William I had confiscated from Odo. At the same time Henry granted land at Hardwick to the same priory, and these together became a single manor of Hardwick and Brighthampton. There is a record from early in the 17th century of Brighthampton having a stone cross, and in 1857 it was recorded that there was still the base of an \\"ancient\\" stone cross (presumably mediaeval) at the hamlet's central crossroads. Historic buildings Manor Farmhouse, Brighthampton Forge Cottage is a 16th-century timber-framed building supported by a central cruck. By 1776 it was trading as a public house, the Red Lion. Another pub in Brighthampton, the Golden Balls, had been licensed by 1753. It was rebuilt early in the 20th century, ceased trading in 1992 and was demolished in 1994. The farmhouse of Manor Farm (also called Florey's Farm) is of Cotswold stone and was built early in the 17th century. It was extended in the middle of the 17th century and again in the 19th century. Baptist chapel A few families of nonconformists were recorded in the parish in the latter part of the 17th century, and in the 18th century several local families were Anabaptists who attended a chapel in Cote. A Baptist chapel was built between Brighthampton and Standlake in 1832, flourished in the 1840s and 50's and a gallery was added to increase capacity in 1865. In the 20th century falling attendances led to services being discontinued in 1937, but they were resumed in 1951. The chapel finally closed in 1978 and in 1994 it was serving as the offices of a missionary society. It is now a private house.Oxfordshire Churches & Chapels: Standlake References Sources and further reading  Category:Hamlets in Oxfordshire ","title":"Brighthampton"},{"id":"14093393","text":"KRML (1410 AM) is an American radio station licensed to serve Carmel, California. The station, established in 1958 as KTEE, is currently owned and operated by Scot McKay. The station's broadcast license is held by CVAC, Inc. KRML was the setting for the 1971 Clint Eastwood film Play Misty For Me. Programming KRML broadcasts an adult album alternative music format to the Monterey Bay area, branded as KRML Radio. KRML was simulcast over FM translator K271BP 102.1 FM until February 1, 2020 when it moved to 94.7 FM. =History= Launch as KTEE Broadcasting with 500 watts of power as a daytime-only station on a frequency of 1410 kHz, this station began regular operations in 1958 as KTEE. The station was established by Seaside Electronic Associates with Paul F. Hanson serving as the president, general manager, and news director. Hanson's original staff included Joly Boynton as chief engineer and co-program director, William Warren as co-program director, and Tillie Jones as women's director. By 1959, Hanson assumed the program director role with Hal Briggs as chief engineer and Alleene Knight as women's director. 1960s The Carmel Broadcasting Company acquired the station on March 4, 1960, and had the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) change the station's call sign to KRML. Under the new ownership, Sam S. Smith became president and general manager with Alan B. Skuba as station manager and Ralph S. Click as chief engineer. Personnel turnover meant that by 1963 Mel Leeds was general manager and program director, Bob Davis became news director, and Bill Robinson was named chief engineer. At the same time, the station's specialty programming included weekly half-hour programs in German and Italian plus 10 hours of Spanish language programming each week. The station was again placed up for sale and on November 17, 1965, KRML was acquired by a new company called KRML, Inc. Alan C. Lisser was company president with John T. McCartt as general manager, Kim Collins as program director, and Fred Sweet as chief engineer. The new owners obtained a construction permit for a new FM sister station to be called \\"KRML-FM\\". However, plans fell through and the permit was transferred to Monterey Bay Area Media who eventually signed on KLRB-FM (101.7 FM, now license as KCDU). In 1968, Jan Allen became KRML's program director with Ed Parkhurst as the new chief engineer. 1968 also saw the station sold yet again, this time to Samuel & D.R. Salerno who acquired KRML on October 25, 1968. Samuel Salerno held the offices of president and general manager with D.R. Salerno as secretary-treasurer. 1970s The Salerno ownership group, now doing business as KRML, Inc., brought a degree of stability to KRML in the 1970s. Sam Salerno held onto the station for nearly 9 years before placing the station up for sale. On October 1, 1977, KRML was acquired by the Edwards Broadcasting Company, Inc., with George A. Edwards as president and general manager. The station shifted to a religious radio format. 1980s In October 1982, the Edwards Broadcasting Company applied to the FCC to upgrade KRML from daytime-only to 24-hour operation with a stronger signal from a new broadcast tower site. The FCC granted the initial construction permit for this change in June 1983. As ownership changed, so did the station's proposed new tower sites, signal strengths, and financial conditions. The project was granted extensions, renewals, and modifications throughout the 1980s and 1990s before the permit was ultimately cancelled at then-current station ownership's request in February 1999. While a limited- range 16 watt nighttime signal was added to the station, it essentially remains the same 500 watt daytimer that it signed on as back in 1957. In August 1985, the Edwards Broadcasting Company reached an agreement to sell KRML to Wisdom Broadcasting Company, Inc. The FCC approved the deal on October 7, 1985, and the transaction was formally consummated on January 16, 1986. At the time of the sale, Wisdom Broadcasting Company was 100% owned by Gilbert F. Wisdom. 1990s During 1993 and 1994, KRML derived some of its programming from the satellite feed of KJAZ (92.7 FM) in San Francisco. KJAZ dropped its jazz format in 1994 to become a rock station, discontinuing the programming service. Seeking to step back from day-to-day operations of KRML while retaining an ownership interest, Gilbert F. Wisdom applied to the FCC in December 1994 for permission to sell a 50% stake in Wisdom Broadcasting Company, Inc., to Alan P. Schultz. Along with this ownership split, Wisdom informed the FCC that Schultz would have effective control of the station's broadcast license. The FCC approved the deal on January 13, 1995, and the transaction was formally consummated on February 8, 1995. 2000s In March 2004, Wisdom and Schultz agreed to sell all of their shares in Wisdom Broadcasting Company, Inc., to David C. Kimball. To resolve various financial obligations within the company, Kimball paid Wisdom $725,000 for his 50% and paid Schultz $425,000 for his 50%. The FCC approved the license transfer on April 23, 2004, and the transaction was formally consummated on June 10, 2004. Kimball moved the station to the Eastwood Building in the center of Carmel. In 2009, David C. Kimball declared personal bankruptcy. As part of the resolution of this financial situation, Kimball agree to transfer ownership of Wisdom Broadcasting Company, Inc., to Monterey County Bank. The bank already held a lien on the station's broadcast equipment and other property. The FCC approved the move on November 3, 2009, and the transaction was formally consummated the same day. The bank immediately began to seek a buyer for the station. 2010s In August 2011, the bank applied to the FCC for permission to transfer the KRML broadcast license from Wisdom Broadcasting Company, Inc., to Carmel Valley Athletic Club, Inc. This company is 100% owned by Scot E. McKay. The purchase price from the bank totaled just $150,000, a full million dollars less than David C. Kimball had paid for the station in 2004. (The bank had been asking for as much as $350,000.) Station property purchased include the transmitter building, broadcast tower, the station's license and intellectual properties, plus a 1998 Yamaha C5 conservatory grand piano. Excluded from the sale were the inventory of the jazz store, the Blackhawk music collection, various concert items, and a Hammond B3 organ. The FCC approved the deal on October 18, 2011, and the transaction was formally consummated on November 6, 2011. On October 15, 2012, the jazz format was dropped in favor of stunting as \\"Radio Yummy\\", in anticipation of a format change. KRML adopted a ten-song playlist and a new slogan, \\"Your hits over and over and over again.\\" On Monday, October 29, 2012, Scot McKay explained that \\"Radio Yummy\\" was meant to show all that is bad with \\"corporate radio.\\" He promised that KRML would be live and local and be responsive to the listeners. KRML changed its format to a broad-based adult album alternative format with several lifestyle programs (food and wine, travel, entertainment, local music) on weekends. The jazz format is now online only, at http://www.krml.com =Film appearance= In the 1971 motion picture Play Misty for Me, KRML is the radio station where Dave (Clint Eastwood) is a DJ harassed by a caller, Evelyn (played by Jessica Walter) who wants him to play \\"Misty\\" for her.

It was historically in the Hundred of Ewelme and is now in the District of South Oxfordshire. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 208. The parish is roughly rectangular, about long north‚Äìsouth and about wide east‚Äìwest. In 1848 the parish covered an area of . The B4009 road linking Benson and Watlington forms part of the southern boundary of the parish. The B480 road linking Oxford and Watlington forms a small part of its northern boundary. Rumbolds Lane forms much of its western boundary. For the remainder the parish is bounded largely by field boundaries. Toponym \\"Brightwell\\" is derived from the Old English for \\"bright spring\\".In fact a simple corruption of the words: Bride's Well. The name of the ancient British goddess (Bridget or Bride). This shows the antiquity of the place. \\"Baldwin\\" is the name of a family that held the manor. The earliest known record of Brightwell Baldwin is a Saxon charter of AD 854 in the Cartularium Saxonicum that records the toponym as Beorhtawille or Brihtanwylle. Almost a century later a Saxon charter of AD 945 records it as Byrhtanwellan. The Domesday Book of 1086 records it as Bretewelle. Brightwell Park Brightwell Park's 17th-century dovecote The old country house of the Stone family burnt down in 1786, but a cruciform 17th-century dovecote that was some distance from the house survives in the park. In 1790 a replacement house was built. It has since been demolished, but its kitchen wing, stables, ice house and an 18th-century stone arch bridge in the park survive. Parish church The earliest parts of the Church of England parish church of Saint Bartholomew are 13th century, including a stair turret and a number of lancet windows, notably in the chancel. Early in the 14th century the nave was rebuilt in the Decorated Gothic style, with north and south aisles linked to it by arcades of four bays. The west tower and the Perpendicular Gothic east window of the chancel were added in the 15th century. The pulpit and tester are Jacobean and therefore 17th century. The building was restored in 1895 and is a Grade I listed. Church monuments in St Bartholomew's include a number of brasses. In the north aisle is a brass commemorating John the Smith, who died in 1371. It bears an epitaph written in Middle English, which may be the earliest example of an inscription in the English language. The epitaph reflects upon human mortality: > man com & se how schal alle dede li: wen √æow comes bad & bare > noth hab ven ve awa·∫è fare: All ·∫ès wermƒìs √æt ve for care:‚Äî > bot √æt ve do for god·∫ès luf ve haue nothyng yare: > hunyr √æis graue l·∫ès John ye sm·∫èth god yif his soule heuen grit In the chancel are two brasses commemorating John Cottesmore, who died in 1439. Stone monuments include two 16th-century chest tombs of members of the Carleton family, and a substantial English Baroque monument to members of the Stone family on the east wall of the north chapel. The latter was built in about 1670 or 1690, replacing monuments to John Stone (died 1640) and his son Sir Richard Stone (died 1660) that were destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. The bell tower has a ring of six bells. John Saunders of Reading, Berkshire cast the tenor bell in about 1559. Ellis I Knight, also of Reading, cast the fifth bell in 1637. Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast or recast the treble, second, third and fourth bells in 1911. There is also a Sanctus bell that was cast in about 1550. The churchyard includes a late 18th-century chest tomb a number of 17th-century gravestones that are Grade II listed. Another 17th-century monument commemorates one Stephen Rumbold, who died in 1687 aged 105. On it a rhyming epigram bets with its readers: > He liv'd one hundred and five > Sanguine and Strong > An hundred to five > You do not live so long St Bartholomew's parish is now part of the benefice of Ewelme, Brightwell Baldwin, Cuxham and Easington. The Lord Nelson Inn, seen from St Bartholomew's parish churchyard Amenities Brightwell Baldwin has a 17th-century pub, The Lord Nelson Inn. It is now a gastropub.The Nelson The Old Forge is a Grade II listed former blacksmiths shop: it was bought in 2002 by the Duke and Duchess of Kent.

It dates from the early 17th century, and was the home of Tam Dalyell until his death in January 2017. The estate spreads over two hills (bens in Gaelic) from which its name is derived, i.e. it is named \\"the house of the hills\\". It is set in 200 acres (80 hectares) of parkland, and the house enjoys panoramic views of central Scotland: to the north, across the River Forth to the Highlands, and south over the Pentland Hills. The house contains a collection of porcelain, furniture, and portraits which trace the family's lives and interests through the centuries.National Trust for Scotland, A Guide to Properties, 2007 History of the Estate Perhaps inhabited since prehistoric times, Binns Hill may have been the site of a Pictish fort. Written records begin in 1335, and record a land of the \\"Bynnis\\". There was certainly a manor house here by 1478, when records indicate the owner was an Archibald Meldrum, son of the late James Meldrum of the Bynnis. In 1599, it was owned by James Lord Lyndsay, who sold it to Sir William Livingston of Kilsyth. In 1612 the estate was purchased by a wealthy and well-connected Edinburgh burgess, Thomas Dalyell. Dalyell was a butter merchant, who had become prosperous importing butter from Orkney to Leith (to be sold as axle grease). In 1601, he had married the daughter of Edward, Lord Kinloss and, when the Scots King, James VI, ascended to the English throne and Kinloss was made his Master of the Rolls in London, Dalyell obtained the lucrative post of deputy. In that senior position, he acquired enough of a fortune to return to Scotland and join the landed gentry. He bought \\"the lands of Bynnis and Croceflattis wirth the manor place thereof\\", and the Dalyell family have lived there ever since. Between 1621 and 1630, this Thomas Dalyell rebuilt the original house, and parts of the interior still reflect that period; in particular the north-west portion of the present entrance front, and decoration of the High Hall and King's Room (created in the hope of a visit from Charles I, which never came to be). These rooms still contain examples of some of the earliest cornices and mouldings in Scotland. Thomas Dalyell's more famous son, the Royalist General Sir Tam Dalyell continued the development of the house, adding the first of the towers, and the western range. Today the house principally reflects its extensions of the mid 18th and early 19th century. In the 1740s, Robert Dalyell added the dining-room and a morning room, whilst around 1810, the architect William Burn (1789‚Äì1870) adapted the building to the Scottish baronial style, adding further towers and mock battlements. Some of the Gothic exterior decoration was inspired by Walter Scott, who was a friend of the Dalyell family. Today, the building is three- storey at the main north facade, with two-storey wings. In 1944, the house, its parkland, its contents, and an endowment for its upkeep were given to the National Trust for Scotland by Eleanor Dalyell. The charter she granted states that the \\"history, legend and memory of the family of Dalyell of the Binns, shall be preserved...\\" for the benefit and enjoyment of the nation. However, the right of the family to reside in the house was retained. The former MP for Linlithgow and \\"Father of the House\\", Sir Tam Dalyell (1932‚Äì2017), lived in the western range of the house. His widow, Kathleen, is the National Trust's representative for the House of the Binns and heavily involved in its maintenance. General Tam o' the Binns General Tam Dalyell of the Binns (1615‚Äì1685). Picture in the National Gallery of Scotland. The house's main historic claim to fame is the occupancy of General Sir Tam Dalyell (1615‚Äì1685). Dalyell served as a military commander for both Charles I and Charles II. During the Civil War, he was taken prisoner by the parliamentarians at the battle of Worcester and imprisoned in the Tower of London. However, he escaped and travelled to Russia where he fought for the Tsar ‚Äî earning the epithet \\"Muscovite De'il\\". He returned to Scotland at the Restoration of the king, and secured his feared reputation (as \\"Bluidy Tam\\") by his violent suppression of the Covenanters from the 1660s. In 1678, he became Commander-in-Chief in Scotland and, in 1681, he mustered a new regiment at the Binns, becoming its first colonel. That Regiment, the Royal Regiment of Scots Dragoons, which later became the Royal Scots Greys in 1877, was to have itself a long history. Many artefacts belonging to General Dalyell (including his boots) are still located at the Binns. Some are connected with the fairly dubious stories that have grown up around him. In this house, the General is said to have played cards with the Devil: and today, in the entrance (or Laigh) hall, the very table on which he is supposed to have played can still be seen. The story goes that, although the devil normally beat Tam, one night Tam won, and in fury the Devil threw a marble table at him. However, it missed and it landed in the Sergeants' Pond outside. A marble table was indeed found when the pond dried up 200 years later. The cards, goblet and spoon, supposedly used in the game are displayed in the house. The General is said to have told the Devil, who threatened to blow down his house and its walls, that \\"I will build me a turret at every corner to pin down my walls\\".Colin McWilliam, \\"The Buildings of Scotland: Lothian except Edinburgh\\" (Penguin Books, 1978), p. 102. The Parkland The tower stands as a folly within the estate park The house is set in of parkland, and approached by two drives: the current west drive, and main east drive that has been disused since 1913. The category \\"B\\" listed folly Binns Tower is situated at the highest point of the park, Binns Hill. It was designed by Alexander Allan in 1826, allegedly as the result of a wager placed with the then owner, Sir James Dalyell. On the west side of Binns Hill is a woodland garden with walks through it to the tower. Beneath the escarpment to the south-west of the Tower is General Tam's cave, supposedly used by him for meditation. In addition to the folly, the park contains a number of other important features. Off the west drive is a derelict stables and a walled garden. The walled garden, constructed at an unknown date, served as a kitchen garden until World War II. It is presently used by a contractor as a tree and shrub nursery, although part is used to provide flowers for the house. Also near the west drive is the Sergeant's Pond, which was constructed as a watering place for the horses of the Royal Scots Greys by General Dalyell. In a valley in the south-east corner of the park there is a caravan park which was established in 1978, the caravan park also includes a small woodland area.

It is the job of the commissioning editor to advise the publishing house on which books to publish. Usually the actual decision of whether to contract a book is taken by a senior manager rather than the editor. Some magazines also employ commissioning editors.  Responsibilities  The other roles of commissioning editors vary between companies. Usually they are also responsible for ensuring that authors under contract deliver typescripts to specification and on time. They thus have an author management role. They usually have responsibility for ensuring that typescripts are of sufficient quality. In this, especially in textbook and reference publishing, commissioning editors may be assisted by development editors or assistant editors. Furthermore, in textbook companies, this role is responsible for managing title revisions, signing new authors, and ensuring products are profitable. In some (usually small) companies, commissioning editors are also responsible for overseeing the copy-editing, typesetting, proofreading, and design of books, although in other companies this responsibility is assumed by other staff e.g. Managing Editors, House Editors, and Production Editors. Commissioning editors are also often responsible for managing books that have already been published, for example by ensuring that stock levels are adequate and advising on when a book needs to be reprinted.  Commissioning process  Commissioning editors may commission in a number of ways: # pro-actively: by thinking of ideas for books and then finding authors to write them # reactively: by reacting to book proposals or manuscripts # collaboratively: by formulating ideas in dialogue with authors # by republishing previously published books # by co-publishing (\\"buying in\\") books being published elsewhere or in other editions by other companies  Role  Sometimes the phrase Acquisitions Editor is used. This is a near synonym for Commissioning Editor. Possibly the word \\"Acquisitions\\" implies more emphasis on types (4) and (5) above. Commissioning has not been formulated into a profession. There is little formal training available. Recently there has been some attempt in the UK to articulate and establish professional standards. Most commissioning editors work up to the post through experience in other roles e.g. Editorial Assistant. Some editors see the post as a stepping stone to a senior management job (e.g. Publisher, Editorial Director, Publishing Director); others are content to remain in the post and to build a reputation as a star editor.  Qualities  There is little consensus on what makes good commissioning editors, though most people in the industry would agree that the following are desirable and important: * business acumen: understanding the market and the company's place in the market * creativity * linguistic sensitivity * communicativeness * project management skills References The standard work on the subject is Gill Davies' Book Commissioning and Acquisition (Routledge).

It originally aired on November 5, 2007. Plot Marshall and Lily finally become tired of Ted's never-ending presence and his invasion on the married couple's personal space, so they decide to rent a new apartment. In the newspaper they find an apartment in a neighborhood called 'Dowisetrepla', which is explained as part of New York City's tendency to shorten neighborhood names (such as Tribeca and Soho), and is supposedly an up-and-coming neighborhood in the city. The apartment is for sale, rather than for rent, but Marshall convinces Lily to view it with him. Marshall falls in love with the apartment in Dowisetrepla, imagining himself playing drums in a band with his future sons. Lily feels guilty because of the huge credit card debt she hides from Marshall, but still imagines herself painting with two daughters, and eventually ends up saying that she loves it, despite Robin persisting that Lily tell Marshall the truth. Meanwhile, Barney hooks up with a young woman, Meg, and takes her to the apartment in Dowisetrepla so he can sneak out while she is in the shower. The next day, Lily and Marshall apply for a mortgage, and Marshall finds out about Lily's credit card debt. Later, Ted, Barney, and Robin go home, where Ted discovers that Lily and Marshall were having a fight based on \\"evidence\\" strewn about the room. Ted incorrectly concludes the fight was over something minor (the peanut butter jar, Lily leaving the jar out after Marshall's repeated insistence to not do so) while believing that Robin's truth about the credit card debt as bogus. To prove his theory, Ted hits re-dial on the apartment phone, expecting the number to be Marshall's cell phone, which Lily would have called to apologize and make up. They instead hear the receptionist of a divorce lawyer, and panic. Robin reveals the truth to Barney and Ted about Lily's debt, and they all begin to consider how their lives will be with Lily and Marshall broken up. Robin insists that Lily will get her while Marshall will get Ted and Barney. Lily and Marshall return and explain that Lily had the idea of divorcing Marshall so he would not be dragged down by her debt. However, Marshall replied by saying, \\"When I married you, I married all your problems, too.\\" Finally, they exclaim that they bought the apartment. The next day, Lily and Marshall take a taxi to their new home, but as they step out of the cab, they smell an extremely strong stench. The cab driver reveals that the area is near the sewage treatment plant, but the plant is shut down on weekends. They realize that \\"DoWiSeTrePla\\" is short for: DOwnWInd of the SEwage TREatment PLAnt and this reveals why the real estate agent wanted the apartment to be viewed on the weekends.

He played college football at the University of Texas. Speyrer was a first team all state running back at Port Arthur Jefferson High school and a two-time all american receiver at the University of Texas. He is a member of the University of Texas Hall of Honor and the Cotton Bowl Hall of Fame and the only player ever named to the Cotton Bowl All-Decade team in two different decades. Speyrer was a key play-maker in what is considered by some to be the most famous drive in Texas history. Texas was fresh off its famed 15‚Äì14 come- from-behind victory over No. 2 Arkansas in the Game of the Century with President Richard M Nixon in attendance. \\"1969 Shootout\\". Texas earned the right to represent the Southwest Conference in the Cotton Bowl where there opponent was eighth-ranked Irish, this represented Notre Dame's 1st bowl game in 40 years. Notre Dame, featuring Joe Theismann, and the University of Texas at Austin. But the early proceedings had the makings of one of the decade's biggest upsets when Notre Dame charged out to a 10‚Äì0 lead. Starting on their own 24-yard line, the Longhorns embarked upon a fourth-quarter, 17-play march that included a pair of fourth-and-two conversions, the last coming at the Notre Dame 10 when James Street completed a clutch pass to a diving Speyrer that took the Horns to the two. From there, it took three plays before Billy Dale pushed the ball over the goal line to cement UT's second national title‚ÄîTexas 21, Notre Dame 17. Speyrer is also known for his last minute touchdown catch during his senior year in a come-from‚Äîbehind win during the Texas‚ÄìUCLA game in the fall of 1970. The catch and victory was a key part of Texas finishing the regular season undefeated where they were awarded their 3rd National title (1963, 1969 & 1970) by the UPI Coach's Poll. Cotton Speyer would then be drafted by the Washington Redskins in the 2nd round and would spend 4 seasons in the NFL finishing his career as a Miami Dolphin.

It broadcasts on FM frequency 102.3 MHz and is under ownership of Townsquare Media. History KNTO-FM, the first FM station in the Wichita Falls area, went on air in August 1961, owned by a partnership of five local businessmen including Bob Lipscomb, Bill Thacker, and three others, and the station's callsign stood for \\"North Texas and Oklahoma\\".. KNTO operated from the Onaway Trail tower, still used today, on 95.1 MHz with 3,100 watts horizontal only at 430 feet above average terrain. Studios were on Galveston Drive (near present I-44) before moving to the Onaway Trail building. The format was easy listening/beautiful music. The station was not an instant success. There was some income from Muzak brand background music played on the station's SCA channel. Oilman Stephen M. Gose bought the station in 1965, and sold in 1968. The next owners were a partnership of Ralph C. Parker, owner of Mobile Phone of Texas, Inc., and Joe Edd Sweatt, a local general contractor, who had recently built Mr. Gose's new residence. They hired a new manager, Bill Spurgeon, who took the station to hard rock. The KNTO call letters stayed but the logo was modified to include a peace symbol. The station gained popularity with the younger generation, but not with advertisers. The format was changed to \\"Conservative Contemporary\\". Local DJs during the hard rock era for the station included Bill Daniels. In 1973, the station was sold to WDAS AM/FM Philadelphia owner Max M. Leon, and his son Steve, who owned WDAS-AM-FM in Philadelphia. The station filed for and received a grant to move to 103.3 MHz with 100,000 watts horizontal and vertical at 450 feet. In 1977 the format was changed to smooth jazz, and in 1977 to Disco-rock. The FCC investigated some character qualification issues at WDAS. The renewal of KNTO was delayed. In 1978 a deal was struck to sell KNTO to AM 990 KNIN. This was never approved at the FCC. In 1980 a sale was allowed to \\"Sunshine Radio\\", a partnership of the Dorsey radio interests and the holdings of Anthony Brandon. They relaunched the station as \\"QV-103\\" KKQV with an album-leaning Top 40 format. The station dropped Texas State Network in favor of RKO Radio. KKQV then acquired 1290 AM KTRN from Sammons-Ruff Communications in 1980. In 1985 KTRN changed its call sign to KLLF (King's Life 1290) and changed formats to Christian. In 1988 it changed formats again to Spanish language making it the first Spanish language station in Wichita Falls, later to News/Talk which it remains today. Known now as NewsTalk 1290. In 1990, 103.3 KKQV changed its calls to KWFS with oldies, then to country. In 1995, KWFS was adopted as the 1290 AM letters and a -FM suffix was added to the FM.

He joined the National Party on its formation in 1936, and \\"later acted effectively as Holland's deputy\\". Biography =Early life and career= Polson was born in Wanganui to Scottish immigrants Donald Gunn Polson and Janet Campbell Gillies, and was educated at Wanganui Collegiate School. After finishing school he worked on his father's farm until ill health caused him to cease work. During his recuperation he taught himself shorthand and later became a journalist. He was Wellington provincial president of New Zealand Farmers' Union from 1920 to 1921 and became dominion president from 1921 to 1936. Polson's position as president meant he became prominent in national politics. He clashed with the Reform government over meat marketing in 1919, monopolistic marketing trusts in the face of a produce price slump in 1921. He initiated the Meat Export Control Act in 1922 to help local farmers‚Äô profits. He had married Florence Ada Mary Lamb Wilson in 1910 with whom he had four children. Florence helped found the Women's Division of the New Zealand Farmers' Union and became its first president from 1925 to 1929. =Political career= Polson was a member of the Wanganui County Council from 1911 to 1917 and for three years he was the council's chairman. He was also a member of the Wanganui Harbour Board. As council chairman he instigated the construction of the Durie Hill Elevator. Polson represented the electorate of in Parliament from 1928 to 1946. He retired from Parliament in 1946, when the seat of Stratford was eliminated by electoral boundary changes. He made a point of declining the United Party nomination, believing it more befitting that the leader of the Farmers' Union be non-partisan. In 1936, following the election of the First Labour Government, Polson resigned as Farmers' Union president and joined the new National Party. Polson played a key role in replacing Adam Hamilton as National Party leader with Sidney Holland. Thereafter Holland maintained Polson as a close confidant and he became Deputy Leader of the Opposition (an informal post at the time) as a sign to preserve unity between both the rural and urban sectors of the National Party. On 30 June 1942 Polson became minister of primary production for war purposes in Peter Fraser's short-lived War Administration until 2 October when he resigned. In 1943 he was acting Leader of the Opposition whilst Holland was overseas. During World War II he was a strong advocator that New Zealand forces should be deployed in the Pacific theatre, not Europe. In 1943 he married Mary Grigg, who had represented the electorate from 1942, after her MP husband Arthur Grigg, then a major in the NZEF, was killed in Libya in 1941. He was appointed to the Legislative Council on 15 March 1950, as a member of the suicide squad which was to vote the Council out of existence. From 15 March 1950 until 12 December 1950 he was a Minister without portfolio in the First National Government. =Later life and death= He died at his home in Mangamahu on 8 October 1960, survived by his second wife and two sons and a daughter from his first marriage. Honours In 1935, Polson was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal. In the 1951 King's Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George for public and political services.

Security paper is a paper used in security printing that incorporates features that can be used to identify or authenticate a document as original, e.g., watermarks or invisible fibres in paper, or features that demonstrate tamper evidence when fraud is attempted, e.g., to remove or alter print such as amounts or signatures on a cheque. Examples of this kind of papers are those used for identification such as passports and certificates, such as birth certificates and different types of academic and qualification certificates, as well as government documents, e.g., voting ballots and tax strips. This also extends to personal and business checks, stock certificates, certificates issued by financial institutions and sensitive government-issued documents. The main use of security paper is to stop people from counterfeiting. History An initial patent for the manufacturing process for security paper was granted to Robert E. Menzies and John E. Aitken in the early 20th century. According to the patent, the method by which security paper was produced involved using a soluble thiocyanate (such as ammonium thiocyanate) and lead, which could be used to create an insoluble salt, lead thiocyanate. This compound would then bind to the paper pulp, adding weight and diminishing visibility of the inner contents of the envelope.

Licensed to Calistoga, California, it has coverage throughout much of the north San Francisco Bay Area. KBBF is owned and operated by the Bilingual Broadcasting Foundation Inc. (BBFI). BBFI was founded in 1971 and KBBF went on the air in 1973, the first bilingual (English-Spanish) community radio station in the United States. It was one of the first FM stations between Santa Rosa and Portland, Oregon. History The Bilingual Broadcasting Foundation, Inc. (BBFI) was created in August 1971 by several Sonoma State University students and community leaders with the specific purpose of operating an educational radio station that would perform public services. It received funding and support from the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Foundation. The station was deeded property at 4010 Finley Ave in Santa Rosa on land that was part of a decommissioned naval auxiliary air station. Offices and studios were built on the site and a transmitter and antenna were installed atop Mount Saint Helena, located at the intersection of Sonoma, Napa and Lake counties about 15 miles N-NE of Santa Rosa, California. The station went on the air on May 31, 1973. Throughout its history, KBBF has been a mostly-volunteer organization concentrating on supporting the local Latino population. However, in 2008 the station hit a low point in its long and storied history when its General Manager was discovered to have a felony drug conviction and the station lost its Public Service Grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. In 2010, lightning struck the transmitter site causing severe damage and in 2011 the city of Santa Rosa slapped a $56,000 lien against the station's Finley Avenue property for repeated failures to resolve code issues. In 2008, a group of concerned community members called \\"Voces Cruzando Fronteras\\" sued BBFI, which resulted in a court order forcing new elections to the Board of Directors. In 2011 the new Board abandoned the condemned property on Finley Ave and moved the offices and studios to rented space in the Community Action Partnership complex at 1300 N. Dutton Avenue. In 2013 KBBF moved again to the present location in the Carpenters' Labor Center at 1700 Corby Avenue in Santa Rosa. In 2015, the station was pledged $100,000 from an anonymous donor that provided funding for hiring a new General Manager, the first paid employee in several years. Two modern broadcast studios have been constructed at the facility as well as a portable studio for use at events. In 2016 a News Department has again been started to improve coverage of community affairs. Current Programming Depending on the day of the week, KBBF offers between 9 and 18 hours per day of locally produced programming, all of it presented by volunteer programmers. Local programs consist of news and commentary, interviews, live coverage of events and music of all types, including Mexican folk music, salsa, Latin jazz, rock, world music and even classical music \\"with a Latin connection\\", among others. In addition, KBBF is affiliated with Radio Biling√ºe and transmits their news and commentary between 12:00 and 2:00 pm every weekday. Other syndicated programs include Bienvenidos a Am√©rica (information for immigrants), Undercurrents (contemporary music), and political commentary such as the Thom Hartmann show, Ring of Fire, Project Censored, and Democracy Now! both in English and in Spanish.

However, she sat as an independent until she was dismissed for failing to attend meetings. Brinsley Headstocks Brinsley used to be a major mining village. The only remainder of this heritage are the headstocks. They are not only of significance for the area but are also the only headstocks left of this kind. After the final closure of Brinsley Pit they had been moved to a museum but have recently been restored and brought back to near their original place. The Friends of Brinsley Headstocks have worked on turning the area into a nature reserve. There are several farms in the area that have gone organic. The countryside is often explored by leisure walkers with walks organised by D.H. Lawrence Heritage. Brinsley Carnival Originated in the early 1900s as a hospital parade, where local farmers and growers would dress their carts, and sell produce to raise money to send the sick and injured in Brinsley to hospital. The Carnival evolved into a family day out, fete or gala over many years, with enforced gaps over the two world wars. It was restarted in 1960 by George Mills of Broad Lane in Brinsley, the local postmaster, and has continued to this day. Brinsley Carnival is traditionally held on Fathers day, at the recreation ground in Brinsley. It is organised by a group of volunteers who raise money at the carnival and throughout the year to finance the following years carnival and give away money to local good causes. For over 50 years Brinsley Carnivalhttp://www.brinsleycarnival.com has offered a day's entertainment for families from the village and surrounding areas. But it has also given thousands of pounds to local causes. It is an event organised by the community, for the community. For some local organisations it provides their annual opportunity to raise awareness about their activities and to provide a welcome boost to their funds.

The information was passed on to the Central Intelligence Agency, who exploited it by secretly preparing sabotaged \\"intelligence\\" for Soviet spies to collect. After the Soviet's incorporated the flawed industrial technology, it caused numerous technical failures in the USSR including a massive oil pipeline explosion which damaged the economy. UK counterespionage failures A group of Soviet sympathizers, in respected positions in British society, formed the Cambridge Five, sometimes called the Cambridge Four, and it has never been established how many active agents were involved. Of these, the most devastating was Kim Philby. Other confirmed members included Donald Duart Maclean, Guy Burgess, and Anthony Blunt. See Cambridge Five for other suspects. Kim Philby was an effective Soviet agent while in the British counterintelligence service, warning the Soviets of countersurveillance, while casting suspicion on loyal officers. Philby came under suspicion but was able to escape to the USSR. Philby even was, at one time, considered as a possible head of MI5. He was able to protect numerous Soviet operations in Britain. British intelligence also suffered from internal suspicion that may or may not have been directed at the right targets, but caused suspicion to be thrown at the highest counter-intelligence officers, with severe effects on morale. Peter Wright, while later extremely controversial about revelations his 1987 book, Spycatcher: The Candid Autobiography of a Senior Intelligence Officer, also developed techniques that allowed the UK to track numerous Soviet clandestine agents, and agents under diplomatic cover . =Kim Philby= US counterespionage failures James Jesus Angleton, the legendary CIA director of counterespionage and a poet himself, used T. S. Eliot's term \\"an infinity of mirrors\\" to describe the intricacies of agent to double agent to triple agent so common in counterespionage, with works describing him as paranoid, while others described him as brilliant. Perhaps the truth may only emerge with the novelist's pen. It is clear that searches for foreign penetration, whether present or not, came close to paralyzing US intelligence. =Philip Agee= =Aldrich Ames= On February 24, 1994, the agency was rocked by the arrest of 31-year veteran case officer Aldrich Ames on charges of spying for the Soviet Union since 1985. =Robert Hanssen= =Edward Lee Howard= =William Hamilton Martin and Bernon Mitchell= These two cryptologists working for the National Security Agency disappeared in September 1960 and then re-appeared as defectors at a news conference in Moscow. Francis Gary Powers speculated that they were responsible for the downing of the Lockheed U-2 he was piloting over the Soviet Union causing the 1960 U-2 incident. The analysis of the National Security Council, however, determined that the two were not recruited by the Soviets and that their defection was \\"impulsive.\\"Seattle Weekly: \\"The Worst Internal Scandal in NSA History Was Blamed on Cold War Defectors‚Äô Homosexuality,\\" July 17, 2007, accessed January 6, 2010 =William Kampiles= =David Henry Barnett= Denial and deception Analysis of foreign denial and deception (D&D;) activities is arguably among the most challenging of intelligence analytic disciplines. Throughout history, nations have sought advantage over rivals through the manipulation of valued information. Such manipulation spans a spectrum of activities from the simple act of keeping certain information exclusive or secret to sophisticated deceptions that seek to confuse or mislead an adversary‚Äôs collection, analytic, and decisionmaking process. This spectrum includes denial, in which information is used in a ‚Äúdefensive‚Äù way by keeping it both secret and hidden (where the information gains further advantage through exclusivity and obscurity), and deception, in which information is used in an ‚Äúoffensive‚Äù way to mislead or confuse an adversary and which can include the use of both truthful and overt as well as false information in such a way as to influence a rival nation‚Äôs perceptions. The discovery and uncovering of the first, and protection against the second, are ‚Äúthe two great purposes of intelligence One of the greatest bargains in espionage history was the Soviet purchase of the technical manual for the KH‚Äì11 reconnaissance satellite from former CIA employee (now convicted spy) William Kampiles for a paltry $3,000. As a result of this theft and other compromises, U.S. intelligence must assume as a matter of course that overhead imagery and other technical collection will be met by D&D; efforts.

Traditionally, book papers are off-white or low-white papers (easier to read), are opaque to minimise the show-through of text from one side of the page to the other, and are (usually) made to tighter caliper or thickness specifications, particularly for case-bound books. Typically, books papers are light-weight papers 60 to 90 g/m¬≤ and often specified by their caliper/substance ratios (volume basis). For example, a bulky 80 g/m¬≤ paper may have a caliper of 120 micrometres (0.12 mm) which would be Volume 15 (120√ó10/80), whereas a low bulk 80 g/m¬≤ may have a caliper of 88 micrometres, giving a volume 11. This volume basis then allows the calculation of a book's PPI (printed pages per inch), which is an important factor for the design of book jackets and the binding of the finished book. Different paper qualities can be used as book paper depending on the type of book. Machine-finished coated papers, woodfree uncoated papers, coated fine papers, and special fine papers are common paper grades.

The parish is in the Deverill Valley which carries the upper waters of the River Wylye. The six villages of the valley - Kingston Deverill, Monkton Deverill, Brixton, Hill Deverill, Longbridge Deverill and Crockerton - are known as the Deverills. Brixton Deverill appears in the Domesday Book. Local government The parish elects a joint parish council with neighbouring Kingston Deverill. The combined council is Upper Deverills Parish Council. Brixton Deverill falls within the area of the Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions. Church The Anglican Church of St Michael the Archangel dates from the 13th century and has a 15th-century tower; restoration was carried out in 1730 and 1862. The font from St Giles, Imber, was relocated here following the evacuation of that village in 1943. In 1968 the church was designated as Grade II* listed. Roman villa In April 2016 it was announced that the remains of a large Roman villa had been discovered in the village in February 2015. After excavations by archaeologists from Historic England and The Salisbury Museum, a mosaic floor was uncovered of a large Roman property, similar in size and structure to the great Roman villa at Chedworth, Gloucestershire. Surviving sections of walls, in height, have confirmed that the mosaic formed part of a grand villa, thought to have been three storeys in height, its grounds extending over in width and length. Dr David Roberts, archaeologist for Historic England, said: > This site has not been touched since its collapse 1400 years ago and, as > such, is of enormous importance. Without question, this is a hugely valuable > site in terms of research, with incredible potential. The discovery of such > an elaborate and extraordinarily well-preserved villa, undamaged by > agriculture for over 1500 years, is unparalleled in recent years. Overall, > the excellent preservation, large scale and complexity of this site present > a unique opportunity to understand Roman and post-Roman Britain. The site is now known as the Deverill Villa after the name of the 17th-century house owned by Luke Irwin, who made the discovery. Irwin, a Dublin-born designer who makes hand-made silk, wool and cashmere rugs, found the remains in 2015 while laying electricity cables beneath a stretch of ground to the rear of his property. A Roman stone coffin, suitable for a child, which was being used as a plant pot, was also discovered.

Lines of investigation include historical and philosophical inquiry as well as scientific inquiry within such fields as neurophysiology and psychology. Overview The term \\"rational mysticism\\" was in use at least as early as 1911 when it was the subject of an article by Henry W. Clark in the Harvard Theological Review. In a 1924 book, Rational Mysticism, theosophist William Kingsland correlated rational mysticism with scientific idealism. South African philosopher J. N. Findlay frequently used the term, developing the theme in Ascent to the Absolute and other works in the 1960s and 1970s. Columbia University pragmatist John Herman Randall, Jr. characterized both Plotinus and Baruch Spinoza as ‚Äúrationalists with overtones of rational mysticism‚Äù in his 1970 book Hellenistic Ways of Deliverance and the Making of Christian Synthesis. Rice University professor of religious studies Jeffrey J. Kripal, in his 2001 book Roads of Excess, Palaces of Wisdom, defined rational mysticism as ‚Äúnot a contradiction in terms‚Äù but ‚Äúa mysticism whose limits are set by reason.‚Äù In response to criticism of his book The End of Faith, author Sam Harris used the term rational mysticism for the title of his rebuttal.

LGBT movements in general Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) social movements is a political ideology and social movement that advocate for the full acceptance of LGBT people in society. In these movements, LGBT people and their allies have a long history of campaigning for what is now generally called LGBT rights, sometimes also called gay rights or gay and lesbian rights. Although there is not a primary or an overarching central organization that represents all LGBT people and their interests, numerous LGBT rights organizations are active worldwide. A commonly stated goal among these movements is social equality for LGBT people. Some have also focused on building LGBT communities or worked towards liberation for the broader society from biphobia, homophobia, and transphobia.Rich, Adrienne. Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence. London: Onlywomen, 1981. Print. LGBT movements organized today are made up of a wide range of political activism and cultural activity, including lobbying, street marches, social groups, media, art, and research. Not only does the LGBT community strive for their rights, they celebrate as well. In multiple cities around the United States, a series of events usually over the course of one weekend, are carried out and known widely as Pride. In addition to expressing LGBT rights, the annual event has a goal to show that the community is proud of who they are, and will continue to push forward in their fight for rights. Sociologist Mary Bernstein writes: \\"For the lesbian and gay movement, then, cultural goals include (but are not limited to) challenging dominant constructions of masculinity and femininity, homophobia, and the primacy of the gendered heterosexual nuclear family (heteronormativity). Political goals include changing laws and policies in order to gain new rights, benefits, and protections from harm.\\"Bernstein, Mary (2002). Identities and Politics: Toward a Historical Understanding of the Lesbian and Gay Movement. Social Science History 26:3 (fall 2002). Bernstein emphasizes that activists seek both types of goals in both the civil and political spheres. As with other social movements there is also conflict within and between LGBT movements, especially about strategies for change and debates over exactly who comprises the constituency that these movements represent. There is debate over to what extent lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgender people, intersex people and others share common interests and a need to work together. Leaders of the lesbian and gay movement of the 1970s, 80s and 90s often attempted to hide masculine lesbians, feminine gay men, transgender people, and bisexuals from the public eye, creating internal divisions within LGBT communities.Bull, C., and J. Gallagher (1996) Perfect Enemies: The Religious Right, the Gay Movement, and the Politics of the 1990s. New York: Crown. LGBT movements have often adopted a kind of identity politics that sees gay, bisexual and/or transgender people as a fixed class of people; a minority group or groups. Those using this approach aspire to liberal political goals of freedom and equal opportunity, and aim to join the political mainstream on the same level as other groups in society.One example of this approach is: Sullivan, Andrew. (1997) Same-Sex Marriage: Pro and Con. New York: Vintage. In arguing that sexual orientation and gender identity are innate and cannot be consciously changed, attempts to change gay, lesbian and bisexual people into heterosexuals (\\"conversion therapy\\") are generally opposed by the LGBT community. Such attempts are often based in religious beliefs that perceive gay, lesbian and bisexual activity as immoral. However, others within LGBT movements have criticised identity politics as limited and flawed, elements of the queer movement have argued that the categories of gay and lesbian are restrictive, and attempted to deconstruct those categories, which are seen to \\"reinforce rather than challenge a cultural system that will always mark the nonheterosexual as inferior.\\"Bernstein (2002) Daughters of Bilitis The Daughters of Bilitis , also called the DOB or the Daughters, were formed in San Francisco, California in 1955 by four lesbian couples, including Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin. Martin and Lyon also have the distinction of being the first legally married gay couple in the U.S. at the start of the historic San Francisco 2004 same-sex weddings. Their marriage was voided 6 months later by the California Supreme Court. The Daughters of Bilitis (DOB), was the first lesbian civil and political rights organization in the United States.\\"Daughters of Bilitis (DOB).\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, n.d. Web. 10 Dec. 2016. The organization, formed in San Francisco in 1955, was conceived as a social alternative to lesbian bars, which were subject to raids and police harassment. As the DOB gained members, their focus shifted to providing support to women who were afraid to come out. The DOB followed the model of the homophile movement as developed by the Mattachine Society by encouraging its members to assimilate as much as possible into the prevailing heterosexual culture. The DOB advertised itself as \\"A Woman's Organization for the purpose of Promoting the Integration of the Homosexual into Society.\\" When the club realized they weren't allowed to advertise their meetings in the newspaper, Lyon and Martin began to print the group's newsletter, The Ladder, in October 1956. It became the first nationally distributed lesbian publication in the U.S. and was distributed to a closely guarded list of subscribers, due to rational fear of exposing. Barbara Gittings was editor for The Ladder from 1963 to 1968 when she passed her editorship to Barbara Grier, who greatly expanded it until the publication met its end in 1972 due to lack of funding. By 1959 there were chapters of the DOB in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Rhode Island along with the original chapter in San Francisco. The group also held conferences every two years from 1960 to 1968. As a national organization, the DOB folded in 1970, although some local chapters still continue. During its fourteen years, DOB became a tool of education for lesbians, gay men, researchers, and mental health professionals.\\"FoundSF.\\" Daughters of Bilitis - FoundSF. N.p., n.d. Web. 10 Dec. 2016. Mattachine Society The Mattachine Society, founded in 1950, was one of the earliest homophile/homosexual organizations in the United States, probably second only to Chicago's Society for Human Rights (1924).\\"FoundSF.\\" Mattachine: Radical Roots of the Gay Movement - FoundSF. N.p., n.d. Web. 10 Dec. 2016. Harry Hay and a group of Los Angeles male friends formed the group to protect and improve the rights of homosexuals. Because of concerns for secrecy and the founders' leftist ideology, they adopted the cell organization being used by the Communist Party of the United States. In the anti-Communist atmosphere of the 1950s, the Society's growing membership replaced the group's early Communist model with a more traditional ameliorative civil-rights leadership style and agenda. Then, as branches formed in other cities, the Society splintered in regional groups by 1961. Formed in Los Angeles in 1950 as the International Bachelors Fraternal Order for Peace and Social Dignity, by William Dale Jennings, along with his companions, it rapidly began to influence gay surroundings. The Mattachine founders attempted to use their personal experience as gay men to redefine the meaning of gay people and their culture in the United States, along with intervening in social life in general.It later adopted the name The Mattachine Society in reference to the society Mattachine, a French medieval masque group that supposedly traveled broadly using entertainment to point out social injustice. The name symbolized the fact that gays were a masked people, who lived in anonymity and underprivileged. The society began sponsoring discussion groups in 1951, which provided lesbian and gay men an ability to openly share feelings and experiences, also fear and internal disagreements. For many, this was the first and unique opportunity to do so, and such meetings were often highly emotional affairs. Attendance at the Mattachine Society meetings dramatically increased in short time, and such discussion groups spread throughout the United States, even beginning to sponsor social events, write newsletters and publications, and hold fundraisers. Society's Statement of Missions and Purpose from 1951 stands out today in the history of the gay liberation movement by identifying two important themes. First, it called for a grassroots movement of gay people to challenge anti-gay discrimination, and second, it recognized the importance of building a gay community. The society was forced to endure heavy pressure and public scrutiny during the anti-communist McCarthyism period, due to the communist leanings of some of the Society's members. In a column of the Los Angeles newspaper in March 1953 in regards to the Society, it was called a \\"strange new pressure group\\" of \\"sexual deviants\\" and \\"security risks\\" who were banding together to wield \\"tremendous political power.\\" This article generated a dramatic change that in the end, a strong coalition of conservative delegates challenged the societies goals, achievements and instruments. Leadership was demotivated to pursue further activities, the original founders resigned in 1953, and the organization was turned over to the conservative elements who brought in new elements of advocacy and group composition. Some modifications had to be done and advocating took the approach of accommodation rather than mobilizing gay people. They sought the support of the psychiatric profession who they believed held the key to reform. This, however, had a devastating effect as discussion group attendance declined and many local chapters folded. The national structure was dissolved in 1961, with few chapters lasting a few more years. Organisation's name was unique and not associated or affiliated with other movements that adopted this original symbolic name. Some of those unrelated groups are: Chicago's Mattachine Midwest, Gay Liberation Front, and Gay Activists Alliance, some of them arisen after the Stonewall Rebellion in 1969. Social and academic atmosphere for rising gay movements Success of the early informal homosexual student groups, along with the inspiration provided by other college-based movements and the Stonewall riots, led to the proliferation of Gay Liberation Fronts on campuses across the country by the early 1970s. These initial LGBT student movements handed out gay rights literature, organized social events, and sponsored lectures about the gay experience. Through their efforts, the campus climate for LGBT people improved. Also, by gaining institutional recognition and establishing a place on campus for GLBTQ students, the groundwork was laid for the creation of LGBT groups at colleges and universities throughout the country and generation of wider acceptance and tolerance.\\"A Brief History of the Gay Liberation Front, 1970-73.\\" Libcom.org. N.p., n.d. Web. 10 Dec. 2016. At many colleges and universities, these organizations were male-dominated, prompting lesbians to demand greater inclusion and often to form their own groups. During the 1980s, high school and junior high school students began to organize Gay-Straight Alliances, enabling even younger LGBT people to find support and better advocate for their needs. An LGBT American flag in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Student Homophile League was the first student gay rights organization in the United States, established at Columbia University in 1967 by Stephen Donaldson, who was a former member of the Mattachine Society. Student Homophile League branches were chartered at Cornell University and New York University in 1968 and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1969. This led to the formation of two non-affiliated groups, the Homosexuals Intransigent at the City University of New York and FREE (Fight Repression of Erotic Expression) at the University of Minnesota in 1969, now the Queer Student Cultural Center. On the West Coast, a Student Homophile League also was founded at Stanford University, likewise with encouragement from Donaldson, who had announced his hopes for the formation of a Stanford chapter in May 1967 in The New York Times. The Student Homophile League of Stanford University, led by Wendell Anderson (pseudonym), was registered with the Office of the Dean of Students as a recognized voluntary student organization through spring quarter 1968. The organization ceased to exist the following academic year. = Arizona = The University of Arizona's LGBT student group, \\"Pride Alliance,\\" has been active since the 1990s in providing visibility to LGBT students and faculty at the University. Some of the students' activism also works to provide a safe and welcoming environment for LGBT students. This goal stems from studies showing that LGBT college students have higher levels of depression, bullying, and suicide. Campus-wide activism at the University of Arizona and other colleges has focused on dealing with these issues regarding respect for the LGBT community.Oswalt, Sara, and Tammy Wyatt. \\"Sexual Orientation and Differences in Mental Health, Stress, and Academic Performance in a National Sample of U.S. College Students.\\" Journal of Homosexuality. 58.9 (2011): 1255-1280. JSTOR. Web. 20 Mar. 2012 = Florida = A renewed interest in LGBT rights brought about the formation of the Florida Collegiate Pride Coalition in 2003. This forum of LGBT college and university students in Florida is known to work with Equality Florida. = Pennsylvania = In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, The Pennsylvania Student Equality Coalition was founded as an independent and youth-led statewide LGBT organization by Pennsylvania students in April 2011. As of 2012, PSEC is connected with over 70 student LGBT organizations across Pennsylvania. The coalition is focused on campus-community organizing for LGBT equality in Pennsylvania and resource development for educational institutions. Gay liberation fronts Demonstration, with Gay Liberation Front Banner Although the pre-Stonewall student Homophile Leagues were most heavily influenced by the Mattachine Society, the Post Stonewall student organizations were more likely to be inspired and named after the more militant Gay Liberation Front or (GLF). It was formed in New York City in summer of 1969, and in Los Angeles by activist Morris Kight the same year. GLF-like campus groups held sponsored social activities, educational programs, and provided support to individual members much like the earlier college groups. However, activists in the GLF- type groups generally were much more visible and more politically oriented than the pre-stonewall gay student groups. These new activists were often committed to radical social change, and preferred confrontational tactics such as demonstrations, sit-ins, and direct challenges to discriminatory campus policies. This new defiant philosophy and approach was influenced by other militant campus movements such as Black Power, anti-Vietnam war groups, and student free speech movements. Many GLF members were involved with other militant groups such as these, and saw gay rights as part of a larger movement to transform society; their own liberation was fundamentally tied to the liberation of all peoples. =Lesbian feminist groups= Despite the fact that most of these early groups stated themselves to support women's liberation, many of the gay student groups were dominated by men. In fact, activities were more aimed at the needs of gay men, even to the point of exclusion to the needs of lesbians and bisexual women. This extended to frequently directing attention to campus harassment of gay men while ignoring the concerns and needs of gay women. Gay women were frequently turned off by the focus on male cruising at many of these events, and as a result, lesbians and bisexual women on some campuses began to hold their own dances and social activities. As gay began to increasingly refer only to gay men in the 1970s, many lesbians sought to have the names of gay student organizations changed to include them explicitly, or formed their own groups. They saw a need to organize around their oppression as women as well as lesbians, since they knew they could never have an equal voice in groups where men held the political power. LPAC is a Super PAC founded in 2012 to represent the interests of lesbians in the United States, and to campaign on LGBT and women's rights issues. Its supporters include Billie Jean King, Jane Lynch, Laura Ricketts and Urvashi Vaid. On its first day of operations, LPAC raised $200,000. =Gay Liberation Front= The Activist GLF advocated for sexual liberation for all people; they believed heterosexuality was a remnant of cultural inhibition and felt that change would not come about unless the current social institutions were dismantled and rebuilt without defined sexual roles. To do this, the GLF was intent on transforming the idea of the biological family and clan and making it more akin to a loose affiliation of members without biological subtexts. Prominent members of the GLF also opposed and addressed other social inequalities between the years of 1969 to 1972 such as militarism, racism, and sexism, but because of internal rivalries the GLF officially ended its operations in 1972. Police raid on the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in Greenwich Village in New York City in June 1969, generated an unprecedented riot among the patrons. This event served as a catalyst for the emergence of a new breed of gay militant activists quite unlike the more conventional organizations of the past two decades, and became known as gay liberation. Within weeks of the Stonewall event, gay and lesbian activists organized the Gay Liberation Front. GLF was shaped in part by the Students for a Democratic Society, a radical student organization of the times. Allen Young, a former SDS activist, was key in framing GLF's principles. He asserted that \\"the artificial categories of 'heterosexual' and 'homosexual' have been laid on us by a sexist society, as gays, we demand an end to the gender programming which starts when we are born, the family, is the primary means by which this restricted sexuality is created and enforced, Our understanding of sexism is premised on the idea that in a few society everyone will be gay.\\" The GLF's statement of purpose clearly stated: \\"We are a revolutionary group of men and women formed with the realization that complete sexual liberation for all people cannot come about unless existing social institutions are abolished. We reject society's attempt to impose sexual roles and definitions of our nature.\\" GLF groups rapidly spread throughout the United States and other countries. Members did not limit activism to gay causes. In late 1960s and early 1970s, many homosexuals joined protests with other radical groups such as the Black Panthers, women's liberationists and anti-war activists. Lesbians brought the principles of radical feminism on the emerging new philosophy, and GLF activists argued that the institution of heterosexual families necessitated the oppression of homosexuals, allowing them to define their gayness as a form of political resistance. GLF activist Martha Shelley wrote, \\"We are women and men who, from the time of our earliest memories, have been in revolt against the sex role structure and nuclear family structure.\\" Though the GLF effectively ceased to exist in 1972, unable to successfully negotiate the differences among its members, its activists remained committed to working on political issues and the issue of homosexuality itself. GLF's legacy informed gay and lesbian activism throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s when groups such as ACT UP and Queer Nation formed to fight AIDS and homophobia. Many of the leaders of these two groups had been either active in or heavily influenced by the ideas first promoted by GLF. Even though many activists became disenchanted with the organization, their determination to carry forth the spirit of gay liberation through new groups such as the Gay Activists Alliance and the Radicalesbians proved invaluable in the continuing fight for GLBTQ rights. Significance of ONE, Incorporated ONE, Inc. had a tremendous impact on vision and mission of socially active gay people in early phases of movement. It was started by William Dale Jennings joined with likeminded colleagues Don Slater, Dorr Legg, Tony Reyes, and Mattachine Society founder Harry Hay. It formed the public part of the early homophile movement, with a public office, administrative infrastructure, logistics, a telephone, and the first publication that reached the general public, ONE Magazine, a huge leap of gay movement. The Los Angeles Postmaster seized and refused to mail copies of ONE Magazine in 1954 on grounds that it was \\"obscene, lewd, lascivious and filthy.\\" This action led to prolonged court battles which had significant influence on gay and lesbian movements. In 1958, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled unanimously in One, Inc. v. Olesen that the mere discussion of homosexuality was not obscene, and the magazine continued to be published and distributed until 1972. Along with its continuing growth a part of ONE became the Homosexual Information Center, formed by Don Slater, Billy Glover, Joe and Jane Hansen, Tony Reyes, Jim Schneider, et al. Part of ONE's archives are at the University of Southern California and part are at California State University, Northridge. The funding part of ONE still exists as the Institute for the Study of Human Resources, which controls the name ONE, Inc. Websites for parts of ONE and HIC are: HIC One Archives Affirmation: Gay & Lesbian Mormons This is an international organization for gay, lesbian, transgender, bisexual, and intersex people who identify as members or ex-members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Although a core belief is that \\"homosexuality and homosexual relationships can be consistent with and supported by the Gospel of Jesus Christ,\\"Affirmation: Gay and Lesbian Mormons: General Charter it is not in fact supported by the doctrine in this religion. Under the name Affirmation: Gay Mormons United, the first Affirmation group was organized in Salt Lake City, Utah on June 11, 1977 by Stephan Zakharias and a group of other Mormon and ex-Mormons Gays and Lesbians. The original group struggled to survive until 1978, when Paul Mortensen formed the Los Angeles chapter and in 1980 the name was changed to Affirmation:Gay & Lesbian Mormons. Through the influence of the Los Angeles chapter, Affirmation groups appeared in many cities around the country.In The Beginning: A Brief History of Affirmation In 1985, some members of Affirmation formed a Latter Day Saint church for gays and lesbians known as the Restoration Church of Jesus Christ.  Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders (GLAD)  GLAD is a non-profit legal rights organization in the United States. The organization works to end discrimination based on sexual orientation, HIV status, and gender identity and expression. John Ward founded GLAD in 1978 and filed its first case, Doe v. McNiff, that same year. An early victory came in Fricke v. Lynch (1980), in which GLAD represented Aaron Fricke, an 18-year-old student at Cumberland High School in Rhode Island, who won the right to bring a same-sex date to a high school dance. GLAD is based in Boston, Massachusetts, and serves the New England area of the United States. Services it provides include litigation, advocacy, and educational work in all areas of LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) civil rights and the rights of people living with HIV. The organization also operates a telephone hotline and website. In 2003, GLAD received national attention for its work in winning marriage rights for same-sex couples in Massachusetts. In Goodridge v. Department of Public Health, it successfully argued before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court that to restrict marriage to heterosexual couples was a violation of the state constitution.Mary L. Bonauto, \\"Goodridge in Context\\", in Harvard Civil Rights- Civil Liberties Law Review, vol. 40, 1-69, [available online], accessed April 15, 2014 In October 2008, GLAD won marriage rights for same-sex couples in Connecticut with a decision of the Supreme Court of Connecticut in Kerrigan v. Commissioner of Public Health.  GLAAD  Wanda Sykes 2010 GLAAD Media Awards GLAAD (formerly the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) is a U.S. non- governmental media monitoring organization which promotes the image of LGBT people in the media. Before March 2013, the name \\"GLAAD\\" had been an acronym for \\"Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation,\\" but became the primary name due to its inclusiveness of bisexual and transgender issues. Its stated mission, in part, is to \\"[amplify] the voice of the LGBT community by empowering real people to share their stories, holding the media accountable for the words and images they present, and helping grassroots organizations communicate effectively.\\" Formed in New York City in 1985 to protest against what it saw as the New York Post's defamatory and sensationalized AIDS coverage, GLAAD put pressure on media organizations to end what it saw as homophobic reporting. Initial meetings were held in the homes of several New York City activists as well as after-hours at the New York State Council on the Arts. The founding group included film scholar Vito Russo; Gregory Kolovakos, then on the staff of the NYS Arts Council and who later became the first executive director; Darryl Yates Rist; Allen Barnett; and Jewelle Gomez, the organization's first treasurer. Some members of GLAAD went on to become the early members of ACT UP. In 1987, after a meeting with GLAAD, The New York Times changed its editorial policy to use the word gay instead of harsher terms referring to homosexuality. GLAAD advocated that the Associated Press and other television and print news sources follow. GLAAD's influence soon spread to Los Angeles, where organizers began working with the entertainment industry to change the way LGBT people were portrayed on screen. Entertainment Weekly has named GLAAD as one of Hollywood's most powerful entities, and the Los Angeles Times described GLAAD as \\"possibly one of the most successful organizations lobbying the media for inclusion.\\"Myers and Cress 2004: 200 Within the first five years of its founding in New York as the Gay and Lesbian Anti-Defamation League (soon after changed to \\"Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation\\" after legal pressure by the Anti-Defamation League), GLAAD chapters had been established in Los Angeles and other cities, with the LA chapter becoming particularly influential due to its proximity to the California entertainment industry. GLAAD/NY and GLAAD/LA would eventually vote to merge in 1994, with other city chapters joining soon afterward; however, the chapters continue to exist, with the ceremonies of the GLAAD Media Awards being divided each year into three ceremonies held in New York City, Los Angeles and San Francisco. New generation activism embodied in Queer Nation Queer Nation logo On March 20, 1990, sixty LGBTQ people gathered at the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Community Services Center in New York's Greenwich Village to create a direct action organization. The goal of the unnamed organization was the elimination of homophobia, and the increase of gay, lesbian and bisexual visibility through a variety of tactics. The group's breakthrough was at New York's Gay Pride parade when militant AIDS activists passed out to the assembled crowd an inflammatory manifesto, bearing the titles I Hate Straights! and Queers Read This! Within days, in response to the brash, \\"in-your-face\\" tone of the broadside, Queer Nation chapters had sprung up in San Francisco and other major cities. The name Queer Nation had been used casually since the group's inception, until it was officially approved at the group's general meeting on May 17, 1990. Rather than denote a particular genre of sexual identity, \\"queer\\" came to represent any number of positions arrayed in opposition to oppressive social and cultural norms and policies related to sexuality and gender. Their political philosophy was succinctly summed up in the now-clich√©d slogan, \\"We're Here. We're Queer. Get Used to It.\\" Queer Nation relied on large and public meetings to set the agendas and plan the actions of its numerous committees (such as LABIA: Lesbians and Bisexuals in Action, and SHOP: Suburban Homosexual Outreach Project). Just as importantly, \\"queer\\" became an important concept both socially and intellectually, helping to broaden what had been primarily a gay and lesbian social movement into one that was more inclusive of bisexual and transgender people. Queer Nation's style drew on the urgency felt in the AIDS activist community about the mounting epidemic and the paucity of meaningful governmental response, and was inspired largely by the attention-grabbing direct-action tactics of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP). Described by activist scholars Allan B√©rub√© and Jeffrey Escoffier as the first \\"retro-future/postmodern\\" activist group to address gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender concerns, the short-lived organization made a lasting impact on sexual identity politics in the United States. The lived political necessity of understanding the nexus of gender and sexuality in this broadening social movement, in turn, helped launch the field of \\"queer studies\\" in higher education. History of the LGBTQ+ Movement in the United States Trans activist Miss Major, a participant in the 1969 Stonewall Riots, in Pride 2014 SF In the United States, what little information scholars have been able to recover about the political sensibilities of transgender people in the early 20th century indicates an acute awareness of their vulnerability to arrest, discrimination against them in housing and employment opportunities, and their difficulties in creating \\"bureaucratically coherent\\" legal identities due to a change of gender status. They generally experienced a sense of social isolation, and often expressed a desire to create a wider network of associations with other transgender people. In fact, there are quite a few arguments as to when the true beginning of the American Gay Rights Movement starts. The earliest date being claimed is that of 1924 in Chicago when the Society for Human Rights was founded to declare civil rights for gays.Gay Rights Movement in the United States. Dudley Clendinen.2008. Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia.3 March 2009 However, it is also argued that the beginning of the Gay Rights Movement, LGBT Movement in the United States, after years of being highly controlled and hidden, successfully began in the 1940s in Los Angeles. One of the initial or founding organizations was the Mattachine Society.When Did the Gay Rights Movement Begin?. Vern Bullough. April 18, 2005. History New Network, George Mason University.3 March 2009 A secretive society which later began to be associated with Communist values, the society became involved in politics and made its first appearance by supporting Henry Wall and the Progressive Party during the presidential election of 1948. The Mattachine Society was led by Harry Hay and began to slowly gain national attention and membership. Some historians also mark the beginning of the movement as a 1965 gay march held in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia to protest the dismissal of homosexual federal employees. An even later occurrence that is also said to have been the beginning of the movement for Gay Rights was the Stonewall Riots, Stonewall Inn of 1969. On June 27, 1969 New York's Stonewall Inn bar was raided by police. Though this was a regular incident in gay bars like Stonewall, the reaction of its patrons, as they refused to leave and clashed with the raiding police officers, ultimately led to street riots. This event gave way to mass media attention on the issues facing the LGBT community and therefore increased public awareness, making it possible to have an influential movement.Paul S. Boyer. \\"Gay and Lesbian Rights Movement. The Oxford Companion to United States History. Oxford University Press. 2001. Encyclopedia.com. 4 March 2009 Some offer a less specific time for the beginning of the movement and argue that it was during the wake of World War II that the movement to protect gay and lesbian civil rights emerged. Men and women who participated in the military's homosexual world began to realize that it was a part of their identity. As they moved back to the cities they began to live their new lifestyle openly and in great numbers only to be severely oppressed by the police and the government. Scholars do not pinpoint a mutual and clearly defined beginning of gay rights activism in the U.S and as said before this may be to their unfortunate political and social positions. Though there is much confusion as to the beginning of the movement, there are clearly defined phases throughout the movement for gay rights in the U.S. The first phase of the movement being the homophile phase, which mainly consisted of the activities of the Mattachine Society, the ONE, ONE Inc. publication, and The Daughters of Bilitis. The homophile movement, which stresses love as opposed to sexuality, focused on protesting political systems for social acceptability. Any demonstrations held by homophile organizations were orderly and polite, but these demonstrations had little impact for they were ignored by the media.'Gay Rights Movement in the United States. Dudley Clendinen.2008. Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia.3 March 2009 In 1969 the second phase of the movement, gay liberation, began. During this phase, the number of homophile organizations increased rapidly, as many of the LGBT community became inspired by the various cultural movements occurring during the time period, such as the anti- Vietnam War movement or the Black Power movement. Activism during this phase encouraged \\"gay power\\" and encouraged homosexuals to \\"come out of the closet,\\" so as to publicly display their pride in who they are. They were also more forceful about resisting anti-homosexuality sanctions than activists from the previous phase, participating in marches, riots, and sit-ins. These radicals of the 1970s would later call the previous homophile groups assimilationist for their less vigorous methods. Also during this phase there was an increase in lesbian centered organizations within the movement. Opposition =Inconvenient public opinions= LGBT movements are opposed by a variety of individuals and organizations.Strauss, Lehman, Litt.D., F.R.G.S. \\"Homosexuality: The Christian Perspective\\".\\"Roman Catholics and Homosexuality\\", Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance (2006)\\"Teaching about Procreation and Chastity: Homosexuality\\", The Church of Jesus-Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Jewish Law Commentary: Examining Halacha, Jewish Issues, and Secular Law.\\"Islam and Homosexuality\\", Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance (2005). They may have a personal, moral, political or religious objection to gay rights, homosexual relations or gay people. Opponents say same-sex relationships are not marriages, that legalization of same-sex marriage will open the door for the legalization of polygamy, that it is unnatural and that it encourages unhealthy behavior. Some social conservatives believe that all sexual relationships with people other than an opposite-sex spouse undermines the traditional family\\"First Presidency Message on Same- Gender Marriage\\", 20 October 2004. and that children should be reared in homes with both a father and a mother.\\"The Family: A Proclamation to the World\\", churchofjesuschrist.org Since society has become more accepting of homosexuality, there has been the emergence of many groups that desire to end homosexuality; during the 1990s, one of the best known groups that was established with this goal is the ex-gay movement. Some people worry that gay rights may conflict with individuals' freedom of speech, religious freedoms in the workplace, and the ability to run churches, charitable organizations and other religious organizations that hold opposing social and cultural views to LGBT rights. There is also concern that religious organizations might be forced to accept and perform same-sex marriages or risk losing their tax- exempt status. Eric Rofes author of the book, A Radical Rethinking of Sexuality and Schooling: Status Quo or Status Queer?, argues that the inclusion of teachings on homosexuality in public schools will play an important role in transforming public ideas about lesbian and gay individuals.Rofes, Eric E. \\"Chapter 2: Candy from Strangers: Queer Teachers and the (Im)Moral Development of Children.\\" A Radical Rethinking of Sexuality and Schooling: Status Quo or Status Queer. Ed. Eric E. Rofes. Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield, 2005. 15‚Äì37. Print. As a former teacher in the public school system, Rofes recounts how he was fired from his teaching position after making the decision to come out as gay. As a result of the stigma that he faced as a gay teacher he emphasizes the necessity of the public to take radical approaches to making significant changes in public attitudes about homosexuality. According to Rofes, radical approaches are grounded in the belief that \\"something fundamental needs to be transformed for authentic and sweeping changes to occur.\\"The radical approaches proposed by Rofes have been met with strong opposition from anti-gay rights activists such as John Briggs. Former California senator, John Briggs proposed Proposition 6, a ballot initiative that would require that all California state public schools fire any gay or lesbian teachers or counselors, along with any faculty that displayed support for gay rights in an effort to prevent what he believe to be \\" the corruption of the children's minds\\".Fetner, Tina. 2008. How the Religious Rights Shaped Lesbian and Gay Activism. University of Minnesota Press. The exclusion of homosexuality from the sexual education curriculum, in addition to the absence of sexual counseling programs in public schools, has resulted in increased feelings of isolation and alienation for gay and lesbian students who desire to have gay counseling programs that will help them come to terms with their sexual orientation. Eric Rofes founder of youth homosexual programs, such as Out There and Committee for Gay Youth, stresses the importance of having support programs that help youth learn to identify with their sexual orientation. David Campos, author of the book, Sex, Youth, and Sex Education: A Reference Handbook, illuminates the argument proposed by proponents of sexual education programs in public schools. Many gay rights supporters argue that teachings about the diverse sexual orientations that exist outside of heterosexuality are pertinent to creating students that are well informed about the world around them. However, Campos also acknowledges that the sex education curriculum alone cannot teach youth about factors associated with sexual orientation but instead he suggests that schools implement policies that create safe school learning environments and foster support for gay and lesbian, bisexual, and transgender youth.Campos, David. Sex, Youth, and Sex Education: A Reference Handbook. Washington, D.C: Library of Congress Cataloging, 2002. Web. 9 Nov. 2009 . It is his belief that schools that provide unbiased, factual information about sexual orientation, along with supportive counseling programs for these homosexual youth will transform the way society treats homosexuality. Many opponents of LGBT social movements have attributed their indifference toward homosexuality as being a result of the immoral values that it may instill in children who are exposed to homosexual individuals. In opposition to this claim, many proponents of increased education about homosexuality suggest that educators should refrain from teaching about sexuality in schools entirely. In her book entitled \\"Gay and Lesbian Movement,\\" Margaret Cruickshank provides statistical data from the Harris and Yankelvoich polls which confirmed that over 80% of American adults believe that students should be educated about sexuality within their public school. In addition, the poll also found that 75% of parents believe that homosexuality and abortion should be included in the curriculum as well. An assessment conducted on California public school systems discovered that only 2% of all parents actually disproved of their child being taught about sexuality in school.Darder, Antoninia, Marta Baltodano, and Raldolfo Torres. The Critical Pedagogy Reader. New York, NY: Routledge Falmer, 2003. Web. 11 Nov. 2009 . It had been suggested that education has a positive impact on support for same sex marriage. African Americans statistically have lower rates of educational achievement, however, the education level of African Americans does not have as much significance on their attitude towards same- sex marriage as it does on white attitudes. Educational attainment among whites has a significant positive effect on support for same-sex marriage, whereas the direct effect of education among African Americans is less significant. The income levels of whites have a direct and positive correlation with support for same-sex marriage, but African American income level is not significantly associated with attitudes toward same-sex marriage.Sherkat, Darren E., Kylan M. Vries, and Stacia Creek. \\"Race, Religion, and Opposition to Same-Sex Marriage.\\" (2009): 1‚Äì35. Southern Illinois University Carbondale.Web. 10 Nov. 2009. . Location also affects ideas towards same-sex marriage; residents of rural and southern areas are significantly more opposed to same-sex marriage in comparison to residents elsewhere. Women are consistently more supportive than men of LGBT rights, and individuals that are divorced or have never married are also more likely to grant marital rights to same-sex couples than married or widowed individuals. Also, white women are significantly more supportive than white men, but there are no gender discrepancies among African Americans. The year in which one was born is a strong indicator of attitude towards same-sex marriage‚Äîgenerations born after 1946 are considerably more supportive of same-sex marriage than older generations. Statistics show that African Americans are more opposed to same-sex marriage than any other ethnicity. Studies show that Non-Protestants are much more likely to support same-sex unions than Protestants; 63% of African Americans claim that they are Baptist or Protestant, whereas only 30% of white Americans are. Religion, as measured by individuals' religious affiliations, behaviors, and beliefs, has a lot of influence in structuring same-sex union attitudes and consistently influences opinions about homosexuality. The most liberal attitudes are generally reflected by Jews, liberal Protestants, and people who are not affiliated with religion. This is because many of their religious traditions have not \\"systematically condemned homosexual behaviors\\" in recent years. Moderate and tolerant attitudes are generally reflected by Catholics and moderate Protestants. And lastly, the most conservative views are held by Evangelical Protestants. Moreover, it is a tendency for one to be less tolerant of homosexuality if their social network is strongly tied to a religious congregation. Organized religion, especially Protestant and Baptist affiliations, espouse conservative views which traditionally denounce same-sex unions. Therefore, these congregations are more likely to hear messages of this nature. Polls have also indicated that the amount and level of personal contact that individuals have with homosexual individuals and traditional morality affects attitudes of same-sex marriage and homosexuality.Olson, Laura R., Wendy Cadge, and James T. Harrison. \\"Religion and Public Opinion about Same-Sex Marriage.\\" Social Science Quarterly 2nd ser. 87 (2006): 341‚Äì60. Print. =Opposition throughout history= Though gay and lesbians struggled to go public with their efforts in the U.S, they still were met with opposition. Despite participating in very few public activities in the early 19th century, many gays and lesbians were targeted by police who kept list of the bars and restaurants that were known to cater to the population. Many were arrested for sodomy or hospitalized in mental facilities for homosexuality. They were also fired from many jobs for their lifestyles. States had many laws that made homosexuality a crime and the government would often support the states, as in the 1917 Immigration Act which denied homosexuals entry into the country.\\"BACKGROUND.\\" CQ Researcher 10.14 (14 April 2000): 313. Academic Search Premier. EBSCO. 4 Mar. 2009 Homosexual organizations were disrupted as they were said to be breaking disorderly conduct laws, and gay bars and business had their licenses illegitimately suspended or revoked. This persecution seemed to only intensify after World War II, because many gays and lesbians were living more openly. Thousands of federal employees including soldiers were discharged and fired for suspicions of being homosexuals. Though since that time, there has been more activism by the LGBT Community, through an increasing number of organizations coupled with more visibility and aggressive protest. However, many rights are withheld today even after same-sex marriage is approved nationwide in the US on 26 Jun 2016 . Nevertheless, activists of the modern Gay Rights Movement still struggle to seek full equality. Identity politics The term identity politics has been applied retroactively to varying movements that long predate its coinage. Historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. discussed identity politics extensively in his book The Disuniting of America. Schlesinger, a strong supporter of liberal conceptions of civil rights, argues that a liberal democracy requires a common basis for culture and society to function. The most important and revolutionary element of identity politics is the demand that oppressed groups be recognized not in spite of their differences but specifically because of their differences. The earlier stages of the development of the modern gay movement were closely linked with identity politics. In order for gay and lesbian issues to be placed on the political agenda, gays and lesbians had to identify publicly with their homosexuality and 'come out'. Advocates of identity politics believe in self-determination on the part of oppressed groups. Proponents of identity politics argue that those who do not share the life experiences that it brings to members of an oppressed group cannot understand what it means to be a person with that identity. Not limited to activity in the traditionally conceived political sphere, identity politics refers to activism, politics, theorizing, and other similar activities based on the shared experiences of members of a specific social group (often relying on shared experiences of oppression). The term identity politics and movements linked to it came into being during the latter part of the 20th century. It can most notably be found in class movements, feminist movements, gay and lesbian movements, disability movements, ethnic movements and post colonial movements. Identity politics is open to wide debate and critique. Minority influence is a central component of identity politics. Minority influence is a form of social influence which takes place when a majority is being influenced to accept the beliefs or behavior of a minority. Unlike other forms of influence this usually involves a personal shift in private opinion. This personal shift in opinion is called conversion. Groups who engage in identity politics take part in such activities as community organizing and consciousness-raising, as well as participating in political and social movements. Identity politics assumes that the shared identity and experiences of LGBTQ people is a rational basis for political action, notwithstanding the different (and sometimes competing) interests of individual members of the queer communities. Basic to this assumption is the idea that glbtq people constitute a legitimate political constituency deserving of equal rights and representation. Some critics have argued that groups based on shared identity, other than class (e.g.: religious identity or neurological wiring), can divert energy and attention from more fundamental issues, such as class conflict in capitalist societies. Even those who support gay rights, freedom of religion or ending racism, for instance, may consider these side issues at best. Those with multiple oppressed identities have sometimes responded by forming new, more specific identity politics groups. Liberal-reformist gay and lesbian activists continue to work for full acceptance of gays and lesbians in the institutions and culture of mainstream society, but queer activists instead make a point of declaring themselves outside of the mainstream and having no desire to be accepted by or join it. Identity politics has sometimes been criticized as narrow, even childish, and essentialist. Social critic bell hooks, for example, argues that identity is too narrow a basis for politics. However, as long as LGBTQ people are stigmatized and discriminated against on the basis of their sexual and gender identities, identity politics are likely to be seen as an appropriate response. By the 1980s, the politics of identity had become central to the gay movement's struggles. This opened the path for change but also critique. Some LGBT rights activists, along with queer theorists, came to criticize the identity politics approach to gay rights, particularly the approach based around the terms and concepts of queer theory. Other queer activists, drawing on the work of Judith Butler, stress the importance of not assuming an already existing identity, but of remaking and unmaking identities through performance. There are also conscientious supporters of identity politics who have developed their stances on the basis of Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's work, and have described some forms of identity politics as strategic essentialism, a form which has sought to work with hegemonic discourses to reform the understanding of \\"universal\\" goals. In a wider context, some critics counter that the intolerant homogeneity of mainstream culture is precisely the fact that makes full acceptance impossible and that social justice movements should aim toward not integration but rather multicultural pluralism, without recourse to the types of oppressive homogeneity now at play. (See the work of Urvashi Vaid for a discussion of the perils of homogeneity.) 1920s Speed Langworthy's sheet music poking fun at the tendency of women to adopt masculine traits during the 1920s The 1920s ushered in a new era of social acceptance of minorities and homosexuals, at least in heavily urbanized areas. This was reflected in many of the films (see Pre- Code) of the decade that openly made references to homosexuality. Even popular songs poked fun at the new social acceptance of homosexuality. One of these songs had the title \\"Masculine Women, Feminine Men.\\"The song was written by Edgar Leslie (words) and James V. Monaco (music) and featured in Hugh J. Ward's Musical Comedy \\"Lady Be Good.\\" It was released in 1926 and recorded by numerous artists of the day and included the following lyrics:Artists who recorded this song include: 1. Frank Harris (Irving Kaufman), (Columbia 569D,1/29/26) 2. Bill Meyerl & Gwen Farrar (UK, 1926) 3. Joy Boys (UK, 1926) 4. Harry Reser's Six Jumping Jacks (UK, 2/13/26) 5.

Until the early 1930s, gay clubs were openly operated, commonly known as \\"pansy clubs\\". The relative liberalism of the decade is demonstrated by the fact that the actor William Haines, regularly named in newspapers and magazines as the number-one male box-office draw, openly lived in a gay relationship with his lover, Jimmie Shields.Mann, William J., Wisecracker : the life and times of William Haines, Hollywood's first openly gay star. New York, N.Y., U.S.A. : Viking, 1998: 2-6. Other popular gay actors/actresses of the decade included Alla Nazimova and Ramon Novarro.Mann, William J., Wisecracker : the life and times of William Haines, Hollywood's first openly gay star. New York, N.Y., U.S.A. : Viking, 1998: 12-13, 80-83. In 1927, Mae West wrote a play about homosexuality called The Drag, and alluded to the work of Karl Heinrich Ulrichs. It was a box-office success. West regarded talking about sex as a basic human rights issue, and was also an early advocate of gay rights. Emma Goldman also spoke out in defense of gay rights during this time. With the return of conservatism in the 1930s, the public grew intolerant of homosexuality, and gay actors were forced to choose between retiring or agreeing to hide their sexuality. Early advocacy Transgender advocacy efforts did not begin to gain momentum, however, until the 1950s, in the wake of the unprecedented publicity given to Christine Jorgensen, whose 1952 \\"sex-change\\" operation made her an international celebrity and brought transgender issues to widespread attention. Louise Lawrence, a male-to-female transgender person who began living full-time as a woman in San Francisco in the 1940s, was a central figure of transgender community. She worked closely with Alfred Kinsey to bring the needs of transgender people to the attention of social scientists and sex reformers. In 1971, Lawrence released her first science fiction novel, Andra, about a futuristic society in which the ruler dominates the lives of the citizens of an underground city. The novel, a commentary on fascism, was labeled young adult, despite Lawrence's disagreement with the classification. The novel, which featured some adult content, was toned down and adapted into a short-lived Australian children's show in 1976. Lawrence's eighth novel, Children of the Dust, was published in 1985. The novel, about the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust, sparked controversy for its nightmarish vision of a future in which children are born with deformities and the government leaves the citizens to fend for themselves. It contains graphic violence, profane language, and descriptions of sexual activity, for which it was banned from many school libraries. Despite this, the novel has developed a cult following. Lawrence collaborated with Virginia Prince, who began cross-dressing in high school,Prince, Virginia. \\"My Accidental Career.\\" How I Got Into Sex. Eds. B. Bullough, V.L. Bullough, M.A. Fithian, W.E. Hartman and R.S Klein. Buffalo: Prometheus Books, 1997. who founded the first peer support and advocacy groups for male cross-dressers in the United States. In 1960, the first issue of Prince's magazine Transvestia was published (eight years after her first magazine, which lasted only two editions, but its importance is astounding). Prince acquired the means to fund the publication after assembling a list of 25 acquaintances, each of whom was willing to donate four dollars to her start-up. Working with one hundred dollars, Prince then launched her first issue, published by her own Chevalier Publications, and sold it by subscription and through adult bookstores. Transvestia was published bi- monthly between 1960 and 1980, with a total of 100 issues being created. In 1963, the inside jacket of the magazine stated the publication as \\"dedicated to the needs of the sexually normal individual who has discovered the of his or her 'other side' and seeks to express it.\\" Bisexual activism Bisexual activists at the 2009 National Equality March Bisexuals became more visible in the LGBT rights movement in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1966 bisexual activist Robert A. Martin (aka Donny the Punk) founded the Student Homophile League at Columbia University and New York University. In 1967 Columbia University officially recognized this group, thus making them the first college in the United States to officially recognize a gay student group. Activism on behalf of bisexuals in particular also began to grow, especially in San Francisco. One of the earliest organizations for bisexuals, the Sexual Freedom League in San Francisco, was facilitated by Margo Rila and Frank Esposito beginning in 1967. Two years later, during a staff meeting at a San Francisco mental health facility serving LGBT people, nurse Maggi Rubenstein came out as bisexual. Due to this, bisexuals began to be included in the facility's programs for the first time. Bisexual activist Brenda Howard is known as the \\"Mother of Pride\\" for her work in coordinating the first LGBT Pride march, which occurred in 1970 in New York City, and she also originated the idea for a week-long series of events around Pride Day which became the genesis of the annual LGBT Pride celebrations that are now held around the world every June.Channel 13/WNET Out! 2007: Women In the Movement The Gay Pride Issue: Picking Apart The Origin of Pride Additionally, Howard along with the bisexual activist Robert A. Martin (aka Donny the Punk) and gay activist L. Craig Schoonmaker are credited with popularizing the word \\"Pride\\" to describe these festivities.Dynes, Wayne R.

Bisexual Politics: Theories, Queries, & Visions. New York: Harrington Park Press. pp. 31‚Äì45. . Bisexual activist Tom Limoncelli later stated, \\"The next time someone asks you why LGBT Pride marches exist or why [LGBT] Pride Month is June tell them 'A bisexual woman named Brenda Howard thought it should be.'\\"In Memoriam ‚Äì Brenda Howard In 1972 a Quaker group, the Committee of Friends on Bisexuality, issued the \\"Ithaca Statement on Bisexuality\\" supporting bisexuals. In that same year the National Bisexual Liberation Group formed in New York. In 1976 the San Francisco Bisexual Center opened. Organisational upgrade in 1960s In the wake of the transgender street prostitutes riot in impoverished Tenderloin neighborhood at a popular all- night restaurant, Gene Compton's Cafeteria. in 1966, San Francisco transsexual activists worked with Harry Benjamin (the nation's leading medical expert on transsexuality), the Erickson Educational Foundation (established by Reed Erickson, who funded the development of a new model of medical service provision for transsexuals in the 1960s and 1970s), activist ministers at the progressive Glide Memorial Methodist Church, and a variety of city bureaucrats to establish a remarkable network of services and support for transsexuals, including city-funded health clinics that provided hormones and federally funded work training programs that helped prostitutes learn job skills to get off the streets and finally give them a significant chance to create a decent and worth-living life, without economic and professional insecurity. Transgender movement Transsexuals in San Francisco formed Transsexual Counseling Unit, which was located in office space rented by the War on Poverty. At first, they were organised as C.O.G. (Conversion Our Goal) in 1967. When funding from the War on Poverty programs ceased, The Erickson Educational Foundation funded a store front office located in San Francisco's Tenderloin on Turk St. There the Transsexual Counseling Service, with the assistance of the EEF as well as Lee Brewster's Queen Magazine expanded their services beyond the Bay Area by corresponding with transsexuals across the nation. To reflect this the TCS became the \\"National transsexual Counseling Unit. Reed Erickson was responsible for funding these programs and others which became the early transsexual movement through his foundation the Erickson Educational Foundation. By the later 1960s, some strands of transgender activism were closely linked to gay liberation. Most famously, transgender \\"street queens\\" played an instrumental role in sparking the riots at New York's Stonewall Inn in 1969, which are often considered a turning point in LGBT political activism. New York transsexual activist Judy Bowen organized two other short-lived groups, TAT (Transsexuals and Transvestites) in 1970, and Transsexuals Anonymous in 1971, but neither had lasting influence. Far more significant was Mario Martino's creation of the Labyrinth Foundation Counseling Service in the late 1960s in New York, the first transgender community-based organization that specifically addressed the needs of female-to-male transsexuals. Sylvia Rivera, a transgender veteran of the Stonewall Riots, was an early member of the Gay Liberation Front and Gay Activists Alliance in New York. Along with her sister-in-arms Marsha P. (for \\"Pay It No Mind\\") Johnson, Rivera founded STAR (Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries) in 1970. That same year, New York gay drag activist Lee Brewster and heterosexual transvestite Bunny Eisenhower founded the Queens Liberation Front, and Brewster began publishing Queens, one of the more political transgender publications of the 1970s. Leading figures of the militant transgender activism on the West Coast were Beth Elliott and Angela Douglas. Elliot was one of the first politically active transsexual lesbians, who at one point served as vice-president of the San Francisco chapter of the Daughters of Bilitis, the lesbian homophile organization, and edited the chapter's newsletter, Sisters. Elliot became a flashpoint for the issue of MTF (male-to-female) transsexual inclusion in the women's community when, after a divisive public debate, she was ejected from the West Coast Women's Conference in 1973. Douglas had been active in GLF-Los Angeles in 1969 and wrote extensively about sexual liberation issues for Southern California's counter- cultural press. In 1970 she founded TAO (Transsexual/Transvestite Action Organization), which published the Moonshadow and Mirage newsletters. Douglas moved TAO to Miami in 1972, where it came to include several Puerto Rican and Cuban members, and soon grew into the first truly international transgender community organization. =Development and challenges= The 1970s were marked by slow, incremental gains as well as demoralizing setbacks from the first flushes of success in the late 1960s. In the early 1970s in Philadelphia, the Radical Queens Collective forged effective political links with gay liberation and lesbian feminist activism. In Southern California, activists such as Jude Patton and Joanna Clark spearheaded competent social, psychological, and medical support services for transgender people. Feminist ethicist Janice Raymond in her work Transsexual Empire characterized transgender men as traitors to their sex and to the cause of feminism, and transgender women as rapists engaged in an unwanted penetration of women's space. She suggested that transsexuals be \\"morally mandated out of existence.\\" As a result of such views, transgender activists in the 1970s and 1980s tended to wage their struggles for equality and human rights in isolation rather than in alliance with other progressive political movements. Transsexual people lived in oppressive surroundings and were considered wild, unfit or even dangerous, because new political and social agendas, which provoked these negative attitudes, were rising. Those were reasons for pessimism and inactivity in transgender community. Nevertheless, legal status improved across the country, resulting in easier paths for transgender people to change the gender designations on state-issued identification documents and to find professional and affordable health care. In 1975, the city of Minneapolis became the first governmental entity in the United States to pass trans-inclusive civil rights protection legislation. New questions, subcultures and challenges in 1980s and after When the AIDS epidemic became visible in 1981, transgender people‚Äîespecially minorities involved in street prostitution and injection drug subcultures‚Äîwere among the hardest hit. One of the few bright spots in transgender activism in the 1980s was the emergence of an organized FTM (female-to-male) transgender community, which took shape nearly two decades later than a comparable degree of organization among the male-to-female transgender movement. In 1986, inspired by FTM pioneers, Lou Sullivan, a crucially important community-based historian of transgenderism, founded the FTM support group that grew into FTM International, the leading advocacy group for female-to-male individuals, and began publishing The FTM Newsletter. Sullivan was also a founding member and board member of the GLBT Historical Society (formerly the Gay and Lesbian Historical Society) in San Francisco. His personal and activist papers are preserved in the institution's archives as collection no. 1991-07; the papers are fully processed and available for use by researchers, and a finding aid is posted on the Online Archive of California.Guide to the Louis Graydon Sullivan Papers, 1755-1991 (bulk 1961-1991) (Online Archive of California). The Historical Society has displayed selected materials from Sullivan's papers in a number of exhibitions, notably \\"Man-i-fest: FTM Mentoring in San Francisco from 1976 to 2009,\\" which was open through much of 2010 in the second gallery at the society's headquarters at 657 Mission St. in San Francisco, and \\"Our Vast Queer Past: Celebrating San Francsico's GLBT History,\\" the debut exhibition in the main gallery at the society's GLBT History Museum that opened in January 2011 in San Francisco's Castro District. In the years since Sullivan's death in 1991, Jamison Green has emerged as the leading FTM activist in the United States. He chairs the board of Gender Education and Advocacy, a non-profit educational organization, and serves on the boards of the Transgender Law and Policy Institute and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health. He is also a board member of the Equality Project and an advisory board member of the National Center for Transgender Equality. He was the leader of FTM International from March 1991 to August 1999 and a member of the Human Rights Campaign Business Council until late 2007, when he resigned over the organisation's stance on transgender inclusion in the Employment Non- Discrimination Act. In 1980, transgender phenomena were officially classified by the American Psychiatric Association as psychopathology, \\"gender identity disorder.\\" = Camp Trans = Camp Trans was sparked by a 1991 incident in which Nancy Burkholder was ejected from the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival after another woman asked her whether she was trans and she refused to answer The festival maintained a women-born-women policy since its inception, as evidenced by posters from the first festival in 1975 . Each year afterwards a group of women, both transgender and cisgender, protested the exclusion of trans women from the event. Initially these protests were small and sometimes carried on inside of the camp. A more organized group of trans women and their allies began camping and holding demonstrations outside the gate. After a five-year hiatus, Camp Trans returned in 1999, led by transgender activists Riki Ann Wilchins and Leslie Feinberg, as well as many members of the Boston and Chicago Lesbian Avengers. The events of this year drew attention and controversy, culminating in tensions as a small group of transgender activists were admitted into the festival to exchange dialogue with organizers and to negotiate a short-lived compromise allowing only post-operative trans women on the festival land.Son of Camp Trans Press Release: Protest Called For Women's Music Festival Discriminatory Policy Still In Effect (June 26, 1999) =The Transsexual Menace and Transgender Nation= The Transsexual Menace, co- founded by Riki Wilchins and Denise Norris in 1994, the year that Transgender Nation folded, tapped into and provided an outlet for the outrage many transgender people experienced in the brutal murder of Brandon Teena, a transgender youth, and two of his friends in a farmhouse in rural Nebraska on December 31, 1993. The murders, depicted in Kimberly Peirce's Academy Award- winning feature film Boys Don't Cry (2000), called dramatic attention to the serious, on-going problem of anti-transgender violence and hate crimes. The Transexual Menace continues to have periodic resurgences to protest both transgender hate-crimes and the marginalization and/or exclusion of transgender issues by the LGBT community. Another radical and effective organisation was Transgender Nation which noisily dragged transgender issues to the forefront of San Francisco's queer community, and at the local level successfully integrated transgender concerns with the political agendas of lesbian, gay, and bisexual activists to forge a truly inclusive GLBTQ community. Transgender Nation organized a media-grabbing protest at the 1993 annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association to call attention to the official pathologization of transgender phenomena. Transgender Nation paved the way for subsequent similar groups such as Transexual Menace and It's Time America that went on to play a larger role in the national political arena. GenderPAC GenderPAC (Gender Public Advocacy Coalition) fulfills a vital need for advocacy, both within the transgender community and outside it, on gender-related issues and is by far the largest national organization in the United States devoted to ending discrimination against gender diversity. Rather than focusing on single-identity-based advocacy, GenderPAC recognizes and promotes understanding of the commonality among all types of oppression, including racism, sexism, classism, and ageism. Organisation was founded by Riki Wilchins. GenderPAC, which has sponsored an annual lobbying day in Washington, D.C., since the late 1990s, is but the most visible of many transgender political groups to emerge over the last decade. More than 30 cities, and a handful of states, have now passed transgender civil rights legislation. While the transgender movement still faces many significant challenges and obstacles to gaining full equality, the wave of activism that began in the early 1990s has not yet peaked. In terms of violence prevention, GenderPAC collaborates with a Capitol Hill-based coalition of bipartisan organizations to further public education and media awareness about gender- based violent crimes. It emphasizes to members of Congress the need for passage of the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act (that is, the Hate Crimes Act). Further, as part of its public education efforts, the organization has held an annual National Conference on Gender in Washington, D. C. since 2001. The conference is a gathering of over 1,000 activists throughout the country and from numerous colleges, who work together for three days on issues of gender policy, education, and strategy. Some of the programs are GenderYOUTH, Workplace Fairness, Violence Prevention, and Public Education initiatives through which GenderPAC works to dispel myths about gender stereotypes. The GenderYOUTH program, for example, strives to empower young activists so that they can create GenderROOTS college campus chapters themselves, and go on to educate others about school violence. Via its Workplace Fairness project, GenderPAC helps to educate elected officials about gender issues, change public attitudes, and support lawsuits that may expand legal rights for people who have suffered discrimination on the basis of gender. = Community disagreements = GenderPAC exemplified what certain feminists opposed about queer rights movements and certain elements of gender studies: Sheila Jeffreys wrote that its aims ignored women in favor of \\"transgenders , most of whom are men, and homosexuality,\\" and that the organization's conception of gender as something that should be protected, and the basis for individuals rights that needed to be respected rather than eliminated, would serve to reinforce discrimination. Conversely, other transgender rights organizations were angered by GenderPAC's rejection of the label of a transgender organization and to focus on trans issues. These latter criticized GenderPAC's reputed shift of focus away from a trans-inclusive ENDA at the supposed prompting of HRC, their unwillingness to engage with identity categories, and what they saw as a \\"violation\\" or exclusion of trans people through the use of their stories to raise money which was not spent primarily on trans issues. In fact, GenderPAC's Board and constituency remained heavily transgender from its founding until it ceased operations. Wilchins proposed that the focus of a gender rights struggle to be about the issue of gender discrimination, rather than identity of transgender, which might leave out many of those who suffered discrimination. This view brought the organization to crisis when it took on the case of a self-identified \\"butch lesbian\\" who sought help after being repeatedly harassed at work and ultimately fired for allegedly looking \\"too masculine.\\" Many on the Board said GenderPAC should only help transgender- identified individuals; others, including Wilchins, maintained that it was the issue of gender discrimination, rather than individual identity, that was paramount. It was a divide that GenderPAC struggled to bridge during its entire time in existence, and in many ways came to define the organization.  The Transgender Law Center (TLC)  TIC is a San Francisco-based civil rights organization advocating for transgender communities. They are California's first \\"fully staffed, state-wide transgender legal organization\\" and were initially a fiscally sponsored project of the National Center for Lesbian Rights.http://www.nclrights.org/explore-the-issues/transgender- law/transgender-law/ accessed 04/21/2014 The stated mission of TLC is to connect transgender people and their families to technically sound and culturally competent legal services, increase acceptance and enforcement of laws and policies that support California's transgender communities, and work to change laws and systems that fail to incorporate the needs and experiences of transgender people. TLC utilizes direct legal services, public policy advocacy, and educational opportunities to advance the rights and safety of diverse transgender communities.http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/Clerk/City_Council/2013/10Oct/Documents/2013-10-01_Item_08_Proclamation_in_Honor_of_Transgender_Law.aspx accessed 04/21/2014 Since launching in 2002, TLC has held over 250 transgender law workshops providing legal information to more than 3,250 community members, attorneys, social service providers, and business owners, as well as collaborated on public policy initiatives designed to improve safety in schools and prisons and safe access to public restrooms for transgender people in San Francisco. TLC successfully helped to revise San Francisco's \\"Regulations to Prohibit Gender Identity Discrimination\\" in December 2003, making them more inclusive of people who do not identify as strictly female or male, and pass cutting-edge legislation in the City of Oakland banning gender identity discrimination in housing, employment, public accommodation, and city services. Anti-transgender hate crimes The website Remembering Our Dead, compiled by activist Gwen Smith and hosted by the Gender Education Association, honors the memory of the transgender murder victims. The Remembering Our Dead project spawned the Transgender Day of Remembrance (TDoR), an annual event begun in 1999, which is now observed in dozens of cities around the world.  The intersex movement  Intersex activism between the late 1990s and mid 2000s led from demonstrating outside a national pediatric conference, in an event now commemorated by Intersex Awareness Day to speaking inside clinical conferences, and the first human rights investigation into medical \\"normalization\\", by the Human Rights Commission of the City and County of San Francisco. This was followed by a period of retrenchment of medical authority over intersex bodies. The Intersex Society of North America (ISNA) was a non-profit advocacy group founded in 1993 by Cheryl Chase to end shame and secrecy; they also advocated deferring most genital surgeries on children. Other notable members included Morgan Holmes, Max Beck, Howard Devore and Alice Dreger. The ISNA stated that intersex is a socially constructed label that reflects actual biological variation. They further stated that intersex anatomy is not always present at birth, and may not manifest until the child hits puberty. ISNA closed in June 2008 after supporting the creation of a new clinical term for intersex conditions, Disorders of Sex Development (DSD) albeit ambivalently, as a means of opening \\"many more doors\\" and engaging with clinicians. New organizations such as Intersex Campaign for Equality and interACT were since established with civil and human rights goals. Advocacy continues, including legal action, with the \\"M.C.\\" legal case, advanced by Interact Advocates for Intersex Youth with the Southern Poverty Law Centre still before the courts, international advocacy drawing attention to continuing abuses within the U.S. medical system, and work by Intersex Campaign for Equality and others on recognition of intersex people with non-binary identities. Notable and active U.S. advocates include Georgiann Davis, Pidgeon Pagonis, Sean Saifa Wall, Hida Viloria and Anne Tamar-Mattis. AIDS activism Militant groups such as ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power) and Queer Nation crafted a media-oriented, direct-action politics that proved congenial to a new generation of transgender activists. The first transgender activist group to embrace the new queerqueer politics was Transgender Nation, founded in 1992 as an offshoot of Queer Nation's San Francisco chapter. Eruption of AIDS crisis urged for another approach. An effective response to the epidemic meant addressing systemic social problems such as poverty and racism that transcended narrow sexual identity politics. Leslie Feinberg's influential pamphlet, Transgender Liberation: A Movement Whose Time Has Come, published in 1992, heralded a new era in transgender politics. Feinberg describes herself as a \\"white, working class, secular Jewish, transgender lesbian\\", and personally uses she or ze to describe her/herself.\\"Challenging Gender Order. Two New Books on the Boundary\\", Buffalo News, January 22, 1993 Feinberg's 1993 first novel Stone Butch Blues, won the Lambda Literary Award and the 1994 American Library Association Gay & Lesbian Book Award.

The Human Rights Campaign (HRC)  It is the largest LGBT civil rights advocacy group and political lobbying organization in the United States. According to the HRC, it has more than 1.5 million members and supporters. HRC is an umbrella group of two separate non-profit organizations and a political action committee: the HRC Foundation, a 501(c)(3) organization that focuses on research, advocacy and education; the Human Rights Campaign, a 501(c)(4) organization that focuses on promoting the social welfare of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people through lobbying Congress and state and local officials for support of pro-LGBT bills, and mobilizing grassroots action amongst its members; and the HRC Political Action Committee, which supports candidates that adhere to its positions on LGBT rights. Local activities are carried out by local steering committees, of which there are over 30 located throughout the United States.  The Global Equality Fund (GEF)  It is a program of the Secretary of State's Office of Global Partnerships, launched by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in December 2011, that supports programs advocating the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people around the world through public- private partnerships. The GEF makes $3 million available to civil society organizations worldwide through small grants and requests for proposal. The government of Norway has pledged financial support for the GEF. The GEF has partnered with the mGive Foundation in order to solicit donations via mobile phones, and has fundraised with other organizations such as the Human Rights Campaign and the Elton John AIDS Foundation. The announcement of the GEF won support from Freedom House and the Human Rights Campaign. LGBT rights and the Supreme Court * 1956 - Supreme Court rules that a homosexual publication is not automatically obscene and thus protected by the First Amendment. * 1967 - Supreme Court rules that Congress may exclude immigrants on the grounds that they are homosexual. Congress amends its laws in 1990. * 1972 - Supreme Court rules that a Minnesota law defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman is constitutional. * 1976 - Supreme Court refuses to hear and thus affirms a lower courts ruling that a Virginia state sodomy law is constitutional. (see Doe v. Commonwealth's Attorney). * 1985 - Supreme Court is equally divided in a 4-4 decision, and thus affirms an Oklahoma Appeals Court ruling that an Oklahoma law that gave the public school broad authority to fire homosexual teachers was too broad and thus unconstitutional. * 1986 - In Bowers v. Hardwick the Supreme Court rules that sodomy laws are constitutional. The court overturns this ruling in the 2003 case of Lawrence v. Texas. * 1996 - In Romer v. Evans the high court overturns a state constitutional amendment prohibiting elected lawmakers in Colorado from including LGB people in their civil rights laws. * 1998 - The Supreme Court rules that federal sexual harassment laws do include same-sex sexual harassment. * 2001 - The Supreme Court rules that the Boy Scouts of America does not have to follow state anti-discrimination laws when it comes to sexual orientation. * 2003 - Lawrence vs. Texas declares state sodomy laws that were used to prosecute homosexuals for having sex in the privacy of their homes unconstitutional. * 2013 - United States v. Windsor declares Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional, rendering same-sex marriages performed in jurisdictions where legal recognized by the federal government. * 2015 - Obergefell v. Hodges, in a 5-4 decision, legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, in all 50 states.

Briengay-rights movement.The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2008. Encyclopedia.com. 4 March 2009 =American political parties, interest groups and LGBT rights= The Libertarian Party supported a libertarian perspective on LGBT rights from its founding in 1971. Its first platform, in 1972, said, \\"We hold that no action which does not infringe the rights of others can properly be termed a crime. We favor the repeal of all laws creating \\"crimes without victims\\" now incorporated in Federal, state and local laws‚Äîsuch as laws on voluntary sexual relations, drug use, gambling, and attempted suicide.\\" In 1976 the party published a pamphlet, \\"Gay Rights: A Libertarian Approach,\\" which called for an end to sodomy laws and other legal discrimination, including with regard to marriage and adoption. The pamphlet also explained that libertarians opposed \\"legislation forcing private persons who, for one reason or another, dislike homosexuals, nevertheless to hire them, admit them to \\"public accommodations\\" (which are not really \\"public\\" at all, but privately owned), and rent or sell apartment or houses to them\\" because \\"freedom...implies also the freedom to be wrong.\\" 2012 Libertarian presidential nominee criticized President Obama for not endorsing a federal right to gay marriage. The National Stonewall Democratic Federation is the official LGBT organization for the Democratic Party, while the Log Cabin Republicans is the organization for lesbian, gay and bisexual citizens that want to moderate the Republican Party social policies. In terms of minor political parties, the Outright Libertarians is the official LGBT organization for the Libertarian Party, and is among the groups that follow the Libertarian perspectives on gay rights. The Green Party LGBT members are represented by the Lavender Greens. The Socialist Party USA has a Queer Commission to focus on LGBT rights issues. In terms of interest groups, the Human Rights Campaign is the largest LGBT organization in the United States, claiming over 725,000 members and supporters, though this membership count is disputed. The HRC endorses federal candidates, and while it is technically bi-partisan and has endorsed some Republican Party, its overall pro-choice, center-left philosophy tends to favor the Democratic Party candidates. The National Gay and Lesbian Taskforce is a progressive LGBT organization that focuses on local, state and federal issues, while the Independent Gay Forum and the Gays and Lesbians for Individual Liberty both subscribe to conservative or libertarian principles. And the Empowering Spirits Foundation not only engages in empowering individuals and organizations to engage in the political process for equality, but engages in service-oriented activities in communities typically opposed to equal rights to help bring about change. =American law and LGBT rights= As a federal republic, absent of many federal laws or court decisions, LGBT rights often are dealt with at the local or state level. Thus the rights of LGBT people in one state may be very different from the rights of LGBT people in another state. * Same-sex couples: On June 26, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down all state bans on same-sex marriage, legalized it in all fifty states, and required states to honor out-of-state same-sex marriage licenses in the case Obergefell v. Hodges. See also Same sex marriage in the United States. * Freedom of Speech - Homosexuality as way of expression and life is not as obscene, and thus protected under the First Amendment. However, states can reasonably regulate the time, place and manner of speech. Pornography is protected, when it is not obscene, but it is based on local community standards, which is reasonable and fair. * Civil rights - Sexual orientation is not a protected class under Federal civil rights law, but it is protected for federal civilian employees and in federal security clearance issues. The United States Supreme Court implied in Romer v. Evans that a state may not prohibit gay people from using the democratic process to get protection, prescribed by antidiscrimination law. * Education - Public schools and universities generally have to recognize an LGBT student organization, if they recognize other social or political organization, but high school students may be required to get parental consent. * Hate crimes and criminal law - Area in which, perhaps, the biggest progression is made. Federal hate crime law now includes sexual orientation and gender identity. The Matthew Shepard Act, officially the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which expands the 1969 United States federal hate-crime law to include crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disabilityis, is an Act of Congress, passed on October 22, 2009, and was signed into law by President Barack Obama on October 28, 2009, as a rider to the National Defense Authorization Act for 2010 (H.R. 2647). As far as criminal law is concerned, homosexual relations between consenting adults in private is not a crime, per Lawrence v. Texas. The age of consent for heterosexuals and homosexuals should be the same, but each state decides what that age shall be. This does not apply to military law, where sodomy is still a felony under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Although, the Lawrence decision has been cited in some military cases as applying.

In its 30-year history, MYSC was credited with many television specials, numerous recordings, concerts, and several major tours throughout the U.S. The group was disbanded during the 1999 reorganization of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and resulting creation of the Orchestra at Temple Square. The choral arm of the group provided music for the church's annual and semi-annual general conferences, usually during the Saturday morning sessions.  History  The MYSC was organized in 1969 with Jay E. Welch as music director and was given a primary commission from the LDS Church to promote a \\"greater understanding between all peoples and cultures.\\" Welch continued in this position until his appointment as music director of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir in 1974. At the peak of its activity, the MYSC performed approximately thirty times each year, including formal concerts in the Mormon Tabernacle, conference appearances, firesides, tours, broadcasts, and recordings. The concert programming was changed to a Boston Pops-style format when Robert C. Bowden became music director in 1974. Bowden composed and arranged much of the music for the groups, which frequently toured throughout the United States. In 1987, the MYSC played at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. as part of the bicentennial celebration of the U.S. Constitution. Many prominent guest classical and pop artists performed in MYSC concerts throughout its history. The MYSC won fourteen national awards for television specials, including two Emmys, two George Washington Awards from the Freedom Foundation, and the Angel Award from Religion in Media. It also performed for several national and international groups; such presentations included a television special for the Norwegian Broadcasting Company as well as specials for American Veterans of World War II, Korea, and Vietnam, and for the National League of American Pen Women. The MYSC had eighteen commercial recordings to its credit at the time it disbanded in 1999. In the mid 1990s, the name was officially changed to the Mormon Youth Chorus and Symphony, to reflect the age restrictions enforced on the choir but not enforced on the symphony. Thereafter, when performing alone, the symphony was known simply as the Mormon Symphony. In June 2010, the alumni of the former organization performed in two reunion concerts in the Salt Lake Tabernacle, as part of the 30th anniversary of the Temple Square Concert series.

Formerly home to a pioneer Appalachian community and logging town, Tremont is now the location of the Great Smoky Mountains Institute at Tremont. Geography Middle Prong of Little River, just above Walker Valley Tremont is situated along the Middle Prong of Little River a few miles south of Townsend in Blount County, Tennessee. \\"Tremont\\" can refer to the former logging town of Tremont or the Great Smoky Mountains Institute at Tremont, but it generally applies to Middle Prong's entire watershed between Miry Ridge to the east and Defeat Ridge to the west. Both of these ridges run perpendicular to the main crest of the Great Smokies, which rises several thousand feet above Tremont to the south. Middle Prong is formed by the confluence of Lynn Camp Prong, which flows down from the southeast, and Thunderhead Prong, which flows down from the southwest. From this junction, Middle Prong flows north for another to its mouth along Little River at an area known as the Townsend Y. About halfway between the Lynn Camp-Thunderhead junction and the Y, a narrow bottomland known as Walker Valley has been cut as Middle Prong absorbs several small streams flowing down from Meigs Mountain and Fodderstack Mountain. The Great Smoky Mountains Institute at Tremont is located in Walker Valley. Tremont Road runs parallel to Middle Prong, and is paved from its intersection along Little River Road to the Institute at Walker Valley. A gravel road extends for another three miles (5 km) to a cul-de-sac and parking area at the Lynn Camp- Thunderhead junction. Along Little River Road, Cades Cove is approximately to the west and Elkmont is to the east. History =Early settlement= The grave of Will Walker at the Bethel Baptist Cemetery in Townsend William Marion Walker (1838‚Äì1919), who was born in nearby Tuckaleechee Cove, and his first wife Nancy Caylor were the first known permanent settlers along Middle Prong. Walker arrived in the area around 1859 and settled in the valley that now bears his name. The Great Smokies Institute at Tremont is located on what was once Walker's house and immediate farmland. Even in his own time, Walker was something of a legend. His sharpshooting skills were so well known, he was often barred from shooting contests.Vic Weals, The Last Train to Elkmont (Knoxville: Olden Press, 1993), 12. Walker kept over a hundred bee stands, which he robbed without the use of mask or smoke, and sold the honey in nearby Tuckaleechee. During the U.S. Civil War, he aided struggling families in Tuckaleechee by going from house to house to cut firewood and do basic chores.Weals, The Last Train to Elkmont, 11-15. While Walker was well liked and respected throughout the northwestern Smokies, he was always a source of controversy due to his practice of polygamy. Walker, who was very religious, believed that Biblical scripture allowed him to take more than one wife. In 1864, he married Mary Ann Moore and a few years later married a third wife, Mary Moll Stinnett. Walker eventually fathered a total of 26 children, although several died in infancy. He allowed tenant farmers to move into Walker Valley, and a small community developed. Walker constructed three gristmills to accommodate the growing community.Weals, The Last Train to Elkmont, 12-15.\\"Tremont and the History of Walker Valley .\\" The Great Smoky Mountains Institute At Tremont Online. Retrieved: 5 November 2007. =Early logging= As large-scale logging operations left much of the Eastern United States deforested by the late 19th century, logging companies turned to the remote virgin forests of Southern Appalachia to meet the nation's growing demand for timber. Taking advantage of recent band saw and logging railroad innovations, small logging firms began to spring up around the Great Smokies. The first logging venture to reach Walker Valley and the Middle Prong area was that of John English, a Knoxville businessman whose company began cutting timber in nearby Tuckaleechee Cove in the early 1880s. English used a series of splash dams to move the logs down Little River to a mill on the outskirts of Knoxville. One such splash dam was located at the mouth of Spruce Flats along Middle Prong, just above Walker Valley. While English's lumbering venture turned a small profit, a flood along Little River apparently wiped out his splash dams in the late 1890s, and his venture had folded by 1900.Weals, The Last Train to Elkmont, 1-3. =The Little River Lumber Company= Thunderhead Prong While Will Walker allowed English to build a splash dam and do minor logging in the Middle Prong watershed, he disliked the thought of large-scale logging operations mowing down his valley's virgin forests. In 1901, Colonel Wilson B. Townsend and several associates formed the Little River Lumber Company and bought up of land along Little River between Tuckaleechee and the river's source on the slopes of Clingman's Dome. Walker, however, refused to sell Middle Prong, forcing Townsend's operations eastward to what is now Elkmont.Weals, The Last Train to Elkmont, 11. Townsend set up a band saw mill in Tuckaleechee, and the town that bears his name grew up in the vicinity. He formed the Little River Railroad to connect the mill with the Southern Railroad terminal at nearby Walland, and with able engineers managed to lay railroad tracts all the way to the upper reaches of Little River and Jakes Creek. In 1918, Walker suffered a stroke that left him largely incapacitated. On December 26 of that year, he finally agreed to sell Middle Prong to Little River Lumber after Townsend gave him his word that he wouldn't harvest trees along Thunderhead Prong. Six months later, Walker died after suffering a second stroke. On Townsend's orders, a small train carried Walker's coffin ceremoniously to the Bethel Baptist Cemetery in Tuckaleechee, where it rests today.Weals, The Last Train to Elkmont, 17-18. =Tremont= A stray railroad beam on the Middle Prong Trail Although Townsend sold his Little River tract to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park Commission in 1926, he did so with the agreement that he could continue logging in the area for 15 years.Carlos Campbell, Birth of a National Park In the Great Smoky Mountains (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1969), 33-35. After logging operations had commenced at Elkmont in 1925, Townsend ordered the tracks to be pulled up and moved to Middle Prong. A base for the Middle Prong operation was set up at the junction of Lynn Camp Prong and Thunderhead Prong. This base quickly grew into a small town, which was given the name Tremont, a combination of \\"tree\\" and \\"mountain.\\"Weals, The Last Train to Elkmont, 85-88. While Tremont remained a base of operations, the logging camps moved further and further up Lynn Camp Prong as the operation progressed. These camps consisted of small shanty houses that could be loaded onto flatcars and moved from camp to camp. The base camp at Tremont consisted of a post office, hotel, maintenance sheds, a general store, and a community center that served as a church, school, and movie theater.For a map of the logging town of Tremont, see Florence Cope Bush, Dorie: Woman of the Mountains (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1992), 172, or Tremont Logging History Auto Tour Guide (Gatlinburg: Great Smoky Mountains Association), which can be obtained at the Tremont Visitor Center. The former town of Tremont is now a parking lot for the Middle Prong Trail Dora Cope, who lived at Tremont in the late 1920s and 1930s, later recalled various aspects of life in the logging camps. Cope remembered the camps being infested with rats and vulnerable to fires and the unpredictable weather of the Smokies. Cope spoke of Middle Prong as a \\"crystal playground\\" that was serene and calm on a typical day, but could change quickly with heavy rainfall: > ...sometimes without warning, a heavy thunderstorm high on the mountain > changed it into a roaring, tearing monster. At night, after a storm, we > could hear the giant rocks being pushed and crushed together by its force. > Trees, loosened by the flood, crashed into the water to be swept > downstream.Florence Cope Bush, Dorie: Woman of the Mountains (Knoxville: > University of Tennessee Press, 1992), 171. As with Elkmont to the east, Townsend sought to promote the Tremont area as a summer resort. The Tremont Hotel opened in 1926 to provide housing for loggers and transients, but as the camps moved further up the valley, the hotel was opened up to tourists. The hotels at both Elkmont and Tremont developed a reputation as licentious places among the mountain people, as Cope recalled: > The rumors and stories of what went on in the hotels kept the natives > entertained. Some thought of them as the Sodom and Gomorrah of the > mountains. A few local girls were employed as maids at both hotels. Pretty, > young daughters were warned to stay away from the places.Bush, Dorie: Woman > of the Mountains, 199. Townsend had promised Will Walker that Thunderhead Prong would not be cut, a promise he kept until his death in 1935. With Townsend out of the way, however, the Little River Lumber Company proceeded to harvest Thunderhead Prong.Weals, The Last Train to Elkmont, 18. In December 1938, the last trees were cut in the Tremont area. =The National Park= The visitor center of the Great Smoky Mountains Institute at Tremont While the logging operations provided an economic boost to the northwestern Smokies, the rapid deforestation of Little River's watershed proved devastating for the river's ecosystem. With the formation of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in 1934 and the end of logging operations in 1938, however, the forest quickly regrew. The Civilian Conservation Corps converted Little River Railroad's railroad beds into roads and trails. Today, other than the occasional stray skidder cable or railroad tie, there is little immediate evidence that logging ever took place in the area. In 1969, Maryville College, with the help of the National Park Service, established the Tremont Environmental Education Center at the site of a former Job Corps center in Walker Valley. The purpose of the center was to provide a first-hand approach to understanding the environment and ecology of the mountains.\\"Tremont and the History of Walker Valley .\\" The Great Smoky Mountains Institute At Tremont Online. Retrieved: 5 November 2007. In the early 1970s, the center hosted the Youth Conservation Corps during the summer. In 1980, the Great Smoky Mountains Natural History Association assumed control of the education center, and in 1985 the name was changed to the Great Smoky Mountains Institute at Tremont to further acknowledge its ties to the park.Sarah Kucharski, \\"Great Smoky Mountains Institute at Tremont Makes Nature Hands-on .\\" Smoky Mountain News, 2 May 2007.

They pooled their individual resources to help each other migrate, and performed both for fellow church members traveling as well for some of the Iowa settlements they traveled through. The band was able to stay together as far as Garden Grove, Iowa, but fragmented after that point. Young tried to keep some of the best players of the group together by having them travel close to his own wagons and play for his family during the journey.Hicks, Mormonism and Music, p. 61 In the end, only three members of the band where accompanying Young when he reached the Salt Lake Valley in July 1847. By October 1848, enough of the band members had completed the journey to allow for a performance at LDS Church's general conference. On July 24, 1849, the second anniversary of the Mormon pioneers entering the Salt Lake Valley, the band lead a commemoration which became a precursor for the modern Pioneer Day celebrations. In early 1850, the Nauvoo Brass Band was formally reorganized and provided with new uniforms through a donation from Young. Notable appearances in Utah include performances in 1853 at the Salt Lake Temple site dedication ceremony and later at the laying of the cornerstones. They also met the first handcart pioneer company, as well as other pioneer groups as they entered the Salt Lake Valley. Modern recreation The Brass Band was re-created in 2003 by the LDS Church's Illinois Nauvoo Mission. The group is made up of young performing missionaries who go to Nauvoo to play in the Brass Band each summer. Their purpose now is the same as that of the original Nauvoo Brass Band; to entertain the people who live in Nauvoo, and those who come to Nauvoo. They perform daily in the summer on a horse-drawn Band Wagon on the streets of Nauvoo, and at concerts thru-out the day, including \\"Sunset By the Mississippi\\". Notable members * Robert T.

He developed a computer model to show how life on earth could have originated in outer space. Education After finishing his Bachelor of Science from Ramakrishna Mission Residential College, Narendrapur in Physics Honours in 1979 (and becoming topper of Calcutta University) he went to IIT, Kanpur to complete his M. Sc. Degree in Physics in 1981. He joined the Physics Dept. of the University of Chicago in 1981 to complete PhD work. Within a year he completed a paper with Robert Geroch and X.B. Liang on a Theorem on \\"Time like Curves of limited acceleration in General Relativity\\". Subsequently, he concentrated on black hole astrophysics, received his Ph.D. in 1985 and went to Caltech as a R.C. Tolman Fellow. Major work in this period includes nucleosynthesis around black holes with W.D. Arnett. Career After a brief period at ICTP, Trieste, where Chakrabarti completed a few definitive work on the formation of shocks in transonic/advective flows around black holes, he joined Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, and S.N. Bose National Centre. Presently he is the Director of Indian Centre for Space Physics , Kolkata, which he founded in 1999. He was at NASA Goddard Space Flight Centre (1994-1995) as a Senior Associate selected by National Research Council. Research The main focus of Chakrabarti's research is the hydrodynamic and radiative properties of astrophysical flows around black holes and other compact objects. He showed that the accreting matter must be transonic and should have standing, oscillating and propagating shocks. He and his collaborators studied many aspects of these flows and showed that the black hole accretion must have non- Keplerian component which plays a major role in deciding the observational properties. He wrote the first monograph on \\"Theory of Transonic Astrophysical Flows\\" (World Scientific Pub. Co., Singapore; 1990). He has completed over 570 research articles and written or edited several books and conference volumes. Thirty eight students have completed Ph.D. Thesis under his supervision. According to Chakrabarti, black hole astrophysics is basically the astrophysics of sub-Keplerian flows and CENBOL, the centrifugal pressure dominated boundary layer around black holes. The work of Chakrabarti (Astrophysical journal, 1997) brings out the detailed spectral properties of two component flows. Chakrabarti was the first scientist to suggest that Gamma-ray bursts are the birth cry of black holes at his presentation in 1995, third Hunsville, Alabama Conference. In 2013, Scientists observed a conclusive evidence of this birth cry.

Franzese's career in organized crime began in the 1930s and spanned over eight decades. He served as underboss of the Colombo family from 1963, until he was sentenced to 50 years in prison for bank robbery charges in 1967. He was paroled in 1978, but was re-jailed at least six times on parole violations throughout the decades that followed. He became Colombo family underboss again in 2005, until he was convicted of extortion in 2011, and sentenced to eight years in prison. His son John Franzese Jr. had testified against him, becoming the first son of a New York mobster to turn state's evidence and testify against his father. At the time of his release on June 23, 2017, at the age of 100, he was the oldest federal inmate in the United States and the only centenarian in federal custody. He died in a New York City hospital on February 24, 2020, at the age of 103. Rise in the Colombo crime family Franzese was born in Naples, Italy, to Carmine Franzese and Maria Corvola on February 6, 1917, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons.Jerry Capeci, \\"A Godfather Betrayed by His Namesake, Part II\\" New York Sun, May 17, 2007Bureau of Narcotics, Sam Giancana Mafia: The Governments Secret File on Organized Crime.(pg. 454) His parents had already immigrated to the United States at the time of his birth, and were back in Italy for a visit. After six months, his family returned with Franzese to their Greenpoint, Brooklyn home; his father ran a bakery there. His mother had given him the nickname \\"Sonny\\" at a young age. In the late 1930s, Franzese worked under Joseph Profaci, boss of the Profaci crime family (later named the Colombo crime family). His first arrest came in 1938, for assault. In 1942, in the midst of World War II, he was drafted to the United States Army, but was discharged later that year classified as \\"psychoneurotic with pronounced homicidal tendencies\\". Court papers accused him of committing rape against a waitress in 1947, but was never arrested in relation to the crime. Franzese (left) with boxer Rocky Graziano (center) in the 1940s Franzese operated out of New York City and New Jersey and was involved in racketeering, fraud, and loansharking. He was also a regular at the Copacabana and met with such stars as Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. on a frequent basis. He was also a boxing fan of Rocky Graziano. He became a made man in 1950, and served in the crew of Sebastian \\"Buster\\" Aloi, father of former Colombo family acting boss Vincenzo Aloi. He is believed to have been elevated to caporegime or captain in the Colombo family in the mid 1950s by Profaci. By 1963, he had been promoted to underboss by boss Joseph Colombo. In the 1950s and 60s, Franzese listed his official occupation as an owner of a dry-cleaning store in Brooklyn. In 1967, Franzese gained a financial interest in a new recording company, Buddah Records. Franzese used Buddah to launder illegal mob earnings and to bribe disc jockeys with payola. He also infiltrated and began to make money through the owner of Calla Records, Nate McCalla, until the recording label ceased operations in 1977, and McCalla was murdered execution style in 1980.\\"John - Sonny - Franzese\\" La Cosa Nostra Database Trial and conviction He was accused of murdering Genovese crime family hitman-turned-informant Ernest Rupolo in 1964 on the orders of Vito Genovese. Rupolo was shot and stabbed several times before his feet were attached to two concrete blocks and his hands tied before being dumped into Jamaica Bay. He was arrested in 1966, and during his trial, the prosecution produced records that claimed that Franzese had killed between 30 and 50 people.\\"Franzese Is Said to Have Killed '30 or 40 or 50' Persons\\" , The New York Times, March 4, 1967 Franzese was later acquitted of the murder. However, on March 3, 1967, Franzese was convicted in Albany, New York of masterminding a series of four bank robberies across the country in 1965, and was finally sentenced to 50 years in prison at United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth, by judge Jacob Mishler in 1970, after several denied appeals.\\"Franzese and 4 are found guilty; Albany jury convicts them in bank robberies\\" , The New York Times, May 3, 1967 His son, Michael, alleged that when Mishler sentenced his father, Franzese declared, \\"You watch. I'm gonna do the whole 50\\". Franzese's nephew, Salvatore Franzese, reportedly headed Franzese's gambling operations while Franzese was in prison. In 1978, Franzese was released on parole but returned to prison in 1982 for a parole violation. In 1984, Franzese was released on parole again.\\"Board Would Send Franzese to Prison\\" , The New York Times, August 21, 1986 Until 2008, he was never charged with another crime, although he would return to prison on parole violations on at least six occasions. Workshop on murder In 2006, Franzese discussed techniques for mob murders with Gaetano \\"Guy\\" Fatato, a Colombo associate, not realizing that Fatato was a government informant and taping the conversation. Franzese told Fatato:Feds want jury to hear Sonny talk about mob murders\\" by Jerry Capeci The Huffington Post February 22, 2010 Franzese also told Fatato that he put nail polish on his fingertips before a murder to avoid leaving fingerprints at the crime scene. Franzese also suggested wearing a hairnet during the murder so as to avoid leaving any hair strands at the crime scene that could be DNA analyzed. Finally, Franzese stressed the importance of properly dealing with the corpse. His procedure was to dismember the corpse in a kiddie pool, dry the severed body parts in a microwave oven, and then run the parts through a commercial-grade garbage disposal. Franzese observed: Indictments and final sentence FBI surveillance photo of Franzese and his son John Franzese Jr. (right) in 2005.

According to law enforcement, Franzese remained the official underboss of the Colombo family. Franzese's son, John Franzese Jr. became a government informant. Franzese Jr. was allegedly also responsible for his father's fourth parole violation, but was accepted back into his confidence after denying the allegations in tears, saying, \\"I would never do that, no matter what kind of trouble I had.\\" In 2005, Franzese Jr. wore a wire around his father. John Franzese Jr. testified twice against his father, the last time his father attempted to have him killed; he later lived under witness protection. In 2010, Franzese Jr. admitted that he received $50,000 from the FBI as a cooperating witness. He is the first son of a New York mobster to turn state's evidence and testify against his father. Franzese had been dubbed \\"the Nodfather\\" for snoozing during his trial. With the help of Franzese Jr.'s testimony, the 93-year-old Franzese Sr., on January 14, 2011, was sentenced to eight years in prison for extorting two Manhattan strip clubs, running a loanshark operation and extorting a pizzeria on Long Island. Prosecutors had asked for a sentence of 12 years, while Franzese's lawyer asked for leniency based on a variety of ailments, including partial blindness and deafness, gout, and heart and kidney problems. Franzese was denied compassionate release in July 2016. Franzese was released from the Federal Medical Center in Devens, Massachusetts, on June 23, 2017, at the age of 100; he was the oldest federal inmate in the United States and the only centenarian in federal custody at the time of his release. That year also marked the end of Franzese's original 50 year sentence for bank robbery that was the cause of his many parole violations over the years. Movie business Franzese is listed as an associate producer of the 2003 film This Thing of Ours, which stars James Caan.\\"Law and Order; In the Can\\" , The New York Times, November 3, 2002 He also helped to finance the $22,000 budget of the 1972 pornographic film Deep Throat, which generated $30‚Äì50 million dollars, and the 1974 slasher film The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, which earned over $30 million from a $80,000‚Äì140,000 investment. Family and death Franzese was married to a woman, with whom he had three children. While married, John had gotten the 16-year-old Cristina Capobianco, a cigarette girl at the Stork Club in Manhattan, pregnant with his son Michael Franzese, so Capobianco married Frank Grillo to avoid having a scandal surrounding having a child out of wedlock. After the mob allowed John to divorce his first wife, Grillo disappeared, and he married Capobianco. Due to this, Michael had initially believed that he had been adopted by John after his mother divorced Grillo, who Michael thought to be his biological father. He had four more children with Capobianco. Cristina Capobianco-Franzese died in 2012. Franzese had eight children, 18 grandchildren and six great- grandchildren. Michael Franzese had entered a pre-med program in 1969 as John Franzese originally did not want him to be involved in organized crime. However, in 1971, Franzese decided to drop out of college to help his family earn money when his father was sentenced to 50 years in prison for bank robbery in 1967. After he was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 1986, Michael was ultimately released in 1994, retired to California in 1995, and became a born-again Christian. His younger son, John Franzese Jr., was a Colombo family associate before becoming an FBI informant. On June 23, 2017, Franzese was released and returned home.Gioino, Catherina and McShane, Larry (June 24, 2017). \\"Hundred-year-old mobster's daughter gushes over dad's freedom \\".

Envoy Draws on Her Past in Sierra Leone to Help Abused Women New York Times. Zainab Hawa Bangura was born \\"Zainab Hawa Sesay\\" in the small rural town of Yonibana, Tonkolili District in the Northern Province of British Sierra Leone. She hails from the Temne ethnic group. She was born into a family of limited means, and she attended secondary school on a scholarship that was awarded to her by the Mathora Girls Secondary School near Magburaka. She later attended the Annie Walsh Girls Secondary School in the capital city of Freetown. Then, after graduating from Sierra Leone's Fourah Bay College, Bangura moved to the United Kingdom for advanced diplomas in Insurance Management at the City University Business School of London and the University of Nottingham.Secretary-General Appoints Zainab Hawa Bangura of Sierra Leone Director-General, United Nations Office at Nairobi United Nations, press release of December 30, 2019. While in her early 30s, she became vice- president of one of her country's largest insurance companies. Bangura speaks three languages: Temne, Krio, and English. Public life =Early activism= Bangura became a social activist during the difficult period when Sierra Leone was ruled by the NPRC military junta. She began with consciousness-raising efforts among urban market women, reminding her followers that her own mother was a market woman. In 1994 she founded Women Organized for a Morally Enlightened Nation (W.O.M.E.N.), the first non- partisan women's rights group in the country. The following year she co- founded the Campaign for Good Governance (CGG). Then, using CGG as her platform, she campaigned for the holding of national elections that finally drove the NPRC from power in 1996 and restored democratic government. This was Sierra Leone's first democratic election in 25 years, and the Sierra Leonean media and the general public attributed that success largely to her efforts. During Sierra Leone's civil war (1991‚Äì2002) Bangura spoke out forcefully against the atrocities committed against the civilian population by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and was targeted for assassination several times by that group. She also spoke against the corruption in the civilian government of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah and the atrocities committed against civilians by government soldiers. In June 1997, as fighting engulfed the country, Bangura fled on a fishing boat to neighboring Guinea.Somini Sengupta (July 3, 2015), U.N. Envoy Draws on Her Past in Sierra Leone to Help Abused Women New York Times. =Political career= In the 2002 elections, Bangura ran against Kabbah for the presidency of Sierra Leone, departing for the first time from her accustomed role as a non-partisan civil society activist. She won less than one percent of the vote, and her Movement for Progress (MOP) party failed to gain any seats in Sierra Leone's parliament. Bangura claimed that her party's low vote count resulted from corruption in the voting system. After the 2002 elections Bangura founded the National Accountability Group (NAG) whose mission was to fight against official corruption and to promote transparency and accountability in government. In 2006 she left Sierra Leone for neighbouring Liberia where she was appointed Director of the Civil Affairs Office in the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) and given responsibility for the reconstruction of 16 Liberian ministries and 30 government agencies following that country's devastating civil war. Bangura returned to Sierra Leone in 2007 after Ernest Bai Koroma won the presidency in a hard-fought national election and was named foreign minister shortly thereafter. At the time, many Sierra Leoneans believed that the new president elevated this well known critic of government to such a high position to demonstrate his good faith in promising reform. As a devoted Muslim, Bangura took time off politics in 2009 to travel to the Holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia to participate in the 2009 Hajj pilgrimage ceremony. =Career in international politics= In 2012, Bangura served on the United Nations Commission on Life-Saving Commodities, which was jointly chaired by Goodluck Jonathan and Jens Stoltenberg, and issued recommendations to increase access to and use of 13 essential commodities for women‚Äôs and children‚Äôs health.Composition of the Commission Life-Saving Commodities Practitioners‚Äô Network. Bangura subsequently assumed her next position as Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict at the level of Under-Secretary-General on 4 September 2012. In this capacity, she also chaired the interagency network UN Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict.Zainab Bangura takes up position as Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict United Nations, press release of September 22, 2012. During her time in office, she helped launch an international protocol in 2014 for dealing with rape and sexual violence in conflict, providing guidelines on the investigation of sex crimes and the collection of evidence for future prosecutions.Harriet Sherwood (June 11, 2014), International protocol launched to deal with sexual violence in conflict The Guardian.

He learned at the age of 13 to officiate football games from watching pick-up games on the beach. His childhood idol was Armando Marques.  Career  After serving as a referee for lower level matches on the beach and in stadiums, dos Santos began refereeing bigger tournaments such as the 1988 Ta√ßa Guanabara. He was known for his \\"no-nonsense\\" style. He stated in an interview on 25 March 1988 with Placar that \\"I do not allow any type of indiscipline and demand respect.\\" Due to this reputation, dos Santos was respected by footballers and other referees. In the 1980s, dos Santos, V√°lter \\"Bianca\\" Senra, Paulino Rodrigues da Silva, and S√©rgio Cenedezi all faced scrutiny as the few openly gay referees of Brazil. In a 1988 match between Volta Redonda and Flamengo, dos Santos faced homophobic slurs from the crowd due to his perceived \\"effeminate physicality.\\" Dos Santos reflected in 1988: > ‚ÄúGood God! I‚Äôve been hearing that for 20 years, why would I only now give it > any weight?\\" He added: > ‚ÄúI acknowledged my sexuality to a prejudiced country, which is a hard thing > to do. Now if I happen to steal the show it‚Äôs because the game is boring.‚Äù Luiz Mott and dos Santos met in the late 1980s while recording a segment for Canal Livre. Notably, dos Santos' childhood idol Armando Marques aimed to remove gay referees from the Brazilian Football Confederation. According to The Advocate dos Santos would tell players, \\"I might be a pansy of the pitch, but here I'm a macho man.\\"  Personal life and legacy  Dos Santos was one of the first openly gay referees in Brazil. He died on 21 January 1995 from AIDS-related complications. Two days later, he was buried in Cemit√©rio de S√£o Jo√£o Batista wearing a black Brazilian Football Confederation shirt and flowers. He is recognized as an iconic figure in Brazilian football. Dos Santos is one of three role models for the character Margarida from referee Cl√©sio Moreira dos Santos on YouTube.

These names are also used in Laos to refer to the inhabitants of Vientiane or its descendants in Thailand. Many who are in fact Lao Wiang may only consider themselves Isan or Lao. History The Lao Wiang, as their name suggests, are descendants of Lao people from the Vientiane (Wiang Chan) region (Thai: ‡πÄ‡∏ß‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏á‡∏à‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏ó‡∏ô‡πå) in modern- day Laos. After the fall of Lanxang, the three successor kingdoms were overrun by Siam and forced population transfers by the Siamese into Isan were undertaken. Much of Isan was settled this way, and is one of the main reasons for the shared Lao culture of Laos and Isan.Setthakan, Krasuand. (1930). Siam: Nature and Industry. Bangkok: Bangkok Times Press, Ltd. Originally slaves and forced into providing corv√©e labour, the Lao Wiang were freed and integrated into the general Isan population. Culture The Lao Wiang are a sub-group of the general Isan (ethnic Lao of northeastern Thailand) distinguished from other Isan people by the location of their ancestors. Most have assumed either Thai or Isan identity, but some maintain their distinctiveness. Like their neighbours, they share Theravada Buddhism, Isan language, and rice farming, with only slight differences in traditional clothing and dialect.Hattaway, Paul. (2004).

International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology 58, 387‚Äì392. Lysobacter spp. were originally grouped with myxobacteria because they shared the distinctive trait of gliding motility, but they uniquely display a number of traits that distinguish them from other taxonomically and ecologically related microbes including high genomic G+C content (typically ranging between 65 and 72%) and the lack of flagella.Christensen, P., and F. Cook. 1978. Lysobacter, a new genus of nonfruiting, gliding bacteria with a high base ratio. International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology 28:367‚Äì393. The feature of gliding motility alone has piqued the interest of many, since the role of gliding bacteria in soil ecology is poorly understood. In addition, while a number of different mechanisms have been proposed for gliding motility among a wide range of bacterial species,McBride, M. J. 2001.

Habitat Lysobacter spp. have been described as ubiquitous inhabitants of soil and water. Their presence has been largely ignored, since members often are minor components in sample screenings when using conventional isolation procedures. However, because of improved molecular methods of identification and better descriptions for the genus, their agricultural relevance is becoming increasingly evident, especially as members of ecologically significant microbial communities associated with soil and plants.Sullivan, R.

Recent evidence suggests Lysobacter spp. may occupy a wide range of ecological niches beyond those associated with plants, including a broad range of 'extreme' environments. For example, 16S rDNA phylogenetic analyses show Lysobacter clades that include sequences obtained from hydrothermal vents, isolates from Mt. Pinatubo mud flows and upflow anaerobic blanket sludge reactors, and an iron-oxidizing, microaerophilic lithotroph.Folman, L. B., J. Postma, and J. A. van Veen. 2003.

Biological control The potential of Lysobacter species as biological control agents for plant diseases has been recognized recently. Among L. enzymogenes strains, C3 is the most thoroughly characterized strain at both the molecular and biological levels. The ecological versatility of the strain is reflected by the range of diseases it is able to control, as well as the various plant hosts and plant parts it is capable of colonizing. For example, L. enzymogenes strain C3 (erroneously identified as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) has been reported to control foliar diseases such as leaf spot of tall fescue caused by Bipolaris sorokiniana,Zhang, Z., and G.

SB-K88 has been found to suppress damping-off disease in sugar beet and spinach through antibiosis and characteristic root colonization in perpendicular fashion Islam et al. (2005). Disease-suppressive soils Lysobacter species have also been isolated from soils suppressive to Rhizoctonia solani.Postma, J., Schilder, M.T., Bloem, J., Van Leeuwen-Haagsma, W.K., 2008. Soil suppressiveness and functional diversity of the soil microflora in organic farming systems. Soil Biology and Biochemistry 40, 2394‚Äì2406. Clay soils with natural suppressiveness against Rhizoctonia contained higher numbers of antagonistic isolates of L. gummosus, L. antibioticus, and/or L. capsici. Although the mechanism behind this phenomenon is not yet understood, it appeared that growing grass/clover increased the number of these Lysobacter species, as well as the Rhizoctonia suppressiveness. Mechanisms of antagonism Originally characterized as a biological control agent for plant diseases, L. enzymogenes strain C3 is unique in that it expresses a wide range of mechanisms contributing to microbial antagonism and biological control that are not shared by all strains of the species. The strain produces numerous extracellular enzymes that contribute to biocontrol activity, including multiple forms of Œ≤-1,3-glucanases and chitinases.Zhang, Z., G. Y. Yuen, G. Sarath, and A. R. Penheiter. 2001. Chitinases from the plant disease biocontrol agent, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia C3. Phytopathology 91:204‚Äì211. The strain also has been demonstrated to induce systemic resistance in certain plants, protecting them from pathogen infection.Kilic-Ekici, O., and G. Y. Yuen. 2004.

Yuen. 2003. Induced resistance as a mechanism of biological control by Lysobacter enzymogenes strain C3. Phytopathology 93:1103‚Äì1110. In addition, recent studies have indicated important roles for secondary metabolites with antibiotic activity and biosurfactant activity in fungal antagonism.Kobayashi, D. Y., and G. Y. Yuen. 2005. The role of clp-regulated factors in antagonism against Magnaporthe poae and biological control of summer patch disease of Kentucky bluegrass by Lysobacter enzymogenes C3. Can J Microbiol 51:719-23. Several of these traits are globally controlled by a regulator encoded by the clp gene. Mutations in clp are intriguing for two reasons. First, the mutant phenotype implies that a broad range of genes is involved in secreted antimicrobials associated with the clp regulon, many of which remain unidentified. The second is that mutations in clp result in significant loss of extracellular enzyme activities and antimicrobial activity displayed by L. enzymogenes strain C3. These activities normally are phenotypically overwhelming and often lead to masking of other phenotypes in standard assays, making mutation effects of non-related genes difficult or nearly impossible to evaluate. However, strains harboring clp gene mutations provide a means to separate clp-regulated phenotypes from others (such as that describe below), thus making their evaluation feasible. Biological control and mode of actions of disease suppression by Lysobacter spp. has been reviewed Islam 2011. Lysobacter genetics L. enzymogenes strain C3 is a genetically tractable strain allowing for easy construction of gene knockouts, supporting its use as a model genetic system for unraveling the molecular basis of pathogenicity, as well as identifying mechanisms of microbial antagonism and biological control. Indeed, a number of derivative strains of L. enzymogenes strain C3 already have been constructed, including mutants affected in structural genes encoding enzyme activities, the regulatory clp gene and various combinations thereof.Palumbo, J. D., G. Y. Yuen, C. C. Jochum, K. Tatum, and D. Y. Kobayashi. 2005.

Later in his life, he was active in opposing the Civil rights movement. Born in Philadelphia, Butterworth aspired to be a singer from an early age. He took singing lessons and after graduating from Swarthmore High School as president of his class, made two singing tours in Canada and the eastern United States. (The collection is held at the University of Oregon Libraries, Special Collections and University Archives in Eugene, OR.) Butterworth auditioned for the role as an announcer for NBC radio in New York City in the early 1930s. He gained the job and was stationed in Chicago, Illinois. He covered the Chicago Civic Opera, the Symphony, football games and livestock parades. After a stint in the Navy, he was hired as the announcer of Vox Pop, but in 1936, co-host Jerry Belcher left the program, and Butterworth took over as host. In 1939, the show moved from NBC radio to CBS radio. His work on Vox Pop led Butterworth to host other quiz programs, some of which he created. This continued from the late 1930s until the early 1960s. Butterworth lost a lawsuit against General Electric over a contract for a television quiz show which he felt was directly modeled after one of his radio programs. The lawsuit between Butterworth and GE led him to become politically active. He broadcast a radio program in Atlanta on which he opposed the NAACP convention and attacked blacks, non-Christians and Catholics. The show was cancelled after being on the air for only two weeks, and the resulting lawsuit he filed against the radio station was unsuccessful. Around 1961, the Georgia offshoot of the Ku Klux Klan, the National Knights of the Ku Klux Klan used recordings narrated by Butterworth for promotion. With James Venable, Butterworth formed the Defensive Legion of Registered Americans in 1962. For its off-shoot, the Christian Voters and Buyers League, Butterworth narrated a series of spoken voice recordings promoting anti-Semitism, racism, and a boycott of Kosher products. Butterworth died in Pennsylvania on February 24, 1974.

Carleson in 1998 as a conservative counter to the American Civil Liberties Union. History Due to a lack of resources, the ACRU originally restricted itself to amicus briefs, having filed briefs in 15 cases by 2008. It expanded into writing on legal issues and having its spokespeople appear on talk radio and TV. When founder Carleson died in 2006, the Board of Directors elected to name his widow, Susan Carleson, a former Reagan administration official, Chairman and CEO. The ACRU filed its first amicus brief in Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, a case in which the Supreme Court decided that the Boy Scouts could not be legally forced to retain openly gay adult Scout leaders. Other issues include Bush v. Palm Beach County Canvassing Board in December 2000, the Mount Soledad cross controversy and other First Amendment cases, the District of Columbia v. Heller Second Amendment case and an Indiana voting-rights case regarding the use of photo ID. In 2010, the ACRU filed a brief arguing that the names of signers of a Washington state petition against gay marriage should not be published, likening gay rights activists to brownshirts. Leadership The ACRU is chaired by Susan A. Carleson who took on the leadership of the organization following the passing of her husband Robert B. Carleson in 2006.. Kenneth A. Klukowski is the ACRU General Counsel and Robert H. Knight is a Senior Fellow. The board of directors is chaired by Susan Carleson, it includes former Attorney General Ed Meese, and Morton Blackwell. The policy board initially included Robert Bork, Ed Meese, William Bradford Reynolds, Curtin Winsor and James Q. Wilson. It was later joined by Walter E. Williams and Kenneth W. Starr.

The signs read \\"yes humanitarian accord\\" \\"no bloody military rescue\\". The green frame simulates the concentration camps in which the hostages held by FARC are kept in the jungle. The Humanitarian Exchange or Humanitarian Accord () referred to a possible accord to exchange hostages for prisoners between the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrilla group and the Government of Colombia. The President of Colombia √Ålvaro Uribe and the FARC conditioned the agreement, which was primarily pushed by the families of the victims, certain Colombian politicians and numerous governments that include France and Venezuela. After years of combat in the Colombian armed conflict the FARC guerrilla group kidnapped numerous government officials, politicians and military and police personnel to pressure the release of their members jailed by the government.  Demands  The FARC guerrillas originally demanded that in order to proceed with the humanitarian exchange, the government must demilitarize a zone, which are the municipalities of Pradera and Florida in the southern Department of Valle del Cauca. The government of Colombia maintained that this is impossible and non- negotiable. However, after Ingrid Betancourt and three American contractors were rescued in July 2008, the FARC dropped that demand because they no longer had their most famous bargaining chips. The FARC guerrillas eventually dropped their prisoner exchange demand and released their last political hostages in April 2012. Early years The FARC began to kidnap in the early 1970s to obtain ransoms and maintain their operations. During the government of President Ernesto Samper the FARC began to kidnap high-profile government, political, military and law enforcement figures to push for the liberation of their comrades held in prisons by the government. The FARC assaulted numerous villages and military garrisons and captured hundreds of military and police personnel, for example, Jhon Frank Pinchao. Members of the government were also kidnapped ranging from senators like , presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt, 12 Valle del Cauca Deputies, 3 U.S. contractors who were working with Plan Colombia, among other cases. =Law of Exchange= During the presidency of Andr√©s Pastrana, the government and the FARC maintained a demilitarized zone in El Caguan in an attempt to negotiate the possibility of a peace process. The FARC freed 304 soldiers and policemen that were held to pressure the government.http://tvnz.co.nz/view/tvnz_smartphone_story_skin/45558 The Farc wanted to establish a permanent \\"Law of exchange\\" () which would facilitate the exchange of prisoners with hostages when necessary.  President Uribe and the United Nations  Colombian President √Ålvaro Uribe On August 7, 2002, √Ålvaro Uribe took oath as president of Colombia. On this same date Uribe announced that he had attempted to contact United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and asked him to mediate. Annan accepted but only if the two parties agreed. The negotiations through spokesmen started.  Gustavo Moncayo  On June 17, 2007, Professor Gustavo Moncayo, father of a soldier held by the FARC guerrillas since 1997, began to walk as protest from his hometown Sandon√°, in the department of Nari√±o, southern Colombia, to Bogot√°, seeking to promote an agreement for the release of his son Pablo Emilio.

Mediation by Hugo Ch√°vez President of Venezuela Hugo Ch√°vez was contacted by Colombian liberal senator Piedad C√≥rdoba to bargain a negotiation for the \\"humanitarian exchange\\". President Uribe authorized his mediation with the condition that the meetings between him and the FARC occurred in Venezuelan territory. On November 5, 2007, Ch√°vez announced that members of the Secretariat of the FARC (higher command) were in Venezuela. = Meeting with the FARC = On November 8, 2007, Ch√°vez met at the Palacio de Miraflores with alias \\"Iv√°n M√°rquez\\" one of the highest members of the FARC and members of its secretariat. M√°rquez is considered one of the most radical political leaders of the FARC.

The Yari is considered a historic enclave by the FARC, but after the military offensives of Plan Colombia and Plan Patriota these were pushed out from the area. The region of Yari is located within the Department of Vichada, near the border with Venezuela and Brazil. To these Ch√°vez publicly asked Uribe for the creation of the demilitarized zone. On November 19, 2007, President Ch√°vez, Senator Cordoba and President Sarkozy met in Paris with most of the media expecting videos proving that the kidnapped remained alive. President Uribe meanwhile announced that he had set up a limit for President Ch√°vez as negotiator for the humanitarian exchange until December 31, 2007. This, after Ch√°vez proposed a meeting between \\"Tiro Fijo\\" and President Uribe. Ch√°vez did not provide any evidence. =End of mediation by Hugo Ch√°vez= On November 22, 2007, President Uribe decided to end the mediation by President Ch√°vez and senator Cordoba after Ch√°vez decided to communicate directly with the higher command of the Colombian military. Uribe, in a private conversation, had warned Ch√°vez during the 17th Ibero-American Summit not to talk directly with members of the Colombian military without going through the chain of command and the proper diplomatic channels. Ch√°vez talked directly with the General of the Colombian National Army, Gen. Mario Montoya Uribe and asked him detailed information about the number of hostages in Colombia. He also asked the Colombian military to support the demilitarization of the municipalities of Pradera and Florida in the Department of Valle del Cauca. Ch√°vez supported the creation of the demilitarized area for an eventual reunion of him with Manuel Marulanda Velez. In a public address Ch√°vez then told Uribe that he would be open at any time to mediate again between the government and the FARC. The mediation duties in time were returned to Colombia's High Commissioner for Peace Luis Carlos Restrepo Ram√≠rez who thanked the mediation of President Ch√°vez and senator Cordoba. President Sarkozy asked Uribe to find alternative channel to negotiate. The exchange of words heated up between Uribe and Ch√°vez that led to suspension of Colombia-Venezuela relations. November 2007 videos On November 25, 2007, a video of CNP Captain Guillermo Sol√≥rzano surfaced and was published by the Latin American news network teleSUR. The video in an interview mode was done by Colombian reporter William Parra who later gave an excerpt to teleSUR. On November 30, 2007, the Colombian National Army captured three individuals pertaining to the FARC. The guerrillas had in their possession numerous thumb drives, videos and letters of the hostages held by FARC. The videos showed footage of Ingrid Betancourt, Vice First Sergeant Erasmo Romero, CNP Lieutenant Vianey Rodriguez Porras, CNP Private Julio C√©sar Buitrago and CNP Private Jairo Dur√°n Puerto dated from October 23‚Äì24, 2007. Another video showed the three U.S. contractors Marc Gonsalves, Keith Stansell and Thomas Howes, as well as Army Lieutenant Juan Carlos Bermeo, Corporal Jos√© Miguel Arteaga, Sub-Intendant of the CNP Armando Castellanos, Army LT. Raimundo Malag√≥n, Corporal William P√©rez Medina, Sergeant Jos√© Ricardo Marulanda and Corporal Armando Fl√≥rez Pantoja. There were seven letters; two from Thomas Howes, to Mariana Howes and a power of attorney letter. One letter from Mark Gonsalves to FARC leader \\"Mono Jojoy\\". Three letters from the Colombian army LT Raimundo Malag√≥n to Efra√≠n Malag√≥n, Stella Malag√≥n and Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez. And one from Ingrid Betancourt to her mother Yolanda Pulecio. El Tiempo: Gobierno revel√≥ pruebas de supervivencia de secuestrados en poder de las Farc DMZ proposal of President Uribe After the negative of President Sarkozy to negotiate directly between the two parts after President Uribe's proposal to do it, he publicly addressed the FARC to free Ingrid Betancourt and the hostages, he also added that the government was going to create a fund of a US$100 million and give it to those guerrillas who freed the hostages safely. Meanwhile, the children of Ingrid Betancourt were offered by Radio France Internationale (RFI) to make live radio addresses in Spanish to their mother every Monday, Tuesday and Friday mornings.Boston Globe: Betancourt's son sends message by radio President Uribe later added to this that he was still considering a military rescue. On December 8, 2007, President Uribe decided to allow a demilitarized zone (DMZ) in Colombia under certain conditions. That the DMZ should not be located near a densely populated area, no weapons inside the area and within a radius of 150 km¬≤. The proposal had been previously proposed by Uribe and the collaborating governments of France, Spain and Switzerland. =Support for proposal= Political parties including the main opposition party Alternative Democratic Pole (PDA) supported Uribe's idea of allowing the demilitarization. Alternative Democratic Pole: El Polo saluda decisi√≥n del Gobierno During the inauguration of Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner as President of Argentina most of the Latin American leaders present, including President Uribe, supported the formation of a common bloc to free the hostages in Colombia. These after President Kirchner met with Ingrid Betancourt's mother Yolanda Pulecio and French President Sarkozy had called for the support his idea of helping to free the hostages in Colombia. Fern√°ndez de Kirchner said \\"from now on we will collaborate in everything we can for the freedom of Ingrid Betancourt\\". President of Chile Michelle Bachelet said \\"what most worries her is the \\"deteriorated and dramatic\\" image of Ingrid Betancourt\\" and moved to support the call for the FARC to free the hostages. President of Ecuador Rafael Correa sent a message of solidarity to all the families of the hostages. He also mentioned that Colombia needed a solution for its armed conflict and said \\"the first step is to call for the inconditional release of all hostages, including Betancourt\\". Unilateral liberation of six hostages Clara Rojas On December 18, 2007, the FARC released a communique in which they reaffirmed their will to the municipalities of Florida and Pradera demilitarized for 45 days in order to exchange the hostages for prisoners. They also said that they would free three hostages Clara Rojas and her born in captivity son Emmanuel and former congresswoman Consuelo Gonz√°lez de Perdomo unilaterally. The FARC disagreed with President Uribe on creating a \\"Meeting area\\" and called the High Commissioner for Peace a liar. The FARC thanked publicly President Hugo Ch√°vez for his work as facilitator while it lasted and called the Colombian government's decision to end Ch√°vez' negotiation as \\"barbaric diplomacy\\". The Colombian government called to be prudent to FARC remarks. =Proposal of President Ch√°vez= President Ch√°vez proposed a humanitarian mission to rescue Clara Rojas, her son Emmanuel and Consuelo Gonz√°lez in Colombia with the permission of the Colombian government. Ch√°vez' plan was supported by the governments of Argentina, Brazil, France, Ecuador and Bolivia, as well as the Red Cross which will also participate of the operation. The mission consisted on flying Venezuelan aircraft labeled with the Red Cross insignia and into Colombia to an airport in the town of Villacicencio. Then resupply and from there reach the secret rescue point set up by the FARC.AP: Chavez: Colombia Hostages May Be Freed On December 26, 2007, the Colombian government through the Minister of Foreign Affairs approved the mission. On January 10, 2008, former vice presidential candidate Clara Rojas and former congresswoman Consuelo Gonzalez were freed after six years in captivity. It was also revealed that Emmanuel was already in a foster home, not with the FARC. On January 31, 2008, the FARC announced that they would release three civilian hostages , Gloria Polanco, and to Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez as a humanitarian gesture. All of them were kidnapped in 2001. On February 27, 2008, the three hostages and (who was added to the list due to his poor health) were released by FARC. With the authorization of the Colombian government and the participation of the International Red Cross, a Venezuelan helicopter transported them to Caracas from San Jose del Guaviare. Manos por la Paz A little know fact which could clearly hamper the possibility of the humanitarian agreement is that most FARC members currently held in Colombian prisons would rather demobilize and reintegrate back into Colombian society than rearm and go back to FARC. In order to advance their cause, they created a non-governmental organization called Manos por la Paz which is trying to advance this goal with the Colombian government. The government is currently offering a reintegration process which counts with over 40,000 persons demobilized from Colombia's various illegally armed groups, over 10,000 of which come from FARC. Furthermore, since January 2008 an average of almost 300 FARC combatants per month are abandoning FARC and entering the demobilization process out of their own will and volition. If this rate of desertion is maintained, by yearend 2009 it is estimated that no more than 1,000 - 1,500 armed persons will remain in FARC. What Manos is trying to do is to get its members out of Colombian prisons so that they may join their comrades in the reintegration process. More importantly, they are standing up to FARC because they feel that they should be asked if they want to return to that organization or whether they want to reenter normal life. No one seems to be asking them what they want.

Soldiers for the Truth claims a membership of 20,000 and publishes an online magazine called Defense Watch criticising the country's military leadership using information provided by active servicemen and women.Guardian obituary of D. H. Hackworth \\"Serving soldiers fed his website with information about the army's leadership shortcomings. Last February, he wrote, Most combat vets pick their fights carefully. They look at their scars, remember the madness and are always mindful of the fallout ... the White House and the Pentagon are run by civilians who have never sweated it out on a battlefield. \\" History and organization Soldiers for the Truth grew out of the regular opinion pieces written by David H.

Hackworth assessed the readiness level of most of the troops as follows: \\"I would be reluctant to jump into a battle zone with any conventional American unit. I would hate to take them into battle - they ain't ready, they are not 'good to go'.\\" He was also critical of the 'elite' troops who were expected to lead the assault.Guardian article: America's 'elite' troops \\"I hear a lot of rhetoric about the famous 10th Mountain Division. In World War II it was unquestionably America's finest unit - trained for three years, made up with men from Colorado, Montana, Idaho, really tough men, experts in mountain fighting. What we have now in the 10th Mountain Division is a bunch of kids that are better qualified to play computer games than they are to fight in that kind of terrain.\\" Hackworth has repeatedly stated the American military is weakened by a combination of senior officers who are primarily concerned about their own careers above the welfare and training of their troops, and a culture of misdirected and wasteful expenditure. In May 2004, the New York Times reported Mr William Lawson, the uncle of an Army reservist serving as a prison guard in Iraq, contacted SFTT by email on 23 March to express his frustration the guards would become scapegoats for the abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib, when Lawson himself believed the abuses were \\"evidence of a complete breakdown in training and authority in the Iraqi prison system\\". Lawson wrote in his email: \\"We have contacted the Red Cross, Congress both parties, Bill O'Reilly and many others. Nobody wants to touch this.\\" The staff at SFTT put Lawson in touch with researchers working for 60 Minutes II, which broadcast a documentary on the subject within five weeks.NY Times article In May 2007, incoming SFTT president John Falcon stated the Pentagon-approved \\"Interceptor\\" body armor, issued to US Marines serving in Iraq, did not provide adequate protection against armor-piercing bullets. Falcon said that according to a secret Pentagon report, 80% of marines killed due to torso wounds between 2003 and 2005 would have survived if they had been wearing adequate body armor. SFTT continues to campaign for soldiers to be issued with an allegedly tougher, more protective body armor called \\"Dragon Skin\\". Marines interviewed on the subject appreciated the group's campaign, saying, \\"Any time you get better equipment to the Marines, soldiers and sailors, it would make us that more dominant so it would be a good thing.\\"kiii TV - South Texas As of 2007, SFTT was preparing legal action to compel the Pentagon to acknowledge and assist Vietnam veterans who were exposed to the defoliant Agent Blue during the Vietnam War. The cause of Col. Hackworth's death was \\"a form of cancer now appearing with increasing frequency among Vietnam veterans exposed to the defoliants called Agents Orange and Blue\\".Col.

Cited at the first high performance ATC introduced , production began with an air-cooled, 248 cc single-cylinder two-stroke engine, but would see a liquid-cooled, 246 cc engine by 1985. All model years were fully suspended and adjustable, using air-assisted front forks and a single, remote reservoir gas-charged rear shock. 1981-1982 models offered 6.7 inches of front suspension travel and 4.3 inches in the rear, 1983-1984 offered 8.7 inches in front and 8.1 inches rear, while post-1985 Models allowed 9.8 inches of travel. All model years also used a gear-driven counter-balancer to reduce engine vibration. Dual disc brakes were used on all model years, with the exception of the 1981, which used a front disc and a rear drum. 1st Generation (1981-1982) The introduction of the 1981 ATC250R marked a milestone in off-road history, as it was the first two-stroke ATC designed specifically for racing. While ATC racing was in its infancy, racers had to rely on Honda's ATC110 and ATC185 models on the racetrack. Both of these four- stroke models were sluggish and poorly suspended when compared to the 2-stroke ATC250R, which borrowed heavily from the Honda CR250R motocross line. 2nd Generation (1983-1984) The 1983 ATC250R incorporated many improvements, introducing the Pro-Link suspension , folding foot pegs, a larger fuel tank, slightly longer travel suspension in front and rear. While the engine design remained similar, the Fuel delivery was increased from the previous 27 mm, to a 30 mm round-slide carburetor 3rd Generation (1985-1987) In 1985 the ATC250R was updated with a 246cc liquid cooled engine, and 6-speed transmission. This 2-stroke engine was notable for not incorporating a power- valve, featured commonly on other machines by 1985. Fuel was delivered via a 34 mm round carb in 1985 and flat slide carburetor for the remainder of production. This would be the last Generation offered for sale, discontinued in the United States in 1986, after an agreement between manufacturers and the Consumer Product Safety Commission to cease production on all 3-wheeled ATVs resulting from thousands of legal battles regarding safety issues and high accident rates. US Dealers were instructed to remove the motors and other common parts of remaining models, and then cut the frames in half to prevent new sales. The 1987 ATC250R models were released in limited numbers in Europe and Canada. While rumors persist that the 1987 Models were intended to feature new colors, a redesigned logo, and possibly keyed ignition, these models were virtually identical to the ‚Äò86 offering. Though sold concurrently, the Honda TRX250R would remain in the Honda line-up until 1989, effectively becoming the ATC‚Äôs successor. The four-wheeler used many of the same components as the ATC250R, including a slightly detuned version of the ATC‚Äôs engine. Competitive Racing Honda created the ATC250R as a consumer sport ATV, but would offer multiple variations to their factory racing teams in the 1980‚Äôs. These machines were designed for several displacement classes. The ATC125R, ATC200R, ATC300R, ATC350R, ATC400R, ATC480R, and ATC500R were all tested at various times during ATC production. The Honda ATC250R's competition came largely from the Kawasaki KXT Tecate 250 and Yamaha Tri-Z 250, and to a smaller extent from companies such as Tiger ATV. From in-house, the ATC250R is often compared to the Honda ATC350X, a sport ATC featuring a 350cc 4-stroke engine. The ATC350X was not competitive on professional circuits, and was better suited to amateur racing and recreational riding.

The Count-Duke of Olivares ordered Camilo to produce a series of paintings of Kings of Spain for the theater of Buenretiro. The Count-Duke also chose Camilo to adorn the western gallery of the palace with 14 frescoes from Ovid's Metamorphoses. Primarily a painter of religious works, Camilo painted for the monasteries of Madrid, Toledo, Alcal√°, and Segovia. He painted and draped some of the statuary of Manuel Pereyra.

Dispersants are widely used to stabilize all kinds of industrial and artisanal products, such as paints, ferrofluids, and salad dressings. The plasticizers or superplasticizers, used to improve the workability of pastes like concrete and clay, are typically dispersants. The concept also largely overlaps with that of detergent, used to bring oily contamination into water suspension, and of emulsifier, used to create homogeneous mixtures of non-miscible liquids like water and oil. Natural suspensions like milk and latex contain substances that act as dispersants. Applications =Automotive= Automotive engine oils contain both detergents and dispersants. Metallic-based detergents prevent the accumulation of varnish like deposits on the cylinder walls. They also neutralize acids. Dispersants maintain contaminants in suspension. Dispersants added to gasoline prevent the buildup of gummy residues. =Bio-dispersing= Dispersants are used to prevent formation of biofouling or biofilms in industrial processes. It is also possible to disperse bacterial slime and increase the efficiency of biocides. =Concrete and stucco= Dispersants are used as plasticizers or superplasticizers in concrete formulations to lower the use of water while retaining the needed slump (flow) property. A lower water contents makes the concrete stronger and more impervious to water penetration.Superplasticizers . Fhwa.dot.gov. Retrieved on 2010-10-27. Similarly, dispersants are used as plasticizers in the gypsum slurry during wallboard manufacture, to reduce the amount of water used. The lower water usage allows lower energy use to dry the wallboard.Gypsum wallboard, and method of making same - Patent 5879446. Freepatentsonline.com. Retrieved on 2010-10-27. =Detergents= Dispersing is the principal goal in the use of detergents, which the liquid bath is water (detergents also are used as emulsifiers in some applications). Laundry detergents encase dirt and grime in miscelles, which naturally disperse. =Oil drilling= Dispersants in oil drilling aid in breaking up solids or liquids as fine particles or droplets into another medium. This term is often applied incorrectly to clay deflocculants. Clay dispersants prevent formation of \\"fish-eye\\" globules. For dispersing (emulsification) of oil into water (or water into oils), surfactants selected on the basis of hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) number can be used. For foam drilling fluids, synthetic detergents and soaps are used, along with polymers, to disperse foam bubbles into the air or gas. =Oil spill= Dispersants can be used to dissipate oil slicks. They may rapidly disperse large amounts of certain oil types from the sea surface by transferring it into the water column. They will cause the oil slick to break up and form water-soluble micelles that are rapidly diluted. Then effectively spread throughout a larger volume of water than the surface from where the oil was dispersed. They can also delay the formation of persistent oil-in-water emulsions. However, laboratory experiments showed that dispersants increased toxic hydrocarbon levels in fish by a factor of up to 100 and may kill fish eggs. Dispersant was used in an attempt to clean up the Exxon Valdez oil spill though its use was discontinued as there was not enough wave action to mix the dispersant with the oil in the water. Dispersant Corexit 9500 was used on the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Dispersant Corexit 9527 was used to disperse an oil slick in the Gulf of Mexico in 1979 (Ixtoc), used over one thousand square miles of sea. =Process industry= In the process industry dispersing agents are added to process liquids to prevent unwanted deposits by keeping them finely dispersed. They function in both aqueous and nonaqueous media. =Surface coating= In order to provide optimal performance, pigment particles must act independently of each other in the coating film and thus must remain well dispersed throughout manufacture, storage, application, and film formation. Unfortunately, colloidal dispersions such as the pigment dispersions in liquid coatings are inherently unstable, and they must be stabilized against the flocculation that might occur.

Ibovi was born in Edou, located in the Oyo District of Cuvette Region, in the north of the country; Edou is also the birthplace of President Denis Sassou Nguesso. He studied journalism in the Soviet Union in the 1970s; after returning, he became a leader of the Union of Congolese Socialist Youth and joined the Congolese Labour Party (PCT) in 1977. He worked on national television as a journalist during the 1980s, and he was first elected to the National Assembly in the June-July 1992 parliamentary election as a candidate in Oyo constituency.Philippe Perdrix, \\"Fran√ßois Ibovi\\", Jeune Afrique, 15 May 2005 .

The elections held in 2002 concluded the transitional process begun in 1997, and Sassou Nguesso formally declared that the transition was over on 9 August 2002. On that occasion, Ibovi said that conditions in Congo- Brazzaville had improved greatly since 1997, progressing from a \\"chaotic situation ... to a calm and livable country\\".Louis Okamba, \\"Congo: Democratic rule restored\\", Associated Press, 9 August 2002. Ibovi remained in the government after the election; on 18 August 2002, he was appointed as Minister of Territorial Administration and Decentralization,\\"Old guard, new guard\\", Africa Confidential, volume 43, number 17, 30 August 2002.Okamba, La gouvernance, une affaire de soci√©t√©, page 179 . in which position he served for over five years.\\"L√©ger remaniement du gouvernement\\", Xinhua, 31 December 2007 . Criticism of problems in the conduct of the first round of the June- August 2007 parliamentary election led Ibovi to suspend the Director General for Electoral Affairs, Armand Baboutila, on 28 June 2007 for alleged negligence in the handling of the election;\\"Congo: un opposant demande l'annulation du premier tour des l√©gislatives\\", Agence France-Presse, 29 June 2007 .\\"Top election chief sacked after poll chaos\\", Agence France-Presse, 28 June 2007. he appointed Gaston Ololo in Baboutila's place for the second round of the election. Herv√© Ambroise Malonga, acting as spokesman for parties calling for a boycott of the election, said that higher level officials should take responsibility and called for the resignation of Ibovi and the president of the electoral commission.

Having been elected to a post in the Bureau of the National Assembly, it was inevitable that Ibovi would be dismissed from his powerful post in the government; some believed that President Sassou Nguesso was demoting Ibovi as punishment for his widely criticized management of the election.R√©my Bazenguissa-Ganga, \\"Congo\\", in Africa Yearbook: Politics, Economy and Society South of the Sahara in 2007 (2008), eds.

The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the somatotropin/prolactin family of hormones that play an important role in growth control. The gene, along with four other related genes, is located at the growth hormone locus on chromosome 17 where they are interspersed in the same transcriptional orientation, an arrangement thought to have evolved by a series of gene duplications. The five genes share a remarkably high degree of sequence identity. Alternative splicing generates additional isoforms of each of the five growth hormones, leading to further diversity and potential for specialization. This particular family member is expressed in the pituitary but not in placental tissue as is the case for the other four genes in the growth hormone locus.

It helped establish Taniguchi's reputation for action film. Taniguchi and Wakayama married in 1949 (he had earlier been married to the screenwriter Y≈çko Mizuki), but the couple divorced in 1956. Taniguchi married his third wife, actress Kaoru Yachigusa, in 1957. Yachigusa and Taniguchi remained together for over fifty years until his death in 2007. Taniguchi was the screenwriter for the 1949 film, The Quiet Duel, which Kurosawa directed and which also starred Mifune. His most acclaimed film as a director was Escape at Dawn, a controversial anti-war work from 1950 about a Japanese soldier and a \\"comfort woman\\" that got into trouble with Occupation era censors. Taniguchi continued to direct movies throughout the 1950s and 1960s, but the quality of his work declined. His films from the time period include Man Against Man, The Gambling Samurai, Man In The Storm and The Lost World of Sinbad. His 1965 film International Secret Police: Key of Keys has been famously re-dubbed and re-released as What's Up, Tiger Lily? by Woody Allen. He was chosen as the supervising director of the official documentary of Expo '70. Senkichi Taniguchi died of pneumonia at a hospital in Tokyo, Japan, on October 29, 2007, at the age of 95.

The series was first broadcast in 2003 on China Central Television in mainland China. Due to the success of The Story of a Noble Family (the writer was from Fenghuang County, Hunan), the major cast members were designated as \\"Honorary Citizens\\" of Fenghuang County. Synopsis Jin Yanxi, a young man from a noble and influential family, falls in love with a girl named Leng Qingqiu, who comes from a poor but scholarly background. They continue to date even though the difference in their respective social statuses prevents them from being together. Bai Xiuzhu, a girl from another affluent family, also falls in love with Yanxi, who rejects her and goes on to marry Qingqiu. However, Yanxi's restlessness, spoilt personality and boredom of life after marriage prompts him to have an extramarital affair with Xiuzhu. He eventually becomes distant from Qingqiu and plans on leaving her and his newborn son so that he can accompany Xiuzhu to Germany. When the house in which Qingqiu and his son lives catches fire, Yanxi, who couldn't find them, believes his wife and son have died and collapses in sorrow and regret. After the fire, Yanxi receives a final letter from Xiuzhu saying she has left for Germany without him, to marry someone else. Yanxi leaves for the train station and imagines himself finding Qingqiu and hugging her. Unbeknownst to Yanxi, Qingqiu and their son actually survived the fire and is actually near him on a southbound train. Yanxi boards a train heading in the opposite direction after seeing that there is nothing left for him at home (his family is breaking up since his father had been robbed of his wealth and had died). The once loving couple now part ways and is unknown whether they ever reunite.

Sodium bicarbonate rockets are often used in science classes to demonstrate principles of chemistry and physics. In the experiment, a film canister is filled with water, an effervescent tablet (commonly Alka- Seltzer) is added and the canister tightly sealed. After a short time, the pressure of the carbon dioxide is great enough to cause the body of the canister to be launched into the air with a popping sound. The canister may be embellished with paper fins to resemble more closely a real rocket. Various experiments and lessons can center around the use of a bicarbonate rocket. For example, students are sometimes asked to experiment with the amounts of water and Alka-Seltzer to find the combination which propels the rocket the greatest distance. Alternatively they may derive equations to calculate the speed and velocity of the rocket from the distance it travels. In rocketry, a chemical reaction rapidly creates gas that is expelled in one direction from its container (the rocket engine); momentum forces the rocket in the opposite direction. The alka-seltzer rocket experiment demonstrates Newton's third law. The film canister rocket has a buildup of gas that wants to come out of the weakest spot making all the gas come out at once through the hole at the bottom. The gas comes out from the underside and pushes the rocket up. After it gets pushed up, air resistance slows it down and gravity pulls it down to earth. The film canister accelerates quickly because it has very little mass. The film canister rocket uses a solid fuel mixed with a liquid fuel to create a gas that escapes out of the bottom. The gas is carbon dioxide (CO2), the liquid is water (H2O), and the solid is an effervescent tablet. When the H2O is mixed with an effervescent tablet, it produces the gas CO2. The reaction time depends on the surface area of the tablet.

Plot summary The scene is set in an unspecified future, in an apparently sterile and clinical building. There is music coming from every direction; each person, it seems, is listening to music, talking on a phone, using an intercom, or communicating constantly in some other way. Most people seem to be engaged in several of these activities at the same time. A psychologist exits the noisy environment to confront a patient confined to a small safe-room. The psychologist notes that its patient has ripped the radio out of the wall to silence it. The room seems unnaturally quiet to the psychologist, yet the patient seems perfectly at ease, even happy. The patient, Albert Brock, calls himself 'The Murderer', and demonstrates his murderous ability by destroying the psychologist's wrist radio. Questioning reveals that the man had one day been driven mad by the constant expectations of communication inflicted upon him by society- his wife and children could speak with him whenever they wished, wherever they were; any person could call on him, and many did, simply to make use of their communications devices. He gives a striking image of a world in which humans are constantly bombarded by music, advertisement, propaganda and communication. He then describes his revelation; that if he shut off his phone, he could not be bothered by it. When he arrived home on that day, he discovered his wife, frantic at being out of touch with him for so long. This apparently drives home to him their terrible addiction to technology of communication. He begins to destroy things - his phone, his wrist radio, the televisor, any thing that could disrupt the peace he seeks. The man regrets only destroying the Insinkerator, which he used to mangle another piece of equipment. The Insinkerator, a sink drain disposal, he says, was a machine with a good solid purpose which did not disturb him with its functions, did not demand his attention, which only functioned when he asked it to. The man then describes his wonderful state of calm and relaxation, moments of total freedom of all responsibility and worry inflicted upon him by machines. The psychiatrist makes due note of this, prompting him with questions, even seeming to perhaps understand what the man feels. At the end of The Murderer's tale, however, the psychologist steps back into the world of music and talk, quickly relaying information on the man's condition to an aide over another communication device, and re-immerses himself into the glare of technology's power. Adaptations When Bradbury re-worked this story for his TV program The Ray Bradbury Theater, he changed the ending of the story. In the revised version, the psychologist returns to his office and, barraged by noise and electronics, destroys his newly replaced \\"lapel phone\\" and asks his secretary for a chocolate milkshake (to pour into his fax machine). The story was adapted as a dark comedy/musical one-act play, marking the first collaboration of actor/writer Christian Scheider and artist Tucker Marder. It first premiered in August 2013 in Sag Harbor, NY. The cast consisted of Christian Scheider (The Murderer), Madeline Wise (The Psychiatrist), and Britt Mosley (Technology). The Production was directed by Tucker Marder.

The ship was placed in reserve upon her completion in 1888 and was converted into a submarine depot ship in 1903. She was sold out of the navy in 1920 and was purchased by a South African businessman to serve as a training ship for naval cadets under the name SATS General Botha. The ship arrived in South Africa in 1921 and began training her first class of cadets in Simon's Town the following year. General Botha continued to train cadets for the first several years of World War II, but the RN took over the ship in 1942 for use as an accommodation ship under her original name. She was scuttled by gunfire in 1947 and is now a diveable wreck. Design and description The Mersey- class cruisers were improved versions of the Leander class with more armour and no sailing rig on a smaller displacement. Like their predecessors, they were intended to protect British shipping.Gardiner, pp. 106‚Äì07 The cruisers had a length between perpendiculars of , a beam of and a draught of .Friedman, p. 333 They displaced . The ships were powered by a pair of two-cylinder horizontal, direct-acting, compound-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft, which were designed to produce a total of and a maximum speed of using steam provided by a dozen cylindrical boilers with forced draught. The Mersey class carried enough coal to give them a range of at a speed of . The ships' complement was 300Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 75 to 350 officers and ratings. Their main armament consisted of two breech-loading (BL) guns, one each fore and aft on pivot mounts. Their secondary armament was ten BL guns, five on each broadside in sponsons. Protection against torpedo boats was provided by three quick-firing (QF) 6-pounder Hotchkiss guns and three QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns. The ship was also armed with a pair of submerged 14-inch (356 mm) torpedo tubes and carried a pair of 14-inch torpedo carriages. The Mersey- class ships were protected by a lower armoured deck that was on the flat and on the slope. It sloped down at the bow to reinforce the ram. The armoured sides of the conning tower were thick. Construction and career Thames was the sixth ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy.Colledge, p. 348 She was laid down on 14 April 1884 by Pembroke Dockyard in No. 4 slipway. The ship was launched on 3 December 1885 by the Hon. Mrs. Algernon Littleton and completed in July 1889Winfield & Lyon, p. 271 at a cost of ¬£204,952. The ship went straight into reserve at Devonport after completion.Phillips, p. 230 On 21 March 1902 she was temporarily commissioned by Captain H. L. Fleet, with crewmen from the battleship , to serve as a port guard ship at Queenstown, while the latter ship was undergoing alterations. In 1903, the ship was converted to a submarine tender and served at Sheerness from 1907 to 1917 and then briefly at Portsmouth and Campbeltown, Scotland, before being paid off in 1919 at Chatham Dockyard. =South Africa= General Botha in 1925 She was sold for ¬£8,000 in November 1920 to the Jersey-born South African entrepreneur T. B. Davis as a memory to his son who died during World War I. Later that month, the ship steamed to West India Dock, Tilbury, for a brief refit and Thames was renamed Training Ship (TS) General Botha, after Louis Botha, the first Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa. Before departing for Plymouth for extra crewmen on 6 January 1921, the ship was visited by Sir Reginald Blanckenberg, High Commissioner for South Africa, and his wife. She set sail from Plymouth on 18 January and ran into a heavy storm in the English Channel that smashed in the inadequately boarded-up sponsons and forced the ship to turn about for Plymouth for repairs where General Botha arrived two days later. The ship departed on 8 February and arrived in Cape Town on 26 March where she was greeted by the Minister of Defence, Colonel Hendrik Mentz and other notables.Grutter, pp. 7‚Äì9 Davis donated it to a trust on 9 May, with the stipulation that it be used exclusively for the nautical training of British and South African boys, so that they could subsequently serve in ships of the British Empire. The Admiralty agreed to cover the cost to convert General Botha into a training ship at Simon's Town Naval Dockyard and to tow her there from Cape Town in early September. It also agreed to grant the ship a mooring in Simon's Town. The first class of 75 boys reported aboard on 15 March 1922 on a two-year programme and the ship was formally christened as South African Training Ship (SATS) General Botha on 1 April by the wife of the Prime Minister, Jan Smuts. On 15 December, King George V agreed to become the ship's patron and sponsored an annual gold medal for the best cadet aboard. On 2 May 1925, Edward, Prince of Wales, inspected the boys and the ship. About a month later, she was docked to have her engines and funnel removed and her interior remodelled to create new messdecks, galleys and recreation spaces, returning to her moorings in August. In March 1935, Davis offered to sponsor a rowing competition between the cadets of General Botha and the British training ships, HMS Worcester, and HMS Conway in Britain and paid for their expenses to and from South Africa. King George V received the cadets in Buckingham Palace on 29 June shortly before the race during which they beat the cadets from Conway, but lost to Worcester. By the late 1930s, General Bothas guns and boilers had been removed and the former engine and boiler rooms converted into a gymnasium.Grutter, pp. 10‚Äì27, 31, 73‚Äì75, 77 Memorial in Cape Town for SATS General Botha graduates who died during World War II The trust's Board of Control offered the ship to the RN with 30 days notice on 7 September 1939, the day after South Africa declared war on Germany, but the offer was declined. Nevertheless, they decided to build accommodations for the cadets ashore if the RN did decide to take them up on their offer. The RN did so in July 1942 and the boys and staff went ashore on the 28th and the ship resumed her former name shortly afterwards. She served as an accommodation ship and was used as a prison ship for at least part of her time in RN service. By the time that the RN returned her to the Board of Control, the ship was deemed uneconomical to repair and she was scuttled by gunfire from one of the local coast defence battery on 13 May 1947 in False Bay at coordinates .Grutter, pp. 81, 86‚Äì87 There exists an alumni association for those who served aboard General Botha, which has the Duke of Edinburgh as her patron.

The short-lived play ran only 10 performances and is best remembered today for the fact that each night Brando would run up and down a flight of stairs prior to an entrance to induce an effectively frenzied demeanor for one of the scenes. The cast also included David Manners, to whom Brando has attributed much of his subsequent success, and Kevin McCarthy. The play is noted for Brando's first major appearance on Broadway, during which he garnered attention for an unusually intense performance which presaged his later work on A Streetcar Named Desire. Truckline Cafe is also notable for being the first collaboration between Brando and Kazan, who later made A Streetcar Named Desire, Viva Zapata, and On the Waterfront together. The play also remains notable for being the first time Brando and Malden worked together, prior to co-starring in A Streetcar Named Desire, On the Waterfront, and One Eyed Jacks. From the May 1, 2007 issue of Slate Magazine, Troy Patterson notes in a review of a Turner Classic Movies documentary about Brando: The film spends a happily ample sum of time on Truckline Caf√©, which was Brando's Broadway breakthrough, and contextualizes the triumph of Streetcar better than Brando's own autobiography. From the July 7‚Äì13, 2004 edition of The Villager: In ‚ÄúBroadway: The Golden Age,‚Äù a stirring documentary film by Rick McKay, that fine actor Charles Durning says of his first sight of Brando (in ‚ÄúTruckline Cafe‚Äù): ‚ÄúI thought [he was a] guy they pulled in off the street. Too good to be an actor.‚Äù Time Magazine reported that the reviews were so lacerating (the New York Daily News' John Chapman called it \\"the worst play I have seen since I have been in the reviewing business\\") that Clurman and Kazan took out and ad in the New York Times stating in part: \\"Our theater is strangled in a bottleneck . . . made up of a group of men who are hired to report the events of our stage and who more and more are acquiring powers which, as a group, they are not qualified to exercise ‚Äî either by their training or their taste. . . . No opposition point of view is ever expressed. There is a blackout of all taste except the taste of these men.\\" Meanwhile, playwright Anderson mounted an ad in the New York Herald Tribune: \\"It is an insult to our theater that there should be so many incompetents and irresponsibles among [the reviewers]. ...

The story was published during the Cold War, and serves as an allegory to the nuclear arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union. Plot summary The story, set in China, begins in a small pastoral town or village, apparently in a time or place where trade and agriculture are still the norm. There is little in the way of modern technology; no electricity, automobile or advanced irrigation. Superstition is also rampant. The town is described as being in a desert area, and within the vicinity of another, called Kwan-Si. The inhabitants of the town the story is set in are prone to describe their town to be in the shape of an orange, defined by the city walls. One day, a messenger comes to the Mandarin, or king, to inform him that the neighboring town has changed the shape of their walls to a pig ‚Äì such that it would be interpreted by travelers as being about to eat the orange-shaped town. The messenger and the king discuss frantically how this will bring them ill luck ‚Äì travelers would stay in and trade with the other town, and nature will favor the pig over the orange. Advised by his daughter, who stands behind a silken screen to hide herself, the king decides to have the town walls rebuilt to resemble a club, with which to beat the pig away. All is well in the town for a time, but soon the messenger brings news that Kwan-Si's walls have been reshaped as a bonfire to burn their club. The Mandarin of the first town has the walls changed to a shining lake; Kwan-Si's are changed to Mouth to drink the lake; the Mandarin's changed to a needle to sew the mouth; Kwan-Si's to a sword to break the needle. This goes on for quite some time, driving the cities' inhabitants away from their work at farms or in shops to fruitlessly rebuild the walls and wait for the other's response. Disease and famine are rampant. At last, the voice behind the silk screen, advising the Mandarin, says weakly \\"In the Name of the gods, send for Kwan-Si!\\" The two Mandarins, both starved and ailing, agree to stop their feud of superstition. The first Mandarin's daughter shows the men several kites, lying abandoned on the ground. 'What are kites,' she asks, 'without the wind to sustain them and make them beautiful?' Nothing, they agree. 'And what is the sky, without kites upon its face to make it beautiful?' Again, it is Nothing. Thus, she directs that Kwan-Si shall make itself to resemble the Silver Wind, and her town shall be made to resemble a Golden Kite, such that the two should sustain each other and they could live in peace. The kite is representing the wind.

Chicago Breaking Sports. April 21, 2010. Retrieved on August 5, 2010. Biography McCaskey, son of current Bears principal owner Virginia Halas McCaskey and former Chicago Bears chairman Ed McCaskey, was the oldest grandchild of George Halas. He became president of the Bears in 1983 after Halas' death. McCaskey held that post until 1999, when he succeeded his father Ed as Chairman of the Board until 2011. He was the brother of current Bears Chairman George McCaskey. McCaskey frequently clashed with Mike Ditka, who had been hired by Halas, but the volatile coach retained his job with an extension in 1984; the Bears won Super Bowl XX the following season, while McCaskey was named Sporting News executive of the year, the first Bears executive to receive the honor since Halas in 1956. McCaskey finally fired Ditka after a losing season in 1992. Ditka's replacement was McCaskey's first coaching hire, Dave Wannstedt, who was a heavily-sought-after candidate by several teams. However, after a 1994 playoff appearance, the Bears posted more losing seasons; Wannstedt was fired after the 1998 season and, after a botched hiring of Dave McGinnis, McCaskey was stripped of much of his operational responsibilities and limited to the position of chairman of the board. McCaskey was an alumnus of the Weatherhead School of Management, at Case Western Reserve University. He served in the Peace Corps in Ethiopia and taught at the business schools at UCLA and Harvard University prior to becoming president of the Bears. McCaskey was also a member of the Yale College Class of 1965 and lettered in football there.2003 Yale Football Media Guide He died on May 16, 2020, after suffering from cancer \\"for a considerable time\\".

Gordon Smith with his prototype closed circuit rebreather Gordon Smith, Inventor (1995 image) Professional history Gordon Smith was trained as a tool and die maker at C. A. Norgren, Littleton, Colorado. He returned to Canada in 1975 and went to work for Comptec International Ltd., a two color molding company, in Vancouver, British Columbia. Gordon Smith spent fourteen years at Comptec and moved from the position of Mold Maker to become manager of the Tooling, Engineering, and R&D; departments. During this period he was responsible for increasing the machine operator output by a factor of 6. He also helped move Comptec into the telecommunications business and developed production systems for assembly of telephones which are in use today by almost every major telephone manufacturer in the world. Gordon Smith left Comptec in 1989 to start Kiss Manufacturing. In the late 1990s Gordon invented and began producing the KISS line of diving rebreathers under the Jetsam Technologies name. KISS Rebreather development Gordon's was an avid scuba diver in the Pacific Northwest, diving all around British Columbia in his boat \\"Ferrous\\". In the mid-nineties, technical diving became a movement which provided some background on some commercially available rebreathers - very expensive and challenging to obtain at the time. Gordon was interested in the technology, and also in simply not finding his dives limited by the size of his tanks (generally consuming two tanks for every regular divers one). As a self-taught man and being the owner of his own machine shop, he had the means and technical ability to begin exploring the design and construction of his own rebreathers. There were virtually no certification agencies that could address non-military rebreathers and certainly no clear path forward towards acceptance of their use in recreational diving. For example, few charters at the time had the ability or the experience to accommodate rebreather divers (often relying upon live boats following bubble streams and with a business model based upon dives lasting under one hour). However, because Gordon's initial aim was simply restricted to diving on his own boat with individuals of his choosing he was able to proceed with developing these experimental devices without the burden and limitations of (self) regulatory considerations. The first attempt in 1998 was a novel approach, with a unique piston serving as counterlungs rather than the conventional flexible bags. The approach was intended to use tank pressure to compensate for the o-ring friction and inertia of the displacing water. Although the o-ring friction in air was acceptable, the model could not handle the inertia of the necessary water displacement. The prototype suffered from excessive work of breathing and did not pass test of surface breathing while submerged for even a few minutes. It got him started however, and nevertheless had the dubious description of \\"looking like R2D2 making love to an octopus\\" according to Gordon. His next prototype was a semi-closed design again, but this time with more conventional flexible counterlungs. This worked very successfully, and was dove for many months. However, with the experience he gained with the semi-closed designs, he saw that the fully closed system was certainly feasible and much more desirable in terms of performance. He quickly decided upon the merit of including an oxygen sensor due to the risk of inadvertent hypoxia if required to exercise at the surface. One of his innovations early on was the bailout-integrated mouthpiece, switching immediately to diluent for short term open-circuit operation in an emergency or even just upon entering the water. He also incorporated a regulator to prevent negative loop pressure should the counterlungs become fully deflated upon descent. Gordon devised his fully closed rebreather system in 1998. One of his key contributions was to realize that the formidable electronics engineering required to automate control of the loop partial pressure of oxygen was neither required nor necessarily the best way to minimise the risk of hypoxia or hyperoxia. Instead, a constant mass flow orifice injected oxygen continually at a rate slightly under the divers basal metabolic rate - requiring only periodic top-ups by the diver. This was the KISS principle, the philosophy by which the diver was counter-intuitively made safer by removing electronic protections. Specifically, design philosophy was that the knowledge that the diver was the one and only thing controlling the loop oxygen level meant that attention was required and would be applied. This avoided the human tendency to eventually neglect to monitor the machine-controlled process outputs, which work seamlessly until there is a failure or mistake (whether software bug, miscalibration or other issue) and then cause an accident. In practice, the constant mass flow of oxygen meant that partial pressures changed so slowly that this form of manual control was actually very feasible and only required checking every few minutes (more often during exercise and when close to the surface perhaps). He developed a successful prototype, initially using two oxygen sensors in two separate larger blocks. With the availability of miniature readouts, he advanced the design to use a triple oxygen sensor system in order to allow there to be a \\"voting ability\\" for which sensor was malfunctioning if there was an error in one. He continued to innovate, including at one time experimenting with a \\"hands-free\\" tongue-based oxygen injection system he wryly called the \\"snog valve\\". He then perfected the system over several years, building further prototype units that were test dived by friends Natasha Dickinson and Daniel Reinders. In time he came to see the potential for commercial sales of the system, and began Jetsam technologies. Over time, he would begin to explore also a smaller recreational-sized version of the KISS rebreather as well. He also pursued a pneutmatic air compressor system for rebreathers, whereby partially full standard scuba tanks could be used to top-up the smaller rebreather tanks without the need for a motorized compressor.

He became well known for his paintings of Algiers and other parts of Africa, as orientalism was a trend during this time period in American history.  Early life  \\"Cy\\" Farnum, as he was more generally known, was a son of Cyrus A. and Mary (Eddy) Farnum. He was a descendant from old New England settlers who trace their history to RalphFarnum, Ralph (~1603 - 1683) - male b.

The first of the name to settle in Rhode Island was John Farnum, a grandson of Ralph the immigrant, who moved from Uxbridge, Massachusetts to Georgiaville, Rhode Island. in 1755. As a boy he gave evidence of the great talent that he later developed as an artist.  Education  Boy with a Fish He was a pupil of the Rhode Island School of Design. Farnum studied at the Academie Julian in Paris under Jean-Paul Laurens and (Benjamin) Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant where he won several awards for drawings. He also studied at Acad√©mie Colarossi in the evening, studying figure drawing under Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me and Castaigne. He also had the advantage of criticism from Adolphe William Bouguereau. His most remarkable canvas of that period was his \\"Tarantella\\".  Career  On July 21, 1896, a large landscape entitled \\"Piccolo Piazza, Ana Capri\\" was accepted by the Royal Academy of Arts, London, a distinction accorded few American artists. He returned abroad in April, 1904, when he was absent for 2 years which he spent in London, Paris and then in Madrid and Algiers and later spent considerable time in Italy, with special stay at Capri. He belonged in the group of late 19th- and early 20th-century artists in Rhode Island, and for years his studio in Butler Exchange was an important art centre in the city of Providence. He painted many portraits of local politicians while occupying this studio. After pursuing his art studies in Paris he spent many years in travel and study abroad, following in the footsteps of Marcus Waterman, also a noted RI artist, in Northern Africa, winning a wide reputation for his African subjects. He also painted a number of official portraits for city and state, some of which still hang in the RI state house and the city hall. A number of lovely studies of children, notably of his nephew, Earl F. C. Farnum, and his daughter, Elodie Farnum, the musical genius whose death at an early age was a great blow to him.  Personal life  The Club Carollion He was married twice. His first wife was Alice Leigh of Fall River, Massachusetts, to whom he was married in 1898 in Chelsea. To them was born one child, a daughter, Elodie, who gave great promise of becoming a violinist of distinction and was looked upon as one of the most remarkable girls in the city. Her death in 1914 was a tragedy in the artist's life. His wife, inseparable companion of his daughter, failed gradually in health after her child's death and died in December, 1920. The memory of young Elodie Farnum, as well as her portrait by the artist, survives in the library at the Rochambeau branch of the Providence public library. He was a prominent figure in RI cycling history, was a veteran member of the RI wheelmen and rated high as a road and track rider. He was captain of the club for many years. In his later years he maintained his studio at his home on Fruit Hill section of North Providence. He was stricken by a cerebral hemorrhage at home on February 15, 1926 and did not recover, leaving his second wife Mabel (Carter) Farnum. He was a president of the Providence Water Color Club and member of the Providence Art Club.

E. Vaughn (sometimes spelled George Vaughan or George E. Vaughn) (1823 - August 26, 1899) was a convicted Confederate spy during the American Civil War who claimed to have been pardoned by Abraham Lincoln an hour before Lincoln's assassination, in the President's last official act. Vaughn's claim was widely circulated at the time of his death in 1899, including in the New York Times.George E. Vaughn Dead - Lincoln's Last Official Act Was To Pardon Him As Spy - New York Times - August 28, 1899 However, in 2011, David Blanchette, director of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, Illinois, said there is no formal document in the archives verifying the claim. Interest in the claim was spurred in January 2011, when the National Archives announced that Thomas Lowry, a \\"longtime Lincoln researcher,\\" confessed on January 12, 2011 to changing the date of a pardon in the National Archives of a different soldier from April 14, 1864 to April 14, 1865 in order to enhance his credentials as a historian.https://www.archives.gov/press/press-releases/2011/nr11-57.html Life According to his obituary, Vaughn was born in Virginia and moved to Canton, Missouri. He was recruited into the Confederate Missouri State Guard by Martin E. Green, brother of U.S. Senator James S. Green. Green, while camping at Tupelo, Mississippi, dispatched Vaughn to deliver letters to his wife in Canton. Vaughn was captured six miles south of Canton at La Grange, Missouri. The letters were found, and Vaughn was accused of being a spy and was sentenced to be shot. Missouri Senator John B. Henderson intervened with Lincoln to get a new trial, but the verdict was the same. Henderson got Lincoln to approve yet a third trial and again the verdict was the same. On the afternoon of April 14, 1865, Henderson appealed once more to the president, telling him, \\"Mr. Lincoln, this pardon should be granted in the interest of peace and conciliation.\\" Lincoln is said to have replied, \\"Senator, I agree with you. Go to Stanton and tell him this man must be released.\\" Henderson went to the office of Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton. Stanton refused, saying the execution was to be carried out in two days. Henderson returned to the White House, where he met the president dressed to go to Ford's Theatre. Lincoln wrote a message on official stationery‚Äîan order for an unconditional release and pardon‚Äîallegedly telling Henderson, \\"I think that will have precedence over Stanton.\\" After the war, Vaughn moved to Maryville, Missouri, where he died in 1899.

The station is currently owned by California State University, Sacramento and is part of the news network of CapRadio (formerly Capital Public Radio). From 1947 to 2000, KUOP was the radio station of the University of the Pacific. Capital Public Radio began leasing out KUOP's air time in 2000 and bought the facility outright in 2007. History =KCVN= The College of the Pacific applied to build a new FM radio station on December 9, 1944. The Federal Communications Commission approved the application on June 27, 1946, and KCVN began broadcasting on September 22, 1947, at 7 p.m. (The KCOP call letters were held by a police facility in Texas which showed no interest in giving them up.) While KCVN was the first broadcasting facility operated by the college, Pacific had a lengthy history in radio. Under director John Crabbe, it established the second radio major in the United States in 1927, and students on the campus could listen to carrier current outlet KAEO, which had been put into service by the Alpha Epsilon Omicron radio fraternity in January 1947. The college also aired programs live over KWG and sent transcriptions to stations in Lodi and Modesto. KCVN's first transmissions were made using an antenna mounted to a pole while a tower was commissioned. The station operated for four hours a day, six days a week, from a converted quonset hut. =Becoming KUOP= KUOP moved in 1964 to the Burns Tower (pictured) In 1961, the College of the Pacific renamed itself to the University of the Pacific, and KCVN became KUOP on April 12, 1963. Later that year, UOP applied to increase the effective radiated power of the station from 3,400 watts to nearly 30,000; at the same time, the station was relocated into the new Robert E. Burns Tower, a converted water tank, and KUOP received a donation of multiplex equipment allowing it to broadcast in stereo for the first time and making it the first stereo college station on the West Coast. KUOP received a $15,000 grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting in 1971, allowing it to expand its daytime service; that year, the station also joined the startup National Public Radio network. (It thus got NPR before Sacramento, which did not have an NPR station until 1979; NPR aired an entire week of All Things Considered from KUOP in the run-up to the 1976 presidential election.) A major growth step was taken in 1982 when the station filed to move its transmitter to Mount Oso and thereby provide the first public radio service to 300,000 additional people in four counties; the move took place in 1983. The station also developed a significant number of specialty programs, particularly in jazz music. Vince Marino's Dixieland My Beat aired for a quarter-century on KUOP until his death in 1993 and was credited with popularizing the genre in the region. =Enter Capital Public Radio= Despite its popularity with listeners in Stockton, KUOP was a money-loser for the University of the Pacific. As early as 1973, budget cuts threatened the station's existence. In the mid-1990s, KUOP cut back on some of its local programming and began airing more national NPR fare. By 2000, however, KUOP, along with most of the university's auxiliary services, operated at a loss; the station recorded annual deficits sometimes exceeding $300,000 and had been subsidized by the UOP general fund for more than a decade. In August 1998, in an attempt to boost funding, KUOP radically changed its music format from classical to Americana and increased its talk output, a move that drew the ire of some listeners and did not bring in enough new fundraising dollars to offset the support that was lost. On May 30, 2000, KUOP and Capital Public Radio of Sacramento announced that the University of the Pacific would enter into an agreement for CPR to take over operations of the Stockton station. CPR slowly brought KUOP's schedule in line with its other stations, including eliminating bluegrass and folk music. When the University of the Pacific board put the license up for sale in 2005, CPR attempted to buy the station outright, holding off a rival bid from KQED; however, at that time, the university opted not to sell. Ultimately, CPR bought the license outright from the University of the Pacific for $4 million in 2007; the university continued to provide a campus studio facility for CPR's use.

The village has a population of 1,200. History A rail overpass used by trains in Lewin K≈Çodzki, 1903-1905 It is difficult to determine when the first settlement was established at the site of today's Lewin K≈Çodzki. However, historians agree that first traces of human settlement date back to the 10th century, during the foundation of the Bohemian state under the P≈ôemyslid dynasty. It was then that a timber watchtower was constructed on Gr√≥dek Hill, at an altitude of 522 meters above sea level. The lone tower was not a usual border keep with a strong military garrison, but a rather insignificant checkpoint guarding the trade route which passed through Lewin. Over time, various merchants, artisans and peasants began to settle at the foot of the mountain, thus giving Lewin a town status as well as town privileges in the early 14th century. A similar watchtower, made of stone, was built on the Homole Hills. Its uncovered ruins were incorrectly referred to as the Lewin Castle, giving rise to a belief that a fortified castle once stood in the village. Following the death of Doubravka, the Czech wife of Polish Duke Mieszko I, Bohemia demanded the return of Lewin which was under Mieszko's rule.http://www.lewin-klodzki.pl/s-159-historia The Polish-Bohemian alliance eventually collapsed and Lewin K≈Çodzki became part of the inheritance dispute.http://www.lewin-klodzki.pl/s-159-historia The town was also destroyed under the Hussites, who plundered the region. Lewin was first mentioned in legal documents as Levinice in 1213. It was then that king Ottokar I of Bohemia founded a monastery nearby, between Lewin and Kudowa-Zdr√≥j.

It was a popular spot for holidaymakers who visited the surrounding Sudetes and enjoyed the rural hill-like scenery. In 1938 the Nazis changed the name of Lewin to Hummelstadt as the previous named was deemed too Slavic.http://www.lewin-klodzki.pl/s-159-historia In accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, the town again became part of Poland after World War II. The local German population was expelled and new Polish arrivals settled from the Eastern Borderlands (so-called \\"Kresy\\") that were annexed by the Soviet Union. In 1946, due to depopulation and its small size, the Polish authorities degraded Lewin to the status of a village.

He has claimed ten caps for South Africa. Before moving to the Guinness Premiership in 2006 he had gained a reputation for hard work and personal integrity from his days in South African rugby, representing Western Province and the Super Rugby franchise the Stormers, having started his professional career at the Griffons. Early life Born 20 November 1978 in Cape Town, De Kock was educated at Boston Primary, Bellville and The Settlers High School, Bellville before attending Stellenbosch University. Initially failing to secure a contract with his native Western Province side, he made the journey to the Griffons in Free State Province in search of Currie Cup rugby to start his professional career. Playing career =Griffons 1999-2000= De Kock spent a season playing in Free State Province playing for the Griffons in a team that was to ultimately to produce four Springboks in Lukas Van Biljon, Gavin Passens and Dean Hall as well as De Kock. His performances saw him offered the chance to return to his home union to represent Western Province. =Western Province/Stormers 2000‚Äì06= De Kock was to spend 6 seasons with Western Province making 52 appearances in a team that won the Currie Cup in his first two seasons with the side. In 2001, his second season with Western Province he made the step up to Super Rugby (then Super 12) level rugby with the associated Stormers franchise, going on to make 49 appearances. Also in the 2001 season, De Kock won his first full international honours with the Springboks against Italy. At international level a frustrating period followed, first in a sequence games sitting unused on the bench, followed by a knee injury offering further chances for his rival at Super 12 and national level, Bolla Conradie. He forced his way back into contention, appearing in the 2002 Tri Nations series, starting two games, appearing from the bench in a third and scoring his maiden test try. The following season saw De Kock continuing to battle for his shirt at Western Province, Stormers and national level, making only one start and a single bench appearance for the Springboks. He was though selected for the Rugby World Cup 2003 South Africa squad, making one starting line up and appearing from the bench three times, as well as scoring his second international try. Succeeding seasons brought further regular appearances for De Kock for Western Province and the Stormers, but opportunities to fight his way back into the Springbok side were limited and in 2006 he made the move to the northern hemisphere, signing for Saracens in time for the 2006‚Äì07 Guinness Premiership season. = Saracens 2006‚Äì2017 = De Kock made his debut for Saracens against London Irish on 30 September 2006. In his debut season at Saracens, De Kock saw off strong competition from the likes of Fijian Mosese Rauluni and the Englishman Alan Dickens to establish himself as first choice scrum-half, making 25 appearances for the club. He quickly formed an effective partnership with New Zealander Glen Jackson at fly-half, yielding performances that put him contention for the club's player of the season. For the 2007‚Äì2008 season, De Kock's leadership role at Saracens was rewarded as he was named as the playing captain for the season, alongside club captain and England stalwart, Richard Hill. He started as Saracens won their first Premiership title in 2011. He was a replacement as they won further titles in 2015 and 2016. He retired in 2017.

E. A. Joy, K. K. Bell, & M. K. Ramsey (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2007), p. 302.  Research and practice focus  Uebel‚Äôs research is best described as humanistic. Examining issues such as the formation of utopian thought, the ideology of gender relations, and the potentials of human existence, Uebel has urged a reconnaissance of disciplines as seemingly disparate as psychoanalysis, gerontology, philosophy, and social science. Uebel is forging an approach to literary, philosophical, and social phenomena that eludes the narcissistic allegorization of history that mires much contemporary cultural studies work. Increasingly, Uebel's writing focuses on the currents of cultural analysis in the humanities.https://utexas.academia.edu/MichaelUebel As a psychotherapist, Uebel‚Äôs practice and research focus on issues related to the social contexts of psychopathology and treatment modalities that address the person, the social body, and the relational world, including mindfulness modalities, gestalt therapy, and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT).https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/name/Michael_Uebel_PhD,LCSW_Austin_Texas_46379  Influences  Significant influences on Uebel include the humanistic psychologists Rollo May, Abraham Maslow, Fritz Perls, Thomas Szasz, and Robert Jay Lifton, the politically engaged psychoanalysts Wilhelm Reich, Erich Fromm, and Herbert Marcuse, and the less easily pigeon-holed thinkers Walter Benjamin, F√©lix Guattari, and Paul Goodman.

He has also edited a volume of essays on medieval culture for New Literary History (1996).  Current research  Uebel is writing a book on the formation of social consciousness and shame in post-war U.

Background Mongol soldiers. He was originally an Turko-Mongol (al- Turki al-Mughli) soldier in the Ilkhanid army of Hulagu. He was taken prisoner during the First Battle of Homs in 1260.Ibn Taghri, Sultanante of al-nasir Muhammed. He was purchased by Qalawun and became one of his Mamluks then later Qalawun manumitted him and granted him the rank of Emir.(Al-Maqrizi - Al- Khitat Al-Maqiziyah, p. 388/vol.3) - (Ibn Taghri, Sultanante of al-nasir Muhammed) During the reign of Qalawun's son Sultan Al-Ashraf Khalil, he was arrested and released.Al-Maqrizi, p.218 & p.222 /vol.2 In 1293, after the assassination of Al-Ashraf Khalil, Kitbugha became the Vice-Sultan and Regent of Sultan Al-Nasir Muhammad. With Emir ‚ÄòAlam al-Din Sanjar al-Shuja‚Äòi al- Mansuri (, romanised:  øAlam ad-Dƒ´n San«ßar a≈°-≈†u«ßƒÅ øƒ´ al-Man·π£≈´rƒ´) he was effectively the ruler of Egypt as Al-Nasir Muhammad was only 9 years old.Al- Maqrizi, p.249/vol. 2 But Kitbugha faced rivalry from and had a poor relationship with al-Shuja‚Äòi who was an Al-Nasir's Vizier. Al-Shuja‚Äòi, with the support of the Burji Mamluks, planned to arrest Kitbugha and assassinate his emirs, but Kitbugha was informed about al-Shuja‚Äòi's plan by a Tatar named Qunghar. Kitbugha lay siege to the Citadel with the support of the Genghis- Khanites and the Shahrzuri Kurds.Shahrzuriyah were Kurds who escaped from Mesopotamia after the Turco-Mongol invasion. During a battle between Al Karak and Sultan Qutuz they deceived al-Malik al-Mughith king of Al Karak and walked over to the Egyptian side. ( Al-Maqrizi, p500/vol.1 ) However, he was defeated by the Burji Mamluks and had to flee to Bilbays.Bilbays, also spelled Bilbeis or Bilbis, town, southeastern al-Sharqia Governorate in the eastern Nile Delta , Lower Egypt , northeast of Cairo. - ( Encyclop√¶dia Britanica, p.15/vol. II) He later returned to Cairo and lay siege to the Citadel again after his emirs defeated the Burjis. Kitbugha's siege of the Citadel lasted for seven days with daily clashes with the Sultani Mamluks and al-Shuja‚Äòi supporters. Many of al-Shuja‚Äòi's emirs moved over to Kitbugha's side. The emirs of Kitbugha informed Sultan Al-Nassir Muhammed's mother that the dispute was between them and al-Shuja‚Äòi and not with her son. So she locked the gates of the Citadel with al-Shuja‚Äòi trapped in his house outside the Citadel. After that more of his Emirs deserted him and moved over to the side of Kitbugha. Al-Shuja‚Äòi, who was not popular among the Egyptians, was killed while he was on his way to the Citadel to discuss the dispute. When the gate of the Citadel was unlocked Kitbugha and his emirs went in. Kitbugha's followers who were imprisoned by al-Shuja‚Äòi were freed and many Burji Mamluks who supported al-Shuja'i were either arrested or removed from the Citadel. Al-Shuja‚Äòi's properties in the Levant were seized and his deputies there were arrested.Al-Maqrizi, pp.252-255/vol.2 About 300 of the Burji Mamluks who were removed from the Citadel by Kitbugha rebelled and went on a rampage in Cairo. These Mamluks, known as the al-Mamalik al-Ashrafiyah Khalil (the Mamluks of al-Ashraf Khalil) were enraged because Hossam ad-Dain Lajin, who was involved in the murder of their benefactor, Sultan al-Ashraf Khalil, had arrived in Cairo but was not arrested and punished. The Ashrafiyah Khalil were defeated and many of them were killed and executed.Al-Maqrizi, pp.259/vol.2 Rise to power Kitbugha continued as the regent and the actual ruler of Egypt with Al-Nasir Muhammad, being a child, merely the nominal Sultan. After the murder of Vizier al- Shuja‚Äòi, Kitbugha became more powerful. He was then convinced by Lajin, who was aware that the Mamluks of Khalil and Sultan Al-Nasir Muhammed would want to seek revenge for the death of Sultan Khalil, to depose Al-Nasir and take on complete power.Ibn Taghri, Sultanante of al-Nasir Muhammed.First Kitbugha refused the advice of Lajin but he became convinced after Lajin warned him that later when Al-Nasir Muhammed is old he will punish him as he was also involved in the murder of Al-Nasir Muhammed's brother Al-Ashraf Khalil. - (Ibn Taghri, Sultanante of al-nasir Muhammed.) ( See also Al-Ashraf Khalil ) After the defeat of the rebelling Burji Mamluks, Kitbugha assembled the emirs at his office and told them: \\"The system of the Kingdom has been undermined. There can not be respect while Sultan Al-Nasir is young \\". The emirs agreed and they decided to replace Al-Nasir Muhammed with Kitbugha. Al-Nasir Muhammed was removed with his mother to another section of the palace and later to Al Karak . Kitbugha was installed as Sultan and took the royal name Al-Adil. He made Lajin his Vice-Sultan.Al-Maqrizi, p. 275/vol.2 The Oirats The Oirats arrived in Egypt In 1296 a large group of Oirats,The Oirats were about 10,000 persons with horses and cattle. (Ibn Taghri, Sultanate of Kitbugha )Oirats, in Arabic Uyratiya. Mongol refugees, arrived in the Levant. They were led by Turghai, the son-in-law of Hulagu Khan.According to Abu al-Fida‚Äô, Turghai was the husband of the daughter of Mangu Timur the son of Hulagu. - (Abu al-Fida‚Äô, year AH 695)In 1262, during the reign of Sultan Baybars many Tatars from the Golden Horde tribe escaped from Hulagu to Egypt and were followed later by other Tatars. Baybars welcomed the Tatars and employed them in the army. They had their own army unit, which was called al-Firqah al-Wafidiyah (the arrivals' troop). Throughout the Mamluk era, the Wafidiyah (Arriving Tatars) were free men and the Mamluk system did not apply to them. Baybars settled the Tatars in Cairo and gave them various official posts. The largest group of Tatars immigrated to Egypt in 1296 during the reign of Sultan Kitbugha, who was himself of Mongol origin. They resided at the district of al-Hisiniyah in Cairo and many of their women married Mamluk emirs. (Shayyal, vol. 2, p. 144) They had fled to the Levant from Ghazan. While some of the Oirat group was received warmly in Cairo by Kitbugha and then resided in the Cairene district of al-Hisiniyah,Also spelled al-Husayniyya. The district still exist in present-day Cairo. others were sheltered in the coastal towns of the Levant. The Oirats were not Muslims, but after they intermarried with Egyptian emirs and later with Egyptian commoners, they converted to Islam and merged with Egyptian society.Al-Maqrizi, vol. 2, p. 266Shayyal, vol. 2, pp. 144‚Äì145 However, as Kitbugha was himself of Mongol origin, his extraordinary generosity towards the Oirats made many emirs suspicious about his motives.Shayyal, p.145Al-Maqrizi, al-Khitat al-Maqriziyah, vol. 3, pp. 32‚Äì36 This would be one of the factors that would later lead to his downfall.Shayyal, vol. 2, p. 145 Loss of power Later in the reign of Kitbugha, Egypt and the Levant faced shortages of water and food in addition to an epidemic that caused the death of many people in Egypt.Al-Maqrizi described the era of Kitbugha as following: \\"His days were the worst days with high prices, epidemics and death \\" - (Al-Maqrizi, p.260/vol.2)According to Al- Maqrizi the epidemic caused the death of 127.000 persons. - (Al-Maqrizi, p.268/vol.2) Kitbugha was not popular among the Egyptians who regarded him as a bringer of ill-omens.When the palace servants heard that kitbugha took power a kitchen servant exclaimed: \\" This is an ill omen ! This is an unlucky day ! \\". The words of the servant spread around and were repeated by all the people. - ( Al-Maqrizi, p. 260/vol.2 ) Also, the Egyptian were not pleased with Kitbugha's generosity towards the Oirats who were not Muslims while they, the Egyptians, were suffering from high prices of food and economic hardship. While Kitbugha was in Damascus the emirs decided to get rid of him. The emirs went to Kitbugha and met him while he was on his way to Egypt. Kitbugha was angry with Bisari, who was a prominent emir, and accused him of corresponding with the Mongols. Fearing that Kitbugha would arrest Bisari, the emirs,the Emirs who attacked Kitbugha's Dihliz included Lajin, Bisari, Qara Sunqur, Qabjaq and al-Haj Bahader. - ( Al-Maqrizi, p.273/vol.2 ) including Lajin, carried arms and went to the Dihliz Dihliz, royal tent of the Sultan which he uses during his travels and battles of Kitbugha and clashed with his Mamluks.Mamluks of kitbugha were called al-Mamalik al-Adilyyah referring to Kitbugha royal name Al-Adil. A few of Kitbugha's Mamluks were killed or injured. Kitbugha left the Dihliz through a back passage and fled to Damascus, accompanied by five of his Mamluks. The emirs were unable to catch him. Lajin was placed on the throne as the new Sultan of Egypt. Kitbugha took refuge inside the citadel of Damascus, but at last he resigned and recognized Lajin as the new Sultan saying: \\"al-Sultan al-Malik al-Mansour ( Lajin ) is one of my Khushdashiya.Khushdashiya ( ÿÆÿ¥ÿØÿßÿ¥Ÿäÿ© ): Mamluks belonging to the same Amir or Sultan. I serve him and I obey him. I will stay inside the Citadel until the Sultan decide(s) what to do with me\\". Kitbugha left Damascus to rule in Salkhad.Al-Maqrizi, pp. 277-278/vol.2 He ruled there for two years and 17 days.Al-Maqrizi, p. 274/vol.2 In 1299 while Sultan Al-Nasir Muhammad was on his way to Syria with the Egyptian army to encounter the invasion of Mahmud Ghazan, some Oirats conspired with some Mamluks of the Sultan to kill the Vice-Sultan Salar and the Ostadar,Ostadar ( ÿ£ÿ≥ÿ™ÿßÿØÿßÿ± ), supervisor of the royal kitchen and everything connected to the food and drink of the Sultan. Baibars al-Jashnakir who were the actual rulers of Egypt. They wanted to bring Kitbugha back to power, but the attempt failed and the conspiring Oirats were severely punished. After the defeat of Al-Nasir Muhammad's army at the Battle of Wadi al-Khazandar, Kitbugha fled to Egypt and served Salar. After Ghazan left Syria Kitbugha became the deputy of Sultan Al-Nasir Muhammad in Hama,Al- Maqrizi, p. 326 and p.329/vol.2 where he died in July 1303.Abu al-Fida, Al- Mukhtasar fi Akhbar al-Bashar, IV:61-63. Coins of Al-Adil Kitbugha In 1295, during the reign of Sultan Kitbugha, it was decided for the first time in Egypt, that coins had to be weighed before being exchanged for goods or services.

It was founded in 1981, developing broader goals from an association devoted primarily to the secularisation of public school curriculum in Quebec. It won a major victory with Mouvement la√Øque qu√©b√©cois v Saguenay (City) (2015) when the Canadian Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional for the City of Saguenay, Quebec (or any level of government), to open public meetings with prayers, or to have religious symbols in municipal facilities. The Court said that the state must maintain neutrality in public affairs. Background The MLQ believes that ethics and religion should not be united within a single school curriculum. Both are taught in public schools within the \\"ethics and religious culture\\" curriculum. The MLQ was founded in 1981 by parents who disagreed with the Quebec public school system including only Catholic or Protestant religious education as requirements of the general curriculum; they thought there should be secular alternatives. The MLQ developed from the AQADER association (Quebec association to ensure the application of the right to be exempted from religious education, or \\"Association qu√©b√©coise pour l'application du droit √† l'exemption de l'enseignement religieux\\") founded in 1976. MLQ founders wanted an association whose scope would extend beyond the right to exemption, for instance by promoting values such as free thought. Their goal was secularisation of Quebec public institutions. In 1987, the MLQ collaborated with senator Jacques H√©bert to prevent the adoption of a private bill that would have enabled Opus Dei, a Catholic lay organization, to bypass Canadian fiscal law as a religious institution. In the same year, the MLQ petitioned the Federal Department of Justice to withdraw Bibles from courts, so that solemn affirmations would be recognized as valid. Parliament has passed numerous bills to secularise public school institutions: the Quebec provincial government abandoned its project to restructure school boards on the basis of religion; the constitution was modified to authorize schools and schools boards to become secular or be founded as such; and in 2008 the government dropped an override clause protecting religious education. Members of the MLQ have challenged other practices at the municipal level; for instance, in 2006 activists filed complaints against the City of Saguenay for Mayor Jean Tremblay's practice of saying a prayer before each City Council meeting; they also objected to the presence of religious symbols in chambers used for municipal business, such as the boardroom for the Baie district. The case attracted international media attention and took several years to unfold in the courts. After a lengthy process, the case reached the Canadian Supreme Court, which in April 2015 ruled that the city's practices were unconstitutional, as they violated protections of freedom of conscience and religion. The court said government at all levels must be neutral in its practices.\\"Prayers at Quebec city council meetings violate constitutional rights: Supreme Court\\", National Post, 15 April 2015, accessed 17 October 2015 This association annually grants the Condorcet-Dessaules award to either a person or an organization whose position or actions represent the association's objectives.

Davis makes art from found objects and often includes mixed media. He has also worked in photography, drawing, painting, ceramics and sculpture but accounts clay as is his most expressive medium of art due to its direct physical influence from it. He feels that there's a disconnect when a tool separates him from the work such as a brush or a lens. Art to Davis \\"is a wonderful way to understand self and to understand others.\\" In his works he would tend to have a strong influence in African and African American textiles. \\"There's a triangle motif that's common in his art that's borrowed from the patterns found in African Quilts and architecture found in Guana, Africa.\\" \\"Among Davis's works many have been featured in public and private collections alike from the U.S.A. Europe and China to Ghana, Senegal and Nigeria with exhibits featured in the Museum of Harlem, the African Craft Museum, the Renwick gallery and many more.\\" Being an African American and growing up in the civil rights movement has influenced Davis. He likes to use found objects such as nuts and bolts to create pieces of art influenced by what his ancestors in Africa might have made, such as African masks or an installation of an African shrine. This included the mixed-media triptych \\"The Struggle as Viewed from the Base of the Wall\\" which was inspired by the Attica Prison riots.

He held the Detroit Lions' career and single-season rushing records until the 1960s. Early years Gutowsky was descended from ethnic German colonists in the Ukraine via Poland.https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MLQH-Z6B His father, Assaph Gutowsky came to the USA with several of his brothers in 1909.

Pappy Waldorf recruited him to play football at Oklahoma City University. With Waldorf as coach and Gutowsky in the backfield, the Oklahoma City Goldbugs rose to success in football. Former teammate Leo Higbie recalled, \\"Lynn Waldorf got OCU's football program really going in 1927 when he brought the great Ace Gutowsky of Kingfisher to the school.\\" With Gutowsky in the backfield, the Goldbugs lost only one game in the first two years of the 1930s. Professional football Gutowsky played eight years of professional football in the National Football League for the Portsmouth Spartans (1932-1933), Detroit Lions (1934-1938) and Brooklyn Dodgers (1939). At and , Gutowsky played principally at the fullback position. As a two-way player, Gutowsky's duties on defense were those which in modern football would be associated with a linebacker or defensive back. Playing for the Portsmouth Spartans in 1932, Gutowsky was tripped by coaching legend George Halas in a championship game against the Chicago Bears. With the Bears leading and four minutes left in the game, Gutowsky took a kickoff and began returning the ball along the sideline. Halas \\"stuck out his foot and tripped Gutowsky as he ran past with the ball.\\" The officials didn't notice, but Portsmouth coach Potsy Clark \\"went off like a roman candle\\" and told Halas he was playing the game under protest. Halas reportedly responded by yelling, \\"Protest this,\\" while \\"saluting Clark with a single finger.\\" Gutowsky enjoyed his greatest success as a member of the Detroit Lions from 1934 to 1936. In 1934, he carried the ball 146 times for the Lions, the highest number of carries by any player during the 1934 NFL season. Gutowsky was also one of the leaders on a defense that ran seven straight shutouts and gave up only 59 points in 13 games. The following year, he was a member of the 1935 Detroit Lions team that defeated the New York Giants in the 1935 NFL Championship Game. In the mid-1930s, the Lions' backfield with Gutowsky, Dutch Clark and Ernie Caddel became known as the \\"Infantry Attack.\\" While Clark was considered the \\"flashier\\" back, Gutowsky was regarded as the \\"workhorse\\" and \\"the one they turned to when the ball was near the goal line.\\" Teammate Glenn Presnell later recalled that Gutowsky was \\"a hard line plunger.\\" In 1936, the Lions rushed for 2,885 yards, a mark that stood as the NFL single-season team rushing record until 1972. Gutowsky led the NFL that year with 857 yards from scrimmage, ranking ahead of teammate Dutch Clark and future Hall of Fame inductees Bronko Nagurski and Don Hutson. He also ranked second in the NFL behind Tuffy Leemans in rushing attempts (191), rushing yards (827), and rushing yards per game (68.9). His six rushing touchdowns in 1936 was exceeded only by his teammate Dutch Clark. His 827 rushing yards was the Lions' single- single season rushing record until 1960, when Nick Pietrosante rushed for 872 yards. Gutowsky finished his playing career in 1939 with the Brooklyn Dodgers football team. On October 22, 1939, in a 23-14 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles, Gutowsky broke Cliff Battles' NFL career rushing record. While his NFL rushing record was short-lived, he continued to hold the Lions' career rushing record into the 1960s. When he concluded his career in the NFL, Gutowsky, Clarke Hinkle and Bronko Nagurski were rated as \\"the greatest fullbacks ever to play professional football.\\" Bridge accomplishments Gutowsky became a champion bridge player, winning the 1951 Men's Board-a-Match Teams. The American Contract Bridge Association gave him the \\"life master\\" ranking, making him the first Oklahoman to achieve the highest ranking in bridge. =Wins= * North American Bridge Championships (1) ** Mitchell Board-a-Match Teams (1) 1951 Later years Gutowsky's father, Assaph \\"Ace\\" Gutowsky, was in the oil business.

In 1942 or 1943, Gutowsky's father discovered an oil field at West Edmond, Oklahoma, that was estimated at 117,000,000 barrels. Gutowsky's father discovered the oil field using a \\"doodlebug,\\" a \\"homemade divining rod\\" and \\"struck it rich\\" as several major oil companies bought leases from him. By 1944, Time magazine called the West Edmond field the \\"greatest concentration of rotary drilling rigs in the world.\\" After serving in the U.S. Army during World War II, Gutowsky went into the oil business with his father.

After numerous meetings with the city representatives it was decided not to allow the death of hockey in the city. At that time TJ Slovan National Board came up with the solution to run hockey club as their main field of activities. The hockey club was then handed in to chairman JUDr. Old≈ôich Rejna, who stayed in this position for another 23 years. In 1966 the team won TJ Slovan qualification achieving promotion to the second league, in which they played until 1972. After the 1971/72 season there was a change in the organisational structure of the whole competition. The First National League was created and the club then had to achieve the very demanding qualification standards to be admitted to the First National Hockey League. The team was immediately very successful finishing runners up in the 72/73 season, only one point behind Slezan Opava. The next 10 years saw the team regularly finishing the championship season in the top 3. In the 1979/80 season the team won the First National Hockey League championship by 7 points, but lost the Extra League promotion/relegation match against TJ Gottwaldov. In the following season Slovan won in its group stage again but this time only managed 3rd place in the finals. The 1986/87 season saw a crisis hit hockey in √öst√≠. In that year Slovan just managed to survive with the team avoiding relegation by just one position. This however was only delaying the inevitable, and in the following year Slovan was relegated to the 2nd league. In the 1988/89 season the team won the 2nd league by 16 points, winning 23 of the 28 regular season group games. Nobody doubted the teams return to the 1st league after only 1 season out. However, Slovan didn‚Äôt manage to take its chance and failed to win the promotion/relegation match staying in the 2nd league and waiting 5 long years before a great 92 season saw them finally return to the 1st league in '93. The 1993/94 season was, and still is, the most successful in the club's history. Slovan reached 5th place and then in the quarter-final of the play offs, eliminated HC Slezan Opava with a 3 games to 1 victory. Slovan's advance was stopped in the semi-finals by HC Dad√°k Vset√≠n who then went on to win promotion into the Extraliga. After the 1997/98 season, due to major financial issues, the club was forced to sell its stake in the competition to KLH Chomutov and in the following year the club just managed to stay in its group, barely avoiding relegation to the regional championship.  Modern history ‚Äì HC Slovan √östeƒçt√≠ Lvi  The major financial issues that brought on the shocking '97 season and the sale of its stake in the 1st League to Pir√°ti Chomutov was such a major setback for the team, that it took 10 years for HC Slovan to drag itself from the very bottom of the 2nd league back up among the top national teams. In a long but amazing turn around, HC Slovan went from a low of 12th place in the 2nd league through a fantastic run, being promoted back to the 1st League in 2000, winning the first league in the '05/06, winning again in the '06/07 season, to winning the promotion/relegation match gaining entry into the Extraliga for the 2007-08 season. The financial ability and international ringers in the Extra League made it almost impossible for HC Slovan √östeƒçt√≠ Lvi to survive being relegated back to the Czech 1. liga and at the end of the hard fought and well played season they were expectedly relegated back to the 1st League. Back in the 1st League HC Slovan continued to show its class by winning the championship in the 2008/'09 and 2010/'11 seasons, finishing runner up in the 2009/'10, and 2011/'12 seasons, and finishing 3rd in the championship in the 2012/'13 season. The 2013/14 season saw a dramatic fall from HC Slovan finishing only 10th in the regular season. The 2014/15 season saw an almost identically poor season once again languishing in 10th on the table. If we've learnt anything from HC Slovan's history it's that you can't keep a good thing down and the 2015/16 season saw an improvement to 8th at the end of the regular season and a fantastic playoffs run beating the 1st ranked team, Ryt√≠≈ôi Kladno in the quarterfinals. The season ended in a semi-final loss to Jihlava. The 2016/17 season saw further improvement to 6th in the regular season but a tough match up again against Kladno ended the season at the quarter finals.

Gullibility is a failure of social intelligence in which a person is easily tricked or manipulated into an ill-advised course of action. It is closely related to credulity, which is the tendency to believe unlikely propositions that are unsupported by evidence. Classes of people especially vulnerable to exploitation due to gullibility include children, the elderly, and the developmentally disabled. Meaning The words gullible and credulous are commonly used as synonyms. state that while both words mean \\"unduly trusting or confiding\\", gullibility stresses being duped or made a fool of, suggesting a lack of intelligence, whereas credulity stresses uncritically forming beliefs, suggesting a lack of skepticism. states the difference is a matter of degree: the gullible are \\"the easiest to deceive\\", while the credulous are \\"a little too quick to believe something, but they usually aren't stupid enough to act on it.\\" characterize a gullible person as one who is both credulous and na√Øve. stresses the distinction that gullibility involves an action in addition to a belief, and there is a cause-effect relationship between the two states: \\"gullible outcomes typically come about through the exploitation of a victim's credulity.\\" Etymology and history The verb to gull and the noun cullibility (with a C) date back to Shakespeare and Swift, whereas gullibility is a relatively recent addition to the lexicon. It was considered a neologism as recently as the early 19th century. \\"Gullible is not known to the Oxford English Dictionary before the 19th century...\\"; cited after . The first attestation of gullibility known to the Oxford English Dictionary appears in 1793, and gullible in 1825. The OED gives gullible as a back-formation from gullibility, which is itself an alteration of cullibility.Oxford English Dictionary online: gullibility, n. Oxford English Dictionary online: gullible, adj. Early editions of Samuel Johnson's A Dictionary of the English Language, including those published in 1797 and 1804, do not contain \\"gullibility\\" or \\"gullible\\".; . An 1818 edition by Henry John Todd denounces \\"gullibility\\" as \\"a low expression, sometimes used for cullibility\\". Gullibility does not appear in Noah Webster's 1817 A dictionary of the English language, but it does appear in the 1830 edition of his American dictionary of the English language, where it is defined: \\"n. Credulity. (A low word)\\". Both gullibility and gullible appear in the 1900 New English Dictionary. Examples presents dozens of examples of gullibility in literature and history. In the fairy tale The Adventures of Pinocchio, the title character is a gullible puppet who is repeatedly duped by other characters; part of his transformation into a human being is learning to avoid gullibility while still exercising empathy. In the first part of \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\", the title character is deceived by a wolf; from this experience she learns to feign gullibility in order to deceive a second wolf. In \\"The Emperor's New Clothes\\", the emperor and his staff display gullibility in being swindled, while the crowd displays credulity in believing in the invisible cloth. Mark Twain depicts mass gullibility in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today, among others. Shakespeare explores gullibility in the title characters of Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, and especially Othello. Of the examples of deception found in the Bible, the tale that most concerns the behavior of the deceived is Samson in the Book of Judges, a character who is destroyed by his gullibility in the face of love. The best-known example is Eve's gullibility in the Book of Genesis. Deception is a classic theme in war and politics‚Äîsee The Art of War and The Prince‚Äîand Greenspan finds the example most concerned with the gullibility of the deceived to be the Trojan Horse. In the Aeneid's version of the story, the Trojans are initially wary, but vanity and wishful thinking eventually lead them to accept the gift, resulting in their slaughter. Greenspan argues that a related process of self-deception and groupthink factored into the planning of the Vietnam War and the Second Iraq War. In science and academia, gullibility has been exposed in the Sokal Hoax and in the acceptance of early claims of cold fusion by the media. In society, tulipmania and other investment bubbles involve gullibility driven by greed, while the spread of rumors involves a gullible eagerness to believe (and retell) the worst of other people. April Fools' Day is a tradition in which people trick each other for amusement; it works in part because the deceiver has a social license to betray the trust they have built up over the rest of the year. Theories Some writers on gullibility have focused on the relationship between the negative trait of gullibility and positive trait of trust. They are related, as gullibility requires an act of trust. writes that exploiters of the gullible \\"are people who understand the reluctance of others to appear untrusting and are willing to take advantage of that reluctance.\\" In 1980, Julian Rotter wrote that the two are not equivalent: rather, gullibility is a foolish application of trust despite warning signs that another is untrustworthy., who cites . = Against gullibility = The relationship between gullibility and trust has led to alternate theories. Neuroscientist Hugo Mercier claims the opposite, that humans are intrinsically skeptical and difficult to persuade; we readily accept unsupported or false statements when they support our beliefs. One reason why we form these beliefs is that scientific theories are often counterintuitive, so we discard them in favour of explanations we find logical. This theory struggles to account for the prevalence of conspiracy theories; Mercier explains these as \\"reflective beliefs\\" that are insulated from our \\"intuitive beliefs\\", meaning that while we hold them we do not base our actions on them; an example of this is in the Pizzagate conspiracy where, despite many people falsely believing that a restaurant was harbouring child sex slaves, few took proportionate actions. As such, humans are not gullible per se, as we do not tend to trust everyone; indeed, a separate study found that more trusting participants were the best at discerning who to trust. As a result, he claims that humans \\"make more errors of omission (not trusting when we should) than of commission (trusting when we shouldn‚Äôt)\\". Research into how fake news influenced voting preferences in the 2018 Italian General Election supports this, suggesting that we tend to consume fake news that supports our ideologies and, thus, it does little to influence election outcomes.

In December 1946, founding company Valley Broadcasting Company (VBC) was granted a construction permit to put a new AM station on the air in Stockton at 1280 with 1,000 watts, directional to the west at night. This new AM station would sign on in the spring of 1947 with the call sign KXOB, co-owned with KXOA in Sacramento and KXOC in Chico. VBC partners were: Lincoln Dellar, Executive Director (90%), and Morton Sidley (10%). KXOB's offices and studios were originally at 2013 Pacific Avenue in Stockton with the transmitter site at Beyer Lane and East Harding Way, northeast of Stockton. In the fall of 1950, studio facilities were moved to the Beyer Lane transmitter site, presumably as a cost-cutting measure. April 1952 saw KXOB's first change in ownership as radio and newspaper executive Clem John Randau bought KXOB from Lincoln Dellar for $200,000. The FCC approved the transaction on July 10, 1952. Clem and Beatrice Randau owned 55% of KXOB with other principals Sherrill Corwin, Ralph Stolkin, and Edward G. Burke, Jr., doing business as Hotel Stockton Broadcasting. Mr. Randau also owned minority stock in New York radio station WNEW. Randau moved 1280 to its heritage, legendary storefront location at the northeast corner of El Dorado Street and Weber Avenue‚ÄîThe Hotel Stockton. The station would occupy this highly visible, landmark address within sight of the head of the Stockton Channel for over 40 years. Randau's ownership of KXOB did not last long, however. On September 9, 1953, the FCC approved the sale of KXOB to 36-year-old Joseph Gamble, in whose family the station would remain into the 1990s. Gamble's brother-in-law and former newspaper reporter, Ort J. Lofthus, then-Sales Manager of KCMJ, Palm Springs, another of Gamble's stations, was brought to Stockton to head KXOB as General Manager. =As KJOY= Sometime between the fall of 1953 and the fall of 1956, KXOB became KJOY, with the company's DBA (\\"doing business as\\") changing, in turn, to \\"KJOY, Inc.\\" This DBA did not last long, either; on October 30, 1956, the DBA became \\"Joseph Gamble Stations, Inc.\\" On November 29, 1963, tragedy befell KJOY and the Gamble family: owner Joseph, age 46, suffered a fatal heart attack at KJOY's Hotel Stockton offices. GM Ort Lofthus was elected president of Joseph Gamble Stations (KJOY, Stockton; KJAY, Sacramento; and KLAN, Lemoore). In February 1968, Joseph Gamble Stations requested the KJAX callsign for KJOY's new FM sister station at 99.3 MHz. This would be the 2nd time Gamble Stations would have this call sign: the first being 1150 KJAX in Santa Rosa in 1958. When Gamble Stations sold the 1150 license in 1963, the new owners changed the call letters to KPLS. In KJOY's early years, some notable personalities included such names as Mort Cooper, Jim Tracewell, Ken Wayne, Ron Reynolds, Ted Payne, Denny Kirwan and Rick Cimino, with Spencer Tyler and Jerry Simpson in the KJOY News Department. Airing in the early and mid-1960s would be names such as Terry Rose, Ken Minyard and Mac MacGregor, then later still, Don Imus (1969), Mike Wynn, Roy Williams, Dave Bowling, David Allan Kraham, Al \\"the Roadrunner\\" Heathman, Pat Kelley, Bill Bishofberger, Johnny Milford, John Willyard, Chrys Fasoli, Sheilah Bowman, Bill Daniels, Steve Young, Jerry Fuentes, Steve Blum as News Director, Bob Tilden, Scott Thomas, Terry Nelson, et al.

It is narrated by actor Paul Newman. The documentary shows the poor working conditions in the sugar cane plantations, and political control exerted by the Vicini family to stifle efforts to change the situation. While the documentary highlights the efforts of Father Christopher Hartley to bring medicine, education, and human rights to Haitian workers, it also shows the widespread resentment of his actions held by Dominican people. Critical reception The documentary won the audience award at the 2007 South by Southwest Film Festival. On November 19, 2007, The Price of Sugar was named by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as one of 15 films on its documentary feature Oscar shortlist. The documentary did not make the nomination list for the Oscar Documentary Feature category.OSCAR.com - 80th Annual Academy Awards - Nominee List Defamation lawsuit Subjects of the film, Felipe and Juan Vicini Lluberes, filed a defamation suit on August 31, 2007 against Uncommon Productions and producer Bill Haney, alleging 53 factual inaccuracies. According to Read McCaffrey, a partner in the law firm Patton Boggs representing the Vicinis,'The misrepresentation are very egregious and as deceptive as I have seen in a very long time.'\\" However, according to the First Circuit Court of Appeals, the Vicini family \\"later winnowed the number of allegedly defamatory statements down to seven\\". The Appeals Court upheld a judgment from a lower court that the Vicini brothers were \\"public figures under the circumstances\\". The brothers thus must prove that the filmmakers made false depictions and knew about it. If they had been private figures, as the plaintiffs had unsuccessfully tried to prove, the filmmakers could have been liable for publishing information without verifying its truth. The appeals court sent the case back to the lower court to decide if the filmmakers have to hand over a report that they prepared to obtain insurance coverage for the film. After that, the lower court can determine whether information shown in the film was false and, if it was the case, if the filmmakers knew about it. Improvement of living conditions According to a report by NPR, the living conditions of Haitian workers depicted in the film have improved to some extent soon after the film. New houses with electricity and water have been built together with rural clinics. The guards no longer carry guns, and the Haitians can leave the plantation. More recent service workers from the U.S. who have traveled to the La Romana region of the Dominican Republic to partner with the Good Samaritan Hospital in providing relief efforts to the bateyes report different findings. In the network of more than 200 bateyes around La Romana, more than 50% have undrinkable water. Most do not have electricity. Guards are often seen with firearms. While Haitians are allowed to leave the plantations, they lack the financial resources and/or relationships to do so. Malnutrition and dehydration are the number one causes of death among children.

However the 40 mm guns were dropped in the final design. The destroyers were also equipped beginning in 1958 with Mk 43 homing torpedoes in an effort to increase the distance between the ships and their targets. The Mk 43 torpedo had a range of at . They were pitched over the side by a modified depth charge thrower.Milner, p. 225 Service history Chaudi√®re was laid down on 30 July 1953 by Halifax Shipyards at Halifax, Nova Scotia. Named for a river in Quebec, she was the last of her class. The ship was launched on 13 November 1957. While under construction the escort suffered a fire which caused $200,000 in damage in September 1958. On 4 October 1958, a visiting engineer died after falling.Barrie and Macpherson (1996), p. 38 The ship commissioned on 14 November 1959 at Halifax with the classification DDE 235. Prime Minister John Diefenbaker was a guest of honour at the ceremony. Upon commissioning, the ship was assigned to the Fifth Canadian Escort Squadron. In March 1961, the destroyer escort was among the ships that took part in a combined naval exercise with the United States Navy off Nova Scotia. Chaudi√®re underwent shock testing off Florida in 1962. In February 1964, the ship took part in the NATO naval exercise \\"Magic Lantern\\" off Gibraltar. Following the unification of the Canadian Armed Forces, and the change from the Royal Canadian Navy to Maritime Command, Chaudi√®re was transferred to the west coast to join the Second Canadian Escort Squadron. On 2 October 1967, she left Halifax to travel to Esquimalt. Initially all seven Restigouche-class ships were intended to be upgraded to the IRE refit, however due to financial reasons, Chaudi√®res conversion was cut and by 1970, the ship was reduced to a training ship.Milner, p. 265 On 23 May 1974, Chaudi√®re was paid off and used as a source for parts for the other members of the class. In 1989, Chaudi√®res sister ship collided with a merchant vessel and her bow was severely damaged. To repair the damage, Kootenays damaged bow was removed and Chaudi√®res was installed in place.

Oxidation or reduction of species is registered as a peak or trough in the current signal at the potential at which the species begins to be oxidized or reduced.  Experimental method  Comparison of the current response of a platinum disc electrode in 1 M sulphuric acid given by linear sweep cyclic voltammetry and staircase cyclic voltammetry methods. Staircase voltammetry suppresses the non-faradaic adsorption of hydrogen. The experimental setup for linear sweep voltammetry utilizes a potentiostat and a three-electrode setup to deliver a potential to a solution and monitor its change in current. The three-electrode setup consists of a working electrode, an auxiliary electrode, and a reference electrode. The potentiostat delivers the potentials through the three-electrode setup. A potential, E, is delivered through the working electrode. The slope of the potential vs. time graph is called the scan rate and can range from mV/s to 1,000,000 V/s. The working electrode is one of the electrodes at which the oxidation/reduction reactions occur‚Äîthe processes that occur at this electrode are the ones being monitored. The auxiliary electrode (or counter electrode) is the one at which a process opposite from the one taking place at the working electrode occurs. The processes at this electrode are not monitored. The equation below gives an example of a reduction occurring at the surface of the working electrode. Es is the reduction potential of A (if the electrolyte and the electrode are in their standard conditions, then this potential is a standard reduction potential). As E approaches Es the current on the surface increases and when E=Es then the concentration of [A] = [A‚àí] at the surface. As the molecules on the surface of the working electrode are oxidized/reduced they move away from the surface and new molecules come into contact with the surface of the working electrode. The flow of electrons into or out of the electrode causes the current. The current is a direct measure of the rate at which electrons are being exchanged through the electrode-electrolyte interface. When this rate becomes higher than the rate at which the oxidizing or reducing species can diffuse from the bulk of the electrolyte to the surface of the electrode, the current reaches a plateau or exhibits a peak. ::\\\\ce{A + e- <=> A-},\\\\ E_s=0.00V Reduction of molecule A at the surface of the working electrode. The auxiliary and reference electrode work in unison to balance out the charge added or removed by the working electrode. The auxiliary electrode balances the working electrode, but in order to know how much potential it has to add or remove it relies on the reference electrode. The reference electrode has a known reduction potential. The auxiliary electrode tries to keep the reference electrode at a certain reduction potential and to do this it has to balance the working electrode.  Characterization  Linear sweep voltammetry can identify unknown species and determine the concentration of solutions. E1/2 can be used to identify the unknown species while the height of the limiting current can determine the concentration. The sensitivity of current changes vs. voltage can be increased by increasing the scan rate. Higher potentials per second result in more oxidation/reduction of a species at the surface of the working electrode.  Variations  For reversible reactions cyclic voltammetry can be used to find information about the forward reaction and the reverse reaction. Like linear sweep voltammetry, cyclic voltammetry applies a linear potential over time and at a certain potential the potentiostat will reverse the potential applied and sweep back to the beginning point. Cyclic voltammetry provides information about the oxidation and reduction reactions.  Applications  While cyclic voltammetry is applicable to most cases where linear sweep voltammetry is used, there are some instances where linear sweep voltammetry is more useful. In cases where the reaction is irreversible cyclic voltammetry will not give any additional data that linear sweep voltammetry would give us. In one example, linear voltammetry was used to examine direct methane production via a biocathode. Since the production of methane from CO2 is an irreversible reaction, cyclic voltammetry did not present any distinct advantage over linear sweep voltammetry.

He saved up enough money from his job to buy a bookstore, which he later sold to pursue an art education in Europe. He studied in Paris, Brussels, Antwerp and Munich. A chance meeting with Buffalo Bill Cody in Antwerp changed the focus of his artistic career. He returned to New York and quickly began to record the portraits of Iroquois people in New York and Canada. He built a studio in Albuquerque in 1906 and spent the next few years traveling around the region. In 1929, Imhof and his wife, Sarah, relocated permanently to Taos, New Mexico. There, he made models live in his home for some time before he could paint them. He felt that he needed to know them at a deeper level.

History Logo as \\"La Campesina\\" In July 1980, the United Farm Workers union, working through a subsidiary named Farmworkers Communications, Inc., applied to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a construction permit for a new broadcast radio station. The FCC granted this permit on August 31, 1981, with a scheduled expiration date of August 31, 1982. The new station was assigned call sign KUFW on November 30, 1981. After multiple extensions, construction and testing were completed in May 1983 and KUFW began broadcasting under program test authority. KUFW became the first radio station in the United States \\"dedicated to the needs of farmworkers\\". The station was granted its broadcast license on June 28, 1984. The station was taken temporarily off the air in mid-April 1990 by a fire that gutted the interior of the broadcast facility and destroyed the station's control room. While repairs were being made, broadcasting resumed from one of the station's remote broadcast vans parked at the site of the fire-ravaged facility. In August 1995, Farmworkers Communications, Inc., filed an application with the FCC to transfer the KUFW broadcast license to National Farm Workers Service Center, Inc. The FCC approved the move on December 13, 1995, and the transaction was formally consummated on December 14, 1995. On September 2, 2011, lawyers representing radio stations KUFW and KNAI (Phoenix, Arizona) notified the FCC that license holder National Farm Workers Service Center, Inc., had legally changed its name to the \\"C√©sar Ch√°vez Foundation\\" on June 30, 2010.

They are known commonly as groundcones and they are native to western North America and extreme northeastern Asia. Some taxonomists consider Boschniakia to be three separate genera: Boschniakia, Kopsiopsis, and Xylanche. When the genus is split, only a single species remains: Boschniakia rossica, the northern groundcone. Groundcones are holoparasitic, meaning they depend entirely on a host plant for nutrients and contain little or no chlorophyll. These plants often parasitize alders but they are found on many other plants. Groundcones often look at first glance like pine cones lying on the ground, especially when they are brown in color. They may also be shades of yellow, red, and purple. Each plant may be a few inches tall, and pine-cone-shaped or cylindrical. The plant above ground is almost entirely made up of its inflorescence, a tightly packed column of thick cup-shaped flowers. The groundcone produces haustoria which penetrate the roots of its host and provide it with water and nutrients. The type species for Boschniakia is Boschniakia glabra, a species which is no longer considered valid. Instead, it is now included in Boschniakia rossica.

However, the latest releases are based on unmodified versions of the Eclipse open source IDE, which can be easily extended to include support for OS level application debug (Linux, Android, Windows Embedded) and open source compiler suites such as GCC. Early versions included a real time kernel called DSP/BIOS and its later inception SYS/BIOS. Currently, the successor to these tools, the TI-RTOS embedded tools ecosystem, is available for downloading as a free plugin to Code Composer Studio.  History  Originally Code Composer was a product from a company called GO DSP located in Toronto, Canada, and it was acquired by TI in 1997.TI Press release After the acquisition, Code Composer was bundled with a real-time kernel named DSP/BIOSHistory of SYS/BIOS and its name was appended with the word Studio. CCS releases up until 3.3 were based on a proprietary interface, but TI was already working in parallel on the development of an IDE based on the open-source Eclipse. This IDE was named Code Composer Essentials (CCE) and was designed for the MSP430 line of microcontrollers. This expertise was used to completely overhaul the previous CCS and starting with release 4.0 all versions are also based on Eclipse. Code Composer was originally developed for DSP development, therefore one of its main differentiators at the time was the availability of graphical visualization tools (XY graphs, FFT magnitude and phase, constellation, raw image visualization) and support for visualizing memory in several numeric formats (decimal, floating-point).

The license's SRP was the same (US$3,600.00). There was a C2x-only limited license that retailed for US$600.00. *Starting with release 4.x, CCS can be used for free in several scenarios that include development boards, software device simulators and even the use of a standalone emulator named XDS100.CCS license page at TI wiki Also, it can be used with a codesize limitation of 16kB on MSP430 devices. This release also introduced the floating license, which can be installed on a server and be used across a company's or university's Intranet at almost the cost of a full license. **A full license for CCS release 4.x had an SRP of US$1,995.00 and a microcontroller-only license was US$495.00.

She was built in 1862 at Williamsburg, New York, purchased by the Navy on 15 July 1863; and commissioned on 24 September 1863 with Acting Master F. R. Webb in command. The Union Navy used her as a collier and freight supply ship assigned to assist Union Navy ships patrolling Confederate waterways. Civil War service =Assigned to support the North Atlantic Blockade= A coal and freight supply ship, Fahkee served the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron from the time of her commissioning to the close of the war. She carried cargo from New York City, Norfolk, Virginia, and Newport News, Virginia to the fleet on the North Carolina coast, as well as giving towing services and patrolling on blockade at frequent intervals. =Operation in Battle= Fahkee first came under fire on 3 January 1864 in Lockwood's Folly Inlet near Wilmington, North Carolina, when she passed through musket and shell fire from the shore to investigate Bendigo, a blockade runner grounded and afire. Fahkee shelled the ship to further her destruction, which was completed the next day by other ships. While blockading Wilmington, North Carolina, in the spring and summer of 1864, Fahkee was several times fired upon by Confederate shore batteries, and on 24 August, engaged a blockade runner. Returning to the same area after a voyage to New York and Hampton Roads, she twice fired on grounded blockade runners in December. In January 1865, she carried cargo from Norfolk to Beaufort and to the fleet operating against Fort Fisher. =Reassigned to the South Atlantic Squadron= In April 1865, at the close of the war, Fahkee was assigned to the South Atlantic Squadron, and from Port Royal, South Carolina, provisioned ships at Charleston, South Carolina, and those cruising the coast of the Carolinas. She also cruised with the Squadron off Cuba before arriving at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 19 June. Post-war decommissioning and disposal Fahkee was decommissioned on 28 June, and sold in Philadelphia on 10 August.

Biography Lewis was born in Castlemaine, Victoria, Australia on 7 June 1881. He was the second of eight children and had a passion for drawing. At the age of 15, he left home and traveled in New South Wales, Australia, and in New Zealand, working as a post hole digger and a merchant seaman. He returned to Sydney and settled into a Bohemian community outside Sydney. Two of his drawings were published in the radical Sydney newspaper, The Bulletin.The Old Print Shop, New York He studied with Julian Ashton at the Art Society's School in Sydney. Ashton, a famous painter, was also one of the first Australian artists to take up printmaking. United States In 1900, Lewis left Australia for the United States. His first job was in San Francisco, painting stage decorations for William McKinley's presidential campaign of 1900.Jean Lewis, Thinking About Art By 1909, Lewis was living in New York, where he found work in commercial illustration. His earliest known etching is dated 1915. However, the level of skill in this piece suggests he had been working in the medium for some time previously. It was during this period that he helped Edward Hopper learn the basics of etching.Moonlight Etchings of the Forgotten Artist who Taught Edward Hopper In 1920, after the breakup of a romance,Bruce Museum, Greenwich CT Lewis traveled to Japan, where for two years he drew and painted and studied Japanese art. The influence of Japanese prints is very evident in Lewis's prints after that period. In 1925, he returned to etching and produced most of his well-known works between 1925 and 1935 Lewis's first solo exhibition in 1929 was successful enough for him to give up commercial work and concentrate entirely on printmaking. Lewis is most famous for his black and white prints, mostly of night scenes of non-tourist, real life street scenes of New York City.Joan Stahl, American Artists in Photographic Portraits from the Peter A. Juley & Son Collection (Washington, D.C. and Mineola, New York: National Museum of American Art and Dover Publications, Inc., 1995) During the Depression, however, he was forced to leave the city for four years between 1932 and 1936 and move to Newtown, Connecticut. His work from this period includes a number of rural, night-time and winter scenes in this area and nearby Sandy Hook. When Lewis was able to return to the New York City in 1936, there was no longer a market interested in his work. He taught printmaking at the Art Students League of New York from 1944 until his retirement in 1952. Lewis died largely forgotten in 1962. Lewis's print, Shadow Dance, sold for $50,400 at the Scenes of the City: Prints, Drawings & Paintings of New York 1900‚Äì2000 auction in New York on October 2010, setting a record price for the artist at auction.Swann Galleries, New York The Bruce Museum in Greenwich, Connecticut, staged an exhibition of Martin Lewis prints in October 2011 drawn from the collection of Dr. Dorrance Kelly. The Bruce Museum said of Lewis: \\"Recognized as one of the premier American printmakers of the first half of the 20th century, Martin Lewis left an indelible mark on the landscape of the art world. Lewis was an acknowledged master of the intaglio techniques of printmaking, experimenting with multiple processes including etching, aquatint, engraving and drypoint. A highly skilled printer, Lewis created magnificent impressions that captured the energy, bustle and occasional solitude of all aspects of city life in New York. With his remove to Connecticut in 1932, Lewis instigated another topic through his printmaking: country life. This firmly entrenched Lewis as a prominent America scene artist, who captured the intersection between the urban and rural environments and shed light on the slowly emerging suburban culture.\\"Bruce Museum, Greenwich CT Institutions holding Lewis' work include the Brooklyn Museum,Works of Martin Lewis in the collection of the Brooklyn Museum the Smithsonian American Art Museum,Works of Martin Lewis in the collection of the Smithsonian The Philadelphia Museum of Art Works of Martin Lewis in the collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art and others.

Judy Mazel was a devout practicing Jew and was raised in a conservative Ashkenazi Jewish home. Biography Mazel was born in Chicago on December 20, 1943 as the youngest of three sisters. She moved to California but failed to become a professional actor. She began to struggle with her weight and began writing several diet books. Mazel had no formal training in either medicine or nutrition when she invented The Beverly Hills Diet. Her weight loss diet advocated that dieters eat only one type of food at a time. The Beverly Hills Diet advised that dieters never eat carbohydrates and proteins in the same meal. The first 10 days of the diet consisted only of fruit. On Day 11, bagels and corn on the cob were added to the fruit. No complete protein was added until Day 19 when steak or lobster were permitted. Mazel opened a clinic in Beverly Hills, following the success of her book. She worked with as many as 250 dieters a week. Mazel, herself, claimed to have lost 72 pounds by following her own advice. Reception Critics, including many nutritionists, attacked the Beverly Hills Diet as dangerous and unscientific.Butler, Kurt. (1992).

They claimed that many dieters lost weight simply because the Beverly Hills Diet was low in calories. The diet often made many nutritionists' lists of their top 10 fad diets. Nutrition experts have described the Beverly Hills Diet as quackery and based on the discredited idea of food combining. Celebrities, however, embraced the Mazel's book. Noted followers of The Beverly Hills Diet included journalist and California First Lady, Maria Shriver, as well as Sally Kellerman, Engelbert Humperdinck and Linda Gray. Death Judy Mazel died of peripheral vascular disease at St. John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California, on October 12, 2007.

The film was written by Harold Ramis, Gene Stupnitsky, and Lee Eisenberg and stars Jack Black and Michael Cera. Its story follows Zed and Oh, two hunter-gatherers who travel to the city of Sodom after being banished from their tribe. Problems quickly emerge during their journey, as they encounter several biblical figures along the way. The film was produced by Judd Apatow's production company The Apatow Company and was released on June 19, 2009. It grossed $19.6 million in its opening weekend and $62.4 million worldwide, against a budget of $60 million. It was generally negatively reviewed, receiving only a 14% approval rating based on 173 votes on Rotten Tomatoes. This marked the final film directed, produced, written and starring Harold Ramis before his death in February 2014. Plot Zed (Jack Black) is a hunter and Oh (Michael Cera) is a gatherer. After being informed that Zed ate from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, the shaman (Bill Hader) and Marlak (Matthew Willig) banish him from the tribe. His hut destroyed after Zed burns the village down by accident, Oh reluctantly joins Zed on his journey to discover all the world has to offer. Along the way, they encounter Cain and Abel (David Cross and Paul Rudd). Cain kills Abel with a boulder in an act of rage and informs Zed and Oh that they must escape with him or else he will be accused of killing Abel. Afterwards, Zed and Oh find that the girls they want to \\"lay with\\", Maya (June Diane Raphael) and Eema (Juno Temple), from their former tribe have been captured and are being sold into slavery. They try to buy the girls' freedom, but end up being sold as slaves themselves, as Cain had been looking for a way to rid himself of his murder's witnesses. Whilst in transport, the slave caravan containing Oh, Zed, Maya, Eema and others from their tribe is attacked and overpowered by Sodomites, though Zed and Oh successfully escape and hide in the desert but lose track of the now Sodomite-led slave caravan. Still resolved to free the slaves and knowing the new destination of the caravan, Zed and Oh determinedly journey on and pass by a mountain where they find Abraham (Hank Azaria) about to kill his son Isaac (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). Zed stops them, letting Abraham believe Abraham's Deity sent him to do so. Abraham takes them to his Hebrew village and tells them about the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. Zed and Oh head off for Sodom after Abraham decides to circumcise them. As they arrive in Sodom, they are captured. Cain, now a Sodomite soldier, saves them from being sodomized, calling them his \\"brothers\\". The two recalled that they were sold by Cain as slaves and Cain apologizes and offers them food. While being given a tour of the city by Cain, Zed and Oh are offered by Cain to become guards. Shortly after they become guards and are patrolling the city they see the princess Inanna (Olivia Wilde), who is fasting because she feels guilty that most of the city is starving. Inanna notices (and is herself inspired by) Zed and has him invited to a party that night, from which she has him surreptitiously pulled aside for clandestine discussion. Inside the palace, Zed sees Maya and Eema serving as slaves, but Oh is forced to follow the very effeminate High Priest around the palace while Zed meets with Princess Inanna, who asks him to enter the Holy of Holies and tell her what it is like, thinking that Zed is the \\"Chosen One\\". Inside the temple, Zed encounters Oh, who is hiding from the high priest (Oliver Platt). There, they get into a heated argument and are ratted on by an eavesdropping Cain, then imprisoned for going inside the temple. The two are sentenced to be stoned to death but Zed convinces the Sodomites to have mercy, so they are instead sentenced to hard labor until they die from work. The king then announces that he will be sacrificing his daughter and two virgins (Maya and Eema), who were also ratted out by Cain as \\"followers of the Chosen One\\" as a gift to the gods. The growing crowd, already at its breaking point from the famine, reacts negatively as Princess Inanna is already very popular for her regular displays of solidarity with the people, who would be losing an important ally from within the King's Court if she were removed. Zed interrupts the ceremony and Oh instigates a riot with the exclamation \\"The Chosen One Comes\\"! Abraham arrives with the Hebrews to help overthrow the King. Oh and Eema lie with each other inside the palace, which not only consummates their relationship, but also means that Eema cannot be sacrificed. They then come out to help Zed subdue the other soldiers, who have already turned on and killed the King, and together Zed and Oh also stop the High Priest from sacrificing Maya. The crowd is ready to proclaim Zed as the Leader being the \\"Chosen One\\" but Zed, though initially caught up in the moment, sees the expressions of his sister and best friend, now a couple (a pairing Zed had long hoped for), and belatedly recalls that his love for them and Maya far outstrips his desire of a Savior persona. Instead, Zed lets a personally grateful Inanna rule, and becomes an explorer with Maya (and expresses his sincere and profound gratitude for her companionship). Oh becomes the leader of the village where the whole adventure started. The two say their goodbyes, and head their separate ways.

Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade B- on scale of A to F. Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film a \\"fair-good\\" review of 2.5 out of 4 stars stating that \\"Year One won't join his list of essential comedies, the ones Ramis helped create as writer, director, performer or combination thereof.\\" Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film 2 out of 4 stars complaining that the film \\"is scattershot and silly, squandering its potential by relying on juvenile bawdy humor\\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 1 star out of 4, stating that the film \\"is a dreary experience, and all the ending accomplishes is to bring it to a close\\". Kyle Smith of the New York Post gave the film 1.5 stars out of 5 saying it was \\"mediocre at best.\\" =Box office= Year One opened at #4 at the US box office in its opening weekend.. The film eventually grossed $43,337,279 in US ticket sales, and a further $19,020,621 worldwide, for a total of $62,357,900. Its production budget was $60 million.

Function  NPM1 is associated with nucleolar ribonucleoprotein structures and binds single- stranded and double-stranded nucleic acids, but it binds preferentially G-quadruplex forming nucleic acids. It is involved in the biogenesis of ribosomes and may assist small basic proteins in their transport to the nucleolus. Its regulation through SUMOylation (by SENP3 and SENP5) is another facet of the protein's regulation and cellular functions. It is located in the nucleolus, but it can be translocated to the nucleoplasm in case of serum starvation or treatment with anticancer drugs. The protein is phosphorylated. Nucleophosmin has multiple functions: # Histone chaperones # Ribosome biogenesis and transport # Genomic stability and DNA repair # Endoribonuclease activity # Centrosome duplication during cell cycle # Regulation of ARF-p53 tumor suppressor pathway # RNA helix destabilizing activity # Inhibition of caspase-activated DNase # Prevents apoptosis when located in nucleolus  Clinical significance  NPM1 gene is up-regulated, mutated and chromosomally translocated in many tumor types. Chromosomal aberrations involving NPM1 were found in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, acute promyelocytic leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and acute myelogenous leukemia. Heterozygous mice for NPM1 are vulnerable to tumor development. In solid tumors NPM1 is frequently found overexpressed, and it is thought that NPM1 could promote tumor growth by inactivation of the tumor suppressor p53/ARF pathway; on the contrary, when expressed at low levels, NPM1 could suppress tumor growth by the inhibition of centrosome duplication. Of high importance is NPM involvement in acute myelogenous leukemia, where a mutated protein lacking a folded C-terminal domain (NPM1c+) has been found in the cytoplasm in patients. This aberrant localization has been linked to the development of the disease, and is associated with improved clinical outcomes. Strategies against this subtype of acute myelogenous leukemia include the refolding of the C-terminal domain using pharmalogical chaperones and the displacement of the protein from nucleolus to nucleoplasm, which has been linked to apoptotic mechanisms. It has also been shown that in the context of clonal hematopoiesis of undetermined significance harboring a DNMT3A mutation, subsequent NPM1 mutations drive progression into overt myeloproliferative neoplasm.  Interactions  NPM1 has been shown to interact with * AKT1, * BARD1, * BRCA1, and * nucleolin. Nucleophosmin has multiple binding partners: # rRNA # HIV Rev and Rex peptide # p53 tumor suppressor # ARF tumor suppressor # MDM2 (mouse double minute 2, ubiquitin ligase) # Ribosome protein S9 # Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) # Exportin-1 (CRM1, chromosome region maintenance) # Nucleolin/C23 # Transcription target of myc oncogene  References   Further reading         * Category:Genes on human chromosome 5 ","title":"NPM1"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},L={class:"card-container"};function I(s,e,n,c,u,i){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),o(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your bitcoinü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",L,[(t(!0),o(h,null,p(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),w(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const R=d(B,[["render",I]]),H=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/8.md","filePath":"drive/8.md"}'),x={name:"drive/8.md"},K=Object.assign(x,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{H as __pageData,K as default};
