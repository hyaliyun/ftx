Description The biological form of Polygala vulgaris is hemicryptophyte scapose,Pignatti S. - Flora d'Italia ‚Äì Edagricole ‚Äì 1982. Vol. II, pag. 32 as its overwintering buds are situated just below the soil surface and the floral axis is more or less erect with a few leaves. Polygala vulgaris reaches on average in height. The stems have many branches and are woody at the base. It has alternating pointed leaves, almost glabrous, 2 to 4 mm wide and 10 to 20 mm long. Basal leaves are spatulate, with rounded apex, while the upper leaves are lanceolate. The flowers are gathered in long terminal inflorescences. The colour of the corolla varies between blue and violet, it can rarely occur in purple forms. The flower's outer three sepals are normally small, green and insignificant, whilst the inner two sepals are bigger. The inner sepals are usually shorter than the petals. The stalks of the eight stamens are joined together to form a tube, and united with this tube, one on either side, are two tiny petals. On the lower side of the flower lies the third petal; it too, is joined to the stamen tube, but it is larger, and fringed. The flowering period extends from May through July. Common milkwort is quite similar to the heath milkwort (Polygala serpyllifolia), but in this species the inner sepals are usually longer than the petals. The heath milkwort can be all the same colours except for white. These four possible colours account for the milkworts' Irish folk- name of 'four sisters'. Distribution This species is widespread in Europe, in Asia up to Japan and in US (Oregon and Michigan).Plants Habitat Common milkwort grows in meadows, slopes, edges of forests, heaths, sunny woods, dunes and grasslands. It is frequent in patches on calcerous grassland, from sea level up to 2200 meters. Flower of Polygala vulgaris Culture In Scandinavia, it was called Freya's hair, but after the introduction of Christianity, it was renamed after the Virgin Mary.Sch√∂n, Ebbe. (2004). Asa- Tors hammare, Gudar och j√§ttar i tro och tradition. F√§lt & H√§ssler, V√§rnamo. p. 228. Medicinal uses According to Classical and Renaissance writers common milkwort was used medicinally as an infusion to increase the flow of a nursing mother's milk.

The building was completed in 1905. It is located on University Avenue, just north of Bader Lane. The building is named in honour of Principal George Munro Grant. It regularly is used as a symbol of the university. Many ceremonial events, plays, and concerts take place in Grant Hall. Classes rarely take place in the hall but due to the large, open space, exams sometimes are scheduled. All university convocation is done in Grant Hall.  History  Grant Hall was built as part of a broader campus expansion plan from 1902 to 1912. Originally, the building was to be funded and named after the Frontenac County Council. The council withdrew financial support for the building in 1901 however, due to the anti-prohibition stance that Principal George Munro Grant had at the time. As a result, in 1902 the student population fundraised over $35,000 needed to complete the building. The building was finished in 1905 and named posthumously in honour of George Munro Grant and his 25 year anniversary as the university's principal. The building was designed by Symons and Rae, a Toronto-based architectural firm that also designed other early buildings on campus. For a time during World War I it was also used as a military hospital.  Architecture and features  The main exterior of the building is cladded in limestone and features design in the Romanesque-style. A large, iconic feature is the square clock tower with belfry.

One of the most dynamic and fastest growing sectors in the Philippines is the information technology‚Äìbusiness process outsourcing (IT-BPO) industry. The industry is composed of eight sub-sectors, namely, knowledge process outsourcing and back offices, animation, call centers, software development, game development, engineering design, and medical transcription. The IT-BPO industry plays a major role in the country's growth and development. History  In 1995, the Special Economic Zone Act, thus establishing the Philippine Economic Zone Authority, was passed by the Philippine Congress. This Act provided lower area requirements for developments and tax incentives, which consequently attracted foreign investors. In 1997, SYKES opened its doors in the Philippines, becoming the first multinational call center to operate in the country. In November 2001 visit of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to the US, she addressed an Information Technology (IT) Forum in New York and Six (6) Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) were signed by the following: 1\\\\. ICP Venture Partners, Inc. and Ambergis Solutions, Inc. 2\\\\. Customer Contact Center, Inc.(C3) (Ph) and Source One Communications (US) 3\\\\. Corporate Information Solutions (CIS) and Information Builders 4\\\\. Immequire (RP) and Tele Response Center, Inc. (US) 5\\\\. ePLDT, Inc. and Echostar Communications Corporation 6\\\\. ePLDT, Inc. and Teletech Holdings, Inc. The signing of MOUs started the growth of BPO industry in the Philippines, ''' Ambergis Solutions was established that year as a call center for US-based clients in the utilities, IT, travel & hospitality, telecommunications and financial services industries, and hired 5,500 employees. Immequire was a call center based in Arlington, Virginia that came to operate one of the fastest growing contact centers in the Philippines. Source One Communications put up a call center in Eastwood Cyberpark. The American company Echostar and ePLDT established a $5.5- million call center in Makati City located at Reposo corner Jupiter Streets with an initial 500 seats. Teletech, whose founder-CEO Kenneth Tuchman invested heavily and employed more than 21 thousand workers in the Philippines during PGMA's administration. (Ref: Department of Trade Industry, New York Office) Also in the same year, a US-Based outsourcing center called the \\"People Support\\" moved its operations moved to the Philippines, generating 8,400 jobs for the country. Bong Borja, its CEO, became president of the BPO Association of the Phiippines. In 2003, the Convergys Corporation opened up two more call centers in the Philippines. It was at that time when Jack Freker, the president of Convergys Corporation, announced the incorporation of the Philippines in the revenue generation plan and the global expansion of the company. In 2005, accounting for 2.4% of the country's GDP, the Philippine acquired over 3% of the global BPO market. A year after, with ePLDT Ventus leading in the BPO industry, domestic economy increased by 5.4% and 11,000 more people were employed. In 2010, the Philippines was then declared the world's BPO capital. From this point, the BPO industry continued to grow and generate more revenue, with the industry providing the most job opportunities in the private sector. Since the 1980s, unemployment rate stayed between 8‚Äì11% in the Philippines. Even if the economy did have some growth, there was always the problem of job generation. The BPO industry has the most substantial contribution to economic growth, yet it only employs 1% of the labor force. The MTPDP (Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan 2004‚Äì2010) has set a target to create \\"1.5 million jobs a year between 2004 and 2010, or a total of 10 million jobs by 2010.\\" Though the government came short of this success, in 2006 the government was able to identify nine employment-generating factors and these are cyber services, aviation, agribusiness, health services, mining, creative industries, hotels and restaurants, medical tourism and overseas employment. The BPO sector only accounted for 0.075% of the GDP in 2000 but rose to 2.4% in 2005 which indicated a great potential for generating employment. In this sector alone, it reached a staggering one million workers by 2010 and accounted for 27% of all new jobs.  BPO setups (captive markets and offshoring/third party outsourcing)  Due to the lower cost of producing specific goods or services in another country, outsourcing has become a common business strategy for many multinational firms. There are two common practices of outsourcing and these are using third party outsourcing or a captive market. These two differ based on the level of risk management, cost effectiveness or the need for managerial control. In the Philippines Captive Markets seem to be gaining some growth although the economic landscape still has third party holding the majority industry presence. This is due to the fact that in recent cases of crises there have been observations on positive growth for third party outsourcing firms as opposed to captive markets. This event lead to the perception of captive markets as being less efficient than that of third party outsourcing.Convergys Call Center in Baguio (example of a third party outsourcing firm) =Third party outsourcing= Project based outsourcing This is primarily used for business activities with irregular frequencies or one-off projects. The usual costing method makes use of time and material costs as variable costs and the fixed costs Dedicated development center This is primarily used in business cases when there are hanging requirements. In this specific model it could be used for some long- term goals for developing technology or software. This is preferred when resource requirements are lower in the outsourced country than the home country hence developing a comparative advantage. The customers (multinational firms) are charged for fixed fees, which are the wages of full-time employees. =Captive markets= Wells Fargo DavenportThis set up is preferred when core or crucial business activities are needed to be run at cheaper costs. The rationale for employing such a setup is to cater to long term strategic plans involving high managerial control. In this case there are two major ways of setting up a captive market and these are the DIY or 'Start From Scratch' model and the Build Operate Transfer model. This way, the business practices and operations are still run within and by the firm which mitigates risk of disclosure of sensitive information. In the Philippines there are examples of these setups such as American Express, JP Morgan, Wells Fargo and the currently growing Capital One which are both American based multinational companies. Start from scratch model The usual flow is for the company to develop all its resources in the new designated area or country of operations. This involves the beginning of the model which is the purchasing of property and equipment and due diligence lasts up to the point of running the BPO center itself. The acquisition of property and equipment is done by contacting a third party liaison in the country of operation. This model is preferred by the companies that have high levels of market knowledge and analytics. Build operate transfer model In this model, the practice is to contact a 3rd party vendor in order to develop a contract in which the vendor is the one who develops the property, sources the employees and manages the BPO center for the first designated period or amount of time. After which the company who contracted the vendor comes in and takes over the operations. The common practice is to have managerial and training staff of the company join at some midpoint of the period of the vendor's development to have specialized training in order for the employees to meet company standards. This model is preferred by companies that do not have any specialized expertise in the new country of operations hence needing a local partner or vendor to assist with market entry strategies.  Growth and impact  Government support was key to the growth of the business processing outsource industry. To promote increased investment in the industry, the Omnibus Investment Act was amended to include ICT in the investment priority plan. Incentives, tax holidays, PEZA accreditation were given to the firms providing ICT services. With the Philippines being the 39th largest economy in the world, the country continues to be a promising prospect for the BPO Industry. Just in August 2014, the Philippines hit an all-time high for employment in the BPO industry. From 101,000 workers in 2004, the labor force in the industry has grown to over 930,000 in just the first quarter of 2014. Growth in the BPO industry continues to show significant improvements with an average annual expansion rate of 20%. Figures have shown that from $1.3 Billion in 2004, export revenues from BPO has increased to over $13.1 Billion in 2013. The IT and Business Process Association of the Philippines (IBPAP) also projects that the sector will have an expected total revenue of $25 Billion in 2016. This growth in the industry is further promoted by the Philippine government. BPO is highlighted by the Philippines Development Plan as among the 10 high potential and priority development areas. To further entice investors, government programs include different incentives such as tax holidays, tax exemptions, and simplified export and import procedures. Additionally, training is also available for BPO applicants. Trends in the industry Trend #4: shifting from hardware storage to cloud servers. (Server rooms for storing data)With the Philippines BPO industry getting more competitive the same trends can be forecasted to occur in the country as with the rest of the world. Arguably it is in the best interest of BPOs in the country to adapt new practices and leverage technologies to keep up with the pace and meet the evolving demand of clients. The following are the predicted industry trends for the year 2015: =Better information security= Security breaches threaten outsourcing industries as the nature of the work involves handling sensitive client information. With 2014 ending in a security breach of Sony pictures' security, businesses are making security a top priority in order to mitigate the negative effects on the reputation of outsourcing firms brought about by security breaches. =Strategic balanced-shore outsourcing= To address issues such as schedule conflicts between service providers and clients, outsourcing firms are starting to provide a more flexible operation scheme in the form of balanced-shore outsourcing (a combination of at-home, on-site, nearshore, onshore or offshore outsourcing solutions) in order to meet their needs. =Booming blogging and social media outsourcing= Given the rising popularity of the different outsourcing firms in the country, the need for more talent on digital advertising is needed by these firms to expand their customer base and keep customer loyalty with their firms. Recently the common practice of multinational companies, the customer to the outsourcing firms is to now have short term contracts with the local outsourcing firm of a designated country to keep up their efficiency and to grab possible price reductions when availing of outsourcing services. =Popularity of cloud-based software= In terms of technology, another practice that is now being more commonly applied is the use of cloud based software to store data. Such practices, if adapted, can mitigate the cost and risk of having to keep and maintain large data storing hardware.  Future outlook  For the year 2016, The BPO industry of the Philippines is projected to experience an overall positive growth rate. Activity in the industry appears to be robust enough such that the industry's projected total income range would reach $20 to $27 billion by 2016 and $40 to $55 billion by 2020. The Industry, currently holding about 1 million directly employed employees, is also projected to increase employment by providing a total of about 1.3 to 1.5 million new jobs, which would consist of employees directly and indirectly employed. In terms of the Philippines credit ratings, there has been statements that the current and future credit rating would hold, if not increase, this being driven by the constant economic growth the country is enjoying which a good portion is attributed to being the contribution of the BPO industry. For the local industry sectors, the leading subsector are those of voice functions or the call centers. According to the article, Philippines BPO industry has now taken over India‚Äôs spot as the leading call center country and due to this event, the subsector is projected to continue holding the largest contribution to the industry's growth in the following years. According to a UA&P; (University of Asia and the Pacific) industrial economist, the voice sub sector is projected to continue a robust growth rate until 2020, but is projected to slow down or degrade by the end of that year due to the speculation of the BSP (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, Philippines Central Bank) that a shift in reliance from voice sources of information will occur turning the demand to non-voice information sources. = Forecasted threats = Though the industry outlook is positive on the overall, there remains the issue of forecasted threats caused by policy shifts to be undertaken by the country. One said issue is that of the proposal of changes for tax holidays, the temporary reductions or eliminations of taxes. The proposal discusses the reduction of tax holidays to be implemented for the BPO industry with the compromise of having their income tax from 30% to 15%. For the next 15 years. According to Industry characters, the threat here is that, though tax costs would decrease the change, even if diminished to 10%, might serve as a deterrent for foreign companies to enter the Philippine market due to a reduction of the country's competitive advantage. Other key challenges to the BPO industry are the lack of well- trained employees as well as high turnover rates, the rate at which employees are replaced, which is said to reach as high as 50% of employees in the industry during 2014. The 4th Industrial Revolution technologies will be another expected threat to the Philippine BPO industry. They will have significant economic, productivity and employment impacts on the industry and expect to narrow gap between the Philippines and India, two big industries in the BPO sector. IBPAP (IT & Business Process Association Philippines) estimates that the overall market will mature and grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.2% from 2016 to 2022, slower than the CAGR of 17% from 2010 to 2016. 43,000 low-skilled jobs will become obsolete as a result of automation, while 388,000 new mid-skilled jobs and 309,000 higher-skilled jobs will be created by 2022 as the industry moves up the value chain.IBPAP 2018, The IT-BPM Industry = Opportunities = Though the shift in demand of voice information is an issue to be faced by the industry, this has already been forecasted since 2014\\\\. The industry is also projected to shift with the demand in terms of having new firms enter the country or expanding the services provided by having KPOs or Knowledge Process outsourcing which could then cater to new demand and fulfill a wide set of roles. These roles would be as follows: Market research, Fraud analytics, Equity research and investment, banking Insurance and actuarial Engineering services, Web development, Data integration, Project management Research and development, Medical transcript preparation and legal processes. Considering the current advantages of lower labor cost and large English-speaking workforce in the Philippines, relevant training programs of lower-skilled jobs to prevent job mismatches and sufficient government funding for this purpose will be essential for the transition from the BPO to the KPO. To train the Filipino workforce for the BPO industry, the TESDA (Technical Education and Skills Development Authority) has rolled out Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) programs.TESDA, ‚ÄúTVET Programs‚Äù, https://www.tesda.gov.ph/About/TESDA/24 However, while TVET funding has risen, the BPO industry only got a minor allocation of limited training resources, with most funding currently invested into non-BPO industries such as tourism, electrical and electronics, construction and health care. For human capital development and sustainable development in the BPO industry, more researches on other countries and funding to upskill and reskill BPO workforce are required.  Issues  = Health issues = Call center operations floorThe call/contact centers, being the largest sub-sector in the Philippine BPO industry, have been a major subject on a case study on health and working conditions. Some commonly identified health problems are as follows: employees experience back and shoulder pains, due to the workstation setups and monitor levels, several have complained about experiencing throat irritations due to dealing with multiple calls a day coupled with a high stress work environment and concerns regarding the employees' hearing being damaged due to most of these workers being exposed to higher noise levels. There have also been some negative effects to the psychosocial aspect of health with regard to these call/contact center workers. There exists multiple job stressors in the workplace such as irregular work schedules interfering with social and family life, irregular hours causing trouble with transportation regarding safety and availability of such mediums and fast-paced workloads. The case study addresses that these psychosocial stressors may also be a major cause or amplifier with regards to the health issues stated above. = Economic issues = The BPO industry is the fastest growing sector in the country and is expected to overtake OFW remittances in 2017. Because of this rapid growth, the question arises whether or not this growth is inclusive. Negros Occidental Governor Alfredo Mara√±on Jr said that IT will close the gap between the rich and the poor: \\"65% of our population is below 35 years old. Make your future bright. I believe that IT is the answer to your future.\\" However, a 2012 report by the Asian Development Bank notes that the growth in the BPO industry has barely trickled down to most of the Philippine population. The report notes that there is only a weak link between the industry's growth and the development of the country mainly because of the high unemployment and underemployment rates; the BPO industry was the fastest growing sector from 2005 to 2012 but only took in 1% of the labor force. ADB Philippine Country Senior Economist Norio Usi notes in the report that the industry only hires college graduates, leaving little to no chance for people with moderate skills and no college degrees to take part in the industry's growth. Despite the country's abundance of English-speaking, young college educated work force, the country's poor infrastructure and slow internet connectivity also negatively influences prospective foreign investors' decision in investing in the country's growing BPO industry.

His cousin is former South African international David Callaghan. International career Kemp made his International debut in an ODI against Sri Lanka on 14 January 2001. He made his Test debut a week later also against Sri Lanka. He was taken on the tour of the West Indies in the 2000/2001 season but he did not score many runs and was involved in a controversy when he admitted smoking marijuana with 6 South African players. He was selected for eight more One day games but again he disappointed and was dropped. He was out of the South African side for nearly three years until he was selected to play in the home series against England. In this series Kemp impressed with his big hitting with him smashing 80 runs from 50 balls in an innings that included 7 sixes. Following his performances he was picked for the series against Zimbabwe and in the match at Durban he hit 53 from 21 balls in an innings that included 5 sixes. He was then taken on his second tour of the West Indies where he made an impressive 65 at Trinidad. He was then selected to represent Africa in the Afro-Asian Cup although he batted lower down the order and struggled. In the South African season of 2005/2006 he showed that he is a match winner when he blasted 73 from 64 at Bloemfontein. Kemp then went on his first tour of India where he showed he was able to bat on slower pitches. He went on the South African tour of Australia where he made a rare appearance in a Test Match when he and Jacques Rudolph formed a partnership that rescued a draw for South Africa at Perth. He was not picked for the second Test and has not been picked in a Test Match since. He struggled in the VB Series that involved Sri Lanka, Australia and South Africa with him averaging just 17.00. He quickly returned to form when Australia toured South Africa as he made 51 from 41 balls at Newlands Cape Town. He was selected in South Africa's squad for the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy in India where he showed he is more than just a big hitter when he made 64 from 110 balls in a partnership with Mark Boucher where he along with Mark Boucher set the record for the highest 6th wicket stand in ICC Champions Trophy(131) 26 November 2006, in the third ODI of the series between India and South Africa, his side were at 137 for 7 when Kemp came in and smashed his way to his maiden ODI century with the help of Andrew Hall. Together they put on a world record 8th wicket stand of 138 and took their score to 274, with Kemp named Man of the Match. He also showed that he is a useful medium pace bowler when he took three wickets at St George's Park Port Elizabeth. He was selected in the 30 man provisional squad for the 2007 Cricket World Cup. Indian Cricket League In 2008, Kemp joined the rebel Indian Cricket League, which was not recognised by any cricket board or the ICC, thereby ending his international career with South Africa. In the ICL, Kemp played for the Hyderabad Heroes team. County Cricket In 2003, Kemp played in England for Worcestershire, with a best bowling return of 5/48 in the County Championship against Glamorgan in June, and a top score of 90 against Hampshire in the same competition in September. On 20 March 2008, the ECB banned Kemp and four other Kolpak players because of their involvement in the ICL. The decision was, however, overruled and Kemp was cleared to play for Kent, with whom he has a two-year deal. However, changes to the Kolpak regulations meant Kemp could not return to the county for 2010.

History Vestre Cemetery Assistens Cemetery in 1897 Vestre Kirkeg√•rd was opened on 2 November 1870 to accommodate an urgent need for adequate burial places for the growing population of Copenhagen. Assistens Cemetery, till then the main cemetery of the city, had long been unable to cope with the increasing number of burials. Hans J√∏rgen Holm, who was the resident architect for the Copenhagen Burial Services, in collaboration with landscape architect Edvard Gl√¶sel (1858-1915) and city engineer Charles Ambt were responsible for the overall planning and landscaping of the new cemetery. First a burial place for the poor, Vestre Kirkegaard became the principal burial place of Copenhagen during the 1990s. The setting The cemetery is noted for its scenery, offers a maze of dense groves, open lawns, winding paths, hedges, overgrown tombs, monuments, tree- lined avenues, ponds and other garden features. Many graves have distinctive gravestones, sculptures or large mausoleums and are eclectically placed. The cemetery's grounds have a variety of trees with many rare species and is a haven to birds and small mammals. Buildings The North Chapel Almost all the buildings in the grounds have been designed by Hans J√∏rgen Holm or Holger Jacobsen who succeeded him as resident architect for the Copenhagen Burial Services. Holm designed both the North Chapel and South Chapel (1906) as well as an office building the gate at the main entrance. It is unclear who were responsible for the design of the former inspector's house just inside the main entrance. The East Chapel was inaugurated in 1914 to a design by Holger Jacobsen but only remained in use until 1926. The Crossroads Project The remains of the South Chapel The Crossroads Project (Danish: Stjernevejsprojektet), designed by Sch√∏nher Landskab, is a landscape project centred on the remains of the West Chapel, now serving as a pavilion for contemplation. It was created in 2003 after Copenhagen Municipality arranged a competition for the regeneration of an area characterized by the abandoned South Chapel of the cemetery and elm trees dead from Dutch elm disease. The complex is intended to serve a dual purpose both relating to the location's function as a burial place and as an open space and meeting place in the city, for those seeking peace and silence. One of the four paths The complex consists of two intersecting axes with the former Southern Chapel in its centre. The chapel was partly demolished, leaving only the central part as an open pavilion-like domed structure. The building is partly overgrown by ivy. The surrounding garden spaces of the two axes, creating a Greek cross, are confined by tall yew hedges and have a grass surface. Embedded in the lawns of the cross arms are narrow, rust coloured paths made of oxidized iron plates, flanked by rows by cherry trees. At the end of each cross arm is a 9 metre tall rust coloured iron arch. The design of the project is inspired by Bramante's Tempietto in Rome and the baroque gardens of Villa Gori in Siena. The latter is characterized by the garden being contained in the two axes of the garden, instead of the axes being the connecting feature of the surrounding gardens as is normally the case. Monuments and artworks The memorial to British soldiers buried at Vestre Kirkeg√•rd Just inside the main entrance is Arne Bang's bronze statue En Falden (\\"A Fallen), which was installed in 1942 to commemorate the Danish soldiers that were killed when Denmark was occupied by Nazi Germany on 9 April 1940. In the North Chapel's courtyard garden are two reliefs by the artist Henrik Starcke, Death and Resurrection, which were installed in 1949. They were a gift from the Albertina Foundation. Nineteen British former prisoners of war, homeward bound, died at Copenhagen around New Year 1919. Among them were a Canadian, an Indian and an Australian from Tasmania. Each has a Commonwealth War Graves Commission headstone and a fine memorial, given by the Danes, was unveiled in their honour in 1920. In the Faroese section is a monument created by the painter Elof Risebye. The monument in the Greenlandic section 19 is from 1963 and was designed by the sculptor Jan Buhl.

He was named as the ICC ODI Player of the Year three times during his 15-year international career and also featured in Wisden Cricketers of the Decade at the end of 2019. De Villiers began his international career as a wicket-keeper-batsman, but he has played most often solely as a batsman. He batted at various positions in the batting order, but predominantly in the middle-order. Noted as one of the most innovative and destructive batsmen in the modern era, De Villiers is known for a range of unorthodox shots, particularly behind the wicket-keeper. He made his international debut in a Test match against England in 2004 and first played a One Day International (ODI) in early 2005. His debut in Twenty20 International cricket came in 2006. He scored over 8,000 runs in both Test and ODI cricket and is one of the very few batsmen to have a batting average of over fifty in both forms of the game. In limited overs cricket he is an attacking player. He holds the record for the fastest ODI century in just 31 balls. He also recorded the fastest ODI 50 and 150. De Villiers captained South Africa in all three formats, although after a series of injuries he stepped down from the Test captaincy. In 2017 he stepped down from captaining the national limited-overs teams and in May 2018 announced his retirement from all forms of international cricket. However, in January 2020 De Villiers expressed his intention to make an international comeback and play for South Africa in the 2020 T20 World Cup. Early life Abraham Benjamin de Villiers was born in Warmbad, South Africa, and enjoyed what he later described as the \\"really relaxed lifestyle up there, where everyone knows everyone\\". He was educated at Afrikaanse Ho√´r Seunskool in Pretoria along with teammate Faf du Plessis, returning home at weekends. His father was a doctor who had played rugby union in his youth, and he encouraged his son to play sports as a child. Career De Villiers is a right-handed batsman who accumulated over 8,000 runs in Tests including 22 centuries and 46 fifties. He holds the record for most Test innings without registering a duck (78), before being dismissed for nought against Bangladesh in November 2008. He also holds the second-highest individual score by a South African batsman, with 278 (not out). Until 2012 he was an occasional wicket-keeper for South Africa, although after the retirement of regular Test keeper Mark Boucher and under his own captaincy he has started to regularly keep wicket for the national side in Tests, ODIs and T20Is. He gave up wicket-keeping in 2015 and handed the gloves to debutant Quinton de Kock. He holds the records for the fastest 50 (16 balls), 100 (31 balls) and 150 (64 balls) of all time in One Day Internationals by any batsmen, and also holds the fastest hundred by a South African in Tests and the fastest 50 by South African in T20Is. He is a three-time ICC ODI player of the year, winning the award in 2010, 2014 and 2015. After the 2011 Cricket World Cup he succeeded Graeme Smith as captain of the national ODI side, and became Test captain after the second Test of the home series against England in 2015/16. He stepped down from Test captaincy in December 2016 due to an elbow injury which kept him out of the team for a long period. International career De Villiers in 2006 =Early career= After a spell in the South Africa U19 team, he made his debut for the Titans in 2003/4. He made his Test debut as a 20-year-old on 16 December 2004 against England at Port Elizabeth. He made a strong impression opening the batting, but was dropped down the order for the second Test and also handed the wicket- keeping gloves. In this match, he made a match-saving half-century from number seven. However, he found himself at the top of the order again for the final Test of the series. Despite a good tour of the Caribbean where he scored 178 to help South Africa seal a Test series win, his rapid progress was slowed on the tour of Australia in 2005. Despite playing Shane Warne well and becoming the second-youngest and second-fastest South African to reach 1,000 Test runs after Graeme Pollock, he struggled and made just 152 runs in 6 innings. He has been used in a similar fashion to Jonty Rhodes in ODIs, opening the innings, although he currently bats in the middle order. De Villiers gave the selectors a sign by producing his then highest one-day score of 92 not out, which included 12 fours and one six, from 98 balls against India in the 2006 winter series. De Villiers had a reputation as an outstanding fielder, typified by a diving run-out of Simon Katich of Australia in 2006, when he dived to stop the ball, and while still lying on his stomach facing away from the stumps, he tossed the ball backwards over his shoulder and effected a direct hit. This has also led people to make further comparisons of him to Jonty Rhodes, who was also one of the finest fielders of his generation. His fielding positions other than wicket-keeper are 1st and 2nd slip and cover. =2007 Cricket World Cup in West Indies= Competing in the 2007 Cricket World Cup, AB was in good form in ODIs having scored four 50s during the South Africa vs India/Pakistan (2007) matches. In the early stages of the tournament AB's form was poor with three failures including a duck against the Netherlands in a match where his team broke various records for batting, although he scored a 92 in the first round against Australia. He made his maiden ODI hundred, 146 from just 130 balls including 5 sixes and 12 fours, in the Super 8 game against West Indies on 10 April 2007. He had to bat with a runner for the latter stages of his innings and found every shot painful due to a combination of cramps, heat exhaustion and dehydration. His innings consisted of a second wicket partnership of 170 with Jacques Kallis and a third wicket partnership of 70 with Herschelle Gibbs. De Villiers' innings helped set up a total of 356/4 from 50 overs. His batting during the World Cup was inconsistent as he also failed to score on 4 occasions, itself a record. =Gaining attention= On 4 April 2008, De Villiers became the first South African to score a double century against India with his top score of 217. De Villiers scored an obdurate 174 that helped set up a ten-wicket win for South Africa in the second Test against England at Headingley Carnegie in Leeds in July 2008. This was followed by a 97 at The Oval before he came down the wicket trying to smash Monty Panesar for a boundary and was caught on the fence. In the first Test in Perth, De Villiers scored a match-winning century to help South Africa chase down the second-highest-ever fourth innings target of 414 with six wickets in hand. This was South Africa's first Test victory in Australia in 15 years and appeared to go a long way towards tilting world cricket's balance of power after over a decade of Australian dominance. De Villiers also took four diving catches in the course of the match, including one to dismiss Jason Krejza, a stunner at backward point. De Villiers only scored 11 runs in the second Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and made another low score in the first innings of the final Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground. In the second innings of that Test though, De Villiers scored a patient half-century as South Africa almost held on for an against-the-odds draw. During ODI series, in the 4th ODI in Adelaide, he played as wicket-keeper after Boucher was ruled out. He then scored 82 not out from 85 balls with 6 fours and a six to win the series and was named the man of the match. In the first Test of the return series at the Wanderers Stadium, De Villiers provided lone resistance in the first innings against a bowling attack led by pace bowler, Mitchell Johnson, scoring 104* off 185 balls with 9 fours and 1 six, while his teammates all fell for under 50. But in the second innings he made only 3 off 7. In the third Test, after centuries from Ashwell Prince and Jacques Kallis, De Villiers was the third centurion of the innings with a score of 163 off 196 balls with 12 fours and 7 sixes. This knock also tied the record for most sixes in an over as De Villiers, off the bowling of McDonald, hit four consecutive sixes. In the following 5-game ODI series, De Villiers played consistently, although starting badly in the first game, scoring only 2 runs. However, he went on to make 36*, 80, 84 and 38 and was named Player of the Series at the conclusion of game 5. He was rested for the two-match Twenty20 series against Zimbabwe and because Mark Boucher was injured as well Heino Kuhn donned the keeping gloves. De Villiers returned for the ODI series and also took over the gloves while Boucher was recovering. He did well against Zimbabwe scoring two centuries out of the three ODIs as South Africa comfortably won the three match series 3‚Äì0. His major challenge came against Pakistan for the two Twenty20 matches, where he kept wicket. In the first match, he was out for a second-ball duck off a superb delivery by Shoaib Akhtar. In the second T20I he scored 11 runs. He then participated in the five-match ODI series where South Africa were chasing 203 to win and he scored 51 before he was caught and bowled by Saeed Ajmal. In the second ODI he scored 29 as he was bowled by Shahid Afridi; in the same match, a flamboyant Abdul Razzaq played the greatest innings of his life to lift Pakistan to an unbelievable victory. During the third match, he scored 19 before he was stumped by Zulqarnain Haider. It turned out to be a mistake by the umpire as he had pressed the wrong button. In the fourth match, he missed out on a half- century while on 49 when he gave his wicket to the fielder at point. His good form in the series continued when he scored 61 in the final ODI as South Africa won by 57 runs and the series 3‚Äì2. For his performances in 2009 and 2010, he was named in the World Test XI by the ICC, and was also named in the World ODI XI in 2010. =2011 Cricket World Cup= AB de Villiers scored two successive centuries in the 2011 World Cup. He became the first South African to score two centuries in a single World Cup and the fifth batsman after Mark Waugh, Saeed Anwar, Rahul Dravid and Matthew Hayden to score two consecutive centuries in a single World Cup tournament. He also became the 16th batsman to score two or more centuries in one World Cup tournament. AB de Villiers' strike rate of 136.73 is the highest among South African batsmen who have scored centuries in World Cup matches. With his third player of the match award in World Cups, De Villiers is joint second with Jacques Kallis on the list of South African players with most match awards in World Cups. Lance Klusener heads the list with five awards. =Rising through the ranks= On 6 June 2011, then South Africa coach Gary Kirsten announced that AB de Villiers would be South Africa's new limited-overs captain. \\"I'm very excited but I'm also inexperienced. But I've learnt a lot the last seven years from an unbelievable captain,\\" said De Villiers, who had never captained a team at first-class level. \\"It's a big responsibility, but there'll be a fresh look in the side, which is good.\\" In the 2011‚Äì12 South African summer, De Villiers featured in the home series against Australia and against Sri Lanka. In the latter, he scored a century (160 not out) in South Africa's win in the third and deciding Test of the series. He was named the Player of the Series, having scored 353 runs at an average of 117.66. He then led South Africa for his first series since being appointed captain of the One Day International team. In his first match as captain, South Africa inflicted the heaviest defeat in Sri Lanka's history, with a 258-run win in Paarl on 11 January 2012. It was also the largest margin of victory (by runs) in an ODI match between two Test- playing teams. South Africa went on to win the ODI series, and De Villiers was named player of the series, having scored 329 runs at an average of 109.66, including a century (125 not out) in the fifth and final match in Johannesburg. On 10 July, De Villiers was handed full-time wicket-keeping duties after Mark Boucher announced retirement from cricket after suffering eye injuries from a hit from a bail the day before. On 4 February 2013, De Villiers equalled Jack Russell's record of 11 dismissals in a match. He also scored an unbeaten 103 off 117 balls in South Africa's second innings of the same match. In the process, he became the first wicket-keeper to score a century and claim 10 dismissals in a Test. On 18 March, during the third ODI match of Pakistan's tour of South Africa at Johannesburg, De Villiers and Hashim Amla shared the record for the highest third-wicket partnership in an ODI when they scored 238. De Villiers scored 12 fours and 3 sixes, and a total of 128. =Record breaking year= On 18 January 2015, De Villiers scored both the fastest fifty and the fastest century by a batsman in One Day International cricket, off 16 balls and 31 balls respectively and eventually scoring 149 runs off 44 balls in 59.5 minutes against West Indies. =2015 World Cup= De Villiers was one of the top performers at the 2015 Cricket World Cup scoring 482 runs at an average of 96.0 and strike rate of 144.0 during the tournament. On 27 February 2015, De Villiers scored 162 runs off 66 balls in a match against the West Indies in Pool B, leading South Africa to their second-highest total in World Cup history (408), at Sydney Cricket Ground. With this feat, he became the record holder for the fastest 50, 100 and 150 in One-Day International history. Under the captaincy of De Villiers, South Africa qualified for the semi-finals of the World Cup but lost to New Zealand in the match. De Villiers finished the tournament as the third-highest run-scorer with 482 runs, behind Martin Guptill and Kumar Sangakkara. At the end of the tournament, he was ranked number 1 in the ICC batsmen rating in One day International cricket and number 3 in the ICC batsmen rating in Test cricket. He was named in the 'Team of the Tournament' for the 2015 World Cup by the ICC. = 2016‚Äì2018 and retirement = On 6 January 2016, the second Test match between England and South Africa ended in a draw. After the end of the match, Hashim Amla resigned from the captaincy and de Villiers was chosen to captain South Africa for the last two matches. On 21 February 2016, de Villiers scored the fastest T20I fifty by a South African, in just 21 balls. He completed the innings with 79 runs in 29 balls and led South Africa to a clean sweep in the T20I series. On 18 January 2017, de Villiers ruled himself out from most of the Test matches and ultimately played in December 2017. However, a day before the Test match, Faf du Plessis picked up a viral infection, putting him in doubt for the match. On the morning of the Test, he was ruled out of the fixture, with AB de Villiers replacing him as captain. He also kept wicket during the match, as South Africa's wicket-keeper Quinton de Kock suffered a hamstring injury while batting on day one. He took eight catches in the match and the Test match finished inside two days, with South Africa winning by an innings and 120 runs. De Villiers returned for the Indian tour to South Africa in 2018. He stated he had given up wicket-keeping as his back could no longer handle the demand, and Faf du Plessis resumed his role as captain in all forms of the game. In the second Test match against Australia, he scored his 22nd Test century with a score of 126 not out off 146 balls in the first innings. His performance helped the team win the match by 6 wickets. On 23 May 2018, De Villiers announced his retirement from all forms of international cricket through a video uploaded to Twitter, in which he explained his decision. One of the statements in his monologue was \\"I have had my turn, and to be honest, I am tired.\\" A few weeks after his announcement about retiring from international cricket, he clarified and said that he will continue playing T20 leagues for a few more years. In January 2020, it was rumoured that de Villiers was in talks to make a comeback to the South African T20I side for the 2020 ICC Men's T20 World Cup. De Villiers, as well as South African director of cricket Graeme Smith and head coach Mark Boucher, confirmed these rumours. =International centuries= De Villiers has scored 22 Test and 25 ODI centuries. He scored his first Test century against England in 2005 and his first ODI century against West Indies in 2007. Domestic and franchise career Domestically de Villiers first played for Northerns, making his debut for the team in the 2003/04 Supersport Series. The team merged with Easterns to form the Titans side which de Villiers then played for in the 2004/05 season. His international duties mean that he has played only occasionally for the side since 2005, making a total of only nine first-class, 20 List A and 24 Twenty20 appearances for the side.AB de Villiers, CricketArchive. Retrieved 22 June 2019. =Twenty 20 franchise career= Since joining the league in its inaugural season, de Villiers has become one of the most successful batsmen in the Indian Premier League (IPL). After originally playing for Delhi Daredevils, he moved to Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) for US$1.5 million in the league's fourth season. Three of his four Twenty20 centuries have come in the IPL and as of June 2019 he has played in over 150 matches in the league. He has played match-winning innings for RCB and shown some destructive batting against bowlers especially in the death overs. Other than the IPL, de Villiers has played franchise T20 cricket for Barbados Tridents, Tshwane Spartans, Rangpur Riders and Lahore Qalandars in leagues across the world. Following his retirement from international cricket, his future in T20 franchise leagues was uncertain until he announced in July 2018 that he intended to continue to play in the IPL for \\"a few years\\". In September 2019, he was named in the squad for the Tshwane Spartans team for the 2019 Mzansi Super League tournament. For the 2019 series he represented Middlesex in the Vitality Blast Twenty20, providing both experience and an unbelievable amount of firepower to the squad. During the group stages he had the highest batting average. In October 2019, De Villiers had signed a 1-year deal with the Brisbane Heat in the Big Bash League franchise which is held in Australia during summer.  Playing style  He is sometimes referred to as \\"Mr. 360\\" due to his ability to play shots all around the wicket, and as \\"Superman\\" due to his acrobatic fielding. In T20 cricket he is seen as an attacking batsman who plays a range of unconventional shots.  Controversies  During the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup, and following South Africa losing their first three matches in the tournament, details emerged of De Villiers making himself available for selection for the national team squad on the day the squad was to be announced. He was not selected as he had not played any international cricket for his country leading up to the tournament, despite having been prompted to do so by South Africa's coach Ottis Gibson earlier in the year.AB de Villiers: South Africa have 'no regret' over not recalling ex- captain for World Cup, BBC Sport, 6 June 2019. Retrieved 22 June 2019. He has been criticised for his decision to play in franchise leagues rather than for his country. Personal life De Villiers proposed to his girlfriend, Danielle Swart, at the Taj Mahal in 2012, after five years of dating. The couple got married in March 2013, in Bela-Bela, South Africa. They have two sons. He is a devout Christian and has stated that his faith is crucial to his approach to life. He is also an accomplished guitar player and a singer. In 2010, he released a bilingual pop album entitled Maak Jou Drome Waar with his friend and South African singer Ampie du Preez. His autobiography, AB: The Autobiography was released in April 2020.

Throughout the 1800s the region was investigated for its mineral wealth. Iron ore of 70% iron content and manganese ores were found. In 1881 the industrial extraction of iron ore began, alongside other developments such as the construction of Kryvyi Rih railway. By 1884 over 100 000 tons of iron ore had been extracted, and the railway though Kryvyi Rih, 477 versts (505,6 km) long, from Yasynuvata station via Kryvyi Rih to Dolynska station had been opened. The production expanded rapidly in the next years. By 1896 there were 20 mines producing over 1 000 000 tonnes of ore in Kryvyi Rih Basin. Industrial expansion continued in the region up to 1917. Production dropped during the first world war. =Foundation and growth in Soviet Union= After the formation of the Soviet Union and the expulsion of Austro-Hungarian forces and then anti-communist forces under Anton Denikin occupying the region relative normalcy was resumed. Planning of the plant began in 1929, with the intention being to produce an integrated steel plant taking iron ore and carbon all the way to finished steel products.–ü–∞—Ä–∞–¥–æ–∫—Å–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–µ –≤–æ—Å–ø–æ–º–∏–Ω–∞–Ω–∏—è –æ –±—É–¥—É—â–µ–º –ö–†–ò–í–û–†–û–ñ–°–¢–ê–õ–ò.

In August 1934 the first metal was produced at Kryvorizhstal; later known as 'Kryvyi Rih Metallurgical Plant'. Before the onset second world war the plant operated with 3 Blast Furnaces (of 3 160 m3) and 2 open hearth furnaces along with a heat and power plant. In 1941 a blooming mill of 1.7 million tonnes p.a., fourth Blast Furnace and third open hearth furnace came on line shortly before nazi occupation.

Technically this was simply a paper exercise, three units had been always been designed to work jointly, and the factory facilities were on the same site. In 2004 it became a public company and was privatised. First privatization, 2004 Kryvorizhstal became internationally known when it was privatized in June 2004 for a sum of US$800 million, (4.26 billion Hryvnia.) against a government-set reserve price of $714 million, to a consortium called Investment-Metallurgical Union. This consortium included Rinat Akhmetov's SCM and Interpipe Group, controlled by then-President Kuchma's son-in-law Viktor Pinchuk. Higher offers from foreign investors including a joint bid from Severstal/Arcelor, and a bid from Tata Steel were rejected on bidding technicalities. The deal was widely criticized by the opposition and abroad as an example of corruption and state property mismanagement. By initiative of the new President Viktor Yushchenko, the privatization deal was dismissed by the court in June 2005, in order to sell the company again in a fair auction. 2005, Second privatisation and ArcelorMittal company At the time of the second privatisation the company had annually sales of $1897 million with a net profit of $378 million, and cash of $413 million. The plant had a production capacity of ~10 million tonnes of raw steel, and rolling capacity for under 7 million tonnes, and was able to source most of its requirements for iron ore and coke locally. The bidding process was broadcast live on Ukrainian television, with Arcelor, Mittal Steel and Vadim Novinsky's Smart Holdings bidding - Mittal Steel was the highest bidder and acquired a 93.02 percent stake in Kryvorizhstal on October 24, 2005, for 24.2 billion hryvnia (US$4.81 billion) \\\\- Mittal Steel was expected to finance the acquisition from its own cash reserves and from a $3 billion loan arranged with UK based Citigroup. The price exceeded analyst predictions of $3 billion, making it the largest privatization deal in the former Soviet Union.

The novels deal with the radical alteration of the history of World War II and the socio-historical changes that result when a technologically advanced naval task force from the year 2021 is accidentally transported back through time to 1942. The early chapters of the first book in the trilogy, Weapons of Choice, are set in the near future. Plot In 2021, a radical Islamic terrorist movement has declared a global jihad against the West and established a Caliphate in Indonesia, initiating a wholesale slaughter of Chinese nationals there. In response, a US-led multinational task force of advanced warships and submarines sails to Indonesia to launch a counterattack against the Caliphate forces and retake the archipelago. With the fleet is a research vessel, the Nagoya, which is testing top-secret weapons and stealth systems that use the latest developments in quantum physics. As the task force lies at anchor off the coast of East Timor preparing for deployment, the Nagoya conducts a full- scale test of its new systems but there is a catastrophic accident‚Äîthe experiment generates a massive rift in the time-space continuum, completely destroying the Nagoya and sending most of the fleet back in time to 1942. Many of the 2021 ships materialize in the middle of the US fleet that is steaming to engage the Japanese at the Battle of Midway, including one vessel which materializes into the structure of a 1942 ship, with horrific results. When the mystery fleet suddenly appears, the Americans mistake them for the enemy (due to the presence of Japanese vessels in the 2021 fleet) and they begin firing on them. With the crews of the 2021 fleet rendered helpless by \\"transition sickness\\", the computerized battle systems on their ships automatically activate, inflicting heavy damage and thousands of casualties on the 1942 fleet until the two forces work out what has happened and halt the battle. As the nature of the event dawns on the two fleets, the two commanders strike an uneasy truce and the combined fleet heads back to Pearl Harbor. The Americans then launch an intensive study into the 2021 fleet's futuristic computer and weapons technology, as well as the wealth of historical information which describes their own future - although many items of technology from the future fleet are stolen by unscrupulous sailors from 1942 and sold to the criminal underworld. Matters are further complicated by the fact that the chaotic nature of the Nagoya's \\"time bubble\\" has transported some 2021 ships to locations far from the main group, and these vessels variously fall into the hands of the Japanese, the Germans and the Soviets. After the Japanese capture an Indonesian ship from the 2021 fleet, they discover what they did not know in the conventional version of history - that the US fleet had not been crippled by the Pearl Harbor attack, as they thought, and that the Americans have broken their military codes and are fully aware of the Japanese battle plans. Acting on these revelations, Admiral Yamamoto immediately turns his fleet around, and the Battle of Midway never takes place. Another vessel is captured by the Germans and as they learn more about the future outcome of the war they halt and abandon their ill-fated invasion of Russia and prepare for an all-out assault on the United Kingdom. Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin become allies and purge their military forces of anyone they believe to be a traitor. The series goes on to explore the far- reaching effects of the Transition, which radically alters not merely the balance of power between the Axis and the Allies, but the entire course of WWII and global history. The Soviet Union uses the treaty with Germany to assemble a powerful and massive military and launch a large scale invasion into Asia and Eastern Europe, conquering a vast amount of territory. The plot shares a premise with the 1980 movie The Final Countdown, about a modern USN aircraft carrier which travels back in time to just before the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. The plot also has similarities to that of the series Zipang, about a Japanese missile destroyer transported back in time right before the Battle of Midway.

The discovery of a 13/14th-century copy of Clavis Sapientia confirms that the text was first written in Arabic by a Muslim author. Legacy A Renaissance tradition held that Artephius had been born in the first or second century and died in the twelfth, thanks to having discovered the alchemical elixir that made it possible to prolong life. In his Secret Book, Artephius indeed claims to be more than a thousand years old. In printed form, works attributed to Artephius became well known in the seventeenth century. A work Artefii clavis majoris sapientiae was printed in Paris in 1609. Later it would also appear within Volume IV of Theatrum Chemicum, printed originally in 1613. Then in 1624, Eirenaeus Orandus provided an English translation of the 'secret booke'. The Latin editions of Clavis Sapentia are highly abridged and lack the original diagrams found in the Arabic text.

Biography  Patel grew up in Bangalore. He played in 21 test matches from 1974 to 1977, and sustained a batting average of 29.45. He was also a bowler, but was never asked to deliver his right-arm off breaks for his national team. His highest test score was 115 not out. He was regarded as an excellent fielder normally covering areas around cover and point. He has a record of being a player who has never gone for a duck. While his international cricketing career was not particularly productive, he made 37 hundreds and over 11000 runs in first class cricket. His international career came to a premature end because of his suspect technique against genuine pace. At the time of his retirement, he held the Ranji Trophy records (since bettered) for most runs and hundreds. His talent first became evident as a student in Bishop Cotton Boys School, Bangalore, and he represented his country in a junior team that traveled to Australia. Throughout his career, he represented Karnataka state and captained the team to many victories. He and fellow international Gundappa Vishwanath formed a formidable batting pair. After his playing days he became cricket administrator. A Jagmohan Dalmiya (past President of the Indian Cricket Board (BCCI)) supporter, Patel was appointed the Director of the National Cricket Academy in India until he was replaced in 2005 by another ex-Test cricketer, Shivlal Yadav, the current director of the NCA. Brijesh Patel has also been the Hon. Secretary of the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) since 1999 and controls cricket in Karnataka. Some years ago he was also the Chairman of the National Selection Committee for the Indian national team and resigned after suffering a heart ailment. Brijesh Patel runs a private cricket coaching academy in Bangalore called B.P.C.A. (Brijesh Patel Cricket Academy), attended by more than 300 boys.

The incident was filmed by several media outlets, and caused a stir in Israel and elsewhere, despite Palestinian police attempts at confiscating the footage immediately after the incident.

Nurzhitz set out at 7 a.m. in his Ford Escort, picked up Avrahami and phoned his father at 9 a.m., stating that he had been ordered to turn up at an army base near the Israeli settlement of Beit El. The two reservist drivers made their way in a civilian vehicleAmi Pedahzur,The Triumph of Israel's Radical Right, OUP USA, 2012 p.153 towards their unit's assembly point near the settlement of Beit El. They had little army experience, were unfamiliar with the West Bank road system and drove through the military checkpoint outside Beitunia and headed straight into the Palestinian town of Ramallah 2 miles east of the checkpoint. Reaching a Palestinian Authority roadblock, where previously Israeli soldiers had been turned back, the reservists were detained by PA policemen and taken to the local police station at Ramallah's twin city el-Bireh, not far from Arafat's headquarters.Hillel Frisch, The Palestinian Military: Between Militias and Armies, pp.96‚Äì97. The arrest and detention coincided with the conclusion of a funeral service, attended by thousands of mourners, for Halil Zahran (17), a Palestinian youth who had been killed in clashes with Israeli forces two days earlier. Tensions were running high: over 100 Palestinians, nearly two dozen of them minors, had been killed in the preceding two weeks in violent protests with Israelis forces in Ramallah,Eve Spangler, Understanding Israel/Palestine: Race, Nation, and Human Rights in the Conflict, Springer 2015 p.183. and four days earlier, the badly beaten body of Issam Hamad (36) had been dumped outside of the city after being run over by a car, an autopsy revealed. His death, according to Marwan Bishara of Al Jazeera, was attributed by locals to settlers in Halamish.David Pratt Intifada, Casemate Publishers 2009 p.102: \\"For two weeks there had been intense clashes, with over 100 funerals of Palestinians killed, nearly two dozen of them children. Earlier that same week the pressure gauge had risen even further after the badly beaten body of another Palestinian, Issam Hamad, had been found dumped on the outskirts of Ramallah. Locals were in no doubt that Israeli settlers were to blame for his killing., To the horror of Sergeant Novesche and Corporal Avrahami, it was bang in the middle of this Ramallah tinderbox that they found themselves stuck that day. To make matters even worse, their fateful entrance to the town also coincided with the funeral of another 17-year-old Palestinian boy shot dead the day before by other Israeli troops.\\" Rumors quickly spread that Israeli undercover agents were in the building, and an angry crowd of more than 1,000 Palestinians gathered in front of the station calling for the death of the Israelis. Word that two soldiers were held in a Ramallah police station reached Israel within 15 minutes. According to Roni Shaked, the IDF itself thought initially that the two must have been \\"undercover agents\\". According to the Ramallah station chief, there were 21 policemen in the building, some of whom were cooks and administrative personnel, since many policemen had been dispersed throughout the city to control the crowd during the funeral. The IDF decided against a rescue operation. Soon after, Palestinian rioters stormed the building, overcame the Palestinian police and murdered and mutilated both soldiers. Both Haaretz and Maariv reported that approximately 13 Palestinian policemen were injured while attempting to stop the lynching.Daniel Dor, Intifada Hits the Headlines: How the Israeli Press Misreported the Outbreak of the Second Palestinian Uprising, Indiana University Press, 2004 pp.123‚Äì128. Jamal Tirawi, the Palestinian Intelligence chief at the Mukata'a nearby, only intervened hours after the second soldier lay dying. The Israeli reservists were beaten and stabbed. At this point, a Palestinian (later identified as Aziz Salha), appeared at the window, displaying his blood-soaked hands to the crowd, which erupted into cheers. The crowd clapped and cheered as one of the soldier's bodies was then thrown out the window and stamped and beaten by the frenzied crowd. One of the two was shot, set on fire, and his head beaten to a pulp. Soon after, the crowd dragged the two mutilated bodies to Al-Manara Square in the city center and began an impromptu victory celebration. Police officers proceeded to try and confiscate footage from reporters. Reactions and military response The brutality of the murders shocked the Israeli public, intensifying Israeli distrust of Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat. The event also deeply damaged the Israeli left-wing's faith in the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian peace process. Israeli author and peace campaigner Amos Oz said \\"Without any doubt, I blame the Palestinian leadership. They clearly did not want to sign an agreement at Camp David. Maybe Arafat prefers to be Che Guevara than Fidel Castro. If he becomes the president of Palestine, he'll be the leader of a rough, Third World country and have to deal with sewage in Hebron, drugs in Gaza, and the corruption in his own government.\\" In response, the Israeli military launched a series of strikes against Palestinian Authority targets in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Israeli forces sealed off several Palestinian cities and deployed troops, tanks, and armored vehicles. IDF helicopters fired rockets at two PA police stations in Ramallah (the police station where the lynching took place was destroyed); the Beit Lahia headquarters of Tanzim, the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades; and buildings near Arafat's headquarters in Gaza City. Israeli Navy gunboats were reportedly seen offshore. Six Palestinian Authority naval boats were destroyed. Later in the day, Israeli helicopters destroyed the Voice of Palestine radio station in Ramallah. According to Palestinian sources, a total of 27 people were injured in the attacks. Israeli authorities state that the PA was warned before the attacks, and that a warning shot was fired before every attack, in order to empty the buildings about to be attacked. Media coverage An Italian film crew, later learned to be employees of Mediaset, Italy's largest private television station, captured footage of the lynching. British photographer Mark Seager attempted to photograph the event but the mob physically assaulted him and destroyed his camera. After the event, he stated, \\"It [the lynching] was the most horrible thing that I have ever seen and I have reported from Congo, Kosovo, many bad places.... I know they [Palestinians] are not all like this and I'm a very forgiving person but I'll never forget this. It was murder of the most barbaric kind. When I think about it, I see that man's head, all smashed. I know that I'll have nightmares for the rest of my life.\\" An ABC News team also attempted to record the incident but the mob also prevented them from doing so. ABC News producer Nasser Atta said that when the crew began filming the lynching, \\"youths came to us and they stopped us with some knives, with some beating.\\" =RAI scandal= Following the lynching on October 16, 2000, Riccardo Cristiano, the deputy head of the Jerusalem bureau of Italy's state television channel RAI, published a letter (see text) in Al- Hayat al-Jadida, the official daily newspaper of the Palestinian Authority (PA). In the letter (entitled \\"Special Clarification by the Italian Representative of RAI, the Official Italian Television Station\\"), Cristiano denies that RAI had any involvement with the filming of the incident and that one of the station's Italian competitors was responsible for the footage. He wrote, \\"We [RAI] emphasize to all of you that the events did not happen this way, because we always respect (will continue to respect) the journalistic procedures with the Palestinian Authority for (journalistic) work in Palestine and we are credible in our precise work.\\" The Italian correspondent also praised the PA, declaring, \\"We congratulate you [the PA] and think that it is our duty to put you in the picture (of the events) of what happened on October 12 in Ramallah.... We thank you for your trust, and you can be sure that this is not our way of acting. We do not (will not) do such a thing.\\" As a result of the letter, the Israeli Government Press Office suspended Cristiano's press card. The Israeli Foreign Ministry stated, \\"His letter implies that he will never again film events which are liable to cast a negative light on the PA, such as the recent lynching of IDF reservists in Ramallah.... The State of Israel, as a democratic society, welcomes the foreign journalists working here and invests considerable effort in both assuring freedom of the press and assisting journalists in their work. All that we ask from foreign journalists is that they abide by the rules of press ethics as is accepted in democratic societies.\\" Cristiano's letter, which effectively identified Mediaset as being responsible for the footage, necessitated Mediaset to withdraw its staff out of fear of Palestinian revenge attacks. In response, Italian politician Silvio Berlusconi, whose family holding company controls Mediaset, said, \\"The letter is indicative of an anti-semitic attitude in elements of the Italian left.\\" The Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera declared it a shameful day for Italian journalism. For its part, RAI disowned the letter and recalled Cristiano, stating, \\"He will no longer work from Jerusalem. RAI had no knowledge of the letter and its content.\\" Regarding Cristiano's motives for the letter, RAI asserted that the journalist had recently been injured while covering other Palestinian riots and he wished to dispel rumors that RAI was responsible for the footage. =Claims of Palestinian censorship= In relation to media coverage of the event, the Israeli Foreign Ministry accused Palestinian broadcasting stations of making \\"every effort to hide the horrible pictures which were shown around the world.\\" The ministry further asserted that \\"according to reporters' evidence on the scene,\\" the Palestinian police attempted to prevent foreign journalists from entering the area in order to obstruct reporting of the incident. Arrests of lynching suspects After he assumed office, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon ordered the Israeli security services to find and arrest the lynchers. Israel subsequently tracked down those responsible: *Aziz Salha was arrested in 2001. He admitted to being one of those who broke into the police station and to choking one of the soldiers while others beat him bloody. When he saw that his hands were covered with the soldier's blood, he went to the window and proudly displayed his blood-stained hands to the mob below, and was photographed while doing so. In 2004, an Israeli court convicted him for the murder of Nurzhitz and sentenced him to life imprisonment. In October 2011 he was controversially released as part of the Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange. *Muhammad Howara, a Tanzim militant, was arrested in 2001. He admitted breaking into the police station and stabbing one of the soldiers. *Ziad Hamdada, a Fatah Tanzim operative who set fire to the body of one of the Israeli reservists, was arrested in 2002. He had also participated in and planned other attacks on Israeli forces. *Mohamed Abu Ida, a former member of the Palestinian police force in Ramallah, was arrested by Shin Bet in 2005. During the investigation, he admitted to having had led the two Israeli soldiers to the Ramallah police station after which he joined the other rioters. *Wisam Radi, a Palestinian policeman, was arrested by Israeli security forces and indicted before a military court in 2005 for killing Yosef Avrahami and abusing the body of Vadim Nurzhitz. In 2010, he was acquitted of Avrahami's murder on grounds that a critical piece of evidence was inadmissible in court. He was, however, convicted of mutilating Nurzhitz's body and sentenced to seven years in prison. An appellate court later overturned the decision not to convict him of murder following an appeal by the military prosecution. *Haiman Zabam, a Tanzim operative, was arrested by Israeli paratroopers on September 26, 2007. He had been planning additional attacks on Israel. *Marwan Ibrahim Tawfik Maadi and Yasser Ibrahim Mohammed Khatab, two Hamas members, were arrested by Shin Bet and Israeli Police during the breakup of a Hamas network in Ramallah and the Binyamin region. During the interrogation, they confessed to participating in the lynching, and in August 2012, they were indicted before a military court. \\"IDF court convicts Palestinian of lynching Israeli soldier in 2000\\" - Haaretz - 10 August 2012 See also * Palestinian political violence Notes References Ramallah lynching Ramallah lynching Lynching deaths Lynch Ramallah Lynching Filmed killings October 2000 events in Asia ","title":"2000 Ramallah lynching"},{"id":"2985760","text":"5T was a Vietnamese crime gang active in the Cabramatta and Bankstown area of Sydney, Australia, with sub-groups and ex-members living interstate, in the final two decades of the 20th century. Their main local rivals were the 1N and 7A gangs and the three constantly fought each other for territory. The rise of 5T The 5T gang was started by Cabramatta youths who came to Australia with their parents after the fall of the Republic of Vietnam. The formation of the 5Ts began in the mid-1980s. The term 5T, stands for five Vietnamese words starting with T; 'T√¨nh', 'Ti·ªÅn', 'T√π', 'T·ªôi' and 'T·ª±', translating to 'Love, Money, Prison, Punishment, Death'. However, 5T also means 'tu·ªïi tr·∫ª thi·∫øu t√¨nh th∆∞∆°ng' which roughly translates to 'childhood without love.' Gang members apparently were tattooed with the emblem consisting of a straight horizontal line and 5 joined vertical lines with members' first and family names starting with the letter T being the horizontal line on top of the name. Tri Minh Tran rose to leadership of the 5T gang by the age of 14 in 1989. Born in Vietnam in 1975, Tran arrived in Australia at the age of 7 as a refugee. By the age of 11, he had spent six months in a children's institution for carrying a sawn- off shotgun and in the next couple of years was suspected of the murder of two rival gang members.  5T & Heroin Trade  The 5T gang dominated over the Cabramatta heroin trade, predominately at a street level. In January 1988, the Sydney Morning Herald warned: \\"Criminal gangs in the Vietnamese community are increasingly heavily armed, are moving into drugs and gambling, establishing links with Australian crime figures, and becoming involved in standover rackets in their own community\\". John Newman first warned of the Vietnamese gangs including the 5T in 1989 in NSW State Parliament saying: \\"The Asian gangs involved don't fear our laws. But there's one thing they do fear and that's possible deportation back to the jungles of Vietnam, because that's where, frankly, they belong.\\" Newman campaigned strongly against the crime gangs in Vietnam and would receive regular death threats before his murder. Disbandment The murder of Tran in 1995 sparked a power struggle within the organization. This was ultimately furthered with the death of the 5T successor. This led to an escalation of violence in 1999, as rival mobs, the 'Four Aces' and 'Madonna's boys', which were break-away groups of the 5T, challenged the 5T leading to an increase in the murder rate in Cabramatta. This gang warfare eventually led to the NSW Parliament establishing a Parliamentary Inquiry. During this inquiry in 2001, Tim Priest, a police officer based at Cabramatta warned of an upsurge of gang violence in Southwestern Sydney including Vietnamese, Chinese and Middle Eastern gangs. He was criticised for his comments by then NSW Education Minister John Aquilina and Reba Meagher, Newman's successor as Member for Cabramatta, who labelled him a \\"disgruntled detective\\" before being forced to apologise. The successors of the 5T included the Four Aces, Red Dragon and Madonna's Boys (Madonna) [Ro Van Le]. The leader and namesake of the gang, however, was subsequently murdered outside a Western Sydney pub in 1999 shortly after being released from prison, subsequently leading to the eventual demise of the 5T Gang.

The Green has numerous tributaries, but much of its water flows from a confluence with Big Hungry Creek. The Green River is itself a tributary of the Broad River. The river is dammed to form Lake Summit, in Tuxedo, North Carolina, and Lake Adger near Mill Spring, NC. The Green River is named for its deep green color but runs brown after heavy rains. Landscape The Green River begins in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina and flows through the Blue Ridge Escarpment into the Piedmont. The river basin itself is not mainly sediment, but rather consists of metamorphic rock. The humid subtropical climate provides for moderate temperatures and relatively mild winters. The precipitation for the areas around the Green River typically ranges from 100 to 140 centimeters annually. Ecology The area surrounding the river is all deciduous forest and is known for having some of the \\"highest floral and faunal biodiversity in the eastern United States.\\" The Green River basin is typical of most southeastern mountain creeks as it is home to many animals, including deer and black bears. A few prominent deciduous trees in and around the Green River Basin are the Maple, Birch, and Oak Trees. The Green river serves as both a source of fresh water to a specific ecosystem, as well as a source of food to many consumers.  Angling  The population of freshwater trout draws many anglers to the slower-moving lower Green. The world record V-lip redhorse was taken from the Green River in 2018. The world record notchlip redhorse was also taken from the Green in 2018, but by a different angler. Whitewater Sports The Green River is well known for its different types of whitewater sports including whitewater kayaking, canoeing, and tubing. Because the flow of water is controlled by dam-release, the river has sufficient water to support whitewater sports approximately 300 days a year. This makes the Green River available for whitewater enthusiasts to use even when other popular rivers such as the Chattooga River and the Nantahala River do not have enough water flow to support whitewater kayaking or canoeing. The three main sections of the Green River are: The upper Green, The \\"Narrows\\" section, and the lower Green. While all of these stretches of water are very closely connected they each have unique terrain and characteristics, and each section tends to draw different types of boating. =Upper Green= This section of the Green River is frequently run by kayakers, as well as persons paddling whitewater canoes, and other types of solo boaters. It is approximately 3.7 miles in length and has an average gradient of 49 feet per mile. This top section of the Green River begins below the Tuxedo Hydro Station, which controls the water flow, and ends at the beginning of the \\"Narrows\\" section. Because it is directly above the \\"Narrows\\" section, the Upper Green is often used by whitewater paddlers to access the Narrows. With only two significant rapids (Class III), it is considered a moderately difficult section by most whitewater paddlers. This section of the Green is narrow and resembles what would be considered a creek, rather than an actual river. The hydrology and nature of the water on this particular section of water makes it a popular spot for playboating, a style of whitewater kayaking. =The Narrows= The \\"Narrows\\" section of the Green river has many qualities of a steep creek that drops between pools, and doesn't resemble many broad, slow-moving rivers in the southeast. John Pilson describes the Narrows as \\"boulder congested\\" with a \\"pool-drop character.\\" This length of the river is considered an extremely difficult portion of whitewater, as it contains nine class IV rapids, and eight class V rapids (these being the most difficult runnable rapids). The first official descent of the Narrows was made in 1988, and it is still frequently paddled today. However, the Narrows are typically only paddled by seasoned whitewater boaters with an extensive knowledge of boating technique. Many whitewater enthusiasts have been injured here, and three qualified Class V boaters have died on the Green River. Three of the biggest and most notorious class V rapids on this section are known as the \\"Big Three.\\" These are \\"Go Left and Die\\" (Class 5.1), \\"Gorilla\\" (Class 5.2), and \\"Sunshine\\" (Class 5.2). An incident on \\"Sunshine\\" rapid left one whitewater kayaker paralyzed. This technical section of water is home to the Green River Race that is held every year on the first Saturday of November. The race typically involves many different classes of boats, and contains a section judged by time trial, as well as a head-to-head section of the race. Many paddlers consider the Green River Narrows race to be the pinnacle of whitewater racing in the southeast. Part of the reason that the Narrows are so notable is because they have a downward gradient of over 100 feet per mile. The entire section of river is about 3 miles in length. =Lower Green= This run is frequented by both kayakers and tubers. Many local companies promote tubing as a type of \\"safe\\" whitewater tourism on the Green. The entire run is considered a class II section of water, appropriate for introductory level whitewater enthusiasts. This section of the Green River is very mild compared to its counterparts and is approximately six miles in length.

Plot summary It is September 1942, four months after the Transition. A cease-fire has been signed between Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin, and the dictators have re-established their June 1941 borders. Both nations are 'cooperating' in various areas of research (particularly rocketry) at the newly built Demidenko research facility in Ukraine. Thanks to the foreknowledge granted by the Transition, Hitler and Stalin have purged their military and party ranks of traitors (real and imagined) that have been revealed from our history but not without problems: the arrest of Field Marshal Rommel sparks off a mutiny of the Afrika Korps that throws the entire North African front into chaos. Most of the German war machine shifts to \\"Operation Sea Dragon\\": the invasion of Britain. Meanwhile, in the Pacific, the Japanese have conquered New Guinea and the nearby island chains, and are battling Allied forces (reinforced with troops from the Multinational Force) along the Brisbane Line in Australia. In the United States a \\"Special Administrative Zone\\" has been carved out within the San Fernando Valley of California. Within \\"the Zone\\", the laws of the United States as of January 15, 2021 apply and it becomes an enclave for the 21st Century personnel. Many of the Multinational Force's members work in various technological areas and thousands of contemporary females and non-whites are clamoring to join their ranks. Over the next month, the Japanese position in northern Australia unravels after a massive blitzkrieg of 21st Century armor is unleashed. Japanese soldiers massacre entire towns, prompting both outrage and a reluctance to divert 21st forces anywhere else. Under interrogation, General Homma reveals that Australia was nothing more than a diversion to make the Multinational Forces expend as much of their limited weaponry as possible. Japanese survivors are executed under Multinational Force Sanction Four. The French stealth ship Dessaix, presumed lost, was found by the Germans off the Canary Islands a few weeks after the initial Transition, and it now spearheads the assault on Yamamoto's real target: Hawaii. The ship's cruise missiles lay waste to the islands' defenses (and one nearly obliterates the city of Honolulu) although a French crew member manages to sabotage several of them before being killed. With the American defense crippled, the Japanese easily take Oahu and send a message to Washington DC, stating that any attempt to retake the islands will result in the wholesale slaughter of the population. In Britain, preparations are underway for a commando raid on Norway against the heavy water plant there (a la Heroes of Telemark). However, information from Wehrmacht Colonel Paul Brasch (whose physically disabled son is eligible for 'disposal' under the T4 program) reveals that Germany's true nuclear effort lies elsewhere, and the mission is placed on hold. Operation Sea Dragon commences the next day with an attempt to invade across the English Channel. Hundreds of aircraft and warships, upgraded with new technology, duel in the waters and skies south of England; the 21st century ship HMS Trident, more valuable as a command and control center than as a weapon, ensures th-t key German formations identified by Brasch are destroyed. Three missiles taken off the Dessaix are launched at British targets, but suspected sabotage causes two to crash harmlessly into the North Sea. The third does hit Biggin Hill airfield, but its primary warhead does not detonate. Despite heavy losses sustained by the RAF and the damage to Biggin Hill, the Germans lose most of their navy. Any airborne units that reach England are quickly isolated and crushed by the Allies. In the United States, a series of German-instigated bombings and race riots takes place, targeting civilians for maximum effect. Wahabi and Baathist insurgents foment revolt across the Middle East and the Soviet Union, with enough time to train and equip its armies, has begun seizing the Afghan passes leading to India. Unbeknownst to either the Allies or Axis, the HMS Vanguard materialized on the Siberian ice pack, one day before the other ships, and is now providing the Soviets with invaluable resources and information. Stalin has also impounded the ships of Convoy PQ 17 and has his own atomic bomb program in place; it may take a decade of fighting, but Stalin sees nothing but global triumph for communism. As the German forces retreat from the Channel, a group of SS commandos led by Otto Skorzeny attempts to assassinate Prime Minister Churchill (as in The Eagle Has Landed). They are thwarted by SAS Major Windsor, but Skorzeny escapes in the melee. Drone coverage over Oahu reveals that the Japanese are slaughtering military prisoners in droves. With the supercarrier Hillary Clinton all but useless in a fight, the 21st-century Japanese cruiser Siranui (crewed by survivors of the Leyte Gulf) prepares to lead the Allied forces in what will be a very bloody retaking of the Hawaiian Islands.

His father was a journalist who had written on prophecies, and professed a philosophic-occult Catholicism. He established the Salon de la Rose + Croix for painters, writers, and musicians sharing his artistic ideals, the Symbolists in particular. Biography P√©ladan was born into a Lyon family that was devoutly Roman Catholic. He studied at Jesuit colleges at Avignon and N√Æmes. After he failed his baccalaureat, P√©ladan moved to Paris and became a literary and art critic. His older brother Adrien studied alchemy and occultism as well. Career In 1882Lucie-Smith, Edward. (1972) Symbolist Art. London: Thames & Hudson, p. 109. he came to Paris where Arsene Houssaye gave him a job on his artistic review, L'Artiste. In 1884 he published his first novel, Le vice supr√™me, which recommended the salvation of man through occult magic of the ancient East.Rudorff, Raymond, The Belle Epoque - Paris in the Nineties, Saturday Review Press, New York, 1972. (pp. 185-195). His novel was an instant success with the French public, which was experiencing a revived interest in spirituality and mysticism. The novel went through several printings. He claimed that a Babylonian king left the title of \\"S√¢r\\" to his family. P√©ladan's Le vice supr√™me was interwoven with Rosicrucian and occult themes. After reading P√©ladan's novel, the French poet Stanislas de Guaita became interested in occultism. In Paris, De Guaita and P√©ladan became acquainted, and in 1884, the two decided to try to rebuild the medieval secret society, the Rosicrucian Brotherhood. P√©ladan was influenced by the teachings of Eliphas L√©vi. De Guaita and P√©ladan recruited G√©rard Encausse to help rebuild the brotherhood. Encausse, who went by the pseudonym \\"Papus\\", was a Spanish-born French physician and occultist who had written books on magic, Kabbalah and the Tarot. In 1888, De Guaita founded the Cabalistic Order of the Rosicrucian. The Rosicrucian Order is a legendary and secretive Order that was first publicly documented in the early 17th century. Guaita's Rosicrucian Order provided training in the Kabbalah, an esoteric form of Jewish mysticism, which attempts to reveal hidden mystical insights in the Hebrew Bible and divine nature. The order also conducted examinations and provided university degrees on Kabbalah topics. De Guaita had a large private library of books on metaphysical issues, magic, and the \\"hidden sciences.\\" He was nicknamed the \\"Prince of the Rosicrucians\\" by his contemporaries for his broad learning on Rosicrucian issues. By the 1890s, De Guaita, Papus and P√©ladan's collaboration became increasingly strained by disagreements over strategy and doctrines. De Guaita and Papus lost the support of P√©ladan, who left to start a competing order. In June 1890, P√©ladan left the Martinist Order and created a quasi- Catholic Ordre du Temple de la Rose + Croix. P√©ladan was the leader of the new order, and he took the titles of \\"Imperator\\" and \\"Super Magician\\". Ordre du Temple de la Rose + Croix and the Salon de la Rose + Croix The Ordre du Temple de la Rose + Croix inspired P√©ladan to organise an outlet for his beliefs concerning the role of spirituality and idealism in art. As an art critic, P√©ladan had been vocal in critiquing the dominant trends in French art, which included officially sanctioned styles promoted by the academy, and the Impressionists. This resulted in a series of six exhibits of Symbolist artists and associated French avant-garde painters, writers, and musicians, as the Salon de la Rose + Croix. The Salon was enormously popular with the press and public, but failed to succeed in revolutionising French art, as P√©ladan had hoped.

In the theory of measures a signed measure is sometimes called a charge.Bhaskara Rao 1983 Definition There are two slightly different concepts of a signed measure, depending on whether or not one allows it to take infinite values. Signed measures are usually only allowed to take finite real values, while some textbooks allow them to take infinite values. To avoid confusion, this article will call these two cases \\"finite signed measures\\" and \\"extended signed measures\\". Given a measurable space (X, Œ£) (that is, a set X with a sigma algebra Œ£ on it), an extended signed measure is a function :\\\\mu: \\\\Sigma \\\\to \\\\mathbb {R}\\\\cup\\\\\\\\{\\\\infty,-\\\\infty\\\\\\\\} such that \\\\mu(\\\\emptyset) = 0 and \\\\mu is œÉ-additive ‚Äì that is, it satisfies the equality :\\\\mu\\\\left(\\\\bigcup_{n=1}^\\\\infty A_n\\\\right) = \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\mu(A_n). The series on the right must converge absolutely, for any sequence A1, A2, ..., An, ... of disjoint sets in Œ£, when the value of the left-hand side is finite. One consequence is that any extended signed measure can take +‚àû as a value, or it can take ‚àí‚àû as a value, but both are not available. The expression ‚àû ‚àí ‚àû is undefinedSee the article \\"Extended real number line\\" for more information. and must be avoided. A finite signed measure (a.k.a. real measure) is defined in the same way, except that it is only allowed to take real values. That is, it cannot take +‚àû or ‚àí‚àû. Finite signed measures form a real vector space, while extended signed measures do not because they are not closed under addition. On the other hand, measures are extended signed measures, but are not in general finite signed measures. Examples Consider a non-negative measure u on the space (X, Œ£) and a measurable function f: X ‚Üí R such that :\\\\int_X \\\\\\\\! f(x) \\\\, d u (x) < \\\\infty. Then, a finite signed measure is given by :\\\\mu (A) = \\\\int_A \\\\\\\\! f(x) \\\\, d u (x) for all A in Œ£. This signed measure takes only finite values. To allow it to take +‚àû as a value, one needs to replace the assumption about f being absolutely integrable with the more relaxed condition :\\\\int_X \\\\\\\\! f^-(x) \\\\, d u (x) < \\\\infty, where f‚àí(x) = max(‚àíf(x), 0) is the negative part of f. Properties What follows are two results which will imply that an extended signed measure is the difference of two non-negative measures, and a finite signed measure is the difference of two finite non-negative measures. The Hahn decomposition theorem states that given a signed measure Œº, there exist two measurable sets P and N such that: #P‚à™N = X and P‚à©N = ‚àÖ; #Œº(E) ‚â• 0 for each E in Œ£ such that E ‚äÜ P -- in other words, P is a positive set; #Œº(E) ‚â§ 0 for each E in Œ£ such that E ‚äÜ N -- that is, N is a negative set. Moreover, this decomposition is unique up to adding to/subtracting Œº-null sets from P and N. Consider then two non-negative measures Œº+ and Œº‚àí defined by : \\\\mu^+(E) = \\\\mu(P\\\\cap E) and : \\\\mu^-(E)=-\\\\mu(N\\\\cap E) for all measurable sets E, that is, E in Œ£. One can check that both Œº+ and Œº‚àí are non-negative measures, with one taking only finite values, and are called the positive part and negative part of Œº, respectively. One has that Œº = Œº+ ‚àí Œº‚àí. The measure Œº = Œº+ \\\\+ Œº‚àí is called the variation of Œº, and its maximum possible value, Œº = Œº(X), is called the total variation of Œº. This consequence of the Hahn decomposition theorem is called the Jordan decomposition. The measures Œº+, Œº‚àí and Œº are independent of the choice of P and N in the Hahn decomposition theorem. Usage A measure is given by the area function on regions of the Cartesian plane. This measure becomes a charge in certain instances. For example, when the natural logarithm is defined by the area under the curve y = 1/x for x in the positive real numbers, the region with 0 < x< 1 is considered negative. The logarithm defined as an integral from University of California, Davis A region defined by a continuous function y = f(x), the x-axis, and lines x = a and x = b can be evaluated by Riemann integration. In this case the evaluation is a charge with the sign of the charge corresponding to the sign of y. When defining directed hyperbolic angles in terms of area of a hyperbolic sector, the line y = x divides quadrant I into positive and negative regions for a signed measure. The space of signed measures The sum of two finite signed measures is a finite signed measure, as is the product of a finite signed measure by a real number ‚Äì that is, they are closed under linear combinations. It follows that the set of finite signed measures on a measurable space (X, Œ£) is a real vector space; this is in contrast to positive measures, which are only closed under conical combinations, and thus form a convex cone but not a vector space. Furthermore, the total variation defines a norm in respect to which the space of finite signed measures becomes a Banach space. This space has even more structure, in that it can be shown to be a Dedekind complete Banach lattice and in so doing the Radon‚ÄìNikodym theorem can be shown to be a special case of the Freudenthal spectral theorem. If X is a compact separable space, then the space of finite signed Baire measures is the dual of the real Banach space of all continuous real-valued functions on X, by the Riesz‚ÄìMarkov‚ÄìKakutani representation theorem.

Their second- generation holographic weapon sight was released in 2000 and won the same award in 2001.https://www.eotechinc.com/company They developed achromatic holographic optics that compensate for any change in the emission wavelength of the laser diode with temperature.\\"HOLOgraphic Weapon Sight Product Introduction \\" NDIA/EOTech presentation, June 2004.\\"Compact Holographic Sight\\", Patent #5,483,362 issued January 9, 1996.\\" Light Weight Holographic Sight\\", Patent #6,490,060 issued December 3, 2002 The sights are designed to be mounted on small arms via a MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny or Weaver rail, and powered by either AA, N or CR123 size batteries for up to 1,100 hours of runtime. Sights display either a 65 MoA ring with a 1 MoA dot in the center, a single 1 MoA dot, a vertical series of dots for bullet drop compensation in certain calibers, or, in the case of their less-lethal sights, a flared vase- like sight to assist in the aiming of bean-bag or rubber ball rounds commonly used in riot control. Bushnell marketed the non-military versions under the brand name \\"Holosight\\". The EOTECH 553 is in U.S. military service under the designation SU-231/PEQ and M553 in the commercial market. More recently, the U.S. Military is also purchasing and issuing the newer EOTECH EXPS3 model, designated the SU-231A/PEQ. A specialty sight for the grenade launcher has also been accepted by the U.S. military with the designation SU-253/PEQ. Their first holographic sight was introduced in January 1996. An archery sight was discontinued in November 2004, in line with the company's desire to concentrate on military and law-enforcement products. In 2015, the U.S. Government sued EOTECH for civil fraud, accusing it of covering up defects in the sights that it knew about as early as 2006. The first defect was \\"thermal drift\\", which causes the aiming point to shift in high or low temperatures by as much as 12\\" at 300 yards. The second was \\"moisture incursion\\" or \\"reticle fade\\", which causes the viewing glass to fog up and the aiming point to lose brightness.http://www.military.com/daily-news/2016/01/21/eotech-breaks- silence-over-defective-sights.html EOTECH settled for $25.6 million, and fixed the \\"moisture incursion\\" defect. However, as of April 2016 it reported that it could not cure the thermal drift defect. Thousands of EOTECH sights are used by federal law enforcement and military, including special operations forces.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/04/03/u-s- special-operations-units-are-using-faulty-rifle-sights/ In 2018, EOTECH was awarded a $26.3 million five-year contract from the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) to provide close-quarters sights and clip-on magnifiers for the Miniature Aiming System‚ÄìDay Optics suite. In 2020, EOTECH officially separated from L3Harris Technologies and purchased by American Holoptics, a subsidiary of Koucar Management.  Technology  Unlike reflector sights, the holographic weapon sight does not use a reflected reticle system. Instead a representative reticle is recorded in three-dimensional space onto holographic film that is part of the optical viewing window. Like the reflector sight, the holographic sight's reticle uses collimated light and therefore has an aim- point that can move with eye position. This is compensated for by having a holographic image that is set at a finite distance, in this case around 100 yards. The sight's parallax due to eye movement is the size of the optical window at close range and diminishes to zero at the set distance.ar15.com \\" Parrallax on an Eotech?\\" - Tech support question - Parallax issues with 550 series- \\"The sights do have parallax error of +/- 1.2 \\" or +/- 0.6\\" (1.2 \\" side to side). The sight is designed to be parallax free at long distance 100yds to infinity. At close range, there will be a parallax error equaling to the width of the window which is 33mm or 1.3\\". A perfectly aligned sight will have parallax error of 1.3\\" at 10 yds and at 17 ft. As you move further away from 10 to 40 yards parallax becomes less and is almost zero at 50 yards.\\" To compensate for any change in the laser wavelength, the EOTECH sight employs a holography grating that disperses the laser light by an equal amount but in the opposite direction as the hologram forming the aiming reticle. The result is a reticle that is stable with the change in temperature. One requirement of holographic projection is a laser. Lasers use more power and more complex driving electronics than an LED of an equivalent brightness, reducing the amount of time a holographic sight can run on a single set of batteries.

Life Makuszy≈Ñski was born in Stryj in the Austrian Partition of Poland (now in Ukraine) to Edward and Julia n√©e Ogonowska. He attended the Jan D≈Çugosz gymnasium in Lviv (Polish: Lw√≥w). While in school he wrote occasional poetry (he started writing at the age of 14). Makuszy≈Ñski had his first poem published in 1902 in the newspaper S≈Çowo Polskie (Polish Word), for which he soon became a theatrical critic. He studied language and literature at both the University of Lviv (then Jan Kazimierz University in Lw√≥w, Poland) and in Paris. He was evacuated to Kiev in 1915, where he ran the Polish Theatre and was the chairman of the Polish writers and journalist community. He moved to Warsaw in 1918, and became a writer.

It encompasses two neighborhoods: in its south and west the old Buckeye neighborhood and in its northeast the Shaker Square neighborhood which is centered on an historic shopping district and an eponymous rapid transit station, located at the intersection of Shaker and Moreland Boulevards, on the light rail line that connects the city of Shaker Heights to downtown Cleveland. From the early to mid-20th century, the Buckeye Road neighborhood was known as Little Hungary, serving as the historic heart of Cleveland's Hungarian community, which at one time was the largest in the world outside of Hungary and for years has been almost completely African-American. Shaker Square, continues to be known as one of Cleveland's most notable neighborhoods, in terms of shopping, dining, architecture, education of its residents, participation in civic life, diversity and quality of living. Buckeye‚ÄìShaker is bordered by the neighborhoods of Woodland Hills on its west, Mount Pleasant to the south, University Circle to the north, and the suburb of Shaker Heights to the east. Shaker Square The historic American Colonial-Georgian shopping center, which was largely influenced by European town squares, was built between 1927 and 1929 by the Van Sweringen brothers. Several pieces were added to the four quadrants - likely in the 1950s. Nearby, along Van Aken Boulevard but essentially an appendage to the Square, a commercial strip was built in 1939. The two brothers, who also developed much of the land to the east the neighborhood as the planned community of Shaker Heights, envisioned Shaker Square as its gateway between the urban and suburban living spaces represented in the early 20th century. On either side of the train tracks are two lawn areas. A short distance east of the Shaker Square stop, the track splits into the Green Line (that heads east to Green Road), and the Blue Line (that runs southeast on Van Aken Boulevard, until it reaches Chagrin Boulevard). Four large buildings around the perimeter of the grass lawns make up the second planned shopping center in the United States, after Country Club Plaza in Kansas City. They were designed in a Neo-Georgian style by Phillip Small and Charles Bacon Rowley, and together form an octagonal area that is said to have been inspired by the eight-sided plaza at the center of the Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen, Denmark. Since 2004, the Square has been owned by The Coral Company whose offices are in Shaker Square. Today, Shaker Square is the heart of the neighborhood. Near the square are more than 4,000 units of rental and condominium apartments (the largest concentration of multi-family housing in Cleveland), townhouses, and many private homes. =Larchmere= The Larchmere district begins at North Moreland Boulevard, stretching west along Larchmere Boulevard to East 121st Street. The commercial and residential district is known for its dozens of storefronts and annual festivals-including its PorchFest, Holiday Stroll, and Larchmere Festival. Buckeye Road The Buckeye Road neighborhood was known as Little Hungary and developed as the heart of Cleveland's Hungarian community in the late 19th century. By the 1920 United States Census, over 42,000 residents in Cleveland listed themselves as having been born in the Kingdom of Hungary, with a large portion of these residing in the Buckeye Road neighborhood. Like many immigrant groups, the Hungarians came to the United States looking for a better life, and those who settled in Cleveland came at a time when the city was one of the nations leading industrial cities. Working primarily in the heavy manufacturing sector, these immigrants settled their tightly-knit community due to its close proximity to the steel mills and day-labor jobs where they worked. Between the end of World War II and 1970 the neighborhood represented one of the most powerful political blocs in Cleveland's Democratic Party. By the end of the 1970s many of the original inhabitants of Buckeye Road had migrated to the suburbs as they ascended the economic ladder, and in large part due to the white flight which had produced similar migrations out of the inner city in many US metropolitan areas. by the beginning of the 21st century only a handful of the Hungarian residents remained in a neighborhood that today is predominately African-American. Benedictine High School, a Catholic high school and perennial football-powerhouse that boasts Chuck Noll as an alumnus, is located just south of Buckeye on Martin Luther King Drive. Points of interest, all of which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places include the closed St. Luke's Hospital, built in 1927, which is slated for re- development; St. Elizabeth of Hungary Catholic Church, built in 1892; and the Weizer Building, built in 1928. Education In September 1912 the Cleveland Board of Education ceded an area at the eastern end of Buckeye - Shaker, around what would later become Shaker Square, to the Shaker Heights Board of Education. Currently Moreland Boulevard serves as the dividing line with homes and businesses along Moreland and to the east being within the Shaker Schools and Library district and thus paying taxes real estate taxes and participating in elections for the Shaker Heights City School District and Shaker libraries. Households and businesses west of Moreland continue to be part of the Cleveland Metropolitan School District and Cleveland libraries. Because of the ability to send their children to Shaker Schools, there has historically been a large number of individuals who work in the Cleveland, particularly in city government, who live in the Shaker Schools area or Buckeye‚ÄìShaker. This anomaly also led to this area being a center of Cleveland's black middle class prior to the integration of the city of Shaker Heights.

Moreover, this decomposition is essentially unique, meaning that for any other pair (P',N') of \\\\Sigma -measurable subsets of X fulfilling the three conditions above, the symmetric differences P \\\\triangle P' and N \\\\triangle N' are \\\\mu -null sets in the strong sense that every \\\\Sigma -measurable subset of them has zero measure. The pair (P,N) is then called a Hahn decomposition of the signed measure \\\\mu .  Jordan measure decomposition  A consequence of the Hahn decomposition theorem is the Jordan decomposition theorem, which states that every signed measure \\\\mu defined on \\\\Sigma has a unique decomposition into a difference \\\\mu = \\\\mu^{+} - \\\\mu^{-} of two positive measures, \\\\mu^{+} and \\\\mu^{-} , at least one of which is finite, such that {\\\\mu^{+}}(E) = 0 for every \\\\Sigma -measurable subset E \\\\subseteq N and {\\\\mu^{-}}(E) = 0 for every \\\\Sigma -measurable subset E \\\\subseteq P , for any Hahn decomposition (P,N) of \\\\mu . We call \\\\mu^{+} and \\\\mu^{-} the positive and negative part of \\\\mu , respectively. The pair (\\\\mu^{+},\\\\mu^{-}) is called a Jordan decomposition (or sometimes Hahn‚ÄìJordan decomposition) of \\\\mu . The two measures can be defined as : {\\\\mu^{+}}(E) := \\\\mu(E \\\\cap P) \\\\qquad \\\\text{and} \\\\qquad {\\\\mu^{-}}(E) := - \\\\mu(E \\\\cap N) for every E \\\\in \\\\Sigma and any Hahn decomposition (P,N) of \\\\mu . Note that the Jordan decomposition is unique, while the Hahn decomposition is only essentially unique. The Jordan decomposition has the following corollary: Given a Jordan decomposition (\\\\mu^{+},\\\\mu^{-}) of a finite signed measure \\\\mu , one has : {\\\\mu^{+}}(E) = \\\\sup_{B \\\\in \\\\Sigma, ~ B \\\\subseteq E} \\\\mu(B) \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad {\\\\mu^{-}}(E) = - \\\\inf_{B \\\\in \\\\Sigma, ~ B \\\\subseteq E} \\\\mu(B) for any E in \\\\Sigma . Furthermore, if \\\\mu = u^{+} - u^{-} for a pair ( u^{+}, u^{-}) of finite non-negative measures on X , then : u^{+} \\\\geq \\\\mu^{+} \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad u^{-} \\\\geq \\\\mu^{-}. The last expression means that the Jordan decomposition is the minimal decomposition of \\\\mu into a difference of non-negative measures. This is the minimality property of the Jordan decomposition. Proof of the Jordan decomposition: For an elementary proof of the existence, uniqueness, and minimality of the Jordan measure decomposition see Fischer (2012).  Proof of the Hahn decomposition theorem  Preparation: Assume that \\\\mu does not take the value \\\\- \\\\infty (otherwise decompose according to \\\\- \\\\mu ). As mentioned above, a negative set is a set A \\\\in \\\\Sigma such that \\\\mu(B) \\\\leq 0 for every \\\\Sigma -measurable subset B \\\\subseteq A . Claim: Suppose that D \\\\in \\\\Sigma satisfies \\\\mu(D) \\\\leq 0 . Then there is a negative set A \\\\subseteq D such that \\\\mu(A) \\\\leq \\\\mu(D) . Proof of the claim: Define A_{0} := D . Inductively assume for n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}_{0} that A_{n} \\\\subseteq D has been constructed. Let : t_{n} := \\\\sup(\\\\\\\\{ \\\\mu(B) \\\\mid B \\\\in \\\\Sigma ~ \\\\text{and} ~ B \\\\subseteq A_{n} \\\\\\\\}) denote the supremum of \\\\mu(B) over all the \\\\Sigma -measurable subsets B of A_{n} . This supremum might a priori be infinite. As the empty set \\\\varnothing is a possible candidate for B in the definition of t_{n} , and as \\\\mu(\\\\varnothing) = 0 , we have t_{n} \\\\geq 0 . By the definition of t_{n} , there then exists a \\\\Sigma -measurable subset B_{n} \\\\subseteq A_{n} satisfying : \\\\mu(B_{n}) \\\\geq \\\\min \\\\\\\\! \\\\left( 1,\\\\frac{t_{n}}{2} \\\\right). Set A_{n + 1} := A_{n} \\\\setminus B_{n} to finish the induction step. Finally, define : A := D \\\\Bigg\\\\backslash \\\\bigcup_{n = 0}^{\\\\infty} B_{n}. As the sets (B_{n})_{n = 0}^{\\\\infty} are disjoint subsets of D , it follows from the sigma additivity of the signed measure \\\\mu that : \\\\mu(A) = \\\\mu(D) - \\\\sum_{n = 0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\mu(B_{n}) \\\\leq \\\\mu(D) - \\\\sum_{n = 0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\min \\\\\\\\! \\\\left( 1,\\\\frac{t_{n}}{2} \\\\right). This shows that \\\\mu(A) \\\\leq \\\\mu(D) . Assume A were not a negative set. This means that there would exist a \\\\Sigma -measurable subset B \\\\subseteq A that satisfies \\\\mu(B) > 0 . Then t_{n} \\\\geq \\\\mu(B) for every n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}_{0} , so the series on the right would have to diverge to \\\\+ \\\\infty , implying that \\\\mu(A) = - \\\\infty , which is not allowed. Therefore, A must be a negative set. Construction of the decomposition: Set N_{0} = \\\\varnothing . Inductively, given N_{n} , define : s_{n} := \\\\inf(\\\\\\\\{ \\\\mu(D) \\\\mid D \\\\in \\\\Sigma ~ \\\\text{and} ~ D \\\\subseteq X \\\\setminus N_{n} \\\\\\\\}). as the infimum of \\\\mu(D) over all the \\\\Sigma -measurable subsets D of X \\\\setminus N_{n} . This infimum might a priori be \\\\- \\\\infty . As \\\\varnothing is a possible candidate for D in the definition of s_{n} , and as \\\\mu(\\\\varnothing) = 0 , we have s_{n} \\\\leq 0 . Hence, there exists a \\\\Sigma -measurable subset D_{n} \\\\subseteq X \\\\setminus N_{n} such that : \\\\mu(D_{n}) \\\\leq \\\\max \\\\\\\\! \\\\left( \\\\frac{s_{n}}{2},- 1 \\\\right) \\\\leq 0. By the claim above, there is a negative set A_{n} \\\\subseteq D_{n} such that \\\\mu(A_{n}) \\\\leq \\\\mu(D_{n}) . Set N_{n + 1} := N_{n} \\\\cup A_{n} to finish the induction step. Finally, define : N := \\\\bigcup_{n = 0}^{\\\\infty} A_{n}. As the sets (A_{n})_{n = 0}^{\\\\infty} are disjoint, we have for every \\\\Sigma -measurable subset B \\\\subseteq N that : \\\\mu(B) = \\\\sum_{n = 0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\mu(B \\\\cap A_{n}) by the sigma additivity of \\\\mu . In particular, this shows that N is a negative set. Next, define P := X \\\\setminus N . If P were not a positive set, there would exist a \\\\Sigma -measurable subset D \\\\subseteq P with \\\\mu(D) < 0 . Then s_{n} \\\\leq \\\\mu(D) for all n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}_{0} and : \\\\mu(N) = \\\\sum_{n = 0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\mu(A_{n}) \\\\leq \\\\sum_{n = 0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\max \\\\\\\\! \\\\left( \\\\frac{s_{n}}{2},- 1 \\\\right) = - \\\\infty, which is not allowed for \\\\mu . Therefore, P is a positive set. Proof of the uniqueness statement: Suppose that (N',P') is another Hahn decomposition of X . Then P \\\\cap N' is a positive set and also a negative set. Therefore, every measurable subset of it has measure zero. The same applies to N \\\\cap P' . As : P \\\\triangle P' = N \\\\triangle N' = (P \\\\cap N') \\\\cup (N \\\\cap P'), this completes the proof. Q.E.D. References External links * Hahn decomposition theorem at PlanetMath.

After working in India for the British East India Company, Clement returned to London and married Christian Barter at St Dunstan and All Saints Church in Stepney on 25 June 1630. When the Civil War broke out, he supported Parliament. In 1648, he became an MP for Fowey in Cornwall. In January 1649, as a commissioner of the High Court of Justice at the trial of King Charles, he was 54th of the 59 signatories on the death warrant of the King‚Äìalthough his signature appears to have been written over an erased signature. He was dismissed from the House of Commons in 1652 over a scandal involving his maidservant. This may have been engineered by Thomas Harrison and other political opponents. Like all of the other 59 men who signed the death warrant for Charles I, Clement was in grave danger when Charles II of England was restored to the throne. Some of the 59 fled England but Clement went into hiding. He was discovered by a blind man, arrested, and put on trial. Although he initially pleaded innocent and remained silent while imprisoned, he eventually changed his plea and was found guilty of high treason. Clement was hanged, drawn and quartered at Charing Cross on 17 October 1660. According to Mark Twain's autobiography, an irate Virginian correspondent called him a descendant of a regicide (apparently referring to Gregory Clement) and berated him for supporting the-as he called it- aristocratic Republican Party.

Based in the western suburbs of Adelaide, South Australia, Woodville derived its name from the suburb it was located in. The club's lack of success was unparalleled in the VFL or WAFL with the club receiving 9 wooden spoons in 24 years whilst only making the finals 3 times without a grand final appearance. Club history There are newspaper references to a Woodville Football Club dating back to the 19th century, when Woodville and Adelaide were the only teams, but the modern club was formed in 1938 to play in local amateur competitions. In 1959 the SANFL was looking to expand the competition from eight to ten teams and selected Woodville and Central District to enter the SANFL reserves competition on a five-year apprenticeship before gaining admission to the league competition in 1964. The team was then known as the \\"Woodville Woodpeckers\\". Its inaugural season was an indicator of its success (or lack thereof) for the remainder of its existence. The club won just three matches, all against Central Districts. In its 27 seasons in the SANFL, Woodville reached the finals only three times: in 1979, 1986 and 1987; its best result was 3rd position in 1986. Woodville's most successful player was Malcolm Blight, who won the SANFL's Magarey Medal and gained selection in the All Australian team in 1972. He would later play for North Melbourne Football Club in the Victorian Football League (VFL), winning the Brownlow Medal in 1978 and joining a select group of players who had won the highest individual honor in both the SANFL and VFL competitions. Blight returned to Woodville in 1983 as Captain-Coach, leading the club through its most successful period. His first season back in Adelaide was unsuccessful, with the club finishing with the wooden spoon. From there the team started to gel and by 1986 was considered an outside chance of obtaining their first league premiership, but finished 3rd after losing to eventual premiers Glenelg in the Preliminary Final. They also made the finals in 1987, but came 5th, losing the Elimination Final to Glenelg. Blight stood down at the end of 1987 and was replaced by Port Adelaide Football Club legend and four time Magarey Medallist Russell Ebert. Under Ebert's coaching, Woodville won the SANFL Night Competition in 1988, the Escort Cup, defeating Port Adelaide 14.12 (96) to 7.9 (51) at Football Park. It would be the last trophy the Woodville Football Club would win in the SANFL. Woodville had also won the Coca-Cola Cup series in 1972, a competition between clubs which did not make the final four. As a struggling club with limited fans and finances, there were regular calls throughout the 1980s to merge Woodville with another club. In 1990, with the imminent entry of the South Australian-based Adelaide Crows into the national Australian Football League (formerly the VFL), it was decided to amalgamate Woodville with neighbouring West Torrens Football Club. In an apt moment, Woodville and West Torrens were drawn to play each other in their respective final games, with Woodville emerging victorious by 50 points, 24.10 (154) to 15.19 (104) at the Adelaide Oval. Before the game a number of legends from both clubs were introduced to the crowd. Woodville's captain in their last game was popular veteran Ralph Sewer (regular captain Romano Negri was in the team but stepped aside for the last game to give Sewer the honor). The 38-year-old Sewer who was playing his 382nd and last game of SANFL football. \\"Zip Zap\\" as he was known, made his league debut with Woodville in 1969 and was playing his 325th game for the club. He was Woodville's leading goal kicker in 1975, and had won the club's best & Fairest award in 1978, the same year he was awarded with Life Membership from the club and Player Life Membership from the SANFL. Sewer, who had played 57 games for perennial contenders Glenelg from 1981‚Äì84, is the only player to have played in four decades of football in the SANFL. The Woodville Warriors and the West Torrens Eagles merged after the completion of the 1990 season and have since participated in the SANFL as the Woodville-West Torrens Eagles, winning the SANFL premiership in 1993, 2006, 2011 and 2020.

She was incarcerated at Florence McClure Women's Correctional Center in North Las Vegas, Nevada. Some name her Las Vegas black widow.http://www.abc3340.com/news/nation-world/las-vegas-black-widow-denies- killing-millionaire-husband Early life Rudin was born in Memphis, Tennessee, one of three daughters. The family moved frequently, and before graduating from high school, Rudin had lived in 15 states.Las Vegas Review- Journal, \\"The Similarities: Older man, younger woman,\\" January 1, 2001 Rudin had married four times before meeting Ronald Rudin at the First Church of Religious Science in Las Vegas. The couple wed on September 11, 1987.People magazine, \\"Till Death Did Them Part,\\" by Peter Ames Carlin, March 6, 2000 Murder and investigation Ronald Rudin disappeared on December 18, 1994 after walking to Margaret's antique shop which was in the same strip mall as his real estate office. On January 21, 1995, his charred dismembered remains were discovered near Lake Mojave along with the burnt remains of an antique steamer trunk. He had been shot in the head at least four times with a .22 caliber gun. Police later searched the Rudin residence and found blood spatter in the bedroom as well as semen on the floor that had been removed from the home. On July 21, 1996 a .22 caliber Ruger handgun was found in Lake Mead and was traced back to Ron Rudin. The handgun was later confirmed to be the murder weapon. Ron Rudin had reported the gun missing in 1988, shortly after he married Margaret. Flight, arrest, and trial On April 18, 1997, the grand jury handed down a murder indictment against Margaret, but by this time, she had left the state. She spent the next 2 1/2 years in hiding until she was arrested in Massachusetts in November 1999 and was extradited to Nevada to face murder charges in the death of her husband. Margaret Rudin went on trial on March 2, 2001. Her defense claimed that her husband was killed due to illegal activities he was involved in. The prosecutor argued Margaret killed her husband to prevent him from divorcing her and losing what she would inherit from his estate. She was found guilty on May 2, 2001, and on August 31 she was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 20 years. Appeal In 2002, the Nevada Supreme Court denied Margaret Rudin's appeal, finding she was not denied effective assistance of counsel.State v. Rudin, 86 P.3d 572 (Nv Sup.Ct. 2004) As of 2008, no record of federal collateral review could be found. In 2008, Rudin was given a new trial. Clark County District Judge Sally Loehrer ruled that lawyers for Margaret Rudin, then 65 years old, were not prepared to defend her at her 2001 trial, according to lawyers on both sides of the case. She also ruled that Michael Amador, Rudin's lead attorney at the time, was not effective, according to Christopher Oram, Rudin's new attorney. KLTV-8 News reported on May 10, 2010 that the Nevada Supreme Court ruled against convicted Rudin and ruled she would not get another trial. The lower appeals court's ruling was overturned, and the original conviction stood. On April 26, 2011, the Las Vegas Sun reported that Margaret Rudin had filed a habeas corpus petition in federal court seeking a new trial and reversal of her conviction based on ineffective assistance of trial counsel, impermissible hearsay testimony, faulty jury instructions and other points. On January 25, 2012, U.S. District Court Judge Roger L. Hunt dismissed Margaret Rudin's federal habeas corpus case with prejudice. In a nine-page decision, Judge Hunt found that Rudin's federal petition was not filed in a timely manner. The ruling paves way for an appeal to the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco.Washington Examiner, \\"Federal judge rejects Vegas 'black widow' appeal,\\" January 25, 2012 On September 10, 2014, in a split decision by a three-judge panel, the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's order dismissing Rudin's federal habeas corpus case despite what it acknowledged to be serious issues with her representation and prosecution, both pre- and post- conviction.Opinion from Ninth Circuit website http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2014/09/10/12-15362.pdf The court deemed that it was compelled to deny her petition, and it acknowledged that it was \\"troubled\\" by the case. Excerpts from the Opinion's Conclusion: > We are troubled by the outcome of this case for many reasons. Margaret > Rudin's direct appeal and collateral review proceedings have been pending in > either state or federal court for a combined total of 13 years. She has > potentially meritorious claims that she has suffered prejudice at the hands > of her own attorneys' egregious misconduct. Yet she has never had an > opportunity to present those claims in court. > Rudin's defense counsel, Amador, indisputably engaged in egregious > professional misconduct during the course of her underlying criminal trial. > On direct appeal of her judgment of conviction, the Nevada Supreme Court > acknowledged that Rudin's trial was plagued not only with inadequacies on > the part of defense counsel, but also with prosecutorial misconduct and > legal error on the part of the State and the court. Although two members of > the Nevada Supreme Court found the record sufficiently clear as to the > \\"inherent prejudice created by [trial counsel]\\" to require immediate > reversal of Rudin's judgment of conviction, a majority of the court declined > to address the effect of those errors, finding them more appropriate for > resolution on collateral review. > [A]t this point, Rudin is still in prison, having served 13 years of her > life sentence for murder. We know from the state post-conviction court that > the State's \\"proof of guilt [at that trial] was not a slam dunk by any > stretch of the imagination.\\" We also know from the post-conviction court > that, had Rudin been represented by competent counsel, the jury's verdict > may have been different. Thus, what we do not know is whether Rudin is > lawfully imprisoned. And, regrettably, that is something we may never know. On March 10, 2015, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals withdrew its opinion of September 10, 2014 and issued a revised opinion affirming the trial court's decision that Rudin was entitled to a new trial as a direct result of the professional misconduct and prejudicial conflict of interest by Michael Amador, her original trial lawyer.Revised Opinion by the Ninth Circuit On February 29, 2016 the United States Supreme Court denied a petition by the attorney general of Nevada challenging the Ninth Circuit's ruling. Release Margaret Rudin was released on parole from the Florence McClure Women‚Äôs Correctional Center in North Las Vegas on January 10, 2020.

Born 1876, son of Michael Lloyd Ferrar, Ferrar was educated at St. Columba's College, Rugby and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst where he was a contemporary of Winston Churchill. He joined the Indian Civil Service in 1861 and arrived in India in 1863. He joined the Indian Army at the age of 20 in 1896. Ferrar opted to move to the Civil Service and was inducted into the Punjab Commission. During the five years that he was in the army (where he served on the Tirah Campaign 1897-98), he studied Urdu, Persian, Arabic, Punjabi and Pashto. He worked as a settlement officer in Oudh around 1875. Before becoming Commissioner of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands he served at various positions in northern and northwestern parts of British India. From 1902-1906 he commanded the Baloch Levy, was a postal censor at Bombay, 1915-18, and deputy commissioner Lahore, 1919-23, during which time he was involved in the arrest of Lala Lajpat Rai and Satyanand Stokes on charges of sedition. Ferrar was responsible for increasing agriculture on the Andamans. Under his management, tea, coffee and rubber were tried on the island and land was allotted to settlers between 1923 and 1926. On the advice of Colonel Christopher Covell, swamps were drained. Ferrargunj was named after him and was originally a settlement for Bhantus who were then designated as a criminal tribe. The settlement was attacked by Jarawas and Ferrar launched punitive measures against the Jarawas. He initiated measures to protect fishing grounds in the Andamans from being poached by Singapore fishermen for Trochus shells. Ferrar retired in 1931 and returned to England serving as a Major in the Home Guard around 1940-41. In 1932 he wrote a chapter on the history of Islam in India. His proficience in Indian languages led to him being appointed an examiner in Urdu at Cambridge University from 1934-62.Kelly's Handbook to the Titled, Landed and Official Classes 1967, p.730 A keen naturalist and student of the butterfly fauna, he collected over 4000 specimens which are now in the Natural History Museum at London. He was in close contact with other lepidopterists such as Brigadier W. H. Evans who visited the Andamans towards the end of Ferrar's tenure there.

The 105-minute film was shot in 2004 in a village called Marnad near Mangalore, Karnataka, and was released in 2005. The film is an adaptation of the Tulu Sahitya Academy award-winning Tulu play called Bojja written by Mumbai-based playwright, Narayana Nandalike. Suddha was produced by three Mumbai Tuluvas Mohan Marnad, Surendra Kumar and Ramchandra PN. It was directed by Ramchandra PN, a graduate of the Film and Television Institute of India, Poona. Suddha was his first feature-length film. Plot Suddha depicts the death of the feudal system that existed among the Tulu speaking community in coastal Karnataka for many years, and the impact of The Land Ceiling Act which was ushered during the 1960s and 1970s, had on its social structure. It is the story of modern India ‚Äì of changing caste equations and a realization of this reality among the land-owning class, albeit a bit late. Though the film is set in a remote village near Mangalore, it could well have happened in any other village elsewhere in India. An ex- landlord family comes to terms with the fact that they are living in their last leg of feudal existence when it cannot perform a last rites in a grand manner in which it was once used to. Use of sound The uniqueness of this film is that it uses available lights and natural sounds. The sound tack or the sound design of this film as a text is something new to Tulu cinema. There is no background music in the film, carefully places sound effects themselves give the effect that music gives. > \\"The film uses the chirping of birds, flowing water and folklore-like songs > extensively as its outdoor sound and ticking sound of clock for the indoor > sound.

Over the past thirty five years around 35 Tulu films have been made. The Tulu Film has no organised industry as such ‚Äì in the sense that there is no comprehensive production, distribution and exhibition systems as it exists in the film industries of other Indian languages. The risk of making, distributing and exhibiting the film lies solely with the maker himself. The market for a Tulu film consists of only two districts (Dakshina Kannada and Udupi) in Coastal Karnataka, South India. Digital feature film Presently most independent documentaries in India are shot digitally. Over the years many short film makers have also sprung up, using the digital medium for their expression. But digital feature films in fiction are far and few in India. The Indian Feature film industry still prefers to shoot films in the celluloid format, although in recent times some films have been exhibited in the digital format. But films shot digitally either do not get a theatrical release (Pankaj Advani's 'Urf Professor') or are converted into celluloid and then released (Ram Madhvani's Let's Talk). Alternative distribution system A screening of Suddha (The Cleansing Rites) in a village school Suddha got digitally screened in various colleges affiliated with the Mangalore University through DVD players and medium sized digital projectors. The Mangalore University caters to the two Tulu language speaking districts of Karnataka, South India. The local cultural troupes, amateur drama clubs and literary groups also helped giving platform to this film in its quest to reach its audience. Around hundred screenings have taken place; some of them in the most remote areas of the two districts. These screenings were facilitated by a modest grant from 'The Hubart Bals' fund, based out of the Netherlands. > \\"Half and hour to the first show, he switched on his TV set, connected it to > a loud speaker, played some local music and smiled, ‚Äòthis would let the > people know that a function is about to begin.‚Äô Sure enough, the place > gradually got filled and soon Kudkadi was seen excitedly talking about my > film to his audience that mainly consisted of uneducated daily laborers > working in and around the village.\\" (Source: Filmmaker's blog)Filmmaker's blog Writer and Filmmaker Ranjan Das in his regular column at mydigitalfc.com talks about how hard it was to get the film an audience. > \\"Mumbai-based filmmaker Ramchandra PN is a name that wouldn‚Äôt ring a bell to > most filmgoers.

His mother kindled an interest in nature and, when he was sent to King's School, Canterbury, he was already interested in butterflies and moths. He joined the army at the age of 18 and was posted with the Royal Engineers. In 1898 he began collecting butterflies in Chitral. He was sent on duty with the Somaliland Expedition (1902‚Äì04), and he injured his knee. He served in France from 1914 to 1918 and was awarded the D.S.O. and a brevet. Exposure to poison gas, however, caused him permanent chest problems. He returned to India in 1919 with his final post in the Western Command at Quetta as a Chief Engineer. He retired in 1931 and travelled to London via Australia. His home was close to the Natural History Museum and he continued to work on Military service and was attached with the Non-Intervention Committee during the Spanish Civil War and later took up work as an Air Raid Warden. He was at a window in the Natural History Museum, facing South on to Cromwell Road when a German V1 flying bomb burst on the road away. He was injured and his hearing was permanently impaired. His wife lived in Bournemouth during the air raids (and died there in 1945). Evans, however, stayed in London to complete his Revision of the Hesperiidae of the world, as he stated \\"before he died\\". Evans collected butterflies throughout his career in India and was very knowledgeable on distribution patterns. His favourite collection areas included Kodaikanal, Jabalpur, Simla, Murree, Darjeeling, Chitral and Baluchistan. He travelled to Australia to collect the endemic subfamily Trapezitinae. He did not set and preserve specimens in cabinets and preferred paper covers. From 1923 he published keys to the identification of Indian butterflies in the Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society. Evans examined over half a million specimens of Hesperiidae in the museum. Evans was influenced by the works of Bernhard Rensch, Ernst Mayr and Thomas Huxley, but he was not comfortable with the ideas of phylogenetic classification. His only son, Dr. J. W. Evans, continued in Entomology as a Director of the Australian Museum, Sydney. His collection is in the Natural History Museum, London.  Publications  * 1937. A Catalogue of the African Hesperiidae.

They are best known for the Canadian hit single \\"Tokyo Rose\\", which peaked at #16 on RPM's Canadian singles chart in June 1985. History The band had its genesis in 1980 while Tad Campbell was travelling in Australia, when he encountered an advertisement for a local band looking for a guitarist. He joined the band, which spent several months as the house band at a resort in the Whitsunday Islands, during which time they were also joined by new vocalist Donna McConville, who would also become Campbell's girlfriend. They later moved to Townsville, where they recorded early demos of several songs that would eventually end up on the band's first two albums. Campbell eventually returned to Canada with McConville, putting together a new lineup since most of the original Australian members had not moved with them. The band lineup changed frequently over the early years, including McConville eventually leaving the band when her relationship with Campbell ended. She returned to Australia, where she became a backing vocalist for John Farnham. The band was nearly dormant when Campbell made a last-ditch effort to record a demo, which he sent to Payolas manager Cliff Jones in the hopes of securing a recording contract. Jones responded favourably, so Campbell and drummer Phil Robertson recruited Glenn R. Smith, Miles Fox Hill and John Webster to record the band's self-titled debut album. The singles \\"Tokyo Rose\\" and \\"All Day\\" won awards from SOCAN as two of the top ten most played songs on Canadian radio that year. The band toured extensively as an opening act for Loverboy, Bryan Adams, Tears for Fears, Toto, The Human League and Red Rider, as well as at a nationally televised Expo 86 gala which also featured Adams, Loverboy, Sheena Easton, V√©ronique B√©liveau and Kenny Rogers. Also in 1985, Campbell participated in the recording of \\"Actions Speak Louder Than Words\\", a charity single to raise money for Canadian food banks, alongside Mike Reno, Paul Dean and Matt Frenette of Loverboy, Darby Mills of Headpins, Johnnie Dee and Derry Grehan of Honeymoon Suite, Paul Hyde, Carole Pope and Murray McLauchlan. Idle Eyes were nominated for three Juno Awards in 1985, winning for Most Promising New Group. Other awards included six West Coast Music Awards, winning group of the year honors in 1985 and 1986. Campbell won Songwriter of the Year in 1985 for \\"Tokyo Rose\\", which was also named Song of the Year. \\"Tokyo Rose\\" was inspired by the generic name \\"Tokyo Rose\\", which was used to describe female Japanese DJs who attempted to shake the morale of American soldiers and spread propaganda in the Pacific Theater during World War II. Their second album Love's Imperfection was produced by Michael Beinhorn and engineered by Bob Rock at the Little Mountain Studio. Released at Christmastime with no videos, the album sold fewer than 20,000 units and the band was dropped from their label a few months later. The band carried on for a few years, with a revolving line up and a minor hit, \\"Blue Train\\", from their independently produced third album Standing at the Edge. A best-of album, Land of the Midnight Sun, was released in 1994 and featured six new songs. After the band's breakup in 1994, Campbell formed the bands Leghold Trap, Millions of Brazilians and Big Daddio before reforming Idle Eyes in the early 2000s.

As of 2018, the lineup consists of Davy Vain (lead vocals), Joel Proto (guitar), Ashley Mitchell (bass) and Tommy Rickard (drums). After recording a demo, Davy Vain founded Vain in 1986, adding Dylana Nova (formerly Jamie Scott before coming out as transgender), Danny West, Ashley Mitchell and drummer Tom Rickard to the lineup. They signed with Island Records in 1988, before releasing their debut album the following year, titled No Respect, which peaked at number 154 on the Billboard 200. Though they recorded a second album, Vain were released by Island in 1991, with West and Rickard departing the same year. Following the addition of both Shawn Rorie and former Guns N' Roses drummer Steven Adler, Vain renamed themselves Road Crew. However, they also disbanded in 1991. The band reformed in 1993 and went through a number of lineup changes for the release of their next two studio albums. By 2005, Scott and West had returned to the band, while Rickard would rejoin them in 2009 (before departing again the following year). To date, Vain have released seven studio albums; No Respect (1989); All Those Strangers (1991); Move On It (1993); Fade (1995); On The Line (2005); Enough Rope (2011), and Rolling With The Punches (2017). History =Formation and No Respect (1986‚Äì1990)= Davy Vain had initially began his career as a record producer, producing Death Angel's debut album The Ultra-Violence, before recording a demo with Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammett in 1986. After recording, Vain decided to form a band, in the San Francisco Bay Area, under his own moniker, adding bassist Ashley Mitchell, drummer Tom Rickard and guitarists Dylana Nova and Danny West to the lineup. From 1986 to 1987, the band proceeded to play shows in San Francisco, before playing regularly in Los Angeles, where they also opened for Guns N' Roses prior to their success, and were featured on the cover of Kerrang! magazine. After showcasing to major record labels, including Geffen Records, Vain signed with Island Records in 1988. Recorded with producer Paul Northfield, Vain released their debut album entitled No Respect in 1989. The album peaked at number 154 on the Billboard 200. Critically, the album was also well received, with Vain featured on the covers of both Kerrang! and BAM. Geoff Barton would later give a positive review for Classic Rock describing the album as \\"a Maybelline-metalised debut par excellence ‚Äì no 'perhaps' about it\\" with the music being \\"unharnessed, haystack-haired heaviness from beginning to end\\" and that \\"it's the Cr√ºe at their most coarse and corrupted.\\" In support of the album, Vain toured the US while they also supported Skid Row on their tour of the UK. =Released by Island and Road Crew (1990‚Äì1991)= The band began recording their second album, titled All Those Strangers, with producer Jeff Hendrickson. The release of the album was advertised in Japan while a number of pre-release cassettes were released. However, when Island Records were bought by PolyGram, Vain were dropped by the label in 1991, with All Those Strangers remaining unreleased. The same year, West and Rickard departed the band. Vain soon added guitarist Shawn Rorie and former Guns N' Roses drummer Steven Adler to the line-up. Vain then renamed themselves Road Crew, the name of one of Adler's previous bands that featured both Slash and Duff McKagan. They recorded a new album and gained record label attention. However, Adler's drug problems at the time led to the band disbanding. =Reformation and subsequent releases (1993‚Äì2008)= Vain reformed in 1993 with new drummer Danny Fury, formerly of The Lords of the New Church, to record their third album (and second release) Move On It, which was released in Japan through Polystar Records. The rise in popularity of Seattle's grunge movement meant the album did not achieve the same success as No Respect. By the time Vain began recording their fourth album, Nova, West and Fury had departed the band, with Nova going on to audition for Ozzy Osbourne and join Big Blue Hearts, while West released a solo EP entitled Taste the Sounds. With Davy Vain handling both vocal and guitar duties, as well as producing the album, and Mitchell on bass, Vain added drummer Louie Senor to the line-up to record Fade, which was released in 1995, through Polystar. In 2000, Davy recorded and released his debut solo album entitled In From Out of Nowhere with Mitchell, Senor and guitarist Craig Behrhorst. The same year, Nova returned to the band and contributed to the solo album. The following year, Davy worked with Christina Aguilera as the assistant engineer and Pro Tools engineer on her album Stripped. Vain re-released their debut album No Respect, through Gott Discs in 2005, with West rejoining the band. In support of the re-release, Vain toured the UK, for the first time since 1989, and Europe from May 21‚ÄìJune 3. Kerrang! writer Steve Beebee reviewed their show at Rock City in Nottingham, stating that \\"even though their set-list includes a mere four songs from that Holy Grail of debuts [No Respect],\\" it was a gig that \\"leave[s] you genuinely amazed, and more than anything, angry that a trend- fixed music industry could possibly have suppressed this awesome band for 15 years.\\" Vain then recorded a new album entitled On the Line in Davy's recording studio, The Groove Room, which was released on August 23 of the same year through Perris Records. Reviewing the album for Blogcritics, Chris Akin stated that \\"Vain seem to have stepped back into the time machine and created an album that falls somewhere between No Respect and Fade\\" and that \\"one of the best unknown bands of the era comes back with a cool reunion album here.\\" Vain toured again in 2006 while in 2008, they performed at Rocklahoma and the four-day Rock the Bayou festival from August 29‚ÄìSeptember 1. =All Those Strangers, Enough Rope and Rolling with the Punches (2009‚Äìpresent)= In 2009, original Vain drummer Tom Rickard returned to the line-up, with the band toured the UK from November 24‚ÄìDecember 1 the same year. The following year, after acquiring the master recordings, Vain released All Those Strangers, that was originally to be released in 1991, through Davy's Jackie Rainbow Records. Reviewing All Those Strangers for The Austin Chronicle, Raoul Hernandez compared the music to Mother Love Bone, stating that the album \\"initially came on like a comedown from its fast, trashy birth mother.\\" However, \\"upon release [the album] now proves no slump.\\" In 2011, Vain toured Europe, with a new line-up including Deathstars guitarists Cat Casino and Skinny Disco, before releasing their new album entitled Enough Rope on October 28, through Music Buy Mail, in the US and Europe, and Spiritual Beast/Universal in Japan. The album featured drums by Rickard, Senor and Adler as well as unreleased material from their time as Road Crew. An additional song from the Road Crew sessions was included on the Japanese release of the album. In 2017, Vain released the album, Rolling with the Punches. The album featured several new tracks. The band toured the UK and Germany in the Summer/Fall of 2017. Nova, now a multi-patented inventor of guitar gear, appears live and records with the band on a limited basis after relocating to Nashville, TN in 2009 and having greater focus on personal life as well as business with guitar amplifier company, 3rd Power Amplification.

They formed in 1989. History The Hitchers released two LPs in the UK and Ireland: It's All Fun and Games Til Someone Loses an Eye (1997) and For the Want of Some Better TV (1999). They are perhaps best remembered in the UK for the song \\"Strachan\\", a kitchen sink opera wherein the protagonist is involved in an argument while simultaneously watching a football match on TV that features the Scottish footballer Gordon Strachan in an early 1990s Leeds United side versus an unspecified opposition (though the studio recordings fade-out features a sample that suggests the opposition are the Birmingham club Aston Villa). Though the single did not chart on its release in summer 1997 (it was released by a small new independent label, Murgatroid, and distributed by Vital, as a double a-side 33rpm 7\\" vinyl b/w \\"You Can Only Love Someone So Much But You Can Hate Them All The Way To Hell\\" and as track 2 of a 4-song CD EP) it received considerable airplay from prolific UK-based DJs including John Peel, Steve Lamacq, Gideon Coe, Sean Hughes and Bob Geldof and is still occasionally heard on UK radio to the present day. It has been cited as one of the great \\"football songs\\" in the press and in online discussion/commentary. The alternative A-side of the single, \\"You Can Only Love Someone So Much But You Can Hate Them All The Way To Hell\\", the lyrics of which consist solely of the song's title, is notable in that it was nominated in the Best Irish Single 1997 category in Ireland's Hot Press awards (won by \\"A Life Less Ordinary\\" by Ash). The song was subsequently used in the movie Rat (Universal Pictures-2000).https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0234570/fullcredits#cast The Hitchers recorded a Peel Session at BBC Maida Vale 4 in July 1997. This was broadcast in November 1997 and repeated in February 1998. This session was re- broadcast again by Gideon Coe in February 2008 and May 2011. While supporting The Divine Comedy at Mandela Hall, Belfast in June 1997 The Hitchers were recorded live and broadcast on the Steve Lamacq show. Their 1997 Dave Fanning Session, recorded for RT√â, was re-broadcast on the Dan Hegarty Show in 2006 as part of his 'Classic Session' series. The Cranberries connection The Hitchers drummer Niall Quinn (b. 1973) was, perhaps somewhat unusually, the band's primary songwriter and while The Hitchers were still only a few months in existence he joined a second band as lead vocalist/guitarist as a further outlet for his song-writing. This band called themselves The Cranberry Saw Us and also featured Noel Hogan (Guitar), Mike Hogan (bass) and Fergal Lawler (drums). The Cranberry Saw Us did several gigs in Limerick between November 1989 and February 1990 and recorded a demo, called Anything, in January 1990, before Quinn quit the band stating he was unsuited to the lead vocalist/frontman role. Post-departure he recommended two other males who might be suitable replacements. After Noel Hogan mentioned to him that the band were considering trying out a female vocalist Quinn had Dolores O'Riordan recommended to him by a friend of his who attended the same school as her. Quinn obtained a phone number, contacted her and invited her to come along to a TCSU rehearsal which he also attended to help show O'Riordan what they had been playing. Thereafter O'Riordan, the Hogan brothers and Lawler began rehearsing and writing together and eventually shortened the band's name to The Cranberries. After The Hitchers Niall Quinn has continued to write, record and perform since The Hitchers split in 2001. Returning to the lead vocalist/guitarist role for the first time since The Cranberry Saw Us his next band was called The Pennywhores (sometimes called Niall Quinn & The Pennywhores) The Pennywhores also featured Eric Fitzgerald on guitar. Two EPs 'Legalise Murder' and 'Murder He Did' were released through 4-3-3 in Ireland in 2004/05. An LP titled 'Javier Clemente is pulling off his Captain' is alluded to in the sleeve notes of the Murder He Did EP but was apparently never released. In 2009 Quinn released a new single 'Rose' on CD/ download under a new moniker Theme Tune Boy. The single is less than a minute in duration. This was followed in 2010 by another CD/download EP Tailrace and a third single January Drabs in 2011. An LP to be titled (the) Return of the Living Dead was recorded in 2011 with Dutch punk rock band Cooper performing on the bulk of the tracks. A track list was published on the Theme Tune Boy fb page but no release date, label or other information was given. Following a crowd-funding campaign wherein Quinn offered the front cover of the album among the rewards that could be claimed, Quinn announced on social media that Return of the Living Dead would be released on 19 January 2013. This was confirmed on the alternative music blog Louder Than War which featured an extensive review of the album.

It was developed in the late 1940s and was widely used in the agricultural industry until being phased out, starting in the late 1970s due to toxicity concerns. Agent Orange, a defoliant used by the British in the Malayan Emergency and the U.S. in the Vietnam War, was equal parts 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid). 2,4,5-T itself is toxic with a NOAEL of 3 mg/kg/day and a LOAEL of 10 mg/kg/day. Additionally, the manufacturing process for 2,4,5-T contaminates this chemical with trace amounts of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). TCDD is a carcinogenic persistent organic pollutant with long-term effects on the environment. With proper temperature control during production of 2,4,5-T, TCDD levels can be held to about .005 ppm. Before the TCDD risk was well understood, early production facilities lacked proper temperature controls and individual batches tested later were found to have as much as 60 ppm of TCDD. In 1970, the United States Department of Agriculture halted the use of 2,4,5-T on all food crops except rice, and in 1985, the EPA terminated all remaining uses in the U.S. of this herbicide. In Canada, the use and sale of 2,4,5-T was prohibited after 1985. The international trade of 2,4,5-T is restricted by the Rotterdam Convention. 2,4,5-T has since largely been replaced by dicamba and triclopyr. Human health effects from 2,4,5-T at low environmental doses or at biomonitored levels from low environmental exposures are unknown. Intentional overdoses and unintentional high dose occupational exposures to chlorophenoxy acid herbicides have resulted in weakness, headache, dizziness, nausea, abdominal pain, myotonia, hypotension, renal and hepatic injury, and delayed neuropathy. Cometabolism of 2,4,5-T is possible to produce 3,5-dichlorocatechol which, in turn, can be degraded by Pseudomonas bacteria. IARC considers the chlorophenoxyacetic acids group of chemicals as possibly carcinogenic to humans. In 1963 a production vessel for 2,4,5-T exploded in the Philips-Duphar plant in the Netherlands. Six workers that cleaned up afterwards got seriously intoxicated and developed chloracne. After twelve years, four of the six cleaners had died. References Further reading * Tschirley FH.

He was a graduate of Harvard University. He gained international fame with the crime novel The Glendower Legacy and later with the Vatican thriller The Assassini. The books posited George Washington as a British spy and the Roman Catholic Church as a criminal organization. The Glendower Legacy was made into a movie in 1981 under the name Dirty Tricks. Gifford also published under the names Dana Clarins and Thomas Maxwell. He died of cholangiocarcinoma in his home in Dubuque, Iowa, on Halloween 2000. Bibliography Won awards at Harvard for creative writing; worked at The Sun newspaper and The Guthrie; won Putnam's prize for best first novel (The Wind Chill Factor). From Dubuque, Iowa, after graduating from college he moved to the Twin Cities, Minnesota, where he and his wife, Kari Sandven, had two children (Thomas Eaton, Rachel Claire). Divorced in 1969, he went on to marry Camille D'Ambrose, a local actress. They moved to Los Angeles for a few years, then returned to Orono, MN. Novels continued to flow from his fountain pen through the years. Gifford eventually moved to New York‚Äîa city he loved whose people were of infinite importance to him. In 1996, he turned his attention to renovating his childhood home in Dubuque, spending more time in Iowa than New York during his last years.

He wrote a book on \\"racial hygiene\\" called Deutsches Gold, Gesundes Leben - Frohes Schaffen. Reiter was born in Reudnitz, near Leipzig in the German Empire. He studied medicine at Leipzig and Breslau (now Wroc≈Çaw), and received a doctorate from T√ºbingen on the subject of tuberculosis. After receiving his doctorate, he went on to study at the hygiene institute in Berlin, the Pasteur Institute in Paris and St. Mary's Hospital in London, where he worked with Sir Almroth Wright for two years. Reiter was also known for implementing strict anti-smoking laws in Nazi Germany. First World War During World War I, Reiter worked first as a German military physician on the Western Front in France. While there, he cared for several soldiers suffering from Weil's disease, and made his first notable discovery that one of the causative bacteria were Leptospira icterohaemorrhagica, which had eluded culture methods and identification by other scientists ever since that disease had been recognized in 1886. Later, after being transferred to the Balkans, where he served in the 1st Hungarian Army, he reported a German lieutenant with non-gonococcal urethritis, arthritis, and uveitis that developed two days after a diarrheal illness and had a protracted course with relapses over several months. The combination of two of the elements, urethritis and arthritis, had been recognized in the 16th century, and the triad had first been reported by Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie, an English surgeon who lived from 1783 to 1862. Separately from Reiter, the triad was also reported in 1916 by Fiessinger and Leroy. Reiter thought he saw a spirochete which he called Treponema forans, related to but distinct from Treponema pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis, and erroneously thought it was the cause, calling the disease Spirochaetosis Arthritica. The error probably was influenced by his previous discovery of Leptospira icterohaemorrhagica, and by his work on Treponema pallidum that later enabled others to develop the \\"Reiter Complement Fixation Test\\" for syphilis. Nevertheless, the eponym Reiter's syndrome was used for the disease he described, and the syndrome became widely known by that name. 1918‚Äì1939 After the end of World War I, Reiter became chief of the hygiene department at Rostock. He was a political man, and an enthusiastic supporter of the Nazi regime. His career was further boosted when, in 1932, he signed an oath of allegiance to Adolf Hitler. In 1933, he was made department director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Experimental Therapy. In 1936, his meteoric rise continued when he was made director of the health department of Mecklenberg- Schwerin and received an honorary professorship in Berlin. With Johann Breger, he wrote a book on racial hygiene called Deutsches Gold, Gesundes Leben -- Frohes Schaffen (\\"German Gold, Healthy Life -- Glad Work\\"). He was also a strong supporter of Hitler's anti-smoking campaign, considered medically progressive at the time. Reiter was a talented teacher who was popular with his students. Second World War Watchtower at the memorial site Buchenwald, in 1983 Reiter was a member of the Schutzstaffel (SS) during World War II and participated in medical experiments performed by the Nazis. After the Nazis were defeated, he was arrested by the Red Army in Soviet Union-occupied Germany and tried at Nuremberg. During his detention, he admitted to knowledge of involuntary sterilization, euthanasia, and the murder of mental hospital patients in his function as the gatherer of statistics and acting as \\"quality control\\" officer, and to helping design and implement an explicitly criminal undertaking at Buchenwald concentration camp, in which internees were inoculated with an experimental typhus vaccine, resulting in over 200 deaths. He gained an early release from his internment, possibly because he assisted the Allies with his knowledge of germ warfare.  Later life After his release, Reiter went back to work in the field of medicine and research in rheumatology. He died at age 88, in 1969, at his country estate in Kassel- Wilhelmsh√∂he. Controversy In 1977, a group of doctors began a campaign to replace the term \\"Reiter's syndrome\\" with \\"reactive arthritis\\". In addition to Reiter's war crimes, they pointed out that he was not the first to describe the syndrome, nor were his conclusions correct regarding its pathogenesis. Reiter incorrectly concluded that the triad of conjunctivitis, urethritis, and non-gonococcal arthritis was the result of a spirochetal infection and proposed the name \\"Spirochaetosis arthrosis\\". The group of doctors was joined by Dr. Ephraim Engleman, one of the authors on the first English-language journal article that used the term \\"Reiter's syndrome,\\" who was still practicing 65 years later and had been unaware of his Nazi connections at the time he suggested the eponym. The campaign gradually gained momentum, and the term \\"Reiter's syndrome\\" has become increasingly anachronistic and has fallen out of favor.

It is situated in Manama, adjacent to the National Theatre of Bahrain. Opened on 15 December 1988 by the Emir of Bahrain Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa, the $30 million museum complex covers 27,800 sq meters and is the country's most popular tourist attraction. It is believed to be the region's first modern museum. History Commemorative plaque of the museum's inauguration In 1957, the first exhibition of archaeological artifacts in Bahrain occurred at the Hidaya Boys School in Muharraq in collaboration with the Danish Archaeological Expedition sent to the Bahrain Fort. The temporary exhibition lasted for a few days but drew significant interest in archaeology from the Bahraini community. In 1967, a cultural agreement was signed between UNESCO and the Bahraini government which helped pave the way for the construction of a national museum. A national museum was first opened at Government House in Manama on 4 March 1970 by the head of state council at the time, Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa. The modern museum was designed by Danish architects Krohn & Hartvig Rasmussen and officially opened in December 1988. It was constructed on an artificial peninsula overlooking the neighbouring island of Muharraq. The museum is made of two buildings spanning a floor space of 20,000 square meters. The complex contains six permanent exhibitions, an educational hall, a gift shop and a cafeteria, in addition to administrative offices, laboratories and warehouses for the Conservation of holdings and parking. The museum celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2013 by renovating the Hall of Dilmun Graves, and hosting an international conference on museum development. The museum is open from 10 am to 6 pm, with the complex being closed on Tuesdays. The museum also offers regular daytime boat trips to the Bu Maher Fort on Muharraq island, a part of the Bahrain Pearling Trail. Collections The museum possess a collection of Bahrain's ancient archaeological artifacts acquired since 1988, and covering around 5000 years of Bahrain's history. The complex includes three halls devoted to archaeology and the ancient civilisation of the Dilmun, while two other halls depict the culture and lifestyle of Bahrain's recent pre-industrial past. In 1993, a further hall was opened, the Natural History Hall, focusing on the natural environment of Bahrain. This hall features specimens of Bahrain's flora and fauna. =Hall of Dilmun= The exhibit focuses on artifacts and the history of the Dilmun civilization from 5000 BC to 400 BC, including its widespread trading network with Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley. On display are Dilmunite stamp seals, artifacts from Barbar temple and Saar Temple, and Dilmunite pottery. A notable exhibit is the Durand Stone, a long black basalt sculpture dating back to the Babylonian era. Another feature is a tableau which depicts a scene from the Epic of Gilgamesh (in which reference to Bahrain is made as the paradise of Dilmun). =Hall of Dilmun Graves= The exhibit focuses on burial practices of the Dilmun civilization and features an actual burial mound which was transported from its site A'ali and reassembled within the museum. The hall was closed for renovation in 2013 and re-opened to the public on 26 June 2018. Re-designed by French architect Didier Blin, the revamped hall features newly-installed multimedia as well as findings from the most recent archaeological excavations. In 2019, the Dilmun Burial Mounds of Bahrain were recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. =Hall of Tylos and Islam= The hall covers the Hellenic-influenced history of Bahrain from the 2nd century BC onwards as well as interactions with the Seleucid empire and Characene kingdom. This exhibit hosts glazed pottery and glasses, alabaster containers and jewelry dating from that era. The Islamic portion of the exhibit follows Bahrain's adoption of Islam in the 7th century AD until the 18th century. It features artifacts from the Khamis Mosque, the oldest mosque in Bahrain, as well as Kufic inscriptions, timber beams, ceramic and glass. =Hall of Documents and Manuscripts= Rare copies of the Qur'an dating back from the 13th and 14th centuries, notes on astronomy and historical documents and letters from the ruling Al Khalifa family are exhibited in the hall. =Hall of Customs and Traditions= This exhibit focuses on the customs and traditions of Bahrain prior to the discovery of oil in 1932 and its subsequent modernization. Aspects of everyday life such as childhood, marriage, fashion, local religious and medical practices, and the structure of a traditional Bahraini house are exhibited. =Hall of Traditional Trades and Crafts= Featuring a recreation of a traditional Bahraini souq, this exhibit showcases traditional craftsmen and includes a section on pearl diving, a key component of the country's pre-oil economy.

At the 2011 Census, it had a population of 10,433. Historically part of Lancashire, the early history of Eccleston is marked by its status as a township, an area much larger than the modern civil parish, extending into what is now St. Helens. Part of the township was united with Parr, Sutton and part of Windle to form the Municipal Borough of St Helens in 1868. Eccleston is one of seven civil parishes in St Helens and one of the largest covering the neighbourhoods of Eccleston Park, Gillars Green, Trapwood Close and the area around Springfield south of the A580 road. History Eccleston means church farm or settlement. Eccles which is found in several place names in the North West of England is derived from the Welsh Eglwys and the use of this word implies a Celtic religious foundation. However, there does not seem to have been a church in the township of Eccleston until Portico Our Lady's Roman Catholic chapel in the late 18th century. St Thomas, Eccleston (now on Westfield Street, St Helens town centre) and Christ Church date from 1838/39. It is suggested that the name is connected with the adjoining town of Prescot which has had a church for over a thousand years. The present Eccleston Hall dates from the 1820s but there have been halls on the site from the late mediaeval period. The Eccleston family, who were Lords of the Manor of Eccleston, were recusants and there was a Catholic chapel in the old hall which was built in the Tudor era. Richard Seddon (1845‚Äì1906), 15th Prime Minister of New Zealand, was born in Eccleston and attended the local grammar school.Hamer, David. \\"Seddon, Richard John - Biography\\". By David Hamer. Dictionary of New Zealand Biography. Ministry for Culture and Heritage. Governance The stream running through Eccleston Eccleston is built upon green fertile rolling hills with countryside to the north and west and urban sprawl to south and east. Running through Eccleston there is a stream or brook called Windle Brook (actually the boundary with Windle CP) and Mill Brook. There is a mere called Eccleston Mere and three dams used for cooling purposes in factories. There are several open public spaces including many woods and small nature reserve at Millfields. There are a number of public footpaths through local countryside such as Green Lane and Sadlers Lane. There is a large public area at Ecclesfield playing fields, which is located behind the library. Transport Road connections are to the M6, M62, M57 and M58. The A580 (Liverpool to Manchester) locally known as the 'East Lancs' is a 1930s trunk road running north of the borough linking the M58 and M6, traffic problems are often reported at the notorious Windle Island. The A570 (St Helens to Southport) links the M58 and M62. The B5201 takes traffic from Prescot through the centre of Eccleston. There are many frequent bus services that run to parts of St Helens and Liverpool some of these are: 35/35A Gillars Green-St Helens Junction (Arriva) 37 Eccleston-St Helens Bus Station (Arriva) 137/138 Billinge/St Helens Circular (HTL) There are no railway stations in Eccleston but there are a number of stations close by such as St Helens Central, St Helens Junction, Eccleston Park, Prescot, Whiston. Liverpool John Lennon Airport is the closest airport and Manchester second to that both no more than a 45-minute drive. Housing Houses in Eccleston include 1930s semi-detached homes in Eccleston village, council estates at Gillars Green and Trapwood Close (now a mixture of private and housing association property), small 1970s housing estates at Eccleston Mere and an abundance of 1990s detached houses, including small developments at Ledbury Close, Long Meadow, Eccleston Woods and The Cloisters. Most recently, detached houses have been built at The Spires and Pikes Bridge Fold, and flats have been built on Holme Road. Extensive development is currently being carried out at Eccleston Grange on the site of the old Triplex factory. Economy Eccleston is a suburban area with a limited number of shops at Walmesley Road, Mill Brook Lane and Gillars Green Drive. These are mainly local shops including two small supermarkets, four hairdressers, a chemist, a florist and a continental-style coffeehouse. An NHS medical centre is located on the site of the church hall, Chapel Lane. Broadway offers a library, a private day nursery and an NHS dental practice. A private dental practice is situated on Kiln Lane. A number of Mother and Toddler groups take place at St Julie's Parish Hall, the library and the Lester Drive Centre. Eccleston has several pubs including The Seven Stars, The Griffin, The Stanley, The Game Bird (previously The Royal Oak) and The Wellington. All of these public houses serve food. Landmarks The main attraction is The Smithy Heritage Centre on Kiln Lane, which is a museum about the works of a local blacksmith's businesses Eccleston was also home to the St Helens R.F.C. rugby team (known locally as 'The Saints') and St. Helens Town AFC (the town's non-league football side), from 1890 until stadium closure in 2010, when both the teams moved from the Knowsley Road stadium to Langtree Park. The capacity of the Knowsley Road stadium was 19,100 (standing) with 3,000 seats in the main stand. The stadium also boasted a restaurant and a club official store. Eccleston Mere is owned by Pheasant Equities Ltd of Rainford Hall and is jointly supervised by the Pilkington Sailing Club and the Pilkington Angling Association. The mere was originally constructed to hold water to feed through to Pilkington's Watson Street works, but is now used solely for recreational purposes. People and culture A resident of Eccleston is known as an \\"Ecclestonian\\". Accents in Eccleston vary from that of a St Helens accent through to a more well spoken northern English accent. The people of Eccleston are mainly of St Helens origin with family in the area. Eccleston is an area with households mainly comprising families and the elderly. Young people tend to move away and come back later in life to settle down. Religion is still quite vibrant in Eccleston with several churches including St Julie (Roman Catholic), Christ Church (Church of England) and Portico (Roman Catholic). Eccleston Methodist Church closed in May 2006. The former United Reformed Church on Kiln Lane closed in 2005 and the site has now been redeveloped into retirement homes. Ethnicity is approximately 98% British/Irish White. Community activities revolve around church and school festivals and f√™tes. In terms of sport, the area is home to the amateur Rugby League team Eccleston Lions. There are also teams for the youngsters of Eccleston these clubs being Millfields and Bleak Hill.

It consists of a montage of photos and the reading of the eponymous French-language poem written by French-speaking Quebecer Mich√®le Lalonde. The poem had been published in 1974. The text denounces the situation of Quebec francophones in regard to Quebec anglophones. However, English Canada is not the main target of complaint. The text denounces the economic and cultural imperialism of dominant social classes worldwide. In 1964, during the Laurendeau-Dunton Commission, the phrase was described in a private journal by Le Devoir publisher Andr√© Laurendeau as an insult to people heard speaking French. He noted that fellow commissioner Frank Scott, Dean of Law at McGill University, and translator of French poetry to English, was sceptical about its usage, and thought it was an Americanism. Laurendeau speculated that the insult had more to do with xenophobia in general rather than French Canadians in particular.[] In 2005 the phrase was mentioned in a eulogy for Acadian politician Louis Robichaud as having at one time been an insult against those who speak French in New Brunswick.Debates - Issue 29 - February 1, 2005, SENATORS' STATEMENTS The poem was central to Robert Lepage's autobiographical play 887.

Rich Guitars, and his own company Neal Moser Guitars. He began his career with guitars in 1964. He worked in the guitar industry beginning with Vox in 1965, until he went into the Navy in 1966. After finishing his tour in 1969 he worked at West Coast Organ and Amp as a guitar repairman. While there he worked on the instruments of many musicians including guitars belonging to Jimi Hendrix, Stephen Stills, David Crosby, Roger McGuinn (Byrds), Vanilla Fudge. Later he worked for Barney Kessels Music World in Hollywood where Moser continued doing guitar repair. He came to the attention of Bernardo Rico in 1974. At this time he modified his present electronic design to accommodate B.C. Rich guitars. While working as an independent contractor with B.C. Rich, Moser designed the B.C. Rich \\"RICH BICH\\" which became popular and is still being built. \\"I feel fortunate to have worked with Bernie Rico, Wayne Charvel, and a host of other talented luthiers and players\\". Shortly after leaving B.C. Rich he designed what is now known as the Virgin Guitar for Class Axe in New Jersey, who had acquired B.C. Rich by this time. After leaving B.C. Rich in 1985, Moser met Lee Garver and agreed to join forces with Garver. Garver owns GMW Guitar Works. The GMW stands for Garver, Moser and Wizard. GMW is noted for guitars which are handmade and hand-painted. For over 10 years Moser, Garver and Dan created Moser Guitars which were shown at the NAMM Show in Los Angeles from 1986 to 1998. At that time Moser retired. He came out of retirement in 2002 to help start the Moser Custom Shop, owned by Earlleen Lloyd. Moser Custom Shop built guitars designed by Moser, Rodney McGlothlin, Dan Fastuca, Ken Patin (formerly of Yavcon Guitars) and a number of other individual designers.

They are found from Mexico to South America and also in the Caribbean. Primarily not migratory, masked ducks are reported as very uncommon vagrants in the southernmost United States, along the Mexican border and in Florida. As of 2000, the conservation status for masked ducks in Texas is 3,800 birds. On April 1, 1962, it was recorded from Lowndes County, Georgia, where it was photographed by Alexander Wetmore. The only member of the genus Nomonyx, it is intermediate between the rather primitive black- headed duck (Heteronetta) and the very apomorphic true stiff-tailed ducks. It is sometimes included with the latter in the genus Oxyura, but apparently the masked ducks now are the descendants of a missing link in the Oxyurini evolution, having changed but little for millions of years. Breeding adult males have a rust-colored body with a black face and mottled wings. Adult females, winter males, and juveniles have a barred brownish gray body, with two horizontal, dark-colored stripes running through the buff-colored face. These ducks mainly feed on seeds, roots, and leaves of aquatic plants. They also eat aquatic insects and crustaceans. They feed by diving. Masked ducks breed in any freshwater body with marsh vegetation and surrounded by heavy tree cover. They also occur in mangrove swamps. These ducks are usually very secretive, but they are not rare and not considered threatened by the IUCN. References Further reading *del Hoyo, Josep; Elliott, Andrew & Sargatal, Jordi (eds.)

After making a name for himself in his country and in Italy with Cagliari, he spent the following seven years of his career in Spain ‚Äì scoring 48 La Liga goals in 163 games, mostly for M√°laga ‚Äì before moving to England. He suffered a serious car accident shortly after leaving Portsmouth, which caused him to lose a leg and effectively end his career. Amongst other tournaments, Silva represented Uruguay at the 2002 World Cup, winning nearly 50 caps. Club career =Pe√±arol / Cagliari= Born in Treinta y Tres in the namesake department, Silva began his career in 1991 with Defensor Sporting (having being a Boca Juniors player for six hours previous to that), signing shortly after with Montevideo and Primera Divisi√≥n powerhouse Pe√±arol; In 1995, aged 22, he switched to Italy and signed with Cagliari Calcio, where he was nicknamed Sa pibinca (Sardinian for nuisance) due to his frenzied attacking style. In his last season he helped the club return to Serie A, posting his best individual record with 13 goals; during his three-year spell, he also briefly returned to Pe√±arol on loan. =Spain / Portsmouth= Silva then moved to Spain, where he would remain for nearly one full decade. He started at RCD Espanyol where he failed to impress, and signed for M√°laga CF in 1999. With the Andalusians he formed an efficient attacking partnership with Julio Dely Vald√©s, also helping to the conquest of the 2002 UEFA Intertoto Cup and consecutive mid-table La Liga finishes; during his tenure with the club, the temperamental player was also sent off six times. In 2003, aged nearly 31, Silva joined M√°laga neighbours Sevilla FC. Two years later, as the club purchased Lu√≠s Fabiano, Fr√©d√©ric Kanout√© and Javier Saviola, he was deemed surplus to requirements by manager Joaqu√≠n Caparr√≥s and cancelled the last year of his contract, joining Premier League side Portsmouth on a free transfer. At Pompey, Silva failed to make an impact after suffering an ankle injury and, after scoring just three goals in 15 appearances, he was released from his contract on 13 February 2006. He found the net against Charlton Athletic, Sunderland and Ipswich Town, the latter in the third round of the FA Cup. =Car crash= On 23 September 2006, Silva was seriously injured in a car crash in Montevideo. The accident occurred when he lost control of his pick-up truck and was thrown from the vehicle, colliding with a lamppost. In the impact, the 33-year-old Silva fractured his skull, being rendered unconscious and suffering a compound fracture on his right leg. At the time of the crash, he was traveling with two other ex-footballers, Elbio Papa and Dardo Pereira, who were not seriously injured. On the day of the accident, a team of five made the decision to amputate Silva's leg below the knee, and he underwent an operation which lasted for three and a half hours. He was put into a medically induced coma for the amputation. After the operation, there were fears that the amputation would become infected. However, his condition was declared stable a few days later as he recovered at Montevideo's La Espa√±ola hospital, whose staff expected him to make a full recovery. After difficulty with coming to terms with the amputation, Silva left the hospital on 5 October 2006, and returned to his home in Montevideo with the plan of receiving a prosthetic leg in Italy to help him walk and run without the aid of crutches. International career Silva made his debut for Uruguay on 19 October 1994, in a friendly match against Peru in the Estadio Nacional Jos√© D√≠az in Lima (1‚Äì0 win). He appeared for the national team at the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup, the 2002 FIFA World Cup ‚Äì no goals in three matches in an eventual group stage exit‚Äì and the 2004 Copa Am√©rica. Silva retired from international play after Uruguay failed to qualify to the 2006 World Cup in Germany, having played 49 times and scored 14 goals. After retirement In October 2006, news reports suggested that Silva was offered a job as a football pundit in his country. He had also expressed a desire to become a manager shortly before retiring, but later changed his mind. He took the pitch again on 13 January 2009 after a three-year absence, taking part in a charity match between Uruguay XI and Argentina XI for the ‚ÄúFundaci√≥n Ni√±os con Alas‚Äù (Winged Children Foundation), again displaying his scoring touch after converting a penalty kick. Afterwards, Silva was involved in breeding of racing horses, also recommending the animal for therapeutic purposes. In May 2019, rumours circulated that he was broke and working as a waiter in a pizzeria in M√°laga; shortly after, he denied this and stated he was only a friend of the person who ran the business.

History The song initially sings of the rhythm and blues singer Johnny Ace, who is said to have shot himself in a game of Russian roulette in 1954 (eyewitness accounts say otherwise). Simon goes on to reference former Beatle John Lennon, who was murdered on December 8, 1980, as well as referencing John F. Kennedy who was assassinated in 1963. The following year Beatlemania started (Simon was living in London at the time), and in the song's lyrics, Simon refers to both the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. In an interview for a Cinemax special promoting Hearts and Bones, Simon said that Ace's death was the \\"first violent death that I remember\\", and noted that Kennedy and Lennon became the \\"Johnny Aces\\" of their time with their subsequent murders. The album version features a one-minute coda composed by Philip Glass, performed with strings, clarinet, and flute; the aria resembles Glass's own \\"Pruit Igoe\\" from Koyaanisqatsi. This reflects the sad mood of the song. Marin Alsop, the violinist on that session, was later to become the conductor of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. The 2004 reissue of Hearts and Bones also contains a solo acoustic demo of the song. However, there is an error in the third stanza of the mention of the year at the time of recording. Simon mistakenly mentioned \\"1956\\" instead of \\"1954\\" corresponds to the year of Johnny Ace's death. Live performances The song was first performed live by Paul Simon during the Simon & Garfunkel reunion concert in Central Park in September 1981. Near the end of the performance (possibly in response to Simon mentioning John Lennon's death less than a year before, and enjoying Lennon's music with an anonymous stranger who'd told him the singer had died), an audience member rushed the stage, causing Simon to pull away from the microphone. The man was quickly pulled away by security and was heard yelling \\"I gotta talk to you, I gotta talk to you.\\" Simon was clearly shaken‚Äîespecially as the lyrics deal with assassinations‚Äîbut he continued the song without a break. The performance was included in the subsequent video and DVD releases of the concert but was omitted from the live album. Simon also performed the song several times during Simon & Garfunkel's subsequent 1983 tour. In an interview on Late Night with David Letterman on May 20, 1982, Simon discussed the Central Park experience with David Letterman. When asked to sing the song and using a spontaneously loaned guitar, Simon performed the song from his chair instead of taking the stage. Halfway through, Simon stopped the song when one of the strings on the guitar got caught by a fret and almost broke, and the host quickly took the show to commercial. Simon jokingly observed that he had to stop the song almost at the exact same point after the Central Park incident and said he doubted whether he should ever do the song again. However, he ended up finishing the song when the show returned from commercial. Simon performed the song again on Saturday Night Live on November 22, 1986, the 23rd anniversary of the JFK assassination (the performance opened with a still shot of JFK to mark the occasion.) He also performed the song in 2000 in Paris for a filmed concert to promote his album You're the One. Simon first performed the Johnny Ace classic \\"Pledging My Love\\" before launching into his song.

It lies on the southwest of the island group of Cyclades, near the bigger island of Milos. Kimolos is the administrative center of the municipality of Kimolos, which also includes the uninhabited islands of Polyaigos, Agios Efstathios and Agios Georgios. The island has a land area of , while the municipality's land area is , and it reported a population of 910 inhabitants in the 2011 census. History Kimolos is an island with rich history records. According to tradition, it is named after Kimolos, the very first resident of the island. Echinousa is also a recorded name of the island during the ancient times, probably because of the snake Echidna (viper), being common even today on the island. Since the ancient era, it has been a battlefield between Ancient Athens, the ruler of the island, and Sparta, the ruler of Milos. In the Middle Ages it was known as Argentiera (), because of the silver-colored rocky lands of its southern coast. Since those times, these rocky lands provided Kimolia Gi-Kimolian Earth, a valuable trade good, which made the island a major trade hub. It was ruled by the Ottoman Empire until 1829, when it was annexed by the Greek state along with the rest of the Cyclades. Inside the medieval castle Geography Kimolos lies to the northwest of larger Milos island, separated from it by a 1 km wide channel. It is round-shaped, approximately 7 km in radius. The island has a total area of . The highest point is mount Paleokastro, at The only town is Chorio, located on a hill on the west of the island. There are also smaller settlements of Psathi (port), Goupa, Kara, Prasa, Aliki, Bonatsa and Dekas. To the east of Kimolos lies the island of Polyaigos, half its size. Polyaigos is the largest uninhabited island of Aegean. It is also part of the municipality of Kimolos. Geology Kimolos, Milos and the smaller islands that surround them belong to the Aegean volcanic arc and consist mainly of acidic volcanic rocks. In some places, the pre-volcanic bedrock can be observed. Large areas of Kimolos are covered by tuffs and the volcanic activity can be obvious from the hot springs, existence of a notable geothermal field, the characteristic landscape and strange landforms. The island is also rich in minerals of the silica group and in significant industrial minerals. One of the most famous geologic formations on Kimolos is Skiadi. Skiadi is a huge mushroom-shaped stone that dominates the middle of a small valley in the interior of the island. It is created by a process called ablation, in which the dust carried by the wind continuously scratches the rock, eroding the softer layers at the bottom much more than the harder layers at the top. Through centuries, the stone has been shaped into a characteristic, unique form. Residents According to the last censuses, the population of Kimolos is decreasing, and no more than 600 residents (mostly elderly) remain during winter. The underage population is no more than 100, according to the school records. Most of the working population is involved with the tourist industry of the island (hotels, restaurants) in combination with agriculture activities, mainly during winter. Local government After the municipal/prefectural elections held in October 2006, the mayor of the island for the period 2007-2010 was Theodoros-Gerasimos Maganiotis, who also publishes the only newspaper of the island, Kimoliaka Nea (Kimolian News). However, the current mayor of Kimolos is Ventouris Emanuel Konstantinos. Kimolos has a local Police Department. The Kimolos Port Authority is a department of Milos Coast Guard. Kimolos is part of the Milos regional unit. Transportation ;Internal: On the island all vehicles are permitted, but during the summer months, the lack of parking space is the most important problem in populated areas, such as Chorio Kimolou and Psathi. Common kinds of fuels are available at the local fuel station. There are also public means of transport, such as bus and taxi, performing routes to popular beaches. ;External: Kimolos belongs to the line of the Western Cyclades and it's connected to nearby islands and Piraeus port of Athens via year-round ferry boat and a catamaran ferry running only during the tourist season. Routes frequency varies with the season. During the tourist period, it usually has daily connection to Piraeus and other islands. Also, transport via Milos is possible, because of the frequent connection of the two islands with local ferry boat. Finally, Kimolos is a station for the local connections between Cyclades islands.

He was connected with Epaminondas by political ties and ties of friendship. When Philip, the future king of Macedonia, was sent as a hostage to Thebes, he was placed under the care of Pammenes. In 369 BC, when Megalopolis was founded, there was a concern that the Spartans would attack those engaged in establishing the community, Epaminondas sent Pammenes at the head of 1000 specially picked soldiers to defend the community. In 362 BC, some of Megalopolitan colonists were in favour of dissolving the community, and returning to their own lands, and called upon the Mantineans and other Peloponnesians, for aid. The Megalopolitan settlers who opposed the dissolution of their community called for help to the Thebans, who sent Pammenes with 3000 foot soldiers and 300 cavalry to their assistance. With this force Pammenes overcame all resistance, and compelled those who had left Megalopolis to return. When Artabazus revolted in 356 BC against Artaxerxes III, king of Persia, Pammenes led 5000 Thebans to the aid of Artabazus, and overcame the forces of the king in two great battles. But Artabazus, suspecting that Pammenes was intriguing with his enemies, arrested him, and handed him over to his brothers, Oxythras and Dibictus. Pammenes is spoken of as being greatly addicted to paiderastia. It is difficult to say what degree of credit should be attached to the story, that, while Philip was under the charge of Pammenes, he maintained a homosexual relationship with the young prince.

The characteristic sound of the jug is low and hoarse, below the higher pitch of the fiddle, harmonica, and the other instruments in the band.smithsonianfolkways: The Jug Bands Compiled and edited by Samuel Charters Performance With an embouchure like that used for a brass instrument, the musician holds the mouth of the jug about an inch from their mouth and emits a blast of sound, made by a buzzing of the lips, directly into it. The jug does not touch the musician's mouth, but serves as a resonating chamber to amplify and enrich the sound made by the musician's lips. Changes in pitch are controlled by loosening or tightening the lips. An accomplished jug player might have a two-octave range. Some players augment this sound with vocalizations, didgeridoo style, and even circular breathing. In performance, the jug sound is enhanced if the player stands with his back to a wall, which will reflect the sound towards the audience. The stovepipe (usually a section of tin pipe, 3\\" or 4\\"/75 or 100 mm in diameter) is played in much the same manner, with the open-ended pipe being the resonating chamber. There is some similarity to the didgeridoo, but there is no contact between the stovepipe and the player's lips. As a bass instrument, the jug is part of the band's rhythm section, but jug solos are common. Most jug bands use a single jug player, but there are recordings of period bands that used jug sections of two or more players.Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World Part 1 Performance and Production, Volume 2, p. 36 by John Shepherd and David Horn, Bloomsbury Academic, May 10, 2012, Jugs will also produce sound at their main resonance frequency when air is blown across the top opening. This method is not used in bands, since it is relatively quiet and produces only a single pitch. It is typically used for making glass bottles whistle. A larger bottle produces a lower musical pitch while smaller ones produce higher pitches. The pitch of a bottle played in this way may be controlled by changing its volume by adding or emptying contents. Loudness is a function of the speed of the air blown across the top. History The jug as a musical instrument reached its height of popularity in the 1920s, when jug bands, such as Cannon's Jug Stompers flourished.Cannon's Jug Stompers Jug Band Hall of Fame The jug was also popular because it was cheap and easy to carry around. In addition to the most common ceramic jug, containers of many different materials have been used for musical jugs, e.g. glass jugs and bottles, plastic bleach bottles, tin kerosene cans, etc. Different materials produce different sounds, as do different sizes. The jug is primarily an acoustic instrument, although amplified and \\"electric jugs\\" appear from time to time, and have even been used in recordings, such as by Tommy Hall in the 1960s psychedelic band 13th Floor Elevators. A version of the jug, known as the botija, was played in early Cuban musical forms such as the son. In recent times, Fritz Richmond (1939‚Äì2005) was a well-known and successful jug player, and his work, found on numerous commercial recordings, provides excellent examples of jug playing. Josh Smith, (1979-now) of the Glade City Rounders, is one of the most famous jug players touring and playing live. He is said to possibly be one of the best on the scene by some jug band scholars.

It was notable for its unconventional design characteristics, being a twin-engine tailless design of pusher configuration. Design and development The Manx (named after a well- known breed of stub-tailed housecat)Brookes 2011, p. 6 was built to participate in a flight research program investigating problems associated with tailless aircraft. The partially-swept wings supported the vertical stabilizers of a twin tail, with elevons for pitch and roll control. Construction of the prototype was subcontracted to Dart Aircraft of Dunstable.Barnes 1980, pp.5‚Äì6. There were serious issues encountered early in the development phase that caused a delay in the testing program. After it was delivered in 1939, redesigns had to be made because the Manx was too heavy, and there were also structural integrity issues with the main spar. An unorthodox aspect of the Manx design incorporated into the aircraft was that the main undercarriage was retractable, while the nose gear remained fixed. Taxi tests began in early 1940, but inspection revealed serious deterioration of the wing structures, which required extensive repair.Barnes 1980, p.7. These and further problems delayed the maiden flight until June 1943 (sources conflict as to whether it was 11 or 25 June.) The first flight was terminated early when the canopy was lost in mid-flight, but the pilot managed to land the plane safely. In December 1945 the Manx's regular crew were killed flying the Handley Page Hermes prototype. The Manx had accumulated only about 17 hours of flight time over approximately 30 flights when flight tests were finally terminated in April 1946. The sole example built was scrapped in 1952.

This allowed laws to be made swiftly and efficiently, as it was directly responsible to the Secretary of State for the Colonies in London, instead of being placed under a legislative hierarchy and answering to the Calcutta government based in India. Letters patent granted a colonial constitution on 4 February, which allocated much power to the Governor. He was assisted by an Executive Council and Legislative Council, the latter of which was entrusted with lawmaking in the colony, although the governor had a casting vote and the power of assent and veto on all legislation. Organisation The Legislative Council was made of members in the Executive Council, the Chief Justice, and non-official members nominated by the Governor. These nominated members were intended to better represent the local people, including in its ranks Asian members. Consisting mostly of wealthy Asian business and professional leaders, they did not necessarily represent the collective will of the people, however. Beginning with just four members, it grew over the years, with Singaporean members increasingly dominating the council to the displeasure of politicians from Malacca and Penang. Despite obvious control by British subjects of European descent, there was little opposition towards the system from the local Asian population, mainly attributed to apathy. There were a few exceptions. Tan Cheng Lock, a member of the Executive Council who had previously opposed several decisions made by the Legislative Council (such as the Aliens Ordinance of 1933 which restricted immigration) as anti-Chinese, called for popular representation through direct election, and for the number of non-official members to be increased to a majority of the Legislative Council. Initiatives like these were unsuccessful, as there was little support from a society widely apathetic to local politics, with the Chinese population paying more attention towards growing their commercial and professional interests and in events which were occurring in China, fuelled largely by the rise in Chinese nationalist sentiments. Dissolution After the World War II, the Repeal Act of 1946 dissolved the Straits Settlements, with Singapore becoming a Crown colony in its own right, while Penang and Malacca became part of the Malayan Union. With Singapore left on its own, the council became the legislature of its colonial government and was renamed the Legislative Council of Singapore.

In effect it says precisely which complex manifolds are defined by homogeneous polynomials. Kunihiko Kodaira's result is that for a compact K√§hler manifold M, with a Hodge metric, meaning that the cohomology class in degree 2 defined by the K√§hler form œâ is an integral cohomology class, there is a complex-analytic embedding of M into complex projective space of some high enough dimension N. The fact that M embeds as an algebraic variety follows from its compactness by Chow's theorem. A K√§hler manifold with a Hodge metric is occasionally called a Hodge manifold (named after W. V. D. Hodge), so Kodaira's results states that Hodge manifolds are projective. The converse that projective manifolds are Hodge manifolds is more elementary and was already known. Kodaira also proved (Kodaira 1963), by recourse to the classification of compact complex surfaces, that every compact K√§hler surface is a deformation of a projective K√§hler surface. This was later simplified by Buchdahl to remove reliance on the classification (Buchdahl 2008). Kodaira embedding theorem Let X be a compact K√§hler manifold, and L a holomorphic line bundle on X. Then L is a positive line bundle if and only if there is a holomorphic embedding \\\\varphi:X\\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb P of X into some projective space such that \\\\varphi^*\\\\mathcal O_{\\\\mathbb P}(1)=L^{\\\\otimes m} for some m > 0\\\\.

It was patented in 1961 and came into medical use in 1966. Function Bromhexine is intended to support the body's mechanisms for clearing mucus from the respiratory tract. It is secretolytic, increasing the production of serous mucus in the respiratory tract, which makes the phlegm thinner and less viscous. This contributes to a secretomotoric effect, allowing the cilia to more easily transport the phlegm out of the lungs. For this reason it is often added to cough syrups. It has been shown to increase the proportion of serous bronchial secretion, making it more easily expectorated. It is indicated as \\"secretolytic therapy in bronchopulmonary diseases associated with abnormal mucus secretion and impaired mucus transport\\". Bromhexine is contained in various formulations, high and low strength syrups 8 mg/5 ml, 4 mg/5 ml, tablets and soluble tablets (both with 8 mg bromhexine) and solution for oral use 10 mg/5 ml, adapted to the need of the patients.

He was in the cult-band Samson, with whom his name is most associated. In 1979, he developed his persona modelled on horror icons such as The Rocky Horror Show, Dr. Phibes and the old Hammer horror films, alternatively wearing black and white make-up, an old man/schoolteacher mask, a black cotton mask and his trademarked rhinestone covered mirrorball mask. He played inside a cage, including during a brief Samson reunion in 2000. With Samson he enjoyed a certain degree of success, especially when their album Head On was released in 1980 and reached No. 34 in the UK Albums Chart. The following single \\"Riding With The Angels\\", from the album Shock Tactics, charted in the UK Singles Chart at No. 54. In a rare occurrence his face was seen when he performed the main-role in the b-movie Biceps of Steel, featuring his band at the time Samson. In the film his then brother-in-law Ben K. Reeves performed as Thunderstick in his stead, only for the shots where Purkis and Thunderstick were set to appear at the same time. In the June 2005 issue of Classic Rock Magazine, Thunderstick was listed as no. 36 in the \\"50 Greatest Drummers in Rock\\" feature. Early days and Iron Maiden In 1973-74 Purkis played with precursors-of-punk band Tiny and the Hot Toddies (THT), who played mainly around London's West End. THT split in 1974 when Purkis and THT's lead guitarist went to Italy to play semi-professionally with the English band The Primitives (also known as \\"Mal Ryder & The Primitives\\" - not to be confused with the eighties UK band) in 1974. They extensively toured in south Italy. Purkins then became a drummer for the English band Iron Maiden in 1977-1978, long time before he would create his masked persona. During his early Samson tenure, Purkis was also asked to rejoin Iron Maiden in 1980 after the band had been touring with Samson but declined in favour of staying with Samson. This was mainly because his bizarre theatrical image had gained recognition, and he was then seen to be \\"the face of the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal\\". His Samson predecessor Clive Burr eventually took the Maiden position. Self- named band and beyond After he left Samson for artistic divergences, Thunderstick then went on to form his own eponymous band called Thunderstick consisting of two guitarists, bass and female vocalist. They recorded two hard rock albums, the EP Feel like Rock 'n' Roll? (1983) and a full feature LP Beauty and the Beasts (1984) via Magnum/Thunderbolt Records. These have been restored and remastered for a 2011 CD release, an anthology called Echoes from the Analogue Asylum which also features previously-unreleased material. The band disbanded in 1986, after having recorded their yet-to-be-released final album Don't Touch, I'll Scream. Both Thunderstick and vocalist Jodee Valentine went to the United States to try to secure a new deal. A new American line-up was considered, but was soon abandoned in favour of maintaining their identity within the NWOBHM scene. Both returned to the UK. A fifth incarnation emerged in 1988, secured by a high-profile management contract, but Thunderstick disbanded again after failing to sign a major deal with a label. As Barry Purkis, in the late 1980s he worked with Bernie Torm√© and the Electric Gypsies, and other artists. He performed as Thunderstick again in a series of Paul Samson solo gigs in America along with bassist Eric Mauriello, in 1989. Ace Frehely jammed with them during an encore at the New York Roxy. Thunderstick rejoined Samson twice, once in 1990 to write and record new material (later issued on 1999's Past Present & Future) and then again in 1999-2000, for reunion gigs either in Japan and on the Wacken Festival set in Germany. His songwriting input is present on Paul Samson's posthumous solo album P.S... 1953-2002 originally scheduled to be Samson's new album with the title of \\"Brand New Day\\". Purkis still writes music, and is involved in production for other artists. On 25 April 2009, he played at the Keep It True Festival in Germany with a reunion of various new wave of British heavy metal artists, marking the return of his Thunderstick persona. On the 22 April 2016, former lead vocalist Jodee Valentine died aged 56. Following Valentine's death, Purkis decided to bring back his beloved Thunderstick. The band has reformed with a new line-up, and a new album, Something Wicked This Way Comes, was released in July 2017.

Rado, Dalla republica fiorentina alla signoria Medicea: Maso degli Albizzi e il partito oligarchico in Firenze dal 1382 al 1393, 1926 The most infamous and influential members of the family were Maso and his son Rinaldo degli Albizzi (1370‚Äì1442) who countered the rise of Cosimo de' Medici, exiling him in 1433.

Moreover, in 1442, Luca Albizzi actually became the Gonfalonier of Justice and stayed a key ally of Cosimo during this time.

Glasgow's City Halls and Old Fruitmarket is a concert hall and former market located on Candleriggs, in the Merchant City, Glasgow, Scotland. History The City Halls are part of a market complex designed by John Carrick in 1882, but the grand hall itself was designed by George Murray and opened in 1841. It was the first hall suitable for large gatherings and concerts to be built in the City and played host to the likes of Benjamin Disraeli, Charles Dickens, Hungarian patriot Lajos Kossuth and William Ewart Gladstone. From its early days it hosted a wide variety of popular and classical concerts including those by touring groups such as Louis-Antoine Jullien's celebrated London-based orchestra and Charles Halle's orchestra from Manchester. Glasgow's first regular orchestral subscription concert series, played by an orchestra managed by the Glasgow Choral Union, was given in the grand hall from 1874 until the opening of the much larger St Andrew's Hall in 1877. Arthur Sullivan was its conductor for two seasons from 1875-77. The Old Fruitmarket directly adjoins the grand hall and was a functioning market until the 1970s after which it was in occasional use for jazz and folk music events. The adjoining buildings were home to bustling produce markets such as the fresh fruit and flower market and the cheese market. In the past it featured concerts by the Scottish Chamber Orchestra and the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra. For a number of years, after the destruction by fire of the St Andrews Hall in 1962, it was used for concerts by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, until the opening of Glasgow Royal Concert Hall in 1990. It has also been a venue for many of Glasgow's Festivals, including Celtic Connections, Mayfest and the Jazz Festival, as well as political and trade union gatherings. It has been protected as a category A listed building since 1970. Concert hall The City Halls and Old Fruitmarket re-opened in January 2006 after undergoing a period of extensive renovation.Renovation of the City Halls, The Scotsman The refurbished halls are now the home of the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra and the Scottish Music Centre, both members of a partnership with the City Council and Glasgow Cultural Enterprises. The hall is also the regular performance space for the Scottish Chamber Orchestra in Glasgow and is a centre for music education with the city's Education Department as a key participant. The venue consists of several performance venues under one roof, managed by Glasgow Cultural Enterprises (which also manages The Glasgow Royal Concert Hall): #The \\"Grand Hall\\", or main City Hall auditorium, which is a traditional \\"shoebox\\"-shaped hall with very fine acoustics seating 1066 in total. This is the home of the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra (SSO) which rehearses, records and performs here. The stage can accommodate an orchestra of over 90 and there are choir seats for 110. The hall is also used regularly by the (Edinburgh- based) Scottish Chamber Orchestra for its Glasgow concerts and by the Scottish Ensemble, among others. #The Recital Room, a new space suitable for chamber music, seating around 100. #The Old Fruitmarket, an atmospheric venue still retaining its market hall character with a flexible capacity of 1000-2000. This is used for jazz and traditional music events, and also by the BBC SSO for more experimental contemporary music events. The City Halls also houses the Scottish Music Centre, offices and recording facilities for the BBC SSO, and extensive music education facilities.

From the entrance at the corner of Bowen Ave and Kitchener St, sealed footpaths climb steeply through native trees to the large flat area at the summit, where a formal layout of paths and flower gardens encircle a fountain. History Albert Park occupies much of the site of the Albert Barracks, one of Auckland's early European military fortifications, which in turn was built on the previous site of Te Horotiu pa. The barracks consisted of a number of wooden and masonry structures standing in an enclosed area surrounded by a rock fortification built of the local volcanic stone. A portion of this wall remains visible in the adjacent University of Auckland grounds, and is registered by Heritage New Zealand as a Category I historic place. The Park was laid out in the 1880s and originally had commanding views over the city and harbour. The view now is of modern office blocks, except where mature trees have hidden the buildings. The Park contains a number of interesting specimen trees dating from the 1880s to the first World War. A caretaker's residence was provided which still stands on the eastern side of the part adjacent to Princes Street. After 1906 this Gothic-styled cottage was occupied by the City Park Superintendent Thomas Pearson, who died here in 1931. It is currently empty. Features The statue of Queen Victoria The design of the park was the result of a public competition and follows a formal layout with a main north-south axis. To the north of the axis is a bronze statue by Francis J Williamson of Queen Victoria (1897); to the south is a bandstand (James Slator 1901). Between them is a large cast iron fountain imported from Great Britain in 1881 which forms the centrepiece of the park. The fountain is distinguished by statues of dolphins ridden by cherubs blowing horns that spout water. The fountain is surmounted by a generic female figure that also has a horn spouting water. The statue of Queen Victoria was one of several similar sculptures installed by municipal authorities throughout the British Empire following the monarch's Diamond Jubilee in 1897. This sculpture was cast in London and unveiled with considerable ceremony here as part of the Jubilee celebrations. The red granite pedestal is intact but the ensemble originally included a massive cast iron ornamental fence that has been removed. There are several other artworks and memorials in the park, including a marble Boer War memorial, and an over life-size marble statue also by F J Williamson of Sir George Grey (1904) that was relocated here from its original site outside the Auckland Town Hall. There are two Edwardian marble edifices near the band rotunda, one being Andrea Carlo Lucchesi's Love breaking the sword of hate (1900) and the other a memorial drinking fountain. Many of these memorials and artworks can be seen in the numerous images of Albert Park printed as postcards since the early 20th century.See the compilation of images by Jeff Pyle Near the flagpole and Boer War Memorial on the north side of the park are two large field guns that were once part of the defense system set up during the Russian Invasion Scare of the 1880s. Near the Princes Street exit in front of the University of Auckland clock tower is a large floral clock that was constructed in 1953 with funds donated by Robert Laidlaw, founder of the Farmers department store chain, (this was intended to commemorate the 1953 visit of Queen Elizabeth the Second). Near the Art Gallery is a large modern sculpture from the 1990s called 'Tilt'. Surprisingly an operating Victorian Gas Lamp survives in the Park, on the stairs leading from Kitchener Street. Beneath the park are the extensive Albert Park tunnels. They were built in 1941 to be used as air raid shelters, but were decommissioned and sealed up before World War II ended. The tunnels were largely forgotten for many years and, although periodically over the last decades there are calls for them to be opened up, nothing has happened (probably purely for logistical reasons). There were large tunnel entrances at the top of Victoria street, adjacent to the Art Gallery on Wellesley Street and from Constitution Hill. One can still be seen on Kitchener Street between Courthouse and Bacons Lane. Geography Albert Park lies beside the site of one of the earliest volcanoes in the Auckland volcanic field, which erupted beneath the current Victoria Street carparks and the 'Metropolis' hotel/apartments entrance building (the former Auckland District Court). While primarily a very small scoria cone, it also sent a lava flow into the Queen Street valley, and coated the pre-existing sandstone Albert Park ridge with ash (Albert Park is not itself the location of a volcano). The lava flow partially dammed the stream running down the Queen Street valley creating a swamp upstream. This flat sector of the valley can now be recognised between Wellesley and Victoria Streets. The stream was known as Waihorotiu (meaning - Waters of the crumbling rocks) indicative of the land subsidence which partly blocked the Queen Street valley, creating a swampy area which is now Aotea Square. The diminutive scoria cone was substantially quarried away for roading and building material during the establishment of the city in the late 19th century, although a slight rise in Kitchener Street adjacent the carparks remains as the only physical remnant now visible.

It can be classified as either a methyl-pentose or a 6-deoxy-hexose. Rhamnose occurs in nature in its L-form as L-rhamnose (6-deoxy-L-mannose). This is unusual, since most of the naturally occurring sugars are in D-form. Exceptions are the methyl pentoses L-fucose and L-rhamnose and the pentose L-arabinose. Rhamnose can be isolated from Buckthorn (Rhamnus), poison sumac, and plants in the genus Uncaria. Rhamnose is also produced by microalgae belonging to class Bacillariophyceae (diatoms). Rhamnose is commonly bound to other sugars in nature. It is a common glycone component of glycosides from many plants. Rhamnose is also a component of the outer cell membrane of acid-fast bacteria in the Mycobacterium genus, which includes the organism that causes tuberculosis. An interesting particularity of rhamnose is the absence of formaldehyde production when reacted with periodates in the vicinal diol cleavage reaction, that makes it very useful to remove excess periodate in glycerol or other vicinal diol analysis, that would otherwise give colored blank issues.

In British English, jugs are pouring vessels for holding drinkable liquids, whether beer, water or soft drinks; types of packaging for milk etc are not called jugs. In North American English these table jugs are usually called pitchers. Ewer is an older word for jugs or pitchers, and there are several others. Several other types of containers are also called jugs, depending on locale, tradition, and personal preference. Some types of bottles can be called jugs, particularly if the container has a narrow mouth and has a handle. Closures such as stoppers or screw caps are common for these retail packages. Etymology The word jug is first recorded in the late 15th century as jugge or jubbe. It is of unknown origin, but perhaps comes from jug a term for a maidservant, in the same period. This in turn comes from the alteration of common personal names such as Joan or Judith.  Beer jug  In certain countries, especially New Zealand and Australia, a \\"jug\\" refers to a plastic container filled with two pints (just over a litre) of beer. It is usually served along with one or more small glasses from which the beer is normally consumed, although in some student bars it is more common for the beer to be drunk directly from the jug, which is usually served without the accompanying glass. (In the U.S., this may be called a pitcher‚Äîalthough few US pitchers are as small as a litre, generally holding between 64 and 128 U.S. fluid ounces, approximately 2-4 litres. In New Zealand and Australia a pitcher sometimes can refer to a much larger measure of beer.)Drink : Australian Beer Sizes Our Naked Australia, May 6, 2013 In Britain in those parts of the county where there is a choice between a pint (20 fluid ounces) tankard and a straight glass of beer, a tankard may be called a tankard or a \\"jug\\". A jug of beer may also refer to a jug containing larger amounts (usually sized in pints), but if a large jug is sold it will be advertised as such in the pub and this helps to reduce confusion.  Juglet  A juglet is an ancient container for liquids, similar to but smaller than modern-day jugs. As a musical instrument In American folk music, an empty jug (often stoneware used for American whiskey) is sometimes used as a musical instrument, being played with buzzed lips to produce a trombone-like tone. It's often part of a jug band, to which ensemble it lends its name. Examples A variety of containers are sometimes called ‚Äújugs‚Äù.

Such requirements are usually stated only informally; and they are often controversial (i.e. management wants a secure system but staff desires user- friendliness). They are also often difficult to validate. Why soft? Normally a goal is a very strict and clear logical criterion. It is satisfied when all sub-goals are satisfied. But in non-functional requirements you often need more loosely defined criteria, like satisficeable or unsatisficeable. The term satisficing was first coined by Herbert Simon. Soft goals are goals that do not have a clear-cut criterion for their satisfaction: they are satisficed when there is sufficient positive and little negative evidence for this claim, while they are unsatisficeable in the opposite case.

It illustrates what he saw as the problem of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, applied to everyday objects. The thought experiment presents a cat that might be alive or dead, depending on an earlier random event. In the course of developing this experiment, he coined the term Verschr√§nkung (entanglement).E. Schr√∂dinger, Die gegenw√§rtige Situation in der Quantenmechanik, Naturwissenschaftern. 23: pp. 807‚Äì812; 823‚Äì823, 844‚Äì849. (1935). English translation: John D. Trimmer, Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society 124, pp. 323‚Äì38 (1980), reprinted in Quantum Theory and Measurement, p. 152 (1983). Literature This artwork by F. Gwynplaine MacIntyre, originally published in Analog magazine, illustrates MacIntyre's science- fiction story \\"Schr√∂dinger's Cat-Sitter\\". The cat occupies a quantum superposition relative to the tined object, being simultaneously in front of and behind the object, which itself occupies a quantum superposition because it is simultaneously a square-edged object with two tines and a round-edged object with three tines. It was not long before science-fiction writers picked up this evocative concept, often using it in a humorous vein. Several have taken the thought experiment a step further, pointing out extra complications that could arise should the experiment actually be performed. For example, in his novel American Gods, Neil Gaiman has a character observe, \\"if they don't ever open the box to feed it, it'll eventually just be two different kinds of dead.\\" Likewise, Terry Pratchett's Lords and Ladies adds the issue of a third possible state, in the case of Greebo, \\"Bloody Furious\\". (In Pratchett's later novel The Last Hero, Death attempts the experiment himself, but cannot understand the mechanics of it, wondering if it implies that he will kill the cat just by looking at it.) In Will Grayson, Will Grayson, by John Green and David Levithan, the Cat makes an appearance as an analogy for Will and Jane's relationship. Robert Anton Wilson wrote a trilogy of novels dealing with themes related to quantum mechanics, collectively known as the Schr√∂dinger's Cat Trilogy. Douglas Adams describes an attempt to enact the experiment in Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency. By using clairvoyance to see inside the box, it was found that the cat was neither alive nor dead, but missing, and Dirk's services were employed in order to recover it, Dirk deducing that the cat had simply grown tired of being subjected to the experiment and wandered off (although he admits later that he was actually using the experiment as an attempt to determine the mental state of his friend Richard Macduff, Richard's logical arguments about why the experiment was pointless confirmed that he was mentally stable). In Libba Bray's book Going Bovine, three stoners argue whether the cat is alive or dead, or whether the person who opens the box creates the possibilities. There are constant references to a band called Copenhagen Interpretation, who disappear into thin air in the middle of a benefit concert. In Adam Felber's comic first novel, Schr√∂dinger's Ball (2006), Dr. Erwin Schr√∂dinger is a character, and there is much exploration of quantum mechanics. In the short story \\"Schr√∂dinger's Cat-Sitter\\" by F. Gwynplaine MacIntyre (published in Analog magazine, July/August 2001), a time-traveler named Smedley Faversham visits the past to interview Erwin Schr√∂dinger but gets tricked into taking care of Schr√∂dinger's wife's cat while she is away and Schr√∂dinger is visiting Max Planck. In attempting to take care of the cat, Faversham inadvertently locks it in a cabinet with a Geiger counter, a vial of acid, and a hammer, unintentionally enacting Schr√∂dinger's thought experiment, but with results that remain as uncertain as in the original case. The title character (though not a main character) of Robert A. Heinlein's The Cat Who Walks Through Walls, a kitten named Pixel, is of indeterminate existence, and as such, has the ability to turn up in places that are specifically sealed to outside access. When this ability is questioned, the answer is \\"He's Schr√∂dinger's cat,\\" leading to the response, \\"Then Schr√∂dinger had better come get him.\\" In Glynne MacLean's 2009 short story Viennese Meow Schr√∂dinger's cat tells his version of the famous thought experiment. In the S.M. Stirling \\"T2\\" novel trilogy, John Connor mentally compares his, Skynet's technology and ultimately everyone's existence to the Schr√∂dinger principle of entropy. In the Hellsing manga series by Kouta Hirano, one of the depicted Nazis is an artificial catboy named Schr√∂dinger. He claims that he is everywhere and nowhere at the same time, which is similar to the cat being alive and dead at the same time.Kouta Hirano, Hellsing: Volume 4. Panini Manga und Comic It is also said that he can only exist as long as he is aware of himself. In the second anime adaption, he eventually allows himself to be absorbed by the vampire Alucard, which causes his awareness to be clouded. This then spreads to Alucard, who vanishes for thirty years. Alucard returns after destroying the millions of souls within himself, giving him access to all of Schr√∂dinger's abilities. On a somewhat more serious level, Ian Stewart's novel Flatterland, (a sequel to Flatland) attempts to explain many concepts in modern mathematics and physics through the device of having a young female Flatlander explore other parts of the \\"Mathiverse\\". Schr√∂dinger's Cat is just one of the many strange Mathiverse denizens she and her guide meet; the cat is still uncertain whether it is alive or dead, long after it left the box. Her guide, the Space Hopper, reassures the Cat with a modern view of quantum decoherence. Ursula K. Le Guin wrote a story entitled \\"Schr√∂dinger's Cat\\" in 1974 (reprinted in The Compass Rose, published in 1982), which also deals with decoherence. Greg Egan's novel Quarantine, billed as \\"a story of quantum catastrophe\\", features an alternative solution to the paradox: in Egan's version of quantum mechanics, the wave function does not collapse naturally. Only certain living things‚Äîhuman beings among them‚Äîcollapse the wave function of things they observe. Humans are therefore highly dangerous to other lifeforms which require the full diversity of uncollapsed wavefunctions to survive. In the 2003 novel Vernon God Little by DBC Pierre, the concept is discussed by the Vernon and Jesus characters. It is erroneously attributed by Jesus to the German philosopher Immanuel Kant. In the play Schr√∂dinger's Girlfriend, the future Nobel Prize winner finds himself falling under the spell of cabaret singer and seductress Hansi Haas, who has already had her way with Einstein, Planck and Bohr. As he wrestles with his love and the problems of wave theory, Hass throws him over for Paul Dirac, revealing a truth that holds for both love and quantum physics: \\"if you never ask the question, the answer can still be yes.\\" (Review of play at Playbill) This artwork by ADA+Neagoe, originally published in Omagiu magazine. MacSchr√∂dinger's Cat, a 2010 novel by James Conor O'Brien, is a multi-verse romp across the universes centering on Venice and involves a search for a missing scientific experiment concerning a trans- dimensional cat, with Janis Joplin as God, and a panoply of caricatures of physics and physicists ranging from James Clerk Maxwell and Schr√∂dinger to String Theory, the Big Bang and infinitely annoyed monkeys. Martha Grimes' 2010 mystery novel \\"The Black Cat,\\" one of the Inspector Jury series, features a black cat named Schr√∂dinger, who is always getting into or blamed for trouble. To Say Nothing of the Dog tells the tale of a man named Ned Henry who travels back in time from 2057 to 1888 to find and return a cat named Princess Arjumand to her owner. In his journey back through time, Ned finds the cat packed away in a covered basket and alludes to the lifelessness of her as they travel down the Thames. It is later discovered that in 1888 the butler, Baine, attempted to drown Princess Arjumand by throwing the box she was in into the Thames, only to be rescued by Verity, another time traveler, and brought to 2057. Many descriptions of Princess Arjumand in this book point back to how she might or should have perished in the Thames but was now alive through an action that occurred and its improbability, alluding specifically to the paradox created in the thought experiment that is created by Schr√∂dinger's cat. Before Watchmen: Nite Owl/Dr. Manhattan, a 2014 graphic novel written by J. Michael Straczynski with artwork by Adam Hughes, refers to Schr√∂dinger's cat several times in discussing quantum mechanics and the many different paths that history might take.https://www.amazon.com/Before-Watchmen-Nite-Owl- Manhattan/dp/1401245145/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1471378795&sr;=1-1&keywords;=before+watchmen+nite+owl =Animals other than cats= Fiction writers have confined other animals besides cats in such contraptions. Dan Simmons's novel Endymion begins with hero Raul Endymion sentenced to death by imprisonment in a \\"Schr√∂dinger box\\". K≈çsuke Fujishima's manga series Ah! My Goddess featured a play on Schr√∂dinger's Cat. During one storyline, a storage room was expanded to infinite proportions and the main characters encountered a Schr√∂dinger's Whale, an extremely rare species with the ability to travel through space-time in a five-dimensional quantum state. The male lead in the series, Keiichi Morisato, befriends the whale and teaches it songs by real-life musical group The Carpenters (in the original English translation, it was Matthew Sweet) - but their time spent together is short, for the whale must move on or risk its safety as its wave function collapses. Because of this need to keep moving through quantum states, Schr√∂dinger's Whales hardly ever meet, the reason they are so thin on the ground ‚Äî but miraculously, Keiichi secured the future of the species by teaching it the songs. After discovering the whale had gone, he found out that it had learned Only Yesterday by itself (Missing Time in the translation) - this gave the whales a call that they could locate each other by. Poetry *Cecil Adams, Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs Cat: an Epic Poem *Gwen Harwood, Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs Cat Preaches to the Mice *Hollis Robbins, His Paws Upon the Dish Television *In the Phineas and Ferb, \\"Lost in Danville\\" (2014), when an unknown capsule lands in the yard, Baljeet theorizes that it could contain a whole litter of Schr√∂dinger's cats. *In the Silicon Valley episode, \\"Binding Arbitration\\" (2015), Gilfoyle and Dinesh reference the experiment as it relates to Richard's arbitration hearing. Jared also makes the comment saying, \\"Does that mean that all of us who attend open casket funerals are murderers?\\" *In the Stargate SG-1 episode, \\"Enigma\\" (1998), Samantha Carter gives a pet cat named Schr√∂dinger to Narim. After explaining the name Schr√∂dinger, Narim comments that his society calls that concept Kulivrian physics. Narim's response to Carter's inquiry about whether or not he has studied it is: \\"Yes, I've studied it...among other misconceptions of elementary science.\\" *In the Futurama episode, \\"Mars University\\" (1999), Professor Farnsworth is lecturing on the effects of quantum neutrino fields and the blackboard behind him displays an explanation of \\"Superdupersymmetric String Theory\\" and a diagram explaining \\"Witten's Dog\\". Witten's Dog, named after Ed Witten, is a parody of the classic Schr√∂dinger's cat paradox. Astrophysicist David Schiminovich created both the equations and the diagram, based on \\"an equation that constrains the mass density of neutrinos in the universe\\". Also the episode, \\"Law and Oracle\\" (2011), features an extended car chase scene in which Police Officer Fry apprehends Erwin Schr√∂dinger, who is transporting a box containing \\"a cat, some poison and a cesium atom.\\" When asked if the cat is alive or dead, Schr√∂dinger responds that \\"it is a superposition of both states, until you open it and collapse the wave-function.\\" Upon opening the box, Fry finds a living cat, who attacks him, while his partner discovers \\"there's also a lot of drugs in there.\\" It is later revealed that the cat has agreed to testify against Schr√∂dinger. *In the Doctor Who audio adventure Zagreus, the Eighth Doctor is transformed into the destructive Zagreus after he is exposed to an anti-time explosion after he was forced to use his TARDIS to contain it- anti- time being as destructive to time as anti-matter is to matter-, but shifts between his own personality and the 'Zagreus' personality, realising that as long as he remains in the TARDIS, the universe cannot decide which personality is in control, noting the similarities between this situation and the Schr√∂dinger's Cat experiment. *In the Numb3rs episode \\"Identity Crisis\\" (2005), Charlie Eppes and Larry Fleinhardt discuss the Schr√∂dinger's cat paradox in relation to how can a man be both guilty and not guilty of a crime. *In the Yu-Gi-Oh! GX episode, \\"It's All Relative\\" (2006 Japan, 2007 USA), Dr. Eisenstein uses a card known as \\"Schr√∂dinger's Cat\\", which allows him when he draws outside his Draw Phase to shuffle the drawn cards back into his deck and draw the same number of cards again. *In The Big Bang Theory episode, \\"The Tangerine Factor\\" (May 19, 2008), Leonard's attempt to arrange a date with Penny results in both Penny and Leonard's seeking Sheldon's advice. Sheldon advises Penny that \\"just like Schr√∂dinger's cat being alive and dead at the same time\\", her date with Leonard currently has both \\"good and bad\\" probabilistic outcomes. The only way to find out is to \\"open the box\\", in other words collapse the wave-function of an uncertain date into a specific outcome. Also, in the episode \\"The Russian Rocket Reaction\\" (October 13, 2011), Sheldon characterizes his relationship to Leonard as \\"Schr√∂dinger's friendship\\", in the sense that Leonard is simultaneously his friend and mortal enemy (as he may or may not attend Wil Wheaton's party). When Sheldon tries to explain the paradox to Penny, she gives an approximate description: \\"...] there's this cat in a box and until you open it, it's either dead or alive or both [...]\\". Penny references it during a brief conversation with her new boyfriend in \\"The Codpiece Topology\\" (September 29, 2008), and Leonard references it during lunch with the guys in \\"The Bus Pants Utilization\\" (January 6, 2011). A 9-year old Sheldon Cooper first mentions the Schr√∂dinger's cat experiment in the prequel series Young Sheldon (season 1, episode 8). *In Season 1, episode 6 of FlashForward, \\"Scary Monsters and Super Creeps\\" (2009), Simon references Schr√∂dinger's Cat as he is trying to explain why the blackouts happened. He describes it using the metaphor of holding a tiny cat in a closed hand with a poisoned sardine. If the cat eats the sardine, he will die; if not, he will live. But the outcome will be unknown until the hand is opened. Until then, the cat may be both alive and dead simultaneously, with reality ultimately being decided upon the intrusion of an observer. *Charlie Brooker, on his program Newswipe (2009), refers to the media coverage of Jade Goody's death as paradoxical in the same way that Schr√∂dinger's cat is. He shows a visual metaphor using a stuffed cat to explain, then comments, \\"But that's the Copenhagen Interpretation of quantum mechanics for you.\\" *Nearly a third of an episode of the series, Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei is devoted to Schr√∂dinger's cat, referencing it in the way that there are infinite possibilities for anything in a box. Examples include Schr√∂dinger's lunch box (which may or may not have mold), Schr√∂dinger's boxed- wives (which could all possibly be ideal), and refusing to face reality (by boxing things with possibly bad outcomes). *In Space Dandy's season 2 episode \\"I Can't Be The Only One, Baby\\", which centers on string theory, one of the alternate dimension versions of the main character Meow is a Schr√∂dingarian, an alien race composed by literal Schr√∂dinger's cats. *In Rick and Morty season two episode one, Rick and his grandchildren become trapped in a plane of uncertainty after fracturing time: it's a nearly featureless void, but a number of Schr√∂dinger's cats can be seen floating around, evidently due to them being uncertainties themselves. *In season 10 of Bones, Dr. Brennan tells a joke referencing Schr√∂dinger's cat. *In Myriad Colors Phantom World episode 7 Schr√∂dinger's cat is both described at the beginning and used as a plot device for the episode. *In the anime Hellsing Ultimate, Schr√∂dinger's Cat is a male human with feminine and feline appearances, named Schr√∂dinger. Schr√∂dinger is said to be a paradox, being \\"everywhere, yet nowhere.\\" He cut his own head off and his blood was absorbed by Alucard, which mixed with the blood of all the souls Alucard absorbed, thus tainting Alucard and making him a paradox. Alucard faded away, but returned after several decades claiming to have killed off all souls he absorbed except one. He claims he's now \\"everywhere, yet nowhere,\\" implying that the last soul is actually Schr√∂dinger's. *In Season 4 of Person of Interest, Root refers to Schr√∂dinger's Cat when speaking to John about Shaw's unknown fate. *In the Teen Titans Go episode, \\"Quantum Fun\\", Robin attempts to describe Schr√∂dinger's Cat as an experiment to his colleagues; however, the rest of them confuse it with one of the Peanuts character, Schroeder, even going so far as having Beast Boy appear as Snoopy. * The third season of Dark makes extensive use of Schr√∂dinger's Cat to describe the existence of parallel realities within the show's universe. Film *In A Serious Man (2009), written by the Coen Brothers, protagonist Larry Gopnik mentions Schr√∂dinger's cat in a discussion about the unpredictability of future events. * In Repo Men (2010), Jude Law's character mentions the Schr√∂dinger's cat example in the beginning of the movie. *In 6 Films to Keep You Awake: The Baby's Room (2006), a Spanish made-for-TV movie, a journalist, Domingo, describes Schr√∂dinger's cat to the protagonist, Juan, in order to explain the existence of parallel worlds. *In The Prestige (2006), Nikola Tesla uses a cat to demonstrate a machine he makes for The Great Danton. *In Prince of Darkness (1987), Walter and Catherine have a discussion about Schr√∂dinger's cat, with Catherine understanding and Walter not. * In the made-for-television movie Mean Girls 2, one of the characters wears a shirt written \\"Save the Schr√∂dinger's cat\\". * In the short film Dead and Alive (2013), by Desert Eagle Pictures, the situation of the main character Cynthia runs parallel in many ways to that of the Schr√∂dinger's cat thought experiment. The distinction is most evident in the classroom scene, where a high school physics teacher gives a lecture on the aforementioned feline. * In the low-budget science fiction movie Coherence (2013), Schr√∂dinger's cat is the principle driving the alternative universes that occur during the movie. Video games * In Digital Devil Saga, a game produced by Atlus, there is an enigmatic cat-like creature revealed to have some connection to God, whom the main character can see throughout the games. His name is Schr√∂dinger. * In Wild Arms 3, the character of Shady the Cat, owned by Maya Schr√∂dinger, is based on Schr√∂dinger's cat, and is claustrophobic as a result of the \\"experiment\\". * In NetHack, one of the monsters encountered in this roguelike game is called 'Quantum Mechanic', which often carries a chest. The chest either contains a cat corpse, or causes a cat to appear. Reading the source code to the game also reveals that the game does not determine the state of the cat until the chest is opened. * In Pop'n Music, a song titled Schr√∂dinger's Cat was composed by Tomosuke Funaki for the arcade version of \\"Pop'n Music 16 PARTY\\". It is credited as the first song in the series with a 43 difficulty rating, the highest difficulty level in the series. *In Portal, GLaDOS tried to replicate the experiment with the scientists from Aperture Science, and she settled that the cat was dead. In the ending of its sequel, Portal 2, the Fact Sphere might say \\"The Schr√∂dinger's cat paradox outlines a situation in which a cat in a box must be considered, for all intents and purposes, simultaneously alive and dead. Schr√∂dinger created this paradox as a justification for killing cats.\\" In the publicity web-comic for the game, the fate of the protagonist Chell is a reference to Schr√∂dinger's Cat. GLaDOS also mentions a \\"bring your cat to work day\\" and that she has the boxes and the neurotoxins (poison) and just needs the cats. There is also an achievement called Schr√∂dinger's Catch, awarded when the player catches a blue box before it touches the ground, after it is broken out of a glass receptacle. * In Rock Band, a daily battle of the bands was entitled Schr√∂dinger's Cat. It featured the songs \\"Alive\\" by Pearl Jam, \\"Dead\\" by The Pixies and \\"Wanted Dead or Alive\\" by Bon Jovi. * In Gundeadligne, the first stage is \\"Le chat noir de Schr√∂dinger - Schr√∂dinger's Black Cat\\", This stage's boss is called \\"Chatnoir\\", whose appearance is that of a Cat girl (nekomimi). * In Elements the Game, Schr√∂dinger's Cat is an Entropy creature that has an ability Dead and Alive. This activates death effects without killing the cat. *In the visual novel Umineko no Naku Koro ni, episode 3, the main character Battler uses Schr√∂dinger's Cat in his battle against the witch Beatrice to deny the existence of magic. The remainder of the visual novel continuously refers to this as \\"cat box\\". *In BlazBlue: Continuum Shift, after a fight between Tager and Lambda-11, during Tager's storyline, Kokonoe references Lambda-11 and Tager being similar to two Schr√∂dinger's Cats. Also Terumi is both dead and alive, and can only exist as long as he is being observed, but in this case being observed might be an emotional response to his actions. *In BioShock 2, hidden within a mass of ice, there is a deceased cat. Upon melting the ice and closely examining it, the display reads \\"Schr√∂dinger\\". *In Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward, there is a book named Schr√∂dinger's Cat in one room, and the thought experiment is eventually used in two parts of the game's plot; the identity of the masked person known as K is different in different endings, and whether or not the old woman is dead or alive also depends on the ending. *In Borderlands 2, Patricia Tannis makes mention of Schr√∂dinger's \\"zombie cat\\" being to blame when describing the possibility that digistructed loot chests might contain either great loot or \\"nothing but crappy white shields\\". *In Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective, we have two examples: Yomiel, the original bad guy, who was a man that was neither alive nor dead, as his body constantly regenerated because of the power of a meteorite that entered his back and lodged in his heart; and Sissel which becomes a more literal example after going 10 years in the past to save his master Yomiel from such fate, but in turn the meteorite lodged inside the black cat himself, allowing him to be both dead and alive. * In PuzzleCraft, when farming, a treasure chest will occasionally contain one cat. The first time this happens the player unlocks the \\"Schr√∂dinger's Cat\\" achievement. *In Final Fantasy XIII-2 and Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII, there is a subspecies of the popular 'Cait Sith' creature called 'Schr√∂dinger'. It appears as a grey cat sitting in a light blue pot. *In Schr√∂dinger's Cat and the Raiders of The Lost Quark, a game developed by ItalicPig and Team17 (known for the Worms franchise), The player plays as the titular feline. *In Life Is Strange, the character, Warren, is wearing a shirt with Schr√∂dinger's box on it with a speech bubble that says \\"Meow\\". Card games * In Force of Will, A character/card bearing the name \\"Schr√∂dinger, the Fallen Black Cat\\" is featured as both a character within the story and a Regalia that lives in a constant state of life and death whose primary ability is to swallow and regurgitate his meals as his new minions. Both his state of life and his life to death capabilities are a formable reference to the very paradox.

Since so many articles were being published about Affleck being in or out of the movie, The Weekly Planet devised the phrase \\"Schrodinger's Bat,\\" as if Affleck was simultaneously both in and out of the role of Batman. The joke reached its conclusion in 2019, however, when Robert Pattinson (known by The Weekly Planet as \\"Robat Battinbat\\") was recast as Batman.

It was originally opened as the Silver Jubilee Walkway to commemorate Queen Elizabeth II's accession; the Queen herself opened it on 9 June 1977 during her silver jubilee celebrations. The intention was to connect many of London's major tourist attractions and it is now one of seven such walks within the Mayor of London's strategic walking routes. Its length is 15 miles. The Jubilee Walkway Trust was set up in 1978 to look after the trail, in collaboration with local authorities. On 24 October 2002, during the Queen's golden jubilee, the renamed Jubilee Walkway (the word Silver was dropped as appropriate) reopened after refurbishment and a new spur walk was opened in 2003, called the Camden loop, which took walkers into north-west London. The Jubilee Walkway can be divided into five smaller loop walks: the Western loop, Eastern loop, City loop, Camden loop and Jubilee loop.  Major sites  ;Western loop The longest loop within the Jubilee Walkway, the Western loop is six miles in length and originates at Leicester Square in the West End of London. Walking in an anti-clockwise direction, some of the major sites taken in on the loop include: *National Gallery *Trafalgar Square *Admiralty Arch *St. James's Park *Parliament Square *Westminster Abbey *Lambeth Palace *London Eye *OXO Tower *Tate Modern *Millennium Footbridge *St Paul's Cathedral *Lincoln's Inn Fields *Sir John Soane's Museum *Royal Opera House *Covent Garden *London Transport Museum *National Portrait Gallery ;Eastern loop Five miles in length, the Eastern loop originates at the Tate Modern.

Alongside William R Miller, he developed many of the founding principles of motivational interviewing.  Biography  Professor Stephen Rollnick grew up in Cape Town, South Africa and completed a Masters training in research methods in Strathclyde University in Glasgow (1978) and a professional training in clinical psychology in Cardiff (1983). Since then he has lived and worked in there, as a clinical psychologist in the National Health Service and more recently, as member of the Department of General Practice. His early experience as a trainee nurse in a hospital addiction treatment setting led to an interest in constructive methods for helping people resolve difficult behaviour change problems. This has taken him through a close collaboration with Professor William R Miller on the subject of motivational interviewing, a Doctoral thesis (1993) on counselling for excessive drinkers, to more recent work on consultations about lifestyle and medication use in healthcare practice. Through collaboration with Professor Chris Butler and Dr Paul Kinnersley he is now studying broader communication challenges like the antibiotic consultation, and the development and evaluation of methods for helping undergraduates and qualified practitioners change their communication and consulting behaviour.  Development of motivational interviewing  Rollnick developed many fundamental concepts of motivational interviewing with Miller in their 1991 book.Miller, W. R. & Rollnick, S. (1991) Motivational Interviewing: Preparing People to Change Addictive Behaviour. New York: Guilford Press Rollnick used his experience in the field of addiction treatment to find ways in which healthcare professionals could combat ambivalence regarding change.

March 23, 1983. Page 23. Qui√±ones rose to prominence by creating massive New York City subway car graffiti that carried his moniker \\"LEE\\". His style is rooted in popular culture and often with political messages. Early life and career Qui√±ones was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico, and raised in the Lower East Side section of Manhattan. He started drawing at the age of five, and started doing subway graffiti in 1974. By 1976, Lee was creating huge murals of graffiti art across the subway system. As a subway graffiti artist, Lee almost exclusively painted whole cars, all together about 125 cars. He was the major contributor to one of the first-ever whole-trains, along with DOC, MONO and SLAVE, the core members of The Fabulous Five crew, which also included DIRTY SLUG. It was the first ever whole-train to run in traffic.Gastman, R. and Neelon, C. (2010). The history of American graffiti. New York: Harper Design. In November 1976, ten subway cars were painted with a range of colorful murals and set a new benchmark for the scale of graffiti works. This is documented in an interview with Qui√±ones in the book Getting up by Craig Castleman, MIT Press (MA) (October 1982). \\"The Hell Express\\", \\"Earth is Hell, Heaven is Life\\", \\"Stop the Bomb\\" are some of Qui√±ones paintings that ran for months. Qui√±ones pieces were left untouched by other writers and some of them ran for years even though thousands of writers were painting on subway cars at that time. Qui√±ones often added poetic messages in his pieces, such as \\"Graffiti is art and if art is a crime, please God, forgive me\\". Lee also painted huge handball court murals in his neighborhood, for instance ‚ÄúHoward the Duck,‚Äù the first whole handball court mural, in the spring of 1978 outside of his old high school, Corlears Junior High School #56. Around this time he befriended Brooklyn-based Fred Braithwaite, who later became known as Fab Five Freddy. In December 1979, Claudio Bruni, an art collector and heir to the Bruni wine fortune, offered Qui√±ones and Fab Five Freddy their first show at his Galleria La Medusa in Rome, Italy. By 1985, Qui√±ones was described as a legend among other graffiti artists. In the 1980s, Qui√±ones began appearing in films. He starred as Raymond Zoro i Charlie Ahearn's film Wild Style (1983).. He also has a cameo in Blondie's promo video of the song \\"Rapture.\\"George Lee Qui√±ones IMDB database. Retrieved 13 July 2012. Qui√±ones played Sammy in Rosemary Rodriguez's Acts of Worship (2001). He plays himself in Adam Bhala Lough's Bomb the System (2002).. He also appears in Videograf 10. In 2005, Qui√±ones raised money for the Boys & Girls Clubs of America affected by Hurricane Katrina. He has lectured at universities in Europe as well as in the U.S. at Columbia University, University of New Mexico, and the School of Visual Arts. At an exhibition in 2008, all his paintings were sold to guitarist Eric Clapton. His paintings are housed in the permanent collections of the Whitney Museum of Art, the Museum of the City New York, the Groninger Museum (Groningen, Netherlands) and the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen (Rotterdam, Netherlands), and have been exhibited at the New Museum Of Contemporary Art (New York City), the Museum of National Monuments (Paris, France) and the Staatliche Museum (Germany).

Biography Zenith guitar headstock and neck Zenith Guitar label detail Framus Zenith model 17 Ivor Mairants was born in Rypin, Poland. He moved with his family to the United Kingdom in 1913 and attended Raine's Foundation School in Bethnal Green He began learning banjo at the age of 17 and became a professional musician three years later.Gilbert, Mark. 'Mairants, Ivor' in Grove Music Online (2001) Beginning in the 1930s, he was a banjoist and guitarist for British dance bands led by Bert Firman, Ambrose, Roy Fox, Lew Stone, Geraldo, and Ted Heath. In the 1960s and 1970s his guitar playing was often heard on television, radio, film soundtracks, and many recordings with the Mantovani orchestra and with Manuel and his Music of the Mountains. His recording of the \\"Adagio\\" from Joaquin Rodrigo's Concierto de Aranjuez with Manuel sold over one million copies. His guitar quintet broadcast regularly in the late 1950s on the BBC's Guitar Club series. Mairants devoted much time to writing music and instructional method books for guitar. He worked with American guitarist Josh White on The Josh White Guitar Method (Boosey & Hawkes) in 1956. British guitarist John Renbourn and American guitarist Stefan Grossman (who was living in the UK at the time) have cited it as an influence on their playing. The success The Josh White Guitar Method prompted Mairants to commission a Zenith \\"Josh White\\" signature guitar based on Josh's Martin 0021 from German guitar maker Oscar Teller. Scottish guitarist Bert Jansch owned one of these models in his early playing years. On the last page of Josh White Guitar Method (printed 1956) there is a photo of this Zenith Josh White signature guitar and some text about it. In 1958, his book The Flamenco Guitar was published. It was written with the cooperation of Torroba (conductor), Sabicas ,and other guitarists. The Guild Guitar Company in the US worked with Josh White on a signature model in 1965. Mark Dronge took Josh White to the Guild factory in 1965. A guitar made to Josh White's specifications was made and was meant to become a signature guitar for White, but it was never mass- produced. Dronge said, \\"The scene was starting to change. The Beatles were so influential and all these bands came out and the electric music was getting bigger and the plans for Josh White model just kind of fell by the wayside, unfortunately.\\" Mairants commissioned German guitar manufacturer Framus to make further Zenith Guitars, with Boosey & Hawkes the sole distributor and each guitar signed by him. These included the Zenith Model 17 acoustic which became Paul McCartney's first guitar and on which he wrote most of his early songs. In an interview McCartney relates how he was surprised to see a 'chit' in Abbey Road Studios that Mairants had signed as a session musician - \\"...he was a God to us.\\"The Beatles Recording Sessions p. 9, Lewisohn In 1950 Mairants established the Central School of Dance Music in London, which he ran for 10 years. All instruments were taught at this establishment, but emphasis was given to guitar. Among the teaching staff at the school were Johnny Dankworth, Jack Brymer, Kenny Baker, Bert Weedon and Ike Isaacs, as well as Eric Gilder.Obituary, 'Ivor Mairants' in The Independent, 26 February 1998 In 1960 Mairants handed the school over to Gilder, who renamed it as the Eric Gilder School of Music.Chiltern, John.

He was often employed as a consultant for instrument makers and importers. Beginning in the 1930s, Mairants was a columnist for Melody Maker, BMG, and Classical Guitar. In 1980, his biography My Fifty Fretting Years was published by Ashley Mark Publishing in the UK and, in 1995, his book The Great Jazz Guitarists, a collection of note-for-note transcriptions of historic jazz guitar solos, was published by Music Maker Publications in Cambridge, England. He was a member of the Worshipful Society of Musicians, a British guild, and a Freeman of the City of London. In 1997 the Worshipful Society of Musicians inaugurated an annual competition for the Ivor Mairants Guitar Award.

The uninhabited, barren island is a tuff cone which is part of the extinct Niihau volcano. Lehua was one of the first five islands sighted by Captain James Cook in 1778 which he spelled as \\"Oreehoua\\". Lehua Island is a Hawaii State Wildlife Sanctuary. As a restricted sanctuary, all activities are prohibited on the island without a permit. Public access to the island is restricted to areas below the high tide water mark. Lehua provides habitat for at least 16 species of seabirds, as well as non-native Pacific rats. A population of European rabbits had lived on the island for many years but were removed in 2005. When weather and wave conditions permit crossings from Kauai, Lehua is a noted destination for snorkeling and scuba diving. It is also well known for an unusual geological formation dubbed \\"the keyhole\\". Located in one of the crescent's narrow arms, this is a tall, thin notch cut from one side, all the way through to the other side of the arm. The United States Coast Guard maintains Lehua Rock Light (a lighthouse) on KaunuakalƒÅ, at the highest point of the island. Conservation and Restoration Lehua is one of the largest and most diverse seabird colonies in the main Hawaiian Islands with 17 seabird species and 25 native plants (14 Hawai\`i endemics ‚Äì occurring nowhere else in the world) inhabiting the steep, rocky, windswept slopes of the tiny island. Lehua is an important part of native Hawaiian culture‚Äîthe Ni‚Äòihau community gathers ‚Äòopihi (limpets) in adjacent marine waters and on the island are several important native Hawaiian cultural sites. Invasive rats were foraging on native plants and seeds, which imperiled the entire ecosystem. These impacts contributed to erosion which can in turn impair near-shore marine and coral ecosystems and fisheries. Native birds like the threatened Newell's Shearwater were likely being restricted from breeding on Lehua Island due to predation by rats. Smaller, open-nesting seabirds such as terns and noddies were conspicuously absent from Lehua (save small numbers found in sea caves), also a suspected artifact of rat predation. Invasive rats ravage other threatened birds. Therefore, in August 2017, the DLNR Division of Forestry and Wildlife (DOFAW) with project implementation partner Island Conservation implemented an aerial application of bait with supplemental hand application to eradicate non-native invasive rats. Signs of seabird revival were found post-eradication. The official Final Monitoring Report Issued on Lehua Restoration Project found no rodenticide in environmental samples and minimal impact to species other than rats.

However, the Tongzhou racecourse was shut down on 23 October 2005. In the following month, over 600 horses were destroyed. The reason for the closure and the cull appears to have been loss of revenue, following the decision of the Chinese government not to allow gambling on horseracing.

The documentary won the First Appearance competition at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam, as well as several other awards.Angelmaker awards The film is shot on location in the rural Hungarian village of Nagyr√©v, alternating between portraits of the surrounding landscape and first-hand narrations by the elderly inhabitants. Some women poisoned unwanted husbands based on their oppression, drunkenness or laziness, some because the wives had taken lovers, some because the husbands had returned home disabled from World War I. Unwanted babies were also poisoned. A web of stories unfolds through the characters' memories which recapture old but ever- lasting tales of life, death and the struggle between the sexes. One of them is the midwife's story as well as one of the narrators' revelation that the 'flypaper' murders were a widespread practice not only in the particular area but on a national level. The film tries to give some insight in the domestic battles that the women of the village have to fight.

Similarly, a yearling is a horse of either sex between the ages of one and two. A young female horse is called a filly, and a mare once she is an adult animal. In horse racing, particularly for Thoroughbreds in the United Kingdom, a colt is defined as an uncastrated male from the age of two up to and including the age of four. The term is derived from Proto-Germanic *kultaz (\\"lump, bundle, offspring\\") and is etymologically related to \\"child.\\" An adult male horse, if left intact, is called either a \\"stallion\\" if used for breeding, or a horse (sometimes full horse); if castrated, it is called a gelding. In some cases, particularly informal nomenclature, a gelding under four years is still called a colt. A rig or ridgling is a male equine with a retained testicle or one which has been incompletely castrated.Summerhayes, RS, Encyclopaedia for Horsemen, Warne & Co, London & New York, 1966 In the wild, colts are driven from their herds by the herd stallion somewhere between the age of one and two. This may be, in part, an instinct to prevent inbreeding. When driven out, they usually join with other young stallions in a bachelor herd.

The show was broadcast live from WNBQ in Chicago, Illinois, airing 15 minutes a day, five days a week, at 5 p.m. EST. It is widely credited as the first soap opera broadcast on television. It may be more accurately described as the first daytime drama or the first soap opera strip, as it was preceded by DuMont series Faraway Hill in 1946 and Highway to the Stars in 1947, both of which are described as soap operas but aired later in the evenings and broadcast only once a week; Guiding Light had also been in production for 12 years once These Are My Children debuted, but only as a radio series - its TV version did not debut until 1952. Created by Irna Phillips and directed by Norman Felton, the show was based in large part on Phillips' early radio soaps Today's Children and Painted Dreams. Children centered on an Irish widow, Mrs. Henehan and her struggles to run a boarding house as well as help her three children and new daughter-in-law Jean. Critics were not impressed; Television World ended their review with: \\"There is no place on television for this type of program, a blank screen is preferable.\\" In addition to critical opinions, the immediate factor in NBC's cancellation of These Are My Children was the decision by AT&T; Corporation to end use of its coaxial cable for weekday eastbound distribution of programs originating in Chicago. Simultaneously executives of NBC \\"had found fault with the program\\" while they wanted to have more shows originate in New York rather than in Chicago or on the West Coast.

For the purpose of these elections, each of the 23 provinces and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires are considered electoral districts. Each district elected a number of members of the Lower House (the Argentine Chamber of Deputies) roughly proportional to their population. Eight districts (Buenos Aires, Formosa, Jujuy, La Rioja, Misiones, San Juan, San Luis, and Santa Cruz) also elected members to the Upper House of Congress (the Argentine Senate); as usual, three senators were elected (two for the majority, one for the first minority). In most provinces, the national elections were conducted in parallel with local ones, whereby a number of municipalities elected legislative officials (concejales) and in some cases also a mayor (or the equivalent executive post). Each provincial election followed local regulations. A number of districts had held primary elections beforehand. In most cases, primary elections are optional and can be called for by the local political parties as needed; in Santa Fe, however, the primaries were universal and compulsory due to a recent law that repealed the much-criticized Ley de Lemas. Turnout continued to decline, and reached 70.9% in these elections. Background The main parties and coalitions competing in these elections were: * President Kirchner's faction of Peronism, called Frente para la Victoria (FV, \\"Front for Victory\\") and its allies. * Other factions of Peronism, under the usual name Partido Justicialista (PJ, \\"Justicialist Party\\"), often led by their respective provincial party leaders (notably Eduardo Duhalde in Buenos Aires Province). * Uni√≥n C√≠vica Radical (UCR, \\"Radical Civic Union\\"). * Afirmaci√≥n Para Una Rep√∫blica Igualitaria (ARI, \\"Support for an Egalitarian Republic\\"), led by Elisa Carri√≥. * Recrear para el Crecimiento (Recreate for Growth, usually shortened to Recrear) and its allies within the Propuesta Republicana (Republican Proposal, PRO) front. * Partido Socialista (PS, Socialist Party). In some districts, different factions of the Justicialist Party (PJ) presented candidates separately. In Buenos Aires Province and the city of Buenos Aires, the main intra-party division of the PJ was between the center-right, traditional Peronist faction led by Hilda Gonz√°lez de Duhalde (wife of former governor and interim president Eduardo Duhalde), and the more center-left \\"heterodox\\" faction with candidates that answer to President N√©stor Kirchner. These included his own wife, Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner, and Minister of Foreign Relations, Rafael Bielsa. In the Province of Buenos Aires, this split was protested by other parties, on the grounds that the PJ (taken as a whole) would most likely win the three senatorial benches available (as it finally occurred). Kirchner took a prominent role in the campaign for \\"his\\" candidates of the Front for Victory (Frente para la Victoria, FV) in most provinces, explicitly stating that these elections were a referendum on his administration. Kirchner also campaigned against former President Carlos Menem, a leading conservative Peronist, in La Rioja Province, where the latter was ultimately elected to the Senate for the third (minority party) seat. The opening and closing campaign meetings of the FV were both held in Rosario, a typically progressive city that, since 1987, had been governed successfully by a Socialist local government. This party changed the traditional electoral paradigm in the Province of Santa Fe, largely displacing Peronism and the UCR in that district. =Results= President N√©stor Kirchner (left) confers with Buenos Aires Province Governor Felipe Sol√°. Their opposition to powerbroker Eduardo Duhalde dominated the 2005 races. Buoyed by a strong recovery in the Argentine economy, candidates endorsed by Kirchner (mainly on the Front for Victory ticket) obtained an overwhelming triumph. Of the 127 deputies elected, the FV won 69 seats (54%); the UCR only got 19. The rest of the Justicialist Party obtained 11 seats; Recrear got 9, the ARI got 8, and the Socialist Party got 5. Only the three most voted in this list have an established national structure; Recrear and the ARI are relatively recent offshoots of the UCR (to the right- and left- wing side of the political spectrum, respectively), and the Socialist Party's five deputies all belong to the province of Santa Fe, the only district where the PS is strong. As explained above, eight provinces were also scheduled to renew their senators (the Senate is renewed by thirds every two years). The Front for Victory won 17 of the 24 senatorial seats. The other factions of Peronism got 4 senators. The UCR got the remaining 3 seats. Among the remarkable results were the victory of First Lady Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner in Buenos Aires, the largest in the country, beating former First Lady Hilda Gonz√°lez de Duhalde by about 25% of the votes; and the defeat of Carlos Menem in his home district, La Rioja (though he won the first minority seat). Parties took part in the elections in various alliances and with various labels in the diverse provinces. The table below is based on the results per province listed at Elecciones 2005.

Pipeline system  Ma≈æeiki≈≥ Nafta operates a system of pipelines with a total length of around 500 kilometers. This system includes two pump stations near Bir≈æai and another near Joni≈°kis, crude oil pipelines to the Ma≈æeikiai Refinery and B≈´tingƒó Terminal, a crude oil pipeline leading to Ventspils, and another products pipeline supplying diesel fuel to the same location. Construction of pipelines in Lithuania started in 1966, with the first crude oil being put through them in 1968.Pipeline System , Ma≈æeiki≈≥ Nafta company website In 1992, the company Naftotiekis was founded for the operation of Lithuanian pipelines, which became part of Ma≈æeiki≈≥ Nafta in 1998.  B≈´tingƒó Marine Terminal  The B≈´tingƒó oil terminal is a facility owned by Ma≈æeiki≈≥ Nafta, situated in an all-year-round ice-free area of the Baltic Sea on the Lithuanian coastline near the town of B≈´tingƒó, north of Palanga. The project began in 1995 when the company B≈´tingƒós Nafta was established for the purpose of constructing and operating the Terminal. In 1998, B≈´tingƒós Nafta was merged into Ma≈æeiki≈≥ Nafta. The first tanker was loaded in B≈´tingƒó in the summer of 1999 and took on board a shipment of YUKOS crude oil. The Terminal can export up to 14 million tons of crude oil a year but can also function as an import terminal. During the construction of the facility, an environmental monitoring program was introduced that includes tests of sea and ground waters. With the start of the terminal operations, an expanded environmental monitoring program was launched. This included a computer-based leak detection system. The complex of the B≈´tingƒó Terminal consists of a crude oil pipeline that connects the facility with the Ma≈æeikiai Refinery inland, onshore terminal equipment and tanks at B≈´tingƒó, an offshore pipeline, and a single point mooring (SPM) buoyMarine Terminal , Ma≈æeiki≈≥ Nafta company website which lies 7 km offshore.  Privatization  The company was first privatized by the Lithuanian government in 1999, when it was bought by Williams Companies, a group based in the USA.

Facing bankruptcy, Yukos began to sell off its assets, including Ma≈æeiki≈≥ Nafta.Baltic lessons for EU in dealing with a resurgent Russia, Financial Times, (November 24, 2006). Several potential buyers from Russia, Kazakhstan and Poland showed interest in acquiring the refinery, whose majority stakeholder was now Yukos International, a Yukos syndicate.PKN Orlen Acquired Mazeikiu Nafta , Ma≈æeiki≈≥ Nafta company website (news, 15-12-2006) After several months of talks the proposal from Polish company PKN Orlen was found most lucrative and chosen. Additionally, it was deemed most desirable by Lithuania, which has been aiming to avoid the refinery and infrastructure being bought out by Russian interests. To force the sale to Yukos for lower price, Russia has shut down the only land pipeline, which was described as \\"tools for intimidation and blackmail\\". The agreement between Orlen and Yukos International to buy out the latter's 53.7% stake in the company, was made in June 2006. Several weeks later, PKN Orlen signed a deal with the Lithuanian government to buy a further 30.66%. The European Union's regulatory authority approved the deal on November 7, after ruling that it would not significantly harm competition in the European economic area or any substantial part of it. The buyout was finalized on 15 December 2006, with USD 1,492,000,000 being paid by PKN Orlen to Yukos International, and USD 851,828,900.31 to the Lithuanian Government.

During the fire, a 50-meter height vacuum tower collapsed, oil products leaked out, and a series of explosions were heard; The blaze covered about 800 square meters at one point. 23 firefighting vehicles were brought into the scene of the accident and eyewitness accounts said that fires reached 150m in height and could be seen from several kilometers away. A black cloud of smoke could be seen from a great distance, and drifted towards the nearby Latvian border. There were no casualties among personnel. Damages incurred are estimated around 38 million Euro, as well as around 30 million in lost revenue due to production losses.PKN Orlen buy out of Lithuania's Mazeikiu due on December 15, The Baltic Times (18 November 2006) While significant, when compared with the total output and profits of the plant, they are not as large as had been feared. Initially, after the fire, serious doubts were raised by various media over whether PKN Orlen would go through with the deal to buy the company (although these were immediately denied by Orlen representatives). In the end, the blaze did not stop the takeover from going ahead. Suspicions were raised by various high-profile persons as to whether the fire was an accident, or industrial sabotage on the part of the Russian energy companies in revenge for not being offered to buy the company. The vice-leader of the Russian Duma, Konstantin Kosachev, stated that \\"instability will continue to plague the refinery until the Lithuanians finally realize which partners one should choose\\" only a few hours before the start of the blaze.

Service 6203 was built at Crewe Works, being works number 253 of 1935, and being the third member of the class and first of the second batch. It was named Princess Margaret Rose after the then five- year-old daughter of Albert, Duke of York (later King George VI), Princess Margaret Rose, the younger sister of Queen Elizabeth II. The locomotive was used to haul the heaviest and fastest LMS passenger trains from London to north and northwest England and to Scotland. During its operational career it was allocated to Crewe North, Edge Hill (Liverpool), Kingmoor (Carlisle) and Polmadie (Glasgow) motive power depots. After nationalisation in 1948, British Railways renumbered it 46203, and it was withdrawn from service in 1962. Preservation After withdrawal, 46203 was bought by Billy Butlin of Butlins holiday camps and became one of two preserved Princesses, the other being 46201 Princess Elizabeth. After cosmetic restoration at Crewe, it was moved to Pwllheli in Gwynedd, arriving there in May 1963. It remained there until 1975 when it departed for the Midland Railway Centre (now Midland Railway - Butterley) in Derbyshire. Butlin sold the engine for ¬£60,000 in 1985 when restoration to working order started, being completed in 1990. It then operated on the UK mainline rail network for several years until 1996, hauling special charter trains. Since 1975, the locomotive has been based at the Midland Railway - Butterley in Derbyshire. It is owned by The Princess Royal Class Locomotive Trust and is on static display in the West Shed Museum pending a future restoration to working order when funds allow.

The university was granted accreditation by the National Accreditation Board of Ghana in 2001 under the mentorship of the University of Cape Coast and began classes in 2002. Ashesi students elected the first female university student government president in Ghana's history in 2006 and its first Examination Honour Code in 2008. Ashesi University completed a new campus in Berekuso in 2011. In 2015, Ashesi launched its engineering programme, and its founder, Patrick Awuah, became a MacArthur fellow. In 2018, it received a Charter from the President of Ghana, allowing it to grant degrees in its own name instead of that of the University of Cape Coast. Campus alt=The Todd & Ruth Warren Library at Ashesi Ashesi University's 100-acre campus in Berekuso overlooks the Ghanaian capital city of Accra. It contains the Natembea health centre, two sports courts and a sports centre with a football field, running track and gym. It also hosts the Ghana Climate Innovation Centre. The architecture borrows from the Ghanaian vernacular, with echoes of traditional compound houses, as well as elements of traditional Northern dwellings. The natural contours of the site are used in concert with buildings to create exterior gathering spaces throughout campus, as well as ramps that provide wheel chair access to buildings. Buildings are designed to maximize natural views, light and ventilation. Ground water is supplemented with harvested rainwater, filtered and treated to provide potable water all year round. A community-scale sewage and organic treatment plant provides environmental and economic benefits by converting waste to biogas for some of the campus‚Äô cooking needs and recycling treated water for landscaping. The University meets 40% of its daytime electrical needs with solar power. Organisation and governance Ashesi University has 85 faculty and approximately 316 total staff organised into the departments of Humanities and Social Sciences, Business Administration, Computer Science and Information Systems, and Engineering. The University is a subsidiary of the Ashesi University Foundation, a United States 501(c)(3) organization. The Foundation is overseen by its board of trustees, while the University is overseen by its board of directors. Academics and recognition Ashesi offers a four-year bachelors programme grounded in a multidisciplinary core curriculum, featuring majors in Business Administration, Management Information Systems, Computer Science, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Computer Engineering and Mechanical Engineering. It runs Ashesi Innovation Experience, a two-week programme which exposes students between the ages of 15 and 19 to Leadership, Entrepreneurship, Robotics, Creativity and Engineering basics to help prepare them for transitioning into college, and oversees the curriculum development for the Next Generation Cocoa Youth Programme. In 2012, the university was ranked by PwC as the seventh most respected organisation in Ghana, becoming the first university to make the list. Ashesi's president, Patrick Awuah, was also ranked the 4th Most Respected CEO in Ghana.UT Bank, Rlg bosses outshine rivals ‚Äìat Ghana‚Äôs Most Respected CEO awards. http://thechronicle.com.gh. October 2012. It was ranked as one of Ghana's 50 Best Places to work by Ghanaian consulting firm Goodman AMC in 2015; it was again the only university on the list. Also in that year, Ashesi's president was ranked by Fortune as one of the World's 50 Greatest Leaders. In 2017, Ashesi was awarded the World Innovation Summit in Education Prize, one of the world's biggest prizes in education, for its impact on higher education in Africa. In 2020, Ashesi University ranked first in Ghana, ninth in Africa, and in the world's top 400 in the Global Times Higher Education University Impact Rankings.

The term 'Dark Ages' is much used. Some groups define it as the period between the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, and the establishment of the main European Christian kingdoms - approx. 400 - 750 AD, whereas others include the Viking period as well (extending as far as 1066 AD). Some people call the later half of this period \\"Early Medieval\\". Most reenactment groups focus on a smaller time period, sometimes restricting their interest to a particular century, or even a specific decade, depending on how authentic the reenactment and encampment is intended to be. Typically Dark Ages reenactment groups focus on a specific time period and culture within this range, such as Vendel Age Vikings or the Picts.

Because no Division I-A recruiters were seeking him, Finn sought a Division I-AA program and committed with the University of Pennsylvania. College career Finn was a four-year letterman while playing college football at the University of Pennsylvania, where he accumulated 2,277 rushing yards, which ranks as the fourth-highest total in school history. He also scored 180 points for fifth on the all-time list. He was an All-Ivy League player as a senior and junior. In his senior season, Finn set school records for yards, rushing attempts, and rushing touchdowns. Penn first experimented with having Finn play both offense and defense on October 18, 1997, against Columbia. In that game, Finn ran for 138 yards on 24 carries including one touchdown for 15 yards but fumbled on Columbia's 3-yard line on a 50-yard run. With the 24-7 win, Penn beat Columbia for the first time since 1994. In addition to being named an All-Ivy Team member, Finn was named Player of the Year. He also holds school records for most rushing attempts, rushing yards, and touchdowns in a game. Before being converted permanently into a fullback, Finn briefly played as a safety, even starting a few games as a sophomore. While at Penn, Finn became a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity. Finn also attended the Wharton School at Penn and graduated with a degree in finance in 1999. Professional career =Pre-draft= =Playing history= Finn was drafted with the final pick (nicknamed Mr. Irrelevant) of the seventh round in the 1999 NFL Draft by the Chicago Bears, but was waived, and spent time on their practice squad. Finn signed with the Indianapolis Colts in early 2000, where he accumulated 44 yards in six rushing attempts and 10 receptions over three seasons. However, the Colts' offense specialized more with two tight ends rather than a fullback. In the spring of 2003, Finn signed with the New York Giants. \\"To have a career, Finn beat the odds. He was a lightly regarded player at Bergen Catholic High School in Oradell, N.J.

He has seen more action as a receiver out of the backfield, with 325 receiving yards and 42 receptions in his tenure with New York. In 2005, Finn played in all 16 regular season games with 13 starts including the NFC Wild Card Playoff against the Carolina Panthers. His blocks for Tiki Barber helped Barber rush for a franchise-record 1,860 yards. Finn was primarily a blocking fullback for the Giants. Finn led the way for Barber's 203 yards performance against the Oakland Raiders. Also in 2005, in Washington D.C. he once again opened holes for Barber in the star back's second 200+ yard performance. Barber had a third 200+ yard performance when he ran for 220 yards against the Kansas City Chiefs. Finn's season ended with 13 receptions for 98 yards, including the NFC Wild Card Game.

Retrieved 5 August 2013. also known by his signature S.T.G., was an English-born Australian artist. Early life Gill was born in Periton, Minehead, Somerset, England, in 1818. He was the son of the Reverend Samuel Gill, a Baptist minister, and his first wife, Winifred Oke. Rev. Gill became the headmaster of a school at Plymouth, where the son was first educated, then he continued to Dr Seabrook's Academy, Plymouth. Having moved to London, Gill appears to have exhibited his watercolours and worked as a draftsman at the Hubbard Public Gallery in London. Australia Osmund Gilles, 1849, S. T. Gill, P1/627 On 17 December 1839 Samuel Thomas Gill (or S.T. Gill) and his family arrived in Adelaide aboard the Caroline. His father Samuel Gill (snr.) settled at the Coromandel Valley, South Australia where he became the postmaster and opened a \\"Classical and Mathematical Preparatory School\\" for boys under twelve. His son S. T. Gill opened rooms at Gowler Place, Adelaide where he advertised portrait work and local scenery, \\"executed to order\\". One of the earlier works credited to Gill is a view of Hindley Street Adelaide, which was published as a coloured print 1844. His activities soon expanded to include street scenes and public events, including the newly discovered copper mines at Burra Burra and the departure of Charles Sturt's expedition for the interior on 8 October 1844. His sketching tours of the districts surrounding Adelaide, produced a number of watercolours. Gill was took an interest in photography ‚Äì ordering a daguerreotype camera and the other necessary equipment in 1846, and setting up as a professional photographer. With public interest in the new medium not forthcoming, Gill sold his camera to Robert Hall prior to his departure with John Horrocks' expedition northwards to the Flinders Ranges later in 1846. While on this expedition he made the first sketch of these ranges. Horrocks, the first settler of South Australia's Clare Valley, mounted a small expedition to search for suitable farming land in the country northwest of Mount Arden in the southern Flinders Ranges. This expedition was the first in Australia to use camels but even so ended after Horrocks accidentally discharged his gun and received a charge of shot in his face. Gill dressed the wounds but 'mortification set in' and the young explorer died forcing the party to return to Adelaide. Upon his return Gill organised an exhibition to sell the watercolours and pencil sketches of this fateful trip but sales appear to have been slow and he was eventually forced to raffle them. In 1849 he published Heads of the People, which contained 12 lithographic sketches of well-known South Australian colonists. Mt Alexander Gold Escort en-route to Melbourne, 1852, S. T. Gill - one of the \\"Sketches of the Victoria Gold Diggings and Diggers As They Are\\" In 1851 gold was discovered in Victoria and following a series of personal tragedies including bankruptcy and ill health, Gill joined a large group of South Australians heading for the Mount Alexander gold fields, Victoria. It is possible he tried his hand at gold-mining but presumably he had no luck as he was soon recording life on the gold fields and the emergence of substantial towns like those of Ballarat and Bendigo. By August 1852 he had published a set of 24 lithographs of \\"Sketches of the Victoria Gold Diggings and Diggers As They Are\\". Although they were described as \\"Part 1\\", no further parts were published. Late in 1852 Gill moved to Melbourne where his exhibition of sketches and watercolours from the goldfields attracted so much attention that a firm of lithographers, Messrs. Macartney and Galbraith, later succeeded by J. S. Campbell and Co., engaged Gill to reproduce the works on lithographic stone. The results were so successful that the entire set was republished in London. In February 1853, he exhibited some watercolour drawings made from sketches done on the Horrocks expedition. The King of Terrors and his Satellites, Samuel Thomas Gill, 1850‚Äì1880, from original watercolour, DG SV*/Sp Coll/Gill/11. By 1854 Gill had taken residence in Melbourne and aside from a year in Sydney lived there for the rest of his life. Here he worked for the booksellers and publishers J. J. Blundell and Co. and had a studio above their premises in Collins Street. Blundell's son Mr. Blundell recalls that in 1853 Gill used this studio to work his designs directly on stone using a glass to aid him in the necessary reversals. The stones were then sent to Campbell and Fergusson's workshop a few doors away, where the reproduction work was carried out, and the resulting prints were returned to Blundell and Co. bearing the names of the both the lithographer and publisher. He also produced works for Messrs' Sands and Kenny and over this period he produced a number of lithographs on stone as well as works engraved on copper and steel. At the height of this success Gill decided to move to Sydney where he worked on the publication of views of New South Wales, and a Kangaroo hunt, with Allen and Wigley. But by 1857 he was back in Melbourne providing designs for Sands and Kenny's elaborate Victoria Illustrated. Gill's skill as a lithographer resulted in the production of a number of works during this period. These included: The Australian Sketch Book (1855), Scenery in and Around Sydney (1856), Victoria Illustrated (1857), Sketches in Victoria (1860), Second Series of Victoria Illustrated (1862), and a set of coloured lithographs, Bush Life (1865). In 1859 Mr. Edward Wilson selected Gill to illustrate his book, Rambles in the Antipodes. He also procured a major commission from the Trustees of the Melbourne Public Library in 1869, to reproduce 40 of his earlier watercolours of life on the Victorian goldfields. At the same time as the Melbourne Public Library commission, Gill prepared a largely identical set of 53 watercolours under the title drawing of The Goldfields of Victoria During 1852‚Äì53. Comprising Fifty Sketches of Life and Character Primative (sic) Operations etc, etc., By S.T. Gill Melbourne, 1872. By the end of the 1860s Gill was at the height of his success and appears to have indulged in the many temptations on offer in Melbourne and Sydney at this time. He frequented the resorts of the bohemians of the day such as Cafe de Paris, Charlie Wright's dancing-rooms, the bars of the Theatre Royal or Stutt's Buffet. Unfortunately Gill appears to have fallen into a dissolute life of drink and the demand for his work started to fall off. Over the latter part of his life he was often destitute and even bartered his sketches for drinks at his favourite watering holes like the Mitre Tavern. Gill's last commissions was given to him by the architect, Mr. Arthur Peck. On 27 October 1880, Gill was adding embellishments to the perspective view of a building. But according to the report in The Sun his hands shook to such an extent that the architect mistrusted his fitness for holding a brush and put him off until the following day. Gill wandered out into the Melbourne streets but clearly his health by this time was broken through drink and syphilis, and as he tried to climb the steps of the Melbourne Post Office he collapsed and died from an aneurism of the aorta.\\" In 1880 he was buried in a pauper's grave. In 1913 a tombstone was erected over his remains at the suggestion of Mr. A. W. Greig, and thanks to a subscription raised by the Historical Society of Victoria. The stone bears the simple inscription: \\"Samuel Thomas Gill, The artist of the Goldfields. Born 1818. Died 1880\\".

It ran in newspapers from 1944 to 1964. After marriage, she usually signed her name Theresa H. D‚ÄôAlessio. In 1950, she became the first woman allowed to join the National Cartoonists Society. Biography Born Theresa Hilda Fellman in Newburyport, Massachusetts, she was the daughter of a man who lettered roulette wheels. She admired the sports cartoons of Willard Mullin, wanted to become a sports cartoonist and spent time sketching at sports events. She arrived in New York when she was 17 and spent two years working as a waitress at Schrafft's. During the mid-1930s, she reconsidered her career plan after she entered both a sports cartoon and a funny cartoon in a newspaper contest, winning a prize with the funny cartoon. While working as a waitress, she studied art at the Art Students League. One of her teachers there was Gregory d'Alessio, and they married in 1938. She was signed by King Features Syndicate to create a feature comic strip, It's A Girl's Life, which would soon become Teena, the strip for which she is most well-known. The strip premiered December 7, 1941, and ran until 1964. She also won a contest and a $100 war bond for the best \\"Waste-not\\" cartoon sponsored by the Office of War Information and the War Production Board in 1943. She led an active life during the late 1940s, serving as a Camp Fire guardian, a Blue Bird leader, a Horizon Club advisor and an American Youth Hosteler, once leading a group of girls on a ten-day bicycle trip through New England. Comics historian Tom Spurgeon detailed how she broke through barriers at the once all-male National Cartoonists Society in 1950: :Terry was early on a magazine cartoonist, and is said to have placed work in such high-profile outlets as The Saturday Evening Post and The New Yorker. Terry's work on Teena displays the clarity and precision of magazine-style cartooning, which must have helped it stand out, particularly in its initial years when a more decorative style was still on display in several features. Teena was a King Features strip, and was licensed briefly to comic books (at Standard) as well. Terry was a member of the Art Students League of New York, where she met her future husband Gregory d'Alessio, who preceded Terry in death. In 1949, d'Alessio submitted his wife's name for membership in the then all-male National Cartoonists Society, putting her on the ballot with magazine cartoonist Barbara Shermund. She was admitted a year later after much debate, and immediately set about bringing more female cartoonists into the fold. She later became an award-winning animator and pioneering contributor to sports-stadium animations, and pursued a variety of personal interests until her death. Once she was a member of the NCS, she proposed Gladys Parker and other women cartoonists for memberships. Animation She drew portraits of ballplayers for baseball stadium scoreboards in the early 1970s and subsequently became a pioneer in early computer animation. She traveled from city to city to create her giant animated portraits of major league players and team mascots.Robbins, Trina and Catherine Yronwode. Women and the Comics. Eclipse Books, 1985. She was the animation artist for the Kansas City Royals Baseball Club. Books Sketches of Hilda Terry by her husband, Gregory d'Alessio In the 1970s, Terry collaborated with the controversial ex-Communist artist, actor and producer Harvey Matusow on Matusow's self-published book, The Babysitter's Magic Mouse Storybook. \\"Some people wanted to revive the Magic Mouse stories\\", Terry said, \\"and he wanted me to illustrate them with my teenagers, from when young girls were more innocent. Teena started as a babysitter during World War II.\\"8 Henderson Place D'Alessio, who was men's president of the Art Students League, died in 1994. Even into her eighties and nineties, Terry continued her teaching at the Art Students League. Fascinated with the Salem witch trials (and despite the fact that she was Jewish), Terry expressed her belief that she was the reincarnation of Dorcas Good, a four-year-old child who was imprisoned with her accused mother, Sarah Good, who was later executed. Terry wrote about this double life and her approach to art in her self-published autobiography, Strange Bod Fellows (1992).\\"Forgotten Has-Beens.\\" Hilda Terry Art & Artist File, Smithsonian American Art Museum/National Portrait Gallery Library, Smithsonian Libraries, Washington, D.C.

It is native to mainland Europe (not the British Isles) and Turkey, growing in dry pastures, stony places and open woods and flowering in early summer. In Sweden the northernmost stable populations grows along the rocky shores of Lake Sommen (58¬∞ N), albeit on occasions it has been found as far north as Uppland (60¬∞ N). Etymology The specific epithet liliago means lily-like or lily-carrier. Like many plants whose common names include \\"lily\\", it is not closely related to the true lilies. Description It is a vigorous herbaceous flowering perennial with tuberous roots, high, with leaves narrowly linear, . and producing racemes of 6-10 lily-like white flowers in Spring and Summer. Cultivation Best grown in well-drained soil in a sunny position, A. liliago can be propagated by seed or by division of the rootstock every 3 to 4 years. It is a slow starter but forms large clumps with time (USDA Zone 6). The cultivar ‚ÄòMajor‚Äô has gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit.

At the end of the show, \\"millionaire\\" Rick Rockwell chose Conger to be his wife and married her on the spot. In addition to being wed to Rockwell, Conger also won a 3-carat (600 mg) diamond ring and more than $100,000 in prizes.

Having obtained an advance copy of the book, The New York Times published a review on September 15, 2011, writing that it \\"offers a portrait of a White House operating under intense pressure as it dealt with a cascade of crises, from insolvent banks to collapsing carmakers. And it details the rivalries among figures around the president,\\" including economic advisor Lawrence Summers; Treasury secretary Timothy F. Geithner; former chief of staff Rahm Emanuel; and budget director Peter R. Orszag. The following day, the Washington Post elaborated on the content of the book, citing the allegation that Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner ignored a directive from the president to draw up plans for restructuring Citibank in the spring of 2009. The article also notes that in an interview in the book, Geithner denies the account saying \\"I don't slow-walk the president on anything\\". The White House pushed back against the book in spite of having granted Ron Suskind an interview with the president, with communications director Dan Pfeiffer saying that books like these ‚Äútend to take the normal day-to-day activities of governing and infuse them with drama, palace intrigue and salacious details‚Äù. While some faulted Suskind for giving greater credence to the views of sources who gave him more journalistic access others praised him for doing the opposite. In his New York Times book review, Joe Nocera wrote ‚Äúto his everlasting credit, Suskind savages several people he clearly spent time interviewing, starting with Obama‚Äôs former chief economic adviser, Larry Summers, and Timothy Geithner, his Treasury secretary. And he‚Äôs more than willing to step outside his re-created scenes to conduct interviews, in which Obama aides and allies tell truths that are genuinely painful to hear.‚Äù Confidence Men was released on September 20, 2011. In his first television appearance, on the Today Show, Suskind was interviewed by anchor Ann Curry who cited the White House pushback in her questioning, with Suskind maintaining that the book represented an accurate depiction of what he had found in his reporting. Hendrik Hertzberg wrote in his review of the book for The New Yorker that the book would offer ‚Äúsupport for some of today‚Äôs standard progressive gripes about the President‚Äù being stymied by his conservative, Wall Street-attentive advisers, ‚Äúand for a few of the conservative ones,‚Äù namely assertions that Obama arrived in office unprepared to lead. In his review of the book for The New York Times, Joe Nocera noted that the book had ‚Äúan omniscient quality‚Äù of fly-on-the-wall scenes from inside the White House, much like the books of Bob Woodward, but ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt really go for phony omniscience‚Äù where the sources who are most cooperative are rendered most favorably. In a New Republic review, John B. Judis wrote, \\"Suskind‚Äôs book is being widely portrayed as critical of the Obama administration, but if you read the entire book, its message is that during Obama‚Äôs first two years he was foiled by his own inexperience as a manager and by a staff that didn‚Äôt do good by him, but that after the Democratic defeat in 2010 he learned from his failure.\\" Both Summers and Geithner, who offered extensive responses to key disclosures in the book‚Äôs pages, pushed back hard against their characterizations after publication. A week after publication, the book debuted at #2 on the New York Times Bestseller list for Nonfiction. According to the book President Obama supported a financial transaction tax on trades of stocks, derivatives, and other financial instruments, but he was blocked by Summers.

Most of the hills are around to high and are popular spots for hikers in the area. The highest point is Tosson Hill at . There are several single pitch rock climbing crags dotted along the hillside, notably Simonside North Face and Ravensheugh. Etymology In a document dated to 1279 Simonside was called Simundessete. By 1580 the name had become Simontside. The name may be a corruption of Sigemund's seat or Sigemund's settlement. Sigemund or Sigmund is the name of an old Germanic hero from the Volsunga Saga and the Nibelungenlied who is mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf. WW Tomlinson, in his Comprehensive Guide To Northumberland (1916), stated that \\"Simon of mythology was, it seems, a domestic brewer to King Arthur, identical with the German Sigmund, and very fond of killing dragons\\". This points to the possibility that the Simon of Simonside Hill is the Sigemund mentioned in Beowulf and subsequently Norse and Teutonic myths. It is worth noting that in Scandinavia and Germany, Sigmund is not generally associated with dragon- slaying, his son Sigurd or Siegfried is. His killing of a dragon was mentioned in Beowulf, however. An alternative derivation for the name is a corruption of \\"seaman's sight\\", allegedly because the hills are visible from the North Sea. . This is almost certainly false etymology, however, as the word (ge)sete means seat or settlement and not sight. The Old English word for sight is gesiht and the old English for seaman is s√¶manna and thus Seaman's Sight (or \\"S√¶mannas(ge)siht\\") is unlikely to have become Simundessete in Middle English. Folklore In Northumbrian folklore, malicious dwarves, often called duergar, are said to attack walkers in the hills or lead them astray, especially at night. The Duergar Nightcrawler is an annual 10 mile winter nighttime trail run in the Simonside Hills celebrating this folklore. Their advice, should you see the Duergar, is \\"run\\". Geodesy Up to 1919 one of the hills of Simonside was the origin (meridian) of the 6 inch and 1:2500 Ordnance Survey maps of Northumberland. After that the maps of Northumberland were drawn according to the meridian of Brandon Down in Durham.https://www.charlesclosesociety.org/files/153Meridians.pdf See also *Billsmoor Park and Grasslees Wood SSSI *High Cove References *Grice, F, Folk Tales of the North Country (Thomas Nelson & Sons Ltd, London & Edinburgh, 1944) pp130‚Äì133 External links *From the Northumbrian Mountaineering Club *Grice's version of the story of \\"The Duergar\\" *Simonside Folklore Hills of Northumberland Northumbrian folklore Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Northumberland Special Areas of Conservation in England ","title":"Simonside Hills"},{"id":"2986521","text":"The city of Abaetetuba is located in Par√° State, Brazil.

Life and career He was educated at Stowe School, Buckingham, and read history at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he was a pupil, then a friend, of the historian A.J.P. Taylor. During World War II he served in the Royal Air Force as a bomber pilot. Flying the Handley Page Hampden he was shot down by flak while on a night mine-laying mission off the coast of German-occupied Holland. He was captured and spent three years in a German POW camp. This gave him material for his first book, A Crowd Is Not Company. It was first published as a novel in 1947, but was later revealed to be an autobiography. It recounts his experiences as a prisoner of war and his various escapes from the Nazi camp. The Times describes it as \\"arguably the best POW book ever written.\\" His career in journalism began immediately after the Second World War. He worked for the Picture Post, then became a special correspondent for The Sunday Times and, later, The Observer. He was also literary editor of The Spectator. In 1948, Kee co-founded publishing house MacGibbon & Kee with James MacGibbon. In 1949 Kee was a witness at the marriage of his friend George Orwell to Sonia Brownell. In 1958 he moved into television. He appeared for many years on both the BBC and ITV as a reporter, interviewer and presenter. He presented many current affairs programmes, including Panorama, ITN's First Report and Channel 4's Seven Days. MacGibbon & Kee was bought by Granada in 1968. He was awarded the BAFTA Richard Dimbleby Award in 1976. Kee wrote and presented the documentary series Ireland ‚Äì A Television History in 1980. The work was shown both in the United Kingdom and the United States and won the Christopher Ewart-Biggs Memorial Prize.

Holmqvist et al. (Eds). Walter de Gruyter: Berlin, Germany. pp 349‚Äì397.  SEQUAL framework topics  Modeling is an integral part of many technical fields, including engineering, economics, and software engineering. In this context, a model is a formal representation of an organizational system, such as a business model or a formal description of software in UML. = Model activation = Model activation, according to John Krogstie (2006), is the process by which a model affects reality. Model activation involves actors interpreting the model and to some extent adjusting their behaviour accordingly. This process can be: * automated, where a software component interprets the model, * manual, where the model guides the actions of human actors, or * interactive, where prescribed aspects of the model are automatically interpreted and ambiguous parts are left to the users to resolve. = Sets in the Quality Framework = The Quality Framework works with a set of eight items: * A: Actors that develop or have to relate to (parts of) the model. Can be persons or tools. * L: What can be expressed in the modeling language * M: What is expressed in the model * D: What can be expressed about the domain (area of interest) * K: The explicit knowledge of the participating persons * I: What the persons in the audience interpret the model to say * T: What relevant tools interpret the model to say * G: The goals of the modeling = Physical quality = The three main aspects of physical quality are: * Externalization or the question \\"Is it possible to externalize knowledge by using the model language?\\", * Internalizability about model persistence and availability, and * Basically or the question \\"Is the model language able to express the model domain?\\" Externalization is presenting the modeller's concept in some model form for others to make sense of it. Other people can have look on it and can discuss. How other people perceives the model is a matter of internalization. After perceiving the model in their own way they can discuss and change their mind accordingly. To make sense others, it is better to have some model language in common. Physical quality refers to the possibility of externalizing models by using model language that should be available and of course in persistence manner to be internalized by audiences. How available is the model to audience? Availability depends on distributability, especially when members of the audience are geographically dispersed. Then, a model which is an electronically distributable format will be more easily distributed than one which must be printed on paper and sent by ordinary mail or fax. It may also matter exactly what is distributed, e.g. the model in an editable form or merely in an output format. How persistent is the model, how protected is it against loss or damage? This also includes previous versions of the model, if these are relevant. E.g. for a model on disk, the physical quality will be higher if there is a backup copy, or even higher if this backup is on another disk whose failure is independent of the originals. Similarly, for models on paper, the amount and security of backup copies will be essential. =Empirical quality= To evaluate empirical quality, the model should be well externalized. Main aspects are: * Ergonomics, * readability, * layout, and * information theory. Basically empirical quality is about the question \\"Is the model easily readable?\\". Empirical quality deals with the variety of elements distinguished, error frequencies when being written or read, coding (shapes of boxes) and ergonomics for Computer-Human Interaction for documentation and modeling-tools. Ergonomics is the study of workplace design and the physical and psychological impact it has on workers. This quality is related to readability and layout. There are different factors that have an important impact on visual emphasis like size, solidity, foreground/background differences, colour (red attracts the eye more than other colours),change(blinking or moving symbols attract attention), position and so on. For graph aesthetics there may be different consideration(Battista, 1994, Tamassia, 1988) like angles between edges not be too small, minimize the number of bends along edges, minimize the number of crossings between edges, place nodes with high degree in the centre of the drawing, have symmetry of sons in hierarchies, have uniform density of nodes in the drawing, have verticality of hierarchical structures and so on. =Syntactical quality= Syntactic quality is the correspondence between the model M and the language extension L of the language in which the model is written. Three aspects here are: * Error detection: During a modeling session, some syntactical errors--- syntactic incompleteness --- should be allowed on a temporary basis. For instance, although the DFD language requires that all processes are linked to a flow, it is difficult to draw a process and a flow simultaneously. Syntactical completeness has to be checked upon user's request. So, in contrast to implicit checks where the tool is \`\`forcing the user to follow the language syntax, explicit check can only detect and report on existing errors. The user has to make the corrections. * Error correction: to replace a detected error with a correct statement =Semantic quality= What is expressed in the model? The semantic goals of this framework are: * Validity; if all the statements in the model are correct and related to the problem. M\\\\D = √ò * Completeness; if the model contains all relevant and correct statements to solve this problem. D\\\\M = √ò =Perceived semantic quality= Perceived semantic quality is the relation between an actor's interpretation of a model and his/her knowledge of the domain. * Perceived validity I\\\\K = √ò * Perceived completeness K\\\\I = √ò =Pragmatic quality= Pragmatic quality is the correspondence between the model and people's interpretation of it. Comprehension is the only pragmatic goal in the framework. It is very important that people that read the model, understand it. No solution is good if no-one understands it. Pragmatic quality relates to the effect the model have on the participants and the world. Four aspects is treated specifically, that: * the human interpretation of the model is correct relative to what is meant. * the tool interpretation is correct relative to what is meant to be expressed in the model. * the participants learn based on the model. * the domain is changed (preferably in a positive direction relative to the goal of modeling). = Social quality = The goal for the social quality is agreement. Agreement about knowledge, interpretation and model. Agreement is achieved if perceived semantic quality and comprehension are achieved. There is relative agreement and absolute agreement. For the three agreement parts (knowledge, interpretation and model) we can define: * Relative agreement in the three above agreement types; all Knowledge, Interpretation and Model are consistent. * Absolute agreement in the three above agreement types; all Knowledge, Interpretation and Model are equal. = Knowledge quality = Degree of internalization of existing organizational reality. * Knowledge in domain is \\"complete\\": D\\\\K = √ò. * Knowledge in domain is \\"valid\\": K\\\\D = √ò. Activities for improvement: * Stakeholder identification * Knowledge source identification * Research and investigation * Participant selection * Participant training * Problem definition =Language quality= To receive good language quality it is important that: * The language is appropriate to the domain. * The language is appropriate to the participants' knowledge of modeling languages * The language appropriate to express the knowledge of the participants If the language quality is good, it will improve the participants' interpretation and other technical actors' interpretation. For additional detail, see the quality of modelling languages =Organizational quality= The organizational quality of the model relates to: * That all statements in the model contribute to fulfilling the goals of modeling, or Organizational goal validity. * That all the goals of modeling are addressed through the model, or Organizational goal completeness.  Alternative quality framework  An alternative quality framework is the Guidelines of Modeling (GoM) based on general accounting principles. The framework \\"include the six principles of correctness, clarity, relevance, comparability, economic efficiency, and systematic design\\". It was operationalized for Event-driven Process Chains and also tested in experiments J. Becker, M. Rosemann, and C. von Uthmann. (2000). \\"Guidelines of Business Process Modeling\\". In: W.M.P. van der Aalst et al. editors, Business Process Management. Models, Techniques, and Empirical Studies, Springer, Berlin et al. Pp. 30-49. Another alternative modelling process quality framework actually based on SEQUAL is the \\"Quality of Modelling\\" framework (QoMo). QoMo is still a \\"preliminary modelling process oriented, based on knowledge state transitions, cost of the activities bringing such transitions about, and a goal structure for activities-for- modelling. Such goals are directly linked to concepts of SEQUAL\\".Patrick van Bommel et al. (2007). \\"QoMo: A Modelling Process Quality Framework based on SEQUAL\\".

In fact, when the spaces are \\\\sigma-finite, the product measure is uniquely defined, and for every measurable set E, :(\\\\mu_1 \\\\times \\\\mu_2)(E) = \\\\int_{X_2} \\\\mu_1(E^y)\\\\,d\\\\mu_2(y) = \\\\int_{X_1} \\\\mu_2(E_{x})\\\\,d\\\\mu_1(x), where E_x = \\\\\\\\{y \\\\in X_2  (x, y) \\\\in E\\\\\\\\} and E^y = \\\\\\\\{x \\\\in X_1  (x, y) \\\\in E\\\\\\\\}, which are both measurable sets. The existence of this measure is guaranteed by the Hahn‚ÄìKolmogorov theorem. The uniqueness of product measure is guaranteed only in the case that both (X_1, \\\\Sigma_1, \\\\mu_1) and (X_2, \\\\Sigma_2, \\\\mu_2) are œÉ-finite. The Borel measures on the Euclidean space Rn can be obtained as the product of n copies of Borel measures on the real line R. Even if the two factors of the product space are complete measure spaces, the product space may not be. Consequently, the completion procedure is needed to extend the Borel measure into the Lebesgue measure, or to extend the product of two Lebesgue measures to give the Lebesgue measure on the product space. The opposite construction to the formation of the product of two measures is disintegration, which in some sense \\"splits\\" a given measure into a family of measures that can be integrated to give the original measure. Examples *Given two measure spaces, there is always a unique maximal product measure Œºmax on their product, with the property that if Œºmax(A) is finite for some measurable set A, then Œºmax(A) = Œº(A) for any product measure Œº. In particular its value on any measurable set is at least that of any other product measure. This is the measure produced by the Carath√©odory extension theorem. *Sometimes there is also a unique minimal product measure Œºmin, given by Œºmin(S) = supA‚äÇS, Œºmax(A) finite Œºmax(A), where A and S are assumed to be measurable. *Here is an example where a product has more than one product measure. Take the product X√óY, where X is the unit interval with Lebesgue measure, and Y is the unit interval with counting measure and all sets measurable. Then for the minimal product measure the measure of a set is the sum of the measures of its horizontal sections, while for the maximal product measure a set has measure infinity unless it is contained in the union of a countable number of sets of the form A√óB, where either A has Lebesgue measure 0 or B is a single point. (In this case the measure may be finite or infinite.) In particular, the diagonal has measure 0 for the minimal product measure and measure infinity for the maximal product measure.

Examples of playware products are numerous with computer games as the most widespread and successful, but it is a fast-growing industry utilizing pervasive and ambient technology to create new kinds of play equipment and toys, which can be labelled ‚Äúplayware‚Äù. The term playware was coined by Carsten Jessen, Associate Professor at the Technical University of Denmark and the Danish School of Education, Aarhus University, and Henrik Hautop Lund, a professor at the Technical University of Denmark. They first defined the term in their paper \\"Playware ‚Äì Intelligent technology for children‚Äôs play\\" to describe both a new area of research and a product type. Jessen and Lund argue that the playware is not so much the result of the appearance of digital technology as it is the result of many children (and adults) in modern society not having the necessary knowledge and skills needed to initiate games and play. Earlier generations of children inherited games and learned play skills from older peers when participating in cross-age activities, for instance on the street or in the backyard. This is not to the same extent the case today and according to Jessen and Lund this has led to the need for inspiration from playware. Several international playware workshops and symposiums were given and held amongst leading playware and human-robot interaction researchers, such as the keynote talk on modular playware at the 18th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication, and the Playware Summit in Copenhagen 2010, where amongst others Y. Sankai, H. Ishiguro, C. Breazeal, T. Fukuda, T. Shibata, K. Dautenhahn, P. Marti, N. Pares, L. Pagliarini, H. Hautop Lund gathered to set a new research agenda for future research and development in playware ().

The episode features Tim Russ in a minor role, before he played the role of Tuvok on Star Trek: Voyager. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, while the Enterprise is evacuated for maintenance, Captain Picard must, alone, contend with thieves posing as a work crew aboard the ship. The process is vaguely similar to ship degaussing but with a dangerous science fiction twist. Plot The Federation starship Enterprise is docked at the Remmler Array to be decontaminated through the use of a baryon sweep, harmless to the inorganic materials of the ship but deadly to living beings. The ship is evacuated to the array's base and its systems shut down in preparation for the sweep. Captain Picard and the rest of the senior staff are invited by the base's commanding officer, Commander Calvin Hutchinson, to a cocktail party, but Picard foresees that he will be cornered by Hutchinson's \\"small talk\\" during the event. He returns to the Enterprise to retrieve his riding saddle to go horse riding instead, but on leaving finds an array technician working with the ship's panels. Picard tries to find out what the technician is doing, but he is attacked instead; Picard gains the upper hand and knocks the technician out. Meanwhile, at the cocktail party, Enterprise Chief Engineer La Forge detects strange readings coming from one of the centerpieces with his VISOR. Before he can investigate, the other array staff members take the partygoers as hostages, injuring La Forge and killing Hutchinson. They prevent them from communicating with the rest of the crew or Starfleet while the sweep is initiated. The crew stealthily work to devise a plan to break free of their captors. Aboard the Enterprise, Picard discovers that a small force of technicians, led by a woman named Kelsey, are aboard attempting to steal trilithium resin from the warp engines to sell to another group as part of a powerful explosive. He is captured but escapes. With the baryon sweep progressing forward through the ship, Picard plays a game of cat- and-mouse with the technicians while staying ahead. At one point, a terrible scream indicates that one of the technicians was caught in the baryon field. Eventually having neutralized all but Kelsey, Picard retreats to Ten-Forward, the last area that will be hit by the sweep. Kelsey manages to beam away to a waiting ship. Picard repeatedly hails the base to deactivate the baryon sweep. The Enterprise officers, having managed to overcome their captors by an elaborate ruse involving Geordi's VISOR, are able to stop the sweep just in time to save Picard's life. Data informs Picard of a shuttle trying to escape. Picard, having taken the control rod from the trilithium's storage container during his fight with Kelsey, states that they will not get far as the trilithium explodes, destroying the shuttle. Casting Tim Russ, as the rogue technician Devor, made his first appearance in the Star Trek franchise in \\"Starship Mine\\". He had previously been an alternate choice for the part of Geordi La Forge at the start of the series, but LeVar Burton was chosen instead by Gene Roddenberry. Russ subsequently auditioned on multiple occasions for parts in episodes, and was again considered for a main role in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Following his appearance in \\"Starship Mine\\", he appeared as a Klingon in the Deep Space Nine episode \\"Invasive Procedures\\" and as an unnamed Ensign in the film Star Trek Generations before landing the role of Tuvok in the main cast of Star Trek: Voyager. David Spielberg is cast as party-host Hutchinson. Reception In 2011, TV/A.V. Club gave the episode a B rating, noting its action plot and focus on Picard, as he must reclaim his starship. In 2012, Tor.com praised David Spielberg's performance as Hutchinson, especially the scene between Data (played by Brent Spiner) and Hutchinson. They also praised actress-stuntwoman Patricia Tallman for her presentation of Kiros. Overall they rated the episode 6 out 10, noting not just the Picard action sequences but also the many smaller lines of dialogue and details of the episode. In 2017, Radio Times ranked \\"Starship Mine\\" the 3rd best episode of Star Trek for rookie trek watchers. The episode has been compared to the 1988 American action film \\"Die Hard\\". In 2017, Popular Mechanics said that \\"Starship Mine\\" was one of the top ten most fun episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation, noting that Captain Picard must save his ship as he races against the clock. In 2018, Popular Mechanics, highlighted \\"Starship Mine\\" as one of the 12 best Captain Picard episodes, and as recommended viewing for audiences to prepare for a new television series based on that character, Star Trek: Picard. In 2018, Entertainment Weekly, ranked \\"Starship Mine\\" as one of the top ten moments of Jean-Luc Picard. In 2018, Tom's Guide rated \\"Starship Mine\\" one of the 15 best episodes featuring Picard. In 2019, Den of Geek recommended rewatching this episode as background for Star Trek: Picard. In 2020, Primetimer ranked this one of the top ten episodes for the character Jean-Luc Picard, the captain of the Enterprise 1701-D. In 2020, Games Radar noted \\"Starship Mine\\" as key episode to watch before Star Trek: Picard, pointing out that Picard must thwart terrorists trying to make off with the Enterprise 1701-D's trilithium resin and calling it \\"Die Hard in Jefferies Tube\\" (referencing a 1980s action movie). In 2020, Looper listed this one of the best episodes for Jean-Luc Picard.  Releases  The episode was released as part of the Star Trek: The Next Generation season six DVD box set in the United States on December 3, 2002. A remastered HD version was released on Blu-ray optical disc, on June 24, 2014. An example of a broadcast television release was on April 4, 1993, when the episode aired at 5:30 PM, with the television guide noting that \\"Thieves posing as technicians trap Picard as lethal rays bombard the Enterprise.\\" References * Star Trek The Next Generation DVD set, volume 6, disc 5, selection 2.

Formerly, known as the \\"Ghetto,\\" the Student Neighborhood houses includes an arrangement that resembles both traditional university housing and a landlord/tenant relationship. Tracing its history back to the 1870s, the neighborhood now includes more than 200 university-owned houses as well as landlord-owned houses, high-density housing and gathering spaces. With the inclusion of Holy Angels and The Darkside, or officially \\"the North Student Neighborhood,\\" two smaller neighborhoods the university owns property in, there are more than 400 houses currently used as student residential space. Because of the area's age, the university has been engaged in a program to renovate and update the houses, and several additional changes to the neighborhood are expected in the coming years as part of the university's Master Plan. History and geography Dayton's Student Neighborhood is south of downtown Dayton but north of the city of Oakwood. The Great Miami River is just more than half a mile to the west, and Interstate 75 is just more than a mile to the west. In its current form, it is bounded by Brown Street to the west, Irving Avenue to the south, Trinity Avenue and Evanston Avenue to the east, and Caldwell Street and Stonemill Road to the north. This gives the area a roughly triangular shape. The land on which the Neighborhood sits was owned by John Henry Patterson until the mid-1870s. The land was then divided between suburban housing lots to the east and the NCR factory to the west.Szink, Jennie and Peter Blazunas. \\"What's in a name?\\" Flyer News. Volume 54, Issue 35. March 27, 2007. The original proprietors of the neighborhood were Thomas S. Babbitt, Dr. Joseph E. Lowes, R. D. Hughes and Harry Kiefaber. The area was known as the town of Babbitt, and in its original form included only four streets: Lowes Street, Kiefaber Street, Hughes (now Stonemill Road) and Wead (now Lawnview Avenue). This core area was measured at .Pham, HaQuyen. \\"Deep roots lead to long, storied past.\\" Flyer News. Volume 52, Issue 33. March 8, 2005. The NCR Corporation used Babbitt as housing for its workers. In 1906, the area was annexed by the city of Dayton and continued on as a middle-class neighborhood. The University of Dayton, Babbitt's neighbor to the northeast, began to buy available houses in the neighborhood in the 1950s as an experiment in off- campus housing. By the 1970s, the student population of the area was growing rapidly. While it is unknown when the area began its life as the Ghetto, there have been several efforts to rename it. In the 1960s, Rev. Norbert Burns, who taught at the university for 62 years before retiring in 2007 at the age of 82,Tiedge, Amy. \\"Well-known professor to retire after 62 years.\\" Flyer News. Volume 54, Issue 35. March 27, 2007. was part of one such effort. His committee attempted to change the name to the \\"Village,\\" an effort which ultimately failed. University administrators now refer to the area as the \\"Student Neighborhood,\\" as the phrase \\"Ghetto\\" is offenseive to many sudents and faculty at the school. Recent changes 227 and 231 Irving Avenue, two of the new five-person houses in the Ghetto. As the houses in the Ghetto age, and as the number of students wishing to live in the Ghetto expands, the university has begun a renovation and replacement program with the goal of keeping the current feel of the area intact. In 2000, construction began on several new duplexes to fill land that was unused, resulting in housing for several dozen additional students. The duplexes housed six students per side, for a total of 12 students each.Gruenke, Jessica. \\"New duplexes planned to alleviate housing shortage.\\" Flyer News. Volume 48, Issue 20. December 8, 2000. In 2003, the university continued the project by tearing down several houses on Stonemill Road and replacing them with a new five-person design.Dowell, Matt. \\"Houses to be built on Stonemill.\\" Flyer News. Volume 50, Issue 34. March 7, 2003. Several more of these houses have now been built throughout the Ghetto. In 2006, the university began a new phase of replacement and renovation in the neighborhood, in which $2.5 million was spent to renovate four existing structures, including a duplex, as well as to build a five-unit set of attached townhouses. The houses, located on Frericks Way and Stonemill Road, house 55 students and include the famous \\"Castle\\" which has been given a new faux-stone facade in homage to its traditional name. The houses became available to students for the 2007 ‚Äì 2008 academic year. The new wave of construction brings the university's stock of houses to 328, including several duplexes. Not including these new additions, as of 2005, the university owned 225 houses in the Ghetto, with the rest on the Darkside, the other half of the University of Dayton campus. Additionally, 73 houses in the neighborhood were owned by private landlords and rented to UD students.Martin, Jerry. \\"Neighborhood gives spice to UD life.\\" Flyer News. Volume 52, Issue 34. March 11, 2005. The newest building in the South Student Neighborhood is currently under construction on the corner of Frericks and Lowes Streets. The building standing there previously, the McGinnis Center was demolished, and the new construction will be called the Adele Center, after one of the co-founding Marianist women, Mother Adele de Bats de Trenquell√©on, that the University of Dayton reveres https://udayton.edu/news/articles/2017/11/new_residence_hall_to_honor_marianist_founder_mother_adele.php. The $11.2 million apartment building will feature 96 new living spaces for upperclassmen students, with a first-floor front desk, office space, and other multipurpose spaces to serve the university https://www.bizjournals.com/dayton/news/2017/11/15/ud-names-new-student- residence-hall.html. The building is set to open in the fall of 2018. Holy Angels and the Darkside 116 Chambers Street, a house on the Darkside In addition to the properties the university owns in the Ghetto, there are also student houses located in two other neighborhoods: the Darkside‚Äîor North Student Neighborhood, as it is referred to by the university‚Äîand Holy Angels, also known as \\"College Park.\\" Once considered a single neighborhood and connected by the north-south Alberta Street, the areas were separated when the Thomas J. Frericks Center and a new formal entrance were added. Alberta Street now acts as the main thoroughfare for the Darkside, while the street has been rerouted and renamed College Park Avenue in the Holy Angels/College Park neighborhood. It is cut off from the portion in the Ghetto, renamed Frericks Way. The Darkside, which derives its name from a lack of street lights when students first began to move to the area, is bounded by Stewart Street to the south, Brown Street to the west, Woodland Cemetery to the east and Wyoming Street to the north. Traditionally, the Darkside has served as housing for juniors. Now with the introduction of AVIATE and points accumulated towards housing (More commonly referred to as PATH credits), Juniors and Seniors are more evenly distributed between the two. Both Juniors and Seniors are even in the assignments process and groups with more PATH credits chose their location first, regardless of seniority. The third and smallest neighborhood, Holy Angels, derives its name from the Holy Angels Church and School that occupies the center of the area. Holy Angels is often alternatively referred to as College Park. It lies between the Darkside and the Ghetto, but is physically separated from them by Stewart Street and the Frericks Center parking lot. Features 306, 308 and 310 Kiefaber Street, three of the units in the ArtStreet complex Not all of the houses in the student neighborhoods are occupied by students. Four houses in both the Ghetto and the Darkside ‚Äî on Trinity Avenue, Kiefaber Street, Stonemill Road and Chambers Street ‚Äî are home to groups of Marianists, the Catholic religious institute behind UD. Between six and 10 Marianists live in each house. They serve the university as ministers, groundskeepers, administrators and professors, among other professions.Ross, Hilary. \\"Marianists talk about life in the Ghetto.\\" Flyer News. Volume 53, Issue 8. September 30, 2005. The Ghetto also contains several high-density living areas, including the Garden Apartments, the Lawnview Apartments and the Campus South, a high-rise living complex for sophomores. In 2004, the ArtStreet complex opened, intended as a combined living-learning space. It includes housing for 56 students, as well as a cafe, an amphitheater, rehearsal rooms, several activity rooms and gallery spaces, and a new studio for the campus radio station, WUDR.Martin, Jerry. \\"New facilities welcome UD students.\\" Flyer News. Volume 52, Issue 1. August 31, 2004. The Ghetto was also home to the McGinnis school house, which was acquired in 1982 and renamed the McGinnis Center; it is used as a central point of contact for residents. In 2017 McGinnis Center was demolished to make room for the addition of an $11 million apartment style building. The building is set to open for the 2018 Fall semester. Some houses in the neighborhood have been given informal nicknames by which they are commonly known, such as \\"The Deli House\\" at 237 Lowes St., \\"The F Shaq\\" at 418 Lowes St. and \\"The Crack House\\" at 1439 Frericks Way. For the majority of houses, nicknames are arbitrary and vary year to year. In addition, many houses in the Ghetto are those occupied by various fraternities, sororities and other special interest groups. Future 1519 Frericks Way, \\"The Castle,\\" a recently renovated house In 2002, the University of Dayton released a Master Plan which called for the renovation and construction of several houses, an extension to Stonemill Road to connect directly to Evanston Avenue, and the enlargement and clean-up of the parking areas in the alleys behind the houses. Despite ongoing rumors, there were no plans to replace the neighborhood with more high-density housing and other university buildings, despite the landlocked nature of the campus.Griesenbrock, Tyler. \\"More neighborhood changes planned\\" Flyer News. Volume 52, Issue 35. March 15, 2005. In June 2005, before the plan could be realized, the university made a $25 million purchase of an additional ‚Äîmuch of the land which was once home to the NCR Corporation‚Äîas well as a new building on Brown Street.Pham, HaQuyen. \\"UD buys NCR property for $25M\\" Flyer News. Volume 53, Issue 1. August 30, 2005. The area, renamed Mid Campus, prompted the development of a new Campus Master Plan. While several new buildings have been planned, many of the changes that had been proposed to the Ghetto in the previous master plan are no longer included in the new plan. The largest feature affecting the student neighborhoods is a new building to the east of Alberta Street, between Chambers Street and Obell Court, on the Darkside. According to the draft of the master plan, the building is intended to be a sustainable residence hall, a 75- to 90-bed facility that would also include an educational wing. The proposed building would use technologies such as solar energy, geothermal heating and cooling, compost piles and low-flow showers. The plan also calls for a walk/bike greenway to link the neighborhood to the core of campus and the athletic complex.

Actor modeling is most prominently used for the early modeling of requirements; through this it becomes possible to understand who the users and stakeholders of a system are and what their interests and needs are regarding that system. The increasing complexity of today‚Äôs systems makes it more appropriate to take this approach, instead of a traditional, more mechanically focused approach. When thinking along the dimensions of users and their needs, it is easier to comprehend what the system is designed to accomplish. This approach furthermore helps the users to define the requirements for the system. The approach of actor modeling is normally combined with the modeling of goals and tasks to give a better understanding of the situation the user is in. There are different modeling languages that support actor modeling; examples include i* and EEML. The Actor The central entity of the Actor modeling ‚Äì the actor itself ‚Äì can be any kind of entity that is performing action(s). It may for example be a person, a department, or an organization. The goal of actor modeling is to understand the actor better. To do so, it is important to understand the actor, who he is and why he does what he does. The actor has attributes that define it: * The actor has goals, skills and responsibilities. * The actor performs tasks with a certain purpose in mind. * The actor depends on other actors, resources or tasks. The Actor concept was initially developed on a platform of multiple independent processors in a network. Implementation on a multiprocessor machine provides several basic concurrency features including encapsulation of parallel synchronization and serialized message processing, which allow higher level concurrent features such as fork/join, async/await, pipeline processing and others. The actor code encapsulates the threading and synchronization management so that a class derived from it can use threading techniques without having to implement the low level plumbing details. Relations The different actors in the model are in general not interdependent. It is therefore necessary to be able to put the actors in context. This can be done through different kinds of relations: * Connections between actors (what is the relation between the actors) * Relations to tasks (what does the user do) * Relations to goals (what is the goal of the user) * Dependencies (the user is dependent on other entities: users, tasks, goals) Roles Roles allow an impersonalized representation of an actor. It is possible to model a role and connect that role to the actor that is filling that role. If the actor that fills the role stops to do so for whatever reason, it can be easily replaced by another actor that from that point on fills the role; this can be as a temporary replacement or as a long term arrangement. It is furthermore possible to assign new and/or different roles to an already existing actor. The advantage of this is that the model itself doesn‚Äôt need to be changed; only the connections between the actors and the roles need to be redone. Limitations of the Actor Model Use of actors reduces mechanisms for race conditions but does not eliminate them. Data race conditions are possible if the messages or underlying logic touched by the actor objects includes mutable shared objects. Implementation of truly concurrent data structures is non- trivial. The actor model improves on some of these issues, but does not solve all of the problems. Deadlocks are possible under a number of situations. The Actor model implements message passing in the direction of the actor, but does not facilitate sending a request and receiving a specific status or a reply to a request. Synchronous replies require some sort of blocking logic. For information on objects which can provide this behavior, look at \\"futures\\".

The analysis begins with softgoals that represent NFR which stakeholders agree upon. Softgoals are goals that are hard to express, but tend to be global qualities of a software system. These could be usability, performance, security and flexibility in a given system. If the team starts collecting them it often finds a great many of them. In order to reduce the number to a manageable quantity, structuring is a valuable approach. There are several frameworks available that are useful as structure.  Structuring Non- functional requirements  The following frameworks are useful to serve as structure for NFRs: 1\\\\. Goal Modelling The finalised softgoals are then usually decomposed and refined to uncover a tree structure of goals and subgoals for e.g. the flexibility softgoal. Once uncovering tree structures, one is bound to find interfering softgoals in different trees, e.g. security goals generally interferes with usability. These softgoal trees now form a softgoal graph structure. The final step in this analysis is to pick some particular leaf softgoals, so that all the root softgoals are satisfied.[1] 2\\\\. IVENASOPHISTEN \\\\- Integrated Approach to Acquisition of NFR The method has integrated a requirement tree. [2] 3\\\\. Context of an Organization There are several models to describe the context of an organization such as Business Model Canvas, OrgManle [3], or others [4]. Those models are also a good framework to assign NFRs.  Measuring the Non-functional requirements  SNAP is the Software Non-functional Assessment Process. While Function Points measure the functional requirements by sizing the data flow through a software application, IFPUG's SNAP measures the non-functional requirements. The SNAP model consists of four categories and fourteen sub-categories to measure the non-functional requirements. Non-functional requirement are mapped to the relevant sub-categories. Each sub-category is sized, and the size of a requirement is the sum of the sizes of its sub-categories. The SNAP sizing process is very similar to the Function Point sizing process. Within the application boundary, non-functional requirements are associated with relevant categories and their sub-categories. Using a standardized set of basic criteria, each of the sub-categories is then sized according to its type and complexity; the size of such a requirement is the sum of the sizes of its sub- categories. These sizes are then totaled to give the measure of non-functional size of the software application. Beta testing of the model shows that SNAP size has a strong correlation with the work effort required to develop the non-functional portion of the software application.

History First recorded sighting by Europeans was by the Spanish expedition of Pedro Fern√°ndez de Quir√≥s in the spring of 1606.Brand, Donald D. The Pacific Basin: A History of its Geographical Explorations New York: The American Geographical Society (New York, 1967) p.137. The misty sight of Ambae from neighbouring Espiritu Santo, which served as a major World War II airbase, inspired the mythical Bali Ha'i in James Michener's Tales of the South Pacific. Geography Rough, black basalt stones compose its shoreline and surface in many places, though the soils (where present) are rich. The island appears to be covered in nearly unbroken vegetation; inhabited areas feature large gardens and managed forests above, with coconut and cacao plantations usually closer to shore. There are no reliable sources of surface water (rivers, streams, or lakes), save the crater lakes which are inaccessible. Water for all human uses comes from cement-lined wells or water tanks filled with rainwater. There are no permanent rivers on the island, but the population rarely suffers from water shortages. The climate is both humid tropical with slight seasonal variations. The average annual temperature on the coast is 30 ¬∞C, on the caldera - 23 ¬∞C. The average annual rainfall varies from 2500 to 3500 mm of rain. The rainy season lasts from November to April. =Volcano= Ambae is the emergent portion of Vanuatu's largest (most voluminous) volcano, Manaro Voui, which rises 1,496 meters above sea level, or about 3,900 meters above the sea floor. A steam and ash eruption began on November 27, 2005, leading to a Level 2 volcano alert and preparations for evacuations. On December 8, the eruption became stronger, displacing more than 3,000 of Ambae Island's inhabitants to elsewhere on the island and requiring the evacuation of two hospitals. On September 28, 2017, after a week of increasing volcanic activity to Level 4 (Level 5 being a major eruption), the government of Vanuatu ordered a complete evacuation of the island, home to about 11,000 residents. Ash from the eruption has covered the island, killing crops and polluting the air and water. In April 2018 the remaining approximately 10,000 residents were ordered to evacuate permanently. Demographics The population is Melanesian, though (anecdotally) ancient Polynesian admixtures have given Man-Ambae lighter complexions and Polynesian languages. Religiously Ambae is exclusively Christian, split into many denominations. These can be characterized in three stages: the original colonial-missionary churches (Anglican, Catholic), the second-stage, often American-origin evangelical denominations (Apostolic, Church of Christ, Assemblies of God), and the newer, less orthodox, fusion/'unity' sects. This last category includes many grass- roots groups originating within Vanuatu. Missionary activity from outside (as in all Vanuatu) continues, especially from Mormons, who have a growing following on West & North Ambae. Population Ambae has a population of less than 11,000,2009 Census Summary release final - Government of Vanuatu divided into 3‚Äì4 discernible language groups (North/East Ambae language centered on the Lombaha area, West Ambae language centered on Nduindui, and South Ambae language centered on Redcliffe). The island has no considerable towns, though the Penama provincial center is located at Saratamata on East Ambae. Economy and agriculture Ambae children with pet Lorikeet The local economy is largely non-monetary, with cash crop income (from copra, cacao, and dried kava) being used primarily for school fees and sundry items like soap, salt, kerosene, etc. Most regular employment is in the public sector, as teachers. Remittances from employed relatives in the towns of Santo or Vila also contribute cash to the local economy. Ambae is serviced by fewer than 100 telephone lines, mostly on the east side. It has two post offices and National Bank of Vanuatu branches, at Saratamata and Nduindui, regular interisland ship traffic, and several Vanair flights a week. Of the small-to-medium outer islands of Vanuatu (i.e., not Efate, Santo, Tanna or Malekula), Ambae must be considered one of the more \\"developed.\\" Traditional subsistence agriculture satisfies food needs, while most villagers engage in small-scale cash crop production as well. Often grown in large upland gardens (with good rainfall and safe from roving pigs), the primary crops are taro, banana, yam, and manioc. Kumala (sweet potatoes ‚Äì a good tuber thereof is called iggeremanggeggeuniCodrington, Robert N. (Oxford, 1891). The Melanesians; Their Anthropology and Folklore), vegetables, fruits and nuts help to provide an excellent diet, though protein is occasionally lacking. Without substantial reefs, seafood is less significant a protein source compared with other islands of Vanuatu and in any case is inaccessible to the large populations living at high inland elevations. Transportation The island is served by three airstrips with services by Air Vanuatu: Walaha Airport in the southwest, Redcliffe Airport in the south and Longana Airport in the northeast.

James was born in Carlisle, England; his father was a noted cornet player and his mother a famous soprano, Ena Mitchell. He began playing cornet in a brass band at age four and by seven he was playing paying gigs as a trumpeter. He also played the organ and was assistant organist in Carlisle Cathedral. Taking up the horn in 1951, he studied first privately and then under Aubrey Brain at the Royal Academy of Music. His professional horn playing career began with the Halle Orchestra then the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, and was much in demand for chamber recitals and solo work. Moving to London, he played as principal horn with many orchestras and chamber groups. He was appointed professor of horn at the Royal Academy of Music, principal horn of the English Chamber Orchestra, and horn player in the Philip Jones Brass Ensemble, with whom he toured the world and made over 30 recordings. He was also appointed professor for horn at the Royal Northern College of Music (Manchester). His final teaching appointment was as professor for horn at the Staatliche Hochschule f√ºr Musik, Freiburg, Germany. His musical taste was eclectic and he was for some time the principal conductor of the famous Besses o‚Äô th' Barn Brass Band, winning the 1978 BBC Brass Band of the Year Competition with them. He was known among his students for sending them on curious errands such as paying hotel bills. He also had a puckish sense of humour. One former student recalls an incident where the two of them were at traffic lights in James' open-topped Morris Minor when a pretty girl walked alongside. James encouraged the younger man to \\"pinch her bottom as the lights go green, and I'll drive off\\". Needless to say when the young man did as bidden, James stayed put and turned to grin at the girl. Welsh to the core, he famously averred that he only played the horn because he could not sing. His former students include over 100 professional musicians, over 30 of them currently principal horn players with orchestras in numerous countries. Nine are professors at music colleges, two are the principals of German music colleges and a further six are noted soloists. At the 2005 British Horn Festival tributes to James were read out by Barry Tuckwell, Michael Thompson and others, and a commissioned Portrait by former student Tony Randall was premiered by an octet of former students including Simon de Souza (professor of horn at Birmingham Conservatoire), Jeffrey Bryant (professor of horn at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama), Michael Thompson, (Aubrey Brain Professor of Horn, Royal Academy of Music) and Frank Lloyd (professor of horn at the Folkwang Hochschule and president of the International Horn Society).

Paul Lindau (3 June 1839 - 31 January 1919) was a German dramatist and novelist. Life and Works Lindau was born in Magdeburg as the son of Carl Lindau, a lawyer (Justizkommissar) whose parents Hertz Levin (a physician) and Henriette Cohen had converted from Judaism to Protestantism. Hertz Levin changed his name to Hermann Lindau after conversion.Wilhelm, Gertraude, \\"Lindau, Paul\\" in: Neue Deutsche Biographie 14 (1985), p. 573-575. Online version. Paul was educated at Halle, Leipzig, and Berlin. He spent five years in Paris to further his studies, acting meanwhile as foreign correspondent to German papers. After his return to Germany in 1863 he was engaged in journalism in D√ºsseldorf and Elberfeld. In 1870 he founded Das neue Blatt at Leipzig; from 1872 to 1881 he edited the Berlin weekly Die Gegenwart; and in 1878 he founded the well-known monthly Nord und S√ºd, which he continued to edit until 1904. Two books of travel, Aus Venetien (D√ºsseldorf, 1864) and Aus Paris (Stuttgart, 1865), were followed by some volumes of critical studies, written in a light, satirical vein, which at once made him famous. These were Harmlose Briefe eines deutschen Kleinst√§dters (Leipzig, 2 vols., 1870), Moderne M√§rchen fur grosse Kinder (Leipzig, 1870) and Literarische R√ºcksichtslosigkeiten (Leipzig, 1871). He was appointed intendant of the court theatre at Meiningen in 1895, but removed to Berlin in 1899, where he became manager of the Berliner Theater, and subsequently, until 1905, the Deutsches Theater. He began his dramatic career in 1868 with Marion, the first of a long series of plays in which he displayed a remarkable talent for stage effect and a command of witty and lively dialogue. Among the more famous were Maria und Magdalena (1872), Tante Therese (1876), Gr√§fin Lea (1879), Die Erste (1895), Der Abend (1896), Der Herr im Hause (1899), and So ich dir (1903). He also adapted many plays by Dumas, Augier and Sardou for the German stage. Five volumes of his plays were published (Berlin, 1873‚Äì1888). Some of his volumes of short stories acquired great popularity, notably Herr und Frau Bewer (Breslau, 1882) and Toggenburg und andere Geschichten (Breslau, 1883).

Polyeucte martyr is a drama in five acts by French writer Pierre Corneille. It was finished in December 1642 and debuted in October 1643. It is based on the life of the martyr Saint Polyeuctus (Polyeucte).Project Gutenberg etext of Polyeucte In 1878 it was adapted into an opera by Charles Gounod, with the assistance of the librettist Jules Barbier. The opera was not a success and is rarely performed except for a number of arias including \\"Source d√©licieuse\\" and the barcarolle \\"Nymphes attentives\\". Other works based on the play include a ballet by Marc-Antoine Charpentier (1679), the opera Poliuto (1838) by Donizetti (adapted into French by Scribe as Les martyrs), an overture by Paul Dukas (1891) and a composition by Edgar Tinel. The drama is set in ancient Armenia (in a city, Melitene, which is in present-day Turkey) during a time when Christians were persecuted there under the Roman Empire. Polyeucte, an Armenian nobleman, converts to Christianity to the great despair of his wife, Pauline, and of his father-in-law, Felix. Despite them, Polyeucte becomes a martyr, causing Pauline and Felix to finally convert as well. There is also a romantic subplot: the Roman Severus is in love with Pauline and hopes she will be his after the conversion of Polyeucte. However, she chooses to stay at the side of her husband. Before dying, Polyeucte entrusts Severus with Pauline. Polyeucte is one of the last 17th-century French dramas with a religious subject--Corneille did also write Th√©odore in 1645 and Racine wrote Esther (1689) and Athalie (1691), but these were not meant for public performance. Later playwrights were not as willing to mix religious and worldly themes. One act of the opera was performed under the auspices of the Carthage Institute in the ancient Roman theatre at Carthage, Tunisia in 1906, making it the first modern performance to have taken place in that historic space (which had functioned as an active theatre from ca. AD 150 to AD 439 and was only unearthed in 1904).Revue Tunisienne 14 (1907): 74‚Äì75 Musical settings Marc-Antoine Charpentier, Ouverture and ballet music, for strings and bc (plus trumpets and drums in one number) H 498 (1679) References French plays 1643 plays Plays by Pierre Corneille Plays set in Armenia Plays set in ancient Rome Christian plays Plays adapted into operas ","title":"Polyeucte"},{"id":"2986705","text":"The parliament of Poland is the bicameral legislature of Poland. It is composed of an upper house (the Senate) and a lower house (the Sejm). Both houses are accommodated in the Sejm complex in Warsaw. The Constitution of Poland does not refer to the Parliament as a body, but only to the Sejm and Senate. Members of both houses are elected by direct election, usually every four years. The Sejm has 460 members, while the Senate has 100 senators. To become law, a bill must first be approved by both houses, but the Sejm can override a Senate refusal to pass a bill. On certain occasions, the Marshal of the Sejm summons the National Assembly, a joint session of the members of both houses. Its function is mostly ceremonial in nature, and it only convenes occasionally, such as to witness the inauguration of the President. Under exceptional circumstances, the constitution endows the National Assembly with significant responsibilities, such as the power to bring the President before the State Tribunal (impeachment).The current leading party in the Sejm is the Law and Justice (PiS) party with 235 out of 460 seats in Sejm and 48 out of 100 seats in Senate. Currently Sejm is controlled by the ruling Law and Justice party, but Senate is controlled by opposition parties (Civil Coalition, The Left and Polish People's Party). The two debating halls have designated seats for the deputies, senators and the Marshals, equipped with voting devices, used by the deputies and senators to vote.  Parliamentary groups and affiliations  Deputies and Senators are often grouped into different deputy, senatorial or parliamentary groupings, or have no affiliations and sit as \\"independents\\". In both chambers, there are two types of groups: Clubs (, ()) and circles (, ()). The primary difference between the two types of groups is the right to join the Seniors' Covenant (), an internal committee in each house of Parliament that determines the drafting of agendas and workings of their respective chamber. In the Sejm, *Clubs consists of at least 15 deputies; *Circles consists of at least 3 deputies. In the Senate, *Clubs consists of at least 7 senators; *Circles consists of at least 3 senators. National Assembly The National Assembly () is the name of a joint sitting of the Sejm and the Senate. It is headed by the Marshal of the Sejm (or by the Marshal of the Senate when the former is absent). Under the 1997 Constitution of Poland the National Assembly has the authority to *declare the President's permanent incapacity to exercise his duties due to the state of his health (by a majority vote of at least two-thirds of the statutory number of members), *bring an indictment against the President to the State Tribunal (by a majority of at least two-thirds of the statutory number of members, on the motion of at least 140 members), *adopt its own rules of procedure. The National Assembly is also called in order to *receive the President's oath of office, *hear a presidential address (however, the President may choose to deliver his address to either the Sejm or the Senate). Sejm and Senate Complex of Poland In the years 1922-1935 and 1989-1990, it was the National Assembly who elected the President of the Republic of Poland by an absolute majority of votes. In 1935, it was replaced by an Assembly of Electors, which consisted of the Marshal of the Senate (as president of Assembly of Electors), the Marshal of the Sejm, the Prime Minister, the Chief Justice, the General Armed Forces Inspector, 50 electors elected by the Sejm, and 25 electors elected by the Senate. The Senate was abolished in 1946 so in 1947 Boles≈Çaw Bierut was elected President only by the Sejm. There were no presidents from 1952 until 1989 when the Senate was restored and the National Assembly elected Wojciech Jaruzelski as President. Since 1990, the President has been elected by the people. However, the President is still sworn in before the National Assembly, which is also the only organ which can declare the President's permanent incapacity to perform his duties, or bring an indictment against him before State Tribunal. From 1992 to 1997, the National Assembly drafted and passed a new Constitution, which was approved by a national referendum on 25 May 1997.

It was the climactic battle of Steele's Camden Expedition, a part of the Red River Campaign. As a result of the battle, Federal forces were able to complete a retreat from a precarious position at Camden to their defenses at Little Rock.  Background  In March 1864, the United States Army in Louisiana under the command of Major-General Nathaniel Banks and the United States Navy operating on the Mississippi River under the command of Admiral David Porter launched the Red River Campaign. The campaign's immediate objective was the capture of Shreveport, Louisiana, which was the headquarters of General E. Kirby Smith, commander of the Confederate Trans-Mississippi Department. Shreveport also was the temporary capital of Louisiana, a major supply depot and a gateway to Texas. An incidental objective of the campaign was to purchase cotton, which was in short supply in the northern States and thereby possibly to win the loyalty of planters along the river for the United States. It was thought this action might expand Reconstruction in Louisiana.McPherson, James, M., ed., The Atlas of the Civil War, p. 148. Philadelphia, PA: Running Press Book Publishers, 2005. . In the event, the naval force and accompanying soldiers in particular alienated the local population by simply confiscating or destroying cotton. Henry Halleck, Major-General and General-in-Chief of the Armies of the United States, who devised the plan, also wanted to open the road to the occupation of Texas by U.S. forces and to discourage French incursions from Mexico.Heidler, David S. and Heidler, Jeanne T., eds., Encyclopedia of the American Civil War: A Political, Social and Military History, p. 1616.

Since President Lincoln had approved the Red River Campaign plan before promoting Ulysses Grant to Lieutenant-General and appointing him General-in- Chief, Grant felt he could not stop the campaign. Grant did try to hurry its execution because he would have preferred to use a 10,000-man force which was diverted to the campaign to reinforce Major-General William Sherman in Sherman's drive from north Georgia to Atlanta. Grant also would have liked to have pinned down more Confederate troops in Alabama with an attack on the Confederate stronghold at Mobile.Foote, vol. 3, 1974, p. 25 General Banks had a force of at least 20,000 men available near New Orleans for the campaign.Foote, vol. 3, 1974, p. 28 He was to be joined by 10,000 men of Sherman's army from Vicksburg, Mississippi under the command of Brigadier- General Andrew Smith. Smith's force accompanied Porter's flotilla up the Red River. Initially they were successful in capturing Fort DeRussy to open passage up the Red River.Heidler ed., Dunavent, 2000, p. 1616 Major-General Frederick Steele commanding approximately 14,000 men also was supposed to move his forces in support of Banks against Shreveport from their bases to the north at Little Rock, Fort Smith, and Pine Bluff, Arkansas.  Prelude  Union strategy in the West and Trans-Mississippi. = To Camden = Steele's part in the campaign became known as the Camden Expedition. Steele later said its objective was to reach and occupy Camden, Arkansas, and to draw Confederate cavalry away from Shreveport in support of Banks's effort to take that city. Nonetheless, Banks obviously planned for Steele to join him in the attempt to take Shreveport, not just to occupy Camden temporarily. Even Grant sent a telegram to Steele which told Steele that a demonstration alone was insufficient support of Banks.Foote, 1974, p. 64 After Banks's forces were repulsed in their march toward Shreveport at the Battle of Mansfield, Louisiana by outnumbered forces led by Confederate Lieutenant-General Richard Taylor, Banks paused his retreat at Alexandria, Louisiana. Banks still thought he could renew the campaign and communicated to Steele his desire for Steele's reinforcements to join his forces in another attempt to take Shreveport.Foote, vol. 3, 1974, pp. 61-62 Steele, with 8,000 men, first marched southwest from Little Rock to Arkadelphia, Arkansas. Steele planned to meet a federal column of 4,000 men from Fort Smith, led by Brigadier-General John Thayer, at Arkadelphia.Foote, vol. 3, 1974, p. 65 A Federal cavalry force of about 2,000 men from Pine Bluff, Arkansas was supposed to keep watch on the Confederate garrison at Camden, divert attention from Steele's movement and eventually to join up with Steele. Even though Steele was three weeks behind schedule, he did not find Thayer at Arkadelphia when his forces arrived there on March 29, 1864.Josephy, Alvin M. Jr., The Civil War in the American West, p. 211. New York, NY: Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 1991. Steele's men had marched for the last three days in the rain on already reduced rations.Josephy, 1991, p. 211 The people of the poor country along the route of the march were destitute and there was little food or forage to be had. After waiting until April 1, 1864, with his supplies being further depleted and no word from Thayer, Steele moved southwest toward Washington, Arkansas, the temporary capital of Confederate Arkansas. He eventually united with Thayer near Elkins' Ferry on the Little Missouri River on April 9, 1864. Thayer brought few supplies, however, and the combined force then became short of supplies.Foote, vol. 3, 1974, p. 67 Steele succeeded in aiding Banks only to the extent of keeping the five Confederate cavalry brigades in the region from joining the forces opposing Banks. Two Confederate infantry divisions from Arkansas and Missouri under the overall command of Major-General Sterling Price, the commander of Confederate forces in Arkansas, were sent from the Camden area to support the forces opposing Banks. Under the command of Brigadier-General John Marmaduke and the overall command of Price, who stayed in Arkansas, three of the five Confederate cavalry brigades left in Arkansas harassed Steele's force as it moved from Arkadelphia. They could not stop its slow progress. The opposing forces fought a small battle at Elkins' Ferry on the Little Missouri River on April 3, 1864, where Steele's forces stymied Marmaduke's attempt to prevent them from crossing the Little Missouri River.McPherson, 2005, pp. 150-151 They fought another small battle at Prairie D'Ane, Arkansas, on April 10, 1864. On April 12, Steele feinted toward Washington, where Price had moved to resist Steele's presumed objective to take the town. Steele then sidestepped the Confederates with a move to Camden, which was out of the way for a march to Shreveport. After brushing aside Marmaduke's cavalry from Camden, Steele's force occupied Camden on April 15, 1864.Foote, 1974, p. 69. Price had earlier evacuated that fortified town in order to defend the temporary Confederate state capital at Washington, Arkansas. = Camden, Poison Spring, and Marks' Mill = Maj. Gen. Frederick Steele, commander of the Department of Arkansas Gen. E. Kirby Smith's strategy was to isolate Banks' and Steele's armies and annihilate each one separately. Led by Maj. Gen. Sterling Price, the Confederates fought a strong defensive campaign and stopped the Union advance at Camden. Price, who had been joined by two Texas cavalry brigades under Brigadier-General Samuel Maxey, appeared at Camden with his cavalry soon after Steele's occupation of the town. With the seven cavalry brigades, Price besieged the entrenched Steele, even though Steele's federal force still outnumbered Price's Confederate force.Foote, vol. 3, 1974, p. 67-69 Steele had hoped to be resupplied from depots at Little Rock and Pine Bluff and to collect provisions from the countryside. He was denied significant resupply when Confederate cavalry forces of 1,700 troopers under Brigadier-General Marmaduke and 1,600 additional troopers under Brigadier-General Maxey overwhelmed a federal foraging expedition under the command of Colonel James M. Williams which would have been successful had it been able to return to Camden.Eicher, David J., The Longest Night: A Military History of the Civil War, p. 653. New York, NY: Simon and Schuster Paperbacks, Inc., 2001, first paperback edition 2006. The Confederates captured 170 wagons and teams from a 198-wagon supply train and destroyed the other wagons at the battle of Poison Spring, Arkansas. One source stated that the Confederates killed or captured \\"most\\" of the United States Army escort of 1,170 infantry and cavalry and four artillery pieces during the battle on April 18, 1864.Josephy, 1991, p. 212 Another source states that the U.S. forces lost 301 men, mostly killed or missing.Foote, vol. 3, 1974, p. 70Eicher, 2001, p. 653 says U.S. casualties at Poison Spring were 204 killed and missing and 97 wounded, with 117 of the dead being African- Americans. He does not give a separate number of captured U.S. soldiers. He states that Confederate losses totaled 114. The Confederates killed some African-American soldiers from the escort in this battle as they tried to surrender, according to reports from the field.Eicher, 2001, p. 653 bases this statement in part on Colonel Williams's report from eyewitnesses. About the time the remnants of the federal force who were not killed or captured at Poison Spring stumbled back into Camden, Steele learned that General Banks had turned back in his drive toward Shreveport after being defeated at the Battle of Mansfield, Louisiana (also known as Pleasant Grove or Sabine Cross Roads), about from Shreveport, on April 8, 1864.Foote, vol. 3, 1974, p. 70; Faust, Patricia L., ed., Historical Times Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Civil War p. 305. New York, NY: Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc., 1986. Banks had won a tactical victory and inflicted more casualties (1,626) than his forces sustained (1,369) at the Battle of Pleasant Hill the day after the battle of Mansfield. His force also outnumbered the Confederate force, but Banks thought otherwise so he continued his retreat toward Alexandria.McPherson, 2005, p. 148 Meanwhile, Admiral Porter had to retreat down the Red River and back toward the Mississippi River while under near constant Confederate fire from the river banks. Porter had to return not only because of Banks's retreat, but because his flotilla was in danger of being stranded by uncommonly low water levels in the Red River. Although the boats were freed from the Red River by May 13 through skillful engineering and damming of the river, Banks had to wait at Alexandria during the time Porter's boats were bottled up in order to protect the fleet from Confederate attack from the shore. Only after the boats were safely down the river could Banks move in any direction.Faust, 1986, p. 620; Foote, vol. 3, 1974, p. 61 On April 23, 1864, when Steele received the dispatch from Banks asking that he join Banks so they could move again on Shreveport, Steele responded that he was in no position to join Banks. He also noted that he now faced not only Confederate cavalry but Price's returned infantry and additional infantry under Kirby Smith who had joined Price with some of the infantry which had been with Taylor at the battle of Pleasant Hill. Brigadier-General Thomas Churchill‚Äôs Arkansas division and Brigadier- General Mosby Parsons's Missouri division had returned to Price's command. They were followed by Major-General John Walker‚Äôs larger Texas division with Kirby Smith. Kirby Smith had decided that Steele was a bigger threat, and a bigger prize, than Banks when Banks continued to retreat after the battle of Pleasant Hill on April 9, 1864. Kirby Smith thought he could destroy Steele's force and perhaps still turn back and trap Banks later.McPherson, 2005, p. 148; Foote, vol. 3, 1974, pp. 53-54 Taylor vehemently disagreed with this decision and wanted to attack Banks immediately. Nonetheless, Taylor could not convince Kirby Smith to change his plan. As Banks appeared to be waiting for the naval force at Alexandria, Louisiana, Kirby Smith became even more certain that his decision was correct and he had time to execute it.Foote, vol. 3, 1974, pp. 54-55 On April 25, 1864, in an action called the Battle of Marks' Mill, two Confederate cavalry brigades under the overall command of Brigadier- General James Fagan, operating under Price, captured a federal wagon train of between 211 and 240 wagons and 1,300 men of the escort which Steele had sent to seek supplies from the federal depot at Pine Bluff. Only about 150 of the 1,400 to 1,700Foote, vol. 3, 1974, p. 72; Faust, 1986, p. 395; Josephy, 1991, p. 213; and Eicher, 2001, p. 654 all give brief accounts of this action. They differ somewhat on the number of Federal soldiers engaged. Most of them give the 240-wagon number. U.S. soldiers escaped after a five-hour fight.Josephy, 1991, p. 212. Eicher, 2001, p. 654 states that numerous prisoners were captured but also says U.S. losses were 100 killed, 250 wounded, 100 captured. Confederate losses were 41 killed, 108 wounded, 144 missing. Fagan had about 300 casualties in the engagement. Reports showed his men killed wounded African-American soldiers at the end of the battle. The Confederates in turn would pay for this at the battle of Jenkins' Ferry.McPherson, 2005, p. 150 = Retreat from Camden = Steele was now desperately short of supplies, outnumbered and in danger of being surrounded at Camden. After his senior officers agreed with him that he had no other reasonable choice, Steele ordered a night withdrawal toward Little Rock on April 26 and the early morning of April 27, 1864. The Confederates did not detect Steele's movement until later in the day. Steele's forces used a pontoon bridge which they had carried on the campaign to cross the Ouachita River. Steele thus gained a head start on the Confederates who pursued the federal force as soon as they realized that Steele had withdrawn from Camden. First, the Confederates had to get across the swollen, and bridgeless, Ouachita River on the morning of April 28 by constructing a raft bridge.Heidler ed., Urwin, 2000, p. 1068, Article on \\"Battle of Jenkins Ferry\\" by Gregory J. W. Urwin. This delay allowed Steele to get a further head start, although rain soon slowed him down. The Confederates struggled through the rain, as well, but they did not have as many wagons or as much equipment to slow down their pursuit.Foote, vol. 3, 1974, p. 75. Meanwhile, on April 28, Price sent Samuel Maxey's division of two cavalry brigades back to Oklahoma and Texas to attend to reported threats to that territory by another federal force.Josephy, 1991, p. 213 Brigadier-General Fagan, who had commanded the victorious Confederate forces at Marks Mill, took off on independent operations but did not fulfill his orders which permitted this movement along with some stated objectives. He failed in his first objective to destroy the Federal supply depot at Pine Bluff, probably because he could not cross the swollen Saline River, a tributary of the Ouachita River. Fagan also failed to occupy a position across Steele's supply and communication lines between Camden and Little Rock, as Price had ordered. Fagan probably was looking for food and forage for his own force. Fagan was not in immediate communication with Price and not in a position to know about Steele's recent movements out of Camden, but Price realized on April 29 that Fagan was not blocking the federal retreat. Fagan and his 3,000 troopers would arrive at Jenkins' Ferry on April 30, 1864, which was too late to take part in the battle.Foote, vol. 3, 1974, p. 76 General Steele moved due north out of Camden by way of Princeton, Arkansas. His force was harassed by Confederate cavalry as General Marmaduke's men caught up to the federal column on their approach to the Saline River. When Steele's forces reached Jenkins' Ferry on the swollen river, they had to stop to construct their pontoon bridge to get across. The remaining 10,000 Confederates under Kirby Smith and Price then caught up to Steele, who also had about 10,000 men remaining from his original forces. The Confederates brought on a battle by attacking the federal rear guard in the early morning of April 30, 1864.Foote, vol. 3, 1974, p. 74 Steele's cavalry had been able to cross the Saline River overnight on April 29. Now Steele had to fight off Kirby Smith's army before his infantry forces could finish their efforts to get their wagons, artillery and remaining troops over their pontoon bridge river crossing.Foote, vol. 3, 1974, pp. 73-74  Battle  A view of the battlefield from the ferry crossing site. General Steele's Federal forces reached Jenkins' Ferry, Arkansas on the Saline River at 2:00 p.m. on April 29, 1864, in their retreat from Camden, Arkansas to their base at Little Rock, Arkansas. They found that the river was swollen by heavy rain. The rain continued in torrents on April 29 and the riverbank and approaches became a quagmire of mud and standing water.Josephy, 1991, p. 214 The tired and famished Federal troops could not construct their pontoon bridge and get their wagons and artillery out of the mud and over the river during the night, although the Federal cavalry did get across. Since the Federal commanders realized that Kirby Smith's Confederate forces were rushing to catch up to them, a United States Army rear guard built breastworks and took a formidable defensive position to oppose the Confederates when they arrived in force on the morning of April 30. With Steele continuing to supervise the river crossing, Brigadier-General Friedrich Salomon should have commanded the rear guard action against the pursuing Confederates but he left the task to Brigadier-General Samuel Rice and 4,000 Federal infantrymen.Heidler ed., Urwin, 2000, p. 1069. Before dawn on April 30, 1864, Marmaduke's Confederate cavalry troopers arrived near Jenkins' Ferry, dismounted and skirmished with Steele's rear guard infantry force about from the Saline River crossing.Faust, 1986, p. 395 Rice had placed the Federal forces behind breastworks, abatis and rifle pits. Rice's lines were protected by Cox Creek, sometimes shown as Toxie Creek on the right. While some accounts have stated that the Federal position was bordered by an impassable cane swamp on one side and thick, rain-drenched timber on the other, other sources state that the left flank was vulnerable and only after failed Confederate efforts to turn his left flank did Rice extended the left end of his line until it rested on a steep wooded slope. The difficult approach to the Federal position was only about four hundred yards wide and would allow at most only 4,000 Confederate infantry to attack at one time.Foote, vol. 3, 1974, p. 75; Heidler, ed., Urwin, 2000, p. 1069. In the event, the Confederates attacked in an even more piecemeal manner. Price first committed the infantry under Brigadier-General Thomas Churchill and then the infantry under Brigadier-General Mosby Parsons to the battle as soon as they arrived on the field. In turn, they each made little headway because they had no cover for an attack and the approach to the Federal position was ankle to knee deep in mud and pools of water. These Confederate divisions were sent into the attack piecemeal, brigade by brigade, not in a more concentrated effort.Josephy, 1991, p. 214; Heidler, ed., Urwin, 2000, p. 1069 Gunpowder smoke added to a blanket of fog soon after the battle began. This smoke and fog made it nearly impossible for the opposing forces to see each other except by crouching down low. This served to help the defenders more since they were mainly lying behind their works and not attempting to get to them through the mud as the Confederate attackers were attempting to do. They also could simply fire into a narrow area where the Confederates had to attack and achieve effective results.Foote, vol. 3, 1974, p. 75; Josephy, 1991, p. 214 The mud and standing water prevented cavalry and artillery from participating much in the battle. In fact, the Confederates lost three artillery pieces to a charge by the 2nd Kansas Colored Infantry and the 29th Iowa Infantry regiments from their fortified positions. After Price's forces under Brigadier-Generals Churchill and Parsons had made little progress, Kirby Smith came up with the large Texas infantry division under Major-General John Walker. Walker carried on the attack in the same manner as the previous divisions had done, brigade by brigade. All three Confederate brigade commanders under Walker were wounded in these attacks. Two of them, Brigadier-General William Scurry and Colonel Horace Randal were mortally wounded. U.S. Brigadier-General Samuel Rice also was mortally wounded in the final Confederate assault at Jenkins' Ferry. After taking about 1,000 casualties in their repeated attacks against the well- fortified Federal troops while inflicting only about 700 casualties on the defenders, including the capture of stragglers, the Confederates gave up the piecemeal attacks on the Federal position. Before leaving the field, some African-American soldiers of the 2nd Kansas Colored regiment shot Confederate wounded near Rice's line in retaliation for the shooting of African-American soldiers who were trying to surrender at Poison Spring and the killing of wounded African-American soldiers at Marks' Mill. By about 3:00 p.m. on April 30, 1864, the Federal forces finally crossed the Saline River with all their remaining men and the artillery pieces and equipment and supply wagons which were not irretrievably stuck in the mud, which they burned. Steele's forces were compelled to abandon many more wagons in the swamp north of the Saline River.Josephy, 1991, p. 215 The Confederates did not renew the attack as Steele's men crossed the pontoon bridge on the afternoon of April 30. Not only were the Confederates exhausted from the morning's battle, but the Federal forces had set up artillery and infantry on the opposite side of the river to protect the remaining Federal soldiers as they crossed the bridge. After crossing the Saline River, Steele's forces cut and burned the pontoon bridge, which they would not need for the remainder of their march. With no way to get across the river, the Confederates could not follow them. By not trapping Steele's force at Camden or cutting them off before they reached the Saline River, the Confederates under Kirby Smith lost a good chance to destroy Steele's army, which was the major portion of Federal forces in Arkansas. After crossing the river and three days' further march, Steele's forces regrouped within the fortifications of Little Rock.Foote, vol. 3, 1974, p. 77; Faust, 1986, p. 107  Aftermath  Monument to Confederate dead Considering the numbers engaged and percentage of casualties, the battle of Jenkins' Ferry was one of the Civil War's bloodiest battles. Both armies paid dearly for the engagement. The Confederates officially reported 86 men killed, 356 wounded, and one missing for a total of 443 casualties. The numbers would doubtless have been much higher, perhaps 800 to 1,000, if Walker's Texas division's losses were known. Walker filed no report on the battle. Officially reported but incomplete Federal casualties were 63 killed, 413 wounded, and 45 missing, a total of 521 casualties.Eicher, 2001, p. 654 gives lower numbers and a more even distribution of casualties: U.S. 64 killed, 378 wounded, 86 missing; C.S. 86 killed 356 wounded, 1 missing, without mentioning the incomplete reports. The U.S. total casualty figure was incomplete because Brigadier-General John Thayer filed no report. As noted above, in view of the incomplete or missing casualty reports, historians Shelby Foote and Gregory J. W. Urwin in the Heidlers' Encyclopedia of the American Civil War used 1,000 and 700 as the best estimate of total Confederate and Federal casualty figures, respectively, for this battle. The Battle of Jenkins' Ferry may be counted as a Federal victory, at least tactically.The National Park Service battle summary calls it a \\"U.S. victory in retreat.\\" National Park Service summary of Jenkins' Ferry. Retrieved July 22, 2014 Not only did the Confederates sustain more casualties, but Steele's Federal troops successfully held back the attacking Confederates. This allowed the Federal forces time and space to move most of their remaining wagons, artillery, equipment, cavalry and infantry across the Saline River and to escape back to the safety of Little Rock. Yet, Steele's victory was hollow from a strategic viewpoint. Kirby Smith's forces held the battlefield, prevented Steele from joining with or further assisting Banks and forced Steele's continued retreat back to Little Rock. In the campaign overall, Steele had lost 3,000 men to Smith's loss of 2,000. Many of Kirby Smith's men were lightly wounded. Steele had lost 10 artillery pieces to balance with 3 captured. He also lost 635 wagons, 2,500 mules, enough horses to mount a cavalry brigade and a long list of captured material, including ammunition, food and medical supplies.Foote, vol. 3, 1974, p.76. McPherson, 2005, p. 150 gives slightly different overall casualty figures, stating that Steele had lost almost 2,500 soldiers while the Confederates lost about half that many. The Federal force lost General Rice while the Confederate force lost General Scurry and Colonel Randal. Kirby Smith's last hope to destroy Steele's army outside of his well-fortified base at Little Rock was dashed as a result of the mismanaged, disjointed and piecemeal attacks at Jenkins' Ferry. Although the Federal position and weather conditions limited Confederate options, a more concentrated effort appears to have been possible. The Confederates also failed to concentrate on the Federals' more vulnerable left flank at the outset, choosing instead to pursue frontal assaults across Kelly's field, where the Southern lines of infantry were devastated by Federal fire. Assuming Rice had left this weak spot in, or just beyond, his defenses, the Confederates' early missed opportunity to attack in this area with concentrated force allowed Rice to see the possible vulnerability in his position and to extend and protect the left flank of the Federal line. After the Federal left flank was closed off, any opportunity for a successful Confederate attack at that point and any realistic chance Kirby Smith and Price might have had to trap most of Steele's force was gone. After his situation had become hopeless at Camden, Steele gave up all thoughts of uniting with Banks on the Red River in a further campaign to take Shreveport and realized that he had to save his army. The battle of Jenkins' Ferry showed that Steele's force indeed was in danger while it was at Camden and southwest of the Saline River. Steele's decision to retreat to Little Rock therefore was a good one. Banks in turn had to give up any hope of renewing his campaign against Shreveport. His major problems in renewing the campaign actually did not include an insufficient number of men, however, because he was reinforced in late April by forces under Major-General John McClernand. Banks had logistical problems and would not have gunboat transport and support because of Porter's inability to operate in the unusually low water of the Red River during that spring and summer. In fact, Banks had to protect Porter's fleet at Alexandria, Louisiana until it could be freed from the Red River on May 13 before he could move in any direction.Faust, 1986, p. 620; Foote, vol. 3, 1974, pp. 61, 84. Foote states that Banks and his forces left Alexandria on May 13, the day after Porter was able to get past the rapids near Alexandria, which allowed Porter's flotilla to make it back to the Mississippi River. Despite some Confederate disappointment in not destroying, through casualties or capture, most of the U.S. forces engaged in the Red River Campaign, the Confederates had a considerable tactical victory. The Federals lost over 8,000 men in the Red River Campaign, including the Camden Expedition, and returned to their starting points at the end of it. The Confederates lost about 6,500. The Confederates captured 57 artillery pieces, about a thousand wagons, most of them loaded, and 3,500 horses and mules.Foote, vol. 3, 1974, p. 91 As Shelby Foote noted, the Confederates also gained a strategic victory in the Red River Campaign. They were able to delay the return of Brigadier-General Andrew Smith's 10,000-man force to Major-General Sherman's army for use in the Atlanta Campaign. Also, about 20,000 Confederate soldiers from Alabama were able to reinforce General Joe Johnston in his defense against Sherman. These forces otherwise might have been engaged in Alabama had Banks attacked Mobile, Alabama, as Lieutenant-General Grant would have preferred, rather than attempt to take Shreveport under Halleck's plan.Shelby Foote stated, in fairness to Banks, even Banks would have preferred to move against Mobile rather than against Shreveport. The United States Army tied up significant forces in the Red River Campaign and lost significant numbers of artillery pieces, wagons, mules and supplies that could have been used in the more decisive campaigns further east. Yet, Kirby Smith could not get his forces back to Alexandria in time for a further attempt to capture or destroy Banks's force. The disruption and retreat of Federal forces in Arkansas also cleared the way for Price's 1864 invasion of Missouri. Ultimately that campaign provided no long term benefit to the Confederates, who were driven out of Missouri again after the Battle of Westport and the consequent offensive by U.S. cavalry under Major- General Alfred Pleasonton, which defeated the Confederates in 4 battles in 5 days following the battle of Westport.Heidler, ed., 2000, p. 2093, Article on \\"Battle of Westport\\" by Mark J.

Blest Gana was of Irish and Basque descent.http://cvc.cervantes.es/el_rinconete/anteriores/julio_07/04072007_01.asp Biography He was born in Santiago, the son of an Irishman, William Cunningham Blest, and of Mar√≠a de la Luz Gana Darrigrandi, from an aristocratic landowning family. He studied at the Military Academy and then for one year in France. A liberal, Alberto Blest was named intendant of the province of Colchagua and starting 1866 he was Chilean diplomatic representative at Washington, London and Paris. Among his successes were the inclusion of Chile in the Universal Postal Union and the purchase of armament for Chilean troops during the War of the Pacific. He also participated at border negotiations with Argentina, but with a less important role than his previous activities. Blest Gana passionately read the novels of Honor√© de Balzac. Upon his return home, he virtually founded the Chilean novel by adapting European techniques to some ten novels portraying various aspects of national history and life. Of these, the most important is Mart√≠n Rivas (1862), which describes the career of a young man during the 1851 political revolt. Abundant local color and social criticism accompany the action of the novel. Although these elements of description are not brought to life and fused with the plot in the manner of Balzac, the novel achieved great success as the first realistic portrayal of Chilean life. After its publication, Blest Gana entered the diplomatic service and was Chilean ambassador to France and Britain for many years. Other novels of this first period are The Arithmetic of Love () (1860) and El ideal de un calavera (The Rake's Ideal, 1863). Upon his retirement from diplomacy, Blest Gana returned to writing novels. Strongly influenced by his reading of the new masters of the form, he produced his best work. Four novels from this second period of creative activity are Durante la reconquista (During the Reconquest, 1897), Los transplantados (The Exiles, 1904), El loco Estero (Estero the Mad, 1909), and Gladys Fairfield (1912). El loco Estero is about the Chile of Blest Gana's childhood. The lively adventure and love intrigue infused with nostalgia qualify this novel as Blest Gana's greatest work. His literary work - almost exclusively novels - followed the aesthetic ideals and themes of the European Realism, but with a conscious \\"Americanization\\" of themes, as a way of making the genre fit (and educational enough) to be read by a national audience. His writings were explicitly influenced by 19th century liberalism, but they are also an attempt to reconcile religious and moral ideals of his time. Notable among his novels are Mart√≠n Rivas (published 1862, about the social rise of a poor, middle-class young man, which is considered the first Chilean novel), El ideal de un Talavera (1863), Durante la Reconquista (1879 historical novel of the period 1814-1817); Los Trasplantados (1906) and El Loco Estero (1909 with pleasant remembrances of childhood). His ability to describe characters and customs has been praised by critics now, as well as at the time of publishing. Despite his non-literary education, which accounts for his careless style and excess of gallicisms, his work is considered fundamental, in terms of their representation of the customs, morals and ideals of 19th century Chileans. Martin Rivas was translated into English by Tess O'Dwyer and published by Oxford University Press in 2000. He also wrote a comedy: El jefe de familia (1858). His brother Guillermo Blest Gana was a noted poet and author. Alberto Blest Gana died, aged 90, in Paris.

The 134th episode of the series overall, it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on October 26, 2005. Plot Cartman gathers the boys together in his basement to show them a videotape of the girls of South Park Elementary using a device, which he believes is a high-tech gadget that gives them the ability to see into the future (in reality, it is a paper fortune teller). The boys build a containment center to study the device, and devise a plan to steal it. The boys fake Butters' death by dropping a pig cadaver dressed as him from the Bowery Building. Stephen and Linda Stotch are devastated at the apparent death of their son and the funeral is held a few days later. Butters then dresses up as a new girl, \\"Marjorine\\", and infiltrates a slumber party hosted by classmate Heidi Turner, in an attempt to retrieve the device. At first the girls are cold and hostile towards \\"Marjorine\\" and consistently make fun of her until Butters takes the insults seriously and winds up crying in the bathroom, at which point the rest of the girls apologize and offer a makeover. Meanwhile, Linda is still distraught and heartbroken by the loss of her son, and Stephen is deeply troubled by her sorrow, also missing Butters. Unprompted, he is told by an old farmer not to dig up Butters' body and re- bury him at the Indian burial ground. Stephen‚Äîwho had no intention of doing such a thing until the old man put the notion in his head‚Äîexhumes Butters' \\"remains\\" and reburies the pig carcass at the Indian burial ground, believing this will bring Butters back to life. Butters (as Marjorine) is just starting to have fun after being made over and is now dancing with the girls when Heidi's father realizes that there are boys around the house. Butters believes his cover is blown and makes a desperate escape with the fortune-telling device and gives it to the other boys. Stan tells Butters to come along to learn about the device, but he refuses, saying that the device is nothing but trouble and his job is done and goes home to tell his parents that he is not dead. When the boys attempt to ask so many questions with the device, Stan realizes what Butters has meant. The boys, this time around, decide that the power of the fortune-telling device is too great for any mortal. Rather than spending their lives defending it from girls, the CIA, terrorists and the Russians, they decide to destroy it by having Kenny blow it up (with enough force that it completely incinerates all the trees in the surrounding forest and is visible from space, to which Cartman merely responds \\"Damn, Ken.\\") Meanwhile, Butters' parents have now convinced themselves that their child will return as a demon. Butters knocks on the door but they do not want to see him back from the dead, in a reference to The Monkey's Paw. Butters returns home to his terrified parents who lock him in the basement and chain him up. When he says he is hungry, his father wallops a saleswoman with a shovel in front of him and offers up her corpse to feed on, still believing Butters to be hell-spawn. The episode ends with Butters asking for SpaghettiOs instead. Production On the DVD commentary, Trey Parker and Matt Stone reveal that they find this episode unbearable to watch, mainly because they felt that there were too many ideas packed into one episode. They wished that they split the stories into two episodes and felt that the episode served as a reminder to keep future episodes simple.Trey Parker and Matt Stone, DVD commentary for \\"Marjorine\\".

On January 1, 2004, the independent municipality merged with Zimmerwald to form the new municipality of Wald BE. Situated on the L√§ngenberg, above the valley of the Aare river, it combines the villages of Englisberg and K√ºhlewil. Englisberg is first documented in 1166 [Endlisperc]. It is believed that Englisberg was created out of the much older village of K√ºhlewil [Cullenwil, Cullenwilare - originally of Celtic origin] the latter of which having since attained the status of a hamlet of the former. In the 14th century a castle is documented in Englisberg, owned by the family of the same name. It was abandoned by the following 15th century and quickly fell into disrepair and disintegration. The feudal rights over Englisberg were acquired by the von Erlach family of Bern in 1433 and passed in 1542 to the Baumgartner family of the same place. After 1570, these feudal rights were sold to local farming families Guggisberg and Zimmermann which over the course of several generations were split into 70 shares. In the 18th century, these rights were successively purchased by the aristocratic von Graffenried and von Tscharner families seated at the Lohn estate in Kehrsatz only to lose it all when Switzerland was invaded by the French in 1798 that resulted in the abolishment of the ancient order. Englisberg belonged until 1798 to the high court district of Seftigen. Ecclesiastically Englisberg was part of the evangelical reformed parish church of neighboring Belp till 1699 and thereafter was integrated into the newly created parish of Zimmerwald.Staatsarchiv Bern: Urkundensammlung, Udelbuch of 1389, Contractmanuale of Seftigen District 16th - 18th centuryGemeindearchiv Englisberg, Wald BE: Urkundensammlung, GemeinderatsprotokolleLeu, Johann Jacob: Allgemeines Helvetisches, Eydgen√∂ssisches, Oder Schweitzerisches Lexicon, Z√ºrich 1746-1765K√∂niz, Ludwig F.: Historische, geographische und physikalische Beschreybung des Schweizerlandes, volume II, Bern 1783Gruner, Gottlieb: Versuch einer physisch-statistisch-√∂konomischen Beschreibung der Gemeinde Wiegewohnt, manuscript by pastor Gottlieb Gruner, 1823, Stadt- und Universit√§tsbibliothek BernJahn, Albert: Der Kanton Bern, Bern 1853Fontes Rerum Bernensium, Berns Geschichtsquellen, volumes 1 through 10, published by St√§mpfliverlag Bern, 1883-1956Knapp, Charles; Borel, Maurice; Attinger, Victor and Brunner, Heinrich: Geographisches Lexikon der Schweiz, volume 2, Soci√©t√© neuch√¢teloise de g√©ographie, Neuch√¢tel 1904Anonymous: Heimatkunde des Amtes Seftigen, Bern 1906Anonymous: Historisch-Biographisches Lexikon der Schweiz, volume 3, Neuch√¢tel 1927Weilenmann, Heinz: Die Herrschaft Englisberg, in \\"Berner Zeitschrift f√ºr Geschichte und Heimatkunde\\", Bern 1961Br√∂nnimann, Fritz: Beitr√§ge zur Geschichte und Heimatkunde des L√§ngenberges, Wie entstand unsere Gemeinde, parts 1 and 2, published by the village of Zimmerwald, 1988Guggisberg, Daniel: Feuerst√§ttenz√§hlung 1558 in der Kirchgemeinde Belp, Mitteilungen der Genealogisch-Heraldischen Gesellschaft Bern. - Bern. - volume 19 (31 May 2000), pages 14‚Äì27Guggisberg, D.

In 1493 he returned to Hamburg as theological lecturer, canon and prebendary in St. Mary's Cathedral. By the Senate of Hamburg he was employed on more than one diplomatic mission abroad, and in 1500 he was chosen by the king of Denmark and the duke of Holstein as arbiter in their dispute regarding the province of Dithmarschen. As dean of the cathedral chapter, to which office he was appointed in 1508, Krantz applied himself with zeal to the reform of ecclesiastical abuses, but, though opposed to various corruptions connected with church discipline, he had little sympathy with the drastic measures of Wycliffe or Huss. With Martin Luther's protest against the abuse of Indulgences he was in general sympathy, but with the reformer's later attitude he could not agree. When, on his death-bed, he heard of the ninety-five theses, he is said, on good authority, to have exclaimed: \\"Brother, Brother, go into thy cell and say, God have mercy upon me!\\" Krantz died on December 7, 1517. Krantz was the author of a number of historical works which for the period when they were written are characterized by exceptional impartiality and research.

Biography Elia Wilkinson was the daughter of Frederick and Amanda (Cahill) Wilkinson.Men and Women of America, 1910 She was born on January 15, 1862,Herringshaw, T. W., Herringshaw's National Library of American Biography, 5 vols, 1909-14 in Kalamazoo, Michigan, but moved with her family to Chicago when she was young. She stopped attending school when she was fourteen, but kept up a reading habit. In 1883 she married Robert Burns Peattie, a Chicago journalist. She began writing short stories for newspapers, and in 1886 became a reporter with the Chicago Tribune and subsequently the Chicago Daily News. In 1888 the family moved to Omaha after Peattie and her husband accepted jobs at the Omaha Daily Herald. When Gilbert Hitchcock bought the Daily Herald and combined it into the Omaha World-Herald Peattie became chief editorial writer for the paper. Peattie wrote over 800 columns, editorials, and stories in the World- Herald offering a voice to frontier women. Peattie did not limit her articles to societal pieces and was active in political discourse. A supporter of orphanages, charity hospitals, and the need for shelters she also took a hard line and was outspoken in her opposition of capital punishment, lynching, and the Wounded Knee Massacre. She wrote for magazines including Century, Lippincott's Magazine, Cosmopolitan Magazine, St. Nicholas, Wide Awake, The American Magazine, America, Harper's Weekly, and San Francisco Argonaut. In these stories Peattie presented hope and refused to bend to Modernism and its disillusioned outlook on life. In 1888 she was commissioned by Chicago publishers to write a young people's history of the United States, and wrote the seven-hundred page The Story of America in four months. Her novel The Judge won a $900 prize from the Detroit Free Press in 1889, and was subsequently published in book form. Later in 1889 the Northern Pacific Railroad employed her to visit and report on Alaska: A Trip through Wonderland became a popular guide-book. With Scrip and Staff (1891) was a story of the children's crusade. Some time after 1890, Peattie befriended fellow writer Kate McPhelim Cleary while both were living in Nebraska. The two bonded over their financial, health, and family concerns.George, Susanne K. Kate M. Cleary: A Literary Biography with Selected Works. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1997: 15‚Äì16.

His father died when he was very young, and his uncle placed him at the Latin school, where he showed great promise. His uncle later apprenticed him to an apothecary, with whom he lived several years. Not liking this employment, he entered the army, and in 1674 was sent with his regiment to America, in the fleet under Admiral Michiel de Ruyter, but returned to Holland the same year. In 1678 he was sent to the garrison at Utrecht, where he contracted a friendship with the celebrated Graevius; here he had the misfortune to be so deeply implicated in a duel that, according to the laws of Holland, his life was forfeited. Graevius, however, wrote immediately to Nicholas Heinsius, who obtained his pardon. Not long afterwards he became a captain of one of the companies then at Amsterdam. After the Treaty of Ryswick in 1697, his company was disbanded, and he retired on a pension to a country house near Amsterdam and pursued his classical and literary studies at leisure.

H. Margetson's illustration for Legends of King Arthur and His Knights (1914) Sir Balin le Savage , also known as the Knight with the Two Swords, is a character in the Arthurian legend. Like Sir Galahad, Sir Balin is a late addition to the medieval Arthurian world. His story, as told by Thomas Malory in Le Morte d'Arthur, is based upon that told in the continuation of the second book of the Post-Vulgate cycle of legend, the Suite du Merlin. A knight before the Round Table was formed, Sir Balin lives only for a few weeks following his release from King Arthur's prison and his subsequent slaying of a Lady of the Lake. Just prior to his departure, his destiny is sealed by the arrival of a mysterious damsel bearing a sword that only the \\"most virtuous\\" knight in Arthur's court will be able to draw; Balin draws this sword easily. His adventures end when Balin and his brother Balan destroy each other in single combat, fulfilling an earlier prophecy about the destiny of the bearer of the damsel's sword. Prior to his tragic end, this ill-fated knight contrives to inflict a \\"Dolorous Stroke\\" with the spear that pierced Christ upon the Cross, thus setting the scene for the Post-Vulgate version of the search for the Holy Grail. Merlin tells Arthur Balin would have been his best and bravest knight. Medieval sources The story of Sir Balin and his brother Balan is found in Thomas Malory's epic retelling of the Arthurian legend, Le Morte d'Arthur (Book II, The Ballad of Balin and Balan).Lupack, Alan, 2005, reprinted in paperback, 2007.

Malory: Works. Oxford University Press. Balin or the Knight with the Two Swords, pp 37-59. Perhaps uniquely among the significant knights of King Arthur's court, Balin never joins the Round Table, dying before that institution is founded. Despite Sir Balin being proven, by his drawing of the sword, to be \\"a passing good man of his hands and of his deeds, and without villainy or trechery and without treason,\\" his distinguishing characteristic, as portrayed by Malory, is impetuosity.Vinaver, Eugene, 1971. Malory: Works. Oxford University Press. Balin or the Knight with the Two Swords, pp 37-59. =King Arthur's court= King Arthur is virile and strong, near the beginning of his reign. Balin is a poor knight who hails from Northumberland and has been in Arthur's prison for six months. Having been imprisoned for \\"half a year\\"Vinaver, Eugene, 1971. Malory: Works. Oxford University Press. Balin or the Knight with the Two Swords, p 39, line 5. for the death of a cousin of Arthur's, Balin is released at about the same time that a damsel sent from the lady Lily of Avalon comes to court with a sword that she reveals she is wearing when she lets her fur mantle fall to the floor. This sword can only be drawn from its scabbard by a truly virtuous knight, or so she claims. After many, including Arthur himself, have attempted to pull this sword out, Balin asks for a chance to try. However, it was a trap, so Sir Balin could kill Sir Balan. The Damsel Warns Sir Balin, Henry Justice Ford's illustration for Andrew Lang's The Book of Romance (1902) The damsel is at first reluctant to allow a knight who has just been released from prison to attempt the trial. But she does and Balin succeeds in drawing the sword and claiming it as his own. The damsel regrets her initial presumptuousness, but then further chastises Balin when he refuses to return the sword to her. She is not angry but concerned for him, because if he does not return the sword to her, he will suffer for it. The damsel leaves, but not before warning Balin that he will kill, with this sword, his greatest friend, the one whom he loves the best, and it will cause his own destruction. Shortly thereafter, the Lady of the Lake, in pursuit of a feud between her family and Balin's, arrives to ask King Arthur for Balin's head. She demands it as payment for Excalibur, the sword that she has given to Arthur. King Arthur agrees to pay her for the sword, but not to her demand for the head of Balin, whom she claims has killed her brother, or the head of the damsel, whom she claims caused her father's death. Balin, upon hearing that the woman who was the cause of his mother's wrongful execution is in court, impetuously strikes off the lady's head with the cry: \\"You wanted my head and so I shall take yours!\\" Balin validates his swift action by making known his claim that the lady caused his own mother to be burned to death. Arthur is unimpressed by this plea, however, and insists that even were the claim true, Balin ought to have withheld his sword in the royal court, and against such a lady. Arthur then banishes Balin from his court. Merlin arrives and explains that the damsel with the sword was actually a false traitor, who was angry with her own brother, a good knight who slew her lover. With the help of the lady Lily of Avalon, this damsel had sought revenge for her lover's death through that sword, whose holder is destined to slay his own brother. Although logic may suggest that Balin and this damsel might therefore share a brother, there is no indication from Malory that this is the case. Merlin explains this all to the court; he explains how the sword came to be where it was and its intended purpose. This explanation that Merlin gives may have evolved through re- tellings of the story and through inconsistencies in the legend, but it is clear from Merlin that this sword that Balin has taken from the damsel bears a curse of some kind. The sword seemed to have been based on Tyrfing of Norse mythology. =King Rience= Tragedy soon begins to haunt Balin. One of Arthur's knights, Sir Lanceor of Ireland, jealous that he was not the one to pull the accursed sword free of its scabbard, and with the approval of King Arthur, sets out in pursuit of Balin to slay him. Sir Balin kills him. This knight's damsel Colombe, however, appears suddenly and, overcome with grief, commits suicide by falling upon her lover's own sword. Balin then meets his brother Balan, also in disfavour of King Arthur, who has come to Arthur's country looking for him. They agree to set off together to do battle with King Rience, who has refused to acknowledge King Arthur as his sovereign and is making war against him. Balin wants to do this as a way of winning back King Arthur's love, but before they can leave on this mission, a dwarf appears, lamenting the death of the knight whom Balin has just killed and the woman who committed suicide beside him. The dwarf declares that this knight's brother will seek revenge on Balin. King Mark of Cornwall appears and builds a tomb for the fallen knight and his damsel. Then Merlin appears and prophesies that Sir Lancelot and Sir Tristram will do battle on this very same site and that because of the death of the damsel, Balin will strike the most Dolorous Stroke ever committed by man, except for the Stroke which pierced Christ's Side on the Cross. Merlin then vanishes. King Mark asks Balin his name before he departs and Balan answers that, because he wears two swords, his brother should be known as the Knight with the Two Swords. With Merlin's help, Balin and Balan capture King Rience and take him to King Arthur in order to regain their lost honour for Arthur. The brothers succeeded in ambushing Rience en route to sleep with the Lady de Vance and brought the king before Arthur. Rience's capture resulted in the forming of an alliance of twelve rebel kings, including King Rience's brother, King Nero. Nero brings up an army and a great battle takes place beside Castle Terrabil. King Arthur kills Nero while Balin and Balan do great deeds of arms fighting on Arthur's side. At last King Lot of Orkney, who has been prevented until now from joining in the engagement by a prescient Merlin, advances with eleven other rebel kings, thinking that Arthur's forces are now spent. King Lot is killed by King Pellinore and the other rebel kings are killed as well. King Arthur kills twenty knights that day and maims forty, and the battle is won. =Wasteland= Soon after the funeral of the rebel kings, Balin sets out to avenge a man slain by an invisible knight while travelling under his protection. The villain is the brother of the Grail king Pellam, and Balin kills him at a feast in Pellam's castle. Pellam immediately seeks revenge for this act, breaking the weapon Balin used. Searching for a weapon with which to defend himself, Balin unknowingly grabs the Spear of Longinus and stabs Pellam with it: this is the Dolorous Stroke that maims Pellam, turns the Grail kingdom into the Wasteland, and brings the castle down on Balin's and Pellam's heads. Three days pass, then Merlin digs Balin out of the rubble. The Death of Balin and Balan, H. J. Ford's illustration for The Book of Romance Balin rides through the Wasteland, receiving rebukes for causing such death and devastation; but as the days pass he finds himself in fairer countryside and at last arrives at a castle where he is compelled to fight with its resident defender. This defender is his brother Balan, who has earned this role against his will by killing the previous occupier of the position, in a situation that is reminiscent of that at the Sacred Grove of Nemi, as described by Sir James Frazer in The Golden Bough.Frazer, James, 1922.

Neither brother recognises that his opponent is his brother: Balan being in unfamiliar and disguising red armour with an unrecognisable shield; Balin having been persuaded just before the battle to swap his own shield for a better one immediately before the duel.

His father, Alfred Edwin Brain Sr. was a member of the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) horn quartet. His brother Alfred was for many years principal horn player in the Queen's Hall Orchestra under Sir Henry Wood. He went to the United States to join the Damrosch Orchestra in 1923, and remained permanently, becoming an American citizen. In 1911 Aubrey Brain won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music. He was appointed principal horn of the New Symphony Orchestra that same year, and in 1912 he went on the LSO's tour of the United States under Arthur Nikisch. He was principal horn of Sir Thomas Beecham's opera company orchestra in 1913. In 1923 he succeeded his teacher Borsdorf as professor of horn at the Royal Academy of Music, where his son Dennis was among his students.

He and Jelly d'Ar√°nyi premiered the work under Sir Henry Wood on 5 March 1927. He also played it in Berlin with Marjorie Hayward. He joined the BBC Symphony Orchestra as principal horn, and remained there until illness caused his premature retirement in 1943. He was often a soloist, and made a number of recordings He had a marked preference for French instruments, and played a hand horn made by Labbaye in c. 1865, to which English-made valves had been added. He would never permit the use of large-bore German horns in the BBC SO. He married Marion Beeley, a singer at Covent Garden. His two sons were Dennis Brain, even more famous as a horn player, and Leonard Brain, an oboist.

This is in contrast to the standard superheterodyne receiver where this is accomplished only after an initial conversion to an intermediate frequency.mwrf.com: The Differences Between Receiver Types, Part 1 Quote: \\"...A direct-conversion receiver, also known as a homodyne or zero-IF receiver, is one type of receiver architecture (Fig. 1). Direct-conversion receivers convert an RF signal to a 0-Hz signal in one stage...\\", backup The simplification of performing only a single frequency conversion reduces the basic circuit complexity but other issues arise, for instance, regarding dynamic range. In its original form it was unsuited to receiving AM and FM signals without implementing an elaborate phase locked loop. Although these and other technical challenges made this technique rather impractical around the time of its invention (1930's), current technology, and software radio in particular, have revived its use in certain areas including some consumer products. Principle of operation A block diagram of the direct conversion receiver The conversion of the modulated signal to baseband is done in a single frequency conversion. This avoids the complexity of the superheterodyne's two (or more) frequency conversions, IF stage(s), and image rejection issues. The received radio frequency signal is fed directly into a frequency mixer, just as in a superheterodyne receiver. However unlike the superheterodyne, the frequency of the local oscillator is not offset from, but identical to, the received signal's frequency. The result is a demodulated output just as would be obtained from a superheterodyne receiver using synchronous detection (a product detector) following an intermediate frequency (IF) stage. Technical issues To match the performance of the superheterodyne receiver, a number of the functions normally addressed by the IF stage must be accomplished at baseband. Since there is no high gain IF amplifier utilizing automatic gain control (AGC), the baseband output level may vary over a very wide range dependent on the received signal strength. This is one major technical challenge which limited the practicability of the design. Another issue is the inability of this design to implement envelope detection of AM signals. Thus direct demodulation of AM or FM signals (as used in broadcasting) requires phase locking the local oscillator to the carrier frequency, a much more demanding task compared to the more robust envelope detector or ratio detector at the output of an IF stage in a superheterodyne design. However this can be avoided in the case of a direct-conversion design using quadrature detection followed by digital signal processing. Using software radio techniques, the two quadrature outputs can be processed in order to perform any sort of demodulation and filtering on down-converted signals from frequencies close to the local oscillator frequency. The proliferation of digital hardware, along with refinements in the analog components involved in the frequency conversion to baseband, has thus made this simpler topology practical in many applications. History and applications The homodyne was developed in 1932 by a team of British scientists searching for a design to surpass the superheterodyne (two stage conversion model). The design was later renamed the \\"synchrodyne\\". Not only did it have superior performance due to the single conversion stage, but it also had reduced circuit complexity and power consumption. The design suffered from the thermal drift of the local oscillator which changed its frequency over time. To counteract this drift, the frequency of the local oscillator was compared with the broadcast input signal by a phase detector. This produced a correction voltage which would vary the local oscillator frequency keeping it in lock with the wanted signal. This type of feedback circuit evolved into what is now known as a phase-locked loop. While the method has existed for several decades, it had been difficult to implement due largely to component tolerances, which must be of small variation for this type of circuit to function successfully. =Advantages= Unwanted by-product beat signals from the mixing stage do not need any further processing, as they are completely rejected by use of a low-pass filter at the audio output stage. The receiver design has the additional advantage of high selectivity, and is therefore a precision demodulator. The design principles can be extended to permit separation of adjacent channel broadcast signals whose sidebands may overlap the wanted transmission. The design also improves the detection of pulse- modulated transmission mode signals. =Disadvantages= Signal leakage paths can occur in the receiver. The high audio frequency gain required can result in difficulty in rejecting mains hum. Local-oscillator energy can leak through the mixer stage to the antenna input and then reflect back into the mixer stage. The overall effect is that the local oscillator energy will self-mix and create a DC offset signal. The offset may be large enough to overload the baseband amplifiers and prevent receiving the wanted signal. There are design modifications that deal with this issue, but they add to the complexity of the receiver. The additional design complexity often outweighs the benefits of a direct-conversion receiver. =Modern usage= Wes Hayward and Dick Bingham's 1968 article brought new interest in direct-conversion designs. The development of the integrated circuit and incorporation of complete phase- locked loop devices in low-cost IC packages made this design widely accepted. Usage is no longer limited to the reception of AM radio signals, but also find use in processing more complex modulation methods. Direct-conversion receivers are now incorporated into many receiver applications, including cellphones, televisions, avionics, medical imaging apparatus and Software-defined radio systems.

Early life Federico Borromeo was born in Milan as the second son of Giulio Cesare Borromeo, Count of Arona, and Margherita Trivulzio. The family was influential in both the secular and ecclesiastical spheres and Federico was cousin of Saint Charles Borromeo, the latter previous Archbishop of Milan and a leading figure during the Counter-Reformation. He studied in Bologna with Cardinal Gabriele Paleotti and in 1580, at the age of 16, he asked to become a Jesuit. His cousin Charles Borromeo dissuaded him and sent him to the Collegio Borromeo of Pavia where he remained five years. In May 1585 he earned a doctorate in theology at the University of Pavia. Following the death of his cousin Charles, he was sent to Rome for higher studies, where he was strongly influenced by Philip Neri, Caesar Baronius and Robert Bellarmine. Federico Borromeo was created cardinal by Pope Sixtus V on 18 December 1587, at the age of only 23 years. As cardinal, he participated in the papal conclaves of 1590, 1591, 1592, 1605 and 1623 (he was absent from the election of 1621). His attendance in the first conclave of 1590 at the age of 26 made him one of the youngest Cardinals to participate in the election of a pontiff. In Rome, Federico was not particularly interested in political issues, but he focused on scholarship and prayer. He collaborated on the issuing of the Sixto-Clementine Vulgate and to the publication of the acts of the Council of Trent. Archbishop of Milan On 24 April 1595 Pope Clement VIII appointed Federico Archbishop of Milan, and consecrated him bishop on 11 June 1595 in Rome. He followed the example of his elder cousin in promoting the discipline of the clergy, founding churches and colleges at his own expense, and applying everywhere the reformed principles set by the Council of Trent. In 1609 he founded the Biblioteca Ambrosiana, a college of writers, a seminary of savants, a school of fine arts, and, after the Bodleian at Oxford, the first genuinely public library in Europe. Borromeo had the famous Saint Charles Borromeo statue erected in Arona, supported the development of the Sacro Monte of Varese (today a World Heritage site), and participated in the embellishment of the Duomo di Milano where he is buried. One of Saint Bartholomew, Brugherio's most notable events was to the Papal recognition of a portion of the relics of the three Magi, believed to have been transferred in Cologne by Borromeo on 27 May 1613. these were transferred from saint Ambrogio's church, while under the supervision of the parish priest Francesco Bernardino Paleario. He is most notable for his efforts to feed the poor of Milan during the great famine of 1627‚Äì1628. He took part in eight Papal conclaves. Federico Borromeo died in Milan on 21 September 1631 at the age of 67. Works Federico Borromeo Archiepiscopalis fori Sanctae Mediolanensis Ecclesiae taxae, 1624 Federico Borromeo composed some 71 printed and 46 manuscript books written mostly in Latin that treat of various ecclesiastical sciences. His more known works are Meditamenta litteraria (1619), De gratia principum (1625), De suis studiis commentarius (1627), De ecstaticis mulieribus et illusis (1616), De acquirendo contemplationis habitu, De assidua oratione, De naturali ecstasi (1617), De vita Catharinae Senensis monacae conversae (1618), Tractatus habiti ad sacras virgines (1620-3), De cognitionibus quas habent daemones (1624) and De linguis, nominibus et numero angelorum (1628). = Other works = * Legacy Federico Borromeo appears as a character in Alessandro Manzoni‚Äôs novel The Betrothed (I promessi sposi), in which he is characterized as an intelligent humanist and saintly servant of Christ, serving the people of Milan unselfishly during the 1630 plague. In 1685 the citizens of Milan erected a marble statue of him next to the gates of the Biblioteca Ambrosiana. While at the service of Federico Borromeo, Aquilino Coppini published in 1607 his book of sacred madrigals with contrafacta texts prepared by him, based on works by Claudio Monteverdi and others.

The works of Fenoglio have two main themes: the rural world of the Langhe and the Italian resistance movement, both largely inspired by his own personal experiences in them; equally, the writer has two styles: the chronicle and the epos. Fenoglio was drafted in 1943; before he completed officer school, Italy surrendered to the Allies and Germany attacked and occupied most of Italy. Like most of Italian Army, the training unit of Fenoglio collapsed; he adventurously travelled back home from Rome, and spent months in hiding before joining the partisans in January 1944. After fighting till the end of the war, he translated a number of books from English and wrote the works he is known for while working for a winery in Alba. His first work was in the neorealist style: La paga del sabato (this was published posthumously too, in 1969). The novel was turned down by Elio Vittorini, who advised Fenoglio to carve out stories and then incorporate them into I ventitr√© giorni della citt√† di Alba (\\"The twenty-three days of the city of Alba\\") (1952). These stories were a chronicle of the Italian partisans or of rural life. One such story was La malora (1954), a long story in the style of Giovanni Verga. His major works were published in a critical edition after his death; controversy remains about his novel Il partigiano Johnny (translated as Johnny the Partisan), first published in 1968, by some considered his best work, which was edited posthumously on the basis of one or both the two incomplete versions left unpublished.

Biography Stark recorded his first 7\\" single with the band Paradize in 1979, then formed the band Overdrive in 1980. He released the 12\\" MLP Reflexions in 1981, after which the band was signed by Planet Records and released the albums Metal Attack (1983) and Swords And Axes (1984). The band split in 1985 and Stark formed Overheat together with former Overdrive-singer Pelle Thuresson on bass. The band only lasted a few years and made no official recording. In 1991 Stark participated in the national guitar competition Guitar Battle, where he went to the finals two years in a row, earning him tracks on the CD compilation Guitar Heroes Of Sweden. http://users.telenet.be/denofiniquitybe/intoverdrive.htm In 1995 Stark formed the band Locomotive Breath. The band released its debut album Train Of Events in 1997 and 1998. The follow-up Heavy Machinery was released in 2002 and the band's third album Change Of Track was released in October 2005. This album featured Marcel Jacob (Talisman, Yngwie Malmsteen) on bass.

It first opened its doors in 1995 on 120-A Hickory Street, but eventually moved to its current location at 5417 Trumpeter Way.Bjorn. Nabozney. Oral Interview, April 19th, 2018, by Haley Wynne and George Krumm at Big Sky Brewing Company in Missoula, Montana. Digital recording and transcription in possession of Kyle. G. Volk. The brewery features both seasonal and regular ales and has continued to function under the same owners for twenty-three years.  History  Big Sky Brewery began when Neal Leathers and Brad Robinson moved to Missoula, Montana from Michigan in 1990. This is where they met their future business partner Bjorn Nabozney, a native Montanan. Brad and Neal began work on starting a brewery. Bjorn created a business plan while studying at the University of Montana for a brewery that put Brad and Neal's idea into perspective. Big Sky Brewing Company was founded shortly after this in 1995.Bjorn. Nabozney. Oral Interview, April 19th, 2018, by Haley Wynne and George Krumm at Big Sky Brewing Company in Missoula, Montana. Digital recording and transcription in possession of Kyle. G. Volk. After raising capital, they purchased their original location at 120 Hickory Street Missoula, Montana, which spanned 7,000 square feet. Big Sky Brewing began brewing beer at their Hickory Street brewery in 1995. Big Sky Brewing's Hickory Street brewery was known as a \\"draft only\\" brewery, which means that they did not bottle beer at this establishment. With their eyes set on becoming a regional brewery, Big Sky Brewing planned on bottling beer, the Hickory Street location did not constitute enough room to add bottling production. After an arrangement, Big Sky Brewing began brewing beers at Portland Brewing Company for a few days each month. Portland Brewing also bottled and shipped Big Sky Brewing's beer to distributors. During this arrangement, Big Sky Brewing raised money and worked towards building a new brewery where they could bottle their own beer. Due to this plan they were forced outside of Missoula in 2002 to their current location at 5417 Trumpeter Way, which is over 24,000 square feet. At this new building they bottle and brew their own beer, and their current production rate is around 40,000-47,000 barrels. With their production moving at full speed, they now employ over forty-five full-time employees and sell beer in twenty-four different states. In 2017, Big Sky Brewing lobbied the Montana Legislature, helping pass Montana House Bill 541 allowing breweries to produce 60,000 barrels of beer. Big Sky Brewing also built an amphitheater, where they hold charity events and concerts, in an effort to give back to the Missoula community.

He won one U.S. championship and two World championships with Randy Stoklos. He began to compete as a professional in the two man beach volleyball tournaments of Southern California at age fifteen. He went to college at UCLA, where he played setter and outside hitter in head coach Al Scates' 6-2 system. The UCLA Bruins won the national championship in Smith's freshman year. The following year the Bruins did not make the final four, but as a junior the team again reached the finals before losing to Pepperdine. Smith was selected to the all tournament team. In his senior year in 1979 the Bruins again reached the finals, defeating cross town rival USC to win the national championship. Smith was again selected to the all-tournament team, and was voted the championship's most outstanding player. Smith was selected as an All American in both his junior and senior years. Smith won his first beach tournament with former UCLA teammate \\"Stormin\\" Mike Normand. His first Manhattan Beach Open was won in 1979 teaming with another UCLA alum, Jim Menges. In the early 1980s he made a successful beach team pairing with former UCLA teammate Karch Kiraly. They split up when Karch committed full time to the US National Men‚Äôs Volleyball Team. He moved on to partner with Randy Stoklos, and the two became the most dominant pair in men's beach volleyball. Smith was the first player to reach 100 career open tournament wins. He was a primary force behind the growth of beach volleyball as a sport, and the development of the Association of Volleyball Professionals, which formalized the sport as a professional athletic competition. The pair of Smith and Stoklos was featured in the video game Kings of the Beach released in 1988 for multiple computer platforms by Electronic Arts and in 1990 for the Nintendo Entertainment System by Konami. Acting Smith had a brief career as a television actor, appearing most notably on an episode of Magnum, P.I. as Magnum's volleyball partner who winds up dead under suspicious circumstances.

National Gallery of Art, Oxford University Press: Oxford, New York, 2003. p. 621 While working within the Sienese tradition, he innovated the style by introducing elements derived from the decorative Gothic style and the realism of contemporary Florentine innovators as Masaccio.Marco Torriti. \\"Sassetta.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 9 Mar. 2016 Life and Works The name Sassetta has been associated with him, mistakenly, only since the 18th century but is now generally used for this artist. The date and birthplace of Sassetta are not known. Some say he was born in Siena although there is also a hypothesis that he was born in Cortona. His father, Giovanni, is called da Cartona which possibly means that Cortona was the artist's birthplace. The meaning of his nickname Sassetta is obscure and is not cited in documents of his time but appears in sources from the eighteenth century. Sassetta was probably trained alongside artists like Benedetto di Bindo and Gregorio di Cecco but he had a style all of his own. He achieved a high level of technical refinement and was aware of artistic innovations of talented painters in Florence such as Gentile da Fabriano and Masolino. His work differs from the late Gothic style of many of his Sienese contemporaries.Mikl√≥s Boskovits; National Gallery of Art (U.S.); et al, Italian paintings of the fifteenth century (Washington: National Gallery of Art; New York, 2003), p. 623. His first certain work, which originally had his signature, is the Arte della Lana altarpiece, (1423‚Äì1426) fragments of which are now divided among various private and public collections. The Madonna of the Snow altarpiece for the Siena Cathedral was a prestigious commission for Sassetta, and is considered his second major work. Not only does he excel at infusing his figures with a natural light that convincingly molds their shape, he also has an amazing handle on spatial relationships, creating cohesive and impressive work. From this point on, under Gothic influence, Sassetta‚Äôs style increases its decorative nature. The polyptych done by Sassetta in San Domenico at Cortona (around 1437) depicts scenes from the legend of St. Anthony the Abbot. He shows great skill in narration through his painting as well as combining a sophisticated color palette and rhythmic compositions.Sassetta, Italian painter at Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2012. Francesco di Giorgio e di Lorenzo, better known as Vecchietta, is said to have been his apprentice. He died from pneumonia contracted while decorating the Assumption fresco on the Porta Romana of Siena. The work was finished by his pupil Sano di Pietro. Many consider Sassetta's fusing of traditional and contemporary elements as integral to the move from the Gothic to the Renaissance style of painting in Siena. A Miracle of the Eucharist Miracle of the Eucharist Sassetta was a fiercely pious man. The painting is about the \\"marriage of righteousness and violence\\" and the \\"consequences of sinfulness, the perils of feigning faith and the power of God.\\"Andrew Graham-Dixon, Paper Museum: Writings about Paintings, mostly (New York : Knopf, 1997), p. 34‚Äì35. The figure in black in the painting is an unbeliever, who has been found out in the process of receiving Communion. The officiating priest offers him the host on a plate, which is pictured miraculously spurting blood. The unbeliever has been struck dead instantly, and the creature above his face is a tiny black devil which has swooped down to snatch away his soul to the depths of Hell. The other men pictured are Carmelite monks, caught in expressions of shock, amazement and disgust. The painting is a \\"carefully staged, meticulously created illusion\\" which commemorates the Miracle of Bolsena which is said to have taken place in 1263. Sassetta's Altarpiece of the Eucharist was later divided between three museums (British, Hungarian and Italian), the Vatican, and a private collection. The Borgo San Sepolcro Altarpiece The altarpiece was originally painted in Siena, and transported to Sansepolcro for placement in the church of San Francesco. In October 1900 the Berenson family purchased three panels created by Stefano di Giovanni. The Berensons' collection consisted of St. Francis in Glory, flanked by the standing Blessed Ranieri and St. John the Baptist, which scholars determined are only a part of a complex altar which had now become scattered among twelve collections throughout Europe and North America. It is generally accepted by the art historical community that Sassetta‚Äôs San Francesco altarpiece was one of the largest and most expensive of the Quattrocento.Machtelt Israels, ed. Sassetta: The Borgo San Sepolcro Altarpiece. 2 vols. Florence: Villa I Tatti, 2009, p. 302. The fact that it was produced by a Sienese artist in Siena, and shipped to the Tiber valley town in late spring 1444 also speaks to Sassetta's fame in his time period. Bernard Berenson bequeathed many of Sassetta's painting from his Florence Villa to Harvard University, in what became the Center for Italian Renaissance Studies in Florence.Fabrizio Nevola. ‚ÄúReviews‚Äù Renaissance Quarterly (University of Chicago Press 2010). Vol. 63, No. 2, pp. 589‚Äì591. A 3D computer-assisted reconstruction of the altarpiece's surviving parts is featured in Sassetta: The Borgo San Sepolcro Altarpiece, edited by Machtelt Israels and released in 2009. Controversy There is some contention in the historical art community over which Sienese masters were directly responsible for which paintings. Scenes from the life of St. Anthony of Egypt have been questioned as Sassetta's own work, and critics such as Donald Bruce believe that near-equals, such as the Griselda master also deserve attention for their achievements in art of this time period.Donald Bruce, \\"Sienese Painting at the London National Gallery\\".

She was the first woman elected to the Senate from Nebraska, and she remains the shortest-serving senator from Nebraska. Early life Abel was born in Plattsmouth, Nebraska, the daughter of Charles Hempel and Ella Hempel. She attended the public schools of Omaha, Nebraska and graduated from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 1908. She worked as a high school mathematics teacher and principal in Papillion, Nebraska, Ashland, Nebraska, and Crete, Nebraska before working as secretary, treasurer, and eventually president of her husband's construction company. Political career Abel was a delegate to the Nebraska State Republican Conventions from 1939 to 1948 and from 1952 to 1956. In 1954 Abel was elected to be the vice chairman of the State Republican Central Committee. That same year she was elected to complete the unexpired term of Sen. Dwight Griswold, who had died in office. She became the first woman elected from Nebraska to serve in the Senate, as well as the first woman to follow another woman in a Senate seat,Membership Changes of the 83rd Congress as Eva Bowring had previously been appointed to the seat to serve until an election was held. She served in the Senate from November 8, 1954 until her resignation on December 31, 1954. She resigned three days before the expiration of her term, to give fellow Republican Carl Curtis of Nebraska, elected to the six‚Äìyear term in November, a seniority advantage. She later observed that she campaigned for the two‚Äìmonth term to raise the visibility of women in political office. ‚ÄúTo me it was more than just a short term in the Senate,‚Äù Abel recalled for Newsweek. ‚ÄúI wanted Nebraska voters to express their approval of a woman in government. I was sort of a guinea pig.‚Äù While in the Senate, she voted to censure Sen. Joseph McCarthy from Wisconsin, in the Army‚ÄìMcCarthy hearings. Incidentally, the fifteenth Senate term for Nebraska's Class 2 seat, which lasted from January 3, 1949 to January 3, 1955, was unusual in that it saw six senators serve. Abel was the fifth of these. She was a delegate to the White House Conference on Education in 1955, and chairwoman of the Nebraska delegation to the 1956 Republican National Convention. From 1955 to 1959 she was a member of the Theodore Roosevelt Centennial Commission, and in 1957 she was named \\"American Mother of the Year\\". She also served as the president and founder of the Nebraska Federation of Republican Women,Nebraska Federation of Republican Women and was on the board of trustees at Doane College and Nebraska Wesleyan College. She tried unsuccessfully to win the Republican nomination for Governor of Nebraska in 1960. Death and legacy She died in Lincoln, Nebraska on July 30, 1966 and is interred in Wyuka Cemetery in Lincoln. Hazel Abel Park in Lincoln is named in her honor. Family life Abel married George Abel in 1916, and they had five children, Helen, George, Hazel, Alice, and Annette.

He co-wrote the screenplays of Monsters, Inc., Monsters University and Big Hero 6, which was reported to be his last film as screenwriter. Gerson contributed material to Chicken Little, Curious George, Cars, Meet the Robinsons, Up, Inside Out and Zootopia, as well as television shows including Misguided Angeles, Big Wolf on Campus and Something So Right. Big Hero 6 won the Academy Award for best animated film and was also the highest-grossing animated film of 2014. He also won a BAFTA award. Early life Gerson grew up in New York on the Upper West Side and attended the Ethical Culture Fieldston School before studying at Cornell University, where he was a member of the Sigma Pi fraternity. He then studied for an MFA at NYU and wrote for NBC before joining Pixar in 1999. He married Beau Stacom, with whom he had two children. Career in film writing =Monsters, Inc.= Gerson described writing his first film, Monsters, Inc., as a highly collaborative process: \\"I would sit with Pete [Docter] and David Silverman [the directors], and we would talk about a scene and they would tell me what they were looking for. I would make some suggestions and then go off and write the sequence. We'd get together again and review it and then hand it off to a story artist. Here's where the collaborative process really kicked in. The board artist was not beholden to my work and could take liberties here and there. Sometimes, I would suggest an idea about making the joke work better visually. Once the scene moved on to animation, the animators would plus the material even further.\\" Andrew Stanton credited him as having rewritten and improved Monsters, Inc. after he was unable to continue with the project: \\"I‚Äôve never written anything that I felt was [not improvable], and Dan Gerson was the guy who came in after I left and kept running with it.\\" =Monsters University= Gerson's collaborator Robert L. Baird noted that development of Monsters University took seven years from the basic idea of a prequel. Gerson described writing Monsters University as a challenge due to the difficulty of writing an engaging prequel when audiences know what the ending will be: > We wanted to try and do a movie in which Mike is our main character and > we've had a lot of challenges with this being a prequel. We have never > written a prequel, and in fact when we looked at the prequels that are out > there, there weren‚Äôt that many, and the ones that exist aren't great....how > do we get people to come along on this journey even though they know where > we're ending up? Can we get people to invest in his wants and desires > and...almost cause the audience to forget a little bit about where we're > ending up ‚Ä¶ If we‚Äôve done our job, the audience will get so invested it‚Äôs > still going to be something of a surprise. Gerson also in interview described the format of a college comedy challenging to integrate with an animated film for children: \\"There's a general sense of the fun of being a college student, without any of the things that might be in a more adult-oriented college film.\\" At an interview with Baird at the premiere, Gerson again stressed the importance of collaboration and development: > We write a version of the script...and then we blow it to bits, we get in > there with the Pixar brain trust, and they just smash it apart, and then you > rebuild it and you do that like six, seven times. That's why we were on the > movie for three and a half years. People can't understand how it could take > that long to write. It's just that you're doing different iterations of the > movie and it's getting better every time...we both worked on the first one > and having those voices in our head, knowing that we want to stay true to > those voices even though we're going ten years in the past...so that when > you watch Monsters, Inc, there's consistency...The main thing is just to > write, and we meet a lot of young writers who say, \\"I want to get into the > business, how do I get into the business?\\" And a lot of them have trouble > completing their first screenplay...you only get better by writing and > rewriting and rewriting. Roy Conli, who produced Big Hero 6, described his and Baird's approach to writing the film as being \\"to find that line that was emotional and not damaging.\\" Outside scriptwriting, Gerson advised Pixar president Edwin Catmull on structuring his 2014 autobiography. =Cameos= Gerson also took small voice parts in some of his films, including Monsters, Inc. and Big Hero 6, often as minor characters such as a janitor or desk sergeant. His contribution to Monsters, Inc., the janitors Smitty and Needleman, began as guide vocals which director Pete Docter liked so much he kept in the final mix. His name also made a cameo appearance on a scoreboard in Monsters, Inc. as the most unsuccessful monster on the list and as the Desk Sargent in Big Hero 6. Death Gerson died in Los Angeles at the age of 49 on February 6, 2016, due to brain cancer. He was working on Cars 3 at the time of his death. The film was completed by several screenwriters and was dedicated to his memory.

Landmarks Hohentwiel The most famous landmark of Singen is Hohentwiel, a volcanic stub on which there are the ruins of a fortress destroyed by French troops during the Napoleonic Wars. World War 2 'Singen route' Singen is notable in military history for the Singen route in World War II. This route into Switzerland was discovered by Dutch naval lieutenant Hans Larive in 1940 on his first escape attempt from an Oflag (prisoner's camp for officers) in Soest. After being captured at the Swiss border near Singen, the interrogating Gestapo officer was so confident the war would soon be won by Germany that he told Larive the safe way across the border. Larive did not forget and many prisoners later escaped using this route - that included Larive himself, Francis Steinmetz, Anthony Luteyn, Airey Neave, Pat Reid and Howard Wardle in their escapes from Colditz Castle when Colditz was used in the war as Oflag IV-C.Larive; the man who came in from Colditz, Leo de hartog; officieren achter prikkeldraad 1940-1945 Transportation Singen is an important regional train hub with three railway lines and the terminal of the Stuttgart-Hattingen railway with connections to Stuttgart and the Swiss Schaffhausen.

Together with other Bohemian preachers and writers of that time, he paved in a certain sense the way for the reforming activity of Jan Hus.  Life  Jan Mil√≠ƒç of Kromƒõ≈ô√≠≈æ: A Brothel Converted to a Convent. (1916) A canvas from Alfons Mucha's monumental cycle The Slav Epic depicts a situation when former prostitutes from Prague quarter \\"Venice\\" are moved by Mil√≠ƒç's sermons to begin new life as nuns while on the place of former brothel is being built a cloister called \\"New Jerusalem\\" Not much is known of Mil√≠ƒç's early life. He was born in Kromƒõ≈ô√≠≈æ, Moravia (part of the Bohemian Crown). The date of his birth is not known. He was in holy orders in 1350. From 1358 to 1360 he served as registrar and from 1360 to 1362 as corrector at the Imperial Chancery of Charles IV, whom he accompanied into Germany several times. In October 1362 received a canonry in the cathedral of Prague along with the dignity of archdeacon. In December 1363 he resigned all his appointments that he might become a preacher pure and simple; he addressed scholars in Latin, and (an innovation) the laity in their native Czech, or in German, which he learnt for the purpose. He was conspicuous for his apostolic poverty and soon roused the enmity of the mendicant friars. The success of his labors made itself apparent in the way in which he transformed the ill-famed Ben√°tky (\\"Venice\\") street in Prague Old Town quarter into a benevolent institution, Nov√Ω Jeruzal√©m (\\"New Jerusalem\\"). As he viewed the evils inside and outside the church in the light of Scripture, the conviction grew in his mind that the \\"abomination of desolation\\" was now seen in the temple of God, and that antichrist had come, and in 1367 he went to Rome (where Pope Urban V was expected from Avignon) to expound these views. He affixed to the gate of St. Peter's a placard announcing his sermon, but before he could deliver it was thrown into prison by the Inquisition. Urban, however, on his arrival, ordered his release, whereupon he returned to Prague, and from 1369 to 1372 preached daily in the T√Ωn Church there. In the latter year the clergy of the local archdiocese complained of him in 12 articles to the papal court at Avignon, whither he was summoned in Lent 1374, and where he died in the same year, not long after being declared innocent and authorized to preach before the assembly of cardinals.

Hama (his father). :For another Amora sage of Babylon with a similar name, known as \\"Rabbah\\", see: Rabbah bar Nahmani. Abba ben Joseph bar ·∏§ama (c. 280 ‚Äì 352 CE), who is exclusively referred to in the Talmud by the name Rava (), was a Babylonian rabbi who belonged to the fourth generation of amoraim. He is known for his debates with Abaye, and is one of the most often cited rabbis in the Talmud. Biography He was born about 280 CE in Mahoza (a suburb of Ctesiphon, the capital of Babylonia), where his father was a wealthy and distinguished scholar. In his youth Rava went to Sura, where he attended the lectures of Rav Chisda and associated with Rami bar Hama. About ten years after Rami's death Rava married his widow, the daughter of Rav Chisda.Yevamot 34b It is said that earlier Rav Chisda's daughter sat in her father's classroom, while his students, Rava and Rami bar Hama, stand before them. When Rav Chisda asked her which of the two she wants to marry, she replied \\"both of them,\\" and Rava added, \\"I'll be the last one\\" (commentators let us know that she indeed married Rami first and Rava second).Bava Batra 12b They had five sons, the eldest of whom, Joseph, died during his parents' lifetime. Rava studied at the Talmudical Academy at Pumbedita, site of modern-day Falluja, Iraq. Rava's teachers were Rav Yosef, Rabbah, and, chiefly, Rav Nachman (who lived in Mahoza). His chief study-companion was Abaye, who was about the same age, and both of them developed the dialectic method which Rav Judah and their teacher Rabbah had established in their discussions of tradition; their debates became known as the \\"Havayot de-Abaye ve-Rava\\".Sukkah 28a Rava enjoyed the special protection of the mother of Shapur II, the reigning King of Persia.Ta'anit 24b For this reason, and in consideration of large sums which he secretly contributed to the court,Hagigah 5b he succeeded in making less severe Shapur's oppressions of the Jews in Babylonia. When, after the death of Rav Yosef, Abaye was chosen head of the Academy of Pumbedita (Horayot 14a), Rava founded a school of his own in Mahoza. Many pupils, preferring his lectures Abaye's, followed him to there.Bava Batra 22a After Abaye's death Rava was elected head of the school, and the academy was transferred from Pumbedita to Mahoza, which, during the lifetime of Rava, was the only seat of Jewish learning in Babylonia. When Rabbah bar Nahmani, the head of the yeshiva of Pumbedita, retired, the position went to Abaye. At that point, Rava returned to Mahoza, where he established a yeshiva there. After the death of Abaye, many of his students moved from Pumbedita to Mahoza, to join Rava's Yeshiva, which had become one of the intellectual centers of the Babylonian Jewish Community. According to Sherira Gaon, Rava died in 352 CE. Some texts of the Talmud say that he died at age 40, being one of the descendants of Eli who were cursed with early death;Avodah Zarah 19b; Rosh Hashana 18a (according to the wording preserved by Rashi) but in all likelihood the correct version of the text refers to Rabbah not Rava.Rashi (on Rosh Hashana 18a) and Tosafot (on Yevamot 105a) write that Rava was not a kohen, and thus not descended from Eli. Other arguments suggest that Rava was not a kohen. When he said that he would marry the daughter of Rami bar Hama after Rami did (Bava Batra 12b), he presumably did not mean to curse Rami to die, in which case he had in mind to marry her as a divorcee, which would be forbidden to a kohen. In addition, he instructed his sons not to marry converts (Brachot 8b), an instruction which would be superfluous for a kohen, as all kohanim are forbidden to marry converts. In addition, he once visited Rav Huna's deathbed (Moed Kattan 28a), which a kohen would not do to avoid being under one roof with a corpse. Teachings =Halacha= The debates between Rava and Abaye are considered classic examples of Talmudic dialectical logic. Of their hundreds of recorded disputes, the law is decided according to the opinion of Rava in all but six cases. His methodology greatly influenced not only his students, but the stammaim, as well. Rava was regarded as a greater authority than Abaye, and in cases where there was a difference of opinion between them Rava was generally followed; there are only six instances in which Abaye's decision was preferred.Kiddushin 52a Rava \\"would join the practical awareness of daily existence\\" to his teachings, while Abaye's teachings relied only on \\"the consistent and systematic logic of halakhic interpretation\\"; thus halakha was decided like Rava in nearly all cases. Michael Avi Yonah, Atlas Karta leTekufat Bayit Sheni, haMishna, vehaTalmud, p.100 Rava occupied a prominent position among the transmitters of halakhah, and established many new decisions and rulings, especially in ceremonial law.e.g., Hullin 42b, 43b, 46b, 47a,b; Pesachim 30a He strove to spread the knowledge of halakhah by discoursing upon it in lectures, to which the public were admitted, and many of his halakhic decisions expressly state that they were taken from such discourses.Eruvin 104a; Shabbat 143a; Pesachim 42a; Bava Batra 127a He was a master of halakhic exegesis, not infrequently resorting to it to demonstrate the Biblical authority underlying legal regulations. He adopted certain hermeneutic principles which were partly modifications of older rules and partly his own.Compare Bacher, \\"Ag. Bab. Amor.\\" pp. 131-132 Rava apparently had to reply to a deep-seated skepticism toward rabbinic authority and to defend the authenticity of the rabbinic oral tradition. The skepticism of Mahozan Jewry was fueled in part by the acceptance of the Manichaean polemic against Zoroastrianism and its insistence on oral transmission, and by a strong concern with the problem of theodicy, encouraged by a familiarity with Zoroastrian theology. Rava‚Äôs creativity was fueled by his cosmopolitan urban environment. For instance, he ruled that one who habitually ate certain non- kosher foods because he liked the taste was nevertheless trustworthy as a witness in cases involving civil matters. So too did he suggest that a lost object belongs to the person who discovers it even before the loser is aware of his loss, because it prevented the loser from resorting to urban courts to try to get his property back and eliminated the period of uncertainty of possession. It also led to the legal concept that 'future [psychological] abandonment [of possession] when unaware [of the loss] is [nevertheless retrospectively accounted] as abandonment'. Ultimately, Rava‚Äôs views were decisive in shaping the Bavli‚Äôs approach to the problem of theodicy, legal midrash, and conceptualization, all of which stand in stark contrast to the Yerushalmi.\\"Yaakov Elman, \\"The Babylonian Talmud in Its Historical Context,\\" in Printing the Talmud: From Bomberg To Schottenstein, ed. Sharon Liberman Mintz & Gabriel M. Goldstein (New York City: Yeshiva University Museum, 2006), 26-27. =Aggadah= Rava was as preeminent in aggadah as in halakhah. In addition to the lectures to his pupils, he used to hold public discourses, most of them aggadic in character, and many of his aggadic interpretations are expressly said to have been delivered in public.e.g., Sanhedrin 107a, 108b, 109a; Hagigah 3a, 15b; Eruvin 21b; et al. Even more numerous are the interpretations which, although not expressly stated to have been delivered in public, seem to have been presented before a general audience, since they do not differ from the others in form. The majority of these expositions, which frequently contain popular maxims and proverbs,compare Bacher, l.c. pp. 124 et seq. refer to the first books of the Ketuvim ‚Äî Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Song of Songs, and Ecclesiastes. Bacher justly infers from this that the aggadic lectures of Rava were delivered in connection with the Sabbath afternoon service - at which, according to a custom observed in Nehardea, and later probably in Mahoza also, parashiyyot were read from the Ketuvim.Shabbat 116b; Rapoport, \\"Erekh Millin,\\" pp. 170 et seq. Rava therefore appended his aggadic discourse to the Biblical section which had been read. Torah study is a frequent topic of Rava's aggadah. In the judgment after death, each man will be obliged to state whether he devoted certain times to study, and whether he diligently pursued the knowledge of the Law, striving to deduce the meaning of one passage from another.Shabbat 31a The Torah, in his view, is a medicine, life-giving to those who devote themselves to it with right intent, but a deadly poison for those who do not properly avail themselves of it.Yoma 72b \\"A true disciple of wisdom must be upright; and his interior must harmonize with his exterior\\". Rava frequently emphasizes the respect due to teachers of the Law,e.g., Sanhedrin 99b; Shabbat 23b the proper methods of study,Avodah Zarah 19a and the rules applicable to the instruction of the young.Bava Batra 21a In addition, Rava's aggadah frequently discusses the characters of Biblical history.Sanhedrin 108b; Bava Batra 123a; Sotah 34b; etc. =Mysticism= Rava was secretly initiated, probably by his teacher Rav Yosef, into aggadic esoterism;Bacher, l.c. p. 130 a number of his teachings are tinged with mysticism.See especially Sanhedrin 65b It is said that he once created a golem and sent it to Rav Zeira.Sanhedrin 65b Once he wished to lecture in the academy upon the Tetragrammaton, but an old man prevented him, reminding him that such knowledge must be kept secret.Pesachim 50a = Quotes = *The reward for [learning] tradition is its logic [not the practical conclusions].Berakhot 6b *Either companionship or death. (popular saying)Ta'anit 23a *When as yet I had not been made, I was not worthy. But now that I have been made, it is as though I had not been made.

Born in Sacramento, California, to a first generation Portuguese-Azorean immigrant family, he gained his popularity as part of the pop art movement of the 1960s. Ramos is \\"best known for his paintings of superheroes and voluptuous female nudes emerging from cornstalks or Chiquita bananas, popping up from candy wrappers or lounging in martini glasses\\". He was also a university art professor. Biography Ramos attended Sacramento Junior College and San Jose State College. One of his earliest art teachers was Wayne Thiebaud, who is considered his mentor, and who remained his friend. Ramos received his B.A. and his M.A. from Sacramento State College, finishing his education in 1958. From 1958‚Äì1966, Ramos taught art at Elk Grove High School and Mira Loma High School in Sacramento. After two brief college teaching assignments, he began a long career (1966‚Äì1997) at California State University, East Bay, in Hayward, California, and then served as Professor Emeritus. He was Artist in Residence at Syracuse University and the University of Wisconsin. Marriage Ramos married Leta (Helmers) Ramos in 1955, who was the model for many of his early nude paintings. Art career alt= Ramos received his first important recognition in the early 1960s; since 1959 he has participated in more than 120 group shows. Along with Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol, he was one of the first artists to do paintings of images from comic books, and works of the three were exhibited together at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1963. Along with Claes Oldenburg, James Rosenquist, Tom Wesselmann and Wayne Thiebaud, Ramos produced art works that celebrated aspects of popular culture as represented in mass media. His paintings have been shown in major exhibitions of pop art in the U.S. and in Europe, and reproduced in books, catalogs, and periodicals throughout the world. In 2009, Ramos was part of the first Portuguese American bilingual art book and exhibit in California \\"Ashes to Life a Portuguese American Story in Art\\" with fellow artists Nathan Oliveira, John Mattos and Jo√£o de Brito. Ramos was represented by the Louis K. Meisel Gallery since 1971. He has also been represented for many years by San Francisco's Modernism gallery and Galerie Ernst Hilger, Austria. A major exhibition of his work was held at the Albertina in Vienna in 2011. A retrospective of over 50 years of his work opened at the Crocker Art Museum in his hometown of Sacramento on June 2, 2012. This show is \\"the first major exhibition of his work in his hometown\\", and his first American retrospective in 35 years.

Its release followed a self- acknowledged career low point, Machine + Soul (1992), and is often cited as marking the start of a critical and artistic rejuvenation for the one-time pop star. The album was released in the US in 1997 with a different cover by Joseph Michael Linsner, and a new title, Dawn, based on the comic book character of the same name, but the track listing was identical. On Sacrifice, paraphernalia which Numan had previously, by his own admission, relied upon in a bid to make his music more 'radio-friendly', such as saxophone solos, dance rhythms and female backing vocals, were dropped in favour of a back-to-basics approach that saw him playing practically all instruments himself. The result was a dirty industrial sound with darkwave undertones; a departure from preceding albums that was seen by many critics and fans as a return to the best features of his classic early work: brooding synthesizers, distorted guitars and a highly personal lyrical perspective. The album actually started off as a project entitled \\"Vicious\\". Various tracks were worked on with, amongst others, previous Machine + Soul producer Kipper but Numan wasn't quite happy with the direction, and it was whilst he was considering signing to another label that they suggested he record vocals to a recently released soundtrack for The Radial Pair. Numan did not sign on to the label but instead adopted these tracks along with others which eventually became \\"Sacrifice\\" after hearing Depeche Mode album Songs of Faith and Devotion and decided this was the musical direction he wanted to take. \\"Play Like God\\" and the demo \\"Metal Beat\\" were dropped from the album, appearing on later re-releases in 1998 and 1999. A number of tracks displayed an antipathy towards religion, a stance that had been noted in isolated songs from early in Numan‚Äôs career but which became more pronounced on this album and its successors, Exile (1997) and Pure (2000).Atheist Foundation of Australia Inc: \\"Atheism and Music\\" The single released from the album, \\"A Question of Faith\\", appeared to cast the singer as a fallen angel (\\"I dare you to judge me / Now God has disowned me\\"), a theme that would dominate Exile, before concluding: \\"They kneel down / Praise God / Shout Hallelujah ... When children kill children / Don‚Äôt it make them wonder? / Don‚Äôt it make them question their faith?\\"; the reference \\"...when children kill children...\\" was made about the then-recent murder of James Bulger. Numan later stated that whilst Exile was a fictional story, \\"Sacrifice looks at my actual beliefs\\". Amongst the other tracks on the album, \\"Magic\\" was inspired partly by Tolkien‚Äôs The Lord of the Rings; \\"Bleed\\" and \\"Deadliner\\" reflected a fear of sleep and of nightmares becoming real, the latter song taking its inspiration from a dream that Numan once had and featuring semi-spoken verses; \\"You Walk in My Soul\\" was an ode to his future wife Gemma O‚ÄôNeill; \\"Love and Napalm\\" was a guitar-driven number whose distinctive riff recalled the early days of Tubeway Army. In a 2000 interview, Numan described his approach to the recording. Prior to Sacrifice, \\"I spent quite a few years just trying to write songs that would get me back on the radio\\". For the new album, \\"I just went right back to the way I was when I was a teenager, first time writing songs, with all the enthusiasm for it\\".Crud Magazine interview The resultant music, whilst not a commercial success, garnered Numan his best notices in years and coincided with the beginnings of a critical reassessment of his career and acknowledgment of his influence on such artists as Nine Inch Nails, Foo Fighters, Marilyn Manson, The Magnetic Fields, The Prodigy and Afrika Bambaataa. An 'Extended' version of Sacrifice, approximately twice as long again as the original, was released in 1995. The same year, most of the tracks appeared on Dark Light, Numan‚Äôs live recording from the Sacrifice tour. In 1999 the album was reissued with bonus tracks in the UK (Eagle Records) and US (Cleopatra Records). As with other reissues of albums originally released on Numa Records, the US version had a somewhat different selection of bonus tracks as well as altered artwork.

Barsine became the wife of her uncle Mentor, and after his death married her second uncle, Memnon. In 334 BC, the year of Alexander's invasion of Asia, she and her children were sent by Memnon to the king Darius III as hostages for his fidelity; and in the ensuing year, when Damascus was betrayed to the Macedonians, she fell into the hands of Alexander, by whom it is argued that she became the mother of Heracles. On Alexander's death in 323 a claim to the throne on this boy's behalf was unsuccessfully urged by Nearchus.

They are distributed in the districts of Pithoragarh, Champawat and Udham Singh Nagar and in a small area confined to Western Nepal. They are the smallest Himalayan tribal group related to a larger ethno-linguistic group of Raji people. They are basically nomadic hunter-gatherers, but also work as agriculture and forest labourers. They are mainly dependent on forests, and also practice shifting cultivation. Their existence is threatened by developmental and wild life related projects. They were placed in forced settlements by the Government of India beginning in the 1980s.Many continue to move in semi- nomadic camps, but most are now settled into villages along the Mahakali River area straddling India. Language Van Rawats speak a Tibeto-Burman language generally called \\"Rawat\\". Deities Van Rawats worship supernatural beings that live in the forests and sky. The Sun, known as Diho, represents their major deity. They also worship a forest deity known as Kaiyu/Qaiyu. She is prayed to before hunting. The deity Masan is prayed to before fishing. Masan is seen as potentially malevolent while Kaiyu is benevolent. When supernaturals live in natural objects, they may be named as well. The Doliya/Dolia, for example, live in some stones. A third major set of deities are the ancestral deities, known as Sey-da/Seda, a term that possibly derives from the Proto-Tibeto-Burman word for a dead person, *s«ùy 'die'. They make one shake and go into an altered state of consciousness. One of the major ancestral deities is known as Samoji. There are many other ancestral deities based upon a particular clan ancestor. Practising a form of religious syncretism, Ban Rawats also borrow Hindu deities and will alternatively call paternal ancestral deities by the local Hindu terms, Isht, Pichash, and the common local Hindu deity known as Bhaiyar, especially when speaking in front of outsiders. A fourth set of major supernaturals are the supernatural forces (Hawa/Ha'wa) that live as animate forces, often of the weather. Latiya Bar/Ban (word-final sound is retroflex palatal nasal stop), for example, will cause people to become dumb (from the Kumaoni word for dumbness plus the indigenous term). Other gods of note include Daru/Dharu which comes along the wind; Bujergalog, a deity mentioned by an octogenarian living in one of the settlements near Askot, Pithoragarh.

Papa, became head of the academy at Naresh, Huna bar Joshua joined him as rosh kallah (head of the general assembly) (Ber. 57a).\\" Papa's father seems to have been wealthy and to have enabled his son to devote himself to study.Yevamot 106a; Rashi ad loc. Papa inherited some property from his father; and he also amassed great wealth by brewing beer, an occupation in which he was an expert.Pesachim 113a; Bava Metziah 65a He likewise engaged in extensive and successful business undertakings,Pesachim 111b and his teacher Rava once said of him: \\"Happy is the righteous man who is as prosperous on earth as only the wicked usually are!\\".Horayot 10b However, Rava also accused Papa and his friend Huna of being exploitative in business: \\"You would take the coats from people's backs\\".Gittin 73a; Ketuvot 85a Papa sold his beer at a higher price than ordinary because he gave the buyer credit, although this practice was regarded as a kind of usury.Bava Metziah 65a In addition, other scholars were known to criticize him for his reluctance to aid the poor.Bava Batra 9a, 10a He was, however, known for his honesty in business: he once returned a field he had purchased upon learning that the seller regretted the sale.Ketuvot 97a He is known to have married two wives. One was the daughter of a kohen, and he attributed his wealth to this marriage.Hullin 132a; Pesachim 49a The second was the daughter of Abba Sura'ah (=of Sura). They do not seem to have lived happily together,Compare Sanhedrin 14b for she prided herself on the nobility of her ancestry as contrasted with his own. He therefore said, referring to his own experience: \\"Be circumspect and not hasty in marrying, and take a wife from a class of society lower than your own\\".Yevamot 63a Several of his children married prominent figures in Jewish Babylonian society.Ketuvot 52b, 85b; Sanhedrin 14b; Brachot 45b; Horayot 12a He was obese, and once noted that he could break a bench simply by sitting on it.Bava Kamma 10b It is reported that once a non-Jew owed him money, and tried to avoid payment by inventing a blood libel that Papa had killed the non-Jew's son, placing a dead baby under a blanket and encouraging Papa to sit on the blanket. According to one version of the story, Papa figured out the plot and refused to sit on the blanket;Brachot 8b (but Dikdukei Sofrim sees this as a late addition) according to other versions he did sit on the blanket, and then was either forced to flee the country,Rabbeinu Hananel, Rashi, Rashbam to Pesachim 112b or to pay a steep fine.Raavan, commentary Brachot, 134 Teachings Papa did not have reputation for scholarship among his peers. He lacked independence of judgment; in the case of two conflicting opinions he tried to accept both.Berachot 11b, 59b; Megillah 21b; Hullin 17b, 46a, 76b; Shabbat 20a He was, consequently, not greatly respected as a scholar; and R. Idi b. Abin Naggara termed him and Huna ben Joshua \\"dardeki\\" (children).Pesachim 35a; Yevamot 85a R. Huna b. Manoah, Samuel b. Judah, and R. ·∏§iyya of Vestania, pupils of Rava, came, after their teacher's death, to attend Papa's lectures, which they found obscure and vague. They communicated their opinions to one another by signs, to the great chagrin of Papa, who noticed them, and said: \\"Let the scholars [\\"rabbanan\\"] go in peace\\".Ta'anit 9a,b R. Simai b. Ashi (father of Rav Ashi), who also attended Papa's lectures, often embarrassed him by questions; so that Papa once fell on his knees and prayed that God might protect him from being humiliated by Simai. Simai, who witnessed this scene in silence, thereupon resolved to desist; and he asked no further questions at any time. Papa was extremely anxious to obtain a reputation as scholar, but he also endeavored to do honor to all other scholars. He never excommunicated one,Moed Kattan 17a and whenever, during his business journeys, he came to a place in which a scholar lived he visited him.Niddah 33b Once when an unseemly reference to scholars escaped him, he fasted in atonement,Sanhedrin 100a although he disliked fasting and it did not agree with him.Ta'anit 24b; Rosh Hashana 18b Papa made journeys in connection with his business,Berachot 42; Megillah 21; Niddah 33b and thus gained much knowledge of the world. He was especially interested in the collection of popular proverbs which he considered as authoritative, using them even to refute the words of a sage.Berachot 59a The sayings quoted by him include the following: * If no grain is in the house, quarrels knock at the door and enter.Bava Metziah 59a * Sow corn for thy use that thou mayest not be obliged to purchase it; and strive to acquire a piece of property\\".Yevamot 63a *The weasel and the cat made a marriage of convenience on the occasion of the fat of misfortune!Sanhedrin 105aExplained by Rabbi Menachem Posner: \\"The weasel and the cat are natural rivals. Yet, when there is fat from which they can both benefit, they set aside their animus to enjoy the bounty. Similarly, a common foe often leads human enemies to set aside their differences and work together peacefully.\\" *Judgment delayedLiterally, \\"Judgment which has spent the night, etc.\\" i.e., sometimes when judgment is delayed, it loses its effectiveness. is judgment lost.Sanhedrin 95a Papa's sons and the siyum At many modern siyums, a short prayer is said which mentions ten sons of Papa. According to one explanation, whenever he completed a tractate in the Talmud he held a large party at which he invited his ten sons and many other people. Other homiletic understandings exist, connecting the ten names to the Ten Commandments.Yam shel Shlomo, Bava Kama chapter 4, end of chapter 7 This passage is first mentioned by Hai Gaon, who however said that not all the names were sons of the well-known Papa, but that tradition held reciting the names was a segulah against forgetting.Quoted in Sefer haEshkol, Raavad II, Hilchot Sefer Torah 14 Some of the names refer to people who lived in earlier generations; for example, Rafram bar Papa was a contemporary of Rav Chisda,Shabbat 82a Rachish bar Papa was apparently a student of Rav, Aha, Aba, and Ada or Hiyya bar Papa are mentioned in the Talmud with the title \\"Rabbi\\" which was applied to scholars from the Land of Israel but not from Babylonia,Bava Kamma 80b and Surhav bar Papa was apparently a student of Ze'iri.Ketuvot 17b  References  It has the following bibliography: * Abraham Mordecai Piyorka, Toledot R.

It was one of two United Church of Canada buildings in the area and along St. Clair Avenue, the other being Timothy Eaton Memorial Church (originally Methodist).  Early history  The congregation began in 1881 as the Deer Park Presbyterian Mission.Deer Park United Church ‚Äì Shared Ministry Their first church building was constructed on the northwest corner of Yonge Street and St. Clair Avenue, now home to an office tower containing several radio stations, including CFRB, 99.9 Mix FM and 97.3 EZ Rock. In 1913, a new church building was erected for the congregation at 129 St. Clair Avenue West. The first missionary was the Rev. George Edwin Freeman. His granddaughter, Lois Wilson, served as a United Church Moderator (from 1980 to 1982) and as a Canadian Senator (from 1998 to 2002). In 1925, a majority of the congregation voted to join the newly formed United Church of Canada. The 370 members who voted to remain Presbyterian withdrew and formed what is now Calvin Presbyterian Church.  Recent history  In 2006, the Deer Park United congregation celebrated its 125th anniversary. The next year, the congregation was told that the owners of the Imperial Oil Building next door would no longer supply building heat after July 2008.\\"Abandoned Toronto churches being reborn as condominiums\\" The Globe and Mail. Due to the financial inability to maintain the large and aging building, the congregation de-sanctified the building at 129 St. Clair Avenue West in June 2008.

The film is directed by Mikael H√•fstr√∂m and stars Clive Owen, Jennifer Aniston, Vincent Cassel, Giancarlo Esposito, David Morrissey, RZA and Xzibit. This was also the first film to be released by The Weinstein Company in the United States. The film is set in Chicago.  Plot  Advertising executive Charles Schine's (Clive Owen) marriage to his wife Deanna is deteriorating, and his daughter Amy suffers from diabetes, requiring expensive medication. Charles' story is being written down by a man in a prison cell. On a commuter train, Charles strikes up a conversation with Lucinda Harris (Jennifer Aniston), an alluring woman who is a married financial adviser. The two show each other photographs of their respective daughters. A mutual attraction develops, and the two begin meeting frequently. Ultimately, they decide to consummate their affair and wind up in a seedy hotel. An armed man‚Äîlater identified as Philippe LaRoche‚Äîbursts into the hotel room, beats Charles, and brutally rapes Lucinda. Charles and Lucinda, not wanting their spouses to learn of the affair, agree not to report the crime. Shortly after, LaRoche contacts Charles, threatens to kill his family, and blackmails him into paying him $20,000. A month later, LaRoche calls again, this time demanding $100,000. Charles explains his situation to his friend Winston, an ex-con who works as a repairman in his building. Winston agrees to scare off LaRoche for ten percent of the payout. Charles embezzles $10,000 from his company and he and Winston plot to get the drop on LaRoche at his specified meeting location. However, LaRoche surprises them, shoots Winston dead, and takes Winston's payout. Charles disposes of Winston's body and gives a false alibi when he is questioned about the murder by police detective Franklin Church, who also happens to be Winston's close relative. Later, Charles receives a call from LaRoche; he is holding Lucinda hostage and will kill her if he does not deliver the $100,000. Charles takes the money from an account meant for his daughter's medical treatment and makes the payoff to LaRoche and his partner Dexter, who works at the motel. Detective Church questions Charles again after uncovering his friendship with Winston, putting mounting pressure on Charles to come clean about the blackmail. First, he goes to Lucinda's company to warn her and is introduced to the real Lucinda Harris. The woman he met on the train is Jane, a temp who had worked there briefly. He goes to Jane's apartment; it is actually in the process of being rented out. Seeing that Jane's photograph of her daughter was actually a cut out of a stock picture in a brochure, he realizes Jane was in on the scam. Charles tracks Jane down and sees her kissing LaRoche, and later observes her seducing Sam Griffin, another unsuspecting businessman. He rents a room in the same seedy hotel as before and waits for Jane to ensnare her target and bring Sam to a hotel room. Determined to retrieve his stolen money, Charles knocks LaRoche unconscious outside the hotel room door, disarms him, and reveals to Sam the scheme Jane was about to set him up for. Dexter arrives to back up LaRoche and a gunfight ensues; nearly everyone is fatally shot but Charles (and LaRoche), who watches Jane die, returns to his room and convinces the police he is merely a bystander. Before leaving the hotel, Charles claims his briefcase and gets back the money for his daughter's treatments. Later, Charles' boss Eliot confronts him about the $10,000 he embezzled when he paid Winston. He is arrested for stealing from the company and sentenced to six months of community service, teaching in a prison. During one of his classes, he comes across the story about him written on one of the students papers. The writer instructs him to go to the laundry room. There, Charles finds LaRoche, who survived the gunfight. LaRoche threatens to continue to disrupt Charles' life, but Charles reveals that he has planned the encounter. He stabs LaRoche to death with a shank which Winston had given him. Charles walks away from the encounter by claiming to Detective Church that LaRoche attacked him and he reacted in self-defense. Church is all but certain LaRoche's death was premeditated murder. However, he has pieced together LaRoche's crimes and is not inclined to seek justice for Winston's killer; instead, he allows Charles to return to his family.

History Timothy Eaton Memorial Church, as pictured in the pages of the opening services programme, December 1914 The Methodist Social Union of Toronto approached members of the Eaton family for their support in the creation of a church in the area. As a memorial to her husband, Timothy Eaton, Margaret Wilson Eaton and her son, John Craig Eaton, donated the land for the church and financed the construction of the original structures. The Sunday School building was completed in 1911 and used for worship services until the sanctuary opened. Design of the church was given to the architectural firm Wickson & Gregg. Construction was completed in 1915. One of the church‚Äôs best-known features is a 1915 stained glass reproduction of The Light of the World by English Pre-Raphaelite painter Holman Hunt, it was dedicated in memory of Timothy Eaton.

Example of salt bridge between amino acids glutamic acid and lysine demonstrating electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding In chemistry, a salt bridge is a combination of two non-covalent interactions: hydrogen bonding and ionic bonding (Figure 1). Ion pairing is one of the most important noncovalent forces in chemistry, in biological systems, in different materials and in many applications such as ion pair chromatography. It is a most commonly observed contribution to the stability to the entropically unfavorable folded conformation of proteins. Although noncovalent interactions are known to be relatively weak interactions, small stabilizing interactions can add up to make an important contribution to the overall stability of a conformer. Not only are salt bridges found in proteins, but they can also be found in supramolecular chemistry. The thermodynamics of each are explored through experimental procedures to access the free energy contribution of the salt bridge to the overall free energy of the state. Salt bridges in chemical bonding In water, formation of salt bridges or ion pairs is mostly driven by entropy, usually accompanied by unfavorable ŒîH contributions on account of desolvation of the interacting ions upon association. Hydrogen bonds contribute to the stability of ion pairs with e.g. protonated ammonium ions, and with anions is formed by deprotonation as in the case of carboxylate, phosphate etc; then the association constants depend on the pH. Entropic driving forces for ion pairing (in absence of significant H-bonding contributions) are also found in methanol as solvent. In nonpolar solvents contact ion pairs with very high association constants are formed, ;Ionic Interactions in Natural and Synthetic Macromolecules (A. Ciferri and A. Perico, Eds), 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Inc., p. 35 ff . in the gas phase the association energies of e.g. alkali halides reach up to 200 kJ/mol. The Bjerrum or the Fuoss equation describe ion pair association as function of the ion charges zA and zB and the dielectric constant Œµ of the medium; a corresponding plot of the stability ŒîG vs. zAzB shows for over 200 ion pairs the expected linear correlation for a large variety of ions. Inorganic as well as organic ions display at moderate ionic strength I similar salt bridge association ŒîG values around 5 to 6 kJ/mol for a 1:1 combination of anion and cation, almost independent of the nature (size, polarizability etc) of the ions. The ŒîG values are additive and approximately a linear function of the charges, the interaction of e.g. a doubly charged phosphate anion with a single charged ammonium cation accounts for about 2x5 = 10 kJ/mol. The ŒîG values depend on the ionic strength I of the solution, as described by the Debye-H√ºckel equation, at zero ionic strength one observes ŒîG = 8 kJ/mol. The stabilities of the alkali-ion pairs as function of the anion charge z by can be described by a more detailed equation. Salt bridges found in proteins Figure 2. Wild type (left) and mutated (right) form of lamin A (LMNA, PDB: 1IFR). Normally, arginine 527 (blue) forms salt bridge with glutamate 537 (magenta), but R527L mutation causes loss of the complementary negative charge and structure destabilization. At the phenotype level this manifests with overlapping mandibuloacral dysplasia and progeria syndrome. The salt bridge most often arises from the anionic carboxylate (RCOO‚àí) of either aspartic acid or glutamic acid and the cationic ammonium (RNH3+) from lysine or the guanidinium (RNHC(NH2)2+) of arginine (Figure 2). Although these are the most common, other residues with ionizable side chains such as histidine, tyrosine, and serine can also participate, depending on outside factors perturbing their pKa's. The distance between the residues participating in the salt bridge is also cited as being important. The distance required is less than 4 √Ö (400 pm). Amino acids greater than this distance apart do not qualify as forming a salt bridge. Due to the numerous ionizable side chains of amino acids found throughout a protein, the pH at which a protein is placed is crucial to its stability. Methods for quantifying salt bridge stability in proteins Figure 3. A salt bridge in T4 lysozyme between aspartic acid (Asp) at residue 70 and a histidine (His) at residue 31The contribution of a salt bridge to the overall stability to the folded state of a protein can be assessed through thermodynamic data gathered from mutagenesis studies and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. Using a mutated pseudo-wild-type protein specifically mutated to prevent precipitation at high pH, the salt bridge‚Äôs contribution to the overall free energy of the folded protein state can be determined by performing a point-mutation, altering and, consequently, breaking the salt bridge. For example, a salt bridge was identified to exist in the T4 lysozyme between aspartic acid (Asp) at residue 70 and a histidine (His) at residue 31 (Figure 3). Site-directed mutagenesis with asparagine (Asn) (Figure 4) was done obtaining three new mutants: Asp70Asn His31 (Mutant 1), Asp70 His31Asn (Mutant 2), and Asp70Asn His31Asn (Double Mutant). Figure 4. Mutagenesis of T4 lysozyme salt bridge between Asp 70 and His 31 Once the mutants have been established, two methods can be employed to calculate the free energy associated with a salt bridge. One method involves the observation of the melting temperature of the wild-type protein versus that of the three mutants. The denaturation can be monitored through a change in circular dichroism. A reduction in melting temperature indicates a reduction in stability. This is quantified through a method described by Becktel and Schellman where the free energy difference between the two is calculated through ŒîTŒîS. There are some issues with this calculation and can only be used with very accurate data. In the T4 lysozyme example, ŒîS of the pseudo-wild-type had previously been reported at pH 5.5 so the midpoint temperature difference of 11 ¬∞C at this pH multiplied by the reported ŒîS of 360 cal/(mol¬∑K) (1.5 kJ/(mol¬∑K)) yields a free energy change of about ‚àí4 kcal/mol (‚àí17 kJ/mol). This value corresponds to the amount of free energy contributed to the stability of the protein by the salt bridge. Figure 5. Titration curve between the wild-type (blue) and the mutant (red)The second method utilizes nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to calculate the free energy of the salt bridge. A titration is performed, while recording the chemical shift corresponding to the protons of the carbon adjacent to the carboxylate or ammonium group. The midpoint of the titration curve corresponds to the pKa, or the pH where the ratio of protonated:deprotonated molecules is 1:1. Continuing with the T4 lysozyme example, a titration curve is obtained through observation of a shift in the C2 proton of histidine 31 (Figure 5). Figure 5 shows the shift in the titration curve between the wild-type and the mutant in which Asp70 is Asn. The salt bridge formed is between the deprotonated Asp70 and protonated His31. This interaction causes the shift seen in His31‚Äôs pKa. In the unfolded wild- type protein, where the salt bridge is absent, His31 is reported to have a pKa of 6.8 in H20 buffers of moderate ionic strength. Figure 5 shows a pKa of the wild-type of 9.05. This difference in pKa is supported by the His31‚Äôs interaction with Asp70. To maintain the salt bridge, His31 will attempt to keep its proton as long as possible. When the salt bridge is disrupted, like in the mutant D70N, the pKa shifts back to a value of 6.9, much closer to that of His31 in the unfolded state. The difference in pKa can be quantified to reflect the salt bridge‚Äôs contribution to free energy. Using Gibbs free energy: ŒîG = ‚àíRT ln(Keq), where R is the universal gas constant, T is the temperature in kelvins, and Keq is the equilibrium constant of a reaction in equilibrium. The deprotonation of His31 is an acid equilibrium reaction with a special Keq known as the acid dissociation constant, Ka: His31-H+ His31 + H+. The pKa is then related to Ka by the following: pKa = ‚àílog(Ka). Calculation of the free energy difference of the mutant and wild-type can now be done using the free energy equation, the definition of pKa, the observed pKa values, and the relationship between natural logarithms and logarithms. In the T4 lysozyme example, this approach yielded a calculated contribution of about 3 kcal/mol to the overall free energy. A similar approach can be taken with the other participant in the salt bridge, such as Asp70 in the T4 lysozyme example, by monitoring its shift in pKa after mutation of His31. A word of caution when choosing the appropriate experiment involves the location of the salt bridge within the protein. The environment plays a large role in the interaction. At high ionic strengths, the salt bridge can be completely masked since an electrostatic interaction is involved. The His31-Asp70 salt bridge in T4 lysozyme was buried within the protein. Entropy plays a larger role in surface salt bridges where residues that normally have the ability to move are constricted by their electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding. This has been shown to decrease entropy enough to nearly erase the contribution of the interaction. Surface salt bridges can be studied similarly to that of buried salt bridges, employing double mutant cycles and NMR titrations. Although cases exist where buried salt bridges contribute to stability, like anything else, exceptions do exist and buried salt bridges can display a destabilizing effect. Also, surface salt bridges, under certain conditions, can display a stabilizing effect. The stabilizing or destabilizing effect must be assessed on a case by case basis and few blanket statements are able to be made. Supramolecular chemistry Figure 6. The \\"egg shell\\" molecular capsule.Figure 7. Interlacing salt bridges that connect the two halves of the molecular capsule. Supramolecular chemistry is a field concerned with non- covalent interactions between macromolecules. Salt bridges have been used by chemists within this field in both diverse and creative ways, including sensing of anions, the synthesis of molecular capsules and double helical polymers. =Anion complexation= Major contributions of supramolecular chemistry have been devoted to recognition and sensing of anions. Ion pairing is the most important driving force for anion complexation, but selectivity e.g. within the halide series has been achieved, mostly by hydrogen bonds contributions. =Molecular capsules= Molecular capsules are chemical scaffolds designed to capture and hold a guest molecule (see molecular encapsulation). Szumna and coworkers developed a novel molecular capsule with a chiral interior. This capsule is made of two halves, like a plastic easter egg (Figure 6). Salt bridge interactions between the two halves cause them to self-assemble in solution (Figure 7). They are stable even when heated to 60 ¬∞C. =Double helical polymers= Yashima and coworkers have used salt bridges to construct several polymers that adopt a double helix conformation much like DNA. In one example, they incorporated platinum to create a double helical metallopolymer. Starting from their monomer and platinum(II) biphenyl (Figure 8), their metallopolymer self assembles through a series of ligand exchange reactions. The two halves of the monomer are anchored together through the salt bridge between the deprotonated carboxylate and the protonated nitrogens. Figure 8. Self-assembly of a double helical metallopolymer.

A 6'8\\" (2.03 m) tall forward/center from Murray State University, that was born in New York City, Johnson was selected by the New York Knicks in the third round of the 1966 NBA draft. However, Johnson never played in the NBA, joining the rival American Basketball Association instead. College career Johnson broke the color barrier as the first black varsity basketball player for a four-year program in the southeastern United States (not including historically black colleges and universities), as he suited up for Murray State University of the Ohio Valley Conference in 1963. In his three seasons of varsity basketball at Murray State, he played in 76 games and averaged 16.8 points averaged 12.9 rebounds while shooting for a .417 field goal percentage and a .731 free throw percentage. He scored a total of 1,275 points in his career. A two-time All- OVC selection, Johnson averaged 20.0 points and 14.1 rebounds as a junior, as his rebounding average ranked second in conference statistics. Johnson was a regular on three consecutive winning Racer teams, as he helped Murray State to an OVC championship in 1963-64. He served as team co-captain his senior season. He is a member of the Murray State Athletics Hall of Fame, inducted in 1979.

He was known for his sweet shooting stroke. He had the ability to drain long jumpers and had range out to the three-point arc. He filled in admirably at center for the '71-'72 Cougar team after Jim McDaniels ignored his contract with the Cougars and jumped to the Seattle SuperSonics. He also made three ABA All-Star Game appearances (1973, 1974 and 1975), twice as a member of the San Diego Conquistadors and once as a member of the Memphis Sounds. He set the ABA single-game scoring record when he erupted for 62 points against The Floridians on March 6, 1971; his record lasted almost a year until Zelmo Beaty scored 63 points against the Pittsburgh Condors on February 21, 1972. Johnson made the playoffs in three straight years from 1973 to 1975, scoring 238 points in 15 games. His 10,538 points are 9th all time in ABA history, behind only Louie Dampier, Dan Issel, Ron Boone, Mel Daniels, Julius Erving, Freddie Lewis, Donnie Freeman, and Mack Calvin, with four of them being in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Johnson finished 2nd all time in field goal attempts (10,854), 5th in field goals made (4,586), 7th in games played (647), 1st in turnover percentage (8.68%) 12th in minutes played (19,201), but also 2nd in field goals missed (6,268). =AABA= In January 1978, Johnson joined the Indiana Wizards of the All-American Basketball Alliance league.

It can be measured by holding a hand higher than heart-level and pressing the soft pad of a finger or fingernail until it turns white, then taking note of the time needed for the color to return once pressure is released. Normal capillary refill time is usually less than 2 seconds. In newborn infants, capillary refill time can be measured by pressing on the sternum for five seconds with a finger or thumb, and noting the time needed for the color to return once the pressure is released. The upper normal limit for capillary refill in newborns is 3 seconds. Capillary refill time can also be assessed in animals by pressing on their gums as opposed to the sternum which is generally covered with fur or inaccessible. A prolonged capillary refill time may be a sign of shock and can also indicate dehydration and may be a sign of dengue hemorrhagic fever and decreased peripheral perfusion. Prolonged capillary refill time may also suggest peripheral artery disease.

The Rizeigat belong to the greater Baggara Arabs fraternity of Darfur and Kordofan and speak Chadic Arabic. Numbering over one million, the Baggara are the second largest group in Western Sudan, extending into Eastern Chad. They are primarily nomadic cattle herders and their journeys are dependent upon the seasons of the year. They are a branch of the Juhayna group. They are divided into the Abbala (camel-herding) Rizeigat, who live in northern Darfur and Chad, and the Baggara who inhabit south-east Darfur. In turn they are divided into several large clans, notably the Mahamid, Mahariya and Nawaiba. The Mahamid, led by Sheikh Musa Hilal, have been deeply implicated in the Darfur conflict. The Rizeigat are the largest and most powerful of the Arab people in Darfur. Most live in southeast Darfur. The Rizeigat are composed of three main divisions which are each further subdivided. The Northern Rizeigat herd camels and the Southern Rizeigat herd cattle.Cockett, R., 2010, Sudan: Darfur and the Failure of an African State, Yale UP. The ecological differences between the north and south of Sudan allowed for two different types of nomadism to evolve: camel herders in the north and cattle herders in the south. The people who made up the precursors to the Janjaweed mainly come from the Baggara (cattle herders) who speak Arabic and are Muslim. They live in the west of Sudan, mainly south of Jebel Marra and both north and south of Kordofan. A subsection of the Baggara, the Northern Rizaygat, are one of the largest groups who make up the Janjaweed.Thelwall, R., 2011, Darfur Land & People Part 2, Calgary: University of Calgary. The Rizeigat backed the Sudanese government during the conflict with the SPLA and in Darfur. They formed frontline units as well as Murahleen, mounted raiders that attacked southern villages to loot valuables and slaves. , International Crisis Group, 12 October 2007, p. 2 During the Second Sudanese Civil War thousands of Dinka women and children were abducted and subsequently enslaved by members of the Messiria and Rizeigat tribes. An unknown number of children from the Nuba tribe were similarly abducted and enslaved.United States Department of State, \\"Trafficking in Persons Report 2008 - Sudan, 4 June 2008\\". Online. UNHCR Refworld, available at: http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/484f9a3ec.html [accessed 24 June 2008] In the recent Darfur conflict the Baggara Rizeigat joined the government troops under Janjaweed militias to exterminate rebels. Their leader, Musa Hilal, has become the most prominent Janjaweed leader in Sudan. Historically, the tribe supported and participated in recent southern conflicts. That is why the tribe was not allowed to be part of the southern peace process. Northern Rizeigat The Northern Rizeigat are Arab nomads who herd camels. They are the largest and most powerful of the Arab people in Darfur. Most live in north- east Darfur. Like most nomads, their identity and livelihoods are linked through their animals. They are pastoralists from whom the Janjaweed were almost exclusively recruited. The term Janjaweed tends to be synonymous with the ‚ÄòNorthern Rizeigat‚Äô.Adam, Biraima M. 2012.

Ownership of camels is directly related to the power of the tribe and defines the nomads relationships to land, resources, and farmers. Owning camels has produced systems that allowed for a symbiotic relationship between the nomads and settled farmers. However, certain pressures have negatively affected this livelihood. These range from population growth and increases in farming (including associated economic and commercial agriculture) to climate change and restrictive legislation. This challenged their lifestyle and led to feeding competition between the nomads and farmers, which shepherds in inevitable conflict.Young, Osman, Abusin, Asher, and Egemi, 2009, Livelihoods, Power, and Choice -- The Vulnerability of the Northern Rizaygat, Darfur, Sudan, Feinstein International Center. =Education= Power is closely linked to education and it fuels how they understand themselves, their status, and attaining power. The nomads are aware of their lack of education and therefore influence. This leads to a desire for education which pressures them to convert to a sedentary lifestyle with the idea of making education more accessible.

Designed by Alexander Parris, it is the oldest occupied governor's mansion in the United States. It has served as the home of Virginia governors and their families since 1813. This mansion is both a Virginia and a National Historic Landmark, and has had a number of successive renovations and expansions during the 20th century. Adjacent and immediately north of Capitol Square is the Court End neighborhood, which houses the White House of the Confederacy. During the Civil War, the Virginia State Capitol, also in Richmond, housed offices of the Confederacy. Tours of the mansion are offered several days a week. History The Executive Mansion in 1905 When Richmond became the capital of Virginia in 1779, there was no residence for the governor, but Thomas Jefferson rented one. The state was so poor that it could not pay the rent in time and blamed Jefferson for the problem. The state finally paid its rent and built a residence for the governor on the site of the present building. The law that provided for the construction of the current building was signed on February 13, 1811 by James Monroe, with the building being completed in 1813. He was succeeded by George William Smith. Smith, however, was not the first governor to live in the mansion because he lost his life in the Richmond Theatre fire while he was saving others on December 26, 1811. His successor, James Barbour, was the first governor to live in the mansion. The term \\"mansion\\" was not used in the law authorizing it to be built, but it has been used ever since. The gardens were redesigned in the 1950s, at the request of Governor Thomas B. Stanley, by noted landscape architect Charles Gillette.Library of Virginia: About the Charles F. Gillette Photograph Collection Under Governor James S. Gilmore III, the Mansion was renovated and expanded in an effort to restore the home to its historical appearance but also to bring the Mansion into compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and to provide additional living space for the First Family. Anne Holton lived in the mansion twice: during the 1970s when her father, A. Linwood Holton Jr., was governor and when her husband Tim Kaine was governor. Thomas Jefferson's daughter Martha Jefferson Randolph, known as \\"Patsy\\", was also the daughter and wife (to Thomas Mann Randolph Jr.) of Virginia governors, but never lived in the Mansion. Currently, Governor Ralph Northam occupies the mansion. = In the Media = It was featured on American Idol (season 5) when Tim Kaine and his wife, Anne Holton, welcomed Richmond-native and Idol-finalist Elliott Yamin and his family to the mansion on national television. Restoration and remodeling work on the Mansion was shown on Bob Vila's Home Again television show's tenth season, which aired in early 2000. The Mansion's most notable television appearance occurred on January 31, 2006, when recently inaugurated Governor Tim Kaine delivered the Democratic response to the 2006 State of the Union address. The address was delivered from the Mansion's historic ballroom. Plaque that is at the gate of the mansion, describing its history.

The hotel is located at 37 King Street East, and it occupies the entire block bounded by King Street on the north, Victoria Street on the east, Colborne Street on the south and Leader Lane on the west. History The King Edward Hotel was designed by Chicago architect Henry Ives Cobb and Toronto architect E.J. Lennox for developer George Gooderham's Toronto Hotel Company, and was granted its name by namesake King Edward VII. The structure opened in 1903 with 400 rooms and 300 baths, and it claimed to be entirely fireproof. King Street in 1908, with the King Edward Hotel on the left In 1922, an 18-storey tower with 530 additional rooms was added to the east of the original eight-storey structure. On the two top floors of the tower is the Crystal Ballroom, that until the late 1950s was the most fashionable in the city. The room was closed in the late 1950s due to stricter fire codes and was not restored during the 1979-81 renovation. When the Omni Hotel chain invested in the hotel in 2013, restoring the ballroom was one of its announced goals. The ballroom re-opened in April 2017 after a closure of 38 years. Throughout the years, the hotel has passed through the hands of a number of owners. The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company became owners in 1933 when it foreclosed on the mortgage. Between 1941 and 1950, the hotel passed between C. A. Ripley and Vernon Cardy. Cardy's Hotel chain also owned the Mount Royal Hotel in Montreal, the Royal Connaught Hotel in Hamilton, Ontario, the General Brock Hotel in Niagara Falls, the Prince Edward Hotel in Windsor, Ontario and the Alpine Inn in Sainte-Ad√®le, Quebec. In 1950, Sheraton purchased Cardy's hotels and assumed management of the property, renaming it The King Edward Sheraton. The hotel dropped the Sheraton name in 1975, after the opening of the brand new Four Seasons Sheraton Hotel nearby, becoming the King Edward Hotel, but it remained part of Sheraton for another three years, until 1978. After a number of years of decline, Trans Nation, Inc. bought the hotel in 1979 for $6.3 million and closed it on September 2, 1979, for a $30 million restoration designed by Stanford Downey Architects Inc. The property reopened May 7, 1981, as part of Trusthouse Forte Hotels, which bought the hotel outright on December 23 of that year. When Forte acquired hotels from Air France in 1994, the King Edward was rechristened King Edward. The chain was involved in several other acquisitions and mergers between 1996 and 2003 when the brand came under the ownership of Lehman Brothers Holdings. For the hotel's 100th anniversary, the Ontario Heritage Trust unveiled a commemorative plaque on May 8, 2003. Starwood Hotels purchased the brand from Lehman in 2005 and the hotel was renamed, dropping Royal, to become simply King Edward. In 2009, a consortium purchased the structure but retained to manage it. The new owners announced a major restoration that included creating 140 condominiums on the third through fifth floors which had been unused for a number of years. In 2012, Skyline Hotels & Resorts, one of the owners, assumed management and marketing from and the hotel became The King Edward Hotel. Omni Hotels assumed management on August 1, 2013, when the hotel was renamed The Omni King Edward Hotel. After managing the hotel for two years, Omni Hotels bought it outright on November 24, 2015. Significance Notable dignitaries and luminaries housed in the hotel have included Mark Twain, Rudolph Valentino, Louis Armstrong, Elvis Presley, Margaret Thatcher, Britney Spears, and Ernest Hemingway who had lived in the hotel for a period. The Beatles stayed at the hotel's royal suite during their first visit to Toronto, in 1964, and caused the hotel's biggest commotion to date, when 3,000 fans packed the streets and flooded the lobby. In 1969, John Lennon and Yoko Ono stayed in the same royal suite a day before their bed-in for peace began. In February 1964, \\"moralists picketed\\" when Liz Taylor and Richard Burton stayed in a suite together; they were not married to one another at the time, causing a scandal. The King Edward has not only housed film stars but also film sets, from the mellow, Leonard Cohen‚Äôs 1983 musical I am a Hotel, to the melodramatic, Jamie Foxx‚Äôs film Bait, which, during a stunt mishap, caused an explosion that shook the building and shattered windows.

He also made numerous recordings that are still available on CD reissues. Nash's voice was of the light tenor class known as \\"tenore di grazia\\". The critic J. B. Steane referred to him as \\"the English lyric tenor par excellence, without equal then or now.\\"Steane, John, \\"Historic Recordings\\", Gramophone, August 1989, p. 103 He appeared in tenor roles in operas by Mozart, Verdi, Wagner and Puccini among others, at the Royal Opera House, and the Glyndebourne Festival. His operatic career lasted from 1924 to 1958. As a concert singer, Nash was known for his performances in oratorio, and in particular in the title role of Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius, making the first gramophone recording of the work, in 1945.  Biography  =Early years= Nash was born in the South London district of Deptford on 14 June 1894, the son of William Nash, master builder, and his wife, Harriet Emma n√©e Carr.Baker, Anne Pimlott, \\"Nash, (William) Heddle (1894‚Äì1961)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 9 October 2010 The family was musical, and listening at home to a gramophone record by Enrico Caruso prompted Nash to apply for a scholarship at the Blackheath Conservatoire of Music.Meadmore, W. S. \\"Heddle Nash\\", The Gramophone, April 1937, p. 5, accessed 9 October 2010 He was accepted, but a week later World War I broke out. Nash joined the army, serving in France, Salonika, Egypt and Palestine. The Blackheath scholarship was held open until after the war; Nash took it up on his return. He had some experience of concert and oratorio work, and then he accepted an offer to sing with Podrecca and Feodora's Italian Marionettes. Unseen, standing in the orchestra pit of the Scala and Coliseum theatres, he sang the tenor roles in many Italian operas while on the stages the puppets mimed the action. After the London season, the marionette company secured a contract to appear in New York; Nash went with them. On his return to London a friend advanced the money for him to study in Milan with Giuseppe Borgatti. On 7 April 1923 Nash married Florence Emily Violet Pearce, daughter of a sign manufacturer. They had two sons, John Dennis Heddle Nash (1926-1994), who became an operatic baritone, and David L Heddle Nash (b. 1930).John Heddle Nash (30 March 1928 ‚Äì 29 September 1994): see, Forbes, Elizabeth, \\"Obituary: John Heddle Nash\\", The Independent, 7 October 1994 While studying with Borgatti, Nash made his operatic debut in 1924 at the Teatro Carcano in Milan, when he replaced an indisposed tenor in the role of Almaviva in Rossini's Il barbiere di Siviglia. It was a notable success. After singing at Turin, Bologna and Genoa, Nash returned to England with his wife in 1925. He had developed an Italianate style of singing that remained with him: it was said of him that he sang everything as though it were by Verdi. =Opera in England= On his return to London Nash was engaged by the Old Vic Company under Lilian Baylis to sing tenor roles in English. His first part for the company was the Duke in Rigoletto. His success was instantaneous. The Musical Times said that it was a pleasure to welcome a very beautiful tenor voice, praised his clarity of diction, and predicted that Nash would be one of the eminent lyric tenors of the future.The Musical Times, 1 January 1926, p. 56 At the Old Vic he appeared as Tonio in The Daughter of the Regiment, in the title role in Faust, as Pinkerton in Madama Butterfly and as Tamino in The Magic Flute.Blyth, Alan, \\"Nash, Heddle\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, accessed 9 October 2010 At the end of the Old Vic season he joined the British National Opera Company, going on tour with the company after a short London season. His roles included Almaviva, Fenton in Falstaff, Turiddu in Cavalleria rusticana, Rom√©o in Rom√©o et Juliette, Des Grieux in Manon and David in Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg. In 1929, Nash made his debut at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden as Don Ottavio in Don Giovanni in the company's International Season. He sang leading tenor roles in Italian and French operas at Covent Garden until World War II, including Almaviva, Pinkerton, Faust, Rom√©o, Rodolfo in La boh√®me, Eisenstein in Die Fledermaus, Rinuccio in Gianni Schicchi, and Pedrillo in Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail. The critic Alan Blyth called Nash the leading British lyric tenor of the 20th century, and considered him \\"ideal casting for the heroes of French 19th- century Romantic opera.\\"Blyth, Alan, \\"Command Performance\\", Gramophone, December 2005, p. 50 Nash had a repertoire of twenty-four operas, and sang fluently in English, French, German and Italian.\\"Heddle Nash‚ÄîBrief Biography\\", The Gramophone, December 1942, p. 20 He was proud of being the first Englishman to sing David in Die Meistersinger in the International Season at Covent Garden. In the first Glyndebourne season, in 1934, Nash played Basilio in Le nozze di Figaro at the inaugural performance, Pedrillo, and Ferrando in Cos√¨ fan tutte. He sang these three roles every year until 1938, adding Ottavio in Don Giovanni in 1937. The critic Richard Capell wrote, \\"Hardly another tenor of his time has sung Mozart with such elegance and at the same time such a minstrel-like effect of spontaneity.\\"Capell, Richard quoted in The Musical Times, October 1961, p. 645 Nash also sang in lighter musical stage works, appearing in Carl Mill√∂cker's The Dubarry in 1932, and Edward German's Merrie England in 1945.The Manchester Guardian, 15 April 1932, p. 13; and The Observer, 9 September 1945, p. 2 During the war Nash toured with the Carl Rosa Opera Company, often singing opposite the Australian soprano Joan Hammond. His roles included Faust, Pinkerton and Rodolfo. After the Royal Opera House reopened following its wartime closure, Nash sang Des Grieux and David. His last appearance at Covent Garden was in Die Meistersinger in April 1948. He continued to appear on stage until July 1958, when he reprised a character role that he had created a year earlier, Dr Manette in Arthur Benjamin's A Tale of Two Cities at Sadler's Wells. The Musical Times called it \\"a most moving performance\\".The Musical Times, September 1957, p. 504; and The Times, 22 July 1958, p. 11 = Oratorio and later career = Nash's career was not restricted to opera; he gave many song recitals, made radio broadcasts and performed in concerts and oratorio productions all over Britain. In 1931, he was chosen by Sir Edward Elgar to sing the title role in The Dream of Gerontius, in a performance conducted by Elgar himself. Henceforth, Nash was closely associated with the part, singing it at every Three Choirs Festival from 1934 to 1950. The critic Sir Neville Cardus considered him the greatest of all exponents of the part.Cardus, Neville, \\"Where piety and music combine\\", The Guardian, 4 March 1960, p. 9 Nash's 1945 recording of Gerontius with Malcolm Sargent is still regarded by many critics as unsurpassed.Blyth, Alan, Review, Gramophone, April 1975, p. 90 Nash sang regularly in Messiah, and other oratorios. In 1938, he was one of the 16 singers chosen by Ralph Vaughan Williams to perform his Serenade to Music, composed as a tribute to Sir Henry Wood. The work was recorded soon afterwards, with the same 16 singers. This historic performance can be heard on CD re-issues.Aschenbach, Andrew, \\"The Sublime Serenade,\\" Gramophone, July 2008, p. 42 In his later years, Nash was appointed professor of singing at the Royal College of Music. He sang in his last Messiah a few months before his death from lung cancer on 14 August 1961. On his tombstone in Chislehurst Cemetery are carved the opening words of part two of The Dream of Gerontius: \\"I went to sleep and now I am refreshed.\\"\\"Heddle Nash (1895‚Äì1961)\\" , London Borough of Bromley, accessed 9 October 2010  Recordings  Many of Nash's recordings have been reissued on compact disc. He made his first recordings for Columbia Records during the late 1920s and early 1930s. These were mostly of operatic titles, including arias from The Magic Flute, Don Giovanni, Il barbiere di Siviglia, Leh√°r's Friederike, Jeptha, L'elisir d'amore and Rigoletto, plus a number of English songs and ballads.See Catalogue of Columbia Records (London, September 1933 edition). His 1932 Columbia recording of the serenade from Bizet's La jolie fille de Perth, sung in English, became a best-seller, making a little-known item of music extremely popular in his homeland. In 1927, he participated in the recording of complete English-language versions of Leoncavallo's Pagliacci and Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana with the forces of the British National Opera. In 1935, he recorded a complete Act IV of Puccini's La boh√®me conducted by Beecham. Nash was the tenor in Beecham's first LP recording of Messiah, issued in 1953.Porter, Andrew, \\"Four LP Messiahs\\", The Gramophone, May 1954, p. 54. The reviewer thought that \\"Heddle Nash seems to be rather tired as he attacks high notes and he sentimentalises a good deal of his part.\\" The Gramophone wrote, \\"Those who are apt to remember him as an essentially lyrical tenor should turn up his \\"Sound an Alarm\\" from Judas Maccabaeus, which is nothing if not robust.\\"Wimbush, Roger, \\"Heddle Nash\\", The Gramophone, January 1962, p. 116 Further reading =Biographies= * Allen, Eleanor (2010) Heddle Nash: Singing Against the Tide\\".

He served as the Deputy Attorney General of the United States from March 17, 2006, to July 26, 2007. Prior to that, he was the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. He was nominated as U.S. Attorney by President George W. Bush and confirmed on September 14, 2001. McNulty was nominated to the position of Deputy Attorney General on October 20, 2005, following the withdrawal of Timothy Flanigan's candidacy. McNulty was sworn into office on March 17, 2006. He replaced acting Deputy Attorney General Robert McCallum Jr. McNulty graduated from Grove City College, a small Christian school in western Pennsylvania, in 1980. He received his Juris Doctor (J.D.) from the Capital University School of Law in 1983. As a U.S. Attorney, McNulty is most noted for overseeing the prosecution of a number of high-profile cases, including those against terror suspects John Walker Lindh, Ahmed Omar Abu Ali and Zacarias Moussaoui. Before becoming a U.S. Attorney, McNulty directed President Bush's transition team for the Department of Justice and then served as Principal Associate Attorney General. From 1990 to 1993, under President George H. W. Bush, McNulty was the Justice Department's director of policy and its chief spokesman. On July 30, 2007, McNulty announced that he would be joining the law firm of Baker & McKenzie LLP as a partner in their Washington, D.C. office. On May 16, 2014, Grove City College named McNulty their ninth president. He also serves on the Board of Trustees of the Trinity Forum.  Career before Department of Justice  McNulty started his public career in 1983 \\"as a Democrat and counsel to the House Ethics Committee, [before] eventual bec[oming] a Republican....\\" McNulty served the United States Congress for 12 years. He was Chief Counsel and Director of Legislative Operations for the Majority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives. He was also Chief Counsel to the House Subcommittee on Crime where he served for eight years. During those years he was a principal draftsman of many anti-terrorism, drug control, firearms and anti-fraud statutes. He also served as chief counsel and communications director for House Judiciary Committee Republicans during the impeachment of President Bill Clinton.  Career at Department of Justice  McNulty has played a significant role in shaping criminal justice policy in the Commonwealth of Virginia. He was a primary architect of the \\"Parole Abolition and Sentencing Reform\\" initiative in 1994, and he served on the board of the Department of Criminal Justice Services and the Advisory Committee of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. The Washington Post noted: \\"He helped shepherd John D. Ashcroft through a contentious confirmation as attorney general in 2001 and was appointed the U.S. attorney in Alexandria three days after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. McNulty, who had no trial experience, presided over a dramatic expansion of that office over the next four years before taking over as Gonzales's second-in-command.\\" As Deputy Attorney General, McNulty reported to the Attorney General, and served as Chairman of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales' Advisory Committee and as Chairman of the Washington/Baltimore High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area. In December, 2006 McNulty issued Charging Guidelines for Corporate Fraud Prosecutions, which are informally referred to as the \\"McNulty Memorandum.\\" The guidelines replaced the Thompson Memorandum, which was issued in January 2003 by then-Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson, and provides guidance to federal prosecutors in deciding whether to charge a corporation, rather than or in addition to individuals within the corporation, with criminal offenses. Under the Thompson memo, in deciding whether a corporation was cooperating with an investigation, prosecutors were allowed to consider two controversial factors: 1) whether a company would agree to waive the attorney-client privilege in regard to conversations had by its employees, and 2) whether a company had declined to pay attorneys' fees for its employees. The McNulty Memo requires that when federal prosecutors seek privileged attorney-client communications or legal advice from a company, the U.S. Attorney must obtain written approval from the Deputy Attorney General. On May 14, 2007 McNulty announced his resignation in a letter to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. McNulty's resignation took effect July 26, 2007. U.S. Attorneys controversy In January 2007, shortly after a number of U.S. Attorneys were fired the same day (December 7, 2006), Congress began investigations. McNulty became a central figure after he told the Senate Judiciary Committee in a hearing on February 6, 2007, \\"that the White House played only a marginal role in the dismissals,\\" a statement that was contradicted by later testimony and subsequently released documents. He also said most of the prosecutors were fired for \\"performance-related\\" reasons. That statement angered many of the dismissed U.S. attorneys, most of whom had very positive evaluations, and who had refrained from criticizing the DOJ about their surprise dismissals, and that personal explanation was not forthcoming from the Department justifying their dismissals.\\" As Legal Times explained: \\"McNulty's testimony angered three key constituencies in the scandal: the attorney general, Congress, and the fired U.S. attorneys. Gonzales, it would later emerge, was upset that McNulty had essentially disclosed the involvement of the White House in the firing of H.E. \\"Bud\\" Cummins III, the U.S. attorney in Arkansas. And members of Congress would note that, in testifying that Cummins had been fired to make way for an acolyte of White House political adviser Karl Rove, McNulty was contradicting an earlier assertion by Gonzales that the firings hadn't been motivated by political reasons.'...It also spurred most of the fired prosecutors to publicly defend themselves....\\" Cumins was removed \\"to make room for Tim Griffin, a Karl Rove prot√©g√© who had headed the opposition-research operation at the Republican National Committee. Gonzales was upset, his former chief of staff Kyle Sampson has told congressional investigators, that McNulty's revelation put \\"in the public sphere\\" the uncomfortable fact that the White House helped engineer the dismissal.\\" On March 13th, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales conceded that McNulty's testimony was inaccurate, \\"incomplete information was communicated or may have been communicated to Congress.\\" Senator Charles Schumer said he was told by Justice Department officials that Carol Lam and others were terminated because of \\"performance-related,\\" but Schumer said, Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty later \\"called me on the phone and said, 'I am sorry that I didn't tell you the truth.\\"' McNulty, in turn, was said to be angry at being kept out of the loop, and for being misled, telling congressional investigators in private testimony to Congress on April 27, 2007 that \\"Kyle Sampson, then Gonzales's chief of staff, and Monica M. Goodling, then the department's White House liaison, did not brief him fully before his testimony.\\" On May 14, McNulty announced his resignation, which took effect July 26, 2007. On May 28, 2007, Monica Goodling, the Department's White House liaison, was summoned under a limited grant of immunity to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, where she was quick to refute McNulty's earlier charges against her by stating that, in fact, it was McNulty who \\"had not been fully candid\\" about the 2006 U.S. Attorney firings.

Currently, it has about 2,500 students and 100 teachers operating in two shifts, a morning session for Form 3, 4 and 5 students aged 15 to 18 years old, and an afternoon session for Remove, Form 1 and 2 students aged 13 to 15 years old. History When it was proposed that a new secondary school be built in Cheras in July 1987, Taman Connaught was identified as an ideal place to build the school. Under a RM2.5 million World Bank loan, construction began on 4 December 1989. Construction was completed on 27 November 1991. During the construction period, the first cohort of Connaughtians consisting of thirteen teachers and 197 students started the first school session on 4 December 1989. Students and teachers temporarily used the adjacent primary school SJK(C) Taman Connaught until 1990. Five classrooms were used for administration, teaching and learning purposes. Eventually, the students and teachers moved to the newly built school on 3 December 1990 although there was no power supply. The newly completed school comprised two 3-storey buildings and one 2-storey building, six science labs, three life skills workshops, three home science rooms, a canteen, a surau, a staffroom, a car park, a field and a library. There were 34 classrooms available for teaching and learning activities. =3 computer labs= In January 1998, the surau located on the ground floor of Block B was moved to the top floor of Block A while the computer room was moved to the second floor. Subsequently, the computer room was upgraded to a fully equipped computer lab in 2000 with the assistance of the PTA of SMKTC. With the support of the school's PTA, in January 2002, the first classroom on the first floor of Block B was converted into a second computer lab. In May 2003, the audiovisual room was converted into a third computer lab which was fully funded by the Ministry of Education. =Nowadays= Today, the school boasts four blocks of buildings, two air-conditioned cabin classrooms, six science labs, three life skills workshops, three computer labs, a newly renovated canteen, a surau, a staffroom with a working centre, a school field, a basketball court, a volleyball court, a sepak takraw court, a resource centre, a self-access learning room, a multimedia room, a first aid room, a music room, an extended car park and a large hall.

After the lackluster sales of Across a Crowded Room and Daring Adventures, Polydor declined their option to renew their contract with Thompson. Thompson's then manager Gary Stamler negotiated a deal with Capitol Records and Thompson cut his first album for his new label in 1988. This was a good time for Thompson to be at Capitol. The label was managed by Hale Milgrim at the time and Milgrim was a fan of Thompson and his work. Thus Capitol invested more money and effort into promoting Thompson than had been the case in the past and with other labels. Mitchell Froom was retained as producer, and the album was again recorded in Los Angeles with American session musicians providing most of the backing. Thompson still used British players to lend specifically British touches to some songs. In particular long-time collaborators John Kirkpatrick, Aly Bain and Philip Pickett are used, and members of the Fairey Engineering Band provide a brass backing to I Still Dream that owes more to the Salvation Army than it does to Memphis or any other American centre of music.  Reception  The album was well-received by the music press, and sales, whilst not stellar, were boosted by Capitol's commitment to promoting artist and album.

The building was designed to be fireproof, thanks to the steel frame. In the event of a fire, fire doors would shut the elevators and staircases, with two large fire escapes in the rear. Steam heat on a vacuum system would warm the interior. Electric lights throughout and telephone cables on each floor were touted as features. When described in a period newspaper, it was to have a flag pole 200 feet above street level and four high-speed elevators going up 187 feet. It was projected to hold 1500 people. The exterior was to be made of stone, brick and terra cotta (sourced from Perth-Amboy and used on the lower three floors) with limestone casings. The floors are made of Canadian Portland cement. The only use of wood was in the windows, doors and frames. The roof was to have a promenade, with the owner unsure if the public would be admitted. The bank would occupy the first two storeys. Construction of the building was marked by several accidents and one fatality. An engineer was scalded by a faulty steam injector in November 1905.The Globe. 17 November 1905, p. 12; 18 December 1906, p. 7 The building was innovative in its leasing arrangements. It was the first major Toronto building to introduce the New York system of leasing by the square foot.The Toronto Daily Star. 16 June 1906, p. 21 The building was completed by early December 1906, and the bank shortly moved into its new headquarters.The Globe. 18 December 1906, p. 7 The Traders Bank was based in Toronto, with strong roots in rural Ontario; it would later become part of the Royal Bank of Canada, with RBC acquiring the Traders Bank in 1912. The building's height was fairly controversial at the time. A number of the city's public intellectuals and many of its architects expressed dismay at the prospect of skyscrapers. It would overload the property values and shade the streets, trapping the disease-causing \\"miasmas\\" that still lurked in the public imagination. The Globe newspaper complained: \\"in the next ten or fifteen years .... The chief retail thorofares will then look like a Colorado canyon.\\"The Globe. 25 June 1909, p. 26 Other editorials on the skyscraper theme compared Toronto to New York: > but if the skyscraper habit grows, as there is every indication it will ‚Ä¶ > the lower end of Yonge street and the central portion of King street will > become dim sunless canyons such as one sees in the financial centre of New > York.The Globe. 16 March 1912, p. 38 The tall building did change the customary wind patterns at Yonge & Colborne. There were signs of urban canyon effect winds by the spring of 1909.The Toronto Daily Star. 7 April 1909, p. 13 The City Architect in November 1907 promised it would not start a trend: There would be strict enforcement of the 200 foot height limit,The Toronto Daily Star. 12 November 1907, p. 1 which was still taller than the building itself. As it turned out, city council was usually persuaded to waive the height limits downtown, and the Traders' Bank was very shortly overtaken by even taller buildings. Heritage Protection The property is designated under Part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act since 1976. The City notes it was first known as the Traders Bank Building , later Montreal Trust. It was built in 1905-06, designed by Carrere & Hastings in association with F.S. Baker. Part of the property to be later known as 6-8 Colborne Street was removed from the designated property in 1999, not being of architectural merit. The designation notes: \\" The Montreal Trust Building, originally the Traders Bank Building, Nos. 61-67 Yonge Street at 4 Colborne Street (NE), 1905 by Carriere & Hastings; F. S. Baker, Associate is designated on architectural grounds as a notable example of French inspired Beaux Arts classicism by a very important firm of New York architects. The building was, when finished, the tallest building in the British Empire (the first skyscraper in Toronto) and it still plays an important part in the streetscape of Yonge Street.\\" References External links * \\"Toronto's Edwardian Skyscraper Row\\" in JSSAC 40 - 2015 Buildings and structures in Toronto Historic bank buildings in Canada Office buildings completed in 1905 Carr√®re and Hastings buildings Neoclassical architecture in Canada 1905 establishments in Ontario ","title":"Trader's Bank Building"},{"id":"2987234","text":"The Triple Crossing, where three railroads cross, in the city of Richmond. Transportation in Richmond, Virginia and its immediate surroundings include land, sea and air modes. This article includes the independent city and portions of the contiguous counties of Henrico and Chesterfield. While almost all of Henrico County would be considered part of the Richmond area, southern and eastern portions of Chesterfield adjoin the three smaller independent cities of Petersburg, Hopewell, and Colonial Heights, collectively commonly called the Tri-Cities area. A largely rural section of southwestern Chesterfield may be considered not a portion of either suburban area. Richmond-Petersburg metropolitan area is considered by many criteria to include the Tri-Cities area and many more surrounding counties, incorporated towns, and unincorporated communities. (For information on this larger area, see Richmond-Petersburg MSA). Transportation history =Antebellum= The Chesterfield Railroad was a gravity railway which transported coal from the mines in Midlothian Richmond's transportation history dates to the early 17th century. The Virginia Colony, established at Jamestown in 1607, was dependent upon the waterways as avenues of commerce. Along the river, the James River plantations such as John Rolfe's Varina Farms had their own wharfs on the rivers. Located east of the Fall Line, they were soon shipping tobacco and other export crops abroad. The two cities which became the modern City of Richmond were first established as ports on the north and south banks of the James River due to their location at the head of navigation on the fall line. The ports at the head of navigation became transfer points, and Richmond, on the north bank of the river, and its former neighbor Manchester, along the south bank, became points for canals which were built to bypass the falls and rapids and connect with navigable waters upstream. Transfer to and from watercraft was also undertaken as land transportation developed in the form of turnpikes and railroads. The first stagecoach lines to Richmond were established during the War of 1812, and the first regular steamboat service began on the James River in 1815. Early the 19th century, the Virginia Board of Public Works began funding transportation infrastructure improvements, stimulating such private enterprises as the James River and Kanawha Canal, the Chesterfield Railroad, and numerous turnpikes. By 1855, Richmond had railroads extending in many directions. Long championed in the Virginia General Assembly by Whitmell P. Tunstall, the Richmond and Danville Railroad to the southwest was completed in 1854. Others included the Virginia Central Railroad, to the west, and the Richmond and Petersburg Railroad to the south, initially from Manchester. The predecessor to the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad was complete north to Potomac Creek, where it connected with steamship service via the Chesapeake Bay to Alexandria, Baltimore, and beyond. =Civil War = During the American Civil War, when Richmond served as the capital of the Confederate States of America, Richmond's railroads and connections to the other southern states were crucial to its support. Defenses at Drewry's Bluff blocked the Union Navy from access to Richmond (and its sister city Manchester) via the river. The rail connections through Petersburg were the key links which Union General Ulysses S. Grant sought to sever during the Siege of Petersburg in 1864‚Äì1865. The fall of Petersburg in April 1865 necessitated the evacuation of Richmond by Jefferson Davis and the Confederate cabinet. The Civil War effectively ended with the surrender during General Robert E. Lee's retreat a week later. =Reconstruction= After the Civil War, Richmond's (and Manchester's) transportation infrastructure was quickly rebuilt, and improvements and expansion resumed. Virginia State Engineer Claudius Crozet's innovative tunnels under the Blue Ridge Mountains became a key portion of Collis P. Huntington's Chesapeake and Ohio railroad linking eastern Virginia to the Ohio River Valley which was completed in 1873. By 1881, Pocahontas coal was riding the rails from the mountains eastbound for export via the C&O; through Richmond to coal piers at Newport News on the harbor of Hampton Roads. The James River and Kanawha Canal was conveyed to Major James H. Dooley's Richmond and Allegheny Railroad by a deed dated March 4, 1880. Railroad construction workers promptly started laying tracks on the towpath creating a new water-level rail route which was soon purchased by the C&O.; =Streetcars= Streetcar line running down Broad Street, c. 1914 Richmond had the first successful electrically powered street railway system in the United States. Designed by electric power pioneer, Frank J. Sprague, the trolley system opened its first line in January 1888. Richmond's hills, long a transportation obstacle, were considered an ideal proving ground. The new technology soon replaced horsecars. As part of a national trend, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the electrically powered street railway systems accelerated Richmond's expansion. To generate traffic and fuel sales of property, amusement parks were created at the end of the lines at Lakeside Park, Westhampton Park (now University of Richmond), and Forest Hill Park. Rails of interurban streetcar services formed a suburban network from Richmond extending north to Ashland and south to Chester, Colonial Heights, Petersburg and Hopewell. Another interurban route ran east along the Nine Mile Road and terminated at the Seven Pines National Cemetery at the end of the Nine Mile Road, where many Union Civil War dead were interred. The area's streetcar suburbs included Highland Park, Barton Heights, Ginter Park, Woodland Heights, and Highland Springs. In 1945, the network of trams was bought up by Virginia Transit Company to close it down, almost at once, and substitute it by a bus system. =Early 20th century: Union stations, consolidation, bridges= A major issue for Manchester and Richmond residents in the 19th and early 20th century were the toll bridges over the James River. In 1910, Manchester agreed to a political consolidation with the much larger independent city of Richmond. Richmond's better-known name was used for both areas as it contained the location of Virginia's state capital. Key features of the consolidation agreement were requirements that a \\"free bridge\\" across the James River be maintained indefinitely. Instead of barrier between neighboring cities, under the consolidation, the James River became the centerpiece of the expanded Richmond. Supplementing the two free bridges near the downtown area (Mayo and Ninth Street Bridges), several additional toll bridges were constructed to the west, notably the Westham Bridge in 1911, the Boulevard Bridge in 1927, and the four-lane Robert E. Lee Memorial Bridge in 1934. Richmond Main Street Station in 1971 Two new union railroad stations opened in Richmond during the first two decades of the 20th century. The only railroad continuing its own passenger station became the Southern Railway, with its Hull Street Station in Manchester. In 1901, Richmond's Main Street Station was built by the Seaboard Air Line Railroad and the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway. It was designed by the Philadelphia firm of Wilson, Harris, and Richards in the French Renaissance style. A new Broad Street Station was built in 1917 by the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad. Broad Street Station has a huge facility, serving several railroads, notably the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. Designed in the neoclassical style by the architect John Russell Pope, passenger service to the station ceased in 1975. The station then became the home of the Science Museum of Virginia, which remains in the substantially remodeled and expanded building. Hull Street Station is also a museum in modern-times, but after being idle and in other uses for many years, Main Street Station saw Amtrak service restored in 2003. In 1927, the dedication of Richard Evelyn Byrd Flying Field (later known as Byrd Airport, and now Richmond International Airport) included a visit by aviator Charles Lindbergh. The airport was named after Richard E. Byrd, the famous American polar explorer born in Virginia, who was the brother of Virginia Governor Harry F. Byrd. =Rise of the automobile: highways and expressways= Also in 1927, Virginia's State Highway Department, the predecessor of the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT), was formed. By World War II, a network of highways linked Richmond and the surrounding region with other communities and other states. As roads improved in the early 20th century, streetcars were unable to compete with automobiles and buses. The Richmond-Petersburg area's interurban streetcar services were gone by 1939, replaced by buses. The last streetcars ran in 1949 on the Highland Park line when they were also replaced by buses. The Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike under construction in 1958 After World War II, with only four traffic lanes and long stretches of undivided roadway, the Jefferson Davis Memorial Highway became a major area of traffic congestion, as well as the site of occasional spectacular and deadly head-on collisions. In 1955, prior to the creation of the U.S. Interstate Highway System, the Virginia General Assembly created the Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike Authority as a state agency to administer the new Turnpike of the same name. The new toll road was planned with only 15 exits, and most of these were well away from the highly developed commercial areas along parallel U.S. 301. The Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike opened in 1958, and soon was granted the Interstate 95 designation through Richmond. Local automobile commuters could buy booklets of toll tickets that cost about 8 cents per toll plaza. The full (non-commuter) rate was 25 cents per mainline toll plaza, increased to 50 cents in March 1989, with lower amounts at some exits. In 1989, the exit toll plazas in the City of Richmond at the I-95/I-64/I-195 Bryan Park interchange and at VA-161 Boulevard were removed, thereby making toll-free the I-95 portion of the Turnpike north of Boulevard. The former Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike became completely toll-free on July 1, 1992. The Richmond Metropolitan Authority was formed in 1966 by the General Assembly. The RMA was \\"a small state agency that was empowered to design, acquire right-of-way, construct, operate, collect tolls, and maintain the Richmond Expressway System.\\"http://www.roadstothefuture.com/Richmond_Interstate_Expy.html#Expressway_Planning Eventually, the RMA built and opened the Powhite Parkway in 1973, and the Downtown Expressway in 1976 as toll roads. The RMA also acquired the Boulevard Bridge. In addition to operating and maintaining three of Richmond's toll roads and bridges, the RMA also built a downtown parking deck, operated commuter buses for a time, and owns The Diamond, a sports stadium. VDOT built the Powhite Extension (State Route 76) located in Chesterfield County as a separate toll road which opened in 1988. The public bus systems which had replaced the local and interurban streetcars were operated by public service companies, and were dependent upon passenger fares. As ridership plummeted in the second half of the century, urban-suburban bus lines began to fail financially. By the early 1970s, only a few suburban lines were left, notably including Bon Air Transit Company extending to the suburb of Bon Air in Chesterfield County and Fairfield Transit Company, extending to Seven Pines in eastern Henrico County. The inner city company, Virginia Transit Company, was converted to become the government-owned Greater Richmond Transit (GRTC) in 1972. Privately owned commuter operators gradually discontinued services; the last privately owned suburban public route service was the Mechanicsville Bus Line route, which ended in June 2004. Greyhound Lines and the National Trailways Bus System consolidated services formerly in downtown Richmond at a new terminal near the Boulevard exit of I-95 and I-64 in the 1980s. Early in the 21st century, the trend of route reductions which began in the 1950s was continuing. Toll roads and Smart Tags The Boulevard Bridge introduced commuter passes to Richmond in the form of annual permits. These initially took the form of special \\"topper\\" (add-on) license plate strips; windshield decals were used later. As stated above, much of I-95 was built as the Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike, a toll road. Commuters could purchase (much) lower cost passage, leading to local humor to the effect that through traffic from out-of-state was paying for the road, a position founded in some truth. On June 1, 1987, the Richmond Metropolitan Authority (RMA) introduced toll tokens for use on the Powhite Parkway and the Downtown Expressway. In 1994, The RMA and Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) conducted surveys to determine if patrons of the Downtown Expressway, the Powhite Parkway, the Powhite Parkway Extension would support Electronic Toll Collection (ETC). In late 1996, the Virginia General Assembly passed legislation requesting the RMA and VDOT to expedite the implementation of an ETC system. In studying the costs associated with ETC, RMA management determined that a toll increase would be necessary to cover the installation and higher operating expenses. The RMA, along with VDOT, implemented the ETC system -- Smart Tag‚Äîon July 1, 1999. The system became interoperable with the E-ZPass toll collection system on October 27, 2004, although Richmond Metropolitan Authority owned toll roads‚ÄîBoulevard Bridge, the Downtown Expressway, and the Powhite Parkway (excluding the extension) did not begin accepting E-ZPass until August 3, 2005; E-ZPass integration had been delayed due to damages from Tropical Storm Gaston. Today, the following toll roads exist in the Richmond area, and their tolls can all be paid for using Smart Tag/EZ Pass. *Downtown Expressway in Richmond. *Powhite Parkway and Powhite Parkway Extension in Richmond and Chesterfield County. *Boulevard Bridge (the \\"Nickel Bridge\\", though it costs 35 cents now) in Richmond *Pocahontas Parkway in Chesterfield and Henrico County. Sources for this section: Highways and bridges Manchester Bridge in Downtown Richmond =Interstate highways, expressways= Richmond has an extensive network of Interstate Highways, expressways, and state highways which were built to interstate highway standards. The major east-west route is Interstate 64 (I-64), and the major north-south route is Interstate 95 (I-95). Three-digit Interstates are Interstate 195 (I-195, Beltline Expressway) and Interstate 295 (I-295). Another planned route, Interstate 895 (I-895) is currently signed as State Route 895 and operated as toll road under an innovative public-private partnership. It is also known as the Pocahontas Parkway. The Richmond Metropolitan Authority operates the Downtown Expressway and the Powhite Parkway which are toll roads. State Route 76, a toll road known as the Powhite Parkway Extension, reaches southwest into Chesterfield County between Chippenham Parkway (State Route 150) and State Route 288, the World War II Veterans Memorial Highway. Outer Beltway: a virtual roadway only The Richmond area does not formally have an outer \\"beltway\\", at least no combinations of routing so designated, as some of the other major metropolitan areas nearby do, such as Hampton Roads, and Northern Virginia. However, it has several roads which effectively form major portions of a beltway. Although they do not completely encircle Richmond, these roadways aid in providing alternative routing to circumvent the downtown area for much through traffic as well as offering similar suburb-to-suburb pathways for more local travelers in the greater Richmond-Petersburg metropolitan area. These highways are: *Interstate 295 from I-64 west of Richmond southeasterly to State Route 895 east of Richmond (25 miles) *State Route 288 in the southwest and western areas, between I-95 south of Richmond and I-64 west of the city. (30.7 miles) A full outer beltway loop, approximately 70 miles long, could be designated by combining the preceding major sections with: *State Route 895 (Pocahontas Parkway) toll road (8.8 mi) *an existing 5-mile section of I-95 south of Richmond *an existing 2-mile section of I-64 west of Richmond The only tolls along such a \\"virtual beltway\\" of Richmond would be on the State Route 895 portion, which includes the modern and costly to build high-rise Vietnam Veterans Memorial Bridge over the shipping channel of the navigable portion of the James River below the Port of Richmond. =U.S. highways= Major U.S. highways in the Richmond area: *US 1 north portion is Washington Highway; south portion is Jefferson Davis Highway (concurrent with US 301) *US 33 *US 60 east of Richmond called Williamsburg Road; west of Richmond the road is known as Midlothian Turnpike *US 250 Broad Street and Broad Street Road *US 301 north portion is Chamberlayne Ave and Chamberlyane Road; south portion is Jefferson Davis Highway (concurrent with US 1) *US 360 east of Richmond called Mechanicsville Turnpike; west of Richmond it is known as Hull Street and Hull Street Road =State highways= The Richmond area has state highways and secondary routes, some of which are state-designated Virginia byways. A partial listing of Virginia State Highways include: *State Route 2 (multiplexed with US-301 in Henrico) *State Route 5 (a National Scenic Byway) *State Route 6 (Patterson Avenue) *State Route 10 (Broad Rock Road) *State Route 33 (Nine Mile Road) *State Route 73 (Parham Road) *State Route 76 (Powhite Parkway Extension toll road) *State Route 147 (Cary Street Road, Huguenot road) *State Route 150 (Chippenham Parkway) *State Route 161 (south portion also known as Belt Boulevard) *State Route 195 (short connector) *State Route 197 (Malvern, Westwood, and Laburnum Avenues) *State Route 288 (World War II Veterans Memorial Highway) *State Route 895 (Pocahontas Parkway toll road) =Major bridges= The James River bisects the metropolitan area. It enters from the west, but turns due south at downtown Richmond for about 8 miles, before it turns east again. From the west, the bridges across the James River in the Greater Richmond area are: * World War II Veterans Memorial Bridge (VA-288) * Edward E. Willey Bridge (VA-150) * Huguenot Memorial Bridge (VA-147) * Powhite Parkway Bridge (Powhite Parkway and VA-76) (toll bridge) * CSX A-line railroad bridge (formerly Atlantic Coast Line Railroad) * Boulevard Bridge (VA-161) (toll bridge, restricted weights) * Robert E. Lee Memorial Bridge (US-1 and US-301) * Manchester Bridge (US-60) * Norfolk Southern Railway bridge (formerly Southern Railway) * Mayo Bridge (US-360) * CSX S-line railroad bridge (formerly Seaboard Air Line Railroad) * Interstate 95 James River Bridge (I-95) * Vietnam Veterans Memorial Bridge (Pocahontas Parkway and VA-895) (toll bridge) * Varina-Enon Bridge (I-295) Local public transportation A GRTC Pulse bus in operation in Richmond. = Bus rapid transit = Since 2018, Richmond, Virginia has been served by a bus rapid transit line along the Broad and Main Street corridors. The western terminus is in Willow Lawn, which is located in suburban Henrico County, while the eastern terminus ends in Rocketts Landing, in the eastern part of the city of Richmond. It is the third bus rapid transit line built in Virginia, and the first rapid transit system to serve the city in almost 60 years. =Bus and paratransit systems= Greater Richmond Transit Company (GRTC) is a publicly owned public service company providing public bus service within the Greater Richmond area. It receives principal funding from the Federal Transit Administration, Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation, and local municipalities. However, GRTC is managed, staffed, and operated by a private transit management company; GRTC Transit Services, Inc., the operating company, is a subsidiary of American Transportation Enterprises, and has managed GRTC since 1962.Our History - GRTC Public transportation in Greater Richmond is limited, with GRTC bus routes available only within the city limits and in bordering areas of Henrico and Chesterfield counties. Henrico service runs only on weekdays; service in Chesterfield is limited to two state-funded rush-hour express services only. Hanover County and parts of northern, eastern and western Henrico have no transit service. GRTC also provides express bus service to Petersburg, which connects to Petersburg Area Transit which serves the Tri-Cities area. GRTC's paratransit service in Richmond and Henrico County is provided by the CARE service, which is operated under contract by Laidlaw Transit, Inc. Other private companies offer wheelchair-accessible paratransit service to individuals and small groups. =Rail mass transit= Although no rail mass transit services are currently operational, Richmond has been considering plans for a small streetcar system in the downtown area for several years.Looking anew at streetcars and other downtown transit - Richmond Times Dispatch Presently, an organization known as the Central Virginia Transportation Authority (CVATA) is aiming to bring commuter rail, light rail and a heritage streetcar into the Greater Richmond Region. The main lines would be called Central Virginia Express. =Taxi and airport limousine service= Richmond has numerous taxicab operators, mostly operated as small businesses, River City Transportation, amongst others, provides limousine/SUV/ Car services for individuals and groups between the airport and points in the Richmond area and beyond, including other major airports and cities in Virginia. Intercity bus services Intercity bus service is provided by the following carriers, with its terminal at 2910 N Boulevard: * Greyhound Lines - multiple destinations * New Century Travel - to New York, Washington, Philadelphia * Today's Bus - to New York * Eastern Shuttle - to New York * Apex - to New York (stop located in Henrico County) * megabus.com - express service to Washington D.C., Philadelphia, Hampton, Atlanta, Athens, Baltimore, Charlotte, Columbia, Durham, Fayetteville, Newark and connections to New York. Railroads =Passenger rail= Main Street Station, as seen from I-95. The Richmond area has two railroad stations served by Amtrak. Each station receives regular service from north of Richmond from Washington, DC, Philadelphia, and New York. The suburban Staples Mill Road Station is located on a major north-south freight line and receives all service to and from all points south including, Raleigh, Durham, Savannah, Newport News, Williamsburg and Florida. Richmond's only railway station located within the city limits, the historic Main Street Station, was renovated in 2004.The History of Main Street Station (RMA) As of 2010, the station can only receive trains headed to and from Newport News and Williamsburg due to track layout. As a result, the Staples Mill Road station receives more trains and serves more passengers overall. The Department of Rail and Public Transportation of the State of Virginia has studies underway for introducing improved passenger rail service to the Virginia Peninsula and South Hampton Roads areas. The Transdominion Express would serve a large portion of the south central regions of the state. There are plans to create high-speed rail corridors through the state connecting to both the Northeast Corridor and the Southeast High Speed Rail Corridor. =Freight railroads= Richmond is served by two major Class I railroads, Norfolk Southern (NS) and CSX. The city is also served by the Buckingham Branch Railroad, the state's largest short line railroad. Rail yards in Richmond include NS's Ship Yard and CSX's Fulton Yard. Air Richmond is served by a major commercial airport and several smaller general aviation facilities. Richmond is served by the Richmond International Airport , located in nearby Sandston, seven miles southeast of Richmond and within an hour drive of historic Williamsburg, Virginia, RIC airport is served by seven airlines with non-stop flights to 21 destinations and connecting flights to destinations worldwide. In 2004, the airport served approximately 2.5 million passengers; this count is expected to increase significantly in 2006 due to the presence of low-cost carriers AirTran Airways and JetBlue Airways. Richmond International Airport is not served by public transit, other than a little-used GRTC bus route from downtown that runs only five times per day, during the morning and afternoon rush hour Monday through Friday. As is the case everywhere in Richmond, driving to the airport (either by taxicab or private car) is by far the fastest mode of transportation. RIC is approximately a $15 taxi fare from downtown Richmond. Parking is available in long-term lots for $6 per day, the close-in daily garage for $10 per day, and the hourly garage for $2 per hour (first 60 minutes free). General Aviation service is available at Richmond International and Chesterfield County Airport, located near the intersection of State Routes 10 and 288 near Chesterfield Court House, Virginia, and Hanover County Airport near Ashland. Ports and waterways The Port of Richmond (locally known as Deepwater Terminal) offers deep water connections on the navigable portion for the James River east to Hampton Roads, known as the \\"world's greatest natural harbor\\", which is located only 18 miles from the Atlantic Ocean. Shipping to other points on the Chesapeake Bay is also possible. The extant canals of Richmond are no longer used for shipping. However, several portions downtown are used as part of the Canal Walk, and upstream, portions are used as part of the water systems of the city and counties. A set of locks is located in a small park just east of the downtown area near Tobacco Row.

The 21-storey building was completed in 1957 as the headquarters of Imperial Oil, Canada's largest oil company. The building's design had previously been rejected for a proposed new Toronto City Hall. After several decades of use as the head office of Imperial Oil, the building was sold in 2010 and converted into a condominium apartment building. Description The building sits atop a high escarpment with a commanding view to the south, and before the construction of the downtown banking towers in the late 1960s, the top floor observation deck was, at almost 800 feet (244 metres) above sea level, the highest point in Toronto; on a clear day visitors could see the rising spray from Niagara Falls, across Lake Ontario. The interior layout in its office days was based on the 'core' concept, with most offices having windows and with the various service elements (elevators and meeting rooms) clustered in the center. With its thick walls, relatively small windows, a built-in cafeteria, a location separated from major targets, and large offices that could be converted to wards, the IOB was designed to be used, in the event of nuclear attack, as an alternative hospital. The ground floor lobby features a famous mural, \\"The Story of Oil\\", executed by York Wilson in 1957. Three years in the planning and construction, the two panels of the diptych are each 25 feet by 32 feet; the left-hand side of the mural depicts the nature of oil from its prehistoric origins, while the right-hand panel portrays the modern benefits of its exploitation. The mural is made of vinyl acetate and is mounted to the wall in such a way that vibrations in the building will not be transmitted to the artwork, possibly causing it to crack. In addition, a ventilation system behind the same wall prevents moisture collecting on the material. Crawley Films of Ottawa was engaged to document the artwork's realization. A three-part mural by Oscar Cah√©n was completed in 1956, for the building's staff lounge and dining facility on the eighth floor. These were abstract compositions in bold, bright colours, one with a sun motif. Painted on canvas, two sections were de-installed in 1979 and are now owned by the Robert McLaughlin Gallery in Oshawa, Ontario. As of 2014, they await conservation and a permanent home. The third section was lost. History The architectural model for this building was originally a proposed design for a new Toronto City Hall. However, Nathan Phillips, Toronto's mayor in 1955, rejected the Mathers and Haldenby design for city hall and opened the commission to an international competition that was eventually won by Finnish architect Viljo Revell. Imperial Oil, in search of a design for their Toronto head office, bought the design from Mathers and Haldenby. During construction, catering to the wealthy local residents, welding was used, rather than the then-customary and much noisier riveting technique. The building, on completion, was the largest all-welded steel frame building in the world. When Imperial Oil assembled the residential properties for the site, Isabel Massie, owner of a house at 59 Foxbar Road, on a long angular lot at the rear of the site, refused to sell, despite being offered up to $100,000 for her house, at the time a princely sum. As a result, Imperial Oil had to move its building closer to St. Clair Avenue than planned. Until she died in 1964, her property jutted into the Imperial Oil parking lot, an icon of a citizen's refusal to give in to a corporation. Her heirs sold the house for $70,000 to Imperial Oil, which demolished it to expand the parking lot. The last traces of Isabel Massie's house, roughly across the street from 38 Foxbar Road, were dug up in 2012 when the subsequent owner excavated for an underground parking garage. The Imperial Oil Building from the west, giving a better view of the observation deck at its top Closure As announced in a press conference on September 29, 2004, Imperial Oil re-located to Calgary, Alberta (some corporate operations moved to the Esso Building at 90 Wynford Drive in the Don Mills district). Thereafter, the building was unoccupied for several years. Soil testing before the property was listed for sale found that sand about 40 feet below the eastern part of the parking lot was contaminated with heating oil that had leaked from an underground storage tank. The soil was then excavated and replaced. In preparation for the sale, Imperial Oil told Deer Park United Church next door that they would no longer supply building heat to the church, effective July 2008. This led the dwindling congregation to vacate the church building and share space with a nearby Presbyterian congregation (Calvin Presbyterian Church) which had split off from the original Deer Park congregation in the mid 1920s. The church building remains vacant as of late 2016, but it is slated for incorporation into a new condominium development, named \\"Blue Diamond\\".http://urbantoronto.ca/news/2015/08/previewing-amenites- camrost-felcorps-blue-diamondBlue Diamond website Imperial Plaza The Imperial Oil building was sold in the summer of 2010 to condominium developer Camrost-Felcorp, which then began converting it into a condominium apartment building.Bringing a little Mad Men to St. Clair West At the same time, the church building next door was sold to a related developer, who subsequently sold a major interest to Camrost-Felcorp.

The song first appeared in the movie Walter Wanger's Vogues of 1938, actually released in 1937. Sung there by Virginia Verrill,\\"Virginia Verrill, Unseen Voice Of Hollywood's Singing Stars, 82\\", New York Times, Jan 25, 1999 it was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1937 but lost out to \\"Sweet Leilani\\". The song was immediately a hit in a version recorded by Shep Fields and His Rippling Rhythm Orchestra, considered to have spent fourteen weeks on the charts in 1937, four at #1. (The charts did not actually exist in those days, but reconstructions of what they would have been give those statistics.) A version was also recorded by Jan Garber, which charted at #10.) In 1952, it was included in the Susan Hayward movie, With a Song in My Heart where Jane Froman sang it in a dubbing for Hayward. Patti Page, as well as Frankie Laine and Buck Clayton, had hit versions of the song in 1955. Betty Hutton sang it in Spring Reunion (1957). Frank Sinatra had a hit with the song in 1960 form the album Nice 'n' Easy. The song is also featured in the 1981 film, Body Heat, played at an outdoor summer concert by a big band on stage. In the 1971 novel Summer of '42 by Herman Raucher, the song is prominent in chapter 19. That's when the main character, Hermie, visits Dorothy shortly after she has received the news of her husband's death in World War II. The song clearly was the favorite of Dorothy and her husband, and she dances with Hermie as the phonograph record plays.

The party was founded by Johan Castberg, who led the party until his death in 1926. History The party was a successor to the United Norwegian Workers' Association (Norwegian: De forenede norske Arbeidersamfund, DFNA), a labour organisation associated with the Liberal Party, which due to conflicts with the mother party fielded Johan Castberg as a parliamentary candidate in the 1900 election. Castberg in turn founded a new party, the Labour Democrats in 1906. The party took part in its first election in 1906, and in 1912 and 1915 it won six parliamentary representatives. For most of its history, the party cooperated with the Liberal Party. The party had its strongest support among small-scale farmers and landless agricultural labourers, based in a non-socialist ideology. In 1921 the party changed its name to the Radical People's Party (although its members continued to be referred to as \\"Labour Democrats\\"). The party eventually went into a steady decline. Only in Oppland did the party retain some influence. In the 1918 election, the party was reduced to one representative. At the election in 1936, it fell out of parliament altogether. After the Second World War the party had effectively merged into the Liberal Party, although formally the parties had joint lists in Oppland until 1957. The party was formally dissolved in 1965.

Dolphin (1888-1969) and opened on February 7, 1958, the seven- storey building is located at 1900 Yonge Street above the Davisville subway station. The building is named for former TTC Chairman William C. McBrien who died in June 1954, shortly after the opening of the Yonge Subway. The TTC's Customer Service Centre is located on the ground floor of the building. The building is wide, long and contains of floor space. Its exterior is made of limestone quarried at Queenston, Ontario. The main-floor lobby is lined with light brown Italian marble. The building incorporates an entrance to Davisville subway station located below street level as well as bus bays at ground level. The building design allows for expansion from its current seven storeys to ten storeys. Prior to the opening of the McBrien Building, the TTC head office was in the old Toronto Board of Trade Building (built 1890 and demolished 1958) located at the north-east corner of Yonge and Front streets. This was the TTC's first permanent home since April 1922. The TTC outgrew the old building with its limited floor space, and starting in 1928, the TTC had to acquire space elsewhere. Starting in 1953, functions such as purchasing, safety, research, engineering, among others were moved to the J.G. Inglis Building at the Hillcrest Complex. In 1958, the executive, legal and treasury functions moved to the McBrien Building. Relocation In 2015, the TTC considered relocating from the building due to on going concerns about the state of the building, and for head office staff to be in one location. Earlier plans to relocated to Yonge and York Mills had been rejected due to costs. Besides 1900 Yonge, the TTC leases 7 other locations to house head office staff.

The company is based in Chicago, IL and operates in several U.S. cities. It is owned by Ahold Delhaize, which operates Stop & Shop, Food Lion, Giant- Landover, and other supermarkets, and delivers from that company's stores. It used to deliver from its own Chicago-area and other warehouses in the Midwest until its Midwest operations ceased in early 2020. Peapod online grocery has operations in 24 U.S. urban markets, and as of 2015 was the largest online grocery delivery store in the United States. In October 2017, Peapod Online Grocer (US) announced it was moving its headquarters from suburban Skokie, Illinois to downtown Chicago. Overview A Peapod delivery truck in Chicago Peapod Online Grocer (US) was founded in 1989 by Andrew Parkinson and Thomas Parkinson, both of whom are still executive officers. One early proposal for a name for the new company was IPOD, an acronym for Information and Product On Demand. The brothers, taking marketing considerations into account, decided on the friendlier sounding \\"Peapod\\" instead. Before 1996, Peapod Online Grocer (US) provided an online grocery shopping service in a partnership with Jewel supermarket in Chicago, Illinois and surrounding towns; Kroger in Columbus, Ohio; Randall's in Houston, Texas, and Safeway in San Francisco, California in 1993. In 1996, the company launched its website and became one of the earliest internet start-ups; the company ranked 69th on the Inc. 500 list of fast- growing privately held U.S. companies. That year the company held an IPO on NASDAQ. Between 1997 and 2000, Peapod expanded into Boston and Watertown, Massachusetts, Long Island, New York, and Norwalk, Connecticut in partnership with Stop & Shop. In late 2000, they added Washington, D.C. and surrounding towns through Giant of Landover, and in 2011 they also started serving the Philadelphia market with Giant of Carlisle and Manhattan with Stop & Shop. In June 2000, global grocery corporation Royal Ahold bought 51% of Peapod's shares, and in August 2001, Royal Ahold bought out the entire company. As a result, Peapod cancelled its contracts with all grocery companies except for Royal Ahold's two main American chains, Stop & Shop and Giant Food (Giant- Landover and Giant-Carlisle). This caused Peapod to abandon Columbus, Houston, and San Francisco entirely. In February 2020, Peapod announced they would be ceasing operations in the Midwest (Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin) and focus exclusively on serving the East Coast. However, the headquarters for Peapod Digital Labs, which runs the e-commerce technology for Ahold Delhaize's U.S. grocery brands, will remain in downtown Chicago. Mobile app In February 2012, Peapod introduced signs at some SEPTA Regional Rail stations in Philadelphia which enabled smartphone users to shop for groceries using Peapod's mobile app on their phone and scanning the barcodes of items listed on the signs. The grocery delivery occurs later in the day. Recognition and awards In 2017, Peapod Online Grocer (US) was listed as \\"one of the oldest and most popular online grocery services in the marketplace.\\" The NPD Group's Chief Food Industry Analyst, Harry Balzer, considers Peapod the top online grocery delivery service and believes that could be used as a model for delivery services, such as Amazon and Walmart, if they move into the business of online groceries.

It ran on the NuMachine and had remote procedure call functionality built into its kernel, but was otherwise a Version 7 Unix workalike. Design and implementation On startup, the NuMachine would load the same program on each CPU in the system, passing each instance the numeric ID of the CPU it was running on. TRIX relied on this design to have the first CPU set up global data structures and then set a flag to signal that initialization was complete. After that, each instance of the kernel was able to access global data. The system also supported data private to each CPU. Access to the filesystem was provided by a program in user space. The kernel supported unnamed threads running in domains. A domain was the equivalent of a Unix process without a stack pointer (each thread in a domain had a stack pointer). A thread could change domains, and the system scheduler would migrate threads between CPUs in order to keep all processors busy. Threads had access to a single kind of mutual exclusion primitive, and one of seven priorities. The scheduler was designed to avoid priority inversion. User space programs could create threads through a \`spawn\` system call. A garbage collector would periodically identify and free unused domains. The shared memory model used to coordinate work between the various CPUs caused memory bus contention and was known to be a source of inefficiency. The designers were aware of designs that would have alleviated the contention. Indeed, TRIX's original design used a nonblocking message passing mechanism, but \\"this implementation was found to have deficiencies often overlooked in the literature,\\" including poor performance. Although the TRIX operating system was first implemented on the NuMachine, this was more a result of the availability of the NuMachine at MIT than any characteristic of the architecture. The system was designed to be easily portable. It was implemented largely in C with little assembly code. The mutual exclusion primitive could be ported to any architecture with an atomic test and set instruction. Attempted use by the GNU Project Richard Stallman mentions in the 1985 GNU Manifesto that \\"an initial kernel exists\\" for the GNU operating system, \\"but many more features are needed to emulate Unix.\\" This was a reference to TRIX's kernel, which TRIX's authors had decided to distribute as free software. In a speech in October 1986, Stallman elaborated that \\"the TRIX kernel runs, and it has a certain limited amount of Unix compatibility, but it needs a lot more. Currently it has a file system that uses the same structure on disk as the ancient Unix file system does. This made it easier to debug the thing, because they could set up the files with Unix, and then they could run TRIX, but that file system doesn't have any of the features that I believe are necessary.\\" The features Stallman wished to add (file versioning, undeletion, information on when and how and where the file was backed up on tape, atomic file updates) were not generally associated with Unix. In December 1986, developers used TRIX's kernel as a base in their first attempt to create a kernel for GNU. They eventually decided Trix was unusable as a starting point, primarily because: * it only ran on \\"an obscure, expensive 68000 box\\", and would therefore require porting to other architectures, and * it was decided that the Mach microkernel was a better underlying design for a server-based operating system. This second attempt evolved into the GNU Hurd. See also * GNU Mach * Comparison of kernels References Further reading * Ward, S.A. TRIX: a Network-oriented Operating System.

It has been owned by MyTime Mediahttp://www.mytimemedia.co.uk since 2008. The magazine addressed the emergence of a new hobby ‚Äî the construction of models (often working) and experimental engineering, largely in metal. It transcended class barriers, appealing to professional engineers, jobbing machinists and anyone interested in making working mechanisms. Contributors The magazine has had many notable contributors, but foremost among these was LBSC (pen name of Lillian 'Curly' Lawrence). From the inter-war period to the 1960s he produced many designs for simple but reliable small model steam locomotives. Most of these were published in Model Engineer, and brought the construction of small passenger hauling locomotives within the reach of the typical home machinist. Other notable contributors include Henry Greenly, Edgar T. Westbury, J.N.Maskelyne and one of the most notable editors, Martin Evans. Fifty years later, the editor again has the name Martin Evans but is not of course the same person. Model Engineer Exhibition Model Engineer has had a long- standing association with the Model Engineer Exhibition, originally held at Olympia in London. The exhibition is almost as venerable an institution as the magazine itself, and is notable for the display of some of the finest examples of the hobby. Magazine content The subject matter of the (now fortnightly, earlier weekly) magazine ranges from articles about techniques and tools to profiles of full-size prototypes of modelling subjects. The main content is, however, 'constructional articles' describing projects at various levels of detail. Such articles range from single pages to long-running series in alternate issues, some of which can last for many months, if not years. These more detailed series generally appeal to a wider audience than those engaged in the project. It is often as much in the (often loosely) related anecdotes alongside as in the processes described. Model Engineer today Over the years the magazine has waxed and waned, but is currently enjoying the increased popularity of the hobby engendered by the availability of comparatively cheap machine tools from China and Taiwan. In 1990 it spun off a companion title Model Engineers' Workshop which enjoys similar success but focuses more on workshop techniques and tooling.

Green Brook Flood Control Project The Green Brook Flood Control Project in Somerset County in central New Jersey was first proposed in the early 1970s in the wake of two major floods in June 1971 and August 1973, which caused millions of dollars of property damage and several deaths along the Green Brook and Raritan Rivers. The proposed flood control measures are expected to help control flooding in the Green Brook basin and parts of the Raritan River basin in Bound Brook, partially located in a natural floodplain of the Raritan River at the junction of the Green Brook and Raritan River. The project has languished for decades due to a lack of federal funding and interest. Hurricane Floyd in 1999 caused additional property damage and deaths in the Green Brook basin, renewing interest in the flood control project. Some construction related to the project has been completed since 1999, particularly in Bound Brook, but federal funding limitations have slowed progress in recent years.

In their tenth film, Groucho, Harpo, and Chico head to the American West and attempt to unite a couple by ensuring that a stolen property deed is retrieved. The film was directed by Edward Buzzell and written by Irving Brecher, who receives the original screenplay credit. Plot Confidence man S. Quentin Quale (Groucho) is heading west to find his fortune, but is short ten dollars for a train ticket. In the railroad station, he encounters brothers Joseph (Chico) and Rusty Panello (Harpo) and attempts to swindle their money, but the two manage to swindle Quale's money. The Panellos are friends with an old miner named Dan Wilson (Tully Marshall) whose near worthless property, Dead Man's Gulch, has no gold. They loan him their last ten dollars for a grub stake and he gives them the deed to the Gulch as collateral. Unbeknownst to Wilson, the son of his longtime rival and beau to his granddaughter Eve Wilson (Diana Lewis), Terry Turner (John Carroll) has contacted the railway to arrange for them to build through the gulch, making the deed holder rich.

(In this song, Chico, playing the piano, rolls an orange on the keys in sync with the melody.) As with A Night at the Opera and A Day at the Races, the Marxes played key comedy scenes from Go West live onstage on a pre- filming tour; this tour was much shorter than that for the first two films, lasting three weeks.

Fadem, The Art of Asking: Ask Better Questions, Get Better Answers, FT Press, 2008, , Google Print, p.188) is an informal fallacy. It is committed when someone asks a question that touches upon more than one issue, yet allows only for one answer.Response bias . SuperSurvey, Ipathia Inc.Earl R. Babbie, Lucia Benaquisto, Fundamentals of Social Research, Cengage Learning, 2009, Google Print, p.251Alan Bryman, Emma Bell, Business research methods, Oxford University Press, 2007, , Google Print, p.267-268 This may result in inaccuracies in the attitudes being measured for the question, as the respondent can answer only one of the two questions, and cannot indicate which one is being answered.Ranjit Kumar, Research methodology: a step-by-step guide for beginners, SAGE, 2005, , Google Print, p.136-137 Many double-barreled questions can be detected by the existence of the grammatical conjunction \\"and\\" in them. This is not a foolproof test, as the word \\"and\\" can exist in properly constructed questions. A question asking about three items is known as \\"trible (triple, treble)-barreled\\". In legal proceedings, a double-barreled question is called a compound question.\\"compound question, definition\\". Legal- dictionary.thefreedictionary.com. http://legal- dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/compound+question. Retrieved 2010-02-03. Examples An example of a double-barreled question would be the following: \\"do you think that students should have more classes about history and culture?\\" This question asks about two different issues: \\"do you think that students should have more classes about history\\" and \\"do you think that students should have more classes about culture?\\" Combining both questions into one makes it unclear what exactly is being measured, and as each question may elicit a different response if asked separately there is an increased likelihood of confusing the respondents. In other words, while some respondents would answer \\"yes\\" to both and some \\"no\\" to both, some would like to answer both \\"yes and no\\". Other examples of double-barreled questions: * \\"Please agree or disagree with the following statement: Cars should be faster and safer.\\" * \\"How satisfied are you with your pay and job conditions?\\" * \\"How often and how much time do you spend on each visit to a hospital?\\" * \\"Does your department have a special recruitment policy for men and women?\\" * \\"Do you think that there is a good market for the product and that it will sell well?\\" * \\"Should the government spend less money on the military and more on education?\\" * \\"Is this tool interesting and useful?\\" The same considerations apply to questions with fixed choice answers, as an answer can also be double- barreled. For example, if a question asks, \\"What motivates you to work?\\" an answer \\"Pleasant work and nice co-workers\\" is double-barreled. Buttering-up is a type of a double-barreled question. It happens when one of the questions is a question that the questioned person will want to answer \\"yes\\" to, and another that the questioner hopes will be answered with the same \\"yes\\". For example, \\"Would you be a nice guy and lend me five bucks?\\" Some questions may not be double-barreled but confusingly similar enough to a double-barreled question to result in similar issues. For example, the question \\"Should the organization reduce paperwork required of employees by hiring more administrators?\\" can be interpreted as composed of two questions: \\"Should the organization reduce paperwork required of employees?\\" and \\"Should the organization hire more administrators?\\" Double-barreled questions have been asked by professionals, resulting in notable skewed media reports and research pieces. For example, Harris Poll used double-barreled questions in the 1980s, investigating the US public opinion on Libya‚ÄìUnited States relations, and American attitudes toward Mikhail Gorbachev.Earl R. Babbie, The Practice of Social Research', Cengage Learning, 2009, , Google Print, p. 258 U.S. trial usage In a legal trial, a compound question may raise an objection,Charles Gibbons, A Student's Guide to Trial Objections (2015), p. 37. as the witness may be unable to provide a clear answer to the inquiry. One guide to trial practice offers the following example of a compound question:Roger Park, David P. Leonard, Steven H. Goldberg, Evidence Law: A Student's Guide to the Law of Evidence as Applied in American Trials (2011), pp. 80‚Äì81. > Cross-examiner: As you approached the intersection, did you look down, > change the radio station, and then look up and for the first time notice the > oncoming car? Opponent: Objection, compound question. An example in practice has been cited in the case of Weise v. Rainville (1959) 173 CA2d 496, 506, where the objection to such a question was sustained because such a question \\"raises the danger that the witness does not intend to reply to both questions\\" when answering \\"yes\\" to the compound question.Tamarah Haet, Nancy Yuenger, California Trial Objections 2015 (2015), ¬ß8, \\"Question Is Compound\\", pp. 113‚Äì114. It may also be unclear to the court, jurors, or appellate bodies, what the witness intended in answering the question; and such a question may combine a request for relevant information with a request for information that is irrelevant or inadmissible. If the question is one for which the answer will not be harmful to the opposing attorney's case, then the attorney need not object at all; alternatively, the opposing attorney may object, and specify when objecting that he would not object to a rephrasing of the question into separate, non-compound parts. Compound questions are most frequently asked during cross-examination.Thomas A. Mauet, Trials: Strategy, Skills, and the New Power of Persuasion (2005), p. 553.

It is part of the Skai Group, one of the largest media groups in the country. It was relaunched in its present form on 1 April 2006 in the Athens metropolitan area, and gradually spread its coverage nationwide. Besides digital terrestrial transmission, it is available on the subscription-based encrypted services of Nova and Cosmote TV. Skai TV is also a member of Digea, a consortium of private television networks introducing digital terrestrial transmission in Greece. At launch, Skai TV opted for dubbing all foreign language content into Greek, instead of using subtitles. This is very uncommon in Greece for anything except documentaries (using voiceover dubbing) and children's programs (using lip-synced dubbing), so after intense criticism, the station switched to using subtitles for almost all foreign shows. History Skai TV was first launched on 21 September 1993 with an emphasis on news and sports. However, on 26 September 1999, it was sold and the new owners gradually rebranded it as Alpha TV. The new station had an entirely different programming perspective and opted for a more mainstream profile, soon managing to become one of the top three TV stations in Greece. On 1 April 2006, the company that originally launched Skai TV bought Seven TV, a holder of a Greek National broadcasting license that failed to expand its coverage all over the country or attract a wide audience. The station was renamed to 'Skai TV' allowing the brand to re-emerge on the Greek television scene after 7 years, but this time the owners decided to forgo their previous approach and opted for high-quality foreign shows and valid news coverage. On 6 September 2007, Skai TV was added to the lineup of NOVA Greece digital platform. On 2 March 2016, Skai TV launched its own high-definition feed. On 2 September, the network won one of four national television licenses auctioned in Greece after Iannis Alafouzos paid ‚Ç¨43.6 million in a highly unusual competitive bidding process. Criticism Original Skai TV was heavily criticized for its \\"yellow press\\" news coverage and low-budget programming. In an incident still remembered by Greek viewers and later investigated by a Channel 4 documentary, the station was unanimously slated for its involvement (and live coverage) of a hostage situation that ended with the death of the victim. Skai TV has been ferociously criticized by Greek socialists for allegedly promoting right-wing politics, liberal and pro-EU politics in its news reporting and political commentary, and for being essentially the mouthpiece of big business in Greece. It has also been roundly criticized by some Greek conservative commentators for its political documentaries. Technology Skai TV has made a pioneering appearance in international airwaves, being the first non- subscription TV station worldwide to use solely digital technology thus being completely tapeless. It uses the SONAPS network broadcast system made by Sony and installed by British company VSC Design. The system is considered by the former as a showcase example of the system. Skai also uses Harmonic Spectrum servers for Playout together with IBIS automation. Skai TV is also the first station in Greece to broadcast its full programme in 16:9 format. Programming Skai TV airs a diverse programming mix with a focus on entertainment and information. Programming includes comedies, dramas, current affairs shows, documentaries, and sports. Foreign programs originally made up the bulk of Skai TV's schedule but in recent years it has begun producing an increasing amount of original programs which now comprise a third of the schedule. It has programming alliances with popular foreign networks including National Geographic, Discovery Channel and the BBC and a large part of its schedule features recent and past-years documentaries. There is also a Greek dubbed BBC World News news bulletin following the station's own news bulletin and a news-themed morning show. Skai TV also shows some friendly matches of Panathinaikos FC when these friendlies are not on any of the Premium Services (Either Cosmote Sport or Nova Sports). =Greek= Current shows include: *Simera (Today) - Daily morning show, hosted by Dimitris Oikonomou and Maria Anastasopoulou. *Atairiastoi (Unmatched) - Daily show, hosted by Giannis Ntsounos and Christos Koutras. *Mesimeri me ton Giorgo Liagka (Noon with Giorgos Liagkas) - hosted by Giorgos Liagkas. *Kalo Mesimeraki (Good lunch) - hosted by Nikos Moutsinas. *Oi eidiseis tou SKAI stis 2 - (ŒîŒµŒªœÑŒØŒø ŒïŒπŒ¥ŒÆœÉŒµœâŒΩ œÑŒøœÖ Œ£ŒöŒëŒô œÉœÑŒπœÇ 14.00).

A 160-bit SHA-1 hash of the data (called score by Venti) acts as the address of the data. This enforces a write-once policy since no other data block can be found with the same address: the addresses of multiple writes of the same data are identical, so duplicate data is easily identified and the data block is stored only once. Data blocks cannot be removed, making it ideal for permanent or backup storage. Venti is typically used with Fossil to provide a file system with permanent snapshots.  History Venti was designed and implemented by Sean Quinlan and Sean Dorward at Bell Labs. It appeared in the Plan 9 distribution in 2002. Development has been continued by Russ Cox who has reimplemented most of the server, written a library for creating datastructures (files, directories and meta-data) to store in Venti and implemented optimizations. Venti is available both in the Plan 9 distribution and for many UNIX-like operating systemsSuch as Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, SunOS or Mac OS X as part of Plan 9 from User Space. Venti is included as part of Inferno with accompanying modules for access. There is a Go set of programs to build your own Venti servers. Included are examples using different kinds of backend storage.  Details  Venti is a user space daemon.Lukkien, Mechiel. Venti Analysis and Memventi Implementation. Thesis. University of Twente, 2007. N.p.: n.p., n.d. University of Twente Theses Repository. Web. 13 Oct. 2014. . Clients connect to Venti over TCP and communicate using a simple RPC-protocol. The most important messages of the protocol are listed below. Note that there is no message to delete an address or modify data at a given address. * read(score, type), returns the data identified by score and type * write(data, type), stores data at the address calculated by SHA-1 hashing data, combined with type. The data block stored by Venti must be greater than 512 bytes in length and smaller than 56 kilobytes. So, if a Venti user/client wants to store larger data blocks, it has to make a datastructure (which can be stored in Venti). For example, Fossil uses hash trees to store large files. Venti itself is not concerned with the contents of a data block; it does however store the type of a data block. The design of Venti has the following consequences: * Since writes are permanent, the file system is append-only (which allows for a simple implementation with lower chance of data-destroying bugs); no file system fragmentation occurs. * Clients can verify the correctness of the server: the score of the returned data should be the same as the address requested. Since SHA-1 is a cryptographically secure hash, it is computationally infeasible to fabricate data. * Data cannot be overwritten. If an address is already present, the data is already present. * There is little need for user authentication: Data cannot be deleted, and can be read only if the score is known. The only potential problem is a user filling up the disks. * Data can be compressed without making the disk structure complicated. The data blocks are stored on hard drives. The disks making up the available storage, typically a RAID, is called the data log. This data log is split up in smaller pieces called arenas, which are sized so they can be written to other media such as CD/DVD or magnetic tape. Another set of hard drives is used for the index, which maps scores to addresses in the data log. The data structure used for the index is a hash table with fixed-sized buckets. Venti relies on the scores to be randomly distributed so buckets do not fill up. Since each lookup costs one disk seek time, an index usually consists of multiple hard drives with low access time.  Usage  The Venti server may be used by clients in several ways. The Plan 9 operating system makes use of Venti for daily archival snapshots of the file system. These copies of the main filesystem can be mounted as a filetree of full copies organized by date. The utility programs 'vac' and 'unvac' can be used to store and retrieve data from a Venti server in the form of individual files or as a directory and its contents. 'Vacfs' allows browsing of the data associated with a vac score without full retrieval of all remotely stored data. Data and index scores can be duplicated between Venti servers using 'rdarena' and 'wrarena'. Plan 9 from Bell Labs, Plan 9 from User Space, Inferno and any other clients that implement the Venti protocol can all be used interchangeably to store and retrieve data.  Hash collisions A basic principle of information theory is the pigeonhole principle, which states that if set A contains more values than set B, then for any function that maps A to B there will be members of B that are associated with more than one member of set A. In the case of Venti, the set of possible SHA-1 hashes is obviously smaller than the set of all possible blocks that could be stored in the filesystem, and thus a hash collision is possible. The risk of accidental hash collision in a 160-bit hash is very small, even for exabytes of data. Historically, however, many hash functions become increasingly vulnerable to malicious hash collisions due to both cryptographic and computational advances.\\"HASH COLLISION Q&A.;\\" Cryptography Research. Rambus, n.d. Web. 12 Jan. 2010. . Venti does not address the issue of hash collisions; as of this time, it is still computationally infeasible to find collisions in SHA-1, but it may become necessary for Venti to switch to a different hash function at some point in the future. On , Google announced the SHAttered attack, in which they generated two different PDF files with the same SHA-1 hash in roughly 263.1 SHA-1 evaluations.

He also finished third in the state in the 400 metres competition. College career Dantzler accepted a football scholarship from Clemson University, where he majored in Marketing. As a redshirt freshman in 1998 season, he made his first start as a quarterback in week 5 against the University of North Carolina. In 1999, he replaced injured starter Brandon Streeter in the fourth game against the University of North Carolina, helping the team win 31‚Äì20, with a 56-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter. He would remain as the starter for the rest of the season. Against the University of Maryland, he broke Bobby Gage's single game total offense school record, making 16 of 23 completions for 252 yards and 22 carries for 183 yards and one touchdown for a total of 435 yards. He posted 112-of-201 completions for 1,506 passing yards, 9 passing touchdowns, 6 interceptions, 723 rushing yards and 4 rushing touchdowns. In 2000, he changed his number from 11 to 1, helping his team to a 9‚Äì3 record. Against the University of Virginia, he set an ACC rushing record by a quarterback, making runs of 75 and 45 yards, for a total of 220-yard rushing yards. He would have 4 straight games of 100 yards rushing and 300 yards of total offense, a first in NCAA history. He was on pace to become the first player in college football history to throw for 2,000 yards and run for 1,000 yards in one season until being slowed down by a left ankle injury. Against the University of South Carolina, he completed a touchdown pass to Rod Gardner for a 16-14 win. He finished with 137-of-244 completions for 1,871 passing yards, 11 passing touchdowns, 7 interceptions, 1,028 rushing yards (ACC quarterback record) and 13 rushing touchdowns. Of those stats, 956 passing yards along with 6 touchdowns went to Gardner, who was selected in the first round of the 2001 NFL Draft (15th overall). In 2001, Dantzler rushed for 1,075 yards and 13 touchdowns. He became the first player in NCAA football history to pass for more than 2,000 yards and rush for more than 1,000 in a single season, and only the third player in NCAA history to pass for more than 5,000 yards and rush for more than 2,500 yards in his career. Against The Citadel, he set school records for completion percentage and passing efficiency, by completing 16 of 17 passes. Against ninth-ranked Georgia Tech, he contributed to a 47-44 upset, rushing for 164 yards while passing for 254 yards and scoring the game-winning touchdown in overtime with an 11-yard run. Against North Carolina State University, he tallied 517 yards of total offense (fifth-best in ACC history), completing 23 of 27 passes for 333 yards. In the season he registered 188-of-311 completions for 2,360 passing yards, 17 passing touchdowns, 11 interceptions, 206 carries for 1,004 rushing yards and 10 rushing touchdowns. Dantzler finished his college career completing 445-of-773 passes for 5,819 yards, 37 touchdowns and 24 interceptions while rushing for 2,704 yards and 27 touchdowns on 576 carries. He held 53 school records, including being the All-time passing yards leader (5,819) and touchdown passer (37). In 2007, he was inducted into the Clemson Athletic Hall of Fame.

He was born in New Orleans, and was of mixed English and French descent; his father was an English merchant who settled in New Orleans and married a Creole woman. His father built on the boy's natural mechanical talent, sending him to Europe to be educated in engineering and the mechanical arts. He returned to New Orleans and eventually succeeded to his father's business of compressing cotton for shipment abroad. Under his direction, the Freret Cotton Press Company became the first large industrial firm in New Orleans, and propelled him to public visibility and a political career. Despite his mixed European heritage, he joined the Native American Party, a new political group that sought to limit the influence on public affairs of Creoles and other groups viewed as \\"foreign.\\" Under its banner he won the 1840 mayoral election, with 1,051 votes to the 942 of his predecessor Charles Genois. His meticulous temperament made him one of the most efficient mayors in New Orleans' history; he was a hands-on administrator notorious for his surprise inspections of city facilities, for example. His term was marked by the continuation of the city's recovery from the combined effects of the borrowing and spending of previous mayors and the nationwide economic crisis of 1837; and hampered by the curious administration he inherited, in which the city was divided into three autonomous -- and often acrimoniously competing -- \\"Municipalities\\". Despite these difficulties, he succeeded in establishing a free public school system and obtaining backing for it at the state level. This is considered to be his greatest achievement. At the expiration of his term he ran for re-election but lost to Denis Prieur, a former mayor; who, however, was mayor for only eight months, resigning to take a state office. Freret was elected, this time as a Whig, to serve the remainder of Prieur's term. He ran for a third term in the elections of 1844; but they seem to have been marked by widespread fraud. In any case, he lost to Joseph Edgard Montegut. In 1850, he was appointed Collector of the Port of New Orleans by President Zachary Taylor. William Freret's remains were interred in New Orleans' St. Patrick Cemetery. The city's Freret Street was named for him. \\"The Rebirth of Freret Street,\\" by Ian McNulty in Gambit, August 9, 2011; accessed 19 April 2015.

As Chief Justice of Common Pleas, an office he held with distinction from 1829 to 1846, he was responsible for the inception of the special verdict \\"Not Guilty by reason of insanity\\" at the trial of Daniel M'Naghten. Judge Tindal was born in the Moulsham area of Chelmsford, where 199 Moulsham Street is today, and the site is marked with a commemorative plaque. Background Tindal's father, Robert Tindal, was an attorney in Chelmsford, where his family had lived at Coval Hall for three generations. His great-grandfather, Nicolas Tindal, was the translator and continuer of the History of England by Paul de Rapin ‚Äì a seminal work in its day ‚Äì and he was also the great great grandnephew of Matthew Tindal, the deist and author of Christianity as Old as the Creation (known as the 'deist's bible') and descendant of Thomas Clifford, 1st Baron Clifford of Chudleigh. Nicholas's branch of the Tindal family were descended from John Tindal, Rector of Bere Ferris in Devon during the Commonwealth of England and who has been claimed as the son either of Dean Tyndall or of (his father) John Tyndall, both of Mapplestead, Essex. John Nichols, in the 18th century, set out a genealogy maintaining that the family derived from Baron Adam de Tyndale of Langley Castle, Northumberland, a tenant-in-chief of Henry II,Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century ed. Colin Clair) (Sussex: Centaur Press, 1967, p. 303 though this has been challenged By Robert Edmond Chester Waters, who asserts that 'The Parentage of John Tindal of Beer Ferris, the founder of this family, is wholly unknown, but it is impossible that he belonged to the Tyndalls of Maplestead‚Äô. \\"Genealogical memoirs of the Extinct Family of Chester of Chicheley, Their Ancestors and Descendants\\" London: Robson and Son, 1878, p. 289 Through this line, Tindal would have been collaterally descended from William Tyndale, translator of the bible. Tindal was descended from a number of great legal figures, all of whom were members of Lincoln's Inn. John Fortescue, was a great medieval jurist and Lord Chancellor of Henry VI of England; William Yelverton was an earlier Lord Chief Justice of England; Roger Manwood was an Elizabethan Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer; and his nephew, John Manwood, Nicholas's great great great grandfather, was the author of 'the Forest Laws'. (See also Tyndall.) Career Tindal was educated at King Edward VI Grammar School in his home town of Chelmsford, and later at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated eighth Wrangler in 1799 and was elected fellow in 1801. A statue to him stands in his home town, and a house at his old school is now dedicated to his memory. Called to the Bar in Lincoln's Inn in 1810 (having practised as a Special Pleader for many years, as was then customary), Tindal soon attained a reputation for his learning. In 1818, as counsel in the appeal of Ashford v Thornton, he successfully arguing that Thornton was entitled to trial by battle. It does not appear that his success in the law was followed by success in the battlefield for his client, however, who was deprived of the opportunity by his accuser's unwillingness and a change in the law. Elected Tory Member of Parliament (MP) for the Scottish constituency of Wigtown Burghs from 1824 to 1826; he was MP for Harwich in 1826 before serving as the Member for Cambridge University in 1827. Tindal served as Solicitor General from 1826‚Äì1829, when he was appointed to the bench. An example of Tindal's learning can be found in his speech to the House of Commons in 1826 on a motion to allow counsel to the defence to make a closing speech. Although his conclusion would find little favour today, Tindal demonstrated an appreciation of the role of prosecuting counsel as a minister of justice and the influences of counsel on a jury that would be recognised by any criminal practitioner in the 21st century. Almost as an afterthought, Tindal added a passionate defence of the 'anomalies' of English law that, in his opinion and that of so many others before and since, are its greatest attributes. At the Bench, Tindal's greatest achievement was to reform significantly the application of the criminal law. By introducing to the common law the special verdict of \\"Not Guilty by reason of insanity\\" and of the defence (to murder) of provocation, he left a legacy that remains to this day. Daniel M'Naghten had assassinated Edward Drummond, secretary to Robert Peel (then Prime Minister), but there was no doubt that he was seriously mentally ill and he was acquitted in a verdict so sensational that Queen Victoria herself called for him to be retried in the House of Lords. Whilst this undoubtedly offended the principle of double jeopardy, the House called upon a panel of judges, headed by Tindal, to advise them on the course to take where defendants committed crimes whilst insane. This advice, leading to the special verdict, remains the foundation of the law of insanity throughout the English common law world. Shire Hall at Monmouth commemorating a famous Chartist trial Statue of Nicolas Tindal, Tindal Square Chelmsford. He directed the jury in the case of the Bristol riots on the rejection of the reform bill in 1831 with the duties at common law to suppress tumultuary meetings.Carrington and Payne, Reports, V, 556 noteSources of English Constitutional History, Stephenson & Marcham, s134 In the case of Regina v Hale, Tindal ruled that, where a defendant was provoked to such a degree that any reasonable man would lose his self-control and then killed the person responsible for that provocation, the defendant would be guilty only of manslaughter. This judgment has also stood the test of time and is the basis of the common law defence of provocation and was incorporated into section 3 of the Homicide Act 1957. The significance of these judgments was to remove the spectre of the noose from many vulnerable prisoners in an era of the widespread application of the death penalty; and to reform the law through the greater recognition of the importance of differing states of mind (mens rea) in those accused of the most serious crimes. In the context of the century that produced William Wilberforce, the Earl of Shaftesbury and Benjamin Disraeli, Tindal's reforms to the cruel application of the criminal law deserve to be remembered as social reforms of great importance. Towards the end of his career, Tindal yet again demonstrated the quality that was to lead to his great popularity amongst the public;The Gentleman's Magazine, Vol.XXVI (1846) p.199 namely, his high standard of judicial independence from the state and the wide ambit and discretion he would give to juries. In the case of Frost (1839‚Äì40), a prisoner had escaped and led 5,000 armed men into Newport, where they shot at regular troops. Directing the jury to consider charges of treason, Tindal said that, were Frost's motives only to free local Chartists from jail, as opposed to intimidating Parliament into enacting radical constitutional reform, they should find him guilty of riot only.Greenwood, Frank Canadian State Trials (Barry Wright, 2002) Whilst Frost was ultimately convicted, Tindal's direction differed from the legal practice of many of his brother judges at the time and since. Marriage and family Memorial to Nicolas Tindal at Chelmsford Cathedral Tindal married Merelina, daughter of Capt. Thomas Symonds, in 1809 and had four children, Vice Admiral Louis Symonds Tindal (father of composer Adela Maddison), Rev Nicholas Tindal (Rector of Chelmsford) (whose daughter Adela-Rose-Ellen married Surgeon General Sir James Mouat VC CBBurke's Landed Gentry (1863): 'Tindal of Chelmsford'.), Charles Tindal and Merelina Tindal (who married James Whatman Bosanquet of Claysmore and amongst whose descendants was the broadcaster Reginald Bosanquet). He died 6 July 1846 in Folkestone; is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery in north London, and is commemorated by a plaque inside Chelmsford Cathedral (alongside memorials to other members of his family).

The word derives from the Greek verb (temn≈ç), \\"I cut\\"..Cf. The earliest attested form of the word is the Mycenaean Greek , te- me-no, written in Linear B syllabic script. The Latin equivalent was the fanum. The concept of temenos arose in classical antiquity as an area reserved for worship of the gods. Some authors have used the term to apply to a sacred grove of trees,David S. Whitley, Reader in Archaeological Theory: Post- processual and Cognitive Approaches, 1998, Routledge, 347 pages isolated from everyday living spaces, while other usage points to areas within ancient urban development that are parts of sanctuaries.Carla M. Antonaccio. An Archaeology of Ancestors: Tomb Cult and Hero Cult in Early Greece. Rowman & Littlefield, 1995. A temenos is often physically marked by a peribolos fence or wall (e.g. Delphi) as a structural boundary. Originally the peribolos was often just a set of marker stones demarcating the boundary, or a light fence, and the earliest sanctuaries appear to have begun as a peribolos around a sacred grove, spring, cave or other feature, with an altar but no temple or cult image. But as Greek sanctuaries became more elaborate large stone walls with gateways or gatehouses were built around important sanctuaries, though the most famous, the Athens Acropolis, was a palace and military citadel turned into a sanctuary. A temenos enclosed a sacred space called a hieron; all things inside of this area belonged to the god. Greeks could find asylum within a sanctuary and be under the protection of the deity and could not be moved against their will. A large example of a Bronze Age Minoan temenos is at the Juktas Sanctuary of the palace of Knossos on ancient Crete in present-day Greece, the temple having a massive northern temenos.C. Michael Hogan, Knossos fieldnotes, Modern Antiquarian (2007) Another example is at Olympia, the temenos of Zeus. There were many temene of Apollo, as he was the patron god of settlers. In religious discourse in English, temenos has also come to refer to a territory, plane, receptacle or field of deity or divinity. C. G. Jung relates the temenos to the spellbinding or magic circle, which acts as a 'square space' or 'safe spot' where mental 'work' can take place. This temenos resembles among others a 'symmetrical rose garden with a fountain in the middle' (the 'squared circle') in which an encounter with the unconscious can be had and where these unconscious contents can safely be brought into the light of consciousness. In this manner one can meet one's own Shadow, Animus/Anima, Wise Old Wo/Man (Senex) and finally the Self, names that Jung gave to archetypal personifications of (unpersonal) unconscious contents which seem to span all cultures.Jung, C.G.

In 2016 some pupils of The Coseley School, which had closed, transferred to Dormston School. History Dormston School was established in 1935. The original site consisted of a single two-storey building that contained 19 classrooms as well as a dining hall, gymnasium, assembly hall and library. This building remains in existence to this day, although substantial alterations have taken place since the mid 1990s and several completely new buildings have been added since the late 1960s. The school was built by Sedgley Urban District council, but since 1966 has existed within the Borough of Dudley In July 1996, the National Lottery granted the Dormston School ¬£4 million to build the Arts and Sports Center, which was completed nearly four years later. It includes a theatre, sports hall, art gallery and gymnasium. In 2000, Dormston School was credited with the Charter Mark in recognition of its services to the pupils and the local community. The school's current head teacher is Stephen Dixon, who was appointed in September 2018.

School buildings The school had originally been housed in what is now A Block. This held classrooms, offices, a library, assembly hall and gymnasium. Art, Science (B Block) and Technology (C Block) blocks were added in the late 1960s and early 1970s. These were expanded in the early 1990s. A fourth block, housing music, drama, dance and English classrooms (D Block) was built in 1990/91, followed shortly afterwards by three Modern Languages classrooms, two mobile classrooms (removed by 2015) and two Art rooms. These expansions took place to accommodate the extra pupils following the local authority's decision to lower the secondary school starting age from 12 to 11, as well as an increase in the school's capacity to hold more than 1,100 pupils. It had provided capacity for some 700 pupils during its days as a 12-16 school. That figure had risen to more than 900 when the age of admissions was reduced, but high demand for places saw it increased beyond 1,000 by the mid 1990s. Two science laboratories were opened in the autumn of 2003, as was a Sixth Form Centre (owned by Dudley College) in September 1996. The sixth form block was demolished in about 2007 and transferred to the mobile classrooms which had been erected more than a decade earlier. An additional block was completed in 2017 and originally housed 5 new Modern Foreign Languages classrooms (Block F). These have now been moved to Block A and F block houses history and Religious education classrooms. =Dormston Centre= The Dormston Centre includes a sports hall, fitness centre, art gallery, theatre and cafe. It cost nearly ¬£6 million to build, ¬£4 million of which was provided by a grant from the National Lottery. Around a decade after it was first planned, the go-ahead for the centre was finally given in July 1996 when the Lottery grant was given, and the facilities were in use by March 2000 - six months behind schedule. The official opening took place on 1 December 2000. Two years later, the Dudley News criticised the project as a \\"failure\\" as few people in the local area were making use of it. The school has put on pupil productions of plays and musical theatre at the theatre in the Dormston Centre. On 5 March 2009 the Dormston Centre hosted an edition of the BBC's Question Time. Pupils suspended over short skirts In March 1999, the school made the headlines when 41 girls were either sent home, made to put on baggy trousers or isolated from lessons for wearing excessively short skirts as part of a local crackdown on 'sexily dressed' school pupils. 21 female pupils aged from 11 to 16 were suspended and the rest segregated away from the other pupils.

Consisting of a large collection of farms close to the towns of Dietrich and Paul, it is situated in a remote region of southern Idaho, approximately 150 miles from the border with Utah. Due to the size and geographical remoteness of the area, long car and bus rides are commonly required for residents to get to school and other activities. It is therefore not uncommon for the populace to spend a great deal of time on the road. Climate The climate in the Hidden Valley region can at times be extreme. Getting snowed-in during winter is not uncommon and in emergencies snowmobiles and occasionally helicopters are needed. In contrast, droughts can also be a problem in Hidden Valley. These can have disastrous consequences for agriculture, though most farmers have deep wells and can dig deeper to gain water from the Snake River aquifer to water their crops. Many farms are bordering on sagebrush, and can have fires. On occasion, farms are burned. A fire in 2000 killed many cattle grazing near it and destroyed some of the grain fields and pivots. Community The majority of people who work in Hidden Valley have a postal address from Paul. Many also have religious and school ties to Paul, as well as to Dietrich and other nearby towns. Everyone that lives there is employed in agriculture with the chief commercial crops being hay, sugar beet and potatoes. In addition to these, corn, wheat, and barley are also grown. There are also some Dairy farmers in the region, along with a minority of inhabitants who work in municipal-type jobs. The farm owners are some of the few people who live there permanently. They are in direct contrast with the many seasonal migrant workers from Mexico who perform jobs such as operating sprinkler pipes in the summer before returning to Mexico in the winter after harvest.

Manufacturing of Brantly-designed helicopters is now carried out by Qingdao Haili Helicopters of China.Qingdao Haili Helicopter Co. History A Brantly B.2 on display at the Flugausstellung Hermeskeil =Brantly Helicopter= The company started out 1945 as Brantly Helicopter Corporation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, founded by Newby O. Brantly. Brantly was so impressed with the Sikorsky VS-300 that he decided to design his own helicopter.The Brantly Helicopter by Kristen Hynes In 1946 his first helicopter, the Brantly B-1 with coaxial rotors made its first flight. The B-1 was not put into production. Using lessons learned from the B-1, he decided to build a two-seater with a simple rotor design. This helicopter, the Brantly B-2, made its first flight 1953. In 1957 the company moved to Frederick, Oklahoma, where the B-2 was certified in 1959. He later designed the Brantly 305, a five-seater which made its first flight 1964. It was certified by the FAA in 1965, the same year it entered production. A Brantly 305 at Kidlington Airport Lear Jet acquired the Brantly Helicopter Corporation in 1966; at this time the factory in Frederick, Oklahoma had 100 employees. The factory moved to Wichita, Kansas in 1969. Aeronautical Research & Development Corporation (ARDC) bought all the rights to Brantly helicopters from Lear Jet in 1969, but they ended operations in early 1970. =Brantly-Hynes= In 1972, the rights were acquired as Brantly Operators Inc. by Michael K. Hynes. He renamed the company in 1975 as Brantly- Hynes Helicopter Inc. Later that year, the Franklin Capital Corp, headed by F. Lee Bailey who also owned Enstrom Helicopter Corporation at that time, purchased the company. Brantly-Hynes originally were just providing product support but later placed the B-2 and 305 back into production. =Brantly International= The new factory in Vernon was built 1989 by Japanese-American businessman James T. Kimura, who renamed the company as Brantly International. In 1994, the ownership was transferred to a Beijing-based company, FESCO. In 1996, they achieved an FAA production certificate. In 2007, Cheng Shenzong, referred to as the \\"helicopter king\\" in China, acquired a major interest in the company, and a joint venture between Brantly International Inc, Qingdao Wenquan International Aviation Investment Co., Ltd, and Qingdao Brantly Investment Consultation Co., Ltd. was established. The factory at the Wilbarger County Airport closed at the end of 2010, and engineering and administrative offices of Brantly moved to Coppell, Texas. Not many helicopters were sold in the last years of manufacturing in Texas.

The film was released in Australia on 15 August 1991. It was chosen as \\"Best Film\\" at the 1991 Australian Film Institute Awards, along with 5 other awards, including Moorhouse for Best Director, Weaving for Best Leading Actor, and Crowe for Best Supporting Actor. Plot The story concerns the tribulations of Martin (Hugo Weaving), a blind photographer. Through a series of flashbacks, Martin is shown as a child, distrustful of his own mother. She describes to him the garden outside his bedroom window. She tells him that someone is raking leaves, but he can't hear the sound and angrily decides she is lying to him. This childhood experience strongly affects Martin as an adult, as he anticipates that sighted people will take advantage of his blindness to lie to him, or worse yet, pity him. He has become a resentful, vaguely bitter person who spends his days taking some photographs of the world around him, then having various people describe them. He uses these photographs and the Braille descriptions before he stamps on them as \\"proof\\" that the world around him really is as others describe it to him. He also takes secret pleasure in rebuking the romantic advances of Celia (Genevi√®ve Picot), his housekeeper. Celia harbors a deep-seated and possibly obsessive crush on Martin, as evidenced by the scores of photographs of him adorning the walls of her flat, and takes out her frustration at her unrequited love by tormenting Martin in small ways, such as rearranging the furniture in his house. Martin keeps Celia around because her love and hatred of him means he knows she can't pity him. One day Martin encounters Andy (Russell Crowe), and is pleased with the depth and detail with which Andy describes his photos. The two fast become close friends, and Martin soon comes to trust him implicitly. The jealous Celia is threatened by Andy's increasing presence in Martin's life. She seduces Andy, and Martin catches the two in the act, before Andy reluctantly lies to him about it. Celia recognizes this opportunity to foil Martin yet again, and sets up a series of events leading Martin to discover Andy's dishonesty. Martin is devastated and plunged into a deep despair, and breaks off his friendship with Andy. Later on, Andy confronts him, and tries to convince him that everyone has flaws, and shouldn't be judged on such simple terms. \\"People lie,\\" he tells Martin, \\"but not all the time. And that's the point.\\" Martin doesn't respond, but is swayed by Andy's impassioned words. Near the story's conclusion, Martin decides to fire Celia, but acknowledges his own role in purposely antagonizing her in their love-hate relationship. Despite his openness she is extremely angry that her efforts have gone to waste, and when asked to return her key to Martin's house, she throws it in the sink full of water. Finally, Martin asks Andy to describe one last photo for him, one he has kept locked away for years. Martin had previously told Andy that this was the first and most important photo he had ever taken. It is a photo of the garden from Martin's childhood, taken moments after his mother described it on that fateful day. However, Andy's detailed description includes the iconic man raking leaves Martin's mother told him about, that he had rejected for all these years. This revelation provides Martin with his proof, and emotional release.

This kind of design uses design fiction and speculative design proposals to challenge assumptions and conceptions about the role objects play in everyday life. Critical design plays a similar role to product design, but does not emphasize an object's commercial purpose or physical utility. It is mainly used to share a critical perspective or inspire debate while increasing awareness of social, cultural, or ethical issues in the eyes of the public. Critical design was popularized by Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby through their firm, Dunne & Raby.  History  The term Critical Design was first used in Anthony Dunne‚Äôs book Hertzian Tales (1999) and further developed in Design Noir: The Secret Life of Electronic Objects (2001). Its adverse is affirmative design: design that reinforces the status quo. It is more of an attitude than a style or movement; a position rather than a method. Many practitioners of Critical Design who have never heard of the term itself, and/or would describe their work differently. Referring to it as Critical Design simply garners more attention to it, and emphasizes that design has applications beyond problem solving. Design as societal critique is not a new idea. For instance, Italian Radical Design of the 1960s and 70s was highly critical of prevailing social values and design ideologies. Critical design builds on this attitude by creatively critiquing concepts and ideologies using fabricated artifacts to embody commentaries around everything from the #MeToo Movement to consumer culture. The process of designing such an object, as well as the presentation and narrative around the object itself, allows for reflection on existing cultural values, morals, and practices. Humor is important, but satire is not the goal; For a project to succeed in Critical Design, the viewer must be mentally engaged and willing to think beyond the expected and ordinary. A Critical Design object challenges an audience's preconceptions, provoking new ways of thinking about the object, its use, and the surrounding environment. In making such an object, critical designers frequently employ classic design processes‚Äîresearch, user experience, iteration‚Äîwhile working to conceptualize scenarios intended to highlight social, cultural, or political paradigms. Regardless of its processes, Critical Design is often discussed as a unique approach in Design Research, perhaps because of its focus on critiquing widely held social, cultural, and technical beliefs. According to Sanders, Critical Design probes an \\"ambiguous stimuli that designers send to people who then respond to them, providing insights for the design process.\\" Uta Brandes identifies Critical Design as a discrete Design Research method and Bowen integrates it into human-centered design activities as a useful tool for stakeholders to critically think about possible futures. In recent years FABRICA, a communication research center owned by Italian fashion giant Benetton Group, has been actively involved in producing provocative imagery and critical design projects. FABRICA's Visual Communication department, led by Omar Vulpinari, actively participates in critiquing social, political and environmental issues through global awareness campaigns for international magazines and organizations like UN-WHO. Several young artists who have produced critical design projects at FABRICA in recent years are Erik Ravello (Cuba), Yianni Hill (Australia), Marian Grabmayer (Austria), Priya Khatri (India), Andy Rementer (United States), and An Namyoung (South Korea).  Function  To attribute to design practice, critical design broadens the vision in design from traditional practice. It is no longer limited to highlighting the physical function in product design, though this causes some ambiguities in the discussion of critical design's function as it maintains in design area. Matt Malpass addresses Larry Ligo's classification of five different types of function: Structural articulation, Physical function, Psychological function, Social function, as well as Cultural-existentical function in his article, with a further discussion of how Modernism leaves a narrower understanding of physical utility when we think about function, which leads to the ambiguity in Critical Design's function. As critical design focuses on present social, cultural, and ethical implications of design objects and practice, It mostly emphasizes on social and cultural impact from its function. In addition, critical design object has a lot of potentials to contribute to testing ideas during the process of the development of new technology. As Dunne and Raby express their concerns about always lacking communication between the specialists and the general public to form a two-way discussion of new technology. It always limits to one-way flow from specialists to the public. Critical design provides a stage to give scenarios, completes the dialog between specialists and the general public and helps to collect feedback from the public for further refinements before the idea is going too far for any changes.  Critical play  Researcher Mary Flanagan wrote Critical Play:Radical Game Design in 2009, the same year that Lindsay Grace started the Critical Gameplay project. Grace's Critical Gameplay project is an internationally exhibited collection of video games that apply Critical Design. The games provoke questions about the way games are designed and played. The Critical Gameplay Game, Wait, was awarded the Games for Change hall of fame award for being one of the 5 most important games for social impact since 2003. The work has been shown at Electronic Language International Festival, Games, Learning & Society Conference, Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems among other notable events.  Critiques  As critical design has gained mainstream exposure, the discipline has been itself criticized by some for dramatizing so-called 'dystopian scenarios,' which may, in fact, be reflective of real-life conditions in some places in the world. Some see Critical Design as rooted in the fears of a wealthy, urban, western population and failing to engage with existing social problems. As an example, a project titled Republic of Salivation, by designers Michael Burton and Michiko Nitta, featured as part of MoMA's Design and Violence series, portrays a society plagued by overpopulation and food scarcity which is reliant on heavily modified, government-provided, nutrient blocks. Certain media responses to the work, point to the \\"presumed naivety of the project,\\" which presents a scenario that \\"might be dystopian to some, but in some other parts of the world it has been the reality for decades.\\"  Critical acclaim  In recognition of their formalization of the field, Anthony Dunne and Fiona Raby were presented with the inaugural MIT Media Lab Award in June 2015 with director Joichi Ito pointing out that \\"[Dunne and Raby's] pioneering approach to Critical Design and its intersection with science, technology, art, and the humanities has changed the landscape of design education and practice worldwide.\\"  Distinctions with Conceptual art  Conceptual art practice has a very similar role as critical design since both of them are sharing critical perspectives to the public and being commentators to issues, the public may get confused to understand these two different fields. However, Matt Malpass points out that the critical designer still applies the skills from the training and practice as designer but re-orientates these skills from a focus on practical ends to a focus on design work that functions symbolically, culturally, existentially, and discursively. Critical design objects are made precisely based on the design principles and carefully follow the design and design research process. Also, critical design objects always stay close to people's everyday life. They tend to be tested on real people and get feedback for further developments. Conceptual art usually associates with gallery spaces and mostly tends to apply the artistic media in the process.

The origins of the dance lie in the traditional dances of the First Nations, French, English, Scots, and Orcadian peoples from whom the M√©tis Nation was born.[1] The name refers to the Red River of the North which forms the border between North Dakota and Minnesota (USA) flowing northward through Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada to Hudson's Bay.

The name of the town is derived from the name of the Phoenician god Damoros who symbolized immortality (ÿØŸäŸÖŸàŸÖÿ© in Arabic). Damour also remained the capital of Mount Lebanon for three Centuries.  Geography  The city is located in one of the few flat areas of the Lebanese coast. It is built to the north of the river, the ancient Tamyrus,Travels in Palestine and Syria, Volume 1, page 286 By George Robinson which bears its name on a dune overlooking the Mediterranean. It is surrounded by plantations of bananas and vegetable crops. It has an area of . The Beirut-Tyre Highway separates the plantations. Now dismantled, the track is a stopover. = Climate = Damour has a mild mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen climate classification: Csa).  Churches  There exist six churches in Damour, of which Notre-Dame de Damour and St √âlias are the biggest. There are also three other chapels, including Sainte Th√®cle, St Michel, which was the first church in Damour, St Maroun, which is under reconstruction, and St Joseph. These six churches are all Maronite Churches. Before the Lebanese Civil War, Damour had another Catholic church, Savior's Church.  Tourism  Because Damour is one of the few cities of the Lebanese coast having a sand beach, and since it is ten minutes from Beirut, Damour attracts tourists and especially water sports enthusiasts. Thus several restaurants, coffees and snacks are located along the beach. There are also a few restaurants at the edges of the Damour river.  History  Emir Fakhreddine the Great had a great interest in Damour. Commemorative plate for the seizure of Damour by the Australians in 1941, installed in Nahr al-Kalb to the north of Beirut. In the 19th century, Damour was the a flourishing center of the Chouf region. Its plain was then planted with mulberry and had twelve large manufacturing companies. Ten thousand workers and technicians worked in the natural silk industry. The city has a real fascination for the Lebanese worker and attracts the largest majority of the natives in the Sahel region. During the last centuries, Damour was located on the central axis of fighting and successive wars. In 1302, after the mamelouks took Arwad Island, on 8 June the same year, the Cypriots landed on the Damour River. A battle took place between the Emir Fakhr al - Din Abdel - Hamid bin Jamaluddin Altnokhi, his brother the Emir Shams al - Din Abdullah accompanied by an army of Muslims against the Cypriot. The battle was won by Crusaders. Fakhr Din Emir was killed, while his brother Shams al - Din fell hostage. He was released after five days for a ransom of three thousand dinars tyriens. In May 1860, Druze forces committed a massacre of the people. During the nights of the first world war, inhabitants met the armoured French cruiser Jeanne d'Arc sailors and received medicines, food and other needed supplies. In 1941, Damour was the French administrative capital. The city being a strategic crossing point on the road to Beirut, 21 July 1941, was the place of one of the battles that affected Lebanon during World War II Syria-Lebanon Campaign. Australian troops, progressing towards the North along the coast, took Damour, held by the French Foreign Legion, faithful to the Vichy Government. A cease-fire was concluded at the end of the battle. There were no more obstacles in the direction of Beirut. In 1942, South African army engineers built a railway line from Haifa to Beirut along the coast and Australian engineers continued the line to Tripoli. The line is no longer in use. On January 9, 1976, Palestinians laid siege to the city. On January 20, 1976, thousands of Palestinians committed a massacre of the inhabitants. See Damour Massacre. During Israeli invasion of 1982, the Israeli air force bombed the city which was under the control of the Palestinian militias. During the Israeli conflict of 2006, the Israeli air force destroyed several bridges on Highway Beirut-Tyre and on the Damour River. = The Historical Bridge = The history of the archeological bridge dates back to the era of prince-B√©chir Shehab who had a great interest in it, it was considered a strategic and important transit point between Mt Lebanon and the South.

Located at 515 Malcolm X Boulevard (Lenox Avenue) between West 135th and 136th Streets in the Harlem neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, it has, almost from its inception, been an integral part of the Harlem community. It is named for Afro-Puerto Rican scholar Arturo Alfonso Schomburg. The resources of the Center are broken up into five divisions, the Art and Artifacts Division, the Jean Blackwell Hutson General Research and Reference Division, the Manuscripts, Archives and Rare Books Division, the Moving Image and Recorded Sound Division, and the Photographs and Prints Division. In addition to research services, the center hosts readings, discussions, art exhibitions, and theatrical events. It is open to the general public.  Early history =135th Street branch= In 1901, Andrew Carnegie tentatively agreed to donate $5.2 million () to construct 65 branch libraries in New York City, with the requirement that the City provide the land and maintain the buildings once construction was complete. Later in 1901 Carnegie formally signed a contract with the City of New York to transfer his donation to the city to then allow it to justify purchasing the land to house the libraries.; Carnegie Approves the Contracts, Mr. Carnegie's Libraries, The New York Times, September 10, 1901. McKim, Mead & White were chosen as the architects and Charles Follen McKim designed the three-story library building at 103 West 135th Street in the Italian Renaissance Palazzo mode.; contra: These attribute the original design to Stanford White: \\"Books, Black Culture and- the Course of History: Books and History\\", Washington Post, and \\"'Road to Freedom' Show at Library\\". At its opening on July 14, 1905, the library had 10,000 books and the librarian in charge was Gertrude Cohen. =Rose tenure (1920‚Äì1942) = WPA poster promoting use of the Schomburg Collection of the New York Public Library (Federal Art Project 1941‚Äì43) In 1920, Ernestine Rose, a white woman born in Bridgehampton in 1880, became the branch librarian. She quickly integrated the all-white library staff. Catherine Allen Latimer, the first African-American librarian hired by the NYPL, was sent to work with Rose as was Roberta Bosely months later. Some time later Sadie Peterson Delaney became employed at the branch. Together, they created a plan to assist integrating reading into the lives of the library attendees and cooperated with schools and social organizations in the community. In 1921, the library hosted the first exhibition of African-American art in Harlem; it became an annual event. The library became a focal point to the burgeoning Harlem Renaissance. In 1923, the 135th Street branch was the only branch in New York City employing Negroes as librarians, and consequently when Regina M. Anderson was hired by the NYPL, she was sent to work at the 135th Street branch. Rose issued a report to the American Library Association, in 1923, which stated that requests for books about Negroes or written by Negroes had been increasing, and that the demand for professionally trained colored librarians was also.Marshall: 67; cf. Working with Negroes Roundtable by Ernestine Rose In late 1924, Rose called a meeting, with attendees including Arturo Alfonso Schomburg, James Weldon Johnson, Hubert Harrison, that decided to focus on preserving rare books, and solicit donations to enhance its African-American collection. On May 8, 1925, it began operating as the Division of Negro Literature, History and Prints, a division of the NYPL.; cf. Tibbets: 22, \\"Historical Society is Launched at Library\\", 1925-05-13, In 1926, Schomburg was interested in selling his collection of African-American literature because he wanted it to be available to the general public, but he wanted the collection to stay in Harlem. Rose and the National Urban League convinced the Carnegie Foundation to pay $10,000 to Schomburg and then donate the books to the library. In 1926, the center's collection won acclaim with the addition of Schomburg's personal collection. By donating his collection, Schomburg sought to show that black people had a history and a culture and thus were not inferior to other races.; cf. Rare Library Brought to Harlem: Schomburg's Rare Negro Library Now at the 135th Street Branch Noted Bibliophile Began Collecting Books on His Race 35 Years Ago About 5,000 objects in Schomburg's collection were donated.; \\"2,932 volumes, 1,124 pamphlets, and many valuable prints\\" cf; (New York Library Bulletin 31, April 1927, p. 295). In 1929, Anderson was desirous of a promotion and enlisted the help of W. E. B. Du Bois and Walter Francis White when she was being discriminated against by not being promoted. After letters of intervention on her behalf by Du Bois and White, and a boycott of the library by White, Anderson was promoted and transferred to the Rivington Street branch of the NYPL.Whitmire: ? By 1930, the Center had 18,000 volumes. In 1932, Schomburg became the first curator of his collection, until his death in 1938. cf. Schomburg Center History. In 1935, the Center developed a project to deliver books once a week to those handicapped severely enough that they could not make it to the library. Dr. Lawrence D. Reddick became the second curator of the Schomburg Collection of Negro Literature. \\"Dr. Lawrence D. Reddick has been appointed curator of the Schomburg Collection of Negro Literature at the 135th Street Branch of the New York Public Library.\\" At the behest of Reddick, in October 1940, the entire Division of Negro History, Literature and Prints was renamed the Schomburg Collection of Negro History and Literature. In 1942 Rose retired after an extension was built onto the rear of the building, at a time when the library had 40,000 books. Dorothy Robinson Homer replaced her as Branch Librarian, after the Citizen's Committee of the 135th Street Branch Library specifically requested a Negro to replace Rose. =Countee Cullen branch= After the extension was built, the library became known as the Countee Cullen Library branch, and the 135th Street Library is still considered the original location of the Countee Cullen branch, although that name is now only used for the extension itself on West 136th Street.Andrew L. Yarrow, \\"Repository of Black Past is Reopened\\", The New York Times, August 19, 1990 (archived). Homer created a room of books just for young adults and created the American Negro Theatre in the basement that spawned the play Anna Lucasta, which was moved to Broadway. She kept the emphasis on building a community center for art, music and drama. She put on art exhibits that favored unknown, young artists of all races. After the outbreak of WWII, Homer started a program of monthly concert recitals in the auditorium to enhance public spirit, but the demand by performers and audience members to continue the practice made it permanent. =Hutson tenure (1948‚Äì1980) = In 1948, Jean Blackwell, later Jean Blackwell Hutson, was named the director of the Center. In a 1966 speech, Hutson warned of the perilous status of the Schomburg collection. In 1971, the Center began being supported by the privately funded Schomburg Corporation. The next year, funds by New York City were allocated to renovate the building at 103 West 135th, and it was renamed the building of the Schomburg Collection for Research in Black Culture.; cf. NYC Landmarks Preservation Committee. Simultaneously, the entire Schomburg collection was rounded up from various branch libraries and transferred to the Center. In 1972, it was designated as one of NYPL's research libraries. In 1973, a building on the west side of Lenox ave between 135th and 136th was bought so that it could be demolished and a new building could be constructed. The location was chosen due to its proximity to other community agencies and because it was the \\"scene of the Harlem Renaissance.\\" In 1978, the building on 135th Street between Lenox and 7th Avenues was entered into the National Register of Historic Places.; cf. Stein Lauds Hudson. In 1979, it was formally listed in the NRHP. Schomburg Center The entrance to the Center In 1980, a new Schomburg Center was founded at 515 Lenox Avenue. In 1981, the original building on West 135th Street which held the Schomburg Collection was designated a New York City Landmark. In 2016, both the original and current buildings, now joined by a connector, were designated a National Historic Landmark. =Wray tenure (1981‚Äì1983) = In 1981, Wendell L. Wray became the director of the Center. Protests began over Wray's decision to not hire an African-American man to head the Center's Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Books Division and instead hired Robert Morris.; cf. In 1983, Wray resigned to pursue academic research and Catherine Hooker was named acting director. =Dodson tenure (1984‚Äì2011)= Howard Dodson became the director in 1984, at a time when the Schomburg was primarily a cultural center visited by tourists and schoolchildren and its research facilities were known only to scholars. In 1984, the Schomburg's collection was at 5 million. In 1984 attendance was 40,000 a year. As early as 1984, the Schomburg was recognized as the most important institution in the world for collections of art and literature of people in Africa or its diaspora. In 1983, a scholars-in-residence program started at the center. In 1986, an exhibit entitled Give me your poor... sparked controversy. In March 1987, a public funding campaign was started to raise money to renovate the old library and to enhance the new Center's housing and its functions.; Culture Center Expansion. In 1991, completion of additions to the Schomburg Center were completed. The new center on Malcolm X was expanded to include an auditorium and a connection to the old landmark building on 135th.\\"Grand Opening of Expanded Schomburg Center\\", The New York Times, April 8, 1991 (archived). The Art and Artifacts Division and the Moving Image and Recorded Sound Division were moved into the old landmark building. In 2000, the Schomburg Center held an exhibition titled \\"Lest We Forget: The Triumph Over Slavery\\", which later went on tour around the world for more than a decade under the sponsorship of UNESCO's Slave Route Project. In 2005, the center held an exhibition of letters, photographs and other material related to Malcolm X. In 2007, the building was renovated and expanded in an $11 million project. The Schomburg Center had 120,000 visitors a year; by 2010, Dodson announced he would retire in early 2011. In 2007, the Schomburg Center was one of the sponsors of the African Burial Ground National Monument. =Muhammad tenure (2011‚Äì2016)= Following Howard Dodson's announcement of his retirement in 2010, Khalil Gibran Muhammad, great-grandson of Elijah Muhammad and professor of history at Indiana University, was announced as Dodson's replacement. In the summer of 2011, Muhammad became the fifth director of the Schomburg. His stated goals were for the Schomburg to be a focal point for young adults and to collaborate with the local community, to not only reinforce its pride, but also for the Center to be a gateway for revealing the history of Black people worldwide. In July, the Center began an exhibit of Malcolm X footage and prints entitled Malcolm X: the Search for Truth. =Young tenure (2016‚Äìpresent)= On August 1, 2016, the New York Public Library announced that poet and academic Kevin Young would begin as the Director in the \\"late fall\\" of 2016. Bob Gore photographs Kevin Young and Claudia Rankin Collection NYPL Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture logo The Schomburg Collection was considered, in 1998, as consisting of the rarest, and most useful, Afrocentric artifacts of any public library in the United States. At least as late of 2006, it is viewed as the most prestigious for African-American materials in the country. As of 2010, the Collection stood at 10 million objects, The Center contains a signed, first edition of a book of poems by Phillis Wheatley, archival material of Melville J.

Early life St Aubyn was born at Powick Vicarage, Worcestershire, in the English Midlands, the home of his maternal grandfather, on 6 April 1815. He was the second son of the Rev Robert Thomas St Aubyn and his wife, Frances Fleming St John, and a cousin of John St Aubyn, 1st Baron St Levan, of St Michael's Mount, Cornwall. He was known to his family and friends by his second Christian name of Piers (sometimes spelt Pearse). He was educated at Penzance Grammar School before beginning his studies in architecture. He married Eliza Phillpott in 1852 at Stoke Damerel, Devon. Eliza was born in Ceylon in 1816 and died on 13 September 1881 at their home, 108 Cambridge Street, Hanover Square, London. Career He was articled to Thomas Fulljames (1808‚Äì1874) in Gloucester and acted as clerk of works for the latter's Edwards College, South Cerney (Glos) in 1838‚Äì39. He was elected to the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1837, on the nomination of George Basevi, Edward Blore and William Railton, and became a Fellow of the Institute in 1856, proposed by Benjamin Ferrey, Giles Gilbert Scott, and Francis Penrose. He twice served on the Council of the Institute (in 1858‚Äì60 and 1870‚Äì72). He was Surveyor to the Middle Temple in London from 1851 until 1885, and practised from Lambe Buildings in the Temple for much of his career. From about 1885 onwards, when he seems to have semi-retired, St. Aubyn worked in partnership with Henry John Wadling (d 1918), who entered his office as a pupil in 1858 and remained as his assistant and managing clerk. St Aubyn died on 7 May 1895 at Chy-an-Eglos, Marazion (Cornwall), and is buried on St Michael's Mount. H J Wadling succeeded to his practice, and continued to trade as \\"St Aubyn & Wadling\\". Trevince, Gwennap St Aubyn was undoubtedly assisted in developing his career by his family's prominence in Devon and Cornwall, and particularly in Devonport, where they were the major landowners. He practised chiefly in London and developed a practice which extended all over southern England, but he also kept an office in Devonport for part of his career, and he was employed particularly extensively in Devon and Cornwall. Apart from this local connection, there are clusters of his work in Gloucestershire (no doubt deriving from his years in Fulljames' office), Kent, Reading, Cambridgeshire and Leicestershire. He was primarily a church architect, building a considerable number of new churches and undertaking even more restorations. His church work was firmly in the Gothic revival mainstream of his time, rarely departing from the forms and decoration of the Decorated period, and lacks much originality or flair. His churches at All Saints, Reading and St Mary, Tyndalls Park, Bristol, are notably similar. His restorations often amounted to wholesale or partial rebuilding, and were seen by later generations as unnecessarily brutal; Sir John Betjeman was among St Aubyn's 20th-century detractors. St Aubyn also designed a number of country houses, mostly in a rather cheerless early Gothic style. The one whimsical building he is known to have designed is the clock tower in the grounds of Abberley Hall, c 1883. His greatest professional disappointment was his failure to secure the commission to build Truro Cathedral, which he lost by one vote to John Loughborough Pearson; his designs for the Cathedral were published in Building News, 20 December 1878. His most notable achievement was the restoration of St Michael's Mount, described by Nigel Nicolson as: \\"among the greatest achievements of 19th-century architecture\\".

The first edition of the book was published in the same year. Nathaniel Ward (1578 ‚Äì October 1652) was a Puritan clergyman and pamphleteer in England and Massachusetts. He wrote the first constitution in North America in 1641. A son of John Ward, a noted Puritan minister, he was born in Haverhill, Suffolk, England. He studied law and graduated from Emmanuel College, Cambridge University in 1603.Tyler, Moses Coit, A History of American Literature, 1607‚Äì1676. G.P. Putnam's Sons (1878), p. 228. He practised as a barrister and travelled in continental Europe. In Heidelberg he met a German Protestant reformer, David Pareus, who persuaded him to enter the ministry. In 1618 he was a chaplain to a company of English merchants at Elbing, in Prussia. He returned to England and in 1628 he was appointed rector of Stondon Massey in Essex. He was soon recognised as one of the foremost Puritan ministers in Essex, and so in 1631 was reprimanded by the Bishop of London, William Laud. Although he escaped excommunication, in 1633 he was dismissed for his Puritan beliefs. (Ward's two brothers also suffered for their non-conformity.) In 1634 Ward emigrated to Massachusetts and became a minister in Ipswich for two years. He then resigned because of ill-health. While still living in Ipswich, he wrote for the colony of Massachusetts The Body of Liberties, legal code, which was adopted by the General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Company in December 1641. This was the first code of laws established in New England. The Body of Liberties defined liberty in terms that were advanced in their day, establishing a code of fundamental principles based on Common Law, Magna Carta, and the Old Testament. However, Ward believed in theocracy rather than democracy. One of his epigrams was: > The upper world shall Rule, While Stars will run their race: The nether > world obey, While People keep their place. Ward thought that justice and the law were essential to the liberty of the individual. Some have said that The Body of Liberties began the American tradition of liberty, leading eventually to the United States Constitution.Winthrop Society In 1645 Ward began his second book, The Simple Cobler of Aggawam in America. This was published in England in January, 1646‚Äì1647, before Ward's return there, under the pseudonym of Theodore de la Guard. Three other editions, with important additions and changes, soon followed. The Simple Cobbler is a small book, which \\"in spite of its bitterness, and its lack of toleration\\" is \\"full of quaint originality, grim humor and power\\", according to the anthology Colonial Prose and Poetry: The Transplanting of Culture 1607‚Äì1650 (1903).Trent, William P. and Wells, Benjamin W., Colonial Prose and Poetry: The Transplanting of Culture 1607‚Äì1650, New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Co., 1903 edition, pp. 250‚Äì251. According to the anthology, the book is \\"probably the most interesting literary performance\\" in the first half of the 17th century in the English colonies that later became the United States. The book was later reprinted in 1713 and 1843 in Boston, Massachusetts. He also wrote several religious- political pamphlets. At the end of the English Civil War, Ward returned to England where he wrote pamphlets, particularly Discolliminium (1650), critical of the establishment of the Commonwealth. His contribution to the Engagement debate (an oath of loyalty to the new Commonwealth) and his attack on polemic opponents, particularly John Dury with whom he had a 'friendly scuffle'(44), included attacking the speed with which the oath was to be administered and questioning the government's legitimacy as a just power. Ward became the minister of the church at Shenfield in Essex and died shortly after in Shenfield.

It is written in the iambic heptameter. It was first published in The Bulletin on 17 December 1892. The poem relates the experiences of a man from the Bush who visit Sydney and becomes the subject of a practical joke by a mischievous barber. The barber pretends to cut the bushman's throat by slashing his newly-shaven neck using the back of his cut-throat razor that had been heated in boiling water. While making his displeasure known, > A peeler man [i.e. policeman] who heard the din came in to see the show; > He tried to run the bushman in, but he refused to go. The barber confesses that he was playing a joke, and the bushman, unconvinced, returns to Ironbark, where, due to his accounts of his Sydney experiences, \\"flowing beards are all the go\\". There are obvious echoes in the poem of the urban legend of the murdering barber - fictionalised in the penny dreadful The String of Pearls which featured the notorious Sweeney Todd. Ironbark was the earlier name for Stuart Town, a town in the Central West region of New South Wales.

L, which ran from 2001 to 2004 and collected in eight volumes. It was adapted into a live-action movie and a novel in 1984 and a pachinko game in 2007. In 1986, K≈çtar≈ç Makarit≈çru! received the Kodansha Manga Award for sh≈çnen. Characters K≈çtar≈ç Shind≈ç - A high-school-aged karate expert who is descended from a long line of ninja. While he may be a fighting genius, he lacks common sense and any inhibitions whatsoever, but possessing a strong sense of justice. He spends most of his time getting into trouble with school officials, and trying to steal girls' panties, especially Mayumi's. He is very protective of three things: his long hair, his panty collection, and Mayumi. Mayumi Watase - Captain of the 7th Discipline Squad, Mayumi is K≈çtar≈ç's childhood friend and chief romantic interest. She's the only one who seems to be able to keep K≈çtar≈ç in check. While she's nowhere near K≈çtar≈ç's level, she's not a damsel in distress. She's got a good grip on the basics of both karate and judo. Mayumi also happens to be a member of the school's Decency League; much to K≈çtar≈ç's annoyance. Teruhiko Tenk≈çji - A bald samurai who patrols the school as the enforcer of the Decency League. Early on, he appears to be an enemy of K≈çtar≈ç's, but as the series progresses the audience learns that he gradually changes into K≈çtar≈ç's main rival and best friend. He comes from a high class traditional family and has an iinazuke (fianc√© that his parents picked for him) named Sayoko. Being called \\"baldie\\" or \\"bald\\" drives him insane, since he insists that his head is not bald, but merely shaved. His fighting ability is on par with K≈çtar≈ç, arguably the only character in the series who is a true match for him. Though his chief ambition is fighting and defeating K≈çtar≈ç in a fair duel, they have never really fought each other on even terms, and it is implied that both of them actually do not want that fated duel to ever happen, because that would mean the end of their current friendship and relationship. After defeating a berserk and addled Tenkoji who was hypnotized by the mind-altering Kugutsu dance in the Japan Dome, K≈çtar≈ç himself stated sadly that \\"I don't want to lose to Tenkoji, but I don't want to win, either.\\"  K≈çtar≈ç Makarit≈çru  The original K≈çtar≈ç Makaritoru contained seven major arcs and 1 side series. Initially, the comic was filled with slapstick comedy and small sexual humor, but as the story progressed, the comic became more mature and serious. However, some of the classic humor remained. =Beginning of K≈çtar≈ç = The very first arc of K≈çtar≈ç Makarit≈çru introduced K≈çtar≈ç Shind≈ç, Mayumi Watase, Teruhiko Tenk≈çji, and Red Rose to the series, who became the main characters. It also showed some of the ongoing humor such as Tenk≈çji's head would light up when exposed to electricity, K≈çtar≈ç's most important treasures, Tenk≈çji's hatred over people calling him a baldy. (In his defense, he says he shaved his head once... and the hair never grew back. So he's not \\"bald\\", the \\"hair just never grew back\\") The first archive started the knowledge of the unknown syndicate known as the Snakebone Syndicate that controls the school with fear. As the president of the Discipline Group explained, the Syndicate is needed to prevent the outbreaks of many small school gangs from taking over the school. He also explained that the Syndicate controlled over 50% of the school grounds, preventing the small gangs from gaining powers. From the beginning, the Discipline Organization (Namely Mayumi) are hunting down K≈çtar≈ç because of his hair is longer than the school regulation allows. However, the hunt became more ravaging when the Student Council President Takaro Ichir≈ç would pay 1,000,000 Yen to anyone that cuts off K≈çtar≈ç's long hair, causing the whole school to be on the hunt. In truth, he hated K≈çtar≈ç and his bad press and would do anything to get rid of him. The hunt ended with K≈çtar≈ç and Mayumi surrounded by varies of clubs of the school, and the Student Council President, which caused K≈çtar≈ç to cut off his ponytail, forcing Ichir≈ç to pay the one Million Yen to him (Which he never did). But later, K≈çtar≈ç revealed that it's no more than a wig that he cut off to show Mayumi. Later, K≈çtar≈ç and Tenk≈çji had their very first fight at a school rock band competition, which K≈çtar≈ç sneaked on to become the main singer of an unknown band by holding the original member hostage. He continuously insulted Tenk≈çji by singing 'Baldy' with every lyric because boldness nearly got him killed the last time they met, and revealed that he shaves his head rather than natural boldness. Eventually they have their first battle starting with K≈çtar≈ç writing baldy on Tenk≈çji's forehead, which he quickly corrected by writing a 'not' on there. The battle continued with K≈çtar≈ç tries to dull Tenk≈çji's blade by using smut, which failed because of the force Tenk≈çji has. While Tenk≈çji's distracted by Mayumi, K≈çtar≈ç thought of a plan to defeat him, by connecting electricity to his blade, and shock him. The electricity shock caused Tenk≈çji's head to light up like a lightbulb, literally. Few days later, the Discipline Groups has started to use K≈çtar≈ç as bait to fish out the members of the school's syndicate, the Snakebone. But from the Red Rose point of view, she wants the captain of one of the school's Judo club, whose also a member of the Snakebone, to fight him. The captain, Kimura Masahiko, accepted after hearing that K≈çtar≈ç defeated his number one adversary, Teruhiko Tenk≈çji, and gets his members of the club to capture him. Initially they didn't succeed until Red Rose interfere by accurately throwing a rock at K≈çtar≈ç from the distance of 50 meters, knocking him unconscious. Masahiko wants to test out K≈çtar≈ç's ability first because he still have some doubts with his strength, so he sends all 100 men to fight him. K≈çtar≈ç easily defeated all 100 of them without wasting any time. Meanwhile, Tenk≈çji's plan worked, and quickly followed K≈çtar≈ç along with his subordinates, Aota and Akai. Initially, the both of them were at a draw, but Masahiko quickly overpowers Kotaro with the help of his members, causing K≈çtar≈ç to nearly lose, until Mayumi's arrival. She tried to help K≈çtar≈ç, but was knock back by Masahiko rather quickly, causing K≈çtar≈ç to explode with power unimagined by anyone. He quickly release the choking from Masahiko, and brutally defeats him. Red Rose, along with two members of the syndicate, was shocked, but Red Rose was, for some reason, enjoying this. The news of K≈çtar≈ç defeating one of the strongest Judo Artist quickly spread, in news, chatting, and more. Causing Ichir≈ç to act again, by summoning Tenk≈çji and the Captain of the Discipline First Squad, Sadoya Shunperi. Ichir≈ç proposes that whoever eliminates Kotaro will be the new Captain of the whole Discipline squad, a position that Tenk≈çji current is at. The winner will also receive one Million yen, which is a price that Tenk≈çji refused. He only wants to eliminate Kotaro in an honorable battle, while he knows that Sadoya will kill Kotaro in every possible way. The first time that K≈çtar≈ç and Sadoya battle, K≈çtar≈ç was at a disadvantage because Sayoda had a pre-emptive strike. He almost defeats Kotaro until Mayumi interferes again, causing the table to turn and allowing him to escape. Meanwhile, Tenk≈çji had an unexpected visit of the Red Rose, and starts to investigate who she is. After K≈çtar≈ç escapes, Sadoya warns Mayumi to be careful of the next Discipline Group Meeting, which was tomorrow. During the meeting, Sadoya purposely came in late to force everyone out of the room to get some information about K≈çtar≈ç from Mayumi. Tenk≈çji arrive after the meeting was over because he was trying to find out who the Red Rose was all night. Around the middle of the archive, the Red Rose discovered K≈çtar≈ç's weakness, Mayumi. If Mayumi is in any trouble, Kotaro will definitely go and protect her in any way. Using this information, the Red Rose kidnaps Mayumi in order to see the true potential of K≈çtar≈ç. After defeating Sayoda in Battle Red Rose asks K≈çtar≈ç to become the chairman of the Snakebone Committee, but K≈çtar≈ç refuses preferring to be a free man. =Princess Clara's visit= The story began with an announcement that Princess Clara (Shana Hawkins) from Moore Country as a transfer student. Our twisted hero, K≈çtar≈ç, quickly announced that he will steal the princess's underwear as long as she remains at the school. Tenk≈çji was ordered by the student body president to guard Princess Clara as he fears K≈çtar≈ç's success might become an international embarrassment for the school. Tenk≈çji initially refused, until the Chairman of the school personally requested his assistance. On the day of arrival, many people and media came to the school to celebrate her appearance. Among the crowd are Tarako the Student Body President, Tenk≈çji, Mayumi, but no K≈çtar≈ç, although there is an extremely weird reporter that asking perverted questions. When the Limousine arrived, Tarako wanted to be the first one to greet Princess Clara, but instead, he encounters her bodyguard Anthony, a giant man, instead. Chris, the Princess's other bodyguard, came out and had a little feud with Tenk≈çji. The Princess eventually came out, and greeted everyone around her. When Mayumi introduced herself to Clara, the weird reporter reappeared and asked a perverted question towards the Princess. In the midst of all this, an assassin ran up and attempted to kill the princess, but was stopped by Tenk≈çji, Chris, and the reporter. Though the assassin was injured, he still managed to take the reporter hostage, which caused the reporter to joke about this situation. Pissed, the assassin struck the reporter on the head, revealing waist long hair hidden under a wig. People instantly recognized the reporter as K≈çtar≈ç. The assassin was quickly disposed of by K≈çtar≈ç and Tenk≈çji. Tenk≈çji then challenged K≈çtar≈ç to a fight. K≈çtar≈ç, ignoring Tenk≈çji, formally introduced himself to Princess, and wished her to be happy while staying in Japan. When Tenk≈çji about the announcement, K≈çtar≈ç quickly said that he was framed, but then lifted Princess Clara's skirt as a declaration that he will quickly obtain her panties as soon as possible. This resulted in a greatly angered Anthony trying to kill K≈çtar≈ç, who escapes using his wits. Before leaving, he asked Clara to wait for him, which to people's surprise when Clara innocently answered she will wait for him... Ky≈çnr≈ç Inemori, the current sensei of Shinta Karate Dojo, sparred with K≈çtar≈ç in order for K≈çtar≈ç to perfect the underwear removal technique. Mayumi was angered by this action and further enraged when she saw all the underwear that K≈çtar≈ç had stolen from her. To prevent K≈çtar≈ç from leaving and stealing the Princess's panties, Mayumi handcuffed K≈çtar≈ç to herself and told Ky≈çnr≈ç to swallow the key. When Mayumi realized that they must do practically everything with each other because of the cuff, she immediately regretted what she had done, and begged Ky≈çnr≈ç to spit the key out to no avail. This caused K≈çtar≈ç and Mayumi to spend the night with each other. In the morning, K≈çtar≈ç effortlessly escaped the handcuff and purposely recuffed only Mayumi. Next day, Princess Clara asked Mayumi what kind of person is K≈çtar≈ç, to which Mayumi responded with nothing but insults. But to her surprise, the Princess actually doesn't see those as bad qualities. K≈çtar≈ç, who's been guarded by the male members of the Discipline Group decides to escape them. Although the Group tried attempted to stop K≈çtar≈ç from running, he easily outsmarted the members and hid in the women's locker room, awaiting for the Princess's arrival. Initially, K≈çtar≈ç wanted to steal Clara's panties at that point, but after seeing the princess's naivety (and Tenk≈çji's interference), he decided not to steal it for now. =Battle of Sector E= Sector E in Tsurugamine High School is a place for delinquents. It is such a chaotic sector that isn't like a school at all. It's just a lawless place for delinquents to fight and they're divided into gangs. In this arc, Kotaro took the school's monorail to this block and on the way, he met someone who claimed to be Kotaro. At this point, Kotaro is trying to keep a low profile and hide his long hair, thus nobody knew it was him. However, with his free nature, it didn't take long for him to reveal himself. Aside from that, Kotaro also met Kenji Kisaragi in the monorail train; a man with a very serious look. In Sector E, gangs always give 'welcoming ceremony' to people who just arrived. It is a test to see newcomer's strength. During the test, the 'Kotaro Impostor' was defeated in an instant and to save him, Kotaro revealed himself as the real Kotaro by defeating a Gang leader. Then it comes to Kenji's test, one of the gangs employ a man who is very well skilled with knife, only to be humiliated by Kenji (showing that Kenji is a very skilled fighter). Seeing the two newcomers are very high skilled, the gangs began to fight over who is getting them. Apparently Kenji already has a gang to join, and Kotaro refused all the gangs. Leaving the gangs behind, Kotaro eventually gained a follower, the impostor whose name remain not known. Kotaro kept on calling him Impostor. Later on, Mayumi also arrived at Sector E with Megumi Yoshioka. With Megumi, Mayumi learns Kotaro's intention, going to Sector E. Apparently Kotaro is there for a treasure hunt, a ruby that's worth a few million yen that is hidden in Sector E. Megumi then undress Mayumi and they both were disguised as \\"Punk\\"'s member, the strongest gang in Sector E. Soon after that, at their first encounter with a gang member, they found out that Punk has been defeated by a new rising gang, 'Cyclops'. Kotaro later found the head of Punk, Hedgehog, crucified; feeling pity for him, he rescued the man. Hedgehog then, became Kotaro's follower too in Sector E. Kotaro then met the China Rose, a gang consisted of transvestite with no actual fighting ability. Their only fighter is Kenji, whom Kotaro met earlier. As the story progresses, Kotaro then met a Cyclops member, but Kotaro refused to fight. Impostor, however, insisted Kotaro to fight, because he actually idolized Kotaro and felt sad that the Kotaro he idolized is running away. He then shielded Kotaro (by accident?) and was very badly wounded and lost consciousness, which caused Kotaro to shed tear and get really angry. That's when Kotaro decided not to run anymore, and he'll definitely defeat his opponent. Impostor was saved by a cafeteria cook. The only woman in Sector E. At this moment, Mayumi and Megumi were already safe with China Rose's headquarter. Cyclops' leader, a masked man, began his move as he found the ruby location. Aside from that, the leader of Bombers gang, Mountain Cat, made himself a leader for the united Sector E, meant to unite and defeat Cyclops. China Rose were captured at this moment Meanwhile, Tenkoji and his School Disciplinary Committee member arrived in Sector E. Tenkoji then met Kenji, whom he thought as an enemy. The fought and Kenji managed to damage Tenkoji with his weapon, an eight-sectioned staff. However Tenkoji, deploys a secret weapon, his light bulb head that shines, made Kenji lose his guard and was also damaged. They later both realized they're not enemies, Kenji wanted to save China Rose whose head is his brother (sister - transvestite), and Tenkoji is looking for Kotaro. Soon they learned about Kotaro's whereabout and headed there. Kotaro, with his cunningness and skill, managed to get the ruby before them. The ruby was hidden in a cave. In that cave, Kotaro fought with Cyclops' leader who uses whip and vice leader who uses rapier. In the fight, Kotaro accidentally swallowed the ruby and he decided to just run, but as he jumped, Cyclops leader's whip managed to catch his legs, causing him to land on his head, breaking a rock and lost consciousness. At this moment, Tenkoji and Kenji has arrived, rescuing Kotaro. Realizing he's at disadvantage, Cyclops' leader retreated, also Kenji and Tenkoji's priority is to save Kotaro. When Kotaro gain consciousness, he had an amnesia, but his usual carefree attitude and fighting skill are not lost. In this situation, he made a joke, reference to Hokuto no Ken (Fist of the Northstar), mimicking his action and changing his face to Kenshiro from Hokuto no Ken. The team then continued to rescue Mayumi with the China Rose. Kenji who has developed feeling to Mayumi, rushed to the rescue. Later Kotaro fled from Tenkoji and Kenji's care, meeting Megumi. He and Megumi managed to release the China Rose, but they're still trapped in a warehouse. At that night, the united Sector E Gang is looking for Kotaro, and so is everyone. Finally, the Cyclops' leader came, entered the warehouse and managed to defeat Kotaro and capture all the protagonists, including Tenkoji and Kenji and the United Gang's leader, Mountain Cat. With this result, Cyclops' leader decided to make a game of death for his entertainment purpose before dissecting Kotaro for the ruby. The following morning, a giant contraption has been made. It is a giant device that can remove a person's head from the body made of wood beams and giant rock. Kenji's sister, Kotaro, and a Disciplinary Committee's member were made hostage attached to this device. In the game, Kenji and Tenkoji were made to a duel of death. The winner can rescue the person affiliated with them. In the duel, Kenji gained an upper hand, but he was distracted by Mayumi's presence. Taking this chance, Tenkoji pierced his stomach, with an attack where everyone thought for sure, that would have killed him. Winning the battle, Tenkoji had his member rescued, but he chose to trade his life with Kenji's brother, Hiromi. Tenkoji however, whispered to Hiromi something that indicates that Kenji is alive. Kenji apparently were already saved by the cafeteria lady. While now, Tenkoji is about to get his execution, suddenly a knife were thrown from unknown position, releasing his neck from the device. In the game, Kotaro's death sentence was changed to hanging, and Mayumi then were made to hold Kotaro's leg so he won't suffocate, but below Kotaro, is a burning metal plate. It is then matter of endurance before Mayumi fell and they both die. At the final moment, Mayumi confessed her feelings to Kotaro, which causes Kotaro to regain his memory. Seeing Mayumi about to fall, he gained super strength breaking the rope that binds him, and managed to save himself with Mayumi. With both the protagonists safe and well, Kotaro then fought Cyclops' leader who apparently is his old enemy, Sadoya's brother, and Tenkoji fought with Sadoya's second in command. While they're battling, the Discipline Committee's leader appeared in Sector E's cafeteria. Revealing that, the Cafetaria Lady, is actually Red Rose, and the ruby actually means leadership for Snakebone Syndicate, and that he is White Rose, the 'Brain' of Snakebone. Red Rose refused to give him the leadership position, and fled. Meanwhile, Kotaro finally managed to defeat Sadoya, and thus ends the arc. In the epilogue, Kenji finally realized he has finally gain friends, Kotaro didn't seem to remember much that Mayumi confessed, and everyone then returns to their respective home: Kenji and China Rose were back to Sector E, Kotaro and companions, to where they belong. Before leaving, the Sector E gangs then cheered for Kotaro and thanked him for getting rid of Sadoya from Sector E, making it a happy end for the arc. =School Tournament= To rebuild the dojo that the Cheerleader squad had demolished, and for the prize of 1,000 panties, K≈çtar≈ç enters the School tournament. =Side Series= The side series contained Three stories, first one about K≈çtar≈ç and Tenk≈çji had a shipwreck and are stranded on an Island in the south. (The reason why Mayumi wasn't there was because she went by plane.) There they meet up with a girl that looks extremely like Mayumi, except K≈çtar≈ç said Mayumi's boobs are larger. The two of them eventually saved the girl, named Mimi, and her tribe from a group of cannibals, and giving them the courage to defend them. Although Mimi wanted K≈çtar≈ç to stay with them forever, he couldn't because of Mayumi. The second side story was the first main storyline that Tatsuya Hiruta had planned to do, however scrapped eventually. The Main Characters that was first shown was K≈çtar≈ç, Nugumi, and Ichir≈ç, however, it wasn't the same Nugumi from the Sector E Saga. This Nugumi was more shy and innocent. The story began with Nugumi was harassed by gangsters, and was easily saved by K≈çtar≈ç, causing Nugumi to think that he's her knight in shining armor. The third and final side story focused on K≈çtar≈ç, Mayumi, and Tenk≈çji's freshman year. =National Tournament= =Band Series= This is about guitar war like movie \\"Crossroad\\". \\"Otomi Kyo\\" friend of Kotaro is a famous guitarist.

It was awarded the Bram Stoker Award for best novel by a new author in 1990. Plot The novel (as many of Little's works do) deals with a series of unexplained events in a small town in Arizona. A church is defaced with goat's blood, the pastor and his family disappear, and several townspeople begin having terrifying visions of deformed infants. Eventually, an unknown force begins to attack and murder several of the townspeople. Gordon, the main protagonist, discovers that his wife is pregnant and begins to fear for her safety and that of the unborn child. Soon, a seemingly unbalanced evangelical preacher named Brother Elias comes to the town to preach about the end times. Widely ignored at first, he gradually gains a following of people as more and more bizarre events unfold in the town. As the terror mounts, Elias convinces Gordon, the sheriff, and the new pastor to join him in his quest to stop Satan from raising an army of deformed infants. It seems that the devil has the power to corrupt the unborn into horrible servants of darkness, and over the centuries hundreds of these stillborn children have been buried in the hills surrounding the town. At this time, Elias also reveals he is not human, but an earthly servant of God whose role it is to stop Satan from assembling his army. He further explains that he has done this several times over the millennia. The four men face off against the incarnation of the devil, who has taken the form of the missing pastor. They succeed in stopping him, though Elias knows that the battle is never truly over and begins wandering away to make preparations for the next battle. 1990 novels Novels set in Arizona 1990 debut novels ","title":"The Revelation (Little novel)"},{"id":"2987673","text":"About The Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales is the permanent assembly of Catholic Bishops and Personal Ordinaries in the two member countries.
