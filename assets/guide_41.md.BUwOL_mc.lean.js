Thoreson, formerly Jennifer B. Hudson, is a contemporary visual artist and photographer. She incorporates mechanical and natural elements in sculpture, installation, costuming, makeup, and digital editing to create hauntingly beautiful images that address faith, spirituality, and the acceptance of one's self. Early life and education Thoreson was born in 1979 in Weatherford, Texas. When she was still a child, her family moved to a small, conservative town in rural Texas where Thoreson spent her early years. She was raised extremely creative, and began to experiment with many things during her adult life. She graduated magna cum laude from the University of Texas at Arlington with her bachelor's degree in fine arts in 2001, and later went on to receive her masters in fine arts from the University of New Mexico in 2014., \\"Jennifer Hudson Fine Art.\\" Jennifer Hudson Fine Art. N.p., n.d. Web. 11 Mar. 2017. Since then she has taught at the University of New Mexico and the Santa Fe Photographic Workshops, as well as housing informal workshops, both in person and online, in Texas, California, Pennsylvania, and Nevada. Religious influence Thoreson utilizes costuming and installation into her photographic works in order to create an ethereal, other-worldly experience. Her use of items that would usually be discarded further speaks to the spiritual and religious undertones that she implies. This re-purposing of the forgotten draws on the Christian beliefs of forgiveness, death, and life after death. The metal becomes an extension of the human form, and depicts both the fragility of life and the progress of mankind. She reminds the viewer that our own bodies function very similarly to machines and that, one day, we all become outdated, rust, and eventually advance. Placing a human subject alongside mechanical props in a natural setting makes it possible for Thoreson to explore mankind's relationship with machines, nature, and religion. These themes reoccur throughout all of Thoreson's images and serve as the underlying framework for her multiple photo series. The photos also speak on the complications, joys, and interconnections of personal relationships with others and with oneself. Each photo is created and presented as a manifestation of Thoreson's personal experiences. The series Baptism, for example, has direct correlation to her childhood experiences in the Southern Baptist Church, while Medic draws upon a personal medical trauma. Thoreson strives for her work to be a reflection of her life, a collection of her memories. Every installation, costume, and sculpture she creates is symbolic. She assimilates the shapes of the human form, predominantly female, as surrogates for these memories and themes. She works closely with the models and positions their bodies in ways that seem both natural and unnatural, in the hope of fabricating a subject that is physical and metaphysical in one. In doing this, she hopes that the audience will view the photograph as an experience and not just an image., Thoreson, Jennifer B. \\"Fine Art Women's Portraits with Jennifer Thoreson.\\" CreativeLive. CreativeLive, 15 July 2013. Web. 10 Mar. 2017. Body of work Thoreson's six major photo series are Medic, Flora, Traveler, Baptism, Testament, and Coming of Age. Each one is meant to exemplify a different stage in her life and therefore, each series has a different tone and color scheme. Artistic style Since her work is most concerned with portraying a message and telling a narrative, Thoreson's work fits into the genre of Conceptual/Fine-art photography most cleanly. Her inclusion of installment, staging, and editing creates images that almost resemble paintings and results in a mixed media piece. She takes elements of what is predominantly thought of as Fine Art, painting and sculpture, and applies it to photography. Her use of everyday objects borrows heavily from Marcel Duchamp and the concept of ready-made art, but her approach is significantly different. Awards and representation Jennifer Thoreson's photographs have received positive reception and she has accepted many awards for her works, with the most recent being the Howard Franks Memorial Scholarship, which she accepted in 2013. Thoreson was named the Critical Mass Book Award Winner and was presented the ICP Leadership Award Medallion in 2011. She was awarded the Kodak Gallery Award nine times between 2004‚Äì2008, and the Fuji Masterpiece Award ten times also between 2004-2008. Thoreson is also now represented by four major galleries across the United States: Verve Gallery of Photography in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Panopticon Gallery in Boston, MA, JDC Gallery in San Diego, CA, and Klompching Gallery in New York, NY.

The BCF has legal permission to work as a charitable non-governmental organization from both the Iraqi Government and the KRG. The BCF has been granted a Consultative Status at the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in the organization's meeting in April 2016. Barzani Charity Foundation has been named after the Kurdish leader Mustafa Barzani (1903‚Äì1979). The working philosophy of the foundation is based on a statement by Barzani where he says \\"It is a privilege to serve one's own people\\". The economic and social condition of the Kurdistan Region-Iraq have contributed in the establishment of the BCF. As by the time the BCF was founded in 2005 the Region was experiencing a new phase of the political and economic arena in Iraq. The post-2003 situation invited many corporate companies, governments and international NGOs to the region to contribute to the reconstruction process there. This has perhaps, contributed in the foundation of the BCF at the time. The post-2003 Iraq experienced massive displacements and migration both from within Iraq (as the result of armed conflict there) and outside Iraq, especially, the state of Syria (as the result of the armed conflict between the Syrian government and opposition parties). The large number of displaced and refugee people required swift response on the part of the Iraqi government, the KRG and NGOs and INGOs.

Szirma once was a village and has been part of Miskolc since 1950. Nowadays it is a peaceful and a family-friendly area with easy access to city centre.  Location  Szirma is located at the southeast corner of Miskolc and lies on a low area between river Hej≈ë and Saj√≥, near the edge of The Great Plain. It is 3 km (1.8m) away from the centre, which can be easily reached by local public transport, by bus 3. Szirma is also close to the M30 Motorway and the Park Center shopping centre.  History  Szirma was established during the Arpad-Era and it was first mentioned in a source from 1343. In fact, the source was rather related to a person, Mark Szirmai, who lived in the settlement with his family.T√≥th, P√©ter; dr.

Later in the 16th and 17th century the territory was under the rule of The Ottoman Empire. As a result of great floods, in 1674 the villagers had to leave the settlement. In the 18th century the population was still very small, there were only 72 houses in 1736. It was not until the 19th century, however, that the population began to grow. Earlier the village also had an important role in agriculture, supplying Miskolc with vegetables. Due to the area's geographical features, the garden suburb has excellent flat lands for cultivation. In 1950 Szirma was annexed to the city of Miskolc. Manor-house Around 1902-1903, an ornate manor house, the so-called Klein- Castle, was constructed by two famous architect, B√©la Lajta and √ñd√∂n Lechner. The monument was built in Art Nouveau style, which then belonged to the landowner, Mor Klein and his son Sandor Klein.

The scenery and costumes were created by L√©on Baskt. The first production opened at Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet in Paris on June 2, 1909. The ballet starred Anna Pavlova as Ta-hor and Ida Rubinstein as Cleopatra. Mikhail Fokine himself danced Amoun. The favourite slaves of Cleopatra were danced by Tamara Karsavina and Vaslav Nijinsky. Other characters included Servants of the Temple, Egyptian Dancers, Greeks, Satyrs, Jewish Dancers, Syrian Musicians and Slaves. Cyril W. Beaumont writes that Cl√©op√¢tre is a largely based on a ballet called Une Nuit d'√âgypte that was first produced by Fokine at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1908. The veil dance features Glinka's \\"Danse Orientale\\" from his opera Russlan and Ludmilla. \\"Danse Persane\\" from Mussogsky's Khovanchina was used as well.  History  L√©on Bakst‚Äôs set design for the 1909 Ballets Russes production of Cl√©op√¢tre The first performance of Cl√©op√¢tre was staged by Fokine in Russia. The ballet was presented as Une Nuit d‚ÄôEgypte, at the Mariinsky Theatre, St Petersburg on 2 March 1908. He used solely Arensky‚Äôs score for the entire show, and borrowed most of the costumes from The Pharaoh's Daughter and Aida. The soloist costumes were instead designed by L√©on Bakst, and the sets, borrowed from an opera performed at the time at the Mariinsky, were retouched by Oreste Allegri. The ballet was later represented in Paris at the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet on 2 June 1909 for the opening season of the Ballets Russes, produced by Serge Diaghilev. For this version, Fokine decided to cast Ida Rubinstein, one of his students, for the main role, and Alexandre Benois suggested L√©on Bakst for the sets and costumes design of the entire production. During a tour to Latin America in 1917, the sets were destroyed in a fire. Therefore, Diaghilev ordered new sceneries to Robert Delaunay, while his wife, Sonia Delaunay, designed the costumes for the new soloists Lubov Tchernicheva and Leonide Massine. The new production opened at the London Coliseum Theatre on 5 September 1918.  Plot  Set in Egypt, the ballet tells the story of two young lovers, Ta-Hor and Amoun. They meet in the grounds of a temple, when the high priest interrupts them, announcing the arrival of the Queen Cleopatra and her court. Amoun falls in love with the Queen‚Äôs beauty, and declares his love with a message. Cleopatra accepts to spend a night with him, but in return he must drink poison the following morning. Ta-Hor tries to dissuade Amoun, but his passion is too strong. The ballet closes with Ta-Hor going back to the temple, to find the dead body of her lover.  Production  L√©on Bakst, Costume of Cleopatra for Ida Rubinstein, 1909. Cl√©op√¢tre was the most sumptuous production in the Ballets Russes‚Äô 1909 season, due to the extraordinary design by Bakst. The dancers‚Äô bodies gave life to his reduced costumes, that glittered like precious stones against a scenery of desert and Egyptian architecture. He used gold, lapis blue, malachite green, pink, orange and violet to embellish the characters‚Äô costumes, jewels and weapons, imitating the motifs of what was believed to be Egyptian at the time.  Cast  For the Ballets Russes opening in 1909, the role of Cleopatra was interpreted by Ida Rubinstein. She was not a professional dancer, but her unconventional beauty and incredible sensuality strongly impressed the audience. In her first appearance in the ballet, she was carried in a mummy-case and sensually unwrapped from the many-colored veils. Amoun was played by Fokine himself, and Ta-Hor by Anna Pavlova.  Audience response  The costumes caused a sensation, since they presented several bare sections of the dancers‚Äô bodies. The artists were instead wearing ‚Äòfleshings‚Äô, a skin-colour silk or jersey inserts to shorten the time required for body make-up. This technique was used until 1912, but unfortunately most of these inserts didn‚Äôt survive, and don‚Äôt appear to be evident in any retouched stage photography of the time. Moreover, Cl√©op√¢tre, together with Scheherazade, started a new mania for exoticism in fashion and interior design. This ballet was revived by Diaghilev in 1918. References Au, Susan (2012).

Personal life  Castro Smith is from Miami, Florida, where she was raised in a Cuban-American family. She attended Brown University as an undergraduate student and later the Yale School of Drama, where she earned her MFA in acting. Previous to graduate school, she was a city schoolteacher. She lives in LA and is married to actor Joby Earle, whom she met at Yale.  Education  After receiving her BA from Brown, Castro Smith attended the Yale School of Drama for her Master's in Fine Arts (MFA). Although she was studying Acting, she wrote a play Estrella Cruz [the junkyard queen] that was produced at the Yale Cabaret, the student-run theatre. From this, Paula Vogel, head of the playwrighting program at the time, began to act as a mentor to her. After graduating, Castro Smith worked primarily as an actor until she was selected for the Van Lier Fellowship Program in 2012-2013 at the New Dramatists in New York. This led her to embrace playwriting as a career, which led to writing and producing for television.  Career  = Artistic inspiration = Many of Castro Smith's plays are comedic, relationship-focused, and often politically relevant. She notably wants to create more complex, dimensional roles for women on stage in leading roles. Her plays have been inspired by an eclectic mix of works, such as Shakespeare, South Park, Greek myths, and 1970s horror films. = Playwright career = In 2008, Castro Smith‚Äôs first play Estrella Cruz [The Junkyard Queen] was produced at the Yale Cabaret, and was later produced at the Ars Nova ANT Fest in New York City and at the Halcyon Theater in Chicago. The play is a Cuban- American twist of a Greek myth of the goddess Persephone set in the 21st century. In 2011, Smith's play Boomcracklefly was produced at the Milgaro Theater in Portland, Oregon. In 2014, her play The Hunchback of Seville was produced by the Washington Ensemble Theatre in Seattle. Acclaimed as a \\"gleefully revisionist riff on rampaging colonialism,\\" The Hunchback of Seville was inspired by Smith's interest in how Americans handle the history of Columbus and the massacres that resulted from his actions. The complex character of Queen Isabella stems from Smith's own desire to play Richard III in Shakespeare's Richard III. Smith's most produced work, Feathers and Teeth, was featured at the Goodman Theater‚Äôs New Stage Festival (2013-2014). Inspired by Hamlet, 1970s horror films, and Jon Ronson's book The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry, Feathers and Teeth centers on a 13-year- old girl who loses her mom and thinks her new step-mother is a demon. As with Smith's other plays, Feathers and Teeth features a complex, \\"crazy\\" female lead in an eccentric and comedic play. Ultimately, Smith's goal was to use horror as a way to help others understand the human experience of obsession and fear. The play was later produced at Artists Repertory Theatre in Portland, Oregon. Castro Smith's most recent work El Hurac√°n, featured at the DNA New Work Series at La Jolla Playhouse, is described as loosely connected to the ideas of Shakespeare's The Tempest. = Television Career = In 2015, Castro Smith made her television writing debut with the Lifetime series Devious Maids. In 2016 she served as both a writer and producer on the Fox television series The Exorcist, as well as writer and co-executive producer of the ABC pilot The Death of Sofia Valdez. https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4146781/ In 2018 she went on to serve as writer and supervising producer for the Netflix series The Haunting of Hill House. https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4146781/ And in 2019, Castro Smith wrote and co- executive produced the Starz series Sweetbitter. https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4146781/ = Films = Castro Smith will make her film debut in a Walt Disney Animation Studios film, tentatively titled Encanto, centered on a Colombian girl who lacks magical powers in spite of her family having them.

He is the author of a book, Polynomial Signal Processing and more than 170 technical papers, and is the inventor on ten patents. He has contributed to the development of adaptive nonlinear filters and performance analysis of adaptive filters. He has developed nonlinear signal processing approaches for image enhancement and mitigation of nonlinear distortions in audio. In recent years, he has focused on neuroprosthetic systems, where he is working on evoking movements in paralyzed limbs via functional neuromuscular stimulation and decoding movement intent of a person from neural and other biological signals. He has also been working on structural health monitoring for detecting and characterizing damage in composite aerospace structures using sensor signals.  Activities in IEEE Signal Processing Society  Mathews has been very active in the IEEE Signal Processing Society (SPS). He was the Vice President (Finance) of the IEEE Signal Processing Society during 2003-2005 and the Vice President (Conferences) of the Society during 2009-2011. As VP-Finance, he inherited a deficit budget from prior years and managed three consecutive years of balanced budgets while allocating substantial resources to improve and increase the Society‚Äôs publication activities. As VP-Conferences, he was instrumental in creating reduced conference rate structures for SPS members and student members, as well as working closely with the Publication Board to align the missions of the conferencing and publication activities of the Society. As VP-Conferences, he contributed substantially to the globalization of SPS.

After being defeated during the Battle of Munda, the younger Pompeius unsuccessfully attempted to flee Hispania Ulterior by sea, but was eventually forced to land. Pursued by Caesarian forces under Lucius Caesennius Lento, the Pompeians were cornered at a wooded hill near the town of Lauro, where most of them, including Pompeius the Younger, were killed in battle.  Background After the Battle of Munda, the badly wounded Pompeius fled to Carteia. The town was already embroiled in factional strife between local Pompeians and Caesarians, however, with the latter eventually launching a revolt, during which Gnaeus Pompeius was again wounded. The situation quickly turned against the Pompeians, whereupon they decided to board their remaining navy of twenty ships and escape to the sea. The Caesarian naval commander Gaius Didius, who was stationed at Gades, heard of the Pompeians' escape, and promptly set off in pursuit. Having left Carteia in great haste, Pompeius' men had not brought enough drinking water and thus were soon forced to land, allowing Didius to catch up with them after four days of sailing. The Caesarians attacked the Pompeian fleet at anchor, capturing some vessels and burning the rest, consequently trapping Pompeius and his followers in southern Spain.App. civ. 2.105  The battle  The Pompeians then attempted to flee over land, constantly pursued and harassed by Caesarian forces. In course of the flight, Pompeius the Younger was once more wounded, this time in the shoulder and left leg, so that his men had to carry him on a litter. The Pompeians eventually took refuge at a well defendable wooded hill near the town of Lauro, but they were discovered by a local, who reported them to the Caesarians. As result, Pompeius and his men were surrounded. The Caesarians, under command of Lucius Caesennius Lento, began to attack the Pompeian positions, but thanks to the natural conditions, the defenders were able to repulse multiple assaults. Thus thwarted, Lento's forces settled down to besiege and starve out the Pompeians. Recognizing this, the defenders resolved to try to break through the siege. When the Pompeians began their breakout attempt, heavy and brutal fighting ensued, with the escaping defenders suffering heavy casualties. Several Pompeians, many of them Lusitanians, actually managed to escape, but not Gnaeus Pompeius himself. Unable to walk due to his wounds and not transportable by horse or litter because of the local terrains' inaccessibility, he could not flee quickly enough and together with several of his followers remained behind. With many Pompeians either gone or killed, the Caesarians then launched a renewed assault against the Pompeian position and overran the remaining defenders. Gnaeus Pompeius fled into a cave, but was discovered after some captives betrayed his hiding place, and, despite his wounds, fought to the death.  Aftermath  Pompeius the Younger's head was then cut off and brought to Hispalis, where it was displayed to the local populace. Meanwhile, the Lusitanians who had escaped the battle rallied many of their tribal members and attacked the forces of Gaius Didius, who had set up a camp near the coast. Provoking Didius to sally out from his camp by setting fire to his landed ships, the Lusitanians ambushed and killed him and many of his men. Those who survived fled to their remaining ships and escaped to the sea. After Munda and Gnaeus Pompeius' death, Julius Caesar believed the Pompeians to be completely defeated in Spain, and consequently left only few forces there to mop up the remaining resistance when returning to Rome. Unlike his older brother, however, Sextus Pompey successfully evaded the Caesarian pursuers and actually rebuilt the Pompeian armies. By the time Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC, he had reconquered most of southern Spain for the Pompeian cause.

The name FIDYST is an acronym and means Fiber Dynamics Simulation Tool.  History  In 1995 the Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Mathematics started a research project in order to simulate the paper transport in a printing machine. The transport of papers in printing machines can be modelled as two-dimensional fluid-structure interaction problem. The equations describing the dynamics of the paper transport are derived from shell models based on continuum mechanics that are equivalent to rod models for fiber dynamics. In order to simulate nonwoven production processes the Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Mathematics extended the Cosserat rod models by a stochastic drag model for fibers in turbulent flows. FIDYST demonstrated its proof of concept 2007. At the EDANA Symposium 2007of International Nonwovens Symposium 2007 Website EDANA. 6. March 2017. the industrial company Oerlikon Neumag presented a new pilot plant where FIDYST had successfully been applied to increase the tenacity of the produced nonwoven. In 2012 the software code was ported from C to C++. 2014 the interaction of fibers with machinery parts was introduced in FIDYST. The latest release of FIDYST can simulate staple fibers.  Application  FIDYST simulates the dynamics of elastic, line shaped objects in a very general way. Hence, there is a broad spectrum of different applications for FIDYST. Of particular importance are production processes of technical textiles . With FIDYST engineers simulate * spunbond processes, * meltblown processes, and * airlay processes. The simulations of the fiber dynamics are used to optimize the geometry of the production plant and the operating conditions.

It is located near to the historic building Pita Kotte Gal Ambalama at the Pita Kotte junction on Kotte road. The temple has been formally recognised by the Government as an archaeological site in Sri Lanka. The designation was declared on 17 May 2013 under the government Gazette number 1811. History The history of Kotte Raja Maha Vihara dates back to the Kingdom of Kotte. During the reign of King Parakumbha VI (1415-1467) the construction of the temple was begun and completed in all aspects with the royal patronage. King built the temple closer to his royal palace, to doing the necessary duties to the Sangha community. During the Dutch presence in the country Kotte temple was completely destroyed by them. The temple was re-established in 1818 after the destroyed temple was found out by Ven. Pilane Buddha Rakkitha thero. However most of the constructions and artifacts of the original temple had been destroyed and taken away by the foreigners leaving only a few ruins at the place. It is said that only some ruins of the present Stupa, parts of Katharagama Devalaya, and some stone pillars were remained in the Vihara premises. =Literature= A portrait of Queen Victoria over the inner entrance door of the image house The Kotte Raja Maha Vihara is mentioned in Aththaragama Bandara Rajaguru's book Vihara Asna (Nam Potha), a Kandyan period compiled book about the important Buddhist centers in Sri Lanka. According to that book Kotte temple is described as Oth Pilima geya and Jayawardenepura Kotte Shanmuga Devalaya which are believed to be the image house with reclining Buddha at Kotte Vihara done by King Parakumbha VI and the Devalaya in front of it. Beside that the temple has also been described in the poetic literature (Sandesha Kavya) of the Kotte era. Murals The Kandyan era paintings The image house of Kotte Raja Maha Vihara consists of two chambers and the walls of inner chamber are adorned with Kandyan Era Frescoes. The outer chamber is seem to be constructed recently with modern frescoes. The inner chamber has two entrances, framed with sculpted Makara Thorana (Dragon arches). A portrait of the Queen Victoria has been painted over the right side entrance door in a framed portrait, accompanied by two lions. Dalada Perahera In every year a Perahera (a procession) is conducted in the Kotte Vihara, in memory of and to honour the Sacred Relic of the tooth of the Buddha as the kingdom of Kotte once abode the Sacred Tooth Relic. The Perahera was first started in 1415 by King Parakumbha VI under the counsel of Weedagama Maithree Thero. After the collapsed of Kotte Kingdom the Perahera function was stopped and again started in 1901 by Ven. Embulgama Wimalatissa Thero.

Taxidermy specimens contain a variety of organic materials, such as fur, bone, feathers, skin, and wood, as well as inorganic materials, such as burlap, glass, and foam. Due to their composite nature, taxidermy specimens require special care and conservation treatments for the different materials.  Types and uses  Example of a study skin Display with different examples of support forms Traditional taxidermy specimens are cleaned and preserved animal skins that have been mounted over a form.NatSCA. Taxidermy and Skins. Retrieved from http://www.natsca.org/taxidermy Full mounts are the entire specimen, while shoulder mounts only include the head, neck, and shoulders. Study skins are another form of taxidermy in which the skins of small mammals and birds are stuffed with cotton, wool, or synthetic fibers in order to support the skin and original body shape.Carter, D. & Walker, A. K. (1999). Chapter 1: Vertebrates. Care and Conservation of Natural History Collections. Retrieved from http://www.natsca.org/care-and-conservation These are typically used by researchers rather than put on display. Taxidermy has a robust history, and specimens can be found in a number of public and private institutions, as well as personal collections. Natural history museums, zoos, science & nature centers, historic houses, art museums, and children's museums are examples of institutions that may have taxidermy specimens in their collections.Troublesome Trophies and Fragile Feathered Friends: Introduction to the Care of Historic Taxidermy webinar. Retrieved from http://www.connectingtocollections.org/troublesome-trophies-and-fragile- feathered-friends-introduction-to-the-care-of-historic-taxidermy/ While it may not be necessary to conserve mounts or skins of commonly occurring animals beyond educational use,National Park Service Museum Handbook, Part I: Museum Collections. Retrieved from https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/mushbkI.html some taxidermy mounts represent extinct or critically endangered species. The Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History houses Martha, the last passenger pigeon and a some collections still have Great Auk specimens, a bird species that went extinct in 1844.  Causes of deterioration  As with other types of collections, taxidermy specimens are susceptible to agents of deterioration, including pests, lights, temperature, humidity, and custodial neglect. Improper storage, display, and handling of taxidermy specimens can lead to many of these causes of deterioration. = Pest damage = Pests, such as dermestid beetles, clothes moths, and rodents, can cause damage to taxidermy specimens by eating materials and leaving larvae husks behind. Dermestid beetles in particular can digest keratin and will feed on hair, horns, and feathers. Signs of a pest infestation in taxidermy include small piles of dust (known as frass) underneath a specimen and shedding skin from growing larvae.NatSCA and ICON. Care and Conservation of Zoological Specimens. Retrieved from http://natsca.org/sites/default/files/publications-full/care-and-conservation- of-zoological-specimens.pdf Additional signs of an infestation include chewing marks, loss of hair, fur, or feathers on mounts, webbing, and fecal pellets or stains.National Park Service Conserve O Gram. Identifying Museum Insect Pest Damage. Retrieved from https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/03-11.pdf = Environmental damage =  Pollutants  Over time, taxidermy specimens can accumulate layers of dust, dirt, and other airborne pollutants, especially if they are house on open shelving or display. Additionally, cases and containers made of unstable materials can off gas pollutants, such as H2s, SO2, formaldehyde, peroxides, and organic acids, which can damage the surfaces of taxidermy.Standards in the Care of Skins and Taxidermy Collections. Retrieved from http://conservation.myspecies.info/node/32  Light  Fading of fur, feathers, and skins is almost exclusively caused by improper lighting conditions, such as long-term exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. UV light can come from both natural and artificial lighting sources.  Temperature  Specimens may lose fur or feathers when exposed to warm environments because the high temperature causes residual fats in skins to release.  Humidity  Taxidermy specimens are especially susceptible to fluctuations in humidity due to their composite materials. Relative humidity fluctuations below 40% can cause greater damage than fluctuations above 40%. Dry environments with low humidity may cause de-lamination or cracking in horns, bones, and turtle shells. Additionally, dry environments can cause skins and leathers to contract and shrink over the support form, which eventually leads to cracking and splitting. High humidity and moist environments can promote mold growth and attract pests. Bones will contract and swell due to humidity fluctuations, which may lead to cracking and splitting. This may lead to further structural damage if the bones are used as support within the specimen. = Damage caused by humans =  Improper handling  Breakage of appendages is likely to occur if specimens are not properly handled. Bird specimens are especially susceptible to breaking at the neck, while mammals‚Äô ears tend to be the first component to break or become disfigured.  Packing and shipping  Given their unique shape and form, taxidermy specimens can be difficult to ship and if not packed properly, can be easily damaged. Ears, necks, and birds‚Äô beaks can break or bend during shipment if not properly supported.  Theft and vandalism  Rhinoceros specimen with missing horn due to theft Some taxidermy specimens are vulnerable to direct damage by humans, especially if the species is associated with a valuable body part. Thieves may opt to take only part of a taxidermy specimen, which can impact the structural integrity of the entire specimen. = Inherent vice = Sometimes taxidermy specimens are susceptible to damage that is difficult to avoid and inherent to the nature of taxidermy. Metals, such as nickel and copper, used in support structures and forms can react to fatty acids in skins and cause corrosion. Gravity can also negatively impact taxidermy specimens by pulling unsupported components, such as tails and horns, away from the main structure, thus causing tears and breaks. Gravitational damage typically occurs with specimens on display, where support structures are not part of a diorama or case. However, hanging study skins in storage experience a gravitational pull that causes stretching and tearing of the skins.  Hazardous materials in taxidermy  Before extensive handling, hands-on display use or conservation treatments are carried out, it is important to test taxidermy specimens for hazardous materials. Arsenic, mercury, naphthalene, para-dichlorobenzene, asbestos, and DDT are all commonly found in taxidermy collections.American Museum of Natural History. Residual Pesticides. Retrieved from http://www.amnh.org/our-research/natural-science- collections-conservation/general-conservation/health-safety/residual- pesticides These chemicals were used to treat skins during preparation and helped reduce mold and pest damage. However, they can cause serious health concerns and illness in humans. Conservators may test for the presence of these hazardous materials in order to determine the appropriate course of treatment. In addition to testing, conservators may also review museum records, inspect specimens, or examine storage areas to determine what hazardous materials may be present.  Conservation and restoration treatments  Treatments should be carried out by conservators or qualified taxidermists. Some taxidermists have experience working with museums and can coordinate with conservators to preserve specimens. When cleaning specimens, it is necessary to wear protective gear such as nitrile gloves, dust masks, eye protection, and lab coats. = Basic cleaning = Taxidermy specimens can gather dirt and dust over time and may only need basic remedial treatments to be conserved. Basic cleaning can be done on a regular basis to help keep specimens in good condition.  Fur  Example of fur on a tiger specimen Fur may be gently cleaned with a soft-bristled brush or comb, which will help loosen particulates that have built up. A vacuum with a soft brush attachment will also work to remove dust and dirt. For particularly dirty furs, conservators may opt to wash the specimen's fur with water and a mild detergent or soap. If a mount has been exposed to fire and is covered with fine soot, a smoke sponge may be used to wipe down the fur. Some taxidermists promote cleaning of fur with furniture polish, however, this method will cause wax to build up and eventually dull the color of the fur.Carolina Conservation blog. Cleaning Taxidermy. Retrieved from https://carolinaconservation.wordpress.com/tag/cleaning-taxidermy/  Feathers  A variety of feathers are present on some bird specimens (Great Blue Heron pictured) Dust and dirt can accumulate on feathers and can be cleaned manually. The preferred methods are gentle brushing with a soft bristled brush or pinpoint vacuuming through a screen. These methods will leave the feathers in good condition in their natural alignment. However, solvents may be needed to clean feathers if dust is held in place by grease, which can leach out of skins. Distilled water may be used if dry methods fail, but more stubborn dust may need to be cleaned with non-denatured 70% ethanol. However, solvents may strip natural oils in feathers and leave them brittle.Shelton, S. (1996). Cleaning Mounted Birds. Retrieved from http://cool.conservation-us.org/byform/mailing-lists/cdl/1996/1168.html  Skin  Exposed skin on a mount, such as noses, mouths, or birds‚Äô feet, may be cleaned with a soft microfiber cloth or brush. Some birds‚Äô feet may be artificially colored and will not react well if solvents are applied.  Bone, horns and antler objects  Horns that are starting to crack may be treated with conservation-grade beeswax polish that will help protect against dehydration. Beaks are another component of taxidermy specimens that are typically artificially colored and should only be cleaned with brushes and soft clothes.  Glass components  Taxidermy specimens have glass eyes that can be gently cleaned with glass cleaner. = Repair and restoration techniques = If a taxidermy specimen has been significantly damaged, conservators may have to use more thorough and sometimes invasive techniques to restore them. These techniques can help to stabilize the specimen's condition while also restoring the appearance to be more scientifically accurate. Before undertaking any repairs, conservators use a variety of imaging techniques, such as photography and x-rays, to get a good idea of the structure and level of damage of the specimen.  Structural repair  Fill materials may be used on taxidermy specimens to correct areas of loss. It is important that the specimen is in stable condition because many fill materials have drawbacks that can further damage the specimen. Fills typically consist of a backing made of inert fabric combined with a resin, starch, or cellulose ether.Nieuwenhuizen, L. (1998). Synthetic Fill Materials for Skins, Leathers, and Furs. Retrieved from http://cool.conservation- us.org/jaic/articles/jaic37-01-010.html For example, bird specimens that have been badly damaged by pests may be repaired with a mixture of synthetic fabrics and wheat starch. This mixture is used to infill areas of loss and feathers are replaced where possible with a wheat starch paste adhesive. In addition to infilling, taxidermy specimens may require structural repairs. Small specimens that have experienced loss of a head or appendage, a new wire armature may be inserted into the specimen in order to remount the broken piece. Adhesive can be used to further secure the broken piece to its original body.Horniman Museum and Gardens. Conserving Our Taxidermy. Retrieved from http://www.horniman.ac.uk/collections/conserving-our-taxidermy  Recoloring fur  A relatively recent development in taxidermy restoration, metal complex dyes have been used to recolor fur. The American Museum of Natural History performed extensive research and tests using these dyes to recolor the furs of taxidermy specimens during the restoration of the Hall of North American Mammals. Many of the dyes have a high lightfastness and are more resistant to fading. When applied to fur, they also allow for a more natural look and feel. Another major benefit to using dyes, as opposed to acrylic paints, to recolor fur is they are reversible. The dyes can be reduced or entirely removed with application of ethanol. Research is still being done into the dyes‚Äô lightfastness and fixability, as well as whether or not they cause the fur to degrade over time.In Their True Colors blog.

Retrieved from http://dmca.yalecollege.yale.edu/news/3d-printing-restoring-museum-exhibitions  Pest treatments  Pests may be treated with a number of methods, including freezing, insecticide, or anoxia. These treatments help kill off adults and larvae, though specimens may require additional cleaning and stabilization after these treatments are performed.  Preventive care and maintenance  In order to prolong the life of a taxidermy specimen, it is necessary for museums and conservators to implement preventive care and maintenance strategies. These strategies help protect specimens from damage caused by humidity, temperature, pests, humans, and more. = Proper storage and display conditions = One of the most effective ways to prevent damage from occurring to taxidermy collections is to establish a monitoring system or procedure that routinely checks the condition of specimens. When not on display, taxidermy specimens should be housed in well-sealed cabinets or cases. Metal cabinets may be made of aluminum and/or stainless steel with an epoxy powder coating and are effective at preventing pest and light damage. Wood cabinets can provide better protection from fluctuations in relative humidity, though they off-gas chemicals that may damage collections. Though it is essential for cabinets and cases to be well-sealed, they should also allow for minimal airflow to prevent off-gassed chemicals or humidity from building up inside the container. For taxidermy specimens housed on open shelving, a polythene sheet can provide temporary protection from pollutants, though dust may accumulate electrostatically (2). Controlled lighting conditions with UV filters are important for reducing fading in taxidermy specimens. Specimens should be regularly rotated in order to reduce light damage. 50-100 lux is the recommended light exposure for taxidermy, though some types of feathers are susceptible to damage at 50 lux. The maximum annual exposure levels for biological specimens, feathers, fur, and leather is 180,000 lux hours. In the span of one year, a taxidermy mount will fade half as much if displayed in low light compared to the same conditions in high light. Ideal relative humidity conditions for taxidermy specimens are 40% minimum and 55% maximum. An integrated pest management system is important to manage and monitor pests that can damage collections. = Proper handling = Proper handling techniques are essential to protect specimens from damage. Conservators will inspect taxidermy specimens for signs of weakness or detachable parts before moving the object. It is important for anyone handling taxidermy to remove jewelry, such as watches, rings, or bracelets, that may scratch or snag parts of the specimen. If the taxidermy specimen is mounted on a base or in a tray, it is preferred to only handle the base or tray while moving the object, rather than the specimen itself. Conservators will also use a secondary support, such as padding, to support the taxidermy specimen while in transit.American Museum of Natural History. Specimen Handling Checklist. Retrieved from http://www.amnh.org/our-research/natural-science-collections- conservation/general-conservation/preventive-conservation Wearing nitrile gloves while handling specimens will help prevent oil and perspiration transfer. = Packing and shipping = Bases of taxidermy mounts should be affixed to a shipping container with screws, straps, staples or tapes, with light and loose packing materials supporting the specimen's structure. This keeps the specimen stable during shipment, and informs the receiver which way the specimen is oriented within the container. Additionally, polystyrene or polyethylene bags may be used to cover taxidermy specimens during shipment.  Notable Examples  = American Museum of Natural History mammal hall = Alaska moose diorama at the American Museum of Natural History in 2012, after restoration In 2011-2012, the American Museum of Natural History undertook the restoration of 43 dioramas in its Bernard Family Hall of North American Mammals.

Retrieved from http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent-exhibitions/mammal-halls/bernard- family-hall-of-north-american-mammals In order to restore the taxidermy mounts and specimens, conservators removed smaller animals from the dioramas and built temporary scaffolding around larger animals, such as the 500-pound bison. Many of the larger mounts are affixed to their diorama case and could not easily be moved without risking further damage. One of the main goals of the project was to bring back scientific accuracy to the specimens, including their fur coloring. The museum's conservators tested and developed a new method of treatment for recoloring furs that uses metal dyes instead of traditional materials, such as paints and hair dyes. Other details of specimens were updated and restored - the cougar's whiskers were replaced with porcupine quills to give the face a fuller appearance and veins were added to the antelope jackrabbit's ears to give a realistic appearance. In order to protect the restored taxidermy specimens and dioramas, UV-filtered lights were installed throughout the mammal hall.Scientific America. New Technology for Old Dioramas.

Bar Masih became a monk at the Monastery of Mar Mattai and later supported Theodore bar Wahbun, an illegitimate patriarch who led a faction within the church that were displeased with Michael I Rabo, Patriarch of Antioch and head of the Syriac Orthodox Church, and his strict implementation of church canons. In 1189, Bar Masih travelled to Mardin, the patriarchal see, and bribed Abu al-Qasim Hasan, the governor of Amid, for his permission to seize control of the see and ordain Theodore Bar Wahbun as patriarch. Bishop Ibrahim of Amid, a supporter of Bar Wahbun, was sent to deliver the news to Bar Wahbun, but Hasan's death and succession by his son forced the faction to offer a larger bribe to Hasan's son. The Syriac Orthodox community of Amid protested to the new governor who agreed to expel Bar Wahbun and his supporters if Michael I met with him. Upon discovering Michael I was to travel to Amid, Bar Masih and the other faction members seized the diocesan church of Mardin and ordained Bar Wahbun as patriarch at night, and fled to Mosul in the morning. At Mosul, Bar Wahbun and Bar Masih unsuccessfully attempted to convince John IV Sarugoyo, Maphrian of the East, to support Bar Wahbun, and subsequently travelled throughout Upper Mesopotamia until their capture at Dara. They were taken to the Monastery of Mar Barsoum where they were condemned by the patriarch and a council of bishops. Bar Wahbun and Bar Masih escaped from the monastery and Bar Masih travelled to Tagrit, aiming to usurp the maphrianate. The death of John IV in 1189 left the seat of maphrian vacant, and Bar Masih gained the support of Muhyi al-Din, a Muslim judge of Mosul responsible for collecting tribute from local monasteries, such as the Monastery of Mar Mattai, and key adviser to the governor of Mosul. He also levied the support of the archimandrite, several monks of the Monastery of Mar Mattai, Ignatius Gabriel Yuhanna bar Hindi, Bishop of Urmia, Yuhanna Ruwad Marqia, Bishop of Ba‚Äôarbaya, Saliba, Bishop of the Monastery of Mar Mattai, and Basilius Matta bar Shuwayk, bishop of Baghdad. The Syriac Orthodox communities of Mosul and Tagrit informed Michael I they would not acknowledge Bar Masih as maphrian, and he ordained his nephew Jacob as maphrian at the Monastery of Mar Dumit in 1189, upon which he took the name Gregorius. Bar Masih bribed the governor of Mosul and was ordained as maphrian by his supporters at the Monastery of Mar Mattai, assuming the name Dionysius. The death of Muhyi al-Din soon after allowed the Syriac Orthodox population of Mosul to petition Mujahid al-Din to allow Gregorius Jacob to take his seat at Mosul, as he had been barred from the city of Muhyi al-Din. Mujahid al-Din complied and Bar Masih travelled to Tagrit, where he was rejected by the Syriac Orthodox Christians there, and returned to Mosul. Bar Masih was defrocked and imprisoned upon his return to Mosul; he remained imprisoned for a year before his brother paid 400 dinars for his release. In 1193, Bar Masih bribed the governor of Mosul 1000 dinars thus allowing him to proclaim himself Bishop of Mosul, and he unsuccessfully attempted to gather followers in the surrounding region. Bar Masih defaulted on his debts and was imprisoned for 18 months until Gregorius Jacob had him released from prison. Bar Masih repaid a portion of his debts a year after his release, but was later imprisoned in 1199 and granted release with the aid of Gregorius Jacob. Unable to repay his huge debts, he fled from Mosul to Mardin, then to Amid, and then to Miyafarqin. Bar Masih arranged for himself to become a bishop with the help of the governor, but was condemned by a church council. Athanasius VIII absolved Bar Masih, who died on 24 December 1204, and was buried by Nestorians, a rival Christian church, as the Syriac Orthodox community refused to bury him.

Built in 1876, it is a distinctive local example of Stick Style architecture, and has served the town as a schoolhouse and community meeting place for most of its existence. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history Centennial Hall stands on the northeast side of the triangular town green of North Hampton, formed in part by the junction of Post Road (New Hampshire Route 151) and New Hampshire Route 111. It is set facing west, just west of the south-facing Congregational church. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a truncated hip roof and clapboarded exterior. It has a three- bay facade, with the center bay projecting slightly and rising to an open belfry and pyramidal cap. The roof eaves are adorned with decorative brackets, and the front of the upper portion of the tower has applied wood work in the Stick Style. Windows on the ground floor are set under jigsawn bracketed gables, and their lintels also have small brackets. The main entrance is sheltered by a hip roof portico that is fronted by a Stick style gable. The hall was built in 1875-76, with funds donated by John W. F. Hobbs, a native son who made his fortune in Boston. The building was intended to provide new school facilities for two of the town's school districts, which then had old and overcrowded facilities. Land for the building was donated by the adjacent church. The school facilities were located on the ground floor, with a meeting hall on the second floor. A dining area was later added to the attic level. The building housed elementary and junior high students until 1949. From the 1950s to the 1980s the building was used for light industrial purposes, which brought conflict after the building was zoned into residential area. In 1998 the building was acquired by a local nonprofit organized for its preservation.

Overview  Papyrus was used in the making of writing material in ancient Egypt, where it was used from ancient times until the 10th century CE. The species of papyrus used in the creation of the writing materials is Cyperus papyrus.  Storage for papyrus materials There are various methods to safely store papyrus collections. However, the storage conditions do not change. = Conditions = It is important to store papyri within a climate-controlled room in which the temperature and humidity are maintained at a constant level of 17-23 degrees Celsius and 50-60 percent, respectively. It is also important to place a special kind of film or glass which protects the cases holding the papyri from UV lights, which could make papyri fade away if they are exposed to these lights. = Methods = There are various methods for storing papyri. The first and most common of these is to use two frames of glass and seal the edges with cloth tape. However, this method presents many risks to the object. One of these risks is this method opens the door for the object to be in contact with heat and moisture, which would also make the object's surface to stick to the glass. Another method is using the Stabiltex Sling System, which is a much safer method to store papyrus fragments. This storage method consists the use of a double-windowed mat with two sheets of Stabiltex covering the object. A third method for storing papyri, especially for oversized papyri, is placing the papyrus between two layers of plexiglass and then securing them with an aluminum frame cut to the size to support the piece. = Threats = Papyrus collections face threats to their well-being. These threats range from biological in nature to man-made.  Insects and other biological threats  Insects have been known to damage papyri. The damage takes place when the papyrus is rolled. In ancient times, a material called cedrium was used. Cedrium is a resinous extract from juniper, which stopped bookworms from attacking papyrus scrolls. Cedar oil was also used to stop bookworms in ancient times. There are also certain species of fungi which specifically attack papyri. As organic materials, papyri are also susceptible to mold. Deterioration  A common threat to papyrus materials is deterioration. This threat has been occurring both in ancient and modern times. In ancient times, deterioration occurred when the papyrus was used extensively, which is especially the case for medical papyri and other papyri of a similar nature. In modern times, deterioration in papyri occurs from a long process of ageing, the breaking down of the components of the papyrus as well as the conditions where the papyrus is stored/found. Another cause for deterioration among papyri is oxidation, which occurs from the use of iron- gall ink, which contains iron sulphate, which has been known to damage papyri. Salts  Salts, if accumulated on a papyrus scroll, could potentially damage it. A papyrus scroll can be contaminated with salts from the site where it was found, which is especially the case for areas with a high degree of moisture. However, salt on papyri can also occur in stable environments.  Methods of storage  Methods of storage, if done incorrectly, can also damage papyri. The traditional method in papyrus storage was to place the papyri between two sheets of glass and then seal the edges with cloth tape. This threatens the papyrus inside since it allows the object to come into direct contact with the glass, which could cause heat and moisture to come into contact with the papyrus. This could make the papyrus stick to the glass. This could also damage the ink and the surface of the papyrus when the glass is removed. A grayish material, which has been identified as a composite of sodium chloride and traces of vegetable carbohydrates, was seen around the edges of some papyri. Other storage methods which use cellulose nitrate, paper backing, drumming techniques, hinges, adhesive mounts, dry mount systems and plexiglass which presses directly on the papyrus are not considered safe methods of storage. The threats from these include introducing materials which could stain the artifact, degrading the object or placing pressure on the object. These effects are also not easily reversed. = Restoration methods = Restoring papyri has been around since ancient times. Across the centuries, more modern methods have been used. In this section, both ancient and modern techniques for restoring papyri will be examined.  Ancient methods  Restoring damaged papyri has been going on since ancient times. Indeed, one method that seems to have been used then was to add fresh strips of papyrus to the papyrus scroll. An example of this is seen with the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus. This images shows part of the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus. The bright sections of the papyrus seem to show parts which would have been restored in ancient times using fresh strips of papyrus  Modern methods for conserving and restoring papyri Papyri can be restored using various methods in modern times. These methods differ based on the condition of the papyrus. = Preparation of a papyrus for conservation = There are several steps that need to be taken before restoring a papyrus. The first step is to first remove any remaining soil and dirt particles on the papyrus piece. After this, the next step is to document the papyrus scroll as accurately as possible. This step is especially important if the papyrus is in fragments. Then, the ink on the papyrus should be examined by pouring an eye drop of water onto the papyrus itself. This step is repeated using either ethanol or an ethanol/water mixture. Old repairs and tape can also damage a papyrus piece, so it is crucial that these are removed. One method of removing these is to first dampen the papyrus itself so the old tapes can be removed safely. This papyrus has been fixed using tape. The tape can be seen on the top and bottom of the papyrus = Restoring a papyrus = There are various methods which are used to restore damaged papyri, which may depend on the type of the damage on the papyrus. For example, if the ink on the papyrus has been damaged, then a very thin methyl cellulose or wheat starch paste is to be applied beneath the papyrus via a fine sable brush. If there is a mold attack, then a method which seems to work is to remove the mold via a spatula and then brush the contaminated area with a solution that is 50% water and 50% ethanol. Sometimes, a cellulose solution, which can be either Klucel or Hydroxypropyl Celluloid, is used to strengthen cell tissue and the vascular bundles. Other materials such as papyrus juice and gum arabic can be used for the same reason as the cellulose solutions. A method that is used to treat papyri is to clean repeatedly. This is achieved by first placing the papyrus on dry blotting paper, and then cleaning the papyrus by removing the dirt via a scalpel, spatula or dry tweezers. Mechanical cleaning of the papyrus can also be done, after placing the papyrus on the dry blotting paper, via the use of a bristle brush to lightly brush the papyrus. A damp papyrus must be placed under a light weight to dry. These cleaning methods can be used repeatedly until the papyrus is fully treated. After restoring the papyrus, tweezers can be used to align papyrus fragments in place. Then, the papyrus is remounted using either the Stabiltex Sling system or the Polyester Sling system.  Restoring recycled papyri  In ancient times, used papyri were often used in the creation of cartonnage coffins. The papyri used in the creation of these coffins were cut or torn and then dampened with water so they can fit into the cartonnage piece in which they were placed. Then, they were stuck together with either plaster or glue. A layer of lime gesso plaster was used on both sides of the papyrus. An image of the deceased was often painted on the front of the cartonnage. To conserve the paintings and the papyri within, any loose dirt is to be removed and the painted surface cleaned with acetone. If there are any holes in the painted gesso, then calcium carbonate is used to block these holes. The paint layer is fixed with Paraloid B-48, which contains 30 percent acetone. The layer of paint is faced with a temporary piece of cartonnage using: (a) one layer of Japanese tissue paper (about 50 grams) & Paraloid B-48/acetone emulsion (20 percent), (b) two layers of Japanese paper (about 70 grams) and a Planatol BB/water dilution (40 percent), (c) one layer of linen cloth and a Planatol BB/water dilution (40 percent) and one layer of Japanese paper (about 70 grams) and a Planatol BB/water emulsion (40 percent). The negative form of the object is then placed in either fluid polyurethane (if the object is three-dimensional) or water (60 degrees Celsius). To remove the inner layer of gesso, it is dampened in water and then removed with a brush. Then the papyrus cartonnage is removed from behind with a scalpel. To loosen the pieces of papyrus within, the cartonnage is placed in a hot water bath (90 degrees Celsius) for a few minutes. Acid is then placed in the water to help in loosening the pieces of papyrus in the gesso. After this, the papyrus pieces are de-acidified. The papyri are then separated mechanically with tweezers and scalpel. Using blotting paper, the papyri fragments are dried via sheets of blotting paper. Using Paraloid B-48 (20 percent in acetone), the painting and its gesso layer are consolidated from the back. The object is then backed by a new cartonnage support consisting of Japanese paper (70-90 grams), linen cloth and a Planatol BB/water dilution (40 percent). The negative form of the third-dimensional object is removed mechanically. The temporary-facing support is removed with tweezers and brush by using acetone. Using a brush and acetone, the painted surface is cleaned. The dry papyri are cleaned with a brush. Using a brush, tweezers and palette knives, the papyrus fragments are cleaned by sandwiching them between pieces of wet cloth or blotting paper. This will mark the final removal of any remaining gesso pieces. The papyrus fragments are dried between sheets of blotting paper while under pressure. Then the papyrus fragments are stored between glass plates.  Restoring carbonized papyri  Carbonized papyri are papyri that have been charred. There seems to be one method for restoring charred papyri. The first step of this method is to carefully separate the layers of the papyrus since they cannot be unrolled due to their condition. This separation is done with either a thin palette knife or a scraper and lifting them with tweezers. Sometimes, dampening the layers is done to speed up the process of separation. In the event that the pieces are very fragile, Japanese paper is used to loosen and lift the layers, but only if the back of the papyrus does not contain any writing. Another method is to use a dilution of water and glue to fix the layers from the back. After separating the layers one by one, the pieces in the individual layer are placed together according to the writing on the front of the papyrus. Then the layer is turned over in order to stabilize it from the back, which can be only achieved if the back of the papyrus is does not have any writings. If this is the case, then the pieces cannot be consolidated, unless they are between the inscribed lines. However, this latter process is done only sometimes and with extreme care. A great method of reconstructing a layer of carbonized papyri is to use Japanese Tissue paper and a sheet of glass, on which to place the layer. Then a layer of wax paper or plastic paper is placed over the whole reconstruction and then cover that with a glass plate. This step is done to ease the process of turning the papyrus layers over. Through the use of a thin paintbrush and letting the glass plate slide step-by-step, the carbonized layer is strengthened by carefully applying the diluted adhesive through the Japaneses paper from the back. To avoid air bubbles, the whole back must be glued. It is also important not to let the adhesive seep into the papyrus since this will form a reflective surface on the front of the papyrus, which will render the ink on the front of the papyrus invisible. The reinforced papyrus can be turned over by grasping the Japanese paper.

Fortifications existing in 2017, as well as demolished in 21st century, are shown. Initially, the rampart surrounded all the plateau, and the base of the hill was bordered by a wide moat with one more rampart (their remains were seen beneath the southwestern slope at least in 1970). Institute of Archaeology of Ukrainian Academy of Sciences on the Khotiv hillfort in April 2016. Khotiv hillfort is a hillfort of early Iron Age (Scythian times, 6 century BC) in the village of Khotiv, Ukraine. The hillfort adjoins the southern part of Kyiv, namely Feofaniya Park. It occupies a rhombic plateau 1000x700 m wide, bordered by valleys of the streams. All the plateau area, 31 ha, was surrounded with earth rampart, while the slope of the hill was fortified by a scarp with a berm and a moat beneath. The rampart, scarp and berm are well preserved on the western and eastern edges, and remains of the moat are much less conspicuous now. It is supposed that the hillfort had 3 entrances: in the northern, eastern and southern part of the rampart. Khotiv hillfort has the status of an archaeological monument since 1965.–ü–æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∞ –†–∞–¥–∏ –ú—ñ–Ω—ñ—Å—Ç—Ä—ñ–≤ –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–æ—ó –†–°–† –≤—ñ–¥ 21 –ª–∏–ø–Ω—è 1965 —Ä. ‚Ññ 711 \\"–ü—Ä–æ –∑–∞—Ç–≤–µ—Ä–¥–∂–µ–Ω–Ω—è —Å–ø–∏—Å–∫—É –ø–∞–º'—è—Ç–Ω–∏–∫—ñ–≤ –º–∏—Å—Ç–µ—Ü—Ç–≤–∞, —ñ—Å—Ç–æ—Ä—ñ—ó —Ç–∞ –∞—Ä—Ö–µ–æ–ª–æ–≥—ñ—ó –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–æ—ó –†–°–†\\" In 2007, official borders of the monument were cut down, and in 2009, the excluded areas became the place of house building. The northern part of the hillfort was demolished by building of a palace of Ukrainian billionaire Yuri Kosiuk. Later, the works began in the southern and eastern parts of the hillfort, which are planned for building too. Exploration The first scientific mention of the hillfort was made in 1848 by Ivan Fundukley, governor of Kyiv and notable historian. He mentions a local legend about some town which existed there.–§—É–Ω–¥—É–∫–ª–µ–π –ò. –ò. –û–±–æ–∑—Ä–µ–Ω–∏–µ –º–æ–≥–∏–ª, –≤–∞–ª–æ–≤ –∏ –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–∏—â –ö–∏–µ–≤—Å–∫–æ–π –≥—É–±–µ—Ä–Ω–∏–∏. ‚Äî –ö., 1848. ‚Äî –°. 36.

A broken stone dish and fragment of a stone axe or hammer, sling stones, sharpening stone with a hole, bone handle of an unknown tool, beads made of lead and yellow glass, as well as other things were also unearthed. Bronze finds include a snake-like ring, pins, including nail-like ones, and arrowheads of various forms. Iron objects include knives, awls, pin and some arrowheads. Another notable find is a bone plate with carving of a panther or a leopard in the Scythian animal style. Size of the plate is 4.7x1.8 cm. It could be a part of a bigger thing, e.g. a spoon or a mirror handle. Associated ceramics and arrowheads indicate that it belongs to the end of 6th century BC. Such carvings are rare on Scythian bone things, although more common on metallic ones. Plenty of animal bones imply that dwellers of the hillfort bred domestic animals, predominantly horses. Pigs, cows, sheep, goats and dogs were also held. Dominance of horses differs Khotiv hillfort from other hillforts of forest steppe, which were dominated by cattle or pigs. Its inhabitants hunted wild boars, deers, elks, bears and beavers, sometimes aurochs and hares. Sporadic bones of turtles, foxes, geese, ducks, crows and men were found. Finds from the hillfort date from Scythian times, approximately 6, or, according to other researchers, 6 to 5 century BC. It was probably founded by people called Scythians-tillers by Herodotus. They were not Scythians in the strict sense, but they stayed under Scythian dominion and partially adopted their culture.–¢–µ–ª–µ–≥–∏–Ω –î. –Ø. –¢–∞–º, –≥–¥–µ –≤—ã—Ä–æ—Å –ö–∏–µ–≤. ‚Äî –ö., –ù–∞—É–∫–æ–≤–∞ –î—É–º–∫–∞, 1982. ‚Äî –°. 71-78. Founders of the hillfort were nonmigratory. They practised agriculture and animal breeding, especially horse breeding. Hunting played a big role. Trade with Ancient Greek colonies was less intensive than on other hillforts of forest steppe. It is explained by larger distance.

In 1786, during secularization reform of Catherine the Great, the hillfort passed to the use of Khotiv inhabitants. From this time, it was covered by fields and gardens. Agricultural works, which lasted on the hillfort over 200 years, did not ruin the fortifications, but damaged the archaeological horizon.Statement about the condition of archaeological monument of national significance \\"Khotiv hillfort in the borders of the fortifications of Scythian times\\" (based on the order of Kiev City State Administration from 17.05.2002 —Ä. ‚Ññ 979).

She fell foul of the authorities after 1933 because she had already been critical of the Nazi Party in print and then, after the Nazis took power, got into the habit of writing to senior army commanders and others in the public eye, advocating the overthrow of Hitler. She died early in January 1946 as a result of mistreatment suffered in German jails between 1937 and 1944.  Biography  Margarete Adam came from a traditional German family, and was a committed Roman Catholic. She studied Philosophy. During the 1920s she contributed articles to Die Frau, at that time Germany's leading feminist magazine. She received her doctorate from Hamburg University in 1925, after which she accepted a teaching position with the university. In 1929 she wrote an essay, published early in 1930 by the National Association of Jewish Citizens of Jewish Faith, in which she asserted that no government, even the most anti-semitic one, would gain popular support for the disenfranchisement of Jews as citizens, concluding that anti-semitism was bound to decline and philo-semitism to grow.\\"Der Weg des Antisemitismus verlauft abwarts, der des Philosemitismus aber aufwarts. Allem um Allem zum Trotz!\\" A compounding poignant irony followed towards the end of 1930 when she admitted that she had been one of thousands of women who had voted for the Nazi Party in 1930. She had done this, she wrote, only after much soul searching, and despite disagreeing with their anti-semitic rhetoric, because the Nazis were the only party committed to revising the punitive terms of the 1919, Treaty of Versailles, and the only party to include among their objectives the fights against corruption and against Bolshevism. Back in 1925 Adam's doctoral dissertation had been supervised by Ernst Cassirer. After the Nazis took power in January 1933, Cassirer applied to the Hamburg university authorities in April 1933 for permission to resign, on account of his Jewish provenance: he emigrated, initially to Oxford in England. It was no longer possible to believe that no government would ever gain popular support (or at least popular connivance) for the disenfranchisement of Jews. Margarete Adam was not Jewish, but she continued to make her views on the Nazi Party's anti-semitism known, and during 1933 her teaching contract with Hamburg university was withdrawn. Her position became one of opposition bordering on \\"resistance\\" in what became, during the first half of 1933, a one- party dictatorship, with antisemitism a core underpinning of public policy. After 1934 she campaigned (without success) to bring the perpetrators of the R√∂hm Putsch before the courts. She addressed letters and leaflets to senior army officers and others in positions of power and influence, seeking to persuade them to get rid of Hitler. Adam was arrested in 1937. She was sentenced for high treason to eight or nineSources differ. years in prison. She served her sentence in the women's prison in L√ºbeck-Lauerhof and at a prison in Cottbus where she was held in solitary confinement. In 1944 she was declared unfit for imprisonment and transferred to the hospital at Ro√üthal on the south side of Dresden. Later she was moved to the Charit√© (hospital) in (east) Berlin, during the final part of January 1946. Sources assert that her death resulted from her lengthy imprisonment.

Gairey moved to Toronto from Cuba in 1914. He worked for the Grand Trunk Railway as a dishwasher, cook and waiter until the early 1930s, when Black waiters were laid off in the competition for remaining jobs resulting from the railway's absorption into the operations of Canadian National. In 1936, to support his young family, Gairey returned to railway work, this time for Canadian Pacific as a porter. The poor working conditions and lack of job security led Gairey, along with other porters including Stanley G. Grizzle, to form a local chapter of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters labour union in the 1940s. Gairey was promoted to the position of porter instructor in the late 1940s. In November 1945 Gairey's teenage son, Harry Gairey Jr., was refused entry to the Icelandia indoor skating rink on racial grounds. The incident and resulting protests by students received substantial news coverage in Toronto. Gairey appealed to his alderman and the city council, spurring the creation of Toronto's first anti-discrimination ordinance in 1947. Gairey argued that since military conscription was extended to all young Canadian men, regardless of race, the rights of every citizen should be the same as well. Gairey's civil rights activism made him a leader in Toronto's Black community and effected change at a national level. Inspired by the work of Marcus Garvey, he was a charter member of the Toronto branch of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and helped to form the Negro Citizenship Association to advocate for changes to Canada's discriminatory immigration laws. In an obituary, Gairey was lauded for his leadership and his efforts to combat racial discrimination. Awards Harry Gairey received the Jamaican Order of Distinction in 1977 in recognition of his long service to the Caribbean communities of Toronto. He was awarded the Order of Canada in 1986 and the Order of Ontario in 1987, its inaugural year. The outdoor skating rink in Alexandra Park, Toronto, was named in Gairey's honour in 1996.

This was the second downing of an aircraft by a Supermarine Spitfire, and by any aircraft in the war by RAF Fighter Command. Pohle's aircraft did not land on UK soil but in the sea, three miles east of Crail. He was the only survivor out of his crew of four. Another Ju 88 from KG 30 was shot down soon afterwards, caught by five Spitfires. In total for the attack, the Germans lost two Ju 88 aircraft, with four airmen captured. Pohle was taken to the hospital at Edinburgh Castle. He saw out the war at Grizedale Hall in the Lake District, at No 1 POW Camp. He later helped Franz von Werra to escape.

McKinley won the state by a margin of 42.78%.

Her shrine sits atop the Rajagiri hillock in the Gingee Fort. History =Early period= In local legend, Gingee Amman is one of the seven virgin guardian deities of the village. Among the seven deities is another goddess known as Kamalakanni Amman, who is perhaps identical with Senjiamman herself. The Senjiamman shrine is supposedly the oldest one in the Gingee Fort, perhaps even older than the fort. In local lore, the name Senji for the fort and the town comes from Senjiamman. It is generally believed that the shrine was developed around 1200 AD when the early structure of Gingee Fort was constructed by Ananda Kon, chief of the local shepherd community. The small shrine of Senjiamman houses within its precincts a sacrificial altar. When the historian C.S.Srinivasachari wrote his book History of the Gingee and Its Rulers in 1943, he noted that the goddesses Senjiamman and Kamalakanni Amman were still in worship.Note1: The worship has ceased to exist today An annual festival used to be conducted at the foot of the hill and buffaloes were sacrificed to honor Kamalakanni Amman. He notes the presence of a stone slab, \\"with representations of a bow, five arrows, a buffalo's, a ram's and four human heads which refer to the sacrifices of men and animals that were practiced\\". =Nayak Period= There are well-preserved mural paintings dating to the Nayak period in the temple, indicating the temple was patronized during the Nayak period. The goddess came to be considered as Durga. The name Senjiamman and Senji supposedly lends their origin from the word sanjivi, the famous herb, with the name being a combination of two roots, \\"*nn\\" (pleasure) and \\"ji\\" (giving), with the name also traced to Singavaram,http://temple.dinamalar.com/en/new_en.php?id=747 a neighboring Vaishnava shrine, whose god is also supposed to be the guardian deity of the place. Two Tamil manuscripts in the MacKenzie Collection, shed light on the gingee goddesses and the Draupadi cult in Gingee. One of the manuscripts was commissioned by a Gingee resident, Narayana Pillai, a Konar himself; whose community supplies priests to the Gingee Draupadi or Melachheri temple. He refers to a myth in which the goddess Draupadi revealed her hair, in which a flower was fastened, to Tubbaki Krishnappa Nayaka (1500-1521). Hiltebeitel's fieldwork showed variants of this myth is still recounted by the konar priest of the temple in which the king's name changes from version to version. The MacKenzie manuscript states: > When Draupadi-amman had revealed herself to the king, the kings of Madurai, > Tiruchirappalli, and Thanjavur in their own regions had royal gopurams and > walls built for the great temples. So when the Gingee king first paid > tribute to the royal residence of the [Vijayanagar] Rayar, the kings came to > undertake their rule without cruelty [ni·π£·π≠uramillƒÅmal]. (Dikshitar 1952, 25; > Diagou 1939, 31) In local legend, Draupadi was born in Gingee, Gingee was Draupadi's avatara and Gingee was Hastinapura. Hiltebeitel notes such transpositions are unknown outside of Gingee with select communities involved, confirms the presence of Draupadi cult at MelaccheriNote 2: Melaccheri is another name for Gingee; though Melaccheri is located not in Gingee proper but a very short distance away. and notes similarity with the Ankalamma cult in which soil is taken from the Pallava-period Mattilesvara temple or the Draupadi temple itself. Several temples claim to have brought soil / sand or stone from Gingee, even as far away as Cuddalore and Pondicherry. Hiltebeitel also brings out the link between the Gingee Fort Buffalo sacrifices and the Draupadi festival at Melacheri, with the dates for the fire-walk and the buffalo sacrifice arranged in close proximity even until the time (in 1988) when he wrote his book. Narayanan Pillai states in his manuscript: > It was to that king [Tubakki Krishnappa] that Draupadi-amman, revealing > herself [piratti(ya)k·π£amƒÅy], showed the hair in the flower that had been > fastened to her [icon]. From that day, appointing Raja Gopalan [a Konar] as > trustee [of the temple\\" tarmakartta], building a Dharmaraja-Draupadi temple > on the northern boundary of Gingee [ce√±cikku va·π≠akku muka·πâaiyil], and > digging a tank, having granted hereditary rights and emoluments [mirƒÅcu] to > that Amman in the kingdom under his rule, establishing [or creating] it as > the premier [or original] temple [ƒÅti k≈çvilƒÅ u·πá·π≠u pan·πá·ªã] he made > arrangements, as per custom, that respect [mariyƒÅtai] in all temples be > given to the trustee of that [Dharmaraja-Draupadi] temple. From the Coleroon > to Tirupati, emoluments were made to that Amman. A descendant of those > trustees, AppacƒÅmi Pi·∏∑·∏∑ai, is an important p≈´cƒÅri [periya p≈´cƒÅri] down to > today. The historian van den Hoek notes Draupadi as the goddess of Gingee's northern boundary and CellattƒÅmma·πâ as the goddess of Madurai's northern boundary are linked to Mahishasuramarshini, the slayer of Mahishasura; with Cellattamman also being a recipient of buffalo sacrifice on the 8th day of her 10-day festival, with the priest for the sacrifice supplied by the Madurai Meenakshi Amman Temple. The CellattƒÅmma·πâ myth states when Ishvara and Ishvari (Shiva and his spouse) were walking through a forest, Ishvari became thirsty, killed a buffalo and drank its blood. When Isvara found her decorated with the animal's entrails, he no longer wanted her in his vicinity, but left her with the power to guard the northern boundary with her fierce character. Draupadi and CellattƒÅmma·πâ are both virgins in the legends. The Konar kings and thereafter the Nayak kings invoked her power of protection. The legends mention PothurƒÅja (aka P≈çttu RƒÅja, P≈çrma·πá·πáa·πá, P≈çttu RƒÅja-P≈çrma·πá·πáa·πá) [with his Telugu name P≈çta RƒÅju], the king of buffaloes, whose identity has wide recognition in the South Arcot region, and is identical with Mahishasura. The communities of Brahmins, Velala Mudaliyar, Vanniyar, Konar and Nattar hold the tradition of Potu Raja but there are variants in the story as retold by some communities. In one version, Potu Raja was a learned Brahmin minister in the court of King Cunƒ´ta·πâ, a grandson of King Janmajeya of Hastinapura, who helps Draupadi kill R≈çcaka·πá which is why Potu Raja is installed in every Draupadi temple with the first respects [mariyƒÅtai] to be paid to him. The legend of P≈çta RƒÅju survives in the north coastal areas of Andhra, between Vijaywada and Vishakhapatnam. In the Gingee legend, King Cunƒ´ta·πâ does his penance in Gingee but he must go to Kalinga-desa (north coastal Andhra) to find P≈çta RƒÅju. The legend was possibly a religious affirmation which aided Tubbaki Krishnappa in founding the Gingee line whilst absorbing its Konar founders into their fold. Hiltebeitel quotes Edwardes for his summarization of an alleged MacKenzie manuscript in which Tubbaki Krishnappa Nayaka establishes Gingee with the help of a descendant of Ananda-Kon named Tristapitla, who became the Prime Minister of Gingee. About 200 yards from the Melacheri temple is the Tƒ´-Pa√±cha·πâ-K≈çyil adjacent to which the King Cunƒ´ta·πâ was cremated. But the Sati who entered the fire was his concubine, a Telugu-speaking Nayudu named K·π£atriya-Ma·πÖkapƒÅy for whom Cunitan left provisions since his wife (the queen) failed to display chastity as implied in performing Sati. In legends which came to be merged, King Cunƒ´ta·πâ found mention as the founder of the Konar line as is also mentioned in Narayanan Pillai's narration of the Draupadi myth in which she reveals her hair to Tubbaki Krishnappa. However, according to the version stated by Munnacami Naidu from the pƒÅratiyƒÅr (praiser, bard) who claimed descent from the story's priest, the king was Raja-Design, though this version is not possible as Raja Desingh's wife historically committed sati. With the legend of Senjiamman and the Draupadi cult were merged three important characters of Gingee‚Äîfirst, King Cunƒ´ta·πâ with his Pandava ancestors and his descendants the early K≈çn kings (1190 CE - 1260 CE); second, King Tubbaki Krishnappa (1509 - 1521 CE); and third, Raja Design (circa 1714). To rule without cruelty in the stories of Tubbaki Krishnappa was a period of peace and harmony under the Vijayanagar emperor Krishnadeva Raya, where the three nayaks of Tanjavur, Madurai and Gingee supposedly accepted his sovereignty and imperial power without harboring thoughts of independence or rebellion. The Nayaks added their own shrines to the Gingee Fort as they expanded it. On the top of Rajagiri hill a temple to God Ranganatha was built though the sanctum is now empty. In addition, a mantapam was built in the Vijayanagara style of architecture, along with two big brick granaries, a masonry flagstaff and a strongly built chamber which was perhaps the treasury of the fort.

It showed several politicians and a high-ranked police officer accepting cash bribes in exchange for providing unofficial favors to a company. Performed in 2014 for the Indian news-magazine Tehelka, it was published on a private website months before the 2016 West Bengal Assembly elections. , the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Enforcement Directorate (ED) and a parliamentary ethics committee are probing the case. The Trinamool Congress has rejected the allegations and has claimed that the money was received in way of donations.  Background  Mathew Samuel Mathew Samuel was the former managing editor of Tehelka, a news magazine known for its investigative journalism and sting operations. He was one of the main principals behind the sting operation West End which spawned a miniature democratic crisis in 2001 and eventually led to the resignation of Defence Minister George Fernandes and later, the conviction of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) President Bangaru Laxman. Around 2014, the Tehelka administration floated the idea of a sting operation in an effort \\"to come back into the market with a good story; with a bang\\". Samuel and his team initially opted for either Madhya Pradesh or Himachal Pradesh, but the opportunities never materialized. The ruling government in Madhya Pradesh was led by BJP and Samuel did not wish to be identified as a journalist who solely targeted the BJP governments whilst the political atmosphere of Himachal Pradesh was too quiet to be conducive for a sting operation. It was around this time the Saradha Group financial scandal surfaced in West Bengal. Samuel felt that the corruption unearthed until then was only \\"the tip of the iceberg\\" and the team accordingly zeroed in on the politicians of West Bengal as their target.  Operation  In an interview with The Telegraph, Mathew Samuel said he was inspired by Israeli Mossad officer Mike Harari. He had asked a friend to create a cover for him as a high official of the fictitious Chennai-based firm Impex Consultancy Solutions. An Aadhaar card in the name of Santhosh Shankaran was issued for Samuel and social-media profiles were created. While trying to gauge the mood of the public, they chanced upon a taxi-driver who introduced them to a person who was locally known as 'Tiger'. Samuel claims that 'Tiger' initially introduced him to Iqbal Ahmed, the then deputy mayor of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation, and IPS officer S. M. H. Mirza. They were then supposedly acquainted with Sultan Ahmed (Iqbal‚Äôs brother), Subrata Mukherjee, Firhad Hakim and Aparupa Poddar. Mirza also introduced him to Madan Mitra and Mukul Roy. And, each of these meetings proliferated in the development of further connections. In Samuel's words: \\"It was almost like a chain reaction\\". In the 52 hours of footage photographed by Samuel and his colleague Angel Abraham around 2014, many prominent politicians resembling Members of Parliament Mukul Roy, Saugata Roy, Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar, Prasun Bannerjee, Suvendu Adhikari and Sultan Ahmad, and state ministers Madan Mitra, Subrata Mukherjee and Firhad Hakim, and Iqbal Ahmed were seen accepting alleged bribes in the form of wads of cash in exchange for doing unofficial favours for Impex Consultancy Solutions floated by Samuel himself. One more person named Sujay Bhadra alias Shantu, the then PA of Member of Parliament Abhishek Banerjee who is the nephew of Mamata Banerjee, was also seen in the video together with Karan Sharma, a close aide of Abhishek Banerjee.  Funding  Whilst Samuel initially claimed that K. D. Singh, a Rajya Sabha MP of the Trinamool Congress and majority owner of Tehelka, was in the dark about the entire operation and he was a 'lone-wolf', he later retracted his claims and asserted that Singh knew and funded the entire operation. He claimed that the budget of the operation was initially set at but was later increased to , as the number of potential targets increased vastly. The police subsequently filed a criminal case against Singh expecting that a large part of the sum might have been harvested from his chit fund business in West Bengal. However, Singh refuted his involvement with any aspect of the sting.  Release  A edited portion of the sting operation tapes were released to the public through the website naradanews.com after a nearly two-year lag in 2016. This was attributed by Samuel to the inertia of the Tehelka administration in publishing the tapes.  Reactions  The Trinamool Congress initially denied any connection with the sting operation, alleging it to be a product of political conspiracy and the video to be entirely forged. Trinamool party supremo and the Chief Minister of West Bengal-Mamata Banerjee alleged it to be a smear campaign by the opposition manifesting from vendetta-politics. Later, the Trinamool Congress claimed that the money received was in the form of a donation. The subsequent CBI investigations were branded as witch-hunts and to be a product of vested political interests. Trinamool MP Dinesh Trivedi was noted to be a dissenting voice and asked for the resignation of the accused. The Communist Party of India (CPIM) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) organised mass protests demanding the resignation of the politicians involved.   Fallout and investigations  Mamata Banerjee, Chief Minister of West Bengal and leader of the All India Trinamool Congress. = Political = There was apparently no fallout from the sting operation in the 2016 assembly elections, contrary to expectations of Indian media. The AITC government returned to power with an absolute majority. This was proclaimed by Mamata Banerjee in her victory speech after the elections as an endorsement of the honesty of the party. = Legal = On 17 June 2016, the state initiated the first legal measures and ordered a probe by Kolkata police. Soon, three public-interest litigations from the Indian Congress party and BJP were filed in Calcutta High Court asking for an impartial probe in light of the influential positions held by the accused. The State of West Bengal, along with the accused, asked for a probe by the state investigation team or by a special investigation team, while the petitioner pushed for a probe by a central agency. The local police was also accused of heckling Samuel, after summoning him for running alleged extortion-rings and interrogating him over the sting-issue. The state subsequently initiated its own probe which booked Samuel under multiple sections of the IPC 469 (forgery to harm reputation), 500 (defamation), 120(B) (criminal conspiracy) etc. On 5 August 2016, the High Court stayed the state probe for ad infimum, observing that the police cannot run a concurrent investigation along with a court-monitored probe. On 18 March 2017, the state initiated disciplinary proceedings against S. M. H. Meerza, a high-ranking officer in the Indian Police Service. He was the lone person (of all those who were filmed in the video tape to have accepted cash-bribe), to have been subject to some form of sanction by the state.  CBI Investigation  The CBI was asked to probe the case after the court raised doubts regarding the impartiality of the probe being conducted by the West Bengal Police and the footage was certified as authentic by the Central Forensic Laboratory. Whilst the state objected to the CBI handling the probe, a bench of the Court, presided by Chief Justice Nishita Mhatre subsequently held that the findings of the sting were not undermined by the legality of Mathew Samuel's actions and that an investigation by an impartial agency would be proceeded with. The Supreme Court of India also rejected an appeal by the state, allowing the CBI probe to continue. On 17 April 2017, the CBI filed a First Information Report against 12 Trinamool leaders for \\"criminal conspiracy\\". The CBI also subsequently summoned all of the involved figures, to assist in the investigation.    Aparupa Poddar confessed to have taken an amount of 3 lakh INR but claimed innocence as to any ulterior motive. She also claimed to have worked per the advice of Iqbal Ahmed. Iqbal Ahmed admitted to have accepted the cash but asserted to have utilized it in the development of a Maidan based sports-club, Mohammedan S.C. (Kolkata). Subrata Mukherjee too admitted to have accepted an amount of 3 lakh INR. Sougata Ray rejected the video as forged and claimed that he did not know Samuel. S.M.H. Meerza initially denied accepting any cash but later conceded to the veracity of the tape and claimed that he has donated the entire amount to an orphanage. The investigation subsequently hit a road-block as certain portions of the footage (a prior to the) were found to be missing from the submitted footage. Samuel claimed to have deleted the non-necessary parts of the footage, whilst transferring them to the laptop from his iPhone and to have forgotten the password for the iPhone folder, which contained the cut-out portions. The CBI subsequently contacted Apple Inc. to retrieve the contents of the folder but whilst denying to share the password citing privacy requirements, they confirmed that the entire sting-footage had indeed been shot by an iPhone. Recent developments indicated that the CBI was in touch with professional hackers to gain access to the folder.  Enforcement Directorate investigation  The Enforcement Directorate is also running a parallel investigation. It has lodged a case about misappropriation of public funds under Anti-Corruption-Act and has issued multiple summons to the accused and Samuel, himself.  = Ethics committee = Since the sting operation involved Members of Parliament, a Lok Sabha ethics committee was also set up to initiate a probe to determine if the persons committed a breach of privilege of the house concerned. The committee sat only once after the incident.

Initially, it provided access to the depositions of Polish citizens who after World War II were interviewed as witnesses before the Main Commission for the Investigation of German Crimes in Poland. From 17 September 2017, the database also presents the accounts of Poles who fell victim to repressions perpetrated by Soviet totalitarianism.  History  The Main Commission for the Investigation of German Crimes in Poland, set up in 1945, documented German crimes committed during World War II, conducted investigations and published the results of its activities. In 1949, its name was changed to the Main Commission for the Investigation of Hitlerite Crimes in Poland. The Commission was active throughout the country. The Commission‚Äôs tasks, their scope expanded to include Communist terror, were taken over by the investigative division of the Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) in 1998. The Commission‚Äôs documentation, including witness testimonies, was also passed over to the archives of the Institute. Acting on the basis of an agreement dated 11 February 2016, the IPN started submitting digital copies of these materials with the objective of making them available over the internet. The ‚ÄúChronicles of Terror‚Äù website premiered on 4 August 2016, initially providing access to a database containing more than 500 testimonies given before the Commission. On 25 January 2017 the Witold Pilecki Center for Totalitarian Studies signed an agreement with the Hoover Institution, pursuant to which ‚ÄúChronicles of Terror‚Äù will be supplemented by depositions relating to Communist crimes, taken from the archives of Gen. Anders‚Äô Army. After World War II, documents containing the accounts of Poles ‚Äì both soldiers and civilians who left the Soviet Union together with the Polish Army ‚Äì were deposited with the Hoover Library, for it was feared that they could have been seized by the Communist authorities.  Testimony database and its collections  ‚ÄúChronicles of Terror‚Äù contains nearly 4,000 depositions (the majority are also available in English translations). Accounts describing crimes committed during World War II in Warsaw and its environs were published in first order. The database also holds depositions made by former prisoners of extermination camps and concentration camps. Plans have been made for its progressive expansion by the addition of testimonies concerning events that occurred in other locations. In the spring of 2017, it published more than 500 depositions depicting the German Terror in Kielce region, and these were followed in October 2017 by accounts describing crimes committed by the invaders in Radom region. The following topics are addressed in the database. = Auschwitz = The database contains depositions pertaining to the complex of German camps in O≈õwiƒôcim. These testimonies include the accounts both of prisoners of the concentration camp itself, and of the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp. A number of them depict the medical experiments carried out on inmates and Sonderkommando members fate. =Street Executions in occupied Warsaw= Chronicles of Terror contains approximately 100 testimonies relating to the street executions that were regularly carried out in occupied Warsaw. The accounts include depositions made both by eyewitnesses and the families of victims. Selected testimonies have been brought together in a collection entitled Reign of terror ‚Äì executions in the streets of Warsaw = Pawiak = The Chronicles of Terror archive also has in its possession a dozen or so depositions made by former inmates of Pawiak, including those of its female ward, the so-called Serbia. These testimonies describe conditions existing in the prison, the methods of torture used, and the murders committed within its walls. A part of them has been gathered in the collection entitled Pawiak ‚Äì the Warsaw execution site. = The Ochota massacre = More than 30 depositions devoted to the Ochota Massacre are available in the database. Amongst them are the accounts of employees of the Radium Institute: Antoni Borowiecki, Bronis≈Çawa Mazurkiewicz and J√≥zef Laskowski, who were eyewitnesses to the crimes committed at the facility. The website also presents depositions made by Karol Cugowski, J√≥zef G√≥rski and Lucjan Majchrzak, who survived the mass executions carried out in Gr√≥jecka Street despite having suffered gunshot wounds. The murders and rapes committed in the ‚ÄúZieleniak‚Äù have been referred to, among others, in the account of Kazimierz Sucharzewski, who was forced by the executioners to assist in the burning of the bodies of victims, and that of an officer of the Home Army, Fryderyk Korsak-Bartonezz. Romuald Jakubowski and Maria Lachert, in turn, witnessed the murder of the wounded by German units in field hospitals. The remaining accounts contain descriptions of crimes committed, among others, in Kolonia Lubeckiego, Kolonia Staszica and the so-called Reduta Wawelska (Wawelska Stronghold). Selected depositions have been gathered in the collection entitled Ochota Massacre ‚Äì the suffering of the district. = Wola massacre = The database holds more than 100 depositions concerning the Wola Massacre. Amongst them is the testimony of Janina Rozi≈Ñska, who was wounded by a grenade during the mass execution carried out at the Tramcar Depot in M≈Çynarska Street, and of Wies≈Çawa Che≈Çmi≈Ñska, who, despite being shot, survived the series of murders perpetrated in St. Lazarus‚Äô Hospital. Wac≈Çaw DƒÖbrowski and Father Bernard Filipiuk escaped death and were able to describe the mass shooting carried out at the corner of G√≥rczewska and Zag≈Çoby streets, and also the crimes perpetrated at the Wolski Hospital in P≈Çocka Street. In turn, the account of Wanda Lurie (who was eight months pregnant at the time) relates to the execution conducted in the Ursus Factory at Wolska Street 55, during which she lost three children and herself received a number of injuries. Finally, Kazimierz Gƒôbczy≈Ñski provided testimony on the crimes committed at Staszica Street 15, where he himself received a gunshot wound. The database also contains the accounts of members of the so-called Verbrennungskommando (Wac≈Çaw Dziewulski, Mieczys≈Çaw Gurbiel, Witold Guzikowski, Mieczys≈Çaw Miniewski, Stanis≈Çaw Turek and Franciszek Zasada), who were forced by the Germans to assist in the burning of the bodies of victims. The remaining depositions refer, among others, to the crimes perpetrated by German units in Franaszek‚Äôs Factory, Sowi≈Ñskiego Park, and the area of Wolska Street and G√≥rczewska Street. A part of these have been grouped in a special collection entitled Genocide in Wola ‚Äì a district sentenced to death. = Treblinka extermination camp = The testimony database includes more than 30 depositions that describe the functioning of this extermination camp. The accounts of former inmates have been supplemented with those of railway employees ‚Äì witnesses to the transports arriving in Treblinka. A selection has been incorporated in the batch entitled Treblinka ‚Äì a complex for the extermination of the Polish Jews. = Crimes committed in the ‚Äúpolice district‚Äù = ‚ÄúChronicles of Terror‚Äù contains a few dozen depositions concerning the crimes perpetrated in the ‚ÄúPolice District‚Äù during the Warsaw Uprising. Among others, they portray the mass executions held in the Open-air Kindergarten at Bagatela Street, in the ruins of the pavilion of the General Inspectorate of the Armed Forces and in Anc‚Äôs Pharmacy, and also the events that took place in the Gestapo building at Szucha Avenue. Witnesses include the women who were used by the Germans to act as human shields for their tanks. Selected depositions have been brought together in the collection entitled Crimes in the ‚Äúpolice district‚Äù ‚Äì tragedy of insurgent Warsaw. = The Gulag Archipelago = This contains the depositions of people who had been arrested and sentenced to terms of imprisonment in corrective forced labor camps (Soviet forced labor camps). They provide graphic descriptions of the brutal interrogation methods used by the NKVD, the conditions existing in Soviet prisons and camps, and the back- breaking labor which the detainees were forced to perform. Many of the witnesses have also described how they were freed on the basis of the so- called ‚Äúamnesty‚Äù, and somehow managed to reach Gen. Anders‚Äô Army. = Deported = A separate section contains the testimonies of people who were deported to the USSR in the years 1940-1941 on the basis of administrative decisions issued by the NKVD. These were primarily ‚Äúenemies of the people‚Äù (as they were termed by the Soviet authorities), that is military settlers, foresters, civil servants, and members of their families. The deportees have described the conditions they were forced to endure during transport and at their points of destination. Numerous depositions depict the mind-numbing poverty that they faced while in exile. Some contain information about relations between the expellees themselves, and also their contacts with the local populace. = The epilogue to September 1939 ‚Äì Polish soldiers in Soviet captivity = This batch of depositions was written down by Polish soldiers who following the September Campaign of 1939 were detained by the Soviets as prisoners of war and ended up in NKVD POW camps or forced labor camps for POWs. Their accounts provide a description of life in the camps, of interrogation techniques, and the methods used by the NKVD to turn prisoners into informers, and also present the tools of Communist propaganda applied against Polish POWs. Following the so-called ‚Äúamnesty‚Äù, the majority of these witnesses enlisted in Gen. Anders‚Äô Army.

Hunley, Dec. 6, 1863 PSM V58 D167 Confederate submarine which sank the Housatonic The conservation- restoration of the H.L. Hunley is currently being undertaken by the Warren Lasch Conservation Center; they hope to have the Hunley project completed by 2020. Since the Hunley was located in 1995 and recovered from the ocean in 2000, a team of conservators from the Lasch Conservation Center has been working to restore the Hunley. The Hunley, the first combat submarine to successfully complete its mission, has been at the Lasch Conservation Center for over 15 years while scientists and conservators formulate a plan for its restoration. Once the Hunleys conservation and restoration is complete it will be relocated to a new museum built in its honor on the former Navy base in North Charleston. Currently visitors can tour the conservation center laboratories and can view the Hunley in its 75,000-gallon tank. History and sinking of the H.L. Hunley H.L. Hunley is a civil war confederate submarine built in 1863 by Park & Lyons; Hunley, McClintock & Weston. Its length is 39.5 ft. and its beam is 3.83 ft. and it had a speed of four knots. It was propelled by a hand cranked propeller and held a crew of one officer and seven enlisted men. Its armament carried one spar torpedo. The Hunley sank three times during its short career. The first two times were during test runs, and the final time was during its attack of the . The Hunley was lost to the Charleston outer harbor until 1995 and was finally recovered in 2000. On February 17, 1864, the Hunley destroyed the Union sloop Housatonic outside Charleston Harbor using a spar-mounted torpedo loaded with 135 pounds of gunpowder. The Hunley rammed the Housatonic to embed the torpedo in her hull and then reversed course while the lanyard connected to the torpedo fuse tightened and detonated it. The Housatonic sank immediately. The Hunley was unable to get enough distance and was also fatally damaged, though it may have survived up to an hour after the detonation. Discovery and recovery of the H.L. Hunley Location of the Hunley submarine The H.L. Hunley was found in 1995 in the Charleston outer harbor about four miles off Sullivan‚Äôs island. The divers had to dive down 30 feet of water before finding the Hunley, which was buried in the sand and sediment. There is some controversy about who located the actual position of the Hunley. Well-known author Clive Cussler and underwater archaeologist E. Lee Spence both claim to have made the original discovery. Cussler claims to have discovered it in 1995, and Spence says he discovered it in 1970 but failed to validate the discovery by diving in the location. H.L. Hunley recovery The Hunley was sent to Lasch Conservation Center at the old Charleston Navy Yard for conservation. The remains of the eight crewmen serving on the Hunley when it sank were found and buried on April 17, 2004, at the Magnolia Cemetery in Charleston. The recovery and conservation of the H.L. Hunley was championed by South Carolina Senator Glenn McConnell. He asked Warren Lasch to take on the fundraising and oversee the conservation and restoration treatment of the Hunley. Lasch accepted the challenge in 1997 and became the chairman of the Friends of the Hunley. Types of deterioration present on the H.L. Hunley Rust on iron =Rust= Rust occurs naturally when iron or steel is submerged in water and exposed to oxygen. It can also occur when the moisture content of the air surrounding the metal is high. Because the H.L. Hunley was made of iron and was submerged for over a hundred years, rust had formed all over the submarine. However, to prevent more rust from forming, the conservators choose to keep the H.L. Hunley submerged in a water tank, instead of exposing it to the oxygen-rich air, until a full conservation plan could be created. =Metal Fatigue= Metal Fatigue (Stress and Corrosion) can be either from stress or corrosion. Stress fatigue occurs when the metal is repeatedly pushed back and forth, such as from water pressure. This pressure eventually cause tiny cracks to form in the metal. Corrosion fatigue happens when the cracks in the metal becomes corrosive and weaken the structure. Thus normal wear and tear can cause metal fatigue. =Causes of deterioration= Hunley Salt Water The combination of salt water and metal can cause several types of corrosion, electrochemical corrosion and anaerobic corrosion. Electrochemical corrosion happens because the metal ions attract other compounds, which then cause the salt in the water to attack the metal. Anaerobic corrosion occurs when sulfate deposits surround the submerged metal and start producing hydrogen sulfide, which corrodes metal. Since the H.L. Hunley sank in the outer harbor of Charleston, the salt water had over a hundred years to eat through the metal. Air/oxygen Iron artifacts from the sea in particular are susceptible to rapid deterioration when exposed to an oxygen-rich environment like air. Chlorides from the seawater penetrate the iron on the molecular level. When in solution, these chlorides present no real problem. However, when exposed to air, they slowly dry in crystal form. As the crystals grow, the surface of the metal will expand and flake away, eventually reducing the artifact to a pile of iron oxide dust. In other words, the iron oxide dust is called rust. Rust occurs naturally on iron when it has been submerged for a while and is exposed to oxygen. Concretion Concretion is an encrusted layer of sand, sediment and shells that builds up slowly, when an object is submerged in water. Over time, marine organisms colonize on the submerged metal and build up layers of calcium. These layers create a barrier for a micro environment on the surface of the metal. Treatments of deterioration =Timeline of conservation and restoration= * August 2000: Hunley raised from the sea * February 2001: Several hull plates are removed * March 2001: First artifacts are found * April 2001: First human remains are uncovered * September 2001: Second Phase of conservation and restoration begins * January 2002: Third Phase begins, studies on the human remains and excavation of the block lifts * 2003: Fourth Phase begins, excavation of the ballast tanks * 2008: 3-D scanning of the exterior surface * June 2011: Hunley is rotated to an upright position * May 2014: Hunley is lowered into the 75,000 gallon tank, designed to remove the salt from the metal * 2014-2015: Removal of the outer concretion * 2016: Removal of the interior concretion =Rotation= The Hunley was removed from its watery grave at a 45-degree angle in order to keep the interior contents from shifting and falling through a weakened section of the hull. The Hunley had been lying at 45-degree angle on the sea floor for more than a hundred years. To lift the civil war submarine from the ocean, several slings were attached to the underside of the submarine and then slowly lifted from the water. Once the submarine was relocated to the Lasch Conservation Center, it was left in the slings at a 45-degree angle until the hull plates and keel blocks were removed, eleven tons of sediment had been cleaned out of the interior and an engineering and strength evaluation could be completed. Once the evaluation was completed and the Hunley was deemed safe to move, it took three days in June of 2011 to turn the civil war submarine upright. The conservators also used sensors, located on the keel support, to monitor the weight on each bearing. This was done so that the conservators can make sure the weight of the submarine is being supported evenly. =Concretion removal= When the Hunley was brought to the Lasch Conservation Center, it had over 1,200 pounds of concretion on its outer hull, in some places on the hull the concretion was over an inch thick. To remove the concretion, conservators spent many hours slowly chiseling the concretion off, using pneumatic chisels. It took conservators over a year to remove all the concretion from the outer hull. Currently the conservators have finished removing the concretion from the outside and are working on the interior. It will take at least another year to remove the interior concretion, perhaps a little longer since the conservators have to work in the small interior space of the submarine. Removing the concretion that has built up allows researchers to analyze why the Hunley sank and if the holes they have found in the outer hull of the submarine were from the attack on the Housatonic. =Submersion= After the Hunley was recovered it was placed in a 75,000-gallon tank. This was in order to protect the Hunley from the deterioration properties of oxygen. If it was left out in the open air, it would immediately begin to rust and deteriorate rapidly. By placing the Hunley in the tank, consisting of water and a solution of sodium hydroxide, conservators had bought some time to formulate a conservation plan. \\"During treatment, the Hunley will be constantly monitored and once the chemical bath is saturated with the salts it has leached from the submarine, it will be drained from the tank, neutralized, and replaced with a fresh solution. This process, which is estimated to take approximately 5-7 years, will be repeated until the level of salt in the iron is low enough to allow the Hunley to be rescued from its delicate and dangerous state.\\" References External links * Friends of the Hunley * Lasch Conservation Center *Civil War Battlefield Conservation *Metal Conservation *Iron Ships Conservation *Civil War Trust *Naval History and Heritage Command Conservation and restoration of cultural heritage Submarines of the Confederate States Navy Shipwrecks of the Carolina coast Shipwrecks on the National Register of Historic Places in South Carolina Shipwrecks of the American Civil War Maritime incidents in February 1864 Archaeological sites in South Carolina Ships built in Mobile, Alabama North Charleston, South Carolina 1863 ships Museum ships in South Carolina National Register of Historic Places in North Charleston, South Carolina Ships lost with all hands American Civil War on the National Register of Historic Places Hand-cranked submarines ","title":"Conservation-restoration of the H.L.

He was born the eldest son of Count Eberardo III in the ancient Swabian village of Burg Landau near Ertingen in present-day W√ºrttemberg and held the title of Konrad II, Count of Landau. He went to Italy in 1338, entered the service of the Lords of Venice and fought against the army of Verona led by Mastino II della Scala. In 1339 he joined the Compagnia di San Giorgio of Lodrisio Visconti to attack Milan, then under the control of Lodrisio's estranged brothers. After initial success their company was defeated at the Battle of Parabiago. In 1346, fighting for Venice against Milan, he was again on the losing side. In 1347, in the service of the Marquis of Saluzzo, when attempting to counter the attack by the Milanese and the Marquis of Montferrat, he was forced to surrender to the enemy. In 1348 he joined the Great Company of Werner von Urslingen and took part in an expedition sponsored by King Louis I of Hungary into Naples against Joanna I of Naples to avenge the killing of Louis's brother Andrew by the Neapolitans. In 1349 they won the Battle of Meleto against the Neapolitan barons which earned the company some 500,000 florins in booty and ransoms. He then spent the next few years fighting in various campaigns for different patrons in central Italy. In 1354, after Urslingen had died and Fra' Moriale had taken over the leadership of the Great Company, Landau rejoined its ranks and fought in various conflicts with Pisa, Siena, Florence and Milan. When Fra' Moriale was captured and executed in Rome later that year Landau himself took command. After further years of fighting for various sponsors his company came up in 1363 against the White Company led by Albert Sterz and John Hawkwood at the Battle of Canturino. During the battle the wounded Landau was captured and died of his injuries later in the day. References *Article based on a translation of the equivalent articles on Italian and French Wikipedia.

With the Baltimore Exchange described in the article by the Times as \\"the organ of the aristocratic wing of the Secessionists of that City,\\" the exchange argued the letter proved that \\"thirty thousand handcuffs were found with the Union Army.\\" The op-ed claimed that the story was described as a \\"feeble attempt to vindicate Beauregard's infamous falsehood\\" by the Baltimore Exchange. On August 21, 1861, the Baltimore Exchange published a letter from Washington at the start of the Civil War arguing that \\"No one here believes for a moment that it is any part of the Confederate plan to attack the intrenchments and defences opposite Washington -- least of all, to attack the Capital directly. They appreciate too intelligently the force of Northern sentiment on this point. Such a demonstration, if ever contemplated, has doubtless been long since abandoned.\\" On August 28, 1881, The New York Times published a war report that described the Baltimore Exchange as \\"a rebel paper and likely to be accurately informed of rebel movements,\\" with the exchange having recently reported that General Lee was in Western Virginia with 37,000 men.

The manufactory was founded in 1777, originally as glassworks. It is one of the oldest remaining, now state-owned porcelain manufactury in Hungary.  History  Hollohazi porcelain is one of the oldest porcelain manufactory in Europe and it is the oldest in Hungary, dating back to 1777. The factory just recently celebrated its 240th year in business, still on the original site in rural Northeastern Hungary amid lush forests and rolling hills. In the beginning, they only made rudimentary, although visually appealing glass cups, bottles and dishes. At the dawn of the 19th century, the glass industry has flourished. However, the main transport routes and the raw materials needed to manufacture glass were far from the factory site. So, the owner of the factory, Count Karolyi decided to turn it into a ceramic manufactory in 1831, using the kaolin clay found nearby. From the very beginning, there were multiple owners of the manufactory, but the first real upswing came in 1857 under the ownership of Ferenc Istvanyi. He developed the small plant into a major manufacturing facility. This ensured full employment in the barely 700 soul village. Although the products were made in a factory, they were still very folksy artifacts. The decorations and motifs were passed on from father to son, hand to hand. Ornamental porcelain such as figurines, lamps, wall clock appeared with the advent of the 20th century. After the post-World War I restart in 1923, the management went to great lengths to ensure the correct material composition of the porcelain. The price of porcelain goes ever higher, new products are being developed; However -due to the lending banks bankruptcy- the factory closes for 8 months. Another upswing begins in 1939, when a new tenant, a trader named Karoly Szakmary takes over. He sets off with great ambition to improve production and capacity of the artistically and technically outdated manufactory. He had installed a new coal-fired furnace; replaced the outdated steam-powered generator for new, electrical equipment, three modern electric furnaces were also installed which allowed for new production methods to be implemented for the newest designs. The factory can finally satisfy the needs and tastes of not only the rural population, but of the metropolitan gentry as well. Unfortunately, Karoly Szakmary is prevented from finishing his plans, when the factory is nationalized by the communist state after World War II, in 1948. After the nationalization, Hollohazi Porcelain was only allowed to manufacture industrial porcelain, such as electrical insulators. The first applied art pieces will come only in 1957. Starting from the 1960s young and talented artists are taking over the new product development, establishing Hollohazi Porcelain Mfg as an important site for the Hungarian and lately, all- European art scene. Demand has been constantly growing for Hollohazi porcelain‚Äôs newly designed and traditional ornaments and table wares. People appreciate the beauty of Hollohazi porcelain from Japan to America and beyond.

It is a volcanic intrusion that formed during the Miocene and was later exposed. The intrusion is formed by monzonite and is associated with a fault system that also connects to neighbouring volcanoes. While not presently glaciated, it contains a seasonal snowpack and is the source of several streams and rivers, including the Rio Salado. A number of archeological sites have been found on Nevado de Acay and mining activity occurred there until recent times.  Geology  Nevado de Acay is , or high. It lies in the La Poma Department of Argentina's Salta Province. It is part of the Cuesta del Acay mountains and their highest summit. The Calchaqui valley extends south from Nevado de Acay. It is formed by monzonite that was generated 12.6 ¬± 0.3 million years ago, along the Calchaqui fault. It originally formed as an intrusion that was exposed about 12.61 ¬± 0.25 million years ago. Another date is 26 million years ago, which would make it contemporaneous with the disintegration of the Farallon Plate and the following increase in subduction and volcanic activity. Yet another older date is 18.9 million years ago. Emplaced within the Precambrian-Cambrian Puncoviscana formation, the Nevado de Acay monzonite contains biotite, diorite, hornblende, magnetite, monzodiorite, pyroxene, titanite and tonalite. Skarn and mineral deposits formed within the monzonite as well. Located close to the Negra Muerta volcanic complex, it is a volcanic system associated with the Calama-Olacapato-El Toro fault system. Other volcanoes such as Aguas Calientes and Incahuasi Sur are associated with this fault system. Cirques indicate the presence of former glaciers. The present- day snowline lies at an altitude of ; rock glaciers fed by avalanches exist on Nevado de Acay in Pleistocene glacier valleys. Nevado de Acay is covered in snow only during the winter months, although summer storms can also deposit snow on it; during the dry season the mountain is bare. The originates on Nevado de Acay and flows south, as does the Rio Juramento. Other waterbodies originating on Nevado de Acay are the Arroyo Pircas, a tributary to the Rio Juramento, Arroyo Tastil which flows into Arroyo del Toro, which also originates on Nevado de Acay and eventually flows into the Arroyo Arias; Arroyo Arias in turn also drains into the Juramento. Most streams in the area are fed with meltwater. The mountains form the drainage divide; water flowing to the west eventually ends up in various endorheic basins. The Rio Los Patos also originates on Nevado de Acay and archeological sites are found on its river terraces, and it converges with the Rio San Antonio de los Cobres, which likewise originates on Nevado de Acay as Rio Organullo and after passing close to San Antonio del los Cobres and receiving the Quebrada Potrerillos carries the name of the town, and eventually reach Salinas Grandes where they evaporate.  Biology  Liolaemus multicolor, an iguanid lizard, has been found on Nevado de Acay. Endorheic basins in the valleys on Nevado de Acay were an important resource for the Las Cuevas V archeological site, which belongs to a cultural horizont between 600 BC - 400 AD.  Human activities  Map of mines in a 1907 sketch Nevado de Acay is the site of an Inka mountain sanctuary. A summit sanctuary was discovered in 2000; later two additional sites were discovered on the subsidiary summits Blanca and Navaja. Some historical references to the mountain indicate that it was the connection between the Inka province Chicoana and the Puna, although the Abra del Acay is not the only place to which these historical records may refer. The present day National Route 40 passes close to the mountain. The mountaintop was not the sole site of human activity at Nevado de Acay; traces of mining and pastoral activity among others has been found lower on its slopes as well. At least 53 structures have been identified at elevations between . Historical records exist of a site named \\"San Bernardo de Acay\\" south of Nevado de Acay. The archeological structures of Nevado de Acay are still only incompletely understood. Some of these mines reported in 1907 are known as \\"Flor de Desierto\\", \\"Protectora\\", \\"Resurreccion\\" and \\"Saturno\\" - the last owner of these mines obtained them in 1924. Mining activity including gold and silver is reported to have occurred in the area during the time of Spanish rule and ended only during the 1656 rebellion of Pedro Boh√≥rquez; the Spanish efforts on these mines may have been the reason why the rebellion occurred in the region. Later an iron mine was active on the northern slope but it is now abandoned. Obsidian outcrops have been observed in the area.

It operated from 1884 to 1953. Description The incline ascended from 17th Street between Liberty and Penn avenues in the Strip District to Arcena (Ridgeway) Street near Ledlie Street in the Hill District. It measured 840 feet in length with a vertical rise of 330 feet. It was structurally massive, with over 750 tons of bridge work carrying the two 10-foot-gauge tracks over the Pennsylvania Railroad yards, Bigelow Boulevard, and Liberty Avenue. A writer in the Street Railway Journal in 1891 believed that it was \\"probably the most heavily built plane in existence\\". History The incline was built to the design of Samuel Diescher with the aim of hoisting 20-ton coal loads to the top of the hill. It entered service on 1 March 1884. While the coal traffic never materialized to expectations, railroad and business activity in the Strip District generated enough passengers and freight to keep the incline operating. Customers included produce merchants transporting their goods from wholesale markets in the Strip. A saloon and entertainment hall called the Penn Incline Resort existed for several years next to the upper landing. This resort, patterned after similar hilltop attractions in Cincinnati, was built together with the incline to boost business. It enjoyed early popularity and according to The Pittsburg Dispatch was \\"a favorite resort for the better class of Germans\\". With the implementation in 1888 of Pennsylvania's Brooks High License Law, the resort stopped selling liquor and went into decline. The building was destroyed in 1892 by a fire that spread from the incline's boiler house. In 1927, a stunt driver guided a Willys‚ÄìOverland Whippet automobile up and down the incline in a promotional spectacle to demonstrate the car's climbing and braking prowess. A plankway specially built for the occasion prevented the car's wheels from lodging between the rail ties. By the end of World War II, business was struggling, with only 30‚Äì50 riders a day paying a ten-cent fare. The incline was open only three hours in the morning and four hours in the afternoon when its last owner, Pittsburgh Railways, asked the state Public Utilities Commission permission to abandon it. Nobody opposed the request. The incline shut down on 30 November 1953 and within the next three years was dismantled. There has been talk among city planners of reviving the incline, but no such idea has come to fruition. In 2020, mayor Bill Peduto suggested relinking the Strip and Hill districts with a gondola lift that could also extend to the Oakland neighborhood.

Origins John Hopton, Esq. was a son of Thomas Hopton (died before 1428) and his wife Margaret, daughter of William Pert of TerringtonTiverington in old documents . and his wife Joan Scrope. His father was the illegitimate child of Joan Hopton (from a gentry family with lands near Swillington, Yorkshire) by Sir Robert Swillington, Chamberlain of the Household to John of Gaunt. Sir Robert de Swillington made his home in his wife's family seat of Kirby Bellars in Leicestershire,A. Beanlands, 'The Swillingtons of Swillington', Publications of the Thoresby Society, Vol. XV: Miscellanea (Leeds 1909), pp. 185-211 (Internet Archive). where he died in 1391 and was buried in the priory there. His son Roger de Swillington had livery of a large estate, but Sir Robert's will also left ¬£20 to his natural son Thomas Hopton.Will of Robert de Swyllington, of Kirby, Lincolnshire (P.C.C. 1391, Rous quire). Sir Robert had previously given lands in Blythburgh, Suffolk, to the friars-preachers there.'Pirnhow' in F. Blomefield (ed. C.

His son John died in the following year, and his sister Margaret Lady Gra (wife of Sir John Gra of South Ingleby) was found to be next heir: but she died without issue in 1419 and, since Thomas Hopton had by then also died, the estates passed to Elizabeth, daughter of Thomas Swillington and wife of Robert Sampson of Playford, near Ipswich.Blomefield, History of Norfolk, X, at pp. 130-32 (Internet Archive). It was not until the death of Joan, Lady Swillington (Roger Swillington's second wife, who had a life- tenure), c. 1428, that Richard Danyell, parson of Swillington (executor of Roger SwillingtonCalendar of Close Rolls, Henry VI, I: 1422-1429 (HMSO 1933), p. 347-48 (Hathi Trust).), made a declaration that Sir Roger had entailed his estates upon his brother Thomas Hopton and his heirs; further, a release of the manor of Wissett to Sir John and Lady Gra had been forged \\"by certain children of iniquity\\" in his name, and that no such release (nor of any other lands) had been made.Calendar of Close Rolls, Henry VI, II: 1429-1435 (HMSO London 1933), pp. 93-94 (Hathi Trust). Robert Sampson and Elizabeth his wife at once (1428) released all their rights in the manors of Ditchingham (Pirnhow) and Ellingham (in Norfolk), and of Blythburgh, Westleton, Claydon, Thorington, Westleton, Westhall, Yoxford and others (in Suffolk), and all the lands late Sir Robert Swillington's, to John Hopton, Esq., and his heirs. Consequently in 1430-1431 the king ordered the Sheriff of Norfolk to deliver seisin to John.Blomefield, History of Norfolk, X, at pp. 130-32 (Internet Archive). Robert Sampson, tailor of Halesworth, quitclaimed a very extensive list of manors and other holdings to John Hopton,Calendar of Close Rolls, Henry VI, II: 1429-1435 (HMSO London 1933), pp. 120, 130 (Hathi Trust). a full release being made to John 9 years later by Sir John Gra of all his right in the Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire and Derbyshire manors, similarly acknowledged by Elizabeth Whitfield, relict of Robert Sampson,Blomefield, History of Norfolk, X, at pp. 130-32 (Internet Archive). and by Sir John again (including the Suffolk manors) in 1435.Calendar of Close Rolls, Henry VI, III: 1435-1441 (HMSO 1937), p. 43 (Hathi Trust). Career The young John had no particular prospects until this series of deaths left him in 1430, aged about 25, owner of many valuable holdings inherited from his grandfather. Among them were the lands of Swillington outside Leeds, and also several manors centred upon the estate or headmanor of Westwood at Blythburgh.Calendar of the Fine Rolls, XV: Henry VI, 1422-1430 (HMSO 1935), pp. 310-19 (Internet Archive). He made Westwood his home for the rest of his life, adding to his Suffolk holdings by the purchase of two further estates. One was Cockfield Hall in Yoxford, which he bought from Sir John Fastolf in 1440,C. Richmond, John Hopton: A Fifteenth Century Suffolk Gentleman (Cambridge University Press, 1981), p. 26 (Google). and the other was Easton Bavents, just north of Southwold and mostly vanished under the sea, from Ela, widow of Sir Robert Shardlow. The tomb by the high altar in Holy Trinity Church, Blythburgh Between the late 1430s and around 1450 he as lord of Blythburgh stood up for its Liberties against the authorities at Dunwich, refusing to pay their dues for stallage and for shipping, or to use their measures, and often obliging the Dunwich shipping to use the key at Walberswick.T. Gardner, An Historical Account of Dunwich, Antiently a City, Now a Borough (Author, London 1754), pp. 138-40 (Google). Early in his time in Suffolk he was chosen as sheriff for the county in 1436‚Äì7 and later served another term in 1444‚Äì5. From that year he also sat on the commission of the peace, leaving the bench in 1458 but being reappointed from 1461 until 1468, when the loss of his sight made him unable to continue. While his eldest son became Sir William, he himself refused a knighthood. His will has not survived, though he is known to have made one, and in 1478 he was buried beside his first wife in Holy Trinity Church, Blythburgh. Family In 1427 he married Margaret, daughter of Sir Thomas Savile of Thornhill and his wife Margaret, daughter of Sir John Pilkington, with whom he had four sons and three daughters. The girls all married landowners, for example Elizabeth who married Sir William Brewes of Stinton Hall in Salle. After Margaret died in 1451, he founded a chantry for her in Blythburgh church and set up a tomb there for her and himself.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Henry VI, Vol. V: A.D. 1446-1452 (HMSO 1909), p. 567 (Hathi Trust). Sources vary over his next marriage, some saying that between 1451 and 1457 he married and lost Agnes Heveningham.D. Richardson, ed. K.D. Everingham, Magna Carta Ancestry: A Study in Colonial and Medieval Families, 2nd Edition, 4 volumes (Salt Lake City 2011), II, pp. 400-01 (Google). It appears that the memorials formerly at Walberswick church may have been for these deceased wives.T. Gardner, An Historical Account of Dunwich, Antiently a City, Now a Borough (Author, London 1754), p. 163 (Google). However it is certain that in 1457 he married Thomasine, daughter of John Barrington of Rayleigh and his wife Isabel. She was the widow of two previous husbands, William Lunsford of Battle and William Sidney of Stoke d'Abernon, and already had seven children. Together they had two sons and she long outlived him, being buried near him in Blythburgh church in 1498. The slab which forms the lid of the Blythburgh tomb-chest is indented for three (lost) monumental brass figures, that is to say a central male figure in full armour with a wife at either side of him. He was the great- grandfather of Sir Arthur Hopton (1488-1555). References Bibliography Richmond, Colin. John Hopton: A Fifteenth Century Suffolk Gentleman; Cambridge University Press, 2005.

Carnevale invited viewers into an empty gallery, and covered the front glass wall with posters. She then locked the viewers in the gallery and left. Carnevale stated that the intention of this action was to invoke a type of \\"exemplary violence\\" whereby participants were forced to move from being passive viewers to active and aware participants by engaging in the act of freeing themselves from the gallery. Rather than engaging in violent action participants flagged down a passerby to break the glass from the outside and free them passing the responsibility of the violent action on. This Happening was a critique meant to encourage critical reflection on the nature of freedom in Argentina, under military dictatorship at that time. The breaking of glass of the gallery wall was meant to echo breaking the constraints of political repression.Kester, Grant. ‚ÄúThe Sound of Breaking Glass, Part I: Spontaneity and Consciousness in Revolutionary Theory.‚Äù e-flux 30 (2011): Online. = Tucum√°n Arde = Tucum√°n Arde (translated Tucum√°n is Burning) was an exhibition held in Buenos Aries and Rosario Argentina that began in 1968 in protest of the terrible living and working conditions under military dictator Juan Carlos Ongan√≠a.

He was elected senator for the Colombian Green Party for the 2018-2022 term. Some decades ago he used to be a member of Colombian Liberal Party, where he was elected senator for four years (1986-1990). Liberals nomineed him for Vice President of Colombia in the 2006 Presidential election. Marulanda was born in Pereira, Risaralda, and graduated with an economics degree from the University of Antioquia. He served as the Mayor of Pereira in 1974 and then went onto become the general secretary at the Ministry of Economic Development. During this period he became involved directly with Luis Carlos Galan and his New Liberalism movement. As part of New Liberalism, he was the campaign director of the movement in Antioquia was elected city councillor of Medellin, the second largest city in Colombia and the capital of Antioquia. In his role as campaign director for Antioquia, he was the person who warned Galan that Pablo Escobar wanted to infiltrate the movement to become a politician, this led to Luis Carlos Galan denouncing Escobar on the stage and denying Escobar membership of the movement. In 1986, he was elected Senator alongside Luis Carlos Galan. In 1987, the New Liberalism movement decided to rejoin the Liberal Party. He was elected a member of the Constituent assembly in 1991, charged with drafting the Colombian Constitution of 1991 after president Cesar Gaviria and Congress decided to dissolve the Constitution of 1886. After the new constitution was drafted and the constituent assembly dissolved, Ivan Marulanda was appointed by Cesar Gaviria as an Ambassador to the United Nations in 1991.

It is located at the Awkuzu junction boundary with Nteje, Aguleri and Igbariam.  Origin  Nando is the fourth and last son of Iguedo. The others being Ogbunike, Umueri and Awkuzu. = Iguedo = There have been numerous accounts on the life and person of Iguedo. Her history seems to have been a greater puzzle to Historians than that of Eri. However, none of the accounts about her can be out-rightly and correctly accepted or rejected as some of the data came purely through oral tradition and scanty archaeological discoveries although there is near unanimity in the various accounts concerning the strong connection between an individual called Iguedo and the towns that constitute Umu-Iguedo clan. One of the more accepted opinions hold that she was a daughter of Eri. It is said to have had two wives. The first bore five children: Agulu (founder of Aguleri); Nri Ifiakuanim; Nri Onugu (founder of Igbariam); Ogbodudu (the founder of Amanuke); and a daughter, Iguedo, who bore the founders of Ogbunike, Awkuzu, Umuleri and Nando. The smissind wife, Oboli, gave birth to Onoju who left the Anambra area and became the founder of Igala land. A second group of thought attempted to tag her as Eri's daughter who was allowed by her father to bear children at home without been married. However, the Oral tradition of the entire Iguedo clans disagree with this assertion as it would have amount to bastardization of Culture if Eri made such a taboo as all of their tradition indicates paternal origin. A third opinion asserts that Iguedo came from either Agukwu or Onitsha. However, not many people share this view. That Iguedo came from Agukwu (Nri) could be an attempt to explain her relationship with the people of Nri. If she is said to have come from Onitsha, that may again be an effort to account for the profound respect which some parts of Onitsha accord her. It was very well known that olili-nne-Iguedo was celebrated by some Onitsha indigenes. Iguedo's relationship with the people of Onitsha is supported by an oral tradition that asserts that the progenitors of the towns of Umu-Iguedo clan were born out of successive marriages of Iguedo to several men. She had first married and gave birth to Ogbunike, and Awkuzu . Later, she married Okebo from Eddah, and the fruit of their marriage was Umu- ulu-eri (progenitor of Umuleri). Finally, Nnamovo, a man who was believed to have come from Onitsha married Iguedo and she gave birth to Nando. It was in the land founded by Nando that Iguedo died and was buried. However, these attempts to credit Iguedo as the maternal ancestry of Umuleri town seems to contradict the widely accepted knowledge that Iguedo was a daughter of Eri as there was no way She could be a daughter of Eri and still married him or his son in order to beget Umuleri. This would be tantamount to taboo or \\"nso ani\\" in Igbo Culture. This error by some scholars might have been due to the celebration, ‚Äòolili nne Iguedo‚Äô, which was also known to have been held at Nneyi Umueri over the years. = Her Death = On her death at Nando after a lengthy protracted sickness, Nando was said to have invited the rest of the Umu-Iguedo clans (Ogbunike, Awkuzu, Umuleri) for burial arrangement and also sent a message to the other children of Nnammeyi (Nneyi Umuleri) informing them of their mother's death. But then there was commotion and arguments on where to bury her body. Ogbunike who was the eldest of the Iguedos wanted the body to be taken home (Ogbunike) for burial since they are the children of the first child but Nando Objected on the ground that they were the people that took care of her during her old age. Unknown to all of them, Umuleri delegates went outside for private talk and after deciding among themselves that their mother's's corpse would not be lost to others returned singing war music. They further proceeded to cut off her head and took it home with them where it was buried in Nneyi Umuleri at Aro Shrine in present day mmanoma Nneyi Umuleri. Today the trace of her tomb is found in the Shrine of the Aro Oracle of Umueri while her body was finally buried in Ubaruisioye Nando. In order to commemorate her memorial, there was a traditional annual Iguaro & \\"Oriri nne Iguedo\\" celebrated in Nneyi Umueri and Nando respectively till this very day. And all her Children and relatives are expected to be there for the rituals.  Structure  Nando comprises eight villages: Agbudu, Akamanato, Abube-Agu, Abube-Uno, Isinyi, Ikem, Ubarunisioye and Umuawo.  Traditional Leadership  Nando community was originally lead by one Igwe who was from Agbudu village (the eldest of the eight). However, when Nando became an autonomous community, fighting ensued over which village would produce the Igwe. This fight was mostly between Ikem and Abube-Agu. However, Igwe Odibefa of Agbudu Nando is still the most recognized Igwe in Nando.  Markets  Nando has a large central market called the Nkwo market which is located at the intersection between Agbudu, the roads leading to Ubarunisioye, Ikem and Abube-uno. However, each village also has its own small market such as the Afor market of Ikem, the Eke market of Abube-Agu and the Eke market of Ubarunisioye.  Festivities  Nando people have their special festival period called Onwa Nge during the month of May, during which different masquerades come out to entertain the people and display their various colourful attires.

Players use cards from their hand to interact with the game board Hearthstone is a digital collectible card game released by Blizzard Entertainment in 2014, available for Microsoft Windows and macOS PCs and iOS and Android smartphones. The game is free-to-play, with players gaining in-game currency and card packs via winning matches and completing quests, while real-world money can be spent to acquire additional card packs and cosmetic items. The game has been critically well-received and financially successful, estimated to earn nearly per month as of August 2017. , Blizzard has reported more than 100 million Hearthstone players. Blizzard has continued to expand the game with the addition of multiple expansions, adventures and game modes. Gameplay Hearthstone is a digital-only collectible card game that revolves around turn-based matches between two opponents using pre-made decks of cards. Players can choose from a number of game modes, with each offering a slightly different experience. Players start the game with a limited collection of basic cards but can gain rarer and more powerful cards through purchasing packs of cards or as rewards from specific game modes. Hearthstone is purposely designed to exclude card trading, while allowing players to disenchant unwanted cards into a quantity of arcane dust that can then be used to craft new cards of the player's choice. Players customize their decks with any gained cards to improve their chances of winning and gaining further rewards. Hearthstone is free-to-play, only requiring the player to download the game client for their computer or device after setting up a free Battle.net account; supporting the ongoing development of the game comes from micropayments. Players can earn in-game gold by winning play mode matches and completing daily quests, such as winning a certain number of matches while in play mode with a particular hero class. A player can have up to three active daily quests, which carry over until completed or the quest is declined by the player; a new daily quest is given once a day. Gold can be used for booster packs, entry tickets for arena and access to adventure wings. Alternatively, players can spend real money to purchase these items directly, and can buy exclusive card back skins and alternate heroes. During the week before the Journey to Un'Goro expansion released in April 2017, Blizzard temporarily added daily log-in rewards that included gold, arcane dust for card crafting, card packs, and individual cards. Hearthstone is set within the Warcraft universe, with its characters, spells and locations drawing mostly from existing lore. The game has a few original characters like Sir Finley Mrrgglton, Morgl, Elise Starseeker, Patches the Pirate, and Skycap'n Kragg that were later added to World of Warcraft. Additionally, Hearthstone reveals the image of many characters only hinted at within the lore of World of Warcraft such as the Old Gods N'Zoth and Y'Shaarj as well as Shirvallah, the Tiger. =Matches= Each Hearthstone match is a one-versus- one battle between two opponents. Gameplay in Hearthstone is turn-based, with players taking turns to play cards from their hand, limited by available mana, that include casting spells, equipping weapons, summoning minions to do battle on their behalf or replacing a player's chosen hero with a Death Knight hero. Hearthstone does not allow the opposing player to react to any of the current player's actions as a means to speed up gameplay; there are some special cards known as Secrets that prepare an action that is automatically performed by the game for the opposing player if a condition is triggered, such as if a minion attacks their hero. Games may be between two players, or one player and one computer-controlled opponent. Each player is represented by a 'hero', a character from Warcraft lore representing one of ten specific classes. The classes are defined by their unique hero power that can be used once-per-turn in matches (some cards may affect the number of times this can be used), and the selection of class-specific cards that the player uses to construct the hero's deck. The ten available classes, along with their hero names, are Mage (Jaina Proudmoore, Medivh or Khadgar), Priest (Anduin Wrynn, Tyrande Whisperwind or Madame Lazul), Warlock (Gul'dan, Nemsy Necrofizzle or Mecha- Jaraxxus), Paladin (Uther the Lightbringer, Lady Liadrin, Sir Annoy-O or Arthas Menethil), Warrior (Garrosh Hellscream, Magni Bronzebeard or Deathwing), Druid (Malfurion Stormrage, Lunara, Dame Hazelbark or Elise Starseeker), Hunter (Rexxar, Alleria Windrunner or Sylvanas Windrunner), Rogue (Valeera Sanguinar or Maiev Shadowsong), Shaman (Thrall, Morgl the Oracle, King Rastakhan or The Thunder King), and Demon Hunter (Illidan Stormrage or Aranna Starseeker). In some of the game modes, such as Adventures or Tavern Brawls, the player may play or face against a non-standard hero or enemy with a pre-built deck and a unique hero power which are not available outside of these game modes. At the start of the match, each player draws cards from their respective deck of thirty cards after it is shuffled. One player is randomly selected to go first. The first player draws three cards while the second player draws four. Players have the option to mulligan any of the cards in their starting hand, with replacements coming from the rest of their deck. At the end of the mulligan, the second player gets a card called \\"The Coin,\\" a spell that gives a mana crystal at any point during a player's turn. Despite the second player's two card advantage, game director Ben Brode claims that on average the first player has a 3% higher chance to win, and Ars Technicas analysis of three professional tournaments found only an insignificant advantage for the first player.Do you want to go first? Balancing Hearthstone and other turn-based games. Ars Technica. August 7, 2014. Each player subsequently starts with no existing mana crystals. Players then proceed to alternate turns. At the start of each turn, all empty mana crystals for a player are refilled and they gain a new filled mana crystal, up to a maximum of ten. If a card with an Overload keyword is played, this will limit the number of available mana crystals during the following turn. The player then is required to draw a card from their deck; if they have run out of cards, their hero takes an increasing amount of damage on each successive draw, called Fatigue. During their turn, each player may choose to play any of their cards, use their hero power, or direct attacks against the opposing hero and their minions. Nearly all cards and hero powers cost a number of mana points, and the player must have at least that many filled mana crystals to perform that action, which then drains those crystals until their next turn. Unlike card games like Magic: The Gathering, the opposing player has no means to interrupt or counter the current player's action during their turns, though some card effects can be triggered by the other player's actions and are automatically handled by the game. Each player's turn is limited by a timer, pausing only during card animations; the player is warned when this countdown is nearly over by displaying a burning rope. If the countdown ends before they complete their turn, they forgo any further actions and their turn ends. Players can end their turn at any time before this, and the game will indicate to the player when they have exhausted all possible actions for a turn to allow them to end it early. Heroes typically start a match with 30 health points. Some cards and hero powers allow the hero to gain a number of points of armor, with no limit, or heal up to the maximum health for their hero. Any attack damage dealt to the hero first depletes the armor value and it must reach zero before damage can be done to the hero's health. A match is concluded when one or both players have reached zero health, when a player chooses to concede or when the maximum number of turns, 45 turns for both players, is reached. Completing a match will grant each player experience for that hero class. The amount of experience gained is dependent on the game mode, whether the opponent was computer or player-controlled, how many turns the game lasted and whether the match was won. Leveling hero classes grants the player access to additional basic cards up to level 10 for that hero or golden versions of Basic cards past level 10; once all heroes are level 60, the player will have collected all golden versions of Basic card set. Each match takes place on a randomly selected battlefield, representing the board on which the game is played. Several of the battlefields are inspired by the lore of Warcraft or based on the game's expansions. Each battlefield features its own design and many interactive elements, but the gameplay is in no way affected or determined by battlefield selection; the differences are purely cosmetic. Around the battlefield are the game's important user interface elements, which are each player's hand, deck, hero portrait, hero power, mana crystals, the log of recent cards played and actions taken and each hero's summoned minions. At any time, players can select or mouse-over face-up cards to get more details on their effects including definitions of keywords. The player may use six pre-set emotes to communicate with their opponent. Text- based messages may be exchanged with the opponent if they are part of the player's Battle.net friends list. Players may observe and send messages to their Battle.net friends while the friend is playing a match. =Card categories= Cards are the main substance of Hearthstone, representing the abilities, characters and effects each player is able to make use of during the match. Cards fall into four broad categories: summon cards to bring minions into the game, spell cards that create some type of immediate effect, equippable weapons that enable the hero character to attack directly and hero cards that transform the basic hero into a different one. All cards have a mana cost that must be provided by the available mana the player has for that turn. Once summoned, minion cards each have an attack and a health value; when a minion attacks a target, it will deal its attack value to that target's health, and if it is attacking a minion, it will take damage based on the defending minion's attack value. A minion's health does not regenerate at the start of the player's next turn, so minions can be destroyed after taking smaller amounts of damage over several turns. Minions normally cannot attack the turn they are put into play, and once in play, they can normally attack once per turn. Some keywords affect the behavior of minions from these basic rules: examples include those with \\"Taunt\\" that must be destroyed before any other minion without taunt or the opposing hero can be attacked, those with \\"Charge\\" can attack the turn they are brought into play, and those with \\"Windfury\\" can attack twice per turn. Other keywords define actions to be taken at specific events: minions may have \\"Battlecry\\" events that only trigger when they are played from a player's hand, \\"Deathrattle\\" events that occur when the minion is killed, and many more. Tooltips are provided for all keywords, and interactions of minions and their keywords often crucial to success in matches. Minion positioning on the game board can be important as some minions and spells will affect adjacent minions. Minions may belong to a specific tribe such as \\"Beast\\", \\"Demon\\", \\"Murloc\\", \\"Pirate\\", \\"Mech\\", or \\"Elemental\\", as labeled on the card. Some cards can be influenced by or can influence minions in play or in the player's hand that belong to that specific tribe. Spell cards can be used for example to cause damage to the opposing hero or their minions, apply buffs or debuffs to minions or draw additional cards from their deck. As a digital-only game, some of Hearthstones spells can also be used by the player to pull in cards from the entire available Hearthstone library that meets certain requirements, even if they do not own these cards. Spell effects may last for only a turn or may be permanent on the card it affects as long as it stays in play. Buffs or debuffs can be silenced to remove all effects from a card. Equippable weapons have an attack value and durability value. When equipped, the player can direct their hero to attack as if they were a minion; the hero's attack value will be that of the weapon, and the hero will take damage if he attacks a minion. The weapon's durability drops by one after the attack, as well as through other card effects, and if it drops to zero, the weapon is unable to be used to attack and is usually destroyed. Usually, weapon attacks can only be used once a turn. Hero cards, introduced in the \\"Knights of the Frozen Throne\\" expansion, transform a player's hero into a Legendary hero with a different hero power, which is related to the replaced hero's power. At times, Blizzard has altered the attributes and effects of certain cards after their release based on observations from gameplay, to prevent unforeseen game-breaking combination attacks or effects that would be over-used by players. Many of these changes are \\"nerfs\\", reducing the effectiveness of the card's ability, while there have also been some \\"revamp\\" that may improve cards. These changes are retroactive, affecting all existing cards owned by players. When a card has been directly changed, players are offered a full refund of the arcane dust crafting cost for two weeks if the player chooses to disenchant the affected cards.January 30, 2018 Next Month's Hearthstone Nerfs Were Way Overdue Kotaku. Retrieved May 24, 2018. =Decks= In all game modes except Arena, some parts of Adventure mode and a few of the weekly Tavern Brawls, the player does battle using a constructed deck of 30 cards selected from the player's collection, using a mix of neutral cards available to all classes and specific class-based cards available to the chosen Hero. Each deck can only feature two of each card and only one of each Legendary rarity card. Legendary cards are the rarest cards in Hearthstone and are usually based on unique characters within the Warcraft universe. Arena play features no such limitations on the number of regular or Legendary cards but requires players to play using a new deck chosen from a series of randomly generated selections. After release, Blizzard has adopted a \\"Year\\" moniker to identify when expansions have been retired from Standard format; the first, \\"Year of the Kraken\\", lasting from April 2016 to March 2017, retired the \\"Curse of Naxxramas\\" and \\"Goblins vs. Gnomes\\" expansions, while the \\"Year of the Mammoth\\", starting in April 2017, retired the \\"Blackrock Mountain\\", \\"The Grand Tournament\\" and \\"League of Explorers\\" sets. The \\"Year of the Mammoth\\" Standard set also moved some Classic cards to the \\"Hall of Fame\\" set that is not playable in Standard but still can be obtained through card drops and available to play in Wild format. As some of these cards were class-specific, Blizzard plans to add new class- specific cards to the Classic set that are less powerful but similar to the ones moved to the Hall of Fame. These cards are expected to be added in the future. Since the introduction of the \\"Year of the Kraken\\", decks are built either to the Standard or Wild format. Standard decks may be played in either format, but Wild decks can only be played in the Wild format. Wild format decks can use any cards within the Hearthstone library, limited by regular deck construction rules. Alternatively, the Standard format limits cards to those in the Basic and Classic set, and from any newer expansions that are those released within the last two years. Cards from previous expansions cannot be used except in Wild formats, however, as of December 2019, Wild format card packs and adventures can be purchased via the in-game shop for gold or players may still purchase them from the in-game or online store for real money. The Standard format was added to help improve competitiveness for new players while helping to maintain a dynamic metagame. The construction of a player's deck is a key strategic element in the game, determining which cards are available during a match. The game gives each player a pre-made deck for each Hero using the game's Basic cards, allowing them to get a quick start in the game. The game provides a few deck recipes for each hero that are based on various successful deck archetypes and it populates the deck with the cards a player already owns. Hearthstone offers a deck construction helper to guide new players on selecting a good range of card types and values, or to finish off decks that are partially completed. The player has the ability to create up to eighteen custom decks, increased from the nine initially available before the release of the Whispers of the Old Gods expansion. Since the June 2017 patch, players have been able to share the composition of their deck with others via a unique code generated in-game. =Card library and crafting= In the collection interface, players can create and edit their decks from existing cards, as well as 'disenchant' and create new cards. On release, the game consisted of the same Basic set of cards that all players begin with and earn through leveling up all the individual heroes. All additional cards are generally gained by winning or buying card packs in the game; each card pack consists of five random cards. On Hearthstones release, purchased cards and packs would be from the Classic set, while with the release of each expansion or adventure, cards and packs from that expansion could also be gained. , there were 1729 unique collectible cards in the game, with more planned to be added in the future through expansion packs. Not all cards in the game are collectible in a player's library, as some cards are created as effects from other cards or spells, while others are unique to a specific Adventure or Tavern Brawl game mode. The former is comparable to Magic: the Gathering's tokens. Each card is classified as neutral or specific to one of the ten classes; with the introduction of Mean Streets of Gadgetzan, tri-class cards were added, meaning the card can be used by three different classes.Crime Pays in the Mean Streets of Gadgetzan Yahoo! November 4, 2016. Players can purchase card packs within the game or through Blizzard's storefront. Players can purchase decks from any of the currently available expansions for Standard play as well as the Basic set. A single pack costs 100 gold coins (in-game currency); alternatively, players can purchase multiple packs at a time using real-world money with volume discounts; for example, two packs cost $2.99 (‚Ç¨2.99 or ‚Ç§2.99) while 60 packs cost $59.99 (‚Ç¨69.99 or ‚Ç§59.99). All cards in a card pack are randomly selected from the given card pack expansion with one card guaranteed to be of Rare or higher rarity. A Legendary card is guaranteed to be in one of the first ten packs of an expansion opened by a player; subsequently, the regular card appearance rate occurs. A player is guaranteed to not open a Legendary card that they already own unless they already own all Legendary cards in a card pack's set. Additionally, players can use the crafting system to create new cards. The system uses arcane dust to craft specific cards. Arcane dust can be obtained by destroying existing cards, from arena mode rewards or from the end of season rewards. Because cards can be used in more than one of the player's constructed decks, a player only needs a maximum of two copies of any regular card or one copy of a Legendary card in their collection, and the game can automatically convert extras into arcane dust. The crafting system was created as an alternative to the player card trading prevalent in trading card games such as Magic: The Gathering, with no plans for cards to be traded between players. Similar to the foils found in physical collectible card games, Hearthstone features golden cards that are special versions of regular cards featuring a golden border and unique animations. These cards are less common than the regular ones and are worth more arcane dust. Golden cards differ from their regular counterparts purely cosmetically and are intended to allow players to show off their special cards to others. =Game modes= Five game modes are available to play in Hearthstone. Matches in all modes except for Solo Adventures count towards quest completion; Duels initially did not count towards quest completion except during limited periods, but a game update in June 2017 allowed these matches to add another way to complete the daily quests. *Play mode allows players to match up against human opponents of similar skill. Players can choose to play casual games, or take part in the ranked play system, earning ranks to reflect their skill and standing within the community over month-long seasons. In generally, winning a ranked game earns a star towards progression to the next rank, while losing a game may lose a star; 3 stars are necessary to move to the next ranks. Participation in ranked play can earn players special cosmetic rewards. Blizzard has awarded a new card back at the end of each season for reaching a minimum with bonus rewards such as golden cards and arcane dust for reaching higher ranks.Hearthstone Ranked rewards tier guide. August 18, 2015. After the release of WOG, Play mode matches can either use the Standard or Wild format, with separate Ranked play in each format. Standard format restricts decks to Basic and Classic cards, as well as any cards from sets released in the last two calendar years. The wild format allows decks to be made with no restrictions. ** Prior to the Year of the Phoenix (April 2020), the Ranked system was based on numeric tiers initially ranging from 25 to 1 (the lower value of the tier, the more skilled play it represents) and Legend, which employs a visible leaderboard for individual player rankings within the player's region. Stars won through matches can lead to both promotion or demotion through ranks, though stars cannot be lost in Ranks 50 to 21. Prior to February 2017, there were two \\"floors\\" in this ranking system, where players could not be demoted below once achieved, at Rank 20 and at Legend. A patch in February 2017 introduced three additional \\"floors\\" at Ranks 15, 10, and 5 in response to player criticism of the difficulty in moving up ranks with the shortness of each monthly season. In October 2018, Blizzard announced that they would add 25 new ranks, 50-26, for new players, and players can earn bonus card packs for reaching rank milestones. All ranks are reduced at the start of a new season (but cannot go past rank 25). ** With the Year of the Phoenix in April 2020, the Ranked system has adapted a five-tier system consisting of Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum and Diamond, each with 10 ranks within them ranging from 10 to 1. Players in the top tier Diamond 1 can then be promoted to the Legend tier. New players to Heartstone start in an Apprentice League that has 40 ranks, during which no stars can be lost due to losing matches. In addition, ranks 10 and 5 within each tier are floors which players cannot fall below even if they lose further games. Similar rewards for rank milestones throughout these tiers were kept. At the end of the season, the player's position in the Ranked system gives them initial stars for the next season that may promote them from the base Bronze 10 level that all start at; for example, a player ending a season at Diamond 10 will earn 8 stars for the next season, placing them at Bronze 8. *Solo Adventures are single-player modes against computer-controlled opponents that are either Practice matches or Adventures. In Practice mode, players can learn the basics of the game against easier opponents that only use basic cards in their decks, or more difficult ('expert') opponents that use a larger pool of cards. Players can also choose which class to play against. In Adventure mode, the player attempts to defeat bosses to unlock new cards. The boss encounters feature unique dialogue elements. For example, \\"Curse of Naxxramas\\" was divided into five sections (\\"wings\\"). Each section was purchasable as a one-time transaction for 700 gold or real-world equivalent, with future sections locked until the previous sections were completed.Naxxramas Wing Entry Details and Heroic Mode/ Retrieved July 8, 2014. Bundle discounts are offered if all remaining locked sections are purchased at one time using real money.Zeriyah on Twitter July 8, 2014 After an adventure is removed from Standard format, it is unavailable for players to purchase. Thus at the release of WOG, Naxx was removed from the store. *Arena mode allows the player to select one of three random heroes and draft a deck of 30 cards by choosing between three random cards at a time. Players use their drafted deck to compete in a series of games against other arena players, generally matched against decks with an equivalent win-loss record. Each arena run lasts until the player has reached three losses or twelve wins, at which point they earn rewards determined by the total number of games won. While constructed decks have limits on the number of copies of the same card in a single deck (two), arena decks have no such limits. Access to a single Arena run (drafting a deck and playing until it reaches the win or loss limit) requires a purchase of an Arena Ticket which costs either 150 gold or real- world money of $1.99 (‚Ç¨1.99 or ‚Ç§1.99). Prior to the \\"Year of the Mammoth\\" updated in 2017, Arena mode ran under the Wild format, allowing any card to be potentially offered during the deck construction process; with the 2017 update, Arena mode will be limited to Standard format, and will also see altered card distributions from normal play, making neutral cards less common and increasing the chances for the more rarer class-specific cards to be offered during Arena deck construction. *Tavern Brawl mode features one-on-one matches with another player. These commonly are competitive matches to defeat the other player, but some matches have featured cooperative goals such as jointly defeating a powerful minion. These matches force players to deal with a set of specific guidelines, which change on a weekly basis. Playing matches in this mode is restricted to players that have at least one level 20 hero character. The reward for the first time a match is won during a weekly brawl is normally one Classic pack. *Battlegrounds was introduced in 2019, and is based on the auto battler genre and allows for up to eight players to compete. At the start of the match, each player selects one of three random heroes. On each round, players have a limited amount of coins to recruit minions to add to their side, as well the ability to sideline minions for later replacement or remove minions. After recruiting, players are paired off into battles; all minions from both sides of each battle fight automatically by the computer until one player losses all their minions, allowing the other hero to damage theirs. Players then return to recruit additional minions, repeating this to try to knock out the other heroes and be the last one standing. *Duels, also referred to as \\"Friendly Play\\" and \\"Friendly Challenge\\",Hearthstone Patch Notes - 1.0.0.5314. May 2014 allow players to challenge friends on their Battle.net friends list in unranked matches. *Additionally, the game features a tutorial that is a limited starting experience designed to introduce players to Hearthstone, in which the player is matched against a series of computer- controlled opponents that includes dialogue elements. The tutorial may be played only once by an account per Battle.net region. Players gain a quest daily and can store up to three quests that can be completed to earn in-game gold or other rewards. The requirements of these quests are based on cumulative performance in matches, typically requiring the player to win multiple matches with certain hero classes, destroy a number of minions, damage opposing heroes, observe a friend winning a game, playing a certain number of a particular type of card or other similar tasks. Progress towards completing quests typically can only be achieved through game modes with random matchmaking (Play or Arena), but Blizzard has offered periods where other play modes, such as duels, count and in June 2017 made duels always count for quest completion. A player can \\"reroll\\" one quest once per day to get a different one. With the \\"Year of the Mammoth\\" introduction, Blizzard has added log-in rewards and other meta-game elements occasionally. =Game regions= Hearthstone offers play in four different geographical regions: Americas, Europe, Asia and China. Players can only compete and communicate with other players within the same region. While each player is by default assigned to a region loosely corresponding to their registered country of residence, players are able to switch regions within the Battle.net launcher, allowing them to play against those from other regions if they wish, although players from other regions are unable to select the China region for play on the same device. Each region holds a separate profile for each player, and it is not possible to transfer cards, gold or other details between regions. Players wishing to play in a new region must begin the game from the start, including replaying the tutorial and restarting their card collection.The ultimate guide to starting a serious Hearthstone collection June 30, 2016 Expansions and adventures Blizzard has expanded Hearthstone roughly three times a year by the addition of expansions and adventures. Each expansion presents more than 100 new cards to Hearthstone developed around a theme or gameplay concept; once released, players can purchase or win card packs with cards from the available expansions to add to their library. Adventures represent fewer new cards, typically a few dozens, which are only gained by winning specially designed matches against computer opponents in the single- player mode. Access to an adventure requires payment with in-game gold or real-world money. All adventures have multiple \\"wings\\" that must be completed; each wing can be purchased separately for 700 gold or $6.99 (‚Ç¨6.99 or ‚Ç§6.99), with a lower cost if buying multiple wings at once. Since the \\"Year of the Mammoth\\", which began with \\"Journey to Un'Goro\\" in 2017, there were no future more adventure card set releases. Instead, the game will include freely- available single-player missions, similar to those in adventures, to earn card packs from that expansion. However, in the Year of the Dragon, starting in April 2019, there will be additional single-player modes that will be paid content, separate from expansion pack releases. While structured similar to Adventures, where there will be several \\"wings\\" to process through, the approach will be closer to the \\"Kobolds & Catacombs\\" Monster Hunt or \\"The Witchwood\\" Dungeon Run in that players will make choices related to their hero and deck over the course of several battles through each wing. Rewards from these single-player modes will be through card packs from the associated expansion by completing individual battles, such that one can earn more new cards by completing the single-player modes than by simply buying new packs directly, alongside other bonuses. As of April 2020, there have been 15 expansions and six adventures that include collectible cards. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" + Collectible cards breakdown - !

The Classic card set is generally class-specific cards that are not associated with any expansion and card parks can always be purchased in the game's store or won as rewards. Basic and Classic cards are playable in both Standard and Wild formats, and will not be rotated out of Standard play as with cards from other expansions. Over time, some cards have been retired to a separate Hall of Fame, taking them out of Standard play format but still available for Wild play and can be obtained by crafting. Any class-specific Classic cards retired in this manner are eventually replaced with new Classic cards for that class to prevent class card-count imbalances. At the start of Year of the Dragon in April 2019, two legendaries from The Witchwood set that powers up the hero power, Genn Greymayne and Baku the Mooneater, as well as four cards that synergize with those cards, were moved to the Hall of Fame so those cards left the Standard set a year earlier than normal. Prior to the year moniker system, the Reward set consisted of four cards that could only be obtained by completing meta-game achievements in Hearthstone, such as by collecting at least one copy of every \\"murloc\\" card in the Basic and Classic sets. As with other Classic cards, these have since been retired to the Hall of Fame, still usable in Wild play and available through crafting. =Curse of Naxxramas= The adventure \\"Curse of Naxxramas\\" was announced on April 11, 2014,Beware the Curse of Naxxramas! April 11, 2014 and then was released on July 22. It includes 15 bosses and nine class challenges that together awards 30 cards, which includes six legendaries, and an exclusive card back if all heroic bosses are defeated. \\"Curse of Naxxramas\\" was developed to focus on a specific gameplay mechanic, with the team settling onto exploring the design space around the \\"deathrattle\\" keyword. This led to the narrative of the player having to explore a location filled with ghosts and undead creatures as to take advantage of deathrattle effects. Since it was a single-player adventure, the team also developed bosses that would be far different from typical human opponents, including some boss characters that would break the fundamental rules of the game. Lead artist Ben Thompson said that they made it felt like winning against these bosses was something that the player earned, as well as helping the player to learn new tricks they could use in regular play modes. =Goblins vs. Gnomes= The expansion \\"Goblins vs. Gnomes\\", was announced at BlizzCon on November 7, 2014, and then it was released on December 8. The expansion includes 123 cards found in its specific card pack. Pricing for the packs are the same as Classic packs. \\"Goblins vs Gnomes\\" was the first large expansion, and rather than roll out cards as they did with \\"Curse of Naxxramas\\", they felt their goal with this \\"was ‚Äòlet‚Äôs make a bunch of cards that will really go in and just blow up the meta all at once,‚Äô and we‚Äôll see how it goes, and maybe that‚Äôll affect how we do things in the future,\\" according to Chu. A central theme was designed around the \\"Mech\\" tribe cards that would interact with cards that represent goblins and gnomes. =Blackrock Mountain= The adventure \\"Blackrock Mountain\\" was announced at Pax East on March 6, 2015, and the first wing was released on April 2; the other four wings were opened weekly thereafter. It includes 17 bosses and nine class challenges that together awards 31 cards, which includes five Legendary cards, and an exclusive card back if all heroic bosses are defeated. \\"Blackrock Mountain\\" was designed as to help support players that wanted to construct dragon-themed decks. Dragon cards in Hearthstone are generally expensive to cast and thus only appear in the latter part of a match, making such decks weaker in the opening rounds. With \\"Blackrock Mountain\\", the team introduced cards that interacted with dragon cards, such as by having special effects when a minion is summoned while having a dragon card in hand. =The Grand Tournament= The expansion \\"The Grand Tournament\\" was announced on July 22, 2015, and was released on August 24; the set includes 132 cards found in its specific card pack, which costs the same as previous card packs.The Grand Tournament Arrives August 24 Retrieved August 19, 2015. \\"The Grand Tournament\\" was developed with a new card mechanic for minions called \\"Joust\\" which has combat between a minion with Joust with other minions based on the casting cost of the minions, rather than their attack and health. Donais noted that while this also created a central theme for \\"The Grand Tournament\\" expansion, it also served to help combat \\"aggro\\" decks--decks filled with low-cost minions that could be quickly deployed--which at the time of the expansion's release, were extremely popular and found to be discouraging to many players. \\"The Grand Tournament\\" also introduced the \\"Inspire\\" mechanic for minions, which would create some effect for the minion each time the player used their Hero power, often including cumulative effects over several turns. Donais said the Inspire keyword came about looking at how to interact with Hero powers better, and while Inspire-based cards could be slow and at risk, could have great payoffs if used properly. =League of Explorers= The adventure \\"League of Explorers\\" was announced at BlizzCon 2015 on November 6, 2015, and the first wing was released on November 12; the other three wings were opened weekly with a week-long break after the second wing. It includes 13 bosses and nine class challenges that together awards 45 cards, which includes five legendaries, and an exclusive card back if all heroic bosses are defeated.New Hearthstone Expansion The League of Explorers Announced Retrieved November 6, 2015. \\"League of Explorers\\" was the team's first attempt to craft a narrative that allowed Hearthstone to stand on its own from the Warcraft universe even though it may still borrow concepts from it from time to time. The adventure borrows from dungeons in desert locations within World of Warcraft but transform the experience to be one of an adventuring archaeologist, and the challenges were more themed around puzzles and traps that the dungeons would present rather than just boss characters. Central to \\"League of Explores\\" was the new \\"Discover\\" mechanic, which when activated would have the game randomly select up to three cards with specific characteristics from all available game cards, allowing them to select one card to put into their hand. This mechanic was introduced to provide contrast to decks that focused on card draws, which they found out tend to be played in the same manner over time. The Discover mechanic allowed decks to be more random but provide some player decision for on-the-spot judgement calls depending on the situation. =Whispers of the Old Gods= The expansion \\"Whispers of the Old Gods\\" was announced on March 11, 2016, and was released on April 26; the set includes 134 cards found in its specific card pack, which costs the same as previous card packs.Whispers of the Old Gods Creeps into Action on April 26! - News - Hearthstone Blizzard, April 19, 2016 \\"Whispers of the Old Gods\\" was based on creating a theme around mysterious and dark Lovecraftian horror, such as Cthulhu, to contrast to the high adventure and excitement that they had designed with \\"League of Explorers\\". This concept of crafting powerful god-like characters let them brainstorm on wild ideas for cards that may seem overpowered for the game but that would fit the theme. Central to the expansion is the Legendary \\"C'Thun\\" Old God card, which can be buffed by effects from sixteen other cards, disciples of C'Thun, that were part of the expansion, regardless of where the C'Thun card was currently at. Donais explained this helped to create a \\"sense of dread\\" in opponents that fit the theme they wanted. Because of this, all players received the C'Thun card and one of the disciple cards for free once this expansion was released. \\"Whispers\\" also allowed the designers to take old favorite cards and make \\"corrupted\\" versions of them within the flavor of the theme. =One Night in Karazhan= The adventure \\"One Night in Karazhan\\" was announced on July 29, 2016, and the first wing was released on August 11; the other three wings were opened weekly thereafter. There are four wings along with a free prologue mission that awards two cards. Kara includes 13 bosses and nine class challenges that together awards 45 cards, which includes five legendaries, and an exclusive card back if all heroic bosses are defeated. \\"One Night in Karazhan\\" is based on a popular game location in World of Warcraft, featuring an abandoned mage's tower that is often used for a dungeon raid. The adventure features eleven boss characters that are also in the World of Warcraft raid of the tower. The team had designed the concept of this expansion alongside \\"Curse of Naxxramas\\" early in Hearthstones post-release and was considered to be their first adventure, but they ultimately used Naxxramas, as Karazhan was being used for other activities by teams within Blizzard at that time. Instead, when they looked towards designing it, they found Priest decks had difficulty in staying current with the meta-game, so several of the cards introduced with this set were to help make the Priest a more viable class with the shifts in popular decks. =Mean Streets of Gadgetzan= The expansion \\"Mean Streets of Gadgetzan\\" was announced at BlizzCon 2016 on November 4, 2016, and was released on December 1; the set includes 132 cards found in its specific card pack. \\"Mean Streets of Gadgetzan\\" was originally envisioned to have the spirit of \\"cops and robbers\\", according to designer Matt Place and art director Ben Thompson, but the idea transformed into squarely focusing on the crime aspects, and treating the narrative as three principle mafia-like crime families vying for control of the city of Gadgetzan along with a number of small-time criminals that work as hired hands. The nine hero archetypes were divided into sets of three that each worked for a different family, which led to the creation of tri-class specific cards. Each of the three families were given a central mechanic theme: the Grimy Goons buff cards that in a player's hand, the Jade Lotus improve new Jade Golem cards the more they are played, and the Kabal use Discover cards to use certain cards from outside a player's deck. The set includes Legendary cards that represent the leader of each family. =Journey to Un'Goro= The expansion \\"Journey to Un'Goro\\" was announced on February 27, 2017, and was released on April 6; it contains 135 cards found in its specific card pack. \\"Journey to Un'Goro\\" is based around a pre-historic theme and introduces dinosaurs and the Elemental tribe, including retroactively making some previously released minions as part of the tribe. It introduces Legendary spells with the \\"Quest\\" keyword, which award a unique minion or spell when the conditions of the quest are fulfilled. If a Quest card is in the player's deck it will be put into the player's opening hand, although players are allowed to mulligan it, and it must be put into play before the player can start completion of that quest. The expansion also adds the \\"Adapt\\" keyword to some minions and spells, which allows the player to select a buff to apply to one or more minions. =Knights of the Frozen Throne= The expansion \\"Knights of the Frozen Throne\\" was announced on July 6, 2017, and was released on August 10. The set's theme is about the frozen wastes of Northrend and Icecrown Citadel, and the set features the game's heroes embracing the power of the Undead Scourge, becoming Death Knights in the service of the Lich King. The expansion features the introduction of hero cards, an entirely new card type which transforms the player's hero and hero power along with varying unique effects, and the Lifesteal mechanic. It features 135 cards and includes adventure-like missions for single-players, featuring a narrative leading to a boss fight with the Lich King that can reward one random Legendary death knight card, multiple card packs and for dedicated players an alternate hero for Paladin - Arthas. The expansion introduced the Lifesteal keyword; when minions or spells with this keyword deal damage the controlling hero is healed by the same amount. =Kobolds & Catacombs= The expansion \\"Kobolds & Catacombs\\" was announced in November 2017 during BlizzCon 2017 and was released on December 7, 2017. The general concept of the expansion was around the idea of dungeon crawls from role-playing games. Its 135 cards are themed around exploring old catacombs under Azeroth and uncovering valuable treasures. Among the cards include Legendary weapons for each class that includes classes that have never had weapons before, Spellstone cards that require the player to achieve certain objectives in-game to upgrade the card, \\"Unidentified\\" item cards that offer a random effect alongside a known effect, and cards with a \\"Recruit\\" keyword that allow the player to summon minions directly from their deck that meet the card's requirements. All players received the Legendary minion Marin the Fox a month ahead of time and after the set was released, one random Legendary weapon card. Earlier in 2017, Blizzard had planned for this set's theme to be around Warcrafts Blingtron robots and would have been known as \\"Blingtron's Lootapolooza\\". While this theme still centered around dungeons and loot, they decided that the set would have better flavor and easier art to design by switching the theme to kobolds; however, this decision came after they started some of the promotional material, so some of the art includes Blingtrons. The expansion introduces a new single-player mode called a \\"Dungeon Run\\", a roguelike-style format. The goal for the player is to complete battles against eight boss characters randomly selected from a pool of 48 that become more progressively difficult. The player starts by selecting a class, which gains them a small deck of cards for that class. For each boss they defeat, the player gains additional starting health in the next battle, a choice of three sets of three randomly selected cards around a theme, and in some cases, a unique treasure card otherwise not available in the normal game modes. Should the player be defeated by a boss, that run is ended, and the player must start a run anew. Cards from the Dungeon Run do not become part of the player's library, though players can earn card packs through quests involving Dungeon Runs, and can earn a unique card back by completing runs with all nine classes. The idea for the Dungeon Run is based on the expansion's theme and the mode works as an optional single-player experience independent of the card collection of the player. =The Witchwood= The Witchwood was announced in March 2018 as the first expansion in the Year of the Raven and was released on April 12, 2018. It is themed around a spooky forest next to the cursed city of Gilneas from Warcraft. The expansion adds two new keywords; \\"Echo\\" cards can be played as many times on a turn as long as the player has the mana to pay the cost, while minions with \\"Rush\\" can immediately attack the opponent's minions on the turn they are summoned. The set also features cards that give a special effect if a player's deck only contains even-cost cards or odd-cost cards, effectively limiting players to only half of their card collection in assembling decks to take advantage of these cards. The expansion adds a single-player mode called \\"Monster Hunt\\", an evolved version of Kobolds & Catacombss \\"Dungeon Run\\", which became available to play two weeks after the expansion was released. In the \\"Monster Hunt\\", players pick between four unique heroes that have a unique hero power and unique cards. After defeating each encounter, players pick between three sets of cards to improve their deck and occasionally earn special cards or an ability to improve their hero power; there are over 45 encounters. Players can earn a unique card back, which requires defeating eight bosses of increasing difficulty, with each of the four heroes, and then defeating the final boss, Hagatha the Witch.Hearthstone: Monster Hunt guide - Heroes, Monsters, Bosses, Equipment and more! =The Boomsday Project= The Boomsday Project was announced in July 2018 and was released on August 7, 2018. The set focuses on \\"Mech\\" characters and abilities, similar to Goblins & Gnomes, and is themed around the minion Dr. Boom that was introduced in the former set, having set up a villainous laboratory in the Netherstorm. The set introduced the new \\"Magnetic\\" keyword, which allows a player to use a card as a buff if the \\"magnetic\\" card is played to the left of a mech, and as a stand- alone minion otherwise. The Magnetic mechanic had originally been designed as \\"Modular\\", whereby playing a card would either allow the player to select from two effects: playing it as a spell atop a mech, or as its own minion. The developers found this could lead to long turns if a player's deck primarily consisted of such cards, to the point they had been ready to cut the keyword and release the set otherwise. However, they found a solution through the user interface by letting the player make the choice at the same time as playing the card if they placed it in a specific location near a mech. The Boomsday Project is also the first expansion to have legendary spell cards for each class. In June 2019, a number of cards from The Boomsday Project received buffs, such as increasing the strength or health of minions or reduce the casting cost of various cards. This is the first major buff to cards since the game's release in 2014. In addition, a new neutral Legendary minion card was added to the set and a golden copy of it was given free to all players for a limited time. The set also includes a single player mode called the Puzzle Lab, which presents more than 100 Hearthstone-based puzzles where players are given a pre-determined game state and must attempt to complete a given objective. The puzzles are split among these four different objectives: Lethal, where players must win the match during their turn; Mirror, which requires the player to match the minion battlefield on both sides; Board Clear, where the battlefield must be cleared of minions; and Survival, requiring the player to survive until the next turn. The Puzzle Lab was released two weeks after the expansion's release. Players who complete all the Puzzle Lab missions will be rewarded with a card back. =Rastakhan's Rumble= The Rastakhan‚Äôs Rumble was announced during Blizzcon 2018 and was released on December 4, 2018. The expansion is centered around nine troll teams coming to battle in an arena to gain favor with their animal spirits known as \\"Loa\\" and King Rastakhan, the ruler of the ancient Zandalari Empire. Each troll team represents one of the nine classes in the game, and in addition to other cards, each class will get a Legendary minion card representing the Loa, and a Spirit card that has synergy with the class's Loa card. A new keyword \\"Overkill\\" triggers an effect if more damage is done than needed to eliminate an opposing minion. A new solo mode, Rumble Run, will also be available with this expansion that follows the story of a young troll combatant seeking glory in the arena. =Rise of Shadows= Rise of Shadows was announced in February 2019 before being formally revealed for its April 9, 2019 release as the first expansion in the Year of the Dragon. Rise is themed around numerous villains from previous expansions gathering to form the League of E.V.I.L.: Arch-Thief Rafaam (League of Explorers), Madam Lazul (Whispers of the Old Gods), King Togwaggle (Kobolds & Catacombs), Hagatha the Witch (The Witchwood), and Dr. Boom (The Boomsday Project) and then pulling off a heist in Dalaran. Cards from this expansion will have mechanics that are similar to the past expansions. New card keywords include scheme, spells that increases its effectiveness after each turn that it remains in a player's hand, twinspell, spells that leaves a copy of itself in a player's hand after using it for the first time, and lackeys, a specific set of minions that are generated by other cards that are 1/1 in power with a differing battlecry. Rise of Shadows includes a solo adventure mode called \\"The Dalaran Heist\\", formatted similar to the Monster Hunt and Dungeon Run, though it requires the player to pay for four of the five chapters with in-game gold or with real money; it was released on May 16, 2019. At the start of a run in a chapter, the player selects one of nine minions, which align with the game's standard classes, and fights through eight bosses of increasing difficulty, gaining rewards and additional cards to fill their deck. A new feature includes points during this ascension where the player can do a small bit of deck manipulation, such as removing a card, adding a card, or adding a bonus boost to a card in the next match it is played. Completing certain achievements within the challenge can unlock alternate class powers or different starting decks. Completing a chapter's boss successfully grants Rise card packs, and completing all five chapters gives additional bonus rewards including card backs. =Saviors of Uldum= Saviors of Uldum was announced on July 1, 2019, released on August 6. Thematically it follows after events of Rise of Shadows, where Rafaam and the League of E.V.I.L. have stolen the floating city of Dalaran and have moved it to the Uldum desert. The expansion also links to the previous League of Explorers, with the main four heroes from that expansion poised to battle Rafaam and his allies. Among new additions include cards with keywords \\"Reborn\\" that bring back dead minions but with one health and \\"Plague\\" spells that affect all minions on the battlefield equally. Legendary Quest Cards, last used in Journey to Un'Goro, were reintroduced for each of the nine classes. The single-player campaign, called Tombs of Terror, was released on September 17, 2019. Tombs of Terror has five chapters, each requiring the player to pay for three (first and final ones are free) of the five chapters with in-game gold or with real money. Each chapter ends with a final boss with additional health compared to regular bosses except the final boss's health is persistent between attempts. Beating all four of these bosses unlocks the final chapter. Players play with dual-class heroes so they can use cards from two classes. Defeating five bosses in each chapter awards three Saviors of Uldum packs and completing all chapters awards a golden classic pack and card back. =Descent of Dragons= Descent of Dragons was announced at BlizzCon 2019 and was released on December 10, 2019. The expansion features the keyword Invoke that when played will use the Galakrond hero power and power up the Galakrond card in a player's deck, as well as Side Quests that are easier to complete when compared to the legendary quests. The expansion includes a solo adventure, the fifth one released, called \\"Galakrond's Awakening\\" that was first released on January 21, 2020; it features separate stories of the League of E.V.I.L. and the League of Explorers facing off until they reach a final showdown and it includes an additional 35 cards and two card backs (if heroic mode is defeated) for players to collect. =Demon Hunter Initiate= Demon Hunter Initiate was a set released on April 2, 2020, shortly before the release of Ashes of Outland. This set is made entirely of demon hunter cards, assisting the first new class added to the game since the original release to have an expanded card choice in the Standard format. Once the Initiate set rotates in 2022, the development team plans to add demon hunter cards to the classic set. =Ashes of Outland= Ashes of Outland was announced on March 17, 2020 and was released on April 7, 2020; it is the first expansion of the Year of the Phoenix and introduces the first new hero class in the game's history, the Demon Hunter, bringing the total number of classes to ten. The Demon Hunter's hero power Demon Claws is a one mana cost power to give a +1 attack bonus to the hero. Several of the Demon Hunter class cards introduce the Outcast keyword which triggers an effect if the card is in the far left or right of the player's hand, thus requiring the player to play cards in a specific order to gain that effect. In addition, the set's release included a rework of the Priest class's basic and classic set, replacing some of its cards with new ones as to provide the class with lower-mana support cards that had been lacking and leading to the class struggling against other classes and as well as moving some of the Priest cards to the Hall of Fame that do not fit the class identity. =Scholomance Academy= Scholomance was released on August 6, 2020.Scholomance Academy The set includes dual class cards, similar to the three class concept introduced in ‚ÄúMean Streets‚Äù but limited to two classes. A new mechanic for minions is introduced called Spellburst, it triggers an effect just once after playing a spell. Each class has Study Spells, letting players Discover a card, as well as reducing the mana cost of the next card of the type discovered.

The design is out of production. The boat was built by Mirage Yachts in Canada and was their first production design. It is a development of the Cuthbertson & Cassian designed Northern 1/4 Ton. Design Dick and Irene Steffen owned a yacht dealership for C&C; Yachts, in Pointe Claire, Quebec. The company had been very successful selling C&C; boats, but the C&C; line did not offer a boat smaller than the C&C; 27 at that time. Dick Steffen was a competitive sailing racer and thought that there would be a good market for a C&C-built; 24 foot keelboat for MORC racing.

One factor driving the Mirage 24's strong sales was its racing record in MORC class events. Even 15 years after its introduction a Mirage 24 won the production boat division in the MORC national championships. Caught off guard by the success of the design, C&C; decided to produce a competitor, the C&C; 25, which was very similar to the Mirage 24's design. The Mirage 24 continued to sell well and usually beat the C&C; 25 in competition. The Mirage 24 is a small recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass.

It is roughly bounded by Rose, Kalamazoo, State, Howard, Michigan, and Division streets. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description The East Mitchell Street Historic District occupies 31 blocks, and contains 294 residential properties, of which 278 are historically contributing to the district. The houses are predominantly frame structures, to stories high. Architectural styles include Victorian, Queen Anne, Shingle style, Colonial Revival, Radford-type, Bungalow, and other period designs, dating from the late 1800s through the 1930s. The district also contains four churches, a parochial school, and a public school. The central portion of the neighborhood runs along East Mitchell Street, where the residences tend to be larger and more elaborately detailed. East Mitchell runs westward and downhill into the central downtown area of Petoskey, and the East Mitchell Street Historic District lies on parallel streets both north and south of East Mitchell. Landscaping in the district includes a profusion of shade trees and shallow front lawns, sometimes banked behind low retaining walls. Despite physical alterations of many houses (in particular enclosing porches), the overall historic appearance of the district remains intact due to retention of important design elements, and collections of structures with high historic integrity. The institutional structures in the neighborhood include: *Emmanuel Episcopal Church (1020 Mitchell) - The church was constructed in 1958, and exhibits a post-World War II version of Gothic Revival architecture. The nearby parish house and parsonage was constructed in 1938. *First Presbyterian Church (461 Mitchell) - This church was constructed in 1899 as a Gothic Revival/Queen Anne structure, and was remodeled in 1952 in a Colonial Revival design. *Temple B'nai Israel (501 Michigan) - Originally constructed by the Parr Baptist congregation in 1881 and moved to this site in 1910, the Temple B'nai Israel is a Victorian Gothic Revival structure. *Parr Memorial Baptist Church (502 Michigan) - This church was constructed in 1910, and exhibits an early 20th century version of Gothic Revival architecture. *St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church and School (500 block of Howard) - The St. Francis Xavier parish first occupied the site of the current complex in 1879. The church complex contains four buildings: a large brick Gothic Revival church erected in 1903-08, a two-story Gothic Revival monastery erected in 1903, a two-story Spanish Mission Style school from 1927 (with a modern rear addition), and a two-story brick rectory. *Old Petoskey Senior High and Central Elementary School (600 block of Howard) - The old high school building is a two-story brick structure of Classical Revival design, erected in 1913. The Central School addition to the school is an Art Deco building constructed in 1929. History The East Mitchell Street Historic District grew as Petoskey grew, and has served as a neighborhood where a cross section of Petoskey citizens lived, ranging from prominent businessmen to laborers. Many of the houses appear to be constructed from ready-to-use architectural designs. What is likely the oldest structure in the neighborhood, at 519 Kalamazoo Street, dates from 1877. Earlier structures were predominantly Victorian and Queen Anne designs, but at the turn of the century more Colonial Revival houses were constructed. Bungalow houses were also popular in the neighborhood, and a few Prairie and International designs were also executed further into the 20th century.

After several years, Dufault and her independent research team were able to find a direct connection between inorganic mercury and glucose levels in the blood that showed dietary inorganic mercury exposure may be a risk factor in the development of diabetes  Career and work in Indian Country  Renee Dufault earned her Doctorate of Health Education (D.H.Ed.) degree from A.T. Still University in Missouri, and a B.S. in the Environmental Sciences from the University of California Davis (UCD). In the 1970s, Dufault enlisted in the U.S. Army as a medical laboratory technician. She then served in the Navy as an Industrial Hygiene Officer before transferring to the United States Public Health Service. While in the Public Health Service, she taught a training course at United Tribes Technical College as part of the Indian Country Environmental Hazard Assessment Project. She also developed a healthy diet tutorial for the Fort Peck Tribal Community College. The tutorial was used as an intervention tool for improving dietary behavior in tribal college students. It helped the students to reduce their intake of highly processed foods and increase their intake of whole foods while reducing their blood glucose and inorganic mercury levels.[Smithsonian]. Dufault has remained connected to various tribes throughout her career. During her Federal career, Dufault worked for the National Institutes of Health, the Environmental Protection Agency, Shoshone-Paiute Tribes and the Food and Drug Administration. She now works as an independent researcher and writer.  Whistleblower  In 2004, Dufault began researching the mercury cycle on behalf of the FDA, which involved, among other things, analyzing a number of food products listing HFCS as either the first or second ingredient on the label. An EPA colleague inspired Dufault to follow up on this science because the caustic soda (lye) produced by the mercury cell chlorine industry likely contained mercury as a residue. During the course of her investigation, she found out that the biggest user of mercury cell chlorine products was the corn refining industry. In a confidential interview with a corn refiner, Dufault learned mercury cell caustic soda was used primarily by the corn refiners in their manufacturing process to lengthen the shelf life of corn syrups. Dufault enlisted the help of several colleagues inside and outside government to test whether high fructose corn syrup or products containing high fructose corn syrup contained trace amounts of mercury. While her research team initially tested only 20 samples, 45% of the samples contained trace amounts of mercury. Dufault then sent additional virgin samples of HFCS to two different laboratories, in order to independently confirm her results. Acting as third parties, the federal and academic laboratories tested and independently verified the presence of low levels of mercury in the HFCS samples and foods containing HFCS. In October 2005, Dufault, and her extramural academic colleagues presented their preliminary findings to the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN). At that time, Dufault was asked to halt the investigation. In 2006, Dufault attempted to publish the findings of her research on mercury levels contained within HFCS, but was denied the usage of the federal extramural data. She quit her position in 2008, citing her intention to make her research public, and a belief that the FDA no longer supported her work.  Macroepigenetics  Dufault also developed and published a scientific model to explain the side effects of HFCS consumption called ‚Äúmacroepigenetics‚Äù. This model describes the dietary factors that impact gene behavior in the human body to bring about conditions of autism or ADHD. This model can be used by researchers and physicians who want to guard against these chronic developmental disorders and improve health outcomes. The model established a possible link between autism and certain environmental and dietary factors, including HFCS consumption, which has been shown to cause losses in zinc and calcium, Such losses can impair a child's ability to flush toxic metals (such as Mercury) from his or her system, and impact the developing brain. Since the theory of \\"macroepigenetics\\" was originally introduced by Dufault, other researchers have found additional evidence to support the model.  Current work  Dufault founded the Food Ingredient and Health Research Institute, a non-profit that advocates for food ingredient safety, better food and nutrition education and research. Since leaving the FDA, Dufault has identified two separate ways that mercury can enter high fructose corn syrup and products containing high fructose corn syrup. She has also shown a link between mercury and chronic health conditions such as diabetes, autism and ADHD. In 2017, she argued that inorganic mercury may be one reason why autism impacts boys more often than girls. Dufault is currently looking at food labeling requirements in other countries that warn consumers about the food ingredients that contribute to the development of ADHD and autism.  Unsafe at Any Meal  Unsafe At Any Meal: What the FDA Does Not Want You to Know About the Foods You Eat was published on May 1, 2017, by Square One Publication. The book is based on Dufault's independent research, conducted during her time with the FDA, and includes supporting studies conducted by others. She describes the process whereby various heavy metals, such as mercury and other toxic substances, can be found in trace amounts in many products commonly sold at the supermarket. She also discusses the FDA's refusal to act, provides advice on how to avoid these contaminants, and discusses the effectiveness of regulations designed to protect the public.

The school, recently rebuilt in 1915 due to a fire, required a library to meet new Georgia accreditation. The library officially changed its name to Nancy Guinn Memorial Library in 1921. Nancy Guinn was the founder and president of the Conyers Civic League which worked to construct the library originally, and helped establish a committee to bring in more volumes to the growing library. In 1953 the library became part of the DeKalb Regional Library System, a three-county regional library system including Newton, DeKalb and Rockdale counties. These libraries worked in relation with each other until 1989 when all three libraries decided to disband and form their own library systems in their respective counties. =The Blade Sculpture= The current logo of the library features a 25 foot abstract painted steel and fiberglass sculpture known as \\"The Blade\\".

She studied at the University of Puerto Rico and graduated from American University in Washington, D.C., with a bachelor of arts in international studies. She was subsequently awarded an honorary doctorate in humanities by Hood College in Frederick, Maryland. Career Votaw was appointed by President Jimmy Carter to serve as cochair of the National Advisory Committee on Women. She served as president of the Interamerican Commission of Women of the Organization of American States in 1979‚Äì80. The first president of that body, she remains just one of two women from the United States to have served as the commission's president. During her career, Votaw travelled to more than 80 countries and met with more than 50 heads of state. She was a member of the U.S. delegation to the International Women's Year conference, attending conferences in Mexico City, Copenhagen, Nairobi and Beijing. Votaw was chief of staff for Puerto Rico's Resident Commissioner Jaime B. Fuster from 1985‚Äì91. As the first Hispanic female chief of staff for a Member of Congress, she worked to address the challenges facing 3.5 million Puerto Ricans living on the island and to build a strong network for women in the Federal Government. After leaving the U.S. House of Representatives, she was involved with the Girl Scouts of the USA, United Way of America, and the Alliance for Children and Families. Votaw was an author of a number of publications on women, including Puerto Rican Women: Mujeres Puertorriquenas, Notable American Women, Libro de Oro, and To Ourselves Be True. These stories highlight the accomplishments of women, particularly Hispanic women, who led remarkable lives and serve as role models for younger women. Activism As a defender of civil rights for diverse populations, especially Hispanics, Votaw received the Hispanic Heritage Award for Education, the Mexican American Women's Primeras Award, and numerous awards from NASA, FEW, and national and local civic organizations. Votaw served on the boards of directors of numerous women's organizations, including the National Conference of Puerto Rican Women, which she served as national president and president of the DC chapter, the Overseas Education Fund of the League of Women's Voters, the Girl Scouts of the USA, the International Girl Guides, the National Women's Political Caucus and its Appointments Coalition, the Mid-Atlantic Equity Center, and the National Coalition for Women and Girls in Education.

The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media. Awards In 1992, Votaw was inducted into the Maryland Women's Hall of Fame for her numerous contributions to the community. For her leadership in education, she was a 1996 recipient of the National Hispanic Heritage Award, presented at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.

Most influenced by her multicultural upbringing, with a South Korean mother and a Native American father, her work reflects the struggle of identity, modernity, and stereotypes revolving around Native American culture. Life Yepa-Pappan was born in South Korea while her father was stationed in the country with the U.S. Army. She grew up in Chicago where her family immigrated when she was very young. She attended the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe with a degree in 2 and 3 dimensional art in 1992, before she proceeded to Columbia College, Chicago. She met her husband, Chris Pappan, while attending I.A.I.A. They currently live in Chicago with their daughter. Artistry Drawing from traditional Jemez Pueblo and Korean imagery, Chicago's modern urbanism and science fiction, most of Yepa-Pappan's work aims to challenge the viewer with their concept of reality. She attempts to confront stereotypes and involves the coming generations to be culturally engaged. She takes photographs and digital images and layers and distorts them to create complex images to make bold statements. Yepa-Pappan uses the contrasts of her differing cultural lives to talk about living between two worlds and tends to pose questions to the viewer versus answering them.

The forest is seasonally flooded up to by whitewater rivers carrying nutrient-rich sediment from the Andes. The meandering rivers often shift course, creating a complex landscape of oxbow lakes, marshes, levees and bars, with grasslands, shrubs and forests in different stages of succession. During the extended flood periods fish enter the forest in search of fruit. The v√°rzea is accessible by the navigable rivers that run through it, and has suffered from extensive deforestation to extract timber and create pasture for livestock. Location The Iquitos v√°rzea has an area of in northwest Brazil, northeast Peru and northern Bolivia. The v√°rzea, or flooded forest, is found along seasonally flooded basins of tributaries of the upper Amazon River, and of the Amazon itself. To the west the Iquitos v√°rzea extends to the highest places where v√°rzea is found in the Amazon region. The eastern boundary is defined by the Iquitos arch, an ancient crystalline arch that crosses the Amazon basin. Beyond this arch the Iquitos v√°rzea ecoregion merges into the Purus v√°rzea ecoregion. The Iquitos v√°rzea is found along river sections within several other Amazon ecoregions. The southern sections of the Iquitos v√°rzea are in the Southwest Amazon moist forests. The v√°rzea forms the eastern boundary of the Ucayali moist forests and the Napo moist forests, and penetrates along river courses into both these ecoregions. It forms the southwest boundary of the Solim√µes-Japur√° moist forests. Physical The whitewater rivers carry sediments washed down from the Andes, which are deposited to form extremely fertile soil. The ecoregion is named after the Peruvian town of Iquitos on the Amazon, which floods twice a year, with floods lasting for up to 10 months. At its peak the forest is flooded by of water across a stretch along the river wide. The soil is made of alluvial and fluvial sediments deposited in the present Holocene epoch. The rivers meander through their floodplains and sometimes change course, creating oxbow lakes, levees, swales, point bars and short-lived islands. The shifting landscape holds large swathes of primary succession forest. Ecology The Iquitos v√°rzea ecoregion is in the Neotropical realm and the tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests biome. =Climate= The K√∂ppen climate classification is \\"Af\\": equatorial, fully humid. Yearly average temperatures range from a minimum of to a maximum of with a mean of . Temperatures are fairly constant throughout the year, slightly cooler in July and slightly warmer in December. Annual rainfall in the region is from . Monthly precipitation ranges from in July to in March. It typically rains on almost 300 days every year. =Flora= The floodplain holds forest mosaics, succession forest, aquatic vegetation in areas that are poorly drained and permanent swamps. The dominant vegetation is evergreen tropical forest. A few meters difference in elevation can have a major influence on the forest composition due to the effect of flooding. The flora also vary considerably depending on the soil and the stage of succession. The first vegetation to appear are grasses such as Gynerium sagittatum, Paspalum repens and Echinochloa polystachya. Woody shrubs then appear such as Adenaria floribunda, Alchornea castaneifolia and Salix martiana. Early succession trees follow including Annona hypoglauca, Astrocaryum jauari and Cecropia latiloba. The mature forests on old alluvial terraces hold trees of the genera Ceiba, Eschweilera, Hura, Spondias and Virola. These include Calycophyllum spruceanum, Ceiba samauma, Inga species, Cedrela odorata, Copaifera reticulata and Phytelephas macrocarpa. The ecoregion often has large stands of buriti palm (Mauritia flexuosa) and Jessenia batuaua. The understory includes monocots in the genus Heliconia and families Zingiberaceae and Marantaceae, palms and epiphytes. On the upper Purus River the Guazuma rosea palm is common. Piptadenia pteroclada is common on the Amazon. Near Iquitos there are stands holding Parkia inundabilis, Septotheca tessmannii, Coumarouna micrantha, Ceiba burchellii, Ochroma lagopus, Manilkara inundata and Iryanthera tessmannii. =Fauna= Bird near Nauta on the Mara√±√≥n River 227 species of mammals have been recorded in the ecoregion. Common land mammals include jaguar (Panthera onca), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), kinkajou (Potos flavus) and white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari). Primates include spider monkey (genus Ateles), white-fronted capuchin (Cebus albifrons), tufted capuchin (Sapajus apella), Venezuelan red howler (Alouatta seniculus), common squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus) and bald uakari (Cacajao calvus). Other mammals are the Amazon bamboo rat (Dactylomys dactylinus) and spiny tree-rats (genus Echimys). Mammals that are rarely found elsewhere include the black- shouldered opossum (Caluromysiops irrupta), rufous mouse opossum (Marmosa lepida), red mouse opossum (Marmosa rubra), sepia short-tailed opossum (Monodelphis adusta), Geoffroy's tailless bat (Anoura geoffroyi), Bogot√° yellow-shouldered bat (Sturnira bogotensis), Goeldi's marmoset (Callimico goeldii), Peruvian night monkey (Aotus miconax), equatorial saki (Pithecia aequatorialis) and Napo spiny rat (Proechimys quadruplicatus). Aquatic mammals include the Amazon river dolphin (Inia geoffrensis), tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis) and Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis). Endangered mammals include the white-bellied spider monkey (Ateles belzebuth), Peruvian spider monkey (Ateles chamek) and giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis). 624 species of birds have been reported. Endangered birds include the wattled curassow (Crax globulosa) and green-thighed parrot (Pionites leucogaster). There are 88 species of snakes and 30 species of lizards. Large reptiles include black caiman (Melanosuchus niger), yellow-spotted river turtle (Podocnemis unifilis) and green anaconda (Eunectes murinus). Endangered amphibians include Johnson's horned treefrog (Hemiphractus johnsoni). Large fish that live in the whitewater rivers enter the forest during the floods where they eat and disperse fruit. Fish include pacu (genera Metynnis and Mylossoma), tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum), pirarucu (Arapaima gigas), dusky narrow hatchetfish (Triportheus angulatus) and pirana (genus Serrasalmus). Smaller fish include angelfish (Pterophyllum scalare), blue discus (Symphysodon aequifasciatus), cichlids (genus Cichlasoma), characins (family Anostomidae), tetras (genera Hemigrammus and Hyphessobrycon), neon tetra (Paracheirodon innesi) and catfish (families Aspredinidae, Callichthyidae, Doradidae and Loricariidae). Status The World Wildlife Fund classes the ecoregion as \\"Vulnerable\\". Since the v√°rzea is found along navigable rivers it has been considerably affected by human activity. Large parts are used by smallholders for mixed agriculture and forestry. Other large areas are cleared and burned by ranchers to be replaced by grasses for livestock. This eliminates food sources for fish. Deforestation also causes heavy sedimentation, which also damages the habitat. In some areas valuable timber species have been eliminated, and tapirs and various primates are no longer found due to excessive hunting. Gold mining contaminates the rivers and intensive commercial fishing adds strain to the aquatic fauna. In Peru the Pacaya-Samiria National Reserve protects a large area in this ecoregion, and the Tambopata National Reserve protects a smaller portion.

Early history A 1797 caricature of 'A Volunteer Corps in Action'. Apart from the blue facings and breeches, the uniform is similar to that of the Bloomsbury and Inns of Court Volunteers. The 'Bloomsbury and Inns of Court Volunteers' was one of the Volunteer Corps raised in June 1797 during the French Revolutionary Wars. It was formed by the residents of the London district of Bloomsbury and the lawyers of the Inns of Court. Its uniform was depicted by Thomas Rowlandson as a red jacket with yellow facings, white breeches and black gaiters, with white cross-belts and a 'round hat' (similar to a Top hat) surmounted by a comb-like black plume.Rowlandson, Plate 8.Money Barnes, p. 122, Plate IV/5 and Appendix I. This unit was disbanded at the Peace of Amiens in 1802, and when it was resuscitated on the renewal of war in 1803, a separate St Giles's and St George's Bloomsbury Volunteers (known as the GGB) was raised in the parishes of St Giles-in-the-Fields and St George's, Bloomsbury. This unit continued until the return of peace in 1814. Rifle Volunteers The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs) composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need.Beckett. The formation of a new RVC for the parishes of St Giles and St George was agreed at a public meeting held at the Store Street Music Hall on 22 December 1859. The proposal was supported by Sir Samuel Morton Peto, the civil engineer and MP for Finsbury, and by Nevil Story Maskelyne of the British Museum (who later became one of the officers). The St Giles's and St George's Bloomsbury Rifles was officially formed on 31 March 1860 at the District Board of Works office in Holborn and was numbered as the 37th Middlesex RVC.Westlake, p. 174.Beckett, Appendix VII.Keeson, Appendix I: VIII.St Giles & St George's Bloomsbury Rifles at Regiments.org. Unlike in 1797, the lawyers formed their own corps in 1860: the 23rd (Inns of Court) Middlesex RVC at Lincoln's Inn and the 40th (Central London Rifle Rangers) Middlesex RVC at Gray's Inn.Westlake, pp. 171, 175. After formation, the corps was organised as;Westlake, p. 174. * Corps Headquarters at Local Board of Works, Holborn * No.1 Company * No.2 Company * No.3 Company * No.4 Company The new Bloomsbury Rifles consisted of one company, which joined the 4th Administrative Battalion of Middlesex RVCs. It maintained its independence despite suggestions that it should merge with the 28th (St Pancras) Middlesex RVC, and the existence of another corps in Bloomsbury, the 19th, formed at the Working Men's College by Thomas Hughes.Westlake, p. 168. The Bloomsbury Rifles had four companies within a year, was made independent of the 4th Admin Bn in 1861, and its strength had risen to eight companies by 1866. The unit adopted a uniform of Rifle green with green facings. The title of St Giles's and St George's Bloomsbury was officially added to its number in 1869, when the 19th (Working Men's College, Bloomsbury) Middlesex RVC was obliged to drop the 'Bloomsbury' from its title.Money Barnes, Appendix III. Training The Foundling Hospital and grounds. From the beginning the Foundling Hospital in Guilford Street gave permission for the Bloomsbury Rifles to use its grounds (Coram's Fields) for drill and soon the headquarters was established at the Hospital. Old Russian muskets captured in the Crimean War were at first used for drill. In its early days the corps organised a private camp at Wimbledon Common, on the ranges of the National Rifle Association, and in 1871 it inaugurated the tradition of marching to the annual Volunteer Review at Brighton. When the Cardwell Reforms introduced 'Localisation of the Forces' in 1873, the 37th Middlesex was brigaded, together with several other London and Middlesex Volunteer and Militia battalions, in Brigade No 53 & 54 under the Regular Rifle Brigade. The Volunteer units of these brigades met once a year for a training camp.Army List, various dates.Spiers, p. 198.Grierson, p. 192. Drill Hall The Drill Hall, Chenies Street (the darker red brick building on the right with the mock-medieval tower), is now the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts Studios. The last former member of the St Giles and St George's (GGB) Volunteers of 1803‚Äì14 died in 1877, and a High Court ruling allowed the newer unit to take over its remaining funds (¬£2000). This sum was put towards building a dedicated drill hall and battalion HQ. Designed by the architect Samuel Knight, an officer in the corps, and costing ¬£11,000, The Drill Hall in Chenies Street was built in 1882‚Äì3.Cherry & Pevsner, p. 334. Reorganisation The Volunteer Force was reorganised in 1880, when the Bloomsbury Rifles were renumbered as the 19th (St Giles and St George's Bloomsbury) Middlesex RVC (causing some confusion with the former 19th (Working Men's College), now renumbered 10th) and the following year it became the 6th Volunteer Battalion of the Rifle Brigade without changing its title. The Stanhope Memorandum of December 1888 introduced a Mobilisation Scheme for Volunteer units, which would assemble in their own brigades at key points in case of war. In peacetime these brigades provided a structure for collective training.Beckett, pp. 135, 185‚Äì6.Dunlop, pp. 60‚Äì1. The Bloomsbury Rifles were assigned to the North London Brigade. The Bloomsbury Rifles Freemason Lodge No 2362 was formed by members of the battalion on 1 May 1890. Second Boer War After 'Black Week' in December 1899, the War Office accepted the offer of the Lord Mayor of London, Sir Alfred Newton, to raise a force (the City Imperial Volunteers (CIVs)) from among the London Volunteer units for service in the Second Boer War. The Bloomsbury Rifles provided a detachment of one officer and 39 other ranks, who served in South Africa between February and October 1900. A further 58 members of the battalion served with the Imperial Yeomanry, two with the King's Royal Rifle Corps, and 29 with the Royal Army Medical Corps. For providing these contingents the Bloomsbury Rifles was awarded the Battle honour South Africa 1900‚Äì02. Territorial Force When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force under the Haldane Reforms of 1908,Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. the Middlesex RVCs were transferred to the new all-Territorial London Regiment. The 19th (GGB) Middlesex RVC was merged into the 1st (Queen Victoria's Rifles) Middlesex RVC to form the 9th Bn London Regiment (QVR), which continued to use the QVRs' HQ at Davies Street. The 12th Bn London Regiment (The Rangers) (formerly the 22nd Middlesex RVC (Central London Rangers)) took over the Bloomsbury Rifles' Drill Hall in Chenies Street on 25 June 1908, and it remained in use until 1960.Wheeler-Holohan & Wyatt, p. 11.Westlake, pp. 163‚Äì4, 174.Money Barnes, p. 220.London Gazette 20 March 1908.

Similar to Greek sophists, some Indian rhetors in the seventh century BCE held public debates on religion to the public's amusement. The Vedic verses, composed over three thousand years ago, use similes, similar to ancient Greek poetry. The ancient Indian epics, the Ramayana and Mahabharata, include many speeches and debates that are examples of rhetoric. Indian rhetoric utilizes systems of categorization. The Upanishads, a collection of ancient Vedic philosophical dialogues, place some value in categorizing technical terms. Indian Buddhist rhetoric places value in calm and humorous discourse. = Nyaya Rhetoric = Lloyd (2007) has proposed Nyaya‚Äôs inclusion in the field of rhetorical studies, exploring its methods within their historical context, comparing its approach to the ‚Äútraditional logical syllogism, and relating it to the contemporary perspectives Stephen Toulmin, Kenneth Burke, and Chaim Perelman.‚Äù Nyaya is a Sanskrit word which means just or right and refers to ‚Äúthe science of right and wrong reasoning‚Äù (Radhakrishnan & Moore, 1957, p. 356). Sutra is also a Sanskrit word which means string or thread. Here Sutra refers to a collection of aphorism in the form of a manual. Each Sutra is a short rule usually consisted of one or two sentences. Example of a Sutra: ‚ÄúReality is truth, and what is true is so, irrespective of whether we know it is, or are aware of that truth.‚Äù The Nyaya Sutra is an ancient Indian Sanskrit text composed by Aksapada Gautama. It is the foundational text of the Nyaya School of Hindu Philosophy. The date when the text was composed, and the biography of its author is unknown. It is estimated that the text was composed between 6th-century BCE and 2nd-century CE. Zimmer (2013) has said that the text may have been composed by more one author, over a period of time. Radhakrishan and Moore (1957) placed its origin in the ‚Äúthird century BC‚Ä¶..though some of the contents of the Nyaya Sutra are certainly a post-Christian era‚Äù (p. 36). Vidyabhusana (1930) stated that the ancient school of Nyaya extended over a period of one thousand years, beginning with Gotama about 550 BC and ending with Vatsyayana about 400 AD. Nyaya provides significant insight into the Indian rhetoric. Naya presents an argumentative approach that works a rhetor how to decide about any argument.

During his nearly four-decade long military career, he fought in the Caucasian, Crimean, and Turkish wars.  Caucasus mountains  Prince Dadiani was the third son of Levan V Dadiani, Prince of Mingrelia, and his wife, Princess Marta, n√©e Tsereteli. In 1839, he graduated from St. Petersburg Page Corps and was commissioned as a khorunzhy in a Cossack regiment. Assigned to the Caucasian Corps in 1842, Dadiani fought in the Caucasian War against the mountaineers of Dagestan in 1844 and Chechnya from 1846 to 1848. He particularly distinguished himself in putting down a rebellion in Samurzakano in 1849, winning the Order of St. Vladimir, 4th Class. In August 1853, he was fighting again in Chechnya, when the death of his brother, David, Prince of Mingrelia, compelled Konstantin Dadiani to return to Mingrelia to become part of the regency council for his underage nephew Niko presided by David's widow Princess Ekaterina.  Crimean War  Dadiani's return to Mingrelia coincided with the outbreak of the Crimean War, followed by landing of the Ottoman troops in Mingrelia in May 1854. He assumed command of a Mingrelian militia and engaged the superior Ottoman forces at Koki and Kokati on 25 October 1854. With the Ottoman advance, the Russian regular troops retreated from Mingrelia and parts of Mingrelian militia deserted their ranks. Dadiani, with a remaining force, moved to the highlands to protect the family of his late brother. After the Ottoman withdrawal, Konstantin Dadiani marshaled his militia again and joined the Guria detachment in its operations against the Ottoman forces.  Later career  During a peasant revolt in Mingrelia in 1857, Konstantin Dadiani and his brother, Grigory, were recalled to Tiflis, while Ekaterina was summoned to St. Petersburg. Thus, the regency was sidelined from Mingrelia's government and its autonomy was effectively abrogated. The family accepted the accomplished fact; both Konstantin and Grigory remained in the imperial service. The former was made aide-de-camp to the Tsar Alexander II in 1858 and promoted to major-general in 1866. During the 1877‚Äì1878 war with the Ottoman Empire, Dadiani commanded a unit operating on the eastern Black Sea coastline to block Ottoman landings. On 15 June 1877, he was wounded during bombardment by a squadron of Ottoman warships. After the war, Dadiani was promoted to lieutenant-general and enlisted in reserves of the Caucasian Army. In 1887, he served as an arbiter in the Senaki uyezd.

After experiencing a prophetic vision in which God instructed her to retake the land and livestock, she led an unsuccessful rebellion on the island against the Williamson-Balfour Company, intending to create a theocracy centered on Roman Catholicism and Rapa Nui spiritual values. Conversion Angata was born around 1853 into the Miru clan. Between 1864 and 1866, the French Picpus missionaries established themselves on Easter Island and converted many of the Rapa Nui people to Christianity during a period of severe population collapse caused by Peruvian slave raiding and the introduction of European diseases. In 1871, Angata and her first husband, Daniel Manu Heu Roroa, traveled to Mangareva in the Gambier Islands with Father Hippolyte Roussel. She had two children from this marriage. Her husband reportedly beat her so severely that it caused her to become permanently hunchbacked. Her cousins killed him in retaliation for the abuse. On Mangareva, she began learning the Christian scriptures by heart. Father Roussel trained her to become a catechist or lay teacher for the new Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary. Return to Easter Island Pakomƒ´o in traditional loincloth, December 1886 When Angata returned to Easter Island in October 1879, she worked as co-catechist and assistant to Nicol√°s Pakarati and Pakomƒ´o MƒÅ ªori Ure Kino (c. 1816/1836‚Äì1908/1909), whom she had married on Mangareva. They became the island's principal spiritual leaders in the absence of a resident missionary. Angata and her second husband had six children together. The children supposedly inherited European Basque features from their father, despite Angata and Pakomio claiming full-blood Rapa Nui descent. In 1892, Angata organized many of the women on the island to support her cousin Sim√©on Riro KƒÅinga (both were members of the Miru clan) for the position of ‚ÄòAriki or King of Rapa Nui against the rival claimant Enrique Ika, also a Miru. The position was left vacant by the death of Atamu Tekena, who had ceded the island to Chile in 1888. It has been argued that he was elected mainly because of his good looks, but a significant part of his success was also due Angata's strong influence with the people. Riro unsuccessfully attempted to reclaim indigenous sovereignty in the absence of direct Chilean control from 1892 to 1896. However, Chile reasserted its claim, and the island was later leased to Enrique Merlet and his ranching company. They restricted the islanders' access to most of their land except a walled- off settlement at Hanga Roa, which they were not allowed to leave without permission. The young king attempted to protest the company's abuse but died under suspicious circumstances at Valpara√≠so. 1914 rebellion Merlet's manager outlawed the native kingship on the island, although Enrique Ika and Mois√©s Tu ªu Hereveri were briefly elected kings. Angata would assume nominal leadership of the Miru clan and lead the opposition to the company's control. The Williamson-Balfour Company later took control of the ranch from Merlet and continued the mistreatment of the Rapa Nui people. In 1914, Angata had a prophetic vision that Merlet was dead. This inspired her to lead an unsuccessful rebellion against the company, stating that God wanted the islanders to retake the island, kill the ranch's livestock, and have a feast. On 30 June 1914, she sent her son-in-law Daniera Maria Teave Haukena to the company manager Henry Percy Edmunds with a declaration that the natives intended to retake the land and livestock from the company. The rebellion was crushed on 5 August when the Chilean naval vessel Banquedano arrived and arrested four of the ringleaders. Comandante Almanzor Hern√°ndez declared that the Rapa Nui had been \\"fully justified in doing everything they had done\\". He later commented he was glad they had not murdered Edmunds. None of the natives were punished, and three of the imprisoned leaders were released but her son- in-law Daniera was deported from the island. Carcasses of dead cattle in front of a house at Hanga Roa, 1914 The rebellion, which was intended to establish a kingdom of God based on Rapa Nui understandings, had the negative effect of provoking the Chilean government into imposing a stronger administration. A separate colonial official (not affiliated to the company) was appointed. The island was opened to immigration from the mainland, decreasing the influence of the native islanders. Despite these changes, the independence movement has continued on the island to the present day. The walls confining the Rapa Nui to Hanga Roa were torn down in 1966. During the Mana Expedition to Easter Island in 1914, the English anthropologist Katherine Routledge met and spoke with Angata at the height of her rebellion. Routledge tried to dissuade the \\"prophetess\\" as she referred to her, and her people, from continuing their raids and killing the island's livestock. She describes Angata during their interview: Angata died in December 1914, months after her meeting with Routledge. Her funeral on 29 January 1915 was attended by the English anthropologist. She was buried at the cemetery of Holy Cross Church, Hanga Roa, next to other early Catholic missionaries: Eug√®ne Eyraud, Nicol√°s Pakarati, and Sebastian Englert.

Gameplay The Witch and the Hundred Knight 2 is an action role-playing game with a top-down isometric view. Players fight their way through a variety of levels as Hundred Knight, a magical creature that can be equipped with five types of weapons: swords, hammers, staffs, lances, and spears. Each weapon type differs in attack range, speed, and motion. By changing the order of use, players create many different combos. Plot The world of Kevala is corrupted by the Witch Disease, an illness developed in children under age 10. Its cause is unknown. A third eye appears on the forehead of those infected with the Witch Disease, and when the eye opens they awaken as a witch. A girl named Amalie lives in a remote village after she lost her parents to a witch. Her younger sister Milm is the only family she has left. One day, Milm suddenly disappears and Amalie eagerly searches for her. When she is about to give up, Milm shows up again, covered in mud and with the witch's eye on her forehead. Upon the beginning of the game's events, Milm is seen being operated on by the Weiss Ritter, an anti-witch organization, to cure the Witch Disease. It seems to fail and result in her death, but then a witch named Chelka awakens in Milm's body and destroys the entire building. This also causes Milm's Hundred Knight doll to come alive as well, and begin fighting for Chelka. When Amalie discovers that Milm is alive and Chelka is in her body, the two of them move into the abandoned Durga Castle and Hundred Knight starts obeying Amalie's orders as well. They forge an uneasy relationship, with Amalie unwilling to hurt Chelka, and Chelka unable to harm Amalie lest Milm come to the surface. The Hundred Knight's exploits defeating the witch Isabel are credited to Amalie, causing her to become a Holy Valkyrie. However, when Amalie realizes that the Valkyries are murdering the children with the Witch Disease that the WR cannot operate on, she starts to doubt her mission. She is sent to defeat Prim, the world's strongest witch, which the Hundred Knight does successfully, but they find records of misdeeds by the WR in Prim's castle. This leads Amalie to infiltrate the WR and discover that they have been covering up the fact that there is no cure for the Witch Disease, and she is actually an artificial witch who was never \\"cured\\". This causes her to be forced to fight one of the Valkyries, defeating her. For this, she is branded a traitor and sentenced to death, though she surrenders willingly, losing hope that Milm will ever return to normal. However, Chelka rescues her. They defeat another of the Valkyries and, later, go after Theodore, the leader of the WR, though they are stopped by the final Valkyrie, Gabrielle, who reveals herself to be Francesca, the first witch, and actually a \\"Holy Maiden\\". They attempt to kidnap Milm, whose third eye is actually one of the three eyes of the all-powerful witch Rangda, and use the eyes to rebirth the world into a twisted utopia, but they are stopped with the help of Prim. However, the end of the world continues regardless. Chelka and the others realize that the world has been going in an endless cycle for thousands of years, and discover a supply of mana that was removed from the cycle. They decide to absorb this \\"Manathree\\" and fight Rangda directly to break the cycle and prevent the world's destruction. The Hundred Knight succeeds in defeating Rangda's illusions and Chelka destroys Rangda herself. They realize that Rangda created the cycle and isolated the world from the multiverse to prevent the godlike interdimensional being, Niike, from destroying it as he did once before. Chelka decides to return the world to the multiverse, and all the other characters, living and dead, are reborn in a new world as non-witches. Development The Witch and the Hundred Knight 2 was first revealed in May 2015 through a short video in which Nippon Ichi Software confirmed that the game was in development. In October 2016, director Kenta Asano told Dengeki PlayStation that the PlayStation 4 was chosen as platform for the game because The Witch and the Hundred Knight Revival, an enhanced port of the original game for the system, was well received. A Winter 2017 release was announced at the same time. Later that month, the February 23 release date was revealed. The game was released in North America and Europe in March 2018. Reception The Witch and the Hundred Knight 2 received a 33/40 score in issue 1472 of Famitsu upon its Japanese release. Commercially, the game was not as successful in Japan as its predecessor. According to Media Create, only 13,421 physical copies of the game were sold during the week of release, compared to 49,209 copies in the week of launch of the first game for PlayStation 3 in 2013. The Witch and the Hundred Knight 2 was met with a mixed reception upon its western release, holding an average critic score of 61 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 24 reviews. Most reviewers criticised the game's pacing, repetitiveness, and lack of innovation and improvements on the first game.

His best-known works consist of resonating concrete chambers that are tuned to react to certain pitches. K√ºhne's site-specific sculptures stand in public spaces in Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Germany and Uruguay. Artistic career Between 1999 and 2001, K√ºhne created the \\"sound station\\", one of the seven \\"sense stations\\" in the park of the senses in Weissensee, Berlin. K√ºhne developed the Space and Frequency project with Robyn Schulkowsky in 2005, with monumental and interdisciplinary exhibitions in New York City, Helsinki and Brussels. He curated several exhibitions of sound art, such as Espacio y Frecuencia in the National Museum of Visual Arts (MNAV) and Rumbo al Ruido in the MAPI Museum for Pre-Columbian Art, both in Montevideo, Uruguay. He created Cromatico, a permanent sound sculpture on Tallinn's Sound Festival Grounds, for the Tuned City Tallinn event in 2011. Cromatico is tuned to the F chromatic scale, with each of the 12 chambers corresponding to a pitch along the scale from 88 Hz (F) to 164 Hz (E). It won the Grand Prix of the Concrete Building of the Year competition by Estonian Concrete Association in 2011. His other contribution to the soundscape of Tallinn was the idea to use the historic Seaplane Harbour hangar, a pre-modernist concrete structure, as a \\"sonic landmark\\". The hangar became one of the pieces of \\"aural architecture\\" where artists experimented and worked during Tuned City Tallinn 2011. Tv√≠s√∂ngur, opened in 2012, consists of five interconnected concrete domes on the hillside above Sey√∞isfj√∂r√∞ur in east Iceland. It is a tribute to the Icelandic cultural heritage of polyphonic duets, or \\"twin-singing\\". The five domes, reaching a height between 2 and 4 meters, amplify and resonate with the tones of consecutive fifths, which form the basic structure of the musical form. The sculpture is accessible to visitors, who can experiment with the sounds. The choice of building material is also related to Iceland, which has a tradition of monumental concrete buildings such as Hallgr√≠mskirkja. Two years later, K√ºhne built a similar installation, the Hailuoto Organum, in Finland. Together with a working group of 8 Aalto University postgraduate students, K√ºhne created a virtual, playable version of the Sibelius Monument inside Ateneum, the National Gallery of Finland in Helsinki, as part of a larger exhibit honouring Jean Sibelius' jubilee year. The piece was later presented at ISEA 2015 in Vancouver, Canada. K√ºhne founded the Experimental Format of Form and Sound (Taller Experimental Forma y Sonido) in 2005 and the International Festival of Sound Art Monteaudio (Festival Internacional de Arte Sonoro Monteaudio) in 2013, both at the University of the Republic in Montevideo. One of his works is on permanent display in the city: tub√≥fono, a musical instrument located in Parque Rod√≥. He lives in Berlin and Montevideo.

John Prabhakar, Preaching Contextually: A Case with Rural Dalits in India, Notion Press, Chennai, 2016. Churches comprising nearly a million members per present statistics. Contribution =Comparative analysis= In 1957, Solomon made a comparative analysis of suffering as viewed in two ancient scriptures, one from the Ancient Near East and the other from the Indian subcontinent where he provides the respective literature on suffering in both the scriptures, its genesis and outlook and some common insights between the two, particularly on retribution (see Klaus Koch (1955): Is there a Doctrine of Retribution in the Old Testament).Klaus Koch, Is there a Doctrine of Retribution in the Old Testament ? in James L. Crenshaw (Edited), Theodicy in the Old Testament, Fortress Press, Philadelphia, 1983, pp. 57-87. Solomon highlights the example of Job (biblical figure) where the sufferer endures it with the thought of a glimmer of hope some day or the other reposing unflinching trust in God. Old Testament Scholars down the line have drawn parallelsS. Prabhakara Rao and M. Prakasa Reddy, Job and His Satan - Parallels in Indian Scripture in Zeitschrift f√ºr die Alttestamentliche Wissenschaft, Volume 91, Issue 3, Berlin, 1979. on Prophet Job and Raja Satya Harishchandra providing scholarly insights into the problem of suffering endured by these two legendsMadanu Francis, Why the Innocent Suffer: Job and Harishchandra: Biblical and Puranic Expression, St. John's Regional Seminary, Hyderabad, 1998. and how they overcame it for a cause. A chronological analysis of the comparative literature on the problem of suffering in addition to the one by Solomon, reveals that John Bowker came out with Problems of Suffering in Religions of the World in 1970 where suffering as viewed by the diverse religions of the world has been presented.John Bowker, Problems of Suffering in Religions of the World, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1970. Later, in 1979, the Pune-based inquisitive Chemical engineers of the National Chemical Laboratory namely S. Prabhakara RaoS. Prabhakara Rao, S. Ponarathnam and S. L.

Prakasa ReddyM. Prakasa Reddy and James E. Sturm, Decomposition of ethane in radiolysis and in glow discharges: Temperature and Pressure Effects in Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© chimique, Volume 40, p.237 ff., 1975. came out with Job and His Satan - Parallels in Indian Scripture which was published in the German Old Testament scholarly journal, ZAW. A couple of years' later, David J. A. Clines came out with a research paper entitled In Search of the Indian Job where he provides a century of scholarly research on Job and Raja Satya Harishchandra that appeared in the Vetus Testamentum.D. J. A. Clines, In Search of the Indian Job in Vetus Testamentum, Volume 33, Fasc. 4, October 1983, pp. 398-418. Later in 1998, a Scholar at the St. Peter's Pontifical Seminary, Bangalore studying under Anthony Raymond Ceresko and Gnana Robinson researched specifically on Job and Harishchandra focusing on the problem of suffering. Solomon's research brought out the many facets of suffering where his scholarship is profoundly visible as he sheaves through the views on suffering in the Old Testament as he quotes from the Pentateuch and the other books of the Old Testament with a comprehensive bibliography but the conclusions that he drew are an eye opener for those viewing suffering as a reason of our own follies. In the final analysis, Solomon looks into the possibilities of a more humane understanding of suffering overcoming Dogma and providing for repentance or rather an opportunity to set right the past and move forward. Solomon wrote, The solution of the problem of suffering in Christianity is that God also suffers along with the sufferer and helps him to endure it for His glory. Solomon's work could best be understood if one were to look at a 1990G.

In the 1970s, Ecumenism brought together the different seminaries in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana with the starting of the near-ecumenical Andhra Christian Theological College in the year 1964James A.

Solomon's Church Society, the Samavesam of Telugu Baptist Churches was already running a seminary with English as a medium of instruction with Serampore affiliation for its B.D. whereas the new near-ecumenical venture offered L.Th. courses in Telugu as a medium of instruction. However, two years' later, the Ramayapatnam Baptist Theological Seminary through the efforts of both The Rev. Maurice Blanchard as well as The Rev. Louis F.

By 1972, Louis F. Knoll along with W. P. Peery led the integration of the B.D. section of the Ramayapatnam Baptist Theological Seminary into the Andhra Christian Theological College before it moved in 1973 to its present location in Secunderabad. Studies After general studies at the AELC-Andhra Christian College, Guntur leading to Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics under the Andhra University in 1934, Solomon took up work at the Buckingham and Carnatic Mills in Chennai but a decade later, discerned his avocation towards priesthood and much like the early Church Father, Saint Ambrose of Milan, Solomon relinquished civil work at Chennai and took to priesthood. =Graduate= By 1949,K.

He was one of the Noether boys, the doctoral students of Emmy Noether. Considered scientifically gifted but a modest mathematician, he was also an extreme Nazi, who would later take part in driving Jewish mathematicians out of the University of G√∂ttingen. He later started work as part of a group of five mathematicians, recruited by Wilhelm Fenner, and which included Ernst Witt, Georg Aumann, Alexander Aigner, Oswald Teichmueller and Johann Friedrich Schultze, and lead by Wolfgang Franz, to form the backbone of the new mathematical research department in the late 1930s, which would eventually be called: Section IVc of Cipher Department of the High Command of the Wehrmacht (abbr. OKW/Chi).TICOM reports DF-187 A-G and DF-176, ‚ÄòEuropean Axis Signal Intelligence in World War II‚Äô vol 2 Life Weber was born in 1906 in Oberstein (near Hamburg, Germany), the son of a merchant. In 1924, he graduated from the Abitur. He studied mathematics in Hamburg and at the University of G√∂ttingen and in 1928 he handed over the Lehramt staatsexamen (state examination) in Mathematics, Physics, Biology. Weber took his examination for promotion of Dr. phil. in G√∂ttingen with Emmy Noether, (who was described by Pavel Alexandrov, Albert Einstein, Jean Dieudonn√©, Hermann Weyl, and Norbert Wiener as the most important woman in the history of mathematics), with a dissertation titled: Ideal theoretical interpretation of the representability of any natural numbers by square forms, (German: Idealtheoretische Deutung der Darstellbarkeit beliebiger nat√ºrlicher Zahlen durch quadratische Formen)Math. Annalen 102 (1930) S. 740‚Äì767 Noether had not been authorized to supervise dissertations on her own. In G√∂ttingen, his postdoctoral scholarship was co-sponsored by Edmund Landau in 1931, with whom he had been an assistant since 1928 and whom he represented in 1933 after his leave of absence. Landau and Noether had judged his dissertation to be excellent, but Weber was only a mediocre mathematician, and his usefulness for Landau consisted chiefly of his abilities in accurate proofreading, to which Landau devoted much attention (according to an anecdote which was then prevalent, he was able to distinguish between an Italic point and a Roman point). In 1933, Oswald Teichm√ºller convinced Weber to convert to Nazism. According to Peter Scherk, Weber was brought to national socialism by Teichm√ºller He was involved in the publication of the Deutsche Mathematik and published a book on the Pell equation.Die Pellsche Gleichung (= Beihefte Deutsche Mathematik 1). Hirzel, Leipzig 1939. From 1946, Weber worked as a publishing director in Hamburg and from 1951 at the private school \\"Institut Dr. Brechtefeld\\" in Hamburg as a teacher. He left a detailed manuscript (written down before 1940) about his discussion with Hasse,Bundesarchiv Berlin R 4901/10.091 which serves as an important source for the events at that time in G√∂ttingen. Nazi Biography Weber was a member of the SA, but only became a Nazi on 1 May 1933 the Nazi party (No. 3,118,177), although he had previously sympathized with the Nazis. In November 1933, he signed the Vow of allegiance of the Professors of the German Universities and High-Schools to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialistic State. =Removal of Jewish mathematicians= Weber was involved in the removal of the mathematician Edmund Landau on 2 November 1933 from the mathematics faculty at the University of G√∂ttingen. Richard Courant was also forced out of G√∂ttingen in May 1933. As the leader of a group of pro-Nazi students Weber, along with the Nazi mathematician Oswald Teichm√ºller, along with the SS, organized a group that commanded a boycott of the Jewish Edmund Landau's lectures. In a letter that Richard Courant wrote to Abraham Flexner, he stated: :were some seventy students, partly in SS uniforms, but inside [the lecture theatre] not a soul. Every student who wanted to enter was prevented from entering by Weber. Landau received a delegate from the students, who informed him that Aryan students want Aryan mathematics...and requested him from giving [any more] lectures. The speaker for the students was very young, scientifically gifted man, but completely muddled and notorious. That person was Oswald Teichm√ºller. Landau would leave the university soon after. =Mathematical Institute= On February 13, 1934, the university Dekan (Deacon) asked Weber, who was acting director of the mathematical institute at G√∂ttingen, for recommendations on who should replace Hermann Weyl as new operational director. Several days later Weber recommended, as the best mathematician, the algebraist Helmut Hasse, then working at the University of Marburg, but preferred the Nazi Udo Wegner. In 1940, Weber would write: :On the morning of 25 April 1933, I sank into gloomy brooding over how to save German mathematics. According to Weber: The tradition of Felix Klein that had been destroyed by the Jews, could only be awakened to a new life by one man: Wegner The decision was made by the Nazi Theodor Vahlen, who appointed Helmut Hasse in April 1934. The Nazi were unsure if Hasse was fully committed to National Socialist policies, and tried to appoint someone to a second chair at G√∂ttingen who was a firm Nazi supporter. Udo Wegner was a strong candidate, but the probability theorist Erhard Tornier and ardent Nazi eventually gained the second chair. Later Weber and other convinced national socialists, met in G√∂ttingen with the designated new head of the G√∂ttingen mathematical institute Helmut Hasse, who also sympathized with the Nazis, to question him about his ancestry, where Weber and his cronies did not consider him reliable for (Nazi) party politics, due to him having a Jewish grandmother. Although Hasse was acceptable to the Nazis, he was not acceptable to Weber, who refused to hand over the keys to the Institute. Proceedings were started against Weber with Weber sending a 400+ page document to Dr Mentzel of the Reich Ministry for Science Education and Adult Education. War work interrupted the proceedings. In 1945, Weber was dismissed due to his Nazi involvement. War work In the World War II, he worked with Oswald Teichm√ºller in the Cipher Department of the High Command of the Wehrmacht in section IVc under Wolfgang Franz which was scientific decoding of enemy crypts, the development of code-breaking methods and working on re-cyphering systems not solved by practical decoding. The agency was managed by Erich H√ºttenhain. He successfully deciphered a cypher of the Japanese diplomatic service. He also worked on cryptanalytic theory.

An incident from her life served as the basis for the novel Die Geier-Wally by Wilhelmine von Hillern; an early example of feminist literature.  Biography  Alpine Landscape with Floral Wreath; one of her most popular paintings. Her father was a gunsmith who had a quick temper but who encouraged his daughter's talents and ambitions.Anna Stainer-Knittel, jstor, retrieved 1 April 2017 The sculptor, , was her uncle and the painter, Joseph Anton Koch, was her great- uncle. She began her studies in 1859 at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich, but she was not allowed to attend the main school because she was a woman. She had to return home in 1864 due to lack of funds. During this period, she painted numerous portraits of her family and landscape views. She later moved to Innsbruck and was able to support herself as a portrait painter. In 1867, against her parents' wishes, she married a ceramicist named Engelbert Stainer. During their time together, she created many floral designs for his cups, plates and saucers. From 1868 to 1871, they had three children; two sons and a daughter. In 1873, she opened a painting school for women, which she operated almost until her death. Among her students were Maria Tilipaul-Kistler (1884-1963) and Wilhelmine Redlich (1869-1954).  Fame as \\"Geier-Wally\\"  Self-portrait as the \\"Geier-Wally\\" At the age of seventeen, Anna volunteered to rappel down a rock wall to remove an eagle's nest. In the 19th century, this was a common practice to prevent eagles from attacking the local sheep herds. The previous year, a similar attempt almost ended in tragedy for the climbers, so no other volunteers could be found. She was able to grab the eaglet, stuff him in her rucksack, and ascend without incident although, later, it was said that she was attacked by an adult eagle during the climb. In 1863, this event was described by in his story, Das Annele im AdlerhorstLudwig Steub: Das Annele im Adlerhorst in: Kleinere Schriften, Vol.3, Cotta, Stuttgart 1874, pgs.116 f. (Digitalisat) Later, it was recounted in Wolfs Illustrirter Rundschau. Finally, in 1873, it was depicted in a novel by Wilhelmine von Hillern called Die Geier-Wally (\\"The Vulture Maiden\\" in English; eagles were often derisively referred to as \\"vultures\\"). The author had become acquainted with Anna and her husband in Innsbruck and decided to render her story in a dramatic, Shakespearean style; naming her heroine \\"Walburga\\" (Wally), dramatizing her conflicts with her father, and creating a sort of feminist tract. In 1892, the story was adapted for an opera: La Wally, by Alfredo Catalani. It has also been filmed numerous times, notably: * The Vulture Wally (1921), directed by E. A.
