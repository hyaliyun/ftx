He was a companion of the Sixth and Seventh Doctors. Overview Frobisher is a Whifferdill, one of a shape-changing extraterrestrial race. What is assumed to be his natural form, as seen in his first comic strip appearance, is humanoid, pale yellow in colour, three to four feet in height, with a round, featureless head, and wearing spectacles. However, he preferred to spend his free time in the form of a penguin. History When he first appeared in The Shape Shifter (DWM #88-#89), written by Steve Parkhouse with art by John Ridgway, Frobisher was a private investigator calling himself \\"Avan Tarklu\\" (a play on the phrase \\"Haven't a clue\\"). He came across the Doctor when an enemy of the Time Lord, Josiah Dogbolter, had placed a bounty on the Doctor in an effort to acquire his secrets and his TARDIS. After infiltrating the TARDIS, instead of turning the Doctor in for the money, Tarklu decided that he liked the Time Lord and helped him against Dogbolter; both split the advance bounty Tarklu had been given from Dogbolter. He then joined the Doctor on his journeys. He assumed the name of Frobisher because he felt that it sounded British and thought that the Doctor would like that. Frobisher was once married to Francine, another Whifferdill, who left him because she was a better detective than he was. Apparently, he was very fond of her in penguin form, and so adopted it to remind himself of her. It is not a static form, however, as Frobisher has been seen emulating different types of penguins. Frobisher travelled with the Doctor for quite a long time, occasionally parting company only for their paths to cross once again. When he first came on board the TARDIS, the Sixth Doctor was travelling alone, but in Kane's Story (DWM #104), the Sixth Doctor's television companion Peri Brown returned, apparently placing Frobisher's stories between the unmade Season 23 and The Trial of a Time Lord (indicated by Peri's changing hairstyles in the comic strip compared to her television appearances). Frobisher appears, travelling with the Doctor and Peri, in IDW's 50th Anniversary comic book miniseries Doctor Who: Prisoners of Time #6. This appearance was illustrated by John Ridgway. At the conclusion of this issue, it was revealed that Frobisher had been contacted by the Tenth Doctor while he was in the TARDIS on his own earlier, the Tenth Doctor asking Frobisher to pose as Peri so that he could be captured by the mysterious foe abducting past companions, the assumption that he was Peri causing their foes not to take greater care when securing Frobisher. When their adversaries - revealed to be the Ninth Doctor's ex-companion Adam Mitchell and the Master - attempted to kill the captured companions, Frobisher revealed that he had replaced the detonator Mitchell would have used, subsequently releasing his fellow companions from their imprisonment to help the Doctors fight off Adam and the Master's Auton army until they could convince Adam to help them against the Master. Frobisher was obviously not with the Doctor and Peri in Season 23's The Trial of a Time Lord, but no explanation was provided in the comic strip for his absence. Frobisher's last appearance prior to Trial was The World Shapers (DWM #127-#129). At the end of Trial, it was revealed that Peri had married King Yrcanos and settled on the planet Krontep. The graphic novel The Age of Chaos, written by Colin Baker (who played the Sixth Doctor) revealed that Frobisher and the Sixth Doctor visited Peri's descendants several times, so Frobisher must have rejoined the Doctor after Trial in an unseen story. After this story, Frobisher apparently departs again, since he is never again seen travelling with the Sixth Doctor. Frobisher was ultimately reunited with the Seventh Doctor, once again \\"off-screen\\", and eventually departed permanently in A Cold Day in Hell (DWM #130-#133). Subsequently, he was seen to have set up a bar called \\"Bish's\\" and remarried to a bird-like humanoid named Caralla. There, he encountered and gave much needed emotional support to the Eighth Doctor, but did not recognize who he was. Though \\"He almost seemed familiar\\". (Where Nobody Knows Your Name, DWM #329). Frobisher therefore had at least three distinct tenures with the Doctor, only one of which has a depicted ending. Canon Frobisher has occasionally appeared alongside the Sixth Doctor in spin-off media. These include a novel, Mission: Impractical by David A. McIntee and two Big Finish Productions audio plays, The Holy Terror and The Maltese Penguin, both written by Rob Shearman and featuring Robert Jezek as Frobisher. Maltese Penguin also featured Dogbolter (Toby Longworth) and Francine (Jane Goddard). These audio adventures take place between the stories The World Shapers and The Age of Chaos. In the novel The Scarlet Empress, Iris Wildthyme claimed that a shape-changer who assumed the shape of a penguin was once her companion. This could refer to Frobisher, Francine, or someone else entirely. However, like much of everything associated with Wildthyme, this claim may or may not have anything to do with actual events. Not to be confused with the human character of John Frobisher, played by Peter Capaldi in spin-off TV series Torchwood's third series.

It is popular in a wide region of Central Europe particularly in Alsace (sometimes known under a different name with small variations) including southern Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Croatia, Hungary, Bosnia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Czech Republic and Poland. It is closely related to the Christmas cake in Italy known as the pandoro and to the American bundt cake. In the cuisine of the Pennsylvania Dutch it's called Deitscher Kuche (German cake). In late Medieval Austria, a Gugelhupf was served at major community events such as weddings, and was decorated with flowers, leaves, candles, and seasonal fruits. The name persisted through the Austro-Hungarian Empire, eventually becoming standardized in Viennese cookbooks as a refined, rich cake, flavored with rosewater and almond. Many regional variations exist, testifying to the widespread popularity of the Gugelhupf tradition. Several narratives claim the origin of the cake in Roman times with a spurious claim relating even further back to the Three Wise Men. The cake was popularized as a prestige pastry by Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria and was popularized in France by Marie- Antoinette. The Gugelhupf was the sweet chosen to represent Austria in the Caf√© Europe initiative of the Austrian presidency of the European Union, on Europe Day 2006. Etymology The word's origin is disputed. The old, South German name combines the Middle High German words Gugel (see also gugel, a long-pointed hood) derived from Latin cucullus, meaning hood or bonnet, and Hupf, which literally means \\"to hop\\" or \\"to jump\\". The Brothers Grimm wrote that the hupf may be a reference to the \\"jumping\\" of the dough caused by the yeast, but no firm etymological evidence exists for this. The earliest known Gugelhupf recipe, in Marx Rupolt's 1581 cookbook, describes a \\"Hat Cake\\" with the distinctive shape and ornamentation recommendation, suggesting a similarity or intentional imitation of the shape of a medieval hat. It is spelled in Hungarian, (Cyrillic: ) in Serbo-Croatian and Macedonian, in Alsatian, in French and in Romanian. In Western Slovenia, it is also known as , and in Central and Eastern Slovenia, . In Upper Austria it is known as Wacker or Wacka. It is called in Czech and Slovak, and babka in Polish. In Slovenia, the standard word is . Pastry cocoa. Gugelhupf is made with a soft yeast dough, baked in a high, creased, toroidal pan. Depending on the region it can contain raisins, almonds or sometimes also Kirschwasser cherry brandy. Some regional varieties (Czech, Hungarian and Slovak) are filled with a layer of sweetened ground poppy seeds. Sometimes a regular pound cake or a marble cake made without yeast but baked in a Gugelhupf pan is also called Gugelhupf. Pans Gugelhupf pans The special circular pan with a central tube was originally made of enameled pottery. Similar pans are used for making Bundt cakes, a cake baking pan shape in the US derived from the Gugelhupf.

Located in Melbourne, it was established in 1854 as the Melbourne Public Library, making it Australia's oldest public library and one of the first free libraries in the world. It is also Australia's busiest library and, as of 2018, the fourth most-visited library in the world.Temple, Emily (10 May 2018). \\"The 12 Most Popular Libraries in the World\\", LitHub. Retrieved 28 May 2020. The library's vast collection includes over two million books and 350,000 photographs, manuscripts, maps and newspapers, with a special focus on material from Victoria, including the diaries of the city's founders, John Batman and John Pascoe Fawkner, the folios of Captain James Cook, and the armour of Ned Kelly. The library is located in the northern centre of the central business district, on the block bounded by Swanston, La Trobe, Russell, and Little Lonsdale streets. History A statue of Sir Redmond Barry, located within the library's forecourt In 1853, the decision to build a combined library, museum and gallery was made at the instigation of Lieutenant-Governor Charles La Trobe and Mr Justice Redmond Barry, Q.C. (Sir Redmond from 1860). A competition was held, won by the recently arrived architect Joseph Reed, whose firm and its successors went on to design most of the later extensions, as well as numerous 19th-century landmarks such as the Melbourne Town Hall, and the Royal Exhibition Building. Melbourne Public Library (later State Library Victoria), southern portion of Swanston Street frontage, ca. 1860, State Library Victoria pictures collection. Library forecourt, ca. 1864-1870 after the completion of Queen's Hall but before construction of the portico. Library forecourt, ca. 1875, with recently constructed portico and cast iron fencing. On the same day of 3 July 1854, the recently inaugurated Governor Sir Charles Hotham laid the foundation stone of both the new library complex and the University of Melbourne. The library‚Äôs the first stage (the central part of the Swanston Street wing) opened on 11 February 1856, with a collection of 3,800 books chosen by Mr Justice Barry, the President of Trustees. Augustus H. Tulk, the first librarian, was appointed three months after the opening. The Melbourne Public Library as it was then known was one of the first free public libraries in the world, open to anyone over 14 years of age, so long as they had clean hands. The complex of buildings that now house the Library were built in numerous stages, housing various library spaces, art galleries and museum displays, finally filling the entire block in 1992. In 1860 Joseph Reed designed a grand complex for the whole block including a domed section facing Russell Street to House the Museum and Gallery, painting a broad canvas that was more or less followed over the next century. The next stage was the south part of the front wing, opened in 1859, including the elaborate first floor Queen's Reading Room (now Queen's Hall). The northern part was added complete in 1864 by Abraham Linacre,https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/5681013/197090 but the classical portico was not built until 1870. Other wings were built are various times, such as Barry Hall, along Little Lonsdale Street, in 1886, McCoy Hall (named for Frederick McCoy, the first director of the National Museum of Victoria, and now the Redmond Barry reading boom), built for the Museum in 1892, Baldwin Spencer Hall facing Russell Street in 1909, and the McAllan Gallery on the LaTrobe Street side, built in 1932. A number of halls were built in 1866 for the Intercolonial Exhibition of Australasia just behind the front wing; meant to be temporary, they remained in use until 1909, when work began on the library's famed Domed Reading Room, began. Opened in 1913, it was designed by Bates, Peebles and Smart, the successor to Joseph Reed's firm, now known as Bates Smart. In 1959, the dome's skylights were covered in copper sheets due to water leakage, creating the dim atmosphere that characterised the Library for decades. The Library Museums and National Gallery Act 1869 formed a single body to run the Public Library of Victoria, National Gallery of Victoria, National Museum of Victoria (which moved to Library site in 1889), and the Industrial and Technological Museum of Victoria. The Public Library, National Gallery and Museums Act 1944 separated these into four separate institutions sharing the one site. Aerial view from above Swanston Street The National Gallery of Victoria eventually moved to a new purpose built home in St Kilda Road in 1968 (during renovations of these buildings the gallery returned to its original home briefly from 1999-2002, occupying the Russell Street halls). In 1971 the Lending Library closed. Melbourne's CBD was to be without a public lending library until the opening of the City Library in 2004. The Public Record Office Victoria was once the Archives Department of the Library. In 1973 the Public Records Act established the Public Record Office Victoria as the state's archive authority, independent of the Library. The Office moved to Laverton in 1977, then to purpose built home in North Melbourne in 2004. The PROV now frequently supplies exhibits for the Old Treasury Building museum. The National Museum and Industrial and Technological Museum merged in 1983 to form the Museum of Victoria. Parts of this combined museum were moved to other sites during the 1990s, with the bulk of the galleries remaining until 1997. At that time the remaining museum closed temporarily before moving to the Carlton Gardens in 2000 as the Melbourne Museum. The library underwent major refurbishments between 1990 and 2004, designed by architects Ancher Mortlock & Woolley. The project cost approximately A$200 million. The reading room closed in 1999 to allow for renovation, when the skylights were reinstated. The renamed La Trobe Reading Room reopened in 2003. The redevelopment included the creation of a number of exhibition spaces, some of which are used to house permanent exhibitions The Mirror of the World: Books and Ideas and The Changing Face of Victoria as well as a display from the Pictures Collection in the Cowen Gallery. As a result of the redevelopment, State Library Victoria can now be considered one of the largest exhibiting libraries in the world. In February 2010, the southern wing of the library on Little Lonsdale Street was reopened as the Wheeler Centre, part of Melbourne's city of literature initiative. In 2015 the Library embarked on a five-year, million redevelopment project, Vision 2020,Vision 2020 to transform its public spaces, programs and facilities to better meet the changing needs of the community. On 29 April 2015 the Minister for Creative Industries Martin Foley announced that the 2015-16 State Budget would provide million towards the redevelopment of State Library Victoria, including the restoration of the Queen's Hall, the creation of a rooftop garden terrace, a dedicated children's and youth space, and the opening up 40 percent more of the building to the public. In late 2017, the library's contribution of million from donations was eventually raised. In September 2018, the main Swanston Street entrance was temporarily closed and replaced by the newly refurbished Russell Street and La Trobe Street entrances. In December 2019 the Library officially completed its Vision 2020 redevelopment project, increasing public spaces by 40%, refurbishing existing reading rooms and providing additional services for children and families.  Forecourt  A view of the library from the left side facing Swanston Street The grassy lawn in front of the library's grand entrance on Swanston Street is a popular lunch-spot for the city's workers and students at the adjacent RMIT University. Originally enclosed by a picket fence, then by a wrought iron fence and gates in the 1870s, the space was opened up with the removal of the fence and the creation of diagonal paths in 1939. The forecourt includes a number of statues. A pair of bronze lions flanked the entry from the 1860s until they were removed in 1937 due to deterioration. A memorial statue of Mr Justice Sir Redmond Barry, Q.C., by James Gilbert and built by Percival Ball was installed on the central landing of the main stairs in 1887. Flanking the entrance plaza are Saint George and the Dragon, by the English sculptor Sir Joseph Edgar Boehm, installed in 1889 and Jeanne d'Arc (Joan of Arc), a replica of the statue by French sculptor Emmanuel Fr√©miet, installed in 1907. WW1 commemorative statues ‚ÄòWipers‚Äô and ‚ÄòThe Driver‚Äô were at the centre points of the 1939 diagonal paths, but were relocated to the ground of the Shrine of Remembrance in 1998. A statue of Charles La Trobe, by Australian sculptor Peter Corlett, was installed in 2006 in the north east corner of the lawn. On Sundays between 2:30 pm and 5:30 pm, a speakers' forum takes place on the library forecourt, where orators take turns in speaking on various subjects, and it is popular location for protest meetings and a rallying point for marches. Reading Rooms =The Dome= The La Trobe Reading Room The landmark Domed Reading Room was opened in 1913, and was designed by Norman G. Peebles of Bates Smart. Its octagonal space was designed to hold over a million books and up to 600 readers. It is 34.75 m in both diameter and height, and its oculus is nearly 5 m wide. The dome was the largest in the world on completion.It was superseded within months by the far larger, 69m diameter, Centennial Hall in what was then Breslau, Germany, now Wroclaw, Poland In 2003, it was officially renamed the LaTrobe Reading Room, and now houses the Library's Australiana collection, previously in the 1965 La Trobe Building annex. Levels 4 and 5 of the Dome galleries house the free permanent exhibitions \\"World of the book\\" and \\"The changing face of Victoria\\", while level 6 provides visitors with a view of the reading room below. =The Ian Potter Queen's Hall= The central portion of Ian Potter Queen's Hall opened in 1856 as the Library's original reading room. It closed to the public in 2003 due to disrepair, before being renovated and reopened in 2019 as a mixed-use study space containing Victorian young adult literature. After hours, the Ian Potter Queen's Hall functions as a special events venue. =Chess Collection= The library houses a wide range of materials dedicated to the history, study and practice of chess. It contains a collection of items from the Anderson Chess Collection, one of the three largest public chess collections in the world. In addition to bookshelves containing an extensive range of books and periodicals relating to chess, the room has game tables with chessboards and pieces, and a few glass cabinets containing historical chess paraphernalia. The Chess Room was closed in February 2017 with collections temporarily moved to the LaTrobe Reading Room. In 2019, the chess collection and game sets were relocated to the renovated Ian Potter Queen's Hall. The Redmond Barry Reading Room =Redmond Barry Reading Room= The National Museum's McCoy Hall ca. 1910, later converted to the Redmond Barry Reading Room. Located at the eastern end of the library, Redmond Barry Reading Room was until 1997 known as McCoy Hall, and was home to the National Museum (now Melbourne Museum). It is now home to the library's contemporary collection of books, magazines and periodicals with the mezzanine housing folio-size books and providing additional independent study desks. =Heritage Collections Reading Room= This closed-access reading room provides a space to view heritage collection materials. There are 14 historical pendant lamps hanging off the ceiling and a detailed ceramic embossed wall and ceiling.

The Arts Reading Room is located beside the Newspaper and Family History Reading Room at the eastern end of the building, and contains workspaces for quiet study and AV equipment for providing access to the library's vast array of AV resources. =Newspaper and Family History Reading Room= Relocated beside the Redmond Barry Reading room in 2018, this room contains a comprehensive collection of Victorian newspaper titles on microfilm, as well as some interstate titles. Modern microfilm reader/scanners enable patrons to save images of newspapers to USB memory stick. Physical copies of current Victorian newspapers are available for use, with three months worth stored onsite. Services related to family history include a vast collection of microfilm and microfiche, printed references, databases, and biographies. Research tools for newspaper and family history research include computers, printers and scanners, with a specialist librarian available for reference inquiries. Collections The library holds a significant amount of material related to bushranger and outlaw Ned Kelly, most notably the armour he wore during his final shootout with the police. =The La Trobe Journal= Founded by the Friends of State Library Victoria in 1968 to promote interest in the Library's Australiana collection, in 1998, the State Library Victoria Foundation became the sponsor of the journal, enabling the publication to expand considerably. it is published twice a year in Autumn and Spring. =Databases= Many of the library's electronic databases are available from home to any Victorian registered as a State Library User. Databases include the full Encyclop√¶dia Britannica; Oxford Reference dictionaries and encyclopaedias; multi-subject magazine and journal article databases; newspaper archives of most major Australian and international papers from 2000 onwards; and specialist subject databases. =Photographs= The library's collection includes 2,000 rolls of film containing photographs of Melbourne and country Victoria from the early 1970s. These 70,000 photographs are in the process of being digitized and made available to the public.  Services  State Library Victoria provides education programmes for community and schools, conferences such as Reading Matters and library research fellowships. The library is home to the Centre for Youth Literature and the Inside a dog young adult fiction community. From 1994-2014 it managed the Vicnet community internet service. National edeposit (NED) As a member library of National and State Libraries Australia (NSLA), the organisation collaborated on the creation of the National edeposit (NED) system, which enables publishers from all over Australia to upload electronic publications as per the 2016 amendment to the Copyright Act 1968 and other regional legislation relating to legal deposit, and makes these publications publicly accessible online (depending on access conditions) from anywhere via Trove. As CEO of State Library Victoria and Chair of NSLA, Kate Torney played an important role on the steering committee, which met 100 times during the two- year build phase of the project. In popular culture The exterior of the library is prominently featured at the conclusion of the post-World War III movie On the Beach. Rock band Faker shot the music video for their 2005 single \\"Hurricane\\" in the LaTrobe Reading Room.

Most Mithraea can be dated between 100 B.C. and A.D. 300, mostly in the Roman Empire. The Mithraeum was either an adapted natural cave or cavern, or a building imitating a cave. When possible, the Mithraeum was constructed within or below an existing building, such as the Mithraeum found beneath Basilica of San Clemente in Rome. While a majority of Mithraea are underground, some feature open holes in the ceiling to allow some light in, perhaps to relate to the connection of the universe and the passing of time. The site of a Mithraeum may also be identified by its singular entrance or vestibule, which stands opposite from an apse-shaped wall in which a pedestal altar at the back stood, often in a recess, and its \\"cave\\", called the Spelaeum or Spelunca, with raised benches along the side walls for the ritual meal. Many mithraea that follow this basic plan are scattered over much of the Roman Empire's former territory, particularly where the legions were stationed along the frontiers (such as Britain). Others may be recognized by their characteristic layout, even though converted as crypts beneath Christian churches. From the structure of the Mithraea it is possible to surmise that worshippers would have gathered for a common meal along the reclining couches lining the walls. The Mithraeum primarily functioned as an area for initiation, in which the soul descends and exits. The Mithraeum itself was arranged as an \\"image of the universe\\". It is noticed by some researchers that this movement, especially in the context of mithraic iconography (see below), seems to stem from the neoplatonic concept that the \\"running\\" of the sun from solstice to solstice is a parallel for the movement of the soul through the universe, from pre-existence, into the body, and then beyond the physical body into an afterlife.

The film takes a critical look at the presidency of George W. Bush, the war in Iraq, and its coverage in the media. In the film, Moore contends that American corporate media were \\"cheerleaders\\" for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and did not provide an accurate or objective analysis of the rationale for the war and the resulting casualties there. The film generated intense controversy, including disputes over its accuracy. The title of the film alludes to Ray Bradbury's 1953 novel Fahrenheit 451, a dystopian view of the future United States, drawing an analogy between the autoignition temperature of paper and the date of the September 11 attacks; one of the film's taglines was \\"The Temperature at Which Freedom Burns\\". The film debuted at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. The film was also awarded the Palme d'Or, the festival's highest award. The film is the highest grossing documentary of all time. Synopsis The movie begins by suggesting that friends and political allies of George W. Bush at Fox News Channel tilted the election of 2000 by prematurely declaring Bush the winner. It then suggests that the handling of the voting controversy in Florida constituted election fraud. The film then segues into the September 11 attacks. Moore says Bush was informed of the first plane hitting the World Trade Center on his way to an elementary school. Bush is then shown sitting in a Florida classroom with children. When told that a second plane has hit the World Trade Center and that the nation is \\"under attack\\", Bush allows the students to finish their book reading, and Moore notes that he continued reading for nearly seven minutes. Moore then discusses the complex relationships between the U.S. government and the Bush family; and between the bin Laden family, the Saudi Arabian government, and the Taliban, which span over three decades. Moore then states that the United States government evacuated 24 members of the bin Laden family on a secret flight shortly after the attacks, without subjecting them to any form of interrogation. Moore moves on to examine George W. Bush's Air National Guard service record. Moore contends that Bush's dry-hole oil well attempts were partially funded by the Saudis and by the bin Laden family through the intermediary of James R. Bath, whose name is shown to have been blacked out from Bush's records. Moore alleges that these conflicts of interest suggest that the Bush administration does not serve the interests of Americans. The movie continues by suggesting ulterior motives for the War in Afghanistan, including a natural gas pipeline through Afghanistan to the Indian Ocean. Moore alleges that the Bush administration induced a climate of fear among the American population through the mass media. Moore then describes purported anti-terror efforts, including government infiltration of pacifist groups and other events, and the signing of the USA PATRIOT Act. The documentary then turns to the subject of the Iraq War, comparing the lives of the Iraqis before and after the invasion. The citizens of Iraq are portrayed as living relatively happy lives prior to the country's invasion by the U.S. military. The film also takes pains to demonstrate supposed war cheerleading in the U.S. media and general bias of journalists, with quotes from news organizations and embedded journalists. Moore suggests that atrocities will occur in Iraq and shows footage depicting U.S. abuse of prisoners. Later in the film, Lila Lipscomb appears with her family after hearing of the death of her son, Sgt. Michael Pedersen, who was killed on April 2, 2003, in Karbala. Anguished and tearful, she begins to question the purpose of the war. Tying together several themes and points, Moore compliments those serving in the U.S. military. He claims that the lower class of America are always the first to join the Army, so that the people better off do not have to join. He states that those valuable troops should not be sent to risk their lives unless it is necessary to defend America. The credits roll while Neil Young's \\"Rockin' in the Free World\\" plays. (Moore had originally intended to use the Who's \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" but was denied permission by Pete Townshend). Moore dedicated the film to his friend who was killed in the World Trade Center attacks and to those servicemen and women from Flint, Michigan that have been killed in Iraq: \\"Michael Pedersen, Brett Petriken and all the soldiers from the Flint area who have died in the Iraq War ... Bill Weems and the 2973 who died on 9/11/01 ... and the countless thousands who have died in Afghanistan and Iraq as a result of our actions.\\" Production Originally planned to be financed by Mel Gibson's Icon Productions (which planned to give Michael Moore eight figures in upfront cash and potential backend), Fahrenheit 9/11 was later picked up by Miramax Films and Wild Bunch in May 2003 after Icon Productions had abruptly dropped the financing deal it made. Miramax had earlier distributed another film for Moore, The Big One, in 1997. At that time, Disney was the parent company of Miramax. According to the book DisneyWar, Disney executives did not know that Miramax agreed to finance the film until they saw a posting on the Drudge Report. Michael Eisner (the CEO of Disney at that time) called Harvey Weinstein (co-chairman of Miramax at that time) and ordered him to drop the film. In addition, Disney sent two letters to Weinstein demanding Miramax drop the film. Weinstein felt Disney had no right to block the releasing of Fahrenheit 9/11 since the film's $6 million budget was well below the level at which Miramax needed to seek Disney's approval, and it would not be rated NC-17.Stewart, p.429-430 But Weinstein was in contract negotiations with Disney, so he offered a compromise that he would drop the film if Disney did not like it. Disney responded by having Peter Murphy send Weinstein a letter stating that the film's $6 million budget was only a bridge financing and Miramax would sell off its interest in the movie to get those $6 million back; according to the same letter, Miramax was also expected to publicly state that it would not release the film. After Fahrenheit 9/11 was nearly finished, Miramax held several preview screenings; they were \\"testing through the roof\\".Stewart, p.519-520 Weinstein informed Eisner that Fahrenheit 9/11 was finished, and Eisner was surprised by the fact that Miramax had continued making the film. Weinstein asked several Disney executives (including Eisner) to watch the film, but all declined; Disney stated again that Miramax would not release the film, and Disney also accused Weinstein of hiding Fahrenheit 9/11 by keeping it off production reports. Disney sent production vice President Brad Epstein to watch Fahrenheit 9/11 on April 24, 2004. According to Weinstein, Epstein said he liked the film; but according to the report Epstein sent to the Walt Disney Company board of directors, Epstein clearly criticized it. Eisner told Weinstein that Disney's board decided not to allow Miramax to release the film. Weinstein was furious and he asked George J. Mitchell (chairman of Disney at that time) to see the film, but Mitchell declined. Weinstein asked lawyer David Boies to help find a solution; the Weinsteins and Moore had also hired Chris Lehane to consult on the film's release strategies. The New York Times reported about Disney's decision on May 5, 2004. Disney stated that both Moore's agent (Ari Emanuel) and Miramax were advised in May 2003 that Miramax would not be permitted to distribute the film. Disney representatives said Disney had the right to veto any Miramax film if it appeared that its distribution would be counterproductive to the interests of the company; indeed, Disney had blocked Miramax from releasing two films before: Kids and Dogma. Because of these difficulties, distribution was first secured in numerous countries outside the U.S. On May 28, 2004, after more than a week of talks, Disney announced that Miramax film studio founders Harvey and Bob Weinstein had personally acquired the rights to the documentary after Disney declined to distribute it. The Weinsteins agreed to repay Disney for all costs to that point, estimated at around $6 million. They also agreed to be responsible for all costs to finish the film and all marketing costs not paid by any third-party film distributors. A settlement between the Weinsteins and Disney was also reached so that 60% of the film's profit would be donated to charity. The Weinsteins established Fellowship Adventure Group to handle the distribution of this film. Fellowship Adventure Group joined forces with Lions Gate Entertainment (which had released two other Miramax-financed films O and Dogma) and IFC Films to release it in the United States theatrically. (Fellowship Adventure Group also handled the film's U.S. home video distribution through Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment). Moore stated that he was \\"grateful to them now that everyone who wants to see it will now have the chance to do so. After being informed that the film had been given an R rating by the Motion Picture Association of America, Moore appealed the decision, hoping to obtain a PG-13 rating instead. Moore's lawyer, former Governor of New York, Mario Cuomo, was not allowed to attend the hearing. The appeal was denied on June 22, 2004, and Cuomo contended that it was because he had been banned from the hearing. Some theaters chose to defy the MPAA and allow unchaperoned teenagers to attend screenings.'Fahrenheit' Raters Leave Cuomo Out in the Cold ; Washington Post; Richard Leiby; June 23, 2004 Release Alternate Fahrenheit 9/11 poster The film was released theatrically by The Fellowship Adventure Group through a distribution arrangement with Lions Gate Entertainment. On its opening weekend of June 25‚Äì27, 2004, the film generated box-office revenues of $23.9 million in the U.S. and Canada, making it the weekend's top-grossing film. Its opening weekend earned more than the entire U.S. theatrical run of any other feature- length documentary (including Moore's previous film, Bowling for Columbine). The film was released in the UK on July 2, 2004 and in France on July 7, 2004. Moore credited part of the theatrical success to the efforts of conservative groups to pressure theaters not to run the film, conjecturing that these efforts backfired by creating publicity. There were also efforts by liberal groups such as MoveOn.org (who helped promote the film) to encourage attendance in order to defy their political opponents' contrary efforts. Fahrenheit 9/11 was screened in a number of Middle Eastern countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Lebanon, and Egypt, but was immediately banned in Kuwait. \\"We have a law that prohibits insulting friendly nations\\", said Abdul-Aziz Bou Dastour of the Kuwaiti Information Ministry. The film was not shown in Saudi Arabia as public movie theaters were not permitted from 1983 until 2017. The Saudi ruling elite subsequently launched an advertising campaign spanning nineteen US cities to counter criticism partly raised in the film. In Cuba, bootlegged versions of the film were shown in 120 theaters, followed by a prime-time television broadcast by the leading state-run network. It had been widely reported that this might affect its Oscar eligibility, since the film was broadcast on television less than nine months after its theatrical release. However, soon after that story had been published, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences issued a statement denying this, saying, \\"If it was pirated or stolen or unauthorized we would not blame the producer or distributor for that\\". In addition, Wild Bunch, the film's overseas distributor for Cuba, issued a statement denying a television deal had been struck with Cuban Television. The issue became moot, however, when Moore decided to forgo Oscar eligibility in favor of a pay-per-view televising of the film on November 1, 2004. =Critical reception= The film was received positively by critics. Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 82% based on 237 reviews, with an average rating of 7.33/10. The site's critics' consensus reads: \\"Extremely one-sided in its indictment of the Bush administration, but worth watching for the humor and the debates it'll stir.\\" It also received a score of 67 (generally favorable) on Metacritic, based on 43 reviews. Film critic Roger Ebert, who gave the documentary three and a half stars out of four, says that the film \\"is less an expos√© of George W. Bush than a dramatization of what Moore sees as a failed and dangerous presidency\\". In the film, Moore presents footage of Vice President Al Gore presiding over the event that would officially anoint Bush as president, the day that a joint session of the House of Representatives and the Senate would certify the election results. \\"Moore brings a fresh impact to familiar material by the way he marshals his images,\\" says Ebert. Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, \\"best-of\\" list, saying, \\"Michael Moore's anti-Bush polemic gave millions of frustrated liberals exactly what they needed to hear in 2004‚Äîand infuriated just about everyone else. Along the way, it became the highest-grossing documentary of all time.\\" =Commercial performance= Grossing over $222 million total worldwide, the film is the highest grossing documentary of all time, according to Box Office Mojo. The film had a general release in the United States and Canada on June 23, 2004. It has since been released in 42 more countries. On Al-Jazeera in August 2012, Moore claimed the movie \\"grossed about half a billion dollars\\" worldwide. =Home media= Fahrenheit 9/11 was released to DVD and VHS on October 5, 2004, an unusually short turnaround time after theatrical release. In the first days of the release, the film broke records for the highest- selling documentary ever. About two million copies were sold on the first day, most of which (1.4 million) were sold as rentals. A companion book, The Official Fahrenheit 9/11 Reader, was released at the same time. It contains the complete screenplay, documentation of Moore's sources, audience e-mails about the film, film reviews, and articles. =Initial television presentations= The two-hour film was planned to be shown as part of the three-hour \\"The Michael Moore Pre-Election Special\\" on iN DEMAND, but iN DEMAND backed out in mid-October. Moore later arranged for simultaneous broadcasts on November 1, 2004 at 8:00 p.m. (EST) on Dish Network, TVN, and the Cinema Now website and material prepared for \\"The Michael Moore Pre- Election Special\\" was incorporated into \\"Fahrenheit 9/11: A Movement in Time\\", which aired that same week on The Independent Film Channel. The movie was also shown on basic cable television in Germany and Austria on November 1, 2004 and November 2, 2004. In the UK, the film was shown on Channel 4 on January 27, 2005. In Hungary, it was shown on RTL Klub, a commercial channel, on September 10, 2005, on m1, one of the national channels, on August 13, 2006, on m2, the other national channel, on September 1, 2006. In Denmark, it was shown on Danmarks Radio (normally referred to as just DR), which is Denmark's national broadcasting corporation, on April 11, 2006. In Norway, it was shown on NRK, the national broadcasting corporation, on August 27, 2006. The film was screened in New Zealand on September 9, 2006 on TV ONE, a channel of TVNZ. The next day, the Dutch network Nederland 3 aired the film. In Belgium, it was shown on Kanaal 2 on October 12, 2006. In Brazil, it aired on October 10, 2008 on TV Cultura, the S√£o Paulo public broadcasting network. Soundtrack The soundtrack to Fahrenheit 9/11 was released on October 5, 2004 by Rhino Entertainment. =Track listing= Awards =Palme d'Or= Michael Moore receiving the Palme d'Or at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. In April 2004, the film was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or at the 57th Cannes Film Festival. After its first showing in Cannes in May 2004, the film received a 15‚Äì20 minute standing ovation; Harvey Weinstein, whose Miramax Films funded the film, said, \\"It was the longest standing ovation I've seen in over 25 years\\".'Fahrenheit' lights fire in Cannes debut, The Hollywood Reporter. May 18, 2004. Anti-Bush film tops Cannes awards, BBC News Online. May 24, 2004. On May 22, 2004, the film was awarded the Palme d'Or. It was the first documentary to win that award since Jacques Cousteau's and Louis Malle's The Silent World in 1956. Just as his much publicized Oscar acceptance speech, Moore's speech in Cannes included some political statements: > I have a sneaking suspicion that what you have done here and the response > from everyone at the festival, you will assure that the American people will > see this film. I can't thank you enough for that. You've put a huge light on > this and many people want the truth and many want to put it in the closet, > just walk away. There was a great Republican president who once said, if you > just give the people the truth, the Republicans, the Americans will be > saved. [‚Ä¶] I dedicate this Palme d'Or to my daughter, to the children of > Americans and to Iraq and to all those in the world who suffer from our > actions. Some conservatives in the United States, such as Jon Alvarez of FireHollywood, commented that such an award could be expected from the French. Moore had remarked only days earlier that: \\"I fully expect the Fox News Channel and other right-wing media to portray this as an award from the French. [‚Ä¶] There was only one French citizen on the jury. Four out of nine were American. [‚Ä¶] This is not a French award, it was given by an international jury dominated by Americans.\\" The jury was made up of four North Americans (one of them born in Haiti), four Europeans, and one Asian. He also responded to suggestions that the award was political: \\"Quentin [Tarantino] whispered in my ear, 'We want you to know that it was not the politics of your film that won you this award. We are not here to give a political award. Some of us have no politics. We awarded the art of cinema, that is what won you this award and we wanted you to know that as a fellow filmmaker.'\\" In comments to the prize-winning jury in 2005, Cannes director Gilles Jacob said that panels should make their decision based on filmmaking rather than politics. He expressed his opinion that though Moore's talent was not in doubt, \\"it was a question of a satirical tract that was awarded a prize more for political than cinematographic reasons, no matter what the jury said\\". Interviewed about the decision four years later, Tarantino responded: \\"As time has gone on, I have put that decision under a microscope and I still think we were right. That was a movie of the moment ‚Äì Fahrenheit 9/11 may not play the same way now as it did then, but back then it deserved everything it got.\\"Hirschberg, Lynn.

Last Visited Friday, Nov. 28, 2014. =Golden Raspberry Awards= Nine months after Fahrenheit 9/11 received the Palme d'Or, George W. Bush, Donald Rumsfeld, and Condoleezza Rice won the Worst Actor, Worst Supporting Actor, and Worst Screen Couple (Bush/Rice) in the 25th Golden Raspberry Awards (\\"Razzies\\") because of their mishandling of the 9/11 attacks and the Iraq War. Britney Spears, who appeared in the film in a pre-recorded interview where she expressed her support for Bush, won the Golden Raspberry for Worst Supporting Actress. Controversies The film generated criticism and controversy after its release shortly before the 2004 United States presidential election. British-American journalist and literary critic Christopher Hitchens contended that Fahrenheit 9/11 contains distortions and untruths. This drew several rebuttals, including an eFilmCritic article and a Columbus Free Press editorial. Former Democratic mayor of New York City Ed Koch, who had endorsed President Bush for re- election, called the film propaganda. In response, Moore published a list of facts and sources for Fahrenheit 9/11 and a document that he says establishes agreements between the points made in his film and the findings of the 9/11 Commission. Moore's expectations for the 2004 presidential election The film was released in June 2004, less than five months before the 2004 presidential election. Michael Moore, while not endorsing presidential candidate John Kerry, stated in interviews that he hoped \\"to see Mr. Bush removed from the White House\\". He also said that he hoped his film would influence the election: \\"This may be the first time a film has this kind of impact\\". However, some political analysts did not expect it to have a significant effect on the election. One Republican strategist stated that Moore \\"communicates to that far-left sliver that would never vote for Bush\\", and Jack Pitney, a government professor at Claremont McKenna College, suspected that the main effect of the film would be to \\"turn Bush-haters into bigger Bush-haters\\". Regardless of whether the film would change the minds of many voters, Moore stated his intention to use it as an organizing tool, and hoped that it would energize those who wanted to see Bush defeated in 2004, increasing voter turnout. Notwithstanding the film's influence and commercial success, George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004. Because Moore had opted to have it played on television prior to the 2004 election, the film was ruled ineligible to compete for the Best Documentary Feature in the Academy Awards. Lawsuit In February 2011, Moore sued producers Bob and Harvey Weinstein for US$2.7 million in unpaid profits from the film, stating that they used \\"Hollywood accounting tricks\\" to avoid paying him the money. They responded that Moore had received US$20 million for the film and that \\"his claims are hogwash\\". Eventually, Bob and Harvey Weinstein reached a settlement with Moore for undisclosed amounts and terms. Subsequent film On September 6, 2018, Moore released a film entitled Fahrenheit 11/9 about the 2016 United States presidential election and the subsequent presidency of Donald Trump. The title is reference to the original film, with the date 9/11 being reversed to 11/9. References Further reading * On the financing of the film.

From 1994 until 2015 he was one of the main presenters of Radio 4's Today programme. In July 2015 he announced, via the BBC, that in early 2016 he would retire from regular presenting duties on the programme and would, instead, be its 'Special Correspondent' with 'responsibility for charting the course of the constitutional changes at the heart of the UK political debate', as well as the BBC News's Books Editor, contributing a book review to the Saturday morning editions of Today.

In his 21-plus years on Today, Naughtie had anchored every BBC Radio UK election results programme since 1997 and had worked on every US presidential election since 1988, the BBC added. \\"After 21 years, I can turn off that 3am alarm at last,\\" the Daily Telegraph quoted Naughtie as saying.Jim Naughtie to leave BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Anita Singh, Daily Telegraph, London, 7 July 2015. Retrieved: 9 July 2015. He presented his last edition of Today on 16 December 2015. Early life and career James Naughtie was born to Alexander and Isabella Naughtie and brought up in Milltown of Rothiemay, near Huntly, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. He was educated at Keith Grammar School, the University of Aberdeen and then Syracuse University in New York. He is a Fellow of the British-American Project. Naughtie began his career as a journalist in 1975 at the Aberdeen Press & Journal, moving to the London offices of The Scotsman in 1977. The following year he joined the paper's Westminster staff, and became its Chief Political Correspondent. In 1981, he worked for The Washington Post as the Laurence Stern fellow on its national staff. He joined The Guardian in 1984, and became its Chief Political Correspondent in 1985. Radio presenter In 1986, Naughtie moved into radio presenting, hosting The Week In Westminster before moving to The World At One in 1988. He has also made several radio documentaries and series and has written three books, Playing the Palace: A Westminster Collection, The Rivals: The Intimate Story of a Political Marriage, and The Accidental American: Tony Blair and the Presidency. Naughtie has been a presenter of the televised Proms since 1992, and has also presented opera programmes such as Radio 3's Opera News. He is also the host of Radio 4's Bookclub. In 1994 he became one of the main presenters of Radio 4's Today programme. Shortly before the 2005 General Election he opened a question to Labour politician Ed Balls \\"If we win the election...\\", quickly correcting himself to say \\"if you win the election\\". The incident led to accusations of bias towards the Labour Party and a failure to be neutral. Lord Tebbit said of the incident: \\"How often a slip of the tongue betrays the true thoughts in the mind of the speaker. We could all see the shape of the cat in the bag, but Mr Naughtie has now let it out for all to see.\\" He has a distinctive Scottish accent which has been named as the \\"best voice to wake up to\\" in a comparative survey. His practice of asking particularly long questions is sometimes noted by commentators. Throughout June, July and August 2012, and in early September 2012, he presented The New Elizabethans on Radio Four, a programme about notable people under the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II. It has dealt with various famous names, including Richard Doll, Philip Larkin, Elizabeth David, Margot Fonteyn, Peter Hall, Cicely Saunders, John Lennon and Paul McCartney and Tim Berners-Lee. The final week of the programme dealt with Tony Blair, Fred Goodwin, Rupert Murdoch, Simon Cowell and finished with the Queen herself. On 16 July 2013, it was announced that Naughtie's presentational role on Today would be temporarily reduced, as he was to become a presenter of Good Morning Scotland for two days a week in the run up the Scottish independence referendum in 2014.Victoria Ward \\"Today programme appoints Mishal Husain to replace James Naughtie\\", telegraph.co.uk, 16 July 2013 He returned to his usual role on Today in time for the 2015 general election.Jason Deans and Josh Halliday \\"BBC's Mishal Husain to join Today\\", guardian.co.uk, 16 July 2013 In 2016‚Äì17, Naughtie earned ¬£150,000 ‚Äì ¬£199,999 as a BBC contributor.

Introducing Jeremy Hunt, the Culture Secretary, he inadvertently replaced the \\"H\\" at the beginning of \\"Hunt\\" with a \\"C\\". Choking on his words, he was clearly embarrassed by the mistake, and gave a full apology once he had recovered. However, only an hour later, another BBC presenter, Andrew Marr made the same mistake when discussing Naughtie's error. Awards and positions Naughtie was named as journalist of the year at the 1984 Scottish Press Awards. He was voted Sony Radio Awards Radio Personality of the Year in 1991 and Voice of the Listener & Viewer Award in 2001.

It forms a connection between the canalised river Sambre (Meuse basin) at Landrecies and the Oise (Seine basin) at La F√®re. The canal is long, and has 38 locks. The junction made at La F√®re is with a branch of the Canal de Saint-Quentin, while the Canal lat√©ral √† l'Oise is joined 10.5 km further downstream at Chauny. It was used by the standard Freycinet-gauge p√©niches, long, and in beam, carrying up to 250 tonnes. The canal, also a popular waterway for boats heading south from the Netherlands and Belgium to the central French waterways, had to be closed in 2006 when two aqueducts were found to be in danger of failing. Funding has been put in place by the owner, Voies Navigables de France, and the local authorities, with support from the State, and it is expected to reopen the canal throughout in 2020.  World War I battle  The Sambre‚ÄìOise Canal saw one of the last Allied victories of World War I before the Armistice with Germany which came into effect at 11.00 am on 11 November 1918. The forcing of the Sambre‚ÄìOise Canal took place on 4 November 1918. Participating in the operation were the 2nd Battalion Royal Sussex, as well as the 2nd Manchesters, to which the poet Wilfred Owen belonged. The Lancashire Fusiliers also took part in the battle. The British forces were to cross some fields surrounded by high hedges, then cross the canal at a point where there was a lockhouse. The Germans had this area defended with machine guns and rifle teams. As the 2nd Battalion advanced on the canal, the Royal Engineers placed small footbridges across the lock. Some Royal Sussex Regiment men actually climbed up onto the lock gates, one of them firing his Lewis gun from the hip as he went. Eventually the British managed to take the lockhouse and pushed on to their final objective near the √âtreux road. Wilfred Owen, officer and poet, was killed as he crossed the Sambre‚ÄìOise Canal at the head of a raiding party: Owen's death occurred only a week before the war ended.

Performing in front of an unknown audience can cause significantly more anxiety than performing in front of familiar faces. In some cases, the person will suffer no such fright from this, while they might suffer from not knowing who they're performing to. In the context of public speaking, this may precede or accompany participation in any activity involving public self-presentation. In some cases stage fright may be a part of a larger pattern of social phobia (social anxiety disorder), but many people experience stage fright without any wider problems. Quite often, stage fright arises in a mere anticipation of a performance, often a long time ahead. It has numerous manifestations: stuttering, tachycardia, tremor in the hands and legs, sweaty hands, facial nerve tics, dry mouth, and dizziness. People and situations Stage fright can occur in people of all experiences and backgrounds, from those who are completely new to being in front of an audience to those who have done so for years. It is commonly recognized in the population. Stage fright may, for example, have a negative impact on the individual's performance, such that it affects their confidence during job interviews. It also affects actors, comedians, musicians, and politicians. Many people with no other problems in communication can experience stage fright, but some people with chronic stage fright also have social anxiety or social phobia which are chronic feelings of high anxiety in any social situation. Stage fright can also be seen in school situations, like stand up projects and class speeches. Effects When someone starts to feel the sensation of being scared or nervous they start to experience anxiety. According to a Harvard Mental Health Letter, \\"Anxiety usually has physical symptoms that may include a racing heart, a dry mouth, a shaky voice, blushing, trembling, sweating, lightheadedness, and nausea\\". It triggers the body to activate its sympathetic nervous system. This process takes place when the body releases adrenaline into the blood stream causing a chain of reactions to occur. This bodily response is known as the \\"fight or flight\\" syndrome, a naturally occurring process in the body done to protect itself from harm. \\"The neck muscles contract, bringing the head down and shoulders up, while the back muscles draw the spine into a concave curve. This, in turn, pushes the pelvis forward and pulls the genitals up, slumping the body into a classic fetal position\\". In trying to resist this position, the body will begin to shake in places such as the legs and hands. Several other things happen besides this. Muscles in the body contract, causing them to be tense and ready to attack. Second, \\"blood vessels in the extremities constrict\\". This can leave a person with the feeling of cold fingers, toes, nose, and ears. Constricted blood vessels also gives the body extra blood flow to the vital organs. In addition, those experiencing stage fright will have an increase in blood pressure, which supplies the body with more nutrients and oxygen in response to the \\"fight or flight\\" instincts. This, in return, causes the body to overheat and sweat. Breathing will increase so that the body can obtain the desired amount of oxygen for the muscles and organs. Pupils will dilate giving someone the inability to view any notes they have in close proximity; however, long range vision is improved making the speaker more aware of their audience's facial expressions and nonverbal cues in response to the speaker's performance. Lastly, the digestive system shuts down to prepare for producing energy for an immediate emergency response. This can leave the body with the effects of dry mouth, nausea, or butterflies. Treatment Propranolol is occasionally used to treat performance anxiety. Famous people Many well-known public performers have had stage fright and were able to overcome their problem, including Al Jolson, Brian Wilson, Virginia O'Brien, Michael Gambon, Lorde, Jason Alexander, Mose Allison, Maya Angelou, David Brenner, Peter Coyote, Olympia Dukakis, Richard Lewis, Barbra Streisand,\\"I Can't Go On!\\" by Joan Acocella, The New Yorker, 3 August 2015 Adele, David Warner,'The Vanishing', interview with David Warner, 'The Guardian', 5 February 2002. Niall Horan, Frankie Howerd, Mike Yarwood, Ian Holm , Lady Gaga, Mariah Carey, John Lydon, and Amanda Seyfried. In some cases, famous stars have struggled to cope with their anxiety. Hugh Grant said on starring in the movie Music and Lyrics that he \\"did the whole film full of lorazepam.\\" Not every performer suffers from stage fright.

It was primarily venerated on the island of R√ºgen into the 12th century. He is often considered a local Rugian variant of the pan-Slavic god Perun. Sometimes referred to as Beli (or Byali) Vid (Beli = white, bright, shining), Svetovid is associated with war and divination and depicted as a four-headed god with two heads looking forward and two back. A statue portraying the god shows him with four heads, each one looking in a separate direction, a symbolic representation of the four directions of the compass, and also perhaps the four seasons of the year. Each face had a specific color. The northern face of this totem was white (hence White Ruthenia / Belarus and the White Sea), the western, red (hence Red Ruthenia), the southern, black (hence the Black Sea) and the eastern, green (hence Zeleny klyn).Ukrainian Soviet Encyclopedic dictionary, Kyiv, 1987. Etymology Svetovid by Benedictine monk Bernard de Montfaucon, 1722 The forms Sventevith and Zvantewith show that the name derives from the word svƒôt—ä, meaning \\"sacred\\". The second stem is sometimes reconstructed as vit = \\"lord, ruler, winner\\". In Lithuanian : ≈†ventavydis (Holy Knowledge,Holy Wisdom,Holy Seeing),(≈†venta meaning \\"Holy\\";Vydis meaning \\"Knowledge\\" or \\"Seeing\\"),(Schwentine ( Lith: Holy one ) is a river in the North German state of Schleswig-Holstein ,South of R√ºgen island),(≈†ventoji River (holy river),≈†ventoji is an important archaeological site as the first artefacts are dated about 3000 BC north of Palanga ,many lakes called ≈†ventas(\\"holly\\"). The name recorded in chronicles of contemporary Christian monks is Svantevit, which, if we assume it was properly transcribed, could be an adjective meaning approx. \\"Dawning One\\" (svantev, svitanje = \\"dawning, raising of the Sun in the morning\\" + it, adjective suffix), implying either a connection with the \\"Morning Star\\" or with the Sun itself. Alternative names Beyond the names above referenced, Svetovid can also be known as Svitovyd (Ukrainian), Svyatovit (alternative name in Ukrainian), Svyentovit (alternative name in Ukrainian), Svetovid (Serbian, Croatian, Slovenian, Macedonian and Bosnian, and alternative name in Bulgarian), Suvid (alternative name in Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian), Svantevit (Wendish, alternative name in Ukrainian and possibly the original proto-Slavic name), Svantevid (alternative name in Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian), Svantovit (Czech and Slovak), Svantov√≠t (Czech), Svantovid (alternative name in Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian), Swantov√≠t, Sventovit, Zvantevith (Latin and alternative name in Serbian and Croatian), ≈öwiƒôtowit (Polish), Sutvid, Svevid, and Vid.

The prophecy before the battle, J√≥zef Ryszkiewicz, 1890 According to various chronicles (i.e. Gesta Danorum by Saxo Grammaticus and Chronica Slavorum by Helmold), the temple at Jaromarsburg contained a giant wooden statue of Svantevit depicting him with four heads (or one head with four faces) and a horn of abundance. Each year the horn was filled with fresh mead. The temple was also the seat of an oracle in which the chief priest predicted the future of his tribe by observing the behaviour of a white horse identified with Svantevit and casting dice (horse oracles have a long history in this region, being already attested in the writings of Tacitus). The temple also contained the treasury of the tribe and was defended by a group of 300 mounted warriors which formed the core of the tribal armed forces. Origins The decline of the pagan cult. Bishop Absalon topples the god Svantevit at Arkona in 1169. David Leeming identifies the four heads as Rujevit, representing autumn and east, Porevit, representing summer and south, Iarovit, representing spring and west, and Bialobog, representing winter and north. Some interpretations claim that Svetovit was another name for Radegast, while another states that he was a fake god, a Wendish construction based on the name St. Vitus. However, the common practice of the Christian Church was to replace existing pagan deities and places of worship with analogous persons and rituals of Christian content, so it seems more likely that Saint Vitus was created to replace the original Svanto-Vit. According to a common interpretation, Svantevit was a Rugian counterpart of the pan-Slavic Perun. In Croatia, on the island of Braƒç, the highest peak is called Vid's Mountain. In the Dinaric Alps there is a peak called \\"Suvid\\" and a Church of St. Vid. Among the Serbs, the cult of Svetovid is partially preserved through the Feast of St. Vitus, \\"Vidovdan\\", one of the most important annual events in Serbian Orthodox Christian tradition. In popular culture The science fiction story \\"Delenda Est\\" by Poul Anderson depicts an alternate history world where Carthage defeated Rome, Christianity never arose and in the 20th century, Svantevit is still a main deity of a major European power called Littorn (that is, Lithuania). A devotee of this god, in the story, is called Boleslav Arkonsky ‚Äì a name evidently derived from the above- mentioned temple at Arkona.

It was established by Alamein Kopu, a member of the New Zealand Parliament who had left her original party (the Alliance). After a short time as an independent MP, Kopu established Mana Wahine as her own party. It was officially registered on 12 June 1998. The name \\"Mana Wahine Te Ira Tangata\\" is difficult to translate, but essentially refers to dignity or respect for women. Kopu claims that the party was intended to support MƒÅori women, promoting a MƒÅori form of feminism. Critics of Alamein Kopu, however, did not see the party as a genuine ideological organization. Rather, they saw a more cynical reason for the party's creation ‚Äì as leader of a party rather than an independent, Kopu was entitled to $80,000 in additional funding. Jim Anderton, leader of Kopu's former party, said that the creation of Mana Wahine approached corruption, a sentiment which was echoed by several other politicians. Kopu (and thus Mana Wahine) closely followed the National Party government of Jenny Shipley. National, having recently ended its coalition with the New Zealand First party, was highly interested in finding additional parliamentary support. It is sometimes claimed that National's influence was instrumental in gaining Mana Wahine official recognition as a party, and many members of the Opposition claimed that this help was given in order to secure Mana Wahine's vote ‚Äì Trevor Mallard, a Labour Party MP, openly called it a \\"bribe\\". Mana Wahine contested only two elections. The first was the Taranaki- King Country by-election in 1998. The Mana Wahine candidate, Mary Gilmore, received 7 of the 20,225 valid votes. In the 1999 general election, Mana Wahine failed to submit a party list, with Kopu saying that she missed the deadline by just minutes. The party nevertheless contested twelve electorate seats, gaining a total of 1,082 votes across the country. Kopu herself contested the Waiariki electorate, and gained sixth place with 1.70% of the vote. 12 February 2001, Mana Wahine was removed from the list of registered political parties at its own request.

She sailed on her maiden voyage in 1921, and became a troop and supply ship during the Second World War. Scythia was the longest serving Cunard liner until 4 September 2005, when her record was surpassed by .QE2 Daily Programme 04:09:05 History After heavy losses during the First World War, Cunard Line embarked on an ambitious building programme. It decided to build \\"intermediate\\", ships rather than the large liners it had previously employed. Scythia was the first ship in this new fleet, and building began in 1919. Scythia was built for the services between Liverpool and Queenstown in the British Isles to New York and Boston, in the United States. A luxury liner designed to appeal to American tourists, in the mid-1920s, she began sailing from New York to the Mediterranean. Scythia was requisitioned at the end of 1939, left Liverpool on 24 September 1940 with 48 children bound for Boston, sponsored by readers of the Boston Evening Transcript newspaper,The Wartime Memories Project ‚Äì Evacuees part of a wider British evacuation programme under the Children's Overseas Reception Board. She became a troop ship on 1 November 1940, and sailed from Liverpool to the Middle East carrying the 1st King's Dragoon Guards. She then saw service carrying evacuees from Liverpool to New York. In 1942, Scythia took part in the Allied invasion of French North Africa. On 23 November she was struck by an aerial torpedo. Her crew managed to get her to harbour at Algiers, and she suffered only five casualties out of a complement of 4,300 men. Scythia was salvaged and taken to New York for repair in January 1943, and afterwards ferried American troops to Europe. At the end of the war she took many US troops back from Europe, many of them accompanied by their new brides, before sailing to India to bring home UK troops from the war in the East. She was also a war bride ship taking Canadian war brides and their children from Liverpool to Pier 21 in Halifax in the early part of 1946. One of her last missions as a troop ship was to bring the 1st King's Dragoon Guards home to Liverpool, on 11 March 1948. Later in 1948, Scythia was handed to the International Refugee Organisation to take refugees from Europe to Canada. In 1950 she became a passenger ship again, sailing from Britain to Canada and later to New York. Again in 1957 the Scythia was used to transport Hungarian refugees to Canada (departed Southampton England 19 Jan 1957), landing in Halifax, Nova Scotia at Pier 21 (Canada's equivalent to Ellis Island in New York). Her final route was around the North Sea. In 1958, after 37 years of service, Scythia was delivered to the shipbreakers at Inverkeithing by her final Master, Geoffrey Thrippleton Marr.

Directed by John Ford, it is an adaptation of the 1933 Maxwell Anderson play. The screenplay was written by Dudley Nichols. It is largely in blank verse. Ginger Rogers wanted to play this role and made a convincing screen test, but RKO rejected her request to be cast in the part feeling that the role was not suitable to Miss Rogers' image. Plot summary Mary (Katharine Hepburn), by assuming her throne as queen of Scotland, strikes terror into the heart of Queen Elizabeth I (Florence Eldridge). After languishing in jail for 18 years at Elizabeth's command, Mary is offered a pardon if she will sign away her throne. Will she accept the deal, or die instead?  Cast   Accuracy  Lobby card with Katharine Hepburn, Douglas Walton, and Fredric March The film does not keep close to the historical truth, portraying Mary as something of a wronged martyr and her third husband, James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell (played by Fredric March), as a romantic hero. While true that Bothwell was a well known scoundrel his last marriage to Mary was genuine. Regarding Mary's historical status the false imprisonment by Elizabeth I and Anglo protestant intrigue in Scotland did undermine her more legitimate claim to not just the throne of Scotland but more so to the throne of England making her a dire threat to Elizabeth I.  Reception  Hepburn in a publicity still from film Contemporary reviews were generally positive. Frank S. Nugent of The New York Times wrote it had a \\"blend of excellence and mere adequacy.\\" He wrote that the film had \\"depth, vigor and warm humanity\\" but had scenes which \\"lack the vitality they possessed in the play\\", and considered Hepburn's characterization of the title role rather too soft in comparison with the historical Mary. Variety praised the \\"extra-strong cast\\" and Ford's \\"sure- footed\\" direction. Hepburn's performance was described as \\"not really Mary Stuart but rather Katie Hepburn. And that is all in the film's favor because it humanizes it all and makes it that much more nearly acceptable.\\" However, the review also found the film too long and the ending too sad, and conceding it could not end any other way without \\"completely corrupting history.\\" \\"Impressive historical drama finely acted and produced with all-around distinction\\", reported Film Daily. Motion Picture Daily called the film \\"a splendidly powerful drama\\" with a \\"sincere, intelligent and genuine\\" performance by Hepburn. Russell Maloney reviewed the film negatively in The New Yorker, writing that despite its high production values, \\"it has little or nothing to do with Maxwell Anderson's play. Any other historical drama of the period could have been sandwiched in between these scenes and it wouldn't have made a bit of difference.\\" Of Hepburn's performance, Maloney wrote that she had \\"the cards stacked against her from the very start, because pageantry naturally interferes with characterization.\\" The film is highly regarded by a few critics today, but in its time was a box-office flop, making a loss of $165,000. This was Katharine Hepburn's second flop in a row causing her to being labeled \\"box office poison\\" in the late 1930s, leading to (after a two- year screen absence) her move to MGM for her comeback in The Philadelphia Story.

Life and explorations He was born at Riga, Latvia, then part of the Russian Empire. He was educated at the universities of Heidelberg, Munich and Berlin (1856‚Äì1862), where he particularly devoted himself to botany and palaeontology. Commissioned to arrange the collections brought from Sudan by Adalbert von Barnim and Robert Hartmann, his attention was directed to that region; and in 1863 he travelled round the shores of the Red Sea, repeatedly traversed the district between that sea and the Nile, passed on to Khartoum, and returned to Europe in 1866. His researches attracted so much attention that in 1868 the Berlin-based Alexander von Humboldt Foundation entrusted him with an important scientific mission to the interior of East Africa. Starting from Khartoum in January 1869, he went up the White Nile to Bahr-el-Ghazal, and then, with a party of ivory dealers, through the regions inhabited by the Diur (Dyoor), Dinka, Bongo and Niam-Niam; crossing the Congo-Nile watershed he entered the country of the Mangbetu (Monbuttu) and discovered the river Uele (March 19, 1870), which by its westward flow he knew was independent of the Nile. Schweinfurth formed the conclusion that it belonged to the Chad system, and it was several years before its connection with the Congo was demonstrated. The discovery of the Uele was Schweinfurth's greatest geographical achievement, though he did much to elucidate the hydrography of the Bahr-el-Ghazal system. Of greater importance were the very considerable additions he made to the knowledge of the inhabitants and of the flora and fauna of Central Africa. He described in detail the cannibalistic practices of the Mangbetu, and his discovery of the pygmy Aka people settled conclusively the question as to the existence of dwarf races in tropical Africa. Unfortunately, a December 1870 fire in his camp destroyed nearly all that he had collected. He returned to Khartoum in July 1871 and published an account of the expedition, under the title of Im Herzen von Afrika (Leipzig, 1874; English edition, The Heart of Africa, 1873, new ed. 1878). In 1873-1874 he accompanied Friedrich Gerhard Rohlfs in his expedition into the Libyan Desert. Settling at Cairo in 1875, he founded a geographical society, under the auspices of the Khedive Ismail, and devoted himself almost exclusively to African studies, historical and ethnographical. In 1876, he travelled into the Arabian Desert with Paul G√ºssfeldt, and continued his explorations therein at intervals until 1888, and during the same period made geological and botanical investigations in the Fayum, in the valley of the Nile. In 1889 he returned to Berlin; but he visited the Italian colony of Eritrea in 1891, 1892 and 1894. Schweinfurth died in Berlin. The accounts of all his travels and researches have appeared either in book or pamphlet form or in periodicals, such as Petermanns Mitteilungen, the Zeitschrift f√ºr Erdkunde.

Coll gained notoriety for the alleged accidental killing of a young child during a mob kidnap attempt. Early years Hi√∫da√≠ Beag's Tavern, Gweedore, the reputed birthplace of Vincent Coll. Coll was born in Gweedore, an Irish-speaking region of County Donegal, Ireland; related to the notorious Curran family, his family emigrated to the U.S. in the following year as steerage passengers on board the S/S Columbia, sailing from port of Derry to the port of New York, April 3 to 12, 1909. Coll was a distant relative of the former Northern Ireland Assemblywoman Br√≠d Rodgers. At age 12, Coll was first sent to a reform school. After being expelled from multiple Catholic reform schools, he joined The Gophers street gang. Run-ins with the law were almost inevitable. Vincent soon developed a reputation for being a wild child of the streets. At age 16, he was arrested for carrying a gun, and by the age of 23 he had been arrested a dozen times. In the late 1920s he started working as an armed guard for the illegal beer delivery trucks of Dutch Schultz's mob. Mob assassin and kidnapper Coll's ruthlessness made him a valued enforcer to Schultz at first. As Schultz's criminal empire grew in power during the 1920s, he employed Coll as an assassin. At age 19 Coll was charged with the murder of Anthony Borello, the owner of a speakeasy, and Mary Smith, a dance hall hostess. Coll allegedly murdered Borello because he refused to sell Schultz's bootleg alcohol. The charges were eventually dismissed, and many suspect this to have been from Schultz's influence. Schultz was not happy about Coll's actions. In 1929, without Schultz's permission, Coll robbed a dairy in the Bronx of $17,000. He and his gang posed as armed guards to gain access to the cashier's room. Schultz later confronted Coll about the robbery, but rather than being apologetic, Coll demanded to be an equal partner; Schultz declined. By January 1930, Coll had formed his own gang and was engaged in a shooting war with Schultz. One of the earliest victims was Peter Coll, Vincent's older brother, who was shot dead on May 30, 1931, while driving down a Harlem street. Coll subsequently went into a rage of grief and vengeance. Over the next three weeks he gunned down four of Schultz‚Äôs men. In all, around 20 men were killed in the bloodletting; the exact figure is hard to pin down as New York was also in the midst of the vicious Castellammarese War at the same time. It was mayhem on the streets of Manhattan and the police often had difficulty in deciding which corpse belonged to which war. On June 2, Coll and his gang broke into a garage owned by Schultz and destroyed 120 vending machines and 10 trucks. As the war continued, Vincent Coll and his gang killed approximately 20 of Schultz's men. To finance his new gang, Coll kidnapped rival gangsters and held them for ransom. He knew that the victims would not report the kidnappings to police; they would have a hard time explaining to the Bureau of Internal Revenue why the ransom cash had not been reported as income. One of Coll's best-known victims was gambler George \\"Big Frenchy\\" DeMange, a close associate of Owney Madden, boss of the Hell's Kitchen Irish Mob. According to one account, Coll telephoned DeMange and asked to meet with him. When DeMange arrived at the meeting place, Coll kidnapped him at gunpoint. He released DeMange 18 hours later after receiving a ransom payment.  Alleged child killer  On July 28, 1931, Coll allegedly participated in a kidnapping attempt that resulted in the shooting death of a child. Coll's target was bootlegger Joseph Rao, a Schultz underling who was lounging in front of a social club. Several children were playing outside an apartment house. A large touring car pulled up to the curb, and several men pointed shotguns and submachine guns towards Rao and started shooting. Rao threw himself to the sidewalk, and four young children were wounded in the attack. One of them, five-year-old Michael Vengalli, later died at Beth David Hospital. After the Vengalli killing, New York City Mayor Jimmy Walker dubbed Coll a \\"Mad Dog\\". Vincent Coll leaving homicide court surrounded by police officers, 1931 On October 4, 1931, after an extensive manhunt, New York police arrested Coll at a hotel in the Bronx. He had dyed his hair black and grown a mustache and was wearing horn-rimmed glasses. He surrendered peacefully. During a police lineup, a defiant Coll said that he had been in Albany, New York, for the past several months and refused to answer any other questions without an attorney present. On October 5, a grand jury in New York city indicted Coll in the Vengalli murder. The Coll trial began in December 1931. He retained famed defense lawyer Samuel Leibowitz. Coll claimed that he was miles away from the shooting scene and was being framed by his enemies. He added that he would love to tear the throat out of the person who killed Vengalli. The prosecution case soon fell apart. Their sole witness to the shooting, George Brecht, admitted on the witness stand to having a criminal and mental health record, and to making similar testimony in a previous murder case in St Louis, Missouri. At the end of December, the judge issued a directed verdict of not guilty for Coll. Immediately after the Vengalli verdict, a New York City police inspector told Coll that the police would arrest him whenever he was spotted in New York City. He was soon rejailed for carrying a gun. When the inspector referred to Coll as a baby killer, Coll hotly replied, \\"I'm no baby killer\\". Soon after his acquittal, Coll married Lottie Kreisberger, a fashion designer in New York. Failed hit In September 1931, between the killing of young Vengalli and his acquittal for that death, Coll was hired by Salvatore Maranzano, who had recently crowned himself capo di tutti capi, to murder his right-hand man, Charles \\"Lucky\\" Luciano. Lucchese alerted Luciano that he was marked for death. Months earlier, Luciano had helped Maranzano win the Castellammarese War and gain control of the New York Maranzano soon realized Luciano was a threat. On September 10, Maranzano ordered Luciano, Vito Genovese and Frank Costello to come to his office at the 230 Park Avenue in Manhattan. Convinced that Maranzano planned to murder them, Luciano decided to act first. He sent to Maranzano's office four Jewish gangsters whose faces were unknown to Maranzano's people. They had been secured with the aid of Lansky and Siegel.\\"Lucky Luciano: Criminal Mastermind,\\" Time, Dec. 7, 1998 Disguised as government agents, two of the gangsters disarmed Maranzano's bodyguards. The other two, aided by Lucchese, who was there to point Maranzano out, stabbed the boss multiple times before shooting him.\\"Genovese family saga\\". Crime Library.\\"The Genovese Family,\\" Crime Library, Crime Library According to the 1963 testimony of government witness Joseph Valachi, Coll arrived at the office to kill Luciano, only to meet Luciano's hitmen fleeing the scene. After learning from them that Maranzano was dead, Coll immediately left the building, $25,000 richer. Gangland death It was said that both Dutch Schultz and Owney Madden had put a $50,000 bounty on Vincent Coll's head. At one point, Schultz had actually walked into a Bronx police station and offered \\"a house in Westchester\\" to whoever killed Coll. On February 1, 1932, four or five gunmen invaded a Bronx apartment which Coll was rumored to frequent and opened fire with pistols and submachine guns. Three people (Coll gangsters Patsy Del Greco and Fiorio Basile and bystander Emily Tanzillo) were killed. Three others were wounded. Coll himself did not show up until 30 minutes after the shooting.Downey, pg. 219 A week after the Bronx shootings, at 12:30 A.M. on February 8, Coll was using a phone booth at a drug store at Eighth Avenue and 23rd Street in Manhattan. He was reportedly talking to Madden, demanding $50,000 from the gangster under the threat of kidnapping his brother-in-law. Madden kept Coll on the line while it was traced. Three men in a dark limousine soon arrived at the drug store. While one waited in the car, two others stepped out. One man waited outside while the other walked inside the store. The gunman told the cashier, \\"Keep cool, now\\", drew a Thompson submachine gun from under his overcoat and opened fire on Coll in the glass phone booth. Coll died instantly. The killers took off in their car. They were chased unsuccessfully up Eighth Avenue by a foot patrolman who had heard the gunshots and commandeered a passing taxi, but the car got away. A New York City police officer standing outside the drugstore where Vincent Coll was murdered in 1932. A total of 15 bullets were removed from Coll's body at the morgue; more may have passed through him. Coll was buried next to his brother Peter at Saint Raymond's Cemetery in the Bronx. Dutch Schultz sent a floral wreath bearing a banner with the message, \\"From the boys\\". Aftermath Coll's killers were never identified. Dutch Schultz attorney Dixie Davis later claimed that gangster Bo Weinberg was the getaway driver of the limousine. Another suspect was one of Coll's own men, Edward Popke aka Fats McCarthy. The submachine gun that killed Coll was found a year later in the possession of a Hell's Kitchen gunman named \\"Tough\\" Tommy Protheroe, who used it during a 1933 saloon killing. On May 16, 1935, Protheroe and his girlfriend Elizabeth Connors were shot and killed by unknown triggermen in Queens.Downey, pg. 290-91 Dutch Schultz continued to operate his rackets for only a few more years. On October 23, 1935, Schultz was killed at the Palace Chophouse in Newark, New Jersey. He was supposedly murdered on orders from Luciano and the new National Crime Syndicate. Coll's widow, Lottie, was convicted of carrying a concealed weapon and sentenced to six months. She refused to leave prison following her parole, because she feared the people who had killed her husband would also murder her. In 1935, Owney Madden, still under police scrutiny for the Coll killing, moved to Arkansas, where he died in 1965.

She studied mathematics and astronomy, and was nominated to be jointly the first female member of the Royal Astronomical Society at the same time as Caroline Herschel. The word scientist was coined for her. When John Stuart Mill, the philosopher and economist, organised a massive petition to Parliament to give women the right to vote, he had Somerville put her signature first on the petition. When she died in 1872, The Morning Post declared in her obituary that \\"Whatever difficulty we might experience in the middle of the nineteenth century in choosing a king of science, there could be no question whatever as to the queen of science\\". Somerville College, a college of the University of Oxford, is named after her, reflecting the virtues of liberalism and academic success which the college wished to embody. She is featured on the front of the Royal Bank of Scotland polymer ¬£10 note launched in 2017, alongside a quote from her work The Connection of the Physical Sciences. Early life and education Somerville was the daughter of Vice-Admiral Sir William George Fairfax, scion of a distinguished family of Fairfaxes, and she was related to several prominent Scottish houses through her mother, the admiral's second wife, Margaret Charters, daughter of Samuel Charters, a solicitor. Vice-Admiral William Fairfax; painted in 1798 She was born at the manse of Jedburgh, in the Borders, which was the house of her maternal aunt, wife of Dr. Thomas Somerville (1741‚Äì1830) (author of My Own Life and Times). Her childhood home was at Burntisland, Fife. She was the second of four surviving children (three of her siblings had died in infancy). She was particularly close to her oldest brother Sam. The family lived in genteel poverty because her father's naval pay remained meagre as he rose through the ranks. Her mother supplemented the household's income by growing vegetables, maintaining an orchard and keeping cows for milk. Her mother taught her to read the Bible and Calvinist catechisms, and when not occupied with household chores Mary roamed among the birds and flowers in the garden. In her autobiography Somerville recollects that after returning from sea her father said to her mother \\"This kind of life will never do, Mary must at least know how to write and keep accounts\\". Thus the 10-year-old was sent for a year of tuition at an expensive boarding school in Musselburgh. Somerville learned the first principles of writing, rudimentary French and English grammar. Upon returning home, she: > ...was no longer amused in the gardens, but wandered about the country. When > the tide was out I spent hours on the sands, looking at the star-fish and > sea-urchins, or watching the children digging for sand-eels, cockles, and > the spouting razor-fish. I made collections of shells, such as were cast > ashore, some so small that they appeared like white specks in patches of > black sand. There was a small pier on the sands for shipping limestone > brought from the coal mines inland. I was astonished to see the surface of > these blocks of stone covered with beautiful impressions of what seemed to > be leaves; how they got there I could not imagine, but I picked up the > broken bits, and even large pieces, and brought them to my repository. Her shell collection was given to Somerville College, Oxford by her descendants. During bad weather she occupied herself with reading the books in her father's library, including Shakespeare, and fulfilling her \\"domestic duties\\". In later life she recollected \\"These occupied a great part of my time; besides, I had to shew my sampler, working the alphabet from A to Z, as well as the ten numbers, on canvas\\". Her aunt Janet came to live with the family and reportedly said to her mother \\"I wonder you let Mary waste her time in reading, she never shews more than if she were a man\\". As a consequence Mary was sent to the village school to learn plain needlework. The youngster \\"was annoyed that my turn for reading was so much disapproved of, and thought it unjust that women should have been given a desire for knowledge if it were wrong to acquire it.\\" The village school master came to the house on several evenings in the week to teach Mary. He taught her how to use the two small globes in the house. In her Personal Recollections Mary notes that in the village school the boys learned Latin, \\"but it was thought sufficient for the girls to be able to read the Bible; very few even learnt writing.\\" View of the City of Edinburgh by Alexander Nasmyth. Mary spent the winters in Edinburgh and attended Nasmyth's academy. When Mary was 13 her mother sent her to writing school in Edinburgh during the winter months, where she improved her writing skills and studied the common rules of arithmetic. Back in Burntisland she taught herself sufficient Latin to read the books in the home library. While visiting her aunt in Jedburgh she met her uncle Dr Thomas Somerville and picked up the courage to tell him that she had been trying to learn Latin. Dr Somerville assured her that in ancient times many women had been very elegant scholars, and proceeded to teach her Latin by reading Virgil with her. While visiting another uncle, William Charters, in Edinburgh, Mary was sent to Strange's dancing school, where she learned manners and how to curtsey. She also accompanied her uncle and aunt on their visits to the Lyell family in Kinnordy; Charles Lyell would go on to become a celebrated geologist and a friend of Mary. With regard to the political upheaval of the time and the French Revolution she later wrote that her father was a Tory and that the \\"unjust and exaggerated abuse of the Liberal party made me a Liberal. From my earliest years my mind revolved against oppression and tyranny, and I resented the injustice of the world in denying all those privileges of education to my sex which were so lavishly bestowed on men.\\" Mary and her oldest brother Sam would refuse to take sugar in their tea, in protest against the institution of slavery. Somerville asserted that her liberal religious and political opinions remained unchanged throughout her life, but that she was never a republican. Commemorative medal of Mary Somerville While accompanying her uncle and aunt to Burntisland in the summer she had access to elementary books on algebra and geometry. She spent the summer learning to play the piano and learning Greek so that she could read Xenophon and Herodotus. Back in Edinburgh she was allowed to attend the academy Alexander Nasmyth, which had opened for ladies. Nasmyth advised another student to study Euclid's Elements to gain a foundation in perspective, astronomy and mechanical science. Somerville spotted the opportunity, as she thought the book would help her understand Navigations by John Robertson. She continued in the traditional role of the daughter of a well-connected family, attending social events and maintaining a sweet and polite manner ‚Äì she was nicknamed \\"the Rose of Jedburgh\\" among Edinburgh socialites. Back in Burntisland a young tutor came to stay with the family to educate her younger brother Henry. Mr Craw was a Greek and Latin scholar, and Somerville asked him to purchase elementary books on algebra and geometry for her. He presented Somerville with Euclid's Elements and Algebra by John Bonnycastle. Somerville would rise early to play the piano, painted during the day, and stayed up late to study Euclid and algebra. When the family friend Lord Balmuto invited her to visit his family, Somerville first saw a laboratory. She also spent some time with the Oswalds family in Dunnikeir. Somerville was impressed with their daughter Elizabeth Oswald, a bold horsewoman who became a Greek and Latin scholar and married Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin. The winters were usually spent in Edinburgh, and under the care of Lady Burchan she made her first appearance at a ball, her first dancing partner being the Earl of Minto. In the following autumn of 1797 her father was caught up in a mutiny while serving as flag-captain under Admiral Duncan on , but the Battle of Camperdown against the Dutch fleet was won. Her father was knighted and made Colonel of Marines. Her eldest brother died at the age of 21 in Calcutta while serving in the East India Company's military service. The family had hoped that he would make a sufficient fortune in a few years to enable him to come home again. Marriage and studies In 1804 she met her first husband, her distant cousin Lieutenant Samuel Greig, son of Admiral Samuel Greig, when he came to pay a visit. He was commissioner of the Russian navy and Russian consul for Britain. They married and had two children, one of whom, Woronzow Greig, would become a barrister and scientist. They lived in London, but it was not a happy time for Somerville. Although she could study, her husband did not think much of women's capacity to pursue academic interests. Indeed, Greig \\"possessed in full the prejudice against learned women which was common at that time.\\" Somerville took lessons in French. When her husband died in 1807, while she was still nursing their youngest child, she returned home to Scotland. Page 44 from Mechanism of the Heavens. Somerville considered the simple pendulum and the workings of the solar system more generally. In Mechanism she referenced Lacroix, Biot, Poisson, Euler, Clairaut, as well as Newton and the integral calculus. Back in Scotland she resumed her mathematical studies. By that time she had studied plane and spherical trigonometry, conic sections and James Ferguson's Astronomy. Now she first read Isaac Newton's Principia, which she continued to study. Her inheritance from Greig gave her the freedom to pursue intellectual interests. John Playfair, professor of natural philosophy at University of Edinburgh, encouraged her studies, and through him she began a correspondence with William Wallace, with whom she discussed mathematical problems. She started to solve mathematical problems posed in the mathematical journal of the Military College at Marlow and she eventually made a name for herself when solving a diophantine problem for which she was awarded a silver medal in 1811. Somerville had five solutions published in Volumes 3 and 4 of the Mathematical Repository under the pseudonym 'A Lady'; two of these solutions demonstrated her early adoption of differential calculus, and therefore her contribution to the circulation and visibility of this mathematics in early 19th-century Britain. Wallace suggested that she should study the writings of the French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace, which summarised the theory of gravity and collected the mathematical results that had been established in the 50 years since Principia had been published. She said that studying Laplace's work gave her the confidence to persevere in her mathematical studies. Somerville extended her studies into astronomy, chemistry, geography, microscopy, electricity and magnetism. At the age of 33 she bought herself a library of scientific books. These included: Louis-Benjamin Franc≈ìur's Elements of Mechanics, Sylvestre Fran√ßois Lacroix' Algebra and Calculus Treatise, Jean-Baptiste Biot's Analytical Geometry and Astronomy, Sim√©on Denis Poisson's Treatise on Mechanics, Joseph-Louis Lagrange's Theory of Analytical Functions, Leonhard Euler's Elements of Algebra and Isoperimetrical Problems, Alexis Clairaut's Figure of the Earth, Gaspard Monge's Application of Analysis to Geometry, and Fran√ßois Callet's Logarithmus. In her Personal Recollections Somerville expressed the opinion that at the time mathematical science was at a low ebb in Britain, because reverence for Newton had prevented local scientists from adopting the calculus, while outside Britain astronomical and mechanical science had reached a high degree of perfection. In her opinion this deadlock was only broken when in 1816 Charles Babbage, John Herschel and George Peacock published a translation from French of the lectures of Lacroix, which was then the state-of-the-art calculus textbook. While staying with her family in Scotland, Somerville became acquainted with several leading intellectual lights, such as Henry Brougham. In 1812 she married another cousin, Dr William Somerville (1771‚Äì1860), inspector of the Army Medical Board, who encouraged and greatly aided her in the study of the physical sciences. Her husband was elected to the Royal Society and together they moved in the leading social circles of the day. As well as scientists, she was well known to leading writers and artists, for example J.M.W. Turner. Her husband's family were neighbours of the writer Walter Scott. She wrote \\"I shall never forget the charm of this little society, especially the supper-parties at Abbotsford, when Scott was in the highest glee, telling amusing tales, ancient legends, ghost and witch stories.\\" In her second marriage Somerville had four children. In 1819 her husband was appointed physician to Chelsea Hospital and the family moved to Hanover Square into a government house in Chelsea. Somerville was a friend of Anne Isabella Milbanke, Baroness Wentworth, and was mathematics tutor to her daughter, Ada Lovelace. With Somerville, Ada attended the scientific gatherings where she met Charles Babbage. Somerville College owns a letter from Babbage to Somerville inviting her to view his 'Calculating Engine'. Somerville visited Babbage frequently while he was \\"making his Calculating-machines\\". Somerville and Lovelace maintained a close friendship and when Lovelace encountered difficulties with a mathematical calculation she would walk to Somerville's house and discuss the matter over a cup of tea. In 1823 the Somervilles' youngest daughter died after illness. While living in Chelsea the Somervilles travelled across Europe on a number of occasions, leaving their children with their German governess. Among their travel companions was the jurist and politician Sir James Mackintosh. Before leaving London the Somervilles made contact with people they wanted to meet, and on their European tours they paid visits to numerous celebrated intellectuals. The Somervilles also received frequent visitors; Maria Edgeworth would visit them when in England. Science practice and writing Page 157 from Mechanism of the Heavens, Somerville discusses the law of universal gravity and Kepler's laws of planetary motion. Cover page of On the Connexion of the Physical Sciences Somerville conducted experiments to explore the relationship between light and magnetism and she published her first paper, \\"The magnetic properties of the violet rays of the solar spectrum\\", in the Proceedings of the Royal Society in 1826. Sir David Brewster, inventor of the kaleidoscope, wrote in 1829 that Mary Somerville was \\"certainly the most extraordinary woman in Europe - a mathematician of the very first rank with all the gentleness of a woman\\". Somerville was requested by Lord Brougham to translate for the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge the M√©canique C√©leste of Pierre- Simon Laplace. Laplace had, in five exhaustive volumes, summed up the current state of gravitational mathematics and M√©canique C√©leste was acclaimed as the greatest intellectual achievement since the Principia. Somerville produced not a translation, but an expanded version of the first two volumes. She wrote a standalone exposition of the mathematics behind the workings of the solar system, of which she said \\"I translated Laplace's work from algebra into common language\\". It was published in 1831, under the title of The Mechanism of the Heavens. It made her at once famous. Mechanism was set as a textbook for undergraduates at University of Cambridge until the 1880s. After receiving a copy of Mechanism Joanna Baillie wrote to Somerville, \\"I feel myself greatly honoured by receiving such a mark of regard from one who has done more to remove the light estimation in which the capacity of women is too often held than all that has been accomplished by the whole Sisterhood of Poetical Damsels & novel-writing Authors.\\" The book was praised by George Peacock, Professor of the University of Cambridge, thus many of the 750 copies printed were bought in Cambridge. Reviews were favourable and Somerville received letters of congratulation from \\"many men of science\\". She was elected honorary member of the Royal Irish Academy, of the Bristol Philosophical Institution and the Soci√©t√© de Physique et d'Histoire Naturelle de Gen√®ve in 1834. The British Crown granted her a civil pension of ¬£200 a year in recognition of her eminence in science and literature. Somerville was passionate about astronomy and believed it to be the most extensive example of the connection of the physical sciences in that it combined the sciences of number and quantity, of rest and motion. > In [astronomy] we perceive the operation of a force which is mixed up with > everything that exists in the heavens or on earth; which pervades every > atom, rules the motions of animate and inanimate beings, and is as sensible > in the descent of a rain-drop as in the falls of Niagara; in the weight of > the air, as in the periods of the moon. In Somerville's time the value of scientific publications depended on the currency of the information, therefore frequent editions had to be produced. Her subsequent books reflect the time she could free in her domestic life as her children became more independent but also the need to earn money, as the Somervilles had a number of financial crises that peaked in 1835. As a middle- class woman she publicly and plausibly maintained that she wrote only for pleasure. Privately she paid considerable attention to the profitability of her books. Through personal connections she could secure John Murray as the publisher of her first book Mechanism, and he remained her publisher throughout her long career. Murray later commented that despite him having made little profit he was very pleased to have had the honour of publishing the works of such an extraordinary person. Her second book On the Connexion of the Physical Sciences sold 15,000 copies and established her reputation in elite science. She was among those who discussed a hypothetical planet perturbing Uranus. In the 6th edition of Connexion (1842) she wrote, \\"If after the lapse of years the tables formed from a combination of numerous observations should be still inadequate to represent the motions of Uranus, the discrepancies may reveal the existence, nay, even the mass and orbit of a body placed for ever beyond the sphere of vision\\". Predictions were fulfilled in 1846 by the discovery of Neptune revolving at the distance of 3,000,000,000 miles from the sun. \\"The mass of Neptune, the size and position of his orbit in space, and his periodic time, were determined from his disturbing action on Uranus before the planet itself had been seen.\\" Connexion ran to 10 editions, more than 9,000 copies and was its publisher's most successful science book until The Origin of Species by Charles Darwin in 1859. It was translated into German and Italian and went through various editions in the United States. Alexander Keith Johnston's 1848 The Physical Atlas. Her book Physical Geography was published in 1848 and was the first English textbook on the subject. It remained in use as textbook until the early 20th century. At the time of publication it was financially very successful and brought her the Victoria Gold Medal of the Royal Geographical Society. Somerville followed, as she said, \\"the noble example of Baron Humboldt, the patriarch of physical geography\\", and she took an extended view of geography that included the earth, its animal, \\"vegetable inhabitants\\", as well as \\"the past and present condition of man, the origin, manners, and languages of existing nations, and the monuments of those that have been\\". marine phosphorescence. Physical Geography starts with describing the overall structure of planet earth, and a brief allusion to the location of the earth within the solar system. Subsequently, the book focuses on terrestrial topics, such as the most basic features of land and water, and formations such as mountains, volcanoes, oceans, rivers and lakes. Somerville goes on to discuss the elements that govern temperature, such as light, electricity, storms, the aurora and magnetism. Eventually the book turns to vegetation, birds and mammals, and their geographical distribution on the planet in the Arctic, Europe, Asia, Africa, America and the Antarctic. Somerville ends the book with a discussion of \\"the distribution, condition, and future prospects of the human race\\".< Somerville emphasises the reciprocal dependencies in physical geography and the relationship between human beings and nature. In line with Victorian thinking, Somerville asserts the superiority of human beings, but maintains the interdependencies and interconnectedness of creation. Physical Geography sold more copies than any of her other books and earned Humboldt's admiration. After receiving a copy of the book he wrote to Somerville: \\"You alone could provide your literature with an original cosmological work\\". Her fourth book Molecular and Microscopic Science was published in 1869 and had taken her 10 years to write. But she started to have doubts about her choice to devote herself to popularising science, instead of concentrating on mathematics alone. Of the book she said: \\"In writing this book I made a great mistake, and repent it - Mathematics are the natural bent of my mind. If I had devoted myself exclusively to that study, I might probably have written something useful, as a new era had begun in that science.\\" Regardless, the book was another success. It gave an up-to-date description of the latest discoveries revealed through the microscope and was published in two volumes and three parts. In the first part Somerville explained the latest thinking on atoms and molecules, the second part covered plant life and the third part explored animal life. The book included 180 illustrations, which caused her publisher great expense. She was elected to the American Geographical and Statistical Society in 1857 and the Italian Geographical Society in 1870, and was made a member of the American Philosophical Society. Death Somerville College Library, Oxford From 1833 onwards Somerville and her husband spent most of their time in Italy. Somerville maintained correspondence with a large number of leading scientists and remained engaged in current debates on facts and theories. In 1868, four years before her death aged 91, she was the first person to sign John Stuart Mill's unsuccessful petition for female suffrage. In her autobiography Somerville wrote that \\"British laws are adverse to women\\". She detailed the obstacles she had faced in obtaining an education as a young girl, though she did not speculate on the nature of the problem. During her lifetime the agitation for establishing women's access to higher education had grown. In 1875 the astronomer Maria Mitchell was told by a college president that he \\"would hire a woman scientist if she was as good as Mary Somerville\\". The English Cemetery, Naples. Statue of Mary Somerville is in the background. Somerville died at Naples on 29 November 1872, and was buried there in the English Cemetery.Giancarlo Alisio, Il Cimitero degli Inglesi, Naples, 1993, Legacy In the year following Somerville's death, her autobiographical Personal Recollections was published, consisting of reminiscences written during her old age. Over 10,000 pieces are in the Somerville Collection of the Bodleian Library and Somerville College, Oxford. The collection includes papers relating to her writing and published work, and correspondence with family members, numerous scientists and writers, and other figures in public life. Also included is substantial correspondence with the Byron and Lovelace families. Somerville Square in Burntisland is named after her family and marks the site of their home. Somerville College, Oxford, was named after Somerville, as is Somerville House, Burntisland, where she lived for a time and Somerville House, a high school for girls in Brisbane, Australia. One of the Committee Rooms of the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh has been named after her. Somerville Island (), a small island in Barrow Strait, Nunavut, was named after her by Sir William Edward Parry in 1819. The Somerville Club was founded in 1878 in London, by 1887 it was re-established as the New Somerville Club and had disappeared by 1908. The vessel was launched in 1835 at Liverpool. She traded with India for Taylor, Potter & Co., of Liverpool, and disappeared with the loss of all aboard in late 1852 or early 1853. Somerville Crater Mary Somerville featured in miniature in The English Bijou Almanack, 1837, with poetry by Letitia Elizabeth Landon. 5771 Somerville (1987 ST1) is a main-belt asteroid discovered on 21 September 1987 by E. Bowell at Lowell Observatory Flagstaff, Arizona, and named after her. Somerville crater is a small lunar crater in the eastern part of the Moon. It lies to the east of the prominent crater Langrenus. It is one of a handful of lunar craters named after women. In February 2016 she was shortlisted, along with Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell and civil engineer Thomas Telford, in a public competition run by the Royal Bank of Scotland to decide whose face should appear on the bank's new ¬£10 notes, to be issued in 2017. Later that month RBS announced that she had won the public vote, held on Facebook. The banknotes, bearing her image, were issued in the second half of 2017.The Scotsman dated 11 August 2017. On February 2, 2020, Google celebrated her with a Google Doodle. Children From her first marriage she had a son, Woronzow Greig (1805-1865), named after Count Semyon Vorontsov, the Russian ambassador in London who had appointed Samuel Greig as his Consul General. Woronzow married Agnes Graham but all their children died at birth or in infancy. From her second marriage she had three daughters and one son: Margaret Farquhar Somerville (1813‚Äì1823; died in childhood), Thomas Somerville (1814‚Äì1815; died in infancy), Martha Charters Somerville (1815‚Äì1879) and Mary Charlotte Somerville (1817-1875).

Benjamin Harrison sometime between 2 and 18 December 1775, the first US naval ship to be given that name. She was outfitted in Baltimore from December 1775 to early 1776; and commissioned in December 1775 or January 1776, Capt. William Hallock in command. Wasp set sail from Baltimore on 14 January 1776 in company with and a convoy of ships bound for the Delaware Capes. By virtue of their voyage to meet Commodore Esek Hopkins' squadron at the Delaware Capes, Wasp and Hornet appear to be the first ships of the Continental Navy to get to sea. They joined Hopkins' squadron on 13 February; and, four days later, the first American squadron to put to sea began its maiden voyage. Interpreting his orders rather liberally, by ignoring those portions which related to operations in the Chesapeake Bay and along the southern coast of the colonies, Hopkins led his fleet directly to the Bahamas. The ships, minus Hornet and , arrived at Abaco in the Bahamas on 1 March, and Hopkins began laying plans for the raid on New Providence. The fleet ran in to attempt a landing at the port of Nassau but failed to achieve surprise. The landing, therefore, went forward several miles to the east of the town. Wasp and covered the Marines as they went ashore, but their guns never fired because the landing was not opposed. That afternoon, the landing force took Fort Montague and the following day captured the town of Nassau and Fort Nassau. They took a large quantity of cannon--close to 90 pieces, and 15 brass mortars--but the governor had managed to foil the mission in its primary objective by spiriting away the bulk of the gunpowder which had been stored there. Hopkins had to settle for 24 casks of powder out of the 174 originally stored there. The cannon and other military stores captured, however, more than justified the enterprise. The fleet remained at Nassau for about two weeks loading the booty of war. So large was the take that several local ships had to be pressed into service to carry the materiel back to North America. Hopkins' squadron finally hoisted sail on 17 March and set course for New England. Wasp, however, parted with the main fleet and made her way independently back to the Delaware capes and thence into port at Philadelphia, where she arrived on 4 April. After repairs at Philadelphia, Wasp returned to duty in the Delaware River and Bay. On 5 May, two British men-of-war, the 44-gun and the 28-gun , entered the bay with several prizes. In the face of these two formidable enemies, Wasp retreated into Christiana Creek, but came out again on the 8th to join a force of galleys in attacking Roebuck after she had run aground. During the ensuing engagement, the Continental schooner captured the British brig Betsey and took her into Philadelphia where the British officers were placed in jail. The schooner continued to operate on the Delaware River and Bay and along the nearby Atlantic coast for the remainder of her career. On 28 June, she engaged in the Battle of Turtle Gut Inlet to salvage the cargo of Nancy. Near the end of the year, she took three more prizes--Leghorn Galley late in October, Two Brothers in December, and an unnamed sloop that same month. She also recaptured Success, an American ship previously taken by HMS Roebuck. Into the fall of 1777, Wasp continued her operations in the vicinity of the Delaware Capes until November when she and four other ships unsuccessfully engaged the British force under Admiral Sir Richard (\\"Black Dick\\") Howe. Philadelphia had already fallen to Admiral Howe's brother, General Sir William Howe, late in September, but American forces retained control of the river below the city until losing that engagement. Following the clash, Wasp was run aground, set afire, and destroyed when her gunpowder exploded.

It was the direct successor to the European Carina E and was available as a four-door saloon, five-door liftback and estate. A large MPV called the Avensis Verso (Ipsum in Japan and previously the Picnic in other markets) was built in Japan on a separate platform. The Avensis was not sold in North America, and it is related to the Scion tC coup√©. It also shared a platform with the Allion and Premio and was available at Japanese dealership network Toyota Corolla Store. The Avensis was introduced in 1997, to create a more modern name when compared with the Carina E. The Avensis proved a sales success for Toyota Europe. The \\"Avensis\\" name is derived from the French term avancer, meaning \\"to advance.\\" Avensis also means \\"to carry away\\" in Latin. TOC  First generation (T220; 1997‚Äì2002)  Toyota introduced the Avensis nameplate on its new model, which was launched at the end of 1997. Although an extensive revamp of the previous generation Carina E, the only main common parts were the engines, with an all new style of body. The car was built at the Burnaston factory in Derby. At the same time, production of the five-door Toyota Corolla also started at the British plant. The first generation Avensis had the option of four engines (1.6-, 1.8- and 2.0-litre petrol and a 2.0-litre turbo-diesel) and three body styles (saloon, hatchback and estate). The station wagon was essentially the Japanese-market second generation Toyota Caldina. All of the range gave solid build quality, excellent reliability, a spacious comfortable interior, generous equipment, smooth ride quality and good refinement, but very little in the way of excitement. The first generation Avensis received a facelift in August 2000. The engines were fitted with variable valve timing, satellite navigation was included as a standard feature along the range and the sporty Avensis 2.0 L SR (with body kit and tuned suspension) was added but overall sales remained low. The first generation Avensis was also sold in South America. In Argentina and Brazil, it was sold as the \\"Toyota Corona\\" (as seen on brochures), but in Chile and Peru, it was sold as the \\"Corona Avensis\\". = Engines =  Petrol  *1.6-litre 4A-FE *1.6-litre VVT-i 3ZZ-FE *1.8-litre 7A-FE *1.8-litre VVT-i 1ZZ-FE *2.0-litre 3S-FE *2.0-litre D4 VVT-i 1AZ-FSE  Diesel  *2.0-litre TD 2C-TE *2.0-litre D-4D 1CD-FTV = Avensis Verso = The Avensis Verso was a large MPV introduced in 2001, with room for seven occupants and only initially available with 2.0-litre engines. The Avensis Verso's platform preceded the second generation model. The Avensis Verso was the back-to-back winner of Australia's Best People Mover award in 2002 and 2003.  Second generation (T250; 2003‚Äì2009)  The second generation Avensis was launched in February 2003, in an all new format; this time it offered more in the way of driver involvement and visual appeal. It was launched in Japan in saloon and estate form in October 2003, replacing the V50 series Vista and Vista Ardeo. Like the Echo/Yaris and Corolla, it was penned by the company's design studio in France. Production officially began on 6 January 2003. This was very popular in Europe, a lot are seen in the UK. The 1.6-, 1.8- and 2.0-litre petrol and 2.0-litre turbo-diesel engines were carried over from the previous Avensis, and the 2.4-litre four-cylinder from the Camry was also added to the range. This was the first Avensis to be exported to Japan. Due to the Camry Wagon ending production, the Avensis Wagon is exported to New Zealand, in both 1.8- and 2.0-litre forms. In the United Kingdom, there were no 1.6-litre versions available. In the 2004 European Car of the Year contest, the Avensis came in fourth place behind the; Fiat Panda (Winner), Mazda3 (Second) and the Volkswagen Golf (Third). However, it won the 2004 Semperit Irish Car of the Year. What Car? also awarded the Avensis as the \\"Best Family Car\\" for 2004 and 2005. Following the withdrawal of the Camry in 2004 (2005 in Switzerland), the Avensis became the largest Toyota saloon sold in Europe. Trim levels in the United Kingdom were T2, T3-S, T3-X, T4, T Spirit, T180 and TR. There is also a special edition, based on the T2 called the Colour Collection. In Ireland, there were five trim levels ‚Äì Terra, Aura, Strata, Luna and Sol. The original 115 PS (85 kW) D-4D Diesel engine has been complemented with a 2.2 L D-4D in 136 PS (2AD-FTV) and 177 PS (2AD-FHV) versions. Newer versions have dropped the \\"D-4D\\" and \\"2.0\\" badging from the front wings and tailgate respectively. In Japan, the Avensis is sold as 2.0 Xi, 2.0 Li (later replaced by 2.4 Li) and 2.4 Qi. Only the base model 2.0 Xi is offered with four-wheel drive. In 2003, the Avensis became the first Japanese vehicle to receive a rating under the Euro NCAP's redone testing, with 34 total points it also became the highest rated vehicle they had tested. In 2003, the Avensis also became the first vehicle sold in Europe with a knee airbag. This is first and only generation of Avensis sold in Egypt and Morocco, not in Persian Gulf countries. From 2005, the 2.4 L version was fitted with a 5-speed automatic transmission. The Avensis Verso continued to be available alongside the second generation Avensis until 2006. = Facelift = The facelifted Avensis became available in June 2006. Some changes from the old model are the inclusion of turn signals in the side mirrors, an MP3/WMA/ASL-ready audio system, new front bumper, and a new grille. Interior materials and cloth seats have also been changed for 2006. Its multi display with on-board computer will be integrated in optitron display and is navigation ready. Also added are automatic headlamps and a height-adjustable front passenger seat. The most notable mechanical difference is the addition of a D-4D engine. This, coupled to a six-speed manual gearbox, has lowered fuel consumption, emissions, and gives a quoted 0‚Äì60 mph time of 10.5 seconds. = Engines =  Petrol  *1.6-litre VVT-i 3ZZ-FE (110 bhp) *1.8-litre VVT-i 1ZZ-FE (129 bhp) *2.0-litre VVT-i 1AZ-FSE (147 bhp) *2.4-litre VVT-i 2AZ-FSE (161 bhp)  Diesel  *2.0-litre D-4D 1CD-FTV (116 bhp) *2.0-litre D-4D 1AD-FTV (127 bhp) *2.2-litre D-4D 2AD-FTV (150 bhp) *2.2-litre D-Cat 2AD-FHV (177 bhp)  Third generation (T270; 2009‚Äì2018)  The third generation Avensis was revealed at the 2008 Paris Motor Show. It went on sale in January 2009. Like the previous model, it is built at Toyota's Burnaston plant in Derbyshire, England. This generation is available in sedan or station wagon styles only. Toyota ED2 initially designed the Avensis giving it a more sleek and athletic stance. It has a for the sedan and for the wagon body. Other design goals were to create the most comfortable suspension in its class while still offering sporty handling. The Avensis continued to use front MacPherson struts and rear double wishbones. Unlike the previous generation Avensis models, there is no five door hatchback body style in this lineup, in favour of sedan and wagon body styles. Major options include bi xenon HID headlamps, Adaptive Front-lighting System (AFS), and adaptive cruise control. For safety, seven airbags are standard, including two front row side torso airbags, two side curtain airbags for both rows, and a driver's knee airbag. For rear collisions, active front headrests designed to help reduce whiplash are standard as well as brake lamps that flash under emergency braking. Vehicle Stability Control+ (VSC+) applies torque to the steering wheel to aid the driver in steering. A Pre-Collision System (PCS) becomes optional which includes Lane Departure Warning (LDW) and Lane Keeping Assist (LKA). The Avensis received a five star rating () under the latest Euro NCAP ratings scheme with an 81% overall score and a 90% score for adult occupant safety.Toyota Avensis  Euro NCAP ‚Äì For safer cars crash test safety rating The Avensis wagon began being imported again to Japan in mid-2011, with 2.0-litre 4-cylinder engine and CVT transmission in Li and Xi variants.

On 2 August 2010, it was announced the British Touring Car Championship's NGTC prototype car would be built around the Toyota Avensis. Series organiser TOCA, which would fully introduce the new low-cost NGTC technical regulations in 2011, said that the Japanese manufacturer would supply a donor car and a new body shell to the programme. The Avensis was used by Speedworks Motorsport, driven by Tom Ingram, until the end of the 2018 season. = Discontinuation = The Avensis was discontinued in the United Kingdom in August 2018 and across Europe in late 2018.

It tells the story of a cartoonist who finds himself in the animated world he thinks he created, where he is seduced by one of the characters, a comic strip vamp who wants to be real. Cool World marked Bakshi's return to feature films after nine years. The film was originally pitched as a live- action/animated horror film by Michael Grais and Mark Victor about an underground comic cartoonist who after leaving prison a folk hero for his comic book \\"Cool World\\" is pulled into his creation by the characters he thinks he created but who he discovers exist with or without him. During Preproduction, Grais‚Äô original screenplay in collaboration with Mark Victor written as an R rated film was told by new studio head to change it from an R-rated film to a PG-13 film per studio directive. Bakshi began a rewrite to meet the studio's demand. The film received negative reviews for the story, acting, animation and its unconvincing combination with live-action, though the soundtrack received praise. Bakshi and Mancuso lost three WGAW arbitrations claiming they created the story. Plot In 1945, in Las Vegas, World War II veteran Frank Harris returns to his mother and invites her to a ride on his motorcycle. The two are involved in a traffic collision; Frank's mother dies, while Frank is transported to an animated realm called the \\"Cool World\\". In 1992, cartoonist Jack Deebs is serving a 10-year prison sentence for the murder of a man he had found in bed with his wife. During his sentence, he has visions of the Cool World and the femme fatale Holli Would, who seems to beckon him. Jack spends his sentence creating a series of comics based on his visions. Meanwhile, Frank has become a detective in the Cool World and keeps his eye on Holli to ensure that the two worlds do not intertwine. Shortly after his release from prison, Jack is transported into the Cool World and smuggled into a local nightclub by Holli and her henchmen, the Goons. Frank aggressively confronts Jack, explaining to him that the Cool World has existed long before Jack created the comic series. He also informs Jack that his fountain pen is a lethal weapon in the Cool World, and warns him that sexual intercourse between \\"noids\\" (humans from the real world) and \\"doodles\\" (the inhabitants of Cool World) is forbidden, as this can break the fabric between the two dimensions. Despite this, Frank himself is in love with the doodle Lonette, but limits himself to platonic advances. Holli later seduces Jack and makes love to him, which transforms her into a noid. Holli then secretly steals Jack's pen, which she uses to entrap Frank's partner Nails the Spider when he attempts to stop her. Jack and Holli leave for the real world, where Holli finds herself experiencing real sensations. Due to the damaged interdimensional fabric, Jack and Holli spontaneously flicker in between their doodle and noid forms. While contemplating their situation, Holli tells Jack about the \\"Spike of Power\\", an artifact that was the cause of Frank being transported to Cool World and was placed on the top of the Union Plaza Hotel by a doodle who crossed into the real world, and admits she wants to use it to remain in her noid form permanently. When Jack displays skepticism about the idea, Holli abandons Jack to search for the spike on her own. Frank learns what has happened and goes to the real world, where he teams up with Jack in a bid to stop Holli. They arrive at the casino and climb to the roof, where Holli kills Frank by pushing him off the building and seizes the Spike. A multitude of monstrous doodles begin pouring into the real world and begin turning noids in the city into doodles. The Spike also transforms Jack into an muscular superhero-like doodle, who returns the Spike to its rightful place, sending him, Holli and the invading doodles back to Cool World and restoring the balance between the two dimensions. Nails, having been freed from Jack's pen in the ensuing chaos, brings Frank's body back to Cool World. As Lonette mourns him, she finds out from Nails that Holli was briefly in her doodle form when she killed Frank and explains that when a noid is killed by a doodle, the noid is reborn in Cool World as a doodle. Sure enough, Frank is then revived as a doodle, allowing him to continue his relationship with Lonette. Meanwhile, Jack (who is still in his doodle form) and Holli are last seen as Jack begins planning their new life together, much to Holli's dismay.

According to Bakshi, \\"I made 1,500 bucks in 10 years of painting; I thought it would be nice to pick up a piece of change. So I called my lawyer, who was still speaking to me because no one ever leaves Hollywood, and asked him where I should go to sell a movie.\\" Bakshi heard the original pitch of Cool World by Michael Grais and Mark Victor to Paramount Pictures (where Bakshi had worked as the final head of the studio's animation division) as an animated horror film. The concept of the film involved a cartoonist who created a comic book while in prison that makes him an underground \\"star\\". Bakshi states that Paramount Pictures \\"bought the idea in ten seconds.\\" As the sets were being built in Las Vegas, producer Frank Mancuso Jr., son of Paramount president Frank Mancuso Sr., hired Larry Gross to change the film from R rated to PG-13. Bakshi also contributed to the script, but both their work was uncredited as Michael Grais and Mark Victor's original concept formed the basis of the film. In interviews after the release of the film Bakshi claimed he rewrote the script and was backstabbed by Mancuso with a new screenplay before production began. Paramount threatened Bakshi with a lawsuit if he refused to complete the film. \\"I thought if I did the animation well, it would be worth it, but you know what? It wasn't worth it.\\" Bakshi also stated that he \\"had a lot of animators there that I'd brought in and I thought that maybe I could just have fun animating this stuff, which I did.\\" Bakshi said he had developed the film as a mix of comedy and horror that he described as \\"a hard R-rated story\\" but Paramount wanted a PG-13 film, one of the reasons for the doomed and angry relationship between filmmaker and studio. Bakshi had originally intended to cast Drew Barrymore and Brad Pitt in the film's leading roles. Pitt was cast as Frank Harris instead, with Gabriel Byrne as Deebs and Kim Basinger as Holli. The film's voice cast includes Maurice LaMarche, Charlie Adler and Candi Milo. According to Bakshi, Basinger had attempted to rewrite the film halfway into its production because she \\"thought it would be great [...] if she would be able to show this picture in hospitals to sick children [...] I said, 'Kim, I think that's wonderful, but you've got the wrong guy to do that with.' [...] [Mancuso] was sitting there with Kim [...] agreeing with her.\\" The visual design of the live-action footage was intended to look like \\"a living, walk-through painting,\\" a visual concept Bakshi had long wanted to achieve. The film's sets were based upon enlargements of designer Barry Jackson's paintings. The animation was strongly influenced by Fleischer Studios (whose cartoons were released by Paramount in the 1930s and 1940s) and Terrytoons (where Bakshi once worked, and whose Mighty Mouse character was also adapted into a series by Bakshi). The artwork by the character Jack Deebs was drawn by underground comix artist Spain Rodriguez. The film's animators were never given a screenplay, and were instead told by Bakshi to \\"Do a scene that's funny, whatever you want to do!\\" A soundtrack album, Songs from the Cool World, featuring recordings by My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult, Moby, Ministry, The Future Sound of London, and others, was released in 1992 by Warner Bros. Records. It included the track \\"Real Cool World\\" by David Bowie, his first original solo material in roughly three years; the song was written exclusively for the film. The soundtrack received stronger reviews from critics than the film itself, including a four- star rating from Allmusic. Mark Isham's original score for Cool World, featuring a mixture of jazz, orchestral pieces, and electronic remixes, and performed by the Munich Symphony Orchestra, was released on compact disc by Var√®se Sarabande, and in complete form in 2015 by Quartet. It also received positive reviews, as did the work of John Dickson. Release and reception =Promotion and merchandising= As part of the film's promotion, the Hollywood Sign was altered to include a tall cutout of Holli Would. The alteration angered local residents. In a letter to the city's Recreation and Park Board, commission officials wrote that they were \\"appalled\\" by the board's approval of the alterations: \\"...the action your board has taken is offensive to Los Angeles women and is not within your role as custodian and guardian of the Hollywood sign. The fact that Paramount Pictures donated a mere $27,000 to Rebuild L.A. should not be a passport to exploit women in Los Angeles.\\" Protestors picketed the unveiling of the altered sign. The promotional campaign was focused on the sex appeal of Holli. It was considered by some experts as misaimed. Paramount's marketing president Barry London noted: \\"Cool World unfortunately did not seem to satisfy the younger audience it was aimed at.\\" Designer Milton Knight recalled: \\"Audiences actually wanted a wilder, raunchier Cool World. The premiere audience I saw it with certainly did.\\" Several different licensed video games based on the film were created by Ocean Software. The first game was developed by Twilight and released in 1992 for the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, and DOS. Two different games were released in 1993 for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Super NES, alongside a Game Boy version of the former. A four-issue comic book prequel to the film was published as a miniseries by DC Comics. It featured a script by Michael Eury and art work by Stephen DeStefano, Chuck Fiala, and Bill Wray. =Reception= Cool World opened at sixth on the North American box office, with $5.5 million. Its lifetime gross was US$14.1 million, barely more than half its reported US$28 million budget. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 6% based on 48 reviews, with an average rating of 3.17/10. The consensus reads: \\"Cool World throws a small handful of visual sparks, but they aren't enough to distract from the screenplay's thin characters and scattered plot.\\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 28 based on reviews from 15 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of \\"C\\" on scale of A+ to F. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote: \\"[Cool World] misses one opportunity after another...[it is] a surprisingly incompetent film.\\" Deseret News reviewer Chris Hicks described it as: \\"...a one-joke movie ‚Äì and it's a dirty joke. [...] And much of what's going on here seems more angry and nasty than inspired or funny.\\" Variety reviewer Brian Lowry compared the film to an extended music video, praising the soundtrack and visuals, but panning the story. The Los Angeles Times said: \\"[T]he plot makes almost no sense.\\" Leonard Maltin panned the film: \\"Too serious to be fun, too goofy to take seriously; lead characters unlikable and unappealing. Looks like a Roger Corman version of Roger Rabbit.\\" The Washington Post reviewer Hal Hinson wondered \\"whether Kim Basinger is more obnoxious as a cartoon or as a real person,\\" and felt that the combination of animation and live action was unconvincing. Contributing to the low box office was the fact the studio withdrew all advertising support after the opening weekend. In 1997, John Grant wrote in The Encyclopedia of Fantasy that Cool World \\"stands as one of the fantastic cinema's most significant achievements, an 'Instauration fantasy' that reveals greater depths with each viewing.\\" Animation historian Jerry Beck described the film as being \\"for adults and Bakshi completists only\\", writing that the film \\"has a great premise, a great cast, and the best animation he's ever been involved with\\", but critiquing it as a \\"pointless rehash of many of Ralph's favorite themes, and the story literally goes nowhere\\". The film garnered a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Actress (Kim Basinger; also for Final Analysis).

He is the commander of NERV, a fictional research-and-development and paramilitary organization under the command of the United Nations. While all of the English versions romanize his given name as Gendo, Gainax's website romanizes it Gendoh, and some fansites romanize his name as \\"Gendou\\", which accords with the traditional romanization of the Japanese katakana. Overview In NERV, Gendo is responsible for the research done on the Evangelion Project and the Human Instrumentality Project. He is the father of the Third Child, Shinji Ikari. At the start of the series, only Rei Ayanami reliably interacts with him. Gendo is a brilliant scientist and politician who works diligently for his organization; however, he is an extremely callous person and a cold and distant father towards his son, and has no qualms about using and discarding people to achieve his goals: > \\"Gendo is the type of person who can see & think about the welfare of an > organization as a whole. In other words, he'd do anything to succeed. He > takes drastic and extreme measures, by fair means or foul, or by hook or by > crook, in order to accomplish his own purpose. In some ways he's mean, he > hardly cares about Shinji.\\"from Hideaki Anno's Anime Expo '96 interview, > pp20-3 in the November 1996 Newtype, as translated by Miyako Graham in issue > 43, pages 40-41 of Protoculture Addicts and as quoted by Lawrence Eng His last lines in The End of Evangelion reveal his regret and the true motivations for his ruthless behavior. He intended to use Third Impact to become godlike and create a better future for humanity together with his wife Yui Ikari, whom he intended to rejoin at the conclusion of Instrumentality. However, when Rei defies him he realizes that his efforts are in vain and that he ignored the real wishes of Yui. She intended to bring about a brighter future for their son Shinji, whom Gendo has sacrificed in order to bring her back. In essence, Yui's dreams and principles were violated to resurrect her. He was also afraid that his love for Shinji would instead hurt him and therefore distance himself from him. Shortly after, in the surreal sequence Unit 01 is shown grasping Gendo in its hand before decapitating him. The camera then shows Gendo's lower body still standing with his upper torso severed. In the Rebuild of Evangelion film franchise, his overall role and actions (at least concerning the first film) have remained consistent. Background Born Gendo Rokubungi (ÂÖ≠ÂàÜÂÑÄ, meaning sextant), virtually nothing is known about his childhood or young adulthood. During his study at university, he meets Yui Ikari, with whom he started a relationship. Through Yui, he is introduced to Professor Kozo Fuyutsuki. Fuyutsuki takes a dislike to Gendo, as he carries unspoken romantic feelings for Yui, and he suspects that Gendo has an ulterior motive in pursuing a relationship with her; namely her connections to the shadowy organisation SEELE. Gendo and Yui are married at the beginning of the 21st Century, wherein he changes his surname to Ikari. Late in 2000, Gendo, in company of SEELE's chairman, Keel Lorenz, visits the Katsuragi Expedition on Antarctica to oversee the Adam recovery project. Gendo and his team then leave Antarctica, a few days before Second Impact. In 2001, in the wake of Second Impact, Yui and Gendo's son Shinji is born. In 2003, Gendo and Yui work together at the research organization GEHIRN. Gendo, meanwhile, recruits Fuyutsuki into the organisation. After the failed activation test of Unit 01 and Yui's apparent death during this event, Gendo fundamentally changes as a person. He becomes very cold and abandons Shinji. He goes on to propose a plan to SEELE for achieving Human Instrumentality through Third Impact; but unbeknownst to SEELE, Gendo's plan is really meant to allow him to be reunited with Yui's soul. The only person Gendo lets in on the truth is Fuyutsuki, who, despite his dislike for him, agrees to help him with the plan. Gendo enters into affairs with both Naoko Akagi and, some years later, her daughter Ritsuko, seemingly casting doubt on his commitment to Yui; however, it is implied that Gendo was simply using them to achieve the means to accomplish Third Impact. Shortly afterwards, in secret, Gendo and Fuyutsuki create an imperfect clone of Yui, by combining DNA material from her and the second angel, Lilith, and names her Rei Ayanami. To ensure himself control over Third Impact when the day comes, Gendo puts life into Rei by imbuing her with Lilith's soul, and takes to raising her himself, passing her off as the daughter of a friend, who he is looking after. The day after the development of the revolutionary computer system MAGI is completed, GEHIRN is reorganized to become NERV, of which Gendo becomes Commander. A massive malfunction during the first activation test for Unit 00 causes the Eva to go \\"berserk.\\" To prevent Rei from being seriously injured, the entry plug was ejected, and Gendo pried the plug's superheated door open with his bare hands to extract Rei. His hands have severe scarring because of this and he is never shown without gloves (except in episode 5, when he briefly takes them off; when Shinji sees they are burned, Ritsuko tells him the story). Although Gendo pretends to follow SEELE's orders without question, he has his own agenda and tries to out-manipulate the committee. His final outspoken rebellion towards SEELE comes from his desire to initiate Third Impact under his complete control. He implants Adam's embryo in his hand and tries to merge with Rei to achieve this purpose. In The End of Evangelion, Rei finally defies Gendo forwardly and separates with him (after absorbing Adam) to merge with Lilith and start Instrumentality on her own. Seeing that all his plans to be reunited with Yui have come to nothing, Gendo begs Rei to return to him; she refuses. After Instrumentality is started, Gendo confronts specters of the various Reis as well as Kaworu and Yui herself. Gendo confesses that he is afraid of the \\"invisible bonds\\" formed by those around him, and that he was afraid to confront his son after Yui's death. A vision of Unit 01, with much of its armor missing is seen holding Gendo in much the same manner as Kaworu in Episode 24; the real Unit 01 is at that moment within the Tree of Life, and still fully armored. Gendo states that \\"...this is my retribution\\", and the spectral Unit 01 bites off his torso as he utters his final words: \\"Forgive me, Shinji.\\" The camera then shifts back to Terminal Dogma, where the lower half of Gendo's body is seen, still standing, with his torso severed. Appearances =Manga adaptation= Gendo's role and overall character in the manga is pretty much the same, with only a few differences. Gendo is shown to be even more antagonistic towards Shinji than in the anime, first shown when he calls his son a coward when he refuses to pilot the Eva. Later, while Shinji is recovering, Gendo checks on Rei in the hospital with Shinji watching them and even makes eye contact with him, though other than this he does not acknowledge him. After the battle against Bardiel, where the pilot of Unit 03, Toji is killed, he calls Kaji and tells him to bring Shinji to him. Gendo reads off the list of criminal charges, acquired by Shinji who asks his father if he has nothing to say to him, which Gendo corresponds, causing Shinji to respond by trying to punch him. While held by Kaji, Shinji begins to scream at his father, telling him that he never wants to see him again. Gendo's response to this is the same as in the anime, to have Shinji removed from NERV's records. When Zeruel attacks, after Rei fails to activate Unit 01, he heads down to the cage to try to get the Dummy System to work, which proves to be futile. Gendo, in his first act of distress, frantically asks why Unit 01 (and by extension, Yui) is rejecting him, to which Shinji's picture appears on the screens, genuinely surprising Gendo, which is only furthered by his son's reappearance at the cage. Just as in the anime, SEELE begin to have serious doubts about both Gendo's motives and loyalty after Unit 01 absorbs Zeruel's S¬≤ Engine. This results in them sending Kaworu Nagisa in order to keep an eye on him. During Shinji's time in Evangelion Unit 01, he imagines himself killing Gendo. Afterwards, Gendo once again continues to follow the anime adaption, through his defiances of SEELE, while he continues to further his plan to take control of the Human Instrumentality Project. He later swallows Adam instead having it grafted to his hand. Additionally, Adam later appears on his left hand, not the right. During the Invasion of NERV, he saves Shinji from being killed by JSSDF soldiers by projecting an AT Field from his left hand, which now has Adam embedded within. Gendo also reveals the extent of his madness with his plans to use Third Impact to become God and asks his son to pilot Unit-01 once again to aid in his plans, since after all Shinji has experienced he can now understand Gendo. He covers Shinji and Misato's escape to Unit-01's hangar, certain that Shinji will do as he is told. Like in the anime, Ritsuko tries to stop Gendo but fails due to the Magi system rejecting her command. Gendo shoots Ritsuko fatally and tries to merge with Rei who however, remembering Shinji rejects Gendo by severing his hand instead of his arm and absorbs Adam and merges with Lilith on her own. However, instead of Rei ripping him in half, Ritsuko (Who survived the gunshot) is able to shoot him in the throat. He falls to the ground on his knees shortly after. While he is dying, he is visited by Yui. Gendo asks if this is his punishment for causing Shinji so much pain. Yui explains that Shinji will be the one to decide the future of the world and tells Gendo the reason why they met was to bring Shinji into the world. Yui then explains that she remained inside Eva-01 to protect Shinji, and that Gendo has violated that purpose. Gendo realizes he has really never loved Shinji and Yui asks him to remember the first time he met his son. He then has another vision about the first time he met Shinji and the first time he felt love for his son. He dies finally understanding Yui's intentions. While all the other people on Earth returned to puddles of LCL due to the global Anti A.T. Field, Gendo's corpse alone remained intact as he died. =Rebuild of Evangelion= Gendo's relationship towards his son takes more central focus in Rebuild than in the TV series, with a different story. Unlike in the original series, Gendo is shown to be less antagonistic to his son, willing to spend if a little time with him as per Rei's request. However, this warmer interaction is completely undone by Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo, in which Gendo, who wears a visor that hides his eyes at all times, coldly manipulates Shinji and Kaworu into causing the Fourth Impact. =Shinji Ikari Raising Project= In the manga adaptation of the game, Gendo is shown in a humorous light, much unlike his anime counterpart. His antics, often embarrassing for Shinji, frequently end with him being hit by Yui. During a blackout at NERV, he shined his torch in a scary way, which promptly earned him a smack from Yui. Another time, Gendo is reading a newspaper when Yui asks him if he told Shinji something (like she told Gendo to do). Gendo's response was to sweat and shake nervously and the scene ends with the sound effect of Yui hitting Gendo. Gendo is also shown to be a rather charismatic figure during this time, moving several members of NERV staff (notably all male) to aid with the \\"pedaling for power\\" plan. Also, the perceived \\"father-son rivalry\\" between Gendo and Shinji in Evangelion fandom is parodied here, as both men decided to \\"compete\\" to see who could pedal the fastest. The contest was actually a way to generate electricity for NERV HQ, which had been hit by a blackout. The incident also pays homage to the original anime, where Gendo helps in the manual launching of the EVAs against the invading Angel. Both Fuyutsuki and Rei were shown to put in their share of work before dropping out due to fatigue. Character notes Gendo's last names (Rokubungi and Ikari) mean \\"sextant\\" and \\"anchor\\" in Japanese, respectively; his first name was taken from another anime project prior to Evangelion that was aborted. Yoshiyuki Sadamoto has admitted inspiration from the British television show UFO for the design of Gendo's uniform, specifically that worn by Commander Edward Straker (with Fuyutsuki's based on Col. Alec E. Freeman). Reception Nicolas Demay was disappointed that although Gendo was portrayed as being a \\"normal\\" father in the alternate universe shown in episode 26, that in Angelic Days, Gendo's portrayal returns to that of a \\"heartless taciturn\\" man. Zac Bertschy has described Gendo as being \\"a giant douchebag\\".http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/evangelion-1.0-you-are-not- alone Tim Jones described Gendo as having an \\"'I want to be God' complex\\".

He also served as Vice-President to Paul Kruger from 1881 - 1883. He served in First Boer War, Second Boer War, and the Malaboch War.Potgieter, D.J. et al. (eds) (1970). Standard Encyclopaedia of Southern Africa, Cape Town: NASOU, v. 7. Early life Joubert was born in the district of Prince Albert, British Cape Colony, a descendant of a French Huguenot who fled to South Africa soon after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes by Louis XIV. Left an orphan at an early age, Joubert migrated to the Transvaal, where he settled in the Wakkerstroom district near Laing's Nek and the north-east corner of the Colony of Natal. There he not only farmed with great success, but turned his attention to the study of the law. Political career The esteem in which his shrewdness in both farming and legal affairs was held led to his election to the Volksraad as member for Wakkerstroom early in the sixties, Marthinus Pretorius being then in his second term of office as president. In 1870 Joubert was again elected, and the use to which he put his slender stock of legal knowledge secured him the appointment of attorney- general of the republic, while in 1875 he acted as president during the absence of T. F. Burgers in Europe. First Boer War During the first British annexation of the Transvaal, Joubert earned for himself the reputation of a consistent irreconcilable by refusing to hold office under the government, as Paul Kruger and other prominent Boers were doing. Instead of accepting the lucrative post offered him, he took a leading part in creating and directing the agitation which led to the First Boer War (1880‚Äì1881), eventually becoming, as commandant-general of the Boer forces, a member of the triumvirate that administered the provisional Boer government set up in December 1880 at Heidelberg. He was in command of the Boer forces at Laings Nek, Ingogo, and Majuba Hill, subsequently conducting the earlier peace negotiations that led to the conclusion of the Pretoria Convention. Later political career In 1883 he was a candidate in the Transvaal presidential election, but received only 1,171 votes as against 3,431 cast for Kruger. After losing to Kruger again in the 1888 elections, he ran against Kruger for a third time in the 1893 elections, standing as the representative of the comparatively progressive section of the Boers, who wished in some measure to redress the grievances of the Uitlander population which had grown up on the Rand. The poll (though there is good reason for believing that the voting lists had been manipulated by Kruger's agents) was declared to have resulted in 7911 votes being cast for Kruger and 7246 for Joubert. After a protest Joubert acquiesced to Kruger's continued presidency. He stood again in 1898, but the Jameson raid had occurred meantime and the voting was 12,858 for Kruger and 2,001 for Joubert. Joubert's position had then become much weakened by accusations of treachery and of sympathy with the Uitlander agitation. He was a South African Freemason. He was appointed twice as the Vice President on Kruger, first time from May 1883 until the elections of 1888, and second time after the death of Nicolaas Smit from May 1896 until his death 28 March 1900.http://hdl.handle.net/10394/14081 Die ontstaan en ontwikkeling van die amp van die staatspresident in die Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek, 1858-1902, \\"Du Plessis_JS_Chapter11.pdf\\" (2.125Mb) Second Boer War He took little part in the negotiations that culminated in the ultimatum sent to Great Britain by Kruger in 1899, and though he immediately assumed nominal command of the operations on the outbreak of hostilities, he gave up to others the chief share in the direction of the war, through his inability or neglect to impose upon them his own will. His cautious nature, which had in early life gained him the sobriquet of Slim Piet (Clever Piet), joined to a lack of determination and assertiveness that characterized his whole career, led him to act mainly on the defensive; and the strategically offensive movements of the Boer forces, such as Elandslaagte and Willow Grange, appear to have been neither planned nor executed by him. =Death= On 28 November 1899, during a raid south of the Tugela river in Natal, Joubert was thrown from his horse and suffered internal injuries.Pakenham 1979, p.174 As the war went on, physical weakness led to Joubert's virtual retirement, and, though two days earlier he was still reported as being in supreme command, he died at Pretoria from peritonitis on 28 March 1900. Sir George White, the defender of Ladysmith, summed up Jouberts character when he called him \\"a soldier and a gentleman, and a brave and honourable opponent\\". Honours The town of Pietersburg (now named Polokwane) in the northern region of the then Transvaal Republic (current Limpopo province) was named after Piet Joubert. Rudyard Kipling wrote a poem upon his death, Piet Joubert, wherein he absolved him from complicity in instigating the war, and held his colleagues to account (excerpt): The poem was first published in The Friend in Bloemfontein, 30 March 1900, under the title \\"The Death of General Joubert\\". > With those that bred, with those that loosed the strife, He had no part > whose hands were clear of gain; But subtle, strong, and stubborn, gave his > life To a lost cause, and knew the gift was vain.

Ricardians are people interested in altering the posthumous reputation of King Richard III of England (reigned 1483‚Äì1485). Richard III has long been portrayed unfavourably, most notably in William Shakespeare's play Richard III, in which Richard is portrayed as having murdered his 12-year-old nephew Edward V in order to secure the English throne for himself. Ricardians have worked in an effort to turn this around and to paint this portrayal, and the many other related assertions that followed, as most probably false politically-motivated accusations. Ricardians accept as facts: that first the young king Edward V was placed under the protection of his uncle Richard III; that Richard III himself was then crowned as the new king instead of young Edward V; and finally that the young king disappeared at some point over the coming year, never to be seen again. However, they dispute the initial common assumption by many, that Richard III was personally responsible for the apparent murder of Edward V. Richard III's reign lasted for only 2 years, and his short reign came to a violent end on 22 August 1485 at the Battle of Bosworth ‚Äì the last battle of the War of the Roses. In the aftermath of the battle, Richard III's body was not given a proper state funeral, and the location of his remains was soon forgotten ‚Äì there was even a belief, now proved false, that they had been thrown into the River Soar in Leicester following the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Ricardians assert that many of the original assumptions about Richard III's motives and likely responsibility relating to these events were not supported by the actual facts of the day, that these assumptions were most probably instead the result of the political claims of his successors, and that they were most probably in fact mistaken assumptions. The two most notable societies of Ricardians are the Richard III Society, and the Richard III Foundation, Inc. A third much smaller Ricardian organisation, composed of \\"collateral descendants\\" of Richard III, is the Plantagenet Alliance. In 2012 the Richard III Society was instrumental in leading an archaeological effort to positively locate and identify the long-lost remains of Richard III, which resulted in the discovery and retrieval of the remains from beneath a Leicester car park. Subsequently, much popular historical interest was generated in this historical period. Such historical interest resulted in the review and publication of many articles and documents regarding Richard's reign, which have contributed to the scholarship of latter 15th-century England. After their discovery, Richard III's remains were first scientifically evaluated, then formally re-interred within the interior of Leicester Cathedral on 26 March 2015. Their re-interment occurred amidst days of solemn ceremonies and pageantry.Richard III burial: five centuries on, the last medieval king finall gains honour in death The Telegraph. By Tom Rowley. 23 Mar 2015. Downloaded 24 Sep, 2017. History Ricardian historiography includes works by Horace Walpole and by Sir George Buck, who was the king's first defender, after the Tudor period. Ricardian fiction includes Josephine Tey's The Daughter of Time and Sharon Kay Penman's The Sunne in Splendour. Elizabeth George writes of the fictional discovery of an exonerating document in her short story \\"I Richard\\". Science Fiction writer Andre Norton, in the 1965 novel Quest Crosstime, depicted an alternate history in which Richard III won at Bosworth and turned out to be one of England's greatest kings, \\"achieving the brilliance of the Elizabethan era two generations earlier\\". Richard III Society The arms of the society, granted in 1989 http://www.richardiii.net/8_6_badges.php The Richard III Society was founded in 1924 by Liverpool surgeon S. Saxon Barton as The Fellowship of the White Boar, Richard's badge and a symbol of the Yorkist army in the Wars of the Roses. Its membership was originally a small group of interested amateur historians whose aim was to bring about a re-assessment of the reputation of Richard III. The society became moribund during the Second World War. In 1951 Josephine Tey published her detective novel The Daughter of Time, in which Richard's guilt is examined and doubted. In 1955, Laurence Olivier released his film of Shakespeare's Richard III, which at the beginning admitted that the play was based on legend, and a sympathetic, detailed biography of Richard was published by Paul Murray Kendall, all of which went some way towards re- invigorating the society. The Fellowship of the White Boar was renamed The Richard III Society in 1959. In 1980, Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester, became the society's Patron. (Richard III was Duke of Gloucester before ascending the throne, therefore he was before his accession (Prince) Richard, Duke of Gloucester). In 1986 the society established the Richard III and Yorkist History Trust, a registered charity, to advance research and publication related to the history of late medieval England. The society publishes a scholarly journal, The Ricardian.ISSN 0048-8267 =Rediscovery of Richard III= In 2012 the society, working in partnership with the University of Leicester and Leicester City Council, exhumed a skeleton at the site of the former Greyfriars Church that was later confirmed to be that of the King. Philippa Langley, the secretary of the Scottish Branch of the Richard III Society, inaugurated the quest for King Richard's lost grave as part of her ongoing research into the controversial monarch. Her project marked the first- ever search for the grave of an anointed King of England, and in 2013 was made into an acclaimed TV documentary Richard III: King In A Car Park by Darlow Smithson Productions for Channel 4. Philippa Langley and Dr John Ashdown-Hill were awarded the MBE in recognition of their services to \\"the Exhumation and Identification of Richard III\\" (London Gazette) in the 2015 Queen's Birthday Honours. The Richard III Foundation, Inc. The Foundation is a non-for- profit ¬ß501(c)(3) educational organization. The aims of the Foundation are to study, share and stimulate interest in the life and times of King Richard III and the Wars of the Roses. The Richard III Foundation, Inc. is the only Ricardian organization which directly asserts that its aim is to vindicate Richard. Its website states, \\"The Foundation seeks to challenge the popular view of King Richard III by demonstrating through rigorous scholarship that the facts of Richard‚Äôs life and reign are in stark contrast to the Shakespearian caricature.\\"Richard III Foundation . The Foundation provides a focal point for people who share a fascination with this dynamic period in history. Through continuous research, their work is to identify and translate documents and texts that shed new insight into this important period of history. Plantagenet Alliance The Plantagenet Alliance is a grouping of 15 individuals who claim to be \\"collateral [non-direct] descendants\\" of Richard III, and have been described as a \\"Ricardian fan club\\". The group, formed for the purpose, unsuccessfully campaigned during 2013 and 2014 to have Richard re-interred at York Minster rather than Leicester Cathedral, believing that that was his wish. During the campaign, the group failed to attract enough support to petition parliament.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-york- north-yorkshire-24230823 References External links * Richard III Society * Society of Friends of King Richard III * Richard III Foundation * Ricardian Friends * Richard III & Yorkist History Trust website History organisations based in the United Kingdom Richard III of England Wars of the Roses ","title":"Ricardian (Richard III)"},{"id":"600209","title":"Kalifornia"},{"id":"600210","text":"The Otonabee River is a river in Peterborough County in Central Ontario, Canada. The river flows from Katchewanooka Lake, at the north end of the community of Lakefield, through the city of Peterborough to Rice Lake. It is in the Great Lakes Basin and forms part of the Trent-Severn Waterway. Etymology The river is called Odoonabii-ziibi in the Ojibwe language. Otonabee comes from the words ode which means \\"heart\\" and odemgat that comes from \\"boiling water\\". It translates into \\"the river that beats like a heart in reference to the bubbling and boiling water of the rapids along the river\\". Course The river begins at Katchewanooka Lake on the north side of the community of Lakefield in the municipality of Selwyn, and flows south over the Lakefield (Trent-Severn lock 6) dams and locks. After leaving the community to the Peterborough city limits, the river forms the border between Selwyn and the municipality of Douro‚ÄìDummer. The river continues south, passing through the dams associated with four more locks, enters the city of Peterborough, and passes under Faryon Bridge at Trent University. Just south of the university, the Trent-Severn departs via a south-bound canal to the Peterborough Lift Lock east of the river, while the river continues south to the west. It passes over several hydroelectricity dams and generating stations, and passes into the centre of the city of Peterborough, as close as to downtown, as it reaches Little Lake. The Trent-Severn waterway rejoins the river there, exiting from Ashburnham Lock. The river leaves Little Lake at Scotts Mills lock & dam, and heads south, passes under Ontario Highway 7, passes into the municipality of Otonabee‚ÄìSouth Monaghan, and snakes its way without any other locks or dams to reach its mouth at Rice Lake, which flows via the Trent River to Lake Ontario. The total length of the river is , and the distance from Little Lake to Rice Lake about . The drainage basin, not including Katchewanooka Lake or other lakes further upstream, is . Hydrology Some areas of Peterborough along the Otonabee are prone to flooding following heavy rains, such as happened on July 15, 2004 when 240 mm (7.3 in) fell in some locations in under twenty-four hours.

Gifford Causeway. =Tri-lake water system= Chemong Lake is part of a tri-lake water system consisting of Chemong Lake, Buckhorn Lake, and Pigeon Lake. The tri-lake area is host to several popular fishing tournaments throughout the open fishing season. The most common game fish in the lake are smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, walleye, yellow perch, Carp, Muskellunge as well as a number of Panfish. Commercial and recreational fishing has caused the introduction of Zebra mussels, which change the ecosystem by filtering the water and making it clearer. Some fish, such as Walleye, dislike the clear water and have become less abundant. =Lake islands= There are a number of small islands on the lake, including Big Island, Goat Island and Kelly Island. Most of the islands have cottages or are commonly used as impromptu campsites. Rocky shoals surround these islands - boaters should approach with care. Name history The earliest map, from 1790, called the lake \\"Wubscommoug\\", which was also spelled \\"Wabuskummug\\", an Ojibwa word meaning \\"place of clay earth\\" or mud. Over the next century the name went through many changes and spelling variations, such as Shebaugh-tick-wyong/Shebaugh-tick-wayong East Lake (1816), Cimung/Cheemaun/Chemong/Shemong, and Cicibatigweyong. In the 19th century, Mud Lake was the official name, referring to the clay mud bottom of the lake. By 1902, the name Chemung Lake became the common name, and on October 14, 1965, this became the official name. Despite the official designation, it was often spelled with an \\"o\\" instead of an \\"u\\". But in 1978, Chemung Lake was officially changed to Chemong Lake by the Ontario Geographic Names Board. The lake was called Chemong, which is an Ojibwa word meaning \\"canoe\\", because when Europeans first approached the aboriginal village by canoe, the locals would shout \\"Chemong, Chemong\\".

Thomas Lord Cromwell is an Elizabethan history play, depicting the life of Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex, the minister of King Henry VIII of England. The play was entered into the Stationers' Register on 11 August 1602 by William Cotton and was published in quarto later the same year by bookseller William Jones, for whom it was printed by Richard Read. The title page of Q1 specifies that the play was acted by The Lord Chamberlain's Men, and attributes the play to a \\"W. S.\\" A second quarto (Q2) was printed in 1613 by Thomas Snodham. The Q2 title page repeats the data of Q1, though the Lord Chamberlain's Men are now the King's Men (the name change having occurred in 1603). The \\"W. S.\\" of the quartos was first identified as William Shakespeare when publisher Philip Chetwinde added the play to the second impression of his Shakespeare Third Folio in 1664. Modern scholars reject the Shakespearean attribution; speculation, relying on common initials, has shone on Wentworth Smith and William Sly as possible alternatives. Individual critics have also suggested Thomas Heywood and Michael Drayton as possible authors‚Äîsuggestions unsupported by firm evidence. Indeed, scholars have disagreed about almost every aspect of the play; it has been dated as early as 1582‚Äì83 and as late as 1599‚Äì1600. The play is primarily political commentary‚Äîor religious propaganda. Baldwin Maxwell argued that the play has a discontinuous nature: the first half, through Act III scene ii, is dramaturgically well-crafted, while the second half is disorganized and loosely put together. Maxwell interpreted this as indicating that the extant text was the telescoped condensation of a two-part original; alternatively, others have suggested that the play is a collaboration between two unequal partners, or a work that was left incomplete by its original creator and finished by another hand.Logan and Smith, pp. 189‚Äì193.

The film was written by Dana Olsen, who also has a cameo in the movie. The film pokes fun at suburban environments and their sometimes eccentric dwellers. Plot Ray Peterson is home on a week-long vacation. Late one night, he hears strange noises emanating from the basement of his new and rather odd neighbors, the Klopeks. Eventually, Ray, and his neighbors Art Weingartner and Vietnam veteran Mark Rumsfield gradually suspect the Klopeks may be ritualistic murderers. On another night, Ray, Art, and Rumsfield observe the youngest Klopek carting an over-sized garbage bag from the garage to the curbside garbage can, where he aggressively mashes it down with a hoe. Ray has also seen the Klopeks digging in their back yard during a rainstorm. The following morning, Ray, Rumsfield, and Art search the garbage truck for human remains after the Klopeks' trash can is collected, but find nothing. Rumsfield's wife, Bonnie, finds their neighbor Walter's dog running loose. Worried about the elderly man, Ray, Art, Mark, and Bonnie, along with Ricky Butler, a teen neighbor whose parents are away, go to Walter's house. Inside, they find overturned kitchen chairs and Walter's toupee, but no Walter. Ray collects the dog and leaves a note in case Walter returns. That night, Ray and Art theorize about Walter's mysterious disappearance, believing the Klopeks may have used him as a human sacrifice. When Ray's dog brings home what looks like a human femur bone, they are further convinced. Ray's wife, Carol, tired of her husband's and his buddies' behavior, organizes a welcome visit the Klopeks. Carol, Ray, Rumsfield, and Bonnie meet Hans, Reuben, and Werner Klopek. Meanwhile, Art snoops around the Klopek's backyard. After, Ray reveals to Art and Rumsfield that he found Walter's mail and his toupee at the Klopeks‚Äô, proving the Klopeks were inside Walter's house. The trio agree to search for Walter's body in the Klopeks' backyard while they are away the following day. Ray sends Carol and their son, Dave, to visit Carol's sister, freeing Ray and his buddies to explore the Klopeks' residence. Art and Ray dig for Walter's remains in the backyard, while Rumsfield stands guard. When nothing incriminating is found, Ray and Art break into the basement and discover what appears to be a crematorium. The Klopeks return home, accompanied by the police after having seen the lights on in their basement. Art goes to fetch Ray, who, digging into the basement's earthen floor, discovers what he believes is a buried crypt. He realizes too late his pick-ax has struck a gas line. Art escapes before the house explodes with Ray still inside. A disheveled and scorched Ray emerges from the flames just as Carol returns home. Walter arrives home during the commotion. He has been in the hospital and had asked the Klopeks to collect his mail while he was away. After Ray had earlier slipped Walter's toupee into the mail slot after absentmindedly putting it into his pocket, it was mistakenly gathered up with the mail. That is why it was in the Klopek's house. Ray declares he and the others were wrong about the Klopeks before climbing into the ambulance to go to the hospital. Werner Klopek enters the ambulance. Ray apologizes to him, but Werner accuses Ray of having seen the human skull in the basement furnace. He reveals they murdered the previous owners, confirming everyone's suspicions. Werner attempts to lethally inject Ray as Hans drives the ambulance away. As Ray and Werner struggle, the vehicle crashes into the Weingartners' house, ejecting both Werner and Ray, who then makes a citizen's arrest. Ricky uncovers human skeletal remains in the Klopeks' car trunk. The Klopeks are arrested and charges against Ray are dropped. Ray tells Ricky that he and his family are going away for awhile and tells him to watch over the neighborhood. Cast Production Screenwriter Dana Olsen based the script, under the working title Life in the 'Burbs, on experiences from his own childhood: \\"I had an ultranormal middle-class upbringing, but our town had its share of psychos. There was a legendary hatchet murder in the thirties, and every once in a while, you'd pick up the local paper and read something like 'LIBRARIAN KILLS FAMILY, SELF'. As a kid, it was fascinating to think that Mr. Flanagan down the street could turn out to be Jack the Ripper. And where there's fear, there's comedy. So I approached The 'Burbs as Ozzie and Harriet Meet Charles Manson.\\" Olsen's script attracted producer Larry Brezner, who brought it to Imagine Films. It was greeted with a warm reception from Brian Grazer. \\"I liked the concept of a regular guy taking a vacation in his own neighborhood, plus it was funny and well written. It suddenly dawned on me that Joe Dante would be fantastic [as a director] because it's a mixture of comedy, horror, and reality.\\" Dante, the director of Gremlins and Innerspace, and his partner, Michael Finnell, were immediately impressed by the concept of the movie. Dante, who specializes in offbeat subject matters, was intrigued by the blending of real-life situations with elements of the supernatural. \\"When I tell people about the story, a remarkable number say, 'On my grandmother's block, there were people like that. They never mowed their lawn, and they never came out, and they let their mail stack up, and nobody knew who they were'. And I must confess that in my own neighborhood there's a house like that, falling to wrack and ruin. I think this is perhaps a more common event than most people are aware of.\\" Dante, Brezner and Finnell agreed that Tom Hanks would be the most suitable actor to portray the harried Ray Peterson, a conservative man who tries to introduce excitement into his life by investigating the activities of his strange neighbors. Dante referred to Hanks as \\"the reigning everyman, a guy that everybody can identify with\\", comparing Hanks with James Stewart. Brezner echoed the sentiments, saying, \\"Hanks is an actor capable of acting funny rather than funny acting. He also has no problem with transition from comedy to Pathos, as he showed in Nothing in Common, and he's now proving himself as one of the country's most versatile actors.\\" Hanks accepted the role of Ray with enthusiasm. \\"What's so bizarrely interesting about this black psychocomedy is that the stuff that goes on in real life in a regular neighborhood will make your hair stand up on the back of your neck.\\" He was also intrigued by his character with distinctive personality traits. \\"Sometimes there's more of an opportunity to create than others. Here's a guy with a great life ‚Äì a nice house, a wife, a beautiful tree, a nice neighborhood ‚Äì and he's happy. Next day, he hates it all. I thought something must've happened to him offstage. And that's the challenge for me of the part: to communicate Ray's offscreen dilemma. One of the reasons Ray doesn't go away on vacation is because it's another extension of the normalcy he's fallen into. So he thinks he'll try a more Bohemian thing, which is to just hang around the house. With a week's worth of free time on his hands, Ray is drawn into the pre-occupations of his neighbors, who always seem to be at home. But what I did is just back-story embellishment that any actor will do. Perhaps from my repertory experience. I don't ask a director for motivation. If he says, 'Go over to the window', I find the reason myself.\\" Hanks found admiration for Dante's directorial style, saying \\"Joe has a stylized, visionary way of looking at the entire movie. It's pure film-making ‚Äì the story is told from the camera's point of view, and that's a type of movie I haven't made.\\" Dante, in turn, praised his star. \\"The most impressive thing about Tom Hanks as a comic actor is how effortless he makes it seem. He actually is very diligent about his acting, but his comic sense of what is going to work ‚Äì and what isn't ‚Äì is really unparalleled.\\" The ten-week shoot took place during the summer of 1988, with Dante directing Hanks and the high- profile supporting cast. Dante's laid-back, casual style encouraged improvisation among the actors. He noted, \\"Tom doesn't like to do scenes the way they're always done. He goes out of his way to put a different spin on everything and his being good as he is and as open as he is encouraged the other actors to do the same. It set a tone for the movie that made it a lot of fun to make.\\" =The set= The entire movie takes place on Mayfield Place Filmed entirely at Universal Studios, The 'Burbs presented technical and logistical problems for Dante and the crew. \\"I can't think of many pictures since Lifeboat that all take place in the same area,\\" Dante said as production got under way. \\"There was a lot of temptation to broaden it and go outside the neighborhood, but it seemed to violate the spirit of the piece. It's almost the kind of thing that could be a stage play except that you could never do on-stage what we've done in this movie.\\" Dante used the Colonial Street set on the back lot for the Mayfield Place cul-de-sac. The set had once been used in 1987's Dragnet, also starring Tom Hanks. (Coincidentally, the structure used as the Peterson home in The 'Burbs was used as the home of the character of \\"the virgin Connie Swail\\" in Dragnet.) At the time The 'Burbs began production the Colonial Street set was being used as the location for The New Leave It to Beaver television series ‚Äì the 1980s follow-up to Leave It to Beaver, so the entire area 'reeked' of normalcy. Dante said, \\"I asked [production designer] James Spencer, a veteran of Poltergeist and Gremlins if he thought he could turn that street into the neighborhood we needed in that period of time. Spencer rose to the challenge, and within a few days they began work on sketching out the proposed designs for the sets. Spencer observed, \\"We had to be on the spot. Due to the lack of time, it would have been ludicrous to do our drawing elsewhere.\\" The sacred Beaver household had to be carted away to make room for the dilapidated Klopek home. By the time Spencer was through, the entire street had been reconfigured. The Klopeks' house was not completely destroyed, and remained almost intact as it appeared in The 'Burbs for a number of years, albeit without the tower. The whole building is visible in a season-two episode of Quantum Leap. The house no longer exists in an easily recognizable form (the Van de Kamp house in Desperate Housewives) but the right fa√ßade does still have some features of the original style. The original Klopek garage sits alongside the house, in much the same style as in The 'Burbs. The other houses (many of which are just fa√ßades) have been used in countless television shows, movies and music videos through the years. Perhaps the most notable is The Munsters house, which is home to the Butler family in The 'Burbs. Due to its recognizability, the house's facade is never completely shown in the film. Two new houses, which were built specifically for the movie, were Walter Seznick's (which is still there to this day) and the Klopeks'. The Munsters House was also used as the Granny Munday home in Dragnet. Connie Swail‚Äôs home in Dragnet was Art‚Äôs house. The Rumsfield and Peterson Houses were also used in Deep Impact.

Overall, in the US, the film made $36,601,993 and $49,101,993 worldwide. =Critical reaction= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 53% based on 38 reviews, with an average rating of 5.98/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"The 'Burbs has an engaging premise, likable cast, and Joe Dante at the helm ‚Äì so the mixed-up genre exercise they produce can't help but feel like a disappointment.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 45 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Vincent Canby of The New York Times said the film is \\"as empty as something can be without creating a vacuum\\".\\"Reviews/Film; Suspicious Goings-On Next Door\\" - New York Times, February 17, 1989. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun- Times gave the film two out of four stars and wrote: \\"The 'Burbs tries to position itself somewhere between Beetlejuice and The Twilight Zone, but it lacks the dementia of the first and the wicked intelligence of the second and turns instead into a long shaggy dog story.\\" =Home media= The first DVD release of The 'Burbs was Region 1, which contains English and French language. This release includes an alternative ending in which Werner Klopek attempts to kill Ray but is caught in the act by Rumsfield and Carol. While being arrested, he gives a satirical monologue about why he moved to the suburbs. This was followed in 2004 by the European/Australian Region 2/4 release entitled The 'Burbs Uncut. The 'uncut' in the title refers only to scenes removed from the TV versions which are present on the DVD; there is nothing additional from the theatrical release. However, for the first time, the UK release included the clips from the three films watched by Ray on his TV (namely Race with the Devil, The Exorcist and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2), which had previously been cut by the BBFC from the original theatrical and VHS versions. Arrow Video released The 'Burbs on Blu-ray in 2014 in the UK with a new 2K scan of the inter-positive. The edition included a commentary by screenwriter Dana Olsen, a newly commissioned feature-length documentary titled There Goes the Neighborhood: The Making of The Burbs, and a work print with temp music and deleted scenes provided by Joe Dante himself (who also helped in the restoration of the film). The deleted scenes included, among other things, a Kevin McCarthy cameo, a dropped subplot about Ray's job problems and different versions of some scenes. In the US, the film was first given a Blu-ray release in 2016 by Universal Studios. However, this release was criticized for poor quality and being a bare bones release. But in 2018, Shout! Factory re-released the film on Blu-ray with the transfer and majority of the special features from the 2014 Arrow release from the UK. Music =Soundtrack= The orchestral soundtrack was composed by Jerry Goldsmith and includes references to his Patton tune for the Rumsfield character. Joe Dante used Ennio Morricone's \\"Se Sei Qualcuno √® Colpa Mia\\", from My Name Is Nobody, as a temp track for the scene in which Ray and Art walk up to the Klopeks' house instead of using the cue Goldsmith composed for that scene (\\"Let's Go\\"). # \\"Main Title\\" ‚Äì 2:23 # \\"Welcome to Mayfield Place\\" ‚Äì 2:20 # \\"New Neighbors\\" ‚Äì 2:06 # \\"Klopek House\\" ‚Äì 2:02 # \\"Storytelling\\" ‚Äì 3:20 # \\"Neighborhood Watch\\" ‚Äì 2:01 # \\"A Nightmare in the 'Burbs\\" ‚Äì 2:30 # \\"Brownies?\\" ‚Äì 0:47 # \\"The Assault\\" ‚Äì 2:36 # \\"Ray Peterson, Neighbor from Hell\\" ‚Äì 1:43 # \\"Runaway Ambulance\\" ‚Äì 2:24 # \\"Vacation's End\\" ‚Äì 2:12 # \\"End Titles\\" ‚Äì 4:10 Total duration: 30:34 Deluxe edition, also by Var√®se Sarabande: # \\"Night Work\\" (Main Title) ‚Äì 2:38 # \\"The Window / Home Delivery\\" ‚Äì 2:22 # \\"The Raven\\" ‚Äì 0:51 # \\"Nocturnal Feeders\\" ‚Äì 0:27 # \\"Good Neighbors\\" ‚Äì 2:06 # \\"Let's Go\\" ‚Äì 2:04 # \\"Bad Karma\\" ‚Äì 0:38 # \\"The Sentinel\\" ‚Äì 3:22 # \\"My Neighborhood\\" ‚Äì 2:04 # \\"The Garage\\" ‚Äì 4:24 # \\"Spare Key\\" ‚Äì 1:19 # \\"The Note\\" ‚Äì 1:00 # \\"Devil Worship\\" ‚Äì 1:12 # \\"The Dream\\" ‚Äì 2:34 # \\"The Note #2\\" ‚Äì 1:28 # \\"This is Walter\\" ‚Äì 2:00 # \\"Snooping Around\\" ‚Äì 0:50 # \\"I'm O.K.\\" ‚Äì 1:02 # \\"Ask Him\\" ‚Äì 1:24 # \\"What's in the Cellar?\\" ‚Äì 1:00 # \\"The Wig\\" ‚Äì 2:23 # \\"Hot Wires\\" ‚Äì 2:39 # \\"Red Rover, Red Rover\\" ‚Äì 1:11 # \\"No Beer\\" ‚Äì 3:07 # \\"Home Furnace\\" ‚Äì 1:44 # \\"No Lights\\" ‚Äì 0:48 # \\"Walter's Home\\" ‚Äì 1:58 # \\"Something is Moving\\" ‚Äì 1:46 # \\"There's a Body\\" ‚Äì 1:04 # \\"My Skull / The Gurney\\" ‚Äì 2:24 # \\"The Trunk\\" ‚Äì 1:41 # \\"Pack Your Bags\\" ‚Äì 2:15 # \\"Square One\\" (End Credits) ‚Äì 4:14 The insert of the 2007 album includes a note from Var√®se producer Robert Townson: The soundtrack was released in 2018 on vinyl for the first time by Waxwork Records.

It was first performed in 1622 at the Curtain Theatre in Shoreditch.N.W. Bawcutt, The Control and Censorship of Caroline Drama, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1996. It contains a comic depiction of the birth of the fully grown Merlin to a country girl, and also features figures from Arthurian legend, including Uther Pendragon, Vortigern, and Aurelius Ambrosius. Authorship The 1662 first edition, a quarto printed by Thomas Johnson for the booksellers Francis Kirkman and Henry Marsh, attributed the play to William Shakespeare and William Rowley. The Birth of Merlin is thus one of two plays published in the seventeenth century as a Shakespearean collaboration, the other being The Two Noble Kinsmen. Most scholars reject the attribution to Shakespeare and believe that the play is Rowley's, perhaps with a different collaborator. The play has occasionally been revived in the modern era, for example at Theatr Clwyd. The Birth of Merlin shares a significant relationship with Cupid's Revenge, a play in the Beaumont and Fletcher canon. Large-scale resemblances in plotting‚Äîthe missing prince, the ruler and his heir who fall in love with the same woman‚Äîcould be explained through derivation from common sources; but these larger-scale elements are supported by specific lines and passages that occur in both plays. Compare, for example, \\"Wilde-fire and Brimstone eat thee!\\" in Merlin, III,vi,108, with \\"wild-fire and brimstone take thee\\" in Cupid's Revenge, V,ii, 49. Other common passages occur in Merlin, II,ii,35‚Äì39 and 72‚Äì81 and III,vi,83‚Äì84, and Cupid's Revenge, I,v,5‚Äì11, IV,i,2‚Äì7, and V,ii,44‚Äì48.Act/scene division and lineation can vary among editions; these citations refer to the text of Merlin in The Shakespeare Apocrypha, edited by C. F. Tucker Brooke, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1908, and to the text of Cupid's Revenge in The Dramatic Works in The Beaumont and Fletcher Canon, Vol. 2, general editor Fredson Bowers, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1970. The early critics who first discovered these commonalities took them as evidence that Beaumont and Fletcher had a hand in the authorship of The Birth of Merlin.E. H. C. Oliphant, The Plays of Beaumont and Fletcher, New Haven, Yale University Press, 1927; pp. 402‚Äì14. This view, however, has not been accepted by the consensus of scholars and critics, since apart from the cited common passages, there is no evidence of Beaumont's or Fletcher's authorship in the play. The common passages appear to be best explained as the type of borrowings sometimes found in works of the era (the borrowings from Thomas North's translation of Plutarch's Parallel Lives in Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra, for example) that have no bearing on questions of authorship.Mark Dominik, William Shakespeare and \\"The Birth of Merlin,\\" Beaverton, OR, Alioth Press, 1991; pp. 165‚Äì72. Though the dates of authorship for both plays are uncertain, it seems likely that Cupid's Revenge is the earlier work, and that the author or authors of Merlin were influenced by the Beaumont-Fletcher play. Synopsis The Birth of Merlin possesses a three-level plot, a structure common in plays of its era.Richard Levin, The Multiple Plot in English Renaissance Drama, Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1971. On the first level, the main plot, the characters are royal and their concerns are those of statecraft and national welfare; in the second-level plot, the characters are aristocratic and genteel and their concerns are those of personal values and personal fulfilment; and on the level of the comic subplot, the characters are common and their concerns are largely sensual. Unusually, the play begins on its second level: the opening scene introduces the nobleman Donobert, his daughters Constantia and Modestia, and their suitors Cador and Edwin, and begins the story of Modestia's conflict between her desire for a religious vocation versus social pressures to marry. The famous characters of Arthurian romance do not appear until the second scene, which introduces King Aurelius and his royal court. The British are flush with a recent victory over the invading Saxons‚Äîthough they are troubled by the fact that the king's brother Uther is missing. Saxon emissaries arrive at court to negotiate a peace; they are led by the Saxon princess Artesia. Aurelius instantly falls in love with Artesia, and in his infatuation grants the Saxons very generous peace terms‚Äîdespite the objections of his courtiers and the criticism of a holy hermit who interjects his own opposition. (Before the scene ends, Modestia consults the Hermit about her personal spiritual difficulty.) The first scene in Act II introduces the otherwise-unnamed Clown and his very pregnant sister, Joan Go-to't. References through the play identify the Clown a typical Rowleian fat clown, the type of role that Rowley repeatedly wrote for himself to play. The Clown's sister has gotten herself pregnant by yielding to the advances of a mysterious stranger; she and the Clown are now wandering through the forest, searching for the father of the child, or at least a father for the child. They stumble upon Prince Uther, who is wandering through the same forest, distracted and disconsolate after catching sight of a woman with whom he has instantly fallen in love. Overhearing this, the Clown solicits Uther as a potential husband for Joan, much to the prince's outrage. As he beats them, their cries are heard by courtiers searching for the prince, who interrupt the scene and carry Uther back to court. The Clown and Joan are left to continue their search. At court, Aurelius's infatuation has led to a sudden marriage with Artesia. One British noble, Edol, is so outraged that he flees the court to nourish his opposition. The court now blends British and Saxon influences, though not smoothly or happily. The Hermit has a contest of power with a Saxon magician; the Christian Hermit triumphs over pagan magic. Prince Uther enters, and sees that the woman who has caused his distraction is now his brother's wife and the new British queen. Aurelius recognises the situation, and withdraws in anger and jealousy. In Act III, the Clown and Joan have reached the court in their search for her child's father. They confront various courtiers, with comically unsuccessful results. Finally, though, they encounter the actual father: though Joan sees him as a handsome courtier, the Clown can recognise him for a devil, \\"his feet and head horrid\\". Joan pursues him, and the Clown loyally follows her. In the second-level plot, Modestia embraces her religious vocation; in a familial confrontation, Modestia's defence of her choice is so persuasive that her sister Constantia is converted to the spiritual life and rejects her suitor, just as Modestia has done. Donobert is outraged, but urges Cador and Edwin not to give up on his daughters yet. In a cave in a forest, the Devil summons Lucina and the Fates to attend Joan as she gives birth to Merlin. The Clown catches up, to meet his sister and his new-born nephew, a fully grown Merlin the Magician. Merlin introduces his Clown-uncle to his Devil-father; the Devil predicts a dramatic future for his newborn son. In the British court, the Saxons are plotting treason; Artesia manipulates Uther's romantic interest and Aurelius's jealousy to bring about a fissure between the two, though her plans are partially frustrated by the British nobles. The two factions separate and prepare for war. Meanwhile, Merlin, Joan, and the Clown have made their way to Wales, where King Vortigern, a Saxon ally, is having trouble building a castle. To keep the edifice from continual collapse, the Welsh must sacrifice a \\"fiend begotten child\\"; therefore they are pleased and relieved when Merlin appears. Merlin, however, foretells Vortigern's imminent defeat at the hands of Edol and the British. A series of battle scenes portray Edol's victory, culminating in a spectacular special-effect scene in which Merlin prophesizes on a blazing comet. Act V provides a swift wind-up of the various plots. Merlin seals his devil-father within the earth, and leads his mother away to a life of repentance. Donobert accepts his daughters' religious commitment to the solitary and celibate life. The British defeat the treacherous Saxons, who have assassinated Aurelius. Uther is now the British king, aided by Merlin. The play is rich with visual effects of varying types, including devils and magic and masque-like spectacles. It was clearly designed to provide broad, colourful, fast-paced entertainment (not to have in \\"The World\\").

They form the main ridge of the Korean peninsula. Geography The Taebaek mountains are located along the eastern edge of the peninsula and run along the eastern coast of the Korean Peninsula. The Hwangnyong Mountain in North Korea (1268 meters) forms the northern end of the range. Busan lies at the southern end of this mountain range, thus making the mountain range a total length of over 500 kilometers, averaging about 1000 meters in height. Prominent peaks of the range include Mount Seoraksan (1,708 m), Mount Kumgangsan (1,638 m), Mount Taebaeksan (1,566.7 m) and Mount Odaesan (1,563 m). To the east, the mountain range falls steeply into the sea, but to the west, there are more gentle slopes. Many spurs stretch southwest. The most important rivers of South Korea, the Han River and the Nakdong River, both originate in the Taebaek Mountains. Ecology Many of the slopes are extensively covered in forests. Industry Economically the Taebaek mountains are important for the mining of iron, coal, tungsten, fluorite, and limestone.

Her father was Khatri, and her mother was Jat.Meera Syal , Who Do You Think You Are?, BBC When she was young, the family moved to Bloxwich, north of Walsall. This landscape, and the family's status as the only Asian family in a small Midlands mining village of Essington, was later to form the backdrop to her novel (later filmed) Anita and Me, which Syal described in a 2003 BBC interview as semi-autobiographical. She attended Queen Mary's High School in nearby Walsall and then studied English and Drama at Manchester University, graduating with a Double First.

Also featured are Tom Noonan as serial killer Francis Dollarhyde, Dennis Farina as Graham's FBI superior Jack Crawford, and Brian Cox as incarcerated killer Hannibal Lecktor. The film focuses on Graham coming out of retirement to lend his talents to an investigation on Dollarhyde, a killer known as the \\"Tooth Fairy.\\" In doing so, he must confront the demons of his past and meet with Lecktor, who nearly counted Graham among his victims. Manhunter focuses on the forensic work carried out by the FBI to track down killers and shows the long- term effects that cases like this have on profilers such as Graham, highlighting the similarities between him and his quarry. The film features heavily stylized use of color to convey this sense of duality, and the nature of the characters' similarity has been explored in academic readings of the film. It was the first film adaptation of Harris' Hannibal Lecter novels, as well as the first adaptation of Red Dragon, which later became the basis for a film of the same name in 2002. Opening to mixed reviews, Manhunter fared poorly at the box office at the time of its release, making only $8.6 million in the United States. However, it has been reappraised in more recent reviews and now enjoys a more favorable reception, as both the acting and the stylized visuals have been appreciated better in later years. Its resurgent popularity, which may be due to later adaptations of Harris' books and Petersen's success in CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, has seen it labelled as a cult film.  Plot  Will Graham is a former FBI criminal profiler who has retired because of a mental breakdown after being attacked by a cannibalistic serial killer, Dr. Hannibal Lecktor, whom he captured. Graham is approached at his Florida home by his former FBI superior Jack Crawford, who is seeking help with a new serial killer case. Promising his wife that he will do nothing more than examine evidence and not risk physical harm, Graham agrees to visit the most recent crime scene in Atlanta, where he tries to enter the mindset of the killer, now dubbed the \\"Tooth Fairy\\" by the police for the bite marks left on his victims. Having found the killer's fingerprints, Graham meets with Crawford, and they are accosted by tabloid journalist Freddy Lounds. Graham pays a visit to Lecktor, a former psychiatrist, in his cell and asks for his insight into the killer's motivations. After a tense conversation, Lecktor agrees to look at the case file. Later, Lecktor manages to obtain Graham's home address by deceit while ostensibly making a phone call to his attorney. Graham travels to the first crime scene in Birmingham, Alabama, where he is contacted by Crawford, who patches Graham through to Frederick Chilton, Lecktor's warden, who has found a note in Lecktor's personal effects. Reading it, they realize it is from the Tooth Fairy, expressing admiration for Lecktor and an interest in Graham. Crawford brings Graham to the FBI Academy at Quantico, where a missing section of the note is analyzed to determine what Lecktor had removed. It is found to be an instruction to communicate through the personals section of the National Tattler, Lounds' newspaper. The FBI intends to plant a fake advertisement to replace Lecktor's, but they realize that without the proper book code the Tooth Fairy will know it is fake; therefore, they let the advertisement run as it is, and Graham organizes an interview with Lounds, during which he gives a false and derogatory profile of the Tooth Fairy to incite him. After a sting operation fails to catch the killer, Lounds is kidnapped by the Tooth Fairy. Lounds is forced to tape- record a statement before being set on fire in a wheelchair and killed, his flaming body rolled into the parking garage of the National Tattler as a warning. Graham is told by Crawford that they have cracked Lecktor's coded message to the Tooth Fairy‚Äîit is Graham's home address with an instruction to kill Graham and his family. Graham rushes home to find his family safe but terrified. After the FBI moves Graham's family to a safe house, he explains to his son Kevin why he had retired previously. At his job in a St. Louis film lab, Francis Dollarhyde‚Äîthe Tooth Fairy‚Äîapproaches a blind co-worker, Reba McClane, and offers her a ride home. They go to Dollarhyde's home, where Reba is oblivious to the fact that Dollarhyde is watching home-movie footage of his planned next victims. She kisses him and they have sex. The following night, just as Graham comes to realize how much the Tooth Fairy's desire for acceptance factors into the murders, Dollarhyde watches as Reba is escorted home by another co-worker. Dollarhyde murders the man and abducts Reba. Searching for a connection between the murdered families, Graham realizes that someone must have seen their home movies. He and Crawford deduce where the films were processed. They identify the lab in St. Louis and fly there. Dollarhyde has been casing the victims' homes through home movies, enabling him to prepare for the break-ins. Graham determines which employees have seen these films and obtains Dollarhyde's home address, to which he and Crawford travel with a police escort. Inside Dollarhyde's home, Dollarhyde struggles to kill Reba with a piece of glass, while police teams assemble around the house. Seeing that Dollarhyde has someone with him, Graham lunges through a window. He is subdued by Dollarhyde, who retrieves a shotgun and uses it to kill two police officers. Wounded in the firefight, Dollarhyde returns to the kitchen, where he is shot and killed by Graham. Graham, Reba, and Crawford are tended to by paramedics, and Graham returns home to his family.

Richard Gere, Mel Gibson and Paul Newman were considered for the role, but Mann cast Petersen after seeing footage from To Live and Die in L.A. Petersen spent time with officers of the Chicago Police Department researching for his role. Additionally, Petersen had a small role as a bouncer in Mann's 1981 film Thief. * Tom Noonan as Francis Dollarhyde, whose name is spelled differently from the novel's \\"Dolarhyde.\\" Noonan credits his ability to improvise during rehearsals for his casting. He took up bodybuilding to prepare physically for the part. He began preparation for his role by studying other serial killers, but quickly rejected this approach. While shooting the film, Noonan remained in character at all times, keeping away from cast members playing his pursuers. * Dennis Farina as Jack Crawford. Farina had already worked with Mann before, making his acting debut in the 1981 film Thief before starring in Crime Story and in several episodes of Miami Vice. Farina had already read the novel Red Dragon, and was called to audition at the same time as Brian Cox. * Kim Greist as Molly Graham. Greist, who according to reviews was \\"wasted in a tiny role,\\" had previously worked with Mann on an episode of Miami Vice. * Brian Cox as Dr. Hannibal Lecktor. Actors John Lithgow, Mandy Patinkin, and Brian Dennehy, and director William Friedkin were also considered for the part of Lecktor, whose name was changed from the novel's \\"Lecter.\\" Cox based his performance on Scottish serial killer Peter Manuel. Cox was asked to audition with his back turned to the casting agents, as they felt they needed to focus on the power of his voice when considering him for the part. * Joan Allen as Reba McClane. In preparation for her role, Allen spent time with the New York Institute for the Blind, learning to walk through New York blindfolded. She had previously worked with co-star William Petersen on stage, in the 1980 Steppenwolf Theatre Company production of Balm in Gilead. Macoun, Scott. ed. \\"History: \\"Balm in Gilead\\" (Sep. 18, 1980 ‚Äì Oct. 26, 1980) \\". Steppenwolf Theatre Company. Retrieved 19 June 2011. * Stephen Lang as Freddy Lounds. Lang had previously starred in Band of the Hand, on which Mann was executive producer. He went on to appear in the Mann-produced Crime Story with Farina and in Mann's 2009 film Public Enemies.  Production  = Pre-production = The film was originally going to be called Red Dragon, like the novel. Michael Mann, who called the new title \\"inferior,\\" said that producer Dino De Laurentiis made the change after Michael Cimino's film Year of the Dragon, produced by De Laurentiis, bombed at the box office in 1985. William Petersen has commented that another reason for the change was to avoid any suggestion that it might be a martial arts film. \\"At the time, Bruce Lee was knocking out Dragon movies, and Dino, in his wisdom, decided people would think it was a kung-fu movie,\\" he later recalled. Brian Cox, who played jailed killer Hannibal Lecktor, has also expressed disdain for the film's title, calling it \\"bland\\" and \\"cheesy.\\" David Lynch was an early consideration for the director's role, having still been under contract to De Laurentiis after making Dune. However, Lynch rejected the role after finding the story to be \\"violent and completely degenerate.\\" William Petersen worked with the Chicago Police Department Violent Crimes Unit and the FBI Violent Crimes Unit in preparation for the role of Will Graham, talking to the officers and reading some of their crime files.Simmons, Sue (interviewer); Petersen, William (actor). (15 August 1986). Live at Five: Interview with William Petersen. [Television Production]. NBC. He spoke to the investigators on the Richard Ramirez case about how they coped with the effects these disturbing cases had on them and how they learned to \\"compartmentalize\\" their working and personal lives. \\"Of course you don't really turn it off,\\" he recalled. \\"At the end of the day, even if you're just a regular policeman, it takes a toll.\\" During the three years he spent working on the script, Michael Mann also spent time with the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit, where he claimed to have met people very like the character of Will Graham. This level of research led Brent E. Turvey to describe the film as \\"one of the most competent blends of cutting-edge forensic science and criminal profiling at the time.\\" Mann also spent several years corresponding with imprisoned murderer Dennis Wayne Wallace. Wallace had been motivated by his obsession for a woman he barely knew, and believed that Iron Butterfly's \\"In-A-Gadda-Da- Vida\\" was \\"their song.\\" This connection inspired Mann to include the song in the film. Tom Noonan, who played killer Francis Dollarhyde, initially researched other serial killers to study for the role, but was repulsed by it. He then decided to play the character with the sense that he felt he was doing right by his victims, not harming them. \\"I wanted to feel this guy was doing the best he could,\\" Noonan explained, \\"that he was doing this out of love.\\" Noonan credits his casting to improvisation during his audition, recalling that he was reading lines alongside a young woman. During a reading of the scene featuring the torture of Freddy Lounds, Noonan noticed that the woman began to seem frightened, and deliberately tried to scare her more. He believed that this is what secured the role for him. Joan Allen, who played Dollarhyde's blind love interest Reba McClane, recalls meeting with representatives of the New York Institute for the Blind in preparation for her role. She spent time walking around New York wearing a mask over her eyes to get accustomed to walking as though she were blind. John Lithgow, Mandy Patinkin, William Friedkin, and Brian Dennehy were all considered for the role of Hannibal Lecktor, but Brian Cox was cast after being recommended to Mann by Dennehy. Cox based his portrayal on Scottish serial killer Peter Manuel, who (he said) \\"didn't have a sense of right and wrong.\\" Cox has also suggested that his selection was due to his nationality, claiming that characters who are \\"a little bit nasty\\" are best played by Europeans. Mann kept the role of Lecktor very short, believing that it was \\"such a charismatic character that [he] wanted the audience almost not to get enough of him.\\" For the role of Will Graham, De Laurentiis had expressed interest in Richard Gere, Mel Gibson and Paul Newman, but Mann, having seen footage of William Petersen's role in To Live and Die in L.A., championed Petersen for the part. = Filming = Petersen has claimed in an interview that one of the film's scenes forced the crew to adopt a guerrilla filmmaking approach. The scene in which Petersen's character Will Graham falls asleep while studying crime scene photographs during a flight required the use of an airplane during shooting. Michael Mann had been unable to gain permission to use a plane for the scene and booked tickets for the crew on a flight from Chicago to Florida. Once on board, the crew used their equipment, checked in as hand luggage, to shoot the scene quickly, while keeping the plane's passengers and crew mollified with Manhunter crew jackets. Cinematographer Dante Spinotti made strong use of color tints in the film, using a cool \\"romantic blue\\" tone to denote the scenes featuring Will Graham and his wife, and a more subversive green hue, with elements of purple or magenta, as a cue for the unsettling scenes in the film, mostly involving Dollarhyde. Petersen has stated that Mann wanted to create a visual aura to bring the audience into the film, so that the story would work on an interior and emotional level. Mann also made use of multiple frame rates in filming the climactic shootout: different cameras recording the scene at 24, 36, 72 and 90 frames per second, giving the final scene what Spinotti has called an \\"off-tempo\\" and \\"staccato\\" feel. During principal photography, Noonan asked that no one playing his victims and pursuers be allowed to see him, while those he did speak to should address him by his character's name, Francis. The first time Noonan met Petersen was when Petersen jumped through a large window during the filming of the climactic fight scene.Mann, Michael (writer & director). (2007). Manhunter Restored Director's Cut Audio Commentary. [DVD] Noonan admits that, because of his request, the atmosphere on set became so tense that people actually became afraid of him. He had also begun body-building to prepare for the role and felt that his size intimidated the crew when filming began, as the first scene to be shot was his character's interrogation and murder of another. Noonan claims that this led him to take separate flights and stay in separate hotels from the rest of the cast, and while on the film's sets, he would remain in his trailer alone in the dark to prepare himself, sometimes joined by a silent Mann. Petersen recalled filming the climactic shoot-out scene at the end of principal photography, when most of the crew had already left the production because of time constraints. With no special effects crew to provide the blood spatter for the gunshots, Petersen described how the remaining crew would blow ketchup across the set through hoses when such effects were needed. Joan Allen also related that Mann would simulate the impacts of bullets in Dollarhyde's kitchen by throwing glass jars across the surfaces so they would shatter where he needed them to; one of these broken jars left a shard of glass embedded in Petersen's thigh during filming. The pool of blood forming around Noonan's character at the end of this scene was intended to allude to the \\"Red Dragon\\" tattoos worn by the character in the novel. This shot left Noonan lying in the corn syrup stage blood for so long that he became stuck to the floor. Ted Levine, who later went on to play Buffalo Bill in The Silence of the Lambs, crashed Manhunters wrap party to spend time with Petersen, whom he knew from their days in Chicago theater. Levine was later invited to audition for Crime Story as a result of meeting Mann at this party. = Post-production = Spinotti has commented on how Mann's use of mise en sc√®ne when framing shots evokes \\"the emotional situation in the film at that particular time,\\" noting the director's focus on the particular shape or color of elements of the set. He has also drawn attention to the scene in which Graham visits Lecktor in his cell, pointing out the constant position of the cell bars within the frame, even as the shots cut back and forth between the two characters. \\"There is nothing in Manhunter ... which is just a nice shot,\\" says Spinotti. \\"[It] is all focused into conveying that particular atmosphere; whether it's happiness, or delusion, or disillusion.\\" This \\"manipulation of focus and editing\\" has become a visual hallmark of the film. Despite having initially filmed the scenes involving Francis Dollarhyde with an elaborate tattoo across Noonan's chest, Mann and Spinotti felt that the finished result seemed out of place and that it \\"trivialize[d] the struggle\\" the character faced. Mann cut the scenes in which the character appeared bare-chested, and quickly re-shot additional footage to replace what had been removed. Spinotti noted that in doing so, scenes which he felt had been captured with a \\"beautiful\\" aesthetic were lost, as the production did not have the time to recreate the original lighting conditions. Petersen had difficulty ridding himself of the Will Graham character after principal photography wrapped. While rehearsing for a play in Chicago, he felt the old character \\"always coming out\\" instead of his new role. To try and rid himself of the character, Petersen went to a barbershop where he had them shave his beard, cut his hair and dye it blond so that he could look into the mirror and see a different person. At first he felt it was due to the rigorous shooting schedule for Manhunter, but later realized that the character \\"had creeped in.\\"  Soundtrack  Manhunters soundtrack \\"dominates the film,\\" with music that is \\"explicitly diegetic the entire way.\\" Steve Rybin has commented that the music is not intended to correlate with the intensity of the action portrayed alongside it, but rather to signify when the viewer should react with a \\"degree of aesthetic distance\\" from the film, or be \\"suture[d] into the diegetic world\\" more closely. The soundtrack album was released in limited quantities in 1986, on MCA Records (#6182). It was not, however, released on compact disc at the time, but only on cassette tape and vinyl record. On 19 March 2007, a two-CD set titled Music from the Films of Michael Mann was released, featuring four tracks from Manhunter: The Prime Movers' \\"Strong As I Am,\\" Iron Butterfly's \\"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,\\" Shriekback's \\"This Big Hush,\\" and Red 7's \\"Heartbeat.\\" In March 2010, Intrada Records announced that they were releasing the Manhunter soundtrack on CD for the first time, with an extra track, \\"Jogger's Stakeout\\" by The Reds. The Reds were contacted about contributing to the film's soundtrack after submitting their music for possible use on Miami Vice. They recorded their score over a period of two months, in studios in Los Angeles and New York City. They recorded a total of 28 minutes of music for the film; however, several cues were replaced later with music by Shriekback and Michel Rubini. \\"Comfortably Numb\\" by Pink Floyd and \\"I Had Too Much to Dream (Last Night)\\" by The Electric Prunes have both been cited by The Reds' vocalist Rick Shaffer as influences on the film's soundtrack. Mann selected \\"Strong as I Am\\" by The Prime Movers for the film and later funded the filming of a music video for the song's release as a single. Music in the film's screen credits which are not listed above were never included until the release of the double LP on Waxwork Records in July 2018:  Themes  alt=Two still images from the film. One is a married couple lying in bed, the image heavily tinted blue. The other is a man sitting alone in a darkened room, with the image heavily tinted green Visually, Manhunter is driven by strong color cues and the use of tints, including the hallmark blue of Mann's work. Dante Spinotti has noted that these visual cues were meant to evoke different moods based on the tone of the scenes in which they were used: cool blue tones were used for the scenes shared between Will Graham and his wife Molly, and unsettling greens and magentas were used for the scenes with the killer Francis Dollarhyde. Steven Rybin has observed that \\"blue is associated with Molly, sex, and the Graham family home,\\" while green denotes \\"searching and discovery,\\" pointing out the color of Graham's shirt when the investigation begins and the green tone of the interior shots in the Atlanta police station. John Muir suggests that this helps identify the character of Graham with the \\"goodness\\" of the natural world, and Dollarhyde with the city, \\"where sickness thrives.\\" This strongly stylized approach drew criticism from reviewers at first, but has since been seen as a hallmark of the film and viewed more positively. Academic studies of the film tend to draw attention to the relationship between the characters of Graham and Dollarhyde, noting, for example, that the film \\"chooses to emphasize the novel's symbiotic relationships between Graham, Lecter and Dolarhyde by visual techniques and screen acting where subtlety plays a key role.\\" In his book Hearths of Darkness: The Family in the American Horror Film, Tony Williams praises the depth of the film's characterizations, calling Dollarhyde a \\"victim of society\\" and his portrayal \\"undermining convenient barriers between monster and human.\\" Philip L. Simpson echoes this sentiment in his book Psycho Paths: Tracking the Serial Killer through Contemporary American Film, calling Manhunter a \\"profoundly ambiguous and destabilizing film\\" which creates \\"uncomfortable affinities between protagonist and antagonist.\\" Mark T. Conard's The Philosophy of Film Noir follows this same idea, claiming that the film presents the notion that \\"what it takes to catch a serial killer is tantamount to being one.\\"  Release  = Box office = Manhunter was released in the United States on 15 August 1986. It opened in 779 theaters and grossed $2,204,400 in its opening weekend. The film eventually grossed a total of $8,620,929 in the US, making it the 76th highest-grossing film that year. Because of internal problems at De Laurentiis Entertainment Group, the UK premiere was postponed for over a year. It was screened in November 1987 as part of the London Film Festival and saw wide release on 24 February 1989. In France, Manhunter was screened on 9 April at the 1987 Cognac Festival du Film Policier, where it was awarded the Critics Prize. It was also shown at the 2009 Camerimage Film Festival in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Poland. On 19 March 2011, it was screened at Grauman's Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood to celebrate the 25th anniversary of its release. Michael Mann was present for discussion at the event. = Home media = Manhunter was released in a widescreen edition on laserdisc in 1986. It was released on VHS several times, including by BMG on 10 October 1998 and by Universal Studios in 2001. It has also been available on DVD in various versions. Anchor Bay released a two-DVD limited, numbered, edition in 2000, disc one being the Theatrical version and extras, disc two being the \\"Director's Cut.\\" An individual release of the first disc [Theatrical version] from the two-disc set was released at the same time. In 2003 Anchor Bay released the \\"Restored Director's Cut,\\" overseen by Mann, which is very close to the \\"Director's Cut\\" on the 2000 disc but omits one scene. It does, however, feature a commentary track by Mann. MGM (current holders of the rights to The Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal) released the theatrical cut of Manhunter on DVD in a pan-and-scan format in 2004. In January 2007, the same version was released by MGM in a widescreen format, for the first time on DVD, as part of The Hannibal Lecter Collection, along with The Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal. Manhunter was also released by itself in September 2007. The studio re-released The Hannibal Lecter Collection on Blu-ray in September 2009. In 2016, Shout! Factory released both the theatrical and director's cut on Blu-ray.  Reception  On its release, Manhunter was met with widely mixed reviews. At first, it was seen as too stylish, owing largely to Mann's 1980s trademark use of pastel colors, art- deco architecture and glass brick. A common criticism in the initial reviews was that the film overemphasized the music and stylistic visuals. Petersen's skill as a lead actor was also called into question. Particularly critical of the film's stylistic approach was The New York Times, which called attention to Mann's \\"taste for overkill,\\" branding his stylized approach as \\"hokey\\" and little more than \\"gimmicks.\\" Chicago Tribune writer Dave Kehr remarked that Mann \\"believes in style so much that he has very little belief left over for the characters or situations of his film, which suffers accordingly,\\" adding that the film's focus on style serves to \\"drain any notion of credibility\\" from its plot. Sheila Benson of the Los Angeles Times was critical of the film's visuals and soundtrack, comparing it unfavourably with Miami Vice and describing it as a \\"chic, well-cast wasteland\\" that \\"delivers very little.\\" The film's stylistic similarity to Miami Vice was also pointed out by Film Threat's Dave Beuscher, who felt it was the chief reason for the film's poor box office results. Writing for the San Francisco Chronicle, Steve Winn derided the film, claiming its lack of a strong lead role caused it to \\"fall apart like the shattered mirrors that figure in the crimes.\\" Time was more favorable in its review, praising the \\"intelligent camerabatics\\" and \\"bold, controlled color scheme.\\" Leonard Maltin gave the film three stars, calling it \\"gripping all the way through and surprisingly nonexploitive,\\" although adding that \\"the holes start to show through\\" if looked for \\"too carefully.\\" Manhunter was, however, nominated for the 1987 Edgar Award for Best Motion Picture. Modern appreciation of the film has seen its standing among critics improve. Salon.com called Mann's original the best of the Lecter series, and Slate magazine described it as \\"mesmerizing,\\" positing that it directly inspired television series such as Millennium and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, though calling attention to its \\"Miami-Vice-like overreliance on synthesized sludge.\\" The Independent called it \\"the most aestheticised film of the 1980s,\\" and noted its \\"chilly integrity.\\" British television channel and production company Film4 called it \\"the most refined screen adaptation of Harris' books,\\" although they found the film's contemporary soundtrack \\"dated.\\" Sky Movies echoed this sentiment, summing up their review by saying \\"although it still remains a classic, the film has dated slightly.\\" Retrospective reviews tend to be less critical of the stylized visuals: the BBC's Ali Barclay called the film \\"a truly suspenseful, stylish thriller,\\" awarding it four out of five stars, and Nathan Ditum described it in Total Film as \\"complex, disturbing and super-stylish,\\" adding that the 2002 remake could not compete with it. Empire editor Mark Dinning gave the film five stars out of five, praising the \\"subtlety\\" of the acting and the \\"neon angst\\" of the visuals. Television channel Bravo named Dollarhyde's interrogation of Freddy Lounds as one of its 30 Even Scarier Movie Moments in 2007, and Noonan's portrayal of Dollarhyde was praised by Simon Abrams of UGO Networks as \\"a highlight of his career.\\" Despite the low gross on its initial release, Manhunter grew in popularity by the 2000s and has been mentioned in several books and lists of cult films. These reappraisals often cite the success of Silence of the Lambs and its sequels as the reason for the increased interest in Manhunter, while still favoring the earlier film over its successors. Telling of this resurgence in appreciation are the film's ratings on review aggregation sites such as Metacritic or Rotten Tomatoes. Compiled mostly from reviews written decades after its original release, Manhunter has a weighted score of 78 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on ten reviews, and a 93% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, from 40 reviews. The critics consensus on Rotten Tomatoes reads: \\"Michael Mann introduces audiences to Hannibal Lecter for the first time in Manhunter, a modish thriller that fleshes out Thomas Harris' heinous creations with an elegant, chilling detachment.\\"  Legacy  Manhunters focus on the use of forensic science in a criminal investigation has been cited as a major influence on several films and television series that have come after it‚Äîmost notably CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, also featuring William Petersen, which was \\"inspired, or at least influenced\\" by the forensics scenes in Manhunter. Petersen's sympathetic portrayal of profiler Will Graham has also been noted as helping to influence a \\"shift in the image of the pop-culture FBI agent\\" that would continue throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The film has also been noted as a thematic precursor to the series Millennium, John Doe, Profiler, and The X-Files, and to films such as Copycat, Switchback, The Bone Collector, Seven and Fallen. The Silence of the Lambs, a film adaptation of Harris' next Lecter novel, was released in 1991. However, none of the cast of Manhunter reprise their roles in the later film, although actors Frankie Faison and Dan Butler appear in both films as different and unrelated characters. The Silence of the Lambs earned several awards and accolades, including the Academy Award for Best Picture. It is one of only three films to have won the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Actress, and Best Screenplay. The Silence of the Lambs was followed in turn by a sequel and two prequels: Hannibal, Red Dragon and Hannibal Rising, plus an NBC television series, Hannibal. Of these later films, Red Dragon (2002), adapted from the same novel as Manhunter, was released to a generally positive critical reception and successful box office receipts, making $209,196,298 on a $78 million budget. Based on 2000s reviews, Red Dragon currently has a 68% rating from 183 reviews at Rotten Tomatoes, and a 60% rating based on 36 reviews on Metacritic. Manhunters cinematographer Dante Spinotti also served as the director of photography on this version.

It is taken by mouth, in the nose, or by injection under the skin. Effects generally occur within three hours. Common side effects include chest pressure, fatigue, vomiting, tingling, and the feeling that the world is spinning. Serious side effects may include serotonin syndrome, heart attacks, strokes, and seizures. With excessive use medication overuse headaches may occur. It is unclear if use in pregnancy or breastfeeding is safe. How it works is not entirely clear. It is in the triptan class of medications. Sumatriptan was patented in 1982 and approved for medical use in 1991. It is available as a generic medication. In the United Kingdom it costs the NHS about ¬£1 per dose as of 2019. In the United States the wholesale cost of this amount is about US$0.60. In 2017, it was the 97th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than eight million prescriptions. It is also available as the combination product sumatriptan/naproxen at a cost of US$50 per dose. Medical uses Sumatriptan is effective for ending or relieving the intensity of migraine and cluster headaches. It is most effective when taken early after the start of the pain. Injected sumatriptan is more effective than other formulations. Adverse effects Overdose of sumatriptan can cause sulfhemoglobinemia, a rare condition in which the blood changes from red to green, due to the integration of sulfur into the hemoglobin molecule. If sumatriptan is discontinued, the condition reverses within a few weeks. Serious cardiac events, including some that have been fatal, have occurred following the use of sumatriptan injection or tablets. Events reported have included coronary artery vasospasm, transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (V-Fib). The most common side effects reported by at least 2% of patients in controlled trials of sumatriptan (25-, 50-, and 100-mg tablets) for migraine are atypical sensations (paresthesias and warm/cold sensations) reported by 4% in the placebo group and 5‚Äì6% in the sumatriptan groups, pain and other pressure sensations (including chest pain) reported by 4% in the placebo group and 6‚Äì8% in the sumatriptan groups, neurological events (vertigo) reported by less than 1% in the placebo group and less than 1% to 2% in the sumatriptan groups. Malaise/fatigue occurred in less than 1% of the placebo group and 2‚Äì3% of the sumatriptan groups. Sleep disturbance occurred in less than 1% in the placebo group to 2% in the sumatriptan group. Mechanism of action Sumatriptan is structurally similar to serotonin (5-HT), and is a 5-HT receptor (types 5-HT1D and 5-HT1B ) agonist. Sumatriptan's primary therapeutic effect, however, is in its inhibition of the release of Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), likely through its 5-HT1D/1B receptor-agonist action. This is substantiated by the efficacy of newly developed CGRP antagonists and antibodies in the preventative treatment of migraine. However, how agonism of the 5-HT1D/1B receptors inhibits CGRP release is not fully understood. CGRP is believed to cause sensitization of trigeminal nociceptive neurons, contributing to the pain experienced in migraine. Sumatriptan is also shown to decrease the activity of the trigeminal nerve, which presumably accounts for sumatriptan's efficacy in treating cluster headaches. The injectable form of the drug has been shown to abort a cluster headache within 30 minutes in 77% of cases. Pharmacokinetics Sumatriptan is administered in several forms: tablets, subcutaneous injection, and nasal spray. Oral administration (as the succinate salt) suffers from poor bioavailability, partly due to presystemic metabolism‚Äîsome of it gets broken down in the stomach and bloodstream before it reaches the target arteries. A new rapid-release tablet formulation has the same bioavailability, but the maximum concentration is achieved on average 10‚Äì15 minutes earlier. When injected, sumatriptan is faster-acting (usually within 10 minutes), but the effect lasts for a shorter time. Sumatriptan is metabolised primarily by monoamine oxidase A into 2‚Äê{5‚Äê[(methylsulfamoyl)methyl]‚Äêindole‚Äê3‚Äêyl}acetic acid which is then conjugated to glucuronic acid. These metabolites are excreted in the urine and bile. Only about 3% of the active drug may be recovered unchanged. There is no simple, direct relationship between sumatriptan concentration (pharmacokinetics) per se in the blood and its anti-migraine effect (pharmacodynamics). This paradox has, to some extent, been resolved by comparing the rates of absorption of the various sumatriptan formulations, rather than the absolute amounts of drug that they deliver. History Sumatriptan vials =Approval= In 1991, Glaxo received approval for sumatriptan, which was the first available triptan. In the United States, it is available only by medical prescription (and is frequently limited, without prior authorization, to a quantity of nine in a 30-day period). This requirement for a medical prescription also exists in Australia. However, it can be bought over the counter in the UK and Sweden. Several dosage forms for sumatriptan have been approved, including tablets, solution for injection, and nasal inhalers. In July 2009, the US FDA approved a single-use jet injector formulation of sumatriptan. The device delivers a subcutaneous injection of 6 mg sumatriptan, without the use of a needle. Autoinjectors with needles have been previously available in Europe and North America for several years. Phase III studies with an iontophoretic transdermal patch (Zelrix/Zecuity) started in July 2008. This patch uses low voltage controlled by a pre-programmed microchip to deliver a single dose of sumatriptan through the skin within 30 minutes. Zecuity was approved by the US FDA in January 2013. Sales of Zecuity have been stopped following reports of skin burns and irritation. =Generics= Glaxo patents for sumatriptan expired in February 2009. At that time, Imitrex sold for about $25 a pill. On 6 November 2008, Par Pharmaceutical announced that it would begin shipping generic versions of sumatriptan injection (sumatriptan succinate injection) 4- and 6-mg starter kits and 4- and 6-mg filled syringe cartridges to the trade immediately. In addition, Par anticipates launching the 6-mg vials early in 2009. Mylan Laboratories Inc., Ranbaxy Laboratories, Sandoz (a subsidiary of Novartis), Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, and other companies have received FDA approval for generic versions of sumatriptan tablets in 25-, 50-, and 100-mg doses since 2009. The drug is generically available in U.S. and European markets, since Glaxo's patent protections have expired in those jurisdictions. Nasal spray sumatriptan is also generically available.  Legal status  In Russia versions of sumatriptan, which are not registered in the National registry of medications, may be regarded as narcotic drugs (derivatives of dimethyltriptamine).

Following Hungarian grammar rules, the addition of the letter \\"i\\" to the end of some words implies a belonging, hence the word \\"K√∂r√∂si\\" would translate to \\"of/from K√∂r√∂s\\". In the late Middle Ages, it was common for Hungarian noble families with names derived in a similar way from a toponym to spell their names with \\"y\\" at the end instead of \\"i\\", and/or with a doubled consonant before it.

She was the illegitimate daughter of the then 22-year-old Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and Johanna Maria van der Gheynst. She was a Duchess of Florence and a Duchess of Parma and Piacenza by marriage.  Biography  Alessandro de' Medici, Duke of Florence Ottavio Farnese, Duke of Parma Margaret as a baby with her mother and father Margaret's mother, Johanna Maria van der Gheynst, a servant of Charles de Lalaing, Seigneur de Montigny, was a Fleming. Margaret was brought up in Mechelen, under the supervision of two powerful Spanish and Austrian Habsburg Imperial family relatives, her great-aunt, the Archduchess Margaret of Austria, and her aunt Mary of Austria, who were successive governors of the Netherlands from 1507 to 1530 and from 1530 to 1555, respectively. Her early life followed a strict routine set forth by her father, Charles V, who used his daughter as part of his plans to secure his empire. In 1527, the year she turned five, she became engaged to the nephew of Pope Clement VII, Alessandro de' Medici, Duke of Florence, to assist her father's ambition in gaining influence in Italy. The marriage negotiations had been initiated in 1526, and in 1529 the agreement was officially signed by her father and the Pope. In 1529, Margaret was acknowledged by her father and allowed to assume the name Margaret of Austria, and in 1533, the 11-year-old girl was brought to live in Italy and educated in the courts of Florence, Rome, and Parma.Steen, Charlie R., Margaret of Parma: A Life, Brill, 2013 There, she was taught skills that helped her grow as an independent woman. As Margaret did not spend much time with her husband, she used this time to become exposed to the surrounding Italian culture. Though she was multi-lingual, she preferred the Italian language for the rest of her life. In 1536, she married Alessandro, who was assassinated in 1537. On 4 November 1538, the 15-year-old widow married Ottavio Farnese, Duke of Parma, the 14-year-old grandson of Pope Paul III. At first she refused to marry him. Although the union proved an unhappy one, it gave her years of experience in Rome, and produced twin sons, one of whom died in infancy. She would continue her studies of the arts and politics while being married to Ottavio. The couple lived separately for much of their lives, and Margaret maintained her own court and chapel. She was in a somewhat difficult position, as the Pope and the Emperor argued about authority over Parma. In 1555, the Farnese family were acknowledged as rulers of Parma by Spain in exchange for the custody of her son. In 1555, she left Italy for the Netherlands, where she left her son in the care of her half-brother Philip II. Philip appointed her Governor of the Netherlands when he left in 1559 for Spain. As governor, Margaret faced the rising storm of discontent against the Inquisition and Spanish despotism, and Philip had left her but nominal authority. He was determined to pursue his own arbitrary course, and the result was the revolt of the Netherlands. Margaret was forced to adjust herself to the advice of Cardinal Granvelle, Philip's choice for her chief councilor, who would grow to be greatly disliked in the Netherlands. After Granvelle's exile from the Netherlands in 1564, Margaret was forced to rely on the grandees in her Council., pp. 511-520 In 1565, an opposition party was formed from the Dutch nobility. Margaret received its complaints and, having no army to put down the dissenters, promised to stop religious repression. In 1566, Iconoclastic riots took place all over the Netherlands but she managed to quell them, with the help of her stadtholders Philip of Noircarmes (who subjugated the cities of Tournai and Valenciennes) in Hainaut and William of Orange in Holland . The next year, Philip sent her military help led by the Duke of Alba. Margaret warned Philip that actions by Alba would lead to catastrophe, but instead of trying to stop Alba, she resigned when she learned that Alba's power of attorney, granted by Philip, superseded her own. In 1567 Margaret retired to L'Aquila in Italy. She was appointed Governor of Abruzzo, where she had inherited a domain from her late husband. She acted as the adviser to her son and to her royal bastard half-brother, John of Austria. In 1578, her son Alexander Farnese was appointed to the office of governor- general of the Netherlands; Philip appointed her his co-regent, intending that they would balance each other. However, they were unable to work together, and Margaret retired to Namur in 1582. She was given permission by Philip to return to Italy in 1583. She died in Ortona in 1586 and was buried in the church of S. Sisto in Piacenza. Charlie R. Steen describes her as \\"a woman dedicated to compromise and conciliation in public affairs.\\"  Issue  She had two sons with her second husband Ottavio: * Charles Farnese (, , ; 27 August 1545 ‚Äì September 1545), heir to the Duchy of Parma. * Alexander Farnese (27 August 1545 ‚Äì 3 December 1592), 3rd Duke of Parma; married Infanta Maria of Portugal and had issue.

Dating back to the Qing dynasty, its earliest publication date is given as 1740. Since then, many of the critically lauded stories have been adapted for other media such as film and television. History The compilation was first circulated in scribal copies but it was not published until after the author's death. According to Zhao Qigao, Pu originally intended for his anthology to be titled Tales of Ghosts and Foxes. Sources differ in their account of the year of publication. One source claims Liaozhai was published by Pu's grandson in 1740. Pu is believed to have completed the majority of the tales sometime in 1679, though he could have added entries as late as 1707. The earliest surviving print version of Liaozhai was printed in 1766 in Hangzhou. The Martin Bodmer Foundation Library houses a 19th-century Liaozhai manuscript, silk-printed and bound leporello- style, that contains three tales including \\"The Bookworm\\", \\"The Great Sage, Heaven's Equal\\", and \\"The Frog God\\". Content =Themes= The main characters of this book apparently are ghosts, foxes, immortals and demons, but the author focused on the everyday life of commoners. He used the supernatural and the unexplainable to illustrate his ideas of society and government. He criticized the corruption and injustice in society and sympathized with the poor. Four main themes are present in Strange Stories. The first is a complaint about the skewed feudal system. The author argued that many officers and rich people committed crimes without being punished, because they enjoyed privilege and power granted to them by the government, purely by their status and/or their wealth. This theme can be found in short stories such as ‚ÄúThe Cricket‚Äù, ‚ÄúXi Fangping‚Äù, and ‚ÄúShang Sanguan‚Äù. It is fairly clear that the author resents the feudal government, skewed and unfair as it was. Secondly, the author revealed the corrupt examination system at the time. Pu had taken imperial exams and discovered that the exams were unfairly graded. He postulated that many students cheated and bribed examiners or the grading officers. The education system, thus, became pointless in Pu's eyes, as it had destroyed the scholars‚Äô minds and ruined their creativity, as illustrated in such stories as ‚ÄúKao San Sheng‚Äù, ‚ÄúYa Tou‚Äù (The Maid), and ‚ÄúScholar Wang Zi-an‚Äù. Pu's third theme was a clear admiration of pure, faithful love between poor scholars and powerless women, writing many stories about the love between beautiful and kind female ghosts and poor students to illustrate the allegory. The author highly praised women who took care of their husbands‚Äô lives and helped them achieve success, as can be found in chapters such as ‚ÄúLian Xiang‚Äù, ‚ÄúYingning‚Äù and ‚ÄúNie Xiaoqian‚Äù. Lastly, Pu criticized the people‚Äôs immoral behavior and sought to educate them through Strange Stories. He embedded Confucian-styled moral standards and Taoist principles into parables; some examples are ‚ÄúPainted Skin‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Taoist of Lao Mountain‚Äù.

The city is a major tourist hub, and a popular gateway to nearby Seoraksan national park. Sokcho is home to the few lakes: Yeongrangho and Cheongchoho that are naturally created by the Sea of Japan.  History  Sokcho originally was a part of Dongye from roughly 3rd-century BC to around early 5th-century. Sokcho started from just a fishing village with a few people around Cheongchoho. In 1905, it became one of the major ports because of its geological feature. Since Cheongchoho lake is adjacent to the Sea of Japan, big ships were able to come in and out with ease. Later on, Sokcho, linked with Seoul by air and road, the city became a mineral transfer port in 1937. Upon the division of the Korean peninsula into two countries following World War II, Sokcho was on the North Korean side of the border, but since the Korean War armistice (1953), it has been a part of South Korea. Tourism View of Sokcho from Seoraksan Sinheung Temple Seoraksan National Park is located in the vicinity of Sokcho, and attracts many domestic and international tourists. The city itself is known for the beach, natural hot springs and golf courses, as well as its fine fishery products. The nearby Yeongrangho lake is renowned for its beauty. The reflection of Seoraksan and its Ulsanbawi are particularly popular. There are a number of well-preserved Buddhist temples in the area around Sokcho. The main building of the Sinheungsa temple (Geukrakbojeon) is a major tourist destination (originally built in the 15th century). Also notable is the Hyangseongsaji samcheung seoktap, a three-storey pagoda of 4.3 metres. It dates from 652 and is located at the site of the Hyangseongsa temple. Yeonggeumjeong, a pavilion built on the shores of Sokcho, is popular for its magnificent views of the sunrise, as well as for hearing the sound of the sea. It is thought that the pavilion was built at this location for sonic reasons. Marina Yacht is located in Cheongchoho Lake Park and it provides a yacht tour on a wide expanse of the Sea of Japan. The yacht sailing begins and ends at Cheongcho Marina passing Seorakdaegyo Bridge, Dongmyeonghang Port, Jodo in order. Marina Yacht rents boats to people who have a boat driving license. The place also operates a caf√©. Yeongrangho Hwarangdo Experience Center is held various experience programs, horse riding members recruitment, and annual World Knight Championship. The center contributes to the transmission of traditional horseback martial art and popularization, and vitalization of horse riding. Abai village near Seoraksan was originally set up as an area to house North Korean refugees in Sokcho due to the separation of the two Koreas. Consequently, many of the population have relatives in North Korea. The village has seen increased tourism due to the popularity of the Korean Drama Autumn in My Heart on KBS In July 2016, Sokcho became one of the few locations in South Korea where Pok√©mon Go could be played due to government restrictions on mapping data. Players flocked to the city, causing bus tickets to sell out. In 1999, Gangwon International Tourism Expo was held. Today, a number of tourists are also attracted by the closeness to the DMZ. Sokcho used to have its own airport, linking the city to Seoul. Currently, the city is served by the Yangyang International Airport. The opening of KTX Kyung Kang line has made it convenient for travelers to visit Gangwon-Do province which is only an 86-minute train ride that starts from Seoul and tons of attractions.

Formed in 1953 as the Sokcho Tourist & Fishery Market, it was included on the Korea Tourism Organization's list of ‚ÄúBest Traditional Markets for Foreign Tourists‚Äù last year. With fresh fish caught off the coast in the Sea of Japan to dried fish and various vegetables, one can have fun just looking around and watching the fishmongers bargaining with local market goers. Sokcho is known for Hoe, which is a raw fish. The coastal waters provide good fishing grounds for Ojingeo, Myeongtae, Gwangeo and Godeungeo. Sundubu can be found in the streets of the tofu towns such as Sinheung Sundubu and Haksapyeong Sundubu - it is made from Seoraksan and Sea of Japan water. Sokcho offers a unique twist to Sundae (not the eponymous dessert) by using Ojingeo instead of pork intestines. The Ojingeo-sundae consists of squid stir-fry, made with noodles and blood sausage, with carrots, onions, seaweed and spices mixed together, covered with thin fried egg yolk.

Daepo harbor, outside of Sokcho on the road to Yangyang offers more than 100 individual mini restaurants serving diverse seafood dishes. An own unique stuffed squid dish, Abai Sundae, can be found in Abai village. In October Sokcho comes to life with the Seorak Cultural Festival, which includes parades, stage shows, contests, races and various other forms of entertainment. The rice cake making sampling contests are particularly popular. Another unusual event is the Gaet- Bae, or raft, race. Two teams propel the rafts across the course by pulling on long handled hooks catching the cable that straddles the deck of each raft. Climate Sokcho straddles the line between a humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen Cfa) and a humid continental climate (K√∂ppen Dfa).

The Yangyang area is well known for its pine mushrooms (song-i), its fish--particularly salmon--and its sunrises. Overview In 2002, Yangyang opened its own airport, serving Busan and two cities in China. The airport also served Gangneung to the south and Sokcho to the north. It was intended for the many tourists attracted by the Seorak-san national park. But, as of 2009, the airport closed due to a lack of passengers. The county is proud to unite the five major religious influences in South Korea: Confucianism, Buddhism, Shamanism, Protestantism and Roman Catholicism. There are sites for all these movements in Yangyang. The Seonghwangsa is a shamanistic altar which was traditionally used for sacrificial rites. Yangyang Hyanggyo is a Confucian school, built in 1340. Today the school mainly serves as a shrine, but some classes are still held at the site. In 1921 the Yangyang Cathedral was built. During the Korean War it was burnt to the ground, but rebuilt after. The county is also proud of its five-day market. It is the largest traditional market in the area and renowned for the quality of its produce. The market is held on days ending in 4 and 9.

He was a major figure of Cahiers du cin√©ma which he co-edited in the late 1970s. He also wrote extensively about films, television, and society in the newspaper Lib√©ration and founded the quarterly review Trafic shortly before his death. Highly regarded in French and European film criticism circles, his work remains little known to English-speaking audiences, largely because it has not been consistently translated. Biography At the Voltaire High School in Paris Lyc√©e Voltaire (Paris) , Daney received his first film teachings from Henri Agel, one of the most respected critics of the time. With two high school friends, Louis Skorecki and Claude D√©p√™che, he founded a short-lived film magazine called Visages du cin√©ma which only saw two editions, on Howard Hawks (containing Daney's first published text - a review of Rio Bravo called \\"An Adult Art\\") and on Otto Preminger. In 1964, Daney joined the French film magazine Cahiers du cin√©ma with a series of interviews of American film directors (notably Howard Hawks, Leo McCarey, Josef von Sternberg and Jerry Lewis) conducted with Jean Louis Noames (aka Louis Skorecki) during a trip to Hollywood. He writes regularly for the magazine which was moving on from its \\"yellow cover‚Äù beginnings (the time of Andr√© Bazin, Fran√ßois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, √âric Rohmer and Jacques Rivette - roughly 1951-1959) and was about to enter a period of heavy theoretical debates and radical political engagement after 1968. Between 1968 and 1971, Daney also makes a series of travels to India, Morocco and Africa and starts lecturing cinema at the Censier University (Paris III). After Cahiers‚Äô failure to create a ‚ÄúRevolutionary Cultural Front‚Äù, Daney took the responsibility of the magazine in 1973, supported by Serge Toubiana. Together, they operated a \\"return to cinema\\" for the magazine and also invited thinkers from outside the field of cinema: Michel Foucault, Jacques Ranci√®re and Gilles Deleuze. In 1981, Daney left Cahiers for the French daily newspaper Lib√©ration, to which he had contributed occasionally since its creation in 1973. Writing first about cinema, his focus turns more and more towards television. In 1987, for a hundred days, he wrote daily about French television in a column called ‚ÄúThe wage of the channel hopper‚Äù. From 1988 to 1991, he wrote a column on how films look when they are shown on television. He also wrote small pamphlets increasingly critical of television programs before he abandoned writing about television altogether in 1991, after a critical analysis of the television coverage of the Gulf War. Daney went on to found the quarterly film magazine Trafic in which he wrote four pieces before dying of AIDS in June 1992. Daney had other passions such as tennis and bullfights. Bibliography Daney published four books during his lifetime which are collections of his articles: * La Rampe (Gallimard/Cahiers du cin√©ma, 1983) * Cin√©-journal (Cahiers du cin√©ma, 1986) * Le Salaire du zappeur (P.O.L., 1988) * Devant la recrudescence des vols des sacs √† main (Al√©as, 1991) He also published a little-known book called \\"Proc√®s √† Baby Doc, Duvalier p√®re et fils\\", a 1973 polemic against the Duvalier regime in Haiti written under the pseudonym Raymond Sap√®ne. In the years after his death, several other books have been released: * L'exercice a √©t√© profitable, Monsieur (P.O.L, 1993), a collection of the notes he took while watching French television in the early 1990s. * Pers√©v√©rance (P.O.L, 1994), Daney's last project for a complete book for which he wrote the first chapter - the rest being the transcript of an interview with Serge Toubiana. It has been translated in English as Postcards from the Cinema (Berg, 2007). * L'amateur de tennis (P.O.L, 1994), a selection of articles he wrote in Liberation about tennis matches. * L‚Äôitin√©raire d'un cin√©-fils (Editions Jean-Michel Place, 1999), the transcript of the eponymous TV documentary.

In 1961 they succeeded in getting the entire upper Xingu legally protected ‚Äì the first massive indigenous area in all South America, and the prototype for dozens of similar reserves all over the continent. Pioneers The explorer John Hemming wrote that the Villas-B√¥as were pioneers in many ways. They were almost the first non-missionaries to live permanently with the natives; and they treated them as their equals and friends. They persuaded tribes to end internecine feuds and unite to confront the encroaching settlement frontier. The Villas-B√¥as were the first to appreciate the value of politics and the media in furthering the indigenous cause. They also devised a policy of \\"change, but only at the speed the Indians want\\". Robin Hanbury-Tenison, from Survival International, wrote in 1971 that \\"The Xingu is the only closed park in Brazil, which means that it is the only area in which Indians are safe from deliberate or accidental contact with undesirable representatives of Western civilization. This is due entirely to the Villas-B√¥as brothers and the total dedication of their lives to this work over the last 25 years.\\" Robin Hanbury- Tenison. Report of a visit to the Indians of Brazil on behalf of the Primitive People Fund/Survival International. London: Quintrell & Co. Ltd., Printers, Wadebridge, 1971, p. 9. Since 1971, more indigenous parks and reserves have been created, such as the Tumucumaque National Park (38,800 km¬≤) in northern Par√° state, but the Xingu park (26,400 km¬≤) remains the most important of them. The anthropologist Shelton Davis wrote that \\"The Villas-B√¥as brothers further argued that it was the responsibility of the federal government to provide a secure protective buffer, in the form of closed Indian parks and reserves, between Indians and the frontiers of national society. In time, the three brothers believed, Indians would integrate into Brazilian national society. This process of integration, however, should be a gradual one and should guarantee the Indians‚Äôs survival, ethnic identities and ways of life.\\" Shelton Davis, Victims of the miracle: development and the Indians of Brazil. Cambridge University Press, UK, 1977, p. 50. In the foreword of the book Xingu: the Indians, Their Myths the anthropologist Kenneth S. Brecher wrote that > It is now almost 30 years since the Villas-B√¥as brothers (...) led the > expedition known as 'Brazil's march to the West' which was intended to open > up the heart of the interior for colonization. They were overwhelmed by the > beauty and cultural richness of the network of Xingu tribes which they > discovered, and when the expedition disbanded they remained in the jungle to > protect the Xinguanos from the land speculators, state senators, diamond > prospectors, skin hunters, and rubber gatherers who had followed in their > wake.

Personal lives and deaths Of the 11 siblings, the three brothers banded together in their pioneering work, later supported by their younger brother Alvaro. Orlando died in 2002. When a major chief dies, the Xingu Indians hold a great funerary festival (the Kuarup) in his honour. They did this for Orlando even though he was white. He had two sons, Noel and Orlando. Claudio was born on December 8, 1916 in Botucatu, S√£o Paulo and died of a stroke in his S√£o Paulo apartment on March 1, 1998. Indians called him \\"The Father\\" and by 1994 there were 6000 Indians in 18 settlements from different tribes. Leonardo died in 1961 at age 43. √Ålvaro was born 1926 in S√£o Paulo and worked with his brothers in the Xingu area from 1961-1962.

They also received the GEO prize from the president of Germany, Richard von Weizs√§cker and the ex-Chancellor of West Germany Willy Brandt in 1984, in recognition of their humanitarian work. The two were twice nominated for the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1971 and again in 1975.Orlando Villas B√¥as, Britannica.com Matup√° Airport, in Matup√°, Mato Grosso, Brazil is named after the brother Orlando.

The series follows 17-year-old Ayato Kamina, his ability to control a mecha known as the RahXephon, and his inner journey to find a place in the world. His life as a student and artist in Tokyo is suddenly interrupted by a mysterious stalker, strange planes invading the city and strange machines fighting back. The anime was animated by Bones and it aired on Fuji TV from January to September 2002. It was produced by Fuji TV, Bones, Media Factory and Victor Entertainment. The series received critical acclaim and was subsequently translated, released on the DVD and aired in several other countries, including the United States. A 2003 movie adaptation RahXephon: Pluralitas Concentio was directed by Tomoki Kyoda, with plot changes and new scenes. The series was also spun into novels, an extra OVA episode, an audio drama, a video game, illustration books and an altered manga adaptation by Takeaki Momose. Director Izubuchi said RahXephon was his attempt to set a new standard for mecha anime, as well as to bring back aspects of 1970s mecha shows like Brave Raideen. Setting The backstory of RahXephon is a fight against multi-dimensional invaders known as Mulians (known as ). The Mu are visually indistinguishable from humans, however they carry a genetic marker called the \\"Mu phase\\" which turns their blood blue and causes some memory loss when they mature. The story reveals that two Mu floating cities appeared above Tokyo and Sendai around the end of 2012. The ensuing conflict between Mu and humans escalated into nuclear warfare, and the Mu enveloped Tokyo and the outlying suburbs within a spherical barrier resembling Jupiter, referred by outsiders as \\"Tokyo Jupiter\\" (\\"T≈çky≈ç Jupita\\"). The barrier has a time dilating effect, which causes time inside Tokyo Jupiter to slow down to one-fifth compared to the outside time, and allowed the Mu to secretly take control of Tokyo, using the area as their base of operations. The goal of the human forces outside of Tokyo Jupiter is to build up their strength to penetrate through and invade Tokyo Jupiter and stop the Mu while surviving their attacks. Although RahXephon is part of the mecha genre of anime, its \\"mechas\\" are not mechanical. The mechas, used by the Mu and called Dolems, are made out of clay, like golems. Each is bound to a certain Mulian; however, some are also bound to certain human hosts, called \\"sub-Mulians\\". The dominant theme of RahXephon is the music changing the world. The Dolems are animated by a mystical force connected to music; most of the controlling Mulians appear to be singing. A Dolem attacks while singing, and sometimes the attack is the song itself. The RahXephon can also attack by having its pilot‚Äîthe \\"instrumentalist\\"‚Äîsing a note. This unleashes force waves that cause massive destruction. Each Mulian Dolem has an Italian name referring to musical notations, such as, Allegretto, Falsetto, or Vivace. The ultimate goal of the RahXephon is to \\"tune the world.\\" Izubuchi says the name RahXephon lacked a real meaning, but that he now explains it as composed of Rah as the origin of Ra according to Churchward, X as the unknown variable or X factor, and -ephon as a suffix for instrument from \\"-phone\\". Plot The most important plot line of the series is the unusual relationship between Ayato Kamina and Haruka Shitow. Although Haruka appears to be a stranger to Ayato at first, the series reveals that they knew each other from before the beginning of the story. Ayato is a boy who was unknowingly conceived with the help of the B√§hbem Foundation living in Tokyo with his adoptive mother, Maya Kamina. Ayato had met Haruka on a trip outside of Tokyo, and they continued to see each other when they returned to school in Tokyo. At this time, Haruka's family name was Mishima. However, during what later became known as the Tokyo Jupiter incident, Haruka and her pregnant mother were away on a holiday trip while Ayato was caught inside the city. Years later, after giving birth to Haruka's sister Megumi, Haruka's mother remarried and their family name became Shitow. Meanwhile, Maya modified Ayato's memories to make him forget Haruka. The series makes clear that the entire population of Tokyo Jupiter is subject to the same kind of mental control, thinking that they are all that's left of mankind after a devastating war. Ayato is haunted by visions of Haruka, which he manifests in his art. Ixtli, RahXephon's soul, also adopts Haruka's appearance and family name (Mishima) to guide Ayato, but takes a different given name‚ÄîReika. The story begins as Tokyo comes under attack by invading aircraft while a mysterious woman, later revealed to be Haruka, stalks Ayato. By this point, Haruka has grown considerably older than Ayato and everyone else who is inside of Tokyo Jupiter because of the time dilation. Because of this and her now having a different last name, Ayato does not recognize Haruka and also initially does not fully trust her, but he gradually re-discovers his love for her as the series progresses, and he learns of everything that has happened. At the end of the series, Ayato's RahXephon merges with Quon's, allowing him to modify the past by \\"re-tuning the world\\" to make it so that he and Haruka are never separated. In the final sequence of the series, the adult Ayato is seen with his wife Haruka and their infant daughter Quon.  Characters  :This section represents the story from the television series and may differ from other works. TERRA operations and research staff At the beginning of RahXephon, Ayato Kamina is a modest 17-year-old living in Tokyo. He is an average student, who enjoys painting and spending time with his classmates Hiroko Asahina and Mamoru Torigai. He has affectionate relationship with his mother, strained by her long-hour work. During the sudden attack on Tokyo, Ayato hears the singing of his classmate Reika Mishima. She leads him to a giant egg containing the RahXephon. Haruka Shitow, an agent of the defense research agency TERRA (acronym for Tereno Empireo Rapidmova Reakcii Armeo, broken Esperanto for Earth Empire Rapid Response Army), brings Ayato and the RahXephon to their headquarters. Ayato moves in with Haruka's uncle Professor Rikudoh and pilots the RahXephon against the attacking Dolems. Quon Kisaragi, a mysterious girl living with chief researcher Itsuki, seems to share some of Ayato's artistic talent. Ernst von B√§hbem of the B√§hbem Foundation sponsors TERRA through the Federation, the successor of the United Nations. While most characters are introduced by the end of episode 7, RahXephon continues to characters development and reveals their mysteries and relationships through heavy use of foreshadowing. Dolems Dolems, or , are enormous mecha-like beings that are used as powerful weapons by the Mulians. The name \\"Dolem\\" is derived from \\"golem\\". It is also a reference to the first three notes in the C major scale, \\"Do-Re-Mi\\", and the Italian word \\"dolere\\", meaning \\"to ache\\". In RahXephon Dolems are designated by TERRA as D1. The smaller fighters Dotem (with T instead of L) are designated as D2. Dolems are made of clay, like golems, but are animated by a quasi-mystical force connected to music, as most of the controlling Mulians appear to be singing. A Dolem attacks while singing, and sometimes the attack is the song itself. Each D1 Dolem is bound to a Mulian who controls it. Some Dolems are also bound to human hosts called \\"sub-Mulians\\" or \\"Dolem hosts\\" who anchor to the Dolems in the human dimension, making it possible for the Mulian controller to take over the body of the host. These bonds are so strong that destroying a Dolem can kill both the Mulian controlling it and the human host. When destroyed, a Dolem disintegrates into blue blood and clay. =List of Dolems= *Allegretto *Fortissimo *Grave *Ritardando *Forzando *Sforzando *Larghetto *Vivace *Falsetto *Arpeggio *Alternate *Vibrato *Obbligato and Brillante *Largo =Lesser Dolems= *Metronomes and Metronomilies *Dotems *Mezzofortes *Staccato Production and media RahXephon was initially produced as a TV series. A manga version, novels, soundtracks and an audio drama were published during the original broadcast. A movie, an OVA episode, art books, and guide books were also created. Characters, mecha and story from RahXephon were featured in three video games. =TV series= Yutaka Izubuchi was a successful anime supervisor and designer focusing on costume, character and mechanical design, notably in the Gundam and Patlabor series. His friend and former Sunrise colleague Masahiko Minami, producer and president of Bones, had suggested Izubuchi to direct something. Izubuchi finally agreed and RahXephon became his first directing job. Izubuchi returned to the classic mecha shows of the 1970s and 1980s and wanted to make a show of that type updated with advances in anime production as well as adding his own personal ideas. He wanted to \\"set a new standard in the field\\" of mecha anime to show his \\"own standard\\" and capabilities as a creator-showrunner. Media Factory, Fuji TV. and Victor Entertainment joined Bones as production partners. After planning the story and designing characters and locations, a core group was expanded to a full production staff that completed the show, primarily working together -- a departure from the trend of outsourcing anime production.Making of RahXephon special feature. DVD Orchestration 7 The original music, except for the opening theme, is composed by Ichiko Hashimoto; she was initially approached to compose some of the score and replied that she wanted to compose all of it. She also plays Maya and performs the closing theme together with her sister Mayumi. The opening theme \\"Hemisphere\\" is composed by Yoko Kanno and sung by Maaya Sakamoto, who plays Reika. Hashimoto's compositions range from piano sonatas and acoustic chamber music to experimental jazz, hard rock, and ambience that crosses the border into sound design. She also includes more mainstream jazz and orchestral music played with both acoustic and electronic instruments. =Movie= A television movie version of RahXephon called Pluralitas Concentio was directed by Tomoki Kyoda, who had directed three episodes of the TV series and acted as assistant director with Soichi Masui. Izubuchi acted as Chief Director on this movie, but was not heavily involved in its production. Most of the staff members involved with the TV series worked on the movie, and it was distributed by Shochiku. The producers were Masahiko Minami, Shiro Sasaki, Maki Horiuchi, Kenji Shimizu, and Tatsuji Yamazaki. In the manga, characters differ from their anime counterparts in both visual design and characterization. The movie quickly reveals mysteries that were developed slowly in the TV series and makes changes to the plot. It begins with a prologue showing previously unseen events, followed by a couple of expository scenes. The final 30 minutes contain the most plot changes and new scenes, ending with a new epilogue. The rest of the movie consists mainly of abridged scenes from the original series, sometimes with characters replaced or with different motivations and dialogue. The link between the Kamina and Mishima families and other storylines that were prominent in the original TV series were reduced or removed. One prominent distributor promoted the movie as an \\"encore\\"‚Äîan extra performance at the end of the series, rather than as a replacement.A.D. Vision (2003) RahXephon:Pluralitas Concentio DVD cover: \\"Encore. Return to the world of RahXephon...\\" =Manga= The manga was illustrated and written by Takeaki Momose. Momose was one of the candidates for character designer on the series, but Izubuchi wanted Akihiro Yamada to do the original designs, and Hiroki Kanno got the job of adapting them for animation. With the manga Momose got the opportunity to re-design the characters into his own style and make changes in characterization and story, as well as adding \\"fan service\\". The scenario of the manga adaptation is similar to RahXephon series with some minor and major differences. In the anime series, Reika is a mysterious and distant figure; in the manga Reika is a more comical figure who grew up as Ayato's adoptive sister with a darker origin. The anime series shows Megumi competing with Haruka for Ayato's affections, while this role is taken by Reika in the manga. The rate of time dilation is also different in the manga version, as the year outside Tokyo is 2033 instead of 2027.  Reception  The anime series originally aired on stations in the Fuji Television network and its affiliates, except in the Kansai region where independent UHF stations aired it instead. Starting with episode 10, some stations moved the series from the afternoon to after midnight, but other stations moved it from late night to afternoon.T≈çkai Television Broadcasting stations: Late night: Afternoon: RahXephon thus remained both a \\"late night anime\\" and afternoon anime throughout its original run. According to its distributor, the series \\"captivated millions in Japan\\" and \\"[drew] in viewers by the tens of thousands.\\" The series won the award for best anime television series at the 7th Animation Kobe fair. It was considered popular enough that a TV movie version was commissioned and aired. Internationally, the series was translated and released on DVD. It was purchased for airing by television stations and made available on video on demand services in several countries. In the United States, the DVDs were released around the theatrical release of another Bones production, Cowboy Bebop: The Movie. The distributor claimed that RahXephon was met with \\"strong sales and extraordinary critical response in the U.S.\\" =TV series reviews= The series was generally well received by English-language reviewers. While some reviewers only judged the show on its own merits, others compared it with varying favor against shows such as Brain Powerd, Megazone 23, and Neon Genesis Evangelion. Protoculture Addicts editor Claude J. Pelletier chose RahXephon as one of the top 3 anime television series of 2002, and Miyako Matsuda agreed, noting mystery, technology, and romance. Christian Nutt of Anime Jump offered a contrary opinion: \\"RahXephon's characters fell flat and the grind of its scenario didn't inspire much curiosity, despite some initially awesome ideas\\". En Hong, on the other hand, found the characters to be skilfully developed and believable as \\"self-conscious entities and not just parts to be filled for the story to progress\\", and Charles Solomon called them \\"engaging\\". Note: Izubuchi did not actually direct or write Gasaraki but did provide designs for it. Mike Toole of Anime Jump was impressed by the music, animation and character design; as was Protoculture's Martin Ouellette. Solomon noted the \\"strikingly original mecha designs\\" and Anime Boredom's John Huxley noted the \\"unusual yet elegant\\" mecha and the \\"fluid computer- enhanced\\"‚Äîbut not CGI-looking‚Äîanimation. RahXephon's \\"brief but not unwelcome\\" comic moments went over well with Huxley, and he found the romance \\"a million miles away from the cheery antics of Love Hina or Ranma ¬Ω\\" and \\"for the most part thoroughly believable\\". Chris Beveridge of Anime on DVD found the final episodes beautiful both in visual style and story, \\"with the raw emotions coming out of it, in both languages\\". Huxley also liked the conclusion: \\"Despite falling short of the mark in a few areas this is a satisfying conclusion to a good series.\\" On the plot resolution he wrote that RahXephon \\"keeps the audience guessing right up until the final credits and beyond\\" but that \\"the clues are all there\\" for the viewer to piece together. Anime News Network columnist Zac Bertschy called RahXephon a \\"paragon of responsible storytelling (...) No loose strings are left; we see the conclusion of every character‚Äôs storyline.\\" He added that the English voice work \\"raised the bar across the board.\\" =Movie reviews= The TV movie had a more mixed reception than the TV series. Christian Nutt was not excited about the TV series but found the movie to be better: Despite \\"too much cutting and chopping\\", he wrote that \\"the creators have done the best they can with the material.\\" He added: \\"the last scene is very touching. It's a big improvement over the TV show.\\" Efrain Diaz Jr. of IGN called the movie a \\"valiant effort\\", but preferred the TV series and asked \\"why even bother with the movie?\\" Carlo Santos, writing for Anime News Network, recommended the movie both as an \\"endcap to a remarkable series\\" and as a sample for those yet to watch it. While Chris Beveridge also recommended the movie as an addition to the series, he did not recommend it as a sample for newcomers, \\"since some of the best revelations are given away so quickly...\\" Indeed, reviewers who were not familiar with the series complained about the movie's lack of coherence. Mitchell Hattaway of DVD Verdict \\"got lost about ten minutes in\\", considered the movie a waste of money for anybody but RahXephon completists and wrote that \\"Bones Animation Studio is guilty of contempt for its audience.\\" Janet Crocker of Animefringe was confused by the plot as well, but was less confused on the second viewing and looked forward to watching the TV series. She called the movie \\"intellectually refreshing and visually beautiful\\" and recommended it \\"even to non-mecha people like me\\". =Book reviews= Eduardo M. Chavez of Anime on DVD was not impressed by the first volume of the manga, especially when compared to the TV series; he rated it \\"C minus\\", though he said it could have worked as a \\"parody d≈çjinshi\\". After the disappointment of volume one, Chavez was pleasantly surprised by the story in the following volumes, and called it a \\"story that grew up with its characters\\", giving it a \\"B plus\\". The five-volume novelization was translated to English, but the other novels were not. This translation was marred by a lack of copy editing in the first volume, which was rated \\"D\\" by Santos. The situation was somewhat improved in the second volume, but reviewers did not recommend the novelization as an alternative to the animated versions -- only as a source for learning more about the characters and their internal motivations.  Comparisons with other anime  Some reviewers and the director have compared RahXephon with other anime shows. Some of these shows also have staff common with RahXephon. =Raideen the Brave= The director of RahXephon has said this series is meant to be a sort of modern-day Raideen. As such there are similarities between Raideen and RahXephon, particularly in the titular \\"robots\\". * The monsters in both shows are made from earth and rock which is brought to life. * Akira Hibiki and Ayato Kamina both have mothers who are from a race called the \\"Mu\\". This in turn means that both Akira and Ayato have Mu blood. * Akira and Ayato both \\"meld\\" into a surface in order to enter the cockpit of their respective robot. Akira enters via Reideen's forehead; Ayato can enter the RahXephon both directly and through a portal that is separate from the body of the RahXephon. *The Raideen and the RahXephon both are portrayed as intelligent, sentient beings and possess similar general aesthetics, particularly the human-like face that is covered on the sides. Both can attack with their voices, and can form a bow with arrows as well as a sword that protrudes out of their right arms. Both have appeared in the Super Robot Wars series, taking particular significance in Super Robot Wars MX where many characters note that Raideen and RahXephon are similar existences, and Brave Raideen has since been remade into Reideen. The two also appear together in Super Robot Wars: Scramble Commander the 2nd. = Neon Genesis Evangelion = While some English-language reviewers did not mention the popular mecha anime Neon Genesis Evangelion in their reviews of RahXephon, others compared the two explicitly. Some reviewers noted similarities between the series' protagonists and their style and execution of events. John Huxley noted an episode with \\"soul searching\\" sequences reminiscent of Neon Genesis Evangelion with a \\"hint of Twin Peaks\\". After reviewing the first five episodes, Mike Pinsky of DVD Verdict wrote that much of RahXephon was \\"ripped off completely\\" from Neon Genesis Evangelion and although finding it to be a good show, he ruled that \\"This Evangelion Lite tastes good enough, but is much less filling.\\" Christian Nutt of Anime Jump had seen the entire show when he wrote that \\"One of my least favorite aspects of RahXephon is its aping of Evangelion\\". In Protoculture Addicts Miyako Matsuda agreed that the shows were similar, but compared the two in RahXephon's favor: \\"it is very similar to Evangelion, but in many ways more original and exotic.\\" In the same magazine, Martin Ouellette went as far as calling RahXephon an Neon Genesis Evangelion \\"imitation\\", but was so impressed that he exclaimed \\"the imitation has surpassed the original!\\" Some reviewers favoured RahXephon because of its more active protagonist and clearer ending: \\"Like Evangelion, you have to bend and warp your brain around this thing, but unlike Evangelion, if you think about it, it all makes sense\\" wrote Zac Bertschy. Huxley praised RahXephon for including action sequences in the ending, providing \\"a more balanced experience\\". RahXephon's story and complex relationships were planned and written early in the production cycle. In contrast, Neon Genesis Evangelions director stated that he did not know how the show would end, and production was influenced by the reactions that TV executives and viewers had to previous episodes.Neon Genesis Evangelions assistant director Kazuya Tsurumaki said it was \\"like a live performance.\\" Source: Gainax PROFILE Kazuya Tsurumaki, Red Cross Book (1997), Translated by Bochan_bird Although John Oppliger suggested stronger candidates for similarities than Neon Genesis Evangelion, he thought RahXephon's similarity to Neon Genesis Evangelion was intentional: John Huxley found \\"several similarities\\" with Neon Genesis Evangelion, but wrote that there were \\"many, more significant differences\\", and concluded that RahXephon \\"deserves to be recognised outside of its comparisons to a certain Hideaki Anno animation.\\" Some dialogue in the RahXephon anime series is reminiscent of Neon Genesis Evangelion; for instance, protagonist Ayato's very first line in the show is \\"Everything is all right with the world\\", which closely resembles the line \\"All's right with the world\\" from Robert Browning's Song from Pippa Passes, which serves as the motto of Eva's secret organization Nerv. = Production connections = Anno and Izubuchi, the chief directors of each show, both designed mecha appearing in Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack (1988) and they worked together on the Cutie Honey (2004) live action movie. Izubuchi had also made some design drafts of the Evangelion units, but did not make the final designs. They gave an interview for one of the RahXephon guide books, and have a relationship that can be described as being old drinking buddies. Mitsuo Iso, a writer and key animator on Neon Genesis Evangelion, wrote and directed the RahXephon episode \\"The Children's Night\\"; Yoji Enokido wrote the screenplay for RahXephon's \\"Interested Parties\\" and Neon Genesis Evangelions \\"The Day Tokyo-3 Stood Still\\". Takeshi Honda was also an animator on both shows. Gainax was one of many companies contracted for in-between animation work on episodes 6 and 26.Japanese end credits. In-between credits were removed from the ending in certain international releases to make room for voice and translation credits. Japanese credits available online: Although no Japanese voice actors from Evangelion voiced characters in the Japanese version of RahXephon, both shows were re-dubbed into English by ADV Films, and both Allison Keith and Tiffany Grant voiced regular characters in both series. =Other anime= * AnimeNation's John Oppliger noted influences from Escaflowne, Evangelion, Revolutionary Girl Utena and \\"especially Megazone 23\\" * Charles Solomon compared the premise of RahXephon with that of Dual! Parallel Trouble Adventure, but found RahXephon to be \\"better plotted and executed\\". * Huxley found the Dolems to be \\"the star of the show with their bizarre, slightly disturbing designs\\" reminiscent of Grey. * Anime Jump reviewer Mike Toole compared RahXephon with Brain Powerd on account of the \\"excellent music\\", design and a \\"frustratingly large cast and Byzantine plot\\", but found RahXephon \\"more focused\\". He thus disagreed with his colleague, Christian Nutt, who wrote that \\"[Brain Powerd] may not be as sexy, but it features a more heartfelt and original story\\". Legacy After RahXephon, Izubuchi went back to design work. His assistant director, Tomoki Kyoda, became chief director on Eureka Seven. Mitsuo Iso went on from his experience on RahXephon to become the chief director of Denn≈ç Coil. RahXephon has been referenced by at least one other anime series, which was also produced by Bones. The character of Renge cosplays as Quon. When asked who she is dressed as, she utters \\"La-la\\", Quon's standard expression; LaLa is also the name of the magazine where Ouran first appeared. When asked whether robot anime following RahXephon had \\"lived up to the new era\\" Izubuchi answered \\"Partially yes and partially no\\" and regretted the focus being on financially safer remakes instead of on new creations.

Since the breakup of Yugoslavia, several towns and squares in the former nation have reverted their names. Numerous streets were also named after Tito, both in former Yugoslavia as well as elsewhere as an honour to a foreign dignitary. Cities formerly named after Tito A total of eight towns and cities were named after Tito. Right after World War II, four municipalities whose role in the partisan resistance movement was perceived as significant gained the adjective \\"Tito's\\" (locally Titov/Titova/Titovo), while the capital of the smallest federal republic of Montenegro was renamed Titograd (Tito's grad). After Tito's death in 1980, four more cities were added, for a total of one in each of the Yugoslav six federal republics and two autonomous provinces. These were:  * Titograd, July 13, 1946 ‚Äì April 2, 1992 ‚Äì Podgorica  * Titov Drvar, 1981‚Äì1991 ‚Äì Drvar, Canton 10, Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina  * Titova Korenica, December 5, 1945 ‚Äì February 7, 1997 ‚Äì Korenica  * Titovo U≈æice, 1946‚Äì1992 ‚Äì U≈æice * Titov Vrbas, 1983‚Äì1992 ‚Äì Vrbas, Vojvodina  * Titovo Velenje, October 10, 1981 ‚Äì July 17, 1990 ‚Äì Velenje  * Titov Veles, 1946‚Äì1996 ‚Äì Veles  * Titova Mitrovica, 1981‚Äì1992 ‚Äì Kosovska Mitrovica, Kosovo With the dissolution of Yugoslavia, each city was renamed. Streets and squares Countries in the world with streets named for Marshal Tito Many towns in the countries of former Yugoslavia and in other countries have streets and squares named after him.  * Ilirska Bistrica: Trg Mar≈°ala Tita (main square) * Jesenice: Cesta Mar≈°ala Tita * Koper: Titov trg (main square) * Logatec: Titova ulica * Ljubljana: Titova cesta (renamed to Slovenska cesta (Slovenian Avenue) in 1991); Titova cesta, a section of ≈†tajerska cesca named after Tito in 2009. After Tito street decision in Slovenia renamed to ≈†tajerska cesta. * Maribor: Titova cesta (main street), Titov most (Tito's Bridge) * Postojna: Titov trg (main square), Titova cesta * Radeƒçe: Titova ulica * Radenci: Titova cesta * Senovo: Titova cesta * Tolmin: Trg Mar≈°ala Tita (main square) * Velenje: Titov trg (main square with highest Tito's statue in the world) In 2011, 2 years after a street in Ljubljana was named after Tito, the Constitutional Court of Slovenia ruled that naming of a new street after Josip Broz Tito was unconstitutional. The court unanimously ruled that Tito symbolizes severe human rights violations, and that naming the street after him glorifies totalitarian regime and violates human dignity. Text of the decision U-I-109/10 of the Constitutional Court of Slovenia, issued on 3 October 2011, in Slovenian language: http://odlocitve.us-rs.si/usrs/us- odl.nsf/o/AB6C747BE8DF7AF3C125791F00404CF9 Naming Street After Tito Unconstitutional. Slovenia Times, 5 October 2011 http://www.sloveniatimes.com/naming-street-after-tito-unconstitutional In 2020, the Constitutional Court of Slovenia prevented the renaming of Tito's street in Radenci. In contrast to the decision about the street in Ljubljana, the street in Radenci had been named after Tito more than 40 years ago; the court decided the proposal was unreasonable and the name was to stay.

The party was populist and conservative in ideology, and considered a modern version of the Canadian social credit movement without the social credit monetary reform policy. History =Foundation= Prior to the 1982 Alberta provincial election, Speaker and another longtime Alberta Social Credit Party Socred MLA, Walt Buck, left the party and ran as Independents due to a collapse of their party and problems with organisation and leadership. The two MLAs were successfully returned as Independents to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. After election they tried to form the official opposition over but were denied by the Speaker of the Assembly who gave the two-member Alberta New Democratic Party the official opposition status. After being denied party funding, Speaker and Buck floated the idea for a new political party in 1982. The two MLAs set about trying to create a new party which began taking root in the spring of 1984. They began holding meetings across the province which they promoted under the name Alternate Government Movement. The party also hired Preston Manning as a political consultant to present draft policies at its founding meetings. The founding convention for the party was held on 23 and 24 November in Red Deer. The party selected a board of directors and elected Ray Speaker as leader by acclamation. It also selected the name Representative Party of Alberta from four options. The other three options were United Party, Free Democratic Party and the Free Citizens Alliance Party. The paperwork submitted to Elections Alberta and petitions of registration that had started before the convention were under the Political Alternative Association name. The party planned to submit a request to change the name as soon as registration was accepted by Elections Alberta. On 7 January 1985 Elections Alberta accepted the petition after it collected the signatures of over 4500 Alberta electors. =Collapse of the Alberta Political Alliance= In 1985 the Social Credit Party, the Western Canada Concept and Heritage Party of Alberta began a merger movement that resulted in the Alberta Alliance Political Association. The merger was short-lived and broke apart, collapsing the parties involved. Many candidates and supporters moved to support the Representative Party which became the primary right-wing alternative party for that election. =1986 provincial election= In the 1986 provincial election, the Representative Party ran 46 candidates in Alberta‚Äôs 83 ridings, but only its two founding MLAs were elected. The party received 36,656 votes, or 5.1% of the popular vote. =The final years of the party= After marginal success of the party in the 1986 election, Walt Buck retired and Raymond Speaker ended up crossing the floor to the Alberta Progressive Conservative Party. The Representative Party remained registered but did not run candidates in the 1989 election. It was disbanded a short time later Members elected to the 26th Legislative Assembly: Elections Alberta References See also *Representative Party of Ontario *List of Alberta political parties Provincial political parties in Alberta Political parties established in 1984 Political parties disestablished in 1989 Defunct political parties in Canada 1984 establishments in Alberta 1988 disestablishments in Alberta ","title":"Representative Party of Alberta"},{"id":"600309","text":"Arsenyev () is a town in Primorsky Krai, Russia, located about northeast of Vladivostok, the administrative center of the krai. As of the 2010 Census, its population was 56,750. It was previously known as Semyonovka (until 1952). History The history of Arsenyev begins in 1895, when the settlement of Semyonovka () was founded. The first settlement dwellers were the Old Believers. In 1901, the migrant peasants from what is now Poltava Oblast, Ukraine settled here. In 1937, the settlement was connected to the Trans- Siberian Railway by a branch-line. In 1940, the first aviation plant in the Russian Far East, which is now called Progress Arsenyev Aircraft Works, was built in Semyonovka. In 1952, Semyonovka was granted town status and renamed Arsenyev, after Vladimir Arsenyev, an explorer of the Far East, a scientist, a traveler, and a writer, who visited Semyonovka in 1912. During the Cold War, an air base existed northeast of Arsenyev at Varfolomeyevka. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is incorporated as Arsenyev Town Under Krai Jurisdiction‚Äîan administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts.Law #161-KZ As a municipal division, Arsenyev Town Under Krai Jurisdiction is incorporated as Arsenyevsky Urban Okrug.Law #178-KZ Climate Arsenyev has a dry-winter warm-summer humid continental climate (K√∂ppen climate classification: Dwb), bordering on a dry-winter hot-summer humid continental climate (K√∂ppen climate classification: Dwa). The climate of the town is characterized by a great contrast between summer and winter temperatures in comparison with the coastal Primorye. The average temperature in January is . The average temperature in July is . The absolute low recorded was , record high was . Spring is characterized by an increase of in the average daily temperature from March through April. The annual precipitation is ; the annual humidity is 71%. The soil freezes as deep as Nature Large clay deposits that are used by the local plant of construction materials are found in the town's vicinity. There are granite and basalt beds within distance from the town. The suburban flora includes Japanese Yew (Taxus cuspidata), Amur Velvet, Manchurian Walnut (Juglans mandschurica), Ermann's Birch (Betula ermannii), Eleutherococcus, Lotus (Nelumbo nucifera, a rare and very beautiful water-plant that can be found in several small lakes twelve kilometers from Arsenyev). There is a variety of fauna species in the area, including mammals, birds, and insects characteristic of Primorye. The tiger (Panthera tigris), wildcat (Felis spp.), mandarin duck (Aix galericulata), several species of unique butterflies including Catocala and species of Noctuid moth can be found. There is much snow during winter in Arsenyev, and this creates perfect conditions for skiing around the town. Arsenyev is surrounded by an almost untouched Ussuri taiga. The ecological situation in Arsenyev is more favorable in comparison with other cities and towns of the krai, due to the absence of polluting enterprises in the town and its suburbs. Economy As of 1999, the economy of the town is dominated by state enterprises. The proportion of their employees comprises two-thirds of able-bodied population. Other industries employ an additional 12,000 people. There are about 4,000 unemployed in Arsenyev. The largest enterprise of the town are Askold Shipbuilding Plant and Progress, producing generally products for defense. At present the volume of the output has been lowered due to the reduction of demand for military products. The high prices of raw materials have led to a halt in the production of umbrellas, furniture, and baby prams, that were by-products of Askold and Progress. All of this constitutes a threat to unemployment to most of the town population, which has been employed by these two plants. One possible solution to the problem is exporting military helicopters of Progress Stock Company, which have received worldwide approval. Due to the highly technical industries located there, Arsenyev is characterized by a larger proportion of specialists with higher education compared with other cities of the Krai. Tourism Arsenyev is situated between the Blue and Eastern-Blue Ranges of the Sikhote-Alin, on the right bank of the Arsenyevka river (the Ussuri's tributary). The river is 294 km (200 mi) long. The valley of the Arsenyevka river is wide. The river is the source of water for the town and for the rice plantations of the adjacent Anuchinsky District. In 1954, a dam was constructed on the Dachnaya River (the Arsenyevka's tributary). It is located in the center of Arsenyev, forming a pool with fountains. The town park is adjacent to it. This is the favorite recreation place of the town's residents. The water reservoir for the town is located on the upper reaches of the Dachnaya river. The town of Arsenyev is built on flat land. Arsenyev is an attraction primarily for lovers of mountain-skiing. There is a mountain-skiing base in Arsenyev. There is much snow in the Arsenyev area in winter. The mountain normally used for mountain skiers is from the town and rises as high as above sea level. Training for mountain-skiing beginners is available. Tourists are welcome on week-ends. You can stop at the Salyut recreation center at the foot of the mountain. =Sightseeing= There is a monument to Maxim Gorky, founded in 1958 in the public garden on Gorky Avenue. The Uvalnaya Hill displays the monument to Russian explorer Vladimir Arsenyev and his guide gol'd Dersu Uzala, built in 1972 by donations from Arsenyev's residents. In the area surrounding Arsenyev there are also many archaeological and natural monuments, acquainting visitors with the culture of the ancient tribes inhabiting these lands, with relics and endemic plants and animals. Arsenyev's History Museum was opened in 1969.

S. Faber; 25 October 1773 - 27 January 1854) was an Anglican theologian and prolific author. He was a typologist, who believed that all the world's myths were corrupted versions of the original stories in the Bible, and an advocate of Day-Age Theory. He was a contemporary of John Nelson Darby. Faber's writings had an influence on Historicism and Dispensationalism. Life Faber, eldest son of the Rev. Thomas Faber, vicar of Calverley, Yorkshire, by Anne, daughter of the Rev. David Traviss, was born at Calverley parsonage on 25 October 1773, and educated at Hipperholme Grammar School, near Halifax, where he remained until he went to Oxford. On 10 June 1789 he matriculated from University College, being then only in his sixteenth year; he was elected a scholar on 25 March following, and took his B.A. degree when in his twentieth year. On 3 July 1793 he was elected a fellow and tutor of Lincoln College. He proceeded M.A. 1796 and B.D. 1803, served the office of proctor in 1801, and in the same year as Bampton lecturer preached a discourse, which he published under the title of Hor√¶ Mosaic√¶. By his marriage, 31 May 1803, with Eliza Sophia, younger daughter of Major John Scott-Waring of Ince, Cheshire, he vacated his fellowship, and for the next two years acted as his father's curate at Calverley. In 1805 he was collated by Bishop Barrington to the vicarage of Stockton-on-Tees, which he resigned three years afterwards for the rectory of Redmarshall, also in Durham, and in 1811 he was presented by the same prelate to the rectory of Longnewton, in the same county, where he remained twenty-one years. Bishop Burgess collated him to a prebendal stall in Salisbury Cathedral in 1830, and Bishop van Mildert gave him the mastership of Sherburn Hospital in 1832, when he resigned the rectory of Longnewton. At Sherburn he devoted a very considerable part of his income to the permanent improvement of the hospital estates, and at his death left the buildings and the farms in perfect condition. His nephew Frederick William Faber converted to catholicism and also became a well known theologian and author. Views and work Throughout his career he strenuously advocated the evangelical doctrines of the necessity of conversion, justification by faith, and the sole authority of scripture as the rule of faith. By this conduct, as well as by his able writings, he obtained the friendship of Bishop Burgess, Bishop van Mildert, Bishop Barrington, the Marquis of Bath, Lord Bexley, and Dr. Routh. His work on The Origin of Pagan Idolatry, 1816, considers that all the pagan nations worshipped the same gods, who were only deified men. This began at the Tower of Babel, and the triads of supreme gods among the heathens represent the three sons of Noah. He also wrote on the Arkite Egg‚Äô and some of his views on this subject may likewise be found in his Bampton Lectures. His treatises on the Revelations and on the Seven Vials belong to the older school of prophetic interpretation, and the restoration of the French empire under Napoleon III was brought into his scheme. His books on the primitive doctrines of election and justification retain some importance. He laid stress on the evangelical view of these doctrines in opposition to the opinion of contemporary writers of very different schools, such as Vicesimus Knox and Joseph Milner. His works show some research and careful writing. He died at Sherburn Hospital, near Durham, 27 January 1854, and was buried in the chapel of the hospital on 1 February. His wife died at Sherburn House 28 November 1851, aged 75.

The Naqshbandi () or Naqshbandiyah (), is a major Sunni order of Sufism. There are many chains of Naqshbandi order but famous is Naqshbandi Golden Chain. It got its name from Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari. Naqshbandi masters trace their lineage to Abu Bakr, the first Caliph of Islam.Anna Zelkina, \\"Quest for God and Freedom: Sufi Responses to the Russian Advance in the North Caucasus\\", NYU Press (1 October 2000) . pg 77, excerpt from note 11: \\"There are some Naqshbandi branches which trace their silsila through Ali ibn Abi Taleb see Algar, 1972, pp. 191-3; al-Khani, 1308. pg 6 In Iraq, Army of the Men of the Naqshbandi Order, is fighting the Iraqi Army intending to get their country back from \\"American control\\".  Spiritual lineage criteria  In Sufism, as in any serious Islamic discipline such as jurisprudence (fiqh), Quranic recital (tajwid) and hadith, a disciple must have a master or sheikh from whom to take the knowledge, one who has himself taken it from a master, and so on, in a continuous chain of masters back to Muhammad. According to Carl W. Ernst:Carl W. Ernst, Bruce B. Lawrence, Sufi Martyrs of Love: The Chishti Order in South Asia and Beyond, Palgrave Macmillan, 2002, p. 22, , 9781403960276 This means that a Sufi master has met and taken the way from a master and that during his lifetime he has explicitly and verifiably invested the disciple‚Äîwhether in writing or in front of a number of witnesses‚Äîas a fully authorized master (murshid ma‚Äôdhun) of the spiritual path to succeeding generations of disciples. Such spiritual transmission from an unbroken line of masters is one criterion that distinguishes a true or 'connected' Sufi path (tariq muttasila), from an inauthentic or \\"dissevered\\" path (tariq munqati‚Äòa). The leader of a dissevered path may claim to be a Sufi master on the basis of an authorization given by a master in private or other unverifiable circumstance or by a figure already passed from this world, such as one of the righteous person or Muhammad or in a dream or so on. These practices only \\"warm the heart\\" (yusta‚Äônasu biha) but none meets Sufism's condition that a Sufi master must have a clear authorization connecting him with Muhammad, one that is verified by others than himself. Spreading of the order The Naqshbandi order owes many insights to Yusuf Hamdani and Abdul Khaliq Gajadwani in the 12th century, the latter of whom is regarded as the organizer of the practices and is responsible for placing stress upon the purely silent invocation.Trimingham, J. Spencer. \\"The Chief Tariqa Lines.\\" The Sufi Orders in Islam,. Oxford: Clarendon, 1971. Print It was later associated with Baha- ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari in the 14th century, hence the name of the order. The name can be interpreted as \\"engraver (of the heart)\\", \\"pattern maker\\", \\"reformer of patterns\\", \\"image maker\\", or \\"related to the image maker\\". The way is sometimes referred to as \\"the sublime sufi path\\" and \\"the way of the golden chain.\\" The path's name has changed over the years. Referring to Abu Bakr as-Siddiq, it was originally called \\"as-Siddiqiyya\\"; between the time of Bayazid al-Bistami and Abdul Khaliq al-Ghujdawani \\"at-Tayfuriyya\\"; from the time of 'Abdul Khaliq al-Ghujdawani to Shah Naqshband the \\"Khwajagan\\" or \\"Hodja\\"; from the time of Shah Naqshband and on \\"an-Naqshbandiyya\\". Afterwards, a branch or sub-order name was added. From 'Ubeydullah Ahrar to Imam Rabbani, the way was called \\"Naqshbandiyya-Ahrariyya\\"; from Imam Rabbani to Shamsuddin Mazhar \\"Naqshbandiyya-Mujaddadiyya\\"; from Shamsuddin Mazhar to Mawlana Khalid al-Baghdadi \\"Naqshbandiyya-Mazhariyya\\"; from Mawlana Khalid onwards \\"Naqshbandiyya-Khalidiyya\\"; \\"Naqshbandiyya-Mustafvi\\" (Khalidi) and so on.Sel√ßuk Eraydƒ±n, Tasavvuf ve Tarikatlar, p. 434 The way or school connected to the late Shaykh Sultan ul-Awliya Moulana Sheikh Nazim, who lived in Northern Cyprus, is undoubtedly the most active of all Naqshbandi orders with followers in almost every corner of the World. It is referred to as the \\"Naqshbandi-Haqqani\\" way. According to some estimates there are over sixty million disciples, and centres in almost every country of the world. It also had the largest internet presence. There are disciples in almost all of Europe including the United Kingdom, Germany, and France, and in the United States of America, the Middle East, Africa, India, Bangladesh, China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Latin America, etc. It is most active in Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. As well as being the most prevalent Sufi Order in the west. The Prince of Malaysia, Raja Ashman Shah was a disciple of this order. =South Asia= Aurangzeb was a member of the Naqshbandi Sufi order. The Naqshbandiyya order became an influential factor in Indo-Muslim life and for two centuries it was the principal spiritual order in the Indian Subcontinent. Baqi Billah Berang (No. 24 in the Naqshbandi-Haqqani Golden Chain) is credited for bringing the order to India during the end of the 16th century. He was born in Kabul and brought up and educated in Kabul and Samarqand, where he came in contact with the Naqshbandiyya order through Khawaja Amkangi. When he came to India, he tried to spread his knowledge about the order, but died three years later. Among his disciples were Sheikh Ahmad Sirhindi (No. 25 in the Naqshbandi-Haqqani Golden Chain) and Sheikh Abdul Haq of Delhi. After his death, his student, Sheikh Ahmad primarily took over. Sheikh Ahmad was born in 1561 and his father Makhdum Abdul Ahad was from a high Sufi order. He completed his religious and secular studies at the age of 17. Later he became known as Mujaddad-i-Alf-i-Thani. It was through him that the order gained popularity within a short period of time.Haq, Muhammad M. Some Aspects of the Principle Sufi Orders in India. Bangladesh: Islamic Foundation, 1985. Print. Sheikh Ahmad broke away from earlier mystic traditions and propounded his theory of the unity of the phenomenal world. In particular, he spoke out against innovations introduced by Sufis. For instance, he opposed Emperor Akbar's views on Hindu and Muslim marriages. He stated, \\"Muslims should follow their religion, and non-Muslims their ways, as the Qur'an enjoins 'for you yours and for me my religion. Also he did not believe in keeping the state and ruler separate and worked hard to change the outlook of the ruling class. After his death, his work was continued by his sons and descendants. In the 18th century Shah Wali Allah played an important role in the religious sciences, particularly the hadith and translated the Qur'an into Persian. He also looked at a fresh interpretation of Islamic teachings in the light of the new issues. Furthermore, he played a significant role in the political developments of the period. During the 19th century two Naqshbandiyya saints made significant contributions to the chain (silsila) by restating some of its basic ideological postures Currently the South Asian region's most widespread branch of the Naqshbandi Tariqah is the Mujaddidi branch. Maulana Shams ur Rahman Al Abbasi, a well known scholar, has been actively illuminating the lives of thousands. His Senior most deputy Shaykh Humayun Hanif Naqshbandi Mujaddidi is amongst one of the eminent Sufi Shaykhs of Silsisla Aaliya Naqshbandia. Shaikhu-t-Tareeqah wa Sharee'ah Mawlana Muhammad Qawmaru-z-Zamaan AllahabadI, Shaykh Muhammad Mohsin Munawar Yousafi Naqshbandi Mujaddidi and Peer Zulfiqar Ahmad Naqshbandi are the leading sheikh's in spreading the silsilah in the region and has more than 250 deputies to aid in that effort. In Pakistan Noor Muhammad Curahi and his son Faqir Muhammad curahi from curah sharif near kohat led the chain in 20th century. They have more than 70 deputies including Pir Ghulam Nabi Hashmi, Pir Jamat Ali Shah and Pir jamat Ali lasani, Pir karmanwala, Pir Sharaqpuri and Eidgah sharif and many more. =Syria and Palestine= The Naqshbandiyya was introduced into Syria at the end of the 17th century by Murad Ali al-Bukhari, who was initiated in India. Later, he established himself in Damascus, but traveled throughout Arabia. His branch became known as the Muradiyya. After his death in 1720, his descendants formed the Muradi family of scholars and sheikhs who continued to head the Muradiyya. In 1820 and onward, Khalid Shahrazuri rose as the prominent Naqshbandi leader in the Ottoman world. After the death of Khalid in 1827, his order became known as the Khalidiyya, which continued to spread for at least two decades. In Syria and Lebanon, the leaders of every active Naqshbandiyya group acknowledged its spiritual lineage, which had retained the original Naqshbandiyya way. Later a strife between Khalid's khalifas led to disruption of the order, causing it to divide. When political leader Musa Bukhar died in 1973, the pre-Mujaddidi line of the Naqshbandiyya in Greater Syria came to an end. One of the only branches to have survived till recently is the one based in the khanqah al-Uzbakiyya in Jerusalem. The number of its members had increased at the end of the 19th century. The Farmadiyya branch, which practices silent and vocal invocation, is still present in Lebanon and is named after Ali-Farmadi. We shall speak about the Great Grandsheikh Abdullah Fa'izi ad-Daghestani (d. 1973), and quote a small passage from his Biography written by Sheikh Hisham Kabbani: It was in Damascus, Syria, that Grandsheikh Abdullah Fa'izi ad-Daghestani, preached from, and also died. His blessed tomb is to be found in Damascus. It is estimated that a massive crowd of about 400,000 people attended his funeral (see Sheikh Hisham Kabbani's book on the Forty Grandsheikhs of the Naqshbandi Sufi path ). Lately the Naqshbandi Haqqani Sufi Order was led by his successor Nazim Al-Haqqani and might still be very active in Syria. =Dagestan, Russia= Naqshbandi silsilah beginning from Muhammad is passed in chain till Ismail Kurdumeri (who is No. 31 in the Naqshbandi-Haqqani Golden Chain). After Ismail Kurdumeri the chain has split in two as he had two Ma'zuns, i.e. Muhammad Salih Shirwani (No. 32) and Khas Muhammad Shirwani. From Khas Muhammad Shirwani the chain goes to Muhammad Yaraghi ad-Daghestani (in Daghestan), and from him to Jamaluddin al-Ghumuqi ad-Daghestani, who had three Ma'zuns, i.e. Mamadibir ar-Rochi ad-Daghestani, Imam Shamil ad-Daghestani (both had no Ma'zun), and 'Abdurrahman Abu Ahmad as- Sughuri ad-Daghestani. According to Shuaib Afandi Bagini ad-Daghestani, 'Abdurrahman as-Sughuri had two ma'zuns, i.e. Muhammad Haji 'Obodi ad- Daghestani and Ilyas Tsudakhari ad-Daghestani (d. 1312 AH). Both had no ma'zuns, and thus the split chain coming from Khas Muhammad Shirwani has ended here.. There are strict requirements as to who gives the permission, how it is given and received. The chain from Muhammad Salih Shirwani (No32) on the other hand, is continuous and goes all the way to Mahmud Afandi, Hasan Hilmi Afandi and the rest of the Daghestani Ma'zuns.Tariqas in Dagestan This reference actually contradicts, rather than supports, this entire paragraph The Naqshbandi Haqqani Sufi Order has roots in Dagestan through Muhammad al- Madani, the successor of Abu Ahmad as-Sughuri and his successor Abdullah Fa'izi ad-Daghestani and his successor and Grandshaykh of the order Nazim al- Haqqani. A Khanaqah (prayer house) of Naqshbandi in Saqqez's bazaar- Iran. =Egypt= During the middle of the 19th century Egypt was inhabited and controlled by Naqshbandis. A major Naqshbandi khanqah was constructed in 1851 by Abbas I, who did this as a favor to Naqshbandi sheikh Ahmad Ashiq. Ahmad Ashiq headed the order till his death in 1883. Ahmad Ashiq's was a practicer of the Diya'iyya branch of the Khalidiyya. In 1876 sheikh Juda Ibrahim amended the original Diya‚Äôiyya, which became known as al-Judiyya, and gained a following in al-Sharqiyya province in the eastern Nile Delta.Jong, Frederick De. Sufi Orders in Ottoman and Post-Ottoman Egypt and the Middle East: Collected Studies. Istanbul: Isis, 2000. Print. During the last two decades of the 19th century two other versions of Naqshbandiyya spread in Egypt. One of these was introduced by a Sudanese, alSharif Isma'il al-Sinnari. Al-Sinnari had been initiated into the Khalidiyya and Mujaddidiyya by various sheikhs during his time in Mecca and Medina. Initially, he tried to obtain a following in Cairo but was not able to, therefore he resorted going to Sudan. It is from there that the order spread into Upper Egypt from 1870 onward under Musa Mu‚Äôawwad, who was al-Sinnari's successor. Muhaamad al-Laythi, son of al- Sinnari, was the successor after Mu‚Äôawwad's death. The Judiyya and the Khalidiyya branches spread in the last decades of the 19th century and continued to grow and are still active today. Khalidiyya of Muhammad Amin al- Kurdi is headed by his son Najm a-Din. The Judiyya split into three main branches:one led by the founder's son Isa, another led by Iliwa Atiyya in Cairo, and another led by Judah Muhammad Abu‚Äôl-Yazid al-Hahdi in Tanta. Unfortunately, none of the early orders survived far into the 20th century. The longest living group of khanqah based Naqshbandis lived in the khanqah of sheikh Ahmad Ashiq, which closed in 1954. This is when all the khanqahs in Egypt were closed and the awqaf supporting these establishments were taken over by the Ministry of Awqaf. The buildings were either assigned a different function or demolished as part of urban renovation programs. =China= Ma Laichi's mausoleum (Hua Si Gongbei) in Linxia City, is the earliest and most important Naqshbandi monument in China. Ma Laichi brought the Naqshbandi (ŸÜŸÇÿ¥ÿ®ŸÜÿØŸäÿ©) Á¥çÂÖã‰ªÄÁè≠Ëø™ order to China, creating the Khufiyya (ÿÆŸÅŸäŸá) ËôéÂ§´ËÄ∂ Hua Si Sufi ÂçéÂØ∫; (\\"Multicolored Mosque\\") menhuan. Ma Mingxin, also brought the Naqshbandi order, creating the Jahriyya (ÿ¨Ÿáÿ±Ÿäÿ©) Âì≤Ëµ´ÊûóËÄ∂ menhuan. These two menhuan were rivals, and fought against each other which led to the Jahriyya Rebellion, Dungan revolt, and Dungan Revolt (1895). Some Chinese Muslim Generals of the Ma Clique belonged to Naqshbandi Sufi menhuan including Ma Zhan'ao and Ma Anliang of the Khufiyya Naqshbandi menhuan. Ma Shaowu, and Ma Yuanzhang were other prominent leaders from the Jahriyya Naqshbandi menhuan. Many disciples of the Naqshbandi Haqqani Sufi Order remain in China today. Prominent sheikhs =Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari= Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari (1318‚Äì1389) was the founder of the Sufi Naqshbandi Order. He was born in the village of Qasr-i-Arifan near Bukhara. =Ahmad Sirhindi= Shrine of Islamic Naqshbandi saints of Allo Mahar Sharif Shaykh Ahmad al-Far≈´qƒ´ al-Sirhindƒ´ (1564‚Äì1624) was considered a Mujaddid and a leading Naqshbandi Sheikh from India. He was from an ashraf family claiming descent from caliph Umar, he received most of his early education from his father, Shaykh 'Abd al-Ahad and memorised the Qur'an. He was trained in all Sufi orders by the age of 17 and was given permission to initiate and train followers in the Naqshbandi Order. Sheikh Ahmad made revolutionary changes to the Mughal empire. He persuaded Jahangir to disallow drinking alcohol and destruction of pubs and clubs. He made the Emperor revert the rule of exemption of sacrificing cows. Instead, religious conferences and meetings for spiritual development (known as halqas) were held throughout the territory. Aside from this, Sheikh Ahmad wrote several letters to his murideen (pupils) and khulafa in Turkish and Arabic. These letters are a marvelous collection of spiritual knowledge and religious information. Later these were collected and preserved in book form by Dr. Ghulam Mustafa Khan, and translated to Urdu by Syed Zawar Hussain Shah. This book is known as Maktoobat, and, as Ghulam Mustafa says, is the best and most knowledgeable book after Quran and Hadith and are applicable for all problems to rise within 1000 years. For this purpose, Sheikh Ahmad is known as Mujaddid Alif Sani. Sheikh Ahmad's three sons died in a plague, all religious and spiritually well developed. These included Muhammad Sadiq, Muhammad Farrukh and Muhammad Isa, his favorite son being Muhammad Sadiq, the eldest. His death caused Sheikh Ahmad immense sorrow, but he says that bearing this pain of loss gave him so many divine rewards that he'd have been not given them for any other deed. Practices = Criteria of a sheikh = The Golden Chain of the Sufi Naqshbandi Order, containing the names of the 40 respected Sufi Grand Masters of the Order. The following would always apply to genuine Sufi Naqshbandi teachers or sheikhs: * They comply with the law. * They must adhere to the Sunnah. * They must be scholars. There can be no Sufism without knowledge. * They must not engage in Bid'ah (religious innovation). They accept interaction with other disciples of the order. * They do not accept personal certification of dead persons, or in dreams, or through special spiritual experience (rawhani). There are exceptions to this rule according to the uwaisi concept of transmission where someone who lived before can train and transmit knowledge to someone who came later. * They only accept written personal certification in the presence of witnesses. =11 principal teachings= 11 Principles of Naqshbandiyya Known as the Eleven Naqshbandi principles, the first eight were formulated by Abdul Khaliq Gajadwani, and the last three were added by Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari. * Remembrance (Yaad kard ‚Äì Persian: €åÿßÿØ ⁄©ÿ±ÿØ): Always orally and mentally repeating the dhikr. * Restraint (Baaz gasht ‚Äì Persian: ÿ®ÿßÿ≤⁄Øÿ¥ÿ™ ): Engaging in the heart repetition of the al-kalimat at-tayyiba phrase ‚Äì \\"La-ilaha il-allah muhammadur rasul-allah\\". * Watchfulness (Nigaah daasht ‚Äì Persian: ŸÜ⁄ØÿßŸá ÿØÿßÿ¥ÿ™): Being conscientious over wandering thoughts while repeating Al-kalimat at-tayyiba. * Recollection (Yaad daasht ‚Äì Persian: ŸäÿßÿØ ÿØÿßÿ¥ÿ™): Concentration upon the Divine presence in a condition of dhawq, foretaste, intuitive anticipation or perceptiveness, not using external aids. * Awareness while breathing (Hosh dar dam ‚Äì Persian: ŸáŸàÿ¥ ÿØÿ± ÿØŸÖ): Controlling one's breathing by not exhaling or inhaling in the forgetfulness of the Divine. * Journeying in one's homeland (Safar dar vatan - Persian ÿ≥ŸÅÿ± ÿØÿ± Ÿàÿ∑ŸÜ): An internal journey that moves the person from having blameworthy to praiseworthy properties. This is also referred to as the vision or revelation of the hidden side of the shahada. * Watching one's step (Nazar bar qadam): Do not be distracted from purpose of the ultimate journey. * Solitude in a crowd (Khalwat dar anjuman): Although journey is outwardly in this world, it is inwardly with God. * Temporal pause (Wuquf-I zamani): Keeping account of how one spends his or her time. If time is spent rightfully give thanks and time is spent incorrectly ask for forgiveness. * Numerical pause (Wuquf-I adadi): Checking that the dhikr has been repeated in odd numbers. * Heart pause (Wuquf-I qalbi): Forming a mental picture of one's heart with the name of God engraved to emphasize that the heart has no consciousness or goal other than God. =Types of concentration= Muraqaba Muraqaba is known as spiritual communion. In this practice one tries to unveil the mystery of life by losing oneself in it. One imagines his heartbeats calling out the name of the almighty. It is highly believed that it is true that our heart calls out for Allah with every beat. But it is our hearts which are draped by sins and so the heartbeat is heard as dhak dhak and not Allah Allah. Muraqaba is done by sitting in a lonely place with eyes closed and maintaining a calm position, imagining your exterior eyes closed, interior eyes opened, (zahiri aankhen band krke batini aankhain kholiye) your heart calling out for Allah, and trying to hear the word 'Allah' in each and every heartbeat. Tawajjuh Tawajjuh is derived from wajh (face) and is used in Islam in relation to the act of facing the point of adoration during ritual prayer. In Naqshbandƒ´ usage there are four different forms of this orientation (Tawajjuh): * The Murid facing God: the Murid directs his heart and his thoughts towards AllƒÅh * The Murid facing his heart: the Murid concentrates on the presence of Allah in his own heart * The Murƒ´d facing his Shaykh: the Murid seeks to receive teaching from his Shaykh * The Shaykh facing his Murƒ´d. the Shaykh transmits teaching to the Murid.

Keddy is a former Christmas tree grower, and offshore drill operator and was a Member of Parliament from 1997 to 2015, first sitting with the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada and latterly with its successor the Conservative Party of Canada. Keddy was chair of The Standing Committee on Fisheries, and later long time Parliamentary Secretary for International Trade, Atlantic Canada Opportunities, and then National Revenue and Agriculture. His wife, Judy Streatch, is a former Nova Scotia MLA and cabinet minister. Life and political career Keddy was born in Bridgewater, Nova Scotia. He graduated from Acadia University in 1975 with a Bachelor of Arts in History. He was a member of the House of Commons of Canada, representing the riding of South Shore from 1997 to 2004, and South Shore‚ÄîSt. Margaret's from 2004 to 2015. He was a member of the Progressive Conservative Party before 2004, and then joined the Conservative Party of Canada. He served as the Whip and the Deputy Whip of the Progressive Conservative Party, and as critic of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Natural Resources, Fisheries and Oceans, Public Accounts, Parliamentary Affairs, and Library of Parliament. As a member of Stephen Harper's caucus, he served as the Chairman of the Commons Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans. On October 10, 2007, Keddy was appointed Parliamentary Secretary for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency and has subsequently also served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of International Trade and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture and to the Minister of National Revenue.http://www.parl.gc.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/Gerald- Keddy(91)/Roles He also served as a school board trustee in New Ross, Nova Scotia. Keddy did not stand for re-election in 2015 and retired from parliament. Same sex marriage He was one of only a handful of Conservative MPs to support same-sex marriage. His stance on this issue cost him votes in the western portion of his riding in the 2006 Canadian federal election, including some to Christian Heritage Party candidate Jim Hnatiuk who ran specifically to protest Keddy's stance on this issue. However, an evenly split opposition (Liberal and New Democrat rivals came within 60 votes of each other) and rising Green Party also split his opposition's vote. Lighthouses Keddy's riding included many historic lighthouses and is in fact known as the \\"Lighthouse Route\\". In 2006, he sponsored in the House of Commons a bill which had emerged from the Senate, the Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act, until Parliament was prorogued in 2007. Keddy supported the Act when it was re-introduced by MP Larry Miller in 2008, which led to Royal Assent on May 29, 2008.

The name of the locale derives from the mid-19th century inn operated by the family of George Chancellor at the intersection of the Orange Turnpike and Orange Plank Road. The Battle of Chancellorsville occurred there during the American Civil War in May 1863, and the Battle of the Wilderness was fought nearby in May 1864. During the 1863 battle, Lt. Gen. Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson was wounded by friendly fire, dying eight days later on May 10, 1863, from pneumonia. Portions of both the Chancellorsville and Wilderness battlefields are protected within Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park, although both battlefields have come under threat from development in recent years. The site of the Chancellorsville Inn, where Union Gen. Joseph Hooker had his headquarters during the 1863 battle, is preserved in the national military park, as is the site of Jackson's wounding.

Adolf Hitler reluctantly agreed to allow recruitment of Soviet citizens in the Rear Areas during Operation Barbarossa. In a short period of time, many of them were moved to combat units. Overview In late 1942, Hiwis comprised 50 percent of the 2nd Panzer Army's 134 Infantry Division, while the 6th Army at the Battle of Stalingrad was composed of 25 percent Hiwis. By 1944, their numbers had grown to 600,000. Both men and women of the Soviet Union were recruited. Veteran Hiwis were practically indistinguishable from the regular German troops, and often served in entire company strengths. Between September 1941 and July 1944 the SS employed thousands of collaborationist auxiliary police recruited as Hiwis directly from the Soviet POW camps. After training, they were deployed for service with Nazi Germany in the General Government and the occupied East. In one instance, the German SS and police inducted, processed, and trained 5,082 Hiwi guards before the end of 1944 at the SS training camp division of the Trawniki concentration camp set up in the village of Trawniki southeast of Lublin. They were known as the \\"Trawniki men\\" () and were former Soviet citizen, mostly Ukrainians. Trawnikis were sent to all major killing sites of the \\"Final Solution\\", which was their primary purpose of training. They took an active role in the executions of Jews at Be≈Ç≈ºec, Sobibor, Treblinka II, Warsaw (three times), Czƒôstochowa, Lublin, Lvov, Radom, Krak√≥w, Bia≈Çystok (twice), Majdanek as well as Auschwitz, and Trawniki itself. Use of term SS Trawniki men before the corpses of Jews in the doorway of the Warsaw Ghetto. Photo from J√ºrgen Stroop Report, May 1943. The term 'Hiwis' acquired a thoroughly negative meaning during World War II when it entered into several other languages in reference to Ostlegionen as well as volunteers enlisted from occupied territories for service in a number of roles including hands-on shooting actions and guard duties at extermination camps on top of regular military service, drivers, cooks, hospital attendants, ammunition carriers, messengers, sappers, etc. In the context of World War II the term has clear connotations of collaborationism, and in the case of the occupied Soviet territories also of anti-Bolshevism (widely presented as such by the Germans). German historian wrote that there were many different reasons why Soviet citizens volunteered. He argues that the issue has to be seen first and foremost with the German Vernichtungskrieg (war of annihilation) policy in mind. For example, volunteering allowed Soviet POWs to get out of the barbaric German POW camp system, giving them a much higher chance of survival. During World War II, Nazi Germany engaged in a policy of deliberate maltreatment of Soviet POWs, in contrast to their treatment of British and American POWs. This resulted in some 3.3 to 3.5 million deaths, or 57% of all Soviet POWs.Peter Calvocoressi, Guy Wint, Total War ‚Äì \\"The total number of prisoners taken by the German armies in the USSR was in the region of 5.5 million. Of these, the astounding number of 3.5 million or more had been lost by the middle of 1944 and the assumption must be that they were either deliberately killed or done to death by criminal negligence. Nearly two million of them died in camps and close on another million disappeared while in military custody either in the USSR or in rear areas; a further quarter of a million disappeared or died in transit between the front and destinations in the rear; another 473,000 died or were killed in military custody in Germany or Poland.\\" They add, \\"This slaughter of prisoners cannot be accounted for by the peculiar chaos of the war in the east. ... The true cause was the inhuman policy of the Nazis towards the Russians as a people and the acquiescence of army commanders in attitudes and conditions which amounted to a sentence of death on their prisoners.\\"Christian Streit: Keine Kameraden: Die Wehrmacht und die Sowjetischen Kriegsgefangenen, 1941‚Äì1945, Bonn: Dietz (3. Aufl., 1. Aufl. 1978), ‚Äì \\"Between 22 June 1941 and the end of the war, roughly 5.7 million members of the Red Army fell into German hands. In January 1945, 930,000 were still in German camps. A million at most had been released, most of whom were so-called ‚Äòvolunteers‚Äô (Hilfswillige) for (often compulsory) auxiliary service in the Wehrmacht. Another 500,000, as estimated by the Army High Command, had either fled or been liberated. The remaining 3,300,000 (57.5 percent of the total) had perished.\\"Nazi persecution of Soviet Prisoners of War United States Holocaust Memorial Museum ‚Äì \\"Existing sources suggest that some 5.7 million Soviet army personnel fell into German hands during World War II. As of January 1945, the German army reported that only about 930,000 Soviet POWs remained in German custody. The German army released about one million Soviet POWs as auxiliaries of the German army and the SS. About half a million Soviet POWs had escaped German custody or had been liberated by the Soviet army as it advanced westward through eastern Europe into Germany. The remaining 3.3 million, or about 57 percent of those taken prisoner, were dead by the end of the war.\\"Jonathan North, Soviet Prisoners of War: Forgotten Nazi Victims of World War II ‚Äì \\"Statistics show that out of 5.7 million Soviet soldiers captured between 1941 and 1945, more than 3.5 million died in captivity.\\" Therefore it becomes very difficult to differentiate between a genuine desire to volunteer, and seeming to volunteer in the hope of a better chance of surviving the war. A captured Hiwi told his People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (', or NKVD) interrogators: Soviet authorities referred to the Hiwis as \\"former Russians\\" regardless of the circumstances of their joining or their fate at the hands of the NKVD secret police. After the war, thousands attempted to return to their homes in the USSR. Hundreds were captured and prosecuted, charged with treason and therefore guilty of enlistment from the start of judicial proceedings. Most were sentenced to the Gulags, and released under the Khrushchev amnesty of 1955. The reliance upon Hiwis exposed a gap between Nazi ideologues and pragmatic German Army commanders. Nazi leaders including Adolf Hitler regarded all Slavs as Untermenschen and therefore of limited value as volunteers also. On the other hand, the manpower was needed, and German Intelligence had recognised the need to divide the Soviet nationals. The contradiction was sometimes disguised by reclassification of Slavs as Cossacks. Colonel Helmuth Groscurth (Chief of Staff, XI Corps) wrote to General Beck: \\"It is disturbing that we are forced to strengthen our fighting troops with Russian prisoners of war, who are already being turned into gunners. It's an odd state of affairs that the \\"Beasts\\" we have been fighting against are now living with us in closest harmony.\\" The Hiwis may have constituted one quarter of 6th Army's front-line strength, amounting to over 50,000 Slavic auxiliaries serving with the German troops.

Built in 1784, the cotton mill is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. The National Trust, which runs the site as a museum, calls it \\"one of Britain's greatest industrial heritage sites, home to a complete industrial community\\". Quarry Bank Mill was established by Samuel Greg, and was notable for innovations both in machinery and also in its approach to labour relations, largely as a result of the work of Greg's wife, Hannah Lightbody. The relationship between owners and employees is explored in the 2013 television series The Mill. Location Quarry Bank Mill is on the outskirts of Styal in Cheshire, abutting and to the south of Manchester Airport. The mill is on the bank of the River Bollin which provided water to power the waterwheels. It was connected by road to the Bridgewater Canal for transporting raw cotton from the port of Liverpool. The site consisted of three farms or folds. It is about a kilometre away from Styal railway station. History Samuel Greg leased land at Quarrell Hole on Pownall Fee from Lord Stamford, who imposed a condition that 'none of the surrounding trees should be pruned, felled or lopped¬¥; maintaining the woodland character of the area. The factory was built in 1784 by Greg to spin cotton. When Greg retired in 1832 it was the largest such business in the United Kingdom. The water-powered Georgian mill still produces cotton calico. The Gregs were careful and pragmatic, paternalistic millowners, and the mill was expanded and changed throughout its history. When Greg's son, Robert Hyde Greg, took over the business, he introduced weaving. Samuel Greg died in 1834. The Mill was attacked during the Plug Plot riots on 10 August 1842. The mill's iron water wheel, the fourth to be installed, was designed by Thomas Hewes and built between 1816 and 1820. Overhead shafts above the machines were attached to the water wheel by a belt. When the wheel turned, the motion moved the belt and powered the machinery. A beam engine and a horizontal steam engine were subsequently installed to supplement the power. The Hewes wheel broke in 1904 but the River Bollin continued to power the mill through two water turbines. The mill owners bought a Boulton and Watt steam engine in 1810 and a few years later purchased another because the river's water level was low in summer and could interrupt production of cloth during some years. Steam engines could produce power all year round. Today the mill houses the most powerful working waterwheel in Europe, an iron wheel moved from Glasshouses Mill at Pateley Bridge designed by Sir William Fairbairn who had been Hewes' apprentice. The estate surrounding the mill was developed and Greg converted farm buildings in Styal to house workers. As the mill increased in size, housing was constructed for the workers. A chapel and a school were built by the Gregs who moved into Quarry Bank House next to the mill. The estate and mill were donated to the National Trust in 1939 by Alexander Carlton Greg and are open to the public. The mill continued in production until 1959. In 2006 the National Trust acquired Quarry Bank House and its gardens and, in 2010, the gardener's house and the upper gardens.National Trust Magazine, Spring 2013 In 2013 the mill received 130,000 visitors. In 2013, the trust launched an appeal to raise ¬£1.4 million to restore a worker's cottage, a shop and the Greg's glasshouses and digitise records relating to Gregs and the mill workers.BBC News: Project to restore Quarry Bank Mill in Cheshire (accessed 12 February 2013) In 2020, the Trust was working on a plan to include coverage about the owners of its properties who had links to colonialism and slavery, including this estate which has links to the slave owning cotton plantations in the Americas. Visitors will find information about the \\"histories of slavery and colonialism\\". National Trust hastens projects exposing links of country houses to slaveryAddressing the histories of slavery and colonialism at the National TrustQuarry Bank Mill, Styal, Cheshire Architecture Front elevation of Quarry Bank Mill Quarry Bank is an example of an early, rural, cotton-spinning mill that was initially dependent on water power. The first mill was built by Samuel Greg and John Massey in 1784. Its design was functional and unadorned, growing out of the pragmatism of the men who felt no need to make a bold architectural statement. It was a four-storey mill measuring by , with an attached staircase, counting house and warehouse. It was designed to use water frames which had just come out of patent, and the increased supply of cotton caused by the cessation of the American War of Independence. The water wheel was at the north end of the mill. The mill was extended in 1796 when it was doubled in length and a fifth floor added. A second wheel was built at the southern end. The mill was extended between 1817 and 1820 and a mansard-roofed wing extended part of the 1796 building forward beneath which the wheel was installed. The new building kept the 1784 detailing with respect to line and windows. The 1784 mill ran 2425 spindles, after 1805 with the new wheel it ran 3452 spindles. Weaving sheds were added in 1836 and 1838 and they were of two storeys and housed 305 looms. Before the 1830s, spinning mills produced cotton, that was put-out to hand-loom weavers who worked in their own homes or small loom shops, like the one Greg owned at Eyam. Hand-loom weaving continued in parallel to power loom weaving throughout the 19th century. Around 1830 the power loom became sufficiently viable for independent weaving sheds to be set up, and for larger owners to add weaving sheds to their spinning mills. A weaving shed needed the correct light and humidity and a floor that was stable enough to withstand the vibration caused by the picking of many looms. Quarry Bank Mill is of national significance in that it used two-storey side-lit buildings rather the a single storey sheds with a saw-tooth roof. The first two-storey shed at Quarry Bank was by . The 1838 building was by to which a storey was added in 1842 for warping and beaming. In the Gregs pragmatic way, looms were purchased gradually. =Water power= The first wheel was a wooden overshot wheel taking water by means of a long leat from upstream on the River Bollin. The second wheel built by Peter Ewart in 1801 was wooden. To increase power he dammed the Bollin and took water into the mill directly, the tailrace leaving the river below the dam. The third wheel of 1807 was a replacement for one of the wooden wheels. It is believed it was a suspension wheel, in diameter made from iron to the design of Thomas Hewes. The fourth wheel, the Great Wheel was also designed by Hewes. The challenge was to increase the head of water acting on the wheel while using the same volume of water. It was achieved by sinking the wheel pit to below the level of the river and taking the tail race through a tunnel a kilometre downstream to rejoin the Bollin at Giant's Castle. This gave a head of acting on the diameter suspension wheel- which is wide. The Great Wheel operated from 1818 to 1871 when the mill pool had silted up, and then to 1904. In 1905 two water turbines built by Gilbert Gilkes and Company were installed to replace the Great Wheel. They used the same head and tail race and operated until 1959. When the mill was restored in 1983, a diameter waterwheel of similar design to that of Hewes by his pupil Sir William Fairbairn, was moved from Glasshouses Mill in Pateley Bridge and installed to provide power to work the machinery. =Steam power= Water flow from the Bollin was unreliable so an auxiliary steam engine was procured in 1810. It was a 10 hp beam engine from Boulton and Watt. In 1836 with the arrival of power looms a second 20 hp Boulton and Watt beam engine was acquired. The first horizontal condensing engine was acquired in 1871. A new engine house was built. In 1906 the 1871 engine was replaced by a second-hand 60 hp engine. The engines no longer exist and the museum has purchased a similar steam engine to display. Apprentice system The Apprentice House Quarry Bank Mill employed child apprentices, a system that continued until 1847. The last child to be indentured started work in 1841. The first children apprentices lived in lodgings in the neighbourhood then in 1790 Greg built the Apprentice House near the factory. Greg believed he could get the best out of his workers by treating them fairly. He hired a superintendent to attend to their care and morals and members of the Greg family and external tutors gave them lessons. Greg employed Peter Holland, father of the Royal Physician Sir Henry Holland, 1st Baronet and uncle of Elizabeth Gaskell, as mill doctor. Holland was responsible for the health of the children and other workers, and was the first doctor to be employed in such a capacity. The apprentices were children from workhouses. Initially, they were brought from Hackney and Chelsea but by 1834 they came mostly from neighbouring parishes or Liverpool poorhouses. They worked long days with schoolwork and gardening after their shift at the mill. The work was sometimes dangerous, with fingers sometimes being severed by the machines. Children were willing to work in the mill because life at a workhouse was even worse.Examination of Thomas Priestly, 02-08-1806, Manchester Central Reference Library, C5/8/9/5 (1806) Mill community The sparse accommodation that existed when the Gregs built the mill was soon exhausted and Greg built plain cottages which were rented to his workers. Each house had a parlour, kitchen and two bedrooms (a two-up two- down), an outside privy and a small garden. Rent was deducted from the workers' wages. Greg, like Robert Owen, who built New Lanark, attempted to bring the structured order of a country village to his new industrial centres. He built Oak School to educate the children and the Norcliffe Chapel where the villagers worshipped and held a Sunday school.

Libertines put value on physical pleasures, meaning those experienced through the senses. As a philosophy, libertinism gained new-found adherents in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, particularly in France and Great Britain. Notable among these were John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester and the Marquis de Sade.  History of the term  The word \\"Libertine\\" was originally coined by John Calvin to negatively describe opponents of his policies in Geneva, Switzerland. This group, led by Ami Perrin, argued against Calvin's \\"insistence that church discipline should be enforced uniformly against all members of Genevan society\\". Perrin and his allies were elected to the town council in 1548, and \\"broadened their support base in Geneva by stirring up resentment among the older inhabitants against the increasing number of religious refugees who were fleeing France in even greater numbers\\". By 1555, Calvinists were firmly in place on the Genevan town council, so the Libertines, led by Perrin, responded with an \\"attempted coup against the government and called for the massacre of the French. This was the last great political challenge Calvin had to face in Geneva\\". During the 18th and 19th centuries, the term became more associated with debauchery. Charles- Maurice de Talleyrand wrote that Joseph Bonaparte \\"sought only life's pleasures and easy access to libertinism\\" while on the throne of Naples.  Literature  Les Liaisons dangereuses (Dangerous Liaisons, 1782), an epistolary novel by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos, is a trenchant description of sexual libertinism. Wayland Young argues: Agreeable to Calvin's emphasis on the need for uniformity of discipline in Geneva, Samuel Rutherford (Professor of Divinity in the University of St. Andrews, and Christian minister in 17th Century Scotland) offered a rigorous treatment of \\"Libertinism\\" in his polemical work \\"A Free Disputation against pretended Liberty of Conscience\\" (1649). A Satyr Against Reason and Mankind is a poem by John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester which addresses the question of the proper use of reason, and is generally assumed to be a Hobbesian critique of rationalism. The narrator subordinates reason to sense. It is based to some extent on Boileau's version of Juvenal's eighth or fifteenth satire, and is also indebted to Hobbes, Montaigne, Lucretius and Epicurus, as well as the general libertine tradition. Confusion has arisen in its interpretation as it is ambiguous as to whether the speaker is Rochester himself, or a satirised persona. It criticises the vanities and corruptions of the statesmen and politicians of the court of Charles II. The libertine novel was a primarily 18th century literary genre of which the roots lay in the European but mainly French libertine tradition. The genre effectively ended with the French Revolution. Themes of libertine novels were anti-clericalism, anti-establishment and eroticism. Authors include Claude Prosper Jolyot de Cr√©billon (Les √âgarements du c≈ìur et de l'esprit, 1736; Le Sopha, conte moral, 1742), Denis Diderot (Les bijoux indiscrets, 1748), Marquis de Sade (L'Histoire de Juliette, 1797‚Äì1801), Choderlos de Laclos (Les Liaisons dangereuses, 1782), John Wilmot (Sodom, or the Quintessence of Debauchery, 1684). Other famous titles are Histoire de Dom Bougre, Portier des Chartreux (1741) and Th√©r√®se Philosophe (1748). Precursors to the libertine writers were Th√©ophile de Viau (1590‚Äì1626) and Charles de Saint-Evremond (1610‚Äì1703), who were inspired by Epicurus and the publication of Petronius. Robert Darnton is a cultural historian who has covered this genre extensively. Critics have been divided as to the literary merits of William Hazlitt's Liber Amoris, a deeply personal account of frustrated love that is quite unlike anything else Hazlitt ever wrote. Wardle suggests that it was compelling but marred by sickly sentimentality, and also proposes that Hazlitt might even have been anticipating some of the experiments in chronology made by later novelists.Wardle, pp. 363‚Äì65. Wardle was writing in 1971; twenty-first-century critics continue to be sharply divided. David Armitage has assessed the book disparagingly as \\"the result of a tormented mind grasping literary motifs in a desperate and increasingly unsuccessful (and self indulgent) attempt to communicate its descent into incoherence...\\", while Gregory Dart has acclaimed it \\"the most powerful account of unrequited love in English literature\\". To James Ley, \\"It is ... an unsparing account of the psychology of obsession, the way a mind in the grip of an all-consuming passion can distort reality to its own detriment\\". Armitage, p. 223; Dart 2012, p. 85; Ley p. 38. One or two positive reviews appeared, such as the one in the Globe, 7 June 1823: \\"The Liber Amoris is unique in the English language; and as, possibly, the first book in its fervour, its vehemency, and its careless exposure of passion and weakness‚Äîof sentiments and sensations which the common race of mankind seek most studiously to mystify or conceal‚Äîthat exhibits a portion of the most distinguishing characteristics of Rousseau, it ought to be generally praised\\".Quoted by Jones, p. 338. Dan Cruickshank in his book London's Sinful Secret summarized Hazlitt's infatuation stating: \\"Decades after her death Batsy (Careless) still haunted the imagination of the essayist William Hazlitt, a man who lodged near Covent Garden during the 1820s, where he became unpleasantly intimate with the social consequences of unconventional sexual obsession that he revealed in his Liber Amoris of 1823, in which he candidly confessed to his infatuation with his landlord's young daughter.\\"Dan Cruickshank, London's Sinful Secret, p.92. St. Martin's Press, New York (2009).  Philosophy  During the Baroque era in France, there existed a freethinking circle of philosophers and intellectuals who were collectively known as libertinage √©rudit and which included Gabriel Naud√©, √âlie Diodati and Fran√ßois de La Mothe Le Vayer. The critic Vivian de Sola Pinto linked John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester's libertinism to Hobbesian materialism.

In other words, it might refer to whether a commodity should no longer be on a pantry shelf (unfit for use), or just no longer on a supermarket shelf (unfit for sale, but not yet unfit for use). It applies to cosmetics, foods and beverages, medical devices, medicines, explosives, pharmaceutical drugs, chemicals, tyres, batteries, and many other perishable items. In some regions, an advisory best before, mandatory use by or freshness date is required on packaged perishable foods. The concept of expiration date is related but legally distinct in some jurisdictions. Background Shelf life is the recommended maximum time for which products or fresh (harvested) produce can be stored, during which the defined quality of a specified proportion of the goods remains acceptable under expected (or specified) conditions of distribution, storage and display. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), \\"canned foods are safe indefinitely as long as they are not exposed to freezing temperatures, or temperatures above 90 ¬∞F (32.2¬∞ C)\\". If the cans look okay, they are safe to use. Discard cans that are dented, rusted, or swollen. High-acid canned foods (tomatoes, fruits) will keep their best quality for 12 to 18 months; low-acid canned foods (meats, vegetables) for 2 to 5 years. \\"Sell by date\\" is a less ambiguous term for what is often referred to as an \\"expiration date\\". Most food is still edible after the expiration date.See A product that has passed its shelf life might still be safe, but quality is no longer guaranteed. In most food stores, waste is minimized by using stock rotation, which involves moving products with the earliest sell by date from the warehouse to the sales area, and then to the front of the shelf, so that most shoppers will pick them up first and thus they are likely to be sold before the end of their shelf life. Some stores can be fined for selling out of date products; most if not all would have to mark such products down as wasted, resulting in a financial loss. Shelf life depends on the degradation mechanism of the specific product. Most can be influenced by several factors: exposure to light, heat, moisture, transmission of gases, mechanical stresses, and contamination by things such as micro- organisms. Product quality is often mathematically modelled around a parameter (concentration of a chemical compound, a microbiological index, or moisture content). For some foods, health issues are important in determining shelf life. Bacterial contaminants are ubiquitous, and foods left unused too long will often be contaminated by substantial amounts of bacterial colonies and become dangerous to eat, leading to food poisoning. However, shelf life alone is not an accurate indicator of how long the food can safely be stored. For example, pasteurized milk can remain fresh for five days after its sell-by date if it is refrigerated properly. However, improper storage of milk may result in bacterial contamination or spoilage before the expiration date. The expiration date of pharmaceuticals specifies the date the manufacturer guarantees the full potency and safety of a drug. Most medications continue to be effective and safe for a time after the expiration date. A rare exception is a case of renal tubular acidosis purportedly caused by expired tetracycline. A study conducted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration covered over 100 drugs, prescription and over-the-counter. The study showed that about 90% of them were safe and effective as long as 15 years past their expiration dates. Joel Davis, a former FDA expiration-date compliance chief, said that with a handful of exceptions - notably nitroglycerin, insulin and some liquid antibiotics - most expired drugs are probably effective. Shelf life is not significantly studied during drug development, and drug manufacturers have economic and liability incentives to specify shorter shelf lives so that consumers are encouraged to discard and repurchase products. One major exception is the Shelf Life Extension Program (SLEP) of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), which commissioned a major study of drug efficacy from the FDA starting in the mid-1980s. One criticism is that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) refused to issue guidelines based on SLEP research for normal marketing of pharmaceuticals even though the FDA performed the study. The SLEP and FDA signed a memorandum that scientific data could not be shared with the public, public health departments, other government agencies, and drug manufacturers. State and local programs are not permitted to participate. The failure to share data has caused foreign governments to refuse donations of expired medications. One exception occurred during the 2010 Swine Flu Epidemic when the FDA authorized expired Tamiflu based on SLEP Data. The SLEP discovered that drugs such as Cipro remained effective nine years after their shelf life, and, as a cost-saving measure, the US military routinely uses a wide range of SLEP tested products past their official shelf life if drugs have been stored properly.http://www.usamma.army.mil/assets/docs/dlar.pdf Package testing: heat sealing film for evaluation of shelf life of lettuce Preservatives and antioxidants may be incorporated into some food and drug products to extend their shelf life. Some companies use induction sealing and vacuum/oxygen- barrier pouches to assist in the extension of the shelf life of their products where oxygen causes the loss. The DoD Shelf-Life Program defines shelf-life as > The total period of time beginning with the date of manufacture, date of > cure (for elastomeric and rubber products only), date of assembly, or date > of pack (subsistence only), and terminated by the date by which an item must > be used (expiration date) or subjected to inspection, test, restoration, or > disposal action; or after inspection/laboratory test/restorative action that > an item may remain in the combined wholesale (including manufacture's) and > retail storage systems and still be suitable for issue or use by the end > user. Shelf-life is not to be confused with service-life (defined as, A > general term used to quantify the average or standard life expectancy of an > item or equipment while in use. When a shelf-life item is unpacked and > introduced to mission requirements, installed into intended application, or > merely left in storage, placed in pre-expended bins, or held as bench stock, > shelf-life management stops and service life begins.) Shelf life is often specified in conjunction with a specific product, package, and distribution system. For example, an MRE field ration is designed to have a shelf life of three years at and six months at . Temperature control Nearly all chemical reactions can occur at normal temperatures (although different reactions proceed at different rates). However most reactions are accelerated by high temperatures, and the degradation of foods and pharmaceuticals is no exception. The same applies to the breakdown of many chemical explosives into more unstable compounds. Nitroglycerine is notorious. Old explosives are thus more dangerous (i.e. liable to be triggered to explode by very small disturbances, even trivial jiggling) than more recently manufactured explosives. Rubber products also degrade as sulphur bonds induced during vulcanization revert; this is why old rubber bands and other rubber products soften and get crispy, and lose their elasticity as they age. The usually quoted rule of thumb is that chemical reactions double their rate for each temperature increase of because activation energy barriers are more easily surmounted at higher temperatures. However, as with many rules of thumb, there are many caveats and exceptions. The rule works best for reactions with activation energy values around 50 kJ/mole; many of these are important at the usual temperatures we encounter. It is often applied in shelf life estimation, sometimes wrongly. There is a widespread impression, for instance in industry, that \\"triple time\\" can be simulated in practice by increasing the temperature by , e.g., storing a product for one month at simulates three months at . This is mathematically incorrect (if the rule was precisely accurate the required temperature increase would be about ), and in any case the rule is only a rough approximation and cannot always be relied on. The same is true, up to a point, of the chemical reactions of living things. They are usually catalyzed by enzymes which change reaction rates, but with no variation in catalytic action, the rule of thumb is still mostly applicable. In the case of bacteria and fungi, the reactions needed to feed and reproduce speed up at higher temperatures, up to the point that the proteins and other compounds in their cells themselves begin to break down, or denature, so quickly that they cannot be replaced. This is why high temperatures kill bacteria and other micro-organisms: 'tissue' breakdown reactions reach such rates that they cannot be compensated for and the cell dies. On the other hand, 'elevated' temperatures short of these result in increased growth and reproduction; if the organism is harmful, perhaps to dangerous levels. Just as temperature increases speed up reactions, temperature decreases reduce them. Therefore, to make explosives stable for longer periods, or to keep rubber bands springy, or to force bacteria to slow down their growth, they can be cooled. That is why shelf life is generally extended by temperature control: (refrigeration, insulated shipping containers, controlled cold chain, etc.) and why some medicines and foods must be refrigerated. Since such storing of such goods is temporal in nature and shelf life is dependent on the temperature controlled environment, they are also referred to as cargo even when in special storage to emphasize the inherent time-temperature sensitivity matrix. Temperature data loggers and time temperature indicators can record the temperature history of a shipment to help estimate their remaining shelf life. According to the USDA, \\"foods kept frozen continuously are safe indefinitely.\\" Packaging Passive barrier packaging can often help control or extend shelf life by blocking the transmission of deleterious substances, like moisture or oxygen, across the barrier. Active packaging, on the other hand, employs the use of substances that scavenge, capture, or otherwise render harmless deleterious substances. When moisture content is a mechanism for product degradation, packaging with a low moisture vapor transmission rate and the use of desiccants help keep the moisture in the package within acceptable limits. When oxidation is the primary concern, packaging with a low oxygen transmission rate and the use of oxygen absorbers can help extend the shelf life. Produce and other products with respiration often require packaging with controlled barrier properties. The use of a modified atmosphere in the package can extend the shelf life for some products. Issues associated with sell by / use by dates According to the UK Waste & Resources Action Programme (WRAP), 33% percent of all food produced is wasted along the cold chain or by the consumer.Household Food and Drink Waste in the UK, WRAP 2009 At the same time, a large number of people get sick every year due to spoiled food. According to the WHO and CDC, every year in the USA there are 76 million foodborne illnesses, leading to 325,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths. According to former UK minister Hilary Benn, the use by date and sell by dates are old technologies that are outdated and should be replaced by other solutions or disposed of altogether. The UK government's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs revised guidance in 2011 to exclude the use of sell by dates. The guidance was prepared in consultation with the food industry, consumer groups, regulators, and Waste & Resources Action Programme (WRAP). It aims to reduce the annual ¬£12bn of wasted supermarket food. Regulation =Canada= A best before date used on the bottom of a box in Canada The Canadian Food Inspection Agency produces a Guide to Food Labelling and Advertising which sets out a \\"Durable Life Date\\". The authority for producing the guide comes from the Food and Drugs Act. The guide sets out what items must be labelled and the format of the date. The month and day must be included and the year if it is felt necessary and must be in the format year/month/day. However, there is no requirement that the year be in four digits. =European Union= In the EU food quality dates are governed by Regulation (EU) 1169/2011, \\"On the Provision of Food Information to Consumers\\". Germany In Germany, one differentiates between the \\"Mindesthaltbarkeitsdatum\\" (MHD), roughly minimum shelf-life and \\"Verbrauchsdatum\\", which is more in line with the common expiry date. Products that spoil quickly, such as minced meat, have to be given a Verbrauchsdatum and are barred from sale upon expiry. Other products are given Mindesthaltbarkeitsdatum, which is set by the individual producers of said product and do not bar the product from being sold past the date determined. Products with an expired MHD may be sold if the seller is satisfied that the goods are in perfect condition. Accordingly, it follows that the customer is not entitled to compensation if he unintentionally acquires a product with an expired shelf life, provided that the product can still be regarded as faultless. Neither the MHD nor the Verbrauchsdatum provide legal rights if a product is no longer fit for consumption before the indicated date and the manufacturer can prove the credibility of his claims. The MHD has been criticized for possibly causing food waste. For example, the then Minister Christian Schmidt complained that many still edible foods with an expired MHD would be thrown away by consumers who would misunderstand the MHD as an expiration date. =Hong Kong= In Hong Kong, prepackaged food which from the microbiological point of view is highly perishable and is therefore likely after a short period to constitute an immediate danger to human health, are required to use the 'Use by' label instead of the 'Best before' label. Examples include pasteurised fresh milk, packed egg and ham sandwiches, etc. Dates are usually presented in the DD MM YY (or YYYY) format. =United Kingdom= According to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs dates must be in the day/month or day/month/year format. Technical expertise should be hired for regular end of shelf life safety and quality testing. Shelf life trials should be conducted using the same ingredients, equipment, procedures and manufacturing environment as will be used during the actual production. =United States= Sale of expired food products, per se, is lightly regulated in the US. Some states restrict or forbid the sale of expired products, require expiration dates on all perishable products, or both, while other states do not. However, sale of contaminated food is generally illegal, and may result in product liability litigation if consumption of the food results in injury. After losing an expensive lawsuit, one pharmacy chain ‚Äì CVS ‚Äì implemented a system that causes its registers to recognize expired products and avert their sale.http://www.consumercal.org/article.php?id=1779 @1:40 Voluntary industry guidelines announced in 2017 from the Grocery Manufacturers Association and the Food Marketing Institute recommend using only \\"best if used by\\" or \\"use by\\", to avoid confusion that leads to food waste. In 2019, the Food and Drug Administration urged food manufacturers to adopt the voluntary standards.To Reduce Food Waste, FDA Urges 'Best If Used By' Date Labels Federal regulation The Food and Drug Administration, which regulates packaged foods and drugs, only requires a use-by, or expiration, date on infant formula and some baby foods, because formula must contain a certain quantity of each nutrient as described on the label. If formula is stored too long, it may lose its nutritional value. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), which regulates fresh poultry and meats, only requires labeling of the date when poultry is packed. However, many manufacturers also voluntarily add sell- by or use-by dates. The DoD Shelf-Life Program operates under the DoD Regulation 4140.1-R, DoD Material Management Regulation, () > A.

Beer =Freshness date= A freshness date is the date used in the American brewing industry to indicate either the date the beer was bottled or the date before which the beer should be consumed. Beer is perishable. It can be affected by light, air, or the action of bacteria. Although beer is not legally mandated in the United States to have a shelf life, freshness dates serve much the same purpose and are used as a marketing tool. =Beginnings of freshness dating= General Brewing Company of San Francisco marketed their Lucky Lager Beer as \\"Age Dated\\" as early as late 1935. They stamped a date on each can lid to indicate that the beer was brewed before that date. This was not to ensure that the beer was \\"fresh\\" but to ensure that it had been aged properly. So many breweries had rushed beer to market before it was ready when Prohibition ended, that customers were wary of getting \\"green\\" beer. The Boston Beer Company, maker of Samuel Adams, was among the first contemporary brewers to start adding freshness dates to their product line in 1985. For ten years there was a slow growth in brewers adding freshness dates to their beer. The practice rapidly grew in popularity after the Anheuser-Busch company's heavily marketed \\"Born-On dates\\" starting in 1996. Many other brewers have started adding freshness dates to their products, but there is no standard for what the date means. For some companies, the date on the bottle or can will be the date that the beer was bottled; others have the date by which the beer should be consumed. Related concepts The concept of shelf life applies to other products besides food and drugs. Gasoline has a shelf life, although it is not normally necessary to display a sell-by date. Exceeding this time-frame will introduce harmful varnishes, etc. into equipment designed to operate with these products, i.e. a gasoline lawn mower that has not been properly winterized could incur damage that will prevent use in the spring, and require expensive servicing to the carburetor. Some glues and adhesives also have a limited storage life, and will stop working in a reliable and usable manner if their safe shelf life is exceeded. Rather different is the use of a time limit for the use of items like vouchers, gift certificates and pre-paid phone cards, so that after the displayed date the voucher etc. will no longer be valid. Bell Mobility and its parent company, BCE Inc. have been served with notice of a $100-million class-action lawsuit alleging that expiry dates on its pre-paid wireless services are illegal.

It is currently headed by Rabbi Aharon Feldman, a disciple of Rabbi Ruderman and a member of the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah of America.

Although \\"Ner Israel's mission statement makes clear its priority is religious studies,\\" the yeshiva's alumni have been estimated as 50% rabbis and religious-school teachers, and 50% as professionals: bankers, accountants, physicians, attorneys, psychologists, etc. This is consistent with the Yeshiva's outlook that dedication to Torah study and becoming a lifelong \\"Ben Torah\\" is the mission of both members of the clergy and of professionals. History and past leadership Rabbi Yaakov Yitzchak Ruderman, the son-in-law of Rabbi Sheftel Kramer, founded the yeshiva in 1933 with six students. It was based in a local shul. The yeshiva was named after Rabbi Yisrael Lipkin Salanter,Sefer HaYovel - HaPardes. Jubilee Book HaPardes - Rabbinical monthly journal, pg. 397. New york, NY: 1951. Can be seen here: http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=3153&pgnum;=404 the founder of the mussar movement which was a movement that was followed by Rabbi Nosson Tzvi Finkel (the Alter of Slabodka), the mentor of Rabbi Ruderman. Rabbi Ruderman modeled his decision-making process after Rabbi Finkel who was known for his incredible insights into human nature. Additionally, he modeled Ner Yisroel after Rabbi Finkel's yeshiva - the Slabodka Yeshiva. Rabbi Dovid Kronglass, of the Mirrer Yeshiva in Europe (and during World War II in Shanghai) and known fondly by his students as \\"Reb Dovid\\", was the yeshiva's first mashgiach ruchani until his unexpected death on December 16, 1972. Besides his role as Mashgiach, he also served as a Maggid Shiur and was the Posek of the Yeshiva. Thus, Reb Dovid exemplified greatness in Mussar, Lomdus, and Halacha. Rabbi Herman Naftali Neuberger, another son-in-law of Rabbi Sheftel Kramer, brother-in-law of Rabbi Ruderman, and an alumnus of the Mirrer Yeshiva in Europe, was president of Ner Israel from 1940 until his death in 2005.\\"for over half a century.\\" Rabbi Neuberger joined the Yeshiva as a student when he arrived from his native Bavaria in 1938. Rabbi Shmuel Yaakov Weinberg, a disciple of Rabbi Yitzchak Hutner, served on the Ner Yisroel faculty for nearly 50 years. He served as a Maggid Shiur from 1945 to 1965, as well as dean of the Kollel from 1953 to 1965. From 1971 until 1987, he served as an assistant to the Rosh Yeshiva and head of the Kollel. From Rabbi Ruderman's death in 1987 until his own death on July 1, 1999, Rabbi Weinberg served as Rosh Yeshiva. Rabbi Weinberg was married to Chana Ruderman, the only child of Rabbi Yaakov Yitzchok Ruderman. She died on January 23, 2012. Rabbi Yaakov Moshe Kulefsky, a disciple of Rav Shlomo Heiman and senior lecturer in the Yeshiva, served as the Rosh Yeshiva from Rabbi Weinberg's death in 1999 until his death on November 30, 2000. Other notable rabbis who served on the faculty include the late rabbis: Rabbi Shimon Schwab, later rabbi of the German-Jewish Frankfurt Kehillah / community in Washington Heights N.Y., Rabbi Simcha Zissel Broide of the Chevron Yeshiva in Jerusalem, Rabbi Ephraim Eisenberg, the son-in-law of Rabbi Mordechai Gifter, and Rabbi Zvi Dov Slanger. Rabbi Slanger, a disciple of Rav Shach, was a Maggid Shiur in the high school for many years until 1996 when he founded and became Rosh Yeshiva of the Bais Medrash & Mesivta Of Baltimore. In addition, Rabbi Moshe Eisemann who was Ner Yisroel's second mashgiach ruchani is presently retired, and Rabbi Moshe Heinemann (who is currently Rav of the Agudath Israel synagogue of Baltimore and the Star-K kashrus agency) no longer serves as Maggid Shiur, although he does give two weekly shiurim. Present leadership The yeshiva today is headed by Rabbi Aharon Feldman, who serves as the rosh yeshiva and is also a council member of the Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah. Rabbi Feldman studied in the Yeshiva in the 1950s, but had been living in Israel from 1961 until his appointment as rosh yeshiva in 2001. Rabbi Sheftel Neuberger is the menahel (president) of the yeshiva; he succeeds his father, Rabbi Herman Neuberger, who held the same position. Rabbi Beryl Weisbord, a son-in-law of Rabbi Weinberg, is the yeshiva's mashgiach ruchani and Mr. Jerome Kadden is the Yeshiva's executive director. Rabbi Yosef Tendler, a disciple of Rabbi Aharon Kotler, served as the principal of the high school (the Mechina) for almost fifty years from 1964 until his death on February 8, 2012, and Rabbi Simcha Cook (formerly assistant principal) is the current principal of the high school, with Rabbi Yosef Neuberger (son of Rabbi Sheftel Neuberger) filling the position of High School Mashgiach. (The position of assistant principal was changed to Mashgiach upon the death of Rabbi Tendler.) Rabbi Azriel Hauptman (son-in-law of Rabbi Yosef Tendler) is the General Studies principal (replacing Mr. Jacob Schuchman). Campus The yeshiva campus is located at Mt. Wilson Lane, just northwest of the Baltimore City limits. The yeshiva moved to its present location in 1968. Their previous location was in Baltimore City at 4411 Garrison Boulevard. The large size of their present campus, which is nearly 100 acres, provides ample space for outdoors recreation. Ner Israel has two central study halls, one for the high school (known as the Mechina) and one much larger for the beis medrash and the kollel (also doubling as the main prayer sanctuaries). There is an additional study hall/multi-purpose room of a smaller size that is called the \\"Friedman Beis Medrash\\". Enrollment is approximately 250 students in its high school division, 300 students in its beis medrash/undergraduate division, and about 200 members in its kollel/postgraduate division. The dining hall is located in a separate building known as the Sindler/Wolf Dining Hall. The dining hall is scheduled for a significant expansion and renovation in 2019. There are also three dormitory buildings on campus. There is faculty housing on campus for members of the faculty and some members of the kollel. This section of the campus is known as \\"Yeshiva Lane\\". The renaissance of the Orthodox Jewish community in Baltimore is closely related to the presence of Ner Yisroel, as many graduates who originate from other regions settled in the community. Activity outside of Baltimore In 1959, Rabbi Sholom Gold established a branch of Ner Yisroel in Toronto. In 1964, Rabbi Yaakov Weinberg became the Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshivas Ner Yisroel of Toronto until 1971. This yeshiva still functions but is no longer affiliated with Ner Yisroel in Baltimore. In recent years, Ner Israel has sent alumni to kollelim across the United States and several have founded their own institutions. Major student projects include \\"PROJECT YAHUD\\", a spring break fund-raising effort for the religious school in Yahud, Israel, and \\"PROJECT SEED\\", a summertime outreach effort in smaller communities across America and the world. Accreditation Ner Israel is a Maryland state accredited college through the Association of Advanced Rabbinical and Talmudic Schools ‚Äì Accreditation Commission (AARTS), and has agreements with Johns Hopkins University, Towson University, Loyola College in Maryland, University of Baltimore, and University of Maryland, Baltimore County allowing undergraduate students to take night courses at these colleges and universities in a variety of academic fields. The agreement also allows the students to receive academic credits for their religious studies. Ner Yisrael also has a pre-med program in association with Stevenson University of Owings Mills. The Mechina high school is an accredited high school in the state of Maryland under the name \\"Israel Henry Beren High School\\". The high school was dedicated by the philanthropic Beren family in memory of Israel Henry Beren who died in 1994. Curriculum A student studying inside the Bais Medrash =Cycle of Masechtos (Tractates of the Talmud)= The yeshiva's studies are primarily Talmud texts and relevant rabbinic literature. The yeshiva has a rotating cycle of nine different Talmudic tractates it covers in the course of nine years: Bava Kamma 1, Yevamos, Bava Basra, Gittin, Bava Kamma 2, Nedarim, Bava Metzia, Kiddushin, and Kesubos. There are additional tractates that are sometimes studied in the spring semester. These include Succah, Pesachim, and Makkos. In addition to these B'iyun mesachtos they also learn a range of different mesachtos in bekieas, for example Sotah and Megillah As is true in many Lithuanian-style Yeshivas, the methodology of the study of the Talmud is based on the Brisker method. Other Lithuanian-style Yeshivos follow almost exclusively the Rabbi Boruch Ber Leibowitz style of the Brisker method. Although Rabbi Lebowitz's works are studied in Ner Yisrael, his specific style of study is not the only approach in Ner Yisroel as Ner Yisroel subscribes to a different approach to Talmudic Lomdus. Hour-long Shiurim (lessons) on Talmud are given daily. The highest level shiur is taught by Rabbi Tzvi Berkowitz. Additionally, half an hour per day is dedicated to the study of Musar literature. =Kollel Avodas Levi= Kollel Avodas Levi is a department of the Yeshiva that is composed of older students, mostly married, who are engaged in advanced studies. Established in 1959, the Kollel was later named \\"Avodas Levi\\" in memory of Rabbi Ruderman who authored a sefer of the same name. Most of the 250+ members, known as yungerleit, learn within the framework of a study group, called a \\"chabura\\", that is focused on a specific topic and led by a senior member of the Kollel. Ner Yisroel confers Semicha (Rabbinic Ordination) upon qualified members. Rabbi Ezra Neuberger, son of Rabbi Herman became Rosh Kollel/Dean of the Kollel/Graduate school in his father's lifetime. =The Mechina's Masechta Bechina= The Mechina High School studies two tractates every year. One is studied in depth (Iyyun), and the other one is studied in its entirety at a faster pace which is known as the study of Bekius. At the end of the school year, the students take an exam on the entire tractate that was studied in the Bekius program. This exam is called the \\"Masechta Bechina\\". An exam on an entire tractate is considered a major accomplishment due to the amount and complexity of the information contained in each tractate. Former students recount how decades later they still have an incredible recall of the tractates that they studied in the Mechina's Bekius program. Advanced students complete the Iyyun tractate on their own as an extracurricular project. Those that complete the Iyyun tractate are honored at the end of the school year at a special dinner. =STAR-K program= Students of Ner Yiroel's Kollel Avodas Levi have the option to participate in the Star-K Rabbinical Training Program, which prepares them for Kashrus supervision. Degrees and certificates Degrees granted by Ner Israel are a Bachelor of Talmudic Law (four years), Master of Talmudic Law (six years), Doctorate in Talmudic Law (ten years and authoring a commentary on Talmudic or Rabbinic texts). Rabbinic ordination (Semichah) can also be conferred in Ner Yisroel. Ner Yisroel's Machon program, which began in 1962, trains religious educators for Jewish communities and schools and students earn a Torah Umesorah recognized certification. Student body Ner Israel attracts students from the United States, Canada and other countries around the world. Most undergraduate students in Ner Yisroel will either have already studied in Israel for two or three years prior to their arrival, or plan to upon completion of their studies in Ner Israel. =Persian Students= In the 1970s due to the political turmoil following the Iranian Revolution and the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war, which saw many young Iranian men being sent to the front-lines with little military training, life became a little difficult for Iran's Jews. Rabbi Herman Neuberger was very instrumental in bringing to the United States over 1,000 young Persian men, most of whom studied in Ner Yisroel. Ner Yisroel still maintains a special minyan on Shabbos for Persian students. There are large communities of Orthodox Persian Jews in Baltimore, Los Angeles, and New York that are a direct result of Rabbi Neuberger's efforts. =South American Students= There are many South American students in the Yeshiva. This is primarily due to Camp Or Haner, which is a camp for South Americans that is located in Ner Yisroel. Many of the campers are inspired to remain as students in the Yeshiva. Many of these students return to their communities of origin, which has made a significant impact on the religious observance of members of those communities. The camp was founded by Rabbi Moshe Fuller, who began himself as a South American student of the Yeshiva. Rabbi Fuller died in 2008. =Community Service= Students periodically engage in community service such as leading the prayers in the nearby North Oaks retirement community. Additionally, the Yeshiva sends several Rebbeim once a year to spend a Shabbos in the community. This is known as \\"The Baltimore Shabbos of Chizuk\\". Additionally, many students visit older members in the community in the nearby Levindale Hebrew Geriatric Center and Hospital on Fridays.

It was led by and named for Colonel Ahmed  ªUrabi (also spelled Orabi and Arabi) and sought to depose the Khedive Tewfik Pasha and end British and French influence over the country. The uprising was ended by an Anglo-Egyptian War and takeover of the country. Thus began the History of Egypt under the British.Thomas Mayer, The Changing Past: Egyptian Historiography of the Urabi Revolt, 1882-1982 (University Presses of Florida, 1988).Donald Malcolm Reid. \\"The Urabi revolution and the British conquest, 1879-1882.\\" in M. W. Daly, ed. The Cambridge History of Egypt (Volume 2) (1999) pp 217-238. Prologue Egypt in the 1870s was under foreign influence, corruption, misgovernment, and in a state of financial ruin. Huge debts rung up by its ruler Isma ªil Pasha could no longer be repaid and under pressure from the European banks that held the debt, the country's finances were being controlled by representatives of France and Britain. When Isma ªil tried to rouse the Egyptian people against this foreign intervention, he was deposed by the British and replaced by his more pliable son Tewfik Pasha. The upper ranks of the civil service, the army, and the business world had become dominated by Europeans, who were paid more than native Egyptians. Within Egypt, a parallel legal system for suing Europeans separately from the natives was set up. This angered educated and ambitious Egyptians in the military and civil service who felt that the European domination of top positions was preventing their own advancement. The heavily taxed Egyptian peasants, were also annoyed by their taxes going to Europeans who lived in relative wealth. Egyptians resented not only West European domination, but also the Turks, Circassians and Albanians in Egypt who controlled most other elite positions in the government and military. Albanian troops had come to Egypt along with Muhammad Ali, and helped him to take control of the country, and they were highly favored by the Khedive. Turkish was still the official language of the army, and Turks were more likely to be promoted. In the ruling cabinet under Khedive Tawfiq, every member was a Turco-Circassian. The growing fiscal crisis in the country forced the Khedive to drastically cut the army. From a height of 94,000 troops in 1874, the army was cut to 36,000 in 1879, with plans to shrink it even more. This created a large class of unemployed and disaffected army officers within the country. The disastrous Ethiopian‚ÄìEgyptian War in 1875-1876 also angered the officers, who felt that the government had sent them unwisely into the conflict. A public consciousness was developing in Egypt during this period, literacy was spreading, more newspapers were being published in the 1870s and 1880s such as the influential paper Abu Naddara Zarqa. Published by Yaqub Sanu, a Jew of Italian and Egyptian origins, this Paris-based publication was a political satire magazine which often mocked the establishment under European control, and the publication increasingly irritated the ruling powers as well as the Europeans as it favored reform and revolutionary movements. This paper had a wide reach, unlike many other publications, Abu Naddara Zarqa was written in Egyptian Arabic rather than classical Arabic, making its satire and political pieces understandable to the masses, not just the educated elite. Ya'qub Sanu' claimed that his magazine reached a circulation of 10,000, which was a huge number in those days. During this time Ahmad  ªUrabi, a native non-European army officer had risen up through the army to the rank of Colonel. Because of his peasant upbringing and traditional training, he came to be viewed by many as the authentic voice of people of Egypt. To them, he represented a peasant population frustrated with tax-exempt foreigners and wealthy local landlords.  ªUrabi commanded the respect and support of not only the peasantry, but also a large portion of the Egyptian army as well.Cleveland, William L & Martin Bunton, A History of the Modern Middle East: 4th Edition, Westview Press: 2009, p. 92.  ªUrabi's seizure of power Tension built over the summer of 1881 as both the Khedive and the Egyptian officers, now led by  ªUrabi, searched for supporters and gathered allies. In September the Khedive ordered  ªUrabi's regiment to leave Cairo.  ªUrabi refused and ordered the dismissal of the Turco-Circassian generals and the creation of an elected government. Unable to oppose the revolt, Tewfiq agreed and a new chamber of deputies and government were established containing a number of  ªUrabi's allies. In January 1882,  ªUrabi became Minister of War. Foreign intervention On January 8, 1882 the French and British sent a joint note that asserted the primacy of the Khedive's authority. The note infuriated the parliamentarians and  ªUrabi. The government collapsed and a new one with  ªUrabi as Minister of War was created. This new government threatened the positions of Europeans in the government and also began laying-off large numbers of Turco-Circassian officers. This broad effort at reform was opposed by the European interests, and many of the large landowners, the Turkish and Circassian elite, the high-ranking ulama, Syrian Christians, and most of the wealthiest members of society. In contrast, it had the support of most of the rest of the Egyptian population including lower- level ulama, the officer corps, and local leaders. Copts were divided: their close affiliation with Europeans angered many and sometime made them a target, but the deep rivalry between Coptic and Syrian Christians led many to align with other Egyptian rebels. The Coptic Patriarch lent his support to the revolt when it was at its peak, but later claimed that he was pressured into doing so.  ªUrabi and other leaders of the revolt acknowledged the Copts as potential allies and worked to prevent any targeting of the minority by nationalist Muslims, but were not always successful. An effort to court the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II began. Tewfik Pasha called on the sultan to quell the revolt, but the Sublime Porte hesitated to employ troops against Muslims who were opposing foreign colonial rule.  ªUrabi asked the Sultan to depose Tewfiq, but again the Sultan hesitated. British invasion On the afternoon of June 11, 1882 the political turmoil exploded into violence on the streets of Alexandria. Rioters attacked Greek, Maltese and Italian businesses and battles broke out in the streets. About fifty Europeans and 250 Egyptians were killed. The exact cause of the revolt is uncertain; both the Khedive and  ªUrabi have been blamed for starting it, but there is no proof of either allegation. As the city's garrison was maintaining the coastal defence batteries, an ultimatum was sent demanding the batteries be dismantled under threat of bombardment. The ultimatum was ignored, and the British fleet off Alexandria under Admiral Beauchamp Seymour, 1st Baron Alcester bombarded the city. The coastal batteries returned fire. The French fleet, also at Alexandria, refused to participate. A large British naval force then tried to capture the city. Despite encountering heavy resistance, the British forces succeeded, forcing the Egyptians to withdraw. As revolts spread across Egypt, the British House of Commons voted in favour of a larger intervention. The British army launched a probing/scouting attack at Battle of Kafr El Dawwar to determine whether or not Cairo could be advanced on from Alexandria, However the British concluded that the Egyptian defences were too strong, so in September of that year a British army was landed in the Canal Zone. The motivation for the British intervention is still disputed. The British were especially concerned that  ªUrabi would default on Egypt's massive debt and that he might try to gain control of the Suez Canal. On September 13, 1882 the British forces defeated  ªUrabi's army at the Battle of Tell El Kebir.  ªUrabi was captured and eventually exiled to the British colony of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). Aftermath While the British intervention was meant to be short term, it in fact persisted until 1954. Egypt was effectively made a colony until 1952. Both the British and the Khedival government did their best to discredit  ªUrabi's name and the revolution, although among the common people  ªUrabi remained a popular figure. The government used the state media and educational system to denounce  ªUrabi as a traitor and the revolution as merely a military mutiny. Egyptian historian Mohammed Rif'at was one of the first to call the events a thawrah, or \\"revolution,\\" but he claimed that it lacked popular support. Other historians in Egypt supported this thesis, and even expanded on it, sometimes suffering government censure. During the last years of the monarchy, authors became more critical of the old establishment and especially of the British, and  ªUrabi is sometimes portrayed as a hero of freedom and constitutionalism  ªUrabi's Revolt had a long lasting significance as the first instance of Egyptian anti-colonial nationalism, which would later play a very major role in Egyptian history. Especially under Gamal Abdel Nasser, the revolt would be regarded as a \\"glorious struggle\\" against foreign occupation. The  ªUrabi Revolution was seen by the Free Officers movement as a precursor to the 1952 revolution, and both Nasser and Muhammad Neguib were likened to  ªUrabi. Nasserist textbooks called the  ªUrabi Revolt a \\"national revolution,\\" but  ªUrabi was seen as making great strategic mistakes and not being as much of a man of the people as Nasser. During Nasser's experiment with Arab socialism, the  ªUrabi revolt was also sometimes put in a Marxist context. Also during President Sadat's infitah (economic liberalisation) period in which there was growing, controlled, economic liberalization and growing ties with the Western bloc, the government played up the desire of the  ªUrabists to draft a constitution and have democratic elections. After the 1952 revolution, the image of  ªUrabi, at least officially, has generally improved, with a number of streets and a square in Cairo bearing his name indicating the honored position he has in the official history. Views of historians Historians have in general been divided, with one group seeing the revolt as a push for liberalism and freedom on the model of the French Revolution and others arguing that it was little more than a military coup, similar to those made about the 1952 movement. Among Western historians, especially British, there was a traditional view that the  ªUrabi revolution was nothing more than a \\"revolt\\" or \\"insurrection\\" and not a real social revolution. By far the most influential Englishman in Egypt, Lord Cromer, wrote a scathing assessment of the  ªUrabists in his Modern Egypt. While this view is still held by many, there has been a growing trend to call the  ªUrabi revolution a real revolution, especially amongst newer historians who tend to emphasize social and economic history and to examine native, rather than European, sources. The earliest published work of Augusta, Lady Gregory‚Äîlater to embrace Irish nationalism and have an important role in the cultural life of Ireland‚Äîwas Arabi and His Household (1882), a pamphlet (originally a letter to The Times newspaper) in support of Ahmed  ªUrabi and his revolt. Juan Cole, a Professor at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor has recently published an appraisal of the  ªUrabi revolt. Historians have also been divided over the reasons for the British invasion, with some arguing that it was to protect the Suez Canal and prevent \\"anarchy\\", while others argue that it was to protect the interests of British investors with assets in Egypt (see Anglo-Egyptian War).

Events =Background= On 10 December 1781, a French convoy sailed from Brest with reinforcements and stores for the East and West Indies, protected by a fleet of 19 ships of the line commanded by Comte de Guichen. On 11 December 1781, Bussy-Castelnau departed Cadiz with a squadron comprising the 64-gun Saint-Michel and the 74-gun Illustre, escorting three transports, to make his junction at Tenerife with the squadron under Guichen. The next day, they encountered a British squadron of ships of the line, commanded by Rear Admiral Richard Kempenfelt in HMS Victory, that had been ordered to sea to intercept the expected convoy. =Action= On 12 December, Kempenfelt's squadron sighted the French convoy, discovering that its protective escort had been strengthened. Initially, Guichen's fleet was situated downwind of the convoy, allowing the British ships to sweep down and capture 15 ships carrying troops and supplies before the French ships could intervene. Rear Admiral Kempenfelt's force was not strong enough to attack the 19 French escorts, but the French convoy, having deliberately risked setting sail in the North Atlantic storm season in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid British forces, was dispersed in a gale shortly afterwards, and most of the ships forced to return to port. =Aftermath= Only two of the ships of the line intended for the West Indies arrived with a few transport vessels in time for the Battle of the Saintes in April. When news of the battle at Ushant reached Britain, the Opposition in Parliament questioned the decision to send such a small force against the convoy, and forced an official inquiry into the administration of the Royal Navy. This was the first of a succession of Opposition challenges which would ultimately bring about the fall of the government of Lord North on 20 March 1782 and pave the way for the Peace of Paris (1783), which ended the American Revolutionary War. The French transports Marquis de Castries and Neptune-Royal, lone survivors of the convoy, reached Sainte-Croix carrying siege artillery and an artillery company.

Salinger, originally published in the January 31, 1948, issue of The New Yorker. It was anthologized in 1949's 55 Short Stories from the New Yorker, as well as in Salinger's 1953 collection, Nine Stories. The story is an enigmatic examination of a young married couple, Muriel and Seymour Glass, while on vacation in Florida.Slawenski, 2010, p. 159 It is the first of his stories to feature a member of the fictional Glass family. When twenty-eight-year-old Salinger submitted the manuscript to The New Yorker in January 1947, titled \\"The Bananafish\\",Slawenski, 2010, p. 158 its arresting dialogue and precise styleSlawenski, 2010, pp. 158‚Äì159 were read with interest by fiction editor William Maxwell and his staff, though the point of the story, in this original version, was deemed incomprehensible. At Maxwell's urging, Salinger embarked upon a major reworking of the piece, adding the opening section with Muriel's character, and crafting the material to provide insights into Seymour's tragic demise. Salinger, in frequent consultation with editor Gus Lobrano, revised the story numerous times throughout 1947, renaming it \\"A Fine Day for Bananafish\\".Alexander, 1999, p. 124 The New Yorker published the final version as \\"A Perfect Day for Bananafish\\" one year after Salinger had first submitted the manuscript. The effort was met with immediate acclaim, and according to Salinger biographer Paul Alexander, it was \\"the story that would permanently change his standing in the literary community.\\" Salinger's decision to collaborate with Maxwell and The New Yorker staff in developing the story marked a major advance in his careerSlawenski, 2010, p. 159, p. 168 and led to his entry into that echelon of elite writers at the journal.Slawenski, 2010, p. 168 Plot summary The story is set at an upscale seaside resort in Florida. Muriel Glass, a wealthy and self-absorbed woman, phones her mother from her suite to discuss Muriel's husband Seymour, a World War II combat veteran recently discharged from an army hospital; it is implied that he was being evaluated for a psychiatric disorder.Slawenski, 2010, p. 160 Muriel's mother is concerned by reports of her son-in-law's increasingly bizarre and anti-social actions, and warns her daughter that he may \\"lose control of himself\\". Muriel dismisses her remarks as hyperbole, regarding her husband's idiosyncrasies as benign and manageable. Neither of the women express concern that Seymour's irrational behavior may indicate that he is suffering emotionally.Slawenski, 2010 Meanwhile, at the resort's adjoining beach, a child named Sybil Carpenter has been left unsupervised by her mother so that she may drink at the hotel bar. Sybil wanders on the beach and finds Seymour, lying in solitude a quarter-mile from the hotel. Sybil reproaches Seymour for allowing another little girl, Sharon Lipschutz, to sit with him the previous night as he played the lounge piano for the hotel's guests.Salinger, 1948, p. 14 Seymour attempts to placate Sybil by suggesting they \\"catch a Bananafish\\", but Sybil insists that Seymour choose between her and Sharon Lipschutz. Seymour responds that he observed Sybil abusing a hotel patron's dog, and the girl falls silent. Seymour places Sybil on a rubber raft and wades into the water, where he tells her the story of \\"the very tragic life\\" of the bananafish: they gorge themselves on bananas, become too large to escape their feeding holes, and die.Slawenski, 2010, p. 161 Sybil is unfazed by the story, and claims that she sees a bananafish with six bananas in its mouth. Seymour affectionately kisses the arch of one of her feet, and returns her to shore, where she departs. Once alone, and returning to the hotel, Seymour becomes less affable. He starts a baseless argument with a woman in an elevator, accusing her of staring at his feet and calling her a \\"god-damned sneak\\". He returns to his hotel room, where his wife is taking a nap. He retrieves a pistol from his luggage and shoots himself.  Background on publication and style  Before publication of the story, Salinger had reworked the details in a meeting with William Maxwell. Originally, the story consisted merely of Seymour‚Äôs incident on the beach with Sybil Carpenter, and the consequent suicide. Maxwell argued that there was no clear explanation that justified Seymour killing himself. After the author‚Äôs encounter with Maxwell, the portion of the story with Muriel speaking to her mother on the phone was incorporated. After the triumph of ‚ÄúA Perfect Day for Bananafish,‚Äù Salinger allowed the New Yorker to have the first chance at printing all of his subsequent writing by signing a contract with the magazine. Despite some differing critical opinion, Salinger's Nine Stories, in which \\"A Perfect Day for Bananafish\\" appears, are not separate entities published together. Author Eberhard Alsen, in A Reader‚Äôs Guide to J.D Salinger, observes that the stories evolve chronologically. They change in a way that mirrors Salinger‚Äôs personal life and his experiences with religion. Many scholars and critics have analyzed and reviewed the character of Seymour Glass in regards to his war time experiences and suicide. His daughter, Margaret Salinger, recalls her father's stories from World War II and makes a connection between Salinger and the character of Seymour in \\"A Perfect Day for Bananafish\\". Author Ron Rosenbaum draws from Margaret Salinger's memories to elicit a connection between Salinger's progression from bleak to optimistic, and the spiritual writing style in Nine Stories. Salinger was also greatly influenced by Ernest Hemingway's writing style and narration method. Hemingway writes in such a way that the reader has to interpret and draw his or her own conclusions when characters are speaking. The vague description common to Hemingway's narrative dialogue appears in several of Salinger's stories and novels.  Reception and criticism  Though \\"Slight Rebellion Off Madison\\" was published in the New Yorker and met with acclaim, Salinger continued to face rejection afterwards. The New Yorker consistently dismissed further stories submitted by Salinger. Unfazed, Salinger continued to submit work to the New Yorker because he believed that the editors of the magazine would publish more of his stories. After sending the initial draft entitled \\"The Bananafish\\" to the New Yorker, Harold Ober, agent of the author, received a letter from William Maxwell, a fiction editor at the magazine. The letter, from January 22, 1947, stated: \\"We like parts of The Bananafish by J.D. Salinger very much, but it seems to us to lack any discernible story or point. If Mr. Salinger is around town, perhaps he'd like to come in and talk to us about New Yorker stories.\\" When \\"A Perfect Day for Bananafish\\" was first published, the initial reception and criticism of the short story was positive. Readers were accepting of the new tone being presented to literature through Salinger's short stories, and it was the release of \\"A Perfect Day for Bananafish\\" that popularized Salinger's name in the literary community. Much of the criticism regarding the story involves the character of Seymour Glass, who makes an appearance in several other of Salinger's short stories. Most of the content fueling Seymour's criticism involves his war experiences and suicide. Critics interpret evidence from the story to determine what the actual cause of Seymour's suicide was due to conflicting reasoning presented in other stories that include the Glass family. Some believe it was the entire world that drove Seymour to madness while others draw a connection to post-traumatic stress. According to critic Janet Malcolm, the world portrayed in the story is both tangled and simplified by Salinger. This \\"dualism\\" can be found in other works of Salinger, as he continually depicts life \\"as a battleground between the normal and abnormal, the ordinary and the extraordinary, the talentless and the gifted, the well and the sick.\\" Analysis Like the eldest son of the Glass family, Salinger was deeply affected by his experiences as a combat soldier in WWII, and these informed his writing.Bailey, 2011 Kenneth Slawenski reports that Salinger, in his Seymour ‚Äì An Introduction (1959), confesses that the young man in Bananafish \\"was not Seymour at all but... myself.\\" Traumatized by the Battle of the Bulge and the Nazi concentration camps,Slawenski, 2010, p. 161, p. 173 Salinger \\"found it impossible to fit into a society that ignored the truth that he now knew.\\" Children figure prominently in Salinger's works.Slawenski, 2010, p. 172 Seymour's sympathetic and affectionate interaction with children is contrasted with the detached and phony behavior of adults. In the aftermath of his interlude with Sybil, Seymour \\"has drawn his own conclusions regarding the makeup of human beings and the world around him\\" and commits suicide. =T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land and Bananafish= Salinger quotes a verse from the poem The Waste Land by poet T. S. Eliot in the following exchange between Seymour and Sybil, regarding the little girl's young rival, Sharon Lipschutz: The stanza that contains the verse is from Section I of The Waste Land ‚Äì \\"The Burial of the Dead\\": \\"The Burial of the Dead\\" begins with an excerpt from Petronius Arbiter's Satyricon, which reads: \\"For once I saw with my own eyes the Cumean Sibyl hanging in a jar, and when the boys asked her, 'Sibyl, what do you want?' she answered, 'I want to die. Slawenski argues that Salinger's choice of the name Sybil for the little girl establishes an \\"unmistakable\\" correlation between Eliot's depiction of the Cumaean Sybil of Greek myth and Seymour's story of the bananafish. The bananafish are \\"doomed by greed\\" and thus share the fate of Eliot's Sybil, \\"cursed by relentless existence.\\" Notes References =Cited in footnotes=  Short stories by J. D.

Sabrina was created by writer George Gladir and artist Dan DeCarlo, and first appeared in Archie's Madhouse #22 (cover-dated Oct. 1962). Storylines of the character at elementary-school-age also appear under the title \\"Sabrina -- That Cute Little Witch\\" in almost all of the Little Archie comics. The series' premise is that Sabrina, a \\"half-witch\\" - her mother is an ordinary human, or \\"mortal\\" as witches refer to them, while her father is a warlock - lives with her two aunts, Hilda and Zelda Spellman, both witches themselves, in the fictional town of Greendale, which is located somewhere near Riverdale, the home of Archie Andrews. Also living with the three women as the family pet is Salem Saberhagen, a witch who has been turned into a cat as punishment for world domination attempts. Sabrina's primary romantic interest is her mortal boyfriend Harvey Kinkle who, like nearly all the other mortals in Sabrina's world, is unaware his girlfriend is a witch. Most of Sabrina's adventures consist of Sabrina either trying to use her powers in secret to help others - witches generally are not allowed to tell mortals about their abilities or existence - or dealing with the day-to-day trials of being a teenager. A recurring theme in Sabrina's stories is her learning more about the proper use of her powers, either through her aunts or from trips to a magical dimension that is the home of various magical/mythological creatures, including other witches. Various names are given to this dimension; the mid-late 2000s comics refer to it as the \\"Magic Realm,\\"Sabrina the Teenage Witch vol. 3, #58-100, 2004-2009 while the live-action sitcom referred to it as the \\"Other Realm\\". The comic's characters have also appeared in various other media formats. The live-action sitcom, in which Sabrina discovers her powers at the age of sixteen, aired for seven seasons on ABC and the WB. Earlier, there had been an animated series produced by Filmation Associates. Another format was a series of paperback novels (see list below) written by various authors, including Nancy Holder, Diana G. Gallagher, and Mel Odom, as well as a late 1990s/early 2000s animated series set in the original Archie Comics continuity, where Sabrina already knows about her powers while in junior high. Publication history Sabrina the Teenage Witch debuted in Archie's Madhouse (the logo is sometimes given as Archie's Mad House) #22 (Oct. 1962). Created by writer George Gladir and artist Dan DeCarlo. She first appeared in that humor anthology's lead story (the logo then spelled \\"Teen-Age\\"),Archive of McQuarrie, Jim, \\"Archie's Mad House No. 22\\", \\"Oddball Comics\\" (column) #1153, April 1, 2007. Original page and eventually became one of Archie Comics' major characters, appearing in an animated series and a television sitcom. Gladir recalled in 2007, Sabrina made regular appearances in the comic book Archie's TV Laugh-Out. The title was published from 1969 to 1985, and consisted of 106 issues. The first volume of Sabrina The Teenage Witch was published from 1971 to 1983, and ran for 77 issues.Sabrina the Teenage Witch at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on February 10, 2017. A new \\"Sabrina\\" comic series was introduced shortly after the debut of the 1996 live-action sitcom. This series ran for 32 issues, between 1997 and December 1999. The new series incorporated elements from the live-action sitcom, including modernized fashions and appearances for the aunts, Sabrina's last name and Salem's personality and backstory. Starting in January 2000, Archie rebooted the series from #1, this time based upon the 2000 animated series (the final issue of the 1997-1999 series had acted as a transition between the two adaptations). This new title was simply titled Sabrina and lasted for 37 issues; issue #38, published in late 2002, again acted as a transition issue, as the series was re-titled Sabrina The Teenage Witch and resumed the conventional high school setting. However, elements of the live-action sitcom (Salem's backstory, the modernized appearances of Hilda and Zelda) were retained, along with the name of Sabrina's hometown (Greendale) from Sabrina the Animated Series being incorporated into the comics. The conventional setting lasted until issue #57, published in 2004, when the comic underwent a manga makeover (see below). The series ended with issue #104 in September 2009. Sabrina also occasionally appears in other Archie Comics as a visiting acquaintance of Archie, Betty Cooper, Veronica Lodge, and Jughead Jones. In Jughead #200 (May 2010), Sabrina reveals to Jughead that she is a witch, which is made use of in a follow-up story.Archie & Friends #152, April 2011 Sabrina and Salem make a notable appearance in the 2012 Archie issue #636, where Salem, as a plot device, performs a spell (against Sabrina's desires) that gender-bends the entire town of Riverdale without the characters noticing the change. =Specials= Issue #28 of Sabrina, as well as the Sonic Super Special Crossover Chaos, featured a crossover with Sonic the Hedgehog, in which Sonic was brought to Greendale from Mobius by one of Sabrina's enemies and subsequently brainwashed into attacking Sabrina herself. In this issue, it is mentioned that Salem is a fan of Sonic and has all of his comics and watches Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog. = Manga-inspired version = In 2004, beginning with issue #58 (in the second Sabrina the Teenage Witch comic book series), the comics were taken over by Tania del Rio with her manga- inspired art and design style. Concurrent with this, the comic ceased to be connected to either the live-action or animated Sabrina series. The comics were then released featuring new characters and a slightly more serious, continuity-heavy plot. The manga Sabrina story wrapped up at issue #100 in 2009, albeit with a few unresolved subplots. Issues #58-61 of the 'manga makeover' series were reprinted as Sabrina- The Magic Revisited. Then, in 2013, issues #58-67 were reprinted as Sabrina the Teenage Witch: The Magic Within Book 1 in grayscale instead of full-color. Sabrina the Teenage Witch: The Magic Within Book 2 containing issues #68-78 also was reprinted in grayscale instead of full-color. Book 3 and 4 containing issues #79-89 and #90-100, respectively, were also released and, like the first two, were reprinted in gray-scale instead of full color. Issues #58-100 of the 'manga makeover' series were released digitally as Sabrina Manga #1‚Äì43. = Stories of Young Salem = A four-issue spin-off miniseries featuring Salem as a young boy (predating his attempts at conquest later in life and his transformation into a cat) was published in 2009. The miniseries was written by Ian Flynn and illustrated by Chad Thomas. The mini-series continued directly on Sabrina's regular series beginning with issue #101, albeit with a different title known as The Magical Tales of Young Salem. This was done as a method to cut newsstands costs. The new series is partially based on a two-part story which occurred during the manga Sabrina series issues #93 and #94, which was a flashback about Salem's near-rise to power. As of issue #104, the first The Magical Tales of Young Salem mini-series was concluded, but apparently the comic book series was subsequently suspended for internal reasons with no further Young Salem stories announced. = New Riverdale = In 2015, \\"New Riverdale\\" was introduced, rebooting the entire original Archie lineup in favor of a realistic aesthetic aimed at older readers. Sabrina debuted in the \\"New Riverdale\\" with Jughead #9. She continued to appear for issues #10 and #11. In December 2016, it was announced that a Sabrina the Teenage Witch one- shot would debut in March 2017 as part of Archie Comics' \\"pilot season\\". This one-shot would have been greenlit into a full series if there was enough fan interest. However, in May 2017 it was revealed that the one-shot was cancelled, with no intention of releasing it at a later date. = Sabrina the Teenage Witch Mini Series = In November 2018, Archie Comics announced a Five Issue Mini Series set to launch in the spring of 2019, the new five-issue Sabrina the Teenage Witch miniseries will be written by Kelly Thompson and illustrated by the husband-and-wife team of Veronica Fish and Andy Fish. Thompson is a rising star in comics, having penned Hawkeye and West Coast Avengers for Marvel, and she's also set to take over writing duties on Captain Marvel in the new year, just in time for the much-anticipated movie, while the Fish's, one of the few working spousal teams in comics, had made a name for themselves on BLACKWOOD for Dark Horse Comics written by Evan Dorkin. The series was critically acclaimed, with Thrillist calling it \\"one of the best comics of the year\\" and commercially successful. So, Archie Comics announced a second series to debut in the Winter of 2020 with the same creative team. Characters This is a list and description of the characters that appear in the Sabrina comic books. For information about the characters from the live- action TV sitcom, see List of Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1996 TV series) characters. =Main characters= *Sabrina Spellman: the lead character of the series. In the early comic series, Sabrina is a well-meaning girl, but she struggles with constant pressure to be \\"bad\\" from all the other witches around her, especially her aunts, as well as learning to master her powers. Later comics incarnations (and media spinoffs) present other witches, including her aunts, as largely \\"good,\\" though Sabrina still struggles to fully master her powers. *Hilda Spellman: Sabrina's aunt. In the earlier comics, Hilda is portrayed dressed as and behaving in a more stereotypical witch manner, including being cranky, disliking mortals (particularly Harvey), and prone to using her powers for revenge or resolving petty disputes. The 1990s comics toned down Hilda's cranky behavior and modernized her clothing and physical appearance. *Zelda Spellman: Sabrina's aunt. In the earlier comics, Zelda (like Hilda) also was dressed in stereotypical witch's clothes, but unlike Hilda, was the more compassionate and kindly of the two. The 1990s comics modernized Zelda's clothing and physical appearance. In the earliest comics, she was supposed to find a husband within a year or else lose her powers. *Harvey Kinkle: Sabrina's boyfriend, a mortal who is unaware of Sabrina's being a witch. Harvey is presented as being sweet and loyal, but also accident-prone (similar to Archie). *Salem Saberhagen: the Spellmans' American shorthair cat. Salem was formerly a witch, who was turned into a cat as punishment by the Witches' Council for plotting to take over the world. Salem has the ability to speak and possesses a sarcastic and somewhat self-centered attitude. The name \\"Salem\\" refers to the Salem Witch Trials of 1692. Comics published before the late 1990s presented Salem as an ordinary orange-colored cat unable to speak. Since the late 1990s, Salem inherited the elements of his live-action sitcom counterpart, including the backstory of formerly being a witch, the ability to speak, and being colored black. Since the late 1990s, reprints of earlier Sabrina stories in Archie digests usually recolor Salem as black. =Other recurring characters= *Witches' Council: A council of powerful witches that oversees the other witches. *Enchantra: The Queen of Witches, and head of the Witches' Council.Sabrina the Teenage Witch (vol. 2) #20 (Dec. 1998) Most of her appearances were in Sabrina: Secrets of a Teenage Witch. *Della, the Spellmans' head witch. A strict, short-tempered authority figure, Della does not approve of Sabrina using magic to help others. Della largely appears in the earlier comics.Sabrina the Teenage Witch #12 (June 1973) In the late 1990s comics, she appears as Enchantra's secretary. *Rosalind: Sabrina's arch-enemy in the original comic book stories from Archie's Mad House. She was constantly fighting with Sabrina over the same boys. In later stories, their adversarial relationship is dropped. Instead, Rosalind is depicted as a teenage witch and is much more friendly with Sabrina.Archie's Mad House #28 (Sept. 1963) =Sabrina's cousins= *Ambrose: Sabrina's cousin, a witch. He had an acute sense of fashion and showmanship and, in the Filmation animated series, an effete voice and mannerisms. Ambrose does not appear in any of the later media spin-offs; his role in the comics since the 1990s has largely been replaced by Salem.Sabrina the Teenage Witch #2 (July 1971) He has since returned in the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, along with his cobra familiars, Nag and Nagaina. *Esmeralda: Sabrina's younger cousin from the comic book series who is also a witch, but has an obnoxious, bratty attitude. Her character is similar to Sabrina's young cousin Amanda from the live-action TV sitcom (who was played by actress Melissa Joan Hart's real-life younger sister, Emily Hart).Sabrina the Teenage Witch (vol. 2) #50 (Dec. 2003) *Brucie: Sabrina's young mystical prankster cousin from Sabrina the Teenage Witch #18 (1974) that she has to babysit. *Al: Sabrina's cousin that dresses like a cowboy. He uses magic to help Sabrina's boyfriend Harvey play music in Sabrina the Teenage Witch #2 (1971) =Characters from the Gravestone Heights stories= A 1990s storyline saw Sabrina and her aunts relocate for a time to the town of \\"Gravestone Heights,\\" which is populated by various monsters and creatures.Sabrina's Halloween Spooktacular #1 (1993) *Eye-da: A student from Riverdale High with a giant eyeball for a head. She appeared at least twice in the late 1950s in Archie stories, usually as only an unexpected visual punchline at the end of a typical story featuring Betty and Veronica. However, she became a significant character many years later in one incarnation of Sabrina the Teenage Witch. When Sabrina and her aunts moved to Gravestone Heights, a city inhabited by witches, ghosts and monsters, Eye- da (who seemed less out of place there) became one of Sabrina's best friends. *Francine: Sabrina's ghoulish friend that resembles the Bride of Frankenstein. *Cleara Glass: One of Sabrina's best friends in the Gravestone Heights series. Cleara is an invisible girl, except for her eyes and mouth. *Milton: Sabrina's vampire boyfriend. In the original cast list of Gravestone Heights, Milton is listed as a friend of Sabrina's that is a mummy who is \\"all wrapped up in himself\\", while Sabrina's \\"very vein\\" vampire boyfriend is named Drac. In later comics, it was explained that Milton had to wrap himself up like a mummy to protect himself from the sunlight. *Ms. Reaper: A teacher at Gravestone Heights \\"whose tests are deadly\\". =Characters from the manga stories= *Batty Bartholomew: Called \\"Batty\\" as a nickname because, when his memory was originally erased, he went kind of crazy. One of the original Four Blades leaders. Was Sabrina's tutor and helped her become good again after using the dark side of her wand. Sabrina restored his memory. The \\"new Four Blades\\" have joined forces with the \\"old Four Blades\\" once Sabrina and the other \\"new Four Blades\\" realized the true intentions of the Four Blades movement. *Libby Chessler: A cheerleader, Sabrina's arch-enemy. Libby always is trying to steal Harvey from Sabrina. Libby was introduced in the live-action TV series and is similar to the original version of Rosalind from the comic book series. She was later integrated into the comic books. *Galiena: Wizardress, Czarina of Decree (i.e. chief enforcer) of the Magic Council. She was Sabrina's \\"boss\\" when Sabrina interned there for a summer. *LLandra da Silva: Another teenage witch and Sabrina's best friend. Also lives in the mortal realm, but goes to a different high school. Was, but is no longer, dating Shinji Yamagi. *Professor Lunata: A female satyr who is one of the teachers at Charm School. *Narayan: A teenage merman and LLandra's current boyfriend. He was given the ability to walk on land by Sabrina. He joined the Four Blades after that to get closer to LLandra and also became friends with Sabrina and Shinji. *Amy Reinhardt: Amy is a popular girl at Sabrina's high school who often competes with Sabrina in various forms, but most notably for Harvey's attention. Amy appeared mostly in the comics in the 1990s and 2000s, though her character is similar to Libby from the live action TV series, and Katy from the 1996 TV movie. *Gwenevive Ricci: A mortal goth and wannabe witch who is a friend of Sabrina's. *Queen Seles: Elven sorceress and Queen of the Magic Council. After Seles was \\"rescued\\" by Nocturna and Salem, she went around the magic realm with a \\"family\\", but that never included Salem, Nocturna read his mind believing that he loved her, but she realized all his thoughts were of war and destruction. She tells Sabrina what the Four Blades really did, as well as her story of how she lost all her magic, and why the Mana Tree is dying. *Shinji Yamagi: A teenage witch whom Sabrina met while attending a spellcasting school. He tries to compete with Harvey for Sabrina's affections. In other media =Animated television series= Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1970) In 1970, CBS debuted a Filmation boy-oriented animated superhero fantasy sitcom, The Sabrina the Teenage Witch Show, a spin-off from its popular Archie franchise. It included shorts with her Universal Horror-inspired cousins, the Groovie Goolies, and ran for four seasons, with the Goolies spinning off into their own series in 1971.\\"History of Animation 1961 to 1970\\" http://www.brianlemay.com/History/timeline1961-1970.html Sabrina: The Animated Series In 1999, Melissa Joan Hart provided the voice of Sabrina's two aunts for Sabrina: The Animated Series. This series lasted one season and produced 65 episodes, the television/direct-to-video movie Sabrina: Friends Forever, and the continuation-spinoff series Sabrina's Secret Life. Both of those Sabrina animated shows and the movie are all produced by DIC Entertainment. Unlike the sitcom, the DIC series takes place in the original Archie Comics canon and so the characters live in Greendale. Sabrina: Secrets of a Teenage Witch In 2011, Archie Comics announced plans to produce a new animated series based on Sabrina the Teenage Witch to be released in late 2012. The show featured CGI animation that was produced by MoonScoop, and a brand new look for the Sabrina characters. , The Hub has picked up the series, and it finally debuted on air on October 12, 2013. =Live-action television series= Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1996) In September 1996, the live-action TV movie spawned the Sabrina the Teenage Witch television series. Both the TV-movie and sitcom starred Melissa Joan Hart as Sabrina. The fictional home of the series was moved to Westbridge, Massachusetts.Episode titled \\"Sabrina's Driver's License\\" Her original last name, Spellman, was retained, and her mother was stated to be mortal. The sitcom ran for seven seasons and included two television movies and one soundtrack release. Riverdale On July 23, 2016, at San Diego Comic- Con, K.J. Apa, who portrays Archie Andrews in the darker, subversive live action take on Archie, confirmed that Sabrina will eventually appear in the CW series. Sabrina was originally slated to debut in the show's season one finale, but this was eventually decided against, as showrunner Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa said it would've distracted from the rest of the episode, though she is still being considered for a later season. Chilling Adventures of Sabrina In December 2017, a live-action adaptation of the comic book series Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, produced by Warner Bros. Television and Berlanti Productions, with Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, Lee Toland Krieger, Greg Berlanti, Sarah Schechter, and Jon Goldwater as executive producers, was picked up by the online streaming service Netflix for a two- season order. Starring Kiernan Shipka as Sabrina Spellman, the first part of the series was released worldwide on Netflix on October 26, 2018, the second part was released on April 5, 2019, and the third part was released on January 24, 2020. =Films= Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1996 film) In 1996, the comic was adapted into a live-action made-for-television film of the same name. In this version, Sabrina lives in Riverdale (fictional hometown of the Archie characters), rather than Greendale, as it was in the comic books. Her last name is Sawyer instead of Spellman, also it is said that both her parents are witches. Sabrina Goes to Rome A film starring Melissa Joan Hart, it follows American teenage witch Sabrina and her food-obsessed magical talking cat and mouse to Rome, the last whereabout of her 16th-century aunt Sophia. Sabrina Down Under The third Sabrina film finds the title character trying to save mermaids from environmental pollution and a man trying to alter Australia's waterways.

Harris was a journalist in post-Reconstruction Atlanta, and he produced seven Uncle Remus books. He wrote these stories to represent the struggle in the Southern United States, and more specifically in the plantations. He did so by introducing tales that he had heard and framing them in the plantation context. He wrote his stories in a dialect which was his interpretation of Deep South Negro language of the time. For these framing and stylistic choices, his collection has encountered controversy. Structure \\"Old Plantation Play Song\\", from Uncle Remus, His Songs and His Sayings: The Folk-Lore of the Old Plantation, 1881 Uncle Remus is a collection of animal stories, songs, and oral folklore collected from southern black Americans. Many of the stories are didactic, much like those of Aesop's Fables and Jean de La Fontaine's stories. Uncle Remus is a kindly old freedman who serves as a story-telling device, passing on the folktales like the traditional African griot to children gathered around him. The stories are written in an eye dialect devised by Harris to represent a Deep South Black dialect. Uncle Remus is a compilation of Br'er Rabbit storytellers whom Harris had encountered during his time at the Turnwold Plantation. Harris said that the use of the Black dialect was an effort to add to the effect of the stories and to allow the stories to retain their authenticity. The genre of stories is the trickster tale. At the time of Harris's publication, his work was praised for its ability to capture plantation Black dialect. Br'er Rabbit (\\"Brother Rabbit\\") is the main character of the stories, a character prone to tricks and troublemaking who is often opposed by Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear. In one tale, Br'er Fox constructs a doll out of a lump of tar and puts clothing on it. When Br'er Rabbit comes along, he addresses the \\"tar baby\\" amiably but receives no response. Br'er Rabbit becomes offended by what he perceives as the tar baby's lack of manners, punches it and kicks it, and becomes stuck. Bibliography Harris compiled six volumes of Uncle Remus stories between 1881 and 1907; a further three books were published posthumously, following his death in 1908. * Uncle Remus: His Songs and His Sayings (1881) * Nights with Uncle Remus (1883) * Uncle Remus and His Friends (1892) * The Tar Baby and Other Rhymes of Uncle Remus (1904) * Told by Uncle Remus: New Stories of the Old Plantation (1905) * Uncle Remus and Brer Rabbit (1907) * Uncle Remus and the Little Boy (1910) * Uncle Remus Returns (1918) * Seven Tales of Uncle Remus (1948)  Adaptations in film and other media  Uncle Remus as portrayed by James Baskett in Song of the South =Comics= In 1902, artist Jean Mohr adapted the Uncle Remus stories into a two-page comic story titled Ole Br'er Rabbit for The North American. The McClure Newspaper Syndicate released a Br'er Rabbit Sunday strip drawn by J. M. Cond√© from June 24 to October 7, 1906. An Uncle Remus and His Tales of Br'er Rabbit newspaper Sundays-only strip (King Features Syndicate) ran from October 14, 1945, through December 31, 1972, as an offshoot of the Disney comics strip Silly Symphony. =Films= The stories have inspired at least three feature films: * Walt Disney's Song of the South (1946), a combination of live action and animation with James Baskett as Remus * Ralph Bakshi's film Coonskin (1975), a satire of the Disney film which adapts the Uncle Remus stories to a contemporary Harlem setting * The Adventures of Brer Rabbit (2006), a direct-to video production with hip-hop influences TV *R√©musz b√°csi mes√©i (1967) by Magyar Telev√≠zi√≥ (Hungarian Television) *Brer Rabbit Tales (1991) by Emerald Hill Productions. = Music = Uncle Remus appears heavily as a supporting character in The Residents' rock opera, Not Available, recorded in 1974 and released in 1978. After returning from Easter Island, he provides unhelpful, dismissive advice to the lead character, quoting \\"Well, strangers have left on longer trains before\\", in response to his cries for help and understanding. \\"Uncle Remus\\" is a song by Frank Zappa and George Duke from Zappa's 1974 album Apostrophe (').

It does not count the TCP header or the IP header (unlike, for example, the MTU for IP datagrams).RFC 879, page 2, Section 3, \\"The MSS counts only data octets in the segment, it does not count the TCP header or the IP header.\\" The IP datagram containing a TCP segment may be self-contained within a single packet, or it may be reconstructed from several fragmented pieces; either way, the MSS limit applies to the total amount of data contained in the final, reconstructed TCP segment. To avoid fragmentation in the IP layer, a host must specify the maximum segment size as equal to the largest IP datagram that the host can handle minus the IP and TCP header sizes.RFC 2460, page 28, Section 8.3 Therefore, IPv4 hosts are required to be able to handle an MSS of 536 octets (= 576RFC 879, page 1, Section 1 \\\\- 20 - 20) and IPv6 hosts are required to be able to handle an MSS of 1220 octets (= 1280RFC 2460, page 24, Section 5 \\\\- 40 - 20). Small MSS values will reduce or eliminate IP fragmentation but will result in higher overhead.The TCP/IP Guide, TCP Maximum Segment Size (MSS) and Relationship to IP Datagram Size Each direction of data flow can use a different MSS. For most computer users, the MSS option is established by the operating system. Default value The default TCP Maximum Segment Size is 536.RFC 879, page 1, Section 1, \\"The default TCP Maximum Segment Size is 536.\\" Where a host wishes to set the maximum segment size to a value other than the default, the maximum segment size is specified as a TCP option, initially in the TCP SYN packet during the TCP handshake. The value cannot be changed after the connection is established.RFC 793, page 19, Section 3.1, \\"This field must only be sent in the initial connection request (i.e., in segments with the SYN control bit set).\\" Inter-Layer Communication In order to notify MSS to the other end, an inter-layer communication is done as follows:RFC 879, page 1, Section 11 * The Network Driver (ND) or interface should know the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of the directly attached network. * The IP should ask the Network Driver for the Maximum Transmission Unit. * The TCP should ask the IP for the Maximum Datagram Data Size (MDDS). This is the MTU minus the IP header length (MDDS = MTU - IPHdrLen). * When opening a connection, TCP can send an MSS option with the value equal to: MDDS - TCPHdrLen. In other words, the MSS value to send is: MSS = MTU - TCPHdrLen - IPHdrLen While sending TCP segments to the other end, an inter-layer communication is done as follows:RFC 879, page 1, Section 11 * TCP should determine the Maximum Segment Data Size (MSDS) from either the default or the received value of the MSS option. * TCP should determine if source fragmentation is possible (by asking the IP) and desirable. ** If so, TCP may hand to IP, segments (including the TCP header) up to MSDS + TCPHdrLen. ** If not, TCP may hand to IP, segments (including the TCP header) up to the lesser of (MSDS + TCPHdrLen) and MDDS. * IP checks the length of data passed to it by TCP. If the length is less than or equal MDDS, IP attaches the IP header and hands it to the ND. Otherwise, the IP must do source fragmentation. MSS and MTU MSS is sometimes conflated with MTU/PMTU, which is a characteristic of the underlying link layer, while MSS applies specifically to TCP and hence the transport layer. The two are similar in that they limit the maximum size of the payload carried by their respective protocol data unit (frame for MTU, TCP segment for MSS), and related since MSS cannot exceed the MTU for its underlying link (taking into account the overhead of any headers added by the layers below TCP). However, the difference, in addition to applying to different layers, is that MSS can have a different value in either direction and also that frames exceeding the MTU may end up getting fragmented by the transport layer, while segments exceeding the MSS are simply discarded.

Lippincott Company. The word derives from the Greek () \\"very thirsty\\", which is derived from (, \\"much, many\\") + (, \\"thirst\\"). Polydipsia is a nonspecific symptom in various medical disorders. It also occurs as an abnormal behaviour in some non-human animals, such as in birds. Causes =Diabetes= Polydipsia can be characteristic of diabetes mellitus, often as an initial symptom. It is observed in cases of poorly controlled diabetes, which is sometimes the result of low patient adherence to anti-diabetic medication. Diabetes insipidus (\\"tasteless\\" diabetes, as opposed to diabetes mellitus) can also cause polydipsia. =Other physiological causes= It can also be caused by a change in the osmolality of the extracellular fluids of the body, hypokalemia, decreased blood volume (as occurs during major hemorrhage), and other conditions that create a water deficit. This is usually a result of osmotic diuresis. Polydipsia is also a symptom of anticholinergic poisoning. Zinc is also known to reduce symptoms of polydipsia by causing the body to absorb fluids more efficiently (reduction of diarrhea, induces constipation) and it causes the body to retain more sodium; thus a zinc deficiency can be a possible cause. The combination of polydipsia and (nocturnal) polyuria is also seen in (primary) hyperaldosteronism (which often goes with hypokalemia). Antipsychotics can have side effects such as dry mouth that may make the patient feel thirsty. =Primary polydipsia= Primary polydipsia describes excessive thirst and water intake caused in the absence of physiological stimuli to drink. This includes both psychogenic primary polydipsia and non- psychogenic primary polydipsia, such as in patients with autoimmune chronic hepatitis with severely elevated globulin levels. Psychogenic polydipsia is an excessive water intake seen in some patients with mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, and/or the developmentally disabled. It should be taken very seriously, as the amount of water ingested exceeds the amount that can be excreted by the kidneys, and can on rare occasions be life-threatening as the body's serum sodium level is diluted to an extent that seizures and cardiac arrest can occur. While psychogenic polydipsia is generally not found outside the population of serious mental disorders, there is some anecdotal evidence of a milder form (typically called 'habit polydipsia' or 'habit drinking') that can be found in the absence of psychosis or other mental conditions. The excessive levels of fluid intake may result in a false diagnosis of diabetes insipidus, since the chronic ingestion of excessive water can produce diagnostic results that closely mimic those of mild diabetes insipidus. As discussed in the entry on diabetes insipidus, \\"Habit drinking (in its severest form termed psychogenic polydipsia) is the most common imitator of diabetes insipidus at all ages. While many adult cases in the medical literature are associated with mental disorders, most patients with habit polydipsia have no other detectable disease. The distinction is made during the water deprivation test, as some degree of urinary concentration above isosmolar is usually obtained before the patient becomes dehydrated.\\" However, prior to a water deprivation test, consideration should be given to a psychiatric consult to see whether it is possible to rule out psychogenic polydipsia or habit polydipsia. Diagnosis Polydipsia is a symptom (evidence of a disease state), not a disease in itself. As it is often accompanied by polyuria, investigations directed at diagnosing diabetes insipidus and diabetes mellitus can be useful. Blood serum tests can also provide useful information about the osmolality of the body's extracellular fluids. A decrease in osmolality caused by excess water intake will decrease the serum concentration of red blood cells, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and sodium.

It is a suburb of Lausanne and is served by the Lausanne metro line 1 and several bus lines. The nearest train station is Renens.  History  A Hallstatt era grave was discovered in Dorigny. Three Bronze Age graves were found in Valeyre and several La T√®ne culture graves have been found in Bassenges and Valeyre. A motte (a raised earthen, fortified hill) of an unknown age is found at a place in the municipality which is known as Chateau-de-la-Motte. A connection between the motte and nearby Roman era artifacts has not been established. √âcublens is first mentioned around 958-59 as in villa Escublens. In 964 it was mentioned as Scubilingis in a document recording the property of the cathedral of Lausanne. This document mentions that Scubilingis is situated near Renens. In the 10th Century √âcublens was part of the territory of Renens. Under Bernese rule it was part of the bailiwick of Lausanne and was administered by that court. In 1156, a chapel was built in √âcublens which was under the authority of the Priory of Saint- Sulpice. In 1228 the parish church of St. Peter is first mentioned. By 1453 the parish church was again under the authority of the church of Saint- Sulpice. On 9 May 1476, Charles the Bold, the Duke of Burgundy, gathered his army in √âcublens after his defeat at the Battle of Grandson, in preparation for the Battle of Morat. The area was under the Bernese Occupation from 1536 until 1798, when French troops arrived. On 12 May 1800, Napoleon inspected two divisions of his troops in √âcublens on his way to the Great St Bernard Pass during his Italian campaign of 1800. After the Protestant Reformation included the parish of √âcublens was created, which included Saint-Sulpice and the village of Chavannes. They remained part of the parish until 1966. In 1803 it was made the district capital. In 1909 the General Council was replaced by a local council. During World War II a small aerodrome was operated in √âcublens. As part of the nation's planning for post-war development of aviation, Lausanne planned to expand this facility into one of five regional airports forming a second-tier of airports in the country. This development would permit the disposal of the nearby Bl√©cherett Aerodrome as that location was deemed to be unfeasible for expansion. This plan was not fulfilled, and the √âcublens aerodrome fell into disuse. There was an effort in the 1950s to revive the plan and build an 1100 m runway along with facilities for regional and air taxi operations as the Lausanne-Ecublens Regional Airport (). A two- stage proposal foresaw paving at least one of the smaller grass surface runways as well to support recreational and executive use, but ultimately this plan as well was shelved. Strong growth in the agricultural industry in the 1960s fueled to a population explosion mostly through immigration. In addition, the municipality grew due to the influx of several large companies: in 1959, Socsil AG, in 1962, Socorex Isba AG, in 1964 Nokia-Maillefer Sapal AG, in 1970, ARL AG (Laboratory), in 1972, Leduc-Th√©venaz Sirec AG and in 1979 the administration of Migros Vaud. In the vicinity of the castle built by Etienne de Loys in 1770, the University of Lausanne built the Cantonal and University Library in 1970.

The fortress was built under the guidance of Goloppo, who was an Italian convert to Islam.

About 800 Turkish and 300 Crimean Tatar soldiers were garrisoned in Yeni-Kale. The weak spot of the fortress was a lack of drinking water in the area, so an underground water- pipe was made to bring water from a source located several kilometres away from the fortress. Yeni-Kale also served as a residence of the pasha. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1768‚Äì1774 the Russian Army invaded Crimea in the summer of 1771.

His poems were often visionary, ecstatic, terror-filled, and erotic, exploring the subconscious world of dreams and linking it to daily experiences, while sometimes incorporating typographical arrangements a la concrete poetry. He has posthumously been regarded as \\"the most visionary poet of the American postwar generation\\". Biography Lamantia was born in San Francisco to Sicilian immigrants, and was raised in the city's Excelsior neighborhood. His poetry was first published in View magazine in 1943, when he was fifteen, and in the final issue of the Surrealist magazine VVV the following year. In 1944 he dropped out of Balboa High School to pursue poetry in New York City. He returned to the Bay Area in 1945 and his first book, Erotic Poems, was published a year later. Lamantia was one of the post World War II poets now sometimes referred to as the San Francisco Renaissance, and later became involved with the San Francisco Beat Generation poets and the Surrealist Movement in the United States. He was on the bill at San Francisco's Six Gallery on October 7, 1955, when poet Allen Ginsberg read his poem Howl for the first time. At this event Lamantia chose to read the poems of John Hoffman, a friend who had recently died. Hoffman's poetry collection Journey to the End (which includes the poems that Lamantia read at the Six Gallery) was published by City Lights Bookstore in 2008, bound together with Lamantia's own Tau, a poem-cycle also dating from the mid-fifties. Tau remained unpublished during Lamantia's lifetime. Lamantia was also known for his journeys with native peoples in the United States and Mexico in the 1950s, participating in the peyote-eating rituals of the Washo Indians of Nevada which often inspired his poems. In later life, he embraced Catholicism, the religion of his childhood, and wrote many poems on Catholic themes. Nancy Peters, his wife and literary editor, said of Lamantia, \\"He found in the narcotic night world a kind of modern counterpart to the Gothic castle -- a zone of peril to be symbolically or existentially crossed.\\" Works * Erotic Poems (Berkeley: Bern Porter, 1946) * Ekstasis (San Francisco: Auerhahn Press, 1959) * Narcotica (San Francisco: Auerhahn Press, 1959) * Destroyed Works (San Francisco: Auerhahn Press, 1962) * Touch of the Marvelous ([no place] Oyez, 1966) * Selected Poems 1943‚Äì1966 (San Francisco: City Lights Books, 1967) * Charles Bukowski, Harold Norse, Philip Lamantia: Penguin Modern Poets, No. 13.

Life Mint, Thomas Stanley Little is known of Humfrey's life before 1560, when he is recorded as a member of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths in London, and as a resident of the parish of St Vedast. He obtained the patronage of Sir William Cecil, later Lord Burghley, who 'considered him an expert on metallurgical matters', and provided him with both financial and political backing. Humfrey was appointed Assay Master at the Royal Mint in 1561. German technologists had recently been brought to England to assist with the recoinage of the debased English currency, and through these contacts both Humfrey and Cecil became convinced that German metallurgical techniques could be used in the development of the English mining industry. In particular, Humfrey needed someone knowledgeable about calamine ore, essential to the production of latten and brass, and in 1563 he paid the way to England of a metallurgist from Saxony, Christopher Schutz. In 1564 Schutz, aided by twenty German-speaking workers, built England's first blast furnace at Tintern. In a letter of 16 August 1565 to Sir William Cecil, Humfrey stated that Schutz was 'bound in ¬£10,000 to communicate his art in working metals', and requested that he and Schutz be granted a joint patent. In September 1565 Humfrey and Schutz were granted licences to prospect for calamine in England and in The Pale in Ireland, and to mine and process the ore, being joined in some of their licences with Thomas Smythe, William Williams and Humfrey Cole. Only a few months later, in early 1566, they found calamine in the Mendip Hills in Somerset, and Daniel Hoechstetter designed a refining process by which it could be used in Schutz' furnace at Tintern. According to Hulme, 'the first true brass' produced in England by this new refining process was exhibited in 1568. While these mining ventures were ongoing, Humfrey was embroiled in a scandal at the Mint. In October 1565 the Under-Treasurer of the Mint, Thomas Stanley, had charged Humfrey with robbery. The allegations were confirmed in a confession by Humfrey's colleague, John Bull, Comptroller of the Mint, who admitted that he and Humfrey had attempted to discredit Stanley by stealing money under his control. An investigation followed, and a letter of 10 November from Thomas Smythe expressing the wish that he could deliver Humfrey from his 'unexpected thraldom' suggests that Humfrey was imprisoned for a time. In April 1567 the State Papers record that Humfrey was to be restored to his office of Assay Master. According to Challis, Humfrey could not have survived this episode had he not had the favour of Sir William Cecil. In May 1568 Elizabeth I granted charters for the incorporation of two joint-stock companies, the Society of the Mines Royal, and the Company of Mineral and Battery Works. Humfrey was one of the twenty- four original shareholders in the former Company, and he and Schutz were leading shareholders in the latter, which took over the patents they had obtained from the Queen in 1565 for the 'manufacture of brass, brass and iron wire, battery (the hammering of metal into plates and utensils), and the introduction of new mining and smelting technology'. The extraction of calamine ore at Worle Hill in the Mendips had proved prohibitively expensive for the production of brass, however, and on 28 May 1568 the Company of Mineral and Battery Works took over the operation of the furnace at Tintern, and converted it to the production of iron wire for use in wool-carding, the first such mill in England. However this enterprise also struggled to survive financially. In 1569 Humfrey, having leased a part of his original patents to the Company of Mineral and Battery Works, became involved in the smelting of lead. In about 1570 he and Schutz were responsible for two developments in the English lead industry, the construction of a water-powered lead-smelting furnace at the former Beauchief Abbey near Sheffield, and the use of a German sieve in the processing of ore in Derbyshire. Both these inventions were purportedly protected by Humfrey's earlier patent, which 'covered all subsequent inventions of the patentees in this particular branch of metallurgy'. Humfrey's water-powered smelting mill 'rapidly ousted both traditional boles and footblasts', but Humfrey was unable to stop both its unlicensed use and the unlicensed use of his German sieve, although in 1574 and 1581 injunctions were granted against the owners of lead mines in Derbyshire who were using his methods. The alleged infringements of Humfrey's patents by, among others, George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury, who had built a furnace on his estate at Chatsworth, were investigated after Humfrey's death by four commissions in the Court of Exchequer between 1581 and 1584. As a result of his difficulties in Derbyshire, Humfrey abandoned his interests there, and embarked on a silver-mining venture in Cardiganshire in Wales. According to Kiernan, Humfrey's lead-smelting furnace was far more efficient than the traditional boles, and its eventual widespread adoption enabled rapid expansion of the mining industry after 1570, and the export from England of large quantities of lead. Humfrey did not live to see this, however. In a letter dated 16 October 1578 from Wales he complained to Lord Burghley that his 'impoverishment prevented him from following many good things'.'Cecil Papers: 1578', Calendar of the Cecil Papers in Hatfield House, Volume 13: Addenda (1915), pp. 153‚Äì169 Retrieved 5 November 2013. He died intestate in July 1579. Marriage and issue At an unknown date Humfrey married a wife named Alice, by whom he had two daughters: *Elizabeth Humfrey, who on 30 July 1570 married a merchant taylor, Robert Ledger, in the parish church of St Vedast. *Alice Humfrey, who married an embroiderer, Alexander Fownde.

References ","title":"Lully, Vaud"},{"id":"600500","text":"Scenario planning, also called scenario thinking or scenario analysis, is a strategic planning method that some organizations use to make flexible long- term plans. It is in large part an adaptation and generalization of classic methods used by military intelligence. The original method was that a group of analysts would generate simulation games for policy makers. The methods combine known facts about the future, such as demographics, geography, military, political, industrial information, and mineral reserves, with key driving forces identified by considering social, technical, economic, environmental, and political (STEEP) trends. In business applications, that solely emphasis on understanding the behavior of opponents was reduced (shifting more toward a game against nature). At Royal Dutch/Shell for example, scenario planning was viewed as changing mindsets about the exogenous part of the world, prior to formulating specific strategies. Scenario planning may involve aspects of systems thinking, specifically the recognition that many factors may combine in complex ways to create sometime surprising futures (due to non-linear feedback loops). The method also allows the inclusion of factors that are difficult to formalize, such as novel insights about the future, deep shifts in values, unprecedented regulations or inventions. Systems thinking used in conjunction with scenario planning leads to plausible scenario storylines because the causal relationship between factors can be demonstrated. In these cases when scenario planning is integrated with a systems thinking approach to scenario development, it is sometimes referred to as dynamic scenarios. Critics of using a subjective and heuristic methodology to deal with uncertainty and complexity argue that the technique has not been examined rigorously, nor influenced sufficiently by scientific evidence. They caution against using such methods to \\"predict\\" based on what can be described as arbitrary themes and \\"forecasting techniques\\". Another challenge of scenario-building is that \\"predictors are part of the social context about which they are trying to make a prediction and may influence that context in the process\\". As a consequence, societal predictions can become self- destructing. For example, a scenario in which a large percentage of a population will become HIV infected based on existing trends may cause more people to avoid risky behavior and thus reduce the HIV infection rate, invalidating the forecast (which might have remained correct if it had not been publicly known). Or, a prediction that cybersecurity will become a major issue may cause organizations to implement more security cybersecurity measures, thus limiting the issue. Crafting scenarios These combinations and permutations of fact and related social changes are called \\"scenarios\\". The scenarios usually include plausible, but unexpectedly important situations and problems that exist in some small form in the present day. Any particular scenario is unlikely. However, future studies analysts select scenario features so they are both possible and uncomfortable. Scenario planning helps policy-makers and firms anticipate change, prepare a responses, and create more robust strategies. Scenario planning helps a firm anticipate the impact of different scenarios and identify weaknesses. When anticipated years in advance, those weaknesses can be avoided or their impacts reduced more effectively than when similar real-life problems are considered under the duress of an emergency. For example, a company may discover that it needs to change contractual terms to protect against a new class of risks, or collect cash reserves to purchase anticipated technologies or equipment. Flexible business continuity plans with \\"PREsponse protocols\\" can help cope with similar operational problems and deliver measurable future value. =Zero-sum game scenarios= Strategic military intelligence organizations also construct scenarios. The methods and organizations are almost identical, except that scenario planning is applied to a wider variety of problems than merely military and political problems. As in military intelligence, the chief challenge of scenario planning is to find out the real needs of policy-makers, when policy-makers may not themselves know what they need to know, or may not know how to describe the information that they really want. Good analysts design wargames so that policy makers have great flexibility and freedom to adapt their simulated organisations. Then these simulated organizations are \\"stressed\\" by the scenarios as a game plays out. Usually, particular groups of facts become more clearly important. These insights enable intelligence organizations to refine and repackage real information more precisely to better serve the policy-makers' real-life needs. Usually the games' simulated time runs hundreds of times faster than real life, so policy-makers experience several years of policy decisions, and their simulated effects, in less than a day. This chief value of scenario planning is that it allows policy-makers to make and learn from mistakes without risking career-limiting failures in real life. Further, policymakers can make these mistakes in a safe, unthreatening, game-like environment, while responding to a wide variety of concretely presented situations based on facts. This is an opportunity to \\"rehearse the future\\", an opportunity that does not present itself in day-to-day operations where every action and decision counts. How military scenario planning or scenario thinking is done # Decide on the key question to be answered by the analysis. By doing this, it is possible to assess whether scenario planning is preferred over the other methods. If the question is based on small changes or a very small number of elements, other more formalized methods may be more useful. # Set the time and scope of the analysis. Take into consideration how quickly changes have happened in the past, and try to assess to what degree it is possible to predict common trends in demographics, product life cycles. A usual timeframe can be five to 10 years. # Identify major stakeholders. Decide who will be affected and have an interest in the possible outcomes. Identify their current interests, whether and why these interests have changed over time in the past. # Map basic trends and driving forces. This includes industry, economic, political, technological, legal, and societal trends. Assess to what degree these trends will affect your research question. Describe each trend, how and why it will affect the organisation. In this step of the process, brainstorming is commonly used, where all trends that can be thought of are presented before they are assessed, to capture possible group thinking and tunnel vision. # Find key uncertainties. Map the driving forces on two axes, assessing each force on an uncertain/(relatively) predictable and important/unimportant scale. All driving forces that are considered unimportant are discarded. Important driving forces that are relatively predictable (ex. demographics) can be included in any scenario, so the scenarios should not be based on these. This leaves you with a number of important and unpredictable driving forces. At this point, it is also useful to assess whether any linkages between driving forces exist, and rule out any \\"impossible\\" scenarios (ex. full employment and zero inflation). # Check for the possibility to group the linked forces and if possible, reduce the forces to the two most important. (To allow the scenarios to be presented in a neat xy-diagram) # Identify the extremes of the possible outcomes of the two driving forces and check the dimensions for consistency and plausibility. Three key points should be assessed: ## Time frame: are the trends compatible within the time frame in question? ## Internal consistency: do the forces describe uncertainties that can construct probable scenarios. ## Vs the stakeholders: are any stakeholders currently in disequilibrium compared to their preferred situation, and will this evolve the scenario? Is it possible to create probable scenarios when considering the stakeholders? This is most important when creating macro-scenarios where governments, large organisations et al. will try to influence the outcome. # Define the scenarios, plotting them on a grid if possible. Usually, two to four scenarios are constructed. The current situation does not need to be in the middle of the diagram (inflation may already be low), and possible scenarios may keep one (or more) of the forces relatively constant, especially if using three or more driving forces. One approach can be to create all positive elements into one scenario and all negative elements (relative to the current situation) in another scenario, then refining these. In the end, try to avoid pure best-case and worst-case scenarios. # Write out the scenarios. Narrate what has happened and what the reasons can be for the proposed situation. Try to include good reasons why the changes have occurred as this helps the further analysis. Finally, give each scenario a descriptive (and catchy) name to ease later reference. # Assess the scenarios. Are they relevant for the goal? Are they internally consistent? Are they archetypical? Do they represent relatively stable outcome situations? # Identify research needs. Based on the scenarios, assess where more information is needed. Where needed, obtain more information on the motivations of stakeholders, possible innovations that may occur in the industry and so on. # Develop quantitative methods. If possible, develop models to help quantify consequences of the various scenarios, such as growth rate, cash flow etc. This step does of course require a significant amount of work compared to the others, and may be left out in back-of-the-envelope- analyses. # Converge towards decision scenarios. Retrace the steps above in an iterative process until you reach scenarios which address the fundamental issues facing the organization. Try to assess upsides and downsides of the possible scenarios. =In military applications= Scenario planning is also extremely popular with military planners. Most states' department of war maintains a continuously updated series of strategic plans to cope with well- known military or strategic problems. These plans are almost always based on scenarios, and often the plans and scenarios are kept up-to-date by war games, sometimes played out with real troops. This process was first carried out (arguably the method was invented by) the Prussian general staff of the mid-19th century. Development of scenario analysis in business organizations In the past, strategic plans have often considered only the \\"official future\\", which was usually a straight-line graph of current trends carried into the future. Often the trend lines were generated by the accounting department, and lacked discussions of demographics, or qualitative differences in social conditions. These simplistic guesses are surprisingly good most of the time, but fail to consider qualitative social changes that can affect a business or government. Paul J. H. Schoemaker offers a strong managerial case for the use of scenario planning in business and had wide impact.Schoemaker, Paul J.H. ‚ÄúScenario Planning: A Tool for Strategic Thinking,‚Äù Sloan Management Review. Winter: 1995, pp. 25-40. The approach may have had more impact outside Shell than within, as many others firms and consultancies started to benefit as well from scenario planning. Scenario planning is as much art as science, and prone to a variety of traps (both in process and content) as enumerated by Paul J. H. Schoemaker. More recently scenario planning has been discussed as a tool to improve the strategic agility, by cognitively preparing not only multiple scenarios but also multiple consistent strategies. History of use by academic and commercial organizations Most authors attribute the introduction of scenario planning to Herman Kahn through his work for the US Military in the 1950s at the RAND Corporation where he developed a technique of describing the future in stories as if written by people in the future. He adopted the term \\"scenarios\\" to describe these stories. In 1961 he founded the Hudson Institute where he expanded his scenario work to social forecasting and public policy.Schwartz, Peter. .

One of his most controversial uses of scenarios was to suggest that a nuclear war could be won.Kahn, Herman. Thinking About the Unthinkable. New York: Horizon Press, 1965. Though Kahn is often cited as the father of scenario planning, at the same time Kahn was developing his methods at RAND, Gaston Berger was developing similar methods at the Centre d‚ÄôEtudes Prospectives which he founded in France. His method, which he named 'La Prospective', was to develop normative scenarios of the future which were to be used as a guide in formulating public policy. During the mid-1960s various authors from the French and American institutions began to publish scenario planning concepts such as 'La Prospective' by Berger in 1964Berger, G. \\"Ph√©nom√©nologies du Temps et Prospectives.\\" Presse Universitaires de France, 1964. and 'The Next Thirty-Three Years' by Kahn and Wiener in 1967.Kahn, Herman, and Anthony J. Wiener. \\"The Next Thirty-Three Years: A Framework for Speculation.\\" Daedalus 96 3 (1967): 705-32. By the 1970s scenario planning was in full swing with a number of institutions now established to provide support to business including the Hudson Foundation, the Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International), and the SEMA Metra Consulting Group in France. Several large companies also began to embrace scenario planning including DHL Express, Dutch Royal Shell and General Electric.Godet, Michel, and Fabrice Roubelat. \\"Creating the Future :The Use and Misuse of Scenarios.\\" Long Range Planning 29 2 (1996): 164-71.Godet, Michel, Fabrice Roubelat, and Guest Editors. \\"Scenario Planning: An Open Future.\\" Technological Forecasting and Social Change 65 1 (2000): 1-2. Possibly as a result of these very sophisticated approaches, and of the difficult techniques they employed (which usually demanded the resources of a central planning staff), scenarios earned a reputation for difficulty (and cost) in use. Even so, the theoretical importance of the use of alternative scenarios, to help address the uncertainty implicit in long-range forecasts, was dramatically underlined by the widespread confusion which followed the Oil Shock of 1973. As a result, many of the larger organizations started to use the technique in one form or another. By 1983 Diffenbach reported that 'alternate scenarios' were the third most popular technique for long-range forecasting ‚Äì used by 68% of the large organizations he surveyed.Diffenbach, John. \\"Corporate Environmental Analysis in Large US Corporations,\\" Long Range Planning. 16 (3), 1983. Practical development of scenario forecasting, to guide strategy rather than for the more limited academic uses which had previously been the case, was started by Pierre Wack in 1971 at the Royal Dutch Shell group of companies ‚Äì and it, too, was given impetus by the Oil Shock two years later. Shell has, since that time, led the commercial world in the use of scenarios ‚Äì and in the development of more practical techniques to support these. Indeed, as ‚Äì in common with most forms of long-range forecasting ‚Äì the use of scenarios has (during the depressed trading conditions of the last decade) reduced to only a handful of private-sector organisations, Shell remains almost alone amongst them in keeping the technique at the forefront of forecasting.Wack, Peter. \\"Scenarios: Uncharted Waters Ahead,\\" Harvard Business Review. September‚ÄìOctober, 1985. There has only been anecdotal evidence offered in support of the value of scenarios, even as aids to forecasting; and most of this has come from one company ‚Äì Shell. In addition, with so few organisations making consistent use of them ‚Äì and with the timescales involved reaching into decades ‚Äì it is unlikely that any definitive supporting evidenced will be forthcoming in the foreseeable future. For the same reasons, though, a lack of such proof applies to almost all long-range planning techniques. In the absence of proof, but taking account of Shell's well documented experiences of using it over several decades (where, in the 1990s, its then CEO ascribed its success to its use of such scenarios), can be significant benefit to be obtained from extending the horizons of managers' long-range forecasting in the way that the use of scenarios uniquely does.Mercer, David. \\"Simpler Scenarios,\\" Management Decision. Vol. 33 Issue 4:1995, pp 32-40. =Critique of Shell's use of scenario planning= In the 1970s, many energy companies were surprised by both environmentalism and the OPEC cartel, and thereby lost billions of dollars of revenue by mis-investment. The dramatic financial effects of these changes led at least one organization, Royal Dutch Shell, to implement scenario planning. The analysts of this company publicly estimated that this planning process made their company the largest in the world.Schwartz, Peter. The Art of the Long View. Doubleday, 1991. However other observers of Shell's use of scenario planning have suggested that few if any significant long-term business advantages accrued to Shell from the use of scenario methodology. Whilst the intellectual robustness of Shell's long term scenarios was seldom in doubt their actual practical use was seen as being minimal by many senior Shell executives. A Shell insider has commented \\"The scenario team were bright and their work was of a very high intellectual level. However neither the high level \\"Group scenarios\\" nor the country level scenarios produced with operating companies really made much difference when key decisions were being taken\\". The use of scenarios was audited by Arie de Geus's team in the early 1980s and they found that the decision-making processes following the scenarios were the primary cause of the lack of strategic implementation ), rather than the scenarios themselves. Many practitioners today spend as much time on the decision-making process as on creating the scenarios themselves.Cornelius, Peter, Van de Putte, Alexander, and Romani, Mattia. \\"Three Decades of Scenario Planning in Shell,\\" California Management Review. Vol. 48 Issue 1:Fall 2005, pp 92-109. Use by managers The basic concepts of the process are relatively simple. In terms of the overall approach to forecasting, they can be divided into three main groups of activities (which are, generally speaking, common to all long range forecasting processes): #Environmental analysis #Scenario planning #Corporate strategy The first of these groups quite simply comprises the normal environmental analysis. This is almost exactly the same as that which should be undertaken as the first stage of any serious long-range planning. However, the quality of this analysis is especially important in the context of scenario planning. The central part represents the specific techniques ‚Äì covered here ‚Äì which differentiate the scenario forecasting process from the others in long-range planning. The final group represents all the subsequent processes which go towards producing the corporate strategy and plans. Again, the requirements are slightly different but in general they follow all the rules of sound long-range planning. Process The part of the overall process which is radically different from most other forms of long-range planning is the central section, the actual production of the scenarios. Even this, though, is relatively simple, at its most basic level. As derived from the approach most commonly used by Shell, it follows six steps: #Decide drivers for change/assumptions #Bring drivers together into a viable framework #Produce 7‚Äì9 initial mini-scenarios #Reduce to 2‚Äì3 scenarios #Draft the scenarios #Identify the issues arising =Step 1 ‚Äì decide assumptions/drivers for change= The first stage is to examine the results of environmental analysis to determine which are the most important factors that will decide the nature of the future environment within which the organisation operates. These factors are sometimes called 'variables' (because they will vary over the time being investigated, though the terminology may confuse scientists who use it in a more rigorous manner). Users tend to prefer the term 'drivers' (for change), since this terminology is not laden with quasi-scientific connotations and reinforces the participant's commitment to search for those forces which will act to change the future. Whatever the nomenclature, the main requirement is that these will be informed assumptions. This is partly a process of analysis, needed to recognise what these 'forces' might be. However, it is likely that some work on this element will already have taken place during the preceding environmental analysis. By the time the formal scenario planning stage has been reached, the participants may have already decided ‚Äì probably in their sub-conscious rather than formally ‚Äì what the main forces are. In the ideal approach, the first stage should be to carefully decide the overall assumptions on which the scenarios will be based. Only then, as a second stage, should the various drivers be specifically defined. Participants, though, seem to have problems in separating these stages. Perhaps the most difficult aspect though, is freeing the participants from the preconceptions they take into the process with them. In particular, most participants will want to look at the medium term, five to ten years ahead rather than the required longer-term, ten or more years ahead. However, a time horizon of anything less than ten years often leads participants to extrapolate from present trends, rather than consider the alternatives which might face them. When, however, they are asked to consider timescales in excess of ten years they almost all seem to accept the logic of the scenario planning process, and no longer fall back on that of extrapolation. There is a similar problem with expanding participants horizons to include the whole external environment. Brainstorming In any case, the brainstorming which should then take place, to ensure that the list is complete, may unearth more variables ‚Äì and, in particular, the combination of factors may suggest yet others. A very simple technique which is especially useful at this ‚Äì brainstorming ‚Äì stage, and in general for handling scenario planning debates is derived from use in Shell where this type of approach is often used. An especially easy approach, it only requires a conference room with a bare wall and copious supplies of 3M Post-It Notes. The six to ten people ideally taking part in such face-to-face debates should be in a conference room environment which is isolated from outside interruptions. The only special requirement is that the conference room has at least one clear wall on which Post-It notes will stick. At the start of the meeting itself, any topics which have already been identified during the environmental analysis stage are written (preferably with a thick magic marker, so they can be read from a distance) on separate Post-It Notes. These Post-It Notes are then, at least in theory, randomly placed on the wall. In practice, even at this early stage the participants will want to cluster them in groups which seem to make sense. The only requirement (which is why Post-It Notes are ideal for this approach) is that there is no bar to taking them off again and moving them to a new cluster. A similar technique ‚Äì using 5\\" by 3\\" index cards ‚Äì has also been described (as the 'Snowball Technique'), by Backoff and Nutt, for grouping and evaluating ideas in general.Backoff, R.W. and P.C. Nutt. \\"A Process for Strategic Management with Specific Application for the Non-Profit Organization,\\" Strategic Planning: Threats and Opportunities for Planners. Planners Press, 1988. As in any form of brainstorming, the initial ideas almost invariably stimulate others. Indeed, everyone should be encouraged to add their own Post-It Notes to those on the wall. However it differs from the 'rigorous' form described in 'creative thinking' texts, in that it is much slower paced and the ideas are discussed immediately. In practice, as many ideas may be removed, as not being relevant, as are added. Even so, it follows many of the same rules as normal brainstorming and typically lasts the same length of time ‚Äì say, an hour or so only. It is important that all the participants feel they 'own' the wall ‚Äì and are encouraged to move the notes around themselves. The result is a very powerful form of creative decision- making for groups, which is applicable to a wide range of situations (but is especially powerful in the context of scenario planning). It also offers a very good introduction for those who are coming to the scenario process for the first time. Since the workings are largely self-evident, participants very quickly come to understand exactly what is involved. Important and uncertain This step is, though, also one of selection ‚Äì since only the most important factors will justify a place in the scenarios. The 80:20 Rule here means that, at the end of the process, management's attention must be focused on a limited number of most important issues. Experience has proved that offering a wider range of topics merely allows them to select those few which interest them, and not necessarily those which are most important to the organisation. In addition, as scenarios are a technique for presenting alternative futures, the factors to be included must be genuinely 'variable'. They should be subject to significant alternative outcomes. Factors whose outcome is predictable, but important, should be spelled out in the introduction to the scenarios (since they cannot be ignored). The Important Uncertainties Matrix, as reported by Kees van der Heijden of Shell, is a useful check at this stage.van der Heijden, Kees. Scenarios: The Art of Strategic Conversation. Wiley & Sons, 1996. At this point it is also worth pointing out that a great virtue of scenarios is that they can accommodate the input from any other form of forecasting. They may use figures, diagrams or words in any combination. No other form of forecasting offers this flexibility. =Step 2 ‚Äì bring drivers together into a viable framework= The next step is to link these drivers together to provide a meaningful framework. This may be obvious, where some of the factors are clearly related to each other in one way or another. For instance, a technological factor may lead to market changes, but may be constrained by legislative factors. On the other hand, some of the 'links' (or at least the 'groupings') may need to be artificial at this stage. At a later stage more meaningful links may be found, or the factors may then be rejected from the scenarios. In the most theoretical approaches to the subject, probabilities are attached to the event strings. This is difficult to achieve, however, and generally adds little ‚Äì except complexity ‚Äì to the outcomes. This is probably the most (conceptually) difficult step. It is where managers' 'intuition' ‚Äì their ability to make sense of complex patterns of 'soft' data which more rigorous analysis would be unable to handle ‚Äì plays an important role. There are, however, a range of techniques which can help; and again the Post-It-Notes approach is especially useful: Thus, the participants try to arrange the drivers, which have emerged from the first stage, into groups which seem to make sense to them. Initially there may be many small groups. The intention should, therefore, be to gradually merge these (often having to reform them from new combinations of drivers to make these bigger groups work). The aim of this stage is eventually to make 6‚Äì8 larger groupings; 'mini-scenarios'. Here the Post-It Notes may be moved dozens of times over the length ‚Äì perhaps several hours or more ‚Äì of each meeting. While this process is taking place the participants will probably want to add new topics ‚Äì so more Post-It Notes are added to the wall. In the opposite direction, the unimportant ones are removed (possibly to be grouped, again as an 'audit trail' on another wall). More important, the 'certain' topics are also removed from the main area of debate ‚Äì in this case they must be grouped in clearly labelled area of the main wall. As the clusters ‚Äì the 'mini-scenarios' ‚Äì emerge, the associated notes may be stuck to each other rather than individually to the wall; which makes it easier to move the clusters around (and is a considerable help during the final, demanding stage to reducing the scenarios to two or three). The great benefit of using Post-It Notes is that there is no bar to participants changing their minds. If they want to rearrange the groups ‚Äì or simply to go back (iterate) to an earlier stage ‚Äì then they strip them off and put them in their new position. =Step 3 ‚Äì produce initial mini-scenarios= The outcome of the previous step is usually between seven and nine logical groupings of drivers. This is usually easy to achieve. The 'natural' reason for this may be that it represents some form of limit as to what participants can visualise. Having placed the factors in these groups, the next action is to work out, very approximately at this stage, what is the connection between them. What does each group of factors represent? =Step 4 ‚Äì reduce to two or three scenarios= The main action, at this next stage, is to reduce the seven to nine mini-scenarios/groupings detected at the previous stage to two or three larger scenarios There is no theoretical reason for reducing to just two or three scenarios, only a practical one. It has been found that the managers who will be asked to use the final scenarios can only cope effectively with a maximum of three versions! Shell started, more than three decades ago, by building half a dozen or more scenarios ‚Äì but found that the outcome was that their managers selected just one of these to concentrate on. As a result, the planners reduced the number to three, which managers could handle easily but could no longer so easily justify the selection of only one! This is the number now recommended most frequently in most of the literature. Complementary scenarios As used by Shell, and as favoured by a number of the academics, two scenarios should be complementary; the reason being that this helps avoid managers 'choosing' just one, 'preferred', scenario ‚Äì and lapsing once more into single-track forecasting (negating the benefits of using 'alternative' scenarios to allow for alternative, uncertain futures). This is, however, a potentially difficult concept to grasp, where managers are used to looking for opposites; a good and a bad scenario, say, or an optimistic one versus a pessimistic one ‚Äì and indeed this is the approach (for small businesses) advocated by Foster. In the Shell approach, the two scenarios are required to be equally likely, and between them to cover all the 'event strings'/drivers. Ideally they should not be obvious opposites, which might once again bias their acceptance by users, so the choice of 'neutral' titles is important. For example, Shell's two scenarios at the beginning of the 1990s were titled 'Sustainable World' and 'Global Mercantilism'[xv]. In practice, we found that this requirement, much to our surprise, posed few problems for the great majority, 85%, of those in the survey; who easily produced 'balanced' scenarios. The remaining 15% mainly fell into the expected trap of 'good versus bad'. We have found that our own relatively complex (OBS) scenarios can also be made complementary to each other; without any great effort needed from the teams involved; and the resulting two scenarios are both developed further by all involved, without unnecessary focusing on one or the other. Testing Having grouped the factors into these two scenarios, the next step is to test them, again, for viability. Do they make sense to the participants? This may be in terms of logical analysis, but it may also be in terms of intuitive 'gut-feel'. Once more, intuition often may offer a useful ‚Äì if academically less respectable ‚Äì vehicle for reacting to the complex and ill-defined issues typically involved. If the scenarios do not intuitively 'hang together', why not? The usual problem is that one or more of the assumptions turns out to be unrealistic in terms of how the participants see their world. If this is the case then you need to return to the first step ‚Äì the whole scenario planning process is above all an iterative one (returning to its beginnings a number of times until the final outcome makes the best sense). =Step 5 ‚Äì write the scenarios= The scenarios are then 'written up' in the most suitable form. The flexibility of this step often confuses participants, for they are used to forecasting processes which have a fixed format. The rule, though, is that you should produce the scenarios in the form most suitable for use by the managers who are going to base their strategy on them. Less obviously, the managers who are going to implement this strategy should also be taken into account. They will also be exposed to the scenarios, and will need to believe in these. This is essentially a 'marketing' decision, since it will be very necessary to 'sell' the final results to the users. On the other hand, a not inconsiderable consideration may be to use the form the author also finds most comfortable. If the form is alien to him or her the chances are that the resulting scenarios will carry little conviction when it comes to the 'sale'. Most scenarios will, perhaps, be written in word form (almost as a series of alternative essays about the future); especially where they will almost inevitably be qualitative which is hardly surprising where managers, and their audience, will probably use this in their day to day communications. Some, though use an expanded series of lists and some enliven their reports by adding some fictional 'character' to the material ‚Äì perhaps taking literally the idea that they are stories about the future ‚Äì though they are still clearly intended to be factual. On the other hand, they may include numeric data and/or diagrams ‚Äì as those of Shell do (and in the process gain by the acid test of more measurable 'predictions'). =Step 6 ‚Äì identify issues arising= The final stage of the process is to examine these scenarios to determine what are the most critical outcomes; the 'branching points' relating to the 'issues' which will have the greatest impact (potentially generating 'crises') on the future of the organisation. The subsequent strategy will have to address these ‚Äì since the normal approach to strategy deriving from scenarios is one which aims to minimise risk by being 'robust' (that is it will safely cope with all the alternative outcomes of these 'life and death' issues) rather than aiming for performance (profit) maximisation by gambling on one outcome. Use of scenarios It is important to note that scenarios may be used in a number of ways: a) Containers for the drivers/event strings Most basically, they are a logical device, an artificial framework, for presenting the individual factors/topics (or coherent groups of these) so that these are made easily available for managers' use ‚Äì as useful ideas about future developments in their own right ‚Äì without reference to the rest of the scenario. It should be stressed that no factors should be dropped, or even given lower priority, as a result of producing the scenarios. In this context, which scenario contains which topic (driver), or issue about the future, is irrelevant. b) Tests for consistency At every stage it is necessary to iterate, to check that the contents are viable and make any necessary changes to ensure that they are; here the main test is to see if the scenarios seem to be internally consistent ‚Äì if they are not then the writer must loop back to earlier stages to correct the problem. Though it has been mentioned previously, it is important to stress once again that scenario building is ideally an iterative process. It usually does not just happen in one meeting ‚Äì though even one attempt is better than none ‚Äì but takes place over a number of meetings as the participants gradually refine their ideas. c) Positive perspectives Perhaps the main benefit deriving from scenarios, however, comes from the alternative 'flavors' of the future their different perspectives offer. It is a common experience, when the scenarios finally emerge, for the participants to be startled by the insight they offer ‚Äì as to what the general shape of the future might be ‚Äì at this stage it no longer is a theoretical exercise but becomes a genuine framework (or rather set of alternative frameworks) for dealing with that. Scenario planning compared to other techniques The flowchart to the right provides a process for classifying a phenomenon as a scenario in the intuitive logics tradition.Process for classifying a phenomenon as a scenario in the Intuitive Logics tradition.Scenario planning differs from contingency planning, sensitivity analysis and computer simulations.Schoemaker, Paul J.H. Profiting from Uncertainty. Free Press, 2002. Contingency planning is a \\"What if\\" tool, that only takes into account one uncertainty. However, scenario planning considers combinations of uncertainties in each scenario. Planners also try to select especially plausible but uncomfortable combinations of social developments. Sensitivity analysis analyzes changes in one variable only, which is useful for simple changes, while scenario planning tries to expose policy makers to significant interactions of major variables. While scenario planning can benefit from computer simulations, scenario planning is less formalized, and can be used to make plans for qualitative patterns that show up in a wide variety of simulated events. During the past 5 years, computer supported Morphological Analysis has been employed as aid in scenario development by the Swedish Defence Research Agency in Stockholm.T. Eriksson & T. Ritchey, Adapted from a Paper Presented at the Winchester International OR Conference, England, 2002. This method makes it possible to create a multi-variable morphological field which can be treated as an inference model ‚Äì thus integrating scenario planning techniques with contingency analysis and sensitivity analysis. Combination of Delphi and scenarios Scenario planning concerns planning based on the systematic examination of the future by picturing plausible and consistent images of that future. The Delphi method attempts to develop systematically expert opinion consensus concerning future developments and events. It is a judgmental forecasting procedure in the form of an anonymous, written, multi-stage survey process, where feedback of group opinion is provided after each round. Numerous researchers have stressed that both approaches are best suited to be combined. Due to their process similarity, the two methodologies can be easily combined. The output of the different phases of the Delphi method can be used as input for the scenario method and vice versa. A combination makes a realization of the benefits of both tools possible. In practice, usually one of the two tools is considered the dominant methodology and the other one is added on at some stage. The variant that is most often found in practice is the integration of the Delphi method into the scenario process (see e.g. Rikkonen, 2005;Rikkonen, P. (2005). Utilisation of alternative scenario approaches in defining the policy agenda for future agriculture in Finland. Turku School of Economics and Business Administration, Helsinki. von der Gracht, 2008;von der Gracht, H. A. (2008) The future of logistics: scenarios for 2025. Dissertation. Gabler, ). Authors refer to this type as Delphi-scenario (writing), expert-based scenarios, or Delphi panel derived scenarios. Von der Gracht (2010)von der Gracht, H. A./ Darkow, I.-L.: Scenarios for the Logistics Service Industry: A Delphi-based analysis for 2025. In: International Journal of Production Economics, Vol. 127, No. 1, 2010, 46-59. is a scientifically valid example of this method. Since scenario planning is ‚Äúinformation hungry‚Äù, Delphi research can deliver valuable input for the process. There are various types of information output of Delphi that can be used as input for scenario planning. Researchers can, for example, identify relevant events or developments and, based on expert opinion, assign probabilities to them. Moreover, expert comments and arguments provide deeper insights into relationships of factors that can, in turn, be integrated into scenarios afterwards. Also, Delphi helps to identify extreme opinions and dissent among the experts. Such controversial topics are particularly suited for extreme scenarios or wildcards. In his doctoral thesis, Rikkonen (2005) examined the utilization of Delphi techniques in scenario planning and, concretely, in construction of scenarios. The author comes to the conclusion that the Delphi technique has instrumental value in providing different alternative futures and the argumentation of scenarios. It is therefore recommended to use Delphi in order to make the scenarios more profound and to create confidence in scenario planning. Further benefits lie in the simplification of the scenario writing process and the deep understanding of the interrelations between the forecast items and social factors.

He was known for the combination of his blazing fastball and his very poor vision. With his thick Coke bottle glasses, few batters dared to dig in against Duren. Casey Stengel said, \\"I would not admire hitting against Ryne Duren, because if he ever hit you in the head you might be in the past tense.\\" Career Duren was originally signed by the St. Louis Browns as a free agent before the season. His only game with the franchise, his major league game debut, came on September 25, , by which time the Browns had become the Baltimore Orioles. On September 21, , he was traded to the Kansas City Athletics with Jim Pisoni in exchange for Al Pilarcik and Art Ceccarelli. The Athletics and New York Yankees were frequent trading partners in that era, and on June 15, , Duren, Pisoni, and Harry Simpson were sent to the Yankees for Billy Martin, Ralph Terry, Woodie Held, and Bob Martyn. Duren kept his A's uniform number of 26 with the Yankees. Duren received the first of his three All-Star selections in . He has been retroactively credited with saving 20 games in 1958, the high mark in the American League that year. In 1959, his win‚Äìloss record was much poorer, but his earned run average of 1.88 was the best of his career. Duren was a showman. In those days the Yankee bullpen was a part of the short-porch right field and only a low chain link fence served as the boundary. When called upon by Casey Stengel to relieve, he wouldn't use the gate, but preferred to hop the fence with one hand and begin a slow walk to the mound with his blue Yankee warm-up jacket covering his pitching arm; he followed this routine even on the hottest days. When he finally took the ball and began his warmups, the first pitch was sometimes a hard fastball 20 feet over the catcher's head. The succeeding warmup pitches would be thrown lower and lower (but not slower) until Duren would finally \\"find\\" the plate. He was so wild that he allegedly hit a player in the on-deck circle. Duren stayed with the Yankees until May 8, , when he was traded to the Los Angeles Angels; Duren, Johnny James, and Lee Thomas went to the Angels in exchange for Tex Clevenger and Bob Cerv.Yanks, Angels complete six player trade Shortly after being traded to the Angels, he struck out seven successive Red Sox batters, then an American League record. He was sold to the Philadelphia Phillies before the season. Early in the season, he was shipped to the Cincinnati Reds. Released by Cincinnati in April , he was signed by the Phillies; after being released two months later, he joined the Washington Senators, but was released again on August 24 to bring a close to his 10-year Major League career. Personal In , Duren was presented with the Yankee Family Award for his conquering alcoholism, and for service as an alcohol abuse educator. In 2003, Duren and author Tom Sabellico wrote the book, I Can See Clearly Now. Duren talks from the heart about life, baseball and alcohol. The foreword was written by Jim \\"Mudcat\\" Grant. Duren's nephew is singer Blackie Lawless of the heavy metal band W.A.S.P. Baseball Hall of Famer Ryne Sandberg was named in honor of Duren. Duren was the inspiration for the character Ricky \\"Wild Thing\\" Vaughn in the movie Major League, according to its author and director David S. Ward.

The dyed fabric shows a design of large, repeating white squares with softened corners, with spider-like lines of indigo fanning out from a small, central indigo dot; the lines are uneven and cut through with thin white stripes where the thread has been tied around the fabric before dyeing. Some squares have been left undyed, and form dark indigo squares contrasting with the white. Lying just on top of the fabric's right-hand edge is a thin rectangle of fabric that has been tied into long, thin cones, ready for dyeing; the fabric resembles something close to a sheepskin, as the cones are long and very tightly-packed, leaving untied fabric only at each end.

History Some discussion exists as to the origin of as a technique within Japan, and indeed, the exact country of origin of some of the earliest surviving examples. Much of the debate surrounds the technical capacities within Japan at the time to produce the variety of fabrics seen in some of the earliest examples. One of the earliest written descriptions of dates to 238 C.E., where it was recorded in the Chinese document Chronicles of the Clans of () that Queen gifted the Emperor of the dynasty over two hundred yards of \\"spotted cloth\\" ‚Äì potentially describing a form of wax-resist decoration on the fabric. The earliest surviving examples of -dyed cloth date back to the mid-8th century, donated to the Buddhist temple in in 756 C.E. upon the death of Emperor . The techniques seen on these earliest fragments show bound resists, wax resists and folded and clamped resists. Many of the possessions in this collection, however, are Chinese in origin, and none of the examples surviving from the eighth century can be proven indisputably Japanese in origin. Surviving examples of resist-dyeing in China (known as ) date to a much earlier time period; the earliest surviving examples dating to 418 C.E. Techniques alt=A rectangular length of fabric, appearing to be relatively fragile in places, backed onto navy-blue silk. In places, the fabric has torn with age, and there are some sections of the fabric entirely missing, with parts clearly hanging on to others by little more than a thread; the right- hand side is especially affected, with a large square at the lower right-hand corner entirely missing. At the top, we see the fabric is woven with a small, repeating pattern of interlocking swastikas () and flowers, a type of figured silk known as , commonly and typically worn in autumn. The fabric is split into two sections, where roughly a fifth at the top is left undyed, now aged to a warm, light grey colour, with the remaining portion dyed a deep blue- purple. The sections are starkly split apart by a wave-like line, and it's clear that the top portion was reserved from the dye when the lower portion was dyed dark blue. The wave at the top is emphasised by the addition of embroidery in the form of smaller waves on the right above the line, and a small portion of cherry blossoms on the left, also above the line; both are embroidered in light pink, gold and royal blue. Within the dark blue portion of the fabric, we see a pattern of small, repeating dots, where a tiny circle of fabric has been drawn up and wrapped with thread, leaving a thick (though still small) border of light grey fabric with a pinprick of dark blue in the centre. These dots form a tortoiseshell pattern (known as ), and we see that it forms a large, wave-edged section within the fabric; the sections of dark blue fabric bordering this wave are not patterned with -shaped , but are instead decorated with a random scatter of resist-dyed dots and cherry blossom embroidery mostly centered around the bottom and top edges, with some of the cherry blossoms considerably larger than others. At the very lower left-hand corner of the fabric, we see the intrusion of the original light-grey fabric again, embroidered with a single cherry blossom in light pink with stylised dark-green and light-green leaves. On the lower right-hand corner of the remaining fabric, we also see the same light-grey fabric, this time embroidered with a crowded wave pattern done in light blue, gold and what has now faded to a dull, mahogany brown. There are many ways to create , with techniques generally grouped into three categories: , tied or bound resists; , wax resists; and , resists where the fabric is folded and clamped between two carved wooden blocks. Most techniques recognised within these three categories have names and a number of varieties of technique. The technique chosen and the resulting dyed fabric depends upon both the type of fabric and the dyestuff used; demands a pliant and easy-to-handle fabric, with some historic dyeing techniques ‚Äî such as the original technique of ‚Äî now impossible to recreate due to the fact that the fabric necessary for the technique is no longer produced. The desired end result for may be to create a larger pictographic or geometric design (as seen on many full- kimono), or simply to display the on its own. Differing techniques may be combined in some cases to achieve increasingly more elaborate results.  is what is commonly thought of in the West as tie-dye. It involves binding certain sections of the cloth using thread ‚Äî traditionally a type of untwisted thread known as ‚Äî to achieve the desired pattern. The pattern achieved depends on how tightly the cloth is bound and where the cloth is bound. If random sections of the cloth are bound, the result will be a pattern of random circles. If the cloth is first folded then bound, the resulting circles will be in a pattern depending on the fold used.  is also known as looped binding. It involves taking a hooked needle and plucking sections of the cloth. Then a thread is looped around each section twice. The thread is not knotted; tension is the only thing that holds the sections in place. The resulting dyed cloth is a water- like design. Because no knot is used, is very easy to bind and unbind, making this technique commonly used.  is a pleated and bound resist. This technique involves pleating sections of the cloth very finely and evenly. Then the cloth is bound in very close sections. The result is a very specific spider-like design. This specific design requires very precise technique.  includes stitched . A simple running stitch is used on the cloth then pulled tight to gather the cloth. The thread must be pulled very tight to work, and a wooden dowel must often be used to pull it tight enough. Each thread is secured by knotting before being dyed. This technique allows for greater control of the pattern and greater variety of pattern, but it is much more time consuming.  is also known as pole-wrapping . The cloth is wrapped on a diagonal around a pole. Then the cloth is very tightly bound by wrapping thread up and down the pole. Next, the cloth is scrunched on the pole. The result is a pleated cloth with a design on a diagonal. \\"\\" is the Japanese word for storm. The patterns are always on a diagonal in which suggest the driving rain of a heavy storm.  is a shaped-resist technique. Traditionally, the cloth is sandwiched between two pieces of wood, which are held in place with string. More modern textile artists can be found using shapes cut from acrylic or plexiglass and holding the shapes with C-clamps. The shapes prevent the dye from penetrating the fabric they cover.

It is a large, shallow estuary that while connected to the Gulf of Mexico, has limited exchange of water due to various shallow mudbanks covered with seagrass. The banks separate the bay into basins, each with its own unique physical characteristics. Description Encompassing roughly one- third of Everglades National Park, Florida Bay is variously stated to be ,Everglades National Park, Park Vision or ,Florida Bay, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online or .The Ecology of Florida Bay, by Daniel Phirman Nearly all of Florida Bay is included in Everglades National Park. The southern edge, along the Florida Keys, is in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. The bay muds of portions of Florida Bay have been cored to develop insights on the paleontology of previous biota. The bay receives freshwater from two major drainage basins: Shark River Slough and Taylor Slough. The clean freshwater delivered by these sloughs is essential for maintaining water levels and preventing salinity levels from getting too high. The bay currently receives less than half of the freshwater from the sloughs compared to historic, pre- drainage conditions.  Flora and fauna  The bay's many basins that are broken up by banks serve as plentiful fishing grounds for snook (Centropomus undecimalis), redfish (Sciaenops ocellatus), spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus), tarpon (Megaflops atlanticus), bonefish (Albula vulpes), and permit (Trichinous falcatus), among others. The bay is home to many species of wading birds. Most notably, Roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), Reddish egrets (Egretta rufescens), and Great White Herons (Ardea herodias occidentalis) have unique subpopulations that are largely restricted to Florida Bay. Other bird species include Bald eagles, seagulls, pelicans, sandpipers, cormorants, ospreys, and flamingos. Bay land animals include raccoons, opossums, bobcats, and fox squirrels. Environmental issues Florida Bay has undergone a series of ecological changes beginning in the late 1980s that have severely altered the ecosystem. Originally, clean freshwater flowed south through the state into the Florida Bay. To support the state's agricultural water needs, namely for sugar cultivation, the water was rerouted and no longer flows into the Bay, causing numerous and severe environmental issues and loss of native wildlife. =Seagrass die-off= Rafts of dead seagrass in Florida Bay. 2015. The rerouting of the flow of freshwater to the Bay coupled with periods of drought have caused massive seagrass die-offs. The first major die-off occurred from 1987 to 1991 as thousands of hectares of turtlegrass beds (Thalassia testudinum) were devastated by high levels of toxic dissolved sulfide. 10,000 acres died in the central and western bay, and almost 60,000 additional acres suffered reduced productivity and biomass as a result. Then, following the 2015 drought, extreme temperatures and heightened salinity reduced the amount of oxygen that could remain dissolved in the water, causing periods of anoxia during nighttime and thereby damaging the health of the turtlegrass in the bay. During the summer and fall of 2015, approximately 40,000 areas of seagrass died. Red = area containing dead turtle grass in patches of varying size; not 100% dead. Yellow = mixed live/dead impacted areas. Green = healthy turtle grass. Striped area = dense seagrass most at risk of die-off expansion. =Hyper-salinity= The 2015 drought period of low precipitation combined with high temperatures and calm winds that produced rapid evaporation caused salinity to increase in the semi- enclosed basins in north-central Florida Bay. Without the freshwater, the water has become stagnant and salty with excess nitrogen from the fertilizer.Robert Mcclure And Don Melvin. (1993). \\"The Dead Zone Once A Teeming Marine Nursery, Florida Bay Today Is Dying\\". SunSentinel This hyper- salinity contributes to the massive seagrass die-offs and algal blooms, and kills submerged aquatic vegetation. = Algae blooms = Cyanobacterial harmful algae blooms (also known as blue-green algae) have flourished in the bay due to a variety of environmental stressors: Agricultural fertilizer run- off increases nutrients in the delicately balanced environment and the excess increases the bacteria's rate of growth; The newly hyper-saline environment provides an ideal breeding ground for cyanobacteria; Rafts of dead seagrass floating on the surface of the water as well as decaying on the bay bottom leads to anoxia and in turn, algal blooms. Blue-green algae causes numerous severe health consequences for the marine ecosystem as well surrounding human populations. Blooms result in reduced dissolved oxygen concentrations, alterations in aquatic food webs, algal scum lining the shores, the production of compounds that cause distasteful drinking water and fish flesh, and the production of toxins severe enough to poison aquatic as well as terrestrial organisms. Blooms have been reported throughout the continental United States, and resulting cyanotoxins have been associated with human and animal illness and death in at least 43 states.Hudnell, H.K., ed., 2008, Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms‚Äì State of the science and research needs: Advances in Experi- mental Medicine and Biology, v. 619, 950 p. Most cyanobacteria produce the neurotoxin beta-N-methylamino-l-alanine (BMAA) that has been implicated as a significant environmental risk in the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). The cyanobacteria has also been linked to liver cancer, chronic fatigue illness, skin rashes, abdominal cramps, nausea, diarrhea and vomiting. The 2002 algal bloom in the central portion of the Florida Bay was associated with high concentrations of dissolved organic nitrogen and organic phosphorus, whereas the eastern bay regions bloom was associated with high concentration of inorganic nutrients. = Loss of native wildlife = By the mid 1930s, the three main species of wading birds in the bay (Roseate spoonbills, Reddish egrets, Great herons) were driven to near extinction by human harvesting for food and feathers. The cyanobacteria create an oxygen-free environment teaming with toxic gases, creating an unsuitable living environment for many marine and terrestrial animal species.David Biello, (2008). \\"Oceanic Dead Zones Continue to Spread\\". Scientific American As a result, seasons during which algal blooms flourish cause a temporary loss in wildlife. Spotted seatrout populations in the coasted Everglades are declining. As the second most commonly caught species of fish in the Florida Bay, spotted seatrout comprise a large portion of the fishing industry and are integral to the ecosystem as well as surrounding economy. Water temperature of less than and salinity levels below 37.5 parts per thousand (ppt) are ideal for seatrout spawning; however, water management stations in the Everglades and Florida Bay reported salinity levels of 64.4 ppt in July 2015 and recorded water temperatures of up to . These environmental conditions are far from ideal for the seatrout and add additional difficulties for the survival of juveniles as well as important prey such as larval shrimp and small fish.  Economy  The bay is an economic and environmental asset. , the recreational fishing industry in Florida Bay had an estimated value of $7.1 billion, and generated $73 million in federal, state and local taxes annually, while the bay's commercial fishing industry had an estimated value of $400 million, and generated $3 million in taxes.  Water management projects  Various projects are funded by the government in an attempt to manage the hydrology issues present in the Florida Bay, including the C-111 South Dade, Modified Water Deliveries, and C-111 Spreader Canal Western Project from the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP). These projects seek to distribute more freshwater into the sloughs but do not deliver additional water to the bay.

The complex contains multiple event spaces, including a 354-seat auditorium, formerly Giant Screen IMAX cinema; Birmingham Science Museum, Birmingham School of Acting and Birmingham City University's Faculty of Computing, Engineering and The Built Environment, part of Birmingham Metropolitan College. The building is owned by the Millennium Point Charitable Trust with a percentage of profits from the organisation's commercial activity being invested into projects, events and initiatives which support science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) and education in the West Midlands. In 2018, the Millennium Point Charitable Trust contributed more than ¬£4.8 million to the region through their charitable work. Millennium Point is the last surviving project of the Millennium Commission to still exist outside of London. The complex was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 2 July 2002, although it had been in use since the previous year. Occupants The purpose of the complex is primarily educational, and as such is home to Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum. The largest tenant of the building is currently the Faculty of Technology, Engineering and the Environment - the technology faculty of Birmingham City University. The university also operates the Birmingham School of Acting on site. Design Millennium Point is a Millennium Commission project, and it was designed by Nicholas Grimshaw and Partners. Construction is estimated to have cost ¬£114 million, and ¬£50 million funding was granted by the National Lottery. The building is constructed mainly as a cuboid, with a cylindrical offshoot holding the cinema. This annexe glows different colours at night. The front facade is mainly glass, and is covered in long slats with the logo of Millennium Point revealed behind. Previous attractions A major attraction within Millennium Point was the Giant Screen Cinema, which extended into the complex's atrium. After a 10-year deal with IMAX ended, Millennium Point made the commercial decision to become an independent large-screen movie theatre. They renovated the cinema, including replacing the original silver coated IMAX screen with a brand new white screen that was installed through the roof. Barco 4K digital projectors, paired with Dolby Digital 3D technology were fitted, along with a major update to the existing 15000 W sound system. The decision was made to close the Giant Screen Cinema at the beginning of 2015 with the announcement being made on 5 September 2014. Millennium Point was the location of Birmingham's annual \\"Christmas Lights Switch On\\" event. The 2008 event saw fairground rides and live music, including performances by Alesha Dixon, Alphabeat and Scouting for Girls, with Lemar switching on the lights. Previous events have hosted sets by Leona Lewis and McFly. In May 2006, the atrium of the building was used to host a theatrical extravaganza, From Ithaca With Love, a modern retelling of Homer's The Odyssey, which was the launch event of the New Generation Arts Festival. Produced by Simon M. Woods and adapted and directed by Malachi Bogdanov, the event required blacking out the roof and windows and incorporated both a speedboat and Lotus car. In June 2006, the front car park was converted into a viewing area for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, including a large 6m √ó 10m digital screen. On 19 July 2006, the screen was strengthened to withstand strong winds, but eventually it collapsed. For safety reasons, subsequent games were shown on a smaller, temporary screen. At around the same time, and over a period of two days, 20,107 people drew around their feet on A4 pieces of paper and placed them outside Millennium Point to create the longest display of footprints. In 2008, Millennium Point hosted the Hello Digital arts festival. The focus was interactive multimedia, and numerous performances of the Birmingham ElectroAcoustic Sound Theatre were held. In 2009, the Christmas Lights Switch- On was cancelled over safety concerns which resulted in the Millennium Point Concert Stampede. Larger than expected numbers turned up and were locked out of the event, due to overcrowding. Subsequently, the locked-out crowd broke down the fencing, causing a stampede, leaving dozens injured and the event cancelled. In the last few years, Millennium Point has become a hub of activity for events that have been publicised around the city. In both 2014 and 2015, Millennium Point hosted the Birmingham Independent Food Fair alongside Food Birmingham which saw a number of exhibitors descend onto the premises both inside and on the grass area outside to create a weekend celebrating local food and drink traders and what they have to offer. Millennium Point hosts many public-facing events, notable examples of which have included the UK version of the World Barista Championship and Crowd Out - an exclusive performance by Pulitzer Prize-winning American composer David Lang alongside the Birmingham Contemporary Music Group. Events with an educational focus have included hosting the Anne Frank Trust UK traveling exhibit \\"Anne Frank + You\\" in 2015. The organisation supports growth within the Eastside area and the city as a whole and has hosted events such as the High Speed 2 rail line panel discussions and the \\"Birmingham Made Me\\" event promoting local industries in 2014 and 2015. Ongoing development Millennium Point is located adjacent to the current Eastside Locks development and also the planned future High Speed 2 rail station and terminus. The former front car park is now Eastside City Park and a replacement multi-storey car park has been built to the rear of the building fronting Jennens Road to provide access for visitors to Millennium Point, Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum and Birmingham City University.

It achieves this by promoting research, conservation and education, and by widening access to archaeology through effective communication and participation. History and objectives The origins of the CBA lie in the Congress of Archaeological Societies, founded in 1898, but it was in 1943, with the tide of war turning, that archaeologists in Britain began to contemplate the magnitude of tasks and opportunities that would confront them at the end of hostilities. In London alone more than 50 acre of the City lay in ruins awaiting redevelopment, while the historic centres of Bristol, Canterbury, Exeter, Southampton, and many other towns had suffered devastation. In response to a resolution from the Oxford Meeting of the Society for the Promotion of Roman Studies, Sir Alfred Clapham, then President of the Society of Antiquaries of London, called a meeting of the Congress of Archaeological Societies \\"to discuss the requirements of archaeology in the post-war period\\". As a result, it was agreed to form a Council for British Archaeology to promote, both collectively and through its members, British archaeology in all its aspects. The new Council defined one of its objectives as the \\"safeguarding of all kinds of archaeological material and the strengthening of existing measures for the care of ancient and historic buildings, monuments, and antiquities\\". Following its first meeting in March 1944 under Clapham's Presidency (he was succeeded later that year by Sir Cyril Fox), the Council initiated local excavation committees in a number of war-damaged towns, began to seek information about reconstruction projects, and set its Regional Groups the task of watching sites of all kinds. The Congress of Archaeological Societies was quickly wound up, and one of the tasks that the CBA inherited from it was the drawing up of a Survey and Policy for Field Research, which was seen as fundamental to an integrated approach to the exploration of Britain's heritage. This monumental task was undertaken by Christopher Hawkes and Stuart Piggott (both subsequently CBA Presidents) and the first volume appeared in 1948. The CBA also recognised the need for adequate bibliographical backup for British archaeology, and the first volume of its regular Archaeological Bulletin (later renamed the Archaeological Bibliography,) and now the online British and Irish Archaeological Bibliography first appeared in 1949. Within five years the CBA had established the direction of its programme and key roles. It provides a forum and acts as a facilitator for opinion, ideas and policy development in British archaeology, connecting government, the media, and the public. It champions archaeology at all levels in education. It promotes and supports research, in the professional and voluntary sectors alike, with the essential services of its bibliographic information, digital resources, and publications. Today British archaeology is served by scores of specialist and thematic societies and groups. This busy scene did not exist in the early 1950s, when the Council set up six period-based Research Committees, spanning the whole of Britain's past from the Palaeolithic to the post-medieval period which, along with the Natural Sciences Panel (set up as early as 1945) had the remit of coordinating earlier initiatives, providing guidance where required, and establishing new projects on a national basis. In 1959 the CBA set up the first Industrial Archaeology Committee in the world. In 1965, the CBA's response to the Buchanan report Traffic in Towns introduced the concept of historic urban areas, as opposed to individual buildings or sites. Further CBA specialist Committees were established throughout the 1960s to 1980s. One of these led to the creation of the organisation which became the Chartered Institute for Archaeologists. Further information on their many and varied remits, and the organisations which they then became, can be found here. Today the CBA's work is focused on three strategic areas: participation, discovery and advocacy which bring together its wide-ranging activities in education, research, publication, and information provision. More recently the CBA has adopted \\"archaeology for all\\" as its focus, concentrating on increasing opportunities for participation and learning through archaeology and the care of the historic environment. They work in partnership with many other heritage and environmental bodies and with educational and research institutions across the UK. As one of the National Amenity Societies, the Council is a statutory consultee on alterations to listed buildings, and by law must be notified of any applications in England and Wales to demolish in whole or part any listed building. Membership Until 1993, membership of the CBA was limited to societies and organisations. Today there are over 600 institutional members, which range from village archaeological groups to museums, county societies, universities, commercial archaeological units and national bodies. Individual membership has climbed steadily since its introduction in 1993, and now exceeds 6,000. Through the eleven English Regional Groups, CBA Wales/Cymru and the Council for Scottish Archaeology (all of which have individual membership), the CBA provides a unique forum for the British archaeological community, and the public beyond. Members of the CBA help to ensure they have the resources to develop their work in education, conservation and providing information, and strengthen the profile of archaeology in the minds of decision-makers. Members receive: * Six issues of the CBA's flagship magazine British Archaeology, including CBA Briefing, with lists of projects and events * Three issues a year of the CBA Newsletter, with news of the latest CBA projects and initiatives * Membership of a CBA English regional group with access to local meetings, newsletters, activities and publications; or membership of national groups in Scotland or Wales for a small additional fee * An annual 16pp booklet featuring all Festival of British Archaeology events (see below) * Discounts on publications and access to events Young people up to the age of 16 can join their local Young Archaeologists' Club supported by the CBA. Research priorities From its earliest years, the CBA has invested strongly in research support services for the UK archaeological community through its publication programme and latterly through a growing range of web- based resources and services. In addition to its role in facilitating, convening and disseminating the research of others, it has maintained its own programme of research. The CBA's track record is principally in applied research to support its programmes in education, public participation and environmental protection. The CBA has also led research in key areas such as the impact of metal detecting on archaeology, television archaeology and the media, education outside the classroom, and assessment of information and data management needs for archaeology. The Mick Aston Archaeology Fund and the Marsh Award for Community Archaeology aim to foster and celebrate voluntary research in the historic environment. Research themes relate to the CBA's central aim to increase opportunities for participation and learning through archaeology. Priority areas for research in partnership with major heritage organisations and other bodies in the sector are: 1) Archaeology in the classroom and beyond: developing local and national identities 2) Social outcomes and impacts of community archaeology and conservation projects 3) Adapting archaeology: mediating climate change histories 4) Innovation in managing digital media and serving up archaeological information to a wide audience The CBA provides research support services through the CBA website, the TORC(Training Online Resource Centre) website, with its online guide to educational and research opportunities, and the extensive programme of publication and electronic dissemination outlined below. Information provision and publishing The CBA provides electronic access to archaeological materials, information, interpretations and discussion. It has published almost 200 books since 1945. Today, these publications take two main forms: the Research Report series publishes monographs of research into the archaeology of Britain, largely deriving from excavation, buildings and landscape surveys. The Practical Handbooks series is methodological, and aims to present straightforward summaries of topics for those new to a particular specialism. Further details of these are available on the website. It also publishes British Archaeology, a bi-monthly news magazine aimed at both the general reader and the academic. Since 1997, it has published the e-journal Internet Archaeology. Since 1949, it has overseen the compilation of a comprehensive archaeological bibliography, now available free-of-charge online as the British and Irish Archaeological Bibliography. A programme of digitisation has enabled free, electronic access to much of the CBA's back catalogue of publications, including British Archaeology and many books and occasional papers. Events The flagship CBA event each year is The Festival of Archaeology, held in July. This two-week event brings together around 500 excavation open days, guided tours, exhibitions, lectures, ancient art and craft workshops and much more. Over a hundred thousand people take part. In September, the Weekend Event brings together CBA members and specialists to examine the archaeology of a particular region of the UK. The weekend also includes the annual Beatrice de Cardi lecture, in honour of the CBA‚Äôs first permanent secretary, and the CBA AGM. Each year, the CBA hosts its Winter General Meeting at the British Academy, featuring a series of lectures on a theme linking archaeology with a related discipline. In addition, the twelve CBA English Regional Groups, CBA Wales/Cymru and Archaeology Scotland (formerly the Council for Scottish Archaeology), along with Branches of the Young Archaeologists‚Äô Club, hold over a thousand events each year throughout the UK.

They are typically not played directly by the performer (except occasionally as an effect), only indirectly through the tones that are played on the main strings, based on the principle of sympathetic resonance. The resonance is most often heard when the fundamental frequency of the string is in unison or an octave lower or higher than the catalyst note, although it can occur for other intervals, such as a fifth, with less effect. Description Sympathetic strings are used to enhance the sound of an instrument. Some instruments have only a few sympathetic strings such as the Hardanger fiddle (pictured above right). Other instruments which have more include the sitar with 11-13 sympathetic strings and sarod with 15 sympathetic strings, and the sarangi which has a total of 37 sympathetics. In Western music, some members of the viola family appeared in the middle of the 17th century which were fitted with an extra choir of thin wire strings running through a hollow chamber through the neck of the instrument, the head of which was then elongated to accommodate as many extra tuning pegs as necessary. These were generally called viola d'amore; another historical example is the baryton, for which Haydn wrote many trios. Other instruments such as the harp, lute, guitar, harpsichord and piano do not have additional strings, but make use of the effect by allowing their playing strings to vibrate sympathetically when they are not being played directly. In keyboard instruments like the piano, the string dampers can be raised to produce this effect. The guitar is normally unable to produce effective sympathetic string resonance for tones other than E (resonance from the 6th and 5th strings, tuned to E and A, respectively), B (from the 6th string), D (from the 4th string), and A (from the 5th and 4th strings). (The treble strings are negligible in practice, as they are almost constantly being fingered.) However, the ten-string guitar invented in 1963 by Narciso Yepes, adds four strings tuned to C, A, G, F, which resolves the imbalance of resonance on the guitar. By adding the abovementioned resonances and, of course, their fifths (the fifth being a strong resonant frequency)--that is to say, G, F, D, C--the guitar's strings now resonate more equally with all 12 notes of the chromatic scale, bringing the guitar's sound closer to the consistency and sustainability of the harpsichord and piano.Ramirez III, Jose. 1994. \\"The Ten-String Guitar\\" in Things About the Guitar. Bold Strummer. pp. 137-141. Yepes, Narciso. 1981 \\"Narciso Yepes and His 10-String Guitar\\". Interview-Article by Allan Kozinn. The New York Times, Nov. 22: p.

Sympathetic string resonance in music instruments Strings or parts of strings may resonate at their fundamental or harmonic frequencies when other strings are sounded. In general, non-played strings respond in sympathy to other strings being played. Two tones of the same pitch will give maximum sympathetic resonance as all harmonics of both strings will overlap. Other harmonic combinations will cause sympathetic resonance at the fifth, fourth and major third. For example, an A string at 440 Hz will cause an E string at 330 Hz to resonate, because they share an overtone of 1320 Hz (third overtone of A and fourth overtone of E). =Tuning= The musician retunes the sympathetic strings for each mode or raga, so that when the corresponding note (or one an octave below it) is played on the main strings of the instrument, the sympathetic strings (called tarabs in Indian music) will vibrate in response, providing a lingering halo of sound.

Calls This species of African barbet is known to duet year-round, unlike other species that only duet during breeding season. The L. vieilloti has been reported to \\"yodel\\", which is a succession of two flute-like notes which are uttered by two birds sitting on a bough as they bow ceremoniously to each other. This yodel is immediately answered by the other bird of the pair with the sound \\"poop-poop\\". The duet seems to be initiated by a snarl like the Lybius torquatus. The duets are considered quite unusual because the birds call with different rhythms. Other duetting pairs have occasionally accompanied or followed the original duetting pair. This species uses simultaneous polyphonic duets with a pre-duet greeting ceremony. Polyphonic duets have many sounds occurring simultaneously so the song sounds \\"many- voiced\\".Short, Lester L., and Jennifer F.

It is Grisham's fourth novel.  Plot  Boyd Boyette, a United States Senator from Louisiana, goes missing. Because of his vocal opposition to a proposed major toxic landfill project by a company known to be Mafia-backed, murder is suspected. But no body can be found and Roy Foltrigg, United States Attorney in New Orleans, is desperate for a suspect. Barry \\"The Blade\\" Muldanno, a well-known thug and nephew of Johnny Sulari, head of the local Mafia, is suspected. The FBI stalk Muldanno, hoping he'll lead them to the body. Eleven-year-old Mark Sway, his younger brother Ricky, and their divorced mother Dianne live in a trailer park in Memphis. Mark and Ricky are smoking cigarettes in the woods near their home, when they encounter a man trying to commit suicide by piping exhaust fumes into his car. Trying to remove the hose, Mark is grabbed by the man and forced into the car. The man, under the influence of drugs and alcohol, reveals himself to be lawyer Jerome Clifford. Clifford tells Mark that he is about to kill himself to avoid being murdered by Muldanno, who has revealed to him the location of Boyette's body. Mark manages to escape, and Clifford then shoots himself. Ricky becomes catatonic after witnessing the suicide and is hospitalized. Authorities ‚Äî and the Mob ‚Äî suspect that Clifford may have told Mark where the body is. At the hospital, the FBI want to talk urgently to Mark. Street-smart beyond his years, he realizes that he will need a lawyer. By coincidence, he meets Regina \\"Reggie\\" Love, a lawyer specializing in child abuse cases, who agrees to represent him for a token retainer of one dollar. Reggie suspects that Mark has not told her the complete story, including the location of the body. Two Mafia operatives, Bono and Pirini, are dispatched from New Orleans to Memphis to see what Mark knows; they hire local \\"security specialists,\\" Nance and Sisson, to snoop at the hospital. Reggie represents Mark in an interview with the FBI, knowing that she does not have the full story. Roaming the hospital, Mark is cornered and threatened by Nance that he'll kill him if he talks. Foltrigg, a glory-seeking lawyer with political aspirations, known as \\"Reverend Roy\\" because of his penchant for preaching to juries, arrives at the offices of George Ord, the United States attorney in Memphis, where he is less than welcome. Foltrigg and his staff plot methods to get Mark to reveal where the body is hidden, and also plot to get Reggie into court, hoping to pierce attorney-client confidentiality, assuming that Reggie actually knows the location of the body. The FBI apply to Harry Roosevelt, a judge of the Juvenile Court, to arrange Mark's detention for his own protection. This is reluctantly approved by Roosevelt and Mark is arrested in the hospital room where Ricky is recovering. Mark and Reggie appear before the judge, but, scared out of his wits, Mark \\"takes the Fifth\\" and refuses to reveal what he knows. He is returned to detention, and after faking a medical condition, is taken to the hospital, from which he escapes, eventually taking refuge with Reggie. The Sway family trailer is burned to the ground by Bono and Pirini; the family now have no home and little else. Dianne loses her job in a minimum-wage sweatshop, but Reggie threatens the company president with a lawsuit, on condition that they keep sending her paycheck and fresh flowers to the hospital. K. O. Lewis, Deputy Director of the FBI, is drawn into the case. He proposes a deal ‚Äî if Mark reveals the location of the body, they will place the Sway family in the witness protection program. Reggie and Mark drive to Clifford's house at the same time as Muldanno's accomplices. They start to dig up the body, which is buried under concrete in Clifford's boat shed, but a melee follows and they flee. Mark and Reggie discover the body and then also flee. The deal is done and the Sway family agree to enter witness protection. A special hospital is located to take Ricky; after his recovery, they will be moved elsewhere. As soon as the family fly off in an FBI plane, Reggie reveals the location of the body to the FBI.

R. Hubbuck. \\"A Short History of H-spaces\\", History of topology, 1999, pages 747‚Äì755). or a topological unital magma, is a topological space X (generally assumed to be connected) together with a continuous map Œº : X √ó X ‚Üí X with an identity element e such that Œº(e, x) = Œº(x, e) = x for all x in X. Alternatively, the maps Œº(e, x) and Œº(x, e) are sometimes only required to be homotopic to the identity (in this case e is called homotopy identity), sometimes through basepoint preserving maps. These three definitions are in fact equivalent for H-spaces that are CW complexes. Every topological group is an H-space; however, in the general case, as compared to a topological group, H-spaces may lack associativity and inverses. Examples and properties The multiplicative structure of an H-space adds structure to its homology and cohomology groups. For example, the cohomology ring of a path-connected H-space with finitely generated and free cohomology groups is a Hopf algebra. Also, one can define the Pontryagin product on the homology groups of an H-space. The fundamental group of an H-space is abelian. To see this, let X be an H-space with identity e and let f and g be loops at e. Define a map F: [0,1]√ó[0,1] ‚Üí X by F(a,b) = f(a)g(b). Then F(a,0) = F(a,1) = f(a)e is homotopic to f, and F(0,b) = F(1,b) = eg(b) is homotopic to g. It is clear how to define a homotopy from [f][g] to [g][f]. Adams' Hopf invariant one theorem, named after Frank Adams, states that S0, S1, S3, S7 are the only spheres that are H-spaces. Each of these spaces forms an H-space by viewing it as the subset of norm-one elements of the reals, complexes, quaternions, and octonions, respectively, and using the multiplication operations from these algebras. In fact, S0, S1, and S3 are groups (Lie groups) with these multiplications. But S7 is not a group in this way because octonion multiplication is not associative, nor can it be given any other continuous multiplication for which it is a group.

Shira is the deputy director general of the Reshet television network, while Keren is a television director and screenwriter. After divorcing Eliora, Margalit married Dana, a lecturer at Ariel University.Dan Margalit on Topaz case: It's time to get rid of right to remain silent Journalism career In 1977, while serving as Washington correspondent of Haaretz, he revealed that Leah Rabin, wife of prime minister Yitzhak Rabin, had a United States bank account, illegal in Israel at the time. The story, known as the Dollar Account affair, led to Rabin's resignation and the nomination of Shimon Peres as the Alignment's candidate for prime minister. In 1992 he was appointed editor of Maariv by publisher Ofer Nimrodi, but he resigned six months later.Telepopulism: Media and politics in Israel, Yoram Peri In June 2007, Margalit began to write for Israel HaYom, a new free daily newspaper in Israel. On June 6, 2017, Margalit informed the public via his Twitter account that he had been fired from Israel Hayom.http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Culture/Israel-Hayom-fires-veteran- journalist-Dan-Margalit-495060. Television career Margalit has been one of the regular hosts of the Israeli Educational Television's current affairs show \\"Erev Hadash\\" since its early days in 1982. During the 1990s he hosted current affairs panel shows on Channel 1 and later on commercial television. Since 2004 he has hosted a current affairs panel show on Channel 10. Sexual Harassment allegations Newspaper Haaretz reported that five female co- workers accused Dan Margalit of sexual harassment made on them, individually, during the late 1980s and early 1990s. One of the women who accused Margalit, Hannah Kim, a former journalist for \\"Ha'ir\\" \\"Hadashot\\" (news) and \\"Haaretz\\" revealed her story on her social media account. Margalit in return to those allegations said: \\"There is nothing to these claims about incidents that allegedly happened more than 30 years ago. I don't intend to devote my remaining years to an argument that has no chance at this moment, given the prevailing mood\\". On October 18, 2018, Orly Azoulay told that Margalit sexually harassed her after a Popolitica talk show which he hosted. As a result, Margalit announced on the same day that he would cease journalistic work.

The channel is run by Grupo God√≥ and broadcasts from street-level studios on the Diagonal Avenue in the heart of Barcelona. History 8TV began as a local TV channel in Barcelona in 2001. In its early years, the station used the Citytv name and brand identity, similar to the Citytv system of television stations in Canada and licensed to Grupo God√≥ by then-owner of the brand, CHUM Limited. Officially limited to inner Barcelona, it slowly expanded its coverage to the suburbs of the city, as well as other important places such as Girona or Lleida. In 2003, Emissions Digitals de Catalunya (Digital Broadcasting of Catalonia), won a bid for a digital license to broadcast in all Catalonia, (DVB-T). As the God√≥ group was part of this commercial bid, Citytv could (by law) broadcast as a de facto Catalonia-wide station, but only in digital. As the first launch of Digital terrestrial television in Catalan Countries in 2003 did not succeed, most television channels decided to postpone any further plans to broadcast in digital. Consequently, Citytv continued to expand its analogue coverage in the following years. For all this, it was not until March 2005 that Citytv began broadcasting in DVB-T in March 2005 (restricted to Barcelona). With a steady relaunch of Digital terrestrial television in November 2005, the channel's owners decided to rename Citytv to 8TV and become a private Catalan broadcaster. On 27 February 2006, the channel was renamed TD8 (Televisi√≥ Digital 8 \\"Digital Television 8\\"), and began broadcasting to all Catalonia (in analogue). Initial digital coverage was limited to Barcelona, but on 4 April 2006 TD8 was also available in Tarragona, Girona and Lleida. Later that year, TD8 was once again renamed 8TV- vuit televisi√≥ (eight television).  Programming  The station broadcasts a mixture of old films, entertainment (Arucitys; Envasat al 8; X-tra; Amics, coneguts i saludats), news (Notic√≠es 8 ), sports (For√ßa Bar√ßa), cartoons (Garfield & Xou de Lupo i DuesEspatlles). Most programs are broadcast in Catalan, but foreign films and series are dubbed in Spanish. One original program on the station was Not√≠cies 10, airing at 8:25 pm.

Early life  He was born in Kwambunda, Natal on the banks of the Blood River. His father was a carpenter and preacher and his mother a counsellor and midwife. The family soon moved to Evaton, south of Johannesburg. He was educated at missionary school, Wilburforce College in Evaton. He would later obtain a Bachelor of Arts from the University of South Africa and later in exile, a Master of Arts from Indiana University. He started work as a journalist in 1967, working for the Golden City Post, feature writer for DRUM from 1969 until 1970, and as a political reporter for the Johannesburg Sunday Times in 1970. After the Soweto Riots in 1976, he joined Total Oil as a marketing executive. Political life In 1977 he was forced into exile for his anti-apartheid activities and sought asylum in the United States, where he continued his political activity. As Project Director at the American Committee on Africa (ACOA) and its sister organisation The Africa Fund from 1979 to 1997 he played a key role in the mobilisation of U.S. sanctions against apartheid, helping to build the divestment movement which led to 28 states, 24 counties and more than 90 cities and 155 colleges and universities divesting from U.S. banks and companies which did business with the South African government. He visited almost every state in the union, testifying before state legislatures and city councils and speaking in communities and at countless colleges and universities. After the end of apartheid he returned to South Africa and was appointed Director of the United States Desk in the Department of Foreign Affairs in 1997. Kumalo was subsequently appointed as South Africa's Permanent Representative to the United Nations; he presented his credentials as Permanent Representative on 21 April 1999. He spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on 13 April 2004, encouraging participation of the member nations of the United Nations, on the matter of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme. He was on the Advisory Committee of the African Activist Archive Project of the African Studies Center at Michigan State University. He returned to South Africa in 2009 and until 2013, he was CEO of the Thabo Mbeki Foundation. Death Kumalo died at his home in Midrand after an asthma attack.

This dual order Pop is defined to be the same set, but with the inverse order, i.e. x ‚â§ y holds in Pop if and only if y ‚â§ x holds in P. It is easy to see that this construction, which can be depicted by flipping the Hasse diagram for P upside down, will indeed yield a partially ordered set. In a broader sense, two partially ordered sets are also said to be duals if they are dually isomorphic, i.e. if one poset is order isomorphic to the dual of the other. The importance of this simple definition stems from the fact that every definition and theorem of order theory can readily be transferred to the dual order. Formally, this is captured by the Duality Principle for ordered sets: : If a given statement is valid for all partially ordered sets, then its dual statement, obtained by inverting the direction of all order relations and by dualizing all order theoretic definitions involved, is also valid for all partially ordered sets. If a statement or definition is equivalent to its dual then it is said to be self-dual. Note that the consideration of dual orders is so fundamental that it often occurs implicitly when writing ‚â• for the dual order of ‚â§ without giving any prior definition of this \\"new\\" symbol.  Examples  A bounded distributive lattice, and its dual Naturally, there are a great number of examples for concepts that are dual: * Greatest elements and least elements * Maximal elements and minimal elements * Least upper bounds (suprema, ‚à®) and greatest lower bounds (infima, ‚àß) * Upper sets and lower sets * Ideals and filters * Closure operators and kernel operators. Examples of notions which are self-dual include: * Being a (complete) lattice * Monotonicity of functions * Distributivity of lattices, i.e. the lattices for which ‚àÄx,y,z: x ‚àß (y ‚à® z) = (x ‚àß y) ‚à® (x ‚àß z) holds are exactly those for which the dual statement ‚àÄx,y,z: x ‚à® (y ‚àß z) = (x ‚à® y) ‚àß (x ‚à® z) holdsThe quantifiers are essential: for individual elements x, y, z, e.g. the first equation may be violated, but the second may hold; see the N5 lattice for an example. * Being a Boolean algebra * Being an order isomorphism.

The stone has been owned by a number of important figures in European history, such as Charles the Bold, James VI and I, and the Astor family. The shield-shaped stone comprises two back-to-back crowns (the typical upper half of a stone) but lacks any semblance to a pavilion (the lower portion of a stone, below the girdle or midsection). History The diamond now known as the Sancy began as an even larger diamond called the Balle de Flandres with a possible weight of over . The Balle was part of the dowry of Valentina Visconti when she married Louis I, Duke of Orl√©ans (the younger brother of King Charles VI of France) in 1398. While the precise path of ownership over the next 75 years is uncertain, the stone found its way to Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, who lost it together with an array of other treasures - including his silver bath and the Three Brothers jewel - in the Battle of Grandson in 1476. Balfour (2009) posits that this diamond is the same stone that eventually became the Sancy. After Charles died, in 1477 the diamond passed to his cousin King Manuel I of Portugal. When Portugal was threatened to come under Spanish rule, claimant Ant√≥nio, Prior of Crato fled the country with the bulk of the Portuguese Crown Jewels. He spent his life trying to get allies to regain the Portuguese throne in the French and English courts, and eventually sold the diamond to Nicolas de Harlay, seigneur de Sancy. Other sources claim that the diamond was purchased in Constantinople by de Sancy. He was popular in the French Court and was later French Ambassador to Turkey. Something of a gem connoisseur, de Sancy used his knowledge to prosperous advantage. Henry III of France suffered from premature baldness and tried to conceal this fact by wearing a cap. As diamonds were becoming increasingly fashionable at the time, Henry arranged to borrow de Sancy's diamond to decorate his cap. Henry's successor Henry IV of France also borrowed the stone, but for the more practical purpose of collateral for financing an army. An apocryphal tale from the time of de Sancy's possession of the stone tells of a messenger carrying the jewel, but never reaching his destination. Nevertheless, de Sancy (by then Superintendent of Finance) was convinced that the man had remained loyal and conducted a search until the messenger was discovered robbed and murdered. When the body was disinterred, the jewel was found in the faithful man's stomach.left Facing financial difficulties, de Sancy was forced to sell the diamond to King James VI and I in March 1605 when it is thought the Sancy acquired its name. It weighed 53 carats and cost 60,000 French crowns.HMC Salisbury Hatfield, vol. 17 (Edinburgh, 1938), pp. 91-2. It was described in the Tower of London's 1605 Inventory of Jewels as \\"...one fayre dyamonde, cut in fawcetts, bought of Sauncy.\\" James had it set into the Mirror of Great Britain, with diamonds from the Great H of Scotland.F. Palgrave ed., Kalendars of the Exchequer, vol. 2 (London 1836), p. 305. The Sancy was briefly possessed by Charles I (King of England, Scotland and Ireland) and then by his third son James II. Beleaguered after a devastating defeat, James took shelter under Louis XIV of France, a fickle host who tired of his exiled guest. Facing destitution, James had no choice but to sell the Sancy to Cardinal Mazarin in 1657 for the reported sum of ¬£25,000. The cardinal bequeathed the diamond to the king upon his death in 1661. The Sancy was thus domiciled in France but disappeared during the French Revolution when brigands raided the Garde Meuble (Royal Treasury). As well as the Sancy, other treasures stolen were the Regent diamond, and the French Blue diamond which is known today as the Hope diamond. The Sancy was in the collection of Vasiliy Rudanovsky until 1828 when purchased by Prince Demidoff for ¬£80,000. It remained in the Demidov family collection until 1865 when sold to Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy, an Indian prince, for ¬£100,000. He sold it only a year later, creating another gap in its history. It reappeared in 1867, displayed at the Paris Exposition, carrying a price tag of one million francs; the gem then vanished again for forty years. The Sancy next surfaced in 1906 when bought by William Waldorf Astor, 1st Viscount Astor, from famous Russian collector A.K.Rudanovsky. The prominent Astor family possessed it for 72 years until the 4th Viscount Astor sold it to the Louvre for $1 million in 1978. The Sancy now rests in the Apollo Gallery, together with the likes of the Regent Diamond and the Hortensia Diamond.  Further reading  *Balfour, Ian (2009). Famous Diamonds 5th ed.

Prior to his political career he served in the police until he resigned after pleading guilty to charges of misconduct. Early life Mallon was born to an undertaker and was raised as a Catholic. He left school at the age of sixteen with no qualifications. He played water polo internationally. Police career Mallon joined Cleveland Police in 1974. He was appointed detective chief inspector for Hartlepool in 1994. During his tenure in this role, crime fell in the area by 35%. He was promoted to detective superintendent in November 1996, and crime rates continued to fall. Mallon was nicknamed \\"Robocop\\" over his New York-inspired zero tolerance approach to anti-social crime. This approach was praised by Tony Blair and by home secretaries, but was criticised by police officers as \\"old-style confrontational policing\\". =Investigation and resignation= In December 1997, Mallon was one of sixty-one police officers suspended from duty amid allegations of misconduct as part of Operation Lancet. Claims against the officers included tipping off suspects and exchanging drugs for confessions. Charges against Mallon included nine of neglect of duty, three of falsehood and prevarication, one of discreditable conduct and one of misconduct towards of a member of the police force, which he described as \\"minor\\" disciplinary matters. By June 2000, the Crown Prosecution Service had found insufficient evidence to bring criminal charges against any of the officers involved. Mallon remained under internal disciplinary investigation. He offered his resignation in August 2001, but this was rejected by the chief constable so that a disciplinary hearing could take place. He pleaded guilty to all fourteen charges against him in February 2002, claiming he did nothing wrong but only pleaded guilty so he could be free to stand to be Mayor of Middlesbrough, as police officers are unable to campaign politically. The chief constable, Barry Shaw, described Mallon as \\"a liar at the centre of an empire of evil\\". After his resignation and before his election, Mallon worked as a consultant for a bathroom company.  Mayor of Middlesbrough  Mallon was elected as the first Mayor of Middlesbrough in 2002, winning more than 60% of the vote as an independent candidate. He accepted applications for roles in his nine-member cabinet from all parties, though the Labour group on the council initially maintained a boycott. He kept a council of seven Labour councillors, one Conservative and one independent. He increased the use of CCTV in the town centre and started a programme of neighbourhood wardens that brought street offences to a historic low. Many residents in Gresham, near central Middlesbrough, including ward councillor and former council leader Ken Wlaker, vocally opposed Mallon-supported 2005 plans to demolish 1,453 homes across thirty-seven streets as part of a regeneration scheme. Mallon ordered the demolition to pause in 2013 after 280 properties were demolished, saying he had made a mistake. The final demolition plan was scaled back to 561 homes. Mallon proclaimed a boycott of Channel 4 and protested to Ofcom over a description of Middlesbrough as the worst place to live in Britain as part of its programme Location, Location, Location. In 2011, owner of local taxi firm Boro Taxis Mohammed Bashir published a recording of a conversation he had with Mallon in which the mayor made an inappropriate remark about a female colleague and used slurs on local British Asian taxi drivers. The Standards Board for England found that he had brought the office into disrepute and failed to declare an interest regarding his friendship with Bashir on two occasions. The council sold Acklam Hall, the city's only Grade I-listed building, for ¬£900,000 in 2014. The sale was criticised at the time as undervalued, with independent councillor Len Junier suggesting the deal made had been \\"dodgy\\". Mallon defended the sale and referred himself to the council's Standards Committee. Mallon stood down in 2015, not contesting the mayoral election of that year. He declared that he would leave politics whilst leaving open the option of returning to politics if a local metro mayoralty were to be established.  After mayoralty  After leaving the position of Mayor of Middlesbrough, Mallon took up a role as a non-executive director for a project to redevelop the site of Manston Airport in Kent. Controversy over the sale of Acklam Hall remained, with the former council monitoring officer Karen Whitmore claiming that then-deputy mayor Dave Budd had told her about a conversation in which Mallon had admitted discussion reducing the price of the building with a property developer, which Budd later denied. Sales of assets to Mallon's former election agent Nasser Din at prices lower than other offers that the council rejected as well as independent valuations were also criticised and investigated, with the Tees Valley Audit and Assurance Services finding that there was a \\"cause for concern bordering on significant concern\\" but without any evidence of criminal activity.  Political views  Mallon has been sought for roles by both the Conservative Party and the Labour Party. He has described himself as a \\"socialist type\\" and \\"more of a Labour person\\" but not \\"anti-Conservative\\", and been identified with New Labour. He chaired a policing policy group for the Centre for Social Justice, a conservative think tank. In 2011, Mallon criticised cuts to local government as \\"a financial war on us\\" disproportionally affecting more deprived areas, while supporting deficit reduction in principle. He identified the greatest problem in Middlesbrough as premature death. In the 2004 referendum on a North East England regional assembly, Mallon was described as a \\"late comer\\" to the race by BBC Look North political correspondent Richard Moss. Mallon supported a regional assembly, however the \\"yes\\" campaign was defeated by almost 500,000 votes, and lost in every electing council area. Following his background in the police, Mallon kept focus on law and order. He has consistently expressed hostility towards beggars, including accusing them of begging as a more profitable alternative to crime. Mallon was sceptical of the introduction of directly-elected police and crime commissioners. He opposes the system of directly elected mayors for local authorities and has advocated for a mayor for the Tees Valley.

The show also is referred to by the title Pink Lady and Jeff, which refers to co-star Jeff Altman. The show was riddled with complications, including the dispute over the name: agents for the starring parties were never able to settle on one, and the show was advertised both ways during its run. Other difficulties included scriptwriting disagreements, guest star booking mishaps, taping and touring conflicts, and the fact that Mie and Kei, the members of Pink Lady, did not understand English. Pink Lady was massively popular in Japan and even enjoyed a hit in the U.S. with the English-language song \\"Kiss in the Dark\\". A television show for the duo was proposed and swiftly approved. The show's developers, Sid and Marty Krofft, were led to believe that the stars were fluent in both languages, but even when this was found to be untrue, production continued apace. Network executives insisted that Mie and Kei not only speak their parts in English by rote, but also sing every song that way as well. Their unconvincing diction compounded the show's other problems, and despite the infusion of very expensive co-stars, the series did poorly and was cancelled after five episodes. The series ranked #35 on TV Guides \\"The 50 Worst TV Shows of All Time\\" list. Synopsis The series starred Japanese female singing duo Pink Lady, composed of \\"Mie\\" (Mitsuyo Nemoto) and \\"Kei\\" (Keiko Masuda), and American comedian Jeff Altman. The format of the show consisted of musical numbers alternating with sketch comedy. A running gag of the series was the girls' lack of understanding of American culture and of English; in reality, Pink Lady spoke no English at all. On the show, Jeff attempted to translate and explain, leading to more confusion. The series featured Pink Lady performing songs, usually English-language disco and pop songs such as \\"Boogie Wonderland\\" or \\"Yesterday\\", and interaction with celebrity and musical guests. The group would end the show by jumping into a hot tub together. After the poorly rated series premiere, NBC moved Pink Lady to Friday nights and added Jim Varney as a character actor. The move and retooling failed to help ratings and the series was canceled after five episodes. Production The show was the brainchild of Fred Silverman, then president and CEO of NBC, who wanted to replicate the success he had had at ABC and CBS. After seeing a Walter Cronkite story about Pink Lady on the CBS Evening News, Silverman thought their Japanese success could be translated to the American market, so he brought in Sid and Marty Krofft to produce a variety show for them. At the time, Pink Lady recently achieved their first and only top-40 hit on the U.S. 'Billboard Hot 100, when their song \\"Kiss in the Dark\\" peaked at no. 37 in August 1979. The Krofft brothers were told that the ladies were fluent in English, which they were not. Unsure of how to stage the show, Sid Krofft developed the concept of making \\"the strangest thing that's ever been on television...The whole show was gonna come out of a little Japanese box.\\" Silverman's response was, \\"No, that's just too different. Let's just do Donny & Marie.\\" Comedian Jeff Altman had a contract with NBC,\\"Jeff Altman Interview\\", Pink Lady and Jeff DVD, Rhino Home Video, 2001. and, on that basis, was offered work hosting the show to compensate for the fact that the leads were un-versed in English. Writer Mark Evanier previously worked with Kroffts on The Krofft Superstar Hour and the pilot Bobby Vinton's Rock 'n' Rollers and was brought on board as head writer and seasoned variety show director Art Fisher (The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour) was brought in to direct. According to Evanier, Fisher disliked the show and only participated because he was contractually obligated. The language barrier proved to be the biggest obstacle. Mie and Kei had to hold English conversations through an on-set translator. The writers struggled because once dialogue had been written for and learned by the ladies, it could not be changed. This was particularly problematic when a guest star would be booked at the last minute, such as Lorne Greene, who agreed to appear on the show only four hours before the episode was taped. Mie and Kei wanted to sing the songs that had made them famous in their native country, but NBC insisted they perform in English. This resulted in recording English songs phonetically and lip-syncing for the show's tapings. Lip-syncing was already a common practice on American variety shows, but it was especially noticeable since the ladies were performing in a language that was foreign to them. Additional problems were caused when the network insisted the writers develop separate identities for Mie and Kei. The established Pink Lady act was that they were so much in unison that they performed as one entity, so the two were not comfortable having separate stage personalities. Because Mie and Kei commuted between the U.S. and Japan to appear in sold-out concerts, their time on the set was spent memorizing lines and routines, forcing the brunt of the comedy skits on Altman and ensemble players Jim Varney, Cheri Steinkellner and Anna Mathias. On rare occasions when Mie and Kei appeared in sketches, their time was minimal. Booking guests for the show was also a problem. Variety shows were fading by 1980, which was exacerbated by the fact the series' headliners were not a household name in the U.S. Larry Hagman and other A-list stars were coerced into appearing after receiving sizable monetary incentives. Alice Cooper was friends with the Kroffts and submitted an original performance both as a favor to them and to promote his upcoming album release. Other stars who had previously worked with the Kroffts were also brought in, including Florence Henderson (The Brady Bunch Hour), Donny Osmond (Donny & Marie), Red Buttons (Side Show) and Bobby Vinton (Bobby Vinton's Rock 'n' Rollers). Cheap Trick and two-time guest Blondie had no actual involvement with the show ‚Äî Cheap Trick's music video for \\"Dream Police\\" was shown as were Blondie's videos for \\"Shayla\\" and \\"Eat to the Beat,\\" both shot for a then-newly released home video. Each show ended with a tuxedo-clad Jeff getting lured, pushed or pulled into the on-set hot tub by Mie and Kei. This gag originated with Sid Krofft, who had used a similar device on The Brady Bunch Hour; in each episode, Greg would push Peter into the swimming pool. Altman felt it would have been an amusing one-time gag, but by employing it each week, it became contrived. Altman tried to convince the writing staff to do away with this segment, but he was vetoed, most probably because this segment afforded everyone the opportunity to see Mie and Kei in bikinis. The show's title has often been the source of confusion. The show onscreen was titled Pink Lady, but the series is most commonly referred to as Pink Lady and Jeff. Altman felt that since he carried the show, his name should appear in the title, and the network agreed, but Pink Lady's manager strongly protested and threatened a lawsuit if \\"and Jeff\\" appeared on the show's title. NBC's promos occasionally referred to as Pink Lady, whereas at other times the voice-over announcer referred to it as Pink Lady and Jeff. In print advertisements for TV Guide however, the show always was titled Pink Lady and Jeff, though it was cited as Pink Lady in the text TV listings. Episodes Syndication Pink Lady and Jeff reruns were seen on Trio for a brief period. Home media On June 26, 2001, Rhino Entertainment released the complete series on Region 1 DVD in the United States. In popular culture Harry Shearer appeared as Carl Sagan on Saturday Night Live's spoof \\"Pink Lady and Carl\\" with Gilda Radner and Laraine Newman playing the singing duo and Paul Shaffer as special guest star Marvin Hamlisch.

She became Francis' mistress following his return from captivity in 1526. Anne enriched her family and friends through her courtly influence and after Francis' death was banished from court and temporarily imprisoned in her husband's castle. She would spend her later years ensuring the fortune of her family. Anne died in 1580.  King's mistress  Born in 1508, Anne was the daughter of Guillaume de Pisseleu, seigneur d'Heilly, a nobleman of Picardy, and Anne Sanguin. She came to court before 1522 and was one of the maids-of-honour of Marie of Luxembourg and later Louise of Savoy, Duchess of Angoul√™me, the mother of Francis I. Francis made Anne his mistress, probably upon his return from his captivity at Madrid (1526), and soon gave up his long-term mistress, Fran√ßoise de Foix, for her. Anne was described as being sprightly, pretty, witty and cultured, \\"the most beautiful among the learned and the most learned among the beautiful\\". The liaison received some official recognition when Francis started wearing Anne's colors. Anne was appointed lady-in-waiting to the new queen, Eleanor of Austria, and later became governess to Francis' two daughters. She used her influence with Francis to elevate and enrich her family; her brother, Adrien sieur d'Heilly, was made captain of the Picard legion, her uncle, Antoine Sanguin, being made Bishop of Orl√©ans in 1533 and a cardinal in 1539; her three other brothers were made bishops. In 1534, Francis gave her in marriage to Jean IV de Brosse, whom he created Duke of √âtampes. Sketch of Anne by Fran√ßois Clouet. Court influence With the political fall of the Duke of Montmorency in 1540, Anne became all-powerful at court. Surrounded by those seeking royal favor, she dominated court functions. Foreign diplomats quickly learned they had to gain Anne's favor for their plans to have any chance in succeeding. In doing so, she usurped the Queen's position at court. Anne later illustrated her political influence by having Admiral Chabot released and returned to court, marrying her sister Louise to Chabot's nephew in the process. Despite her capabilities, Anne was of a fickle nature. In 1545, she tried to discredit Admiral d'Annebault, despite him owing his advancement to her. When her intrigues were discouraged by archbishop Tournon, Anne attempted to bring about his fall on a charge of dishonesty. The influence of Anne, especially in the last years of Francis' reign, continued to grow. A staunch Protestant, she counseled Francis on toleration for Huguenots. By October 1546, Anne, along with Cardinal du Bellay, was pressuring Francis to break with Rome. Due to her influence Francis was attending more council meetings, and according to an imperial envoy, Anne was \\"the real president of the king's most private and intimate council\\". Basking in her success at bringing peace between Francis and Charles at Crepy in 1544, Anne convinced Francis that his son the Dauphin Henry and Diane de Poitiers were working to reinstate Montmorency at court. Francis, so instructed, banished Diane from court. In response, Henry and his supporters retreated to the chateau of Anet; father and son would not reconcile until 1545. Loss of position Despite having influence at Francis' court, Anne had made many enemies: Henry, his mistress, Diane de Poitiers, and Anne de Montmorency were among them. Following Francis' death in March 1547, Henry, now king, had Anne dismissed from the court and confiscated her possessions. By 1548, Anne was facing the threat of trial for heresy. Henry chose not to pursue this possibly out of respect for his father. Her husband accused her of theft of his governorship salary and disgracing his family, and had Anne confined temporarily to the castle of La Hardoinaye. Anne was still a wealthy woman, having properties in Paris and a capital of 47,615 livres in rentes. By 1554-55 she was maintaining her niece Jossine de Pisseleu's rights to the Lenoncourt succession from the Guise family. In March 1560, she gifted 114,000 livres for her niece Diane de Barbancon and her husband Jean de Rohan, baron de Frontenay, wedding. Anne gave 30,000 livres for her nephew Jean d'Heilly's first marriage, and acted as the intermediary for Jean's second marriage, writing to the lady's ward. She continued to be involved in the lives of her nieces and nephews into her later years. Anne died in 1580.

The assessments, based on a job and task analysis process, incorporate input from subject-matter experts (SMEs) representing regions of the United States in secondary and post-secondary education as well as business and industry. The assessments are updated on a regular basis and are aligned with O*NET, national academic standards (math, science, and language arts) as well as business and industry standards. When appropriate, customized assessments may be developed to meet the educational needs of a specific region or a state. A number of the assessments are linked to industry certifications programs. History NOCTI originated in 1966 funded by a grant from the US Commissioner of Education to Rutgers University in Newark, New Jersey. Due to the lack of vocational technical (currently referred to as career and technical) educators, a consortium of states was identified to develop assessments that would validate knowledge and skill sets of individuals coming from the workforce working toward a degree in career and technical education. NOCTI developed both written/multiple choice and performance/practical tests to assess teacher candidates. These assessments were given in a paper/pencil format at testing sites across the nation and scored at the NOCTI headquarters. 1972 NOCTI is established as a permanent organization, including a constitution, by-laws, and operating policies. 1973 NOCTI is established as a not-for-profit corporation at Educational Testing Services (ETS) in Princeton, New Jersey. 1975 NOCTI becomes independent from ETS and moves to new headquarters in Albany, New York. 1979 NOCTI expands its original mission of teacher candidate testing to secondary and post secondary student testing also known as SOCAT (student occupational competency assessment testing) 1983 NOCTI relocates to Ferris State University in Big Rapids, Michigan. 1985 NOCTI - Industrial assessments added to NOCTI's battery of assessments. 1995 NOCTI moves to its current address at 500 N.

Like many of the Puyo Puyo games, it was never officially released outside Japan. The title of Puyo Puyo~n comes from the Japanese word , signifying the fourth game in the series. Plans were made for a 64DD version entitled , but it was later cancelled for the N64 release. Gameplay The gameplay of ~n remains similar to Puyo Puyo 2, with a new addition of character specials. As puyos are erased from the field, a power gauge fills up, and as it fills to the top, you can use a special. Each characters special ability differs from person to person, and these specials are very different between the domestic versions and the Game Boy Color version. Each grid in the domestic versions follows Special Rule, where a preset field and special board rules are implemented. In the Game Boy Color version, whenever garbage was countered, Sun puyos would fall on the screens. The game also featured several Tokoton modes involving grids larger or smaller than 6x12 in the domestic versions, and featured a Free Battle mode allowing PvP against any unlocked characters. The art is also vastly different from its predecessors, adopting a more serious tone compared to the other games. There were subtle differences between the domestic versions of ~n, but a vast difference between the domestic versions and the Game Boy Color version. Puyo Puyo~n: Kaa-kun to Issho (lit. \\"Puyo Puyo~n: Together with Carby\\") for the PlayStation has the same music as the Dreamcast version of Puyo Puyo~n, but only supports up to two players. Puyo Puyo~n Party 64 for the Nintendo 64 has different music from the Dreamcast version and lacks the voiced cutscenes, but retained four player multiplayer and included a Transfer Pak mode where one could unlock more artwork by plugging in Pocket Puyo Puyo SUN. Pocket Puyo Puyo~n for the Game Boy Color uses music from Pocket Puyo Puyo Sun as well as music from Puyo~n itself, features more characters and more specials, including some of the cast from Pocket Puyo Puyo Sun, and Minotauros instead of Zou Daimaou, but naturally only supported two players and has the same storyline, retaining the comic humour of the previous versions. Pocket Puyo Puyo~n also has a special Rally mode to unlock the specials, and one can choose which special you wanted to use before the game started. This version does not have Special Rule or any board-specific functions like the domestic versions had, nor did it have any of the different grid sizes for Tokoton Puyo Puyo, but it does feature the ability to play Endless similarly to Puyo Puyo 2's Action Endless (where garbage appears in the tray, and helpers appear at random times depending on the difficulty setting). The stance that Puyo Puyo~n has taken into the series may have been used as a base for Puyo Puyo 7. Plot Unlike the previous games where the storyline is rather comical, ~n has a serious storyline, reminiscent of those in the Madou Monogatari games. The Dark Prince is found looking at some books in a magical library when he comes across a black box. He begins to examine the black box before it breaks free from his hands and opens. The next morning a Puyo Circus has arrived, and Arle alongside Carbuncle go to check it out. They are greeted by a mysterious figure in Pierrot, a jester-looking character. When Arle arrives, something does not appear right, and Carbuncle disappears once more. Arle has to navigate her way past a number of foes as before. During her quest Draco, Seriri, Witch and Chico join up with Arle as they face Schezo and Rulue. Rulue knew something was up with the Dark Prince, and as Arle met him, he appeared strange and unlike his normal self. He freezes the other characters so that they do not interfere. Arle beats the Dark Prince, who wakes up and asks why Arle was there. The Dark Prince explains to Arle that he was brainwashed by a stronger foe, and Pierrot appears afterwards, revealing herself to be Doppelganger Arle. The two have a fight to see who exists in the world, and Arle was victorious. After the fight, Doppelganger Arle insists that she is \\"The Real Arle\\" who existed in the world, feeling weakened by her defeat, she soon fades away, much to Arle's shock. Seconds later, Carbuncle reappeared in the room and Arle was thrilled to see him again. The gem on Carbuncle's forehead shines and Arle asks what was wrong, he discharges the beam from his forehead and the screen fades to white then black, and the credits roll.

The force area covers making it the fourth largest police area in England and Wales. The resident population of the area is 1.19 million Its name comes from the ancient kingdom of Mercia. The force represents a diverse range of policing environments from densely populated urban conurbations on the edge of Birmingham as well as Telford, Shrewsbury, and Worcester, to sparsely populated rural areas. As of September 2017, the force has a workforce of 2,017 police officers, 223 police community support officers, 1541 police staff and 388 members of the special constabulary. The force has its headquarters in the historical manor house and grounds of Hindlip Hall on the outskirts of Worcester. Its badge combines the heraldry of Worcestershire, Herefordshire and Shropshire. The force was formed on 1 October 1967, by the merger of the Worcestershire Constabulary, Herefordshire Constabulary, Shropshire Constabulary and Worcester City Police. It lost territory to West Midlands Police when that was constituted on 1 April 1974. It changed its name from \\"West Mercia Constabulary\\" to \\"West Mercia Police\\" on 5 May 2009.

The force is organised into five Local Policing Units (LPAs) which are alphabetically coded geographically from south to north (C D E F & G). Operating across three counties, West Mercia Police maintains many stations, with each LPA having an HQ Police station. The LPAs are further divided into Safer Neighbourhood Teams (SNTs); there are 82 SNTs across the force.

Each detachment is headquartered in the respective TPU HQ, except the South Worcestershire detachment, which is based at Tudor Grange Academy. In 2010, the Telford Cadets Detachment was awarded The Queen's Award for Voluntary Service. According to West Mercia Police's website, \\"The scheme is aimed at young people who wish to engage in a program that offers them an opportunity to gain a practical understanding of policing, develop their spirit of adventure and good citizenship, while supporting their local policing priorities through volunteering, working with partner agencies and positive participation in their communities.\\" A new intake of approximately 15 new cadets per detachment occurs annually. New recruits must be aged 16 or over and have finished secondary education. Young people can remain as cadets for up to two years. Cadets can then consider joining the force at age 18, becoming a cadet leader in their detachment, or leaving the scheme altogether. Each detachment is led by several cadet leaders who are police officers, PCSOs and police volunteers from the force. Merger plans In November 2005, the government announced major reforms of policing in England and Wales, including the possibility of mergers. Under final proposals made by the Home Secretary on 6 February 2006, it would merge with Staffordshire Police, Warwickshire Constabulary and West Midlands Police to form a single strategic force for the West Midlands region. The proposals were unpopular with many of the local authorities in the West Mercia area, but was criticised especially strongly by West Mercia Constabulary inself, especially as at the time it was rated the best force in the country. When John Reid became Home Secretary in 2006, he put all merger plans on hold. Subsequent governments have not made any indication of re- introducing such plans. Alliances West Mercia was a partner, alongside two other forces, in the Central Motorway Police Group. On 8 April 2018 West Mercia withdrew from the CPMG, with the 25 West Mercia police officers attached to the group returning to the in-force roads policing service. In 2013, West Mercia Police and Warwickshire Police formed an alliance, sharing certain administrative functions in order to save both forces money. In October 2018 West Mercia announced its intention to withdraw from the alliance. This announcement came as a shock to staff in both forces.

She is one of seven women, in addition to the Blessed Virgin, commemorated by name in the Canon of the Mass in the Roman Catholic Church. She is regarded as the patron saint of musicians. It is written that as the musicians played at her wedding she \\"sang in her heart to the Lord\\".Lovewell, Bertha Ellen. The Life of St. Cecilia, Yale Studies in English, Lamson, Wolffe, and Company, Boston, 1898 Her feast day is on November 22. An early church, Santa Cecilia in Trastevere, was founded in the 3rd century by Pope Urban I in the Trastevere section of Rome, reputedly on the site of the house in which she lived. A number of musical compositions are dedicated to her, and her feast day has become the occasion for concerts and musical festivals. Life Botticini It is popularly supposed that Cecilia was a noble lady of Rome who, with her husband Valerian, his brother Tiburtius, and a Roman soldier named Maximus, suffered martyrdom in about 230, under the Emperor Alexander Severus.Fuller, Osgood Eaton: Brave Men and Women. BiblioBazaar, LLC, 2008, p. 272. . Giovanni Battista de Rossi, however, argues that instead she perished in Sicily under the Emperor Marcus Aurelius between 176 and 180, citing the report of Venantius Fortunatus, Bishop of Poitiers (d. 600).Rom. sott. ii. 147. According to the story, despite her vow of virginity, she was forced by her parents to marry a pagan nobleman named Valerian. During the wedding, Cecilia sat apart singing to God in her heart, and for that she was later declared the saint of musicians. When the time came for her marriage to be consummated, Cecilia told Valerian that watching over her was an angel of the Lord, who would punish him if he sexually violated her but would love him if he respected her virginity. When Valerian asked to see the angel, Cecilia replied that he could if he would go to the third milestone on the Via Appia and be baptized by Pope Urban I. After following Cecilia's advice, he saw the angel standing beside her, crowning her with a chaplet of roses and lilies. The Ecstasy of St. Cecilia by Raphael The martyrdom of Cecilia is said to have followed that of her husband Valerian and his brother at the hands of the prefect Turcius Almachius.The Life of Saint Cecilia ‚Äì Golden Legend article The legend about Cecilia's death says that after being struck three times on the neck with a sword, she lived for three days, and asked the pope to convert her home into a church.Foley, Leonard, O.F.M., revised by Pat McCloskey. \\"Saint of the Day: Saint Cecilia\\". Franciscan Media]. . Cecilia was buried in the Catacomb of Callixtus, and later transferred to the Church of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere. In 1599, her body was found still incorrupt, seeming to be asleep. Cecilia is one of the most famous of the Roman martyrs, although some elements of the stories recounted about her do not appear in the source material. According to Johann Peter Kirsch, the existence of the martyr is a historical fact, while some details bear the mark of a pious romance, like many other similar accounts compiled in the fifth and sixth century. The relation between Cecilia and Valerian, Tiburtius, and Maximus, mentioned in the Acts of the Martyrs, has some historical foundation. Her feast day has been celebrated since about the fourth century.Kirsch, Johann Peter. \\"St. Cecilia\\", The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 24 April 2013. There is no mention of Cecilia in the Depositio Martyrum, but there is a record of an early Roman church founded by a lady of this name, Santa Cecilia in Trastevere.  Santa Cecilia in Trastevere  The church of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere is reputedly built on the site of the house in which she lived. The original church was constructed in the fourth century; during the ninth century, Pope Paschal I had remains which were supposedly hers buried there. In 1599, while leading a renovation of the church, Cardinal Paolo Emilio Sfondrati had the remains, which he reported to be incorrupt, excavated and reburied. Meaning of the name 'Cecilia' The name \\"Cecilia\\" applied generally to Roman women who belonged to the plebeian clan of the Caecilii. Legends and hagiographies, mistaking it for a personal name, suggest fanciful etymologies. Among those cited by Chaucer in \\"The Second Nun's Tale\\" are: lily of heaven, the way for the blind, contemplation of heaven and the active life, as if lacking in blindness, and a heaven for people to gaze upon.Chaucer, Canterbury Tales, The Second Nun's Tale, prologue, 85‚Äì119. As the rubric to these lines declare, the nun draws her etymologies from the Legenda Aurea of Jacobus de Voragine (Jacobus Januensis - James of Genoa - in the rubric). Patroness of musicians Orazio Gentileschi and Giovanni Lanfranco, Saint Cecilia and an Angel, c. 1617-1618 and c. 1621-1627, National Gallery of Art The first record of a music festival in her honor was held at √âvreux in Normandy in 1570. The Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia in Rome is one of the oldest musical institutions in the world. It was founded by the papal bull, Ratione congruit, issued by Sixtus V in 1585, which invoked two saints prominent in Western musical history: Gregory the Great, after whom Gregorian chant is named, and Saint Cecilia, the patron saint of music. Her feast day became an occasion for musical concerts and festivals that occasioned well-known poems by John Dryden and Alexander PopeOde on St. Cecilia's Day (composed 1711) at, for example, www.PoemHunter.com and music by Henry Purcell (Ode to St. Cecilia); several oratorios by Marc-Antoine Charpentier (In honorem Caeciliae, Valeriani et Tiburtij canticum; and several versions of Caecilia virgo et martyr to libretti probably written by Philippe Goibaut); George Frideric Handel (Ode for St. Cecilia's Day; Alexander's Feast); Charles Gounod (St. Cecilia Mass); as well as Benjamin Britten, who was born on her feast day (Hymn to St Cecilia, based on a poem by W. H. Auden). Herbert Howells' A Hymn to Saint Cecilia has words by Ursula Vaughan Williams; Gerald Finzi's \\"For Saint Cecilia\\", Op. 30, was set to verses written by Edmund Blunden; Michael Hurd's 1966 composition \\"A Hymn to Saint Cecilia\\"Published by Novello & Co., HL.14013968 sets John Dryden's poem; and Frederik Magle's Cantata to Saint Cecilia is based on the history of Cecilia. The Heavenly Life, a poem from Des Knaben Wunderhorn (which Gustav Mahler used in his Symphony No. 4) mentions that \\"Cecilia and all her relations make excellent court musicians.\\" From the name of Cecilia comes Cecyliada, the name of festival of sacred, choral and contemporary music, held from 1994 in Police, Poland. Legacy The Martyrdom of St Cecilia by Carlo Saraceni (c. 1610) Cecilia symbolizes the central role of music in the liturgy. The Sisters of Saint Cecilia, religious sisters, shear the lambs' wool used to make the palliums of new metropolitan archbishops. The lambs are raised by the Cistercian Trappist Fathers of the Tre Fontane (Three Fountains) Abbey in Rome. The lambs are blessed by the Pope every January 21, the Feast of the martyr Saint Agnes. The pallia are given by the Pope to the new metropolitan archbishops on the Solemnity of Saints Peter and Paul, June 29. Located on the Isle of Wight, St. Cecilia's Abbey, Ryde was founded in 1882. The nuns live a traditional monastic life of prayer and work, and study in accordance with the ancient Rule of St. Benedict. The famous luthier Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume produces a line of violin and viola under the name St. C√©cile with a decal stamped on the upper back. Iconography Cecilia is frequently depicted playing a viola, a small organ, or other musical instrument, evidently to express what was often attributed to her, namely that while the musicians played at her nuptials, she sang in her heart to God, though the organ may be attributed to her erroneously, as the result of a mistranslation. A miniature Saint Cecilia beneath Worcester Cathedral was featured on the reverse side of the Sir Edward Elgar ¬£20 banknote, which was withdrawn by the Bank of England in 2010.

Aboriginal sovereignty is not recognised in the Australian Constitution or Australian law, and calls have been made for constitutional amendments both recognise First Nations sovereignty of the land and to provide an Indigenous voice to parliament. The recognition of prior occupation and ownership of Australia means accepting sovereignty by the First Peoples, and also paves the way for a treaty between the First Peoples and the Government of Australia. Background It is now well documented that Aboriginal peoples occupied mainland Australia since at least 65,000 years ago, whereas colonisation of Australia by the British only began in 1788 with the arrival of Governor Phillip and the First Fleet. No treaty was signed with the Aboriginal peoples of Port Jackson at the time, and sovereignty of the land has never been ceded by any First Nations people since. Notably, the Letters Patent establishing the Province of South Australia of 1836 (unlike the South Australia Act 1834, which it amended), included recognition of the rights of the Aboriginal peoples of South Australia.Draft of the Order-in-Council Establishing Government 23 February 1836 (UK), National Archives of Australia A treaty between the Australian government and the country's First Peoples could provide at least symbolic recognition of prior occupation of the land, and thus Indigenous sovereignty. Various treaty processes have begun in the states and territories of Australia. After the colonisation of Australia, the British afforded very little recognition of Aboriginal customs and laws in the various Australian colonies. In 1840, all Governors in Australia and New Zealand were directed that all Aboriginal customary law was to be superseded by British law. 20th century activism In 1972, the Aboriginal Tent Embassy was established on the steps of Old Parliament House in Canberra, the Australian capital, to demand sovereignty for the Aboriginal Australian peoples. Demands of the Tent Embassy have included land rights and mineral rights to Aboriginal lands, legal and political control of the Northern Territory, and compensation for land stolen. In 1988, the Australian Bicentenary, the \\"Aboriginal Sovereign Treaty '88 Campaign\\" called for recognition of Aboriginal sovereignty and for a treaty to be enacted between the Commonwealth of Australia and Aboriginal nations. 21st century debate The Aboriginal Tent Embassy, still in place , remains a symbol of Aboriginal protest relating to various Indigenous issues. Protests have been held there against Aboriginal deaths in custody, the Howard government‚Äôs 2007 Northern Territory Intervention, and cuts to services. In 2020, its most prominent issues are Aboriginal sovereignty and an acknowledgement of Indigenous right to self- determination. In 2012, there were seven tent embassies dotted around the nation. In February 2012, barrister and 2009 Australian of the Year, Mick Dodson , addressed Parliament on the subject of \\"Constitutional Recognition of Indigenous Australians\\". He raised three issues: an acknowledgement in the Constitution that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples were in Australia first and also in possession of the country, when the British Crown asserted its sovereignty over the whole continent, and it follows that the land was taken without consent; the second was about issues of Aboriginal identity being respected and protected within the Constitution and Australian law; and the third element related to equal citizenship under law. Related issues =Treaties and constitutional recognition= A treaty is a legal document defining the relationship between two sovereign entities. there are no treaties between the Australian Government and Indigenous peoples of Australia; Australia is the only Commonwealth country to lack a treaty between its government and its First Peoples. There are ongoing negotiations in some states and territories of Australia on the possible crafting of treaties between Indigenous peoples and governments. There have also been moves towards Constitutional changes both to recognise prior occupation and ownership (and thus sovereignty), and an Indigenous voice to parliament enshrined in the Constitution. =Symbolic recognition of land ownership= Many public events in Australia, including ceremonies, speeches, conferences and festivals, begin with a Welcome to Country or Acknowledgement of Country, intended to highlight the cultural significance of the surrounding area to a particular Aboriginal clan or language group. They are often made by elders of the nation on whose traditional lands each event is taking place. Since 2008, a Welcome to Country has been incorporated into the ceremonial opening of the Parliament of Australia, an event which occurs after each federal election.

Clarke, published in 1956. This novel is a complete rewrite of his earlier Against the Fall of Night, Clarke's first novel, which had been published in Startling Stories magazine in 1948 after John W. Campbell, Jr., editor of Astounding Science-Fiction, had rejected it, according to Clarke. Several years later, Clarke revised his novel extensively and renamed it The City and the Stars. The new version was intended to showcase what he had learned about writing, and about information processing. The major differences are in individual scenes and in the details of his contrasting civilizations of Diaspar and Lys. Against the Fall of Night remained popular enough to stay in print after The City and the Stars had been published. In introductions to it Clarke has told the anecdote of a psychiatrist and patient who admitted that they had discussed it one day in therapy, without realizing at the time that one had read one novel and one the other. Synopsis =Setting= The City and the Stars takes place one billion years in the future, in the city of Diaspar. By this time, the Earth is so old that the oceans have gone and humanity has all but left. As far as the people of Diaspar know, theirs is the only city left on the planet. The city of Diaspar is completely enclosed. Nobody has come in or left the city for as long as anybody can remember, and everybody in Diaspar has an instinctive insular conservatism. The story behind this fear of venturing outside the city tells of a race of ruthless invaders which beat humanity back from the stars to Earth, and then made a deal that humanity could live‚Äîif they never left the planet. In Diaspar, the entire city is run by the Central Computer. Not only is the city repaired by machines, but the people themselves are created by the machines as well. The computer creates bodies for the people of Diaspar to live in and stores their minds in its memory at the end of their lives. At any time, only a small number of these people are actually living in Diaspar; the rest are retained in the computer's memory banks. All the currently existent people of Diaspar have had past \\"lives\\" within Diaspar except one person‚ÄîAlvin, the main character of this story. He is one of only a very small number of \\"Uniques\\", different from everybody else in Diaspar, not only because he does not have any past lives to remember, but because instead of fearing the outside, he feels compelled to leave. Alvin has just come to the age where he is considered grown up, and is putting all his energies into trying to find a way out. Eventually, a character called Khedron the Jester helps Alvin use the central computer to find a way out of the city of Diaspar. This involves the discovery that in the remote past, Diaspar was linked to other cities by an underground transport system. This system still exists although its terminal was covered over and sealed with only a secret entrance left. =Alvin's quest= Once out of Diaspar, Alvin finds that one other human habitation remains on Earth. In contrast to technological Diaspar, Lys is a vast green oasis shielded by mountains from the worldwide desert. Its people are not stored and recreated technologically, but naturally conceive, are born, age, and die. They have rejected the hyper-advanced technology of Diaspar in favor of an almost agrarian existence, with machines used only for labor-saving purposes. The people of Lys have instead worked to perfect the arts of the mind; they are telepaths, capable of communicating with each other over great distances and without words. Alvin continues his quest until he finds out the truth of why the people of Diaspar are so frightened of the external universe and why Lys is so scared of space travel and mechanical things. In Lys he goes on a trip with a young man named Hilvar who becomes his friend, and they see a signal light, which they decide to investigate. It leads them to Shalmirane, the remains of the fortress where the Invaders were fought off with unimaginable weapons, and there they encounter an extraterrestrial creature with a strange robot. The creature is the last survivor of a religious cult dating back to the days of the Galactic Empire. The robot was the companion of the founder, the \\"Master\\", who came with his followers to Earth at the end of his life. Alvin and Hilvar are unable to understand the content of the religion except that it refers to \\"Great Ones\\" who have left, but will someday return. Alvin persuades the creature to lend him the robot, arguing that the Master would want it to see how things were developing in the world. The Master had, however, forbidden the robot to give out any information at all, so Alvin does not learn anything. Alvin instructs the robot to ignore his entreaties to take him back to Lys which he knew the people of Lys would induce in him with their great telepathic powers‚Äîthe previous 14 Uniques had stayed. Alvin had originally been told he would be free to choose whether to stay or return, but because the people of Lys had their own insular failure, just like Diaspar, this option was no longer available. Back in Diaspar, he seeks the help of the Central Computer, which overcomes the Master's block on the robot by producing an illusion of an apocalyptic return of the Great Ones. (This differs from the solution used in the original novel: create a duplicate of the robot WITHOUT the block.) =Discoveries= Alvin now learns that the Master's ship is still functional, buried outside Diaspar. He manages to retrieve it, fetches Hilvar from Lys, and travels into deep space. They encounter Vanamonde, a being of pure intellect, with whom Hilvar, being telepathic like other Lys people, can communicate and bring him back to Earth. From him the truth of history finally emerges. The fearsome Invaders, it turns out, were a myth: Shalmirane was actually used to destroy the Moon when this became necessary to prevent it from colliding with the Earth. Instead, the people of Diaspar and Lys are the descendants of those humans who deliberately turned away from the universe in rejection of history's greatest scientific project: the creation of a disembodied intellect. The first attempt had created a powerful but insane being, the Mad Mind. The Mad Mind had devastated the galaxy and its civilizations before being imprisoned in a \\"strange artificial star\\" called the Black Sun. Vanamonde is the second, successful experiment of the ancient empire: a being of pure intellect, immensely old, immensely powerful, able to move instantly to any point in space‚Äîbut entirely childlike and unsophisticated. Vanamonde's ultimate destiny, Hilvar realizes, is to battle the Mad Mind, when it escapes its prison at the end of Time. After this, most of the Galactic Empire had left our galaxy, leaving only a scattered few. This departure from the galaxy, leaving it to Vanamonde, was because contact had been made with a \\"very strange and very great\\" intelligent, extraterrestrial species, which called them urgently to the other side of the universe. Alvin's discoveries reunite Diaspar with Lys. He then sends the ship, under the command of the robot, to search for the long-lost people of the Empire. He does not wish to search himself‚Äîeven if there are human remnants in the Galaxy, they are probably decadent‚Äîand he has work to do on Earth. Even the environment, he hopes, can be revived.

It is the region's largest city with a population of 276,110 inhabitants (2017).Peruvian Census On the Altiplano, Juliaca is above sea level, is located on the Collao Plateau and is northwest of Lake Titicaca (45 km). It is the largest trade center in the Puno region. Juliaca is near Lake Chacas, the Maravillas river, and near the ruins of Sillustani. The city hosts Juliaca's Carnival each year between February and March. During this very popular event participants, dressed in colorful costumes, gather on the streets to dance in the style of the Collao Plateau. Saint Sebastian's feast is celebrated on 20 January of every year. Juliaca's citizens rely on cars, trains, and bicycles. It is a major transit point in the region and has strong ties with Peru's southern cities, including Arequipa, Puno, Tacna, Cuzco, Ilo, and with La Rinconada and Bolivia. Like Chicago, Illinois, it is nicknamed \\"The Windy City\\", because of the city's location on the windy Collao Plateau. It is also called the \\"Sock City\\" or \\"Knitting City\\" because Juliaca was a major center of sock, sweater, and handicraft production. Now the production of clothes, wool and fabrics are industrial processes. 260px It is also home to Inca Manco Capac Airport, the region's main airport. Etymology The historian Ramon Rios argues that Juliaca comes from the Quechua words Xullaskca kaipi (it had drizzled) in allusion that when the Inca troops arrived at this part of the Altiplano chasing the collas, they noticed that in the Huaynarroque hill it had drizzled. However, Justo Ruelas affirms that Juliaca comes from the Quechua word Shulla Qaqa (roquedal dew), due to the fact that in the vicinity of the Huaynarroque and Santa Cruz hills, small quartz particles can be seen, which resembles the morning dew that falls on rocks. History =Pre-Spanish arrival= The Altiplano was inhabited from around 4,000 BC by sedentary communities dedicated to agriculture and livestock (llamas and guinea pigs). The Uros settled in the river towns, taking advantage of the benefits of the totora and the fish of Lake Titicaca, settled in the surrounding lakes: Chacas, Qoriwata, Cochapampa, and the Juliaca River, today Coata River. The constitution of these settlers were registered as Uros de Coata and Uros de Desaguadero, from where the Uros of Coata would be better communicated and related to Juliaca, by the river that linked them, also these riverine settlers developed a sailing technique, on rafts made of totora, fastened with yarned ropes based on the ichus, which would serve as support for fishing, and at times, of transport from Lake Titicaca to the smaller lakes that were between the territories of Juliaca. Between the years 1000 to 500 BC, Juliaca flourished under the influence of Qaluyo (ancient settlement), in the place of Qomer Moqo (Taparachi). Archaeologists discovered a small village dating back to this time, whose settlers were fed with potatoes, quinoa, ka√±iwa, carachi, guinea pig, among others. They were the first builders of waruwarus and developed a special textile industry. In the years 200 BC to 200 AD, the domain of the Pukara culture expanded in this region of the highlands. Between the third and fourth centuries, the Huaynarroque tribe flourished. Subsequently, the hegemony of Tiahuanaco, Colla and Inka arises consecutively. The kollas and Inka were ruthless rivals and only under the military command of Pachac√∫tec and his son Mayta Capac were able to subdue the brave Sapana, Chuchic√°pac and Huaynarroque tribes after bloody wars of conquest. Economy Juliaca is a large trade center for goods and services, and is considered the financial capital of the Puno region. Trade is its principal economic activity, comprising 26.5% of the Labor force. In 2008, Juliaca had 15,439 commercial establishments,Peruvian government figures which amounts to 41% of trade done in the Puno region. It is the commercial hub for the La Rinconada high-altitude city of informal gold mining.William Finnegan, \\"Tears of the Sun: The Gold Rush at the Top of the World.\\" The New Yorker, 20 April 2015: 55‚Äì65 The city of Juliaca has become a center of capital investment. As a result, poverty has been reduced, and increased per capita income has come to some of its residents. Climate Juliaca has a subtropical highland climate (K√∂ppen Cwb/Cwc) bordering on an alpine tundra climate (ET) with cool to cold temperatures most of the year. The average annual precipitation is 610 mm. Winters are dry with very cold nights and mornings, and warm afternoons.  Monuments and places of interest  The city of Juliaca and its surroundings have various natural and historical tourist attractions, among the most outstanding are: The Santa Catalina church, Waynaruqi hill, Chacas lagoon and the Kokan community. Santa Catalina Church = Santa Catalina Church = Located in the Plaza de Armas, it has an indigenous baroque architectural style. The start of its construction dates back to 1649, started by the Jesuits; however it was not completed until 125 years later. Proof of this is its only bell tower, built entirely with ashlar brought from the quarries of Arequipa. It is currently under the command of the Franciscan Order. Merced Church = La Merced Church = This church is a beautiful work of architecture from the time of the republic. It is located in the west wing of the Plaza Bolognesi in the city center. Carved out of red limestone (due to its characteristic color) and with a structure typical of the modern era (iron frame). Like the main Church of Santa Catalina, it only has a bell tower arranged symmetrically unlike the previous one, and it also features a clock with four circular faces. Its construction is due to a group of faithful devotees who commissioned the construction from Don Gregorio Layme. It was inaugurated in 1959 and renovated in 1995, where they included indigenous elements. Franciscan Convent = Franciscan Convent = Also called Convent of Santa B√°rbara . It is a four-level building built on the hill Hatun Rumi or Santa B√°rbara (Spanish name), 40 m from the Plaza de Armas de Juliaca, it presents a style essentially Romanesque Due to its importance during the republican era, today it constitutes one of the main tourist attractions of the city. White Christ = Waynaruqi hill = Located in a southeast of the Plaza de Armas, on the top of the hill Waynaruqi. The White Christ, made entirely in concrete and fiberglass, stands out on the horizon of Juliaca. At the foot of the monument is a viewpoint, from which it is possible to see the urban and non-urban areas that comprise the city. The complex was built in just two and a half weeks, and was opened in 1987. Las Calceteras Gallery = Las Calceteras Gallery = It is a three-floor building, located in the north wing of the Plaza Bolognesi. It is a shopping center for handicrafts, where all kinds of clothing are sold (socks, chullos, bootees, shawls, sweaters, rugs, gloves, etc.) woven or manufactured with native materials (llama, alpaca, vicu√±a ), the visitor can also visualize the handwork done by the artisan ladies with their typical clothing (called hosiery), in different types of wool and fiber, highly appreciated in the international market. Chacas Lagoon = Chacas Lagoon = Located 10 km northwest of the city of Juliaca, in the area corresponding to the towns of Kokan and Chacas. It is a lagoon surrounded by vast hills, like the Iquinito (which is the highest in the area), the lagoon has a fusiform shape and an area of approximately 6.2 km 2 . In this abundant lagoon the local flora and fauna, mainly during the summer (rainy season).

The main strait flows under the Mackinac Bridge and connects two of the Great Lakes, Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. The main strait is wide and has a maximum depth of . Hydrologically, the two connected lakes can be considered one lake, which is called Lake Michigan‚ÄìHuron. Historically, the native Odawa people called the region around the Straits Michilimackinac. The Straits of Mackinac are \\"whipsawed by currents unlike anywhere else in the Great Lakes\\". Islands forming the edge of Straits of Mackinac include the two populated islands, Bois Blanc and Mackinac, and one that is uninhabited: Round island. The Straits of Mackinac are major shipping lanes, providing passage for raw materials and finished goods and connecting, for instance, the iron mines of Minnesota to the steel mills of Gary, Indiana. Before the railroads reached Chicago from the east, most immigrants arrived in the Midwest and Great Plains by ships on the Great Lakes. The straits are five miles (8 km) wide at their narrowest point, where they are spanned by the Mackinac Bridge. Before the bridge was built, car ferries transported vehicles across the straits. Today passenger-only ferries carry people to Mackinac Island, which does not permit cars. Visitors can take their vehicles on a car ferry to Bois Blanc Island. Satellite photograph of icebreaker paths through the ice in the straits. The Mackinac Bridge is the vertical line in the center, connecting the landmass of the Upper Peninsula above to lower Michigan below. The icebreaker paths run right-to-left, connecting the open water of Lake Michigan with the open water of Lake Huron between Mackinac Island and Round Island. The Straits of Mackinac, spanned by the Mackinac Bridge, seen from the southern shore The straits are shallow and narrow enough to freeze over in the winter. Navigation is ensured for year- round shipping to the Lower Great Lakes by the use of icebreakers. The straits were an important Native American and fur trade route. The Straits of Mackinac are named after Mackinac Island. The local Ojibwe Native Americans in the Straits of Mackinac region likened the shape of the island to that of a turtle, so they named the island Mitchimakinak, meaning \\"Big Turtle\\". When the British explored the area, they shortened the name to its present form: Mackinac. Located on the southern side of the straits is the town of Mackinaw City, the site of Fort Michilimackinac, a reconstructed French fort founded in 1715, and on the northern side is St. Ignace, site of a French Catholic mission to the Indians, founded in 1671. The eastern end of the straits was controlled by Fort Mackinac on Mackinac Island, a British colonial and early American military base and fur trade center, founded in 1781. History A French Catholic mission to the Indians was founded at St. Ignace in 1671. In 1715, Fort Michilimackinac was built by the French on the south end of the straits' narrow. Michilimackinac was replaced in 1781 by a British fort, Fort Mackinac, on Mackinac Island. Enbridge Line 5 was built in 1953 as an extension of the Interprovincial Pipe Line Company line West of the iconic Mackinac Bridge bringing oil from Alberta to Lake Superior. On December 12, 2018, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder signed a bill establishing the Mackinac Straits Corridor Authority and appointed its first members. Today Mackinac Bridge from Mackinaw City The straits are patrolled by a detachment of the United States Coast Guard based at Graham Point, St. Ignace. A shipping channel through the winter ice is maintained by the Coast Guard's Great Lakes icebreaker, USCGC Mackinaw, based in Cheboygan near the eastern edge of the Straits. This vessel went into service during the 2005/06 ice season. The Shepler's ferry dock in Mackinaw City Two ferry companies operate out of Mackinaw City and St. Ignace, connecting tourists and commuters to Mackinac Island: Shepler's Ferry and the Star Line Ferry. Old Mackinac Point Lighthouse Most of the Straits have been set aside by the state of Michigan as the Straits of Mackinac Shipwreck Preserve, a riparian public space dedicated to those personnel who were lost aboard the boats and ships that sank in these dangerous shipping lanes. Lighthouses in the Straits of Mackinac include: *The McGulpin Point Light, on McGulpin Point, west of Fort Michilimackinac. *The Old Mackinac Point Light, in Mackinaw City, which is open to the public. *The Round Island Light on Round Island, which is not open to the public but which can be viewed from the Mackinac Island ferry channel. Enbridge pipeline Mackinac Bridge West of the iconic Mackinac Bridge is Enbridge's pipeline, called Enbridge Line 5, which was built in 1953 as an extension of the Interprovincial Pipe Line Company line bringing oil from Alberta to Lake Superior. The 1953 pipeline enters the Straits of Mackinac water on the north shore at St. Ignace, Michigan and lies along the bottom of the Straits which is nearly in places. By 2013 Enbridge had increased the \\"maximum capacity on the lines to 540,000 barrels per day\\". In selling the idea of the pipeline to residents living near the Straits, the pipeline developers claimed, it was \\"essential to the defense of the United States and the whole North American continent\\". A University of Michigan study studied the risks of a leak, leading to experts and local governments calling for the shutdown of the pipeline. In late June 2019, the state of Michigan filed a lawsuit asking the Ingham County Court to compel the decommissioning of the segment of Line 5 that runs under the Straits of Mackinac. A Reuters news report defined Line 5 as \\"a critical part of Enbridge‚Äôs Mainline network, which delivers the bulk of Canadian crude exports to the United States\\". The basis of the suit is the claim that the pipeline is a public nuisance and violates the Michigan Environmental Protection Act since it may become the source of pollution. The news report adds that \\"it is unclear if Line 5 could operate without the Straits segment\\".https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2019/06/27/nessel- court-line-5-environment-risk-shutdown/1582536001/, Nessel to court: Shut down Line 5 as environmental risk Mackinac Straits Corridor Authority On December 12, 2018, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder signed a bill establishing the Mackinac Straits Corridor Authority, which is charged with overseeing construction and operation of a tunnel to hold a new Enbridge Line 5 under the lake bed in the straits. Snyder also appointed its first members: Geno Alessandrini of Iron Mountain, Anthony England of Ypsilanti and Michael Zimmer of Dimondale, who serve six-year terms.

Based on the Lockheed C-130 Hercules transport, the MC-130s' missions are the infiltration, exfiltration, and resupply of special operations forces, and the air refueling of (primarily) special operations helicopter and tilt-rotor aircraft. The family comprises: * in service: ** MC-130H Combat Talon II ** MC-130J Commando II * retired: ** MC-130E Combat Talon I ** MC-130P Combat Shadow ** MC-130W Combat/Dragon Spear A possible MC-130 variant, designated the XFC-130H, did not proceed beyond the development stage, but one of its aircraft became the YMC-130H testbed aircraft for the Combat Talon II. The first of the variants, the MC-130E, was developed to support clandestine special operations missions during the Vietnam War. Eighteen were created by modifying C-130E transports, and four lost through attrition, but the remainder served more than four decades after their initial modification. An update, the MC-130H Combat Talon II, was developed in the 1980s from the C-130H and went into service in the 1990s. Four of the original 24 H-series aircraft have been lost in operations. The Combat Shadows were built during the Vietnam War for search and rescue operations and repurposed in the 1980s as AFSOC air-refueling tankers; the last of the 24 retired in 2015. The Combat Spear was developed in 2006 as an inexpensive version of the Combat Talon II but was reconfigured and designated the AC-130W Stinger II in 2012. The MC-130J, which became operational in 2011, is the new-production variant that is replacing the other special operations MC-130s.\\"First HC/MC-130J Assembled\\" , Air Force Magazine December 2009. Air Force Association. Retrieved 4 December 2009. As of May 2016, the Air Force has taken delivery of 33 of the planned 37 -J models. MC-130E Combat Talon MC-130E Combat Talon dispensing flares MC-130 nose =Development= The Combat Talon was developed between December 1964 and January 1967 by Lockheed Air Services (LAS) at Ontario, California, as the result of a study by Big Safari, the USAF's program office that modifies and sustains special mission aircraft. Two highly classified testbed aircraft (originally serial no. 64-0506 and -0507, but with all numbers \\"sanitized\\" from the aircraft), were assigned to Project Thin Slice to develop a low-level clandestine penetration aircraft for Special Forces operations in Southeast Asia. In 1964, Lockheed was ordered to adapt the C-130Es after six C-123B Providers modified for \\"unconventional warfare\\" under Project Duck Hook proved inadequate for the new MACV-SOG.Thigpen (2001), p. 20. The modifications under Thin Slice and its August 1966 successor Heavy Chain were code-named Rivet Yard,Rivet is the prefix designation for the names of all modification projects controlled by the Big Safari office, in this case its Detachment 4 at Ontario, California. and the four C-130Es came to be known as \\"Yards\\". Thigpen commanded the 8th SOS during Operation Just Cause and spent more than 10 years in the Combat Talon program. Discrete modification tests were conducted by the 1198th Operational Evaluation and Training Squadron, out of Area II of Norton AFB at San Bernardino, California, 30 miles east of Ontario.Olausson, Lars, Lockheed Hercules Production List ‚Äì 1954‚Äì2008 ‚Äì 25th ed., S√•ten√§s, Sweden, April 2007.

MC-130E Combat Talon I of the Air Force Reserve's 919th Special Operations Wing taxis to the runway at RIAT 2010 As the Thin Slice aircraft were being developed, 14 C-130Es were purchased for SOG in 1965 for similar modification. The first aircraft were production C-130Es without specialized equipment that were produced at Lockheed's facility in Marietta, Georgia. Three production airplanes per month were given the Fulton STARS (then ARS) system. While awaiting the ARS equipment, the C-130s were ferried to Greenville, South Carolina, for painting by Ling-Temco-Vought Electrosystems with a low-radar reflective paint that added 168 kg (370 lbs) to their weight. The velvet black-and-green scheme drew the nickname \\"Blackbirds\\".Thigpen (2001), p. 58. That nickname lasted until the 1980s, when Dupont stopped manufacturing the paint. As installation was completed, the Blackbirds were returned to Ontario for installation of the electronics package, code-named Rivet Clamp. The modified aircraft became known as \\"Clamps\\" (two of the original 14, 64-0564 and -0565, were diverted to Heavy Chain in August 1966). The aircraft collectively were assigned the designation Combat Talon in 1967.Thigpen (2001), p. 88. The Fulton Surface-To- Air Recovery System was used to extract personnel and materials via air. A large helium balloon raised a nylon lift line into the air, which was snagged by a large scissors-shaped yoke attached to the nose of the plane. The yoke snagged the line and released the balloon, yanking the attached cargo off the ground with a shock less than that of an opening parachute. A sky anchor secured the line and wires stretched from the nose to both leading wing tip edges protected the propellers from the line on missed snag attempts. Crew members hooked the snagged line as it trailed behind and attached it to the hydraulic winch, pulling the attached person or cargo into the plane through the rear cargo door. Following a death on 26 April 1982, at CFB Lahr, Germany,Thigpen (2001), pp. 261‚Äì262, Appendix A, p. 469. The Special Forces soldier suffered a punctured lung and broken hip in the short fall, but died of complications from a tracheotomy during medical evacuation. the Fulton STARS system on the Clamp aircraft underwent intense maintenance scrutiny and employment of the system for live pickups was suspended. A major effort at upgrading the system, Project 46,Thigpen (2001), p. 304. So-called because its objective was to develop a capability of extracting four to six troops in a single pass. was pursued from 1986 to 1989, but at its conclusion, use of the STARS system for live extractions remained suspended. The Fulton STARS equipment of all Combat Talons was removed during 1998.Thigpen (2001), p. 38. Rivet Clamp installation began with four STARS-equipped C-130s completed by March 1966, followed by installations in eight further aircraft in July 1966 and January 1967. The Rivet Clamps, originally designated C-130E(I)sp, were equipped with an electronic and infrared (IR) countermeasures suite; and the SPR2 later the AN/APQ-115 TF/TA multimode radar. This radar, adapted from the Texas Instruments AN/APQ-99 radar used in the RF-4C Phantom photo reconnaissance aircraft, featured terrain following/terrain-avoidance (TF/TA) and mapping radar modes, to enable it to operate at low altitudes at night and in all weather conditions and avoid known enemy radar and anti-aircraft weapons concentrations.Thigpen (2001), p. 21. The 12 original C-130E(I) \\"Clamps\\" were 64-0523, -0547, -0551, -0555, -0558, -0559, -0561, -0562, -0563, -0566, -0567, and -0568. Beginning in 1970, Texas Instruments and Lockheed Air Service worked to adapt the existing AN/APQ-122 Adverse Weather Aerial Delivery System (AWADS) with terrain following/terrain avoidance modes to replace the original APQ-115, which suffered throughout its life with an unacceptably adverse mean-time-between-failure (MTBF) rate. In 1970 they succeeded, and coupled the APQ-122 with the Litton LN-15J Inertial Navigation System (INS). Known as MOD-70, the modified radar was installed in all 12 operational Combat Talons and the four Heavy Chain test beds between 1971‚Äì73. The system proved so successful that it continued in service until the late 1980s.Thigpen (2001), p. 66. Following the completion of MOD-70, the Combat Talons were divided into three designations: C-130E(CT) for the \\"Clamp\\" aircraft, C-130E(Y) for the \\"Yank\\" (formerly \\"Yard\\") Talons, and C-130E(S) for the \\"Swap\\".Thigpen (2001), p. 70. The \\"Swap\\" Talons were originally Rivet Clamp modifications without the Fulton STARS apparatus. The Combat Talon I designations were consolidated in 1977 as the MC-130 and have remained under that designation since.Thigpen (2001), p. 168. The Combat Talon became the Combat Talon I in 1984 with the authorization for the modification of 24 C-130Hs to Combat Talon II specifications.Thigpen (2001), P. 396. The \\"Yank\\" Talons conducted top secret operations worldwide, under the project name Combat Sam, until late 1972. Two of the original \\"Clamps\\" were lost in combat in Southeast Asia and were replaced by two C-130Es (64-0571 and -0572). These remained as Combat Talons until 1972, when Heavy Chain was gradually discontinued and its four \\"Yank\\" aircraft were integrated into the Combat Talon force. The two original Thin Slice aircraft were given the serials of two destroyed C-130s, 62-1843 and 63-7785 respectively, to disguise their classified origins. The replacements had their modifications removed and returned to airlift duties, although known as \\"Swaps\\", they remained available for future Combat Talon use. Both eventually became Combat Talons again after further losses in the Combat Talon inventory. Capability to act as a Forward Area Refueling Point (FARP) for helicopters on the ground was begun in 1980 in preparation for Operation Eagle Claw (see below), although only one system could be installed before the mission was executed. The refueling system consists of two palletized 6,800 L (1,800 gal) tanks (known as Benson tanks) mounted on rails within the Talon that tie into the C-130's own pressurized fuel dumping pumps and require no further equipment.Thigpen (2001), p. 237. A major modification between 1986 and 1994, MOD-90, modernized the capability and serviceability of the Talon I to extend its service life. All 14 Combat Talon Is were equipped with upgraded navigational radars, an enhanced electronic warfare suite and provided new outer wings.Thigpen (2001), p. 473, lists all the changes. Other notable major upgrades were engine upgrade to Allison T56-A-15, new center wing boxes, installation of flare/chaff dispensers, infrared defensive pods, new FLIR, low gloss two-shade gray paint, the Universal Aerial Refueling Receptacle/Slipway, and Benson tanks for all aircraft. By 1995 all Combat Talon Is were equipped with helicopter-air refueling pods.Thigpen (2001), pp. 49 and 56. =Southeast Asia operations= The aircraft received for modification as Combat Talons were assigned in July 1965 to the 464th Troop Carrier Wing at Pope Air Force Base, North Carolina. Because of a lack of ramp space caused by the buildup of forces for deployment to South Vietnam, they were temporarily housed at Sewart Air Force Base, Tennessee. The wing's 779th TCS was designated as the training squadron for the modified C-130E(I)s, under Project Skyhook, in addition to its normal airlift function. Selected crew members received instructor training in their respective systems and returned to Pope by May 1 to begin crew training of six crews for deployment to Vietnam under Project Stray Goose. 15th Special Operations Squadron The Combat Talon I first saw operational action in the Vietnam War, beginning September 1, 1966. The six Stray Goose crews deployed to Ching Chuan Kang Air Base, Taiwan, and forward deployed to Nha Trang Air Base, South Vietnam. The deployment, known as Combat Spear, preceded operational deployment of other Combat Talons to Europe (Combat Arrow) and the United States (Combat Knife). Combat Spear was administratively assigned as Detachment 1, 314th Troop Carrier Wing, but was operationally controlled by MACV-SOG.Thigpen (2001), pp. 77‚Äì78. On October 9, 2009, Detachment 1, 314th Troop Carrier Wing received the Presidential Unit Citation for its support of MACV-SOG activities. Chief of Staff of the Air Force General Norton A. Schwartz presented the award to the unit during a ceremony at Hurlburt Field, culminating a six-year campaign by former Stray Goose member Richard H. SellThigpen (2001), pp. 84‚Äì85. Sell was co-pilot of 64-0563 when it flew the first resupply mission into North Vietnam on January 17, 1967, to support a SOG Road Watch team, for which the entire SG-05 crew received the Distinguished Flying Cross. to achieve the recognition after the unit was not included in a PUC awarded April 4, 2001, to MACV-SOG for the same period. On March 15, 1968, the detachment was designated the 15th Air Commando Squadron, and then the 15th Special Operations Squadron on August 1, 1968, and made part of the 14th Special Operations Wing. In Vietnam, the aircraft was used to drop leaflets over North Vietnamese positions, and to insert and resupply special forces and indigenous units into hostile territory throughout Southeast Asia. Combat Talon crews operated unescorted at low altitudes and at night.Thigpen (2001), pp. 82‚Äì83. By 1970 twelve Combat Talons were operational in three units of four aircraft each:Thigpen (2001), p. 139. * 7th Special Operations Squadron, Ramstein Air Base, Germany; * 15th Special Operations Squadron, Nha Trang Air Base, South Vietnam; and * Detachment 2, 1st Special Operations Wing, Pope Air Force Base, North Carolina, (redesignated 318th SOS in 1971 and 8th SOS in 1974).Thigpen (2001), p. 67. By tradition, the Talon base within the continental United States, because of its training responsibilities, is referred to as \\"the schoolhouse,\\" a nickname first passed to Hurlburt Field, then to Kirtland Air Force Base when the 550th SOS began operations. The 15th SOS was redesignated the 90th SOS on October 23, 1970,Thigpen (2001), p. 111. The 90th had been an A-37 Dragonfly attack squadron, and when the A-37's were turned over to the Vietnamese Air Force, its designation was transferred to preserve its long heritage. relocated to Cam Ranh Bay Air Base,Thigpen (2001), p. 113, then moved to Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, in April 1972 as part of the drawdown of U.S. forces in Vietnam. It was again redesignated, becoming the 1st SOS on December 15, 1972, and began transition from the \\"Clamp\\" to the \\"Yank\\" variant.Thigpen (2001), p. 114. The following Talons served in Southeast Asia at some point between 1966 and 1972: 64-0523, -0547 (lost), -0551, -0555, -0558, -0561, -0562, -0563 (lost), -0567, and -0568. Kingpin Mixed formation of helicopters and Combat Talon of the Son Tay rescue operation during a practice mission Two Combat Talons were employed as navigation escorts and for airborne control during Operation Kingpin, the operational phase of the attempted rescue of prisoners of war from Son Tay prison camp in North Vietnam on November 21, 1970. 64-0523 was drawn from the 15th SOS at Nha TrangThigpen (2001), p. 143. The Talon was already at LAS Ontario for previously-scheduled modifications when it was sourced to the rescue operation. and 64-0558 from Det. 2, 1st SOW at Pope AFB. The aircraft were modified at LAS Ontario with installation of FL-2B FLIR sets borrowed from the Heavy Chain project to compensate for difficulties in terrain- following created by the slow speeds necessitated by the mixed aircraft force.Gargus, John (2007), The Son Tay Raid: American POWs in Vietnam Were Not Forgotten, Texas A&M; Press. , p. 58. Gargus was radar navigator on Cherry 02 and a mission planner. 24 primary and five backup crew personnel, all Stray Goose/Combat Spear veterans detached from 7th SOS (Combat Arrow) and 1st SOW (Combat Knife), developed helicopter-fixed wing formation procedures for low level night missions and jointly trained with selected Special Forces volunteers at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. Between the end of August and September 28, 1970, Talon, helicopter, and A-1 Skyraider crews supervised by Combat Talon Program Manager Lt. Col. Benjamin N. Kraljev rehearsed the flight profile in terrain-following missions over southern Alabama, flying 368 sorties that totalled more than 1,000 hours.Gargus (2007), pp. 63‚Äì64. A month of intensive joint training with the Special Forces rescue force followed at a replica of the prison camp. In early November the task force deployed to Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. The 24 primary crew members, a 7th SOS crew (Cherry 01) under Major Irl L. \\"Leon\\" Franklin and a 1st SOW crew (Cherry 02) commanded by Lt Col Albert P. \\"Friday\\" Blosch, conducted the mission, which was successfully executed without loss of any personnel. However the operation failed when the prison was found not to contain any prisoners.Thigpen (2001), pp. 139‚Äì157. =Post-Vietnam developments= In 1974 the Combat Talon program was nearly dismantled as the Air Force sought to reverse its Vietnam emphasis on special operations. The 1st Special Operations Wing was redesignated the 834th Tactical Composite Wing and its Combat Talons of the 8th SOS became a TAC asset. However the use of 1st SOS \\"Yank\\" Talons in a sea surveillance role off North Korea in 1975 revived interest in the Combat Talon,Thigpen (2001), p. 160. as did the Israeli hostage rescue at Entebbe Airport. The same year, a Combat Talon of the 1st Special Operations Wing was deployed in support of US Marines forces on Koh Tang island during the Mayaguez incident, dropping a single BLU-82 6,800 kg (15,000 lb) bomb to enable their extraction. However, as late as 1978‚Äì79, Air Force Special Operations Forces was still disregarded by many staff planners, who saw it as a drain on resources and not a force enabler, and wanted the entire Talon force transferred to the Air National Guard.Koskinas (2006), p. 103. In early 1977 the Combat Talon was redesignated MC-130E by Headquarters Air Force for all three variants of the aircraft. By November 1979, the Combat Talon force of 14 MC-130Es was divided among three squadrons, the first two of which were operationally deployed, and the third at Hurlburt essentially the force training squadron:Thigpen (2001), p. 184. * 1st Special Operations Squadron, Kadena Air Base, Okinawa ‚Äì (four MC-130 Yanks); * 7th Special Operations Squadron, Ramstein Air Base, Germany ‚Äì (four MC-130 Clamps); and * 8th Special Operations Squadron, Hurlburt Field, Florida ‚Äì (six MC-130 Clamps). Eagle Claw 1st Special Operations Squadron Following the seizure of the U.S. embassy in Tehran, Iran, on November 4, 1979, training operations for a rescue mission of the 53 hostages began as early as November 7 by Talon crews at Kadena AB, and November 26 by crews at Hurlburt.Thigpen (2001), p. 182. At that time only seven Combat Talons had the in-flight refueling capability necessary for the mission, which was to be mounted out of either Egypt or Diego Garcia (Masirah Island did not become available as a base until April 1980).Thigpen (2001), p. 184. 62-1843, 63-7785, 64-0564, and 64-0565 of the 1st SOS, and 64-0562, 64-0567, and 64-0572 of the 8th SOS. In-flight refueling of helicopters was rejected as an option because the HC-130s available to refuel them had no IFR capability themselves. All were assigned to the operation, a complex two-night plan called Eagle Claw. Talon crews using night vision goggles practiced blacked-out landings to insert Delta Force operators and U.S. Army Rangers deep into Iran, and developed several methods for delivering extra fuel for the US Navy RH-53D Sea Stallion helicopters chosen to carry out the rescued hostages. Four transcontinental, all-component, two- night rehearsals were held between December 1979 and March 1980, including a full-scale rehearsal March 25‚Äì26 that involved every element of the final plan except three EC-130s chosen to fly in fuel for the helicopters.Thigpen (2001), pp. 194‚Äì207. Electing to use EC-130s to ground refuel the helicopters instead of air-dropping blivets was not formally approved until April. The method was favored by ground commander Col Charles Beckwith, however, and so had been successfully rehearsed many times. Preparatory work to lay out the Desert One airstrip, acquire the EC-130s, and stage essential materiel to Egypt had preceded the formal approval of Eagle Claw's final form by weeks. Talons played the role of the three EC-130s in the full-scale rehearsal. The Holloway Commission criticized the task force for failing to conduct such a rehearsal, but since it did in fact occur, the commission may have been contending that another or multiple independently assessed \\"dress\\" rehearsals was desirable after the final form was approved by the JCS on April 16, in hopes that the command and control difficulties would have been uncovered. With a May 1 deadline because of a decreasing number of hours of darkness, there was no time to lay on further \\"dress rehearsals\\", and all of the elements used on April 24 were in fact successfully executed March 25‚Äì26. The entire training process was a five-month evolution of the two-night concept, employing techniques never before tried that had to be perfected before they could be rehearsed with other components. The ad hoc nature of this process, with its components scattered at various sites and stressing a \\"piece of the pie\\" for all the military services that resulted in helicopters and crews who were not special operations-trained, failed to build a team mentality, and it was this failure that the Holloway Commission targeted. The inclusion of the Navy helicopters proved particularly damaging because their air refueling probes had been removed, resulting in the necessity of the Desert One refueling point where the debacle occurred, whereas the Air Force special ops helicopters could have been aerial refueled in flight. The four Talons (including a spare) of the 1st SOS staged to Masirah Island off the coast of Oman on April 19, 1980, to lead the Night One infiltration phase, while the three of the 8th SOS deployed to Wadi Qena, Egypt, on April 21 to lead the Night Two exfiltration phase.Thigpen (2007), pp. 213‚Äì215. Of the eight crews assigned, five were from 8th SOS and three from 1st SOS. The extra 1st SOS Talon and its crew were both a spare and the primary aircraft for Elbow Rub, an alternative, highly classified project to heavily damage Iran's power grid had it been ordered as a retaliatory mission for harming the hostages (Thigpen, p. 203). To establish a \\"normal\\" C-130 presence in Egypt, Talons of the 7th SOS (none of which had aerial refueling capability) conducted regular flights using Military Airlift Command call signs in and out of Wadi Qena between January 2 and April 8, 1980. They also used the deception to discreetly pre-position needed equipment, including ammunition for AC-130 gunships, at the staging base.Thigpen (2001), p. 196. The Talon crews also manned three borrowed EC-130E ABCCC aircraft configured to carry 68,100 L (18,000 U.S. gal) of jet fuel in six collapsible bladders for refueling the helicopters.Thigpen (2001), p. 213. The aircraft were obtained without crews and without their communications capsules from the 42nd Airborne Command and Control Squadron at Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi, the first on March 15, 1980, and the other two on April 14. After returning to Masirah, three of the 8th SOS Night One crews would be flown to Wadi Qena to carry out the Night Two mission.Thigpen (2001), p. 211. The seventh primary crew, including author Thigpen, waited at Wadi Qena to lead the Night Two phase. The three crews would have been those of the lead Talon (Dragon 1), and two of the EC-130s, Republic 4 and Republic 6. Most of the crew of Republic 4 died at Desert One. The first phase of the rescue mission began the evening of April 24, led by Lt Col Robert L. Brenci of the 8th SOS in Talon 64-0565, Dragon 1. The 1st SOS Talons successfully secured the forward operating location (\\"Desert One\\") in the Iranian Desert, but the helicopter portion of the mission ended in disaster. Although the mission was an embarrassing failure costing eight lives, seven helicopters, and an EC-130E aircraft in a ground accident, the MC-130s performed nearly flawlessly.Thigpen (2001), p. 228. Planning initiatives for a second rescue attempt, under the project name Honey Badger, began two weeks after the failed raid and continued through November. Combat Talon participation in Honey Badger amounted largely to tactics development, but ECM improvements included chaff and flare dispensers and new ALR-69 threat receivers that improved its defensive countermeasures capability well beyond that existing prior to Eagle Claw. Urgent Fury 8th Special Operations Squadron Five Combat Talons of the 8th Special Operations Squadron participated in Operation Urgent Fury, the United States invasion of Grenada between October 25 and 31, 1983.Thigpen (2001), p. 177. The MC-130Es were 64-0562, -0572, -0568, -0567, and -0551. Unlike previous operations that involved months of planning, training, and reconnaissance, the 8th SOS prepared in less than 72 hours after being alerted.Thigpen (2001), p. 276. Its assignment was to insert Rangers of the 1st and 2nd Ranger Battalions at night to capture Point Salines International Airport, defended by both Cuban and Grenadan troops, in the opening moments of the operation. The five Talons divided into three elements, two of them leading formations of Special Operations Low Level-equipped (SOLL) C-130 transports.Thigpen (2001), pp. 281‚Äì282. In clouds at above the sea and west of its objective, the lead Talon (64-0562) experienced a complete failure of its APQ-122 radar. Reorganization of the mission formations delayed the operation for 30 minutes, during which U.S. Marines made their amphibious landing. To compound the lack of surprise, the U.S. Department of State, apparently in a good faith but inept diplomatic gesture, contacted Cuban authorities and compromised the mission, further alerting the defenses, including a dozen ZU-23-2 antiaircraft guns. An AC-130 Spectre gunship, directed to observe the main runway for obstructions, reported it blocked by construction equipment and barricades. Loadmasters aboard the inbound Combat Talons reconfigured them for a parachute drop in less than thirty minutes.Thigpen (2001), p. 282. Talon 64-0568, flown as Foxtrot 35 by 8th SOS commander Lt Col James L. HobsonMajor General James L. Hobson, Jr. , Air Force.mil. Retrieved 2016-04-06 and with the commander of the Twenty-Third Air Force, Maj Gen William J. Mall, Jr., aboard as a passenger, combat-dropped runway clearing teams from the Ranger Battalions on the airport, despite being targeted by a searchlight and under heavy AAA fire. Two Spectre gunships suppressed the AAA so that the other Combat Talons and the SOLL C-130s could complete the parachute drop of the Rangers, with the only damage to the Talons being three hits by small arms fire to 64-0572.Thigpen (2001), pp. 181‚Äì186. For his actions, Hobson was awarded the MacKay Trophy in 1984.Thigpen (2001), p. 296. =Other Combat Talon operations= Just Cause 1st SOW Talons supported Operation Just Cause, the United States invasion of Panama in December 1989 and January 1990. Three MC-130Es of the 1st Special Operations Wing deployed to Hunter Army Air Field, Georgia within 48 hours of being alerted, then airlanded Rangers of the 2nd Battalion 75th Ranger Regiment into Rio Hato Military Airfield on December 18, 1989. The operation was conducted under total blackout conditions, using night vision goggles, 35 minutes after the opening parachute assault. One of the MC-130s had an engine disabled by a ground obstruction while taxiing, then made an NVG takeoff on three engines under intense ground fire, earning its pilot the Distinguished Flying Cross. The lead Talon, the only MC-130E equipped with the Benson tank refueling system, remained on the airfield as a Forward Area Refueling and Rearming Point (FARRP) for U.S. Army OH-6 helicopters.Thigpen (2001), pp. 323‚Äì330. When Panamanian General Manuel Noriega surrendered on January 3, he was immediately flown to Homestead Air Force Base, Florida, by a Combat Talon.Thigpen (2001), p. 335. Maj. David L. \\"Skip\\" Davenport was awarded the DFC at Rio Hato, and also flew Noriega to the United States. Desert Storm MC-130E Combat Talon I of 711th SOS, 1996‚Äìpresent The 1990 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq resulted in the deployment of four Combat Talons and six crews of the 8th SOS in August 1990 to King Fahd International Airport in Saudi Arabia as a component of Operation Desert Shield.Thigpen (2001), p. 345. 64-0559, -0562, -0567, and -0568. During Operation Desert Storm, the combat phase of the Gulf War in January and February 1991, the Combat Talon performed one-third of all airdrops during the campaign, and participated in psychological operations, flying 15 leaflet-drop missions before and throughout the war. Combat Talon crews also conducted five BLU-82B \\"Daisy Cutter\\" missions during the two weeks preceding the onset of the ground campaign, dropping 11 bombs on Iraqi positions at night from altitudes between and , once in concert with a bombardment by the battleship USS Wisconsin.Thigpen (2001), pp. 264‚Äì265. Two 7th SOS Talons deployed to Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, as part of Operation Proven Force. They supported the first Joint Search and Rescue mission over Iraq, attempting to recover the crew of Corvette 03, a downed F-15E Strike Eagle. However permission from the Turkish government to fly the mission was delayed for 24 hours, and the crew was not recovered.Thigpen (2001), p. 361. After the war it was found that both F-15E crewmen had died in the crash. =Air Force Reserve Command= On October 6, 1995, the Air Force began shifting the Combat Talon I force with the transfer of MC-130E, AF Ser. No. 64-0571, to the Air Force Reserve Command's 919th Special Operations Wing, 711th Special Operations Squadron, based at Duke Field (Eglin AFB Auxiliary Field #3), Florida. The 919th had previously flown the AC-130A Spectre in the gunship / close air support mission, and the increasing age of the AC-130A aircraft necessitated their retirement. Six MC-130E aircraft went to the 711th SOS over the next year for crew training, and the squadron became operational on March 1, 1997.Thigpen (2001), p. 408. On March 5, 1999, the 8th Special Operations Squadron became the first active force squadron to become an Associate Unit to an Air Reserve Component organization, co-located with the 711th SOS, but without aircraft of its own, flying those of the reserve unit.Thigpen (2001), p. 452. Prior to this, all associate units were Air Force Reserve organizations assigned to active force wings. Ten of the Combat Talon Is were primary assigned aircraft (PAA), two were assigned to crew training, and two were placed in backup inventory aircraft (BIA) storage.Thigpen (2001), p. 461. A Combat Talon I was the first aircraft to land at New Orleans International Airport after Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. On July 14, 2006, the 8th SOS flew its last Combat Talon I mission and began conversion to the CV-22 Osprey, ending 41 years of active service for the MC-130E Combat Talon I. Although retired from the Regular Air Force, the MC-130E continued to remain in service with the Air Force Reserve Command's 919th Special Operations Wing.. =Retirement= The MC-130E Combat Talon I has been replaced by the MC-130J Commando II, which has the capability to complete missions faster and more efficiently than its MC-130H Combat Talon II and MC-130P Combat Shadow counterparts. Recapitalization was a stated priority of Lt Gen Donald C. Wurster, former commander of Air Force Special Operations Command.\\"MC-130J rollout accelerates AFSOC recapitalization\\" by Rachel Arroyo, AFSOC Public Affairs, 05 April 2011 Only eight MC-130E aircraft were still active in 2009, and four in 2013. On 15 April 2013, the four MC-130Es took off on their final mission.Air Force Combat Talons Fly for Last Time ‚Äì Air Force.mil, April 6, 2016 The MC-130E Combat Talon I was finally retired on 25 April 2013 in ceremonies at Duke Field. Three of the aircraft were then flown to the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona, while the fourth aircraft, AF Ser. No. 64-0523 (nicknamed \\"Godfather\\") was flown to Cannon AFB, New Mexico on June 22, 2012, for eventual display at that base's airpark.http://www.919sow.afrc.af.mil/photos/mediagallery.asp?galleryID=1371&?id=-1&page;=1&count;=24 The retirement date marked the 33rd anniversary of the Desert One, the mission to free American hostages in Iran, of which several MC-130Es were a part.Air Force bids farewell to Combat Talon I ‚Äì Af.mil, April 30, 2013 MC-130H Combat Talon II =Combat Talon II Development= Credible Sport One of the measures considered for a second hostage rescue attempt in Iran was a project to develop a \\"Super STOL\\" aircraft, to be flown by Combat Talon crews, that would use a soccer stadium near the US Embassy as an improvised landing field. Called Credible Sport, the project acquired three C-130H transports from an airlift unit in late August 1980, one as a test bed and two for the mission, and quickly modified them.Thigpen (2001), p. 241. C-130Hs used in Credible Sport were 74-1683, -1686, and -2065. Designated the XFC-130H, the aircraft were fitted with 30 maneuvering rockets in five sets: eight firing forward to stop the aircraft, eight downward to slow its descent, eight rearward for takeoff assist, four on the wings to stabilize them during takeoff transition, and two at the rear of the tail to prevent it from striking the ground because of over-rotation. Other STOL features included a dorsal and two ventral fins on the rear fuselage, double-slotted flaps and extended ailerons, a new radome, a tailhook for landing aboard an aircraft carrier, and Combat Talon avionics, including a TF/TA radar, a defensive countermeasures suite, and a Doppler radar/GPS tie-in to the aircraft's inertial navigation system.Thigpen (2001), pp. 241‚Äì244, includes photographs of all the external features. Of the three aircraft, only one received full modification. The program abruptly ended when one crashed during testing on October 29, 1980; international events soon rendered another rescue attempt moot.Thigpen (2001), p. 245‚Äì246. Testing and delivery MC-130H Combat Talon II of 15th SOS One of the two surviving Credible Sport airframes, 74-1686, became the YMC-130H test bed for the next generation of Combat Talons, under the project name Credible Sport II. Phase I testing, conducted between August 24 and November 11, 1981, identified design deficiencies in the airframe and determined that the Credible Sport configuration did not have the safety margins necessary for peacetime operations. Phase II testing began June 15, 1982, continued through October 1982, and determined that the final Combat Talon II configuration, with significant improvements in design, avionics, and equipment, was ready for production. The initial purchase was authorized in 1982 at 12 aircraft, even though war-fighting requirements were estimated at more than 100, but was cut from funding until 1984. In 1983, USAF Special Operations Forces were transferred to the Military Airlift Command, seen as another move by USAF to divest itself of its special operations role.Thigpen (2001), p. 291. Creation of the 23rd Air Force reinforced that perception; SOF represented less than 35% of its personnel and virtually none of its headquarters staff, dominated by the \\"rescue community\\".Koskinas (2006), p. 123‚Äì124, points out that MAC had been forced to virtually combine ARRS and 23AF headquarters because of funding shortages for authorized staff billets, and asserts it was unable to draw on SOF personnel because it had committed itself to TAC to maintain a separate identity for SOF units. However, the moves did remove the Combat Talon program from three fighter-oriented commands to a single command where promotion cycles were more favorable.Thigpen (2001), p. 292. In 1983, MAC established a Special Operations Force Master Plan that called for 21 Combat Talon IIs, including two attrition backups, with initial operational capability in the third quarter of 1987 and full delivery by 1991.Thigpen (2001), p. 293. The first Combat Talon II, 83-1212, was delivered in June 1984, but an earlier decision by USAF not to equip it with the navigational radar suite of the MC-130E slowed its development for years. In the meantime, Initiative 17, part of the \\"31 Initiatives\\" agreement between the Army and Air Force in May 1984,Koskinas (2006), pp. 138 and 160. The 31 initiatives were a Memorandum of Agreement that identified 31 ways in three areas‚Äîeliminating duplication of effort or merging similar programs, roles and missions, and joint action or cooperation‚Äîthat would integrate the services' efforts in the AirLand Battle doctrine for fighting the Warsaw Pact. was deferred later that year (and eventually killed) after objections from members of Congress who saw it as a divestiture of the SOF role by the Air Force.Thigpen (2001), p. 294. Initiative 17 would have transferred the entire rotary wing SOF effort over to the Army. As a result, the Air Force cut procurement of new HH-60D Nighthawk combat rescue aircraft from its budget requests‚Äîfurther delaying the Combat Talon II program, whose glass cockpit and integrated avionics systems were tied, for cost reasons, to those of the HH-60D. Five Combat Talon IIs were delivered in 1985 but the problem of acquiring a navigation radar had not been resolved (the APQ-122 was no longer being built). IBM was contracted to develop a new terrain following/avoidance radar, who then subcontracted the task to Emerson Electric Company. The resulting radar performed so poorly that the Combat Talon II was nearly cancelled, but special operations advocates in Congress kept the program alive. Ultimately the AN/APQ-170(V)8 radar was developed into a system that exceeded specifications, but at a large cost overrun and with a further three- year delay in the Combat Talon II becoming operational.Thigpen (2001), p. 300. The 1985 deliveries were 84-0475, 84-0576, 85-0011, 85-0012, and 86-1699. Deliveries in 1987,Thigpen (2001), p. 309. Delivered were 87-0023, -0024, -0125, -0126, and -0127. 1988,Thigpen (2001), p. 312. delivered in 1988 were 88-0191, -0192, -0193, -0194, and -0264. and 1989Thigpen (2001), p. 314. Delivered in 1989 were 88-0195 and 88-1803. brought the inventory to 18 aircraft, but all were still in modification, testing, or long term storage.Thigpen (2001), p. 316. =Operations 1993‚Äì2000= The first fully operational MC-130H Combat Talon II (87-0024) was received by the 8th SOS on June 29, 1991, with three others delivered over the summer. The official acceptance ceremony for the Talon II was held at Hurlburt in October, and by December 1991 the 8th SOS was equipped with six.Thigpen (2001), p. 378. The Combat Talon II features a stronger airframe and modifications to the rear and aft cargo doors. The electronics suite has been upgraded, and includes Global Positioning System navigation, special radars for navigating in adverse weather, and night vision goggles (NVG) capability. These new technologies allow the Combat Talon II to fly as low as above ground level (AGL) in inclement weather, and make faster, more accurate airdrops. The MC-130H Combat Talon II, like the MC-130E Combat Talon I, can perform a variety of mission profiles, from daytime mid-level overwater flight and Jumpmaster Directed (JMD) personnel airdrop to night-time adverse weather terrain-following flight in mountainous terrain supporting airdrop and airland to covert and clandestine objectives. Increases in automation reduced the aircrew by two and allowed the Combat Talon II to carry an additional pallet of cargo when compared to the Combat Talon I. Initial Operational capability was reached on June 30, 1993.Thigpen (2001), p. 390. MC-130H Reg.88-1803 at RIAT 2010 Three MC-130H Combat Talon IIs of the 7th SOS were deployed in December 1995 to deliver peacekeeping forces to Tuzla and Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, as part of Operation Joint Endeavor, during which one Talon was hit by ground fire.Thigpen (2001), pp. 414, 419. The first combat deployment of a Combat Talon II was on April 8, 1996, during Operation Assured Response. Special operations forces were deployed to Liberia to assist in the evacuation of 2000 civilians from the American embassy when the country broke down into civil war. However orders to combat drop an 18-man SEAL team off Monrovia were rescinded and the mission landed in Sierra Leone.Thigpen (2001), p. 420. Similar circumstances brought the Combat Talon II to Zaire in 1997. Talon II deployments for joint exercises in 1997 included Australia, Guam, Indonesia, South Korea, and Thailand. In July 1997, three Talon IIs deployed to Thailand as part of Operation Bevel Edge, a proposed rescue of 1000 American citizens trapped in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, by a possible civil war, but the crisis ended when the Cambodian government allowed all non-citizens who desired so to leave by commercial air.Thigpen (2001), p. 429. A 7th SOS Combat Talon II aircrew, Whiskey 05, earned the Mackay Trophy for an embassy evacuation mission in the Republic of the Congo in June 1997. The crew rescued thirty Americans and twenty-six foreign nationals, and logged twenty-one hours of flight time. Full Operational Capability for the Talon II was reached in February 2000. At that time 24 MC-130Hs were deployed to four squadrons: * 15th Special Operations Squadron, eleven at Hurlburt Field, Florida; * 1st Special Operations Squadron, five at Kadena AB, Okinawa; * 7th Special Operations Squadron, five at RAF Mildenhall, U.K.; and * 550th Special Operations Squadron, three at Kirtland AFB, New Mexico. =Operations in Southwest Asia= Afghanistan On the night of October 19‚Äì20, 2001, four Combat Talon IIs infiltrated a task force of 199 Rangers of the 3rd Battalion 75th Ranger Regiment and tactical PSYOP teams 658 miles inside Taliban-held Afghanistan. The force dropped onto Objective Rhino (), an unused airfield in Kandahar Province southwest of Kandahar, to secure a landing zone as a temporary operating base for Special Forces units conducting raids in the vicinity. A month later, two MC-130Hs, flying from Masirah Island, inserted a platoon of U.S. Navy SEAL Team Three and four Humvee vehicles to within ten miles of the same airfield on the night of November 20‚Äì21. The SEAL platoon was inserted to establish an observation post at the airstrip, then assist two USAF combat controllers inserted by military free fall in preparing a landing zone for the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit. The 15th MEU landed in CH-53 helicopters on November 25, 2001, and established Camp Rhino, the first forward operating base in Afghanistan for United States forces.Bahmanyar, Mir, and Osman, Chris (2008). SEALs: The U.S. Navy's Elite Fighting Force. Osprey, , pp. 110‚Äì111. Combat Talon IIs of the 7th SOS, augmented by crews from the 15th and 550th SOSs, flew 13- to 15-hour airdrop and airlanding night resupply missions from Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, to Special Forces Operational Detachments-Alpha (ODAs) in Afghanistan during the opening phase of Operation Enduring Freedom in December 2001. Operating in mountainous terrain, they innovated an airdrop tactic by replicating maximum-effort landing techniques to rapidly descend from to AGL to ensure accurate gravity drops after clearing high ridgelines into deep valleys.McCool, John (2005). Interview with Major David Diehl, USAF , Operational Leadership in the Global War on Terrorism. Combat Studies Institute, Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas. Diehl was a crew commander detached from the 550th SOS to the 7th SOS. Iraq 7th Special Operations Squadron The 7th SOS, commanded by Lt Col Mark B. Alsid and part of the 352d Special Operations Group, received the Gallant Unit Citation in 2006 for operations conducted during Operation Iraqi Freedom between February 12 and May 12, 2003. The 7th SOS was tasked to Joint Special Operations Task Force ‚Äì North, known as Task Force Viking, whose objective was to hold 13 Iraqi Army divisions along the \\"Green Line\\" in northeastern Iraq to prevent those divisions from reinforcing other Iraqi operations against United States forces invading from Kuwait.The task assigned to the 5,200-man JSOTF-N was originally that of the entire reinforced 4th Infantry Division, denied the use of Turkey as a jumping off point. Forward-based at Constan≈£a, Romania, its primary mission was to infiltrate the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Army's 10th Special Forces Group and the 3rd Battalion of the 3rd Special Forces Group into Kurdish-held territory in preparation for Operation Northern Delay. Denied permission by Turkey to fly into Iraq from its airspace, the 7th SOS flew the first 280 troops on a circuitous path around Turkey to a base in Jordan on March 20‚Äì21, 2003. On March 22, six Combat Talon IIs (four from the 7th SOS) infiltrated 16 ODAs, four ODBs, battalion command elements, and Air Force Combat Control Teams to complete the fifteen-hour mission, the longest in U.S. Special Operations history. The insertion profile consisted of a four and one-half hour low level flight at night through western and northern Iraq to Bashur and Sulaymaniyah airfields, often taking heavy ground fire from the integrated air defenses.Per Harris, the Talons, penetrating Iraq in single file, encountered four engagements before reaching Tel Afar, then had to transit a known area of dense air defenses referred to as \\"SAM Alley\\", where battle damage was incurred. The Talon IIs, at emergency gross weight limits, operated blacked- out, employed chaff and electronic countermeasures, flew as low as AGL, and carried their troops tethered to the floor of the cargo holds.Known as the \\"Sealy configuration\\", the technique was developed during Eagle Claw and became standard. Three of the Talons were battle-damaged, with one forced to seek permission to land at Incirlik Air Base. The operation became known informally as \\"Operation Ugly Baby\\".McCool, John (2005). Interview with Major David Harris, USAF , Operational Leadership in the Global War on Terrorism. Combat Studies Institute, Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas. Briscoe and Robinson attribute the term \\"Ugly Baby\\" to a quip by a Special Forces trooper after seeing the flight path from Romania. However Harris, a radar navigator on one of the aircraft, states that the Talon II electronic warfare officer mission planner coined the term for the infiltration route inside Iraq after analyzing the Iraqi air defenses. Major Jason L.

After airlanding their troops, the Talon IIs then had to fly back through the alerted defenses to recover to their launching point. Overflight permission was granted by Turkey on March 23, and the Combat Talon IIs delivered a total of 50 ODAs into Iraq. The Talon IIs then resupplied Task Force Viking, assisted in operations to capture Kirkuk and Mosul, airlanded supplies at remote outposts using Internal Airlift Slingable Container Units (ISUs), and acted as pathfinders for conventional C-130 airlift missions. MC-130P Combat Shadow MC-130P Combat Shadow, 17th Special Operations Squadron MC-130P Combat Shadow The MC-130P series of aircraft entered service in 1965 during the Vietnam War as HC-130H CROWN airborne controllers to locate downed aircrew and direct Combat Search and Rescue operations over North Vietnam. After tanker equipment was added to 11 HC-130Hs, they entered service as HC-130P SAR command and control/helicopter aerial refueling aircraft in November 1966. Combat Shadows have been part of the Air Force special operations force since 1986. In February 1996, AFSOC's 28-aircraft tanker fleet was redesignated the MC-130P, aligning the variant with other M-series special operations mission aircraft.. USAF continues to field 33 HC-130P/HC-130N dedicated CSAR aircraft as part of Air Combat Command. Combat Shadows provided air refueling support in Panama to Army and Air Force helicopters during Operation Just Cause. In 1990, four Combat Shadows of the 9th Special Operations Squadron deployed to King Fahd International Airport, Saudi Arabia for Desert Storm, and three of the 67th Special Operations Squadron to Batman Air Base, Turkey for Proven Force. Since the Gulf War, the MC-130P has been involved in numerous operations, including Northern Watch and Southern Watch (Iraq), Deny Flight (Yugoslavia), Restore Democracy and Uphold Democracy (Haiti), Deliberate Force and Joint Endeavor (Bosnia), Assured Response (Liberia), Guardian Retrieval (Zaire), Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan) and Iraqi Freedom. The Combat Shadow flew single or multi-ship low-level air refueling missions for special operations helicopters conducting infiltration, exfiltration, and supply missions, with command and control capability in limited situations. The primary emphasis for Combat Shadows was on night operations using NVGs, to reduce probability of visual acquisition and intercept by airborne threats. The last two AFSOC MC-130Ps were retired on May 15, 2015.Air Commandos bid farewell to MC-130P Combat Shadows , Air Force.mil. Retrieved 2016-04-06 However, four MC-130P aircraft continue to be flown by the 129th Rescue Wing (129 RQW) of the California Air National Guard. Although the MC-130P was ostensibly an AFSOC aircraft, the examples still flown by the 129 RQW are part of a rescue squadron assigned to a combat search and rescue/personnel recovery (CSAR / PR) mission and are therefore operationally- gained by the Air Combat Command (ACC) versus AFSOC. These MC-130P aircraft will eventually be replaced by the HC-130J Combat King II. MC-130W Combat Spear MC-130W Combat Spear, AF Ser. No. 87-9286, at Hurlburt Field, Florida 73rd Special Operations Squadron The MC-130W Combat Spear, unofficially and facetiously nicknamed the \\"Combat Wombat\\", performed clandestine or low visibility missions into denied areas to provide aerial refueling to SOF helicopters or to air drop small SOF teams and supply bundles.. The first of 12 MC-130Ws, AF Ser. No. 87-9286, was presented to Air Force Special Operations Command on June 28, 2006. The MC-130Ws were 87-9286 and 9288, 88-1301 through 1308, 88-1051 and 1057. The aircraft was developed to supplement the MC-130 Combat Talon and Combat Shadow forces as an interim measure after several training accidents and contingency losses in supporting the Global War on Terrorism.. The program modified C-130H-2 airframes from the 1987‚Äì1990 production run, acquired from airlift units in the Air Force Reserve Command and Air National Guard. Use of the H-2 airframe allowed installation of SOF systems already configured for Combat Talons without expensive and time-consuming development that would be required of new production C-130J aircraft, reducing the flyaway cost of the Spear to $60 million per aircraft. The Combat Spears, however, do not have a Terrain Following/Terrain Avoidance capability. A standard system of special forces avionics equips the MC-130W: a fully integrated Global Positioning System and Inertial Navigation System, an AN/APN-241 Low Power Color weather/navigation radar; interior and exterior NVG-compatible lighting; advanced threat detection and automated countermeasures, including active infrared countermeasures as well as chaff and flares; upgraded communication suites, including dual satellite communications using data burst transmission to make trackback difficult; aerial refueling capability; and the ability to act as an aerial tanker for helicopters and CV-22 Osprey aircraft using Mk 32B-902E refueling pods. The MC-130Ws were assigned to the 73rd Special Operations Squadron at Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico, with all twelve operational by 2010.. Initially nicknamed the \\"Whiskey\\" (NATO phonetic for the \\"W\\" modifier), the MC-130W was officially dubbed the Combat Spear in May 2007 to honor the historical legacy of the Combat Talons in Vietnam. =MC-130W Dragon Spear= Operational demands on aging AC-130s led the Air Force to seek a replacement until new AC-130Js could enter the fleet.

Air Force Special Operations Command eventually converted all 12 MC-130W aircraft to Dragon Spears. The Dragon Spears were equipped with a Bushmaster II GAU-23/A 30mm gun (an improved version of the MK44 MOD0 30mm gun), sensors, communications systems, and the Gunslinger precision-guided munitions system: a launch tube designed to fire up to 10 GBU-44/B Viper Strike or AGM-176 Griffin small standoff munitions in quick succession.Hambling, David. \\"Spec Ops Shops for 10-pack of precision guided bombs\\" .

MC-130J Commando II A MC-130J modified with winglets takes off from Eglin AFB in March 2016. A cockpit view of the MC-130J Beginning in 1997, studies of the vulnerability of the non-stealthy MC-130 force reflected concerns about its viability in modern high-threat environments, including the prevalence of man-portable air-defense systems in asymmetric conflicts. At least two studies were conducted or proposed to explore the prospect of a replacement aircraft (known variously as \\"MC-X\\" or \\"M-X\\"), with USAF at that time hoping for an Initial Operating Capability date of 2018.\\"MC-X Commando Spirit SOF Future Aircraft\\" , GlobalSecurity.org. Accessed 15 December 2009.US Air Force defines future stealth transport , Jane's.com. Accessed 15 December 2009. One analyst questioned the survivability of slow non-stealthy platforms such as the MC-130 in future threat environments in a 2007 presentation to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and stated his opinion that development of a stealthy replacement for the MC-130 is a \\"strategic priority\\".\\"Stealthy Mobility & Support Aircraft for US Special Operations Forces\\" , by Robert C.

Martinage, then a fellow with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessment think-tank, went to become a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for SOF/low intensity conflict operations. The U.S. Department of Defense's 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review Report also recognized the concern, asserting DoD's intention to \\"enhance capabilities to support SOF insertion and extraction into denied areas from strategic distances.\\", p. 45. Despite these concerns, the USAF decided to proceed with modernization of the current force. The Air Force stated it is to build 37 MC-130Js to replace its MC-130Es and MC-130Ps, both of which were 40 years old. Based on the KC-130J tanker operated by the United States Marine Corps, the new MC-130J has added features for both combat search and rescue and special operations missions,\\"New C-130J Model in Spotlight\\" introducing major modifications to the Block 6.5 KC-130J.

Lockheed Martin also contracted to build an HC-130J tanker variant for Air Force Special Operations Command on its standard C-130J production line. The MC-130J is the first C-130 specifically built for special operations, making it lighter and more efficient. Most special operations aircraft are modified after production to accommodate special operations missions. The MC-130J was initially called the Combat Shadow II to honor the service of the aging MC-130P platform that it was replacing but was officially named the Commando II in March 2012. The Air Force Special Operations Training Center conducted the initial MC-130J training program in conjunction with the Pennsylvania Air National Guard's 193rd Special Operations Wing, using its four EC-130J Commando Solo aircraft to develop the training syllabus for MC-130J aircrew members. The MC-130J operates with a 5-member crew, eliminating the CSO navigator and the enlisted flight engineer positions that had been in the Combat Shadow's crew, with the remaining CSO handling electronic warfare as well as the navigation and aerial refueling duties formerly conducted by the navigator and flight engineer.‚ÄúFirst MC-130J training program takes flight‚Äù by Rachel Arroyo, Air Force Special Operations Command Public Affairs, 01 Mar 2011 The 415th Special Operations Squadron, a unit of the 58th Operations Group at Kirtland AFB, New Mexico, was reactivated on 22 September 2011 as the main training unit for both MC-130J and HC-130J Combat King II crews.

MC-130Js completely replaced Combat Talons at RAF Mildenhall in 2014 and began replacing those at Kadena AB in 2015. 20 were in service in FY 2015 with seven additional airframes in production. On 26 October 2019, MC-130J Commando II special mission aircraft accompanied Joint Special Operations Command 160th SOAR MH-60 and MH-47s, which carried 1st SFOD-D and 75th Ranger RRC operators, into Idlib province during the Barisha raid. Operational losses Between 1967 and 2005, nine MC-130 special operations aircraft have been destroyed in operations, two of them in combat in the Vietnam War, resulting in the deaths of 68 crewmen and passengers: * C-130E(I) / MC-130E Combat Talon I ‚Äì four * MC-130H Combat Talon II ‚Äì four * MC-130P Combat Shadow ‚Äì one =Combat Talon I losses= Two of the four aircraft assigned to Project Stray Goose were lost in combat: 64-0563 was destroyed on November 25, 1967, by a direct hit of a mortar round while parked on the Nha Trang flightline. The aircraft had been scheduled for a mission and had just completed preflight of the exterior when the mission was cancelled. Soon after the crew left the ramp, the aircraft was hit and destroyed by fire.Thigpen (2001), p. 89. 64-0547 was missing-in-action with its entire 11-man crew on December 29, 1967, on a mission to drop leaflets inside North Vietnam. The Blackbird had completed its leaflet drop leg of the mission at and begun its descent to its terrain-following exit altitude. Communication was lost without the Blackbird reporting any threats detected. SOF commanders at the time discounted the possibility of its being shot down because the flight, conducted by an inexperienced aircraft commander under new moon conditions, was not claimed as such by North Vietnam. In November 1992 the wreckage was located near the peak of a mountain northeast of Dien Bien Phu, and it was surmised that its descent was too steep for its TF/TA radar to stabilize. 64-0547 was the only special operations MC-130 lost on a combat mission over hostile terrain in the history of the program.Thigpen (2001), p. 90‚Äì101. 64-0558 was lost in a mid-air collision during a night training exercise 15 miles north of Conway, South Carolina on December 5, 1972. An F-102 Delta Dagger of the South Carolina Air National Guard, attempting a night intercept of the Talon, flew into the fuel drop tank on its right wing, with the loss of both aircraft, killing all 12 aboard the C-130E(I). 64-0558 had been one of the two Talons assigned to the Son Tay POW camp rescue mission.Thigpen (2001), p. 70. The F-102 was AF Ser. No. 56-1517 of the SCANG's 157th Fighter Interceptor Squadron. Former Heavy Chain and Desert One veteran 64-0564 crashed into the ocean shortly after a pre-dawn takeoff from NAS Cubi Point, Philippines, on February 26, 1981, killing 15 passengers and eight of nine crewmen. The Talon was taking part in Special Warfare Exercise 81 and had flown 12 missions in the preceding 16 days. Following an administrative flight the day before, the crew was scheduled for its last mission, a night exercise that was set back from 01:00 local time to 04:30. The flight profile consisted of a normal takeoff, a tactical landing a half hour later to onload 15 Navy SEALs, followed by a tactical takeoff. The Talon reported normal flight conditions six minutes after the tactical takeoff, but crashed nine minutes later. No cause was determined, but investigators found that the likely causes were either crew fatigue from operations tempo, or failure of the terrain following radar to enter \\"override\\" mode while over water.Thigpen (2001), pp. 248‚Äì249. \\"Override\\" shuts down the terrain-following mode when the system fails to receive return signals because of a water surface, enabling normal low altitude warnings to give alarms. =Combat Shadow/Talon II losses= Combat Shadow 66-0213 (Ditka 03) was lost when it flew into a mountain top in eastern Afghanistan on February 13, 2002. Assigned to the 9th SOS, the aircraft was refueling an MH-47E helicopter on a CSAR mission when it was forced to make an emergency climb in poor visibility to escape a box canyon in the mountainous terrain. The MC-130P ran out of climb performance and crash-landed wheels-up in deep snow. The aircraft was a total loss but the crew of eight survived with relatively minor injuries. Combat Talon II 84-0475, assigned to the 15th SOS, was lost in a takeoff crash on June 12, 2002, near Gardez, Afghanistan. During a night exfiltration mission of two Special Forces soldiers from a landing strip at the Sardeh Band dam, the Talon crashed less than three miles from the airstrip shortly after takeoff. Conflicting reports point to overweight cargo and windshear as possible causes. The Talon's two loadmasters and a passenger were killed.Arlington National Cemetery Website: Anissa Ann Shero One of the loadmasters, SSgt Anissa A. (Shuttleworth) Shero, was the first female Talon crew fatality, and the first USAF woman to be killed in Afghanistan. According to Steve Coll in his 2018 book Directorate S, this C-130 was actually blown up by Taliban or Al-Qaeda guerrillas while sitting on a runway. The Pentagon released a false story about the incident to downplay the dangers of Afghanistan. Combat Talon II 90-0161, also of the 15th SOS, crashed into Monte Perucho, south of Caguas, Puerto Rico, during a training mission on August 7, 2002, killing all ten aboard. The Talon was flying a terrain-following night mission in blowing rain and fog, along a low level route commonly used by the Puerto Rico Air National Guard. The crew misinterpreted and disregarded terrain obstacle warnings. Combat Talon II 85-0012 was severely damaged during a landing accident at Mosul, Iraq, on December 29, 2004. The 15th SOS aircraft was on a resupply mission and struck a repair trench dug into the runway while still at 80 knots, shearing off part of its landing gear and partially separating its left wing from the fuselage. The trench was part of a U.S. Army construction project and a Notice To Airmen (NOTAM) warning had not been filed by the airfield or disseminated to the aircrew, despite a safety hazard report filed in the week previous by another aircrew. No fatalities occurred but the aircraft was destroyed by explosive demolition to prevent its classified equipment from being compromised. A Combat Talon II of the 7th SOS, 87-0127 (Wrath 11), crashed during a terrain-following-and-avoidance night training exercise on March 31, 2005, near Rovie, in the Drizez Mountains in southeast Albania, 60 miles southeast of Tirana. The Talon had taken off from Tirana- Rinas Airport 20 minutes before and was one of two flying at AGL at a reduced power setting. An investigation revealed that the plane stalled attempting to clear terrain following the crew's \\"loss of situational awareness.\\" All nine crew members aboard were killed.

He has written a series of best- selling historical mysteries featuring the hard-boiled detective Easy Rawlins, a black private investigator living in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles, California; they are perhaps his most popular works. In 2020, Mosley received the National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, making him the first black male to receive the honor. Personal life Mosley was born in California. His mother, Ella (born Slatkin), was Jewish and worked as a personnel clerk; her ancestors had immigrated from Russia. His father, Leroy Mosley (1924‚Äì1993), was an African American from Louisiana who was a supervising custodian at a Los Angeles public school. He had worked as a clerk in the segregated US army during the Second World War. His parents tried to marry in 1951 but, though the union was legal in California where they were living, no one would give them a marriage license.Walter Mosley Biography; accessed March 3, 2010.PBS interview The Chain Gang, April 6, 2000. Retrieved March 3, 2010. He was an only child and ascribes his writing imagination to \\"an emptiness in my childhood that I filled up with fantasies\\". For $9.50 a week, Walter Mosley attended the Victory Baptist day school, a private African-American elementary school that held pioneering classes in black history. When he was 12, his parents moved from South Central to more comfortably affluent, working-class west LA. He graduated from Alexander Hamilton High School in 1970. Mosley describes his father as a deep thinker and storyteller, a \\"black Socrates\\". His mother encouraged him to read European classics from Dickens and Zola to Camus. He also loves Langston Hughes and Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez. He was largely raised in a non-political family culture, although there were racial conflicts flaring throughout L.A. at the time. He later became more highly politicised and outspoken about racial inequalities in the US, which are a context of much of his fiction. He went through a \\"long-haired hippie\\" phase, drifting around Santa Cruz and Europe. Mosley dropped out of Goddard College, a liberal arts college in Plainfield, Vermont, and then earned a political science degree at Johnson State College. Abandoning a doctorate in political theory, he started work programming computers. He moved to New York in 1981 and met the dancer and choreographer Joy Kellman, whom he married in 1987. They separated 10 years later and were divorced in 2001. While working for Mobil Oil, Mosley took a writing course at City College in Harlem after being inspired by Alice Walker's book, The Color Purple.Johanna Neuman (September‚ÄìOctober 2010) \\"The Curious Case of Walter Mosley\\", Moment Magazine. One of his tutors there, Edna O'Brien, became a mentor to him and encouraged him, saying: \\"You're Black, Jewish, with a poor upbringing; there are riches therein.\\"Walter Mosley biography , Royce Carlton incorporated. Mosley still resides in New York City. Mosley says that he identifies as both African-American and Jewish, with strong feelings for both groups. Career Mosley started writing at 34 and has written every day since, penning more than forty books and often publishing two books a year. He has written in a variety of fiction categories, including mystery and afrofuturist science fiction, as well as non-fiction politics. His work has been translated into 21 languages. His direct inspirations include the detective fiction of Dashiell Hammett, Graham Greene and Raymond Chandler. Mosley's fame increased in 1992 when presidential candidate Bill Clinton, a fan of murder mysteries, named Mosley as one of his favorite authors. Mosley made publishing history in 1997 by foregoing an advance to give the manuscript of Gone Fishin' to a small, independent publisher, Black Classic Press in Baltimore, run by former Black Panther Paul Coates. His first published book, Devil in a Blue Dress, was the basis of a 1995 movie starring Denzel Washington, and the following year a 10-part abridgement of the novel by Margaret Busby, read by Paul Winfield, was broadcast on BBC Radio 4. The world premiere of Mosley's first play, The Fall of Heaven, was staged at the Playhouse in the Park, Cincinnati, Ohio, in January 2010. Mosley has served on the board of directors of the National Book Awards. Mosley is on the board of the TransAfrica Forum. In 2010, there was a debate in academic literary circles as to whether Mosley's work should be considered Jewish literature. Similar debate has occurred as to whether he should be described as a black author, given his status as a best-selling writer. Mosley has said that he prefers to be called a novelist. He explains his desire to write about \\"black male heroes\\" saying \\"hardly anybody in America has written about black male heroes... There are black male protagonists and black male supporting characters, but nobody else writes about black male heroes.\\" In 2019, after working in the writers room for the series Snowfall, Mosley was hired by Alex Kurtzman for a similar role on the third season of Star Trek: Discovery. After working on the series for three weeks, Mosley was notified by CBS of a complaint made against him by another member of the writers room for Mosley's use of the word \\"nigger\\" while telling a story. CBS told Mosley this was usually a fireable offence, but said no further action would be taken and asked that he not use the word again outside of a script. Mosley chose to leave the series, quitting without informing Kurtzman and Paradise and explaining his decision in an op-ed for The New York Times in September 2019.

Overseen by the Scottish Examination Board (SEB), it was taken by students in their sixth year (final year) of secondary education (ages 16‚Äì18) and was available for a range of different subjects. Examinations were administered by the SEB (and latterly by its successor, the Scottish Qualifications Authority, which absorbed and replaced it eventually). Unlike the Standard and Higher Grade examinations, it was not a part of the Scottish Certificate of Education. The CSYS followed on from Higher Grade examinations and was considered broadly equivalent to the English A-Level qualification. However, it never quite gained the same level of universal recognition as the Higher or A-Level. In particular, universities rarely used it when considering potential students. The academic demands placed on students by these examinations were the highest of the Scottish secondary school examination system at that time. One important and distinguishing feature of the CSYS examinations was the inclusion of a dissertation and/or viva examination conducted by a visiting external examiner. The CSYS was replaced by the Advanced Higher examinations in 2000.

The term has been used since, including in a question posed to Bill Clinton in 2009 to describe verbal attacks on Barack Obama during his early presidency. Hillary Clinton mentioned it again during her 2016 presidential campaign. Earlier uses While popularized by Mrs. Clinton in her 1998 TODAY Show interview, the phrase did not originate with her. In 1991 the Detroit News wrote: An Associated Press story in 1995 also used the phrase, relating an official's guess that the Oklahoma City bombing was the work of \\"maybe five malcontents\\" and not \\"some kind of vast right-wing conspiracy.\\" 1995 memo A 332-page memo titled \\"Communication Stream of Conspiracy Commerce\\" was commissioned by Mark Fabiani and written by Chris Lehane in 1995. It was the first document to describe the conspiracies surrounding the Clintons, which Hillary Clinton later popularized with the term \\"vast right-wing conspiracy.\\" It described how online conservative media outlets such as The American Spectator spread conspiracy theories about the suicide of Vince Foster, the Whitewater controversy, and other events. According to the memo, these conspiracies spread from conservative think tanks to British tabloids, and then to the mainstream press. The Today Show interview In response to ongoing accusations surrounding the Clintons' investment in a real estate development known as Whitewater in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Clinton's Attorney General Janet Reno had appointed an independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, to investigate those accusations in 1994. Starr's investigation began to branch out into other issues, from Filegate to Travelgate to Bill Clinton's actions in the civil case of his alleged sexual harassment of Paula Jones prior to his presidency. In the course of the last of these, White House intern Monica Lewinsky signed an affidavit that she had not had a relationship with Clinton, but Lewinsky's confidant Linda Tripp had been recording their phone conversations and offered Starr tapes of Lewinsky describing her feelings for, and alleging intimate encounters with, the president. The president was asked to give a deposition, and accusations that he lied about an affair under oath first made national headlines on January 17, 1998, when the story was picked up by the conservative-right e-mail newsletter The Drudge Report. Despite swift denials from President Clinton, the media attention grew. On January 27, 1998, Hillary Clinton appeared on NBC's The Today Show, in an interview with Matt Lauer. Clinton elaborated by decrying the tactics \\"and the kind of intense political agenda at work here\\". Bob Woodward recounts in his book The Agenda (1994) that the then-first lady claimed that when her husband was making his decision to run for the presidency in 1991, he reported receiving \\"a direct threat from someone in the Bush White House, warning that if he ran, the Republicans would go after him. 'We will do everything we can to destroy you personally,' she recalled that the Bush White House man had said.\\" Later uses David Brock, a conservative-turned-liberal author, has said he was once a part of an effort to dredge up a scandal against Clinton. In 1993 Brock, then of the American Spectator, was the first to report Paula Jones' claims. As Brock explained in Blinded by the Right, after learning more about the events and conservative payments surrounding Paula Jones he personally apologized to the Clintons. He documented his experience in Blinded by the Right: The Conscience of an Ex-Conservative, wherein he alleged that Arkansas state troopers had taken money in exchange for testimony against Clinton which Brock had published in a previous book. Adam Curtis also discusses the concept in his documentary series The Power of Nightmares. Brock has agreed with Clinton's claim that there was a \\"Right wing conspiracy\\" to smear her husband, quibbling only with the characterization of it as \\"vast\\", since Brock contends that it was orchestrated mainly by a few powerful people. MSNBC also described the comment as once-ridiculed but now taken more seriously by \\"many Democrats\\" who point \\"to the well-documented efforts by conservative financier Richard Mellon Scaife to fund a network of anti-Clinton investigations.\\" Specific claims of such funding have been made against conservative Republican supporter and billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife.Media Transparency, Aggregated Grants from the Scaife Foundations. Scaife played a major role in funding the Arkansas Project investigating President Clinton; former Clinton White House Counsel Lanny Davis claimed Scaife was using his money \\"to destroy a president of the United States.\\" Scaife claims to be public about his political spending (q.v.). CNN stated in a study the news outlet conducted on Scaife, \\"If it's a conspiracy, it's a pretty open one.\\" Hillary Clinton wrote in her 2003 autobiography, \\"Looking back, I see that I might have phrased my point more artfully, but I stand by the characterization of Starr's investigation [regardless of the truth about Lewinsky].\\"Living History, p. 446. By 2007 her experiences caused Hillary Clinton to say in presidential campaign appearances that the vast right-wing conspiracy was back, citing such cases as the 2002 New Hampshire Senate election phone jamming scandal.Clinton: Vast right-wing conspiracy is back, NBC News/AP, March 13, 2007 On the stump for Al Franken's 2008 Senate campaign, Bill Clinton acknowledged his Air America Radio show by quipping that he had been taking on the \\"vast right wing conspiracy before others even acknowledged that it existed\\". Former President Clinton, when asked on Meet the Press (September 27, 2009) whether the vast right wing conspiracy was involved in the attacks on President Barack Obama, said \\"Oh, you bet. Sure it is. It's not as strong as it was, because America's changed demographically, but it's as virulent as it was ... when they accused me of murder and all that stuff.\\"Meet the Press, 21 Sept. 2009, transcript Two other figures who have used the phrase are Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman and journalist Joe Conason. Conason, in an article called \\"The vast right-wing conspiracy is back,\\" refers the National Republican Trust PAC and Newsmax Media, which are run by former foes of Bill Clinton and who made attacks on then-President Barack Obama. The National Republican Trust PAC sponsored a campaign commercials against Obama in 2008 which FactCheck.org described as \\"one of the sleaziest false TV ads of the campaign.\\" One of Newsmax Media's owners \\"was among the most insistent endorsers of the Obama birth certificate myth\\" and a popularizer of the canard that Bill Clinton's White House counsel Vince Foster did not commit suicide‚Äîas determined by five official investigations‚Äîbut was murdered.The vast right-wing conspiracy is back. Salon.com Oct 5, 2009 In some of his books, Krugman has used the phrase (\\"Yes, Virginia, there is a vast right-wing conspiracy\\") to refer not to a conservative Republican-leaning campaign against Clinton (or Obama), but more generally to \\"an interlocking set of institutions ultimately answering to a small group of people that collectively reward loyalists and punish dissenters\\" in the service of \\"movement conservatism.\\" The network of institutions provide > obedient politicians with the resources to win elections, safe havens in the > event of defeat, and lucrative career opportunities after they leave office. > They guarantee favorable news coverage to politicians who follow the party > line, while harassing and undermining opponents. And they support a large > standing army of party intellectuals and activists. In Krugman's view, the network of foundations that fund conservative scholarship, the national and regional think tanks and advocacy groups, talk radio media outlets, and conservative law firms through which they pushed their agenda to move the Republican Party to the right, far surpass in funding, size, inter-connectedness or influence anything the Democratic Party or the American political left/liberal movement have at their disposal. 2014 reemergence In April 2014, the Clinton Presidential Center published the original 1995 memo on the conspiracy. The memo's author, Chris Lehane, wrote, \\"As for the premise of the memo, I absolutely stand by it. Not only was it right about the right wing then, it is more accurate than ever today.\\" 2016 reemergence In 2016, Hillary Clinton said she still believed in the \\"vast right-wing conspiracy\\", adding that it was \\"even better funded\\" 18 years later. However, she opined, \\"At this point it's probably not correct to say it's a conspiracy because it's out in the open.\\" In October, after footage of Donald Trump boasting about his sexual exploits emerged and multiple women accused Trump of sexual misconduct, Melania Trump defended her husband and said, \\"This was all organized from the opposition.\\" Writers for the Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post noted that Melania's response \\"echoed\\" Hillary's original use of the phrase \\"vast right-wing conspiracy.\\" Use in popular culture After the release of a deposition Bill Clinton had given to the Independent Counsel in which he perjured himself, some conservatives began to adopt the VRWC phrasing ironically. In 2004, conservative lawyer Mark W. Smith wrote the New York Times Best Seller Official Handbook of the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy, which came with a \\"membership card\\" that made its owner an \\"official member of the VRWC.\\" Similarly, a number of newspaper, magazine, and website articles have used the phrase to report on left-wing politics. Eugene Volokh's blog The Volokh Conspiracy is said to have derived its name from as a reference to the \\"Vast right-wing conspiracy\\" statement. The term \\"Vast Right Wing Conspiracy\\" continues to be mocked by conservatives.

It was formed to provide both technical and social support for women Linux users, although men are encouraged to contribute.\\"LinuxChix is a community for women who like Linux and Free Software, and for women and men who want to support women in computing. The membership ranges from novices to experienced users, and includes professional and amateur programmers, system administrators and technical writers.\\" - Members of the community are referred to as \\"a Linux chick\\" (singular) and \\"LinuxChix\\" or \\"Linux Chix\\" (plural) regardless of gender.  History  LinuxChix was founded in 1999 by Deb Richardson, who was a technical writer and web-master at an open source consulting firm. Her reason for founding LinuxChix was to create an alternative to the \\"locker room mentality\\" of some other Linux User Groups and forums. There are two core rules: \\"be polite and be helpful.\\" LinuxChix started as an electronic mailing list called grrltalk. The growth of this mailing list led to the establishment of other mailing lists, beginning with techtalk for technical discussions and issues for discussion of women's political issues. LinuxChix received attention when ZDNet published an article on it, which was subsequently cross- posted on Slashdot.  Leadership and structure  Deb Richardson oversaw the activities of LinuxChix until 2001, when she handed over global coordination and hosting to Melbourne programmer and writer Jenn Vesperman. Jenn Vesperman led the community in a mostly hands-off fashion, delegating almost all tasks, including mailing list administration and website maintenance, to a group of volunteers. During Jenn Vesperman's tenure, the number of mailing lists tripled with the newchix mailing list for those new to Linux, the courses mailing list used by LinuxChix to teach each other specific topics, and the grrls-only mailing list (the only list closed to male subscribers) founded by Val Henson in 2002. At around the same time, a LinuxChix IRC server was created. The term LinuxChix refers to the organisation centered on the official website, the mailing lists and the IRC channels. The organisation has no official status, and the name is used by other loosely affiliated groups, including several local, continental, and national chapters which operate independently. In March 2007, Jenn Vesperman announced that she was retiring as the coordinator and invited nominations for a new leader.Time for a new LinuxChix coordinator Mary Gardiner was announced as the new coordinator In April 2007, planning to serve as coordinator until 2009, however she resigned in June 2007. Currently the organization is led by three lead volunteers known as the \\"Tres Chix\\" who are elected by popular vote. In August 2007, Sulamita Garcia, Akkana Peck and Carla Schroder were elected to these positions.  Regional chapters  LinuxChix has over 15 regional chapters around the world. In 2004, a chapter was founded in Africa. In March 2007, on the International Women's Day, Australia's two LinuxChix chapters united to form a nationwide chapter called \\"AussieChix\\". The New Zealand chapter was established in February 2007.  Events  Some local LinuxChix chapters hold regular meetings. Others only meet up on special occasions, such as visits from non- local members or in conjunction with technical conferences. In 2007, members of the Sydney chapter organized a LinuxChix miniconf at linux.conf.au at the University of New South Wales.Women flock to Linux talkfest, Original proposalPortrait: LinuxChix Brazil's Sulamita Garcia Events are held on other special occasions; in 2005, for example, LinuxChix Africa organized an event to celebrate Software Freedom Day at Wits University.Open source message hits Wits University =LinuxChix labs= The Indian chapter of LinuxChix (aka IndiChix) led an initiative to establish Linux labs in a number of cities in India.

BDNF is a member of the neurotrophin family of growth factors, which are related to the canonical nerve growth factor. Neurotrophic factors are found in the brain and the periphery. BDNF was first isolated from pig brain in 1982 by Yves-Alain Barde and Hans Thoenen.  Function  BDNF acts on certain neurons of the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system, helping to support survival of existing neurons, and encouraging growth and differentiation of new neurons and synapses. In the brain, it is active in the hippocampus, cortex, and basal forebrain‚Äîareas vital to learning, memory, and higher thinking. BDNF is also expressed in the retina, kidneys, prostate, motor neurons and skeletal muscle and it is also found in saliva. BDNF itself is important for long-term memory. Although the vast majority of neurons in the mammalian brain are formed prenatally, parts of the adult brain retain the ability to grow new neurons from neural stem cells in a process known as neurogenesis. Neurotrophins are proteins that help to stimulate and control neurogenesis, BDNF being one of the most active. Mice born without the ability to make BDNF suffer developmental defects in the brain and sensory nervous system, and usually die soon after birth, suggesting that BDNF plays an important role in normal neural development. Other important neurotrophins structurally related to BDNF include NT-3, NT-4, and NGF. BDNF is made in the endoplasmic reticulum and secreted from dense-core vesicles. It binds carboxypeptidase E (CPE), and the disruption of this binding has been proposed to cause the loss of sorting of BDNF into dense-core vesicles. The phenotype for BDNF knockout mice can be severe, including postnatal lethality. Other traits include sensory neuron losses that affect coordination, balance, hearing, taste, and breathing. Knockout mice also exhibit cerebellar abnormalities and an increase in the number of sympathetic neurons.MGI database: phenotypes for BDNF homozygous null mice. http://www.informatics.jax.org/searches/allele_report.cgi?_Marker_key=537‚à´:_Set_key=847156 Certain types of physical exercise have been shown to markedly (threefold) increase BDNF synthesis in the human brain, a phenomenon which is partly responsible for exercise-induced neurogenesis and improvements in cognitive function. Niacin appears to upregulate BDNF and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) expression as well.  Mechanism of action  BDNF binds at least two receptors on the surface of cells that are capable of responding to this growth factor, TrkB (pronounced \\"Track B\\") and the LNGFR (for low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor, also known as p75). It may also modulate the activity of various neurotransmitter receptors, including the Alpha-7 nicotinic receptor. BDNF has also been shown to interact with the reelin signaling chain.; see the chapter \\"A Tale of Two Genes: Reelin and BDNF\\"; pp. 237‚Äì45 The expression of reelin by Cajal‚ÄìRetzius cells goes down during development under the influence of BDNF. The latter also decreases reelin expression in neuronal culture. = TrkB = The TrkB receptor is encoded by the NTRK2 gene and is member of a receptor family of tyrosine kinases that includes TrkA and TrkC. TrkB autophosphorylation is dependent upon its ligand- specific association with BDNF, a widely expressed activity-dependent neurotic factor that regulates plasticity and is unregulated following hypoxic injury. The activation of the BDNF-TrkB pathway is important in the development of short-term memory and the growth of neurons. = LNGFR = The role of the other BDNF receptor, p75, is less clear. While the TrkB receptor interacts with BDNF in a ligand-specific manner, all neurotrophins can interact with the p75 receptor. When the p75 receptor is activated, it leads to activation of NFkB receptor. Thus, neurotrophic signaling may trigger apoptosis rather than survival pathways in cells expressing the p75 receptor in the absence of Trk receptors. Recent studies have revealed a truncated isoform of the TrkB receptor (t-TrkB) may act as a dominant negative to the p75 neurotrophin receptor, inhibiting the activity of p75, and preventing BDNF-mediated cell death.  Expression  The BDNF protein is encoded by a gene that is also called BDNF, found in humans on chromosome 11. Structurally, BDNF transcription is controlled by 8 different promoters, each leading to different transcripts containing one of 8 untranslated 5‚Äô exons (I to VIII) spliced to the 3‚Äô encoding exon. Promoter IV activity, leading to the translation of exon IV-containing mRNA, is strongly stimulated by calcium and is primarily under the control of a Cre regulatory component, suggesting a putative role for the transcription factor CREB and the source of BDNF's activity-dependent effects . There are multiple mechanisms through neuronal activity can increase BDNF exon IV specific expression. Stimulus-mediated neuronal excitation can lead to NMDA receptor activation, triggering a calcium influx. Through a protein signaling cascade requiring Erk, CaM KII/IV, PI3K, and PLC, NMDA receptor activation is capable of triggering BDNF exon IV transcription. BDNF exon IV expression also seems capable of further stimulating its own expression through TrkB activation. BDNF is released from the post-synaptic membrane in an activity-dependent manner, allowing it to act on local TrkB receptors and mediate effects that can leading to signaling cascades also involving Erk and CaM KII/IV. Both of these pathways probably involve calcium-mediated phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133, thus allowing it to interact with BDNF's Cre regulatory domain and upregulate transcription. However, NMDA-mediated receptor signaling is probably necessary to trigger the upregulation of BDNF exon IV expression because normally CREB interaction with CRE and the subsequent translation of the BDNF transcript is blocked by of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor protein 2 (BHLHB2). NMDA receptor activation triggers the release of the regulatory inhibitor, allowing for BDNF exon IV upregulation to take place in response to the activity-initiated calcium influx. Activation of Dopamine receptor D5 also promotes expression of BDNF in prefrontal cortex neurons.  Common SNPs in BDNF gene  BDNF has several known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), including, but not limited to, rs6265, C270T, rs7103411, rs2030324, rs2203877, rs2049045 and rs7124442. As of 2008, rs6265 is the most investigated SNP of the BDNF gene = Val66Met = A common SNP in the BDNF gene is rs6265. This point mutation in the coding sequence, a guanine to adenine switch at position 196, results in an amino acid switch: valine to methionine exchange at codon 66, Val66Met, which is in the prodomain of BDNF. Val66Met is unique to humans. The mutation interferes with normal translation and intracellular trafficking of BDNF mRNA, as it destabilizes the mRNA and renders it prone to degradation. The proteins resulting from mRNA that does get translated, are not trafficked and secreted normally, as the amino acid change occurs on the portion of the prodomain where sortilin binds; and sortilin is essential for normal trafficking. The Val66Met mutation results in a reduction of hippocampal tissue and has since been reported in a high number of individuals suffering from learning and memory disorders, anxiety disorders, major depression, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. A meta-analysis indicates that the BDNF Val66Met variant is not associated with serum BDNF.  Role in synaptic transmission  = Glutamatergic signaling = Glutamate is the brain's major excitatory neurotransmitter and its release can trigger the depolarization of postsynaptic neurons. AMPA and NMDA receptors are two ionotropic glutamate receptors involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission and essential to learning and memory via long-term potentiation. While AMPA receptor activation leads to depolarization via sodium influx, NMDA receptor activation by rapid successive firing allows calcium influx in addition to sodium. The calcium influx triggered through NMDA receptors can lead to expression of BDNF, as well as other genes thought to be involved in LTP, dendritogenesis, and synaptic stabilization.  NMDA receptor activity  NMDA receptor activation is essential to producing the activity-dependent molecular changes involved in the formation of new memories. Following exposure to an enriched environment, BDNF and NR1 phosphorylation levels are upregulated simultaneously, probably because BDNF is capable of phosphorylating NR1 subunits, in addition to its many other effects. One of the primary ways BDNF can modulate NMDA receptor activity is through phosphorylation and activation of the NMDA receptor one subunit, particularly at the PKC Ser-897 site. The mechanism underlying this activity is dependent upon both ERK and PKC signaling pathways, each acting individually, and all NR1 phosphorylation activity is lost if the TrKB receptor is blocked. PI3 kinase and Akt are also essential in BDNF-induced potentiation of NMDA receptor function and inhibition of either molecule completely eliminated receptor acBDNF can also increase NMDA receptor activity through phosphorylation of the NR2B subunit. BDNF signaling leads to the autophosphorylation of the intracellular domain of the TrkB receptor (ICD- TrkB). Upon autophosphorylation, Fyn associates with the pICD-TrkB through its Src homology domain 2 (SH2) and is phosphorylated at its Y416 site. Once activated, Fyn can bind to NR2B through its SH2 domain and mediate phosphorylation of its Tyr-1472 site. Similar studies have suggested Fyn is also capable of activating NR2A although this was not found in the hippocampus. Thus, BDNF can increase NMDA receptor activity through Fyn activation. This has been shown to be important for processes such as spatial memory in the hippocampus, demonstrating the therapeutic and functional relevance of BDNF-mediated NMDA receptor activation.  Synapse stability  In addition to mediating transient effects on NMDAR activation to promote memory-related molecular changes, BDNF should also initiate more stable effects that could be maintained in its absence and not depend on its expression for long term synaptic support. It was previously mentioned that AMPA receptor expression is essential to learning and memory formation, as these are the components of the synapse that will communicate regularly and maintain the synapse structure and function long after the initial activation of NMDA channels. BDNF is capable of increasing the mRNA expression of GluR1 and GluR2 through its interaction with the TrkB receptor and promoting the synaptic localization of GluR1 via PKC- and CaMKII-mediated Ser-831 phosphorylation. It also appears that BDNF is able to influence Gl1 activity through its effects on NMDA receptor activity. BDNF significantly enhanced the activation of GluR1 through phosphorylation of tyrosine830, an effect that was abolished in either the presence of a specific NR2B antagonist or a trk receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Thus, it appears BDNF can upregulate the expression and synaptic localization of AMPA receptors, as well as enhance their activity through its postsynaptic interactions with the NR2B subunit. This suggests BDNF is not only capable of initiating synapse formation through its effects on NMDA receptor activity, but it can also support the regular every-day signaling necessary for stable memory function. = GABAergic signaling = One mechanism through which BDNF appears to maintain elevated levels of neuronal excitation is through preventing GABAergic signaling activities. While glutamate is the brain's major excitatory neurotransmitter and phosphorylation normally activates receptors, GABA is the brain's primary inhibitory neurotransmitter and phosphorylation of GABAA receptors tend to reduce their activity. Blockading BDNF signaling with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor or a PKC inhibitor in wild type mice produced significant reductions in spontaneous action potential frequencies that were mediated by an increase in the amplitude of GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSC). Similar effects could be obtained in BDNF knockout mice, but these effects were reversed by local application of BDNF. This suggests BDNF increases excitatory synaptic signaling partly through the post-synaptic suppression of GABAergic signaling by activating PKC through its association with TrkB. Once activated, PKC can reduce the amplitude of IPSCs through to GABAA receptor phosphorylation and inhibition. In support of this putative mechanism, activation of PKCŒµ leads to phosphorylation of N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) at serine 460 and threonine 461, increasing its ATPase activity which downregulates GABAA receptor surface expression and subsequently attenuates inhibitory currents. = Synaptogenesis = BDNF also enhances synaptogenesis. Synaptogenesis is dependent upon the assembly of new synapses and the disassembly of old synapses by Œ≤-adducin. Adducins are membrane- skeletal proteins that cap the growing ends of actin filaments and promote their association with spectrin, another cytoskeletal protein, to create stable and integrated cytoskeletal networks. Actins have a variety of roles in synaptic functioning. In pre-synaptic neurons, actins are involved in synaptic vesicle recruitment and vesicle recovery following neurotransmitter release. In post-synaptic neurons they can influence dendritic spine formation and retraction as well as AMPA receptor insertion and removal. At their C-terminus, adducins possess a myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) domain which regulates their capping activity. BDNF can reduce capping activities by upregulating PKC, which can bind to the adducing MRCKS domain, inhibit capping activity, and promote synaptogenesis through dendritic spine growth and disassembly and other activities. = Dendritogenesis = Local interaction of BDNF with the TrkB receptor on a single dendritic segment is able to stimulate an increase in PSD-95 trafficking to other separate dendrites as well as to the synapses of locally stimulated neurons. PSD-95 localizes the actin-remodeling GTPases, Rac and Rho, to synapses through the binding of its PDZ domain to kalirin, increasing the number and size of spines. Thus, BDNF-induced trafficking of PSD-95 to dendrites stimulates actin remodeling and causes dendritic growth in response to BDNF.  Neurogenesis  BDNF plays a significant role in neurogenesis. BDNF can promote protective pathways and inhibit damaging pathways in the NSCs and NPCs that contribute to the brain's neurogenic response by enhancing cell survival. This becomes especially evident following suppression of TrkB activity. TrkB inhibition results in a 2‚Äì3 fold increase in cortical precursors displaying EGFP-positive condensed apoptotic nuclei and a 2‚Äì4 fold increase in cortical precursors that stained immunopositive for cleaved caspase-3. BDNF can also promote NSC and NPC proliferation through Akt activation and PTEN inactivation. There have been many in vivo studies demonstrating BDNF is a strong promoter of neuronal differentiation. Infusion of BDNF into the lateral ventricles doubled the population of newborn neurons in the adult rat olfactory bulb and viral overexpression of BDNF can similarly enhance SVZ neurogenesis. BDNF might also play a role in NSC/NPC migration. By stabilizing p35 (CDK5R1), in utero electroporation studies revealed BDNF was able to promote cortical radial migration by ~230% in embryonic rats, an effect which was dependent on the activity of the trkB receptor.  Cognitive function  Enriched housing provides the opportunity for exercise and exposure to multimodal stimuli. The increased visual, physical, and cognitive stimulation all translates into more neuronal activity and synaptic communication, which can produce structural or molecular activity-dependent alterations. Sensory inputs from environmental stimuli are initially processed by the cortex before being transmitted to the hippocampus along an afferent pathway, suggesting the activity-mediated effects of enrichment can be far-reaching within the brain. BDNF expression is significantly enhanced by environmental enrichment and appears to be the primary source of the ability of environmental enrichments to enhance cognitive processes. Environmental enrichment enhances synaptogenesis, dendridogenesis, and neurogenesis, leading to improved performance on various learning and memory tasks. BDNF mediates more pathways involved in these enrichment-induced processes than any other molecule and is strongly regulated by calcium activity making it incredibly sensitive to neuronal activity.  Disease linkage  Various studies have shown possible links between BDNF and conditions, such as depression, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Rett syndrome, and dementia, as well as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. Increased levels of BDNF can induce a change to an opiate-dependent-like reward state when expressed in the ventral tegmental area in rats. As of 2002 clinical trials in which BDNF was delivered into the central nervous system (CNS) of humans with various neurodegenerative disease had all failed. = Schizophrenia = A plethora of recent evidence suggests the linkage between schizophrenia and BDNF. Given that BDNF is critical for the survival of central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) neurons and synaptogenesis during and even after development, BDNF alterations may play a role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. BDNF has been found within many areas of the brain and plays an important role in supporting the formation of memories. It has been shown that BDNF mRNA levels are decreased in cortical layers IV and V of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of schizophrenic patients, an area that is known to be involved with working memory. Since schizophrenic patients often suffer from impairments in working memory, and BDNF mRNA levels have been shown to be decreased in the DLPFC of schizophrenic patients, it is highly likely that BDNF plays some role in the etiology of this neurodevelopmental disorder of the CNS. = Depression = Exposure to stress and the stress hormone corticosterone has been shown to decrease the expression of BDNF in rats, and, if exposure is persistent, this leads to an eventual atrophy of the hippocampus. Atrophy of the hippocampus and other limbic structures has been shown to take place in humans suffering from chronic depression. In addition, rats bred to be heterozygous for BDNF, therefore reducing its expression, have been observed to exhibit similar hippocampal atrophy. This suggests that an etiological link between the development of depression and BDNF exists. Supporting this, the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, voluntary exercise, caloric restriction, intellectual stimulation, and various treatments for depression such as antidepressants increase expression of BDNF in the brain. There is evidence that antidepressant drugs protect against or reverse hippocampal atrophy. = Alzheimer's disease = Post mortem analysis has shown lowered levels of BDNF in the brain tissues of people with Alzheimer's disease, although the nature of the connection remains unclear. Studies suggest that neurotrophic factors have a protective role against amyloid beta toxicity. = Epilepsy = Epilepsy has also been linked with polymorphisms in BDNF. Given BDNF's vital role in the development of the landscape of the brain, there is quite a lot of room for influence on the development of neuropathologies from BDNF. Levels of both BDNF mRNA and BDNF protein are known to be up-regulated in epilepsy. BDNF modulates excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission by inhibiting GABAA-receptor-mediated post-synaptic currents. This provides a potential mechanism for the observed up-regulation. = Aging = BDNF levels appear to be highly regulated throughout the lifetime both in the early developmental stages and in the later stages of life. For example, BDNF appears to be critical for the morphological development such as dendrite orientation and number along with soma size. This is important as neuron morphology is critical in behavioral processes like learning and motor skills development. Research has reported that the interaction between BDNF and TrkB (the receptor to BDNF) is highly important in inducing dendritic growth; some have noted that the phosphorylation of TrkB by another molecule, cdk5 is necessary for this interaction to occur. Thus, high BDNF and active TrkB interaction appears to be necessary during a critical developmental period as it is regulatory in neuron morphology. Although BDNF is needed in the developmental stages, BDNF levels have been shown to decrease in tissues with aging. Studies using human subjects have found that hippocampal volume decreases with decreasing plasma levels of BDNF. Although this does not mean BDNF necessarily impacts hippocampal volume, it does suggest there is a relationship that might explain some of the cognitive decline that occurs during aging. = Miscellaneous = BDNF is a critical mediator of vulnerability to stress, memory of fear/trauma, and stress-related disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder. Variants close to the BDNF gene were found to be associated with obesity in two very large genome-wide association studies of body mass index (BMI). High levels of BDNF and Substance P have been associated with increased itching in eczema. BDNF is a regulator of drug addiction and psychological dependence. Animals chronically exposed to drugs of abuse show increased levels of BDNF in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the brain, and when BDNF is injected directly into the VTA of rats, the animals act as if they are addicted to and psychologically dependent upon opiates. BDNF is a short-term promoter, but a long-term inhibitor of pain sensitivity, as a result of its effect as inducer of neuronal differentiation. The polymorphism Thr2Ile may be linked to congenital central hypoventilation syndrome. BDNF and IL-6 might be involved in the pathogenesis of post-chemotherapy cognitive impairment (PCCI, also known as chemo brain) and fatigue.

In military tactics, close air support (CAS) is defined as air action such as air strikes by fixed or rotary-winged aircraft against hostile targets that are in proximity to friendly forces and which requires detailed integration of each air mission with fire and movement of these forces and attacks with aerial bombs, glide bombs, missiles, rockets, aircraft cannons, machine guns, and even directed-energy weapons such as lasers.Close Air Support. United States Department of Defense, 2014. The requirement for detailed integration because of proximity, fires or movement is the determining factor. CAS may need to be conducted during shaping operations with Special Operations Forces (SOF) if the mission requires detailed integration with the fire and movement of these forces. A closely related subset of air interdiction (AI), battlefield air interdiction, denotes interdiction against units with near-term effects on friendly units, but which does not require integration with friendly troop movements. The term \\"battlefield air interdiction\\" is not currently used in U.S. joint doctrine. CAS requires excellent coordination with ground forces; in advanced modern militaries, this coordination is typically handled by specialists such as Joint Fires Observers (JFOs), Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTACs), and forward air controllers (FACs). The First World War was the first conflict to make extensive use of CAS, albeit using relatively primitive methods in contrast to later warfare. Even so, it was clear that coordination between aerial and ground forces via radio communication typically made such attacks more effective. Appropriately modified, the British F.E 2b fighter became the first ground-attack aircraft, while Germany produced the first purpose built ground attack aircraft in the form of the Junkers J.I; the Sopwith Camel was another successful early platform. Both the Sinai and Palestine Campaign and the Spring Offensive of 1918 made extensive use of CAS aircraft. The interwar period saw CAS doctrine continue to advance, although theorists and aviators would often clash over its strategic value. Several different conflicts, including the Russo-Polish War, the Spanish Civil War, colonial wars in the Middle East and the Gran Chaco War, were noticeably impacted by CAS operations. The Second World War marked the universal acceptance of the integration of air power into combined arms warfare. Although the German Luftwaffe was the only force to use CAS at the start of the war, all the major combatants had developed effective air-ground coordination techniques by the conflict's end. New techniques, such as the use of forward air control to guide CAS aircraft and identifying invasion stripes, also emerged at this time, being heavily shaped by the Italian Campaign and the invasion of Normandy. CAS practices continued to advance in further conflicts, including the Korean War and the Vietnam War; major milestones including the introduction of attack helicopters and the creation of aerial gunships, such as the Bell AH-1 Cobra and the Douglas AC-47 Spooky. While many CAS aircraft have been propeller driven, several jet aircraft, such as the A-10 Thunderbolt II (Warthog) and the Su-25 (Frogfoot), have been developed as well. History =First World War= The use of aircraft in the close air support of ground forces dates back to the First World War, the first conflict to make significant military use of aerial forces.Hallion (1990), Airpower Journal, p. 8. Air warfare, and indeed aviation itself, was still in its infancy‚Äîand the direct effect of rifle caliber machine guns and light bombs of the First World War aircraft was very limited compared with the power of (for instance) an average fighter bomber of the Second World War, but CAS aircraft were still able to achieve a powerful psychological impact. The aircraft was a visible and personal enemy‚Äîunlike artillery‚Äîpresenting a personal threat to enemy troops, while providing friendly forces assurance that their superiors were concerned about their situation. The most successful attacks of 1917‚Äì1918 had included planning for co-ordination between aerial and ground units, although it was relatively difficult at this early date to co-ordinate these attacks due to the primitive nature of air-to-ground radio communication. Though most air-power proponents sought independence from ground commanders and hence pushed the importance of interdiction and strategic bombing, they nonetheless recognized the need for close air support.House (2001), Combined Arms Warfare. F.E 2d was one of the first aircraft to be used for close air support in 1917 (the observer is demonstrating the use of the rear-firing Lewis gun). From the commencement of hostilities in 1914, aviators engaged in sporadic and spontaneous attacks on ground forces, but it was not until 1916 that an air support doctrine was elaborated and dedicated fighters for the job were put into service. By that point, the startling and demoralizing effect that attack from the air could have on the troops in the trenches had been made clear. At the Battle of the Somme, 18 British armed reconnaissance planes strafed the enemy trenches after conducting surveillance operations. The success of this improvised assault spurred innovation on both sides. In 1917, following the Second Battle of the Aisne, the British debuted the first ground-attack aircraft, a modified F.E 2b fighter carrying bombs and mounted machine-guns. After exhausting their ammunition, the planes returned to base for refueling and rearming before returned to the battle-zone. Other modified planes used in this role were the Airco DH.5 and Sopwith Camel‚Äîthe latter was particularly successful in this role. Aircraft support was first integrated into a battle plan on a large scale at the 1917 Battle of Cambrai, where a significantly larger number of tanks were deployed than previously. By that time, effective anti-aircraft tactics were being used by the enemy infantry and pilot casualties were high, although air support was later judged as having been of a critical importance in places where the infantry had got pinned down. At this time, British doctrine came to recognize two forms of air support; trench strafing (the modern-day doctrine of CAS), and ground strafing (the modern-day doctrine of air interdiction)‚Äîattacking tactical ground targets away from the land battle. As well as strafing with machine-guns, planes engaged in such operations were commonly modified with bomb racks; the plane would fly in very low to the ground and release the bombs just above the trenches. The Junkers J.I, a First World War German ground-attack aircraft The Germans were also quick to adopt this new form of warfare and were able to deploy aircraft in a similar capacity at Cambrai. While the British used single-seater planes, the Germans preferred the use of heavier two-seaters with an additional machine gunner in the aft cockpit. The Germans adopted the powerful Hannover CL.II and built the first purpose built ground attack aircraft, the Junkers J.I. During the 1918 Spring Offensive, the Germans employed 30 squadrons, or Schlasta, of ground attack fighters and were able to achieve some initial tactical success. The British later deployed the Sopwith Salamander as a specialized ground attack aircraft, although it was too late to see much action. During the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of 1918, CAS aircraft functioned as an important factor in ultimate victory. After the British achieved air superiority over the German aircraft sent to aid the Ottoman Turks, squadrons of S.E 5a's and D.H. 4s were sent on wide-ranging attacks against German and Turkish positions near the Jordan river. Combined with a ground assault led by General Edmund Allenby, three Turkish armies soon collapsed into a full rout. In the words of the attacking squadron's official report: :No 1 Squadron made six heavy raids during the day, dropped three tons of bombs and fired nearly 24,000 machine gun rounds. =Inter-war period= The British used air power extensively during the interwar period to police areas in the Middle East. The close air support doctrine was further developed in the interwar period. Most theorists advocated the adaptation of fighters or light bombers into the role. During this period, airpower advocates crystallized their views on the role of air- power in warfare. Aviators and ground officers developed largely opposing views on the importance of CAS, views that would frame institutional battles for CAS in the 20th century. The inter-war period saw the use of CAS in a number of conflicts, including the Russo-Polish War, the Spanish Civil War, colonial wars in the Middle East and the Gran Chaco War. The British used air power to great effect in various colonial hotspots in the Middle East and North Africa during the immediate postwar period. The newly formed RAF contributed to the defeat of Afghan forces during the Third Anglo-Afghan War by harassing the enemy and breaking up their formations. Z force, an air squadron, was also used to support ground operations during the Somaliland campaign, in which the \\"Mad Mullah\\" Mohammed Abdullah Hassan's insurgency was defeated. Following from these successes, the decision was made to create a unified RAF Iraq Command to use air power as a more cost-effective way of controlling large areas than the use of conventional land forces.Boyle, Andrew. Trenchard Man of Vision p. 371. It was effectively used to suppress the Great Iraqi Revolution of 1920 and various other tribal revolts. The Condor Legion reduced the city of Guernica to rubble, and greatly influenced German military strategists. During the Spanish Civil War German volunteer aviators of the Condor Legion on the Nationalist side, despite little official support from their government, developed close air support tactics that proved highly influential for subsequent Luftwaffe doctrine. U.S. Marine Corps Aviation was used as an intervention force in support of U.S. Marine Corps ground forces during the Banana Wars, in places such as Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua. Marine Aviators experimented with air-ground tactics and in Haiti and Nicaragua they adopted the tactic of dive bombing.Corum & Johnson, Small Wars, pp. 23-40. The observers and participants of these wars would base their CAS strategies on their experience of the conflict. Aviators, who wanted institutional independence from the Army, pushed for a view of air- power centered around interdiction, which would relieve them of the necessity of integrating with ground forces and allow them to operate as an independent military arm. They saw close air support as both the most difficult and most inefficient use of aerial assets. Close air support was the most difficult mission, requiring identifying and distinguishing between friendly and hostile units. At the same time, targets engaged in combat are dispersed and concealed, reducing the effectiveness of air attacks. They also argued that the CAS mission merely duplicated the abilities of artillery, whereas interdiction provided a unique capability. Ground officers contended there was rarely sufficient artillery available, and the flexibility of aircraft would be ideal for massing firepower at critical points, while producing a greater psychological effect on friendly and hostile forces alike. Moreover, unlike massive, indiscriminate artillery strikes, small aerial bombs would not render ground untrafficable, slowing attacking friendly forces. Although the prevailing view in official circles was largely indifferent to CAS during the interwar period, its importance was expounded upon by military theorists, such as J. F. C. Fuller and Basil Liddell Hart. Hart, who was an advocate of what later came to be known as 'Blitzkrieg' tactics, thought that the speed of armoured tanks would render conventional artillery incapable of providing support fire. Instead he proposed that: :actual 'offensive' support must come from an even more mobile artillery moving alongside. For this purpose the close co-operation of low-flying aircraft...is essential =Second World War= Luftwaffe Eastern Front, winter 1943‚Äì44. As a continental power intent on offensive operations, Germany could not ignore the need for aerial support of ground operations. Though the Luftwaffe, like its counterparts, tended to focus on strategic bombing, it was unique in its willingness to commit forces to CAS. Unlike the Allies, the Germans were not able to develop powerful strategic bombing capabilities, which implied industrial developments they were forbidden to take according to the Treaty of Versailles. In joint exercises with Sweden in 1934, the Germans were first exposed to dive-bombing, which permitted greater accuracy while making attack aircraft more difficult to track by antiaircraft gunners. As a result, Ernst Udet, chief of the Luftwaffe's development, initiated procurement of close support dive bombers on the model of the U.S. Navy's Curtiss Helldiver, resulting in the Henschel Hs 123, which was later replaced by the famous Junkers Ju 87 Stuka. Experience in the Spanish Civil War lead to the creation of five ground-attack groups in 1938, four of which would be equipped with Stukas. The Luftwaffe matched its material acquisitions with advances in the air-ground coordination. General Wolfram von Richthofen organized a limited number of air liaison detachments that were attached to ground units of the main effort. These detachments existed to pass requests from the ground to the air, and receive reconnaissance reports, but they were not trained to guide aircraft onto targets. These preparations did not prove fruitful in the invasion of Poland, where the Luftwaffe focused on interdiction and dedicated few assets to close air support. But the value of CAS was demonstrated at the crossing of the Meuse River during the Invasion of France in 1940. General Heinz Guderian, one of the creators of the combined-arms tactical doctrine commonly known as \\"blitzkrieg\\", believed the best way to provide cover for the crossing would be a continuous stream of ground attack aircraft on French defenders. Though few guns were hit, the attacks kept the French under cover and prevented them from manning their guns. Aided by the sirens attached to Stukas, the psychological impact was disproportional to the destructive power of close air support (although as often as not, the Stukas were used as tactical bombers instead of close air support, leaving much of the actual work to the older Hs 123 units for the first years of the war). In addition, the reliance on air support over artillery reduced the demand for logistical support through the Ardennes. Though there were difficulties in coordinating air support with the rapid advance, the Germans demonstrated consistently superior CAS tactics to those of the British and French defenders. Later, on the Eastern front, the Germans would devise visual ground signals to mark friendly units and to indicate direction and distance to enemy emplacements. Despite these accomplishments, German CAS was not perfect and suffered from the same misunderstanding and interservice rivalry that plagued other nations' air arms, and friendly fire was not uncommon. For example, on the eve of the Meuse offensive, Guderian's superior cancelled his CAS plans and called for high-altitude strikes from medium bombers, which would have required halting the offensive until the air strikes were complete. Fortunately for the Germans, his order was issued too late to be implemented, and the Luftwaffe commander followed the schedule he had previously worked out with Guderian. As late as November 1941, the Luftwaffe refused to provide Erwin Rommel with an air liaison officer for the Afrika Korps, because it \\"would be against the best use of the air force as a whole.\\" German CAS was also extensively used on the Eastern Front during the period 1941‚Äì1943. Their decline was caused by the growing strength of the Red Air Force and the redeployment of assets to defend against American and British strategic bombardment. Luftwaffe's loss of air superiority, combined with a declining supply of aircraft and fuel, crippled their ability to provide effective CAS on the western front after 1943. RAF and USAAF SBD Dauntless dropping its bomb. The Royal Air Force (RAF) entered the war woefully unprepared to provide CAS. In 1940 during the Battle of France, the Royal Air Force and Army headquarters in France were located at separate positions, resulting in unreliable communications. After the RAF was withdrawn in May, Army officers had to telephone the War Office in London to arrange for air support. The stunning effectiveness of German air- ground coordination spurred change. On the basis of tests in Northern Ireland in August 1940, Group Captain A. H. Wann RAF and Colonel J.D. Woodall (British Army) issued the Wann-Woodall Report, recommending the creation of a distinct tactical air force liaison officer (known colloquially as \\"tentacles\\") to accompany Army divisions and brigades. Their report spurred the RAF to create an RAF Army Cooperation Command and to develop tentacle equipment and procedures placing an Air Liaison Officer with each brigade.Delve 1994, p. 100. Although the RAF was working on its CAS doctrine in London, officers in North Africa improvised their own coordination techniques. In October 1941, Sir Arthur Tedder and Arthur Coningham, senior RAF commanders in North Africa, created joint RAF-Army Air Support Control staffs at each corps and armored division headquarters, and placed a Forward Air Support Link at each brigade to forward air support requests. When trained tentacle teams arrived in 1942, they cut response time on support requests to thirty minutes. It was also in the North Africa desert that the cab rank strategy was developed. It used a series of three aircraft, each in turn directed by the pertinent ground control by radio. One aircraft would be attacking, another in flight to the battle area, while a third was being refuelled and rearmed at its base. If the first attack failed to destroy the tactical target, the aircraft in flight would be directed to continue the attack. The first aircraft would land for its own refuelling and rearming once the third had taken off. The CAS tactics developed and refined by the British during the campaign in North Africa served as the basis for the Allied system used to subsequently gain victory in the air over Germany in 1944 and devastate its cities and industries. British Mobile Fighter Controllers operating during World War II The use of forward air control to guide close air support (CAS) aircraft, so as to ensure that their attack hits the intended target and not friendly troops, was first used by the British Desert Air Force in North Africa, but not by the USAAF until operations in Salerno. During the North African Campaign in 1941 the British Army and the Royal Air Force established Forward Air Support Links (FASL), a mobile air support system using ground vehicles. Light reconnaissance aircraft would observe enemy activity and report it by radio to the FASL which was attached at brigade level. The FASL was in communication (a two-way radio link known as a \\"tentacle\\") with the Air Support Control (ASC) Headquarters attached to the corps or armoured division which could summon support through a Rear Air Support Link with the airfields.Air power at the Battlefront: Allied Close Air Support in Europe, 1943‚Äì45 Ian Gooderson p26 They also introduced the system of ground direction of air strikes by what was originally termed a \\"Mobile Fighter Controller\\" traveling with the forward troops. The controller rode in the \\"leading tank or armoured car\\" and directed a \\"cab rank\\" of aircraft above the battlefield. This system of close co- operation first used by the Desert Air Force, was steadily refined and perfected, during the campaigns in Italy, Normandy and Germany. By the time the Italian Campaign had reached Rome, the Allies had established air superiority. They were then able to pre-schedule strikes by fighter-bomber squadrons; however, by the time the aircraft arrived in the strike area, oftentimes the targets, which were usually trucks, had fled. The initial solution to fleeting targets was the British \\"Rover\\" system. These were pairings of air controllers and army liaison officers at the front but able to switch communications seamlessly from one brigade to another ‚Äì hence Rover. Incoming strike aircraft arrived with pre-briefed targets, which they would strike 20 minutes after arriving on station only if the Rovers had not directed them to another more pressing target. Rovers might call on artillery to mark targets with smoke shells, or they might direct the fighters to map grid coordinates, or they might resort to a description of prominent terrain features as guidance. However, one drawback for the Rovers was the constant rotation of pilots, who were there for fortnightly stints, leading to a lack of institutional memory. US commanders, impressed by the British tactics at the Salerno landings, adapted their own doctrine to include many features of the British system. At the start of the War, the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) had, as its principal mission, the doctrine of strategic bombing. This incorporated the unerring belief that unescorted bombers could win the war without the advent of ground troops. This doctrine proved to be fundamentally flawed. However, during the entire course of the war the USAAF top brass clung to this doctrine, and hence operated independently of the rest of the Army. Thus it was initially unprepared to provide CAS, and in fact, had to be dragged \\"kicking and screaming\\" into the CAS function with the ground troops. USAAF doctrinal priorities for tactical aviation were, in order, air superiority, isolation of the battlefield via supply interdiction, and thirdly, close air support. Hence, during the North African Campaign, CAS was poorly executed, if at all. So few aerial assets were assigned to U.S. troops that they fired on anything in the air. And in 1943, the USAAF changed their radios to a frequency incompatible with ground radios. The situation improved during the Italian Campaign, where American and British forces, working in close cooperation, exchanged CAS techniques and ideas. There, the AAF's XII Air Support Command and the Fifth U.S. Army shared headquarters, meeting every evening to plan strikes and devising a network of liaisons and radios for communications. However, friendly fire continued to be a concern ‚Äì pilots did not know recognition signals and regularly bombed friendly units, until an A-36 was shot down in self-defense by Allied tanks. The expectation of losses to friendly fire from the ground during the planned invasion of France prompted the black and white invasion stripes painted on all Allied aircraft from 1944. 86th Fighter Bomber Group (Dive) in Italy in 1944. In 1944, USAAF commander Lt. Gen. Henry (\\"Hap\\") Arnold acquired 2 groups of A-24 dive bombers, the army version of the Navy's SBD-2, in response to the success of the Stuka and German CAS. Later, the USAAF developed a modification of the North American P-51 Mustang with dive brakes ‚Äì the North American A-36 Apache. However, there was no training to match the purchases. Though Gen. Lesley McNair, commander of Army Ground Forces, pushed to change USAAF priorities, the latter failed to provide aircraft for even major training exercises. Six months before the invasion of Normandy, 33 divisions had received no joint air-ground training. The USAAF saw the greatest innovations in 1944 under General Elwood Quesada, commander of IX Tactical Air Command, supporting the First U.S. Army. He developed the \\"armored column cover\\", where on-call fighter-bombers maintained a high-level of availability for important tank advances, allowing armor units to maintain a high tempo of exploitation even when they outran their artillery assets. He also used a modified antiaircraft radar to track friendly attack aircraft to redirect them as necessary, and experimented with assigning fighter pilots to tours as forward air controllers to familiarize them with the ground perspective. In July 1944, Quesada provided VHF aircraft radios to tank crews in Normandy. When the armored units broke out of the Normandy beachhead, tank commanders were able to communicate directly with overhead fighter-bombers. However, despite the innovation, Quesada focused his aircraft on CAS only for major offensives. Typically, both British and American attack aircraft were tasked primarily to interdiction, even though later analysis showed them to be twice as dangerous as CAS. XIX TAC, under the command of General Otto P. Weyland used similar tactics to support the rapid armored advance of General Patton's Third Army in its drive across France. Armed reconnaissance was a major feature of XIX TAC close air support, as the rapid advance left Patton's Southern flank open. Such was the close nature of cooperation between the Third Army and XIX TAC that Patton actually counted on XIX TAC to guard his flanks. This close air support from XIX TAC was credited by Patton as having been a key factor in the rapid advance and success of his's Third Army.Spires 2002. The American Navy and Marine Corps used CAS in conjunction with or as a substitute for the lack of available artillery or naval gunfire in the Pacific theater. Navy and Marine F6F Hellcats and F4U Corsairs used a variety of ordnance such as conventional bombs, rockets and napalm to dislodge or attack Japanese troops using cave complexes in the latter part of the Second World War.Barber 1946, Table 2.Whistling Death: The Chance-Vought F4U Corsair. Warfare History Network. 16 December 2018. Red Air Force A Soviet Air Force Il-2M Sturmovik The Soviet Union's Red Air Force quickly recognized the value of ground-support aircraft. As early as the Battles of Khalkhyn Gol in 1939, Soviet aircraft had the task of disrupting enemy ground operations.Coox 1985, p. 663. This use increased markedly after the June 1941 Axis invasion of the Soviet Union.Austersl√•tt, Tor Willy. \\"Ilyushin Il-2.\\" break-left.org, 2003. Retrieved: 27 March 2010. Purpose-built aircraft such as the Ilyushin Il-2 Sturmovik proved highly effective in blunting the activity of the Panzers. Joseph Stalin paid the Il-2 a great tribute in his own inimitable manner: when a particular production factory fell behind on its deliveries, Stalin sent the following cable to the factory manager: \\"They are as essential to the Red Army as air and bread\\". =Korean War= From Navy experiments with the KGW-1 Loon, the Navy designation for the German V-1 flying bomb, Marine Captain Marian Cranford Dalby developed the AN/MPQ-14, a system that enabled radar-guided bomb release at night or in poor weather.Krulak, First to Fight, pp. 113-119. F4U-5 Corsairs provide close air support to U.S. Marines fighting Chinese forces during the Korean War, December 1950. Though the Marine Corps continued its tradition of intimate air-ground cooperation in the Korean War, the newly created United States Air Force (USAF) again moved away from CAS, now to strategic bombers and jet interceptors. Though eventually the Air Force supplied sufficient pilots and forward air controllers to provide battlefield support, coordination was still lacking. Since pilots operated under centralized control, ground controllers were never able to familiarize themselves with pilots, and requests were not processed quickly. Harold K. Johnson, then commander of the 8th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division (later Army Chief of Staff) commented regarding CAS: \\"If you want it, you can't get it. If you can get it, it can't find you. If it can find you, it can't identify the target. If it can identify the target, it can't hit it. But if it does hit the target, it doesn't do a great deal of damage anyway.\\"Blair (1987), Forgotten War, p. 577. It is unsurprising, then, that MacArthur excluded USAF aircraft from the airspace over the Inchon Landing in September 1950, instead relying on Marine Aircraft Group 33 for CAS. In December 1951, Lt. Gen. James Van Fleet, commander of the Eighth U.S. Army, formally requested the United Nations Commander, Gen. Mark Clark, to permanently attach an attack squadron to each of the four army corps in Korea. Though the request was denied, Clark allocated many more Navy and Air Force aircraft to CAS. Despite the rocky start, the USAF would also work to improve its coordination efforts. It eventually required pilots to serve 80 days as forward air controllers (FACs), which gave them an understanding of the difficulties from the ground perspective and helped cooperation when they returned to the cockpit. The USAF also provided airborne FACs in critical locations. The Army also learned to assist, by suppressing anti-aircraft fire prior to air strikes. The U.S. Army wanted a dedicated USAF presence on the battlefield to reduce fratricide, or the harm of friendly forces. This preference led to the creation of the air liaison officer (ALO) position. The ALO is an aeronautically rated officer that has spent a tour away from the cockpit, serving as the primary adviser to the ground commander on the capabilities and limitations of airpower. The Korean War revealed important flaws in the application of CAS. Firstly, the USAF preferred interdiction over fire support while the Army regarded support missions as the main concern for air forces. Then, the Army advocated a degree of decentralization for good reactivity, in contrast with the USAF-favored centralization of CAS. The third point dealt with the lack of training and joint culture, which are necessary for an adequate air-ground integration. Finally, USAF aircraft were not designed for CAS: \\"the advent of jet fighters, too fast to adjust their targets, and strategic bombers, too big to be used on theatre, rendered CAS much harder to implement\\". =Vietnam and the CAS role debate= UH-1B with rockets and a grenade launcher During the late 1950s and early 1960s, the US Army began to identify a dedicated CAS need for itself. The Howze Board, which studied the question, published a landmark report describing the need for a helicopter- based CAS requirement. However, the Army did not follow the Howze Board recommendation initially. Nevertheless, it did eventually adopt the use of helicopter gunships and attack helicopters in the CAS role. Though the Army gained more control over its own CAS due to the development of the helicopter gunship and attack helicopter, the Air Force continued to provide fixed-wing CAS for Army units. Over the course of the war, the adaptation of The Tactical Air Control System proved crucial to the improvement of Air Force CAS. Jets replaced propeller-driven aircraft with minimal issues. The assumption of responsibility for the air request net by the Air Force improved communication equipment and procedures, which had long been a problem. Additionally, a major step in satisfying the Army's demands for more control over their CAS was the successful implementation of close air support control agencies at the corps level under Air Force control. Other notable adaptations were the usage of airborne Forward Air Controllers (FACs), a role previously dominated by FACs on the ground, and the use of B-52s for CAS. U.S. Marine Corps Aviation was much more prepared for the application of CAS in the Vietnam War, due to CAS being its central mission. One of the main debates taking place within the Marine Corps during the war was whether to adopt the helicopter gunship as a part of CAS doctrine and what its adoption would mean for fixed-wing CAS in the Marine Corps. The issue would eventually be put to rest, however, as the helicopter gunship proved crucial in the combat environment of Vietnam. AH-1 Cobra over Vietnam Though helicopters were initially armed merely as defensive measures to support the landing and extraction of troops, their value in this role lead to the modification of early helicopters as dedicated gunship platforms. Though not as fast as fixed-wing aircraft and consequently more vulnerable to anti-aircraft weaponry, helicopters could use terrain for cover, and more importantly, had much greater battlefield persistence owing to their low speeds. The latter made them a natural complement to ground forces in the CAS role. In addition, newly developed anti-tank guided missiles, demonstrated to great effectiveness in the 1973 Yom Kippur War, provided aircraft with an effective ranged anti-tank weapon. These considerations motivated armies to promote the helicopter from a support role to a combat arm. Though the U.S. Army controlled rotary-wing assets, coordination continued to pose a problem. During wargames, field commanders tended to hold back attack helicopters out of fear of air defenses, committing them too late to effectively support ground units. The earlier debate over control over CAS assets was reiterated between ground commanders and aviators. Nevertheless, the US Army incrementally gained increased control over its CAS role. In the mid-1970s, after Vietnam, the USAF decided to train an enlisted force to handle many of the tasks the ALO was saturated with, to include terminal attack control. Presently, the ALO mainly serves in the liaison role, the intricate details of mission planning and attack guidance left to the enlisted members of the Tactical Air Control Party. Aircraft An A-10 Thunderbolt II firing an AGM-65 Maverick missile. Various aircraft can fill close air support roles. Military helicopters are often used for close air support and are so closely integrated with ground operations that in most countries they are operated by the army rather than the air force. Fighters and ground attack aircraft like the A-10 Thunderbolt II provide close air support using rockets, missiles, small bombs, and strafing runs. During the Second World War, a mixture of dive bombers and fighters were used for CAS missions. Dive bombing permitted greater accuracy than level bombing runs, while the rapid altitude change made it more difficult for antiaircraft gunners to track. The Junkers Ju 87 Stuka is a well known example of a dive bomber built for precision bombing but which was successfully used for CAS. It was fitted with wind-blown whistles on its landing gear to enhance its psychological effect. Some variants of the Stuka were equipped with a pair of Bordkanone BK 3,7 cannons mounted in under-wing gun pods, each loaded with two six-round magazines of armour-piercing tungsten carbide-cored ammunition, for anti-tank operations. Other than the North American A-36 Apache, a P-51 modified with dive brakes,Grunehagen 1969, p. 60.Kinzey 1996, p. 22. the Americans and British used no dedicated CAS aircraft in the Second World War, preferring fighters or fighter-bombers that could be pressed into CAS service. While some aircraft, such as the Hawker Typhoon and the P-47 Thunderbolt, performed admirably in that role,Thomas and Shores 1988, pp. 23‚Äì26.Dunn, Carle E. (LTC). \\"Army Aviation and Firepower\\". Army, May 2000. Retrieved 21 November 2009. there were a number of compromises that prevented most fighters from making effective CAS platforms. Fighters were usually optimized for high-altitude operations without bombs or other external ordnance ‚Äì flying at low level with bombs quickly expended fuel. Cannons had to be mounted differently for strafing ‚Äì strafing required a further and lower convergence point than aerial combat did. Of the Allied powers that fought in the Second World War, the Soviet Union used specifically designed ground attack aircraft more than the UK and US. Such aircraft included the Ilyushin Il-2, the single most produced military aircraft at any point in world history.Hardesty 1982, p. 170. The Soviet military also frequently deployed the Polikarpov Po-2 biplane as a ground attack aircraft.Gordon 2008, p. 285. F/A-18F Super Hornet in a close air support configuration over Afghanistan in 2009 The Royal Navy Hawker Sea Fury fighters and the U.S. Vought F4U Corsair and Douglas A-1 Skyraider were operated in a ground attack capacity during the Korean War.Darling 2002, pp. 51‚Äì52.Kinzey 1998, p. 12. Outside of the conflict, there were numerous other occasions that the Sea Fury was used as a ground attack platform. Cuban Sea Furies, operated by the Fuerza A√©rea Revolucionaria (\\"Revolutionary Air Force\\"; FAR), were used to oppose the US-orchestrated Bay of Pigs Invasion to attack incoming transport ships and disembarking ground forces alike.Mario E. \\"Bay of Pigs: In the Skies Over Gir√≥n\\". 2000, (18 March 2014.)Cooper, Tom. \\"Clandestine US Operations: Cuba, 1961, Bay of Pigs\\". 2007, (18 March 2014.) The A-1 Skyraider also saw later use, especially throughout the Vietnam War.Dorr and Bishop 1996, pp. 34‚Äì35. In the Vietnam War, the United States introduced a number of fixed and rotary wing gunships, including several cargo aircraft that were refitted as gun platforms to serve as CAS and air interdiction aircraft. The first of these to emerge was the Douglas AC-47 Spooky, which was converted from the Douglas C-47 Skytrain/Douglas DC-3. Some commentators have remarked on the high effectiveness of the AC-47 in the CAS role.Corum, James S. and Johnson, Wray R. \\"Airpower in Small Wars: Fighting Insurgents and Terrorists.\\" Kansas University Press: 2003. . p. 337. The USAF developed several other platforms following on from the AC-47, including the Fairchild AC-119 and the Lockheed AC-130.\\"Hurlburt Field: AC-119 Shadow\\". . United States Air Force, 7 July 2008. Retrieved: 8 May 2012. The AC-130 has had a particularly lengthy service, being used extensively during the War in Afghanistan, the Iraq War and the US military intervention in Libya during the early twenty-first century. Multiple variants of the AC-130 have been developed and it has continued to be modernised, including the adoption of various new armaments.Michael Sirak with Marc Schanz, \\"Spooky Gun Swap Canceled\\". Air Force Magazine, October 2008, Volume 91, Number 10, p. 24. B-1B Lancer on a close air support mission in Afghanistan in 2008 B-1B Lancer employing GBU-38's in Iraq Usually close support is thought to be only carried out by fighter-bombers or dedicated ground-attack aircraft, such as the A-10 Thunderbolt II (Warthog) or Su-25 (Frogfoot), but even large high-altitude bombers have successfully filled close support roles using precision-guided munitions. During Operation Enduring Freedom, the lack of fighter aircraft forced military planners to rely heavily on US bombers, particularly the B-1B Lancer, to fill the CAS role. Bomber CAS, relying mainly on GPS guided weapons and laser-guided JDAMs has evolved into a devastating tactical employment methodology and has changed US doctrinal thinking regarding CAS in general. With significantly longer loiter times, range, and weapon capacity, bombers can be deployed to bases outside of the immediate battlefield area, with 12-hour missions being commonplace since 2001. After the initial collapse of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, airfields in Afghanistan became available for continuing operations against the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. This resulted in a great number of CAS operations being undertaken by aircraft from Belgium (F-16 Fighting Falcon), Denmark (F-16), France (Mirage 2000D), the Netherlands (F-16), Norway (F-16), the United Kingdom (Harrier GR7s, GR9s and Tornado GR4s) and the United States (A-10, F-16, AV-8B Harrier II, F-15E Strike Eagle, F/A-18 Hornet, F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, UH-1Y Venom). The use of information technology to direct and coordinate precision air support has increased the importance of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance in using CAS. Laser, GPS, and battlefield data transfer are routinely used to coordinate with a wide variety of air platforms able to provide CAS. Recent doctrine reflects the increased use of electronic and optical technology to direct targeted fires for CAS. Air platforms communicating with ground forces can also provide additional aerial-to-ground visual search, ground-convoy escort, and enhancement of command and control (C2), assets which can be particularly important for low intensity conflict.Haun (2006), Air & Space Power Journal.

First established in 1972 as a protest against the McMahon government‚Äôs approach to Indigenous Australian land rights, it is made up of signs and tents. Since 1992 it has been located on the lawn opposite Old Parliament House in Canberra, the Australian capital. It is not considered an official embassy by the Australian Government. The targets of protests at the Embassy have changed over time, and include not only land rights but also Indigenous sovereignty and self- determination. History On 26 January 1972, four Aboriginal men (Michael Anderson, Billy Craigie, Tony Coorey and Bertie Williams) arrived in Canberra from Sydney to establish the Aboriginal Embassy by planting a beach umbrella on the lawn in front of Parliament House (now Old Parliament House). The Embassy was established in response to the McMahon Coalition Government's refusal to recognise Aboriginal land rights or native title in Australia. McMahon instead favoured a new general-purpose lease for Aboriginal people which would be conditional upon their \\"intention and ability to make reasonable economic and social use of land\\", while reserving for the Crown rights to minerals and forestry. The beach umbrella was soon replaced by several tents and Aboriginal people and non-Indigenous supporters came from all parts of Australia to join the protest. The occupiers were told by Kep Enderby that they were legally entitled to camp outside Parliament since it was Commonwealth Land. Chicka Dixon stated \\"I became the 'Minister for Defence' and we gave ourselves portfolios. We painted the gutter No Parking Aboriginal Staff Only and then we introduced the (Aboriginal) flag.\\" During the first six months of its life in 1972 the Embassy succeeded in uniting Aboriginal people throughout Australia in demanding uniform national land rights and mobilised widespread non-Indigenous support for the cause. Other people associated with the Embassy demonstration in 1972 include Paul Coe, Gary Foley, Gary Williams, John Newfong, Sam Watson, Pearl Gibbs, Roberta Sykes, Alana Doolan, Cheryl Buchannan, Pat Eatock, Kevin Gilbert, Denis Walker, Isobelle Coe and Shirley Smith.Australia Day under a beach umbrella, Collaborating for Indigenous Rights, National Museum of Australia In February 1972 the Aboriginal Tent Embassy presented a list of demands to Parliament: *Control of the Northern Territory as a State within the Commonwealth of Australia; the parliament in the Northern Territory to be predominantly Aboriginal with native title and mining rights to all land within the Territory. *Legal title and mining rights to all other presently existing Aboriginal reserve lands and settlements throughout Australia. *The preservation of all sacred sites throughout Australia. *Legal title and mining rights to areas in and around all Australian capital cities. *Compensation money for lands not returnable to take the form of a down-payment of billion and an annual percentage of the gross national income. The demands were rejected, and following an amendment to the Trespass on Commonwealth Lands Ordinance (which made the occupation a squat which could then be evicted), police moved in without notice in July 1972. They removed the tents and arrested eight people. Three days later, 200 activists returned to the site and were prevented from reoccupying it by 200 police. A week later, 1000 people came back to resquat the site again. Chicka Dixon commented \\"we decided to fight the coppers, so we armed ourselves with little sticks\\". The police did not intervene, and after listening to speeches the crowd dispersed peacefully. The ACT Supreme Court ruled in September 1972 that the amendment to the Trespass on Commonwealth Lands Ordinance did not allow for the eviction of the Embassy, and it was re-erected. A Bill was quickly added to make the Ordinance retrospective, and the Embassy was evicted again the next day. In October 1973, around 70 Aboriginal protesters staged a sit-in on the steps of Parliament House and the Tent Embassy was re-established. The sit-in ended when Labor Prime Minister Gough Whitlam agreed to meet with protesters. In May 1974 the embassy was destroyed in a storm, but it was re-established in October. In February 1975 Aboriginal activist Charles Perkins negotiated the \\"temporary\\" removal of the Embassy with the Government, pending Government action on land rights. The Fraser Government subsequently enacted the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976, after its drafting by the Whitlam Labor Government in 1975. In March 1976, the Embassy was established in a house in the nearby suburb of Red Hill; however, this closed in 1977. For a short period in 1979, the embassy was re-established as the \\"National Aboriginal Government\\" on Capital Hill, site of the proposed new Parliament House. On the twentieth anniversary of its founding, the Aboriginal Tent Embassy was re- established at the original site on the lawns of Old Parliament House in 1992. Despite being a continual source of controversy, with many calls for its removal, it has existed on the site since that time. The site of the Tent Embassy was added to the Australian Register of the National Estate in 1995, as the only Aboriginal site in Australia that is recognised nationally as representing political struggle for all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Some elders of the local Ngunnawal people called for the eviction of the Tent Embassy in 2005, viewing it as an eyesore. In the leadup to the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Isobell Coe from the Wiradjuri Nation set up a Peace Camp and combined ashes from Canberra's sacred fire to the fire at Victoria Park in Camperdown, New South Wales to promote reconciliation. Fire of the Land (2002 documentary) This sacred fire was originally made by Kevin Buzzacott and lit by Wiradjuri man Paul Coe at the embassy in 1998. There have also been a number of suspicious fires at the site. The most devastating fire took place in June 2003, when 31 years of records were lost. 2005 consultation The embassy after being partially destroyed by an arson attack In August 2005, the Federal Government announced a review into the Aboriginal Tent Embassy. They consulted with Aboriginal communities around Australia to determine what shape the Tent Embassy should take in the future. The group was headed by Minister Jim Lloyd and included a number of Aboriginal elders from around Australia. Professional mediators Callum Campbell and Tom Stodulka were called in to facilitate the process and consult with Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, to obtain and represent their views. They reached a decision on the Embassy's future early in December 2005. Fortieth anniversary  Corroboree for Sovereignty at the Aboriginal Tent Embassy in 2010 On Australia Day, 26 January 2012, the Embassy was celebrating its fortieth anniversary. The National Congress of Australia's First Peoples had planned a series of events over two days, to celebrate the struggle for Aboriginal land rights and the theatre of political protest. What became known as the Australia Day 2012 protests occurred when Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Opposition Leader Tony Abbott went to the Lobby Restaurant, close to the embassy site. That morning Abbott had been asked whether he found the Embassy \\"still relevant\\" and he had replied \\"I think the Indigenous people of Australia can be very proud of the respect in which they are held by every Australian and, yes, I think a lot has changed since then and I think it probably is time to move on from that\\". These comments angered activists since they felt Abbott was proposing that the Embassy should be evicted. Gillard and Abbott were hastily escorted from the restaurant under the protection of police officers, and during the scramble Gillard lost one of her shoes, which was collected by protesters. At first the Embassy posted on its Facebook page that the shoe would be returned only in exchange for stolen land, but the shoe was later returned to her.http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/police-called-after-gillard- and-abbott-trapped-by-protesters-in-canberra/story-fn7x8me2-1226254409434 Other Aboriginal tent embassies In 2012, there were six other tent embassies dotted around the nation.

The Issaquah Alps is the unofficial name for the highlands near Issaquah, Washington, a suburb of Seattle, including Cougar Mountain, Squak Mountain, Tiger Mountain, Taylor Mountain, Rattlesnake Ridge, Rattlesnake Mountain, and Grand Ridge. The term was invented in 1977 by noted nature author Harvey Manning within the pages of his trail guidebook Footsore 1, elevating their status from foothills to \\"Alps\\" to advocate preservation. Manning himself lived on a developed section of Cougar Mountain in his \\"200 meter hut\\". In 1979, Harvey Manning helped to found the Issaquah Alps Trails Club to care for the trails and to push for public ownership of the Alps. The IATC, which is headquartered in Issaquah (nicknamed \\"Trailhead City\\"), conducts frequent guided hikes throughout the Alps. The Issaquah Alps follow Interstate 90 from the shore of Lake Washington almost to the western face of the Cascade Range. The hills are composed of andesitic volcanic rock lying on top of older tightly folded rocks from the coastal plain of the North Cascade subcontinent that docked with Washington about 50 million years ago as the entire continent of North America moved west across the ocean. The Alps were heavily eroded by glaciers in the last ice age. The Vashon lobe of the ice sculpted Rattlesnake Ledge, steeply carved the east and west sides of Squak Mountain, and deposited a large erratic on Cougar Mountain, Fantastic Erratic. Cedar Butte rises abruptly from the moraine between Rattlesnake Ledge and the absolute front of the Cascades. It is sometimes considered part of the Issaquah Alps but it is a relatively young symmetrical volcanic cone and is therefore more closely related to neighboring Mount Washington to the east than the old weathered hills of the majority of the Alps.

It can also be a remark or question, typically disparaging (also called insinuation), that works obliquely by allusion. In the latter sense the intention is often to insult or accuse someone in such a way that one's words, taken literally, are innocent. According to the Advanced Oxford Learner's Dictionary, an innuendo is \\"an indirect remark about somebody or something, usually suggesting something bad, mean or rude\\", such as: \\"innuendos about her private life\\" or \\"The song is full of sexual innuendo\\".Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary (7th Edition; electronic version) Sexual innuendo The term sexual innuendo has acquired a specific meaning, namely that of a \\"risqu√©\\" double entendre by playing on a possibly sexual interpretation of an otherwise innocent uttering. For example: \\"We need to go deeper\\" can be seen as either a request for further inquiry, or allude to sexual penetration. In the context of defamation law, an innuendo meaning is one which is not directly contained in the words complained of, but which would be understood by those reading it based on special knowledge. Film, television and other media Comedy film scripts have used innuendo since the beginning of sound film itself. A notable example is the Carry On film series (1958‚Äì1992) in which innuendo was a staple feature, often including the title of the film itself. British sitcoms and comedy shows such as Are You Being Served? and Round the Horne have also made extensive use of innuendo. Mild sexual innuendo is a staple of British pantomime. A male cat paying a \\"call\\" on a female cat, who then serves up kittens, insinuating that the \\"result\\" of children is predicated on a male \\"catcall\\" Numerous television programs and animated films targeted at child audiences often use innuendos in attempt to entertain adolescent/adult audiences without exceeding their network's censorship policies. On The Scott Mills Show on BBC Radio 1, listeners are asked to send in clips from radio and TV with innuendos in a humorous context, a feature known as \\"Innuendo Bingo\\". Presenters and special guests fill their mouths with water and listen to the clips, and the last person to spit the water out with laughter wins the game.

The movie starred a 26-year-old Tom Hanks in his first leading film role.  Background  The film was adapted from a novel of the same name by Rona Jaffe. Jaffe had based her 1981 novel on inaccurate newspaper stories about the disappearance of James Dallas Egbert III from Michigan State University in 1979. Early media accounts had over- emphasized Egbert's participation in fantasy role playing, often speculating that his hobby of Dungeons & Dragons might have been a factor in his disappearance. William Dear, the private investigator on the case, explained actual events and the reasons behind the media myth in his 1984 book The Dungeon Master. Jaffe wrote her novel in a matter of days because of a fear that another author might also be fictionalizing the Egbert investigation. The film premiered on CBS in 1982. It stars Tom Hanks, Wendy Crewson, David Wallace and Chris Makepeace. The film has been available on VHS tape, DVD and Amazon Prime. Like the book on which it is based, the film touches on the claim that the playing of role-playing games could be related to psychological problems. At least one protagonist is (or at least appears to be) suffering from schizophrenia (or some analogous condition).Lowrey, Michael J. (as \\"Mike Lowery\\"). \\"Tales stranger than fantasy\\" (a review of the novel and of Hobgoblin); Dragon #75, p. 74 Plot The film opens with a scene that is repeated later in the film in which a reporter meets with police searching a cavern. He is told a game of Mazes and Monsters got out of hand. Robbie Wheeling (Tom Hanks) starts college at the fictional Grant University and soon develops a group of friends, all of whom have their own personal problems and issues. Jay Jay (Chris Makepeace) feels marginalized by his mother, who constantly redecorates his room since she can't make up her mind about the best look. In his \\"self-decorating\\", he wears a variety of unusual hats. Kate (Wendy Crewson) has had a series of failed relationships, and suffers from her father leaving home; Daniel's (David Wallace) parents reject his dream of becoming a video-game designer; and Robbie's alcoholic mother and strict father fight constantly, and he is still tormented by the mysterious disappearance of his brother, Hall. They are fans of Mazes and Monsters, a fantasy role-playing game that had previously caused Robbie to get kicked out of his last school when he became too obsessed with it. Though he is reluctant, the other three students convince him to start playing again with them. Through the course of playing the game, Robbie and Kate begin a serious relationship, in which he confides in her that he still has nightmares about his missing brother. Eventually, Jay Jay, upset by feeling left out by his friends, decides to commit suicide in a local cavern. In the process of planning it out, he changes his mind and decides the cavern would be better suited to a new Mazes and Monsters campaign. He dramatically kills off his character to force them to start a new campaign, in which he describes they will be living out their fantasy. He proposes playing his new game in a disused and condemned cavern, and dismisses the warnings from his friends ‚Äì who reluctantly agree to participate. During the actual spelunking, Robbie experiences a psychotic episode involving the last time he saw his brother, and he hallucinates that he has slain a monster, called a Gorvil. From this point forward, Robbie believes he is actually his character, the cleric Pardieu. This leads him to break off his relationship with Kate (to maintain celibacy), and to start drawing maps that will lead him to a sacred place he has seen in his dreams called the Great Hall. In his dream, the Great Hall tells him to go to the Two Towers, and he disappears. His friends report him to the police while concealing their trip into the caverns. They and police investigators suspect he is deceased. Robbie travels to New York City, where he stabs a mugger whom he imagines to be a monster. He sees blood on his knife, then sees his bloodied clothes in a window and breaks out of his delusions for long enough to call Kate from a payphone. After he agrees to go to Jay Jay's house, a delusion leads him into the subway. Not finding him at Jay Jay's house, the friends deduce Robbie has equated the Two Towers with the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. Robbie believes that by jumping off one of them and casting a spell, he will finally join the Great Hall. After a search, his friends find him and stop him from jumping off the south tower observation deck using the game's rules, once again pulling him out of his delusion. The film ends with the friends visiting Robbie at his parents' estate, hoping to pick up their friendship where they left off. Though he is now in regular counseling, it is implied that Robbie will live out the rest of his life trapped in his imaginary world believing that he is still Pardieu, that his friends are really their characters, and that he is living at an inn (actually his parents' home) and paying for his boarding with a magic coin, which \\"magically\\" reappears in his pouch each morning. He then tells his shocked friends of a great evil lurking in the forest across the lake, believing that it threatens the lives of the \\"innkeeper\\" and his wife. The three, feeling sorry for Robbie and guilty for their role in his psychotic break, decide to engage him in a \\"game\\" of Mazes and Monsters, letting Robbie dictate the events to them. In the end, Kate says, \\"And so ... we played the game again ... for one last time.\\" See also References External links  RPGnet review * Mazes and Monsters review by Ironic Consumer * \\"The Disappearance of James Dallas Egbert III\\" by Shaun Hately * \\"The Attacks on Role-Playing Games\\" by Paul Cardwell, Jr. 1980s drama films 1980s fantasy films 1982 films 1982 television films Adaptations of works by Rona Jaffe American drama films American fantasy films American films CBS network films Films based on American novels Films directed by Steven Hilliard Stern History of role-playing games Warner Bros. films ","title":"Mazes and Monsters"},{"id":"600810","text":"The Island of Rockall Act 1972 (c. 2) is a British Act of Parliament formally incorporating the island of Rockall into the United Kingdom to protect it from Irish and Icelandic claims.

Opened in 1923, it follows the Wapack Range north-south for , between Mount Watatic in Ashburnham, Massachusetts and North Pack Monadnock mountain in Greenfield, New Hampshire. It is designed primarily for day use by hikers, with minimal camping facilities. The trail passes through the Massachusetts towns of Ashburnham and Ashby, and the New Hampshire towns of New Ipswich, Temple, Sharon, Peterborough, and Greenfield. It also goes over Temple Mountain, and through Miller State Park, Binney Hill Wilderness Preserve, and the Wapack National Wildlife Refuge, as well as numerous privately owned parcels of land. In New Ipswich it skirts Windblown Cross- Country Ski Area, which operated for four decades until closing in 2020. The trail is overseen by Friends of the Wapack, a non-profit group. Aside from upgrading and maintaining the trail, the group is trying to have the entire length preserved from development. The southern part of the Wapack Trail overlaps with the northern part of the Midstate Trail. Friends of the Wapack patch  History  The trail was born in a conversation in the summer of 1922 at the Shattuck Inn in Jaffrey, New Hampshire between Allen Chamberlain, who later became president of the Appalachian Mountain Club, and Jaffrey farmer Albert Annett while overlooking the Wapack Range, then known as the Boundary Mountains. The two talked about the possibility of a skyline trail along the ridge of the Boundary Mountains from Mt. Watatic to North Pack Monadnock. Later, Albert brought the idea to fellow farmers Frank Robbins and Marion Buck of Rindge, New Hampshire. The three started cutting the trail near the end of the summer using hand tools. The trail was opened in 1923. Buck named it by joining the Wa from Mt. Watatic and Pack from North Pack Monadnock, and soon the Boundary Mountains became known as the Wapack Range.  Trail running races  There are two running races along the trail. A race in May was started in 2007 by Bogie Dumitrescu. It is and goes the whole length of the trail beginning at the northern terminus. A longer out-and-back ultramarathon version starts at the southern terminus and runs all the way to the northern terminus and back. An out and back segment to Binney Pond is added to bring the distance to 50 miles. Slower runners are stopped after . A Labor Day September race directed by Paul Funch covers the southern part of the trail. It starts at the Windblown cross-country ski area and proceeds to Mount Watatic and back.

The film stars Jackie Mason, Dan Aykroyd, Robert Stack, Dyan Cannon, Randy Quaid, Chevy Chase, Jonathan Silverman, and Jessica Lundy. It was written by various outside writers, but is credited to the first draft by Peter Torokvei and Harold Ramis, who also co-wrote and directed the first, and is directed by Allan Arkush. The film garnered a PG rating, in contrast to the original's R rating. The film was given scathing reviews by critics, but Kenny Loggins' \\"Nobody's Fool\\" was a chart success, hitting #8 on the Billboard Hot 100. Plot Kate Hartounian (Jessica Lundy) is the daughter of a wealthy and widowed real estate developer of Armenian and Jewish descent. Eager to improve her lot in life, she makes friends with Miffy Young (Chynna Phillips), a snooty WASP girl, who encourages her and her father to join their country club. Kate and her father, Jack (Jackie Mason), apply for membership at Bushwood, the club from the first movie. Jack is a self-made millionaire, yet remains self-effacing, friendly and generous despite his wealth. His crude personality and eccentric clothing foils him on many occasions. When the current members meet Jack, who builds low-income housing in more upscale neighborhoods, his application to join is rejected. The rejection stems from his oafish personality and an earlier confrontation with Bushwood President (and Miffy's father) Chandler Young's (Robert Stack) wife. The glamorous Cynthia Young (Dina Merrill) had tried unsuccessfully to persuade Jack to build his housing complex away from her neighborhood, but her less-than-subtle snobbery leads Jack to chase Cynthia with a bulldozer. It's actions like these that build a divide between Jack and Kate. Ty Webb (Chevy Chase) returns, this time as the club's majority owner, and while he admires Jack, he prefers to stay out of the way of the club's day-to-day operations. The elitist members of Bushwood reject Jack's membership application and pull strings to suspend his housing operation. In retaliation, Jack buys Bushwood's stock from Ty and turns it into an amusement park. Chandler, incensed at the thought of a mere \\"nouveau-riche\\" individual getting the better of him, hires Captain Tom Everett (Dan Aykroyd) (who code-names Chandler \\"Mrs. Esterhaus\\"), a shell- shocked mercenary operating out of a lunch wagon, to \\"discourage\\" Jack from building any more structures on Bushwood property. The bumbling Everett decides to use explosive golf balls to do this. Meanwhile, Chandler uses his lawyers and connections to shut down Jack's housing construction site. Webb suggests that the dispute should be resolved like gentlemen, by facing each other in a golf match. If Chandler wins, Jack loses his construction site and the country club, and if Jack wins, he keeps Bushwood and the housing project. Despite Jack's poor performance early in the match, with luck he ties the match before the final hole. However, during the hole, Jack is faced with a 50-foot putt, while Chandler faces a simple two-foot putt. Using advice given to him by Webb before the match, Jack manages to use spiritual chanting and the adage \\"be the ball\\" to sink the nearly impossible putt. Chandler needs to sink the easy two-foot putt to tie the match. Meanwhile, Everett, who foolishly shoots himself in the buttocks with a poison dart, fails to eliminate Jack as a gopher steals his explosive ball. The mischievous gopher replaces Chandler's ball with the explosive ball, and as his family encouragingly crowds around him as he taps in his final swing, the ball bursts and Jack wins the match. Though Kate is embarrassed by her father's actions, she is still loyal to him, as evidenced when she commiserates to Miffy, who suggests that she change her last name from Hartounian to Hart. Bewildered at the thought of turning her back on her family name, Kate turns her back on Miffy and makes up with her father.

This time, instead of tittering, the gopher was able to speak. His voice was provided by Frank Welker. Because of Bill Murray's involvement in the creation of the gopher for the first film, Murray sued producers of the film during post-production. Murray and the producers settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. Industrial Light and Magic supplied the visual effects for these scenes. Production Harold Ramis, who co-wrote the original Caddyshack with Brian Doyle-Murray and Douglas Kenney, described Caddyshack II, which he co-wrote with Peter Torokvei, as \\"terrible.\\" In an interview with The A.V. Club in 1999, Ramis said that, Ramis was later quoted as saying that Dangerfield was the only one who expressed any interest in doing a sequel in the first place. Ted Knight had died two years earlier, Bill Murray was not interested in reprising his role as Carl the greenskeeper, and he said Chevy Chase had \\"already moved on\\", although Chase did eventually agree to appear. Dangerfield, after insisting on a number of script rewrites, said that he backed out of the film because he felt it would not be successful. Chevy Chase was the only cast member from the original film to reprise his role (and would publicly announce later that he regretted doing so). Although playing new characters in the sequel, Jackie Mason, Robert Stack, Dan Aykroyd and Jonathan Silverman play roles which are analogous to those played by Rodney Dangerfield, Ted Knight, Bill Murray, and Michael O'Keefe in the first film. Cast reception was generally negative. At one point, Chase murmured to the film's director Allan Arkush during post-production, \\"Call me when you‚Äôve dubbed the laugh-track,\\" before walking away in disgust. Rodney Dangerfield was sued by Warner Bros. for refusing to appear in the film, although Dangerfield was little affected by this dispute. Sam Kinison was originally up for Randy Quaid's role, but left the production when his friend Dangerfield dropped out. The theme song for Caddyshack II is \\"Nobody's Fool\\", performed by Kenny Loggins, whose hit song \\"I'm Alright\\" was featured in the first film. Other singles from the soundtrack include \\"Power of Persuasion\\" by The Pointer Sisters; \\"Go For Yours\\", an R&B; hit for Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam and \\"Turn On (The Beat Box)\\" by Earth, Wind & Fire. The soundtrack was released on Columbia Records. Reception The film was panned by critics and grossed $11,798,302 compared to the original's $39 million gross at the box office. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 4% based on 24 reviews. The site's consensus reads: \\"Handicapped by a family friendly PG rating, even the talents of Caddyshack IIs all-star comic cast can't save it from its lazy, laughless script and uninspired direction.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 7 based on reviews from 7 critics, indicating \\"overwhelming dislike\\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade C+ on scale of A to F. Rita Kempley of The Washington Post wrote: \\"Caddyshack II, a feeble follow-up to the 1980 laff riot, is lamer than a duck with bunions, and dumber than grubs. It's patronizing and clumsily manipulative, and top banana Jackie Mason is upstaged by the gopher puppet.\\" Michael Wilmington of the Los Angeles Times said the film was so bad \\"it makes \\"Caddyshack I\\" look like \\"Godfather II.\\" The film received four Golden Raspberry Award nominations; it won two. It was nominated for Worst Picture and Worst Actor (Jackie Mason), and won for Worst Supporting Actor (Dan Aykroyd) and Worst Original Song (\\"Jack Fresh\\"). It also won Worst Picture at the 1988 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards.

It was used primarily by small to midsize businesses for accounting applications. RPG II was the primary programming language for the machine. Overview The 16-bit single-user System/32, also known as the IBM 5320, was introduced in 1975, and it was the successor to the IBM System/3 model 6 in the IBM midrange computer line. IBM described it as \\"the first system to incorporate hardware and comprehensive application software.\\" Within 40 months, \\"the System/32 had surpassed the IBM System/3 as the most installed IBM computer.\\" The computer looked like a large office desk with a very small six-line by forty-character display and a keyboard similar to an IBM keypunch. The machine had a built-in line printer, that directly faced the operator when seated, and could print reports, memos, billing statements, address labels, etc. The system, which had been introduced January 7, 1975 was withdrawn from marketing on October 17, 1984. Migration to the IBM System/34 was generally simple because source code was compatible and programs just needed recompilation. Having the appearance of a computerized desk, the System/32 was nicknamed the \\"Bionic Desk\\" after The Six Million Dollar Man (bionic man), a popular U.S. TV program when the computer was introduced in 1975. Memory/storage It had 16 kB or 32 kB of main memory. A single hard drive was available in one of three sizes:with 5 more choices added a year later * 5 MB * 9 MB * 13 MB The system included an eight-inch floppy drive that could also read floppies from the IBM 3740 family. Only one side of the 77-track floppy diskette was used. Each track held 26 128-byte sectors. An extended format was offered by IBM, and it permitted 512 bytes per sector. Even so, that came to an 8-inch floppy holding less than one third of a megabyte. System/32 operator When keying input data, the operator would be viewing the character display, which was also common to the then current IBM 3740 family of data entry to floppy disk media.

It is situated on the north shore of the Rideau River between the town of Perth and the town of Smiths Falls. It is a predominantly rural municipality. The township offices are located in the hamlet of Port Elmsley. History The township, covering 366.03 km¬≤, was formed on January 1, 1998, through the merger of Drummond Township and North Elmsley Township. Communities The township comprises the communities of Armstrong Corners, Balderson, Beveridge Locks, Cook's Shore, Craig Shore, Drummond Centre, Ebbs Shore, Elmgrove, Ferguson Falls, Glenview, Innisville, McCreary's Shore, McCulloughs Landing, McNaughton Shore, Port Elmsley, Prestonvale, Richardson, Rideau Ferry, Robertson's Shore and Wayside. Geography and ecology The most common landscape is gently rolling Canadian shield, predominantly gneiss. The valleys often have clay or sand deposits from events near the end of the last ice age. At one point near the end of the last ice age, the Champlain Sea flooded the Ottawa valley as far inland as what is now the town of Perth.Chapman, L.J. and D.F. Putnam. 1951. The Physiography of Southern Ontario. University of Toronto Press, Toronto. 284 p. plus map in four sections. West of Perth along Highway 7 one can see a remnant of this clay plain. An old shoreline of the Champlain Sea crosses Highway 7 near Ramsay Concession 2 before winding south into Drummond/North Elmsley. North of Perth, this clay plain is occupied by the huge Blueberry Marsh.Keddy, P.A. 2008. Earth, Water, Fire. An Ecological Profile of Lanark County. General Store Publishing House, Refrew, Ontario. Map 14. The hard rock and thin soil produced distinctive deciduous forests dominated by maple, oak, beech, ash and pine. Southern trees like hickory and butternut are less common. Wetter areas have elm, silver maple and white cedar. Hemlock was much more common in the past, but logging for bark used in tanning has much depleted this species.Keddy, C.J. 1993. Forest History of Eastern Ontario. A report prepared for the Eastern Ontario Forest Group. Only a few large hemlock stands remain, although there are many scatted trees through the remaining forests.

Savannas, Barrens, and Rock Outcrop Plant Communities of North America. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. Generally speaking, settlers cleared the deeper pockets of soil, and the clay plains. This produced the distinctive landscape with fields surrounded by forested uplands. The stone piles along the edge of the field illustrate the labour involved in creating agricultural land here. The many outcrops of Canadian shield in fields are also a reminder of just how close to the surface bed rock remains. The Mississippi River and the Rideau River have extensive areas of wetland. The less flooded areas tend to have silver maple swamp, while lower on the shoreline are marshes and aquatic plants. One of the largest wetlands is the Innisville wetland, a provincially significant wetland that formed upstream from Mississippi Lake. Other familiar wetlands include the Tay Marsh (south of Perth) and The Swale (near Smiths Falls). Both rivers are popular with canoeists and naturalists. Smaller wetlands occur throughout the county; many are produced by beavers. Beaver ponds are an important as they provide habitat for a great many kinds of species, including frogs, turtles, otters, muskrats and migratory waterfowl. Beaver ponds provide a cycle of flooding, from shallow water through to wet meadow, and most phases of pond ecology can be seen driving the township roads.Keddy, P.A. 2008. Earth, Water, Fire. An Ecological Profile of Lanark County. General Store Publishing House, Refrew, Ontario. Figure 2. Owing to its location‚Äîthe combination of two large rivers, wetlands and forests‚Äîthe county has a rich array of wildlife, and wildlife viewing is a popular activity. Significant animal species include the black rat snake (now officially renamed the Gray ratsnake by experts on this species) and the Blanding's turtle. Transportation The north-south Ontario Highway 7 passes through the township from Perth towards Carleton Place. The east-west County Road 43 goes between Perth and Smiths Falls.

It is located in the towns of Peterborough and Temple, and is centered on Pack Monadnock, a mountain. Description The park was established in 1891 when atop Pack Monadnock were donated to New Hampshire. The name Pack comes from an Indian word meaning \\"little\\" and is used in comparison to nearby Mount Monadnock. Pack Monadnock has a paved auto road to the top and is the former site of two hotels. It has a renovated fire tower at the summit which is staffed seasonally. The park has expanded over the years with land donations and purchases. Until 1901, cattle were driven by foot from Massachusetts farms for summer grazing on open pasture extending nearly to the summit. Virtually all the pastures are now overgrown with forest, as little farming is done in the region. The park is named for James Miller, a Peterborough native who was a brigadier general in the United States Army during the War of 1812 and became the first Governor of Arkansas Territory. The area is popular with hikers. The Wapack Trail runs through the park, crossing over Pack Monadnock. In 2007, the state created Temple Mountain State Reservation on the south side of NH Route 101 across from the Miller State Park entrance, when it bought around the closed Temple Mountain Ski Area.

The resin, dissolved in essential oils, is a viscous, sticky, colourless or yellowish liquid that turns to a transparent yellowish mass when the essential oils have been allowed to evaporate. Canada balsam is amorphous when dried. Since it does not crystallize with age, its optical properties do not deteriorate. However, it has poor thermal and solvent resistance. Uses Slide of 60-year-old holotype specimen of a flatworm (Lethacotyle fijiensis) permanently mounted in Canada balsam Due to its high optical quality and the similarity of its refractive index to that of crown glass (n = 1.55), purified and filtered Canada balsam was traditionally used in optics as an invisible- when-dry glue for glass, such as lens elements. Other optical elements can be cemented with Canada balsam, such as two prisms bonded to form a beam splitter. Balsam was phased out as an optical adhesive during World War II, in favour of polyester, epoxy, and urethane-based adhesives. In modern optical manufacturing, UV-cured epoxies are often used to bond lens elements. Canada balsam was also commonly used for making permanent microscope slides. From about 1830 molten Canada balsam was used for microscope slides, then Canada balsam in solution was introduced in 1843, becoming popular in the 1850s. In biology, for example, it can be used to conserve microscopic samples by sandwiching the sample between a microscope slide and a glass coverslip, using Canada balsam to glue the arrangement together and enclose the sample to conserve it. Xylene balsam, Canada balsam dissolved in xylene, is also used for preparing slide mounts. Some workers prefer terpene resin for slide mounts, as it is both less acidic and cheaper than balsam. Synthetic resins have largely replaced organic balsams for such applications. Another important application of Canada balsam is in the construction of the Nicol prism. A Nicol prism consists of a calcite crystal cut into two halves. Canada balsam is placed between the two layers. Calcite is an anisotropic crystal and has different refractive indices for rays polarized along directions parallel and perpendicular to its optic axis. These rays with differing refractive indices are known as the ordinary and extraordinary rays. The refractive index for Canada balsam is in between the refractive index for the ordinary and extraordinary rays. Hence the ordinary ray will be totally internally reflected. The emergent ray will be linearly polarized, and traditionally this has been one of the popular ways of producing polarized light. Some other uses (traditional and current) include: * in geology, it is used as a common thin section cement and glue and for refractive-index studies and tests, such as the Becke line test; * to fix scratches in glass (car glass, for instance) as invisibly as possible; * in oil painting, to achieve glow and facilitate fusion; * in Buckley's cough syrup.

Description  Balsam fir is a small to medium-size evergreen tree typically tall, occasionally reaching a height of . The narrow conic crown consists of dense, dark-green leaves. The bark on young trees is smooth, grey, and with resin blisters (which tend to spray when ruptured), becoming rough and fissured or scaly on old trees. The leaves are flat and needle-like, long, dark green above often with a small patch of stomata near the tip, and two white stomatal bands below, and a slightly notched tip. They are arranged spirally on the shoot, but with the leaf bases twisted so that the leaves appear to be in two more-or-less horizontal rows on either side of the shoot. The needles become shorter and thicker the higher they are on the tree. The seed cones are erect, long, dark purple, ripening brown and disintegrating to release the winged seeds in September. = Medicinal = For thousands of years Native Americans used Balsam fir for medicinal and therapeutic purposes. The needles are digested directly off the tree by many animals and humans. Higher content dosage is ingested in tea. Balsam Fir contains vitamin C, which has been studied for its effects on bacterial and viral infections. = Reproduction = The male reproductive organs generally develop more rapidly and appear sooner than the female organs. The male organs contain microsporangia which divide to form sporogenous tissue, composed of cells which become archesporial cells. These develop into microspores, or pollen-mother cells, once they are rounded and filled with starch grains. When the microspores undergo meiosis in the spring, four haploid microspores are produced which eventually become pollen grains. Once the male strobilus has matured the microsporangia are exposed at which point the pollen is released. The female megasporangiate is larger than the male. It contains bracts and megasporophylls, each of which contains two ovules, arranged in a spiral. These then develop a nucellus in which a mother cell is formed. Meiosis occurs and a megaspore is produced as the first cell of the megagametophyte. As cell division takes place the nucleus of the megaspore thickens, and cell differentiation occurs to produce prothallial tissue containing an ovum. The remaining undifferentiated cells then form the endosperm. When the male structure releases its pollen grains, some fall onto the female strobilus and reach the ovule. At this point the pollen tube begins to generate, and eventually the sperm and egg meet at which point fertilization occurs.  Varieties  There are two varieties: * Abies balsamea var. balsamea (balsam fir) ‚Äì bracts subtending seed scales short, not visible on the closed cones. Most of the species' range. * Abies balsamea var. phanerolepis (bracted balsam fir or Canaan fir) ‚Äì bracts subtending seed scales longer, visible on the closed cone. The southeast of the species' range, from southernmost Quebec to West Virginia. The name Canaan fir derives from one of its native localities, the Canaan Valley in West Virginia. Some botanists regard this variety as a natural hybrid between balsam fir and Fraser fir (Abies fraseri), which occurs further south in the Appalachian mountains.  Ecology  Balsam fir krummholz on Mount Hight, New Hampshire Balsam firs tend to grow in cool climates, ideally with a mean annual temperature of , with consistent moisture at their roots. They typically grow in the following four forest types: * Swamp ‚Äì swamp forest types never completely dry out, so balsam firs have constant access to water. The ground is covered in sphagnum and other mosses. In swamps, balsam firs grow densely and slowly, and are slender. * Flat ‚Äì sometimes referred to as \\"dry swamps,\\" these areas are better drained than swamps but still retain moisture well. Fern moss covers the ground and there is a possibility of ground rot. In flat areas balsam fir grows fast, tall, and large, mixed with red spruce. * Hardwood slope ‚Äì ground rot is common in this well-drained area, and leaf litter covers the forest floor. Balsam firs grow fast, tall, and large along with big hardwood trees such as yellow birch, sugar maple and beech. * Mountain top ‚Äì On mountain tops, stands of balsam fir occasionally develop fir waves. They often grow at an elevation of in pure strands, or in association with black spruce, white spruce, and trembling aspen. The development is similar to that in swamps with slow growth resulting in slender, short trees. Some of the low branches touch the ground, and may grow roots to produce an independent tree. The foliage is browsed by moose and deer. The seeds are eaten by American red squirrels, grouse, and pine mice; the tree also provides food for crossbills and chickadees, as well as shelter for moose, snowshoe hares, white-tailed deer, ruffed grouse, and other small mammals and songbirds. The needles are eaten by some lepidopteran caterpillars, for example the Io moth (Automeris io). Abies balsamea is one of the most cold- hardy trees known, surviving at temperatures as low as (USDA Hardiness Zone 2). Specimens even showed no ill effects when immersed in liquid nitrogen at . = Pests = The balsam fir is the preferred main host of the eastern spruce budworm, which is a major destructive pest throughout the eastern United States and Canada. During cyclical population outbreaks, major defoliation of the balsam fir can occur, which may significantly reduce radial growth.Blais, J.R. 1958b. The vulnerability of balsam fir to spruce budworm attack in northwestern Ontario, with special reference to the physiological age of the tree. For. Chron. 34(4):405‚Äì422. This can kill the tree. An outbreak in Quebec in 1957 killed over 75% of balsam fir in some stands.Blais, J.R.; Martineau, R. 1960. A recent spruce budworm outbreak in the lower St. Lawrence and Gasp√© Peninsula with reference to aerial spraying operations. For. Chron. 36(3):209‚Äì224.  Cultivation  =Christmas trees= Both varieties of the species are very popular as Christmas trees, particularly in the northeastern United States. Balsam firs cut for Christmas are not taken from the forest, but are grown on large plantations. The balsam fir is one of the greatest exports of Quebec and New England. It is celebrated for its rich green needles, natural conical shape, and needle retention after being cut, and it is notably the most fragrant of all Christmas tree varieties. Many of these plantations are family farms handed down from generation to generation. The techniques of shearing, growing, and other cultivation secretly passed down from grandparents to grandchildren. Families like the Rousseau's of Quebec, Rose of New Brunswick, and Kessler's (North Pole Xmas Trees) of New Hampshire have kept family traditions for almost a century. The balsam fir was used six times for the US Capitol Christmas Tree between 1964 and 2019. In northern areas of Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin balsam fir branches (boughs) are used to make Christmas wreaths. =Horticulture= Abies balsamea is also grown as an ornamental tree for parks and gardens. Very hardy down to or below, it requires a sheltered spot in full sun. The dwarf cultivar A. balsamea 'Hudson‚Äô (Hudson fir), grows to only tall by broad, and has distinctive blue-green foliage with pale undersides. It does not bear cones. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Other cultivars include:- * ‚ÄòAngustata‚Äô * 'Argentea' * 'Brachylepis' * 'Coerulea' * 'Columnaris' * 'Glauca' * 'Globosa' * 'Longifolia' * 'Lutescens' * 'Macrocarpa' * 'Marginata' * 'Nana' * 'Nudicaulis' * 'Paucifolia' * 'Prostrata' * 'Pyramidalis' * 'Variegata' * 'Versicolor' http://site.ebrary.com/lib/umich/reader.action?docID=10231274}''  Other uses  Balsam fir essential oil in clear glass vial The resin is used to produce Canada balsam, and was traditionally used as a cold remedy and as a glue for glasses, optical instrument components, and for preparing permanent mounts of microscope specimens. Given its use as a traditional remedy and the relatively high ascorbic acid content of its needles, historian Jacques Mathieu has argued that the balsam fir was the \\"aneda\\" that cured scurvy during the second expedition into Canada of Jacques Cartier.Mathieu, Jacques. L'Annedda: L'arbre de vie (Quebec: Septentrion, 2009). The wood is milled for framing lumber (part of SPF lumber), siding and pulped for paper manufacture. Balsam fir oil is an EPA approved nontoxic rodent repellent. The balsam fir is also used as an air freshener and as incense. Prior to the availability of foam rubber and air mattresses, balsam fir boughs were a preferred mattress in places where trees greatly outnumbered campers. Many fir limbs are vertically bowed from alternating periods of downward deformation from snow loading and new growth reaching upward for sunlight. Layers of inverted freshly cut limbs from small trees created a pleasantly fragrant mattress lifting bedding off the wet ground; and the bowed green limbs were springs beneath the soft needles. Upper layers of limbs were placed with the cut ends of the limbs touching the earth to avoid uncomfortably sharp spots and sap.Thoreau, Henry David The Maine Woods Apollo edition (1966) Thomas Y. Crowell Company The Native Americans used it for a variety of medicinal purposes.  Tree emblem  Balsam fir is the provincial tree of New Brunswick.

The park is a small circle across, with a total area of . It is the smallest park in the world, according to the Guinness Book of Records, which first granted it this recognition in 1971. History The park in summer 2004 (before remodeling) In 1948 the site that would become Mill Ends Park was intended to be the site for a light pole. When the pole failed to appear and weeds sprouted in the opening, Dick Fagan, a columnist for the Oregon Journal, planted flowers in the hole and named it after his column in the paper, \\"Mill Ends\\" (a reference to leftover irregular pieces of wood at lumber mills). Fagan's office in the Journal building overlooked the median in the middle of the busy thoroughfare that ran in front of the building (then known as SW Front Avenue). The park was dedicated on St. Patrick's Day, 1976, as \\"the only leprechaun colony west of Ireland,\\" according to Fagan. =Legend= The park in November 2011 Fagan told this story of the park's origin: He looked out the window and spotted a leprechaun digging in the hole. He ran down and grabbed the leprechaun, which meant that he had earned a wish. Fagan said he wished for a park of his own, but since he had not specified the size of the park in his wish, the leprechaun gave him the hole. Over the next two decades, Fagan often featured the park and its head leprechaun in his whimsical column. Fagan claimed to be the only person who could see the head leprechaun, Patrick O'Toole. Fagan published a threat by O'Toole about the 11 o'clock curfew set on all city parks. O'Toole dared the mayor to try to evict him and his followers from Mill Ends and threatened a leprechaun curse on him should he attempt to do so. Subsequently, no legal action was taken, and the leprechauns were allowed to stay in the park after hours. =Evolution= The park during Occupy Portland, December 2011 Fagan died of cancer in 1969, but the park lives on, cared for by others. It was named an official city park in 1976. The small circle has featured many unusual items through the decades, including a swimming pool for butterflies‚Äîcomplete with diving board‚Äîa horseshoe, a fragment of the Journal building, and a miniature Ferris wheel, which was delivered by a full-size crane. On St. Patrick's Day, 2001, the park was visited by a tiny leprechaun leaning against his pot of gold and children's drawings of four-leaf clovers and leprechauns. The park continues to be the site of St. Patrick's Day festivities. The events held here include concerts by Clan Macleay Pipe Band, picnics, and rose plantings by the Junior Rose Festival Court. In February 2006, the park was temporarily relocated during road construction to a planter outside the World Trade Center Portland, about from its permanent location. It was returned to its home‚Äînow named SW Naito Parkway‚Äîon March 16, 2007, in true St. Patrick's Day style with the Royal Rosarians, bagpipers, and the Fagan family, including Dick's widow, Katherine, in attendance. The legend lives on in the Fagan family. One of Fagan's sons, Pat Fagan, lives in Gladstone and has enjoyed sharing the park with his own son. \\"He loves it,\\" Pat Fagan said. \\"It's still the largest leprechaun colony west of Ireland.\\" In December 2011, plastic army men figures and small signs were placed in Mill Ends as a tongue- in-cheek flash mob demonstration for Occupy Portland. One man, Cameron Scott Whitten, was arrested after he was asked by police to move from the sidewalk and refused. In March 2013, the park's tree was stolen. Officials planted a replacement tree, and one day later, a passerby found what appeared to be the stolen tree lying next to the new one. The next month, officials from Burntwood, England, complained to Guinness, claiming that Mill Ends was not large enough to be a park and that Prince's Park, smallest in the UK, should hold the world record since it \\"has a fence around it\\" among other features. In response, volunteers erected a fence (several inches tall) around and stationed an \\"armed guard\\" in the park. In 2018, Portland Parks & Recreation installed a miniaturized park sign and planted miniature roses. In December 2019, the tree was cut down by an unknown vandal. However, the tree was soon replaced.https://www.koin.com/local/multnomah-county/tree-cut-down-at-worlds- smallest-park-in-portland/ See also *Forest Park, also in Portland, among the largest urban forests in the country at over *Waldo Park, another small park consisting of a tree, located in nearby Salem References External links * *Mills End Park: World's Smallest Park.

It incorporated former Byzantine territories of the Diocese of the East, organized soon after the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the mid-7th century, which was completed at the decisive Battle of Yarmouk. The term \\"Bilad al-Sham\\" means \\"land to the north\\", literally \\"land on the left-hand\\" relative to someone in the Hejaz facing east (, , correspondingly means \\"land of the right hand\\"). Today, Bilaad al-Sham represents the countries of Palestine, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria  History  The name given to the Levant by the Arab conquerors was al-ShƒÅm (, \\"The North\\").Article \\"Al-ShƒÅm\\" by C.E. Bosworth, Encyclopaedia of Islam, Volume 9 (1997), page 261. See also Name of Syria. The population of the region did not become predominantly Muslim and Arab in identity until nearly a millennium after the conquest. Following the Muslim conquest, Mu'awiya ibn Abi Sufyan (602‚Äì680 CE) of the Banu Umayya clan governed the Syrian region for twenty years, and developed the province as his family's power base. Relying on Syrian military support, Mu'awiya emerged as the victor in the First Fitna (656‚Äì661) and established the Umayyad Caliphate (661). During the Umayyad period, al-Sham was divided into five or military districts. The initial districts were Jund al-Urdunn (, \\"military district of the Jordan\\"), Jund Dimashq (, \\"military district of Damascus\\"), Jund Hims (, \\"military district of Homs\\"), Jund Filastin (, \\"military district of Palestine\\"), and later, Jund Qinnasrin (, \\"military district of Qinnasrin\\") was carved out of the northern part of Jund Hims. Under the Umayyads, the city of Damascus was the capital of the Caliphate and Syria formed the Caliphate's metropolitan province; likewise, the elite Syrian army, the Ahl al-Sham (), formed the main pillar of the Umayyad government. Syria became much less important under the Abbasid Caliphate, which succeeded the Umayyads in 750. The Abbasids moved the capital first to Kufa, and then to Baghdad and Samarra, all of which were in Iraq, which consequently became their most important province. The mainly Arab Syrians were marginalized by Iranian and Turkish forces who rose to power under the Abbasids, a trend which also expressed itself on a cultural level. Under Harun al-Rashid (), the northern parts of Jund Qinnasrin were detached to form a new jund, called al-Awasim (), which served as a second line of defence against Byzantine attacks, behind the actual frontier zone of the Thughur. From 878 until 905, Syria came under the effective control of the Tulunids of Egypt, but Abbasid control was re-established soon thereafter. It lasted until the 940s, when the province was partitioned between the Hamdanid Emirate of Aleppo in the north and Ikhshidid-controlled Egypt in the south. In the 960s the Byzantine Empire under Nikephoros II Phokas conquered much of northern Syria, and Aleppo became a Byzantine tributary, while the southern provinces passed to the Fatimid Caliphate after its conquest of Egypt in 969. The division of Syria into northern and southern parts would persist, despite political changes, until the Mamluk conquest in the late 13th century.

Sullivan served as premier for ten years and fought for PEI's rights in Canada. He protested the federal government's failure to fulfill the terms of confederation on which the island had joined the dominion in 1873. In 1886, he petitioned the Imperial government in London protesting Canada's delinquency in respect to promises to ensure communication lines between the island and the rest of the country but the problem remained unresolved until the 1900s.

It is a larval host for the Nessus Sphinx Moth (Amphion floridensis) and the Mournful Sphinx Moth (Enyo lugubris). Taxonomy and pathology Although in the same genus Vitis with the other grapevine species, muscadines belong to a separate subgenus, Muscadinia (the other grapevine species belong to subgenus Euvitis), and some have suggested giving it standing as a genus of its own. Some taxonomists have also suggested splitting two additional species off from Vitis rotundifolia, Vitis munsoniana and Vitis popenoei. All have 40 chromosomes, rather than 38, are generally not cross-compatible with Euvitis species, and most hybrids between the subgenera are sterile. A few are moderately fertile, and have been used in breeding. A commercially available Euvitis x Muscadinia hybrid is the Southern Home cultivar. Although muscadines are hearty grapes with tough skin that protects them from many plant diseases, these grapes appear to be susceptible to parasitic nematodes. Cultivars North Carolina muscadine grapes There are about 152 muscadine cultivars grown in the Southern states. These include bronze, black and red varieties and consist of common grapes and patented grapes. Unlike most cultivated grapevines, many muscadine cultivars are pistillate, requiring a pollenizer to set fruit. A few, such as 'Carlos' and 'Noble', are perfect-flowered, produce fruit with their own pollen, and may also pollinate pistillate cultivars. Muscadine grape cultivars may have low or inconsistent yields, small berries, flavor and thick skin unsuitable to consumer acceptance, and disease susceptibility. Cultivars tend to be developed either for a limited fresh market or for winemaking. For consumer acceptance, fresh market grapes need to be large, sweet, and with relatively thin skin, whereas those for wine, juice or jelly need high yields of high-sugar, color-stable berries. Fresh-market cultivars include Black Beauty, Carlos, Cowart, Flowers, Fry, Granny Val, Ison, James, Jumbo, Magnolia, Memory (first found on T.S. Memory's farm in 1868 in Whiteville, NC), Mish, Nesbitt, Noble, Scuppernong, Summit, Supreme, and Thomas.Growing Muscadine Grapes in Oklahoma Produced by the University of Florida, the cultivar, 'Southern Home', contains both muscadine and subgenus Vitis in its background. Crops can be started in 3‚Äì5 years. Commercial yields of 20‚Äì45 tonnes per hectare (8‚Äì18 tons per acre) are possible. Muscadines grow best in fertile sandy loam and alluvial soils. They grow wild in well-drained bottom lands that are not subject to extended drought or waterlogging. They are also resistant to pests and diseases, including Pierce's disease, which can destroy other grape species. Muscadine is one of the grape species most resistant to Phylloxera, an insect that can kill roots of grapevines. =Appellations= Some muscadines in a bowl; the green grapes are scuppernongs Appellations producing Muscadine wines: * America (Country Appellation) * Alabama (State Appellation) * Arkansas (State Appellation) * Florida (State Appellation) * Georgia (State Appellation) * Louisiana (State Appellation) * Mississippi (State Appellation) * North Carolina (State Appellation) * South Carolina (State Appellation) * Tennessee (State Appellation) * Texas (State Appellation) * Virginia (State Appellation) Nutrients 100 grams of muscadine grapes contain the following nutrients according to the USDA: * Energy: 57 kilocalories * Fats: 0.47 g * Carbohydrates: 13.93 g * Dietary Fiber: 3.9 g * Protein: 0.81 g * Calcium: 37 mg * Phosphorus: 24 mg * Potassium: 203 mg * Sodium: 1 mg * Vitamin C (total ascorbic acid): 6.5 mg * Riboflavin: 1.5 mg Consumer research Consumer research indicates that the thick skins and variable in-season quality of fresh muscadine grapes are significant deterrents to retail acceptance. Resveratrol and other polyphenols The wild progenitor of the muscadine grape still grows freely in the southeastern United States, such as near Indiantown, South Carolina. As muscadine grapes are notable for their highly pigmented, thick skins in which the content of polyphenols is known to be high, there is active research interest to define these phytochemicals. One report indicated that muscadine grapes contained high concentrations of resveratrol, but subsequent studies have found no or little resveratrol in muscadine grapes. Other muscadine polyphenols include: * anthocyanins such as delphinidin and petunidin * tannins * quercetin * flavan-3-ols (catechins, particularly in seeds) * gallic acid * ellagic acid (particularly in skin) * ellagic acid glycosides * ellagitannins * myricetin (particularly in leaves) * kaempferol The rank order of total phenolic content among muscadine components was found to be seeds higher than skins higher than leaves higher than pulp.

Biography =Early years= Peter Lombard was born in LumellognoH√∂dl, in Biografisch-Bibliografisches Kirchenlexikon. (then a rural commune, now a quartiere of Novara, Piedmont), in northwestern Italy, to a poor family.The few known facts of Peter's life are presented in Philippe Delhaye, Pierre Lombard: sa vie, ses ≈ìuvres, sa morale (Paris/Montreal) 1961. His date of birth was likely between 1095 and 1100. His education most likely began in Italy at the cathedral schools of Novara and Lucca. The patronage of Odo, bishop of Lucca, who recommended him to Bernard of Clairvaux, allowed him to leave Italy and further his studies at Reims and Paris. Petrus Lombardus studied first in the cathedral school at Reims, where Magister Alberich and Lutolph of Novara were teaching, and arrived in Paris about 1134,H√∂dl where Bernard recommended himIn a surviving letter, Ep. 410, Opera omnia viii.391, noted by H√∂dl to the canons of the church of St. Victor. =Professor= In Paris, where he spent the next decade teaching at the cathedral school of Notre Dame, he came into contact with Peter Abelard and Hugh of St. Victor, who were among the leading theologians of the time. There are no proven facts relating to his whereabouts in Paris until 1142 when he became recognized as writer and teacher. Around 1145, Peter became a \\"magister\\", or professor, at the cathedral school of Notre Dame in Paris. Peter's means of earning a living before he began to derive income as a teacher and from his canon's prebend is shrouded in uncertainty. Lombard's style of teaching gained quick acknowledgment. It can be surmised that this attention is what prompted the canons of Notre Dame to ask him to join their ranks. He was considered a celebrated theologian by 1144. The Parisian school of canons had not included among their number a theologian of high regard for some years. The canons of Notre Dame, to a man, were members of the Capetian dynasty, relatives of families closely aligned to the Capetians by blood or marriage, scions of the √éle-de-France or eastern Loire Valley nobility, or relatives of royal officials. In contrast, Peter had no relatives, ecclesiastical connections, and no political patrons in France. It seems that he must have been invited by the canons of Notre Dame solely for his academic merit. =Priesthood and Bishop of Paris= He became a subdeacon in 1147. Possibly he was present at the consistory of Paris in 1147, and certainly he attended the Council of Reims in 1148, where Pope Eugenius III was present at the synod which examined Gilbert de la Porr√©e and √âon de l'√âtoile. Peter was among the signers of the act condemning Gilbert's teachings.H√∂dl. At some time after 1150 he became a deacon, then an archdeacon, maybe as early as 1152. He was ordained priest some time before 1156. On 28 July 1159, at the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul, he was consecrated as bishop of Paris. Walter of St Victor accused Peter of obtaining the office by simony.In his polemic Contra quatuor labyrinthos Franciae II.4. The more usual story is that Philip, younger brother of Louis VII and archdeacon of Notre-Dame, was elected by the canons but declined in favor of Peter, his teacher. His reign as bishop was brief.His successor, Maurice de Sully, was bishop by the end of 1160. He died on either 21 or 22 July 1160. Little can be ascertained about Lombard's administrative style or objectives because he left behind so few episcopal acta. He was succeeded by Maurice de Sully, the builder of the Cathedral of Notre Dame. His tomb in the church of Saint-Marcel in Paris was destroyed during the French Revolution, but a transcription of his epitaph survives. Writings Sententiae, 1280 circa, Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana, Florence Peter Lombard wrote commentaries on the Psalms and the Pauline epistles; however, his most famous work by far was Libri Quatuor Sententiarum, or the Four Books of Sentences, which became the standard textbook of theology at the medieval universities. From the 1220s until the 16th century, no work of Christian literature, except for the Bible itself, was commented upon more frequently. All the major medieval thinkers, from Albert the Great and Thomas Aquinas to William of Ockham and Gabriel Biel, were influenced by it. Even the young Martin Luther still wrote glosses on the Sentences, and John Calvin quoted from it over 100 times in his Institutes. Though the Four Books of Sentences formed the framework upon which four centuries of scholastic interpretation of Christian dogma was based, rather than a dialectical work itself, the Four Books of Sentences is a compilation of biblical texts, together with relevant passages from the Church Fathers and many medieval thinkers, on virtually the entire field of Christian theology as it was understood at the time. Peter Lombard's magnum opus stands squarely within the pre-scholastic exegesis of biblical passages, in the tradition of Anselm of Laon who taught through quotations from authorities.This is a central point of Delhaye 1961, who sees Abelard, rather than Peter, as the founder of scholasticism. It stands out as the first major effort to bring together commentaries on the full range of theological issues, arrange the material in a systematic order, and attempt to reconcile them where they appeared to defend different viewpoints. The Sentences starts with the Trinity in Book I, moves on to creation in Book II, treats Christ, the saviour of the fallen creation, in Book III, and deals with the sacraments, which mediate Christ's grace, in Book IV. Doctrine Peter Lombard's most famous and most controversial doctrine in the Sentences was his identification of charity with the Holy Spirit in Book I, distinction 17. According to this doctrine, when the Christian loves God and his neighbour, this love literally is God; he becomes divine and is taken up into the life of the Trinity. This idea, in its inchoate form, can be extrapolated from certain remarks of St. Augustine of Hippo (cf. De Trinitate xiii.7.11). Although this was never declared unorthodox, few theologians have been prepared to follow Peter Lombard in this aspect of his teaching. Compare Pope Benedict XVI's encyclical Deus caritas est, 2006. Also in the Sentences was the doctrine that marriage was consensual and need not be consummated to be considered perfect, unlike Gratian's analysis (see sponsalia de futuro). Lombard's interpretation was later endorsed by Pope Alexander III, and had a significant impact on Church interpretation of marriage. He emphasized the reciprocal consent of the parties is sufficiently constitutive of an absolutely indissoluble marriage, and is its only cause independent of sexual intercourse.

Alexander was born in Summerside, the son of James Warburton, who was a member of the provincial assembly. Named after Lieut. Governor, Sir Alexander Bannerman, he was educated in Summerside, at St. Dunstan's College, King's College in Nova Scotia and the University of Edinburgh. He was called to the bar in 1879. He was a director for the Patriot Publishing Company and the Eastern Assurance Company of Canada. Warburton was first elected to the province's House of Assembly in 1891 as a Liberal, and was re-elected in 1893 and 1897. He became premier of the province on October 27, 1897, when his predecessor resigned to move to British Columbia. Warburton only served in the position for eight months until resigning in June 1898 to accept a judicial appointment. In the 1908 federal election, he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP), but lost his seat in the 1911 election that defeated the Laurier Liberals. He attempted to return to the House but was again defeated in the 1917 election. In 1920, Warburton returned to the bench as a judge on probate court and held that position until his death. Warburton wrote two books on the history of the island, Prince Edward Island, Past and Present in 1905, and A History of Prince Edward Island which was published posthumously in 1923.

An ex parte decision is one decided by a judge without requiring all of the parties to the dispute to be present. In English law and its derivatives, namely Australian, Canadian, South African, Indian, and U.S. legal doctrines, ex parte means a legal proceeding brought by one party in the absence of and without representation of or notification to the other party. The term is also used more loosely to refer to improper unilateral contacts with a court, arbitrator, or represented party without notice to the other party or counsel for that party. The phrase was common in the titles of habeas corpus and judicial review cases until the end of the twentieth century, because those cases were originally brought by the Crown on behalf of the claimant. In Commonwealth common law jurisdictions, the title typically appeared as R v (Defendant), ex parte (Claimant); in the US, this was shortened to Ex parte (Claimant). A proceeding in an executive agency to establish a right, such as patent prosecution, can also be ex parte.John A. Burgess, \\"Demise of Res Judicata in Ex Parte Patent Office Practice,\\" Notre Dame Law Review, 1-1-1968 Australia In Australian law ex parte is used in two senses. The predominant use is to refer to an ex parte hearing, being one which is heard in the absence of one or more parties. Where proceedings are heard ex parte, a high degree of candour is required, including full and fair disclosure of facts adverse to the moving party. A failure to make such disclosure is ordinarily sufficient to warrant discharge of such order as might be made. at [15] per Gageler J. The other use means 'on the application of' when used in the case name where prerogative relief is sought, such as a writ of prohibition, certiorari or mandamus. Thus for example the case name in the Boilermakers' case is R v Kirby; Ex parte Boilermakers' Society of Australia as the case concerned a writ of prohibition that was sought against Kirby, Dunphy and Ashburner, who were judges of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, on the application of the Boilermakers Society of Australia. While the case name is 'ex parte' it was not heard in the absence of a party, with the judges being represented by D I Menzies QC who also represented the Commonwealth Attorney-General.. Similarly the case of Re Wakim; Ex parte McNally concerned application of McNally for a writ of prohibition in relation to proceedings in the Federal Court that were commenced by Wakim. Both McNally and Wakim appeared in the High Court. There was however no appearance for the first respondents in the bankruptcy cases, the judges of the Federal Court. United States In the United States, the availability of ex parte orders or decrees from both federal and state courts is sharply limited by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, which provide that a person shall not be deprived of any interest in liberty or property without due process of law. In practice this has been interpreted to require adequate notice of the request for judicial relief and an opportunity to be heard concerning the merits of such relief. A court order issued on the basis of an ex parte proceeding, therefore, will necessarily be temporary and interim in nature, and the person(s) affected by the order must be given an opportunity to contest the appropriateness of the order before it can be made permanent. There are exceptions to this. The secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which grants the National Security Agency permission to perform certain types of electronic surveillance, operates on a permanent ex parte basis.Secret-court judges upset at portrayal of ‚Äòcollaboration‚Äô with government, Washington Post, 30 June 2013. Retrieved 30 June 2013. Parties other than the government are not normally permitted to argue in front of the court, though it is possible for the recipients of court orders to challenge them in other ways.Response of the Honorable Reggie B. Walton of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to Senator Patrick Leahy, July 29, 2013. This is as directed by statute.See for example 50 U.S.C. 1805 Most US states also allow for initial hearings regarding civil protection orders to be done ex parte; however, a second hearing is usually set a short time later to allow the alleged abuser to answer for the allegations. An article about such restraining orders, authored by Debra Stark and Jessica Choplin, indicated this concept in its title, \\"Seeing the Wrecking Ball in Motion: Ex Parte Protection Orders and the Realities of Domestic Violence\\". The idea is that ex parte orders must be used in a \\"wrecking ball\\" type of situation, where giving advance notice to a respondent would allow him or her to cause irreversible damage before the notice takes effect. Stark and Choplin argued that such damage would be possible if ex parte orders were not used for restraining orders, and that the very fact of an order being issued might increase the chance of the respondent causing damage. The phrase has also traditionally been used in the captions of petitions for the writ of habeas corpus, which were (and in some jurisdictions, still are) styled as \\"Ex parte Doe,\\" where Doe was the name of the petitioner who was alleged to be wrongfully held. As the Supreme Court's description of nineteenth century practice in Ex parte Milligan shows, however, such proceedings were not ex parte in any significant sense. The prisoner's ex parte application sought only an order requiring the person holding the prisoner to appear before the court to justify the prisoner's detention; no order requiring the freeing of a prisoner could be given until after the jailer was given the opportunity to contest the prisoner's claims at a hearing on the merits. =State trial courts= State courts vary in their use of ex parte proceedings (for example, in custody cases, replevin cases and other civil matters), though most have it in one form or another. For example, in the States of California and Illinois, ex parte proceedings are available if notice is given before 10 a.m. the previous court day, or even shorter upon showing of emergency need.See California Rule of Court 3.1200, et seq As most courts in these two states hold law and motion hearings in the early morning, this notice is typically confirmed by facsimile although oral notice may be effective. Some courts in California have procedures to allow opponents to appear telephonically, while other courts do not allow any oral argument and only consider written papers.See California Rule of Court 3.1213, Rule 3.1203. Time of notice to other parties. In California, the party who files an ex parte application must file a declaration showing compliance with these requirements, and no relief may be granted absent such declaration.California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1204 In addition to the notice requirements, an ex parte application must contain an affirmative actual showing in a declaration based on personal knowledge of \\"irreparable harm, immediate danger, or any other statutory basis for granting relief ex parte\\".California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1202 See also *Ex parte Endo *Ex parte Merryman *Ex parte Milligan *Ex parte Quirin *Inter partes *Temporary injunction *R v Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex parte Pinochet *R v Burgess; Ex parte Henry *R v Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration; Ex parte BHP *R v Department of Trade and Industry, ex parte Broadcasting, Entertainment, Cinematographic and Theatre Union *R. v.

The first creation, on 30 October 1451, was for John Talbot, 1st Baron Lisle. Upon the death of his son Thomas at the Battle of Nibley Green in 1470, the viscountcy became extinct and the barony abeyant. In 1475, the abeyance terminated in favour of Thomas' sister, Elizabeth Talbot, 3rd Baroness Lisle, wife of Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Lisle. Sir Edward was created Viscount Lisle on 28 June 1483, but the title became extinct on the death of their son John in 1504. The viscounty now passed to John's posthumous daughter Elizabeth, whose wardship was granted to Sir Charles Brandon. He contracted to marry her, and was created Viscount Lisle on 15 May 1513 in consequence. However, Elizabeth refused to fulfill the marriage contract and the betrothal was annulled. She died in 1519, and the barony passed to her aunt, also named Elizabeth Grey. Her husband, Arthur Plantagenet was created Viscount Lisle on 25 April 1523. He continued to hold the title after her death in about 1525. After Arthur Plantagenet's death in 1542 the viscountcy went to Elizabeth Grey's eldest son by her first marriage, John Dudley, \\"by the right of his mother\\".Loades, David (1996): John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland 1504‚Äì1553, Clarendon Press, , p. 48 He was created Viscount Lisle on 12 March 1542, and later rose to be Duke of Northumberland; but he forfeited his titles upon his execution and attainder in 1553.

She was commissioned in July 1980 and was deployed mainly in the western and southern Pacific, but also voyaged to the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf. She was the second ship in the U.S. Navy to bear this name but the first to be named after Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher. After her decommissioning in 2004, she was sunk in a torpedo test exercise in 2008. Construction Designed and built by Ingalls Shipyards of Litton Industries in Pascagoula, Mississippi, USA, Fletcher was a member of the first major class of surface ships in the United States Navy to be powered by gas turbine engines. Four General Electric LM2500 gas turbine engines, marine versions of those used in DC-10 aircraft, drove the ship at speeds in excess of 30 knots (56 km/h). Twin controllable reversible pitch propellers provided Fletcher with a degree of maneuverability unique among warships of her size. History Commissioned in July 1980, Fletcher was immediately sent to join the Pacific Fleet. Starting in 1982, Fletcher made regular deployments to the western and southern Pacific, with some of those extending into the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf areas. During 1994 and 1995, she was modernized with the vertical launch system, giving her a much broader range of capabilities. A highly versatile multi-mission destroyer, Fletcher was capable of operating independently or in company with Amphibious or Carrier Task Forces. Her main mission was to operate offensively in a Strike Warfare or Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) role. The Tomahawk Weapons Systems provided Fletcher with long range cruise missile capability for use in tactical strike operations. The ship's primary passive ASW sensor was the AN/SQR-19 Tactical Towed Array Sonar (TACTAS). Its active sonar together with the Mk 116 Underwater Fire Control System combined as one of the most advanced underwater detection and fire control systems ever developed. The Naval Tactical Data System (NTDS) provided the ship with faster and more accurate processing of target information. Integration of the ship's digital gun fire control system in the NTDS provided quick reaction in the mission areas of shore bombardment, Anti-Surface, and Anti-Aircraft Warfare. Fletcher was originally armed with an 8-tube ASROC launcher, but was later upgraded with a sixty-one cell Mk 41 Vertical Launching System for firing Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAMs) and Anti-Submarine Rockets (ASROCs). Other weapons included two Mk 45 light weight 5 inch guns, two triple Mk 32 torpedo tubes, and facilities for operating LAMPS helicopters. The ship was also armed with the NATO Sea Sparrow Missile System, a short range, surface- to-air defensive weapon; and the Harpoon Weapon System, a medium range, surface-to-surface, anti-ship cruise missile. For defense against anti-ship missile, Fletcher employed two Mk 15 (PHALANX) 20 mm Close-In Weapons System, SRBOC chaff, and topside armor in addition to the NATO Sea Sparrow Missile System. The AN/SLQ-32 countermeasures set provided Fletcher with additional defense against anti-ship missiles through the use of active electronic countermeasures. Crew comfort and habitability were an integral part of the design. Berthing compartments were spacious and the ship was equipped with amenities not usually found aboard other destroyers, including a crew's gymnasium and an improvised library of sorts with several hundred fiction novels. Although Fletcher was as large as a World War II cruiser, a high degree of automation permitted a crew of 24 officers and 296 enlisted to operate the ship. =Deployment in 1983= On 20 July 1983 the New York Times reported that the Fletcher, along with seven other vessels in the Carrier Battle Group, left San Diego on Friday 15 July 1983 and were headed for the western Pacific when they were rerouted and ordered to steam for Central America to conduct training and flight operations in areas off the coasts of Nicaragua, El Salvador and Honduras as part of major military exercises planned for that summer. The other ships in the battle group were the cruiser Horne, the guided missile destroyer Lynde McCormick, the destroyer Fife, the frigate Marvin Shields, the oiler Wichita, and the support ship Camden. Following the diversion to Central America, Fletcher, along with Battle Group Echo, resumed the planned deployment to the Indian Ocean. Following the regular stops at Pearl Harbor and Subic Bay, Philippines, Fletcher was tasked with steaming down the coast of Vietnam, just outside territorial waters, to affirm the right-of-way of maritime traffic in international waters. Following the transit of the Straits of Malacca, Fletcher spent virtually the entire period in the Indian Ocean on station in the North Arabian Sea, as previously- planned port calls were cancelled due to the changing nature of political and operational matters in the Mid-East. The one exception was an unplanned port call in Port Victoria, Seychelles. Fletcher returned to San Diego on 29 February 1984. =Sea Swap in 2003= On 2 August 2002 USS Fletcher departed Pearl Harbor to begin Sea Swap, an experimental program that calls for a Spruance-class destroyer to deploy and remain on station for more than 400 days. The original Sea Swap Fletcher crew, under the command of Cmdr. Thomas Neal, stopped in Yokosuka, Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore. While in port Singapore, numerous repairs were accomplished as part of an availability period. Fletcher then headed to the Persian Gulf. The original Fletcher team sailed the ship to the Persian Gulf and spent the next four months conducting Maritime Interdiction Operations (MIO) in support of United Nations sanctions on Iraq. The Sea Swap initiative became a reality in January 2003, when the Fletcher crew pulled the ship into Fremantle, Australia, and made preparations to turn it over to the former crew of the USS Kinkaid. After decommissioning Kinkaid, they had embarked a flight to Australia ready to turn over and assume command of Fletcher. Team Kinkaid then made preparations to take Fletcher back to the Persian Gulf for their six-month deployment. The original Fletcher crew then flew back to Pearl Harbor and disassembled to their new duty stations. Team Kinkaid completed a 4-month deployment in the Persian Gulf while the was being prepared for decommissioning. The crew of the Elliot, under the command of CDR John Nolan, then embarked on a flight to Fremantle to receive the Fletcher from Team Kinkaid. Team Elliot was the last crew to embark onboard Fletcher. Team Elliot then completed a final 4-month deployment in the Persian Gulf in 2004, continuing Maritime Interdiction Operations (MIO) in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. =Awards= * Navy Unit Commendation - (16-20 Dec 1998, Jan-May 2003) * Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation - (Jan 1999-Sep 2001, Aug 2000-Jan 2001) * Battle \\"E\\" - (1982, 1994, 2003)https://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=13485 * Coast Guard Unit Commendation - (Jan-Feb 2000) Fate Fletcher was decommissioned and stricken from the Navy list 1 October 2004.

This colourless volatile liquid with an odour resembling ether, is produced on a large scale industrially. Its major application is its use for the production of polyether polyols for use in making polyurethane plastics. It is a chiral epoxide, although it is commonly used as a racemic mixture. This compound is sometimes called 1,2-propylene oxide to distinguish it from its isomer 1,3-propylene oxide, better known as oxetane. Production Industrial production of propylene oxide starts from propylene.Two general approaches are employed, one involving hydrochlorination and the other involving oxidation. In 2005, about half of the world production was through chlorohydrin technology and one half via oxidation routes. The latter approach is growing in importance. =Hydrochlorination route= The traditional route proceeds via the conversion of propene to propylene chlorohydrin according to the following simplified scheme: :450px The mixture of 1-chloro-2-propanol and 2-chloro-1-propanol is then dehydrochlorinated. For example: :330px Lime (calcium hydroxide) is often used to absorb the HCl. =Oxidation of propylene= The other general route to propylene oxide involves oxidation of propylene with an organic peroxide. The reaction follows this stoichiometry: :CH3CH=CH2 \\\\+ RO2H ‚Üí CH3CHCH2O + ROH The process is practiced with four hydroperoxides: *t-Butyl hydroperoxide derived from oxygenation of isobutane, which affords t-butanol. This coproduct can be dehydrated to isobutene, converted to MTBE, an additive for gasoline. * Ethylbenzene hydroperoxide, derived from oxygenation of ethylbenzene, which affords 1-phenylethanol. This coproduct can be dehydrated to give styrene, a useful monomer. *Cumene hydroperoxide derived from oxygenation of cumene (isopropylbenzene), which affords cumyl alcohol. Via dehydration and hydrogenation this coproduct can be recycled back to cumene. This technology was commercialized by Sumitomo Chemical. *Hydrogen peroxide is the oxidant in the hydrogen peroxide to propylene oxide (HPPO) process, catalyzed by a titanium-doped silicalite: *:C3H6 \\\\+ H2O2 ‚Üí C3H6O + H2O In principle, this process produces only water was a side product. In practice, some ring-opened derivatives of PO are generated.  Reactions  Like other epoxides, PO undergoes ring-opening reactions. With water, propylene glycol is produced. With alcohols, reactions, called hydroxylpropylation, analogous to ethoxylation occur. Grignard reagents add to propylene oxide to give secondary alcohols. Some other reactions of propylene oxide include: * Reaction with aluminium oxide at 250‚Äì260 ¬∞C leads to propionaldehyde and a little acetone. * Reaction with silver(I) oxide leads to acetic acid. * Reaction with sodium‚Äìmercury amalgam and water leads to isopropanol. Uses Between 60 and 70% of all propylene oxide is converted to polyether polyols by the process called alkoxylation. These polyols are building blocks in the production of polyurethane plastics. About 20% of propylene oxide is hydrolyzed into propylene glycol, via a process which is accelerated by acid or base catalysis. Other major products are polypropylene glycol, propylene glycol ethers, and propylene carbonate. =Niche uses= Fumigant The United States Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of propylene oxide to pasteurize raw almonds beginning on September 1, 2007, in response to two incidents of contamination by Salmonella in commercial orchards, one incident occurring in Canada and one in the United States. Pistachio nuts can also be subjected to propylene oxide to control Salmonella. Microscopy Propylene oxide is commonly used in the preparation of biological samples for electron microscopy, to remove residual ethanol previously used for dehydration. In a typical procedure, the sample is first immersed in a mixture of equal volumes of ethanol and propylene oxide for 5 minutes, and then four times in pure oxide, 10 minutes each. Safety It is a probable human carcinogen, and is included into the List of IARC Group 2B carcinogens. Natural occurrence In 2016 it was reported that propylene oxide was detected in Sagittarius B2, a cloud of gas in the Milky Way weighing three million solar masses. It is the first chiral molecule to be detected in space.

It was created in 1797 for Francis Mathew, 1st Viscount Landaff, who had previously represented County Tipperary in the Irish House of Commons. He had already been created Baron Landaff, of Thomastown in the County of Tipperary, in 1783, and Viscount Landaff, of Thomastown in the County of Tipperary, in 1797, also in the Peerage of Ireland. In 1800 he was elected as one of the 28 original Irish Representative Peers. He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. The titles became extinct on his death in 1833.

Despite their territorial designations and the fact that they were in the Peerage of Ireland, the titles all referred to the place in Glamorgan now spelt Llandaff. The Mathew family was founded by Sir David Mathew (died 1484), Grand Standard Bearer of England. The Earls Landaff were descended from the branch of the family seated at Radyr, Glamorgan, Wales, descended from Thomas Mathew (died 1470), a younger son of Sir David Mathew. In Llandaff Cathedral, nearby Radyr, there exist three 15th century and 16th century Mathew family effigies. The seat of the Mathew family was Thomastown Castle, County Tipperary long abandoned. The extant ruins form a notable landmark.19th century towers stand while the 17th Century neo-gothic ramparts have succumbed to neglect and collapsed under the weight of encroaching ivy George Mathew sold his estate at Radyr and moved to Thomastown, gaining ownership of the castle through marriage to Elizabeth Poyntz after the death of her first husband, Thomas Butler, Viscount Thurles, of the Butler family.

The Roe River is only long at its longest constant point, and had been named as the World's Shortest River by the Guinness book of World Records before Guinness eliminated the shortest river category. Towards its mouth, the Roe is about deep. A successful campaign to get the Roe River recognized by the Guinness World Records as the shortest river in the world originated in 1987 with fifth-grade students of teacher Susie Nardlinger at Lincoln Elementary School in Great Falls. The river was unnamed at the time, so the students first had to petition the United States Board on Geographic Names to accept their proposed name, Roe River, then submit their proposal to Guinness. In 1988 future NFL football player Dallas Neil, then a student at the school, put in an appearance on The Tonight Show as part of this effort. Previously, Oregon's D River was listed in Guinness World Records as the world's shortest river at . This title was contested in 1989 when Guinness named the Roe River as the world's shortest. Not to be deterred, the people of Lincoln City submitted a new measurement of the D River to Guinness of about long, when marked at \\"extreme high tide\\". At that time, Lincoln City's Chamber of Commerce described the Roe as a \\"drainage ditch surveyed for a school project.\\" Nardlinger shot back that the D was merely an \\"ocean water backup,\\" pointed out that there was an alternative fork to the Roe which was only long, and suggested that a new survey be conducted. Guinness apparently never ruled on the dispute, leaving the claim by the Roe stand, but instead chose to no longer list a shortest river, possibly as a result of this ongoing dispute.

Woolston Eyes also supports nationally important wintering numbers of Northern shoveler, Eurasian teal gadwall and common pochard. There are 12 species of herpetofauna recorded, including sand lizard, smooth snake, natterjack toad and all three native British species of newt. It is also home to 21 species of Odonata, dragonflies and damselfies, out of 58 species found in Britain, as well as 26 species of butterfly. Management Woolston Eyes Conservation Group, a voluntary organisation formed in 1979, manages the rich and varied wildlife of the deposit grounds with the agreement of the Manchester Ship Canal Company. Its aim is to promote the study and conservation of the wildlife and habitat of the area with particular regard to the ornithology. The group undertakes management work to preserve or maximise the ornithological value of the Reserve, provides and maintains hides for the use of the public and permit holders, keeps the paths open and discourages disturbance. The group produces an Annual Report which summarises the work carried out and the results obtained including the scientific study of the flora and fauna of the Reserve. To carry out this work the group raises funds by the sale of Permits, Annual Reports and by applying for grants from various organisations.

They were originally created by Henry Lincoln and Mervyn Haisman, and first appeared in the 1967 serial The Abominable Snowmen, where they encountered the Second Doctor and his companions Jamie and Victoria. The Yeti resemble the cryptozoological creatures also called the Yeti, with an appearance Radio Times has described as \\"cuddly but ferocious\\", disguising a small spherical device that provides its motive power. The Yeti serve the Great Intelligence, a disembodied entity from another dimension, which first appeared trying to form a physical body so as to conquer the Earth. Initially the Yeti are a ruse to scare off curiosity seekers, later serving as an army for the Great Intelligence. Disagreements arose between Lincoln and Haisman with the BBC in 1968 over a serial introducing another new monster, The Dominators, leading to the writers' departure from the series and the retirement of the Yeti as antagonists. The Yeti have since appeared infrequently in flashbacks or cameo appearances. One did have a part in the 20th anniversary special The Five Doctors. They also appear in the 1990s Virgin Missing Adventures novels and the 1995 Reeltime spin-off production Downtime. The Great Intelligence has since returned in Series 7 of the revived series, portrayed by Sir Ian McKellen and Richard E Grant, without the aid of its Yeti servants. Creation The Yeti, along with contemporary villains such as the Cybermen and Ice Warriors, were an effort by the production team to create replacement monsters for the Daleks, who creator and part-copyright owner Terry Nation desired to have appear in an American spin-off series. The Evil of the Daleks, the last serial of the fourth season, had been intended as a final confrontation between the Doctor and the Daleks. Producer Innes Lloyd had already overseen the creation of the Cybermen by Gerry Davis and Kit Pedler and saw the monsters as an alternative to Daleks. Lloyd later recollected that the need to replace the Daleks also influenced the decision to pick up the Yeti as recurring monsters. After Henry Lincoln and Mervyn Haisman had spoken with Patrick Troughton, who expressed disappointment in the lack of Earth-bound stories in his first season as the Doctor, Lincoln chose the stories of the yeti as a suitable concept around which to create a serial for the program. Lincoln and Haisman pitched the idea to the Doctor Who offices, where it was formally commissioned. Lloyd and script editor Peter Bryant were impressed with The Abominable Snowmen and commissioned Haisman and Lincoln for a second Yeti adventure. Physical characteristics An actor on location for The Abominable Snowmen wearing half of the Yeti costume, depicting the metallic cavity where a control sphere is housed. Martin Baugh designed the Yeti costume; he was also responsible for costumes in their second serial The Web of Fear. This serial used different Yeti costumes from those of their debut, which were not considered threatening enough and had deteriorated. The Yeti robots that appear in The Abominable Snowmen are large with brown fur and a blackened face. These costumes also have clawed hands and feet, and they house control spheres in their chest, used by the Great Intelligence to remotely operate them. These original costumes were deemed 'a little too cuddly' and so when the robots returned in The Web of Fear they were redesigned. These Yeti robots appeared more compact and had glowing eyes. Brian Hodgson of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop also developed a Yeti roar for this serial, created by slowing down the sound of a flushing toilet. One of the original Yeti from The Abominable Snowmen appeared briefly as a museum display and, upon being reactivated by a control sphere, transformed into the newer model. In The Abominable Snowmen the control spheres are depicted as capable of seeking out inactive Yeti and crawling into the robots to activate them, emitting a series of whistle-like beeps whilst doing so. If the cavity intended to house the sphere is blocked, as Jamie (Frazer Hines) does with a rock, the sphere ignores that Yeti and falls silent. The Web of Fear expanded upon the spheres as a plot device with Professor Edward Travers and, as the serial progresses, the Doctor experimenting upon them. The experiments of both Travers and the Doctor eventually allow the protagonists to control the sphere, and by extension any Yeti it is stored within, using a short-range remote control. History The Yeti appeared twice in the fifth season of the series as adversaries of the Doctor‚Äôs second incarnation (Patrick Troughton). They are introduced in the 1967 serial The Abominable Snowmen guarding a cave near a Buddhist monastery in the Himalayas, scaring or killing travellers. The Yeti robots are protecting a pyramid of spheres that house the Great Intelligence, who has also possessed the body of the High Lama Padmasamabhava (Wolfe Morris) ever since encountering the man on the astral plane some centuries ago. Using Padmasambhava the Great Intelligence moves small Yeti pieces around a chess-like map of the monastery and mountainside. The Great Intelligence intends to create a physical body for itself, but these plans are foiled by the Doctor and his companions. With the Intelligence banished back to the astral plane the Yeti fall dormant. Several Yeti curiosities are taken back to England by Travers (Jack Watling), who had come in the hopes of encountering the real Yeti. In The Web of Fear, aired in 1968 and set forty years after The Abominable Snowmen, the Yeti artifacts that Travers brought to England reawaken due to the return of the Great Intelligence. The Yeti then subjugate London and engulf the Underground in web. The only resistance offered is by a band of soldiers, led first by Captain Knight (Ralph Watson) and then by Colonel Lethbridge-Stewart (Nicholas Courtney), with scientific support provided by Travers, his daughter Anne Travers (Tina Packer) and later the Doctor. The invasion of the London Underground is revealed as a trap designed to draw in the Doctor so that the Great Intelligence can drain the Doctor‚Äôs mind, but it is again defeated and banished. During the events of the Second Doctor's trial in the climax of season six's ten-part long The War Games, the Doctor refers to the Yeti as one of many threats that he has defeated during his travels. When in the 1983 serial Mawdryn Undead the Fifth Doctor encounters a retired and amnesiac Lethbridge-Stewart the Yeti are one of many references the Doctor makes to trigger the Brigadier's memory. Clips from The Web of Fear are also shown in a flashback montage during this serial. A Yeti is also one of the creatures featured in The Five Doctors and is encountered by the second Doctor and the Brigadier (Nicholas Courtney) as they cross through the Death Zone. The Brigadier later references the Yeti in the 1989 serial Battlefield as one of many alien adversaries that UNIT is prepared for. The Doctor's encounters with the Yeti are also referred to in the 2012 TV story \\"The Snowmen\\" when the Doctor uses a map of the 1960s London Underground to prove a point in front of a younger Great Intelligence, referencing its later invasion in 1968's The Web of Fear. The story also serves as a prequel to The Abominable Snowmen. Other appearances As a popular monster the Yeti have appeared in Doctor Who spin-off media; however, the canonical status of non-televised stories is uncertain. Yeti and the Great Intelligence are featured in the 1995 spin-off video Downtime, produced by Reeltime and featuring Victoria Waterfield (Deborah Watling), the Brigadier (Nicholas Courtney) and Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen) with a now deceased Professor Travers (Jack Watling) serving as a vessel for the Intelligence. Here the Great Intelligence plans on infecting the Internet so as to use it as a new body, using control spheres to transform humans into Yeti servants. Downtime was novelised by Marc Platt as part of Virgin's Missing Adventures range in 1996. The Yeti also appear in the 1995 Missing Adventure Millennial Rites by Craig Hinton, where the summoning of a creature from the universe to come goes wrong and instead sees the Great Intelligence merged with that entity. This creates an altered London based on contradictory physical laws and populated by demons and sorcerers, forcing altered versions of the Sixth Doctor and his companion Mel (transformed into the Valeyard and a technomancer named Melaphyre) to restore London before the reality tears itself apart. The novel also features the character Anne Travers from The Web of Fear. Millennial Rites follows the New Adventure All-Consuming Fire by Andy Lane, published in 1994, in identifying the Great Intelligence with H. P. Lovecraft's Yog-Sothoth, a being from the universe before this one. The Great Intelligence also appeared in a back-up comic strip in Doctor Who Weekly #31‚Äì#34. Yeti robots were also among the monsters to appear in the 1997 video game Doctor Who: Destiny of the Doctors. Reception and legacy The Yeti, on display at the Doctor Who Experience. After the death of co-creator Mervyn Haisman, the Guardian's obituary called the Yeti his 'lasting legacy' to the series, noting how the monsters quickly found popularity among viewers. Their second appearance in The Web of Fear was considered such a success by the production team that the sixth season Cybermen serial The Invasion was intended as both a follow-up to the second Yeti adventure and a pilot for a new earthbound format for the series. The Third Doctor Jon Pertwee is known for commenting that nothing frightened an audience more than \\"a Yeti on your loo in Tooting Bec\\" in reference to the success of the earthbound format, associating the creatures strongly with the new direction of the series. Paul Cornell, commenting on Fortean themes within the series, mentions that Doctor Who is a populist series exploring the public perception of the fantastic and that the Yeti stories are an early example of Doctor Who exploring such concepts, which were later explored in several serials produced by Barry Letts in the early 1970s. Media historian James Chapman agrees that The Abominable Snowmen is the first Doctor Who serial to explore cryptozoology or mythology with an alien grounding, also citing it as having drawn from the gothic horror atmosphere and plot of Hammer‚Äôs 1957 film The Abominable Snowman. He reflects that their second outing, in The Web of Fear, turned what was merely another monster when in the Himalayas into a nightmare by placing them in the identifiable setting of the London Underground. Chapman concludes that The Web of Fear also, by centring the Yeti threat in the London Underground, is part of a horror tradition where a 'chaos world' is located under the surface the ordinary. Graham Sleight commented that the voiceless Yeti robots, and similar monsters such as the Autons and the maggots in The Green Death, are controlled by another entity and are merely there to provide a threat, leading to the Yeti and similar monsters being less interesting than monsters that could talk or reason with the characters. In contrast, Fraser McAlpine and Nick Page felt that the Yeti being controlled gave them greater menace. McAlpine says this gives the Yeti menace because, being controlled, they can't hold any feelings or grudges of their own and act only as the fierce physical agents for whoever can control them. Page reflected that 'the Great Intelligence... always turned off their power when it was not required', creating suspense when characters interacted with a seemingly dormant Yeti.

It is a separate town because the civil parish is called a town council.https://www.birchwoodtowncouncil.org.uk/ Historically part of Lancashire, it was built during the time of much expansion in Warrington as it became a \\"new town\\". Birchwood is separated into three residential estates: Gorse Covert (grid ref SJ665925, population 2,790), Oakwood (grid ref SJ656914, population 4,381) and Locking Stumps (grid ref SJ645918, population 2,759), with all the main facilities grouped around the centre.  Geography  The area east of Birchwood is mainly birch forests and Risley Moss, part of the Mersey Forest. Risley Moss is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The bulk of Birchwood is built on the site of the former ROF Risley Royal Ordnance Factory, with Birchwood Forest Park lying in the centre, in which the old bunkers from the factory form part of the landscape.  History  \\"The surface, at a distance, looks black and dirty, and will bear neither horse nor man‚Ä¶.. What nature meant by such a useless production 'tis hard to imagine, but the land is entirely to waste\\" are the words of Daniel Defoe as he rode through Risley in 1724. (Later part of the Risley area was renamed Birchwood as the Warrington 'New town' development). In the past travellers avoided the Risley (Birchwood) area because it of its dangerous mossland, however gradually over time much of the fertile mossland was reclaimed and turned into farm land. With the advent of the Second World War, 927 acres (3.8 km¬≤) of agricultural land was changed into a massive Royal Ordnance Factory, ROF Risley. The location was chosen because the low lying mist and cloud helped camouflage the factory from the air; according to a local builder: \\"It was very lonely and misty at night, and that's why the factory was constructed there ... it was usually covered with a mist or cloud. It was hard to see it in the day time, you know\\". Although the location of the factory was known by the German Luftwaffe, the factory was bombed only once during the war. A number of bunkers were also built (some can still be seen today) to house the munitions, to protect them from potential bombing, and also to segregate the site and reduce the consequences of any accidental explosions during manufacture or storage. Although these bunkers are on the surface, they are covered with soil and turf and so give the impression of being underground. However, after the war the factory no longer had a purpose other than as a storage depot and so in 1956 the north west of the factory was sold to UKAEA with the entire disused area being put on the market in 1963. No buyer was found for it until 1968, when the Warrington and Runcorn Development Corporation bought the site and turned it into the new town of Birchwood.  Shopping  The area's principal shopping needs are serviced by Birchwood Shopping Centre, with many shops such as a large Asda store, two cafes and a Greggs. There are also a number of smaller shops in each village of the town. Each one has a local convenience store that sell needs such as bread and milk. Local milk and vegetable delivery services supply houses in the area, as well as the delivery services from the large supermarkets. There are a few farms in the area that sell small quantities of eggs and other local produce directly to local shoppers.  Transport  Encounter ‚Äì the gateway to Birchwood, Warrington, England (2005) Birchwood is located close to the intersections between the M6 and M62 and the M6 and M56 and the railway station on the Liverpool--Manchester train line. There are frequent bus services (routes 17 and 25) to Warrington town centre, and to Culcheth and Leigh (routes 28 and 28A). Details of all these services can be found on the Warrington's Own Buses website. = Rail = Birchwood railway station is a mainline railway station run by Northern with trains stopping bound for Manchester, Liverpool and Warrington Central, and surrounding areas, as well as long distance services to Norwich which are operated by East Midlands Railway during the peak hours only. Trains pass through three times an hour per direction: * Two suburban trains per hour to Manchester Oxford Road via Irlam * Two suburban trains per hour to Liverpool Lime Street via Warrington Central * One fast train per hour to Liverpool Lime Street stopping only at Warrington Central and Liverpool South Parkway en route * One fast train per hour to Manchester Airport via Manchester Piccadilly All trains will operate the Manchester-Liverpool via Warrington line, while the East Midlands Railway proceed further. = Road = Birchwood is very close to Junction 11 of the M62, providing access to Liverpool (22 miles/35 km) and Manchester (15 miles/24 km). Junction 11 is notable for the Encounter statue (also known as the Angel of Birchwood). Birchwood is close to Junction 21 of the M6, giving access to Birmingham (80 miles/128 km). Birchwood is approximately from Warrington town centre (via Birchwood Way) and Leigh (11 miles/18 km) (via Warrington Road). = Buses = There are six bus routes operating through the Birchwood area, all of which are operated by Warrington's Own Buses. The 17 and 25 operate through all parts of Birchwood to Warrington, with the Gorse Covert SPAR shop (25) or Oakwood Keyes Close (17) acting as termini. The routes differ in the precise routes they take to Warrington bus station, and in their regularity. Service 25 is the main service, The 28E operates the evening services Monday to Saturday going from Warrington bus station to Leigh bus station. The first service starts at 19:00 and the last service is at 23:00 departing at each ends of the line The 28 also starts at Warrington bus station, then through Birchwood and on to Leigh via Culcheth. The 28A operates the same route but does not go through Birchwood or Oakwood. A shuttle bus service for workers runs between the railway station and Birchwood Park business park.  Education  Birchwood is served by three primary schools, one per area, and Birchwood Community High School. Birchwood College is next to the high school.  Industry  To the north of the Royal Ordnance Factory (ROF), Risley, was the site chosen for the design offices and headquarters of the Department of ATomic ENergy (DATEN) after the Second World War. Later to become the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA), the offices were charged with the manufacture of the nuclear reactors and process plants at Windscale to help build the UK's atomic defence. Following on from the weapons program, the Risley offices were responsible for the building of the Magnox and AGR designs of reactor in the UK. In 1971 BNFL was set up from the production division of the (UKAEA), and until 2003 its headquarters were at Risley, near Warrington. BNFLs headquarters are now at Daresbury Park industrial estate, also near to Warrington. BNFL (now represented by Sellafield Ltd and Nexia Solutions) maintains a large office of the site, which is something of a nuclear nexus, with AMEC (Formerly NNC), Nuvia (formerly NUKEM Engineering Limited), WS Atkins Design, Environment & Engineering, Nuclear Technologies plc, Serco and Assurance Quintessa (among others) based on Birchwood Park. WS Atkins has one office in Birchwood, Warrington ‚Äì Chadwick House (containing various business units including Water, Highways and Transportation, Design Solutions, Rail, Nuclear and Faithful+Gould).

It is a traditional Scandinavian drink during winter, especially around Christmas. In Scandinavia, hot wine has been a common drink since the 16th century. The original form of gl√∂gg, a spiced liquor, was consumed by messengers and postmen who travelled on horseback or skis in cold weather. Since the early 19th century, gl√∂gg has been common a winter drink, mixed and warmed with juice, syrup, and sometimes with a splash of harder spirits or punsch. Gl√∂gg recipes vary widely; variations commonly start with white or sweet wine or spirits such as brandy or cognac. The production of gl√∂gg begins by boiling water and adding spices to it. After a few minutes of simmering, the mixture is sieved and fruit juice, wine or clear spirits are added. The most common spices in gl√∂gg are cloves, cinnamon, cardamom and ginger. Other common ingredients can include citrus peel from oranges or lemons, raisins or almonds.Maija Suova (toim.): Em√§nn√§n tietokirja I‚ÄìII, 4. uudistettu laitos, s. 135. WSOY, 1958. Gl√∂gg can also be made without alcohol by replacing the wine with fruit or berry juices. In shops ready-made gl√∂gg is usually based on grape juice, sometimes also blackcurrant juice, mixed fruit juice, apple juice or wine. There are also stronger, rum-based types of gl√∂gg. Ready-made gl√∂gg from shops is warmed up before use, but if it is wine-based or high in alcohol content, it should not be heated to boiling point. It is common to add whole almonds or raisins to gl√∂gg while it is being warmed up or just before drinking. Gl√∂gg came to Finland from Sweden. The Finnish and the Estonian word gl√∂gi comes from the Swedish word gl√∂gg, which in turn comes from the words gl√∂dgat vin or hot wine. At the end of the 19th century, gl√∂gg mixed with wine was drunk, but due to prohibition, consumption of gl√∂gg almost stopped completely. When prohibition was lifted in the 1930s gl√∂gg was advertised in Fenno-Swedish magazines, and in the 1950s and 60s, the drinking of gl√∂gg was a Fenno-Swedish tradition. At the end of the 1960s and beginning of the 70s, gl√∂gg recipes began to also appear in Finnish language magazines, after which gl√∂gg became a Christmas tradition in the whole of Finland.Hufvudstadsbladet, 15.12.2011, sivu 22.

Bison) ) was a Polish twin-engined medium bomber, produced by the LWS factory before World War II. A short series was used for training only, because it was inferior to the contemporary PZL.37 ≈Åo≈õ design. Design The PZL.30 was designed by Zbys≈Çaw Cio≈Çkosz) for PZL in the early 1930s, initially as a 12-passenger airliner. When the Polish Airlines LOT bought Douglas DC-2 aircraft instead, the design was converted to a bomber, with a projected bomb load of 1,200 kg. The PZL.30 was developed as a less-advanced, alternative medium bomber design, in case the more modern bomber design, the PZL.37 ≈Åo≈õ would fail. The first prototype, designated PZL.30 (or PZL.30BI) was flown in March 1936 by Boles≈Çaw Orli≈Ñski. The maiden flight of the PZL.30 took place only three months before the PZL.37 ≈Åo≈õ prototype flew. Although developed at the same time as the PZL.37, the PZL.30 was inferior to its counterpart, being slower and having a much smaller bomb load than the ≈Åo≈õ, yet produced at a similar price. Development The PZL.30 prototype, initially powered with two 420 hp Pratt & Whitney Wasp Junior engines, was further refitted as the PZL.30BII, with more powerful Bristol Pegasus VIII engines. The aircraft was accepted for a limited production run by the LWS state factory in Lublin, of which Cio≈Çkosz became the technical director and project lead. The second prototype was designated LWS-4.Fitzsimmons 1979, p. 2620. It was planned to produce 16 aircraft for the Polish Air Force, with the designation: LWS-6 ≈ªubr. The ≈ªubr was given a military code number 71 and the series was to have factory numbers 71.1 to 71.17, but the aircraft were given different code numbers eventually due to secrecy.Morga≈Ça 2003, pp. 159‚Äì165. The production aircraft incorporated further changes, among others the landing gear retracting into the fuselage sides was changed to more conventional one, retracting into the engine nacelles. After a prototype crashed on 7 November 1936, caused by de- laminating plywood wing skins, the wing had to be reinforced. Due to this increased weight, the LWS-6 had a smaller bomb load than expected. A modified prototype was made with a double tail fin, and flown at the end of 1937. The definitive variant, however, in the course of production, returned to a single enlarged tail fin configuration. A series of 15 aircraft were built in 1938.Taylor 1969, p. 282. In 1937 the factory proposed to build a floatplane torpedo bomber variant LWS-5, instead of developing LWS-1 (R-XXA) design by Jerzy Rudlicki. It was supposed to be fitted with two Short floats of the Lublin R-XX prototype. At first the Polish Navy exhibited interest and work on the LWS-1 was cancelled despite its progress, but then due to problems with LWS-5 development, work on the prototype was canceled. It was evident that the underpowered LWS-5 could not carry an effective offensive load. Apart from the Polish Air Force, the Romanian Air Force showed an interest in the ≈ªubr prototype in 1936, and considered a purchase of 24 aircraft. On 7 November 1936, after the Pegasus-powered prototype encountered a mid-air structural failure and crashed at Micha≈Çowice, all on board dying, including two Romanian officers on board, Romania ordered the PZL.37 ≈Åo≈õ instead. =Technical design= The LWS-6 was a conventional high-wing cantilever monoplane. It featured mixed construction (metal and wood). The fuselage was rectangular in cross-section, made of a metal frame, covered with metal (upper fuselage) and canvas (sides and bottom) with the front section made of duralumin. Wings were of wooden construction and plywood covered. There was a crew of four: pilot, commander-bombardier, radio operator and a rear gunner. The bombardier was accommodated in the glazed nose, with a forward twin machine gun turret with a notable pointed \\"beard\\" below the turret. The pilot's canopy was located above the fuselage, offset to the left. The rear gunner operated twin machine guns in a semi-retractable upper dorsal turret, elevating to a working position, along with a \\"trap\\" ventral position, operating the same way. The main undercarriage retracted into engine nacelles. The aircraft was powered by two Bristol Pegasus VIII radial engines, normal power: 670 hp (500 kW), take-off power: 680 hp (520 kW). Bombs were carried in a bomb bay in the fuselage, the maximum load was 660 kg. Operational history A total of 15 LWS-6 bombers were delivered to the Polish Air Force in 1938-1939. From the outset, they were considered obsolete, and were assigned to training units, mainly to the 3rd Training Dyon. In operational service, the LWS-6 revealed several faults, for example, the undercarriage retracted on some aircraft during landing. Reportedly, the crews later flew with the undercarriage permanently locked down. As training aircraft they had their armament removed. There was only one crash, however, without fatal injuries. During the invasion of Poland in 1939, ≈ªubrs were not used in combat. Several were destroyed on the ground, along with many other training aircraft. The Germans captured several LWS-6s, including the twin-tailfin prototype, and used them for blind flying training until at least 1942 (among others, in Blindflugschule Schleissheim). The Luftwaffe service of this bomber was longer than the Polish one.Taylor 1969, p. 283.

It is named after the German mathematician Hermann Minkowski and the French mathematician Georges Bouligand. To calculate this dimension for a fractal S, imagine this fractal lying on an evenly spaced grid, and count how many boxes are required to cover the set. The box-counting dimension is calculated by seeing how this number changes as we make the grid finer by applying a box- counting algorithm. Suppose that N(Œµ) is the number of boxes of side length Œµ required to cover the set. Then the box-counting dimension is defined as: :\\\\dim_{\\\\rm box}(S) := \\\\lim_{\\\\varepsilon \\\\to 0} \\\\frac {\\\\log N(\\\\varepsilon)}{\\\\log (1/\\\\varepsilon)}. Roughly speaking, this means the dimension is the exponent d such that N(1/n) ‚âà C nd, which is what one would expect in the trivial case where S is a smooth space (a manifold) of integer dimension d. If the above limit does not exist, one may still take the limit superior and limit inferior, which respectively define the upper box dimension and lower box dimension. The upper box dimension is sometimes called the entropy dimension, Kolmogorov dimension, Kolmogorov capacity, limit capacity or upper Minkowski dimension, while the lower box dimension is also called the lower Minkowski dimension. The upper and lower box dimensions are strongly related to the more popular Hausdorff dimension. Only in very special applications is it important to distinguish between the three (see below). Yet another measure of fractal dimension is the correlation dimension.  Alternative definitions  Examples of ball packing, ball covering, and box covering. It is possible to define the box dimensions using balls, with either the covering number or the packing number. The covering number N_{\\\\rm covering}(\\\\varepsilon) is the minimal number of open balls of radius Œµ required to cover the fractal, or in other words, such that their union contains the fractal. We can also consider the intrinsic covering number N'_{\\\\rm covering}(\\\\varepsilon), which is defined the same way but with the additional requirement that the centers of the open balls lie inside the set S. The packing number N_{\\\\rm packing}(\\\\varepsilon) is the maximal number of disjoint open balls of radius Œµ one can situate such that their centers would be inside the fractal. While N, Ncovering, N'covering and Npacking are not exactly identical, they are closely related, and give rise to identical definitions of the upper and lower box dimensions. This is easy to prove once the following inequalities are proven: : N_\\\\text{packing}(\\\\varepsilon) \\\\leq N'_\\\\text{covering}(\\\\varepsilon) \\\\leq N_\\\\text{covering}(\\\\varepsilon/2). \\\\, These, in turn, follow with a little effort from the triangle inequality. The advantage of using balls rather than squares is that this definition generalizes to any metric space. In other words, the box definition is extrinsic -- one assumes the fractal space S is contained in a Euclidean space, and defines boxes according to the external geometry of the containing space. However, the dimension of S should be intrinsic, independent of the environment into which S is placed, and the ball definition can be formulated intrinsically. One defines an internal ball as all points of S within a certain distance of a chosen center, and one counts such balls to get the dimension. (More precisely, the Ncovering definition is extrinsic, but the other two are intrinsic.) The advantage of using boxes is that in many cases N(Œµ) may be easily calculated explicitly, and that for boxes the covering and packing numbers (defined in an equivalent way) are equal. The logarithm of the packing and covering numbers are sometimes referred to as entropy numbers, and are somewhat analogous to the concepts of thermodynamic entropy and information-theoretic entropy, in that they measure the amount of \\"disorder\\" in the metric space or fractal at scale Œµ, and also measure how many bits or digits one would need to specify a point of the space to accuracy Œµ. Another equivalent (extrinsic) definition for the box-counting dimension, is given by the formula: :\\\\dim_\\\\text{box}(S) = n - \\\\lim_{r \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{\\\\log \\\\text{vol}(S_r)}{\\\\log r}, where for each r > 0, the set S_r is defined to be the r-neighborhood of S, i.e. the set of all points in R^n which are at distance less than r from S (or equivalently, S_r is the union of all the open balls of radius r which are centered at a point in S).  Properties  Both box dimensions are finitely additive, i.e. if { A1, .... An } is a finite collection of sets then :\\\\dim (A_1 \\\\cup \\\\dotsb \\\\cup A_n) = \\\\max \\\\\\\\{ \\\\dim A_1 ,\\\\dots, \\\\dim A_n \\\\\\\\}. \\\\, However, they are not countably additive, i.e. this equality does not hold for an infinite sequence of sets. For example, the box dimension of a single point is 0, but the box dimension of the collection of rational numbers in the interval [0, 1] has dimension 1. The Hausdorff measure by comparison, is countably additive. An interesting property of the upper box dimension not shared with either the lower box dimension or the Hausdorff dimension is the connection to set addition. If A and B are two sets in a Euclidean space then A + B is formed by taking all the pairs of points a,b where a is from A and b is from B and adding a+b. One has :\\\\dim_\\\\text{upper box}(A+B)\\\\leq \\\\dim_\\\\text{upper box}(A)+\\\\dim_\\\\text{upper box}(B).  Relations to the Hausdorff dimension  The box-counting dimension is one of a number of definitions for dimension that can be applied to fractals. For many well behaved fractals all these dimensions are equal; in particular, these dimensions coincide whenever the fractal satisfies the open set condition (OSC). For example, the Hausdorff dimension, lower box dimension, and upper box dimension of the Cantor set are all equal to log(2)/log(3). However, the definitions are not equivalent. The box dimensions and the Hausdorff dimension are related by the inequality :\\\\dim_{\\\\operatorname{Haus}} \\\\leq \\\\dim_{\\\\operatorname{lower box}} \\\\leq \\\\dim_{\\\\operatorname{upper box}}. In general both inequalities may be strict. The upper box dimension may be bigger than the lower box dimension if the fractal has different behaviour in different scales. For example, examine the set of numbers in the interval [0,1] satisfying the condition :for any n, all the digits between the 22n-th digit and the (22n+1 ‚àí 1)th digit are zero The digits in the \\"odd place- intervals\\", i.e. between digits 22n+1 and 22n+2 ‚àí 1 are not restricted and may take any value. This fractal has upper box dimension 2/3 and lower box dimension 1/3, a fact which may be easily verified by calculating N(Œµ) for \\\\varepsilon=10^{-2^n} and noting that their values behave differently for n even and odd. More examples: The set of rational numbers \\\\mathbb{Q}, a countable set with \\\\dim_{\\\\operatorname{Haus}} = 0, has \\\\dim_{\\\\operatorname{box}} = 1 because its closure, \\\\mathbb{R}, has dimension 1. In fact, : \\\\dim_{\\\\operatorname{box}} \\\\left\\\\\\\\{0,1,\\\\frac{1}{2}, \\\\frac{1}{3}, \\\\frac{1}{4}, \\\\ldots\\\\right\\\\\\\\} = \\\\frac{1}{2}. These examples show that adding a countable set can change box-dimension, showing a kind of instability of this dimension.

A warrior of good and his army were assigned to guard the Deeper Well to prevent anyone from extracting one of the coffins, as Old Ones are capable of resurrection. In the 20th century, the Keeper of the Deeper Well was Drogyn the Battlebrand. Before falling, Illyria planned her resurrection. She hid her temple in a different time plane, rendering it completely intangible, until she could return to open the gateway and enter it. Illyria's army was placed there as well, waiting to be raised once again by its leader. In the passing centuries, the army was destroyed, leaving only dust in its place. = Resurrection = As pre-ordained, Illyria's sarcophagus is teleported to the general area of Los Angeles, but due to continental shifting, it ends up outside of the United States of America. Somehow, it is delivered to American soil, but is held up in Customs on its way to Wolfram & Hart. Dr. Sparrow manipulates Charles Gunn into releasing the sarcophagus in exchange for fixing his brain enhancements. Knox, Illyria's self-fashioned Qwa'ha Xahn (high priest) and the mastermind behind her resurrection, has the sarcophagus delivered to Fred Burkle at Wolfram & Hart's science lab. Curiosity draws Fred to the sarcophagus, and when she touches one of the coffin's embedded crystals, Illyria's essence is released into her body. Illyria's spirit acts as an infection liquifying Fred's organs, hardening her skin, and allegedly consuming her soul. After hours of agony, and despite Angel and Spike traveling to Illyria's former prison in an attempt to find a way to draw her out of Fred, Fred's body is completely taken over by Illyria, who also absorbs her memories (which she later likens to \\"sparks\\"). Though declaring there is no more of Fred's soul in her, Illyria reverts to Fred for her significant ones, like her parents and Wesley. With the aid of Knox, Illyria attempts to bring about the destruction of humankind by resurrecting her ancient army. Despite the best efforts of Angel, Spike, and Wesley Wyndam-Pryce, she manages to fight off all three of them and open the portal to where her army is waiting, but soon she discovers it was destroyed long ago. Lost and without purpose, Illyria agrees to learn how to adjust to the modern world with Wesley's help, who is drawn to the ancient being that now occupies the body of his love. She spends her nights with the oft-drunk Wesley and her days wandering the corridors of Wolfram & Hart. When Wesley mentions to her Gunn is trapped in a Wolfram & Hart-imposed pseudo-Hell, Illyria opens a portal and rescues Gunn without hesitation, later noting the great debt the group owes to her. In the process of finding Gunn, she destroys eleven torture units, two troop carriers, an ice cream truck, eight \\"beautifully maintained\\" lawns, and \\"rendered useless\\" dozens of Wolfram & Hart employees, according to Marcus Hamilton. At this point, her pastimes include talking to plants and training with Spike (or, more accurately, beating him up while he tries to ask her how she feels when he hits her and record the details on a clipboard). Although she criticizes Spike's adaptability, declaring adaptation to be a compromise, Illyria enjoys beating him up and even being beaten up by him in sparring (both of them, as a goddess and a vampire, being immune to deadly concussion hits); at one point, she expresses her desire to keep him as a pet (a strange but true sign of affection, which lasts until the final episode). Eventually, Illyria's power becomes extremely unstable. To others, the Old One appears to be going mad. In truth, Illyria is being thrown out of linear progression of the timeline, altering her perspective as her power seeks a way to escape its shell. Initially, she kills Spike, Wesley, Lorne, and Angel in a confrontation, interpreting their actions as an attempt to kill her, but, during her time jumps, she drags an earlier version of Angel into the present, revealing what just took place before she detonates, potentially causing enough destruction to wipe out the continent. Fortunately, the explosion sends Angel backwards in time to shortly before Illyria killed the others, allowing Angel to use his new foreknowledge of their deaths to save his friends and calm Illyria down. Before Illyria can detonate again, Wesley uses a Mutari generator to extract a large portion of her power, effectively ending the threat. As a result of the Mutari generator, Illyria is stripped of much of her super-strength, as well as her abilities to alter time and talk to plants. She grows bitter and withdrawn after the loss of her powers, which she considers a significant defeat. Her primary emotional connection is with Wesley, who continues to help her adjust to the world. After recognizing Wesley's feelings for the \\"shell\\" (Fred), Illyria wishes to explore her relationship with Wesley in a more sexual or romantic direction; he rejects any possibility of accepting her in Fred's form. She also develops a connection with Spike, who can relate to her newfound situation and treats her with acceptance and dignity, communicating easily with her and helping her venture into the world. Illyria is brutally beaten and humiliated by Hamilton, which fuels the Old One's extreme anger and motivates her to join the final battle against the Senior Partners. In the Angel series finale, \\"Not Fade Away,\\" Illyria, Spike, Wesley, Gunn, Lorne, Lindsey, and Angel each fight separate groups of demons from the Circle of the Black Thorn. After killing her demon victims, promising to \\"make trophies from their spines,\\" Illyria seeks out Wesley and finds him dying. Perceiving his imminent death, she comforts Wesley in Fred's form. Filled with unexpected and uncontrollable grief, Illyria violently dispatches his killer, Cyvus Vail, shattering his head with a single punch‚Äîan action that does not begin to assuage her grief and leaves her with a strong desire to \\"do more violence.\\" Her wish is granted when the Senior Partners send their army against the surviving members of Angel's team; Illyria joins Angel, Gunn, and Spike in the final battle against the Senior Partners. Interviews have revealed that had there been a sixth season of Angel, Illyria would have used Fred's appearance as a disguise more often. This would have led to an identity crisis, according to Joss Whedon. In the canonical comic Angel: After the Fall, it is confirmed Illyria survived the final battle against the Senior Partners. = Literature = Illyria appears substantially in the comic books published by IDW Publishing following Angels series finale. Several titles featuring Illyria have nothing or very little to do with the larger Buffy and Angel franchise. Until the advent of the canonical comics of 2007, most Illyria stories were set during Season Five of Angel. The comic book Illyria: Spotlight (2006) by Peter David depicts Illyria's encounters with Fred's friends and family, and she even begins to cry when she watches home movies of Fred's life; she later asserts to Wesley that she feels no regret. Peter David also published an Illyria crossover with his own comic book, Fallen Angel. In volume one of Fallen Angel Reborn (2009), set in Season Five, Illyria is transported to the dimension of Bete Noire where she attempts to reclaim her lost power; flashbacks depict her battle with the Wolf, the Ram and the Hart as well as other Old Ones like herself, in a primordial era; in the present day, she faces the series' heroine Liandra. Illyria appears on the cover of each issue. In the miniseries Spike: Shadow Puppets, she appears in flashbacks and as puppet in the narrative of that story, a sequel to Season Five episode \\"Smile Time\\". In canonical comics, she first appears in the second issue of Angel: After the Fall (2007), the official Angel continuation. The spin-off miniseries Spike: After the Fall charts Illyria's journey between \\"Not Fade Away\\" and Angel: After the Fall. All After the Fall stories are written by Brian Lynch, who receives substantial input from creator Joss Whedon. In Angel: After the Fall, Los Angeles has been sent to hell by Wolfram & Hart. Illyria is established as the Demon Lord of Beverly Hills, and working with Spike saves innocents by placing them in Connor's care. Spike: After the Fall details their acquisition of Lord status. Throughout the series, Illyria features temporary reversions to her Fred state as the hell dimension causes her powers to go out of control. Later, when Gunn (now a vampire) kills the last of her memories of Fred, these stop, and she reverts to her primordial form and begins savaging Los Angeles. Telepathic fish Betta George is able to fill her with Spike and Wesley's memories of Fred, and Fred's humanity causes her to stop. Though Wolfram and Hart reverts time to before they destroyed Los Angeles, Illyria retains the memories of her experiences like everyone else. Illyria guards a hospitalized Gunn ‚Äî human once more ‚Äî in his hospital bed from angry demons, and her new memories of Fred make her crisis of humanity even more apparent. The two depart Los Angeles and an encounter with an Old One from her past while she and Gunn learn to accept their humanity. In IDW's ongoing Angel series, a storyline depicts Illyria attempting to seduce Connor as part of her mating cycle. She fails due to Connor's reluctance. At one point she makes clear to Angel that while she's not and never will be Fred, like him she's now a formerly evil being trying to be good and redeem their past sins. In the comic Illyria: Haunted (2011), Illyria begins having nightmares consisting of Fred's partial memories. She tries to reach out to an emotionally unavailable Angel and finds no comfort. Illyria then seeks out Spike for advice. He believes she should return to the Deeper Well for answers and comfort. She then, in an unprecedented show of humility, formally asks Spike for help. Spike takes Illyria to Sally, a Frellian demon who grants favors for a price. She sends them to retrieve a charm from a potential suitor of hers and then opens a portal for Illyria to the Deeper Well. Illyria quickly dispatches the Vastari demons guarding the entrance and enters to find the new guardian is a rare matriarchal demon. The new guardian sends two Yastigilian Hounds to attack Illyria, unaware that Illyria has the knowledge to control them. Illyria explains that they are kindred species. She is granted access to the Deeper Well but is warned not to touch anything. Illyria finds nothing but Gylphs on the wall where her coffin once was and begins smashing things in disappointment. Drawn to a gem on the wall, she touches it and is magically enlightened to her new place in the world, unaware that she has accidentally released a former rival old one, Arsgomor. Illyria attempts to both fight and reason with Arsgomor until he kills one of her new Yastigilian pets. Illyria commands the local plant life to subdue Arsgomor and then degenerates him to a fetal form. She releases this new baby Arsgomor to the new guardian and returns to L.A. with her pet Yastigilian hound, Pancakes. She then uses her restored powers to open a dimensional portal and go traveling. Subsequent to the above story, the rights to Angel characters were transferred from IDW to Dark Horse Comics, which publishes Buffy. In Angel and Faith (2012), Gunn tells Angel that Illyria is missing but presumed to be safe. She later debuts in Buffy in issue sixteen, as part of the \\"Welcome to the Team\\" story arc. Mid-battle, Buffy finds herself teleported to Los Angeles, where Illyria introduces herself as part of a council which needs Buffy's help due to the consequences of Buffy destroying the seed and stripping the universe of its ambient magic. In a confrontation with the season's villain, Severin, Illyria is stripped of her powers‚Äîincluding her ability to time travel‚Äîleaving her mortal and stuck in Fred's physical appearance. She assists Buffy's quest into its final arc, travelling into the Deeper Well alongside Buffy, Willow and Xander. Drawing on her personal experiences in Angel, she convinces Severin‚Äîwhose powers threaten to rip a hole in time itself‚Äîto create a new seed, which will restore magic to the universe. Willow points out to Illyria that she is showing very human compassion, which Illyria herself recognizes. The creation of the new seed creates a powerful discharge, vaporizing Illyria and Severin both. In the follow-up series Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten, Buffy expresses regret for Illyria's death to the demon Eldre Koh. Koh is surprised by this, and tells Buffy that she does not understand Old Ones, suggesting Illyria may yet survive in some form.\\"Buffy Season 10\\" #2 (April 2014) Later, in the Angel & Faith book, Angel encounters Fred walking the streets of London. They surmise the recreated Seed attempted to bring Illyria back, and in the event, also brought back Fred. Now both Fred and Illyria are alive and cohabit Fred's body.  Powers and abilities  The full scope of Illyria's power is unknown and probably unlimited. When Illyria takes over her new \\"shell,\\" she possesses tremendous physical strength, far superior to that of most vampires, demons, or Slayers. Spike likens a blow from Illyria to being hit by a Mack Truck. Her strength, reflexes, and agility make her a formidable hand-to-hand combatant. Illyria uses an ancient fighting style that Spike compares to Tae Kwon Do and (fictional) Brazilian Ninjitsu. Although Spike's adaptability gives him an occasional advantage, Illyria dominates their sparring sessions. Her skin is a hardened shell, providing her body with a heavy armor capable of withstanding blows from forged weapons, such as swords or axes. In the episode \\"Time Bomb\\", she managed to single-handedly kill Spike, Wesley, Lorne and Angel in a matter of seconds, a testament of her prowess in combat. Illyria is aided in combat by her ability to selectively alter time, which allows her to easily dodge both attacks and bullets; she can accomplish a goal and leave an area before her opponent even realizes she has moved. She has only been shown altering the flow of time to produce a slow motion effect, though it is possible that she can alter time in other ways. She can also open interdimensional portals. In the episode \\"Underneath,\\" Wesley Wyndam-Pryce comments on her not needing to sleep. Illyria can alter her physical appearance on a basic level, and she is capable of recreating Fred's persona accurately enough to fool Fred's parents. She tells Wesley that she can take any form she chooses. Illyria has empathic abilities that allow her to perceive the emotional states of others. She was, for instance, capable of sensing Connor's lust for her and Wesley's frustration with Angel as well as his grief over Fred's death. Illyria communicates with flora, often spending hours at a time communing with a plant. She is also capable of distinguishing humans (or \\"primitives\\") from demons, vampires, and other non- human life forms. Illyria retains the insights from her experiences as an Old One, which enable her to effectively analyze the power dynamics, personal motivations, and emotions that influence those around her. She is stronger than Spike and Angel combined (having proven at one point to be able to engage both in battle simultaneously and come out victorious). In her/its natural form, Illyria is a massive genderless cephalopod-like monster, similar to Lovecraft's Cthulhu, with inhuman size and numerous tentacles, with all of her powers at full capacity. = Powers diminished = After being drained by the Mutari generator, Illyria's abilities are significantly diminished. Her physical strength is decreased (although retaining a high level of strength, well above that of Slayers, vampires and the vast majority of demons shown in the series), and she no longer has the ability to open portals or commune with plants. Wesley perceives that Illyria is no longer invulnerable, as she once was (cf. \\"The Girl in Question\\") and she is later beaten unconscious by Marcus Hamilton in \\"Power Play\\". In addition to this, she successfully kills several members of the Circle of the Black Thorn with minimal difficulty. She retains her ability to morph her physical appearance, and also her ability to differentiate between humans and non-humans. In the series Angel: After the Fall, Illyria's powers behave erratically and are closer to their full potential. Early in the series, she was shown to hold herself unarmed against a grown dragon at full strength, enduring a blast of fire from its mouth and being swallowed by it without visibly losing her taste for the fight ‚Äì all this while sporting a stab wound to the torso from Angel which seemed to only offend and irritate as opposed to hurt her.Angel ‚Äì After the Fall #3 Her ability to alter time, while removed by the Mutari generator, seems to have at least partially returned as a result of the aftermath of L.A.'s relocation to hell. To what extent this ability can now be used has yet to be seen; during her fight with Angel, he reverted briefly to his former human self (Liam), his puppet self (\\"Smile Time\\") and a baby due to her manipulation of time, but the erratic nature of these shifts seems to indicate that she lacks any real control of her powers. Later in the series, it transpires that the only thing keeping her from her true primordial form in After the Fall are the remnants of Fred's personality; when Gunn 'kills' the Fred persona, her true Old One form is unleashed. Following After the Fall, after the Senior Partners reversed time so that the fall never occurred, Illyria was returned to her former late-Season Five levels. In the comic book Angel: Only Human, when facing her old enemy Baticus (who had been empowered with the energy drained from Illyria by the Mutari generator) Illyria again regained some of her former power, being able to teleport and freeze time. However, when she left the scene, she lost these powers. Following this, Illyria is depicted as more compassionate in this weakened form but must sleep at least 20 minutes for every ninety-four-hour period of activity. Subsequent to this, she appears in Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine (with blue-and-black hair) and comments on her full powers having been restored. She later loses her abilities in the same arc, and appears physically identical to Fred Burkle once again, albeit dressed in her standard leather costume. = Powers restored = Later, in her own IDW miniseries (Illyria: Haunted), Illyria visits the Deeper Well and finds a blue gem embedded in a wall of art depicting her true form that causes her to undergo a transformation; her hair is now completely blue, as are her eyes (as opposed to merely her irises), and all her powers are seemingly restored to her. She can once again communicate with and control plant life. Her power is enough to face Arsgomor, another Old One, in her human form and defeat him in battle, going so far as to regress it to an unhatched egg-like form and to effortlessly open doors in space and time.  Relationships  * Spike ‚Äì After her resurrection, Illyria shares an emerging bond with Spike. Each is on a path from demon to hero, and they share a love of violence. Their sparring sessions are mutually satisfactory; Spike hones his fighting techniques and Illyria is able to regularly inflict pain and dominate Spike in combat. She, at one point, expresses a desire to keep Spike as a pet. After Illyria's powers are diminished, Spike helps her regain confidence and venture into the world again. Their relationship remains non-romantic, but develops into mutual respect. In After the Fall, Illyria apparently considers Spike a pet and comes to his defense when Angel attacks him. * Wesley Wyndam-Pryce ‚Äì Though their \\"relationship\\" is not a true romantic one, the undertones of attraction being based mostly on Fred and Wesley's relationship, Wesley wanted to be around the one part of his deceased love and Illyria was influenced by Fred's memories. When Wesley dies at the hands of Cyvus Vail, Illyria takes revenge on Cyvus by putting her fist through his skull, killing him instantly. Afterwards, Illyria is the one who informs the team about Wesley's death and says that she feels grief and wishes \\"to do more violence\\" in the series finale's final battle. In After the Fall issue #9, Illyria takes ownership of Wesley's corpse, repeating \\"You're staying with me.\\" * Charles Gunn ‚Äì Possibly due to Illyria's memories of Fred she rescues Gunn from Wolfram and Hart's holding dimension and also tells him to not die in the finale, as he is \\"not unpleasant\\" to her eyes.  Appearances  ;Angel (2004) :Illyria was a regular towards the end of the Angel's fifth season in 2004, first appearing in \\"A Hole in the World,\\" replacing Fred. Technically, since she is played by the same actress as Fred, it could be said that she was credited as a regular from her first appearance, but the first instance of the opening sequence showing Amy Acker specifically as Illyria and not Fred is in \\"Underneath\\". Illyria appears in 8 episodes in total. Illyria has also appeared in Angel expanded universe material such as comics, most notably her own one-shot comic Illyria: Spotlight in 2006. ;Angel: After the Fall (2007‚Äì2011) :Central to the \\"Angel the Fall\\" storyline, Illyria has appeared in all but the first issue and the First Night stories of issues #7-8. She also appears in all four issues of the spin-off comic book series Spike: After the Fall, as well as Angel: Only Human with Gunn and her own miniseries, Illyria: Haunted. She also briefly appears in the first issue of Spike's miniseries. ;Fallen Angel (2009) :Illyria appears in the four part comic book series of Peter David's Fallen Angel Reborn in 2009.WizardUniverse.com According to PAD, \\"The story is set early in Illyria's involvement with Angel & Co. Having been deprived of her power by Wesley, she is drawn to [the town of] Bete Noire as a potential source for not only becoming what she was before, but even achieving her previous status. Remember, what we see of her in Angel is not her true appearance.\\" ;\\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine\\" (2012‚Äì2013) :Illyria debuts in issue 16, \\"Welcome to the Team, Part One.\\" ;\\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten\\" (2014‚Äì2016) :In Angel & Faith issue #10 Fred's soul was restored with The Return of The Magic. And Illyria was restored in Fred's vessel too. In the next issues Illyria tries to take control of vessel for revenge of her hominid times.

Chinese In Chinese, (usually appearing as ) or is used in casual writing to represent a doubled character. However, it is not used in formal writing anymore, and it never appeared in printed matter. In a tabulated table or list, vertical repetition can be represented by a ditto mark (). =History= Iteration marks have been occasionally used for more than two thousand years in China. The bronze script which is a kind of formal writing from the Zhou Dynasty, shown in excerpt to the right (click for the entire image of the full text), ends with ‚Äú‚Äù, where the small (‚Äútwo‚Äù) is used as iteration marks in the phrase ‚Äú‚Äù (\\"descendants to use and to treasure\\"). In certain Malayo-Polynesian languages In Filipino, Indonesian, and Malay words that are repeated can be shortened with the use of numeral \\"2\\". For example, kata-kata (words, from single 'kata') can be shortened to kata2, and jalan-jalan (to walk around, from single 'jalan') can be shortened to jalan2. The usage of \\"2\\" can also replaced with superscript \\"¬≤\\" (e.g. kata¬≤ for kata2). The sign may also be used for reduplicated compound words with slight sound changes, for example hingar¬≤ for hingar- bingar (commotion). Suffixes may also be added after \\"2\\", for example in the word kebarat¬≤an (western in nature, from the basic word barat (west) with the prefix ke- and suffix -an). The use of this mark dates back to the time when these languages were written with the Arabic script, specifically Jawi or Pegon variety. Using the Arabic numeral , words such as (rama-rama, butterfly) can be shortened to . The use of Arabic numeral were also adapted to several Brahmi derived scripts of the Malay archipelago, notably Javanese, Sundanese, Lontara, and Makassaran. As the latin alphabet was introduced to the region, western style Arabic numeral \\"2\\" came to be use for latin-based orthography. The use of \\"2\\" as an iteration mark was official in Indonesia up to 1972, as part of the Republican Spelling System. Its usage is discouraged when the Enhanced Indonesian Spelling System was adopted, and even though it commonly found in handwriting or old signage, it is considered to be inappropriate for formal writing and documents. Japanese Japanese has various iteration marks for its three writing systems, namely kanji, hiragana, and katakana, but only the (horizontal) kanji iteration mark () is commonly used today. In Japanese, iteration marks ( odoriji ‚Äúdancing mark‚Äù, kasaneji, kurikaeshikig≈ç, or hanpukukig≈ç, ‚Äúrepetition symbols‚Äù) are used to represent a duplicated character representing the same morpheme. For example, hitobito, \\"people\\", is usually written , using the kanji for with an iteration mark, , rather than , using the same kanji twice, though this latter is allowed, and in this simple case might be used because it is easier to write. By contrast, while hibi \\"daily, day after day\\" is written with the iteration mark, as the morpheme is duplicated, hinichi \\"number of days, date\\" is written with the character duplicated, because it represents different morphemes (hi and nichi). Further, while hibi can in principle be written (confusingly) as , hinichi cannot be written as , since that would imply repetition of the sound as well as the character. In potentially confusing examples such as this, readings can be disambiguated by writing words out in hiragana, so hinichi is often found as or even rather than . Note that sound changes can occur in duplication, which is not reflected in writing, such as hito + hito = hitobito (rendaku) or koku + koku = kokkoku (gemination), though this is also pronounced kokukoku. =Kanji= The formal name of the kanji repetition symbol () is d≈çnojiten () but is sometimes called noma () because it looks like the katakana no () and ma (). This symbol originates from a simplified form of the character , a variant of (\\"same\\") written in the Grass Script style. Although Japanese kanji iteration marks are borrowed from Chinese, the grammatical function of duplication differs, as do the conventions on the use of these characters. While Japanese does not have a grammatical plural form per se, some kanji can be reduplicated to indicate plurality (as a collective noun, not many individuals). This differs from Chinese, which normally repeats characters only for the purposes of adding emphasis, although there are some exceptions (e.g., r√©n person, r√©nr√©n everybody). : hito‚Äîperson; hitobito‚Äîpeople (not \\"persons\\") : yama‚Äîmountain; yamayama‚Äîmany mountains However, for some words duplication may alter the meaning: : ko‚Äîpiece, object; koko‚Äîpiece by piece, individually (also in Chinese) : toki‚Äîtime; tokidoki‚Äîsometimes (meaning often in Chinese) : yokujitsu‚Äînext day; yokuyokujitsu‚Äî\\"next next day\\" (two days later) Using instead of repeating kanji is usually the preferred form, with two restrictions: * the reading must be the same, possibly with sound change (as above), and * the repetition must be within a single word. When the reading is different, the second kanji is often simply written out to avoid confusion. Examples of such include: * hinichi * yutanpo * dedashi The repetition mark is not used in every case where two identical characters appear side by side, but only where the repetition itself is etymologically significant‚Äîwhen the repetition is part of a single morpheme (discrete word). Where a character ends up appearing twice as part of a compound, it is usually written out in full: : minshu-shugi‚Äî\\"democracy\\", from + (\\"democratic\\" + \\"rule\\"); the abbreviated is only occasionally seen. One notable exception is in signs for ‚Äì the name of neighborhoods often end in , which is then suffixed with yielding , which is then informally abbreviated to , despite the word break. Similarly, in certain Chinese borrowings, it is generally preferred to write out both characters, as in (ku-ku Chinese multiplication table) or (tan- tan-men dan dan noodles), though in practice is often used. , an iteration mark (derived from ) used only in vertical writing. In vertical writing, the character (Unicode U+303B), a cursive derivative of (\\"two\\", as in Chinese, above), can be employed instead, although this is increasingly rare. =Kana= Kana uses different iteration marks; one for hiragana, , and one for katakana, . The hiragana iteration mark is seen in some personal names like Sasaki or ≈åno, and it forms part of the formal name of the car company . Unlike the kanji iteration marks, which do not reflect sound changes, kana iteration marks closely reflect sound, and the kana iteration marks can be combined with the dakuten voicing mark to indicate that the repeated syllable should be voiced, for example Misuzu. If the first syllable is already voiced, for example jiji, the voiced repetition mark still needs to be used: rather than , which would be read as jishi. While widespread in old Japanese texts, the kana iteration marks are generally not used in modern Japanese outside proper names, though they may appear in informal handwritten texts. =Repeating multiple characters= A variety of iteration marks in use in a classical text. In addition to the single-character iteration marks, there are also two-character-sized repeat marks, which are used to repeat two or more characters. They are used in vertical writing only, and they are effectively obsolete in modern Japanese. The vertical kana repeat marks (unvoiced) and (voiced) resemble the hiragana character ku (), giving them their name, . They stretch to fill the space typically occupied by two characters, but may indicate a repetition of more than two characters‚Äîthey indicate that the preceding word or phrase be repeated. For example, the duplicated phrase may be repeated as ‚Äînote that here it repeats four characters. If a dakuten (voiced mark) is added, it applies to the first sound of the repeated word; this is written as . For example, tokorodokoro could be written horizontally as ; the voiced iteration mark only applies to the first sound . In addition to the single-character representations and , Unicode provides the half- character versions , and , which can be stacked to render both voiced and unvoiced repeat marks: { lang=\\"ja\\"  „Ä≥ „Äµ  „Ä¥ „Äµ } As support for these is limited, the ordinary forward slash and backward slash are occasionally used as substitutes. Alternatively, multiple single- character iteration marks can be used, as in tokorodokoro or bakabakashii. This practice is also uncommon in modern writing, though it is occasionally seen in horizontal writing as a substitute for the vertical repeat mark. Unlike the single-kana iteration mark, if the first kana is voiced, the unvoiced version alone will repeat the voiced sound. Further, if okurigana is present, then no iteration mark should be used, as in . This is prescribed by the Japanese Ministry of Education in its 1981 Cabinet notification prescribes, rule #6‚Äîsee okurigana article for elaboration. Tangut In Tangut manuscripts the sign is sometimes used to represent a doubled character; this sign does not occur in printed texts. In Unicode this character is , in the Ideographic Symbols and Punctuation block. Egyptian hieroglyphs In Egyptian hieroglyphs, the signs: zp:Z1*Z1 -- zp(wj) sn(wj), literally meaning ‚Äútwo times‚Äù, repeat the previous sign or word. Khmer, Thai and Lao In Khmer, leikt≈ç () as for Thai, mai yamok () and Lao, ko la () represent a repeated syllable where as it besides the word. This used to be written as numeral two (·ü¢) and the form changed over time. A repeated word could be used either, to demonstrate plurality, to emphasize or to soften the meaning of the original word.  Ditto mark  In English, Spanish, French, Italian, German, Portuguese, Czech, Polish and Turkish lists, the ditto mark (‚Ä≥) represents a word repeated from the equivalent position in the line above it; or an evenly-spaced row of ditto marks represents any number of words repeated from above. For example: * Two pounds of lettuce * Three ‚Ä≥ ‚Ä≥ tomatoes * Four ‚Ä≥ ‚Ä≥ onions * One pound ‚Ä≥ carrots This is common in handwriting and formerly in typewritten invoices etc. In Unicode, the ditto mark of Western languages has been defined to be equivalent to the . The separate character is to be used in the CJK scripts only.

On its formation in 1954, the authority was responsible for the United Kingdom's entire nuclear programme, both civil and defence, as well as the policing of nuclear sites. It made pioneering developments in nuclear (fission) power, overseeing the development of nuclear technology and performing much scientific research. However, since the early 1970s its areas of work have been gradually reduced, with functions transferred to other government organisations as well as to the private sector. The authority now focuses on United Kingdom and European fusion power research programmes at Culham in Oxfordshire, including the world's most powerful fusion device, the Joint European Torus. The research aims to develop fusion power as a commercially viable, environmentally sound energy source for the future. United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority owns the Culham Science Centre and has a stake in the Harwell Campus, and is involved in the development of both sites as locations for science and innovation-based business. It has also been involved in undertaking safety and reliability assessments for outside bodies, due to its long running experience in such work within the nuclear field. History The authority was established on 19 July 1954 when the Atomic Energy Authority Act 1954 received Royal Assent and gave the authority the power \\"to produce, use and dispose of atomic energy and carry out research into any matters therewith\\".UKAEA ‚Äì The First Fifty Years, Andy Munn, http://www.caithness.org/fpb/dounreay/history/index.htm The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority was formed from the Ministry of Supply, Department of Atomic Energy and inherited its facilities and most of its personnel on its formation. The first chairman was Sir Edwin Plowden, with board members running the three major divisions: * Industrial Group: Sir Christopher Hinton * Research Group: Sir John Cockcroft * Weapons Group: Sir William Penney United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority inherited nearly 20,000 employees, which doubled to 41,000 by 1961. Most of United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority's early activities were related to the Nuclear weapons and the United Kingdom nuclear weapons programme, and the need for plutonium, highly enriched uranium, and materials for hydrogen bombs. Between 1952 and 1958 UKAEA carried out 21 nuclear weapon tests in Australia and the Pacific. Following the Atomic Energy Authority Act 1971, the authority was split into three, with only research activities remaining with the Authority. The Radiochemical Centre Ltd took over production of medical and industrial radioisotopes and was later privatised in 1982 as Amersham plc. British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL) took over nuclear fuel and weapons material producing activities: the manufacturing plant at Springfields, the enrichment plant at Capenhurst, the spent-fuel facility at Windscale, and the dual-purpose Calder Hall and Chapelcross military plutonium producing reactors. Additional link The Atomic Energy Authority (Weapons Group) Act 1973 transferred responsibility for management of the UK's nuclear deterrent, including the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston, directly to the Ministry of Defence. In 1982 the authority was involved in the creation of Nirex, to develop and operate radioactive waste disposal facilities in the United Kingdom. The Atomic Energy Authority Act 1986 put the authority into trading fund mode, requiring it to act and account as though it were a commercial enterprise and become self-financing. The authority was then split again by the Atomic Energy Authority Act 1995, with the more commercial parts transferred into a public company AEA Technology, which was then floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1996. The nuclear facilities used for the UK's research and development programme, which held large decommissioning liabilities, were retained. The role of the authority became to decommission these nuclear assets and to restore the environment around the sites. From the early 1990s the authority completed more decommissioning work than anyone in Europe, and had considerable success in regenerating former nuclear sites for commercial use. Following the Energy Act 2004, on 1 April 2005 the UK's specialist nuclear police force, the UK Atomic Energy Authority Constabulary, was reconstituted as the Civil Nuclear Constabulary. Responsibility for the force was also removed from the authority and transferred to the Civil Nuclear Police Authority. The 2004 Act also established the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), which on 1 April 2005 took ownership and responsibility for the liabilities relating to the cleanup of UK nuclear sites. The authority became a contractor for the NDA for the decommissioning work at Dounreay, Harwell, Windscale, Winfrith and the JET facilities at Culham. On 1 April 2008, the Authority announced a major re-structuring to meet its decommissioning obligations with the NDA. A new wholly owned subsidiary, UKAEA Limited, was formed with established expertise from the existing company, to focus on nuclear decommissioning and environmental restoration management and consultancy in the United Kingdom and international markets. At the same time, Dounreay Site Restoration Limited (DSRL) was formed out of the existing Authority team at Dounreay and was licensed by the Health and Safety Executive to operate the site and carry out its decommissioning under the Authority's management. DSRL became a subsidiary of United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority Limited. In parallel with these changes, the site at Windscale in Cumbria was transferred to Sellafield Ltd, a site licence company under contract to the NDA, following close review and scrutiny by the Health and Safety Executive and environmental and security regulators. The majority of authority employees at the site transferred to Sellafield Ltd. On 2 February 2009, the authority announced the next stage in restructuring. Research Sites Restoration Limited (RSRL), was formed from the existing teams at Harwell in Oxfordshire and Winfrith in Dorset and licensed by the Health and Safety Executive to operate those sites. RSRL continued the decommissioning programmes for Harwell and Winfrith on behalf of the NDA. RSRL also became a subsidiary of UKAEA Limited. In October 2009, Babcock International Group plc acquired UKAEA Limited, the nuclear clean-up subsidiary of the authority, including its subsidiary companies DSRL and RSRL. In 2009 the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy (CCFE) was launched as the new name for the home of United Kingdom fusion research. In 2014 UKAEA announced the creation of a new branch of research, using expertise gained from the remote handling system created for JET to form a new centre for robotics known as RACE (Remote Applications in Challenging Environments). The Authority has continued to expand its facilities at Culham in recent years, with the opening of a Materials Research Facility in 2016 and creation of the Oxfordshire Advanced Skills apprentice training centre.  Current activities  United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority states its mission as \\"to lead the commercial development of fusion power and related technology and position the United Kingdom as a leader in sustainable nuclear energy.\\" Its research programmes include a number of laboratories and other facilities at the Culham site. A plasma test in the MAST experiment at Culham Centre for Fusion Energy, 2013. = Facilities and programmes =  Culham Centre for Fusion Energy (CCFE)  The UK's national laboratory for fusion research, Culham Centre for Fusion Energy undertakes plasma theory and modelling studies to establish the physics basis for future fusion powerplants. It also studies the materials and engineering technology of tokamak fusion reactors. The centrepiece of CCFE's programme is the MAST Upgrade spherical tokamak experiment - the successor to the MAST device - which is expected to begin operation in 2019. CCFE also operates and maintains the Joint European Torus (JET) for its research partners around Europe, and is a member of the co-ordinated R&D; programme led by the EUROfusion consortium.  Materials Research Facility  UKAEA's Materials Research Facility carries out micro-characterisation of radioactive materials for researchers in both nuclear fusion and fission. It is open to users from academic and commercial organisations, aiming to bridge the gap between university laboratories and those at nuclear licensed sites. It is part of the National Nuclear Users' Facility and has received funding from the Henry Royce Institute.  Oxfordshire Advanced Skills  A partnership between United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority and the Science & Technology Facilities Council, Oxfordshire Advanced Skills is an apprentice training centre located at Culham Science Centre. It offers training for technicians in engineering and hi-tech disciplines, with the intention of providing local employers with highly skilled recruits ready to enter the workplace. Training is provided by the Manufacturing Technology Centre.  Remote Applications in Challenging Environments (RACE)  RACE is a test facility for robotics and autonomous systems. It grew out of UKAEA's remote handling operations at the JET nuclear fusion device, which date back to the 1990s. The UK Government funded the construction of the RACE centre at Culham with the intention of taking the knowledge gained at JET into other industries with 'challenging environments' where it is difficult for humans to perform work. RACE currently works with organisations in nuclear fusion and fission, with large physics facilities and with autonomous vehicle developers.  Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (STEP)  The ¬£220 million STEP programme aims to accelerate the delivery of fusion power to the energy market. STEP will be a prototype reactor capable of demonstrating fusion as a viable technology for electricity generation. It uses the compact 'spherical tokamak' concept developed by UKAEA at Culham Centre for Fusion Energy. STEP is currently in a five-year conceptual design phase and is expected to be constructed and operational by 2040.  Future plans  In December 2017, UKAEA announced plans for two further fusion research centres: Hydrogen-3 Advanced Technology (H3AT) and Fusion Technology Facilities. H3AT, located at Culham, will study the processing and storage of tritium, one of the two fuels expected to supply commercial fusion reactors. The Fusion Technology Facilities, based at both Culham and at a new UKAEA Yorkshire site in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, will carry out thermal, mechanical, hydraulic and electromagnetic tests on prototype components to replicate the conditions experienced inside fusion reactors. Both centres are scheduled to open in 2020/21.

In other words, it is a symmetric function of the pair of triangles. Pedoe's inequality is a generalization of Weitzenb√∂ck's inequality, which is the case in which one of the triangles is equilateral. Pedoe discovered the inequality in 1941 and published it subsequently in several articles. Later he learned that the inequality was already known in the 19th century to Neuberg, who however did not prove that the equality implies the similarity of the two triangles.

L. No. 103-141, 107 Stat. 1488 (November 16, 1993), codified at through (also known as RFRA), is a 1993 United States federal law that \\"ensures that interests in religious freedom are protected.\\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/13pdf/13-354_olp1.pdf The bill was introduced by Congressman Chuck Schumer (D-NY) on March 11, 1993. A companion bill was introduced in the Senate by Ted Kennedy (D-MA) the same day. A unanimous U.S. House and a nearly unanimous U.S. Senate‚Äîthree senators voted against passage‚Äîpassed the bill, and President Bill Clinton signed it into law. RFRA was held unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court, as applied to the states in the City of Boerne v. Flores decision in 1997, which ruled that the RFRA is not a proper exercise of Congress's enforcement power. However, it continues to be applied to the federal government‚Äîfor instance, in Gonzales v. O Centro Esp√≠rita Beneficente Uni√£o do Vegetal (2006) and Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. (2014). These cases did not consider whether Congress was violating the Establishment Clause if it carves out exemptions based on religious laws from federal laws and regulations that it itself has authorized. In response to City of Boerne v. Flores and other related RFR issues, twenty-one individual states have passed State Religious Freedom Restoration Acts that apply to state governments and local municipalities. Provisions This law reinstated the Sherbert Test, which was set forth by Sherbert v. Verner, and Wisconsin v. Yoder, mandating that strict scrutiny be used when determining whether the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, guaranteeing religious freedom, has been violated. In the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, Congress states in its findings that a religiously neutral law can burden a religion just as much as one that was intended to interfere with religion;Religious Freedom Restoration Act full text at http://www.prop1.org/rainbow/rfra.htm therefore the Act states that the \\"Government shall not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability.\\" The law provided an exception if two conditions are both met. First, the burden must be necessary for the \\"furtherance of a compelling government interest.\\" Under strict scrutiny, a government interest is compelling when it is more than routine and does more than simply improve government efficiency. A compelling interest relates directly with core constitutional issues. The second condition is that the rule must be the least restrictive way in which to further the government interest. Background and passage This tipi is used for peyote ceremonies in the Native American Church, one of the main religions affected by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act The Religious Freedom Restoration Act applies to all religions, but is most pertinent to Native American religions that are burdened by increasing expansion of government projects onto sacred land. In Native American religion the land they worship on is very important. Often the particular ceremonies can only take place in certain locations because these locations have special significance. This, along with peyote use, are the main parts of Native American religions that are often left unprotected. The Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment states that Congress shall not pass laws prohibiting the free exercise of religion. In the 1960s, the Supreme Court interpreted this as banning laws that burdened a person's exercise of religion (e.g. Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398 (1963); Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972)). But in the 1980s the Court began to allow legislation that incidentally prohibited religiously mandatory activities as long as the ban was \\"generally applicable\\" to all citizens. Also, the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, intended to protect the freedoms of tribal religions, was lacking enforcement. This led to the key cases leading up to the RFRA, which were Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Association, 485 U.S. 439 (1988), and Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990). In Lyng, the Court was unfavorable to sacred land rights. Members of the Yurok, Tolowa and Karok tribes tried to use the First Amendment to prevent a road from being built by the U.S. Forest Service through sacred land. The land that the road would go through consisted of gathering sites for natural resources used in ceremonies and praying sites. The Supreme Court ruled that this was not an adequate legal burden because the government was not coercing or punishing them for their religious beliefs. In Smith the Court upheld the state of Oregon's refusal to give unemployment benefits to two Native Americans fired from their jobs at a rehab clinic after testing positive for mescaline, the main psychoactive compound in the peyote cactus, which they used in a religious ceremony. Peyote use has been a common practice in Native American tribes for centuries. It was integrated with Christianity into what is now known as the Native American Church. The Smith decision outraged the public. Many groups came together. Both liberal (like the American Civil Liberties Union) and conservative groups (like the Traditional Values Coalition) as well as other groups such as the Christian Legal Society, the American Jewish Congress, the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty, and the National Association of Evangelicals joined forces to support RFRA, which would reinstate the Sherbert Test, overturning laws if they burden a religion. The act, which was Congress's reaction to the Lyng and Smith cases, passed the House unanimously and the Senate 97 to 3 and was signed by U.S. President Bill Clinton. =Applicability= The RFRA applies \\"to all Federal law, and the implementation of that law, whether statutory or otherwise\\", including any Federal statutory law adopted after the RFRA's date of signing \\"unless such law explicitly excludes such application.\\"42 U.S. Code ¬ß 2000bb‚Äì3 Applicability According to a federal appeals court ruling on March 7, 2018, the RFRA does not justify discrimination against employees on the basis of their lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender identity. However, on October 15, 2019, federal judge Reed O‚ÄôConnor said that, because of the RFRA, federally- funded healthcare insurers and providers must be allowed to deny medical treatment and coverage on the basis of the sex, gender identity or termination of pregnancy of the person who is requesting the services, even if the services are medically necessary. Transgender people may be turned down even if the healthcare service they need is not related to their being transgender. Challenges and weaknesses The peyote cactus, the source of the mescaline used by some Native Americans in religious ceremonies. In 1997, part of this act was overturned by the United States Supreme Court. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Antonio wanted to enlarge a church in Boerne, Texas. But a Boerne ordinance protected the building as a historic landmark and did not permit it to be torn down. The church sued, citing RFRA, and in the resulting case, City of Boerne v. Flores, , the Supreme Court struck down the RFRA with respect to its applicability to States (but not Federally), stating that Congress had stepped beyond their power of enforcement provided in the Fourteenth Amendment. In response to the Boerne ruling, Congress passed the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (RLUIPA) in 2000, which grants special privileges to religious land owners. A number of states have passed state RFRAs, applying the rule to the laws of their own state, but the Smith case remains the authority in these matters in many states. The constitutionality of RFRA as applied to the federal government was confirmed on February 21, 2006, as the Supreme Court ruled against the government in Gonzales v. O Centro Esp√≠rita Beneficente Uni√£o do Vegetal, , which involved the use of an otherwise illegal substance in a religious ceremony, stating that the federal government must show a compelling state interest in restricting religious conduct.When the US Supreme Court, in its judgment of 21 February 2006 on the case Gonzales v. O Centro Esp√≠rita Beneficente Uni√£o do Vegetal (no. 04-1084 ), held that the sacramental use of hoasca (a tea leaf containing hallucinogen) cannot be inhibited to believers of that confession, it did so under clause general contained in the religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, which leaves it to the judge to decide if there is a burden unfairly overloaded by the government on the free exercise of the religion of its citizens: Post-Smith, many members of the Native American Church still had issues using peyote in their ceremonies. This led to the Religious Freedom Act Amendments in 1994, which state, \\"the use, possession, or transportation of peyote by an Indian for bona fide traditional ceremony purposes in connection with the practice of a traditional Indian religion is lawful, and shall not be prohibited by the United States or any state. No Indian shall be penalized or discriminated against on the basis of such use, possession or transportation.\\" Applications and effects The Religious Freedom Restoration Act holds the federal government responsible for accepting additional obligations to protect religious exercise. In O'Bryan v. Bureau of Prisons, it was found that the RFRA governs the actions of federal officers and agencies and that the RFRA can be applied to \\"internal operations of the federal government.\\" RFRA, in conjunction with President Bill Clinton's executive order in 1996, provided more security for sacred sites for Native American religious rites. As of 1996, the year before the RFRA was found unconstitutional as applied to states, 337 cases had cited RFRA in its three- year time range. It was also found that Jewish, Muslim, and Native American religions, which make up only three percent of religious membership in the U.S., make up 18 percent of the cases involving the free exercise of religion. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act was a cornerstone for tribes challenging the National Forest Service's plans to permit upgrades to Arizona's Snowbowl ski resort. Six tribes were involved, including the Navajo, Hopi, Havasupai, and Hualapai. The tribes objected on religious grounds to the plans to use reclaimed water. They felt that this risked infecting the tribal members with \\"ghost sickness\\" as the water would be from mortuaries and hospitals. They also felt that the reclaimed water would contaminate the plant life used in ceremonies. In August 2008, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected their RFRA claim.535 F.3d 1058RFRA Land Use Challenges After Navajo Nation v. U.S. Parks Service, University of Houston Law Center. In the case of Adams v. Commissioner, the United States Tax Court rejected the argument of Priscilla M. Lippincott Adams, who was a devout Quaker. She tried to argue that under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, she was exempt from federal income taxes. The U.S. Tax Court rejected her argument and ruled that she was not exempt. The Court stated that \\"while petitioner's religious beliefs are substantially burdened by payment of taxes that fund military expenditures, the Supreme Court has established that uniform, mandatory participation in the Federal income tax system, irrespective of religious belief, is a compelling governmental interest.\\"See Adams v. Commissioner, 110 T.C. 137 (1998), at . In the case of Miller v. Commissioner, the taxpayers objected to the use of social security numbers, arguing that such numbers related to the \\"mark of the beast\\" from the Bible. In its decision, the U.S. Court discussed the applicability of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, but ruled against the taxpayers.See Miller v. Commissioner, 114 T.C. 511 (2000), at . In Navajo Nation v. United States Forest Service, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the use of recycled sewage water in order to manufacture artificial snow in the San Francisco Peaks was not a \\"substantial burden\\" on the religious freedom of Native Americans. The RFRA figured prominently in oral arguments in the case, Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, heard by the Supreme Court on March 25, 2014.https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/13-354_5436.pdf In a 5-4 decision, Justice Alito declared that nothing about the language of RFRA or the manner in which Congress passed it implied the statutory protections conferred therein were confined solely within the bounds of First Amendment case law as it existed pre-Smith.See Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, 114 T.C. 511 (2014), at . 20th anniversary A day-long symposium was held at the Newseum in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 7, 2013, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. \\"Restored or Endangered? The State of the Free Exercise of Religion in America\\" featured three panel discussions and two keynote addresses. The first keynote address was from Oliver S. Thomas, the former general counsel of the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty and the chair of the diverse \\"Coalition for the Free Exercise of Religion\\" in the 1990s that worked for the passage of RFRA. The second was from Douglas Laycock, who was an author of RFRA. His address traced the legal history of RFRA and discussed its impact on current debates, including the contraception mandate and same-sex marriage laws. The panel discussions covered the history and impact of RFRA, religious freedom and the contraceptive mandate of the Affordable Care Act, and current and future challenges to the free exercise of religion in a diverse society. The addresses and panel discussions are all available online, as well as a special downloadable resource with more on RFRA, published by the Baptist Joint Committee.

Flores, 521 U.S. 507 (1997), was a landmark decision of the US Supreme Court concerning the scope of Congress's power of enforcement under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. The case also had a significant impact on historic preservation. Facts The basis for dispute arose when the Catholic Archbishop of San Antonio, Patrick Flores, applied for a building permit to enlarge the 1923 mission-style St. Peter's Church in Boerne, Texas, which was originally built by German residents.Miller, Julia. \\"U.S. Supreme Court Declares RFRA Unconstitutional in Texas Religious Landmarking Case,\\" Preservation Law Reporter (PLR) 16, p. 1053 The building was located in a historic district and considered a contributing property. Local zoning authorities denied the permit, citing an ordinance governing additions and new construction in a historic district. The Archbishop brought suit, challenging the ruling under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) of 1993. Flores argued that the Boerne, Texas, congregation had outgrown the existing structure, rendering the ruling a substantial burden on the free exercise of religion without a compelling state interest.PLR 16, p.1053 Religious Freedom Restoration Act RFRA had been crafted as a direct response to the Supreme Court's decision in Employment Division v. Smith,. when the Court had upheld, against a First Amendment challenge, an Oregon law criminalizing peyote use, which was used in Native American religious rituals.Mauro, Tony. Illustrated Great Decisions of the Supreme Court. Washington D.C.: CQ Press, 2000. The State of Oregon won on the basis that the drug laws were \\"non- discriminatory laws of general applicability.\\"Minan, John H. \\"Historic Preservation and Religious Uses,\\" 1997. Religious groups became concerned that this case would be cited as precedent for further regulation of common religious practices and lobbied Congress for legislative protection.Mauro, Tony. p.38 RFRA provided a strict scrutiny standard, requiring narrowly tailored regulation serving a compelling government interest in any case substantially burdening the free exercise of religion, regardless of the intent and general applicability of the law.Minan, John H. The RFRA applies to all laws passed by Congress prior to its enactment and to all future laws that are not explicitly exempted. (42 U.S. Code ¬ß 2000bb‚Äì3) Congress' power to do so was not challenged. Congress also applied the law to state and local governments, the City of Boerne in this case, relying on the Fourteenth Amendment, particularly Section 5: \\"The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.\\" Result =District Court= The City of Boerne was successful at the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas; the District Judge certified the question of the constitutionality of RFRA to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which found the RFRA constitutional. Boerne filed a certiorari petition to the Supreme Court. The National Trust for Historic Preservation, among other preservation organizations, filed briefs in support of Boerne. =Supreme Court= The Court, in an opinion by Justice Anthony Kennedy, struck down RFRA as it applies to the states as an unconstitutional use of Congress's enforcement powers. The Court held that it holds the sole power to define the substantive rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment--a definition to which Congress may not add and from which it may not subtract. Congress could not constitutionally enact RFRA because the law was not designed to have \\"congruence and proportionality\\" with the substantive rights that the Court had defined. Although Congress could enact \\"remedial\\" or \\"preventative\\" legislation to guarantee rights not exactly congruent with those defined by the Court, it could only do so to more effectively prevent, deter, or correct violations of those rights actually guaranteed by the Court. RFRA was seen disproportionate in its effects compared to its objective. Justice Kennedy wrote: Moreover, remedial or prophylactic legislation still had to show \\"congruence and proportionality\\" between the end it aimed to reach (that is, the violations it aimed to correct), and the means it chose to reach those ends--that is, the penalties or prohibitions it enacted to prevent or correct those violations. Because RFRA was not reasonably remedial or preventative, it was unconstitutional. Implications =Congruence and proportionality= Boerne is important for several reasons. One is that it introduced a completely new test for deciding whether Congress had exceeded its Section 5 powers: the \\"congruence and proportionality\\" test, a test that has proven to have great importance in the context of the Eleventh Amendment. Another reason was that it explicitly declared that the Court alone has the ability to state which rights are protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. Still another was that it had First Amendment consequences in that it spelled the end for any legislative attempts to overturn Employment Division v. Smith. The \\"congruence and proportionality\\" requirement replaced the previous theory advanced in Katzenbach v. Morgan that the Equal Protection Clause is \\"a positive grant of legislative power authorizing Congress to exercise its discretion in determining the need for and nature of legislation to secure Fourteenth Amendment guarantees.\\" Before the 1997 Boerne decision, Katzenbach v. Morgan was often interpreted as allowing Congress to go beyond, but not fall short of, the Court's interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause. But that is not how the majority opinion in Boerne interpreted Katzenbach: The holding of Boerne said that only the Court could interpret the Constitution, in order to maintain the \\"traditional separation of powers between Congress and the Judiciary.\\" Also, Boerne relied on arguments for protecting the rights that pertain to state governmentsTo support its argument that Congress lacked plenary power to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Court pointed to a proposed enforcement provision which was rejected by the Congress that eventually approved the Fourteenth Amendment: :\\"Democrats and conservative Republicans argued that the proposed Amendment would give Congress a power to intrude into traditional areas of state responsibility, a power inconsistent with the federal design central to the Constitution. Typifying these views, Republican Representative Robert Hale of New York labeled the Amendment 'an utter departure from every principle ever dreamed of by the men who framed our Constitution,' and warned that under it 'all State legislation, in its codes of civil and criminal jurisprudence and procedures ‚Ä¶ may be overridden, may be repealed or abolished, and the law of Congress established instead.' Senator William Stewart of Nevada likewise stated the Amendment would permit 'Congress to legislate fully upon all subjects affecting life, liberty, and property,' such that 'there would not be much left for the State Legislatures,' and would thereby 'work an entire change in our form of government.'\\" 521 U.S. at 521 (citations omitted). based on \\"enumerated powers.\\" The intent of Boerne was to prevent \\"a considerable congressional intrusion into the States' traditional prerogatives and general authority.\\" The holding of Boerne specifically mentioned the state action doctrine of the Civil Rights Cases as a Court interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause that limits the \\"remedial or preventive\\" power of Congress. =Constitutionality of the RFRA= This case has been used to claim that the federal RFRA is \\"unconstitutional\\". A more precise and accurate phrasing of this claim is that Boerne held the RFRA could not be constitutionally applied to state and local governments. At the federal level, the RFRA remains operative. The constitutionality of one aspect of RFRA as applied to the federal government was confirmed on February 21, 2006, as the Supreme Court ruled against the government in Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal, , which involved the use of an otherwise illegal substance in a religious ceremony, stating that the federal government must show a compelling state interest in restricting religious conduct. =Historic preservation= The Supreme Court's decision in City of Boerne made a significant impact on the states' abilities to enforce laws, including those pertaining to historic preservation. Under RFRA, an otherwise neutral state law--such as zoning, or historic preservation ordinances--needed to be scrutinized if its enforcement involved a religious group or individual. Therefore, by declaring extension of RFRA to apply against state laws unconstitutional, the ability of the states to establish and maintain historic preservation ordinances was made easier.PLR 16, p. 1052. However, in 2000, Congress enacted the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, in which it used the Spending Clause to require, for localities that receive federal funding, land use laws to accommodate religious freedom, essentially, as if RFRA had been ruled applicable to state law.

Half of a sound wave is made up of the compression of the medium, and the other half is the decompression or rarefaction of the medium. Rarefaction is the reduction of an item's density, the opposite of compression. Like compression, which can travel in waves (sound waves, for instance), rarefaction waves also exist in nature. A common rarefaction wave is the area of low relative pressure following a shock wave (see picture). Rarefaction waves expand with time (much like sea waves spread out as they reach a beach); in most cases rarefaction waves keep the same overall profile ('shape') at all times throughout the wave's movement: it is a self-similar expansion. Each part of the wave travels at the local speed of sound, in the local medium. This expansion behaviour is in contrast to the behaviour of pressure increases, which gets narrower with time, until they steepen into shock waves. Physical examples A natural example of rarefaction occurs in the layers of Earth's atmosphere. Because the atmosphere has mass, most atmospheric matter is nearer to the Earth due to the Earth's gravitation. Therefore, air at higher layers of the atmosphere is less dense, or rarefied, relative to air at lower layers. Thus rarefaction can refer either to a reduction in density over space at a single point of time, or a reduction of density over time for one particular area. Rarefaction can be easily observed by compressing a spring and releasing it. Instead of seeing compressed loops seeming to move through the spring, spaced-out loops move through it: rarefaction waves. In manufacturing Modern construction of guitars is an example of using rarefaction in manufacturing. By forcing the reduction of density (loss of oils and other impurities) in the cellular structure of the soundboard, a rarefied guitar top produces a tonal decompression affecting the sound of the instrument, mimicking aged wood.

Etymology The English name is an anglicisation of Urdu qormƒÅ, meaning \\"braise\\".Perry, C. \\"Korma, Kavurma, Ghormeh: A family, or not so much?\\" in Hosking (ed.) Food and Language: Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cooking 2009, p. 254 It refers to the cooking technique used in the dish.Singh, D. Indian Cookery, Penguin, 1970, pp. 24‚Äì25\\"korma\\", Merriam-Webster, accessed 30-01-18 All these words, and the names of dishes such as ghormeh () and the Azerbaijani qovurma or kavarma, are ultimately derived from a Turkic word qawirma, meaning \\"[a] fried thing\\". The Indian korma is, however, possibly unrelated in a culinary sense to the modern Turkish kavurma or to some other dishes using the same root word, as they use widely varying techniques and ingredients.Perry (2009), p. 256 History Korma has its roots in the Mughlai cuisine of the Indian subcontinent. A characteristic Mughal dish, it can be traced back to the 16th century and to the Mughal incursions into the region. Kormas were often prepared in the Mughal court kitchens, such as the famous white korma, perhaps garnished with vark, said to have been served to Shah Jahan and his guests at the inauguration of the Taj Mahal.Chapman, India: Food and Cooking, New Holland, 2009, p. 26 Classically, a korma is defined as a dish where meat or vegetables are braised with yogurt, cream or stock added. The technique covers many different styles of korma. The flavour of a korma is based on a mixture of spices, including ground coriander and cumin, combined with yogurt kept below curdling temperature and incorporated slowly and carefully with the meat juices. Traditionally, this would have been carried out in a pot set over a very low fire, with charcoal on the lid to provide all-round heat. A korma can be mildly spiced or fiery and may use lamb, goat meat, chicken, beef or game; some kormas combine meat and vegetables such as spinach and turnip. The term Shahi (), used for some kormas indicates its status as a prestige dish, rather than an everyday meal, and its association with the court. Preparation A chicken korma dish The korma style is similar to other braising techniques in that the meat or vegetable is first cooked briskly, or seared, using a high heat, traditionally using ghee, and then subjected to long, slow cooking using moist heat and a minimum of added liquid. The pot may be sealed with dough during the last stages of cooking, using a technique called dum or dampokhtak. The korma can make use of a technique called bagar: later in the cooking, additional spices are mixed with heated ghee and then combined with the sauce formed by the braising; the pan is then covered and shaken to release steam and mix the contents.Singh, p. 26 There is a wide variation between individual korma and other \\"curry\\" recipes. Chilli and ginger are often used, but the precise method of preparation results in widely different flavors. Indian bay leaves or dried coconut may be added, the latter being a predominantly South Indian flavoring. A korma pilau (pilaf) is a rice and meat dish made with braised meat.Singh, p. 154 Variations =In the United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom, a typical korma as served in curry houses is a mildly spiced dish with a thick sauce. It often features almonds, cashews or other nuts, and coconut or coconut milk. In the 21st-century chicken korma has several times been cited as the most popular curry in the UK, replacing chicken tikka masala in surveys of public eating habits.\\"Chicken tikka masala no longer Britain's favourite curry ‚Äì here's the new titleholder\\", Daily Mirror, 07-10-17 =Navratan korma= Navratan korma (Mughal kitchen) Navratan korma is a vegetarian korma made with vegetables and either paneer (an Indian cheese) or nuts ‚Äì or sometimes both. Navratan means \\"nine gems\\", and it is common for the recipe to include nine different vegetables. = Eid korma = In some parts of South Asia, korma is used to denote a traditional Eid al-adha (festival of the sacrifice) dish of lamb, goat or cow that is braised in minimal or no spices. The flavour comes from the meat and fat of the chosen cuts. It was often done to preserve meats for a short-term period, as the fat layer forms a barrier to help prevent spoilage, similar to potted beef.

It is one of the few modern era, independent monarchies that have existed in the Americas along with the Brazilian Empire and the two Haitian Empires. Agust√≠n de Iturbide, the sole monarch of the empire, was originally a Mexican military commander under whose leadership independence from Spain was gained in September 1821. His popularity culminated in mass demonstrations on May 18, 1822 in favor of making him Emperor of the new nation, and the very next day congress hastily approved the matter. A sumptuous coronation ceremony followed in July. The empire was plagued throughout its short existence by questions about its legality, conflicts between congress and the emperor, and a bankrupt treasury. Iturbide shut down Congress in October 1822, and by December of that year had begun to lose support of the army which revolted in favor of restoring Congress. After failing to put down the revolt, Iturbide reconvened Congress in March, 1823 and offered his abdication, upon which power passed over to a Provisional Government. Background Coat of arms of the First Mexican Empire. Mexico's War of Independence which began in 1810, lasted eleven years and was far from being a homogeneous movement. Its initial purpose, as proclaimed in the Cry of Dolores was to support the return of Ferdinand VII to the throne of Spain after having been overthrown by Napoleon, but later the cause of absolute independence from Spain was adopted by insurgent leaders such as Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos. The Spanish managed to mostly defeat the independence movement, and after Morelos' execution in 1815, the remaining rebels were reduced to waging guerilla warfare in the countryside. Agust√≠n de Iturbide was a Mexican officer in the Spanish army, representative of the Mexican elite who were initially loyal to Spain, but later saw their interests threatened by the liberal 1820 Revolution in Spain. In view of this, Iturbide began to lead a movement to pact with the remaining insurgents and support the separation of Mexico from the Spanish metropole. The movement involved three principles, or \\"guarantees,\\": that Mexico would be an independent constitutional monarchy governed by a Spanish prince; that Americanos, that is all those Mexican-born (regardless of previous racial category), and those Spanish-born would henceforth enjoy equal rights and privileges; and that the Roman Catholic Church would retain its privileges and position as the official and exclusive religion of the land. These Three Guarantees formed the core of the Plan of Iguala, the revolutionary blueprint which, by combining the goal of independence and a constitution with the preservation of Catholic monarchy, brought together all Mexican factions. Under the 24 February 1821 Plan of Iguala, to which most of the provinces subscribed, the Mexican Congress established a regency council which was headed by Iturbide. Viceroy Juan O'Donoj√∫ acceded to the Mexican demands, and signed the Treaty of C√≥rdoba on August 24, 1821. The Mexican Congress intended to establish a personal union, whereby King Fernando VII of Spain would also be king of Mexico, but both countries would be governed by separate laws and through separate legislative bodies. If the king refused the position, the law provided for another member of the House of Bourbon to accede to the Mexican throne.The Birth of Modern Mexico, 1780‚Äì1824 Commissioners from Mexico were sent to Spain to offer the Mexican throne, but the Spanish government refused to recognize Mexico's independence and would not allow any other Spanish prince to accept the throne. Election With Ferdinand VII having rejected the Treaty of Cordoba, Iturbide's supporters saw an opportunity to place their candidate on the throne. On the night of May 18, the 1st infantry regiment, stationed at the ex Convent of San Hip√≥lito, and led by sergeant Pio Marcha began a public demonstration in favor of Iturbide being made emperor. The demonstration was joined by other barracks and many civilians as well. When the public demonstration reached his home, Iturbide himself was able to address the demonstrators from his balcony. He consulted with members of the regency on what course to follow, and eventually acquiesced to the demonstrator's demands, agreeing that he should be made emperor. The crowd celebrated the rest of the night with fireworks and celebratory gunfire. An extraordinary session of congress was held the following morning to deal with the subject of Iturbide's coronation. At the opening of the session, the military addressed a manifesto to congress, endorsing Iturbide to be emperor. The deliberations then started with a few deputies expressing concern that congress was not entirely free in the present circumstances to proceed on the matter. A pro- Iturbide crowd outside of the hall was making so much noise that it was interfering with the deliberations, and congress asked Iturbide to show up in an unsuccessful attempt to calm the crowds. The opposition brought up concerns that a popular demonstration in the capital was not enough of a basis upon which to elect Iturbide and that the provinces ought to be consulted first. A proposal was made to gain the consent of two thirds of the provinces, and this succeeding then to appoint a commission to write a provisional constitution in order to avoid constitutional crises. Deputy Valent√≠n G√≥mez Far√≠as, future president of Mexico, stood up for the legality of congress to elect an emperor. He praised Iturbide's services to the nation, and argued that as Spain had rejected the Treaty of C√≥rdoba, Congress was now authorized by that very treaty to hold an election to decide who the emperor was to be. The vote then proceeded. In the final results, sixty-seven deputies voted in favor of making Iturbide Emperor, while fifteen voted against. The vote however was short of a legal quorum of one hundred and two deputies. Coronation Congress, however resigned itself to the situation, and a plan to establish a constitutional monarchy united both conservatives and liberals at a time when it was uncertain which form of government would be best for independent Mexico. Congress published an oath binding the emperor to obey the constitution, which Iturbide subsequently took, and Congress also declared the Mexican monarchy to be hereditary, granting titles of nobility to Iturbide's family. His son and heir became Prince Imperial of Mexico. The 19th of May was made a national holiday, and a royal household was organized. July 21, 1822 was set as the date of the official coronation. Iturbide's court was being set up to be more luxurious than that of the Viceroy, a situation which provoked some opposition in a new nation that was essentially bankrupt. To remedy the financial difficulties, the Mexican government prohibited the exportation of money, and exacted a forced loan of 600,000 pesos from the private sector in Mexico City, Puebla, Guadalajara, and Veracruz. During this time, a council of state was also formed, being made up of thirteen members selected by the Emperor from a list of thirty one nominees submitted by congress. The coronation took place on July 21. The capital was decked out in floral arrangements, banners, streamers, and flags. The government could not afford to forge a crown, and therefore jewels and gems had to be borrowed, but ultimately a signet ring, a scepter and crowns were produced. Costumes were made based on drawings of Napoleon's coronation. Congress met on the morning of the coronation, and then divided itself into two deputations to escort the emperor and the empress to the National Cathedral. In the cathedral, the emperor and the empress were to be seated on thrones next to the newly ennobled Mexican princes and princesses. Upon reaching the cathedral, the emperor and empress were escorted to their thrones, and the imperial regalia was placed on the altar. The regalia was blessed and Iturbide was crowned by the president of the congress. Reign Congress and the Emperor immediately began to clash, one of the first points of controversy being over the right of appointing members to a supreme court. All the while, work on a constitution for the Empire was being neglected. Iturbide's greatest enemy in congress was deputy Servando Teresa de Mier, a staunch republican, who would often ridicule the Emperor and his pageantry. In August 1822, a conspiracy to overthrow the Emperor was discovered. The conspirators, claiming that Iturbide's election was illegal, plotted to rise up in the capital, move the congress to Texcoco and declare the establishment of a Republic. On August 26 and 27, fifteen deputies suspected of being involved with the plot were arrested, including Mier. Congress was shocked by the arrests, which had included some of its most prominent deputies, and on the morning of August 27, the legislature sent a letter to the military upholding the immunity of congress, and accusing the arresting authorities of acting in an extra-legal fashion. Secretary of Interior Relations, Andr√©s Quintana Roo replied that by virtue of the Spanish Constitution of 1812, the government had the authority to arrest deputies suspected of being involved in a treasonous conspiracy, and that congress would remain informed on the results of the ongoing investigation. Congress preferred to try the suspected deputies itself, but the matter was rejected. The prosecution against the accused did not get very far and a few were liberated around Christmas, 1822. Afterwards followed controversies over reconstituting Congress. On October 17, 1822, Iturbide with his council of state and several sympathetic deputies, produced a proposal to reduce the number of deputies to seventy. Congress rejected the measure, but a compromise was reached by which the legislature agreed to abide by the Spanish Constitution of 1812 as a provisional constitution, allowing Iturbide a veto over legislation, and the right to select members of the supreme court. Iturbide however then sought for more concessions, arguing that his veto ought to extend to any article of any new constitution that congress would draft, and also continued to insist on reducing the number of deputies in congress. These grabs for power alienated even conservatives, and Iturbide's proposals were rejected, which Iturbide then responded to by dissolving congress using the military on October 31, 1822. To replace congress, Iturbide established a junta of forty five members, chosen from among friendly deputies. The junta was installed officially on November 2, 1822, and vested with the legislative power, until a new congress could be formed. Iturbide entrusted the body with writing up regulations for producing a new congress, but also began to focus on the grave financial issues that the Empire was facing. On November 5, 1822, the junta authorized a forced loan of over two million pesos, and the seizure of more than one million pesos waiting for exportation out of the country in the port of Veracruz. Iturbide also began to issue paper currency, and on December 20, the government authorized the printing of four million pesos worth of banknotes, in denominations of one, two, and ten. These were issued to all financial offices of the Empire, where they were to be used in a ratio of 1:2 with silver coin in payment of all government of obligations. Anyone who owed money to the government was allowed to make one third of the payment in notes and two thirds in coin. Revolt against the Emperor The last Spanish stronghold in Mexico, was Fort of San Juan de Ullua on a small island off the coast of Veracruz. There had been a change in command at the fort during this time, and general Santa Anna, stationed in Veracruz planned a scheme of taking possession of it by feigning the surrender of Veracruz to its new commander. When Echevarri, the captain-general of the local provinces, arrived in Veracruz, he approved of the plan, and agreed to join in on it, positioning his troops in Veracruz to ambush the landing Spaniards, having been promised support by Santa Anna. On October 26, 1822, as the Spaniards landed however, Santa Anna's troops failed to arrive, and Echevarri barely defeated the landing party, and the Spanish ultimately kept control of the fort. Echevarri expressed his suspicion to Iturbide that it had all been a scheme by Santa Anna to get Echeverri killed as revenge for Santa Anna not having been appointed Captain-General himself. Iturbide himself went to Veracruz to dismiss Santa Anna from his command, not overtly however but rather under the pretext of simply moving him to a different post in Mexico City. However, Santa Anna suspecting his ruin, instead took command of his troops and in December, 1822 started a rebellion in favor of a republican form of government. Vicente Guerrero and Nicolas Bravo, defected from the ranks of the imperialists, and proceeded to Chilapa on January 5, 1823 to join the revolution, but experienced a disastrous defeat at Almolonga. The insurrection was mostly being suppressed at this time, Victoria being held in check at Puente del Rey, and Santa Anna still confined at Veracruz. At this point however, opposition to the government began to negotiate with the military. Echevarri was sent to take care of the rebellion in Veracruz, but ended up defecting. On February 1, 1823 a junta of military chiefs met to proclaim the Plan of Casa Mata. The army pledged itself to restore Congress while disavowing any intention of harming the person of the Emperor, or of overthrowing the Mexican monarchy. On February 14, Puebla proclaimed for the plan, followed by San Luis Potos√≠, and Guadalajara. By March, most of Mexico had proclaimed in favor of the plan. A military junta was formed in Jalapa, to represent the Plan of Casa Mata. Iturbide's abdication On March 4, 1823, Iturbide issued a decree reconvening Congress, and the deputies met on March 7. Iturbide addressed the session, hoping to reach a negotiation and avoid conflict, but the deputies listened coldly. The military junta refused to recognize the Congress until its liberty was guaranteed. On March 19, Iturbide fearing his imminent overthrowal, summoned congress to an extraordinary session and presented his abdication. Congress proposed that the military junta meet with Iturbide about the matter, but the junta refused, instead proposing that Iturbide remove himself from the capital, and await the decision of Congress. On March 26, an agreement was reached by which the junta would recognized Iturbide on whatever terms Congress would grant him. Iturbide also agreed to remove himself from the capital, and the command of the capital was handed over to the revolutionary troops and power passed over to the Provisional Government of Mexico. Territory thumbright250pxProvinces of the Empire. The territory of the Mexican Empire corresponded to the borders of Viceroyalty of New Spain, excluding the Captaincies General of Cuba, Santo Domingo and the Philippines. The Central American lands of the former Captaincy General of Guatemala were annexed to the Empire shortly after its establishment. Under the First Empire, Mexico reached its greatest territorial extent, stretching from northern California to the provinces of Central America (excluding Panama, which was then part of Colombia), which had not initially approved becoming part of the Mexican Empire but joined the Empire shortly after their independence. After the emperor abdicated, on March 29 the departing Mexican general Vicente Filisola called for a new Central American Congress to convene and on July 1, 1823 the Central American provinces formed the Federal Republic of Central America, with only the province of Chiapas choosing to remain a part of Mexico as a state. Subsequent territorial evolution of Mexico over the next several decades (principally cessions to the United States) would eventually reduce Mexico to less than half its maximum extent. =Political subdivisions= The first Mexican empire was divided into the following intendances: * Las Californias * M√©xico * Nuevo M√©xico * Texas * Nueva Vizcaya * Coahuila * Nuevo Reino de Le√≥n * Nuevo Santander * Estado de Occidente * Zacatecas * San Luis de Potos√≠ * Guanajuato * Quer√©taro * Puebla * Guadalajara * Oaxaca * M√©rida de Yucat√°n * Valladolid * Veracruz * Guatemala * Honduras * El Salvador * Nicaragua * Costa Rica See also *Federal Republic of Central America *History of Mexico *Imperial Crown of Mexico *List of Emperors of Mexico *Mexican Imperial Orders *Second Mexican Empire References Further reading * Anna, Timothy.

Napoleon III of France wanted to establish a monarchist ally in the Americas as a restraint upon the growing power of the United States. Chosen as the Mexican emperor was Austrian Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian, of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine. His wife and empress of Mexico was Belgian princess, Charlotte of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Mexican conservatives had played a role in instigating the birth of the Empire, adding an element of civil war to the French Intervention, but the imperialists were never able to gain full control of the nation, and supporters of the Mexican Republic continued to wage war against the Empire. During his short reign, Maximilian's liberal ideals alienated him from his conservative supporters, but he gained limited support from moderate liberals, and attempted to pass sweeping reforms for the nation. The United States refused to recognize the Empire, and after the end of its own civil war in 1865, began to provide support to Mexican republican forces. French troops began to withdraw in 1866, after considering the war to be unwinnable, and the Empire came to an end on 19 June 1867 when Maximilian was executed by the government of the restored Mexican republic, along with his two leading Mexican generals, Mej√≠a and Miram√≥n. History =Mexican Monarchism= Mexican monarchism emerged in conjunction with the struggle for independence. After Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Spain, the initial independence movements throughout Latin America concerned themselves with supporting the deposed Ferdinand VII as the legitimate king as opposed to Joseph Bonaparte who had been established as king of Spain by Napoleon. During the Grito de Dolores, Miguel Hidalgo Costilla rallied his listeners to support Ferdinand VII against the New Spanish ruling classes that were allegedly going to betray Mexico and Catholicism over to the French. While his insurrection was unsuccessful the ultimately triumphant movement for Mexican independence was led by Agustin de Iturbide with his Plan of Iguala, which made specific provision for a European monarch to be placed on the Mexican throne. After the offer was refused Iturbide himself assumed the throne in a barracks revolt, which was nonetheless confirmed by the Mexican congress. Iturbide in his attempts to govern became increasingly autocratic, losing support of congress, and shutting the legislature down, eventually leading to the fall of the Empire, and discrediting monarchy even amongst conservatives, but the idea did not go away. French observers began expressing interest in the idea of a Mexican monarchy as early as 1830. Lorenzo de Zavala claimed that in that year, he was approached by a foreign agent hoping to recruit him in a plan to place an Orl√©ans monarch upon a Mexican throne. In 1838, Jose Maria Gutierrez Estrada wrote a monarchist essay endorsing the idea of a legitimate European monarch being invited to govern Mexico. The pamphlet was addressed to the conservative president Bustamante, who rejected the idea. French diplomats tended to sympathize with the Conservatives in Mexico, Victor de Broglie opining that monarchy was a form of government more suited to Mexico at the time and Fran√ßois Guizot giving a positive review of Estrada's pamphlet. A monarchist faction in 1846 promoted the idea of establishing a foreign prince at the head of the Mexican government, and president Paredes was viewed as being sympathetic to monarchism, but the project was not pursued due to the more pressing matter of the American invasion of Mexico. The candidate being proposed at the time was the Spanish prince, Don Enrique. =Role of France= Jos√© Hidalgo, Antonio Escand√≥n, √Ångel Dom√≠nguez, Antonio Peredo, Adrian Woll, Jose Maria de Landa. Front Row: Ignacio Marocho, Jos√© Mar√≠a Guti√©rrez de Estrada, Francisco Morfi, Joaqu√≠n de Le√≥n. Heavily influenced by his wife Empress Eugenie, who was in contact with the aforementioned Estrada and his fellow Mexican monarchist Jos√© Hidalgo, Napoleon III became intent on reviving the Mexican monarchy. Prior to 1861 any interference in the affairs of Mexico by European powers would have been viewed in the U.S as a challenge to the Monroe Doctrine. In 1861 however, the U.S. was embroiled in its own conflict, the American Civil War, which made the U.S. government powerless to intervene. When on July, 1861 Mexican President Benito Juarez declared a two-year moratorium on Mexican debt to France among other nations, Napoleon finally had a pretext. Encouraged by Empress Eugenie, who saw herself as the champion of the Catholic Church in Mexico, Napoleon III took advantage of the situation. The Offering of the Mexican Crown by a Mexican delegation, Miramare Castle, 1863. Napoleon III saw the opportunity to make France the great modernizing influence in the Western Hemisphere, as well as enabling the country to capture the South American markets. To give him further encouragement, there was his half brother, the duc de Morny, who was the largest holder of Mexican bonds. French troops landed in December, 1861, and began military operations on April, 1862. They were eventually joined by conservative Mexican generals who had never been entirely defeated in the War of Reform. After Charles de Lorencez's small expeditionary force was repulsed at the Battle of Puebla, reinforcements were sent and placed under the command of √âlie Forey. The capital was taken by June, 1863 and the French now sought to establish a friendly Mexican government. Forey appointed a committee of thirty five Mexicans, the Junta Superior who then elected three Mexican citizens to serve as the government's executive: Juan Nepucemo Almonte, Jos√© Mariano Salas, and Pelagio Antonio de Labastida. In turn this triumvirate then selected two hundred fifteen Mexican citizens to form together with the Junta Superior, an Assembly of Notables. The Assembly met on July, 1863 and resolved to invite Ferdinand Maximilian to be Emperor of Mexico. The executive triumvirate was formally changed into the Regency of the Mexican Empire. An official delegation left Mexico and arrived in Europe on October. Maximilian formally accepted the crown on 10 April 1864, and set sail for Mexico, arriving in Veracruz on 28 May and reaching the capital on 12 June. =Maximilian's Reign= On his arrival in the summer of 1864 Maximilian declared a political amnesty for all liberals who wished to join the Empire, and his conciliation efforts eventually won over moderate liberals such as Jos√© Fernando Ram√≠rez, Jos√© Mar√≠a Lacunza, Manuel Orozco y Berra, and Santiago Vidaurri. His first priorities included reforming his ministries and reforming the Imperial Mexican Army, the latter of which was impeded upon by Bazaine in an effort to consolidate French control of the nation. On August, Maximilian took a state trip through the nation while Carlota reigned as regent, going to Queretaro, Guanajuato, and Michoacan, giving public audiences and visiting officials, even celebrating Mexican independence by commemorating the Cry of Dolores, in the actual town where it took place. In December a Papal Nuncio arrived in order to arrange a concordat with the Empire to revise the Reform laws previously passed by the Mexican government that had nationalized Catholic Church property. Maximilian wished to maintain Catholicism as the state religion, and yet preferred to keep the reform laws intact, and also introduce religious toleration, measures which disillusioned his conservative and clerical supporters. =Military Hostilities= In April 1865, the U.S. Civil War ended, and while the American government was reluctant at the time to enter upon a conflict with France to enforce the Monroe Doctrine, official American sympathy remained with the deposed Mexican president Benito Ju√°rez. The U.S. government refused to recognize the Empire and also ignored Maximilian's correspondence. In December, a thirty million dollar private American loan was approved for Juarez, and American volunteers kept joining the Mexican republican troops. An unofficial American raid occurred near Brownsville, and Juarez's minister to the United States, Mat√≠as Romero, proposed that General Grant or General Sherman intervene in Mexico to help the liberals. The United States refrained from direct military intervention, but put diplomatic pressure on France to leave Mexico. A concentration of French troops in the northern republican strongholds of Mexico only led to a surge of republican guerilla activity in the south. While French troops controlled major cities, guerillas continued to be a major military threat in the countryside. In an effort to combat the increasing violence and in a belief that Juarez was outside of the nation already, Maximilian in October signed a decree authorizing the court martial and execution of anyone found either aiding or participating with the guerillas. The harsh measure was hardly unprecedented in Mexican history even resembling an 1862 measure by Juarez, but it proved to be widely reviled, being branded the Black Decree, and contributing to the growing unpopularity of the Empire. =Fall of the Empire= Photograph of the Execution of Maximilian I of Mexico, and Generals Miram√≥n and Mej√≠a. Left to right: Mej√≠a, ‚Üí Miram√≥n, and ‚Üí Maximilian. In January 1866, seeing the war as unwinnable Napoleon declared to the French Chambers that he intended to withdraw the French military from Mexico. Maximilian's request for more aid or at least a delay in troop withdrawals was denied. Carlota arrived in Europe in an attempt to plead for the Empire's cause, but was unable to gain more support. The failure of her mission apparently caused her to go insane, and she would spend the rest of her life in Belgium, living until 1927. In October Maximilian moved his cabinet to Orizaba and was widely rumored to be leaving the nation. He contemplated abdication, and on 25 November held a council of his ministers to address the crisis faced by the Empire. They narrowly voted against abdication and Maximilian headed back towards the capital. He intended to appeal to the nation in order to hold a national assembly which would then decide what form of government the Mexican nation was to take. Such a measure however would require a ceasefire from Juarez who had no intention of conceding to someone whom he viewed as a usurper. As the national assembly project fell through Maximilian decided to focus on military operations and in February as the last of the French troops were leaving, the Emperor headed for the city of Queretaro to join the bulk of his Mexican troops, numbering about 10,000 men. The liberal generals Escobedo and Corona converged on Queretaro with 40,000 men and yet the city held out until being betrayed by an imperial officer who opened the gates to the liberals on 15 May. Maximilian was captured and placed on trial with his leading generals Mej√≠a and Miramon. All three were sentenced to death and executed on 19 June. Government The Mexican imperial crown and scepter as funerary insignia. Wood, gilded, pearl and stone imitation. around 1867, Imperial Furniture Depot, Vienna. A provisional constitution was issued in 1865. The emperor was to govern through nine ministries: of the Imperial Household, of State, of Foreign Relations, of War, of Government or Interior, of the Treasury, of Justice, of Public Instruction and Worship, and of Development. A council of state was given the power to frame bills and give advice to the emperor, and a separate private cabinet, serving as the emperor's liaison, was divided into civil and military affairs. Empress Carlota was given the right to serve as regent if under certain circumstances Maximilian was to be unavailable. During his short reign, Maximilian issued eight volumes of laws covering all aspects of government, including forest management, railroads, roads, canals, postal services, telegraphs, mining, and immigration. The emperor passed legislation guaranteeing equality before the law and freedom of speech, and laws meant to defend the rights of laborers, especially that of the Indians. Labor laws in Yucat√°n actually became harsher on workers after the fall of the Empire. A national system of free schools was also planned based on the German gymnasia and the emperor founded an academy of sciences and literature. Laws were published both in Spanish and in Nahuatl, the Aztec language, and Maximilian appointed leading Nahuatl scholar Faustino Galicia as an advisor to his government. Economy =Railways= Mexican Railway, Bridge by Jos√© Mar√≠a Velasco G√≥mez 1877. One of the main challenges encountered by the Emperor was the lack of sufficient infrastructure to link the different parts of the realm. The main goal was connecting the port of Veracruz and the capital in Mexico City. In 1857, Don Antonio Escand√≥n secured the right to build a line from the port of Veracruz to Mexico City and on to the Pacific Ocean. Revolution and political instability stifled progress on the financing or construction of the line until 1864, when, under the regime of Emperor Maximilian, the Imperial Mexican Railway Company began construction of the line. Political upheaval continued to stifle progress, and the initial segment from Veracruz to Mexico City was inaugurated nine years later on 1 January 1873 by President Sebasti√°n Lerdo de Tejada. In 1857 the original proprietors of the government concession, the Masso Brothers, inaugurated on 4 July the train service from Tlatelolco, in M√©xico City, to the nearby town of Guadalupe Hidalgo.Ferrocarril de M√©xico a La Villa Eventually they ran out of funds and decided to sell it to Manuel Escand√≥n and Antonio Escand√≥n.La historia del tren en M√©xico The Escand√≥n Brothers continued working and the project, and Antonio Escand√≥n visited the United States and England in the last months of the year. In the first country, he hired Andrew Talcott, and in the latter, he sold company stock. Exploration of a route from Orizaba to Maltrata was performed by engineers Andrew H. Talcott and Pascual Almaz√°n. During the French intervention, part of the railways were destroyed. The only option available was the establishment of a pact between the French Army, and the two companies of the Escand√≥n Brothers. The French Army was to provide a subsidy to the companies of 120 000 francs a month for the works, and the companies were to establish service from Veracruz to Soledad para by May, actually concluding on 15 August 1862, concluding 41 kilometres of tracks. Next they reached the Camar√≥n station, with a length of 62 kilometres. By 16 October 1864 they reached Paso del Macho with a length of 76 kilometres.Chapman, John Gresham, La construcci√≥n del Ferrocarril Mexicano, 1985 On 19 September 1864, the Imperial Mexican Railway Company (Compa√±√≠a Limitada del Ferrocarril Imperial Mexicano) was Incorporated in London to complete the earlier projects and continued construction on this line. Escand√≥n ceded his privileges to the new company. Smith, Knight and Co. was later contracted in 1864 by the Imperial Mexican Railway to continue work on the line from Mexico City to Veracruz.The Railroads of Mexico William Elliot was employed as Chief Assistant for three years on the construction of about 70 miles of the heaviest portion of the Mexican Railway, after which he returned to England. He had several years of experience building railways in England, India, and Brazil. In this last country, he held the position of Engineer-in-Chief of the Province of S√£o Paulo.William Elliot (1827-1892) Grace's Guide to British Industrial History Maximiliano I hired engineer M Lyons for the construction of the line from La Soledad to Monte del Chiquihuite, later on joining the line from Veracruz to Paso del Macho.Historia del Ferrocarril Works were begun in Maltrata, at the same time that the works from Veracruz and Mexico City kept moving forward. By the end of the Empire in June 1867, 76 kilometers from Veracruz to Paso del Macho were functional (part of the concession to Lyons) and the line from Mexico City reached Apizaco with 139 km.:es:Ferrosur =Banking= Maximillian planned the monument to Christopher Columbus for the grand boulevard, now called Paseo de la Reforma. It was built during the regime of Porfirio D√≠az. Before 1864, there was no banking in Mexico. Credits were obtained from religious orders and merchant guilds. During the French Intervention, the branch of a British bank was opened. The London Bank of Mexico and South America Ltd began operations with a capital of two and a half million pesos. It belonged to the Baring Brothers Group, and had its head office in the corner of the Capuchinas and Lerdo Streets in Downtown Mexico City.Banco de Londres, M√©xico y Sudam√©rica, el primer banco comercial de M√©xico Forbes =Foreign Trade= At the beginning of the American Civil War, the city of Matamoros was simply a sleepy little border town across the Rio Grande from Brownsville. It had, for several years, been considered a port, but it had relatively few ships arriving. Previous to the war, accounts mention that not over six ships entered the port each year. Nevertheless, in about four years, Matamoros, due to its proximity to Texas, was to assume state as a port, and multiply its inhabitants in number. Following is a quote from a Union General in 1885 describing the importance of the port in Matamoros: The cotton trade brought together in Bagdad, Tamaulipas and Matamoros over 20,000 speculators from the Union and the Confederacy, England, France, and Germany. Bagdad had grown from a small, seashore town to a \\"full-pledge town.\\" The English-speaking population in the area by 1864 was so great that Matamoros even had a newspaper printed in English‚Äîit was called the Matamoros Morning Call. In addition, the port exported cotton to England and France, where millions of people needed it for their daily livelihood, and it was possible to receive fifty cents per pound in gold for cotton, when it cost about three cents in the Confederacy, \\"and much more money was received for it laid down in New York and European ports.\\" Other sources mention that the port of Matamoros traded with London, Havana, Belize, and New Orleans. The Matamoros and New York City trade agreement, however, continued throughout the war and until 1864, and it was considered \\"heavy and profitable.\\" By 1865, Matamoros was described as a prosperous town of 30,000 people, and Lew Wallace informed General Ulysses S. Grant that neither Baltimore or New Orleans could compare itself to the growing commercial activity of Matamoros. Nevertheless, after the collapse of the Confederacy, \\"gloom, despondency, and despair\\" became evident in Matamoros‚Äîmarkets shut down, business almost ceased to exist, and ships were rarely seen. \\"For Sale\\" signs began to sprout up everywhere, and Matamoros returned to its role of a sleepy little border town across the Rio Grande. The conclusion of the American Civil War brought a severe crisis to the now abandoned Port of Bagdad, a crisis that until this day the port has never recovered from. In addition, a tremendous hurricane in 1889 destroyed the desolated port. This same hurricane was one of the many hurricanes during the period of devastating hurricanes of 1870 to 1889, which reduced the population of Matamoros to nearly half its size, mounting with it another upsetting economic downturn. Territorial division Departments of the Second Mexican Empire. Maximilian I wanted to reorganize the territory following scientific criteria, instead of following historical ties, traditional allegiances and the interests of local groups. The task of designing this new division was given to Manuel Orozco y Berra. This task was realized according to the following criteria: * The territory should be divided in at least fifty departments, * Whenever possible, natural boundaries shall be preferred, * For the territorial extension of each department, the configuration of the terrain, climate and elements of production were taken into consideration so that in due time, they could have a roughly equal number of inhabitants.Rub√©n Garc√≠a, \\"Biograf√≠a, bibliograf√≠a e iconograf√≠a de don Manuel Orozco y Berra\\", en Bolet√≠n de la Sociedad Mexicana de Geograf√≠a y Estad√≠stica, M√©xico, Compa√±√≠a Editora e Impresora \\"La Afici√≥n\\", 1934, p. 233. On 13 March 1865, the new Law on the territorial division of the Mexican Empire was published.Diario del Imperio, Tomo I N√∫mero 59, 13 de marzo de 1865 The Empire was divided into 50 departments, though not every department was ever able to be administered due to the ongoing war. Immigration Maximilian intended to aid the development of the country by opening up the nation to immigration, regardless of racial origin. An immigration agency was set up to promote immigration from the United States, the Confederate States, Germany, and Asia. Colonists were to be granted citizenship at once, and gained exemption from taxes for the first year, and an exemption from military services for five years. Some of the most prominent colonization settlements were the Villa Carlota and the New Virginia Colony. Legacy Chapultepec Castle In spite of lasting in power only a few years, the results of Maximilian's construction projects survived him and remain prominent Mexico City landmarks in the present day. For his royal residence, Maximilian decided to renovate a former viceregal villa in Mexico City, which was also notable for being the site of a battle during the U.S. invasion of Mexico. The result would be Chapultepec Castle, the only castle in North America ever to be used by actual royalty. While formerly serving as the official home of Mexican presidents, today the site is a museum. In order to connect the palace to the government offices in Mexico city, Maximilian also built a prominent road which he called Paseo de la Emperatriz (The Empress' Promenade). After the fall of the Empire, the government renamed it Paseo de la Reforma (Promenade of the Reform) to commemorate President Juarez and the reforms that he helped to legislate. In the present, it continues to be one of the most prominent avenues of the capital and is lined with civic monuments. Today, the Second Mexican Empire is advocated by small far-right groups like the Nationalist Front of Mexico, whose followers believe the Empire to have been a legitimate attempt to deliver Mexico from the hegemony of the United States. They are reported to gather every year at Quer√©taro, the place where Maximilian and his generals were executed. In popular culture The 1970 film Two Mules for Sister Sara was set in Mexico during the years of the Second Mexican Empire. The two main characters, played by Clint Eastwood and Shirley MacLaine, aided a Mexican resistance force and ultimately led them to overpower a French garrison. The 1969 film The Undefeated starring John Wayne and Rock Hudson portrays events during the French Intervention in Mexico and was also loosely based on the escape of Confederate General Sterling Price to Mexico after the American Civil War and his attempt to join with Maximilian's forces. The 1965 film Major Dundee starring Charlton Heston and Richard Harris featured Union cavalry (supplemented by Galvanized Yankees) crossing into Mexico and fighting French forces towards the end of the American Civil War. The 1954 film Vera Cruz was also set in Mexico and has an appearance of Maximilian having a target shooting competition with Gary Cooper and Burt Lancaster's character at Chapultepec Castle. Maximilian was played by George Macready, who at 54 was twenty years older than the Emperor was in 1866. The 1939 film Juarez featured Paul Muni as Benito Ju√°rez, Bette Davis as Empress Carlota, and Brian Aherne as Emperor Maximilian. It was based, in part, on Bertita Harding's novel The Phantom Crown (1937). In the Southern Victory Series by Harry Turtledove, Maximilian's Empire survives the turmoil of the 1860s into the 20th century due to the Confederate States emerging victorious in its battle against the United States of America in the \\"War of Secession\\"; thus, the United States becomes too weak and unwilling to pressure Maximilian's puppet state to capitulate to rebels and dissolve. It fights alongside the Confederate States against the United States in 1881‚Äì1882, 1914-1917 and 1941-1944 and experiences a civil war during the interwar years between republicans and Habsburg royalists. In 1881, it sold its northern provinces of Sonora and Chihuahua to the Confederacy and in 1944, it lost its extraterritorial province of Baja California to the United States after the Second Great War. The 1990 novel The Difference Engine, co-authored by William Gibson and Bruce Stirling, is set in an alternate 1855 where the timeline diverged in 1824 with Charles Babbage's completion of the difference engine. One consequence is the occupation of Mexico by the Second French Empire with Napoleon III as the de facto emperor instead of the installation of Emperor Maxillian. In Mexican popular culture, there have been soap operas like \\"El Carruaje\\" (1967), plays, films, and historical novels such as Fernando del Paso's Noticias del Imperio (1987). Biographies, memoirs, and novels have been published since the 1860s, and among the most recent have been Prince Michael of Greece's The Empress of Farewells, available in various languages.

The voyage would be the first military action for master's mate Joshua Barney. There is some degree of discrepancy in dates concerning both the Hornet and the ship USS Wasp (1775), both of which fitted out in Baltimore. The biography of Joshua Barney claims that upon his return to Baltimore after a voyage aboard the ship Sydney (which he had taken command of after the death of her captain) he signed onto be first mate aboard the Hornet and was first tasked to recruit a crew. Part of the way he did this was by hoisting an \\"American Flag\\" provided from Philadelphia by Hopkins, indicating the ships were already accepted into the fleet. The Naval Documents of the American Revolution, volume 2, pg 583 place the date of this return as 23 October 1775. Barney claims that after fitting out, both the Hornet and the Wasp sailed in company to join the fleet at Philadelphia at the end of November. However, Colonial records show that on 2 December 1775, Col. Benjamin Harrison was dispatched to Baltimore to acquire 2-3 ships to be armed and augment Hopkin's fleet. These ships are identified as being the Hornet and the Wasp. Both vessels are noted by the Baltimore Committee as being fitting out as of 18 December 1775. Both the Hornet and the Wasp are noted as joining the fleet in Philadelphia on 13 February 1776. Given the dates from the Colonial sources come from the records of government bodies in the course of their work and that the dates from Mary Barney's account come from family papers and recollections, it is more likely that Barney's dates are in error and that the events in question happened according to the later timeline. Hence, it is probably safer to say that the Hornet along with the Wasp was acquired by the Colonial Congress via the efforts of Col. Harrison between the 2nd and 18th of December, fitted out between the date of acquisition along with the Wasp, and then were commissioned into the Colonial Navy on 13 February 1776 after joining the fleet in Philadelphia. Hornet then sailed with Hopkins fleet 18 February 1776. Outside the Virginia Capes, she ran afoul of USS Fly and was unable to accompany the fleet for the amphibious assault on New Providence. On 27 August 1776, Congress offer to purchase the Hornet from her owner, William Stone. She patrolled in the Delaware Bay for nearly a year, then ran the British blockade to convoy merchantmen to Charleston. Hornet was captured by HM schooner Porcupine 27 April 1777. According to records of the Vice Admiralty Court at Jamaica, Hornet was built in Bermuda, of 100 tons burden, mounted ten carriage guns and four swivels, and had a crew of thirty-five. She sailed from Philadelphia in January or February 1777 for Charleston in ballast, and at the latter place loaded twenty barrels of rice and twenty-six barrels of indigo for Martinique. The action with Porcupine, which lasted three-quarters of an hour, took place in latitude 22.5 deg north, and longitude 70 deg west [~75 nmi NNE of Cockburn Town], upwards of fifty shot being fired. Upon arrival in Jamaica the Hornet was leaky, and, after condemnation, was appraised at ¬£2443.12. .6, including cargo, stores and gunpowder.

Education and career Born on January 31, 1869, in Superior, Wisconsin, Lenroot attended the common schools, then attended Parsons Business College in Duluth, Minnesota and read law in 1897. He was a logger and reporter for the Douglas County, Wisconsin Superior Court from 1893 to 1906. He was admitted to the bar and entered private practice in Superior in 1898. He was a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly from 1901 to 1907, serving as Speaker from 1903 to 1907. Congressional service Lenroot was elected as a Republican from the 11th congressional district to the United States House of Representatives of the 61st United States Congress and to the four succeeding Congresses and served from March 4, 1909, until April 17, 1918, when he resigned, having been elected Senator. He was elected as a Republican to the United States Senate on April 2, 1918, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of United States Senator Paul O. Husting. He was reelected in 1920 and served from April 18, 1918, to March 3, 1927. He was an unsuccessful candidate for renomination in 1926. He was Chairman of the Committee on Railroads in the 66th United States Congress, Committee on Public Lands and Surveys in the 68th United States Congress and the Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds in the 69th United States Congress. He resumed the practice of law in Washington, D.C. from 1927 to 1929. 1920 Republican Convention Lenroot attended the 1920 Republican National Convention at the Chicago Coliseum, and after the selection of Harding as the nominee for President, party leaders decided that the progressive Lenroot would be a balance to a ticket with the more conservative Harding. By Saturday night, June 12, many of the delegates had gone home, along with most of the party bosses. After Lenroot's name had been placed in nomination and seconded but before a vote could be taken, an Oregon delegate, Wallace McCamant,politicalgraveyard.com nominated Coolidge for vice president.Sol Barzman, Madmen and Geniuses: The Vice-Presidents of the United States, pp198-199 (Follett Publishing, 1974) Unfettered by party bosses, the delegates weighed in for Coolidge, who received 674 votes to Lenroot's 146 and won on the first ballot.

Redundancy theory Gottlob Frege was probably the first philosopher or logician to note that predicating truth or existence does not express anything above and beyond the statement to which it is attributed. He remarked: > It is worthy of notice that the sentence \\"I smell the scent of violets\\" has > the same content as the sentence \\"it is true that I smell the scent of > violets\\". So it seems, then, that nothing is added to the thought by my > ascribing to it the property of truth. (Frege, G., 1918. \\"Thought\\", in his > Logical Investigations, Oxford: Blackwell, 1977)Truth ‚Äì Internet > Encyclopedia of Philosophy; The Deflationary Theory of Truth (Stanford > Encyclopedia of Philosophy). Nevertheless, the first serious attempt at the formulation of a theory of truth which attempted to systematically define the truth predicate out of existence is attributable to F. P. Ramsey. Ramsey argued, against the prevailing currents of the times, that not only was it not necessary to construct a theory of truth on the foundation of a prior theory of meaning (or mental content) but that once a theory of content had been successfully formulated, it would become obvious that there was no further need for a theory of truth, since the truth predicate would be demonstrated to be redundant. Hence, his particular version of deflationism is commonly referred to as the redundancy theory. Ramsey noted that in ordinary contexts in which we attribute truth to a proposition directly, as in \\"It is true that Caesar was murdered\\", the predicate \\"is true\\" does not seem to be doing any work. \\"It is true that Caesar was murdered\\" just means \\"Caesar was murdered\\" and \\"It is false that Caesar was murdered\\" just means that \\"Caesar was not murdered\\". Ramsey recognized that the simple elimination of the truth-predicate from all statements in which it is used in ordinary language was not the way to go about attempting to construct a comprehensive theory of truth. For example, take the sentence Everything that John says is true. This can be easily translated into the formal sentence with variables ranging over propositions For all P, if John says P, then P is true. But attempting to directly eliminate \\"is true\\" from this sentence, on the standard first-order interpretation of quantification in terms of objects, would result in the ungrammatical formulation For all P, if John says P, then P. It is ungrammatical because P must, in that case, be replaced by the name of an object and not a proposition. Ramsey's approach was to suggest that such sentences as \\"He is always right\\" could be expressed in terms of relations: \\"For all a, R and b, if he asserts aRb, then aRb\\". Ramsey also noticed that, although his paraphrasings and definitions could be easily rendered in logical symbolism, the more fundamental problem was that, in ordinary English, the elimination of the truth-predicate in a phrase such as Everything John says is true would result in something like \\"If John says something, then that\\". Ramsey attributed this to a defect in natural language, suggesting that such pro-sentences as \\"that\\" and \\"what\\" were being treated as if they were pronouns. This \\"gives rise to artificial problems as to the nature of truth, which disappear at once when they are expressed in logical symbolism...\\" According to Ramsey, it is only because natural languages lack, what he called, pro-sentences (expressions that stand in relation to sentences as pronouns stand to nouns) that the truth predicate cannot be defined away in all contexts. A. J. Ayer took Ramsey's idea one step further by declaring that the redundancy of the truth predicate implies that there is no such property as truth. > There are sentences...in which the word \\"truth\\" seems to stand for something > real; and this leads the speculative philosopher to enquire what this > \\"something\\" is. Naturally he fails to obtain a satisfactory answer, since > his question is illegitimate. For our analysis has shown that the word > \\"truth\\" does not stand for anything, in the way which such a question > requires. This extreme version of deflationism has often been called the disappearance theory or the no truth theory of truth and it is easy to understand why, since Ayer seems here to be claiming both that the predicate \\"is true\\" is redundant (and therefore unnecessary) and also that there is no such property as truth to speak of. Performative theory Peter Strawson formulated a performative theory of truth in the 1950s. Like Ramsey, Strawson believed that there was no separate problem of truth apart from determining the semantic contents (or facts of the world) which give the words and sentences of language the meanings that they have. Once the questions of meaning and reference are resolved, there is no further question of truth. Strawson's view differs from Ramsey's, however, in that Strawson maintains that there is an important role for the expression \\"is true\\": specifically, it has a performative role similar to \\"I promise to clean the house\\". In asserting that p is true, we not only assert that p but also perform the \\"speech act\\" of confirming the truth of a statement in a context. We signal our agreement or approbation of a previously uttered assertion or confirm some commonly held belief or imply that what we are asserting is likely to be accepted by others in the same context. Tarski and deflationary theories Some years before Strawson developed his account of the sentences which include the truth-predicate as performative utterances, Alfred Tarski had developed his so-called semantic theory of truth. Tarski's basic goal was to provide a rigorously logical definition of the expression \\"true sentence\\" within a specific formal language and to clarify the fundamental conditions of material adequacy that would have to be met by any definition of the truth-predicate. If all such conditions were met, then it would be possible to avoid semantic paradoxes such as the liar paradox (i.e., \\"This sentence is false.\\") Tarski's material adequacy condition, or Convention T, is: a definition of truth for an object language implies all instances of the sentential form :(T) S is true if and only if P where S is replaced by a name of a sentence (in the object language) and P is replaced by a translation of that sentence in the metalanguage. So, for example, \\"La neve √® bianca is true if and only if snow is white\\" is a sentence which conforms to Convention T; the object language is Italian and the metalanguage is English. The predicate \\"true\\" does not appear in the object language, so no sentence of the object language can directly or indirectly assert truth or falsity of itself. Tarski thus formulated a two-tiered scheme that avoids semantic paradoxes such as Russell's paradox. Tarski formulated his definition of truth indirectly through a recursive definition of the satisfaction of sentential functions and then by defining truth in terms of satisfaction. An example of a sentential function is \\"x defeated y in the 2004 US presidential elections\\"; this function is said to be satisfied when we replace the variables x and y with the names of objects such that they stand in the relation denoted by \\"defeated in the 2004 US presidential elections\\" (in the case just mentioned, replacing x with \\"George W. Bush\\" and y with \\"John Kerry\\" would satisfy the function, resulting in a true sentence). In general, a1, ..., an satisfy an n-ary predicate œÜ(x1. ..., xn) if, and only if substitution of the names \\"a1\\", ..., \\"an\\" for the variables of œÜ in the relevant order yields \\"œÜ(a1, ..., an)\\", and œÜ(a1, ..., an). Given a method for establishing the satisfaction (or not) of every atomic sentence of the form A(..., xk, ...), the usual rules for truth- functional connectives and quantifiers yield a definition for the satisfaction condition of all sentences of the object language. For instance, for any two sentences A, B, the sentence A & B is satisfied if and only if A and B are satisfied (where '&' stands for conjunction), for any sentence A, ~A is satisfied if and only if A fails to be satisfied, and for any open sentence A where x is free in A, (x)A is satisfied if and only if for every substitution of an item of the domain for x yielding A*, A* is satisfied. Whether any complex sentence is satisfied is seen to be determined by its structure. An interpretation is an assignment of denotation to all of the non-logical terms of the object language. A sentence A is true (under an interpretation I) if and only if it is satisfied in I. Tarski thought of his theory as a species of correspondence theory of truth, not a deflationary theory. Disquotationalism On the basis of Tarski's semantic conception, W. V. O. Quine developed what eventually came to be called the disquotational theory of truth or disquotationalism. Quine interpreted Tarski's theory as essentially deflationary. He accepted Tarski's treatment of sentences as the only truth- bearers. Consequently, Quine suggested that the truth-predicate could only be applied to sentences within individual languages. The basic principle of disquotationalism is that an attribution of truth to a sentence undoes the effects of the quotation marks that have been used to form sentences. Instead of (T) above then, Quine's reformulation would be something like the following \\"Disquotation Schema\\": :(DS) Sentence \\"S\\" is true if and only if S. Disquotationalists are able to explain the existence and usefulness of the truth predicate in such contexts of generalization as \\"John believes everything that Mary says\\" by asserting, with Quine, that we cannot dispense with the truth predicate in these contexts because the convenient expression of such generalization is precisely the role of the truth predicate in language. In the case of \\"John believes everything that Mary says\\", if we try to capture the content of John's beliefs, we would need to form an infinite conjunction such as the following: :If Mary says that lemons are yellow, then lemons are yellow, and if Mary says that lemons are green, then lemons are green, and... The disquotation schema (DS), allows us to reformulate this as: :If Mary says that lemons are yellow, then the sentence \\"lemons are yellow\\" is true, and if Mary says that lemons are green, then the sentence \\"lemons are green\\" is true, and... Since x is equivalent to \\"x\\" is true, for the disquotationalist, then the above infinite conjunctions are also equivalent. Consequently, we can form the generalization: :For all sentences \\"S\\", if Mary said S, then \\"S\\" is true. Since we could not express this statement without a truth-predicate along the lines of those defined by deflationary theories, it is the role of the truth predicate in forming such generalizations that characterizes all that needs to be characterized about the concept of truth. Prosententialism Grover, Camp and Belnap developed a deflationary theory of truth called prosententialism, which has since been defended by Robert Brandom. Prosententialism asserts that there are prosentences which stand in for and derive their meanings from the sentences which they substitute. In the statement: :Bill is tired and he is hungry. the pronoun \\"he\\" takes its reference from the noun \\"Bill.\\" By analogy, in the statement: :He explained that he was in financial straits, said that this is how things were, and that therefore he needed an advance. the clause \\"this is how things were\\" receives its reference from the previously occurring sentential clause \\"he was in financial straits\\", according to a prosententialist account. How does this relate to truth? Prosententialists view the statements that contain \\"is true\\" as sentences which do not contain a truth-predicate but rather contain some form of prosentence; the truth-predicate itself is part of an anaphoric or prosentential construction. Prosententialists point out the many parallels which exist between pronouns and prosentences. Pronouns are often used out of \\"laziness\\", as in: :Bill is tired and he is hungry or they can be used in quantificational contexts, such as: :Someone is in the room and he is armed with a rifle. In a similar manner, \\"it is true\\" can be used as a prosentence of laziness, as in: :Fred believes that it is raining and it is true. and as a quantificational prosentence, such as: :Whatever Alice believes is true. Prosententialists therefore reject the idea that truth is a property of some sort. Minimalism Paul Horwich's minimal theory of truth, also known as minimalism, takes the primary truth-bearing entities to be propositions, rather than sentences. According to the minimalist view then, truth is indeed a property of propositions (or sentences, as the case may be) but it is so minimal and anomalous a property that it cannot be said to provide us with any useful information about or insight into the nature of truth. It is fundamentally nothing more than a sort of metalinguistic property. Another way of formulating the minimalist thesis is to assert that the conjunction of all of the instances of the following schema: :The proposition that P is true if and only if P. provides an implicit definition of the property of truth. Each such instance is an axiom of the theory and there are an infinite number of such instances (one for every actual or possible proposition in the universe). Our concept of truth consists of nothing more than a disposition to assent to all of the instances of the above schema when we encounter them. Objections to deflationism One of the main objections to deflationary theories of all flavors was formulated by Jackson, Oppy and Smith in 1994 (following Kirkham 1992). According to the objection, if deflationism is interpreted as a sentential theory (that is, one where truth is predicated of sentences on the left hand side of the biconditionals such as (T) above), then deflationism is false; on the other hand, if it is interpreted as a propositional theory, then it is trivial. Examining another simple instance of the standard equivalence schema: :Grass is green is true if and only if grass is green. the objection is just that, if the italicized words are taken as a sentence, then it is false, because something more is required for the whole statement to be true than merely the fact that \\"grass is green\\" is true. It is also necessary that the sentence \\"grass is green\\" means that grass is green and this further linguistic fact is not dealt with in the equivalence schema. However, if we now assume that grass is green on the left-hand side refers to a proposition, then the theory seems trivial since grass is green is defined as true if and only if grass is green. Note that the triviality involved here is not caused by the concept of truth but by that of proposition. In any case, simply accepting the triviality of the propositional version implies that, at least within the Deflationary Theory of Truth, there can be no explanation of the connection between sentences and the things that they express; i.e., propositions. =Normativity of assertions= Michael Dummett, among others, has argued that deflationism cannot account for the fact that truth should be a normative goal of assertion. The idea is that truth plays a central role in the activity of stating facts. The deflationist response is that the assertion that truth is a norm of assertion can be stated only in the form of the following infinite conjunction: > One should assert the proposition that grass is green only if grass is green > and one should assert the proposition that lemons are yellow only if lemons > are yellow and one should assert the proposition that a square circle is > impossible only if a squared circle is impossible and... This, in turn, can be reformulated as: :For all propositions P, speakers should assert the propositions that P only if the proposition that P is true. It may be the case that we use the truth-predicate to express this norm, not because it has anything to do with the nature of truth in some inflationary sense, but because it is a convenient way of expressing this otherwise inexpressible generalization.

In March 2015, Phillips was appointed as the President of the Partnership Council of the John Lewis Partnership for a three-year term. His is the first external appointment since 1928. Phillips is deputy chairman of the board of the National Equality Standard, and other business appointments include chairman of Green Park Diversity Analytics, director of WebberPhillips, a data analytics provider; and director of Pepper Productions, an independent television production company. He is a member of the board of the Barbican Arts Centre and the Council of Aldeburgh Music; and a trustee of the Social Mobility Foundation, among other charities. Phillips is a former chairman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) and a former television presenter and executive. Phillips became head of the Commission for Racial Equality in 2003, and on its abolition in 2006 was appointed full-time chairman of its successor, the EHRC (initially called the Commission for Equality and Human Rights), which had a broader remit of combating discrimination and promoting equality across other grounds (age, disability, gender, race, religion and belief, sexual orientation and gender reassignment).Dodd, Vikram (4 September 2006). \\"Ministers pick Phillips to lead new human rights and equalities body\\", The Guardian. Retrieved 29 April 2020. The EHRC also had the role of promoting and defending human rights, and secured recognition as the national human rights institution for England and Wales (alongside separate commissions in Northern Ireland and Scotland). Phillips' tenure as EHRC chairman (which at his request became a part-time position in 2009) has at times been controversial. Early life Mark Trevor Phillips was born in Islington, London, the youngest of ten children. His parents emigrated from then British Guiana in 1950. He spent his childhood partly in British Guiana, and partly in Wood Green, north London; he attended Wood Green County Grammar School (became Wood Green Comprehensive in 1967) on White Hart Lane, but took his A-levels at Queen's College in Georgetown, Guyana. He returned to London to study for a BSc in Chemistry at Imperial College London. Broadcasting and writing Phillips worked initially as a researcher for London Weekend Television (LWT), before being promoted to head of current affairs in 1992, remaining in the post until 1994. He produced and presented The London Programme for LWT and has worked on projects for the BBC and Channel 4. With his brother, the crime writer Mike Phillips, he wrote Windrush: The Irresistible Rise of Multi-racial Britain (1998, HarperCollins, ). He has won three Royal Television Society Awards, including Documentary Series of the Year for Windrush in 1999. He is a Vice President of the RTS. In March 2015, Channel 4 aired Things We Won't Say About Race (That Are True), a feature-length documentary written and presented by Phillips and co-produced by Pepper Productions and Outline Productions. Philips was invited to analyse and interpret the survey for the documentary What British Muslims Really Think aired April 2016, which followed similar themes to Things We Won't Say About Race (That Are True) relating to exploring racial truths through statistics. Political activity As a student at Imperial he became president of its students' union. In 1978 he was elected president of the National Union of Students as a candidate for the Broad Left. Phillips was active in the voluntary sector, serving as chairman of the Runnymede Trust, a think-tank promoting ethnic equality, from 1993 to 1998, and as a commissioner for a number of other charities. He also served as chairman of the London Arts Board. His long-standing friendship with Peter Mandelson (who worked with Phillips at LWT and was best man at his first wedding) brought him close to the New Labour project and he became friendly with Tony Blair. Phillips joined the Labour Party in London in 1996. He was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1999 New Year Honours list for services to broadcast journalism. Later in 1999, Phillips ran to be Labour's candidate for Mayor of London. Phillips was initially reported to be Blair's preferred choice for the role, and when Blair called for the party to swiftly unite behind one candidate, Ken Livingstone, a left-winger and favourite to win the nomination, offered to form a joint ticket with Phillips as his running mate. Phillips described Livingstone's offer as \\"patronising\\" in a response that was seen as an accusation of racism, though Phillips later denied this.Phillips accuses Livingstone of racism, BBC News, 16 June 1999; Minnette Marrin, Playing the race card , The Sunday Telegraph], 20 June 1999. Following this and other controversies, including his decision to send his children to a private school, Phillips withdrew from the race a few months later and was not on the final shortlist of candidates. Instead, he accepted an offer to be running mate to Frank Dobson. Although Dobson won the nomination, his candidature was harmed by the perception that the contest was \\"fixed\\" by the use of an electoral college.Robert Shrimsley, \\"How Blair put the block on Red Ken\\", The Daily Telegraph, 21 February 2000 Livingstone ran as an independent and won. The Labour Party designated Phillips as a member of the London Assembly on 4 May 2000 as one of its 'top-up' candidates. Phillips served as chairman of the Assembly until February 2003, before resigning his seat to take up his appointment at the Commission for Racial Equality. In March 2020, Phillips was suspended from Labour following allegations of Islamophobia. Following the announcement, Phillips defended his comments about British Muslims on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The interview was mentioned in the analysis by former Tory party chair, Sayeeda Warsi. Critics of the move include a former MP familiar with similar accusations, Stephanie Phillips (no relation), published in her current newspaper, as well as an opinion piece at The New Arab. Multiculturalism: disagreements with Ken Livingstone Phillips and Livingstone had a frosty relationship throughout Phillips' time on the London Assembly, and Phillips' opposition to multiculturalism saw them clash time and again during his tenure at the CRE. In a Times interview in April 2004, Phillips called for the government to reject its support for multiculturalism, claiming it was out of date and legitimised \\"separateness\\" between communities, and instead should \\"assert a core of Britishness\\".Baldwin, Tom; Rozenberg, Gabriel (3 April 2004)\\"Britain 'must scrap multiculturalism'\\", The Times. In 2006, Livingstone accused Phillips of \\"pandering to the right\\" so much that he \\"would soon join the BNP\\".Mayor's BNP outburst at Phillips BBC News Phillips himself replied that his views had been \\"well documented\\" and \\"well supported\\". Phillips has made speeches stating that \\"it was right to ask hard questions about multicultural Britain\\". Although he apologised for his presentation of research by the Australian academic Michael Poulsen of statistics on levels of segregation, which had led to some controversy, he welcomed the focus on integration of different communities after the launch of A Commission for Integration and Cohesion.UK race chief in ghetto apology BBC News. Phillips has subsequently cited recent work by, amongst others, Professor Eric Kaufmann of Birkbeck College, London showing that white and non-white segregation in London and Birmingham has increased during the census period to 2011. After the 2005 riots in France, Phillips warned that \\"inequality, race and powerlessness\\" can be \\"incendiary\\". He was invited to advise the French government and in September 2007 was awarded the Chevalier de la L√©gion d'Honneur.French Embassy in London: Mr Trevor Phillips made Chevalier de la L√©gion d‚ÄôHonneur. Phillips wrote in May 2016 \\"Rome may not yet be in flames, but I think I can smell the smouldering whilst we hum to the music of liberal self-delusion\\" by ignoring the effects of mass immigration to the United Kingdom, explicitly comparing his warning to Enoch Powell's Rivers of Blood speech. Chairman of the EHRC Phillips' tenure as EHRC chairman was dogged by controversies and internal dissent. Under his leadership it was reported that six of the body's commissioners departed after expressing concerns about his leadership and probity and others were reported to be considering their position.Sam Jones and Afua Hirsch, \\"Rebels turn on Trevor Phillips' leadership of rights body\\", The Guardian, 21 July 2009Sam Jones and James Sturcke, \\"New resignation hits Equality and Human Rights Commission\\", The Guardian, 25 July 2009. In 2010 Phillips was investigated regarding alleged attempts to influence a committee (the Joint Committee on Human Rights) writing a report on him. He would have been the first non-politician in over half a century to be convicted of this offence, but the Lords Committee found that the allegations were \\"subjective, and that no firm factual evidence is presented in their support; nor are they borne out by the submissions by individual members of the JCHR.\\" He was cleared of contempt of Parliament and the House of Lords recommended that new and clearer guidance about the conduct of witnesses to Select Committees be issued. However, he was told his behaviour was \\"inappropriate and ill-advised\\". Phillips completed his second term of office in September 2012, which, together with his term at the CRE made him the longest serving leader of any UK equality commission. In 2006 Phillips has warned that Britain's current approach to multiculturalism could cause Britain to \\"sleepwalk towards segregation\\".Dominic Casciani, So who's right over segregation? BBC News. He expanded on these views in 2016 a publication by Civitas entitled Race and Faith: the Deafening Silence, in which he said that \\"squeamishness about addressing diversity and its discontents risks allowing our country to sleepwalk to a catastrophe that will set community against community, endorse sexist aggression, suppress freedom of expression, reverse hard-won civil liberties, and undermine the liberal democracy that has served this country so well for so long.\\" Views on Islam and free speech Phillips has spoken on the need for free speech to \\"allow people to offend each other.\\" These comments came after the protests against the Danish cartoons satirising the Islamic prophet, Muhammad which sparked protests in the Muslim world. He stated in an ITV interview: \\"One point of Britishness is that people can say what they like about the way we should live, however absurd, however unpopular it is.\\" While supporting free speech, Phillips has spoken out against providing the far right with a platform. Discussing the Oxford Union's invitation to BNP leader Nick Griffin and Holocaust denier David Irving, he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: \\"As a former president of the National Union of Students, I'm ashamed that this has happened. This is not a question of freedom of speech, this is a juvenile provocation. What I would say to students at Oxford is: You're supposed to be brilliant. Put your brains back in your head. People fought and died for freedom of expression and freedom of speech. They didn't fight and die for it so it could be used as a sort of silly parlour game. This is just a piece of silly pranksterism and the issues are too serious to be left to that.\\" Griffin has since hit back at Phillips by declaring him a \\"black racist\\" in an interview given to Channel 4. Opposition to 42-day detention In early June 2008 Phillips as EHRC head voiced that he \\"remain[ed] unpersuaded that the government has yet provided compelling evidence for what our legal advice shows would be an effective suspension of some human rights\\". Phillips was responding to the growing uproar surrounding proposals to amend counter- terrorism legislation to permit 42 days' detention without charge. He raised the possibility of the EHRC legally testing the legislation by judicial review. In the event, the Brown government maintained the limit on detention without charge at 28 days (although in practice a 14-day limit was observed). Following the installation of a Conservative‚ÄìLiberal Democrat coalition government, the limit was in January 2011 allowed to revert to 14 days. Comparisons between Britain and the United States In an article published in 2003,Trevor Phillips, \\"More Than Skin Deep\\", The Guardian, 18 August 2003; also reproduced on the Common Dreams website. Phillips stated \\"from Rome, through Constantinople to Venice and London, our (European) nations have a history of peacefully absorbing huge, diverse movements of people, driven by war, famine and persecution; and there is no history of long-term ethnic segregation of the kind one can see in any US city\\". In a March 2008 article for Prospect magazine, Phillips was cool on Barack Obama as a potential Presidential candidate, and speculated that if he did become President it might \\"postpone the arrival of a post-racial America\\".Trevor Phillips, \\"Healing postponed\\", Prospect, 28 March 2008. Following Obama's election, in an interview for the London Times on 8 November 2008, Trevor Phillips said that he believed it would be impossible for a black candidate in the United Kingdom to rise to the top in politics because of institutional racism within the Labour Party, saying: > If Barack Obama had lived here I would be very surprised if even somebody as > brilliant as him would have been able to break through the institutional > stranglehold that there is on power within the Labour party. The comments gained support and criticism from members of ethnic communities in the UK. Personal life Phillips married Asha Bhownagary, a Parsi child psychotherapist, in 1981 and they have two daughters. They separated in 2008. He remarried in September 2013.

His first Cabinet post under Henry Campbell-Bannerman was as President of the Board of Education, after which he served as First Lord of the Admiralty. His most important roles were as Home Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer during the premiership of H. H. Asquith. He was studious and meticulous, noted for his attention to detail, but also for being bureaucratic and partisan. Background and education Born in Kensington, London, McKenna was the son of William Columban McKenna and his wife Emma, daughter of Charles Hanby. Sir Joseph Neale McKenna was his uncle. McKenna was educated at King's College School and at Trinity Hall, Cambridge. At Cambridge he was a notable rower. In 1886, he was a member of the Trinity Hall Boat Club eight that won the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta.R C Lehmann \\"The Complete Oarsman He rowed bow in the winning Cambridge boat in the 1887 Boat Race. Also in 1887 he was a member of the Trinity Hall coxless four that won the Stewards' Challenge Cup at Henley. Political career Reginald McKenna c1895 McKenna was elected at the 1895 general election as Member of Parliament (MP) for North Monmouthshire. McKenna was a Liberal Imperialist. After the Khaki Election of 1900, he favoured the return to government of former Liberal Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, although this did not happen.on 17 November 1900, in conversation with Wemyss Reid, in McKinstry, L. (2005) \\"Rosebery\\", 425. In December 1905 McKenna was appointed, in preference to Winston Churchill, as Financial Secretary to the Treasury. He then served in the Liberal Cabinets of Campbell-Bannerman and Asquith as President of the Board of Education, First Lord of the Admiralty (1908‚Äì11), and Home Secretary. He was considered methodical and efficient, but his opponents thought him priggish, prissy and lacking in charisma. McKenna's estimates were submitted to unprecedented scrutiny by the 'economists' Lloyd George and Churchill. McKenna submitted large naval estimates in December 1906 for the years 1909-10 of ¬£36 m. This was the Dreadnought building programme inspired by naval reformer Admiral Fisher. Reginald McKenna by Leslie Ward (Vanity Fair caricatures) entitled \\"In the winning crew\\" In 1907 James Bryce was appointed Ambassador to the US, Augustine Birrell replaced him as Chief Secretary for Ireland, and McKenna succeeded Birrell as President of the Board of Education. He was responsible for such reforms as the introduction of free places in secondary schools and the bestowing upon local authorities the powers to deal with the health and physical needs of children, and was promoted to the cabinet as First Lord of the Admiralty only a year later. = First Lord = Electors! Do You Like McKenna's Navy Cut? At the Admiralty McKenna started the Labour Exchange Bill from May 1909, a policy later associated with Churchill, in an effort to relieve unemployment. He was increasingly attacked in speeches outside Parliament. The number of Dreadnoughts to be built was increased from six to eight ships; four initially and four later. Lloyd George and Churchill had attacked McKenna's position in a plan to persuade the Liberal left of the need for defence cuts. Nonetheless McKenna was on the Cabinet finance committee that discussed Lloyd George's budget proposal of 7 March 1910, and on 12 April refused to contemplate the chancellor's proposed defence cuts. He held his seat in the General Elections of 1910, and kept his post at the Admiralty in Asquith's government. McKenna had attended the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence (CID) on 17 December 1908 and 23 March 1909, during which periods he had fully comprehended the gravity of the naval threat. He also attended the famous meeting on 23 August 1911, chaired by the Prime Minister, at which Brigadier-General Wilson, over naval opposition, persuaded ministers to deploy an expeditionary force to France in the event of war. Asquith dismissed the Royal Navy's war plans as \\"wholly impracticable\\". McKenna had little support in Cabinet, and Asquith, Richard Haldane, and Churchill wanted the latter to replace him at the Admiralty. Fortunately war was averted despite the Agadir Crisis. On 16 November McKenna accepted the Home Office, swapping jobs with Churchill. In total McKenna had 'laid the keels' of 18 new battleships that contributed mightily to the Jutland fleet. McKenna commenced the Dreadnought Arms Race: the fundamental strategic basis was for a vast fleet, large enough to intimidate Germany to decline to fight. But in the event Britain's advantage was ephemeral and fleeting. = Peacetime Home Secretary = McKenna accepted his move to the Home Office in October 1911 partly because he had recovered from an appendicitis operation. He was one of numerous Cabinet appointments at the time which, according to historian Duncan Tanner, \\"pushed the (Liberal) party still further to the left\\". McKenna and Charles Hobhouse were responsible for the Welsh Church Disestablishment Bill finally drafted on 20 February 1912. The ODNB calls him a wise and judicious Home Secretary. He was stolidly opposed by the Conservative F.E.Smith. Another piece of legislation ensued in the Coal Mines Bill regulating pay and conditions. McKenna enthusiastically supported the minimum wage bill in principle, but partly to prevent 'civil war' in the coalfields. With Asquith's approval McKenna left a Cabinet meeting, at which he was on the majority side, to attend on the King, having left behind an \\"admirable memo.\\" Throughout the summer of 1912 he opposed the escalation of the naval race, occasioned by Churchill's plan to build a new Mediterranean fleet. He opposed a Temperance Bill. He also made a radical proposal to let prisoners out on short licence, which he sponsored to deal with militant suffragists, a bill unanimously approved by cabinet. On 13 March 1913 he voted against compulsory military training. At a \\"council of war\\" with Lloyd George on 13 June, McKenna was left in no doubt that Asquith had refused the chancellor's resignation over the Marconi scandal. McKenna himself was categorical as to their innocence of the share dealings. This advice may have saved the Welsh Wizard's career. He made it clear that the Government could not secure any contracts for favours whether from Marconi or Lord Cowdray. With Irish parentage in his own family, McKenna was happy to support the half-cash, half-stock scheme on 16 July for the Irish Purchase Act introduced by Augustine Birrell, as the prospect for Irish Home Rule drew ever nearer. Dublin was in turmoil, to McKenna and others on the Left (Walter Runciman, Charles Hobhouse, and John Burns) it was as much Edward Carson's fault as James Larkin's. McKenna blamed Churchill for stirring up the Northcliffe press against the cabinet's plans to boost the army's budget by ¬£800,000 and a proposed increase of ¬£6 million in the Royal Navy's bi-annual estimate. In the new year McKenna was one of Lloyd George's group to analyse Churchill's plans for Dreadnought construction; they insisted that expenditure must be reduced to that of 1912‚Äì13. In late January 1914 his friends Charles Hobhouse and Sir John Simon agreed to lobby the Chancellor. The following day at the Treasury their \\"entire sitting was taken up\\" by the group's tirade against Churchill's management of the Admiralty. They retired the next morning to Smith Square to discuss the Home Rule crisis in Ireland; a dissolution \\"would be a complete practical triumph for the Tory Party\\", wrote Hobhouse; their group was expanded to include Beauchamp and Runciman. On 29 January the group sent a petition to Asquith protesting against the Naval Estimates, now assumed to total ¬£52.5 million. McKenna had been receiving messages of grave concern from Irish leader John Redmond. On 17 July, before the weekend, McKenna proposed an Amending Bill to the Government of Ireland Bill to allow any Ulster county to opt out of Home Rule. = Wartime Home Secretary = The problems of Ireland paled into insignificance in early August. Broadly-speaking McKenna, an Asquithian, supported the pledge to go to war to defend Belgium's neutrality, but he did not want to send the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). Charles Masterman, Runciman and McKenna all wanted to stall the Kaiser for invaluable time.Cabinet Discussions, 1 Aug 1914 Most of the cabinet opposed armed intervention in France, almost up until the declaration of war. The Home Secretary remained in charge of State Security: more than 6,000 espionage cases were investigated, none of which produced any traitors. The 'German Plot' in Ireland had sparked fears that Britain was infiltrated by a network of spies. In response cable telegraphs were laid from Dartmouth to Brest in Brittany to guarantee Allied communications links. On 20 October a warrant went out for the arrest of 23,000 Germanic aliens, and food supplies to Belgium were cut lest they fell into German hands. McKenna refused to allow the publication of the sinking of HMS Audacious; in the event it was 'leaked' to The Evening News anyway. And on 30 October the Cabinet announced a general policy of censorship. In the Wilhelmina case he again referred to the legal situation, seeking a solution in international law. McKenna disliked the autocratic and dismissive Lord Kitchener, appointed Secretary of State for War at the start of the war. Immediately on his appointment their relations soured: the policy of voluntary recruitment continued as the Army needed one million men, until the Adjutant-General complained there were too many new recruits. On 5 March 1915 McKenna reported that the Ritz Carlton Hotel, New York was being used as a spy network to inform on British intelligence; the government, determined to prevent the USA entering the war on Germany's side, informed Washington. McKenna supported Asquith and gradually fell out with Lloyd George. Internal wrangling in Cabinet conversations reached fever pitch: Edwin Montagu, a cousin of Herbert Samuel and ally of Lloyd George suggested that Asquith was jealous of Sir Edward Grey's prowess in the Foreign Office. When in April 1915 the Home Secretary banned Montagu from his home for six months, the scene was set for a final split in the party. McKenna was a Teetotaller, something he had impressed upon the King was necessary for good government. His Majesty \\"took the pledge\\" for the duration of the war, an example which Lord Chancellor Haldane felt he had to follow for the remainder of his time in office. McKenna's asceticism won few new friends, so that when the end came for his career it was both dramatic and complete. = Asquith's Liberal Chancellor = In May 1915 Asquith formed a coalition government. McKenna, a reluctant coalitionist, became Chancellor of the Exchequer. In the meantime, McKenna oversaw the issue of the Second War Loan in June 1915, at an interest rate of 4.5%, although his first budget was actually on 21 September 1915 was a serious attempt to deal with an impending debt crisis. Revenues were rising, but not by enough to cover the ¬£1.6 billion government expenditure. McKenna increased income tax rates and introduced a 50% excess profit tax, and increases in indirect taxation of goods such as tea, coffee, and tobacco. Post Office charge increases could not be included in the Budget (as they would have endangered its status as a money bill), and were instead introduced in a Post Office and Telegraph Bill. = McKenna duties = In September 1915 he introduced a 33% levy on luxury imports in order to fund the war effort. The McKenna duties applied to cinematographic film; clocks and watches; motorcars and motorcycles; and musical instruments. The duties were revoked by Ramsay MacDonald's short-lived Labour government in 1924, only to be reimposed in 1925. = Fiscal relations and Lloyd George = The April 1916 budget saw further large rises in income and excess profit taxes, at a time when prices of basic food commodities were rising. Sales taxes were extended to rail tickets, mineral water, cider and perry, and entertainments. The government pledged that if they issued War Loan at the even higher interest (as they did with the 5% issue of 1917), holders of the 4.5% bonds might also convert to the new rate. His predecessor David Lloyd George criticised McKenna in his memoirs for increasing the interest rate from 3.5% on the 1914 War Loan at a time when investors had few alternatives and might even have had their capital \\"conscripted\\" by the government. Not only did the change ultimately increase the nation's interest payments by ¬£100 million/year but it meant rates were higher throughout the economy during the post-war depression. Compared with France, the British government relied more on short-term financing in the form of treasury bills and exchequer bonds during World War I; Treasury bills provided the bulk of British government funds in 1916. McKenna fell out with Lord Cunliffe, Governor of the Bank of England. Furthermore, he tried to sequestrate the assets of the US Prudential Assurance Company to pay for American war materiel purchases. An opponent of Lloyd George, McKenna was critical of the Prime Minister's political approach, telling Conservative politician Arthur Balfour that \\"you disagree with us, but you can understand our principles. Lloyd George doesn't understand them and we can't make him\\". But unlike McKenna, Lloyd George had no problem with relations with Cunliffe. McKenna nevertheless saw the state as having an important role in society, a sentiment that he shared with Asquith. As noted by his biographer and nephew, Stephen McKenna, > Without trying to define the whole duty of Liberal man, Asquith and McKenna > were at one in seeing that if certain services were not undertaken by the > state, they would not be undertaken at all. Old age pensions were a case in > point. They had not been dangled as an electioneering bait; Asquith made no > appeal to sentiment or emotion when the Cabinet committee of investigation > was set up, but from their first days together at the Treasury he and > McKenna had agreed that, if the money could be found, this was a matter on > which a beginning must be made forthwith. = Conscription = The issue of enforced service in the armed forces was controversial in Britain. The Conservatives were almost entirely in favour, but the Liberals were split, with Asquithians largely opposed on libertarian grounds, whilst Lloyd George united with the Tories in what he declared to be a vital national interest. Sir John Simon, Liberal Home Secretary and an ally of McKenna, resigned over the conscription of bachelors in January 1916. As Chancellor of Exchequer McKenna objected to the conscription of married men in May 1916 on purely economic grounds, arguing that it would 'deplete' Britain's war industries. McKenna knew that for Asquith to remain in office he had to move towards conscription, whether he liked it or not; if he did not, the Tories would topple the government. At a decisive meeting on 4 December 1916 McKenna tried to persuade Asquith to sack Lloyd George to save the government. McKenna retired into opposition upon the fall of Asquith at the end of 1916. =Chairman of the Midland Bank= He lost his seat in the 1918 general election and became a non-executive member of the board of the Midland Bank at the invitation of the Chairman, Liberal MP Sir Edward Holden. Before Holden died in 1919, McKenna had sat in his office everyday to observe the activities of a chairman. An elaborate coda was drafted to allow the bank's directors to determine whether he should resign his Pontypool seat where he was presently the Liberal candidate (his previous seat of North Monmouthshire had disappeared in boundary changes). But the situation did not arise as he was not elected in 1922. The new Prime Minister Bonar Law hoped to persuade him to come out of retirement and serve once again at the Exchequer in a Conservative Cabinet, but he refused, and remained in private life. His refusal was partly because he wanted to promote an alliance between Bonar Law and Asquith, who was still official leader of the Liberal Party. The following year Bonar Law's successor Stanley Baldwin repeated the request and McKenna was more agreeable, but again declined. McKenna used his status as chairman of one of the big five British banks to argue that monetary policy could be used to achieve domestic macroeconomic objectives. At the Chamberlain-Bradbury committee he questioned whether a return to the gold standard was desirable. John Maynard Keynes was the only other witness to do so, although others proposed a delayed return. = A return to Government? = Time Cover, 3 Mar 1924 According to Lord Birkenhead Lloyd George's Liberals were of poor intellect, with no great leaders to take the government onwards. McKenna was certainly a technocrat but did not want to be Prime Minister, yet he might conceivably have been offered the post. In reality, the Conservatives wanted one of their own. However he wished to enter Parliament in July 1923 as MP for the City of London and neither of the incumbent MPs would agree to vacate in order to make room. As a result, McKenna declined as he had no wish to vacate the bank. McKenna continued to write economic reports for Whitehall and Westminster, but by August 1923 his political career had come to an end. The lasting impression was one of the pin-striped merchant banker, a model of precision, but not a clubbable leader of men; his absence from London society and Brooks's seemed to imply retirement. However, his financial reputation was such as to prompt Stanley Baldwin to demand his return to government in the 1930s. As late as 1939 it was proposed that he should be brought back to replace Liberal National Chancellor Sir John Simon. McKenna was the last of the Asquithians to die, in 1943. Family McKenna was married in 1908 to Pamela Jekyll (who died November 1943), younger daughter of Sir Herbert Jekyll (brother of landscape gardener Gertrude Jekyll) and his wife Dame Agnes Jekyll, n√©e Graham. They had two sons ‚Äì Michael (died 1931) and David, who married Lady Cecilia Elizabeth Keppel (12 April 1910 ‚Äì 16 June 2003), a daughter of Walter Keppel, 9th Earl of Albemarle in 1934. McKenna was a talented financier, and a champion bridge player in his free time. In royal company at Balmoral McKenna played golf.Haig, Diaries, p.285-6 Reginald McKenna died in London on 6 September 1943, and was buried at St Andrew's Church in Mells, Somerset. His wife died two months later, and is buried beside him. McKenna was a regular client of Sir Edwin Lutyens who designed the Midland Bank headquarters in Poultry, London, and several branches. Pamela McKenna was a high society hostess whose dinner parties charmed Asquith at their Lutyens-built townhouse in Smith Square. Lutyens the unofficial imperial-government architect built several homes for McKenna, and the political classes, as well as his grave. Lutyens was commissioned to build 36 Smith Square in 1911, followed by Park House in Mells Park, Somerset, built in 1925. The owners of Mells Park were Sir John Horner and his wife Frances, n√©e Graham, who was Agnes Jekyll's sister, and they agreed to let the park to McKenna for a nominal rent, on the understanding that he would rebuild the house. Lutyens built a final house for McKenna at Halnaker Park, in Halnaker, Sussex, in 1938. Lutyens designed the McKenna family tomb in St Andrew's Church, Mells, in 1932. His nephew Stephen McKenna was a popular novelist who published a biography of his uncle in 1948. Publications * (1928) Post-War Banking Policy: A Series of Addresses London: William Heinemann.

He served under David Lloyd George as Minister of Labour between 1919 and 1920, as President of the Board of Trade between 1920 and 1921 and as Chancellor of the Exchequer between 1921 and 1922. In 1937 he was ennobled as Viscount Horne of Slamannan. Background and education Horne was born at Slamannan, Stirlingshire, the son of Reverend Robert Stevenson Horne, the village's Church of Scotland minister, and Mary, daughter of Thomas Lockhead. He was educated at George Watson's College in Edinburgh and the University of Glasgow, where he studied Law and was President of the Students' Representative Council. Career until 1918 Horne then spent a year teaching philosophy at the University College of North Wales, before being elected to the Faculty of Advocates (Scottish Bar) in 1896. He became a successful advocate, specialising in commercial and shipping cases, and became a King's Counsel in 1910. He also served as Examiner in Philosophy (1896‚Äì1900) and Rector (1921‚Äì1924) at the University of Aberdeen. He was a board member of several companies including directorships of the Suez Canal Company, chairman of the Great Western Railway Company and director of several other companies and banks. During the First World War, Horne became Director of Railways on the Western Front with the honorary rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in the Royal Engineers. In 1917 he joined the Admiralty as Assistant Inspector-General of Transportation, becoming Director of Materials and Priority in 1918, and Director of Labour and Third Civil Lord later the same year. Political career Having unsuccessfully stood for Stirlingshire in both general elections of 1910, Horne was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Glasgow Hillhead in 1918.leighrayment.com House of Commons: Hertford to Honiton He served under David Lloyd George as Minister of Labour between 1919 and 1920, as President of the Board of Trade between 1920 and 1921 and as Chancellor of the Exchequer between 1921 and 1922. It was in that capacity that he was involved in the negotiations leading to signed the Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement. Leonid Krasin pressurised Horne to support the treaty by threatening to cancel orders with textile mills in Yorkshire, as only the mills with Soviet orders were working full-time. When the treaty was signed, it was the first recognition by Britain of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. When the Lloyd George Coalition Government fell in 1922, Horne refused to join the new government of Bonar Law. Two years later, Stanley Baldwin offered to make Horne Minister of Labour once more, but Horne declined, preferring to concentrate on work in the City. Although he remained a Member of Parliament until 1937, he never again held ministerial office. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1918 for his war services, and raised to Knight Grand Cross (GBE) in the 1920 civilian war honours for his services as Minister of Labour. In 1919, he was also sworn of the Privy Council. He was ennobled as Viscount Horne of Slamannan, of Slamannan in the County of Stirling, on 9 June 1937.

DAR-10 was designed for horizontal and dive bombing, reconnaissance, and ground attack. Design and development The DAR 10 was designed by Zvetan Lazarov in 1938 in the DAR (Darzhavna Aeroplanna Rabotilnitsa, meaning literally 'State Airplane Workshop') factory in Bozhurishte, near the capital Sofia. The DAR 10 was a single-engine two-seat (pilot and gunner) low-wing cantilever monoplane aircraft of conventional layout. Its two seats were in tandem under enclosed glazing. Its tailwheel undercarriage was fixed, and the mainwheels were spatted. The wings had a wooden structure, covered with plywood. Flaps were not used. The fuselage was comparatively wide and deep, to accommodate the nose-mounted radial engine. It was constructed of steel-tube framework and wood formers, covered with fabric. Three-bladed steel propellers were used. Two prototypes were built, powered by different engines: *DAR 10A Bekas (Bulgarian: \\"snipe\\"), powered by an Alfa Romeo 128 R.C.21 nine-cylinder radial engine rated at 950 hp (709 kW). This was the first DAR 10 to fly, on 2 July 1941.Bern√°d 2001, p.29. It was designed to carry four machine guns (two fixed forward-firing and two in rear gunner position). It could carry five 100-kg bombs, mounted under the wings. There was also the possibility of a fixed 20 mm forward-firing cannon installation in the forward fuselage. This aircraft crashed in October 1942. In spite of good flight reviews, the type was not chosen for production. The high-wing KB-11 Fazan was selected for production instead. *DAR 10F (the \\"F\\" to indicate its Fiat engine), powered by a Fiat A 74 R.C.38 14-cylinder radial engine rated at 870 hp (649 kW). This aircraft first flew in March 1945. It was slightly heavier and longer than the DAR-10A. Its top speed was 454 km/h (282 mph). Thanks to a stronger construction and dive brakes, it could serve also as a dive bomber. It could be equipped with two fixed fuselage-mounted 20 mm cannon firing forward, two fixed wing-mounted machine guns, and two machine guns for the gunner. It could carry one 500 kg (1,100 lb) bomb or one 250 kg (551 lb) and four 100 kg (110 lb). The bombs were mounted under the fuselage and wings. The DAR-10 was not selected for production. Some sources suggest that it was passed over in favor of the German Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bomber, while the improved DAR-10F was not selected as World War II had ended and Bulgaria had access to ample supplies of modern Soviet aircraft such as the Ilyushin Il-2 and Il-10.

Description  The plant produces an inflorescence or flower stalk that grows to about 1 m high. It has smooth leaves shooting off from a large basal rosette, with distinctive waved or curled edges. On the stalk flowers and seeds are produced in clusters on branched stems, with the largest cluster being found at the apex. The seeds are shiny, brown and encased in the calyx of the flower that produced them. This casing enables the seeds to float on water and get caught in wool and animal fur, and this helps the seeds to spread to new locations.Richard H. Uva, Joseph C. Neal and Joseph M. Ditomaso, Weeds of The Northeast, (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1997), Pp. 286-287. The root-structure is a large, yellow, forking taproot. Rumex crispus has a number of subspecies with distinctive habitat preferences. Rumex crispus ssp. crispus occurs on waste and cultivated ground. Rumex crispus ssp. littoreus has a coastal distribution, and Rumex crispus ssp. uliginosus occurs on tidal estuarine mud. The species hybridizes readily with other Rumex species including Rumex obtusifolius, Rumex obovatus, Rumex palustris and Rumex maritimus. Distribution Common in Ireland,Hackney, P. 1992.

Cork University Press the United States, and southern Canada.  Ecology  Fruits of curled dock (Rumex crispus) Curly dock grows in a wide variety of habitats, including disturbed soil, waste areas, roadsides, fields/meadows, shorelines, and forest edges. It is widely naturalised throughout the temperate world and has become a serious invasive species in many areas, including throughout North America, southern South America, New Zealand and parts of Australia. It spreads through the seeds contaminating crop seeds, and sticking to clothing. It is classified as an \\"injurious weed\\" under the UK Weeds Act 1959. In the United States, it is classified as a noxious weed in the states of Arkansas and Iowa. It is often seen in disturbed soils at the edges of roadsides, railway beds, and car parks. = Host plant = The curled dock is an optimal host plant for certain Lepidoptera species including, Agrotis ipsilon (black cutworm). Adult moths oviposit on these dense, low-lying leaves during the spring/summer season.Busching, M. K., and F. T.

Uses and toxicity  It can be used as a wild leaf vegetable; the young leaves should be boiled in several changes of water to remove as much of the oxalic acid in the leaves as possible or can be added directly to salads in moderate amounts.Lee Allen Peterson, Edible Wild Plants, (New York City: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1977), p. 154. Once the plant matures it becomes too bitter to consume. Dock leaves are an excellent source of both vitamin A and vitamin C, as well as a source of iron and potassium.http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable- products/2734/2 \\"Nutritional Facts and Analysis of Dock, raw\\" Curly Dock leaves are somewhat tart due to the presence of high levels of oxalic acid, and although quite palatable, this plant should only be consumed in moderation as it can irritate the urinary tract and increase the risk of developing kidney stones. It should be used with care during lactation, as it may cause a laxative effect in the infant. The seeds of the yellow dock, once dried thoroughly, are edible as well.Thayer, Samuel, March 1, 2010. Nature's Garden: A Guide to Identifying, Harvesting, and Preparing Wild Plants Forager's Harvest Press The dark-brown to black seed pods remain on the stalk until the spring when leaves start growing again. While many wild foraged grains must be winnowed, the pods of Rumex Crispus are small enough that it is more efficient to grind them with the grain. The resulting flour is much like buckwheat in flavor, and while some may find it too bitter, many prefer the seeds over the tartness of the leaves. In Western herbalism, the root is often used for treating anemia, due to its high level of iron.Lust, John B.. The herb book. New York: B. Lust Publications, 1974. It can be powdered and given in capsules, often in combination with stinging nettle ‚Äì Urtica dioica. This is a classic combination with the plant. Both the leaves and root may be laxative in some individuals, though not in all, and generally it is mild. This is due to the presence of anthroquinone glycosides, and is not an action that should be relied upon, but seen as a possible effect of the plant when taken. The plant may also cause intestinal discomfort to some people. The plant will help with skin conditions if taken internally or applied externally to things like itching, scrofula, and sores. Some studies show that certain anthroquinones can help stop or slow cancer growth, but this may or may not apply to the ones in yellow dock. Yellow dock is part of the homeopathic pharmacopoeia. It is used mainly for respiratory conditions, specifically those with a tickling cough that is worse when exposed to cold air. It mentions also passing pains, excessive itching, and that it helps enlarged lymphs.\\"Rumex Crispus.\\" - Homeopathic Remedies. N.p., n.d.

He served as Home Secretary from 1900 to 1902 and as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1902 to 1903. Background and education Ritchie was born at Dundee, Scotland, the third son of William Ritchie, of Rockhill near Broughty Ferry in Forfarshire, head of the firm of William Ritchie & Sons, of London and Dundee, East India merchants, jute spinners and manufacturers. The Ritchie family had long been connected with the town of Dundee. His elder brother James Thomson Ritchie was Lord Mayor of London from 1903 to 1904 and was created a Baronet in 1903 (a title which became extinct on his death. Ritchie was educated at the City of London School, after which he went into the family business. He married Margaret Ower, daughter of Thomas Ower of Perth, on 7 December 1858.

In 1885 he was made secretary to the Admiralty, and from 1886 to 1892 was President of the Local Government Board in Lord Salisbury's second administration, sitting as member for St George in the East. He was responsible for the Local Government Act 1888, instituting county councils; and a large section of the Conservative party always owed him a grudge for having originated the London County Council. In Lord Salisbury's later ministries, as member for Croydon (1895‚Äì1906), he was President of the Board of Trade (1895‚Äì1900) and Home Secretary (1900‚Äì1902); and when Sir Michael Hicks-Beach retired in August 1902, he became Chancellor of the Exchequer in Balfour's cabinet. In his earlier years he had been a fair-trader and he was strongly opposed to Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain's movement for a preferential tariff, leading to his sacking by Balfour in September 1903. Ritchie's son in law, the Scottish architect Mervyn McCartney, built a country house for Ritchie, Welders House, in the Buckinghamshire village of Jordans. On 22 December 1905, he was created a peer as Baron Ritchie of Dundee, of Welders in the Parish of Chalfont St Giles in the County of Buckingham. However, he was in ill-health, and died at Biarritz in January 1906. He is buried at Kensal Green Cemetery, London. He was succeeded in the title by his second but only surviving son, Charles. Ritchie was elected as Rector of the University of Aberdeen in late October 1902, taking up the position the following month, serving for three years until November 1905.

Early life A member of the famous Baring banking family, he was the eldest son of Sir Thomas Baring, 2nd Baronet, and his wife Mary Ursula Sealy, eldest daughter of Charles Sealy. Baring was educated at Winchester College and then Eton College. He obtained a double first class from Christ Church, Oxford, in 1817, and graduated with a Master of Arts four years later. In 1823, he was called to the Bar at Lincoln's Inn and in 1848, he succeeded his father as baronet. Political career Baring entered the British House of Commons in 1826, sitting as a Member of Parliament for Portsmouth until his retirement in 1865. A year later, he was raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom as Baron Northbrook. Baring was appointed a Lord of the Treasury in 1830, a post he held for the next four years until June 1834. He was then a Secretary to the Treasury until November of the same year, executing this office again between 1835 and 1839. Subsequently, Baring was sworn of the Privy Council and joined the cabinet as Chancellor of the Exchequer, serving until the fall of the Melbourne government in August 1841. He returned to the cabinet in January 1849, replacing Lord Auckland as First Lord of the Admiralty in Russell's cabinet, until its fall in 1852. Baring was a member of the Canterbury Association.

It is sometimes seen as a spiritual successor to Taito's earlier Full Throttle. The player assumes the role of a police officer named Tony Gibson, member of the \\"Chase Special Investigation Department.\\" Along with his partner, Raymond Broady, he must stop fleeing criminals in high-speed pursuits in a black Porsche 928. The game was well received in the gaming industry, resulting in three arcade-based sequels being released: Special Criminal Investigation (1989), Super Chase: Criminal Termination (1992) and Chase H.Q. 2 (2007). Two spin-offs were also released: Crime City (1989) and Quiz H.Q. (1990). The game was ported to many home computers by Ocean Software in 1989, including versions for the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, MSX, Amiga and Atari ST. Taito produced versions for the Family Computer (1989), Game Boy (1990), Master System (1990), TurboGrafx-16 (1990), Game Gear (1991) and Saturn (1996). It was released for PlayStation 2 in Japan in 2007 as part of Taito Memories II Volume 2. Gameplay At the start of each level the player is informed who they are pursuing, a great distance away: They must apprehend the criminal before their time limit expires. The criminal's car is constantly moving away, so if the player repeatedly crashes or drives too slowly, the criminal will escape. At some points during the game the road splits, and the correct turn must be taken, otherwise it will take longer to catch the criminal. When their vehicle is reached, the time limit is extended; the vehicle must be rammed a number of times until the criminal is forced to stop, then is arrested. The game includes five levels. Both the initial time limit to reach the criminal and the time extension to ram the criminal are 60, 65, or 70 seconds. When Nancy at Chase HQ (at the start of every level) calls on the radio, the frequency is always 144.X (various) MHz. This is actually the 2-meter band of amateur or ham radio frequencies. Although superficially similar in technology to Sega's Out Run, Chase HQ features significant technical advancements over that title in the presentation of perspective, hills and track splits. Villains (for arcade versions): :1. Ralph, the Idaho Slasher (White Lotus Esprit) :2. Carlos, the New York armed robber (Yellow Lamborghini Countach) :3. Chicago pushers (Silver Porsche 959) :4. L.A. kidnapper (Blue Ferrari 288 GTO) :5. Eastern Bloc Spy (Red Porsche 928) The last villain's car is always listed as unidentified. If the level is completed, bonus points are as follows: if completed without continuing, 100,000 times level in play, otherwise, 10,000; plus, 5,000 per second saved for completing level. A 5,000,000-point award is collected for beating the game.

It was released on the Genesis as Chase H.Q. II (known as Super H.Q. in Japan), with some minor changes, including alternative player vehicles. In December 1990, the game was included on the Wheels Of Fire compilation, which also featured Hard Drivin, Power Drift and Turbo OutRun. In June 1991, the game was released on the Power Up compilation, which also featured Altered Beast, Turrican, Rainbow Islands and X-Out. In 1993, Taito released Super Chase H.Q. (known in Japan as Super H.Q. Criminal Chaser) for the Super NES. Unlike other home versions, it is played in first person perspective and is based upon Super Chase: Criminal Termination rather than the original Chase H.Q. Gameplay is modeled on the original with some aspects of S.C.I. incorporated. There is also a Super Chase H.Q. for the Game Boy, which was released exclusively in North America, in 1994. The game is similar to the Game Boy's Taito Chase H.Q. (1991). In 1996, Taito released an emulation of the arcade original for the Sega Saturn in Japan, bundled together with Special Criminal Investigation on one disc. In 2000, Chase H.Q. Secret Police was released for the Game Boy Color. In July 2008, the TurboGrafx-16 version of the game was re-released on the Wii Virtual Console. A spin-off was released in 1989 titled Crime City. The game play deviates from the traditional third-person driving and is instead a side scrolling type shooter. Reception The game was very well received by critics. Upon release in arcades, Game Machine listed Chase H.Q. on their 15 November 1988 issue as being the second most-successful upright arcade unit of the year. Computer and Video Games gave it a positive review, stating \\"At last\\" a \\"racing game with something more to do than just whizzing around a track to beat the course time.\\" They concluded that it is \\"Fast and challenging with great graphics\\" and \\"good clear sound effects\\" and is \\"definitely a winner.\\"Computer and Video Games, issue 85 (November 1988), page 140 (published October 1988) ACE said that the \\"Out Run theme keeps being expanded and presented in different ways\\" like Power Drift but \\"Chase HQ is the best so far.\\" They concluded that the game's driving and violence is \\"a winning coin-up combination.\\" Crash said it \\"is a great game\\" and \\"the ultimate arcade version of cops-and-robbers movies\\".

The 16-bit Amiga and Atari ST versions received positive reviews, while the 8-bit ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC conversions received very high review scores and are generally recognised as the most accurate and most playable of the Ocean Software home computer releases. All three of the ZX Spectrum magazines awarded it 94% or above, praising the speed of the game and the originality. Crash gave the game 95%, while Sinclair User awarded it 96%. On the other hand, the 8-bit Commodore 64 conversion received a generally negative reception. At Japan's 1989 Gamest Awards, the arcade version was nominated for Hit Game of the Year, for which it was voted 10th place.Gamest, The Best Game 2: Gamest Mook Vol. 112, pages 6-26 According to an Ocean Software advert in 1989, the arcade version was voted Arcade Game of the Year.

Legacy Chase H.Q. was successful enough to earn two arcade- based sequels - the widely released Special Criminal Investigation released in 1989 and the extremely rare Super Chase: Criminal Termination released in 1992. It also earned two spin-offs - the run and gun Crime City, and the quiz game Quiz H.Q.. Special Criminal Investigation expands on the original with the addition of guns - the passenger can rise out of the T-top of his Nissan 300ZX Z32 and shoot at oncoming targets. To take advantage of this, enemies are placed throughout the level and will attempt to shoot at or ram the player as they attempt to pursue the main criminal. Deviating from the relatively realistic tracks on offer in the original, the sequel features pursuits through waterfalls and unfinished sections of elevated highway. Super Chase: Criminal Termination was the third arcade release in the Chase H.Q. series, released in 1992. The 1997 PlayStation game Ray Tracers, developed and released by Taito, has been described as \\"more or less a follow up\\" to the game, with \\"only a few differences\\" such as a different speed-boost system and a greater variety of targets. In February 2006, Chase H.Q. : Nancy Yori Kinkyuu Renraku () was presented at the Arcade Operator's Union trade show in Tokyo. The game was released as Chase H.Q. 2 later in the year. Saint Etienne recorded a demo dance track called \\"Chase HQ\\" that was inspired by Chase H.Q. It includes samples of the \\"Oh man!\\" and \\"Punch the pedal!\\" exclamations from the game action. The track was released as a bonus track on the 2009 Deluxe reissue of the band's 1991 album, Foxbase Alpha. Chase HQs gameplay, which involved ramming the enemy car while avoiding oncoming traffic, has been cited as a precursor to the gameplay of later titles such as Driver and Burnout.

Life and career =Early life= Saadeh was born in 1904 in Dhour El Choueir, Mount Lebanon. He was the son of a Lebanese Christian Orthodox physician, Khalil Saadeh and Naifa Nassir Khneisser. His father was himself a Syrian nationalist as well as democracy advocate, and also an intellectual and author, who has been described as \\"a prolific writer and polymath, whose works span the fields of politics, literature, journalism, novel-writing, and translation\\".Adel Beshara, The Origins of Syrian Nationhood : Histories, Pioneers and Identity, Taylor & Francis (2012), p. 13 Antoun Saadeh completed his elementary education in his birth town and continued his studies at the Lyc√©e des Fr√®res in Cairo and came back to Lebanon at the death of his mother.antounsaadeh.com/bio In the later part of 1919, Saadeh emigrated to the United States, where he resided for approximately one year with his uncle in Springer, New Mexico and worked at a local train station. In February 1921, he moved to Brazil with his father who was a prominent Arabic-language journalist. In 1924, Saadeh founded a secret society which aimed at the unification of Natural Syria. This society was dissolved the following year. Natural Syria, according to Saadeh, included the Levant, Palestine, Transjordan, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and parts of Southern Turkey. His concept of Syria included all religious, ethnic and linguistic groups living in this region. During his time spent in Brazil, Saadeh learned German and Russian. Ultimately, he became a polyglot fluent in seven languages : Arabic, English, Portuguese, French, German, Spanish and Russian.Rabi'a Abifadel, Sa'adeh : The Expatriate Critic and Man of Letters in Adel Beshara (ed.), Antun Sa'adeh : The Man, His Thought : an Anthology, Ithaca Press (2007), p. 442 =Activity in Lebanon= In July 1930, he returned to Lebanon. In 1931, he wrote \\"A Love Tragedy\\" which was first published with his \\"Story of the Holiday of Our Lady of Sidnaya\\" in Beirut in 1933. Also, in 1931, Saadeh worked at the daily newspaper Al-Ayyam, then in 1932 he taught German at the American University of Beirut. In 1933, he continued to publish pamphlets in the Al-Majalia magazine in Beirut. On 16 November 1932, Saadeh secretly founded the Syrian Social Nationalist Party. Three years later, on 16 November 1935, the existence of the party was proclaimed, and Saadeh was arrested and sentenced to six years imprisonment. During his confinement, he wrote his first book, \\"The Rise of Nations\\". He was released from prison early, but was once again detained in June 1936 where he wrote another book, \\"Principles Explained\\". In November of the same year, he was released from prison, but in March 1937, he was arrested again. During the time he spent in prison, he wrote his third book, \\"The Rise of the Syrian Nation\\", but his manuscript was confiscated and the authorities refused to return it to him. =Activity in emigration= He was released from prison in late May 1937. In November 1937, Saadeh founded the newspaper Al-Nahdhah. Saadeh led the party until 1938 then, for the second time, he left the country in order to establish party branches in the Lebanese emigration countries. Saadeh went to Brazil and founded the newspaper \\"New Syria\\". Soon afterwards he was arrested by the French colonial authorities and spent two months in prison. In 1939, at the outbreak of World War II, Saadeh moved to Argentina, where he remained until 1947. In Argentina, Saadeh continued his activities. He founded Al-Zawba'a (The storm) newspaper and wrote \\"The Struggle of the Intellect in Syrian Literature\\", which was printed in Buenos Aires. In 1943, Saadeh married Juliette Al-Mir and had three daughters with her. The French colonial court sentenced him in absentia to twenty years of imprisonment. =Return to Lebanon and execution= Saadeh in Lebanon Saadeh returned to Lebanon on 2 March 1947, following the country's independence from France. After his return, he made a revolutionary speech, upon which the authorities issued an arrest warrant which was in force for seven months and then withdrawn. In Lebanon, Saadeh founded the newspaper Al- Jil Al-Jadid. On 4 July 1949, the party declared a revolution in Lebanon in retaliation for a series of violent provocations staged by the government of Lebanon against party members. The revolt was suppressed and Saadeh traveled to Damascus to meet with Husni al-Za'im, the President of Syria at the time, who had previously agreed to support him. However, he was handed over by el- Zai'm to the Lebanese authorities. Saadeh and many of his followers were judged by a Lebanese military court, and were executed, Saadeh himself by a firing squad. The capture, trial and execution happened in less than 48 hours. Saadeh's execution took place at dawn of 8 July 1949. According to Adel Beshara, it was and still is the shortest and most secretive trial given to a political offender. His party continued to be active after his death. The President of Lebanon Camille Chamoun was supported by Saadeh's party during the 1958 Lebanon crisis. In 1961, the SSNP attempted a coup d'√©tat against President Fuad Shihab, which ended in failure. During the 1960s, party leaders were arrested and eventually the party splintered into separate factions. =Syrian Social Nationalist Party= Natural Syria\\" includes modern Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Jordan, Iraq, Kuwait, Cyprus, the Sinai Peninsula, the Ahvaz region of Iran, and the Kilikian region of Anatolia The SSNP \\"Zawbaa\\" (Vortex, Tempest) is a glyph combining the Muslim crescent and the Christian cross, derived from Mesopotamian art, and it symbolizes the blood that is shed by martyrs that makes the wheel of history whirl forward, dissipating the surrounding darkness (representing sectarianism and Ottoman occupation and the colonial oppression which followed). Within the party, Saadeh gained a cult of personality and advocated a totalitarian system of government, at the same time glorifying the pre-Christian past of the Syrian people. Saadeh was named the party leader for life. However, according to Haytham,\\"Antun Saadeh, the man, his thought, an anthology\\" Saadeh stated that European fascism didn't influence him. Haytham claims that Saadeh's Syrian Social Nationalist ideology aimed at opposite ends; in contrast to National Socialism, Social Nationalism bases itself on a dynamic social entity (which is composed of many elements, from religion to language, culture, history, need, and mainly human interaction) defining its national identity and not the imposition of one ideal identity (e.g. blond hair, blue eyes) on the many factions. Saadeh emphasized the role of philosophy and social science in the development of his social ideology. He viewed social nationalism, his version of nationalism, as a tool to transform traditional society into a dynamic and progressive one. He also opposed colonization that broke up Greater Syria into sub-states. Secularization played an important role in his ideology. Secularization is taken by him beyond the socio-political aspects of the question into its philosophical dimensions. Saadeh rejected Arab Nationalism (the idea that the speakers of the Arabic language form a single, unified nation), and argued instead for the creation of the state of United Syrian Nation or Natural Syria, encompassing the Fertile Crescent, making up a Syrian homeland that \\"extends from the Taurus range in the northwest and the Zagros mountains in the northeast to the Suez Canal and the Red Sea in the south and includes the Sinai peninsula and the Gulf of Aqaba, and from the Syrian Sea in the west (namely the eastern basin of the Mediterranean facing the Levant coastlines), including the island of Cyprus, to the arch of the Arabian Desert and the Persian Gulf in the east.\\" (Kader, H. A.). Film in Arabic about Saadeh's return to Lebanon Saadeh rejected both language and religion as defining characteristics of a nation and instead argued that nations develop through the common development of a people inhabiting a specific geographical region. He was thus a strong opponent of both Arab nationalism and Pan-Islamism. He argued that Syria was historically, culturally, and geographically distinct from the rest of the Arab world, which he divided into four parts. He traced Syrian history as a distinct entity back to the Phoenicians, Canaanites, Assyrians, Babylonians etc. and argued that Syrianism transcended religious distinctions. These claims of alleged National Socialist and Fascist ideology of his party were denied by Saadeh himself. During a 1935 speech, Saadeh said: \\"I want to use this opportunity to say that the system of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party is neither a Hitlerite nor a Fascist one, but a pure social nationalist one. It is not based on useless imitation, but is instead the result of an authentic invention ‚Äì which is a virtue of our people\\". Ideology =Philosophy= Saadeh had an holistic notion of science, as \\"knowledge is that it revolves around interaction of the self with the surrounding physical conditions\\" and was against epistemological reductionism, considering that \\"the self plays an active role in creating the conditions that transform things into objects of knowledge. This self, as a social self, is the product of several dynamics ‚Äì mind, intuition, the practical and the existential. It does not depend on one factor and exclude the others.\\" His whole thought was a refutation of the \\"individualist doctrine, whether in its sociological or methodological orientations\\". For him, man was a totality by himself as much as in connection with his immediate surrounding, a social being but with its own dignity, which brings him closer to the personalism of someone like Nikolai Berdyaev, and in his vision, the society's main role was to shape the individual being-as-relation through the Khaldunian notion of assabiya (solidarity), which, through some common features (geography, language, culture, ...) brings out the best in him, but without oppressing his individual liberties nor negligible either the spiritual or the material aspect, like he witnessed in contemporary ideologies such as communism, fascism or Nazism. Thus, \\"the concept of man-society is the axis of Sa'adeh‚Äôs theory of human existence. What is meant by this concept is that existence at a human level and existence at a social level are not independent phenomena; rather, they are one phenomenon, two aspects of the same social essence.\\"Adnan Amshi, \\"Sa'adeh‚Äôs Philosophical Doctrine\\" in Adel Beshara (ed.), Antun Sa'adeh : The Man, His Thought : an Anthology, Ithaca Press (2007), pp. 353-372 =Nationalism= He had a regionalist vision of nationalism because he gave some utmost importance to geography : even if he was not an utmost environmental determinist, he thought that a man's relation with his milieu involves a certain way of acting, because of the different climate, fauna or flora; men will manage their resources differently whether they're in mountains or desert, which will also have consequences on their interactions with foreign groups (over the control of the same resources and so on). Thus the notion of homeland was dear to him. On racialism - which was associated with nationalism in many European ideologies -, \\"he argued that, contrary to common belief, race is a purely physical concept that has nothing to do with the psychological or social differences between human communities. People differ among themselves by their physical features ‚Äì that is, colour, height, appearance ‚Äì and are accordingly divided into races. Nationalism, however, cannot be founded on this reality. Every nation is made up of diverse racial groups, and none of them is the product of one race or one specific tribe.\\"Nassif Nassar, \\"Sa'adeh and the Concept of Regional Nationalism\\" in Adel Beshara (ed.), Antun Sa'adeh : The Man, His Thought : an Anthology, Ithaca Press (2007), pp. 19-25 =The socio-economic cycle= Contrarily to Zaki al-Arsuzi and other Arab nationalists who were influenced by European thinkers' vision of race and language - notably Fichte -, Saadeh thus developed his own vision, more inclusive and synthetic. It's a \\"dynamic theory of nationalism for the whole society based on union in life and the socio- economic cycle (...) not deterministic. Land and people are two important ingredients of the nation but are not the nation themselves (...) is a civilizing theory because it recognizes the necessity and inevitability of interaction between nations (...) the interaction process has two poles: the first, economic possibilities of the environment; and the second, society‚Äôs ability to benefit from such possibilities (...) interaction takes place on two levels: horizontally, which determines the extent and character of regional interaction; and, vertically, between man and land, out of which a horizontal interaction may or may not occur (...) unlike Marxism, which reduced the economic question to one of class and considered the national question synonymous with the bourgeoisie, the concept of the socio-economic cycle is basically a societal concept (...) the mind is a primary factor in human progress. It is a liberating force and a complex entity that should not be viewed from just one angle. For Sa'adeh, the mind represents the liberation of human energy and its incorporation into the process of socio-economic interaction.\\"In'am Raad, \\"Union in Life : Sa'adeh‚Äôs Notion of the Socio- Economic Cycle\\" in Adel Beshara (ed.), Antun Sa'adeh : The Man, His Thought : an Anthology, Ithaca Press (2007), pp. 48-70 Works =Books= *Nushu' al- Umam (The Rise of Nations), Beirut : n.p., 1938. *An-Nizam al-Jadid (The Modern System), Beirut and Damascus : SSNP Publications, 1950‚Äì1956. *Al-Islam fi Risalateih (Islam in its Two Messages), Damascus : n.p., 1954. *Al-Sira' al-Fikri fial-Adab al-Suri (Intellectual Conflict in Syrian Literature), 3rd edition, Beirut : SSNP Publications, 1955. *Al-Muhadarat al-Ashr (The Ten Lectures), Beirut: SSNP Publications, 1956. *Shuruh fi al-Aqida (Commentaries on the Ideology), Beirut: SSNP Publications, 1958. *Marhalat ma Qabl al-Ta'sis (1921‚Äì1932) (The Stage Prior to the Formation [of the SSNP]), Beirut : SSNP, 1975. *Al-In'izaliyyah Aflasat (1947‚Äì1949), (Isolationism Has Gone Bankrupt), Beirut : SSNP Publications, 1976. *Mukhtarat fi al-Mas'alah al-Lubnaniyyah (1936‚Äì1943) (Selections of the Lebanese Question), Beirut : SSNP Publications, 1976. *Marahil al-Mas'alah al Filastiniyyah : 1921‚Äì1949 (The Stages of the Palestine Question), Beirut : SSNP Publications, 1977. *Al-Rasa'il (Correspondences), Beirut : SSNP Publications, 1978‚Äì1990. *Al-Athar al-Kamilah (Collected Works), Beirut : SSNP Publications, 1978‚Äì1995. *A'da al-Arab A'da Lubnan (Enemies of Arabs, Enemies of Lebanon), Beirut : SSNP Publications, 1979. *Al-Rassa'eel (Letters), Beirut : Dar Fikr for Research and Publication, 1989. *Mukhtarat fi al-Hizbiyyah al-Dinniyyah (An Anthology on Religious Partisanship), Beirut : Dar Fikr, 1993. *Al-Islam fi Risalateih al-Masihiyyah wal Muhammadiyyah (Islam in the Christian and Muhammadan Messages), 5th edition, Beirut: Al-Rukn, 1995. =Articles= *\\"The Opening of a New Way for the Syrian Nation\\", Al-Jumhur, Beirut, June 1937. *\\"Political Independence in the Key to Economic Independence\\", Souria al-Jadida (New Syria), 30 September 1939. *\\"Greater Syria\\", al-ZawbaœÄa, no. 63, 1 July 1943. *\\"Haqq al-SiraœÄ Haqq al-Taqaddum\\" (The Right to Struggle is the Right to Progress), Kull Shay', 107, Beirut, 15 April 1949.

The son of a Wesleyan Methodist minister, he qualified as a solicitor, and successfully specialised in industrial insurance. He became a member of the London County Council and then a Member of Parliament. Wood served as junior minister to Neville Chamberlain at the Ministry of Health, establishing a close personal and political alliance. His first cabinet post was Postmaster General, in which he transformed the British Post Office from a bureaucracy to a business. As Secretary of State for Air in the months before the Second World War he oversaw a huge increase in the production of warplanes to bring Britain up to parity with Germany. When Winston Churchill became Prime Minister in 1940, Wood was made Chancellor of the Exchequer, in which post he adopted policies propounded by John Maynard Keynes, changing the role of HM Treasury from custodian of government income and expenditure to steering the entire British economy. One of Wood's last innovations was the creation of Pay As You Earn, under which income tax is deducted from employees' current pay, rather than being collected retrospectively. This system remains in force in Britain. Wood died suddenly on the day on which the new system was to be announced to Parliament. Early years Wood was born in Hull, eldest of three children of the Rev. Arthur Wood, a Wesleyan Methodist minister, and his wife, Harriett Siddons, n√©e Howard.Peden, G. C. \\"Wood, Sir (Howard) Kingsley (1881‚Äì1943)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edition, May 2006. His father was appointed to be minister of Wesley's Chapel in London, where Wood grew up, attending nearby Central Foundation Boys' School.Jenkins, p. 394 He was articled to a solicitor, qualifying in 1903 with honours in his law examinations.\\"The Law Society\\", The Times, 23 May 1903, p. 5 In 1905 Wood married Agnes Lilian Fawcett (d. 1955); there were no biological children of the marriage, but the couple adopted a daughter. Wood established his own law firm in the City of London, specialising in industrial insurance law. He represented the industrial insurance companies in their negotiations with the Liberal government before the introduction of Lloyd George's National Insurance Bill in 1911, gaining valuable concessions for his clients. Wood was first elected to office as a member of the London County Council (LCC) at a by-election on 22 November 1911, representing the Borough of Woolwich for the Municipal Reform Party. His importance in the field of insurance grew over the next few years; his biographer Roy Jenkins has called him \\"the legal panjandrum of industrial insurance\\". He chaired the London Old Age Pension Authority in 1915 and the London Insurance Committee from 1917 to 1918, was a member of the National Insurance Advisory Committee from 1911 to 1919, chairman of the Faculty of Insurance from 1916 to 1919 and president of the faculty in 1920, 1922 and 1923. At the LCC he was a member of the council committees on insurance, pensions and housing. He was knighted in 1918 at the unusually early age of 36. It was not then, as it later became, the practice to state in Honours Lists the reason for the conferring of an honour,\\"New Year Honours ‚Äì The Official Lists\\", The Times, 1 January 1918, p. 7 but Jenkins writes that Wood's knighthood was essentially for his work in the insurance field. Member of Parliament Wood was elected to Parliament as a Conservative in the \\"khaki election\\" of 1918. His constituency, Woolwich West, was marginal, but he represented it for the rest of his life. Before being elected, he had attracted notice by advocating the establishment of a Ministry of Health; after the election he was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary (an unpaid ministerial assistant, a traditional first rung on the political ladder) to the first Minister of Health, Christopher Addison. After the collapse of the coalition government in 1922, Wood was offered no post in the Conservative government formed by Bonar Law. As a backbencher, Wood successfully introduced the Summer Time Bill of 1924. This measure, passed in the teeth of opposition from the agricultural lobby, provided for a permanent annual summer time period of six months from the first Sunday in April to the first Sunday in October.\\"'Summer Time' for Six Months\\", The Times, 31 January 1924, p. 14 When Baldwin succeeded Law in 1924, Wood was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health, as junior minister to Neville Chamberlain. The two served at the Ministry of Health from 11 November 1924 to 4 June 1929, becoming friends and firm political allies. They worked closely together on local government reform, including a radical updating of local taxation, the \\"rates\\", based on property values.\\"Rating Reform ‚Äì New Bill in the Commons\\", The Times, 14 May 1925, p. 16 Wood's political standing was marked by his appointment as a civil commissioner during the general strike of 1926, and, unusually for a junior minister, as a privy councillor in 1928.Jenkins, p. 395 In 1930 he was elected as the first chairman of the executive committee of the National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations. When the National Government was formed by Ramsay MacDonald in 1931, Wood was made Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education. After the general election of November 1931 he was promoted to the office of Postmaster General. The position did not entail automatic membership of the cabinet, but Wood was made a cabinet member in 1933. Cabinet office Wood served as a minister under (top) Ramsay MacDonald, Stanley Baldwin, (bottom) Neville Chamberlain and Winston Churchill As minister in charge of the General Post Office (GPO), Wood inherited an old-fashioned organisation, not equipped to meet the needs of the 1930s. In particular its management of the national telephone system, a GPO monopoly, was widely criticised. Wood considered reconstituting the whole of the GPO, changing it from a government department to what would later be called a quango, and he set up an independent committee to advise him on this. The committee recommended that the GPO should remain a department of state, but adopt a more commercial approach. Under Wood the GPO introduced reply paid arrangements for businesses,\\"Business Reply Cards ‚Äì Post Office Innovation\\", The Times, 18 February 1932, p. 9 and set up a national teleprinter service.\\"Teleprinters ‚Äì Post Office Arrangements for Lease\\", The Times, 1 March 1932, p. 13 For the telephone service, still mostly dependent on manual operators, the GPO introduced a programme of building new automated exchanges.\\"Four Exchanges in One ‚Äì New London Telephone Building Opened\\", The Times, 9 November 1932, p. 6 For the postal service, the GPO built up a large fleet of motor vehicles to speed delivery, with 3,000 vans and 1,200 motor- cycles.\\"The Post Office in 1933 ‚Äì Sir Kingsley Wood on New Projects\\", The Times, 3 January 1933, p. 15 Wood was a strong believer in publicity; he set up an advertising campaign for the telephone system which dramatically increased the number of subscribers, and he established the GPO Film Unit which gained a high aesthetic reputation as well as raising the GPO's profile.Jenkins, p. 396 Most importantly, Wood transformed the senior management of the GPO and negotiated a practical financial deal with HM Treasury. The civil service post of Secretary to the Post Office was replaced by a director general with an expert board of management. The old financial rules, by which all the GPO's surplus revenue was surrendered to the Treasury had long prevented reinvestment in the business; Wood negotiated a new arrangement under which the GPO would pay an agreed annual sum to the Treasury and keep the remainder of its revenue for investment. When MacDonald was succeeded as head of the coalition government by Baldwin in 1935, Wood was appointed Minister of Health. Despite its title, the Ministry was at that time at least as concerned with housing as with health. Under Wood, his biographer G. C. Peden writes, \\"the slum clearance programme was pursued with energy, and overcrowding was greatly reduced. There was also a marked improvement in maternal mortality, mainly due to the discovery of antibiotics able to counteract septicaemia, but also because a full-time, salaried midwifery service was created under the Midwives Act of 1936.\\" Jenkins comments that the housing boom of the 1930s was one of the two main contributories to such economic recovery as there was after the great depression. thumbrightKingsley Wood, as Secretary of State for Air, accompanied by Air Marshal Patrick Playfair visit an RAF unit in France, c.1939-1940 When Anthony Eden resigned from Chamberlain's government in March 1938, Wood moved to be Secretary of State for Air in the ensuing reshuffle. The UK was then producing 80 new warplanes a month. Within two years under Wood the figure had risen to 546 a month.Jenkins, pp. 396‚Äì397 By the outbreak of the Second World War, Britain was producing as many new warplanes as Germany. By early 1940, Wood was worn out by his efforts, and Chamberlain moved him to the non-departmental office of Lord Privy Seal, switching the incumbent, Sir Samuel Hoare, to the Air Ministry in Wood's place. Wood's job was to chair both the Home Policy Committee of the cabinet, which considered \\"all social service and other domestic questions and reviews proposals for legislation\\" and the Food Policy Committee, overseeing \\"the problems of food policy and home agriculture\\".\\"A Reshuffle of the Government ‚Äì Ministers Exchange Offices\\", The Times, 4 April 1940, p. 8 He held this position for only a few weeks; the downfall of Chamberlain affected Wood in an unexpected way. In May 1940, as a trusted friend, Wood told Chamberlain \\"affectionately but firmly\\" that after the debacle of the British defeat in Norway and the ensuing Commons debate, his position as Prime Minister was impossible and he must resign.Jenkins, p. 587 He also advised Winston Churchill to ignore pressure from those who wanted Lord Halifax, not Churchill, as Chamberlain's successor. Chamberlain agreed to resign on 9 May, but considered going back on his decision the next day as the German attack on the Western Front had begun; Wood told him that he had to go through with his resignation.Jenkins, p. 587 Both men acted on Wood's advice. Churchill became Prime Minister on 10 May 1940; Wood was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer on 12 May.\\"Names of New Ministers ‚Äì Key Posts for Opposition ‚Äì Sir K. Wood at the Exchequer\\", The Times, 13 May 1940, p. 6 HM Treasury One of the reasons for Wood's appointment to the Treasury seems to have been Churchill's urgent desire to be rid of the incumbent Chancellor, Sir John Simon, whom Churchill detested. Another may have been Wood's record of working well with politicians from other parties.Jenkins pp. 394‚Äì396 In peacetime, the Chancellor of the Exchequer is often the most important member of the cabinet after the Prime Minister, but the exigencies of the war reduced the Chancellor's precedence. The Treasury temporarily ceased to be the core department of government. In Peden's words, \\"Non-military aspects of policy, including economic policy, were co-ordinated by a cabinet committee ‚Ä¶ The Treasury's main jobs were to finance the war with as little inflation as possible, to conduct external financial policy so as to secure overseas supplies on the best possible terms, and to take part in planning for the post-war period.\\" Wood was Chancellor, as Jenkins notes, \\"for the forty key months of the Second World War\\".Jenkins, p. 393 He presented four budgets to Parliament. His first, in July 1940, passed with little notice, and brought into effect some minor changes planned by his predecessor. Of more long- lasting impact was his creation in the same month of a council of economic advisers, the most notable of whom, John Maynard Keynes, was quickly recruited as a full-time adviser at the Treasury. Jenkins detects Keynes's influence in Wood's second budget, in April 1941.Jenkins, p. 399 It brought in a top income tax rate of 19s 6d (97¬Ω pence in decimal currency) and added two million to the number of income tax payers; for the first time in Britain's history the majority of the population was liable to income tax. Keynes convinced Wood that he should abandon the orthodox Treasury doctrine that Chancellors' budgets were purely to regulate governmental revenue and expenditure; Wood, despite some misgivings on Churchill's part, adopted Keynes's conception of using national income accounting to control the economy. With the hugely increased public expenditure necessitated by the war ‚Äì it increased sixfold between 1938 and 1943 ‚Äì inflation was always a danger. Wood sought to head off inflationary wage claims by subsidising essential rationed goods, while imposing heavy taxes on goods classed as non-essential. The last change he pioneered as Chancellor was the system of Pay As You Earn (PAYE), by which income tax is deducted from current pay rather than paid retrospectively on past years' earnings.

The locomotive is 'plinthed' near a former Henry Jones IXL apple barn that is now a second hand and antique warehouse. The locomotive has a number of carriages which serve as retail outlets and a pancake cafe. Margate is also home to the Channel Heritage Centre, a museum telling the history of life in the region around the D'Entrecasteaux Channel. History In 1792 Bruni D'Entrecasteaux sailed up the channel now bearing his name, charting the coastline and naming features. He named the large bay at the top of the channel North West Bay. The expedition anchored there to collect fresh water and many aborigines were observed in the area. In January 1802, the French explorer, Nicolas Baudin anchored in the bay to collect fresh water, food and wood. An observatory was set up on a small island at the mouth of the North West Bay River to observe a solar eclipse and a number of aborigines were encountered during the expedition's stay. Baudin's two ships were forced to remain in the bay because of adverse wind conditions and didn't leave until 17 February 1802. accessed 12/01/2013 The original Margate township was along Beach Road because coal burning steamers would bring all the supplies by sea. Margate Post Office opened on 1 July 1866. and the primary school opened in 1869. From 1906-1922, the Sandfly Colliery Tramway ran from Margate Wharf to the coal mine at Kaoota.

Tarski, in \\"On the Concept of Truth in Formal Languages\\" (1935), attempted to formulate a new theory of truth in order to resolve the liar paradox. In the course of this he made several metamathematical discoveries, most notably Tarski's undefinability theorem using the same formal technique Kurt G√∂del used in his incompleteness theorems. Roughly, this states that a truth-predicate satisfying Convention T for the sentences of a given language cannot be defined within that language. Tarski's theory of truth To formulate linguistic theoriesParts of section is adapted from Kirkham, 1992. without semantic paradoxes such as the liar paradox, it is generally necessary to distinguish the language that one is talking about (the object language) from the language that one is using to do the talking (the metalanguage). In the following, quoted text is use of the object language, while unquoted text is use of the metalanguage; a quoted sentence (such as \\"P\\") is always the metalanguage's name for a sentence, such that this name is simply the sentence P rendered in the object language. In this way, the metalanguage can be used to talk about the object language; Tarski's theory of truth (Alfred Tarski 1935) demanded that the object language be contained in the metalanguage. Tarski's material adequacy condition, also known as Convention T, holds that any viable theory of truth must entail, for every sentence \\"P\\", a sentence of the following form (known as \\"form (T)\\"): (1) \\"P\\" is true if, and only if, P. For example, (2) 'snow is white' is true if and only if snow is white. These sentences (1 and 2, etc.) have come to be called the \\"T-sentences\\". The reason they look trivial is that the object language and the metalanguage are both English; here is an example where the object language is German and the metalanguage is English: (3) 'Schnee ist wei√ü' is true if and only if snow is white. It is important to note that as Tarski originally formulated it, this theory applies only to formal languages. He gave a number of reasons for not extending his theory to natural languages, including the problem that there is no systematic way of deciding whether a given sentence of a natural language is well-formed, and that a natural language is closed (that is, it can describe the semantic characteristics of its own elements). But Tarski's approach was extended by Davidson into an approach to theories of meaning for natural languages, which involves treating \\"truth\\" as a primitive, rather than a defined, concept. (See truth-conditional semantics.) Tarski developed the theory to give an inductive definition of truth as follows. For a language L containing ¬¨ (\\"not\\"), ‚àß (\\"and\\"), ‚à® (\\"or\\"), ‚àÄ (\\"for all\\"), and ‚àÉ (\\"there exists\\"), Tarski's inductive definition of truth looks like this: * (1) A primitive statement \\"A\\" is true if, and only if, A. * (2) \\"¬¨A\\" is true if, and only if, \\"A\\" is not true. * (3) \\"A‚àßB\\" is true if, and only if, \\"A\\" is true and \\"B\\" is true. * (4) \\"A‚à®B\\" is true if, and only if, \\"A\\" is true or \\"B\\" is true or (\\"A\\" is true and \\"B\\" is true). * (5) \\"‚àÄx(Fx)\\" is true if, and only if, for all objects in x; \\"Fx\\" is true. * (6) \\"‚àÉx(Fx)\\" is true if, and only if, there is an object x for which \\"Fx\\" is true. These explain how the truth conditions of complex sentences (built up from connectives and quantifiers) can be reduced to the truth conditions of their constituents. The simplest constituents are atomic sentences. A contemporary semantic definition of truth would define truth for the atomic sentences as follows: * An atomic sentence F(x1,...,xn) is true (relative to an assignment of values to the variables x1, ..., xn)) if the corresponding values of variables bear the relation expressed by the predicate F. Tarski himself defined truth for atomic sentences in a variant way that does not use any technical terms from semantics, such as the \\"expressed by\\" above. This is because he wanted to define these semantic terms in the context of truth. Therefore it would be circular to use one of them in the definition of truth itself. Tarski's semantic conception of truth plays an important role in modern logic and also in contemporary philosophy of language. It is a rather controversial point whether Tarski's semantic theory should be counted either as a correspondence theory or as a deflationary theory. Kemp, Gary. Quine versus Davidson: Truth, Reference, and Meaning. Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, 2012, p. 110. Kripke's theory of truth Kripke's theory of truth (Saul Kripke 1975) is based on partial logic (a logic of partially defined truth predicates instead of Tarski's logic of totally defined truth predicates) with the strong Kleene evaluation scheme.Axiomatic Theories of Truth (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) See also * Coherentism * T-schema * Triune continuum paradigm References  Further reading  * Simon Blackburn and Keith Simmons, eds., 1999.

Sterling called 5060 consecutive Yankees games, beginning in 1989, before taking an 8-day (4-game) break in July 2019. Early life Sterling grew up on Manhattan's Upper East Side, in the East 80s. He was the son of advertising executive Carl H.T. and Gladys (Hodrov) Sloss. According to the 1940 U.S. Census, John was one year old and living with the family in Manhattan when the census was taken on April 4. He briefly attended Moravian College, Boston University, and the Columbia University School of General Studies before leaving school to begin his career in radio at a small station in Wellsville, New York. Broadcasting career =Early career= Sterling began his broadcasting career in Baltimore, where he served as the play-by-play announcer for the then-Baltimore Bullets for the 1970‚Äì71 NBA season. He also did play-by-play for Morgan State University football, a role that he held from 1971 to 1978. Sterling came to New York broadcasting as a talk show host with WMCA in 1971. He later served as the radio voice for the WHA's New York Raiders, the WFL's New York Stars, the NHL's New York Islanders (where he was paired with Bob Lawrence), and the ABA/NBA's New York/New Jersey Nets (where he was paired mainly with Mike DeTomasso). Sterling also did a stretch with the Yankees as pre-game host on WMCA and WINS radio, as well as co-host on cable segments with Mel Allen. From 1975 through 1980, Sterling announced Nets and Islanders games for WMCA, WVNJ, WOR-TV, and SportsChannel New York, continuing his WMCA talk program until 1978. After his initial stint in New York, Sterling spent nine years in Atlanta hosting a sports call-in show on WSB radio and covering the Braves (1982‚Äì1987) and Hawks (1981‚Äì1989) for Turner Sports. =New York Yankees (1989‚Äìpresent)= In 1989, Sterling returned to New York to broadcast the games for the Yankees on WABC radio. He has been with the Yankees ever since, currently calling games on WFAN radio and its affiliates in the New York Yankees Radio Network. Since 2005, he has been paired with Suzyn Waldman; past announcing partners include: Jay Johnstone (1989‚Äì1990), Joe Angel (1991), Michael Kay (1992‚Äì2001), and Charley Steiner (2002‚Äì2004). In 2013, the Yankees announced a move to WFAN for ten years, and Sterling was retained. He is currently under contract through the 2020 season. On September 20, 2018, as part of a promotion called ‚ÄúRivalry in the Booth‚Äù, Sterling and Red Sox radio broadcaster Joe Castiglione switched places in the fourth inning. Sterling took his first days off since 1989 from July 4, 2019 until July 7, 2019. Sterling's association with the Yankees is not limited to announcing live games over the radio. He is also host of the YES Network's Yankeeography series, which produces biographies of New York Yankees. Among several nominations, Sterling has received two Emmy Awards for the series. He also hosts the introductions and recaps for Yankees Classics. In addition, Sterling has a nightly commentary feature on WCBS newscasts called \\"Sterling on Sports\\", in which he gives his take on a recent sporting event or sports news item. This commentary airs nightly during the 6:15 PM sports report. Sterling and former broadcasting partner Michael Kay commonly work together representing the Yankees. They announce the annual Yankees' Old-Timers' Day. They have presided at the \\"Key to the City\\" ceremonies following Yankee World Series victories in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2009. The pair often serve as masters of ceremonies on and off the field for major Yankee events, including the 2000 ticker-tape parade held in the Yankees' honor after their World Series win. Sterling has emceed several Yankees pre-game ceremonies including the number retirements of Jorge Posada, Andy Pettitte, Bernie Williams, Tino Martinez, Joe Torre, Derek Jeter, Mariano Rivera's number retirement in 2013 and Monument Park induction (2016), and the 20th anniversary of the Yankees' 1996 World Series victory in 2016. His long association with the Yankees has earned him the nickname \\"Pa Pinstripe\\" from New York Daily News writer Bob Raissman. =Other work= From 2013 through 2017 Sterling announced the Kitten Bowl on the Hallmark Channel. On December 16, 2018, Sterling called the Brooklyn NetsAtlanta Hawks game on the YES Network. Announcing mannerisms John Sterling broadcasting a game. Sterling has several idiosyncrasies that mark his broadcasts as distinctive, very unusual, if also divisive. In addition to a colorful vocal personality, Sterling has distinguished himself for sometimes characterizing plays differently than they may appear and for his announcing errors, habits that spark high feelings in fans and lead to comparisons with announcers like Phil Rizzuto. Following the final out of a Yankees victory, Sterling calls \\"Ballgame over! Yankees win! Theeeeeee Yankees win!\\" The length of the word \\"the\\" is held longer after dramatic victories, as well as after victories resulting in championships (which Sterling also punctuates by saying the name of whichever series is over). It has been played over the public address system at Yankee Stadium after every Yankees victory for the past several seasons, right before Frank Sinatra's cover of \\"Theme from New York, New York\\" is played. The phrase evolved from Sterling's call of Mel Hall's game-winning three-run homer in the ninth inning on May 27, 1991, to give the Yankees a dramatic Memorial Day win over the Boston Red Sox. One of his signature radio remarks is his home run call \\"It is high, it is far, it is gone!\\"Home Run Calls Sterling is known for devising a personalized home run catchphrase for every Yankee player.The Seven Types of John Sterling Home-Run Calls - The Sports Section For back to back home runs, especially homers from opposite sides of the plate, Sterling references Harry Belafonte's \\"Zombie Jamboree\\" by saying \\"it's a back to back! ... and a belly to belly!\\" In addition, sometimes before a pitch he will say \\"theeeeeee pitch\\", lengthening the word the. If a batter swings and misses, Sterling will often say \\"cuuuuut on-and-missed\\", elongating the word cut, followed by on-n-miss pronounced as one quick word. After a strikeout swinging, he says \\"STRUCK HIM OUT SWINGING!\\", and for a strikeout looking he calls \\"STRIIIIKE THREE!\\", elongating the 'I' in strike. In all cases when Sterling emphasizes the word \\"the\\", as is one of his signatures, he uses not the long ƒì (\\"thee\\") but the schwa …ô (\\"thuh\\"). Criticism Sterling is heavily criticized in the media, with over 100 websites dedicated to denigrating his style and calls. Many baseball writers and websites have ranked him the worst or close to the worst of current baseball radio announcers. Much of the criticism stems from calling balls home runs that are not home runs, mixing up fair and foul balls, and his personalized home run calls, which some people view as \\"over-the-top\\" or \\"too much\\".Too much Bronx bombast - Sports - ReviewJournal.com Regularly criticized by Craig Carton and Phil Mushnick for his inaccurate calls, Mushnick has called him a \\"dishonest, self-promoting clown\\". He has also been heavily criticized for making the call of the game more about himself than the play on the field with over the top excitement for routine plays or insignificant events. Many of his critics further accuse him of blaming someone or something else for his confusion. He has also been consistently rated one of the most biased sportcasters in the industry. The New York Times has described John Sterling as \\"frequently awful and laughable\\", often miscalling plays or not describing a play accurately ‚Äì blaming confusion on the field or other reasons. This is in despite of the fact that other announcers called the same play with almost complete accuracy for television or the opponents broadcast. The New York Daily News was also critical of Sterling's domineering of the booth, whereas most teams employ a two-man booth where duties are shared, Sterling does 100% of all play-by-play with his partner, Suzyn Waldman limited to ancillary commentary. Jim Norton of The Opie and Anthony Show routinely mocked Sterling's player nicknames and his emphasis on the \\"mmm\\" sound before saying \\"mmm-it is high, mmm-it is far. ...\\" Personal life Sterling is a resident of Edgewater, New Jersey. He had previously resided in Teaneck, New Jersey. He was divorced in 2008 after 12 years of marriage to wife, Jennifer and is the father of four, including a set of triplets, born in 2000.

Beginning on radio in the 1950s, a self-titled television series ran from 1963 to 1981. Life and career Richard Gilbert Emery was born in University College Hospital, Bloomsbury, London.GRO Register of Births: MAR 1915 1b 88 PANCRAS ‚Äì Richard G Emery, mmn = Callan His parents were the comedy double act Callan and Emery. They took him on tour when he was only 3 weeks old and gave him the occasional turn on the stage throughout his childhood, which was always on the move and disrupted, creating problems for the future, but at least setting the scene for eventually going into show business himself. His parents split up when he was 8 and he chose to stay with his mother, who gave up show business.Dick Emery: the Comedy of Errors? BBC Radio 2 29 September 2009 He tried a variety of jobs before the stage: mechanic, office boy, farm hand and driving instructor. During the Second World War he was called up to the RAF and rose to the rank of corporal. However, because of family problems, he returned to London joining the chorus line of The Merry Widow at the Majestic Theatre, London. He was recruited by Ralph Reader into the RAF Gang Show to entertain air and ground crew at bases in Great Britain. At this time he created Vera Thin (the Forces' Sweetheart), loosely based on Vera Lynn, later saying, \\"I was better in drag than combat gear\\". After D-Day, his unit toured forward airbases. On leaving the RAF, he returned to the theatre as a comedian. He worked at the Windmill Theatre, though his name does not appear on the plaque commemorating the acts that played there. He toured his fledgling act around the United Kingdom. He also auditioned for various parts and in 1952 he starred in a role in a 15-minute Radio Luxembourg series on Saturdays at 7.00pm called Chance of a Lifetime. This was a quiz sponsored by Marshall Ward in which merchandise to the value of ¬£30 was awarded to contestants. Other radio work around this time included several appearances on Workers' Playtime on the BBC, a morale-boosting show that had started during the war to entertain factory workers in their canteens. Emery also made a guest appearance on the popular BBC radio programme The Goon Show, replacing regular cast member Harry Secombe when he was absent for one episode in 1957. During 1953 he briefly formed a double act with Charlie Drake. His television debut came in 1950 on The Centre Show on the BBC. Throughout the 1950s he appeared on programmes including Round the Bend (BBC, 1955‚Äì56) and Educating Archie (ITV, 1958‚Äì59) and appeared with his friend Tony Hancock in several episodes of The Tony Hancock Show (ITV, 1956) and Hancock's Half Hour (BBC, 1957). He enhanced his reputation on two series with former Goon Michael Bentine: After Hours (ITV, 1958‚Äì59) and It's a Square World (BBC, 1960‚Äì64). His role as Private Chubby Catchpole in the final series of The Army Game (ITV 1960) led to an exclusive BBC contract, and the long-running The Dick Emery Show (BBC, 1963‚Äì81) began. The show involved Emery dressing up as various characters, \\"a flamboyant cast of comic grotesques\\". These included the buck- toothed Church of England vicar, sex-starved, menopausal, man-eating spinster Hetty, and Clarence, an outrageously camp man who coined the catchphrase \\"Hello Honky Tonks\\". Other roles were gormless denim-clad bovver boy Gaylord (in a double act with his long suffering father, played by several actors including Roy Kinnear) where, each week, he would mess up and utter the catchphrase \\"Dad, I fink I got it wrong again\\", the crusty pensioner James Maynard Kitchener Lampwick, College (a genteel tramp whose real name was Lancelot Orpington Penrose) and Mandy, a busty peroxide blonde whose catchphrase, \\"Ooh, you are awful ... but I like you!\\" (given in response to a seemingly innocent remark made by her interviewer, played by Gordon Clyde, but perceived by her as ribald double entendre), preceded a hefty shove on the shoulder of the interviewer, and a prompt about-turn walk-off with a trip. Michael Grade said of it, \\"It was clever, pure vaudeville, in a television form.\\" In a sporadic film career he made his debut in the Goons' The Case of the Mukkinese Battle Horn (directed by Joseph Sterling, 1954). He also played bungling bank robber Booky Binns in The Big Job (directed by Gerald Thomas, 1965) and was known for vocal talents as an array of characters including \\"The Nowhere Man\\" Jeremy Hillary Boob, the Mayor of Pepperland and Max, one of the Blue Meanies in the Beatles' Yellow Submarine (directed by George Dunning, 1968) Emery appeared in films including as Shingler in The Fast Lady (1962), as Peter Sellers's neighbour in The Wrong Arm Of The Law, as Harry in Baby Love (1968), as Mr Bateman in Loot (1970) and Ooh‚Ä¶ You Are Awful (1972), in which he played many of the characters he had portrayed in his TV series. The plot of this comedy centred on Emery hunting down a bank account number. The digits of the number are tattooed on the bottoms of four young women. Emery has to see the girls naked, which requires disguises. One of the women is played by Liza Goddard. Emery also recorded several novelty records during his career, most notably \\"If You Love Her\\" which reached number 32 in 1969, and \\"You Are Awful\\" which just missed the top 40 in 1973. Other singles included \\"A Cockney Christmas\\" (1962), \\"You're The Only One\\" (1974) and \\"Rocking Horse Cowboy\\" (1979). In 1979, Emery moved to ITV for three one-hour specials before returning to the BBC in 1980 and resuming The Dick Emery Show. By 1982, Emery was tiring of the format for his BBC series and wanted to do something different. Using a new format and character, Jewish private detective Bernie Weinstock, Emery had a new outlet ‚Äì two series of comedy thrillers under the banner Emery Presents (BBC, 1982‚Äì83), Legacy of MurderLegacy of Murder, IMDb page and Jack of Diamonds.Jack of Diamonds, IMDb page Personal life Emery had a very difficult childhood initially, but following the departure of his father Laurie Howe, things settled down. He was devoted to his mother for most of his life and helped support her once he was able to work. This devotion could and did cause problems in his marriages. He was very keen on \\"long legs and blondes\\" and was often in the newspapers with beautiful women. He was in six long-term relationships, marrying five times, and also had numerous affairs throughout his life. At the beginning of the Second World War he married Joan (sometimes known as Zelda) Sainsbury and had one son, Gilbert Richard. After the failure of that marriage, he wed Irene (Pip) Ansell but the marriage barely lasted six months. While working in summer season in 1950, at the Winter Gardens in Ventnor on the Isle of Wight, he met Iris Margaret Tully who was also in the show. At the end of the season, they returned to London and set up home together in Iris's flat in Shaftesbury Avenue. Iris changed her name to Emery by deed poll until 1955, a year after she had given birth to his second son, Nicholas William. She and Emery married in 1955. The marriage was a rocky one because Emery had several affairs while away on tour. He met the woman who became his fourth wife, Victoria Chambers, in the mid-1950s. He was torn between the two women, but in late 1958 he left Iris and moved to Thames Ditton in Surrey to set up home. In 1960, however, he returned to Iris and his son and moved them to Thames Ditton, but he could never settle, and in 1962 he left Iris for Victoria. Iris divorced him in 1964. By this time, he had set up home in Esher. Vickie bore him a son Michael and a daughter Eliza. His last wife was Josephine BlakeDick Emery: the Comedy of Errors?, BBC Radio 2, 29 September 2009 to whom he was still married at the time of his death, although he had left her to live with Fay Hillier, a showgirl, 30 years his junior. Outside show business, he enjoyed flying, and held a pilot's licence from 1961 onwards. He also liked fast cars and motorcycles. He was a keen maker of scale models, and was president of the Airfix Modellers' Club. He also wrote a review feature for Meccano Magazine during 1971. While the public took him to heart, voting him BBC TV Personality of the Year in 1972, Emery suffered from severe stage fright and low self-esteem. He underwent psychoanalysis and hypnosis, and took sedatives to try to cure the problems. He had four children: Gilbert, Nicholas, Michael and Eliza, and was the half- brother of actress Ann Emery. Death In December 1982, Emery was rushed to a London hospital with severe chest pains. He died at the hospital from cardiorespiratory failure on 2 January 1983 at the age of 67.GRO Register of Deaths: MAR 1983 14 0006 LAMBETH ‚Äì Richard Gilbert Emery, DoB = 19 February 1915 Selected filmography Film * The Case of the Mukkinese Battle Horn (short) (1956) ‚Äì Mr. Nodule / Mr.Crimp / Maurice Ponke * Follow a Star (1959) ‚Äì Inebriated Party Guest (uncredited) * Light Up the Sky!

Background It was a military operation planned by Captain Eugenio Daza of the Philippine Republican Army, Area Commander of General Manuel Lukban's forces for Southeastern Samar, that took place in Balangiga in 1901 during the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. The attack was led by Valeriano Abanador the Jefe de la Polic√≠a (Chief of Police).Tucker, Spencer (2009). The Encyclopedia of the Spanish-American and Philippine-American Wars: A Political, Social, and Military History. ABC-CLIO. pp. 345. . On September 28, 1901 =The Battle= The Battle of Balangiga took place in the town of Balangiga on Samar Island on September 28, 1901 wherein 48 members of the US 9th Infantry were ambushed by irregular forces made up of the Chief of Police, local police officers, local government officials, villagers, and augmented by soldiers of the Philippine Republican Army.Anderson, B. (2006). Under Three Flags: Anarchism and the Anti-Colonial Imagination. New York: Verso Books. =Aftermath= This battle was described as the \\"worst defeat of United States Army soldiers since the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876\\". =Legacy= The attack and the subsequent retaliation remains one of the longest-running and most controversial issues between the Philippines and the United States. Conflicting records from American and Philippine historians have confused the issue. According to the famous Philippine historian Teodoro Agoncillo:, \\"In their desperation, the American soldiers turned arsonists burning whole towns in order to force guerrillas to the open. One such infamous case occurred in the town of Balangiga, Samar, in 1901-1902.\\" > \\"The true \\"Balangiga massacre\\" was the subsequent retaliation against the > Samar population and guerrillas when American soldiers burned whole towns > during the March across Samar.\\" Prelude Soldiers of Company C, 9th US Infantry Regiment with Valeriano Abanador (standing, sixth from right) in Balangiga in August 1901. In the summer of 1901, Brigadier General Robert P. Hughes, who commanded the Department of the Visayas and was responsible for Samar, instigated an aggressive policy of food deprivation and property destruction on the island. The objective was to force the end of Philippine resistance. Part of his strategy was to close three key ports on the southern coast, Basey, Balangiga and Guiuan. Samar was a major centre for the production of Manila hemp, the trade of which was financing Philippine forces on the island. At the same time United States interests were eager to secure control of the hemp trade, which was a vital material both for the United States Navy and American agro- industries such as cotton. On August 11, 1901, Company C of the 9th U.S. Infantry Regiment, arrived in Balangiga‚Äîthe third largest town on the southern coast of Samar island‚Äîto close its port and prevent supplies reaching Philippine forces in the interior, which at that time were under the command of General Vicente Lukb√°n. Lukb√°n had been sent there in December 1898 to govern the island on behalf of the First Philippine Republic under Emilio Aguinaldo. In late May of 1901, prior to the stationing of any Americans in Balangiga, town mayor Pedro Abayan had written to Lukban pledging to \\"observe a deceptive policy with [Americans] doing whatever they may like, and when a favorable opportunity arises, the people will strategically rise against them.\\"As quoted in (citing ) Relations between the soldiers and the townspeople were amicable for the first month of the American presence in the town; indeed it was marked by extensive fraternization between the two parties. This took the form of tuba (palm wine) drinking among the soldiers and male villagers, baseball games and arnis demonstrations. However, tensions rose due to several reasons: Captain Thomas W. Connell, commanding officer of the American unit in Balangiga, ordered the town cleaned up in preparation for a visit by the U.S. Army's inspector-general. However, in complying with his directive, the townspeople inadvertently cut down vegetation with food value, in violation of Lukb√°n's policies regarding food security. As a consequence, on September 18, 1901, around 400 guerrillas sent by Lukb√°n appeared in the vicinity of Balangiga. They were to mete sanctions upon the town officials and local residents for violating Lukb√°n's orders regarding food security and for fraternizing with the Americans. The threat was probably defused by Captain Eugenio Daza, a member of Lukb√°n's staff, and by the parish priest, Father Donato Guimbaolibot. A few days later, Connell had the town's male residents rounded up and detained for the purpose of hastening his clean-up operations. Around 80 men were kept in two Sibley tents unfed overnight. In addition, Connell had the men's bolos and the stored rice for their tables confiscated. These events would have sufficiently insulted and angered the townspeople; and without the sympathy of Lukb√°n's guerrillas, the civilians were left to their own devices to plan their course of action against the Americans. A few days before the attack, Valeriano Abanador, the town's police chief, and Captain Daza met to plan the attack on the American unit. To address the issue of sufficient manpower to offset the Americans' advantage in firepower, Abanador and Daza disguised the congregation of men as a work force aimed at preparing the town for a local fiesta, which incidentally, also served to address Connell's preparations for his superior's visit. Abanador also brought in a group of \\"tax evaders\\" to bolster their numbers. Much palm wine was brought in to ensure that the American soldiers would be drunk the day after the fiesta. Hours before the attack, women and children were sent away to safety. To mask the disappearance of the women from the dawn service in the church, 34 men from Barrio Lawaan cross-dressed as women worshippers. These \\"women\\", carrying small coffins, were challenged by Sergeant Scharer of the sentry post about the town plaza near the church. Opening one of the coffins with his bayonet, he saw the body of a dead child who, he was told, was a victim of a cholera epidemic. Abashed, he let the women pass on. Unbeknownst to the sentries, the other coffins hid the bolos and other weapons of the attackers. The issue of children's bodies merits further attention since there is much conflict between accounts by members of Company C. That day, the 27th, was the 52nd anniversary of the founding of the parish, an occasion on which an image of a recumbent Christ known as a Santo Entierro would have been carried around the parish. In modern times these Santo Entierros are enclosed in a glass case but at the time were commonly enclosed in a wooden box. Attack on American soldiers The US 9th Infantry Regiment in the Philippines, 1899 Between 6:20 and 6:45 in the morning of September 28, 1901, the villagers made their move. Abanador, who had been supervising the prisoners' communal labor in the town plaza, grabbed the rifle of Private Adolph Gamlin, one of the American sentries, and stunned him with a blow to the head. This served as the signal for the rest of the communal laborers in the plaza to rush the other sentries and soldiers of Company C, who were mostly having breakfast in the mess area. Abanador then gave a shout, signaling the other Philippine men to the attack and fired Gamlin's rifle at the mess tent, hitting one of the soldiers. The pealing of the church bells and the sounds from conch shells being blown followed seconds later. Some of the Company C troopers were attacked and hacked to death before they could grab their rifles; the few who survived the initial onslaught fought almost bare-handed, using kitchen utensils, steak knives, and chairs. One private used a baseball bat to fend off the attackers before being overwhelmed. The men detained in the Sibley tents broke out and made their way to the municipal hall. Simultaneously, the attackers hidden in the church broke into the parish house and killed the three American officers there. An unarmed Company C soldier was ignored, as was Captain Connell's Philippine houseboy. The attackers initially occupied the parish house and the municipal hall; however, the attack at the mess tents and the barracks failed, with Pvt. Gamlin, recovering consciousness and managing to secure another rifle, caused considerable casualties among the Philippine forces. With the initial surprise wearing off and the attack degrading, Abanador called for the attackers to break off and retreat. The surviving Company C soldiers, led by Sergeant Frank Betron, escaped by sea to Basey and Tanauan, Leyte. The townspeople buried their dead and abandoned the town. Of the 74 men in Company C, 36 were killed in action, including all its commissioned officers: Captain Thomas W. Connell, First Lieutenant Edward A. Bumpus and Major Richard S. Griswold. Twenty-two were wounded in action and four were missing in action. Eight died later of wounds received in combat; only four escaped unscathed.The Official report War Department 1901 reports casualties as 3 officers and 33 NCOs and enlisted ranks dead; 3 died of wounds; 7 members of Company C 9th Infantry and 1 Hospital Corps Private missing [the report acknowledges several bodies were cremated when the barracks were burned]; 21 wounded; 16 present not wounded. See Annual Reports of the War Department, Volume 9 p.629 Report of Captain Bookmiller, 9th Infantry The villagers captured about 100 rifles and 25,000 rounds of ammunition and suffered 28 dead and 22 wounded. Retaliation General Jacob H. Smith's infamous order \\"Kill Everyone Over Ten\\" was the caption in the New York Journal cartoon on May 5, 1902. The Old Glory draped an American shield on which a vulture replaced the bald eagle. The caption at the bottom proclaimed, \\"Criminals Because They Were Born Ten Years Before We Took the Philippines\\" Captain Edwin Victor Bookmiller, the commander in Basey, sailed immediately with Company G, 9th Infantry Regiment for Balangiga aboard a commandeered coastal steamer, the SS Pittsburgh. Finding the town abandoned, they buried the American dead and set fire to the town. Coming at a time when it was believed Filipino resistance to American rule had collapsed, the Balangiga attack had a powerful impact on Americans living in Manila. Men started to wear sidearms openly and Helen Herron Taft, wife of the American Governor-General of the Philippines William Howard Taft, was so distraught she required evacuation to Hong Kong.Taft, Helen Herron, Recollections of Full Years, Butterick Publishing, New York (1914), p. 225 The Balangiga incident provoked shock in the US public, too, with newspapers equating the massacre to George Armstrong Custer's last stand at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876. Major General Adna R. Chaffee, military governor of the Philippines, received orders from US President Theodore Roosevelt to pacify Samar. To this end, Chaffee appointed Brigadier General Jacob H. Smith to Samar to accomplish the task. General Smith instructed Major Littleton Waller, commanding officer of a battalion of 315 US Marines assigned to bolster his forces in Samar, regarding the conduct of pacification: As a consequence of this order, Smith became known as \\"Howling Wilderness Smith\\"; he was also dubbed \\"Hell Roaring Jake\\" Smith, \\"The Monster\\", and \\"Howling Jake\\" by the press as a result. He further ordered Waller to kill all persons who were capable of bearing arms and in actual hostilities against the United States forces. When queried by Waller regarding the age limit of these persons, Smith replied that the limit was ten years of age. Food and trade to Samar were cut off, intended to starve the revolutionaries into submission. Smith's strategy on Samar involved widespread destruction to force the inhabitants to stop supporting the guerrillas and turn to the Americans from fear and starvation. He used his troops in sweeps of the interior in search for guerrilla bands and in attempts to capture Philippine General Vicente Lukb√°n, but he did nothing to prevent contact between the guerrillas and the townspeople. American columns marched across the island, destroying homes and shooting people and draft animals. Littleton Waller, in a report, stated that over an eleven-day period his men burned 255 dwellings, shot 13 carabaos and killed 39 people. The Judge Advocate General of the Army observed that only the good sense and restraint of the majority of Smith's subordinates prevented a complete reign of terror in Samar. The abuses outraged anti-Imperialist groups in the United States when these became known in March 1902. The exact number of Filipinos killed by US troops will never be known. A population shortfall of about 15,000 is apparent between the Spanish census of 1887 and the American census of 1903 but how much of the shortfall is due to a disease epidemic and known natural disasters and how many due to combat is difficult to determine. Population growth in 19th century Samar was amplified by an influx of workers for the booming hemp industry, an influx which certainly ceased during the Samar campaign. Exhaustive research in the 1990s made by British writer Bob Couttie as part of a ten-year study of the Balangiga massacre tentatively put the figure at about 2,500; David Fritz used population ageing techniques and suggested a figure of a little more than 2,000 losses in males of combat age but nothing to support widespread killing of women and children Fritz, David L, Before \\"The Howling Wilderness\\": The Military Career of Jacob Heard Smith, Military Affairs, November‚ÄìDecember (1979), p. 186 Some American and Filipino historians believe it to be around 50,000.Young, Kenneth Ray, \\"Guerrilla Warfare Revisited\\", Leyte Samar Studies, XI:1 (1977), pp. 21‚Äì31 The rate of Samar's population growth slowed as refugees fled from Samar to Leyte,US Senate Committee Hearings \\"Affairs in the Philippine Islands\\" February 3, 1902, Vol. 3, p. 2341 yet still the population of Samar increased by 21,456 during the war. American military historians' opinions on the Samar campaign are echoed in the February 2011 edition of the US Army's official historical magazine, Army History Bulletin: \\"...the indiscriminate violence and punishment that U.S. Army and Marine forces under Brig. Gen. Jacob Smith are alleged to have unleashed on Samar have long stained the memory of the United States‚Äô pacification of the Philippine Islands\\".Hendricks, Charles, Editor's Journal, Army History Bulletin, PB 20-11-2 (No. 79), p. 2 Commanding officers' courts-martial American soldiers in Calbayog, Samar pose with a church bell taken from Balangiga as war trophy. Events in Samar resulted in prompt investigations. On April 15, 1902 the Secretary of War Elihu Root sent orders to relieve officers of duty and to court-martial General Smith. \\"The President (Theodore Roosevelt) desires to know and in the most circumstantial manner all facts, nothing being concealed, and no man being for any reason favored or shielded. For the very reason that the President intends to back up the Army in the heartiest fashion in every lawful and legitimate method of doing its work, he also intends to see that the most rigorous care is exercised to detect and prevent any cruelty or brutality, and that men who are guilty thereof are punished\\".\\"Affairs in the Philippine Islands\\", Vol. II, p. 1549 Jacob H. Smith and Littleton Waller faced courts martial as a result of their heavy-handed treatment of Filipinos; Waller specifically for the execution of twelve Filipino bearers and guides. Waller was found not guilty, a finding that senior military officials did not accept. Smith was found guilty, admonished and forced to retire. A third officer, Captain Edwin Glenn, was court-martialled for torturing Filipinos and was found guilty. Factual disputes Several factual inaccuracies in early published accounts have surfaced over the years as historians continue to re- investigate the Balangiga incident. These include: *Schott and Rey Imperial assert that Company C of the 9th US Infantry was sent to Balangiga in response to a request by its then-Mayor Pedro Abayan. This is based solely on a claim by George Meyer, a Company C survivor, in support of efforts to secure the Medal of Honor. Author Bob Couttie asserts that the American unit was sent there to close Balangiga's port. *James Taylor's account inspired another author, William T. Sexton, to write that the American soldiers were \\"butchered like hogs\\" in Soldiers in the Sun. However, Eugenio Daza wrote, \\"The Filipino believes that the profanation of the dead necessarily brings bad luck and misfortune ... there was no time to lose for such acts [after the Balangiga attack].\\" Gallery File:Balangiga Massacre Monument.jpgBattle of Balangiga monument Balangiga massacre memorial marker.JPGBattle of Balangiga memorial marker Statue of Valeriano Abanador.JPGStatue of Valeriano Abanador, Balangiga police chief during the Battle of Balangiga Historical marker at the foot of Valeriano Abanador statue.JPGHistorical marker at the foot of Abanador statue See also *Balangiga bells, on the bells seized as spoils of war and returned to the Philippines in 2018 *Eugenio Daza *Vicente Lukban *History of the Philippines (1898‚Äì1946) *Timeline of the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War *Campaigns of the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War Notes References Further * *, (e-book) * 1901 in the Philippines Battles involving the United States Battles of the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War Events that led to courts-martial History of Eastern Samar Massacres committed by the United States September 1901 events Visayan history War crimes in the Philippines ","title":"Battle of Balangiga"},{"id":"601263","text":", better known by the stage name of , is a Japanese actress, voice actress, singer and narrator.

He was one of the most prolific mathematicians and producers of mathematical conjectures of the 20th century. He was known both for his social practice of mathematics (he engaged more than 500 collaborators) and for his eccentric lifestyle (Time magazine called him The Oddball's Oddball). He devoted his waking hours to mathematics, even into his later years‚Äîindeed, his death came only hours after he solved a geometry problem at a conference in Warsaw. pursued and proposed problems in discrete mathematics, graph theory, number theory, mathematical analysis, approximation theory, set theory, and probability theory. Much of his work centered around discrete mathematics, cracking many previously unsolved problems in the field. He championed and contributed to Ramsey theory, which studies the conditions in which order necessarily appears. Overall, his work leaned towards solving previously open problems, rather than developing or exploring new areas of mathematics. Erd≈ës published around 1,500 mathematical papers during his lifetime, a figure that remains unsurpassed.According to , using the Mathematical Reviews data base, the next highest article count is roughly 823. He firmly believed mathematics to be a social activity, living an itinerant lifestyle with the sole purpose of writing mathematical papers with other mathematicians. Erd≈ës's prolific output with co-authors prompted the creation of the Erd≈ës number, the number of steps in the shortest path between a mathematician and Erd≈ës in terms of co-authorships. Life Paul Erd≈ës was born in Budapest, Austria-Hungary, on 26 March 1913. He was the only surviving child of Anna (n√©e Wilhelm) and Lajos Erd≈ës (born as Lajos Engl√§nder). His two sisters, aged 3 and 5, both died of scarlet fever a few days before he was born. His parents were both Jewish mathematics teachers. His fascination with mathematics developed early‚Äîhe was often left home by himself because his father was held captive in Siberia as an Austro-Hungarian POW during 1914‚Äì1920, causing his mother to have to work long hours to support their household. He taught himself to read through mathematics texts that his parents left around in their home. By the age of four, given a person's age, he could calculate in his head how many seconds they had lived.Hoffman, p. 66. Due to his sisters' deaths, he had a close relationship with his mother, with the two of them reportedly sharing the same bed until he left for college. Erd≈ës entered the University of Budapest at the age of 17. By the time he was 20, he had found a proof for Chebyshev's theorem. In 1934, at the age of 21, he was awarded a doctorate in mathematics. Erd≈ës's thesis advisor was Lip√≥t Fej√©r, who was also the thesis advisor for John von Neumann, George P√≥lya, and Paul (P√°l) Tur√°n. Because he was Jewish, Erd≈ës decided Hungary was dangerous and relocated to the United States. Many members of Erd≈ës' family, including two of his aunts, two of his uncles, and his father, died in Budapest during the Holocaust. His mother survived in hiding. He was living in America and working at the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study at the time. Described by his biographer, Paul Hoffman, as \\"probably the most eccentric mathematician in the world,\\" Erd≈ës spent most of his adult life living out of a suitcase. Except for some years in the 1950s, when he was not allowed to enter the United States based on the pretense that he was a Communist sympathizer, his life was a continuous series of going from one meeting or seminar to another. During his visits, Erd≈ës expected his hosts to lodge him, feed him, and do his laundry, along with anything else he needed, as well as arrange for him to get to his next destination. On 20 September 1996, at the age of 83, he had a heart attack and died while attending a conference in Warsaw. These circumstances were close to the way he wanted to die. He once said, Erd≈ës never married and had no children. He is buried next to his mother and father in grave 17A-6-29 at Kozma Street Cemetery in Budapest. For his epitaph, he suggested \\"I've finally stopped getting dumber.\\" (Hungarian: \\"V√©gre nem butulok tov√°bb\\").Hoffman, p. 3. His life was documented in the film N is a Number: A Portrait of Paul Erd≈ës, made while he was still alive, and posthumously in the book The Man Who Loved Only Numbers (1998). Erd≈ës' name contains the Hungarian letter \\"≈ë\\" (\\"o\\" with double acute accent), but is often incorrectly written as Erdos or Erd√∂s either \\"by mistake or out of typographical necessity\\".The full quote is \\"Note the pair of long accents on the \\"≈ë,\\" often (even in Erdos's own papers) by mistake or out of typographical necessity replaced by \\"√∂,\\" the more familiar German umlaut which also exists in Hungarian.\\", from Personality Possessions meant little to Erd≈ës; most of his belongings would fit in a suitcase, as dictated by his itinerant lifestyle. Awards and other earnings were generally donated to people in need and various worthy causes. He spent most of his life traveling between scientific conferences, universities and the homes of colleagues all over the world. He earned enough in stipends from universities as a guest lecturer, and from various mathematical awards, to fund his travels and basic needs; money left over he used to fund cash prizes for proofs of \\"Erd≈ës problems\\" (see below). He would typically show up at a colleague's doorstep and announce \\"my brain is open\\", staying long enough to collaborate on a few papers before moving on a few days later. In many cases, he would ask the current collaborator about whom to visit next. His colleague Alfr√©d R√©nyi said, \\"a mathematician is a machine for turning coffee into theorems\\",Biography of Alfr√©d R√©nyi by J.J. O'Connor and E.F. Robertson and Erd≈ës drank copious quantities (this quotation is often attributed incorrectly to Erd≈ës, but Erd≈ës himself ascribed it to R√©nyi). After 1971 he also took stimulants, despite the concern of his friends, one of whom (Ron Graham) bet him $500 that he could not stop taking them for a month.Hill, J. Paul Erdos, Mathematical Genius, Human (In That Order) Erd≈ës won the bet, but complained that during his abstinence, mathematics had been set back by a month: \\"Before, when I looked at a piece of blank paper my mind was filled with ideas. Now all I see is a blank piece of paper.\\" After he won the bet, he promptly resumed his use of Ritalin and Benzedrine. He had his own idiosyncratic vocabulary: although an agnostic atheist, he spoke of \\"The Book\\", a visualization of a book in which God had written down the best and most elegant proofs for mathematical theorems. Lecturing in 1985 he said, \\"You don't have to believe in God, but you should believe in The Book.\\" He himself doubted the existence of God, whom he called the \\"Supreme Fascist\\" (SF). He accused SF of hiding his socks and Hungarian passports, and of keeping the most elegant mathematical proofs to Himself. When he saw a particularly beautiful mathematical proof he would exclaim, \\"This one's from The Book!\\" This later inspired a book titled Proofs from the Book. Other idiosyncratic elements of Erd≈ës's vocabulary include:Hoffman, chapter 1. As included with The New York Times review of the book. * Children were referred to as \\"epsilons\\" (because in mathematics, particularly calculus, an arbitrarily small positive quantity is commonly denoted by the Greek letter (Œµ)). * Women were \\"bosses\\" who \\"captured\\" men as \\"slaves\\" by marrying them. Divorced men were \\"liberated\\". * People who stopped doing mathematics had \\"died\\", while people who died had \\"left\\". * Alcoholic drinks were \\"poison\\". * Music (except classical music) was \\"noise\\". * To be considered a hack was to be a \\"Newton\\". * To give a mathematical lecture was \\"to preach\\". * To give an oral exam to students was \\"to torture\\" them. He gave nicknames to many countries, examples being: the U.S. was \\"samland\\" (after Uncle Sam), the Soviet Union was \\"joedom\\" (after Joseph Stalin), and Israel was \\"\\". Career In 1934, he moved to Manchester, England, to be a guest lecturer. In 1938, he accepted his first American position as a scholarship holder at Princeton University. At this time, he began to develop the habit of traveling from campus to campus. He would not stay long in one place and traveled back and forth among mathematical institutions until his death. In 1954, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services denied Erd≈ës, a Hungarian citizen, a re-entry visa into the United States, for reasons that have never been fully explained. Teaching at the University of Notre Dame at the time, Erd≈ës could have chosen to remain in the country. Instead, he packed up and left, albeit requesting reconsideration from the U.S. Immigration Services at periodic intervals. Counter-clockwise from left: Erd≈ës, Fan Chung, and her husband Ronald Graham, Japan 1986 Hungary at the time was under the Warsaw Pact with the Soviet Union. Although Hungary limited the freedom of its own citizens to enter and exit the country, it gave Erd≈ës the exclusive privilege of being allowed to enter and exit the country as he pleased in 1956. In 1963, the U.S. Immigration Service granted Erd≈ës a visa, and he resumed including American universities in his teaching and travels. Ten years later, in 1973, the 60-year-old Erd≈ës voluntarily left Hungary. During the last decades of his life, Erd≈ës received at least fifteen honorary doctorates. He became a member of the scientific academies of eight countries, including the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and the UK Royal Society. He became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1977. Shortly before his death, he renounced his honorary degree from the University of Waterloo over what he considered to be unfair treatment of colleague Adrian Bondy.Transcription of October 2, 1996, article from University of Waterloo Gazette (archive) =Mathematical work= Erd≈ës was one of the most prolific publishers of papers in mathematical history, comparable only with Leonhard Euler; Erd≈ës published more papers, mostly in collaboration with other mathematicians, while Euler published more pages, mostly by himself.Hoffman, p. 42. Erd≈ës wrote around 1,525 mathematical articles in his lifetime, mostly with co-authors. He strongly believed in and practiced mathematics as a social activity, having 511 different collaborators in his lifetime. In his mathematical style, Erd≈ës was much more of a \\"problem solver\\" than a \\"theory developer\\" (see \\"The Two Cultures of Mathematics\\" by Timothy Gowers for an in- depth discussion of the two styles, and why problem solvers are perhaps less appreciated). Joel Spencer states that \\"his place in the 20th-century mathematical pantheon is a matter of some controversy because he resolutely concentrated on particular theorems and conjectures throughout his illustrious career.\\" This article is a review of Mathematics: Frontiers and Perspectives Erd≈ës never won the highest mathematical prize, the Fields Medal, nor did he coauthor a paper with anyone who did, a pattern that extends to other prizes.From \\"trails to Erdos\\" , by DeCastro and Grossman, in The Mathematical Intelligencer, vol. 21, no. 3 (Summer 1999), 51‚Äì63: A careful reading of Table 3 shows that although Erdos never wrote jointly with any of the 42 [Fields] medalists (a fact perhaps worthy of further contemplation)... there are many other important international awards for mathematicians. Perhaps the three most renowned...are the Rolf Nevanlinna Prize, the Wolf Prize in Mathematics, and the Leroy P. Steele Prizes. ... Again, one may wonder why KAPLANSKY is the only recipient of any of these prizes who collaborated with Paul Erd√∂s. (After this paper was written, collaborator Lov√°sz received the Wolf prize, making 2 in all). He did win the Wolf Prize, where his contribution is described as \\"for his numerous contributions to number theory, combinatorics, probability, set theory and mathematical analysis, and for personally stimulating mathematicians the world over\\". In contrast, the works of the three winners after were recognized as \\"outstanding\\", \\"classic\\", and \\"profound\\", and the three before as \\"fundamental\\" or \\"seminal\\". Of his contributions, the development of Ramsey theory and the application of the probabilistic method especially stand out. Extremal combinatorics owes to him a whole approach, derived in part from the tradition of analytic number theory. Erd≈ës found a proof for Bertrand's postulate which proved to be far neater than Chebyshev's original one. He also discovered the first elementary proof for the prime number theorem, along with Atle Selberg. However, the circumstances leading up to the proofs, as well as publication disagreements, led to a bitter dispute between Erd≈ës and Selberg. Erd≈ës also contributed to fields in which he had little real interest, such as topology, where he is credited as the first person to give an example of a totally disconnected topological space that is not zero-dimensional, the Erd≈ës space. =Erd≈ës' problems= Erd≈ës influenced many young mathematicians. In this 1985 photo taken at the University of Adelaide, Erd≈ës explains a problem to Terence Tao‚Äîwho was 10 years old at the time. Tao received the Fields Medal in 2006, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 2007. Throughout his career, Erd≈ës would offer payments for solutions to unresolved problems. These ranged from $25 for problems that he felt were just out of the reach of the current mathematical thinking (both his and others), to several thousand dollars for problems that were both difficult to attack and mathematically significant. There are thought to be at least a thousand remaining unsolved problems, though there is no official or comprehensive list. The offers remained active despite Erd≈ës's death; Ronald Graham was the (informal) administrator of solutions, and a solver could receive either an original check signed by Erd≈ës before his death (for memento only, cannot be cashed) or a cashable check from Graham. Perhaps the most mathematically notable of these problems is the Erd≈ës conjecture on arithmetic progressions: If true, it would solve several other open problems in number theory (although one main implication of the conjecture, that the prime numbers contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions, has since been proved independently as the Green‚ÄìTao theorem). The payment for the solution of the problem is currently worth US$5,000.p. 354, Soifer, Alexander (2008); The Mathematical Coloring Book: Mathematics of Coloring and the Colorful Life of its Creators; New York: Springer. The most familiar problem with an Erd≈ës prize is likely the Collatz conjecture, also called the 3N + 1 problem. Erd≈ës offered $500 for a solution. =Collaborators= His most frequent collaborators include Hungarian mathematicians Andr√°s S√°rk√∂zy (62 papers) and Andr√°s Hajnal (56 papers), and American mathematician Ralph Faudree (50 papers). Other frequent collaborators were the following:List of collaborators of Erd≈ës by number of joint papers , from the Erd≈ës number project website. * Richard Schelp (42 papers) * C. C.

Erd≈ës number Because of his prolific output, friends created the Erd≈ës number as a tribute. An Erd≈ës number describes a person's degree of separation from Erd≈ës himself, based on their collaboration with him, or with another who has their own Erd≈ës number. Erd≈ës alone was assigned the Erd≈ës number of 0 (for being himself), while his immediate collaborators could claim an Erd≈ës number of 1, their collaborators have Erd≈ës number at most 2, and so on. Approximately 200,000 mathematicians have an assigned Erd≈ës number, and some have estimated that 90 percent of the world's active mathematicians have an Erd≈ës number smaller than 8 (not surprising in light of the small world phenomenon). Due to collaborations with mathematicians, many scientists in fields such as physics, engineering, biology, and economics have Erd≈ës numbers as well. Several studies have shown that leading mathematicians tend to have particularly low Erd≈ës numbers. Original Spanish version in Rev. Acad. Colombiana Cienc. Exact. F√≠s. Natur. 23 (89) 563‚Äì582, 1999, . For example, the roughly 268,000 mathematicians with a known Erd≈ës number have a median value of 5. In contrast, the median Erd≈ës number of Fields Medalists is 3. As of 2015, approximately 11,000 mathematicians have an Erd≈ës number of 2 or less. Collaboration distances will necessarily increase over long time scales, as mathematicians with low Erd≈ës numbers die and become unavailable for collaboration. The American Mathematical Society provides a free online tool to determine the Erd≈ës number of every mathematical author listed in the Mathematical Reviews catalogue. The Erd≈ës number was most likely first defined by Casper Goffman,Michael Golomb's obituary of Paul Erd≈ës an analyst whose own Erd≈ës number is 2.from the Erdos Number Project Goffman published his observations about Erd≈ës's prolific collaboration in a 1969 article titled \\"And what is your Erd≈ës number?\\" Jerry Grossman has written that it could be argued that Baseball Hall of Famer Hank Aaron can be considered to have an Erd≈ës number of 1 because they both autographed the same baseball (for Carl Pomerance) when Emory University awarded them honorary degrees on the same day. Erd≈ës numbers have also been proposed for an infant, a horse, and several actors.

Founded in 1890,\\"An Act to establish a University in Tasmania\\", Victoriae Reginae No 41, Tasmanian Parliament, 5 December 1889. it is Australia's fourth oldest university. Christ College, one of the university's residential colleges, was founded in 1846 and is the oldest tertiary institution in the country. It is a sandstone university and a member of the international Association of Commonwealth Universities and the Association of Southeast Asian Institutions of Higher Learning. The university offers various undergraduate and graduate programs in a range of disciplines, and has links with 20 specialist research institutes and co-operative research centres. Its Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies has strongly contributed to the university's multiple 5 rating scores (well above world standard) for excellence in research awarded by the Australian Research Council. The university also delivers tertiary education at the Australian Maritime College, the national centre for maritime education, training and research. The university was ranked in the top 10 research universities in Australia and in the top two per cent of universities worldwide in the Academic Ranking of World Universities. History =Founding and early years (1890‚Äì1938)= Andrew Inglis Clark a major contributor to the Constitution of Australia, served as Vice-Chancellor of the university from 1901 to 1903 The University of Tasmania was established on 1 January 1890, after the abolition of overseas scholarships freed up funds. It immediately took over the role of the Tasmanian Council for Education.'Open to Talent: the centenary history of the University of Tasmania', Richard Davis, University of Tasmania Press, 1990. . Also http://eprints.utas.edu.au/16513/. Accessed 26 June 2014. Richard Deodatus Poulett Harris, who had long advocated for the establishment of the university, became its first warden of the senate. The first degrees to graduates admitted ad eundem gradum and diplomas were awarded in June 1890. The university was offered an ornate sandstone building on the Queens Domain in Hobart, previously the High School of Hobart, though it was leased by others until mid-1892. This eventually became known as University House. Three lecturers began teaching 11 students from 22 March 1893, once University House had been renovated. Parliamentarians branding it an unnecessary luxury made the university's early existence precarious. The institution's encouragement of female students fuelled criticism. James Backhouse Walker, a local lawyer and briefly Vice-Chancellor, mounted a courageous defence. By the First World War there were over 100 students, and several Tasmanian graduates were influential in law and politics. According to Chancellor Sir John Morris, from 1918 until 1939 the institution still 'limped along'. Distinguished staff had already been appointed, such as historian William Jethro Brown, physicists and mathematicians Alexander McAulay and his son Alexander Leicester McAulay, classicist RL Dunbabin, and philosopher and polymath Edmund Morris Miller. Housed in the former Hobart High School, facilities were totally outgrown, but the state government was slow to fund a new campus. In 1914 the university petitioned King George V for Letters Patent,http://eprints.utas.edu.au/15872/2/Petition-UTAS.pdf. Accessed 26 June 2014. which request he granted. The Letters Patent, sometimes called the Royal Charter, granted the university's degrees status as equivalent to the established universities of the United Kingdom, where such equivalents existed.http://eprints.utas.edu.au/15939/. Accessed 26 June 2014. =World War II (1939‚Äì45)= During the Second World War, while the Optical Munitions Annexe assisted the war effort, local graduates, replacing soldier academics, taught a handful of students. New post-war staff, many with overseas experience, pressed for removal to adequate facilities at Sandy Bay on an old rifle range. Chancellor Sir John Morris, also Chief Justice, though a dynamic reformer, antagonised academics by his authoritarianism. Vice-Chancellor Torliev Hytten, an eminent economist, saw contention peak while the move to Sandy Bay was delayed. In a passionate open letter to the premier, Philosophy Professor Sydney Orr goaded the government into establishing the 1955 Royal Commission into the university. The commission's report demanded extensive reform of both university and governing council. Staff were delighted, while lay administrators fumed. =Post-war years (1946‚Äì1964)= The university's first site at Queens Domain. The university moved to its Sandy Bay campus in the early 1960s On 10 May 1949, the university awarded its first Doctor of Philosophy to Joan Munro Ford. Ford worked as a research biologist in the University of Tasmania's Department of Physics between 1940 and 1950. In early 1956 Orr was summarily dismissed, mainly for his alleged though denied seduction of a student. A ten-year battle involved academics in Australia and overseas. Orr lost an unfair dismissal action in the Supreme Court of Tasmania and the High Court of Australia. The Tasmanian Chair of Philosophy was boycotted. In 1966 Orr received some financial compensation from the University, which also established a cast-iron tenure system. The latter disappeared with the federal reorganisation of higher education in the late 1980s. In the early 1960s The University of Tasmania at last transferred to a purpose-built new campus at Sandy Bay, though many departments were initially housed in ex-World War II wooden huts. It profited from increasing federal finance following the 1957 Murray Report. Medical and Agricultural Schools were established and the sciences obtained adequate laboratories. Physics achieved world recognition in astronomy (optical, radio and cosmic rays), while other departments attracted good scholars and graduates were celebrated in many fields. Student facilities improved remarkably.Karmel Report =Mergers and the \\"new\\" university (1965‚Äì99)= The 1965 Martin Report established a traditional role for universities, and a more practical role for colleges of advanced education. The Tasmanian Government duly created the Tasmanian College of Advanced Education (TCAE) in 1966 sited on Mount Nelson above the university. It initially incorporated The School of Art, the Conservatorium of Music and the Hobart Teachers College. In 1971, a Launceston campus of the TCAE was announced. These were fateful decisions, as events over the next years showed. It was argued that the TCAE attempted to compete with the university, not complement it. In 1978 the University of Tasmania took over two of the courses offered by the TCAE in Hobart, Pharmacy and Surveying, following a report by Professor Karmel, and another by H.E. Cosgrove. Some other TCAE courses in Hobart moved to Launceston. The curious situation of three separate courses in teacher education in the State could not last, however, and following two more reports, the university incorporated the remaining courses of the Hobart campus of the College of Advanced Education in 1981, which raised its numbers to 5000. The Launceston campus of the TCAE renamed itself the Tasmanian State Institute of Technology (TSIT). In 1987, the University Council resolved to approach the TSIT to negotiate a merger to minimise ongoing conflict. The 'Dawkins Revolution' and the 'unified national system' provided later support for this initiative. The Tasmanian State Institute of Technology became the Newnham Campus of the university on 1 January 1991, exactly 101 years after the university's founding. A new campus at Burnie on the North-West Coast of Tasmania was opened in 1995, and later became known as the Cradle Coast Campus. =21st century= In 2001, the Tasmania Law Reform Institute (TLRI) was established to create a link between institutional law reform in the State created by the demise of first the Tasmanian Law Reform Commission in 1989, and then its replacement, the Tasmanian Law Reform Commissioner in 1997. The new institutes model was based on the Alberta Law Reform Institute, an agency based on an agreement between the Canadian province of Alberta, the Law Society , and the University of Alberta and funded primarily by the Government and the Law Society of Alberta. The TLRI has been used as a template for the establishment of similar institutes at the University of Adelaide with the South Australian Law Reform Institute and in the Australian Capital Territory. Damian Bugg became the university's chancellor in 2006, having previously served as a member of the University Council since 2001. Bugg was an alumnus of the university who studied law and resided at John Fisher College where he was president. While chancellor, he also served as Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. That year the university opened two satellite campuses in Sydney, offering nursing and paramedic education in partnership with local hospitals and health services such as St Vincent's Hospital. The Greenhill Observatory joined the universities other radio astronomy antennas including the Mount Pleasant Radio Observatory (pictured) in Cambridge, Tasmania The Australian Maritime College (AMC) merged with the university in 2008. The merger helped streamline degree programs and improved provision of basic services at the combined Newnham campus. The University formed the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS) in 2010 to help integrate the Institute of Antarctic and Southern Ocean Studied and the Tasmanian Aquaculture and Fisheries Institute, as well as the universities existing marine and Antarctic facility. The Greenhill Observatory which houses a 1.27 meter optical telescope was opened in 2013 to replace the previous observatory at Canopus Hill, near Hobart. The observatory joined the universities two other observatories including the Mount Pleasant Radio Observatory and Ceduna Radio Observatory in Ceduna, South Australia. Campuses The university has three main campuses based in Hobart, Launceston and Burnie. It also has a number of small, specialist facilities within the College of Health and Medicine at its Darlinghurst and Rozelle campuses in Sydney. It also has a joint research facility at the city's Australian National Maritime Museum in Pyrmont. =Southern= Hobart The MS1 Building of the Medical Sciences Precinct * Tasmanian Conservatorium of Music (the Conservatorium of Music campus is no longer a public building; access to the premises by the public, students and staff is restricted). *Medical Sciences Precinct in the inner city that encompasses the College of Health and Medicine and the Menzies Institute for Medical Research.

Coat of arms The Grant of Arms was made by the College of Arms. The blazon reads: '''' In 1936 the University Council ran a competition to produce a draft set of Arms to replace the common seal it had used since 1901, based on the badge of the Tasmanian Council of Education with the motto Floreat Tasmania (May Tasmania Prosper). The winning design included four key elements of the current Arms of the university including a lion (representing Tasmania), a book (representing the academic side of the University), a Southern Cross (representing Australia) and a touch (representing the athletic side of the University), over a crown (Or) (signifying the royal charter held by the University). The official coat of arms was granted by the College of Heralds in 1978. The core elements of the 1936 design were kept with slight adjustments made to comply with heraldic rules. Student life =Student unionism= Until 2008, there were two separate student unions: the Tasmania University Union (TUU) in Hobart and the Student Association (SA) in Launceston. Following the abolition of compulsory student unionism in 2007, the SA and the TUU amalgamated into one statewide organisation representing all UTAS students.http://www.electoral.tas.gov.au/pages/OtherElections/TUU/PDF/TUU%20notice%20of%20election.pdf The TUU is responsible for the overseeing of all the university's many sports clubs and societies. Some of these include faculty-based societies providing academic and careers guidance; societies relating to various interests, such as the Old Nick Company; and various sporting clubs, including cricket, football, rugby union and soccer. The TUU also publishes the independent student media at the University of Tasmania, Togatus.https://tuu.com.au/publications/togatus/ Postgraduate students are represented by the TUU through the Tasmania University Union Postgraduate Council. The TUU Postgraduate Council was previously organised as the Tasmania University Postgraduate Association (TUPA). TUPA was established in 1982 to represent postgraduate research students on campus independently of the TUU. =Residential colleges and student accommodation= The University's Melville Street accommodation in the Hobart CBD The original Christ College Building in 1856 The university maintains a strong residential college system, as well as providing more independent apartment-style living. A key aspect of campus life, the residential colleges are equipped with modern facilities and host several events during the semesters. The colleges also maintain their respective student clubs, key in the passing of traditions from one cohort to the next. The southern colleges annually compete in a series of sporting events including Rugby, Australian Football, Cricket, Softball, Basketball, Table Tennis, Tennis and Soccer. The college system comprises Christ College, Jane Franklin Hall and St. John Fisher College in Hobart, and Kerslake Hall, Leprena and Investigator Hall in Launceston. The university accommodation system also includes the University Apartments and Mount Nelson Villas in Sandy Bay, Hobart Apartments and MidCity in the Hobart CBD, Endeavour Hall in Beauty Point for students of the Australian Maritime College, Newnham Apartments and Inveresk Apartments in Launceston, and West Park Apartments in Burnie. Two other residential colleges once existed in Hobart ‚Äì the non- denominational Hytten Hall (1959‚Äì1980) located on the Sandy Bay campus, and now used as a building for the Faculty of Education, and Ena Waite Women's College (1968‚Äì1980), operated by the Catholic Church and located in central Hobart, which amalgamated with St. John Fisher College. An off-campus student residence in Launceston, Clarence House, operated from 2004 to 2008. =Tasmania Scholarships= The Tasmania Scholarships program supports the university's commitment to offer students equal learning opportunity. It assists talented students, both locally, nationally and internationally. Industry contributions now make up the backbone of the Tasmania Scholarships program. The development and growth of this initiative into one of the most successful sponsored programs in the country is exceptional by any standard. Around 10 per cent of all domestic students at UTAS receive some sort of scholarship or financial assistance. Scholarships are also offered under the banner of the Jim Bacon Memorial Scholarship, funded by the Tasmanian Government. Notable people The University of Tasmania has produced many notable alumni, with graduates having held the offices of Governor of Tasmania, Justices of the High, Supreme, Federal courts, Premiers of Tasmania and elected leaders of other states and territories, Rhodes Scholars, the first female professor in Australia, ministers of foreign countries, Lord Mayors, academics, architects, historians, poets, philosophers, politicians, scientists, physicists, authors, industry leaders, defence force personnel, corporate leaders, community leaders, and artists. There are over 100,000 graduates of the University of Tasmania, spanning 104 countries.
