Hence, soft materials can become highly deformed before crack propagation. Consequently, the stress field close to the crack tip is significantly different from the traditional formulation encountered in the Linear elastic fracture mechanics. Therefore, fracture analysis for these applications requires a special attention. The Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) and K-field (see Fracture Mechanics) are based on the assumption of infinitesimal deformation, and as a result are not suitable to describe the fracture of soft materials. The reason for this is that soft materials usually become highly deformed and blunted before crack propagation. However, LEFM general approach can be applied to understand the basics of fracture on soft materials. Alternatively to the linear approach of fracture in LEFM, the solution for the deformation and crack stress field in soft materials considers large deformation and is derived from the finite strain elastostatics framework and hyperelastic material models. Hyperelastic material models Hyperelastic material models are utilized to obtain the stress–strain relationship through a strain energy density function. Relevant models for deriving stress-strain relations for soft materials are: Mooney-Rivlin solid, Neo-Hookean, Exponentially hardening material and Gent hyperelastic models. On this page, the results will be primarily derived from the Neo-Hookean model. =Generalized neo-Hookean (GNH)= The Neo-Hookean model is generalized to account for the hardening factor: W = \\\\frac{\\\\mu}{2b} \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\left[ 1 + \\\\frac{b}{n}(I-3) \\\\right]^{n} - 1 \\\\right \\\\\\\\}, where b>0 and n>1/2 are material parameters, and I = I_{1} is the first invariant of the Cauchy-Green deformation tensor: I_{1} = \\\\lambda_{1}^{2}+\\\\lambda_{2}^{2}+\\\\lambda_{3}^{2}, where \\\\lambda_{\\\\alpha} are the principle stretches.  Specific Neo-Hookean model  Setting n=1, the specific stress-strain function for the neo-Hookean model is derived: W = \\\\frac{\\\\mu}{2} (I-3). Finite strain crack tip solutions (under large deformation) 278x278px Since LEFM is no longer applicable, alternative methods are adapted to capture large deformations in the calculation of stress and deformation fields. In this context the method of asymptotic analysis is of relevance. = Method of asymptotic analysis = The method of asymptotic analysis consists of analyzing the crack-tip asymptotically to find a series expansion of the deformed coordinates capable to characterize the solution near the crack tip. The analysis is reducible to a nonlinear eigenvalue problem. The problem is formulated based on a crack in an infinite solid, loaded at infinity with uniform uni-axial tension under condition of plane strain (see Fig.1). As the crack deforms and progresses, the coordinates in the current configuration are represented by y_{1} and y_{2} in cartesian basis and \\\\rho and \\\\phi in polar basis. The coordinates y_{1} and y_{2} are functions of the undeformed coordinates (r, \\\\theta) and near the crack tip, as r→0, can be specified as: y_{\\\\alpha}(r,\\\\theta) = r^{m_{\\\\alpha}} \\\\upsilon_{\\\\alpha}(\\\\theta)+r^{p_{\\\\alpha}} q_{\\\\alpha}(\\\\theta)+... m_{\\\\alpha} \\\\alpha = 1,2, where m_{\\\\alpha} , p_{\\\\alpha} are unknown exponents, and \\\\upsilon_{\\\\alpha}(\\\\theta) , q_{\\\\alpha}(\\\\theta) are unknown functions describing the angular variation. In order to obtain the eigenvalues, the equation above is substituted into the constitutive model, which yields the corresponding nominal stress components. Then, the stresses are substituted into the equilibrium equations (the same formulation as in LEFM theory) and the boundary conditions are applied. The most dominating terms are retained resulting in an eigenvalue problem for \\\\upsilon_{\\\\alpha}(\\\\theta) and m_{\\\\alpha} .  Deformation and stress field in a plane strain crack  For the case of a homogeneous neo-Hookean solid (n=1) under Mode I condition the deformed coordinates for a plane strain configuration are given by y_{1}=-b_{0}r sin^{2}(\\\\theta/2), \\\\quad y_{2}=ar^{1/2}sin(\\\\theta/2), where a and b_{0}are unknown positive amplitudes that depends on the applied loading and specimen geometry. The leading terms for the nominal stress (or first Piola–Kirchhoff stress, denoted by \\\\sigma on this page) are: \\\\sigma_{11}=\\\\mu b_{0}, \\\\quad \\\\sigma_{12}=o(1), \\\\sigma_{21}=-\\\\frac{\\\\mu a}{2} r^{-1/2}sin(\\\\theta/2), \\\\sigma_{22}=\\\\frac{\\\\mu a}{2} r^{-1/2}cos(\\\\theta/2). Thus, \\\\sigma_{11}and \\\\sigma_{21}are bounded at the crack tip and \\\\sigma_{21}and \\\\sigma_{22}have the same singularity. The leading terms for the true stress (or Cauchy stress, denoted by \\\\tau on this page), \\\\tau_{11}=\\\\mu b_{0}^{2}sin^{2}(\\\\theta/2), \\\\tau_{12}=\\\\tau_{21} = -\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{2} a b_{0} r^{-1/2} sin^{2}(\\\\theta/2), \\\\tau_{22}=\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{4} a^{2} r^{-1}. The only true stress component completely defined by a is \\\\tau_{22}. It also presents the most severe singularity. With that, it is clear that the singularity differs if the stress is given in the current or reference configuration. Additionally, in LEFM, the true stress field under Mode I has a singularity of {r}^{-1/2}, which is weaker than the singularity in \\\\tau_{22}. While in LEFM the near tip displacement field depends only on the Mode I stress intensity factor, it is shown here that for large deformations, the displacement depends on two parameters (a and b_{0} for a plane strain condition).  Deformation and stress field in a plane stress crack  The crack tip deformation field for a Mode I configuration in a homogeneous material neo-Hookean solid (n=1) is given by y_{1}= cr \\\\, cos\\\\theta, \\\\quad y_{2}=a\\\\sqrt{r} sin(\\\\theta/2), where a and c are positive independent amplitudes determined by far field boundary conditions. The dominant terms of the nominal stress are \\\\sigma_{11}=\\\\mu c, \\\\quad \\\\sigma_{12}=o(1), \\\\sigma_{21}=-\\\\frac{\\\\mu a}{2} r^{-1/2} sin(\\\\theta/2), \\\\sigma_{22}=\\\\frac{\\\\mu a}{2} r^{-1/2} cos(\\\\theta/2). And the true stress components are \\\\tau_{11}=\\\\mu c^{2}, \\\\quad \\\\tau_{12}=\\\\tau_{21} = -\\\\frac{\\\\mu }{2} ac r^{-1/2} sin(\\\\theta/2), \\\\tau_{22}=\\\\frac{\\\\mu}{4} a^{2}r^{-1}. Analogously, the displacement depends on two parameters (a and c for a plane stress condition) and the singularity is stronger in the \\\\tau_{22} term. The distribution of the true stress in the deformed coordinates (as shown in Fig. 1B) can be relevant when analyzing the crack propagation and blunt phenomenon. Additionally, it is useful when verifying experimental results of the deformation of the crack. J-integral The J-integral represents the energy that flows to the crack, hence, it is used to calculate the energy release rate, G. Additionally, it can be used as a fracture criterion. This integral is found to be path independent as long as the material is elastic and damages to the microstructure are not occurring. Evaluating J on a circular path in the reference configuration yields J = \\\\pi A \\\\left( \\\\frac{2n-1}{2n} \\\\right)^{2n-1} n^{2-n} a^{2n}, for plane strain Mode I, where a is the amplitude of the leading order term of y_2 and A and n are material parameters from the strain-energy function. For plane stress Mode I in a neo-Heookean material J is given by J = \\\\frac{\\\\mu \\\\pi}{2} \\\\left(\\\\frac{b}{n} \\\\right)^{n-1} \\\\left( \\\\frac{2n-1}{2n} \\\\right)^{2n-1} n^{1-n} a^{2n}, where b and n are material parameters of GNH solids. For the specific case of a neo-Hookean model, where n=1, b=1 and A = \\\\mu/2, the J-integral for plane stress and plane strain in Mode I are the same: J = \\\\frac{\\\\mu \\\\pi a^{2}}{4}. = J-integral in the pure-shear experiment = The J-integral can be determined by experiments. One common experiment is the pure-shear in an infinite long strip, as shown in Fig. 2. The upper and bottom edges are clamped by grips and the loading is applied by pulling the grips vertically apart by ± ∆. This set generates a condition of plane stress. 274x274px Under these conditions, the J-integral is evaluated, therefore, as J = 2h_{0}W(I_{1},I_{2})=2h_{0}\\\\Psi(\\\\lambda), where I_{1}=I_{2}=\\\\lambda^{2}+\\\\lambda^{-2}+1, \\\\lambda = 1 + \\\\frac{\\\\Delta}{h_{0}}, and h_{0}is the high of the strip undeformed state. The function \\\\Psi(\\\\lambda)is determined by measuring the nominal stress acting on the strip stretched by \\\\lambda: \\\\Psi = \\\\int_{1}^{\\\\lambda} \\\\sigma(\\\\lambda) d\\\\lambda. Therefore, from the imposed displacement of each grip, ± ∆, it is possible to determine the J-integral for the corresponding nominal stress. With the J-integral, the amplitude (parameter a) of some true stress components can be found. Some other stress components amplitudes, however, depend on other parameters such as c (e.g. \\\\sigma_{11} under plane stress condition) and cannot be determined by the pure shear experiment. Nevertheless, the pure shear experiment is very important because it allows the characterization of fracture toughness of soft materials. Interface cracks 292x292px To approach the interaction of adhesion between soft adhesives and rigid substrates, the asymptotic solution for an interface crack problem between a GNH material and a rigid substrate is specified. The interface crack configuration considered here is shown in Fig.3 where the lateral slip is disregarded. For the special neo-Hookean case with n=1, and \\\\overline{v_{1}}=\\\\overline{v_{2}}=cos \\\\theta , the solution for the deformed coordinates is y_{1}=a_{1}r^{\\\\frac{1}{2}}sin \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} \\\\right) + r cos \\\\theta , y_{2}=a_{2}r^{\\\\frac{1}{2}}sin \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} \\\\right), 281x281pxwhich is equivalent to y_{1} = \\\\frac{a_{1}}{a_{2}}y_{2}-\\\\left( \\\\frac{y_{2}}{a_{2}} \\\\right)^{2}. According to the above equation, the crack on this type of interface is found to open with a parabolic shape. This is confirmed by plotting the normalized coordinates y_{1}/a_{2}^2 vs y_{2}/a_{2}^{2} for different a_{1}/a_{2} ratios (see Fig. 4). To go through the analysis of the interface between two GNH sheets with the same hardening characteristics, refer to the model described by Gaubelle and Knauss.

In her performance Cano, used jello to recreate her face becoming the center of attention. With her next few works, she focused on the lack of a body presence seen within Calor de hogar (1984) and Distancias (1990). Her vision in the early and mid 2000s shifted towards animal avatars and iconography. Cano continued to investigate the role art can play outside the traditional gallery as seen with efforts trying to start a new art activism (Mi vida es privada, pública mi educacción 2002).  Education  Cano graduated from the plastic arts department of the University of Antioquia in Medellin, Colombia.Gaviria, Juan Alberto. et al. Aproximaciones . Medellín: Galería Centro Colombo Americano, 1993. Print. She studied art in Medellin for nine years from 1980 to 1989. It was during this time she began receiving attention for her works, receiving both positive and negative reviews.  Artworks  *Yo servida a la mesa 1981 is one of Cano's earliest involvements in the art scene was at event held by the Primer Salón Arturo y Rebecca Rabinovich. *Calor de hogar 1983 is of mark an iron made with its steam. It is presented on a brownish canvas with the iron mark being the shape of the iron in dark brown, looking like copper or rust. For this art piece, Cano used a work of aesthetic contents that transforms from formal to conceptual. The repeated action of branding the canvas with the imprint of the iron symbolizes the daily work of people that becomes an ideological, cultural and intimate burden, but also the time that goes by persistently elaborating the same activity again and again. The imprint that appears is arranged solitarily without more other elements other than the ocher leaving by heat, \\"as if it were the brush, is the instrument used for the plastic, as well as the tool for everyday life\\". *Quizas el ultimo encuentro amoroso quizas el ultimo beso sera 1991, which art critics described her art as \\"destructively\\" aligned small pixel-like squares on a sticky surface. *Sobre nupcias y ausencias 1992 included a fragment of Juana de Ibarbourou's poem \\"Olor frutal\\" written out across a red and pink flowerlike wallpaper. This was meant to encapsulate the socially constructed, romanticized cliche between a married woman and her husband. *Horda 1997 was one of Cano's earlier experimentations with animals in her art pieces. This piece was made by printing red and white sheep-like animals onto a red canvas with the words \\"El diablo anda suelto como león reglente ... \\" which translates into the devil is loose as a rejuvenating lion.  Exhibitions  * Instalaciones 1991 was a Colombian art exhibition which was the first exclusively to display installations as a formal and conceptual art medium. * Aproximaciones 1993 was an exhibition which included five artists whose ideas in one way or another resonated their voice to the viewer. * Radical Women Latin American Art, 1960–1985 (2018) was an exhibition which included Latin women artists who focused on using the female body for political and social critiques and artistic expression.

The film captures a solo performance by Tovah Feldshuh — who plays Golda Meir and numerous other characters in the course of the film's eighty-six minutes — during a multi- camera, video recording in front of a live audience in May 2003. The multi- camera video recording was edited into a motion picture in early 2019, after which it went on to become an Official Selection at numerous film festivals in North America. As of 2020, the film had been selected for 75 Film Festivals in North and South American, as well as Europe and Asia and, in addition, had won twenty Audience Choice Awards as \\"Best Feature\\" among the festivals to which it had been invited. Plot The film is, like the play, a dramatization of a middle of the night reminiscence by a dying Golda Meir, the fourth Prime Minister of Israel, as she endures insomnia while tracing the main events of her seventy-nine years of life. While the plot is anchored in the events of her Premiership during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Golda relives (and describes to the audience) the events of her childhood during the 1903 Kishinev pogrom in Moscow, her emigration to Milwaukee at the age of seven, her teenage activism in the Labor Zionist movement during World War I, her emigration to the British Mandate for Palestine in 1921, her rise in Israeli politics from the 1920s through the 1970s (as an important member of both the Histadrut and the Yishuv, then Minister of Labor, Foreign Minister, and finally Prime Minister of Israel) — finally climaxing with her consideration of the Samson Option to drop nuclear weapons on the armies of the Arab states at the peak of the Yom Kippur War. Cast * Tovah Feldshuh as Prime Minister Golda Meir and forty-four other characters (including Henry Kissinger, Moshe Dayan, David Ben-Gurion, as well as both sides of a dialog with King Abdullah I of Jordan, just before the Israeli Declaration of Independence). Background and production The play Golda's Balcony made its Manhattan debut in March, 2003. At some point during the play's Off-Broadway run (in May, 2003), a multi- camera, video recording in front of a live audience of the play was captured on video, and later (in 2019) assembled as a film by producer Fishelson and video director Gerard Issembert. By January 2019, the film was invited to make its World Premiere at the 2019 Palm Beach Jewish Film Festival on January 24, at the Cinépolis Luxury Cinemas in Jupiter, Florida. At the Palm Beach Festival, the film was awarded the “Audience Award Winner for Best Feature.” Release and reception Since the film's World Premiere in Palm Beach in early 2019, the film earned Official Selections to over 70 festivals throughout North and South America, as well as Europe and Asia, including festivals in Boston, Philadelphia, Austin, Hong Kong, Vienna, São Paulo, Los Angeles (Closing Night), Detroit, Phoenix, Chicago, St. Louis, São Paulo, Brazil, and Tampa Bay. As of April 11, 2019, the film had earned the Audience Award for \\"Best Feature,\\" \\"Best Narrative Film\\" or \\"Audience Choice Winner\\" at all 20 of the competitive festivals it had competed in — including those of Boston, Philadelphia, Austin, Hong Kong, Palm Beach, Pittsburgh, Charlotte, Honolulu, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Rockland County (NY), Winnipeg and Dayton, Ohio.

He unsuccessfully attempts suicide. His friend John takes him to the hospital, where the doctor asks him to admit himself in a mental rehab, which he refuses. The next day, Aarya runs away from her home. She arrives at Ravi's home stating that she had made a booking to Kailash three months before. Ravi tries explaining to her that he has shut down his business and attempts to call the police, but she gets irritated and slits her wrists. Ravi then takes her to the hospital. Once back from the hospital, Ravi takes Aarya to his house, where Aarya convinces him to take her to Kailash for the sake of Pooja and gives her a letter with Pooja's handwriting. He agrees. Nandini and Yogesh meanwhile go to Gyaan Prakash with Commissioner Rajesh Puri. Gyaan Prakash then says that Aarya will be killed by her own blood. During the journey, Aarya tells Ravi about her mission to stop Guru Gyaan Prakash and all other fake gurus. Her evil aunt, Nandini, had killed Aarya's mother, married Yogesh and started using their wealth to run Gyaan Prakash's ashram. She then recounts meeting Vishal and initially fighting with him but reconciling and falling in love over a seminar exposing fake gurus. After her home is vandalised, they go into hiding. One day, they are asked to visit someone who had proof against the gurus. However, it turned out to be an ambush, with Vishal killing the hitman in self-defense. Ravi then picks up Vishal from jail. Yogesh and Nandini find the reunion of Vishal and Aarya in the security footage. Later, an irritated Vishal decides to call a friend and the couple goes away with him. However, their friend takes them to an abandoned factory and runs away. They are then cornered by a gangster named Dilip Hathkaaka. Ravi arrives and saves the couple. While resting at a stop, Vishal confesses that his real name is Munna Chavan. He says that he came to Mumbai to win a reality show but ended up becoming a drug addict. He was helped by Guru Gyaan Prakash's men. He was chosen by them to pretend to fall in love with Aarya and then kill her. However, upon attending Aarya's seminars, he started questioning his own belief. Ravi then takes them to his friend John's house. While going inside the house, Ravi imagines Pooja's ghost stopping them. After a gunfight, the trio manage to escape and celebrate Aryaa's birthday. It is revealed that Yogesh had planned the killing of his first wife. He then kills Nandini. In the end, Ravi dies after killing Yogesh and Gyaan Prakash and imagines Pooja calling out to him.

Her third given name was inspried by the ferry-line Trelleborg-Sassnitz, of which her father, Gustaf Oscar Wallenberg (Oscar Wallenberg), had been CEO in the 1890s. He later was the Swedish ambassador to Japan; it was during one of those trips to Japan, in 1917, that his daughter met Dardel at the annual imperial cherry- blossom festival.Erik Näslund, Dardel, Författarförlaget 1988, page 123. Wallenberg was engaged to Dardel in secret, but the engagement was annulled in 1919 by her family when they told Dardel that he did not meet the requirements to be married into the Wallenberg family.Thora Dardel, Jag for till Paris, Bonniers 1941, page 23 He was not considered useful to the Wallenberg company (indeed, the risk that Dardel would take advantage of being married into the family was considered very high), and rumours about his nightlife had reached Nita's father.Erik Näslund, Dardel, Författarförlaget 1988, page 134. The broken engagement heavily affected Dardel's painting and resulted in several pictures of womanly figures that resemble Nita.Karl Asplund, Nils Dardel, Sveriges allmänna konstförening, Stockholm 1958 \\"Nita\\" Wallenberg appears in some of Dardel's work, including Yngling i svart, Flicka i vitt from 1919, Vattenfallet from 1921, and Ynglingen och flickan from 1919.

It made permanent an earlier act on special constables passed in 1914. Words and sections from the Act were repealed by the Police (Scotland) Act 1956 and the Police Act 1964 and - though it has not been repealed in its entirety - none of its Sections are now in effect. Its Section 1 effectively repealed the phrase \\"during the present war\\" from the Special Constables Act 1914 and the reference to that act in the First Schedule to the War Emergency Laws (Continuance) Act, 1920, though in both respects it exempted Northern Ireland. Its Section 2 set up a procedure whereby any Orders in Council made under the 1914 Act as modified by the 1923 Act would be put before \\"both Houses of Parliament as soon as may be after it is made\\". A member of either House then had 21 sitting days after that date to lay an address before the Crown for the repeal of any regulations made by that Order in Council. Such regulations would be made void \\"without prejudice to the validity of any proceedings which may in the meantime have been taken thereunder or to the making of any new regulations provided that Orders in Council under the said Act shall not be deemed to be statutory rules within the meaning of section one of the Rules Publication Act, 1893.\\" Its Section 3 replaced Metropolitan Police policing of dockyards and military bases with special constables, to be nominated by the Admiralty, Army Council or Air Council and confirmed by two justices of the peace (England and Wales), magistrates of a burgh (Scotland) or standing joint committee of a county (Scotland), with all the same powers Metropolitan Police constables had had in those places under the Metropolitan Police Act 1860 or the Metropolitan Police (Employment in Scotland) Act, 1914. Such special constables remained under the control of the department which had nominated them, which also had power to suspend or terminate their appointment as a special constable. This led to the establishment of the Royal Marine Police, the Army Department Constabulary and the Air Ministry Constabulary over the course of the 1920s - these were later all subsumed into the Ministry of Defence Police. Its Section 4 applied Section 96 of the Burgh Police (Scotland) Act, 1892 and its extension by the Special Constables (Scotland) Act, 1914 to the 1923 Act, but set the age as between 20 and 50 rather than those two Acts' 26 and over.

It stars Julia Garner, Matthew Macfadyen, Makenzie Leigh, Kristine Froseth, Jon Orsini, and Noah Robbins. It had its world premiere at the Telluride Film Festival on August 30, 2019. It was released on January 31, 2020, by Bleecker Street.  Plot  The film takes place over the course of a single day in the life of Jane, a junior assistant who has been working at a film production company in New York City for five weeks. Jane arrives well before dawn and performs various menial administrative tasks. Her job's long hours and demanding tasks keep her busy and incredibly stressed. During a phone call with her mother, Jane learns that she forgot to call her father on his birthday. As Jane's day progresses, it becomes clear that her boss has been having sex in his office with many younger women and facilitates a culture of sexual harassment at the company. Many of the male executives make snide comments about the boss's affairs while the female executives handle their own workloads and discuss the possibility of transferring to other departments. Whenever Jane does something her boss deems a mistake, he verbally abuses her over the phone as her two male junior assistant coworkers watch silently. Throughout the day, a variety of people from the boss's life interact with Jane, including his wife, his children's nanny, a famous actor, and a group of Chinese film producers. In the afternoon, a young, inexperienced woman named Sienna arrives from Idaho, saying she has been offered a job as a junior assistant. Jane, concerned for Sienna's well-being, goes to the Human Resources department to file a report after dropping Sienna off at a five-star hotel being paid for by the company. Wilcock, the head of HR, encourages Jane to share her concerns, but later makes it clear that he is turning a blind eye to her harassment claims, before demeaning her, speaking down to her, and stating she is jealous. He also discloses that filing a formal complaint would destroy Jane's career. As she leaves, he reminds her that she has nothing to worry about as Jane is not the boss's \\"type\\". Visibly upset, Jane receives a call from her boss when she returns to her desk. He has been informed about the unfiled report and demands Jane write an email apology addressed to him. He replies saying that he is especially hard on Jane because he knows how great she is. Towards the end of the day, Sienna arrives at the office so Jane can teach her how to use the phone systems. As night falls, Jane prepares a microwave dinner for herself while other employees leave; her boss stays late in his office with a young actress.

Reception On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 92% based on 207 reviews, with an average rating of 7.58/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Led by a powerhouse performance from Julia Garner, The Assistant offers a withering critique of workplace harassment and systemic oppression.\\" On Metacritic, which assesses films on a score out of 100, The Assistant holds a score of 79 based on reviews from 43 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" Writing for The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw called it \\"a claustrophobic, intimately unsettling movie\\" and stated that \\"it can claim to be the first drama that addresses the #MeToo issue\\". In a similarly positive review, Moira Macdonald of the Seattle Times lauded Julia Garner's performance and described the film as \\"[shining] a light on a malevolent shadow\\". She also complimented it on being \\"wound taut and perfectly controlled\\", just like its main protagonist, making for an experience that \\"feels entirely real\\". Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times viewed the film as \\"less a #MeToo story than a painstaking examination of the way individual slights can coalesce into a suffocating miasma of harassment\\" and also noted Garner's lead performance, which she said \\"makes the slow draining of Jane's soul almost visible\\". Justin Chang of NPR concluded that \\"it's the rigorous understatement of The Assistant that makes it so powerful in its vision of how easily the Harvey Weinsteins of the world could exploit their absolute authority for years with little fear of consequence.\\" See also * Me Too movement * Weinstein effect * Time's Up References External links 2019 films 2019 drama films 2010s feminist films American drama films American feminist films American films Bleecker Street films Films about sexual harassment Films produced by James Schamus Films scored by Tamar-kali Films set in offices Films set in New York City Films shot in New York City ","title":"The Assistant (2019 film)"},{"id":"60444459","text":"The Special Constables Act 1914 (4 & 5 George V, c. 61; An Act to enable His Majesty, by Order in Council, to make regulations with respect to Special Constables appointed during the present war.) was a British act of parliament, given royal assent on 28 August 1914, weeks after the outbreak of the First World War.

The Amalgamated Association of Miners (AAM) began recruiting members in the Rhondda Valley in 1870, William Brown chairing a recruitment meeting. Members in the valley were part of a largely successful strike in 1871, and early in 1872 they were placed in their own, Rhondda District. Rhondda District secretary, Williams Davies, disappeared partway through a lock out in 1875, and the AAM collapsed soon afterwards. The Rhondda District, like the other surviving Welsh districts, instead joined the Miners' National Union, and was represented by Henry Rowlands at a conference of its Monmouthshire and South Wales Council, in 1876. Mabon had been the AAM's last agent in South Wales, and he was elected as president of a reformed AAM in 1877. He relocated to the Rhondda in 1877. That year, the Cambrian Miners' Association split, the minority becoming the Rhondda House Coal Miners' Association, and the majority becoming the Rhondda Steam Coal Miners' Association, choosing Mabon as its agent.. Under Mabon's leadership, the union grew rapidly, and his success led to the creation of numerous other unions of coal miners in South Wales. The Cambrian Miners remained the largest of these unions, membership reaching 14,000 by 1885, although this fell to 10,000 by 1893. Retention was good partly because the union worked with colliery clerks to deduct subscriptions directly from members' wages. The union was led by an executive committee, which alone held the ability to order industrial action and determine strike pay. However, a monthly meeting of delegates from each mine made other policy decisions. It supported the \\"sliding scale\\", whereby wages rose and fell in line with the export price of coal, agreed through a joint committee with employers. The Miners' Federation of Great Britain (MFGB) opposed this practice, so the Cambrian Miners did not affiliate to the MFGB. Mabon was elected as the Member of Parliament for Rhondda at the 1885 UK general election, with the sponsorship of the union. In 1896, the union's secretary, William Evans, was also approved as a candidate, but he ultimately did not stand for election. The union's other leading figure was its treasurer, Thomas Davies, owner of a pub in Ton Pentre. In 1892, the union joined a committee, which for the first time brought together those Welsh coal-mining unions which supported the sliding scale, and those which did not, and in 1893 Mabon was appointed as its president. Subsequently, the employers ended the sliding scale in response to the Welsh coal strike of 1898. This led the Cambrian Miners to merge with the other local unions, forming the South Wales Miners' Federation. The area covered by the Cambrian Miners' Association became the No. 1 District of the new federation.

He is best remembered as the founder of The Atlanta Constitution. During a lifetime divided in nearly equal measure between the states of South Carolina, Georgia, and Texas, Styles, a veteran of two wars, developed a reputation for finding his way into political frays and military adventurisms. He was briefly a member of the Georgia Senate, after having killed a Georgia State Representative earlier in his career. Early years and education Carey W. Styles was born October 7, 1825, near Spartanburg, South Carolina, the son of Gabriel and Rebecca Farrow Smith Styles. He spent his early years on his father's plantation, which prospered from cotton farming and cattle. In 1846, when he was 21 years old, Styles enlisted in the Palmetto Regiment of the South Carolina Volunteers, to fight in the Mexican–American War. His regiment suffered heavy casualties in fierce fighting around Chapultepec, where Styles distinguished himself, as one of only two survivors from his unit. He was awarded a silver medal by the state of South Carolina, and discharged in June 1848, with the rank of Sergeant. Returning to his home, Styles read the law and was admitted to the bar. He established a law practice in Edgefield. On November 23, 1852, Styles married Frances Jean Evans. The couple had two children, Louisa Gabriella (Vincent) (1853), and Frank Evan Styles (1856). Journalism While living in Edgefield, Styles became convinced that a railroad was needed to link Columbia, South Carolina, with Augusta, Georgia. In an effort to bring the matter to public attention, and to rally support for the proposal, Styles began publishing a pro-railroad weekly newspaper, the Edgefield Informer. It marked the beginning of a career in journalism that would consume Styles for the rest of his life. It also marked the decline of his interest in the practice of law. In 1857, Styles moved the family to Brunswick, Georgia. It is unknown what prompted the move. The city was developing a seaport, which held the promise of business opportunities. More likely, however, Styles was attracted to the area by a series of recent events which pitted powerful interests, headed by state representative Jacob Moore, against the common citizenry. Moore, and others, had managed to persuade the Georgia General Assembly to pass legislation giving them control over significant amounts of local real estate. The resulting civil strife, as one writer noted, left the citizens of Brunswick in \\"need of a defender\\". Styles quickly became embroiled in the dispute, siding with the citizenry. He announced his intention to run for mayor, and organized a mass protest rally for the evening of December 24. In spite of bad weather, a crowd gathered at the protest point, where Styles delivered an impassioned speech against the powerful interests, and the legislative act giving them the power to seize local property. Styles called the legislation \\"dishonorable\\", at which point Moore (the bill's sponsor and beneficiary) jumped to his feet and shouted at Styles, calling the accusation a \\"falsehood\\". In the files of the Glynn County courthouse, still preserved, is recorded testimony of what next transpired. Styles is said to have yelled back at Moore, saying \\"You are a damned liar!\\", to which Moore replied \\"You are a damneder liar!\\". A brief exchange of gunfire left Moore mortally wounded. Witness accounts had Moore firing first, and though Styles was subsequently arrested for manslaughter, the charges were eventually dropped. On March 1, 1858, Styles was elected mayor of Brunswick. After finishing his term as mayor, Styles moved the family inland to nearby Waresboro, then the county seat of Ware County, prior to the establishment of Waycross. There, he opened a law office and announced plans to publish a weekly newspaper, the Georgia Forester. In 1861, Styles was elected as a delegate from Ware County to the Georgia Secession Convention where, along with the other delegate from Ware, Col. William Angus McDonald, Styles voted to secede. Sensing a story, and historic events in the making, Styles proceeded to Charleston, South Carolina, where he was able to attach himself to the Hagood Regiment staff. This provided Styles with an insider knowledge of events, and first hand view of the Battle of Fort Sumter. After the fall of the fort, Styles returned to Georgia, where he enlisted in the 2nd Georgia Volunteers, and organized the Wiregrass Minutemen in Savannah, later designated as Company L, 26th Regiment, Georgia Volunteer Infantry, Army of Northern Virginia. Styles was elected Captain of the company. He was commissioned Colonel in August 1861, and placed in charge of the coastal defense of Georgia, commanding a force of 4,000. Styles latter transferred to an artillery battalion and participated in the Battle of Atlanta. After the war, Styles ran unsuccessfully for Congress, while living in Brooks County, Georgia. After the loss, Styles moved to Albany, Georgia, where he once again founded a newspaper, the Albany News. In the early years following the war, Styles took great exception to the Radical Reconstruction program then in force, and advocated for a more moderate response based on his interpretation of Georgia's rights under the Constitution. Styles backed \\"constitutional reconstruction\\" advanced by Benjamin H. Hill and sought support for the idea from the national Democratic party. =The Atlanta Constitution= It was in this period of political strife that Styles made his next bold move. While on a trip to Atlanta in May 1868, to meet with Democratic party leaders, Styles took measure of the contemporary Atlanta newspapers, and found them lacking. Styles believed them to be little more than organs for the Radical Republican reconstruction agenda. He resolved to bring a paper aligned with the Democratic party viewpoint to the Atlanta market, one supporting his constitutional reconstruction ideals. On May 9 he announced that he had obtained the necessary financial backing to purchase the Daily Opinion. On June 16, 1868 the \\"new Democratic daily\\" (as he described it) printed its first edition, under the name The Constitution. Ownership of the paper was divided between Styles and the two financial backers, James H. Anderson and future Atlanta mayor William A. Hemphill. A later observer noted that \\"all the newspaper experience was vested in Styles\\". Hemphill eventually settled into the position of business manager, a position he held until 1901. Styles' tenure at the paper that would eventually become The Atlanta Constitution would be brief. Unable to pay for his portion of the purchase, when the sale of his Albany News fell through, Styles was forced to surrender his interest in the paper to his joint venture partners. Styles' last contribution to The Constitution was on December 5, 1868. On the wall of the editorial office, Col. Styles left his sword, and on his desk he left his pen. The new editor, James R. Barrick, honored Styles with a poem: \\"The Sword and the Pen\\". In 1870, Anderson sold his one half interest in the paper to Col. E. Y. Clarke. Legislative service Styles returned to Albany as editor of the News. In 1872, he was elected to the Georgia Senate in an ironic turn of events, having killed a member of the Georgia House of Representatives in his earlier years. While a member of the Georgia General Assembly, Styles advocated for an unpopular cause. Public opinion overwhelmingly supported an attempt to repudiate bonds issued by the State, during the Bullock administration. Styles took an opposite position, arguing that value had been received, and that the bonds were \\"honest debts\\" of the state and should be paid. Passions on this issue ran high, and Styles nearly had another \\"personal encounter\\" with a political opponent, as well as the editor of the Atlanta Herald. But the prospect of a duel never materialized. Return to journalism After his legislative service, Styles sold the Albany newspaper in 1876 and returned to Atlanta as editor of the Georgia Daily Commonwealth and later as publisher of the Atlanta Telegraph. Both failed. Styles next tried his hand at the Gainesville Eagle, but that also failed. Whereupon Styles fell back on his legal training, establishing a law practice in Canton, Georgia. But the siren song of journalism called him back to Brunswick in November 1879, where he established himself as the editor of the weekly Seaport Appeal. After that newspaper floundered, Styles moved the family to Texas in 1881. =Texas= In Texas, over the next 16 years, except for a brief period when he was managing editor of the Birmingham Herald, Styles continued his journalistic ways, as editor, managing editor, or special writer for \\"more than a dozen Texas dailies and weeklies\\". Death and legacy Carey Wentworth Styles died at his home in Stephenville, Texas on February 23, 1897, and is buried in West End Cemetery. In 1945, an investigative reporter from The Atlanta Constitution contacted Styles' grandson, while researching an article on the paper's founder. The grandson was able to locate numerous trunks of papers and other material, in an attic, which were later donated to Emory University in Atlanta, becoming the University's Carey Wentworth Styles collection. In the late 2010s, Styles' silver Mexican-American War medal, which was either misplaced or lost to one of Styles' many creditors during his lifetime, was sold in an online auction. Other Styles war mementos and papers are retained in a collection held by the University of Texas at Arlington Special Collections archive.

Early life Mayhew was born Nell Cole Danely in Astoria, Illinois on April 17, 1875. She was the eldest child of Alfred M. Danley, a Methodist minister, and Ella (Cole) Danely. As a child she showed an early interest and aptitude for art. When she was sixteen, one of her paintings was accepted for the Art Institute of Chicago's Annual Exhibition of Watercolors by American Artists. Education and personal life Mayhew attended Northwestern University, graduating in 1897. She continued her art studies at the University of Illinois, between 1901 and 1906 as a student of Newton A. Wells. While in central Illinois, she met Sidney Brooker, editor of the Quincy, Illinois newspaper. They married in 1902. Brooker died six months later, but she continued to use his name in her signature throughout her career. In 1905 she began taking classes at the Art Institute of Chicago. Her teachers included John Johansen and John Vanderpoel. She married Leonard Thomas Mayhew in 1911. They had two daughters though the marriage ended in 1926. Career While studying at the University of Illinois, Mayhew developed the color etching process with which she is so closely identified. She created paintings on paper by incorporating etching techniques with the monotype process, making colored prints with the same plate but varying the colors and amount of ink. A critic described her work in 1912, \\"Now and again you are perplexed to know whether you are looking at a painting or a print\\". Seeking a fresh start after the death of her first husband and having completed training at the Art Institute of Chicago, Mayhew moved to Los Angeles in 1908 and began exhibiting soon after. She exhibited regularly in the southern California area from 1908 through 1935, including from 1908 to 1927 at the Blanchard Gallery in Los Angeles. In 1909 she received a medal for color etching at the Alaska-Yukon Exhibition in Seattle. She taught privately, at the Chouinard Art Institute and in 1910, she joined the College of Fine Arts at the University of Southern California, Garvanza campus as a faculty member. Mayhew found inspiration for her work in nature. Her favorite recreation was gardening. In the late 1910s, she traveled with her daughters to sketch the last surviving Spanish missions. While the California Mission series subject matter was architectural, Mayhew took note of the landscape as she drove from the south to the north of the state. Mayhew advocated for the value of beauty in one's life, writing an article in California Southland and a letter to the editor in the Los Angeles Times. In the early 1930s she founded an art rental business. which was announced on the front page of a local newspaper. She died in Highland Park, California.

David Rotenberg has been referred to as one of Canada's \\"most notable acting teachers and coaches,\\" and may be the nation's best known master acting teacher. During the formative part of his career, he was a theatre director in New York City and staged two Broadway shows, returning to Toronto in 1987. In 1994, he directed the first Canadian play to be staged in the People's Republic of China, which inspired his career as a novelist, beginning with the five Zhong Fong mysteries set in modern Shanghai as well as the historical fiction novel Shanghai. After writing a series of speculative thrillers set in The Junction, Toronto, He began a science fiction series in 2017. Early life and education David Charles Rotenberg was born and raised in Toronto, with three brothers (Lawrence, Robert (Bobby), and Matthew) sons of Jewish parents Dr. Cyril Rotenberg, a physician, and Gertrude Ruth (Gertie) Rotenberg, described as a \\"woman of initiative, of new ideas and steady values.\\" David Rotenberg attended the University of Toronto and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts. He left Toronto in 1971. Younger brother Robert studied at the University of Toronto, Osgoode Hall and the London School of Economics, ultimately forging careers as both a criminal lawyer and a crime novelist. Career =Theatre director and graduate work (1971–1987)= David Rotenberg went to British Columbia, teaching and setting up the acting programme at Simon Fraser University, staging a production of Bertholt Brecht's Baal in 1973. Rotenberg moved to the US, where he lived for fourteen years. He pursued graduate studies at the Yale Drama School, obtaining his Master of Fine Arts degree in 1976, specializing in directing. He lived ten years in New York City, with lots of freelance directing, plenty of regional theatre, and two Broadway shows: The News, and The 1940's Radio Hour. Having lived in Manhattan for many years, its influence continued to form the base for some of his work even after returning to Canada. Rotenberg moved further south, to New Orleans, where he was on the faculty of Tulane University. York University \\"lured him back to Toronto\\" with a job he \\"could not turn down\\". On a more personal level, Rotenberg moved back to Toronto because he wanted to be closer to his parents and three brothers, and he felt Toronto was a good place to raise children. =Acting teacher and international director (1987- )= Rotenberg made the move back to Toronto in 1987, where he began to teach graduate students. He had expected also to resume his directing career in his hometown, but he got a rude awakening, recalling: \\"I was effectively shunned,\\" and was told to forget directing in Canada; there was no directing work, and he did not know why: \\"Perhaps if I'd gone to, let's say, Czechoslovakia to work, I'd have come home hailed as a hero. But that Broadway stint seemed to rankle those who were handing out directing jobs here.\\" > I was a professional theatre director ... with two Broadway shows to my > credit, dozens of regional theatre credits and I ran a major American > regional theatre so it was a bit of shock to me when I returned to Canada, > where I'd been born and raised, to find that the Canadian theatre community > wanted nothing to do with me. Apparently I was a traitor. If I had spent > twenty minutes directing in Eastern Europe rather than twenty years > directing in America I believe I would have been welcomed back by the > Canadian theatre with open arms. Shanghai Theatre Academy Rotenberg continued occasionally to direct plays and television in Canada and abroad. In 1994, he received a call asking if he would be interested in directing a play to be produced in Shanghai, in Mandarin. Rotenberg imagined they wanted Shakespeare or a modern master, but it turned out to be Canadian George Ryga's The Ecstasy of Rita Joe: \\"Apparently, Ryga's play was the only Canadian play they had at hand in translation ... They wanted a Canadian director with varied skills and solid street creds, and someone who could work with students.\\" Rotenberg accepted the engagement to put on the production at the Shanghai Theatre Academy, the first Canadian play to be produced in translation in China with a Chinese cast and creative team. In 2012, Rotenberg recalled that on arrival, he was told \\"You must remember that you can always be replaced\\". The Ecstasy of Rita Joe is a contemporary story about a young First Nation woman who leaves the reserve for the big city, but the subject matter was not understood by the Chinese: \\"They didn't comprehend it at all ... When the set designs arrived, there were Indians with head dresses and war paint.\\" Despite such cultural differences and working in a completely foreign language, the production was nevertheless a \\"limited success.\\" Tatiana Maslany Other teaching projects and screen coaching In 2000, David Rotenberg, together with David Julian Hirsh and entertainment lawyer Michael Levine, sent a proposal to the Canadian Film Centre to create a high-level training program modelled on New York's Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute and on British companies that were training actors who could cross between stage and screen. Eight years later, the CFC announced the creation of a new actor's conservatory to train and market future stars of screen and stage, the first of its kind in Canada, as well as a separate international co-production training program, the Canada-U.K. Script Incubation Program, designed to foster cross-Atlantic collaboration between script writers with support from the BBC and CanWest. Rachel McAdams Scott Speedman In the meantime, in 2004, Rotenberg had founded the Professional Actors Lab, Canada's most successful actor training program, with nearly 200 actors per term. For some time, two evenings a week, he has also been teaching a group of about a dozen hand-picked students in a small room \\"tucked into the basement\\" of St. Anne's Parish Hall, in Toronto's West End: Equity Showcase Theatre's Acting for the Camera class. Between the three institutions in which he has been directly involved, Rotenberg typically has spent between 25 and 40 hours every week training and prepping actors. At any given time, Rotenberg was working personally with about 75 actors: \\"Hundreds of his St. Anne's alumni currently work full-time on projects in Los Angeles, New York City, Toronto and Vancouver.\\" Among them are Canadian actors Tatiana Maslany, Rachel McAdams, Scott Speedman, Sarah Gadon, Ennis Esmer, Patrick J. Adams, David Julian Hirsh, Jonas Chernick, Shawn Doyle, Polly Shannon, and Demore Barnes. Many travel back to Toronto for Rotenberg's advice. Rotenberg has also taught at the National Theatre School of Canada, the University of Cape Town, and Princeton, and regularly teaches professional classes in other cities in North America. He served as acting coach for My Secret Identity and Friday the 13th: The Series and as a private acting coach for the new Kung Fu on CBS. Theory of acting and pedagogical technique Ennis Esmer Rotenberg's teaching approach began with an observation: > There had been almost no serious intellectual thought given to how the form > actually works. And actors had bought into the mediocrity that had been fed > to them. Actors had actually agreed to call what they do a craft rather than > an art. But surely an actor who plays Laertes in a production of Hamlet has > way more to do with the success or failure of the evening than the third > violinist has to do with the success or failure of a Beethoven symphony. > Yet, you would never hear a violist refer to what they do as a craft—never! > So I started changing that, inventing new ways for actors to understand > their art... In the parish hall basement, Rotenberg would quietly observe as his students videotaped themselves performing short scenes in pairs or on their own, gathering around a television set to watch the tape afterwards, and he would step in, offering blunt but constructive criticism of their scene, at the same time protecting their fragile egos with his humour - and his acuity as a teacher. One of his students, having worked with Rotenberg for six years, often travelling home from Los Angeles to take his classes, said Rotenberg is \\"great at making us see our strengths and weaknesses.\\" =Author (1998- )= The \\"shunning\\" Rotenberg felt from the Toronto theatrical community pushed him toward writing, both film scripts, at least five of which have been optioned by film companies, stage plays, such as his adaptation of The Great Gatsby, which he directed at both York and Penn State University, and his highly successful novels. In his words, \\"this shunning sent me to writing, so it worked out for the best.\\" An early example is his original screenplay Ambition's Debt, which he was also minded to direct using only Canadian talent to fill the credits. Novels Rotenberg was inspired to write his first novel after his time with the Shanghai Theatre Academy, at a time when China was going through a \\"massive transition from a profoundly oppressive socialist state to a basically free market economy – a thrilling time.\\" It set the stage for his critically acclaimed first novel, the thriller The Shanghai Murders (1998), followed by four more in his mystery series: The Lake Ching Murders (2001), The Hua Shan Hospital Murders (shortlisted for the Arthur Ellis Award for the best crime novel of 2003), The Hamlet Murders (2004) and The Golden Mountain Murders (2005). The five Zhong Fong novels have \\"legions of fans around the world,\\" and the series is reported as having been optioned for film and television (HBO). Shanghai, viewed from The Bund, the principal setting of the Zhong Fong series. Just before The Golden Mountain Murders was published, the author received a lunch invitation from Penguin Canada publisher David Davidar and assumed that they would be discussing a sixth Zhong Fong novel, but Davidar had other ideas: \\"They wanted me to do for Shanghai what James Clavell had done for Hong Kong.\\" The end result was Shanghai: The Ivory Compact (2008, \\"just in time for the Beijing Games\\"), his critically acclaimed epic novel spanning thousands of years. Rotenberg wrote it as three novels, and counts them as such, but Penguin decided to publish it in one volume. At about 800,000 words, it is one of the longest novels ever published; Rotenberg said he received complaints from readers that it was \\"too heavy for them to carry around\\". The success of Shanghai, according to Stephen Patrick Clare, demonstrated that Rotenberg could \\"break away from convention without loosening his hold on the imagination of his readers.\\" The novel has been reported as being optioned by Darius Films and by Jane McLean for television. Dundas and Keele, The Junction, Toronto, initial and final setting of The Junction Chronicles. For his next novel series, The Junction Chronicles, Rotenberg moved away from the Shanghai setting in favour of The Junction, the Toronto neighbourhood where he grew up and to which he later returned, as, \\"it was finally time to look around and try to write about home.\\" While the primary setting for the series is The Junction, a lot of the action in the first novel, The Placebo Effect (2012), takes place in New York, where Rotenberg also lived for many years. Robert J. Wiersema called it a \\"somewhat workmanlike\\" thriller \\"possessed of an enthralling undercurrent that allows it to transcend its genre and shine on its own terms\\", and that Rotenberg \\"reveals a surprising depth and intricacy, not in the mechanics of his plot, but at the level of characterization.\\" The same year, Peter Worthington included Rotenberg \\"among the best writers of their genre [the thriller,] in the English-speaking world today\\". The trilogy has been optioned by producer Don Kurt for television. In a 2012 interview, Rotenberg said he had been working on another trilogy for ten years, titled The Dream Navigators. Five years later, the first book of his third novel series, The Dream Chronicles, set in the future, was published by iBooks in 2017, followed by the second in 2019. Projects in development In 2008, Rotenberg talked about books he was either working on or considering: a sixth Zhong Fong novel, a sequel to Shanghai set in post-Second World War Shanghai, contingent on a return visit to the city for more research; and a who's who of Canadian acting talent who have studied with Rotenberg over the years. Influences and writing process In the 2012 interview, when asked who his literary influences were, Rotenberg listed John Le Carré, Jack Miles, James Lee Burke, Thomas Cahill, Harlan Ellison, William Boyd, Annie Proulx, K.C. Constantine, and James Crumley, as well as playwright Robert Litz, who approached him in New York to work on a screenplay together, and a \\"junior high school English teacher named Mr. Gallanders ... who encouraged me to read and write.\\" He went on to include Aaron Sorkin and Bob Dylan, \\"especially when he's not singing his songs.\\" As his first five novels were police procedurals, he purposefully had his writing space cluttered with images and books: \\"two large modern desks at right angles to each other — the whole thing dominated by a large computer monitor. It felt that the job was to produce order from the chaos — just as police officers must.\\" For The Junction Chronicles, he felt he needed a different kind of workspace for a different kind of literary work, \\"spare — filled with leaps in time and space, often defying normal rules of storytelling\\", pushing the boundaries: \\"Here the job has to do with entering blank spaces — creating from whole cloth.\\" It took him seven weeks and three days of \\"intense looking\\" to find the desk for his new office. Made from reclaimed wood, and only a foot and a half deep and about four and half feet long, it is \\"a piece of art in and of itself.\\" The desk has no drawers or file cabinets nor in and out trays, just a small laptop. \\"Even the hard copies of what I've written ... kept in a book shelf out of the room.\\" Theory of novel authorship and sources of inspiration Rotenberg never considered writing his novels as stage- or screenplays, as he thinks of the novel as the \\"mother\\" of all genres: \\"A novel that makes sense is somehow more satisfying to me than a three-act play, and not as contrived or as constrained as a movie script. And my primary interest as a writer is in character rather than plot.\\" Teaching acting has been an important aspect of his writing, an \\"anchor\\": > I learn a lot from talented actors every week. Their insights and dedication > are extraordinary and a great many of them are avid readers, often chiding > me to get on with the next book because they've waited long enough to find > out what the hung boy is about or why there are so many churches along > Annette Street or will Yslan and Decker ever get together. As well, Rotenberg's characters and their exceptional talents are often drawn from his students: > When I teach acting, periodically I come across people who really do have > special gifts. There are people you can see are working their butts off, but > you're never sure they're going to make more than the grade ... They are > generally people who are instinctively in touch with deeper spiritual > currents. Finally, Rotenberg's principal career path has had a more straightforward influence on his writing: > I've been asked for years to write a book about the unique way that I teach > acting. But every time I've sat down at my computer I've wanted to write > fiction, not a how-to book, so instead I've integrated my knowledge of > acting teaching into my novels. Geoffrey Hyland in two of the five Shanghai > mysteries has come to Shanghai to direct a production of Twelfth Night (I've > directed it twice myself) and Decker Roberts, the lead in the Junction > Chronicles series ... actually teaches in the acting studio that I started > in Toronto—Pro Actors Lab. Canadian crime stories, whodunits and thrillers have been increasing in popularlity since the turn of the 21st century, a market previously dominated by British, American, and more recently, Scandinavian novelists. David Rotenberg believes Canadians have had time to avoid mistakes other crime and mystery writers have made: \\"The Brits and Scandinavians are less interested in social context than we are ... The whodunit aspect interests me less than the social and historical forces at work in a mystery story. Hamlet would be just another whodunit if you stripped it of context, and it would have nothing important to say.\\" Personal life Rotenberg has resided in Toronto since his return from the US in 1987, in The Junction, with his wife Susan Santiago, a Puerto Rican American. They have two adult children, both dual citizens, Elizabeth Sara (Beth) and Joe, after whom he named his production company, \\"Joe and Beth and She and Me Productions Ltd.\\" Beth was born only a few months after Rotenberg's move back to Toronto. She also writes, and her father expressed an interest in working with her on a project in the 2012 interview. One of his three brothers, Robert Rotenberg is a criminal lawyer and former magazine editor and an author of legal thrillers. Agent Michael Levine represents both authors. His mother and father passed in 1999 and 2009, respectively.

Photo taken on July 6th 2019. In Hammond, Indiana, where 165th Street meets the border of Gary, a barrier or dike was constructed in the early 1980s to keep toxic flood water out. The once controversial barrier remains there to this day.  History  In June 1981, excessive rainfall caused flooding in the Calumet Region of Indiana and Illinois.Hutton, Carole Leigh (June 15, 1981). \\"Floods Kill 2: Scores Homeless\\". The Times (Munster, Indiana). p. 1. The Little Calumet River overflowed onto streets and Interstate 80.\\"Northwest Indiana Flooded\\". United Press International. The Daily Reporter (Greenfield, Indiana). p. 1. Parts of Gary, Hammond, and other areas were evacuated. The floods swept through two industrial landfills and caused toxic water to flow into the residential Hessville area of Hammond.\\"EPA Starting Probe on 'Chemical Flood'\\". The Times (Munster, Indiana). June 24, 1981. p. 2. The toxic water caused basements and streets to flood, and about 30 people suffered chemical burns. In order to stop the flooding, Hammond officials built a sand dike on 165th Street, under Cline Avenue, along the Hammond-Gary border.\\"Little Cal Peril Stalls: Rainfall's Impact Mild\\". The Times (Munster, Indiana). p. 1, 8. Several days later, the City of Hammond built a concrete wall across 165th Street to reinforce the sand dike, which had been eroding from people driving motorcycles and four-wheel drive vehicles over it.Finn, Thomas (July 2, 1981). \\"Dump Flow Results Are Near\\". The Times (munster, Indiana). p. 3. Hammond's air pollution control director said the wall was a temporary solution and would be removed when the danger of chemical runoff ended. To Hammond officials and citizens, the majority of whom are white, the hill was a win-win. In 1988, Hammond Mayor Thomas McDermott Sr. said, \\"After seven years, people on this side just like the idea of the street being closed. There is less truck traffic and less crime.\\" In his campaign, Hammond City Council President Robert Golec promised to keep the wall and suggested making it permanent. The citizens and officials of Gary, the majority of whom are African American, saw it as a symbol of racism and called for it to be removed almost as soon as it went up. Mayor Richard Hatcher called it \\"an insult to every citizen in Gary\\" and ordered city workers to tear down the wall six months after its construction. This led to Hammond workers reconstructing the wall entirely on Hammond property. During his successful campaign for Gary Mayor in 1987, Thomas Barnes promised to remove the wall 30 days after his inauguration. In 1989, the federal government called for Hammond and Gary to develop an alternative to the wall or face reduced transportation funding. Alternatives were developed by engineers of both cities, but Hammond refused to cooperate due to the perceived high cost and impracticality of a new infrastructure project. There was also disagreement about who would pay for the new project; one of the cities or the Federal government. The furor appeared to have ceased in the 1990s as discussions of an alternative to the barrier stopped and Gary changed leadership. Sometime in the 2010s, the dirt hill was replaced by a brick wall that remains to this day.  An Additional Controversial Barrier  A curb opposed by Calumet City was built by Hammond in 2006, north of 166th Place in order to restrict vehicular traffic between the two towns. Calumet City sued but lost its legal battle to block construction. In 2008, Mayor Thomas McDermott Jr. built a 4-foot by 2-foot wall south of the earlier one that leads up to the little Calumet River, ostensibly for flood control. \\"It's a quality of life issue,\\" Mayor Thomas McDermott told the Chicago Tribune at the time. \\"A lot has been made of race. It has nothing to do with that. It has to do with traffic.\\" Calumet City Mayor Michelle Markiewicz Qualkinbush told the Tribune in 2006, \\"It's unfortunate it's come to this. These two communities have co-existed side by side for many years. They'll be here many more years after we're gone, and this, it just sends a bad message.\\" https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/daily-southtown/opinion/ct-sta-slowik- hammond-barrier-st-0611-20170609-story.html References Northwest Indiana .

Final Transmission is Cave In's first studio album in eight years since 2011's White Silence and marks the final recordings of bassist Caleb Scofield, who died in a car crash a year prior to the album's release. The band promoted the album with online streams of \\"All Illusion\\" and \\"Shake My Blood\\" prior to its release.  Background  Since their last studio album, White Silence (2011), the members of Cave In would spend the ensuing eight years occupied with other musical endeavors. Stephen Brodsky formed the progressive hardcore punk band Mutoid Man in 2012, Adam McGrath and John-Robert Conners formed the psychedelic punk/noise rock band Nomad Stones, while Caleb Scofield continued working with Old Man Gloom and Zozobra. Other attributing factors to the eight-year gap between studio releases included Brodsky moving to New York, and difficulty agreeing creatively on what a new album should sound like. Cave In was more interested in \\"hanging out, get-togethers, parties and camping trips\\" as friends than working on a new album as members of a band, though new album discussions were taking place over the years. Cave In began gathering for warm-up \\"jam sessions\\" in late 2017 and early 2018. In February 2018, the band formally began writing new material that would become their follow-up album to White Silence. After a full weekend of writing and recording in Massachusetts, Scofield drove back home to his family in New Hampshire. On that trip on March 28, 2018 Scofield got into a fatal car crash. The surviving members of Cave In put the new album on hold in favor of touring in honor of Scofield and raising funds for this family – a wife and two kids. Major memorial performances included a Boston show with Converge, a Los Angeles show with a one-off reunion of Isis and an acoustic performance with Brodsky and McGrath at Roadburn Festival – the latter of which was recorded and released as Live At Roadburn Festival 2018 – Tribute to Caleb Scofield. In January 2019, Cave In announced it would be releasing a new album featuring finished tracks from their 2018 sessions with Scofield.  Recording and composition  The tracks that appear on Final Transmission were originally recorded as demos that weren't intended to be publicly released. All songs were recorded live to hand-held four-track tape with minor digital additions of drums or guitars. The rough tracks were later polished and completed with mixing by Andrew Schneider and mastering by James Plotkin. McGrath said of the recording process: \\"It was very haphazard, and we didn't go into this thinking they were going to be released the way it is today. We were lucky enough to have Andrew Schneider go through everything and make it sound way better than we could have ever imagined.\\" Cave In's previous album White Silence was also recorded in a practice space, and McGrath noted that Scofield was hoping to not repeat that for the next album and record it in a proper studio. The band described the sound of the album as featuring \\"glimpses of past Cave In eras\\" from Jupiter (2000) through White Silence, which was a direction Scofield influenced. Recalling email correspondences between Scofield about the new material, Brodsky said \\"He was really digging the stuff that was spacey, heavy, a little bit weird, but with very pretty melodies and hooks. I think he was encouraging us to embrace what we've always been good at and what sets us apart from our contemporaries.\\" All tracks on Final Transmission include contributions from Scofield, including guitar, bass and vocals. The opening/title track of the album includes a voice memo from Scofield that he sent to his band members about a new song idea after their final writing session. McGrath said it was difficult to listen to the recording, and continued: \\"We were surprised to get it from him, actually, but we thought it was great. And that was it. In a weird way, it's the end of the story as far as our relationship together.\\" The closing track \\"Led to the Wolves\\" was largely composed by Scofield. The members of Cave In had emotional difficulty revisiting the demos and completing the album. On this topic, Brodsky said: \\"I don't think I've cried so much putting together any record [...] I don't try to look too deeply into how these things work, but these recordings are some of our last moments spending time with [Caleb].\\" At the time of the album's announcement, McGrath said he hadn't listened to the album all the way through yet. He said: \\"I feel really lucky to have this record. I love it, but I don't like listening to it. I'm sure I'll listen to it eventually, but right now it's difficult. Just hearing him play kills me. I'll miss him forever.\\" The lyrics and vocals for the track \\"Shake My Blood\\" were performed by all three surviving members of Cave In after the death of Scofield, which Brodsky said was the first time he was able to express his feelings in song form. He said: \\"It's a mix of extreme grief, frustration and anger. I was trying to do something to gain the clearest answer about whatever the next move might be.\\" The title Final Transmission refers to this being the final release to include Scofield's contributions. When asked in an interview if the title could be a double entendre that also refers to this being the final album from Cave In, McGrath said he was unsure. He elaborated: \\"It was nice to get out there and play a few shows, but we're still going through the process of moving forward. I think we need to live through this first, [and] then we'll have an idea of what the future holds.\\"  Release  Cave In will release Final Transmission on June 7, 2019 though Hydra Head Records. Hydra Head has released the majority of Cave In's releases to date since 1997, but has been largely inactive since 2012. Half of all proceeds from album sales will go to Scofield's family. Before deciding to finish and release their 2018 demos as Final Transmission, Cave In struggled with how they wanted to continue. According to Brodsky, McGrath suggested they should do whatever they could to support the Scofield family, which was a \\"sobering moment\\" that \\"helped to start clear the fog of how to climb out of the depths of what we were experiencing.\\" Cave In began promoting Final Transmission with an online stream of \\"All Illusion\\" on April 8, 2019. The track was selected to be the first release because it features Scofield's only lyrical contribution to the album. \\"All Illusion\\" originally had lyrics written entirely by Brodsky, but Cave In found some lyrics in Scofield's journal and incorporated them into the song. On May 14, Cave In made \\"Shake My Blood\\" available for online streaming.  Reception  On the review aggregator website Metacritic, Final Transmission has a score of 82 out of 100 based on 7 reviews, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Many reviewers noted the record's background, with Kerrang!s Nick Ruskell stating that \\"as a tribute, it is wonderful,\\" though he also notes that the album is \\"superb\\" without taking it into consideration. Writing for Under the Radar, Adam Turner-Heffer did comment that the album could've been made better had Scofield been present to give the band more time to complete it. Critics also draw out similarities Final Transmission has with the band's previous output such as Jupiter. The album was featured on Bandcamps \\"Bandcamp Daily\\" section on June 14, 2019.

The novel covers the life of Belton Piedmont, an educated and disciplined black man in the Jim Crow south and his role in a shadow government of black men operated out of a college in Waco, Texas.  Plot  Belton Piedmont is a born to a poor but hardworking family in Virginia and grows up intimately familiar with racism and segregation. He attends school with another black child, Bernard Belgrave, whom he builds a rivalry and friendship with. Belton and Bernard's educations take radically different turns when Bernard goes to Harvard while Belton is too poor to attend a prestigious university. Belton's graduation speech is published in a Richmond newspaper and it catches the attention of a southern democrat who vehemently opposes lynching, Mr. V.M. King. King takes a liking to Belton and gives him a check that will take him through college, but not before giving Belton some sage advice. With King's aid, Belton attends a college in Nashville, Tennessee. Belton is perturbed when he discovers that even in the seemingly egalitarian school, there are black professors that are silently ostracized and barred from eating meals with their white counterparts. Belton organizes a movement of civil disobedience and daunts the school's president into changing things. After Belton graduates, he is harassed by a mob after encouraging black men to vote. The mob goes to lynch him, even shooting him in the head, but the bullet is caught in Belton's skin and only leaves him unconscious. He's claimed by a doctor who wishes to dissect his body, but Belton awakens on the table and kills the doctor in self-defense. Belton flees and is eventually arrested for murder. The trial goes poorly when many of the jurors are from the mob that lynched him. But Belton's case reaches the attention of Bernard who uses his political connections to appeal Belton's verdict. Belton later contacts Bernard asking him to come to Waco, Texas without any more explanation. Bernard agrees to come to his friend. Belton reveals the existence of the Imperium in Imperio, a shadow state consisting of black men aiming to counteract segregation and to protect blacks in the south from persecution and violence. Belton and others in the Imperium believe that Bernard could be their George Washington. Bernard is eventually elected president of the Imperium and they concoct a plan to infiltrate the United States Navy and use it to protect a new nation they plan to form in the heart of Texas. Belton opposes this plan, still holding onto his belief in the United States and that it would be wrong to betray the nation. He remains committed to the goal of improving the states rather than seceding and tenders his resignation from the Imperium, knowing full well that he'll be executed by his peers for attempting to leave. The members of the Imperium attempt to allow Belton to escape his sentence, but Belton refuses. Bernard and the Imperium execute Belton for his treason. The novel opens with a confession from Berl Trout, a member of the Imperium who declares himself a traitor to his race, and an explication of the events surrounding Belton and the Imperium. After Belton's death, Trout writes that he was moved by Belton's convictions and betrays the Imperium, revealing its existence to the world and leaving it to the audience to judge the novel's events.  Characters  * Belton Piedmont – An educated black man and member of the Imperium. Belton is acutely aware of racial discrimination for the whole of his life, but ultimately chooses to pursue integration and advocates peace. He is modeled on Booker T. Washington. * Bernard Belgrave – A schoolmate of Belton's and member of the Imperium. Contrasting with Belton, Bernard is much more militant and strongly advocates a military takeover of Texas.  Publishing  Imperium in Imperio was originally published by the Editor Publishing Company and sold door-to-door, and didn't see much popularity in its printing life.  Reception  The book was one of few novels written around 1900 that had all black major characters, and was \\"virtually unknown to white Americans\\". William Loren Katz, writing in the Journal of Black Studies, concluded that, although the book had \\"implausible and transparent characters and plot,\\" and Griggs had \\"meager talents as a writer and lack of political sophistication and depth,\\" he still \\"managed to capture a neglected but crucial moment and mood in the history of black America.\\" The book was, according to Jack M. Beckham II \\"a relatively obscure work that has been almost completely ignored by critics.\\" However, following a republication by the University Of West Virginia Press in 2003, the book has been the subject of numerous studies, for instance on its portrayal of: \\"oratory, embodiment, and US citizenship\\", collective efficiency, the middle way in the National Baptist Convention, utopia, and black baptist radicalism. Oxford Reference names the novel as \\"one of the most important novels of literary black nationalism.\\"  References   Further reading  * Tess Chakkalakal and Kenneth W.

Early life Miniature of Leeswood Hall, home of the Wynne family Wynne was the eldest son of John Wynne of Leeswood and his first wife Jane Jones, daughter of Humphrey Jones of Halkyn, Flintshire. His mother died in 1703 and his father, who was a poor Welsh country gentleman, remarried Catherine Jones, one of the servants. Wynne succeeded to the Halkyn estate of his mother which then brought about £30 a year. He married Margaret Lloyd, daughter of Evan Lloyd of Tyddyn, Flintshire, on 26 April 1720 against the objection of his father that she had neither fortune nor quality equal to his son. Valuable lead deposits were discovered on the Halkyn estate and after prolonged litigation with his father, Wynne secured control of the estate. His father published a pamphlet in about 1731 entitled “The sufferings of John Wynne of Leeswood, Esq’ accusing his son and father in law of defrauding him of the £22,000 a year yield of the mine. Wynne re-built and re-equipped the family house at Leeswood with no regard to the expense. He was High Sheriff of Flintshire from 1722 to 1724. Career At the 1727 British general election Wynne stood for Flint Boroughs, when there was a double return and the seat was awarded to his opponent. He attached himself to Walpole and campaigned against the strong Tory powerbase in Wales, and was rewarded with a baronetcy on 16 July 1731. At the 1734 British general election he was returned as Member of Parliament for Flint Boroughs in an extremely expensive contest. In Parliament, he was a hard-working Member, taking notes of debates, and regularly voting with the Government. He was appointed Constable of Flint Castle in about 1734, holding the post until 1750. Just before the 1741 British general election Wynne was in dire financial straits as a result of his extravagant expenditure and a fall in income from the lead mines. He made a desperate appeal to Walpole, citing the cost of his campaigns against the Tories, and noting that he was in danger of losing his estate to Watkins Wynne. He was once again returned MP for Flint Boroughs after a hotly contested election and took his seat in the House of Commons. He voted with the Government on the chairman of the elections committee on 16 December 1741. However his opponent petitioned, and he was unseated by the anti-Walpole majority of the House on 22 March 1742. Later life and legacy Within a year it was reported that Wynne's personal estate had been seized for debt and for a time he was imprisoned in the King's Bench Prison. He died intestate and without male heir at his house at Blackheath, on 5 August 1756 and was buried at St Margaret's, Lee on 8 August. His only surviving daughter Margaret, wife of Richard Hill Waring of Hayes, Shropshire, inherited the Leeswood estate but died without issue in 1793. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by special remainder by his brother John.

Reception Sharov's novels were met with controversy in the Russian literary world, especially the publication of Before and During, some critics rejected the philosophy and poetics of Sharov's prose,Vladimir Sharov: Literature That Shines a Light on Dark History by Lucy Harnish, Museum Studies Abroad, November 17, 2018 but all his novels were celebrated in Russia and received several Russian literary awards, including the Russian Booker Prize 2014 for Return to Egypt. Sharov's works have been translated into several languages including Italian, French and English. The English translations of his novels were highly praised by critics. Anna Aslanyan for The Independent noted: “if Russian history is indeed a commentary to the Bible, then Before and During is an audacious attempt to shine a mystical light on it, an unusual take on the twentieth century’s apocalypse that leaves the reader to look for their own explications.”Before and During by Vladimir Sharov, book review: Madness, fantasy and biblical references by Anna Aslanyan, The Independent, February 27, 2014 Caryl Emerson wrote that in Sharov's novels “historical reality, in all its irreversible awfulness, is for a moment scrambled, eroticized, permitted impossible juxtapositions and illuminated by hilarious monologues of the dead.\\" His characters \\"do not make eye contact, but rather talk into the cosmic void.”Not a gift by Caryl Emerson, The Times Literary Supplement, April 9, 2014 Rachel Polonsky for The New York Review of Books stated that “the clarity and directness of Sharov’s prose – wonderfully rendered by Oliver Ready – are disconcerting, almost hallucinatory. His writing is at times funny, at times so piercingly moving, so brimful of unassuaged sorrow, that it causes a double-take. ‘How did I get here?’ Is a question his reader will likely ask again and again.”Highly Magical History by Rachel Polonsky, The New York Review of Books, July 9, 2015 The Los Angeles Review of Books praised the work of the translator:\\"Oliver Ready hears and renders into English many stylistic registers, reminding us that Sharov began creative life as a poet. If it is true ― and I believe it is ― that translation requires the most intimate dialogue possible with another’s consciousness, then Sharov’s rebirth into English in such staggeringly fine prose is the perfect tribute to commemorate the departure of his mortal body.\\"The Children of Catastrophes: On Vladimir Sharov’s “The Rehearsals” By Caryl Emerson, The Los Angeles Review of Books, November 27, 2018 Awards *Russian Booker Prize (2014, Russia) for the novel Return to Egypt *National Literary Award Big Book, 3rd Prize (2014, Russia) for the novel Return to Egypt References External links *Russian Booker Literary Prize official site *„Remembering Writer Vladimir Sharov“ by Oliver Ready August 21, 2018, The Moscow Times. *\\"A Runner and a Ship\\" by Mikhail Shishkin. 1952 births Russian male novelists Russian Jews Russian Booker Prize winners 20th-century Russian writers 21st-century Russian writers Writers from Moscow Russian male essayists 2018 deaths ","title":"Vladimir Sharov"},{"id":"60445504","text":"Mihai Boțilă (born 14 January 1952) is a Romanian wrestler.

Produced by the latter, the film stars Peter Lanzani as Ciro, a criminal who breaks into a 4x4 pickup truck owned by an obstetrician medic Enrique Ferrari (Dady Brieva) in order to steal a car stereo. The truck had a security mechanism that cuts the power, trapping Ciro in the process.  Plot  Ciro (Peter Lanzani) is walking in a neighbourhood in Buenos Aires when he sees a car that gets his interest. He breaks into it and takes the stereo. When he tries to get out, however, he can't open the doors. The owner of the car (Dady Brieva) calls and when Ciro picks up the call, he tells him that the security system that cuts the electric power within the car got triggered and that the car is completely blinded, soundproofed and polarized; so no one will hear or see him crying for help and has no water nor food.  Cast  * Peter Lanzani as Ciro, a low class thug that breaks in into a 4x4 truck * Dady Brieva as Enrique Ferrari, a high-class terminally ill obstetrician who was the victim of several criminal acts and owner of the truck Ciro breaks into * Luis Brandoni as a police mediator * Noelia Castaño * Gustavo Rodríguez  Production  The development of the film began when Cohn was watching TV and found a news about a thief that got trapped in a car he tried to steal in Brazil, and later in Córdoba, Argentina to Roberto Desumvila. The producer and the director looked forward to spark debate about insecurity and its victims and criminals. Cohn and Lanzani deliberately aimed to avoid depicting Ciro as a stereotypical pibe chorro. As per usual in their filmography, Duprat and Cohn read the script with people they knew were alien to the film industry for output. The film was shot in 22 days in a single set at Pol-ka's Estudios Baires. While both Brandoni and Lanzani agreed with the vision the director had, Brieva thought more of the film as the depiction of the alienation both seniors and the lower class citizens suffer in the system and society. The film features a self- reference in the background, in the form of a film poster for a hypothetical The Man Next Door 2: The Neighbour is Back. It was meant to be a simple joke, but when Cohn called Daniel Aráoz to tell him about it, Aráoz asked why not doing it for real and so the screenwriting for the sequel began. Peter Lanzani used Colin Farell and Ryan Reynolds' performances in Phone Booth and Buried as acting reference. In the film, Ciro wears a pink Boca Juniors jersey. Cohn chose this particular jersey for several reasons: to create color contrast with the car's upholstery; because it is Boca's most controversial jersey; and to spark controversy. The film was dedicated to Alejandro Cohn, Mariano's brother who died in 2015.  Release  The movie premiered on 4 April 2019 on 285 screens under distribution of Buena Vista International.

He was an officer in the GRU, known as a scout in Soviet intelligence parlance. Gurevich was a central figure in the anti-Nazi Red Orchestra in France and Belgium during World War II. Gurevich had a number of aliases that he used to disguise his identity. Some of them were Vincente Sierra, Victor Sukolov, Arthus Barcza and Simon Urwith. He also used a number of code names for radio communications, including Kent, Fritz, Manolo, Dupuis and Lebrun. Gurevich ran one of the seven groups of networks that were controlled by Leopold Trepper in France. He was the second leading Soviet agent in Europe during the war years. Upon his return to the Soviet Union in 1945, Gurevich was sentenced for treason and spent 15 years in detention and was rehabilitated in 1990. Life Gurevich was born into a Jewish family in Kharkiv. Both his father and his mother were pharmacists. From 1929 to 1933, he was a member of the paramilitary sports organisation called OSOAVIAKHIM. After that, he was a part of the air defence and later took a communication operator course. In 1933, he enrolled at the Leningrad Institute of Railway Transport where he displayed proficiency for learning languages and translation. He learnt German, French, and English there. On 1 September 1935, he was appointed to a course for training people at the Intourist travel agency. When the Spanish Civil War began, Gurevich volunteered to help. Along with a large group he travelled to Spain and arrived at Cartagena on 30 December 1937. He was appointed as an adjunct translator on submarine C-4 of the Second Spanish Republic, Spanish Republican Navy. In Autumn 1938, Gurevich returned to Moscow. In 1939, he underwent training in the intelligence school of the Main Intelligence Directorate in Moscow. Soviet agent Organisational diagram of members of the Sukolov espionage group On 15 April 1938, Gurevich was ordered by the Soviet Main Intelligence Directorate to travel to France to commence his work as an agent. Disguised as a Mexican tourist, he travelled through Finland, Sweden, Norway and the Netherlands, before finally arriving in France. In Paris, Gurevich changed his passport from a Mexican tourist into a Uruguayan passport. In the same month, he carried out his first operation when he was instructed to travel to Berlin to contact the Luftwaffe officer Harro Schulze-Boysen. Gurevich was ordered to re-establish Shulze-Boysen as an intelligence source and arrange a courier service. Sukolov was given the telephone number of Schulze-Boysen and been ordered to phone him and arrange a meeting somewhere in the city. He was not to meet him at his home, however. When Gurevich phoned, Libertas Schulze- Boysen, the wife of Harro Schulze-Boysen answered. They met on the platform of an underground station, later moving to a cafe where Schulze-Boysen joined them later. In July 1939, Gurevich, posing as the wealthy Vincente Sierra, arrived in Brussels while travelling on a Uruguayan passport that had been issued in New York City on 17 April 1936. The passport gave the holders date and place of birth as 3 July 1911 in Montevideo and his permanent address was Calle Colon 9, Montevideo. On 17 July 1939, Sukolov made contact with Leopold Trepper in Ghent, who at the time was head of the Soviet intelligence network in Belgium. Trepper planned to teach the operation of the Foreign Excellent Raincoat Company to Gurevich. To make contacts in different strata of society, Gurevich started to familiarize himself with Belgium society and studied the country to enable the collection of economic knowledge. Gurevich took part in ballroom dancing and riding lessons and as he travelled between luxury hotels, mail bearing the stamps of Uruguay awaited his arrival. To improve his language skills in French, English and German, Gurevich enrolled at the Free University of Brussels. Gurevich's cryptonym or code name was Kent. His colleagues in Brussels had no idea where the code name has came from, in fact it was the name of fictional British agent character in a book that Gurevich had read when he was a boy called Diary of a spy by N G Smirnov. Although he was industrious, he was generally disliked for a number of reasons, which included being arrogant, and was considered a bit of a bluffer who was known for his socialising and profligate spending which included owning 40 luxury suits in his large apartment in Avenue AJ Sleggers. Trepper viewed both Gurevich and Michail Makarow as the Young Guard and considered both himself and his immediate colleagues including Hillel Katz, the Old Guard Sukolov had never been tested in battle. Gurevich's original instructions were to establish an espionage network in Copenhagen, but in the months leading up to the war, Trepper's plans changed with Sukolov having to be introduced into the Belgian network gradually. He eventually ended up working as an assistant to Trepper and performed the normal bureaucratic operations of an espionage network as a cypher clerk, deciphering instructions from Soviet intelligence, preparing reports from information forwarded from a contact in the Soviet Trade Representation of Belgium. In October 1939, Gurevich visited Daan Goulooze, the director of the Communist Party of the Netherlands (CPN), as a contact to the CPN to build his network and to request assistance. Gurevich asked that a temporary wireless telegraphy link be established for his use and this was provided by Goulooze and used until January 1940. In July 1940, Gurevich again visited Goulooze to request the reserve code that he had received from Soviet intelligence the year before. After the invasion of the Netherlands which ended on 14 May 1940, Gurevich anticipated no difficulties in travelling incognito as an Uruguayan student. Between March and April 1940, Gurevich made a three-week business trip to Switzerland to meet Alexander Radó, a Rote Drei agent to deliver $3000 to finance the Swiss network. During this period, Gurevich was passing intelligence from Schulze-Boysen through his WT station in Brussels. Greta Barcza In May 1940, Gurevich met Margaret \\"Greta\\" Barcza. During the invasion of Belgium when Brussels was being heavily bombed, Barcza met Gurevich while cowering in the cellars at 106 Avenue Émile de Beco in Brussels. Gurevich lived in the same building and one floor above Barcza. At the time, Gurevich was still posing as Uruguayan Vincent Sierra and over several weeks they formed a relationship and eventually became lovers, becoming inseparable which eventually impacted Gurevich's espionage work. In Treppers view, Barcza was a bad influence on Gurevich. In July 1940, when Trepper had to move to France to flee the German advance and start a new French network, he turned the Belgian network over to Gurevich. The network included Michail Makarov, his Wireless Telegraphy operator, who had run a branch of the Foreign Excellent Raincoat Company in Ostend before it was bombed out, that necessitated a move back to Brussels, as well as several couriers and subagents. Gurevich reorganised the network and from that point only referred to Trepper on points of policy. When the Raincoat Company was seized by German soldiers during the invasion into Belgium on 17 May 1940, Gurevich started work to create a replacement organisation, eventually called the Simexco company as a cover for espionage work and was established by March 1941. The firm was established as a genuine business and was even granted telephone and fax facilities by the German authorities providing a regular and privileged way to enable Trepper and Sukolov to communicate. In October 1941, among other assignments, Gurevich was ordered to contact the Harnack/Schulze- Boysen group to restore the connection between the Main Intelligence Directorate and the group. He was ordered to visit Hans Coppi that was the groups' radio operator but was unable to repair the radio. On 13 December 1941, the Gestapo arrested Gurevich's WT operator Anton Danilov in an apartment at 101 rue des Attrebates, Etterbeek in Brussels and Trepper happened to be in Brussels at the time, found out and warned Gurevich of the arrest. Gurevich's first concern was to arrange for Barcza to leave Belgium for France to ensure she was safe. Gurevich arranged travel documents with Abraham Rajchmann, a Polish career criminal who worked for the group. Barcza and her son Rene arrived in France in late December 1941. Gurevich himself hid in the house of Nazarin Drailly, an agent of the Sukolov group, to evade the Gestapo, while Gurevich made arrangements to transfer ownership of the Simexco espionage organisation to Drailly. In the summer of 1942, Trepper evolved a plan to get Barcza to Switzerland and live out the rest of the war but it was rejected by Gurevich. At the same time, Gurevich was increasingly finding himself in arguments with Trepper. By that point, he was no longer part of the Soviet espionage network, was defeatist in his outlook and started to offer reasons why he was no longer using his transmitter. Trepper eventually had to call in two radio specialists to check the radio and found it in perfect working order. In January 1942, Trepper ordered Gurevich to travel to Marseille and establish a new branch office of Simex. Arrest On 9 November 1942, Gurevich was arrested with Margaret in his apartment at 75 Rue Abbé de l'Épée in Marseilles by the French police. Gurevich was handed over to German Police and then on the order of the person who was head of the Gestapo in France, Karl Bömelburg, was fetched by a truck from Marseilles and taken to a house in Rue des Saussaies in Paris. He was subsequently moved to Fort Breendonk in Belgium then taken to be interrogated by the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA) in Prince Albertstrasse, Berlin. Playbacks Gurevich told the Germans that he had not been active as a professional agent for some time and had tried to create a new life for himself and Margaret Barcza in Marseilles. He stated that he knew before his arrest that he was being surveilled at his Marseilles address and the reason that he had not fled was that no longer considered himself part of the Rote Kapelle. Although he showed a readiness to work for the Germans there was still a great distrust of Gurevich amongst his interrogators. However, Gurevich was continually brought into the office of the Gestapo for further interrogation, where over several days he managed to convince them that he was genuine. Gurevich laid out a plan to the Gestapo to get back in touch with the Russian intelligence service and enable playbacks to commence which the Gestapo accepted. Playbacks, the British term or the American term, G-V Game or Funkspiel as it was known in Germany was the transmission of controlled information over a captured agent's radio so that the agent's parent service had no knowledge that the agent had turned. Although Gurevich decided to cooperate on playbacks he refused to name any agents he had recruited. To initiate the playback, it is believed Gurevich sent a letter to the Red Army intelligence via the Soviet consulate in Sofia but it is not known how a reply was sent by the Soviets. Once he made contact with Red Army intelligence, the strict discipline under which he was held was relaxed and he was allowed visits by his wife Margaret. On 4 January 1943, Gurevich was returned Fresnes Prison in France where he began the playback operation. However, he took up so much time enciphering and deciphering the messages that he was moved back to the house on Rue des Saussaies in Paris, where he was given a cell next to Trepper. The ciphering undertaken by Gurevich was checked at first by Gestapo officer Waldemar Lentz and then later by Hans Kurfess. The book that Gurevich used to cipher his messages was believed to be French novel containing stories about Corsica called Mérimée, possibly a book by the French novelist Prosper Mérimée who wrote a number of novellas set in Corsica. During the playback operation, the Gestapo found that Gurevich was both praised and criticised by Soviet intelligence but although he was requested to provide military intelligence about the Wehrmacht, the Gestapo found it impossible to supply even the most innocuous material. By March 1943, Gurevich was effectively part of the Sonderkommando Rote Kapelle, the RSHA counter-intelligence unit. In July 1943 Gurevich and Margaret were moved to a new apartment at 40 Boulevard Victor Hugo, Neuilly-sur-Seine in Paris. Trepper joined them at the apartment. They were allowed to walk about Paris without a guard. Ozols By early 1943, Red Army intelligence had little doubt that Gurevich had been arrested and was now a double agent. Surprisingly, on 14 March 1943, during the playback, Gurevich received a message that detailed a former Latvian general Waldemar Ozols who was a Red Army intelligence agent. Ozols was a principal-agent in Gurevich's network and together were successful in penetrating French Resistance. The Soviets believed that Ozols would be able to furnish information about German troop movements, so Ozols was reactivated by Sukolov in July 1943, by speaking a pre-arranged word. Ozols hadn't been active since July 1941 and wasn't informed that Gurevich was working for the Germans. Gurevich ordered Ozols to reassemble his network with the remnants of his old network and recruit new members where needed. By December 1943, Ozols had made contact with Paul Legendre, a reserve caption who was chief of the Mithridate network that was located in the Marseilles region. Consequently, the Mithridate network was under the command of the German Army. Amongst the agents that Legendre recruited were Maurice Viollette and the Mayor of Dreux. Initially, the Germans used the Mithridate network to manipulate the French resistance but in spring 1944, Pannwitz decided to use the network to communicate to Gestapo agents who were working behind enemy lines and use Gurevich as a proxy to pass information between the network and the Gestapo. Retreat Gurevich continued to act as a proxy to Ozols and the Mithridate network until the summer of 1944. Around the same time Gurevich moved from Neuilly-sur-Seine into Pannwitz's villa, located close to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. As a result of his successes with Ozols, Sukolov made increasing demands on the Germans. One of these was to send Greta Barcza's son to a school in Paris and the Sonderkommando to pay the school fees. After the Normandy landings and the subsequent retreat of German forced in autumn 1944, the Sonderkommando Rote Kapelle of the RSHA was reduced in strength. Pannwitz took over the running of the Sonderkommando. On 16 August 1944 Pannwitz took Gurevich and Barcza away from Paris when the Sonderkommando was forced to withdraw. Gurevich continued his playbacks under the leadership of Pannwitz and a station was established somewhere in Alsace to continue the playback operation. After Barcza gave birth to Gurevich's son in November 1944, Gurevich and Barcza were forced to separate by Pannwitz. Gurevich was sent to Berlin to receive orders on whether to continue the playbacks with Pannwitz and this was the last time that Barcza saw him. As late as November 1944 Gurevich and Pannwitz were in Berlin to receive orders on whether to continue the playbacks. In April 1945, Gurevich and Pannwitz were seen close to Lake Constance. They continued the playbacks from various locations until May 1945. USSR Organisational diagram of the Sukolov Group in Belgium between July 1940 and December 1941 In April 1945, Gurevich was located in Bregenz. On 3 May 1945 Gurevich was captured by French forces in a hut on a mountain near Bludenz, Vorarlberg, Austria, along with Heinz Pannwitz. Gurevich and Pannwitz were taken to Paris for interrogation. Sukolov stated to the interrogators that he was an officer in the Russian Intelligence Service. On a flight organised by Colonel Novikov of the Soviet Military Mission on 7 June 1945, Gurevich along with Pannwitz, Gurevich's secretary Emma Kemp flew to Moscow. Gurevich took along a package of documents that constituted the archives that the Gestapo compiled on the Red Orchestra. In Moscow all were immediately arrested and locked up in the Lubyanka. Gurevich was accused of high treason. He was questioned for a long time by Viktor Abakumov, who ransacked the records of the interrogations that Gurevich had reported. In January 1927, Gurevich was sentenced to 20 years for treason, under Article 58-1a and was imprisoned in Vorkutlag from January 1948 to October 1955. By 1991 Gurevich was fully exonerated and released. It was established that Gurevich was imprisoned due to his marrying his mistress Marguerite Barcza without the permission of Russian intelligence. The accusation by Red Army Intelligence was that Gurevich had abandoned his mission in Marseille while becoming thoroughly au fait with western living that in turn had led to his supposed defection. Gurevich lost trace of his wife Marguerite and their young son Michael; to his questions the NKVD replied that they had died in a concentration camp during a bombing. Barcza searched for Gurevich after the war ended for a number of years. On 29 November 1990, Gurevich learned that Margarete had survived the camp and died in 1985 and that his son, Michelle was alive and living in Spain. In February 1991, he met his son in Leningrad. In popular culture The following films were made where Gurevich was a character. * Verlorenes Leben - Hans Coppi und der letzte Agent der rotten Kapelle (Lost life - Hans Coppi and the last agent of the rotten band) was released in 1996. Hans Coppi Junior shot a documentary about Gurevich. * L'orchestre Rouge (The Red Orchestra) by Jacques Rouffio was released in 1989. Martin Lamotte played Gurevich under the codename Kent.

Chapman (born July 20, 1962 in Bellingham, Washington) is an American biochemist known for his work on Ca2+-triggered exocytosis. He currently serves as the Ricardo Miledi Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he is also an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI).  Life and work  Chapman received his Ph.D. from the University of Washington in Seattle, and conducted post-doctoral studies with Reinhard Jahn at the HHMI at Yale University. In 1996 he became an assistant professor in the Department of Physiology (later renamed Neuroscience) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In 2005, Chapman became a full professor and an HHMI Investigator. In 2018 he was named as the inaugural director of the Quantitative Membrane Biophysics Program at the UW- Madison. Chapman has made important contributions in three related areas: the molecular mechanisms by which Ca2+ triggers exocytosis in neurons and neuroendocrine cells, the structure and dynamics of exocytotic fusion pores, and the mechanisms by which botulinum and tetanus neurotoxins act on neurons to block exocytosis. He pioneered the use of time resolved biochemical and biophysical methods to study protein•lipid and protein•protein interactions that mediate excitation-secretion coupling. His laboratory was the first to reconstitute Ca2+-triggered membrane fusion in vitro using purified components, and he has used this approach to make numerous crucial contributions concerning the mechanism by which proteins catalyze the merger of lipid bilayers. He is also a leader concerning our understanding of exocytotic fusion pores, using both cell- and nanodisc-based approaches to reveal their dynamics, composition, and structure. In parallel, his laboratory pioneered the identification of protein receptors for the clostridial neurotoxins, including “Botox”. Other major contributions include on-going studies to assign functions to orphaned synaptic vesicle proteins and to understand the function of all members of the synaptotagmin family of membrane trafficking proteins; this latter work has revealed a number of novel insights into synaptic plasticity.  Achievements  Chapman has published more than 150 scientific research articles, and is listed on seven US-issued patents. He is the recipient of Shaw Scientist and Pew Scholar awards, and in 2019 he was given the Sir Bernard Katz Award, from the Biophysical Society, for his work on Ca2+ sensors and fusion pores.

Picture from the Quarles archive. Redoshi ( 1848 – 1937) was a West African woman from Nigeria taken to the U.S. state of Alabama as a girl in 1860. Until a later surviving claimant, Matilda McCrear, was announced in 2020, she was considered to have been the last surviving victim of the transatlantic slave trade. Taken captive in warfare at age 12 from the Slave Coast of West Africa, she was sold to Americans and transported by ship to the United States, in violation of U.S. law. She was sold again and enslaved on the upcountry plantation of the Washington Smith family in Dallas County, Alabama, where her owner renamed her Sally Smith. Redoshi survived slavery and the imposition of Jim Crow laws during the post- Reconstruction era of disenfranchisement, and lived into the Great Depression. She lived long enough to become acquainted with people active in the civil rights movement; she is the only known female transatlantic slavery survivor to have been filmed and to have been interviewed for a newspaper. Biography Redoshi lived in a village in West Africa, in today's Benin. The name \\"Redoshi\\" is unknown in West Africa, though 14 names similar to it appear in the African Origins database. Her village was attacked in a raid by Dahomey people, who killed her father (possibly a village leader) and took her captive at about age 12, around 1860. They sold her to the American captain of the illegal slave ship Clotilda. She was forced to marry another captive, a man also from West Africa who was already married and spoke a different language. Her husband was later referred to as \\"Uncle Billy\\" or \\"Yawith\\". Redoshi was transported on the Clotilda, the last ship known to bring enslaved African people to North America. Its owners did so illegally, as more than 50 years earlier the U.S. had abolished the importation of slaves. Alabama businessman Timothy Meaher had commissioned the captain and ship for a slave-buying mission to Ouidah, a port city in what is today Benin. After the ship reached Mobile, Alabama, where Meaher lived, Redoshi was sold with her husband to Washington Smith, a planter in Dallas County, Alabama, about west of Selma. Smith was a wealthy man who owned a big plantation in Bogue Chitto. He also had a townhouse in Selma and was among the founders of the Bank of Selma. He renamed her \\"Sally Smith\\" and put her to work in the fields and sometimes the big house. Apparently, two of the Dahomey people who had kidnapped Redoshi and her kinfolk were also taken captive and transported to North America on the same slave ship. They worked alongside Redoshi in the fields, and she never forgave them. After emancipation, Redoshi (aged 17) and her husband Yawith continued to live on the plantation, working as sharecroppers. Washington Smith died in 1869, but his wife continued to run the plantation. Together with advance merchants and others, the planters essentially controlled the finances of the sharecroppers and settled annual accounts to their own benefit. Redoshi and her husband survived, though in poverty; they may have owned land in or near Bogue Chitto. The couple had a daughter together and raised her. Although she adopted Christianity, Redoshi also practiced her African religious traditions and taught them to her daughter. Yawith died in the 1910s or 1920s; Redoshi died in 1937. Her daughter was listed on the U.S. Census and in marriage documents variously as \\"Leasy\\", \\"Luth A.\\", \\"Lethe\\", \\"Letia\\", and \\"Lethy\\", and had children. Historiography Scholar Hannah Durkin of Newcastle University pieced together an account of Redoshi's life and concluded that she was the last survivor of the slaves transported by the illegal slaver's ship Clotilda and of the transatlantic slave trade.\\"Last survivor of the transatlantic slave trade identified\\", Press release, Newcastle University, 2 April 2019 Previously historians believed that Cudjoe Lewis (Kossola) was the last survivor of the transatlantic slave trade. A spokesman for Africatown in Mobile, he was interviewed by numerous people. His life was written about by Emma Langdon Roche in a 1914 book and by Zora Neale Hurston in a 1928 article. Hurston returned to Alabama to interview him over a period of months and wrote a book about him, but it was not published until 2018, long after her death, as Barracoon: The Story of the Last \\"Black Cargo\\". The appendix lists Sally Smith as having a son, Jessie Smith, a farmer, but Redoshi's only known child was a daughter. Redoshi in The Negro Farmer (1938) Durkin noted the limited number of sources that refer to the West African woman: notes and a letter by Zora Neale Hurston to Langston Hughes, not published during her lifetime; a Montgomery, Alabama, newspaper interview from 1932; a federal government educational film from 1938, in which she briefly appears; a brief account in the memoir of a civil-rights activist, and various data from the U.S. Census and other records. They are \\"fragmentary, frequently contradictory...[;] The gaps and inconsistencies across these materials help to underscore the inexpressibility of transatlantic slavery as a lived experience\\". In 1928, Hurston had written to her friend Langston Hughes about her travels in Alabama interviewing African Americans. She said that Lewis was not the only survivor of the Clotilda: she had also met a \\"most delightful\\" woman, \\"older than Cudjoe, about 200 miles up state on the Tombig[b]ee river\\". Hurston did not write further about Redoshi, but she included the name \\"Sally Smith\\" and biographical details in an appendix of her manuscript for what was posthumously published as Every Tongue Got to Confess: Negro Folk-tales from the Gulf States (2001). It was based on the manuscript and notes of about 500 of her interviews. Hurston did not refer to Redoshi in Barracoon, which concentrated on Kossola and his experiences. Redoshi, referred to as \\"Aunt Sally Smith\\", was interviewed in 1932 by the Montgomery Advertiser, when she was living on a plantation then owned by the Quarles family. The article reported that she was 25 when she was captured, that she was a \\"princess\\" from the tribe of the Tarkars,Sylviane A. Diouf believes that the term \\"Tarkar\\" might have come from a misunderstanding of the name of a local king, or the name of a town. and that she came from the same village in present-day Benin as Kossola/Cudjo Lewis. Durkin says this is \\"apparently the only newspaper article that is devoted to the experiences of a female Middle Passage survivor\\". The account, she says, is mediated by the white journalist and \\"reflects its white interviewer's romantic fantasies of the African continent\\" and \\"reinforces the customary pre-civil-rights era depictions of U.S. slavery as a benevolent, 'civilising' practice\\". Redoshi was filmed for a 1938 educational film, The Negro Farmer: Extension Work for Better Farming and Better Living, made by the United States Department of Agriculture with assistance from the Tuskegee Institute. The film was described as \\"a paternalistic portrait of black rural life\\", intended to \\"halt a mass migration to the urban north by black people\\". Smith appeared briefly in the film but did not have any spoken lines; she is the second survivor of the Clotilda and the only woman of the transatlantic slave trade to be filmed. The work is held by the Library of Congress. In Documenting Racism: African Americans in US Department of Agriculture Documentaries, 1921–42, J. Emmett Winn describes the footage, saying that the silent portrait of \\"Aunt Sally Smith\\", whose abbreviated biography is provided by a white narrator, underscores the poor living conditions of Southern farmers in the Black Belt. It is part of an effort to promote agricultural improvements guided by the USDA's guidance and to emphasize the film's message that \\"blacks should stay on Southern farms\\". Civil-rights activist Amelia Boynton Robinson of Alabama said in her 1979 memoir Bridge across Jordan that she had met \\"Aunt Sally\\" in about 1936. Boynton Robinson later organized voter registration and other grassroots efforts there in the early 1960s. She noted that Smith had come from Africa and that they talked about her retention of African cultural traditions within her family. Historian Alston Fitts included a short biography of Redoshi in Selma: A Bicentennial (1989, rep. in 2017), which was based on \\"Quarles family tradition\\" and on the account in Robinson's book.

The area lies north of the River Thames and extends from its historic and commercial core of Westminster and the West End to the Greater London boundary, much of which is formed by the River Colne. Some interpretations of the area include the boroughs of Brent and Harrow, making ancient Watling Street, the boundary in those outer areas. The constituent districts of West London were traditionally part of Middlesex. The area emerged from Westminster, an area just west of the City of London, which owed its importance to the consecration of Westminster Abbey and after that, the establishment of the Palace of Westminster. Westminster and the West End are also part of Central London. The term West London is used to differentiate the area from other informal radial divisions of London, the Metropolitan Compass;A phrase used, for instance, by Dickens in the Uncommercial Traveller, Ch 3 North London, East London and South London. Economy =London Plan= The London Plan defines two areas of London as International Centres, the West End and Knightsbridge, both in the west of London. Five of the thirteen Metropolitan Centres in the Plan might be described as being in West London (dependent on definition of the area): Ealing, Hounslow, Harrow, Uxbridge and Shepherds Bush. Eleven of the Plan's thirty-eight Opportunity Areas might be described as part of West London; Kensal Canalside, Paddington, Earl's Court and West Kensington, Harrow and Wealdstone, Park Royal, Old Oak Common, Southall, Tottenham Court Road, Victoria, Wembley and White City. One of the Plan's seven Intensification Areas, Holborn, could be described as part of the West. =Major employers= London Heathrow Airport is a major employer in West London, and the University of West London has more than 47,000 students. Emergence The development of the area began with the establishment of the Abbey on a site then called Thorney Island, the choice of site may in part relate to the natural ford which is thought to have carried Watling Street over the Thames in the vicinity. Tradition dates the foundation to the 7th Century AD with written records dating back to the 960s or early 970s. The Island and surrounding area became known as Westminster in reference to the church. The legendary originhttp://www.choirschools.org.uk/wp- content/uploads/2015/03/The-Abbey-Fishy-Tale.pdf is that in the early 7th century, a local fisherman named Edric, ferried a stranger in tattered foreign clothing over the Thames to Thorney Island. It was a miraculous appearance of St Peter, a fisherman himself, coming to the island to consecrate the newly built church, which would subsequently develop into Westminster Abbey. He rewarded Edric with a bountiful catch when he next dropped his nets. Edric was instructed to present the King and St. Mellitus, Bishop of London with a salmon and various proofs that the consecration had already occurred . Every year on 29 June, St Peters day, the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers presents the Abbey with a salmon in memory of this event. The Palace of Westminster subsequently developed, with Parliament being based there from its establishment in 1265. The presence of the centre of government as a distinct focus for growth, accompanied by the proximity of the City, ensured that western London was the fastest growing part of early London. In 1720, John Strype's ‘Survey of London’ described Westminster as one of the then four distinct areas of London; in it he describes the City of London, Westminster (West London), Southwark (South London), and 'That Part beyond the Tower' (East London). The area now usually referred to as North London developed later. A detailed copy of John Rocque's Map of London, 1741-5. As well as the proximity of the centre of government, the West End was long favoured by the rich elite as a place of residence because it was usually upwind of the smoke drifting from the crowded City.Robert O. Bucholz and Joseph P. Ward: London: A Social and Cultural History, 1550–1750. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 2012, p. 333 A further factor facilitating rapid growth in West London was the very large number of bridges linking the area to South London and the area beyond; by contrast, even today, there are no bridges east of Tower Bridge, partly as the river becomes wider as it heads east. Like other areas of the capital, West London grew rapidly in the Victorian era as a result of railway- based commuting; with the building of the termini at Paddington and Marylebone, and the lines radiating from them, having a particularly profound effect. This trend continued in the twentieth century and was subsequently reinforced by motorcar-based commuting. The size of London stabilised after the establishment of the Metropolitan Green Belt shortly after the Second World War.  Official designations  The term 'West London' has been used for a variety of formal purposes with the boundaries defined according to the purposes of the designation. =Planning Policy sub-region= 350px The 2011 iteration of the London Plan. included an altered 'West' sub-region, to be used for planning, engagement, resource allocation and progress reporting purposes. It consists of the London Boroughs of Brent, Harrow, Ealing, Hammersmith and Fulham, Hillingdon, Hounslow and the Richmond upon Thames. As well as including outer areas of West London, the sub-region also includes areas south of the river, not usually counted as part of West London; areas of the cross-river London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. The 2004-2008 and 2008-2011 versions of the sub-region varied in their composition. = W postcode area = The W (Western) postcode area was introduced in 1857 to facilitate the distribution of mail. The postcode area is a sub-set of West London in some definitions or the extent of West London in others, since it does not include areas frequently counted as part of North West London. Many areas with a SW postcode are in fact in West London and are north of the river, such as Chelsea and South Kensington.

The society is based in the East Riding of Yorkshire and is concerned with the preservation of buildings in the East Riding and Kingston- upon-Hull.  History  The origin of the society was as a committee of the East Riding Antiquarian Society tasked with \\"making a list of buildings of that period in our Riding, and any other matters deemed necessary with regard to the preservation of Georgian buildings\\" by Rupert Alec-Smith in January 1937. In the late 1930s there was wide spread destruction of many Georgian Buildings which caused concern to a number of architects and historians; this concern was most prominently voiced by Robert Byron in his polemic article \\"How We Celebrate the Coronation\\" in the May 1937 edition of the Architectural Review. The first committee meeting was held on 2 June 1937; after which Rupert Alec-Smith wrote to Lord Derwent to invite him to become the society's President. The architect Francis Johnson was invited to join the society in 1938 and became a very prominent member. His professional skills were called upon when the society bought and restored properties in Hull which had suffered bomb damage during World War II. = Properties bought and saved by the Georgian Society for East Yorkshire = * Maister House, Hull (the only National Trust property in the city) * Blaydes House  The Society's objectives  The society's objectives as stated on its website are: # To preserve buildings from destruction or disfigurement, especially those of the Georgian period, of architectural and historic interest in Hull and the East Riding. # To safeguard the setting of such buildings and to maintain or enhance the character of areas of architectural interest and scenic beauty. # To afford advice to owners and public authorities on the preservation and repair of such buildings and the uses to which they might be adapted, where necessary. # To stimulate public appreciation of the architectural and historic heritage of Hull and the East Riding.

Early life Strong was born on January 15, 1863 in New Brunswick, New Jersey. He was the third son of Harriet Anna (née Hartwell) Strong (1827–1909) and Benjamin Ruggles Woodbridge Strong (1827–1907), presiding justice of the Court of Common Pleas of Middlesex County. Among his older siblings was brothers Edward Woodbridge Strong; Alan Hartwell Strong, who married Susan De Lancey Cullen Van Rensselaer; and Joseph Maltby Strong. Reportedly, his father caught \\"gold fever\\" in 1849, and journeyed to California, and is \\"credited with being among the pioneers who made gold discoveries in Oregon.\\" His paternal grandfather was the prominent mathematician, Theodore Strong, who was raised by his wealthy uncle Benjamin Ruggles Woodbridge (the namesake of his father). Through his father, he was a direct descendant of Governor Thomas Dudley, and Rev. John Woodbridge, who came to Massachusetts in 1634. Through his mother, he was a descendant of William Hartwell, who came to Plymouth County, Massachusetts in 1636. Strong received his education at Rutgers College Grammar School and graduated from Rutgers University as a member of the class of 1883. Career After studying law under his father at Woodbridge, Strong & Sons (founded in 1852), he was admitted to the bar in June 1886, and as a counselor in June 1889. When his father became a judge, the firm was dissolved and he formed a new firm with his brother Alan, known as Strong & Strong, and practiced until his death in 1928. In September 1912, after his brother Alan moved to Philadelphia and became General Counsel for the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, Theodore became solicitor for the company in New Jersey and \\"wholly withdrew from politics.\\" In November 1900, Strong was elected in a Republican wave to the New Jersey State Senate to represent Middlesex County, New Jersey defeating the incumbent Democratic candidate, and former mayor of New Brunswick, James H. Van Cleef, with 9,283 to 7,327. Strong had secured the Republican nomination in October after thirty-seven ballots. He was succeeded in the Senate by fellow Republican William Howard Crosby Jackson. In addition, Strong served two terms as a member of the Republican State Committee, served on the executive committee and \\"was a member of the coterie of Republican State Leaders once known as 'The Big Four'\\". In April 1903, he was appointed by Governor Franklin Murphy as a member of the New Jersey State Board of Assessors and later served as its president for several years. Personal life On March 21, 1900, Strong was married to Cornelia Livingston Van Rensselaer (1879–1956). Cornelia, a graduate of the Misses Fenimore Coopers' School in Albany, New York, was the daughter of Visscher Van Rensselaer and Mary Augusta Miller (née Van Rensselaer) and a great-granddaughter of Jeremiah Van Rensselaer a U.S. Representative and the former Lieutenant Governor of New York. Together, Theodore and Cornelia lived at \\"Stronghold\\" at 272 Hamilton Street in New Brunswick and were the parents of six sons and two daughters: * Theodore Strong (1901–1978), who did not marry. * Cornelia Livingston Van Rensselaer Strong (1902–1989), who did not marry and who served as a president of the New York chapter of the Colonial Dames of America. * Katharine Van Rensselaer Strong (b. 1904), who married Morrison Ulman. * Stephen Van Rensselaer Strong (1906–1975), who married Marianne Schappert. * Benjamin Ruggles Woodbridge Strong (1910–1997), who married Julie Maxilienne DeViry (1919–2000), a native of Thonon-les-Bains, France who was a daughter of Baron Humbert and Baroness Delphine Marie deViry. * John Van Rensselaer Strong (1912–1990), who married Nancy (née Jones) de Rohan. * Robert Livingston Strong (1914–2007), who married Mary Johnston Sutherland (1924–2006). * Philip Livingston Strong (1918–1998), who married Sally Ann Borthwick (1928-2013).

An international co-production of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, the film stars Andrea Riseborough, Christopher Abbott, Rossif Sutherland, Tuppence Middleton, Sean Bean, and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Possessor had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 25, 2020, and is scheduled to be released in the United States and Canada on October 2, 2020, by Neon and Elevation Pictures. It is scheduled to be released in the United Kingdom on November 27, 2020, by Signature Entertainment. The film was particularly praised for its originality and the performances from Riseborough, Abbott, Leigh, and Graham. Plot A woman named Holly sticks a probe into the top of her head and turns the dial button on a machine. Holly disconnects from the machine and goes to a party dressed in her work uniform as the hostess. After arriving at the party, she walks up to a wealthy attorney, grabs a knife, and brutally stabs him in the neck and gut. Everyone at the party flee in terror and call the cops. Holly takes out a gun from her purse and puts it in her mouth, but before she pulls the trigger, she stops and instead aims the gun at the police, and they shoot her dead. Afterwards, a woman named Tasya Vos is shown being removed from a machine. She is a \\"possessor\\": a contract killer whose consciousness is implanted into the body of another person in order to carry out an assassination. Tasya was controlling Holly’s body and committed the murder, but couldn't overcome Holly's resistance to committing suicide. During a post-assassination debriefing by her boss Girder, Tasya identifies objects of her past to prove that her sense of self is intact. One of the objects is a mounted butterfly, which she expresses regret for killing as a child. Tasya indicates she wants time to reconnect with her estranged husband Michael and son Ian. However, when she visits with them, she must rehearse how to engage in ordinary conversation with them, showing she is unsteady in ordinary civilian life. Later, Girder updates Tasya on her next job, one of the biggest ones the company has ever received. They’ve been hired by a man named Reid, who is the stepson of a man named John Parse. John is the owner of a massive corporation that specializes in data mining. Reid wants them to assassinate John and his daughter Ava so that he can take over the company. Girder is particularly excited about this hit because, once the job is done, the company will effectively be able to control John’s via blackmailing Reid. Tasya is instructed to possess Ava’s boyfriend Colin Tate. She does a stakeout and, after becoming familiar with Colin’s mannerisms and speech patterns, the company abducts him and implants a neural network in him. Tasya wakes up in Colin’s body, and lives inside his life, finding herself attracted to Ava, despite knowing she will have to kill her. She is blindsided by interactions with Eddie, a co-worker at Parse's company, and Reeta, a friend of Ava's whom Colin has slept with before, each of them revealing details of Colin's life she was not briefed on in Girder's preparation. The day of a large party, Girder instructs Tasya to have Colin get into a public argument with Parse to establish motive for the later assassination. After doing this, Colin is kicked out and Tasya hides in the bushes until the party ends. Afterwards, Colin brutally attacks John with a poker instead of the company provided gun. Ava walks in and Colin kills her with a shot to the head. He then puts the gun in his mouth but is unable to pull the trigger. In the company headquarters, Tasya pukes up blood while still hooked into the machine and the support staff says that Colin has reasserted control. They want to prematurely disconnect Tasya, but Girder orders them to give her more time to try and reassert control. Colin runs to Reeta’s home, and soon blacks out. After he awakens, he hears a knock on the door and is surprised to see Eddie. Eddie enters the apartment and claims Reeta called him, but soon knocks out Colin. When Colin awakens, he is connected to a recalibration machine and Tasya is seemingly back in control. Eddie was working for the assassination company the entire time and was planted as a lifeline for Tasya in case anything went wrong. He explains that Tasya needs to complete the suicide and then they can pull her out, but she says she still isn’t fully in control. Eddie says he will help her override Colin’s consciousness and they begin a process to do so. News reports, meanwhile, reveal that John Parse has survived the failed assassination. During the process, we see Colin’s consciousness enter the room and attack Tasya. Colin rips off her face, wears it as a mask, and is able to access her memories. Then their combined form blacks out. When Colin awakens, he finds Eddie dead on the floor. He also finds Reeta dead from their earlier encounter. Colin’s hand suddenly grabs the gun and fires it at himself, but dodges the bullet. He then angrily leaves Reeta’s house, and tracks down Tasya's based on the memories he experienced. He breaks in and holds Michael hostage. Colin demands that Tasya reveal herself and explain what is happening. He and Tasya's consciousness then talk on the psychic plane. She says that Colin has been in control for some time. Colin threatens he will kill Michael if she doesn’t help him, but she actually encourages Colin to kill him. While Colin is distracted during this psychic conversation, Michael disarms him. Before he can shoot Colin, Colin butchers him to death with a meat cleaver. Tasya then asks to be pulled out, but again can’t make Colin commit suicide. Suddenly, Colin is stabbed in the throat by her son Ira. As Colin bleeds out, he shoots Ira dead; before he expires, Ira also asks to be pulled out, indicating someone else has been controlling him as well. Tasya is removed from the machine connecting her to Colin, while Girder is revealed as Ira's possessor, and also removed from her machine. This time, during the debriefing, Tasya remembers killing and mounting the butterfly, but does not express remorse for the actions, suggesting while the state of her mind is unclear, she has lost the empathy she demonstrated previously in the story.

Reception On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 92% of 119 critic ratings are positive for Possessor, and the average rating is 7.64/10. The website's consensus reads, \\"Further refining his provocative vision, writer-director Brandon Cronenberg uses Possessors potentially over-the-top premise as a delivery mechanism for stylishly disturbing thrills.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 72 out of 100, based on 23 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". The film's opening sequence was singled out for praise, particularly Gabrielle Graham's performance as Holly in the sequence. David Ehrlich from IndieWire called it \\"a coldly compelling prologue\\"; and Wendy Ide from Screen Daily agreed: \\"In a memorable cameo role in the film’s opening, Gabrielle Graham also makes an impact.\\" Meagan Navarro of Bloody Disgusting gave the film a score of four-and-a-half out of five, writing: \\"Like dad David Cronenberg, Brandon Cronenberg has a unique way of testing the boundaries of comfort and exploring the human mind and body in squeamish fashion.\\" John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter praised the film's direction, visuals, as well as its performances, and special effects. Rob Hunter of Film School Rejects gave the film a positive review, writing: \\"While Possessor retains his family's love of body horror and morally misused electronics it also manages an engrossing pace, engaging characters, unrelentingly brutal violence, erect penises, a must-own Halloween mask, a mean-spirited Sean Bean, one hell of an ending, and more [...] All of it, though, is fantastically and cruelly unforgettable.\\" Chris Evangelista of Slashfilm gave the film ten out of ten, writing: \\"Bathed in blood and gore, and unrelentingly aggressive, Brandon Cronenberg‘s Possessor is unlike anything you’ve ever seen before. It is a singular work – one so ghastly, so unique, and so brutal that it will awe some and disgust others.\\" JoBlo.com's Chris Bumbray gave the film a score of eight out of ten, stating that the film \\"recalls many of his father David Cronenberg's previous works\\", Bunbray further praised Abbott and Riseborough's performances, as well as similar praise towards the film's visual style. David Ehrlich from IndieWire also gave the film a grade of \\"B-\\", praising Cronenberg's direction as well as the film's cinematography, visuals, and performances, while also stating it did not fully realize its potential.

PIG-A is involved in the synthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), an anchor molecule that tethers multiple protein marker molecules at the surface of the cells. When the sample containing wild-type and PIG-A mutant cells is labeled with fluorescent antibodies raised against GPI-anchored protein markers (such as CD24, CD48, CD55, CD59) the wild-type cells will fluoresce and PIG-A mutant cells will not. The fraction of non-fluorescent PIG-A mutant cells in the antibody-labeled sample can be efficiently determined on any of the modern high throughput flow cytometers. The PIG-A mutant frequency can be determined with high accuracy within minutes by processing samples containing a total of a million cells or more. Application Originally, PIG-A assay was proposed as a method for monitoring humans for somatic mutation. The assay was developed as an extension of flow cytometric procedure for diagnosing human acquired genetic disorder, paroxismal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). PIG-A assays were developed for cells of peripheral blood, such as red blood cells (RBCs) and white blood cells (WBCs). Due to conservative nature of GPI biosynthesis in mammalian species, similar flow cytometry protocols were developed for mammalian species of toxicological interest, i.e., mice and rats. The most demanding RBC-based Pig-a assay requires only microliter volumes of peripheral blood which is easy to obtain without harming the animals. Therefore, the Pig-a assay can be added to various non-clinical in vivo safety evaluations mandated by regulatory authorities as a test measuring a value end-point, i.e., gene mutation, without requiring additional groups of animals for testing. Government agencies, such as t he US Food and Drug Administration and United States Environmental Protection Agency, require testing novel pharmaceuticals and high volume industrial chemicals for mutagenicity as a screen for potential carcinogens. An in vivo RBC Pig-a assay is an optional test for qualification of genotoxic impurities as described in FDA's ICH M7 guidance. A standardized regulatory-compliant Test Guideline for performing Pig-a assay and interpreting the test results is being developed under the auspices of The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

It is attested by military diplomas and inscriptions. Name *Lucensium: from the conventus Lucensis. The soldiers of the cohort were recruited, at least initially, from in the territory of conventus Lucensis with the capital Lucus Augusti (modern Lugo), Spain. *equitata: partly mounted. The cohort was a mixed unit of infantry and cavalry. Since there is no evidence for the suffix milliaria (1000 men), the unit was a cohors quingenaria equitata. The target strength of the cohort was 600 men, 480 infantry and 120 cavalry, consisting of 6 centurias of infantry with 80 men each and 4 turmae of cavalry with 30 men each. History The cohort was stationed in the provinces of Moesia, Pannonia, Moesia Inferior, and Thracia, in that order. It is listed on military diplomas for the years 78 to 180/192 AD. The cohort's deployment in 80 in the province of Pannonia is controversial. The first evidence of the unit in the province of Moesia is based on a military diploma dated to the year 78. The diploma lists the cohort as part of the troops stationed in the province. Further diplomas, dated 92 to 127, place the unit in Moesia Inferior. Around 130 a vexillatio of the unit was stationed in Chersonesus in Crimea. The first evidence of unit in the province of Thracia is based on a military diploma dated to 138. The diploma lists the cohort as part of the troops stationed in the province. Other diplomas dated from 155 to 180/192 attest to unit in the same province.

While he paints in his studio in Wales, he travels abroad to large cities like New York to research his compositions.  Paintings  Walsh spends days becoming familiar with the ever-changing city landscape in any major city that he visits. He sketches the basic composition of each painting on a postcard-sized piece of paper. Then, he photographs specific areas of the city that he chooses to paint. When he returns to his studio in Wales, he compiles as many as 1000 images to prepare a verist composition for a new painting. His underpaintings are very intricate and architectural. This results in colossal paintings measuring up to 9 feet in width.  Repentir App  Walsh's intricate painting process is documented in an app called Repentir. The app works with his paintings, Transamerica (2013) and 23 Skidoo (2013). With the app, the user can take a photo of any, or the entire, painting and rewind the painting in time down to the underdrawing.

It was discovered by astronomer William Herschel on April 8, 1784 and is a member of the Virgo Cluster. It is classified as a Seyfert galaxy and as a LINER galaxy. It also has a prominent, extended dust lane. Physical characteristics The disk of NGC 4302 contains extraplanar dust that is organized into filamentary structures and large dust complexes. The apparent bending of many of the large complexes toward the north of the galaxy appears to be due to an interaction with the intracluster medium caused by the motion of NGC 4302 as it falls into the Virgo Cluster. The dense, dusty matter in the disk of NGC 4302 appears to be largely tracing matter ejected from the disk by energetic feedback from massive stars. Hubble image of the dust lane and bulge of NGC 4302. =Extraplanar Diffuse Ionized Gas= First detected by Pildis et al., NGC 4302 has a faint but prominent layer of extraplanar diffuse ionized gas (DIG) that extends out to a galactocentric radius of ~ and a height of ~ above the plane of the galaxy. The DIG appears to have been ionized by photoionization by OB stars. = Box/Peanut Bulge = The presence of a boxy/peanut bulge in NGC 4302 suggests that the galaxy contains a thickened bar that is viewed edge-on. =HI Disk= The HI disk of NGC 4302 is truncated to within the optical disk to the south of the galaxy. This truncation appears to be the result of ram-pressure. Tidal Bridge Kantharia et al. and Zschaechner et al. both independently detected a tidal bridge between NGC 4302 and NGC 4298. The bridge is the result of a tidal interaction between the two galaxies. NGC 4302 & NGC 4298 (HST) HI tail First identified by Chung et al., NGC 4302 has a ~ tail of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) that extends to the north of the galaxy. The tail appears to be a result of ram-pressure or by a tidal interaction with NGC 4298. However, NGC 4302 appears relatively undisturbed favoring the cause of the tail to be due to ram-pressure. The HI tail is pointed away from M87 which suggests that NGC 4302 is falling into the center of the Virgo Cluster on a highly radial orbit. SN 1986E NGC 4302 has hosted one supernova, a Type IIL supernova designated as SN 1986E. The supernova was discovered by G. Candeo at the Asiago Observatory on April 13, 1986 with an apparent magnitude of 14.5.

Along with the Nuovo Postiglione, it was the main newspaper covering foreign affairs printed in Venice in that time, arriving to circulation of more than two thousand copies. History On 22 August 1778 the Government of the Republic of Venice authorized Antonio Graziosi to publish a new newspaper. Because the existing newspaper Il Nuovo Postiglione already had the formal monopoly, the permission was granted subject that the new newspaper of Antonio Graziosi was only a reprint of a foreign newspaper. The first issue of Notizie del mondo of Venice was issued on 28 November 1778. It stated to be a reprint with additions of the newspaper with the same name published in Florence since 1768. Notizie del mondo of Venice had initially in its first page two dates, the date of Florence and the actual date of printing in Venice. The content was however completely independent from the newspaper of Florence. Since the first number of 1779, the Venetian Notizie del mondo quit the graphic design of the Florentine Notizie del mondo. Since the first number of 1785, the double dates were no more used; and since the issue 85 of the same year disappeared the indication to be a reprint. The Notizie del mondo of Venice had a good reception by the public. The circulation in 1782 was higher than 2000 copies. It was mainly sold as annual or biannual subscription in all main towns of North Italy, but only in Venice it was possible to buy single issues. The annual cost of subscription was one sequin. The Notizie del mondo covered mainly foreign politic affair, with fresh news from France. The editorial line of the Graziosi was slightly in favor of the French revolution and against the politic line of the Patriarchate of Venice. From 1789 the editor-in-chief was Giuseppe Compagnoni, who resigned in 1794 when the censorship became more stiff due to the revolutionary events in France. After the Compagnoni, the editor-in-chief became the Sicilian abbot Saverio Scrofani. A number of 1798 Notizie del mondo was published two times a week up to 22 May 1797, daily up to 1800 when it returned to be published two times a week. From 5 July 1808 it was published three times a week, from 1809 the periodicity changed many times and in 1815 it was again published daily. The length was usually eight pages when published two times a week, four pages when published more often. By order of the government of the Kingdom of Italy, on 14 March 1812 the publications were interrupted along with all other newspapers in Venice, substituted by the Giornale dipartimentale dell'Adriatico published however always by the Graziosi under the direction of Antonio Caminer. The Notizie del mondo was resumed in early 1815 and published daily that year. The last number was published on 30 December 1815.

Her disappearance, the search for her, and the trial and conviction of Nerijus Bilevicius for her murder received widespread media attention in Sweden and Scandinavia. Murder On 7 June 2015, 17-year-old Lisa Holm was about to end her shift at a cafe were she had been working for the summer in Blomberg close to Källby in Västergötland. She sent a text message at 18:23 to her father in Skövde, where she explained that she was on her way home on her moped. When Holm did not show up her father drove to her workplace hoping she was still there. When at the cafe he found her moped with keys still in the ignition, the cafe owner and Lisa's father searched the cafe and nearby areas without finding anything. At 21:47 they called the police and reported Holm missing. The police soon arrived and started dog searches in the area, in a barn there with several rooms, but found nothing. A glove was later found there. Discovery of body On Tuesday 9 June, the search team found Holm's cellphone case, receipts, tickets and similar items, all of which was identified as owned by Holm. On Wednesday 10 June, the search area was extended, and the Swedish version of the organization Missing People was called in to help with the search. That day a pair of earrings was found in the barn. Her license card for her moped and keys to her home were also found that day. On Friday 12 June, Missing People searched the Martorp estate a few kilometres from the cafe. Two people arrived there by car claiming that the area already had been searched. Missing People representatives became suspicious and called police. They continued to search the area and found a jacket and a helmet belonging to Holm. Later that same night Holm's body was found in a workshed nearby. Trial The county court concluded that Holm had been murdered by hanging or strangulation. Technical evidence showed that Lithuanian citizen Nerijus Bilevicius's DNA was on pieces of rope and ten pieces of Holm's clothing, both inside and out, as well as all over the crime scene. Police and the court also found that Bilevicius had no alibi for the day of the murder. The motive was of a sexual nature. In his computer police found pornography, and technical findings showed that he had been very active sexually in the shed. His actions at Martorp when Missing People first showed up also indicated that he did not want police to continue searching that particular area. The circumstances were considered especially heinous by investigators as Holm was only seventeen years old and physically weaker than Bilevicius. He showed great ruthlessness and criminal intent and police stated that Holm had suffered before finally being murdered at the scene. Bilevicius was sentenced to life imprisonment on 17 November 2015. His attorney Björn Hurtig filed at the court of appeals on 15 April 2016. Hurtig's reasons to appeal his client's sentence were given as someone else having helped or committed the murder and removed the body of Holm, such as the convict's wife. On 2 May 2016, the court of appeals declined to grant a new review or trial, and his life sentence became final. Conviction and aftermath On 4 July 2016, it was announced that Bilevicius would be placed at Norrtälje Prison, a high-security facility. He was transferred to Lithuania in early 2017, and later that year won an appeal and got 15 years, but by an appellate court in Siauliai in late 2017 his sentence was again set at life imprisonment.

The term can be used to describe when people have blood pressure measurements that abruptly fluctuates from being abnormally high, approximately 130/80mm Hg or over and returns to its normal range. Patients who have labile hypertension may have higher cardiac output and lower total peripheral resistance than others. Behavioural and lifestyle factors are the two main factors that causes labile hypertension to occur. Extrinsic factors such as physical activities, insomnia and intake of sodium are likely to increase the occurrence of labile hypertension. Reduced arterial compliance and baroreflex failure may contribute to trigger a response as well. Diagnosis is typically by 24 hours ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to which measurements can be taken at home without having to visit to the physician’s office. Labile hypertension can be a primary risk factor that may contribute to stroke or cardiovascular disease (CVD). Prevention of life threatening complications involves lifestyle changes such as avoidance of smoking and reducing the amount of salt, caffeine and alcohol intake. There are no set criteria to treat labile hypertension as there are many underlying mechanisms that varies depending on the symptoms. Because stressors are the main cause of labile hypertension, common treatment may involve prescription medications such as anti-anxiety tablets to reduce emotional stressors, and otherwise, as well as decrease the risk of labile hypertension. Pathophysiology are still finding specific therapeutic and prevention of labile hypertension. TOC  Types  There are two different types of hypertension, though, the underlying mechanisms to which the blood pressure fluctuates from being normal to abnormally high remains the same. * Labile hypertension: Normally occur during emotional or social stressors and may not physically show symptoms. Currently, there are limitations of current knowledge behind the mechanisms of labile hypertension and clinicians are still finding future clinical management. * Paroxysmal hypertension: Occur randomly during the day but it is said that paroxysmal hypertension are caused by repressed distressed emotions such as intense fear due to past trauma. Some of the physical symptoms that accompany include headache, weakness and fear. Paroxysmal hypertension is different from panic disorder in which they are characterised with extreme elevation of blood pressure that is not triggered by fear. In panic disorder, elevation of blood pressure is generally mild and is normally triggered by fear or panic. There is a small percentage, approximately 2% who raises suspicion for have pheochromocytoma, a tumour in the adrenal glands. This involves the sympathetic nervous system and treatment for paroxysmal hypertension is available.  Symptoms  Generally, labile hypertension does not present any physical symptoms during fluctuations of blood pressure. Elevation and decrease of blood pressure reading usually occurs without intervention. However, if the normal resting pressure remains abnormally excessive, common signs and symptoms that are present include: Headache, Heart palpitations, Flushing, Tinnitus (ringing or buzzing noise in one or both ears), Weakness of body, Dizziness and diaphoresis. Some may describe the episodes as abrupt in onset such that they were not evoked by stress. Episodes of these symptoms may range from half an hour to many hours and frequently of attacks ranged from once or twice a day to a few months. = Complications = Typically, an increase in blood pressure may put strain on the heart and possibly other organs that may cause damage to the blood vessels, eyes and the heart. Uncontrollable increase in blood pressure can cause damage to the arteries that are present around kidneys, and thus restrict the blood to deliver. Due to inconsistent fluctuations in blood pressure, this can cause additional problems to people with pre-existing heart or blood vessel conditions such as angina, cerebral aneurysm or aortic aneurysm. Uncontrolled pressure in the blood can lead to further complications such as vascular dementia as the narrowed arteries can reduce and limit blood flow to the brain.  Causes  It is important to understand that it is common for blood pressure to rise and fall dramatically when dealing with stressors in people’s everyday life. While these can be normal, others may be serious. Possible causes alone or in conjunction that can cause labile hypertension are in the following criteria. * Caffeine: consumption of caffeine may constrict blood vessels that may stimulate and display unexpected spikes in blood pressure. Researchers believe that caffeine could possible block hormones that normally keeps arteries widened. Caffeine may also cause adrenal glands to release adrenaline which causes the blood pressure to dramatically increase. *White Coat Syndrome: occurs in situations when people are anxious with their visit to the doctor or General Practitioner (GP) which can elevate blood pressure readings. *Pheochromocytoma: Normally, in a healthy person, the non-cancerous tumour that is present in the adrenal gland is responsible for releasing hormones that can cause the blood pressure to change. However, if diagnosed with Pheochromocytoma, there will be a neuroendocrine tumour that is found in the adrenal gland which can cause overproduction of induced hormones that can lead to episodic of high blood pressure. * Salt: People may develop blood pressure spikes in high sodium intake that is contained in meals. High sodium intake may put extra strain in arteries which causes the muscles in the artery walls to become thicker. The radius inside the artery space will be smaller. As the arteries are constricted, organs such as the heart that receives the blood from the arteries decreases. This will reduces the amount of oxygen and nutrients they need and may cause possible damage to organs. At early stage, it may cause a slight reduction of blood flowing to the heart that may lead to angina. Salt can also cause damage to the brain such that there is reduction of blood that reaches the brain and may lead to vascular dementia. According to The American Heart Association (AHA), the recommended daily salt intake is 2300 mg. *Anxiety: environmental stressors are exposed in daily lives that can cause sudden increase in blood pressure. For example, emotional stressors leads to severe reduction of arterial blood pressure. *Baroreflex failure: In the human body, baroreflexes maintain blood pressure homeostasis. Typically, the three circumstances that baroreflexes can fail are: problems with the central processing, damage to the Autonomic Nervous System which is associated with damage to parasympathetic and sympathetic damage and damage to carotid sinus that can cause failure to afferent signalling. Labile hypertension can occur through exposure to everyday lifestyles. Some of these include are the usage of tobacco. Tobacco significantly increase blood pressure and heart rate temporarily and can damage the artery walls caused by the chemicals that are contained in tobacco. Chemicals in tobacco include nicotine and carbon monoxide interferes with the cardiovascular system (CVD). Nicotine is a stimulant that releases vasopressin, and can cause the blood vessel to constrict and thus can reduce the amount of blood to flow. Carbon monoxide is a toxic chemical that binds haemoglobin (molecule in the blood that carries oxygen) will decrease the amount of oxygen delivered to the cells and cause damage to other organs in the body. Damage to the arterial walls can cause vasoconstriction, allowing the arteries to narrow which can increase the risk of heart disease. Drinking too much alcohol moderately (more than one drink for women and two drinks for men) can cause damage to the heart. Researchers have found that heavy drinkers can lead to episodes of tachycardia, a problem with the electrical signalling that can elevate heart rate. Frequent drinking can lead blood clots and may increase severity of heart attack or stroke.  Diagnosis  Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring: A non-invasive portable device that can monitor and record blood pressure automatically during specific time of the day, especially is focused on people who have White Coat Syndrome as it can reduce the elevation of blood pressure during the visit in the examination room. This can allow doctors to identify results and observe patterns. Patients who normally undergo ambulatory blood pressure monitoring are suggested to keep record on the periods of awake and asleep times, medication intake and periods when exposed to exercise. This allows the clinicians to eliminate the transition periods when blood pressure rapidly elevates. The blood pressure reading is recorded as two numbers, systolic and diastolic. The systolic blood pressure represents the amount of pressure the blood is applying against artery walls during heartbeats whereas the diastolic blood pressure shows while the heart is resting between beats. Electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG): A clinical test to measure and record electrical conductivity of the heart. It helps determine defects of heart electrical activity, rhythm and rate to help assist in diagnosis of heart defects that may affect in heart rhythm such as tachycardia and coronary artery blood flow (e.g. ischemia). Electrodes are placed on the surface of the skin and connected to the amplifier to detect electrical changes in the cardiac muscle when it is depolarising and repolarising.  Treatment  There are no specific set criteria to treat labile hypertension. This is because the condition is not yet well defined and makes it difficult for doctors to treat labile hypertension as medications are usually given for patients who have hypertension. Generally, doctors will suggest people to monitor and observe their blood pressure throughout the day, preferably for 24 hours, as commonly prescribed medications available today for blood pressure may not be effective. Because labile hypertension is mainly caused by anxiety, in occurrence to short term situations, doctors will often prescribe anti-anxiety medications that may help reduce any stressors. Some of the common medications to reduce anxiety includes: * Alprazolam (Xanax): oral tablet that has an enhancing effect to help prevent panic or anxiety disorders. * Clonazepam (Klonopin): oral tablet that helps prevent seizures and panic attacks. * Diazepam (Valium): may help reduce the effect of anxiety when withdrawal with alcohol intake. * Lorazepam (Ativan): Should be taken in short period of time between 2-4weeks that reduces anxiety. Long-term treatment of anxiety that requires daily medication would include: Paroxetine (Paxil),Sertraline (Zoloft), Escitalopram (Lexapro), Citalopram (Celexa). Otherwise, a prescription drug called Clonidine is used to lower blood pressure by relaxing the blood vessels. This will prevent life threatening problems such as stroke, heart attacks and kidney problems. Beta blockers are medications that often prevent paroxysmal and labile hypertension as they interact with the sympathetic nervous system. Beta blockers help reduce blood pressure by blocking the effects of hormone epinephrine, also known as adrenaline. The effect of taking beta blockers can help lower the heart rate as well as help improve the blood flow by opening up the blood vessels widely. Doctors may prescribe beta blockers as one of the medications that help reduce blood pressure , including diuretics and calcium channel blockers. = Management = Labile hypertension can be initially treated through behavioural modifications. Behavioural factors such as the mental activity of an individual or emotional status should be managed. Anxiety is one of the common forms of mental illness, there are increasing risks that can affect physical health problems. Therefore, to reduce stress and anxiety, reduction to smoking and alcohol, decreasing intake of salt or having regular aerobic activity are some examples of therapy that can help manage cases of labile hypertension. By reducing alcohol intake, the systolic blood pressure will lower by 2-4mm Hg and the diastolic blood pressure by 1–2 mm Hg. However, doctors will preferably suggest patients to monitor blood pressure at home during modification of lifestyle and behavioural changes.  Epidemiology  The prevalence of labile hypertension in USA is estimated to have more than 40 million adults which can develop the risks of hemorrhagic stroke. Labile hypertension is most common in Charlottesville, Virginia with up to 11% of the population. Average age who have labile hypertension is 64±13 years. It was found that ageing was one of the characteristics that highly associates with fluctuations of blood pressure such that during day or night time, the systolic and diastolic pressure alternates and shows abnormal diurnal pattern.

Founded in 1851, it retains exclusive rights to harvest granite from Ailsa Craig, granted by the Marquess of Ailsa. Kays of Scotland produces the only stones used in competition by the World Curling Federation and is the sole supplier of curling stones to the Winter Olympic Games.  History  Prior to the foundation of Kays of Scotland, there was little regulation to the sport of curling and stones of any shape or size were used. Through a process of elimination, stones from Ailsa Craig were found to be highly resistant to splintering, making them desirable for this purpose. In 1851, William Kay and sons Andrew and Thomas created Kays of Mauchline, a workshop in Haugh, East Ayrshire, Scotland and later received permission from the family who owned the island of Ailsa Craig to harvest granite for the manufacture of curling stones. The company eventually found itself under the stewardship of Thomas Kay's wife's brother-in-law, James Wyllie, and has remained a business wholly owned by the Wyllie family. Descendant James \\"Jimmy\\" Wyllie currently owns the company. curling stones. In 1911, Kays of Scotland moved their operation 2 km north from their original water-powered mill at the bank of the River Ayr by Mauchline. A shipment of 278 Kays Excelsior Ailsa curling stones destined for three curling clubs in Canada was among the cargo of the SS Athenia passenger liner when a torpedo from a German submarine sank her in the Western Approaches on 3 September 1939. This was the first UK ship to be sunk by Germany during World War II. Kays of Scotland have supplied curling stones to every Winter Olympic Games since Chamonix in 1924, with the exception of the 2002 event in Salt Lake City.  Manufacture of curling stones  For the main body of each curling stone Kays uses Ailsa Craig Common Green granite. Kays inserts Ailsa Craig Blue Hone granite \\"Ailserts\\" as the running surface of the stone. Due to its status as a wildlife reserve by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, blasting and quarrying at Ailsa Craig is restricted. In 2002, Kays of Scotland was permitted to collect 1,500 tons of granite already displaced on the island. Its next collection of granite from the island was in 2013, harvesting 2,000 tons, expected to yield 10,000 curling stones. The Kays workshop employs six craftsmen and produces five stones a day.

The novel centres around archaeologist David Norfolk as he searches for a Portuguese shipwreck off the coast of New South Wales. Wrack is Bradley’s first published work of fiction and has been nominated for various awards including the Miles Franklin Award and Australia’s Commonwealth Writer’s Prize for Best First Book. Wrack was selected by the Board of Studies, Teaching and Educational Standards to be included in the list of prescribed texts for English in the Higher School Certificate from 1999 to 2000 as well as from 2015 to 2018. TOC  Plot Summary  In 1794, the English ship Berkeley is cast upon an unknown shore in New South Wales due to a storm. Upon exploring the land, the crew suddenly stumble across a shipwreck which they believe to be of Portuguese or Spanish origin. They find papers on board when exploring the shipwreck which are dated to 1519. Fearing the implication which this discovery might have on the English claim to Australia, Captain Bells swears the entirety of the crew to secrecy, warning them to never reveal the existence of the shipwreck. In present day, archaeologist David Norfolk is searching for the wreck of a Portuguese ship on the south coast of New South Wales. He is accompanied on the dig by fellow archaeologist Anna as well as his students. They begin digging in the area where their aerial magnetometer has detected an anomalous signal and discover a body wrapped up in an army blanket. The body is taken away by detectives for examination in Sydney. David is allowed to watch the autopsy and so travels to the police station where he is greeted by Claire, his ex-lover, who he learns is working as a forensic medical examiner for the police. Following her down to the morgue, David watches Claire as she examines the body which they extrapolate to be a Caucasian male from the 20th century who died from four gunshot wounds. Back at the site, David learns about an old man in a shack nearby who David could potentially question for information. David travels to the shack and meets Kurt Seligmann, an ailing, elderly man with disfigurations on his face and body. When asked about his knowledge on the shipwreck, Kurt tells David to come back the next day. David returns to the archaeological site where Anna and the students have found fragments of farm machinery. Assuming it to be cause of the magnetometer anomaly, the team is disappointed as it marks the end of their expedition. The next day, David visits the shack again in an attempt to get Kurt to talk, but Kurt has a seizure. After treating him, the local doctor tells David that Kurt has inoperable cancer and needs to be hospitalised. David convinces the doctor to let him and Claire move in to nurse and look after Kurt. Claire arrives and after a while, David manages to convince Kurt to tell his story. While Kurt is recounting his experiences, David reflects on his own life and his obsession with the ship grows, posing a strain on his relationship with Claire. Claire believes that Kurt is leading David on and begins to see the old man's dark nature. Despite this, she stays with David and the two grow closer, emotionally and physically. In the 1930s, Kurt, as an archaeology university student, hears a lecture disputing the existence of a Portuguese shipwreck off the coast of Australia. Kurt recalls seeing the ship as a boy and his public defence of the ship's existence brings him to the attention of Fraser McDonald, a university lecturer who approaches Kurt to discuss the ship. Kurt becomes Fraser's research assistant despite their different backgrounds. While socialising with the McDonald family, Kurt meets opera singer Veronica Marshall in 1935 and falls in love with her despite the unspoken expectation that she will marry Fraser. Meanwhile, Fraser and Kurt's search for the ship yields no results and they are severely criticised within their department at university for their research. While Kurt is sent away to find more conclusive evidence, Fraser and Veronica engage in a relationship with each other. Fraser and Veronica are married but Veronica pursues an affair with Kurt a few months after the wedding. Although she expresses doubt with their marriage, Veronica is still unwilling to leave Fraser for Kurt. World War II breaks out in 1939 and both Kurt and Fraser are conscripted to serve in Singapore. Veronica follows them and admits at last that she is in love with Kurt. Veronica is forced to leave when the crisis in Singapore worsens. Meanwhile, Fraser is in danger in Kulai and Kurt searches for him as a way to appease his guilt over his relationship with Veronica. Kurt manages to rescue Fraser and the two drive back to the wharf only to discover that Veronica did not make it onto the ship and is now presumably dead. Back in Sydney after Singapore's fall, Fraser uncovers a letter between Kurt and Veronica, exposing their affair. Fraser arrives on Kurt's doorstep, inebriated and armed with a revolver. The two fight, and Kurt shoots Fraser four times, revealing that Fraser was the body which David discovered earlier in the novel. Kurt wraps Fraser's corpse in a blanket, buries the body in the beach, destroys any evidence of murder and stages Fraser's death as suicide. Kurt is drafted to New Guinea, where he is injured, resulting in his disfigurement and an addiction to morphine. After two years in a hospital, Kurt returns to Australia where he continues to search for the ship. In the present, Kurt reveals that he returned to the sand dunes, bought the shack and began digging for the wreck. David frantically questions Kurt about the ship's location. Laughing, Kurt finally reveals that he in fact found the shipwreck eventually but burnt it to be rid of his past. Leaving David with the nihilistic message that \\"the past is nothing, and we are nothing\\", Kurt then dies.  Background and writing history  Wrack is Bradley's first novel. Prior to the writing and publication of Wrack, Bradley studied philosophy and law at the University of Adelaide. After finishing university in 1991, Bradley worked as a lawyer while writing poetry and screenplays before quitting his career in law in order to focus on writing. While writing Wrack, Bradley supported himself by working night shifts at a 24-hour video store in Darlinghurst. In regards to his writing process, Bradley elucidated in an interview with Catherine Bradshaw during June 1998 that: Bradley states that development for Wrack began as a fragmentary merge of concepts: As he recognises himself in the 'Acknowledgements' section at the end of the novel, Bradley was heavily inspired by Kenneth McIntyre's book 'The Secret Discovery of Australia' which linked the theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia with the Mahogany Ship, a putative shipwreck of Portuguese origin supposedly spotted in the 19th century a few kilometres west of Warrnambool, Victoria. Initially, Bradley had planned for the shipwreck in his novel to be of Chinese origin, having been inspired after reading Eric Rolls' book 'Sojourners' which detailed the history of the Chinese in Australia. However, a reference in Rolls' book to the story of the Mahogany ship caused Bradley to change the direction of his novel. Bradley explained in the Bradshaw interview how \\"the mahogany ship was one of [his] starting points, since it was reading about the ship that led [him] to the story about the maps and the whole dispute about Portuguese exploration in Australia.\\" Wrack utilised excerpts from various sources that Bradley acknowledged at the end of the novel. These include Lawrence Fitzgerald's 'Java La Grande: The Portuguese Discovery of Australia', the 'Shorter Oxford English Dictionary' and the 'Grove Concise Dictionary of Music'. Bradley has commented that the finished novel which he ended up writing completely differed from the one he had initially envisioned.  Style  Wrack is a hybridised bricolage made up of different forms and genres. The novel blends stylistic elements from a vast number of areas including historical fiction, crime fiction, mystery fiction, philosophical fiction and romance. Bradley incorporates a variety of textual forms within the novel including prose, journal entries, historical discussion, letters, and dictionary definitions. Later editions of the book also contain cartographic images of 16th century maps, obtained and reproduced with permission from the British Library and the John Rylands Collection of the University of Manchester. In regards to Wrack's hybridised, unconventional form, Bradley stated in an interview with Patrick Cullen in Opus that he was \\"very much influenced by [his] experiences as a poet\\" and that he wanted to \\"transfer that incredibly potent...power into prose as much as I can, to try and get at things - moods, feelings, experiences, connections - that are often difficult to get at in conventional prose.\\" Pierre Desceliers's 'Harleian' World Map (1536) is a subject of discussion in Wrack. It is also one of the four maps which Bradley included as images in later editions of the novel. Bradley frequently makes intertextual references to other works including those of Neil Gaiman or Michael Ondaatje as epigraphs at the beginning of each chapter. The novel makes use of both first and third person narration. Wrack is structured into 8 main sections and makes use of a non-linear, multiple narrative structure where the three main stories that are being told simultaneously overlap and interconnect at various points in the novel. Flashbacks, interior monologues, varying narrative voices and shifting time frames are literary devices which Bradley frequently employs within the novel. The multi-layered narrative of the story is often interwoven with seemingly non-fiction discussion on topics relating to cartography and history. Bradley describes such historical material contained within Wrack to be \\"a combination of fact, fiction, and speculation\\" because he has taken considerable liberties with moulding the facts and opinions of various sources to fit his fictional purposes. Bradley commented in an interview with Catherine Bradshaw that \\"most of the time in Wrack I used very sparse, denuded language, which is designed to reflect the simplicity and emptiness of the dunes and the sea, which are big parts of the imagery\\". The novel contains no quotation marks or attribution of speech, meaning the dialogue of the text is merged with the authorial monologue and narration. This also results in the blurring of voices as it becomes harder for the reader to distinguish who is saying what.  Themes  According to Bradshaw, discovery is a central theme to Wrack because the novel not only incorporates ideas of historical and scientific discoveries of archaeologists and explorers but also the personal and emotional discoveries which the characters of the story undergo. Wrack was selected by the Board of Studies, Teaching and Educational Standards to be included in the list of prescribed texts for study in a conceptual exploration of 'Discovery' in the Higher School Certificate from 2015 to 2018. The text had also been previously featured in the topic area 'Discovery' for English during the 1999 and 2000 HSC. The veracity of history is another prominent theme in Wrack which questions the notion of an absolute and unequivocal voice of truth and draws on concepts of historical revisionism. As Bradley stated in an interview for Stephen Muecke's 'Maps of the Heart' in The Australian Review of Books on 12 March 1997: English educator Bruce Pattinson and senior English teacher Marian Thomas both comment that Wrack explores the complexity of relationships by illuminating the degree of intricacy in David and Claire's relationship and by paralleling the wartime love triangle of Kurt, Fraser and Veronica with David, Claire and Paul (or Anna). Other thematic concerns which resonate through the novel involve concepts of ambiguity, illusion, memory and obsession.  Publication and reception  = Publication History = Wrack was originally published in Australia during 1997 by Random House Australia. The novel was first published in the United Kingdom in 1998 by Headline and in the United States in 1999 by Henry Holt and Company, Inc. Multiple editions of the novel have since been published including a 2009 edition by Faber and Faber. Later editions of the book contain added material, specifically cartographic images of 16th century maps and an amended 'Acknowledgements' section which give recognition to the British Library and the John Rylands Collection of the University of Manchester for granting permission for the reproduction of such images. In 2009, an audio book version of the novel was released by Bolinda Publishing with narration by Humphrey Bower. = Reception = Wrack was met with generally positive reviews from critics who praised the form and the multi-genre nature of the novel. Sybil Steinberg for Publishers Weekly described Wrack as a \\"seamless fusion of dramatic wartime love story, historical fiction and archeological murder mystery\\" and commended Bradley's skill in interweaving the novel's elements together to \\"create a graceful mediation on death, ambition and obsession\\". In a review for The Observer, Mary Fitzgerald stated that Wrack is \\"occasionally marred by Bradley's florid prose\\" but concluded that the novel is \\"a captivating story none the less\\". David Callahan, an Associate Professor of English at the University of Aveiro, praised Wrack in his review in the journal Antipodes for its structure and its intertwining connections but criticised Bradley for his \\"lazy locutions\\" and his inaccurate references to Portuguese history which \\"give the impression of someone who hasn't done his homework.\\" Deloris Tarzan Ament of the Seattle Times stated that the lack of quotation marks in the novel may be problematic for readers but called Wrack \\"impressively ambitious\\" and applauded Bradley's \\"brief bursts of poetic reflection\\". Wrack won the Fellowship of Australian Writers' Literature Award as well as the Kathleen Mitchell Literary Award. The novel also received nominations for various other awards including the Miles Franklin Award and Australia’s Commonwealth Writer’s Prize for Best First Book. Following the publication of Wrack, Bradley was named a 'Best Young Australian Novelist' in 1998 by the Sydney Morning Herald.

Between the 1960s and 1970s, architecture in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) remained solely traditional, with narrow alleys and windtower houses still in use, reflective of a strong Bedouin heritage. Architecture is influenced by elements of Islamic, Arabian and Persian culture. In the early 1970s, Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, the then ruler of Dubai, employed British architect John R Harris to create the stylish modernist architecture for which the major cities of the UAE are known today. The introduction of exposed glass curtain walls represented the beginning of a movement, used extensively in the design of almost every commercial and high rise building façade in the Persian Gulf. In less commercial areas, Emirati architecture continues to heavily reflects the custom and traditional lifestyles of the native people. Building materials are simple, in contrast with the refined images of Dubai and Abu Dhabi today.  Traditional influences  Traditional architecture in the United Arab Emirates was heavily influenced by the desert landscape, culture, lifestyle and available building materials. The Bedouin, a nomadic Arabic tribe who traditionally live in the desert were well known for using palm frond shelters, known as arish in the summer months. Frames for arish houses were often made with mangrove poles, imported from East Africa. In colder months, a move towards using animal skin shelters would be made. The Bedouin tent was a useful and adaptable structure often made of sheep wool, camels’ hair or goat hair by the women of the tribe. Such structures were called Bait al Sha’ar, meaning ‘House of Hair’. Other materials such as a mixture of seashells and limestone were used as building resources in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The nomadic nature of the Bedouin tribe demanded the need for light disposable materials that could be found along coastal lines. In contrast, permanent houses inland were constructed with a mud mixture formed into bricks, strengthened using stones bonded together with a mixture of red clay and manure. The geographical context of a tribe or group determined the type of materials that were used in the construction of buildings, meaning that most structures were made of materials drawn from the surrounding environment. These ranged from coral, mud and stone through to palm fronds and animal hair. The harsh climate of the United Arab Emirates created a need for ventilation due to high temperature periods of the year. This resulted in the introduction of Iranian windtowers, known as barjeels. These vertical shafts allow for a downward flow of cool air and a distribution of water to become available at the bottom of the structure, allowing for the inside temperature of the building to be cooled.  Ancient architecture in the United Arab Emirates  Al-Ain, at the base of Jebel Hafeet (Mount Hafeet) While human settlement in the United Arab Emirates can be traced back to the Stone Age (6,000–3,200 BC), it was not until the Bronze Age (3,200–1,300 BC) that larger establishments began to form. Such settlements were developed in inland oases and coastal areas, populated by farmers, animal herders and fisherman. The first recorded large settlement was the town of Al Ain, through which inhabitants would export agricultural products through the port of Umm Al Nar, located off Abu Dhabi Island. This was a permanent establishment made up of well-constructed buildings built from cut and dressed stone, complete with circular tower-like tombs. Evidence from these sites indicates a strong trade evolving from pottery production and the export of copper, particularly between these settlements and surrounding civilisations such as Mesopotamia. Cross section of a qanat A water irrigation system known as qanat emerged in the Iron Age (1,300–300 BC). This system provided a relatively constant water supply all year round by taking advantage of underground water supplies, leading to a change in settlement patterns as groups would follow the route of the water source. Up until the mid 20th century (marking the beginning of Western attention to the area), most building fell into five categories: religious, residential, markets, public, and defensive buildings. Buildings that were constructed up until then remained within traditional styles. Unlike other styles of Islamic and Persian architecture, there is little ornamentation found in traditional architecture of the UAE. Only a small number of mosques offer any form of ornamentation, reflecting the lack of resources at hand and general reliance on simple but effective structures.  1980s and globalisation  The onset of the Globalisation era of the 1980s saw the United Arab Emirates become one of the most developed countries in the Persian Gulf region. The country saw a major economic boost with transforming into a commodity based economy, with shipments of oil and natural gas accounting for 40% of total exports and 38% of GDP. In the past two decades, significant effort has been made to diversify the economy and reduce dependency on oil revenues, with huge investments in tourism, financial and construction sectors. Since the late 1980s, architecture of the United Arab Emirates has become renowned for its urban image, becoming highly westernised but still retaining elements of traditional Emirati culture.  Economic development  UAE's product exports in 28 colour-coded categories Initial economic development in the UAE during the 1950s and 1960s was based heavily on the oil and gas industry, since diversifying into manufacturing, construction and commerce. The oil and gas sector accounts for approximately two thirds of the UAE’s revenue, employing one percent of the work force while Trades and Repairs Services, Construction ad Manufacturing account for 50% of the work force. In the past decades, high population growth in the UAE has been accompanied by high economic growth. GDP growth rate averaged 4.51% from 2000 until 2017, reaching an all-time high of 9.80% in 2006. This has been followed with a greater standard of living, with the current Human Development Index (HDI) standing at 0.863, ranking the UAE 34th in the world. The overall economic outlook for the UAE is for continued growth with faster development than any other major Gulf State, encouraged significantly by tourism, manufacturing and financial sectors. In contrast to other countries in the Persian Gulf, in which oil wealth tends to be centralised around the governing royal family, the UAE aims to distribute and invest such wealth from natural resources into the infrastructure of the nation. Within the last 40 years, the government of the UAE has developed sufficient infrastructure for the Emirati population, including electricity, transport, housing, telecommunications and hospitals. These are all heavily subsidised. An open economic policy has allowed for multinational corporations to develop and operate through industrial and commercial businesses. This has resulted in the dynamic and internationally faceted infrastructure for which the UAE is renowned for. Additionally, the UAE has taken the commercial and technological resources offered by the West to promote and integrate their economy into a global setting. Architecture of the state is heavily influenced by the inflow of wealth that has resulted from the economic boom of recent decades. Nonetheless, recent urban and commercial development in all major cities of the UAE continued to be influenced by Islamic architecture, giving these global metropoles a distinct Arabic background.  Major cities  = Dubai = Skyline of Downtown Dubai with Burj Khalifa Early construction after the expansion of Dubai as a global city paid little attention to traditional Islamic architecture and concerns for the environment were not considered. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, glass towers became prominent in the city of Dubai, all of which required enormous amounts of electricity to keep cool. Recently, builders and architects have become aware of both Arabic heritage and environmental concerns, leading to more harmonious development overseen by Dubai’s rulers in the last 20 years. Efficient heat resistant materials are increasingly used in construction, combined with traditional Arabic designs. This can be seen in the buildings for which Dubai has attracted worldwide attention for, including the Burj Khalifa and Burj Al Arab. The Burj Khalifa was inaugurated in January 2010, unveiled as the world’s tallest freestanding structure at 829.8 m (2.722 ft.). The structure is host to several mixed facilities, including commercial shops, offices, entertainment venues and residential sectors. In designing the building, the lead architect Adrian Smith undertook elements of traditional Islamic architecture, which uses stepped ascending spirals. This reflected elements of Islamic design while creating a strategic shape to ensure the mass of the building reduces with height, allowing for a stronger and more fortified structure. The building supposedly ascends from a flower shaped based, imitating the Hymenocallis, a white lily native to the surrounding desert. The Burj Al Arab (translated to ‘Arabian tower’) was designed by architect Tom Wright to resemble a J-class yacht. The structure is made of a steel frame exterior wrapped around a concrete tower, with white Teflon encased fibreglass forming the ‘sail’. The Burj Al Arab stands on an artificial island 280 m (918.6 ft.) from Jumeirah Beach. The architect claimed that \\"the client wanted a building that would become a symbolic statement for Dubai, similar to Sydney with its Opera House, London with Big Ben or Paris with the Eiffel Tower. It needed to be a building that would become synonymous with the name of the city.\\" The building opened in 1999 after five years of construction. = Abu Dhabi = Etihad Towers in the evening In 1967, Abu Dhabi's architecture was planned under the guidance of Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan by Japanese architect Katsuhiko Takahashi. In areas of high population density, there is a large amount of medium and high rise buildings, amongst the city’s notable skyscrapers; the Etihad towers, the National Bank of Abu Dhabi headquarters, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority Tower, the Aldar headquarters and the Emirates Palace, heavily influenced by its Arab heritage. Abu Dhabi is home to several supertall skyscrapers. The development of tall buildings has been encouraged in the Abu Dhabi Plan 2030. The expansion of Abu Dhabi’s central business district continues to grow, with several skyscraper buildings under construction in the city. Some of the tallest buildings in Abu Dhabi include the Central Market Residential Tower at 328m (1,253.28 ft.), The Landmark at 324m (1,062.99 ft.) and the Sky Tower at 310 m (1017.06 ft.). In contrast to the heavily modernised skyscrapers of the city, the Sheikh Zayed Mosque continues to stand out as one of the most treasured sites of contemporary UAE society. Its design and construction began in November 1996, aiming to ‘unite the world’, employing artisans and materials from several countries including Germany, Italy, Turkey, Iran, Morocco, Pakistan, the UAE, Greece, New Zealand and China. The mosque is made of materials such as marble, stone, gold, ceramics and crystals, all chosen for their long-lasting qualities. As such, the structure is an ode to the globalised nature of modern architecture, but does by still incorporating many traditional facets of traditional Arabic design. Rural Emirati architecture Traditional house with windtowers in Dubai In less commercialised areas of the United Arab Emirates, architecture remains largely traditional, with barjeel structures still in use for practical purposes. Much of the UAE’s traditional vernacular architecture developed in the 18th and 19th centuries remains in less westernised areas of the state. Such settlements are established in response to specific social and environmental conditions; homes, market places, mosques and fortified buildings are all reflective of the interconnected influences between a group’s culture and trade. To this day, building materials are simple and reflective of resources at hand. The usage of stone guss, a lime mixture derived from seashells and a chalk and water paste is characteristic of more permanent inland houses. The structure of such houses is indicative of privacy and ventilation as central needs of the population, with high walls and limited visibility into buildings. Courtyard housing features are still utilised, designed to allow public interaction between male members of the household while preserving dignity and privacy of female family members. This is an example of traditional societal standards being well preserved through architectural fixtures in less commercialised areas. Rural and village architecture in the UAE is solely based on protecting occupants from the harsh environmental elements and climate of the geographical area. At a basic level, protection is needed from high temperatures, high humidity, high solar radiation, dust storms and desert winds. This is heavily reflected in the traditional and current use of courtyard houses and arish (houses built of palm tree leaves).

She is the second ship in the cruise line's history to sail under this name. She is the fourth Royal- class ship in the Princess fleet and commenced operations in October 2019. The ship measures 145,281 GT and has a capacity of 3,660 passengers.  History  = Planning and construction = Carnival Corporation first entered a strategic agreement with Fincantieri in March 2015 for five cruise ships for delivery between 2019 and 2022. From this agreement, the order for a then- unnamed, fourth Royal-class vessel was announced for Princess on 30 December 2015. The contract for this order was finalized on 2 April 2016. On 30 November 2017, Princess Cruises officially announced the name of the fourth Royal-class ship as Sky Princess, in honor of a previous Princess vessel that carried the same name. Construction began on 9 November 2016 with the steel cutting for the ship's bow at Fincantieri's shipyard in Castellammare di Stabia, with a separate milestone on 8 September 2017 marking the steel- cutting for the rest of the ship at Fincantieri's shipyard in Monfalcone. Her keel-laying was performed on 5 July 2018. She was floated out on 14 February 2019 and completed her sea trials in September 2019. = Debut = Sky Princess was officially delivered on 15 October 2019 in her handover ceremony at Fincantieri's shipyard in Monfalcone. The ship sailed a four-day pre- inaugural \\"shakedown\\" cruise for the press on 16 October 2019 from Trieste to Athens with a call in Kotor. She performed her official maiden voyage on 20 October 2019, a seven-day cruise sailing between Athens and Barcelona. She sailed a short inaugural season in the Mediterranean in fall 2019 before repositioning to her new homeport of Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, arriving on 1 December 2019. Due to high demand, two three-day inaugural cruises were scheduled on 1 December 2019 and 4 December 2019, with both cruising between Port Everglades and Princess Cays. Sky Princess was christened at Port Everglades on 7 December 2019 by NASA astronaut and U.S. Navy Captain Kay Hire and NASA engineer Poppy Northcutt. = Operational career = During the winter months, Sky Princess sails in the Caribbean from Port Everglades. For the summer months, she sails in Europe, including the Baltic region. In the fall, she sails along the Maritimes and New England from New York.

They are omnivorous, and are found in both benthic and pelagic regions of the ocean. Their diet includes krill, bivalves, and gastropods. They have evolved unique behaviors and morphological features in order to thrive in the cold and harsh Antarctic climate. N. neglecta is also commercially fished, although not in high numbers.Barrera-Oro & Casaux 1990, p. 207.  Anatomy and morphology  Members of N. neglecta have 3-7 dorsal spines, 37-40 dorsal soft rays, and 3-7 anal soft rays.Froese & Luna Younger fish have a black patch located near the tip of their pectoral fin.Froese & Luna N. neglecta vary in both size and weight. Sampled N. neglecta typically measure between 20 - 40 centimeters in length and typically weigh between 200 - 1600 grams.Barrera-Oro & Casaux 1990, p. 207. Notothenia neglecta has gut flora composed almost exclusively of the bacteria Vibrio,Cormack & Fraile 1990, p. 413. reflective of the ability of N. neglecta to tolerate high saline conditions and frequent ingestion of Antarctic krill,Cormack & Fraile 1990, p. 413. which is composed of high amounts of chitin.Cormack & Fraile 1990, p. 413. Vibrio in N. neglecta may also play a role in osmoregulationCormack & Fraile 1990, p. 416. via regulation of sodium ions.Cormack & Fraile 1990, p. 416. N. neglecta possess an inflammatory response pathway that has made the fish suitable for the cold Antarctic environment.Silva, Hernandez-Blazquez & Barbieri 1998, p. 212. Additionally, N. neglecta synthesizes eight antifreeze proteins to combat the freezing temperatures of the environment.Cheng, Fernandes, Detrich & DeVries 1990, p. 9265.  Distribution and habitat Notothenia neglecta is an Antarctic fish species that typically lives at a depth of 50 meters,Donatti & Fanta 2002, p. 146. but has also been found living a depths from 0 – 450 meters.Barrera-Oro & Casaux 1990, p. 207. Young N. neglecta are typically found at depths of 1–10 meters, and adults are typically found in deeper water.Froese & Luna In the Antarctic, they have been found in Antarctic peninsula waters, South Georgia Island, and Peter I Island.Barrera-Oro & Casaux 1990, p. 207. It is the dominant fish species in Potter Cove, King George Island, and the South Shetland Islands.Barrera-Oro & Casaux 1990, p. 207. N. neglecta display a wide and diverse diet. They are an omnivorous species,Barrera-Oro & Casaux 1990, p. 212. and feed on both benthic and pelagic species.Donatti & Fanta 2002, p. 146. Benthic N. neglecta most commonly feed on krill, but in the summertime, heavily prey on salps.Donatti & Fanta 2002, p. 146. N. neglecta has also been shown to feed on a variety of isopods, amphipods, algae, and bivalves.Barrera-Oro & Casaux 1990, p. 207.  Behavior  N. neglecta engage in unique behaviors that have allowed them to thrive in the harsh Antarctic climate. They typically feed at night, which may be attributed to avoidance of larger predators who tend to feed during the day,Donatti & Fanta 2002, p. 146. and also because many of the creatures they feed on are nocturnal.Donatti & Fanta 2002, p. 146. Aggressiveness in feeding has been linked to photoperiod, or availability of light throughout the day.Donatti & Fanta 2002, p. 146. They are less aggressive in their pursuit of prey during the day, but at night, the highest level of aggressiveness and pursuit are observed.Donatti & Fanta 2002, p. 146. N. neglecta has also demonstrated evidence of social hierarchy.Donatti & Fanta 2002, p. 149. Scientists have observed fish become less reactive to availability of prey in the presence of another member of their species.Donatti & Fanta 2002, p. 149. This suggests that these less reactive members may be the less dominant members of their groups.Donatti & Fanta 2002, p. 149. Once the other fish were removed from the environment, the original member would hunt prey as normal.Donatti & Fanta 2002, p. 149. N. neglecta only spawns once a year.Froese & Luna Females usually have their first spawn between the ages of 6 and 8 years old.Froese & Luna  Notes  References *Barrera-Oro, E. R., & Casaux, R. J.

Although many philosophers such as Francis Hutcheson, David Hume, and Thomas Reid are familiar to almost all philosophers it was not until the 19th century that the notion of ‘Scottish philosophy’ became recognized and held to high regard on an international level. In the 20th century, however, this tradition declined as Scottish educated philosophers left for England.  17th Century  Early philosophy served theology, that is the study of god and religion. Naturally, this emphasized the origins of sin and the corruption of human nature. The main topics of medieval philosophy include areas that are still studied in philosophy today. These topics related to the philosophy of religion which was also created during that time. Philosophy of religion contains many traditional philosophical problems that are presently still discussed, these being firstly the problem of the compatibility of the divine attributes. This refers to how that arises when we say that God can be omnipotent (all powerful), omniscient (all knowing) and omnibenevolent (all benevolent). Secondly, the problem of evil, which tries to address the contradiction that arises when explaining the creation of if God is all good and all knowing. Thirdly, the problem of the compatibility of divine foreknowledge with human free will. This is a continuation of the problem of evil as human free will is used to respond to the problem of evil but creates another contradiction with divine foreknowledge. In the High Middle Ages, a Scottish philosopher, John Duns Scotus (1265-1308) made significant impressions on the areas of natural theology, metaphysics, the theory of knowledge, ethics and moral philosophy. Natural Theology is the effort to establish the existence and nature of God through argument. Scotus’s stance on natural theology is that human beings can come to know God in ways apart from revelation. Scotus believes that all our knowledge is derived from our experience of sensible things and from this beginning, we can come to grasp God. During the 15th century, Scotland established three universities that were to become the foundation of Scottish philosophical tradition, these were University of St Andrews, the University of Glasgow and the University of Aberdeen. Scottish Philosophy was compulsory to all university students. While this pre-enlightenment period was primarily focused on the rehabilitation of the philosophy of their predecessors – writings of the Platonic and Aristotelian modes – this period was not without its accomplishments. The invention of the logarithmic tables by John Napier (1550-1617) allowed the development of the sciences, while significant contributions to science were made by other Scots such as James Gregory (1638-75), Robert Sibbald (1641-1722) and Archibald Pitcairne (1652-1713). In the second half of the 17th century, Scottish universities developed their own form of Cartesianism, influence in large part by Reformed Scholasticism of the first half of the 17th century. Mention of Descartes first appeared in the graduation theses by regent Andrew Cant for Marischal College, the University of Aberdeen in 1654. Cartesianism was very successful in Scottish universities. Until the end of the 1660s, the universities gradually incorporated occasional Cartesianism themes into the scholastic structure of the curriculum. Later, in the 1670s the curriculum was consolidated and structured according to the order of exposition of the new philosophy.  18th Century  Scottish Philosophy of this time overlaps with the period of Scottish Enlightenment. The Enlightenment was a period of rapid expansion of knowledge in all academic disciplines not limited to philosophy. Scottish philosophers of this time were extensively studied. The prominent ideas of this century include aesthetics, moral philosophy, natural law, rhetoric, common sense philosophy, etc. = Natural Law = The idea of natural law can first be found in Supplements and Observations upon Samuel Pufendorf's On the Duty of Man and Citizen according to the Law of Nature by Gershom Carmichael. Natural Law says that we are required to do what God prescribes to us as a sign of love and veneration. Failure to act in the prescribed manner is interpreted by God as expressing contempt or hatred. Natural law has two precepts which are distinguished as immediate and mediate duties. The first precept is the idea that we have an immediate to worship God so that he may receive our love and veneration for him. The second precept covers our mediate duties of promoting the common good by treating others well. These precepts form the foundation of natural law. The central figure of this narrative is God, hence before the application of the precepts in our duty as worshipers, we must first acknowledge God as the creator and ruler of the universe and all that resides within it. = Moral Philosophy = Moral Philosophy is the idea that to be morally good one must be motivated by benevolence and a desire for the happiness of others. The idea of moral philosophy was can be traced to Francis Hutcheson's work, A System of Moral Philosophy, first published in Glasgow in 1755. Hutcheson’s Moral philosophy emerged as a reaction to Hobbes’ phycological egoism and Clarke and Wollaston’s’ rationalism. The main objection was to the idea that compassion and benevolence are due to the calculations of self-interest and that people should be discouraged from making others sympathetic towards themselves since this reflected their self- interests and was therefore dishonest. Hutcheson believed that moral knowledge is gained through our moral senses, of which there are three, these senses are separate from our external five senses. The three senses are the public sense, the moral sense and the sense of honor. Public sense refers to how we empathize with the happiness or misery of others. The moral sense is how we perceive the good and bad ourselves and others and our reaction to that manifestation. Sense of honor our reaction of approval or praise when we see or commit a good action. Moral theory is mentioned in Aesthetic theory by Hutcheson in our moral sense of beauty; this sense refers to the idea that enjoying beautiful objects is not incidental upon seeing that object. = Aesthetics = Lord Kames defines beauty as anything that you can derive pleasure from in his Essays on the Principles of Morality and Natural Religion. Something is considered beautiful when it is regarded with respect to its purpose while an object that is poorly designed or has no purpose may be considered ugly. Therefore, a house may be considered beautiful in light of its purpose as a human residence. Objects that are beautiful may give rise to the feeling of pleasure in the observer. Thus, a ship may give pleasure because it is elegantly shaped as well as because it facilitates trade which in turn is a positive beneficial exchange. Likewise, pleasure can be applied to human action, actions that carry a positive intent such as acts of generosity towards a worthy recipient can be considered beautiful. This derivation of pleasure from the display of generosity or other virtues can be traced to the original constitution of our nature, that is that we experience pleasure through no conscious decision of our own when we see beauty.  19th Century  The influence of Immanuel Kant and German Idealism on the philosophical tradition of the Scottish Enlightenment changed the philosophical agenda in the 19th century. Enlightenment thinking became less important and the “science of the mind” was discussed. Logic, also known as the philosophy of truth and reason and the philosophy of perception dominated, whereby human understanding evolves through increasing human experience and knowledge. Since the aim of philosophy was to reconcile the seemingly incompatible elements in the human experience, Scottish Idealists welcomed the growth of the natural sciences, especially biology as a source of new material for continual evolutionary development of human understanding. Thomas Brown’s philosophy of the mind was reminiscent of on Hume’s empirical phenomenology and did not make any reference to Thomas Reid’s principles of common sense. Brown was speculated to be critical of Reid, although it was also hinted that the target of his criticisms was directed at Steward. The influence of the German philosophical movement was brought into the Scottish philosophical tradition by Sir William Hamilton who combined Reid's common-sense philosophy with logic and Kant's philosophy. His essays on a review of Victor Cousin’s lectures and “The Philosophy of Perception” brought attention among the community to Kant and post-Kantian philosophy. Scottish philosophy began to acquire a self-conscious identity, which according to James McCosh (1811-94), now consists of two opposing strands: the first is the materialism of Bain, and second the Hegelianism of Caird. McCosh's knowledge of the Scottish philosophical tradition came from his studies at the University of Glasgow, and later at the University of Edinburgh where he attended Hamilton's lectures as a divinity student. McCosh defined the heart of Scottish philosophy as the combination of observational methods of inquiry combined with moral and religious formation. From McCosh's perspective, the increasing popularity of Scottish philosophical school was a step in a different direction from the original methods and moral and religious standpoints. While the materialism of Bain retained the original observational methods, it abandoned moral formation. Additionally, the Idealism of Caird abandoned religious formation. This, to McCosh, signaled the demise of the Scottish philosophical tradition. McCosh was hopeful that the rise of cultural and intellectual independence of the United States would provide a fertile ground for the birth of a new American philosophy that would preserve the best of Scottish philosophical tradition.  20th Century  By the 20th Century, the identity of Scottish philosophy became to decline and the distinction between Scottish English philosophy began to be impractical. This is due to the increase in communication and movement between Scotland and England due to advances in transport. Traveling between Edinburgh and London could be accomplished in ten and a half hours via the Flying Scotsman, an express train service. This same journey would have taken two weeks in 1753 when a stagecoach service first operated. Traditionally, the continuation of Scottish philosophy relied on the teachers being succeeded by their students. The second half of the nineteenth century broke this relation as Scottish-educated philosophers left for England. Eventually, the changing social, political and economic conditions resulted in reforms that revitalized the university curriculum. Scottish philosophy came to be one subject among many.

It is partnered with the Michael J. Fox Foundation (MJFF) to achieve the foundations primary aims of “promoting and funding Parkinson’s disease research in Australia to slow, stop and cure the disease”. Together MJFF and SIUAF are the largest non- government funders of Parkinson's research across multiple institutes in Australia. Since its founding, the foundation has co-founded 38 Parkinson's research projects across 12 institutes to the value of over $10.8 million. The foundation's funding model ensures that 100% of proceeds goes towards Parkinson's research in Australia. This is possible due to the founding directors covering all overhead costs and expenses. In January 2019, Shake It Up are one of the partner organisation in the Australian Parkinson's Mission which was awarded a $30 million-dollar grant to test repurposed drugs in clinical trials.  Parkinson's disease  Parkinson's disease is a common neurological disease affecting 10 million people worldwide, with 38 Australian's being diagnosed each day. The disease is characterised by the loss of dopamine producing cells accompanied with chronic inflammation within the brain. It is caused by the loss of cells in various areas of the brain, significantly within the substantia nigia. Patients with Parkinson's, the loss dopamine producing neurons cause high levels of neuroinflamation to occur, mostly affecting the substantia nigra. When dopamine levels are depleted, the motor system nerves are unable to control movement and coordination. Over time, the dopamine producing cells are lost and motor type symptoms occur. People live with Parkinson's for a substantial amount of time before diagnosis when 80% of the dopamine producing cells are already lost. Currently there is no definitive test to diagnose Parkinson's but current clinical trials are showing promising results into ways to identify biomarkers that will detect the disease by a simple blood test at an earlier stage. = Signs and symptoms = The most recognisable symptoms are \\"motor related\\" however non-motor symptoms can consist of autonomic dysfunction, sleep difficulties, sensory such as altered sense of smell and neuropsychiatric problems (mood, cognition, behaviour or thought alterations). Four motor symptoms are considered the primary sign by which a diagnosis for Parkinson's is made upon; Tremor, Slowness of movement (bradykinesia), postural instability and rigidity. The most common presenting symptoms of Parkinson's within patients is a slow coarse tremor which disappears during voluntary movement and in the deeper stages of sleep. It typically appears in one hand and affects both hands are the disease progresses.  About Clyde  Clyde Campbell with wife Carolyn and three kids Josh (20), Zoe (18) and Phoebe (14) Originally, from Northern New South Wales, Clyde lives in Northern Sydney with wife Carolyn and three kids Josh (20), Zoe (18) and Phoebe (14). Starting out Clyde was an electrical apprentice in NSW, which lead to him forming his own company in 1987, Machinery Automation and Robotics. This company grew to 70 staff which servicing Australian and International clients with high tech automation and robotic solutions. He had a vision for technology as a solution for problems and had a goal of making a difference to individual's lives. Clyde in 2009, was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease after noticing a tremor in his left hand when holding notes at a company meeting. Clyde's faced the hardship of coming to terms with having an incurable disease that deteriorates progressively over time. After coming to terms with his prognosis, Clyde set out to learn as much about Parkinson's disease and what was being done in the worldwide effort to find a cure. This ensured his goal of finding a cure for Parkinson's. He found that despite the multitude of foundations supporting Parkinson's research and Australia having some of the World's leading scientist's specialising in Parkinson's research, they required financial assistance to accelerate the research on a global scale. This launched the Shake It Up Australia Foundation to increase awareness in Australia and increase funding to Australian institutions to find a cure. His vision in establishing the foundation was to “create an opportunity for everyone in Australia to make a difference”.  Funding model  Shake it Up's funding model revolves around 100% of proceeds going towards funding research to cure Parkinson's disease, with the founders Clyde and Greg Campbell covering all overhead cost and expenses of the foundation. It was a decision made by the awareness of the limited resources available in a competitive market and the need for funds allocated to non-for-profit and social sector to be managed efficiently to accelerate the path to a cure. It has funded over $10.8 million into Australian institutions for research. = Government funding = In January 2019, the NSW federal government awarded a $36.8 million-dollar grant for Parkinson's medical research through the Australian Parkinson's Mission and Parkinson's nurses to help improve the lives of those diagnosed and find a way to slow, stop and cure the debilitating disease. This was achieved by the Australian Parkinson's Mission initiative, an international collaboration developed by the Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Shake It Up Australia Foundation, Parkinson's Australia, The Cure Parkinson's Trust and The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research. It is an innovative research project combining clinical trials with genomics research for people with Parkinson's. 30 million dollars of the grant will be used to test repurposed drugs in a world's first in a Parkinson's clinical trial design by the Australian Parkinson's Mission, to identify effective safe treatments and fast track them to patients. Associate Professor Antony Cooper of the Garvan Institute of Medical Research will lead the research program. The mission will sequence the genome of each patient, to identify the unknown causes, discover biomarkers and determine whether there are Parkinsons's subtypes that can be targeted with specific drugs. Head of the Neurodegeneration and Neurogenomics Program at the Garvan Institute, said that the mission would be the \\"first step towards personalised medicine for Parkinson's patients\\" and further drug discovery. Its first clinical trial will assign 300 patients to randomly receive medication for existing conditions. The further 6.8 was given to Primary Health Networks over the next four years from 2019, to ease access to specialist nurses in the community for people with movement disorders including Parkinson's disease.  Partnership with The Michael J. Fox Foundation  Michael J. Fox (Diagnosed with Parkinson's at age 29, in 1991) Clyde's goal of finding a cure for Parkinson's led him to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research in the USA and the work they do to fund medical research targeted at finding better treatments, and a cure. In 2011, the Shake It Up Australia Foundation established a collaboration with the Michael J. Fox Foundation. This leveraged MJFF's Parkinson's drug development to Australia. The Michael J. Fox Foundation was founded in 2000 by actor Michael J Fox, funding more than $800 million in research to date. MJFF approach of assessing, funding and project managing research globally eliminates redundancy, ensures efficiency and unites the global community to find a cure. This collaboration builds a strong foundation for promising research. The partnership allows the Shake it Up Foundation to be internationally competitive and strategically managed. It allows both parties to maximise capital raised from the Australian Parkinson's community to accelerate better research and treatments to slow, stop and cure the disease.  Research projects  SIUAF and MJFF fund strategic, non-redundant and internationally competitive research projects. They have funded 38 research projects, within 12 different institutions since starting out in 2011. All research projects are assessed and validated by a panel of expert scientists at the Michael J. Fox Foundation to eliminate redundancy globally. Once the projects are approved, they are monitored and benchmarked by a team of PhD's and business trained project managers. Listed below are research projects that have been funded or are currently being funded by the Shake It Up Australia Foundation which have shown positive outcomes to slow, stop and cure Parkinson's disease: Professor Andrew Hill and Lesley Chang at La Trobe University = Biomarker's research at La Trobe University = Shake it Up committed funding to Professor Andrew Hill and Dr Lesley Cheng at La Trobe University to test the power of extracellular vesicles or cell particles, to detect Parkinson's via a simple blood test. The biological clue the test is looking for relates to the bloods 'appetite' for blood, as patient's with Parkinson's disease have white blood cells which consumes oxygen four times faster than normal cells. They are assessing whether this biomarker can be collected to determine a patient's neurological status. Researchers used blood samples from The Australian Parkinson's Disease Registry to determine whether biomarkers could be detected in both early onset and advanced patients who have taken medication for upwards of 5 years. Human trials of this test, which picks up on a key biological biomarker found in the blood of Parkinson's patients, delivered a 95% accuracy rate. La Trobe's development of the world's-first diagnostic blood test is labelled by Parkinson's patients and scientists as a “medical breakthrough” in the SMH. Professor Fisher stated that the test's early diagnosis and treatment abilities will provide “better outcomes and a greater quality of life for people with the condition”. A definitive diagnostic test will enable early intervention, limiting the number of brain cells and dopamine levels lost before one's diagnosis. La Trobe's research team estimates that the diagnostic blood test could be available within the next five years if additional funding is provided to speed up the development of the trial. = Inflammation study at the University of Queensland = The NLRP3 inflammasome (green) is expressed by immune cells (red) in the brains of people with Parkinson's disease. The inflammasome study conducted at the University of Queensland produced a promising new therapy to stop Parkinson's disease progressing through counteracting brain inflammation caused by immune cells. The study primarily targeting ways to counteract immune cells, specifically the microglia called NLRP3 inflammasome which is highly activated in patients with Parkinson's disease. The NLRP3 inflammasome reacts to synuclein containing protein clumps by increasing inflammatory signals which contributes to the depletion of dopamine producing cells within the brain. Whilst, recruiting more pathological proteins to create an intense cycle of neuroinflammation and a synuclein buildup within the brain. The study found that a small molecule MCC950 administered orally once a day, stopped the development of Parkinson's disease in several animal models. It was found to block NLRP3 activation within the brain and prevent both the loss of dopamine producing brain cells and neuroinflammation, resulting in significantly improved motor function - the leading symptom of parkinson's disease. UQ Bioscience researcher Professor Matt Cooper stated that the “MCC950 molecule effectively ‘cooled the brains on fire’, turning down microglial inflammatory activity, and allowing neurons to function normally.” Currently, there are no medications on the market that prevent brain cell loss in Parkinson's patients. Current therapies focus on managing symptoms rather than halting the progression of the degenerative disease. The promising results from this study validate a promising new target for Parkinson's researcher's and therapeutics to substantiate a potential drug to stop the progression of Parkinson's disease. The drug is now being commercialised for clinical trials by inflamzone, a pioneering biotech company that develops several small molecule drugs that inhibit harmful inflammation within the brain. With the success and extensive research studies taken place to ensure the drug is safe, tolerable and efficacious, human trials of the drug is now attainable. Phase 1 of the clinical trials on healthy volunteers is expected to start in 2019, with phase 2 trials on Parkinson's patient's predicted to take place in 2020 dependent on the results of Phase 1.

It is used by DragonFly BSD in its vkernel implementation since DragonFly 1.7, having been first revealed in , and first released in the stable branch with DragonFly 1.8 in . The long-term goal, in addition to easing kernel development, is to make it easier to support internet-connected computer clusters without compromising local security. Similar concepts exist in other operating systems as well; in Linux, a similar virtualisation concept is known as user-mode Linux; whereas in NetBSD since the summer of 2007, it has been the initial focus of the rump kernel infrastructure. The virtual kernel concept is nearly the exact opposite of the unikernel concept — with vkernel, kernel components get to run in userspace to ease kernel development and debugging, supported by a regular operating system kernel; whereas with a unikernel, userspace-level components get to run directly in kernel space for extra performance, supported by baremetal hardware or a hardware virtualisation stack. However, both vkernels and unikernels can be used for similar tasks as well, for example, to self-contain software to a virtualised environment with low overhead. In fact, NetBSD's rump kernel, originally having a focus of running kernel components in userspace, has since shifted into the unikernel space as well (going after the anykernel moniker for supporting both paradigms). The vkernel concept is different from FreeBSD jail in that jail is only meant for resource isolation, and cannot be used to develop and test new kernel functionality in the userland, because each jail is sharing the same kernel. (DragonFly, however, still has FreeBSD jail support as well.) In DragonFly, the vkernel can be thought of as a first-class computer architecture, comparable to i386 or amd64, and, according to Matthew Dillon circa 2007, can be used as a starting point for porting DragonFly BSD to new architectures. DragonFly's vkernel is supported by the host kernel through new system calls that help manage virtual memory address space (vmspace) — \`vmspace_create()\` et al., as well as extensions to several existing system calls like \`mmap\`'s \`madvise\` — \`mcontrol\`.

During his reign he made at least three campaigns against Persia in the service of the Ottomans. He was overthrown by the Ottoman Empire for refusing another campaign. He was on of the numerous sons of Devlet I Giray. Five of his brothers were later Khans. He was called Semiz or 'the fat'. Because of his weight he avoided riding horseback and preferred to travel in a wagon drawn by six or eight horses. His use of a wagon contributed to his death. When he came to the throne he had no living uncles and six living brothers: Adil, Alp, Gazi, Fetkh, Mubarak and Selyamet. Saadet II Giray was his son. His many brothers, each of whom was a potential khan, caused trouble during his reign and after. Early Life He was the son of khan Devlet I Giray (1551–1577). After the death of his elder brother Akhmed in 1555 he held the rank of Kalga or deputy khan and designated successor until his father’s death. For his early campaigns against Russia see under Devlet. In 1555 he rescued his father at Subishchi. In the 1560s it is said that he fought in Hungary in the Turkish service.Gaivoronsky, page 300 is vague here and this is hard to check in other sources. Toward the end of his father’s life relations between Mehmed and his younger brother Adil grew strained. Adil moved to the steppe, built the town of Bola-Serai on the Kalmius River and gathered Nogai supporters. Just before his death Devlet was able to reconcile his surviving elder sons. Reign Devlet died on 29 June 1577 and was followed by his 45-year-old son. Since he was the eldest son and Kalga and since Devlet had no living brothers, Mehmed's accession was not a problem. Adil became Mehmed’s Kalga. In 1577 he raided Vohynia In Polish territory until the Polish king paid a ransom. The Crimeans and Nogais returned with 35,000 captives, 40,000 horses and 500,000 cattle and sheep in addition to the ransom. (?From Russian Wikipedia citing no source. It is briefly mentioned by Howorth citing Karamzin. Omitted by Gaivoronsky.) 1578 First Persia: In the summer of 1578 sultan Murad III ordered the Crimeans to fight the Persians near the southwest corner of the Caspian Sea. (See Ottoman–Safavid War (1578–90)) In 1551 his predecessor, Sahib I Giray, was overthrown by the Turks for refusing a similar order. Mehmed claimed illness and declined. Instead he sent 20000 men under his brothers Adil, Mubarak and Gazi. Mehmed may have intended to get Adil out of the way. He also sent his son Saadet and then called him back. After a 3-month march along the north side of the Caucasus and down the Caspian coast in November they reached Shirvan (approximately modern Azjerbaijan) and joined Özdemiroğlu Osman Pasha. They completely defeated 25000 Persians under Shirvan Beylerbey Aras Khan Rumlu who were besieging Shamakhi. They moved south to the Mugan plain where they defeated the Rumlu tribe of Qazilbash nomads. An Iranian army arrived and on 28 November they were completely defeated at Mollakhasan. All their booty was captured as was Adil Geray. (The battle was fought in heavy rain which made their horses slip and weakened their bows. Adil was unhorsed by a spear and saved his life by identifying himself as a valuable captive.) Adil was executed in July 1579 during the next campaign, partly as a result of a palace intrigue involving the Shah's wife. Thus their first campaign was a complete failure. 1579 Second Persia: In the summer of 1579 Mehmed led 100000 men against Persia. They met Osman Pasha at Derbent, Gazi Giray defeated the Iranians at Baku and the Tatars occupied all of Shirvan. They spread out taking loot and captives. Iranian troops were defeated and their commander, Mukhammed-Khalif, was killed. Mehmed claimed that he was avenging his murdered brother Adil. In fall they returned to Crimea taking a huge amount of loot and thousands of captives to sell into slavery. Gazi Giray remained with a small detachment. The Sultan was not happy with their withdrawal. After they left Shirvan was reoccupied by the Kazilbashi. Conflict with Alp Giray: After the death of Adil Giray Mehmed appointed his son Saadet as Kalga. Mehmed’s brother Alp Giray thought that he should be Kalga. He was supported by several major beys and at least one of Mehmed’s sons. Mehmed ordered Alp to lead an army against Persia, Alp refused and Mehmed planned to kill him. Alp and Selyamet fled to the steppe and were captured by the Cossacks. Mehmed sent ambassadors offering 70,000 gold coins for their return. The ambassadors had orders to kill them once they were away from the Cossacks. Instead the Russian Wikipedia has the Poles send them to Istanbul where they gained Turkish support. No source cited, but the surrounding footnotes imply the first or 2007 edition of Gaivoronsky. Gaivoronsky, 2010 edition, says that they were planning to go to Turkey when they were captured. Ali-Bey of the Shirins supported Alp and Mehmed was forced to bring Alp back and make him Kalga. Saadet was given the new rank of Nureddin or second successor after the Kalga. The Kalga Alp held the eastern part of the peninsula dominated by the Shirin clan while the Nureddin Saadet held the western steppe-like part dominated by the Mansur clan and linked to the Nogais. This balancing of power was a potential source of conflict. 1580 Third Persia: (? The third and fourth Persian campaigns are omitted by Gaivoronsky and Howorth. They are found in the Russian Wikipedia citing something called 'Vsemirnaya Istoria', volume 13. Gaivoronsky has a gap for these years, so he may have skipped something. It is possible that troops remained in Persia so that these were not separate campaigns. ) In 1580 a Crimean army under Gazi and Safa Geray again invaded Shirvan and defeated a Kazilbash army under Salman Khan, beylerbey of Shirvan. They helped Osman Pasha move from Derbent to capture Baku. They fought the main kazilbash army at Mallakhasan and withdrew to Dagestan. When a large Iranian army approached Osman Pasha pulled back to Derbent. 1581 Fourth Persia: In the spring of 1581 the Crimeans under Gazi and Safa Geray again invaded Shirvan. Between the towns of Shemakhi and Şabran they were defeated by an Iranian army under Peyker Khan, the beylerbey of Shirvan. Gazi Geray was captured. 1582–1584 Overthrow: In the summer of 1582 Turkish troops arrived at Kaffa with orders for the Crimeans to join them on another campaign against Persia. Mehmed called a council of his nobles and it was decided to refuse the command. The Turks marched to Persia without them. It is not clear why Mehmed risked this dangerous insult to his overlord. At the end of 1583 Osman Pasha arrived at Kaffa after an autumn march from Shirvan. He had secret orders to arrest Mehmed and take him to Istanbul. Mehmed invited him to talks at Stary Krym, and when Osman refused Mehmed's suspicions were confirmed. He collected 40,000 troops and besieged Kaffa. Neither side dared to attack the other. Alp Giray secretly left the khan's camp, went to Osman and had Osman propose him as the new khan, something that he had no legal power to do. Most of the beys remained loyal but the Mufti of Kaffa supported the Turks. In May 1584 a Turkish fleet arrived at Kaffa. On board was Mehmed's brother Islyam Giray with a document from the sultan declaring him the new khan. Most of the nobles went over to Islyam. Mehmed, his sons Saadet, Murad and Safa and the Mansur Beg fled toward the steppe. Alp, Selyamet and Mubarak went after him. Near Perekop Alp caught up with Mehmed's wagon and strangled him. He was buried at Bakhchiserai.Mehmed II Giray, Saadet II Giray and Mehmed III Giray, grandfather, father and son, were all driven from the throne, all killed outside Crimea and all buried at the Aziz Malik-Ashter mausoleum in Crimea. This was the year that Ivan the Terrible died. Islyam II Giray (1584–1588) became khan. Islyam was supported by his brothers and opposed by Mehmed's sons. His sons When Mehmed died his sons – Saadet, Safa and Murad – fled to the steppe. They were accompanied by some of the Mansur clan who lived in the northwestern, steppe-like part of Crimea. Saadet: Three months later, Saadet and his brothers led 15000 Nogais south, seeking to avenge their father. They took the capital and Saadet declared himself khan as Saadet II Giray. Islyam fled to the Turks at Kaffa where he was besieged. After three months 4000 Turks arrived with artillery and drove Saadet back to the steppe. In the spring of 1585 Saadet tried again but was defeated before he reached Crimea. For more see İslâm II Giray. The three brothers were now in danger since any bold chieftain might seize them and sell them to Islyam. Saadet fled east to Chopan, the Shamkhal of the Kumyks on the Caspian Sea. Chopan probably wanted a bargaining chip to protect his independence, since in the last reign Turkish and Crimean troops had several times marched through his lands to attack the Persians. The Shah of Persia was happy with Saadet’s arrival and sent him a decorated saber which he suggested be used against the Turks. See Ottoman–Safavid War (1578–90). The Russians invited him from Kumykia to Astrakhan, perhaps to join his brother Murad. It was learned in Crimea that a certain Khoja-bey had left Istanbul, bypassed Crimea and landed at Azov with messages for Saadet and Murad. We do not know what was said, but in the autumn of 1587 Saadet was found dead at Astrakhan. It is thought that the Russians had him murdered, fearing that he might go over to the Turks. The whole business remains mysterious. Safa: During Saadet’s revolt Safa was his kalga. After Saadet’s second defeat, Safa went to Circassia. In the autumn of 1586 he joined Saadet in Kumykia. In October 1586 the Russians invited Safa and Saadet to join their brother Murad at Astrakhan. Saadet went, but Safa refused. In 1587 he was in Circassia or with the Little Nogai Horde to the north. In the spring of 1588 Khan Islyam died and was replaced by Gazi II. In May 1588 Safa returned to Crimea and became Gazi’s Nureddin. In June he met the Russian ambassador concerning Murad. In 1591 he participated in Gazi’s attack on Russia. Returning from the campaign he fell ill and died in Crimea. Murad chose a stronger protector and went to the Russians at Astrakhan. The Russians hoped to use him as a puppet khan just as they had done at Kazan. Murad went to Moscow in the spring of 1586, was shown great honor and returned to Astrakhan in September. He affected royal airs and called himself \\"Lord of the Four Rivers\\" (Don, Volga, Ural and Terek), but was closely watched by the Russians. He was told to unite the Nogais, Kabardians and Kumyks against Crimea and Turkey. Urus Bey of the Nogais submitted very reluctantly and sent a complaint to the sultan. In the spring of 1587 Islyam heard that the czar had sent Murad 30000 streltsi and Cossacks in preparation for an attack on Crimea at the end of the year. In response, Alp and Selyamet made a raid on the Oka. The Russians claimed success, but the raid reduced their support for Murad. The Russians pretended that they had sent the men to fight the Poles, not the Crimeans. Unhappy with Murad’s demands, Urus-Bey sent an ambassador to the sultan offering to become a Turkish subject and receive a Turkish governor, asking for Adil Giray’s fort of Bola-Serai to replace Saraichik which the Volga Cossacks had destroyed and proposed a new Turkish campaign to liberate Astrakhan. Some time before the Sultan had received a proposal from Bukhara for a joint attack on Astrakhan to open up communications north of the Caspian. Both were at war with Persia. The vizier Piyale-Pasha visited both Bukhara and the Nogais and reported that the capture of Astrakhan was feasible. The sultan ordered Urus and Islyam to prepare for a Volga campaign in the spring of 1588. Islyam would be in charge. Piyale-Pasha began filling Kaffa with food and equipment. (When Islyam died in 1588 the campaign was cancelled, the Turkish troops were sent to the Persian front and the galleys returned to the Mediterranean.) In the winter if 1586/87 Murad went to the Kumyks to marry the Shamkhal’s daughter and bring him into the Russian orbit, while Saadet moved from Kumykia to Astrakhan. In early 1587 he returned to Astrakhan without a wife. That autumn Saadet died and Murad married his widow. In 1588 Khan Islyam died and was replaced by Gazi II. In late 1588 Gazi sent ambassadors to Moscow asking that Murad be released. The Russians said that he was free to go. He went to Moscow in February 1589 and again in the summer of 1590.

In 1591 Murad decided to return to Crimea without the Czar’s permission. The Russians made no attempt to stop him, but on the eve of his departure he was found dead along with Kumyk, son of his brother Saadet. The Russians blamed his death on Tatar “sorcerers\\" and had them burnt at the stake. His wife, Es-Tourgan, whose previous husband Saadet had died under similar circumstances, wrote to Crimea saying that her husband and stepson had been poisoned. Later, as part of a peace deal on the eve of the Hungarian war, Es-Tourgan was allowed to go to Crimea along with Saadet’s sons Devlet, Mehmed and Sahin.

It is scheduled to be released on July 10, 2020, by Elevation Pictures. Plot Similar to many of Egoyan's other films, Guest of Honour features a narrative structure that alternates between the past and present. In the present day, Veronica meets with a priest, Father Greg, in his church to discuss funeral arrangements for her recently deceased father, Jim. Their conversation reveals details of Jim and Veronica's lives which are shown through a series of flashbacks. Father Greg expresses some confusion as to why Jim wished to have his funeral at this particular church given that Jim was not a member of the congregation. He agrees to allow the funeral to take place at his church, but he first asks Veronica to share more information about Jim's life so that he is prepared to give a eulogy at the funeral. Veronica emphasizes Jim's commitment to his work as a food inspector and his ability to care for the family's pet rabbit, Benjamin, who died at the improbable age of 16. Prior to his death, Jim was a food safety inspector working for the City of Hamilton. He took his job very seriously, and his strict adherence to the health and safety code often led to clashes with restaurant owners, many of whom are immigrants who may not be familiar with Canadian food safety standards. Jim would also regularly visit Veronica in prison where she was previously serving a sentence for having had sexual relations with an underage teenage boy named Clive when she was a high school music teacher. However, Veronica did not actually commit this crime. To Jim's astonishment, Veronica inexplicably resists any attempt to secure her release from prison and she has no interest in speaking to her lawyer. She claims that she deserves to be in prison for what she did, hinting at something else she is guilty of in her past. A flashback reveals the details of an overnight school band trip that leads to Veronica's imprisonment. A bus driver and chaperone, Mike, becomes spiteful of Clive's romantic interest in Veronica and her rejection of his own advances. During one of the band's performances, Mike uses Veronica's cell phone to send a sexually suggestive text message to Clive. Clive later approaches Veronica to inform her of the text message. He acknowledges that the message could not have sent by her because they were performing at the time the message was sent, and their phones were left on the school bus, a rule enforced by Veronica herself. They both conclude the obvious fact that Mike was the one who sent the text message using Veronica's phone, but they decide to pull a prank on Mike rather than reporting the incident. Later that night at a motel, Veronica, Clive, and another male student spend time alone in a room and purposely make a lot of noise to trick Mike into thinking that they are partying and having sex. Clive signals for the other student to move to the adjoining room to leave him alone with Veronica. Veronica begins to have a flashback to the suicide of her teenage boyfriend, Walter, causing her to panic and storm out of the room in plain sight of Mike who then confronts her. Veronica explains to Father Greg that she entered a plea deal and asked for the longest sentence possible rather than allowing her case to proceed in court which would have allowed Clive and the other students to testify as witnesses and vindicate her. Father Greg is perplexed and asks Veronica why she would have been willing to go to jail for something she did not do. Veronica explains that she wanted to go to jail for something else she did in her past. A series of flashbacks reveal that Veronica began regularly taking music lessons at the private residence of a woman named Alicia when she was eight years old. Alicia is a single mother who also teaches music to her son, Walter, who is of a similar age to Veronica, and the two children would go on to regularly perform together at recitals. Around this time, Veronica's mother, Roseangela, became very ill and passed away soon afterwards. Towards the end of Roseangela's life, Jim and Alicia began developing a romantic relationship which was facilitated in large part by Veronica's music lessons. Veronica resented this relationship and the possibility of Alicia becoming her new mother. Veronica's perception of Jim and Alicia's relationship continues to cause tension and disagreement between her and her father during their meetings in prison. Veronica claims that she remembers seeing her father holding hands with Alicia while she was performing at a musical recital despite the fact that her mother was still alive and in attendance, a charge which Jim denies and tries to disprove while emphasizing that he could never love anyone as much as Roseangela. Veronica also claims to remember seeing Alicia follow her father upstairs to presumably have sex during her music lessons which had merely become a pretext for their blossoming relationship. While Jim and Alicia were upstairs doing something, Veronica would be left alone in the piano room to write music. During a music lesson with Veronica, Alicia experiences a migraine and retreats upstairs to lay down and smoke a cigarette. Veronica stays downstairs in the piano room to write a piece of music and then proceeds upstairs. As Veronica approaches a doorway, she sees Alicia asleep on a couch with a lit cigarette in her hand. Alicia's hand slips off the couch and lands on a stack of papers which catch fire. Veronica allows Alicia to burn to death in order to avoid the possibility of Alicia marrying Jim. Veronica and Walter later become romantically involved when they are teenagers. At some point in their relationship, Walter becomes aware of the circumstances regarding his mother's death. When Veronica breaks up with Walter, he becomes traumatized and then records a video using Veronica's cell phone blaming her for his mother's death and explaining his intention to commit suicide and join his mother in the underworld which Veronica sent her to, all while Veronica is sleeping. Veronica wakes up the next morning to find her cell phone on the nightstand with a sticky note affixed reading \\"watch later.\\" She then finds Walter dead in a bloody bathtub. The deaths of Alicia and Walter are the source of Veronica's guilt and her desire to go to jail, details which she admits to Father Greg. Her conversation with Father Greg eventually leads to some closure for her as she begins to come to terms with the true nature of her father's relationship with Alicia and the traumatic incidents which have occurred throughout her life, and she begins to re-frame her perception of them. Two flashbacks reveal that Veronica's recollection of what was going on between Alicia and her father was mostly correct, but severely distorted. Jim inspects an Armenian restaurant called Wild Orchid and discovers two major violations pertaining to their processing of rabbit meat in the kitchen. The restaurant owners convince Jim that the rabbit meat is for a private event and is not for sale during a regular dinner service, but he is skeptical and intends to come back to verify their claim. Later that week, Jim visits a popular German restaurant which is owned by Clive's family. He spreads some of Benjamin's feces, which he has altered to appear like rat droppings, on the bathroom floor. He threatens Clive's grandfather with a shutdown of the restaurant unless he is given an opportunity to speak privately with Clive who had been intentionally avoiding contact with Jim. During a tense conversation, Clive truthfully explains what happened during the school trip which led to Veronica's imprisonment, and he tells Jim that the bus driver was the one who sent the inappropriate text. He also tells Jim that he knows Veronica felt responsible for Walter's suicide. Later that night, Jim returns to Wild Orchid and discovers that there is in fact a special event taking place at the restaurant, and he is unexpectedly the family's guest of honour that evening. After drinking too much wine, he is invited to give a speech in which he expresses his anguish regarding Veronica's imprisonment despite the fact that she came from a loving home with parents who supported her and made sacrifices for her, to the bewilderment of the other guests who are not aware of Veronica's crime. He expresses his desire to kill the bus driver who was responsible, causing him to be reported to the police by the restaurant owners after they send him home in a taxi. While being interrogated by the police the next day, Jim notices that Benjamin, who was given to Veronica as a gift when she was nine, has suddenly died in his cage. Jim returns to Wild Orchid carrying Benjamin's dead body and demands that the restaurant owners cut off Benjamin's feet so that he can keep them as good luck charms. The mortified restaurant owners comply with the request in order to get Jim to leave. During their final prison visitation, Jim tells Veronica about what happened at the restaurant and the visitation from the police. He explains that the police are suspicious of his regular visits to the prison because he and Veronica may be plotting to murder Mike. He explains that he got carried away during his speech and that the police are just doing their job by investigating the threat. Veronica excitedly asks if this means her sentence will be extended even further, causing a bewildered Jim to ask her what is wrong with her. Veronica explains that Jim, everything he has done, and everything she saw and endured as a child, is what is wrong with her, but also what is right with her. At Jim's funeral, Father Greg tells a story about having met Jim briefly at the funeral of another parishioner, Alicia, and how Jim had told him about how important Alicia was to Veronica's musical education. Father Greg asks the parishioners in attendance to mourn the deaths of both Jim and Alicia. Veronica, now in possession of the good luck charms made from Benjamin's feet, asks Father Greg to place the charms in the casket with Jim's body after first keeping one for herself and gifting another to Father Greg. Father Greg places the remaining charms in Jim's hands and then closes the casket. The final scene is a flashback to when Veronica was a music teacher. During a recital, she introduces the final piece of music on the program by explaining that it is a tune she wrote during a difficult time in her life when she was a girl. It is one of the songs she wrote when she was left alone in the piano room at Alicia's home.

With the same name as Vladimir Nabokov's short story A Guide to Berlin, Jones' novel follows the main character, a young Australian woman named Cass, as she travels to Berlin and meets with five other travellers in the city. The six members form a literary group, all inspired at one point in their lives by Nabokov's life and works, and share their personal stories which they call speak-memories. Towards the end of the novel, a moment of violence within the group changes the direction and tone of the story.  Plot  The novel begins with one member of the literary group, Marco Gianelli, giving a short eulogy for the deceased, who remains without identity at this point. In the next chapter, it cuts to Cass’ third person point of view as she describes the scenery in wintry Berlin. Cass goes to her first literary meeting and the reader is introduced to the other five members, “Victor from New York, Marco and Gino from Rome, Yukio and Mitsuko from Tokyo”, and Cass from Sydney. The reader learns how Cass came to join this group; she met Marco as they both stood in front of Vladimir Nabokov's old dwelling, as they both took a photo of the building, and Marco came to invite her to the literary group. The meetings take place gradually over a few weeks, with each person sharing their own speak-memory. In between the meetings, Cass visits landmarks with different people, such as going to the Pergamon Museum with Marco, aquarium with Victor and the S-Bahn with Mitsuko. After every person's speak-memory, they agree to two weeks without a meeting, and then schedule the next one in Cass’ apartment. Gino is strained and tense and makes a speech about how they are all pretentious and snobbish. Victor comforts Gino and the two men move onto the apartment's balcony. The men become angry, although we are not told what is said, and in a single moment, Gino lifts Victor up and drops him over the balcony edge. A caretaker is called and Victor's body is driven to the edge of a river and sunk into the water. Gino commits suicide soon after.  Characters  = Victor = At the first meeting, Victor tells his speak- memory of how he was born in New Jersey and of his overprotective mother and his father who worked in an umbrella factory. He tells of how his father died early due to illness, and how Victor's parents were Polish survivors of the Holocaust. In particular, he speaks of the poverty he felt after his father died, the resentment his mother felt towards wealthier women in the neighborhood and how Victor used to chant “umbrella, umbrella” to cope with his nerves. = Mitsuko = At the second meeting, Mitsuko tells her speak- memory. She was born in Hagi, Yamaguchi Prefecture and her father was a potter. Mitsuko moved to Tokyo to try for a good university and follow her dream of becoming an English translator. She rebelled against her disciplinarian aunt and begun to dress in Lolita fashion. Although she entered university, Mitsuko left to become a rental sister, to help hikikomori come out of their rooms. During this job, she met Yukio, her boyfriend and lover, and they travelled to Berlin together. = Yukio = At the third meeting, Yukio tells his speak-memory. He speaks of how he was traumatized as a boy by the Tokyo subway gas attacks of 1995 in his city, how his older brother constantly taunted him and how he enjoyed playing chess with his grandfather. When Yukio was sixteen, he retreated into his room and his “double-click world”. After four years of his hikikomori life, Mitsuko came as a rental sister to Yukio's house and began to talk to him through the door. After many weeks, Yukio finally left his room and began meeting Mitsuko. = Gino = At the fourth meeting, Gino tells his speak-memory, the last one told in the Oblomov apartment. His father died aged thirty-seven, the sane day when Gino himself was born, from injuries received from the bombing of the Bologna Centrale train station. His mother carried a pained atmosphere with her, raising Gino and his four elder sisters by herself. Gino's father had been an accountant but also with literary aspirations, hence how Gino came to be interested in Nabokov's work. After Gino's speak-memory, Marco mentions that there are thousands of unexploded bombs beneath Berlin, and all six people imagine what Berlin would look like if exploded. = Marco = At the fifth meeting, Marco tells his speak-memory. He was born on the same day of the year as Nabokov and Shakespeare and blamed his epilepsy as the reason his father left their family. Despite his efforts to find him, Marco never could. His uncle in Australia paid for his education and Marco discovered the power of reading quietly while at university. After Marco's story, Victor jokes that these meetings are therapy sessions, leading to tensions between him and Gino, who becomes aggressive in response. = Cass = Finally Cass presents her own speak-memory, telling of how she grew up in Broome in a house which had once been a quarantine station, how she used to fight with her three older brothers and how she was sent to boarding school as a child. Cass went to London to study art, then to Sydney to study literature. It is only after her speak- memory, when Marco and Cass are alone together, that Cass reveals her brother Alexander died during a cyclone when she was twelve.  Reception  A Guide to Berlin has received mixed reviews. Independent praised Jones' novel and stated that, although the story was slightly heavy, her ability to write reflectively was one of her strengths..The Guardian said that although the novel looked promising, it was disappointing and did not live up to Nabokov's writing standards. The Sydney Morning Herald observed that Jones included many Nabokovian elements in her novel, such as one character having the same birthday as the Russian author The book has an average rating of 3.43 stars out of 5 on Goodreads.

The unique mix of cultural and artistic influences throughout history have led to Cuba being renowned for its eclectic and diverse architecture, which can be defined as a unique fusion of numerous well-studied architectural styles from around the world. After being circumnavigated by navigator Sebastian de Ocampo in 1508, Cuba was settled by the Spanish in 1511. Being ruled by Spain for more than 400 years following this, Cuban architecture is therefore deeply reflective of this colonial period. Various historical events throughout this time, such as trade liberalisation due to major trade reforms in 1778 and 1791 as well as an increase in immigration, contributed to further structural and artistic influences. This includes the seamless fusion of both Neoclassical and Baroque architectural styles into Cuban design. Following the colonial period, Cuba continued to see diverse architectural pursuits into the 20th century. This was mainly due to increased funding into architectural projects because of national prosperity from high sugar exports during World War I. The Art Deco period is also a notable reference point for Cuban architecture prior to the turn of the century. In modern times, Cuban architecture is continually celebrated by historians and tourists alike. Contemporary issues such as privatisation and how architecture itself is viewed as a profession in Latin America are both relevant topics when considering the future of Cuban architecture.  Early history palm tree hut made by Native Indians in Cuba, showcasing the early history of Cuban architecture.right Prior to Christopher Columbus landing in Cuba in 1492, the island was inhabited by Ciboney Indians and Arawak Indians who had migrated around the Caribbean. Thus, early architecture in Cuba was rudimentary and based on the culture and lifestyle of these hunter-gatherer groups. Groups during this Indigenous migration were non-hierarchal and focused on agriculture, and lived in three main types of makeshift housing. This included Caney shelters, Barbacoa (the first Pilotis) and Bohío huts, all constructed from palm trees and leaves. The first official settlement in Cuba was not until 1511, led by governor Don Diego Velazquez, and as such, there are limited architectural remains in Cuba from before the Colonial Period. Furthermore, the use of palm leaves as a principal material means rudimentary architectural pursuits were quickly replaced by more permanent construction led by Spanish settlers.  Colonial period (1511–1898) Colonial architecture in Cuba refers to the buildings and structures that were created during Spanish colonisation. As Cuba was minimally impacted by the destruction of World War I and World War II, these structures remain relatively intact. The key trends of this era include military structures and fortifications, as well as Neoclassicism influenced by European trends. The preservation of key colonial structures has also been facilitated by the nomination of Old Havana, known locally as Habana Vieja, as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982. Old Havana refers to the southwest coast of Cuba, where Havana was originally founded in the 16th century by Panfilo de Narvaez, a Spanish conquistador. According to UNESCO, Havana is \\"the most impressive historical city centre in the Caribbean and one of the most notable in the American continent as a whole.\\" Old Havana is therefore a region abundant with historical architecture from this period, including both military Fortifications and Spanish colonial works. = Military architecture= The left The Colonial Period was characterised by volatility, meaning military architecture from this period is notable. Military architecture can be defined as the complex structures and Fortifications designed to protect a region during unwanted attacks. Italian engineer Battista Antonelli was the first to introduce this style of Renaissance military structures to Cuba, which he designed and built just prior to the beginning of the 17th Century. Antonelli's work included the Castillo de Ios Tres Reyes del Morrow and the Castillo San Salvador de la Punta, both located in Havana. These structures were also both recognised by UNESCO as World Heritage listed fortifications in 1982. La Cabaña fort in Havana is another key example of military architecture, driven by elements of French design and therefore a reflection of the Franco-Spanish alliance that impacted Colonial Cuba. Taking over 10 years to build and covering 10 hectares of land, this fortification is the largest Spanish military structure in both North and South America. = Baroque= The right Baroque architecture began to influence Cuban projects in the mid 1700s, approximately 50 years after its initial introduction as an architectural style in Italy. While traditional baroque is defined by grandeur, intricate embellishments and royal palaces, the Cuban style was adapted to include recognisable 'tropical' features. Baroque projects in Cuba are also considered to be a simplified version of European Baroque due to a lack of skilled craftsmen in the country. Contrary to Europe, African slaves were responsible for constructing the majority of architectural projects in Cuba throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. This modified style of Baroque architecture in Cuba, known as Spanish Baroque, includes an array of characteristic traits. For example, rejas were metal bars on windows that enabled improved air circulation, which was evidently a unique geographic requirement for the Cuban landscape. Similarly, sheltered walkways were added to traditional grand Baroque exteriors, known as portales, in order to provide protection from the Cuban sun and rain. One of the most prominent Baroque designs in Cuba is the Cathedral of Havana, constructed from 1748 until 1777. The Cathedral was influenced by Francesco Borromini, who was one of the most celebrated architects of the Roman Baroque era. = Neoclassicism= The symmetrical and proportional right Due to an increase of French immigrants to Cuba in the 19th Century, Cuban architecture also became highly influenced by neoclassicism, which was reflective of architectural projects taking place in France. The city of Cienfuegos, located on the south coast, was greatly impacted by these trends, and is considered one of the most neoclassical cities in Cuba. The city was founded by French immigrants in 1819, and features neoclassical styles such as elegant facades and pastel colouring. In the nation's capital of Havana, notable neoclassical buildings include the El Template and the Hotel Inglaterra. The buildings of Vedado, a district in Havana established in 1859, also reflect the popularity of neoclassicism in Cuba during this period. This is demonstrated by the 'balanced proportions' of all structures in the district, which is a recognisable characteristic of Neoclassical design. Neoclassical architectural features such as symmetry also began appearing by the mid-19th century throughout other Cuban cities, such as Trinidad and Camagüey. Neoclassicism also became popular in urban design and residential projects during this period. Many homes in and around Old Havana followed traditional Cuban design principles, but were complemented by subtle neoclassical ironwork and columns. By the late 19th-century, homes in the neighbourhoods of Cerro and El Vedado had become heavily influenced by neoclassical design, featuring modern structures and spacious gardens.  20th century  The Architecture of Cuba throughout the 20th Century took influence from visiting architects from around the world, and is therefore characterised by international artistic trends such as the Art Nouveau and Art Deco styles. Political and Social changes also led to an increase in public works, and thus civil architecture from this period is notable. Cuba also saw a building boom post-revolution due to an influx of wealth, with architectural choices that reflect the values held by Cuban society at the time. = Art Nouveau and Art Deco= left In an attempt to keep up with fast developing cultural styles abroad, Cuba was quick to follow the trend of Art Nouveau and Art Deco architecture at the beginning of the 20th Century. Art Nouveau, which translates from French as 'new' art, was an ornamental style of architecture that become immensely popular in Europe at the Turn of the century. The style was first introduced in Cuba due to the 1905 Paris Exhibition. Art Deco inspiration was soon to follow, becoming a stylistic choice for both public and residential designs by private Architects in Cuba, particularly in the 1930s. A key example of this is The Bacardi Building, located in Havana, which is celebrated as an iconic building that draws inspiration from the Art Deco period. The result of an architectural design competition, the building is characterised by its marble and red granite facade. The Bacardi Building was also the very first skyscraper to be built in the city of Havana. = Civil architecture= right After reaching independence in 1902, Cuba saw an immense building boom, with a particular focus on civil works. This was largely driven by an increase in population, with the number of residents in the capital of Havana doubling from 1900 to 1930, mostly due to new laws which facilitated higher rates of immigration. The Lonja del Comercio building was constructed in 1908 by architects Tomás Our and José Mata to be used as a commercial bank and stock exchange. The design, featuring a high Renaissance inspired facade, was a reflection of new architectural preferences at the beginning of the 20th Century. Similarly, the mid-20th century was also characterised by a tourism boom, which favoured the development of hotel architecture. Key examples include the Havana Riveria Hotel, built in 1957, and the Habana Hilton hotel. The Habana Hilton, now known as the Hotel Tryp Habana Libre, was designed by North American architect Welton Becket. = Post revolution (1959–1999)= Due to strict government regulation following the Cuban Revolution, the need for extensive planning and government approval significantly slowed architectural development. Furthermore, the United States embargo against Cuba which began in October 1960 meant that architectural projects often faced difficulties in terms of gaining resources and materials for construction, particularly in the first decade proceeding the embargo.  National arts schools The School of Ballet, by rightOne of the largest scale architectural projects of this early post revolution period was the National Arts Schools buildings in Havana. Designed by Cuban architect Ricardo Porro, and Italian architects Roberto Gottardi and Vittorio Garatti, shortages of traditional materials due to the US trade embargo lead to the decision to use primarily local brick and terracotta tiles. The ambitious design of the Art Schools is truly a reflection of the utopian socialist and idealistic optimism present in Cuba following the revolution. Composed of five unique buildings for each school of Art, the project commenced construction on 13 March 1961, aiming to organically intertwine natural Cuban landscapes with unique architectural techniques from around the world. One key focus was to employ the Catalan vault structure, a layered brickwork construction technique, drawing inspiration from the work of Antonin Gaudi in Spain. However, construction of the National Art Schools never reached completion. Work stopped in 1965 for various reasons, principally due to new national preferences in favour of Soviet-style architecture and the damaging economic impact of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Despite being incomplete, the Art Schools have since received significant recognition for their innovation and beauty as an architectural form. The National Council of Cultural Heritage prescribed the Schools as national Monuments in 2011.  21st century  = Contemporary architecture= Gran Hotel Manzana in 2012.left While the rich history of Cuban architecture is celebrated, contemporary architecture receives less coverage in Cuba. Some academics note that modern architecture does not play an important role in Cuban culture and that architecture is not necessarily viewed in contemporary times as a desirable profession. The journal Arquitectura de Cuba was relaunched in the 1960s, however, the publication lacks funding. There remains no other modern mass media sources, including both print and television, dedicated to the Architecture of Cuba at a national level. Cuban architects and historians suggest that the government decision to halt construction of the National Art Schools was the end of Cuba's architectural 'golden age.' However, although it does not play a large role in public discourse, contemporary architecture in Cuba does still exist. One recent project is the art space Factoria Habana, which was designed by Abiel San Miguel in 2009. The building was converted from an old industrial building, and features elements characteristic of modern architecture such as high ceilings, concrete floors and an open floor plan. Hotel buildings are also being increasingly reimagined, particularly as the Cuban government opens up to input from private sectors. The Gran Hotel Manzana in Havana is a key example of this, where renovations began in 2012 by French company Bouygues Bâtiment International on the original commercial building known as the Manzana de Gómez. Maintaining original Art Deco features, the hotel has now been redesigned to include contemporary elements and facilities, including a rooftop terrace and pool. Through such buildings, it is evident that contemporary architectural structures are beginning to integrate and coexist with historic Cuban structures and buildings. = Future= There have been several notable debates about the future direction of architecture in Cuba. Many contemporary architects argue that Cuban civil infrastructure, particularly in Havana, is outdated and therefore no longer providing for its citizens. Although a lot of architectural restoration work has been done and the city is nevertheless celebrated by tourists, Old Havana still has many buildings which are in a state of disrepair, poorly maintained or abandoned. Many of these current restoration projects are directed by the Office of the Historian of Havana. However, such restoration projects are typically only in favour of buildings which drive tourism. On a wider scale and aside from government funded restoration, the economy of Cuba remains weak. The Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was only US$12,300 in 2016; particularly low due to the oil crisis of Venezuela, a nation that is a crucial trading partner for Cuba. Therefore, without foreign investment, Joint ventures or the restructuring of the Cuban economy, the ability for lavish architectural projects in the future is limited.

Like U. koponeni, this species seems to mimic small caterpillars, likely those of lichen moths. The authors of the description hypothesize that U. carlei might normally live in tree canopies. Distribution U. carlei has been described from one male, which was collected in 2018 from a railing at the edge of Shek O Country Park, Hong Kong. Name The species is named after American illustrator Eric Carle of The Very Hungry Caterpillar fame, at the occasion of his 90th birthday, the 50th anniversary of his most famous book, and to honor his contribution to early childhood nature education. Description Like other species of this genus, U. carlei has unusually long spinnerets, and a flat and broadened carapace. The body of the male is about 3 mm long. The abdomen is unusually long, with a longitudinal serrate brown stripe, and densely covered with long erected hairs. The female (probably immature) is only known from pictures in the book A Guide to the Spiders of Hong Kong (2016) by Dickson Wong. Behavior U. carlei male displaying to mirror image The male moves rather slowly, with long rest phases. It rarely jumps, and might escape by falling down on a thread of several centimeters, then climbing back up. When encountering a mirror, it displays to its male mirror image.

The site is particularly notable due to both the large proportion of new taxa represented (approximately 53% of the specimens), and due to the large amount of soft-body tissue of the ancient specimens that was preserved, likely due to the organisms being rapidly covered in sediment prior to fossilization, that allowed for the detailed preservation of even fragile, soft-bodied creatures such as worms and jellyfish. The site is a Burgess Shale type preservation, and has been widely compared to the Burgess Shale in terms of the site's richness and significance.

Its nearest higher peak is Mount Athabasca, to the west. Parker Ridge is situated along the west side of the Icefields Parkway and southeast of Sunwapta Pass. Parker Ridge is a ski-touring destination in the winter and popular hiking destination in the summer because it is situated beside the Icefields Parkway allowing easy access, and is nearly entirely above treeline allowing good views of the surrounding mountain landscape. A trail gains of elevation from the highway to the top of the ridge. Wandering east or west along the ridge provides views of Cirrus Mountain, the north face of Mount Saskatchewan, Saskatchewan Glacier, Mount Athabasca, Hilda Peak, and Nigel Peak among others. History Parker Ridge was named for Elizabeth Parker (1856–1944), co-founder of the Alpine Club of Canada in 1906 along with Arthur Oliver Wheeler. The Elizabeth Parker hut near Lake O'Hara is also named in her honor. The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1978 by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Geology Like other mountains in Banff Park, Parker Ridge is composed of sedimentary rock laid down from the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. Climate Based on the Köppen climate classification, Parker Ridge is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below -20 °C with wind chill factors below -30 °C. Precipitation runoff from Parker Ridge drains into tributaries of the North Saskatchewan River.

Ultra106five is Hobart's only Christian radio station, and was one of the first of its kind in Australia. The station provides a mixed format of Christian, Easy Listening and Hot Adult Contemporary music.  About  Ultra106.5fm is Hobart's only Christian radio station. The station has been on the air since 1980, and was one of the first Christian radio stations to operate in Australia. The format of ultra106five is described as \\"Contemporary Christian Radio\\", which is Christian-infused mainstream light contemporary radio. The program format is designed to reach out to the wider community as well as the Christian community. This is achieved with \\"family friendly\\" and accessible music with a positive or relational message, whether performed by Christian or non- Christian artists and regardless of whether or not the music is intentionally carrying a Christian message. History Ultra106five began in the 1970s with a group of people who had a vision of a Christian radio station in Hobart. Neville and Joan Brown and a friend of theirs had the initial idea for a Christian radio station in Hobart immediately after a time of prayer. It was 1974, and Neville had just left his job as a supervising engineer at the ABC. After doing some initial enquiries, they discovered that no radio licences were being offered at that stage, so they left for an overseas trip thinking they had missed it. When Neville and Joan went overseas, everywhere they went, they came across Christian radio, and so the idea of a Christian radio station in Hobart just wouldn't go away! Finally, in 1978, the opportunity to apply for a public broadcasting licence came. The Browns were due to go overseas in just a few days when they heard about the opportunity. They quickly gathered together their meagre resources to apply for the licence. There were Christian licences being offered in every state and each group had to go before a tribunal to present their case. In the end, only two licences were offered. One in Sydney to what is now known as Hope 103.2, and 7HFC in Hobart! Once the licence was acquired, it was still a little bit longer before the 7HFC team could get the radio station on the air. Initially, a studio was setup in the corner of Neville and Joan's New Town home so that they could get the station off the ground. Then, at 2 PM on Sunday 30 March 1980, 7HFC (Hope Foundation Communicators) went to air in Hobart for the very first time! In the 1990s, Neville developed Parkinson's Disease, and so he began to focus on training. In 1996, he handed the station over to others. Neville died in 2004. Joan died in 2012.

Women overwhelmingly make up the majority of victims of hidden camera crimes, while men make up the vast majority of perpetrators. Many women and critics say that molka crimes and the lack of action taken towards them are a product of distorted gendered violence against women in South Korea and the flaws in the law enforcement system.  Prevalence and growth of spy cameras  The problem of filming someone without authorization, such as men using cell phones to film women on stairs and in subways, has been a common form of molka and has even led to requiring all South Korean cell phone manufacturers to have phones emit loud shutter noises upon taking a picture. Fixed spycams have been found in public areas in Korea as early as 1997, where secret cameras were found to be installed in the ceiling of a Sinchon department store's women's restroom. While the department store stated that the cameras were installed for ‘security purposes’ to catch pickpockets and people who vandalise toilets, the incident received much public criticism. With the increase in smartphone ownership and rapid development of technology, molka crimes have also been increasingly found in spaces such as public bathrooms, changing rooms, schools, and offices. Molka crimes have been called a product of fast, easy access to Internet technology and \\"backwards\\" misogyny, or an example of \\"digital male sexual violence.\\" According to police data, around 1,100 to 1,400 molka crimes occurred in 2010 and 2011 respectively, but in 2018, there were nearly 6,800 cases. Revenge porn, or private photos and footage taken and circulated by former lovers or partners without consent of the filmed subject, is a related form of harassment thought to be roughly as widespread of a problem in South Korea. In 2018, the police stated that 90% of molka crime was committed using a smartphone = Public restroom molka crimes = Public restrooms are one of the most commonly mentioned locations for spycam installation. Many women have said that they do not feel safe using public restrooms because they feel there is such a high possibility of there being a hidden camera, covering up holes and cracks in walls, toilet paper holders, and hairdryers where cameras might be hidden. In September 2018, the Seoul city government announced it would increase public restroom inspection by assigning 8,000 employees to inspect the city's 20,000+ bathrooms on a daily basis, a step up from the previous 50 employees and monthly inspections. Government inspectors have not actually discovered any recording devices in public restrooms despite checking nearly 200,000 restrooms across the country. According to police, many spy cameras are only installed for short periods of time—as brief as 15 minutes—and therefore can be difficult to detect even with the implementation of daily searches. = Motel molka crimes = Molka have also been found to be secretly installed in motel rooms, and the content of the recorded films are explicitly sexual rather than capturing women's bodies alone. Since couples are involved, motel molka crimes may also position many men as victims, in contrast to most other molka positioning. The perpetrator may check into a motel and install cameras in places such as hairdryer holders and satellite boxes. A particularly widespread incident was discovered in March 2019. Over a three-month period, more than 800 couples had been live-streamed having sex in 30 love motels across 10 cities in South Korea. The videos, which were posted online and accessible for a monthly subscription fee, were hosted on an overseas server so that the cameras' IP addresses would be harder to detect. The two men in charge of the scheme were arrested, and two other men were suspected to be accomplices. = Hospital molka crimes = In 2019, a clinician at a hospital in South Korea was caught filming women's intimate parts at a supermarket. The same clinician had also drilled a hole in a bookshelf positioned opposite a women's locker room and inserted a spy camera. Women were filmed taking off their clothes, some fully naked and some in their underwear. = Notable molka cases = These incidents regarding Korean celebrities involving in molka are: • Goo Hara (2018) incident that revealed Choi Jong Bum (ex-boyfriend) threatened to leak sex tapes on social media just because Goo Hara attacked him after hearing that Choi was upset that she was hanging out with an older acquaintance. He later blackmailed Hara stating the sex tapes he flimed, will end her career as a celebrity. The scandal prompted out further investigations over revenge porn and more protection towards the victims. Goo Hara, unfortunately committed suicide due to the severity of the incident alongside netizens reacting negatively over it. This case was finally acquitted, as the case has been headed to the supreme court after Choi Jong Bum was arrested. The Final Sentence will be announced on October 15. • JJY Chatrooms (2019) revealed a high-profile case of molka circulation, where celebrities such as Jung Joon-young and Choi Jong-hoon and other members of famous K-pop groups were found to have filmed or shared explicit sexual videos in a private chat room, many of which were filmed in motel rooms and involved with prostitution rings. The involvement of so many celebrities and high-ranking figures gave an example as to how widely the practice of illicit filming has spread in South Korea and how the issue is connected to other gendered violence and the common complacency of law enforcement towards or active concealment of crimes and violence towards women. The scandal has also fueled more discussion about these issues of illegal filming, prostitution, and sexual violence against women, among others.  Social reaction to molka crimes  There have been various reactions to the increased prevalence of molka crimes, including increased discussion and more physical demonstrations regarding the issue. President Moon Jae-in acknowledged in May 2018 that the spycam epidemic had become 'part of daily life' in South Korea and that there should be greater punishment for offenders. However, many treat molka incidents and other forms of gendered violence as outliers and the result of extreme individuals rather than a part of systemic misogyny and the use of power to silence sexual violence against women. Monthly protests against spy cameras from May to August 2018 in Seoul were in part catalyzed by one molka incident where the perpetrator was a woman who secretly filmed a nude male model. The investigation and punishment were conducted rapidly and harshly in comparison to most molka crime cases where nearly 98% of perpetrators are male, and the police's response to the rare case of a female perpetrator and male victim angered many women. Protest campaigns included removal of spycams, harsher punishments for perpetrators, and greater regulations around the sale of spycam equipment. \\"My life is not your porn\\" became a slogan popularized in the protest as a response to the prevalence of spy cameras installed in everyday places. The August protest condemning spy cameras particularly shattered records of protest numbers, reportedly drawing up to between 55,000 and 70,000 female participants according to organizers and becoming the largest women-only demonstration in Korea's history. But the controversy over the biased investigation was refuted by the police and the president. rather, they are a radical feminist 'male' hate of styles, widely criticized. they threatened and cursed men passing by the scene of the demonstration, and shouted slogans such as \\"Yes-Dick Not-guilty No-Dick Guilty\\", \\"Go and Jaegi(It is the name of popular anti feminist who died in suicide, South Korea's argot of the feminists means 'suicide')\\", And there's an allegation that they falsely announced the number of participants in the demonstration. A computer specialist who works to delete molka footage said that the protests drew enough attention to the issue of molka crimes that her company saw a surge in demand for its services.  Criminal sanctions  = Criminal law = Article 14 of the \\"Act on Special Cases Concerning the Punishment, etc. of Sexual Crimes\\" lists taking or distributing unauthorized pictures or videos as a crime. While hidden camera filming is technically a crime, the law remains vague enough that most molka filming incidents are not clearly illegal. For instance, most molka films are not readily classified as \\"illegal violence\\" if cameras are not specifically zoomed in to particular body parts or directly placed in garments. Even if a victim states that they felt \\"sexual humiliation,\\" a voyeuristic view of a woman using a public restroom may not be considered as illegal sexual violence. Police have also let offenders go in molka crimes where there was a lack of physical violence. There are also few legal avenues to prevent the circulation of molka footage even if the perpetrators have been found guilty. The rapid development of digital technology and the digital permanence of circulation of illegal molka content makes it difficult for a victim to recover damages even with proof of wrongdoing. = Sanctions = Molka crimes can result in jail time or fines. The filming of intimate videos without consent, or distributing without consent, can result in up to five years in prison or a fine up to 30 million won. As of 2017, nearly 80 percent of fines actually implemented are less than 3 million won, and nearly 80 percent of fines are imposed on the person who distributed the footage rather than those who install and initially film from spy cameras. The amount of the fines implemented is also inadequate when considering the funds required to remove molka videos from online circulation even for one month. Many women's groups refer to the lack of harsh punishment as a \\"slap on the wrist\\" for men and say that it demonstrates the lack of urgency authorities currently have for molka crimes. A study by the Korean Women Lawyers Association found that in 2016, the rate of prosecution amongst those accused of committing molka crimes was 31.5%. Of those tried for molka crime offenses from 2012 to 2017, 8.7 percent received a jail sentence. In 2017, more than 5,437 people were arrested for spycam-related crimes in South Korea and 119 were jailed. Statistics on cyber sex and digital sex crimes are not extensive enough to provide significant insight on the actual problems of victims and related trends of digital sex crime in Korean society, and the voices of victims and survivors do not have much weight in current official policy discussion. As a result, there is not substantial information that can be used as a basis to create effective policy and measures against these crimes as well as policies to protect victims of digital sexual violence. In 2017, an omnibus policy on digital sex crimes titled \\"Comprehensive Policies on the Prevention of Sex Crimes and Victimization\\" was passed. The act emphasizes strict investigation and punishment of sex crimes as well as establishment of support for victims and greater public education regarding sex crimes. The continued growth of molka crimes and lack of effective conviction following the creation of the policy shows a gap between the written law and its practical implementation. In a situational analysis based on data and periodic reports from the Korean National Police Agency, the Korean Women Lawyers Association, the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, and many others, published on October, 2019, it was found that despite protests against spy cameras in South Korea, and petitions signed calling to ban the use of spy cameras in 2018, the issue of spy cameras remains pressing matter in South Korea.

She is best known for her work recording live concerts for the Grateful Dead from the late 1960s to the early 1980s, including the Cornell 5/8/77 album. She is noted for her ear for recording and her long tenure with the band.  Early life  Growing up in Martinez, California, Cantor-Jackson developed an interest in electronics, saying \\"I used to take things like radios, other little electronic devices if they didn't work, open them up, mess with them, put them back together and they worked.\\" She started booking shows for her high school, which led her to promote and help with shows across the bay in San Francisco. Through this, she met people in the underground music scene who taught her how to do sound engineering. Her involvement in the music scene and interest in LSD led her to meet and subsequently start working with the Grateful Dead.  Grateful Dead era  In 1968, she landed an apprenticeship recording live sound with Bob Matthews at San Francisco venue the Carousel, which would later become the Fillmore West. The two worked together on the Dead's second studio album, Anthem of the Sun, in the same year. After this, the two regularly mixed and taped the band's live recordings and became known as \\"Bob and Betty.\\" A few years later, she married tour manager Rex Jackson, and they continued to record the band's live shows with their own tapes and equipment. After Jackson's death in a car crash in 1976, she was put on the band's payroll in 1977 and 1978 to record and help stage setup. Later, she began dating the Grateful Dead's new keyboardist, Brent Mydland. She did not feel welcome working with the band after the two broke up, saying, \\"Brent and I split up after a few years, with the last year spent in the studio working on his solo project. This put me in the category of the dreaded 'ex.' I didn't think that could apply to me, but he was a band member. Everyone was paranoid of me being around, so I no longer had access to my studio or the vault.\\" Her last work for the Grateful Dead during this period was the 1981 live album Dead Set.  The \\"Betty Boards\\"  Since Cantor-Jackson often used her own tapes and equipment when recording shows, they were in her possession unless bought by the Grateful Dead for their own releases. In the mid-80s, she was forced to foreclose on her home and moved to Oregon with her in-laws to be a nursing assistant. After struggling to pay storage fees for her belongings in California, her storage spaces were auctioned in 1986. These included the over 1000 tapes from her career as a live audio engineer, which became known as the \\"Betty Boards.\\" They were mostly recordings of the Grateful Dead, but included bands such as Legion of Mary, Kingfish, the Jerry Garcia Band, Old & In the Way, and the New Riders of the Purple Sage. The Grateful Dead declined to bid, leading to the storage lots being auctioned to the public. Three separate parties ended up in possession of the tapes; none of them were Grateful Dead fans. One party has held them in a storage locker since purchasing. The second party, an unnamed couple, got a friend to record the tapes to cassette from reel-to-reel in order to distribute them. The last, a high school teacher, kept them in his barn for years where they decayed, before he enlisted Rob Eaton, guitarist for the Grateful Dead tribute band Dark Star Orchestra, to help restore them. Over 200 tapes were restored and digitally archived, a total of almost 100 hours of music. The Grateful Dead offered the owner $100,000 for the tapes, but he refused to sell them for anything less than $1 million. Eaton went on to contact other owners to restore their tapes as well, reaching agreements with one of the other primary owners in 2014. However, several of these tapes have since been commercially released. The most notable of these is Cornell 5/8/77, a concert at Cornell University's Barton Hall. It is widely regarded as one of the Grateful Dead's best shows and one of the best live recordings of the band. In 2012 it was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress for being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically important, and/or inform or reflect life in the United States.\\"  Post Grateful Dead career  Cantor-Jackson quit taping shows until 2011, when she was asked to stage manage for Wavy Gravy's 70th birthday party and benefit concert. Playing the show was former Black Crowes' frontman Chris Robinson's new band, Chris Robinson Brotherhood. Cantor-Jackson loved the group and insisted on taping their future shows. These recordings turned into a series of lives albums called Betty's Blends. She also mixed and mastered for the Americana band Midnight North in 2015. As of August 2019 she is the engineer and production and road manager for the band and for the choir of Glide Memorial United Methodist Church. She still talks to some of the Grateful Dead's band members and crew and went to a show in Santa Clara during their highly publicized 50th anniversary tour.

Whereas ordinary memory stores information as binary states (represented by \\"1\\"s and \\"0\\"s), quantum memory stores a quantum state for later retrieval. These states hold useful computational information known as qubits. Unlike the classical memory of everyday computers, the states stored in quantum memory can be in a quantum superposition, giving much more practical flexibility in quantum algorithms than classical information storage. Quantum memory is essential for the development of many devices in quantum information processing, including a synchronization tool that can match the various processes in a quantum computer, a quantum gate that maintains the identity of any state, and a mechanism for converting predetermined photons into on-demand photons. Quantum memory can be used in many aspects, such as quantum computing and quantum communication. Continuous research and experiments have enabled quantum memory to realize the storage of qubits. Background and history The interaction of quantum radiation with multiple particles has sparked scientific interest over the past decade. Quantum memory is one such field, mapping the quantum state of light onto a group of atoms and then restoring it to its original shape. Quantum memory is a key element in information processing, such as optical quantum computing and quantum communication, while opening a new way for the foundation of light- atom interaction. As we all know, restoring the quantum state of light is no easy task. While impressive progress has been made, researchers are still working to make it happen. Quantum memory based on the quantum exchange is possible to store photon qubits Kessel and Moiseev has discussed quantum storage in the single photon state in 1993. The experiment was analyzed in 1998 and demonstrated in 2003. Basically, the study of quantum storage in the single photon state can be regarded as the product of the classical optical data storage technology proposed in 1979 and 1982. Not only that, but the idea was inspired by the high density of data storage in the mid-1970s. Optical data storage can be achieved by using absorbers to absorb different frequencies of light, which are then directed to beam space points and stored. Types =Light Quantum Memory= Normal, classical optical signals are transmitted by varying the amplitude of light. In this case, a piece of paper, or a computer hard disk, can be used to store information on the lamp. In the quantum information scenario, however, the information may be encoded according to the amplitude and phase of the light. For some signals, you cannot measure both the amplitude and phase of the light without interfering with the signal. To store quantum information, you need to store the light itself without measuring it. If you measure it, the information is lost. Light for quantum memory is recording the state of light into the atomic cloud. When light is absorbed by atoms, they can input all the information about the quantum of light. =Solid Quantum Memory= In classical computing, memory is a trivial resource that can be replicated in long-lived memory hardware and retrieved later for further processing. In quantum computing, this is forbidden because, according to the clone-free theorem, any quantum state cannot be reproduced completely. Therefore, in the absence of quantum error correction, the storage of qubits is limited by the internal coherence time of the physical qubits holding the information. \\"Quantum memory\\" beyond the given physical qubit storage limits, it will be a quantum information transmission to the \\"storing qubits\\", \\"storing qubits\\" is not easily affected by environmental noise and other factors, and then when needed information back to the preferred \\"process qubits\\", to allow rapid operation or read. Discovery Optical quantum memory is usually used to detect and store single photon quantum states. However, producing such an efficient memory is still a huge challenge for current science. A single photon is too low in energy to be lost in a complex light background. These problems have long suppressed quantum storage rates below 50%. A team led by professor Du Shengwang of the department of physics at the Hong Kong University of science and technology and William Mong Institute of Nano Science and Technology at HKUST has found a way to increase the efficiency of optical quantum memory to more than 85 percent. The discovery also brings the popularity of quantum computers closer to reality. At the same time, the quantum memory can also be used as a repeater in the quantum network, which lays the foundation for the quantum Internet. Research and application Quantum memory is an important component of quantum information processing applications such as quantum network, quantum repeater, linear optical quantum computation or long-distance quantum communication. Optical data storage has been an important research topic for many years. Its most interesting function is the use of the laws of quantum physics to protect data from theft, through quantum computing and quantum cryptography unconditionally guaranteed communication security. They allow particles to be superimposed and in a superposition state, which means they can represent multiple combinations at the same time. These particles are called quantum bits, or qubits. From a cybersecurity perspective, the magic of qubits is that if a hacker tries to observe them in transit, their fragile quantum states shatter. This means it is impossible for hackers to tamper with network data without leaving a trace. Now, many companies are taking advantage of this feature to create networks that transmit highly sensitive data. In theory, these networks are secure. =Microwave storage and light learning microwave conversion= The nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond has attracted a lot of research in the past decade due to its excellent performance in optical nanophotonic devices. In a recent experiment, electromagnetically induced transparency was implemented on a multi-pass diamond chip to achieve full photoelectric magnetic field sensing. Despite these closely related experiments, optical storage has yet to be implemented in practice. The existing nitrogen-vacancy center (negative charge and neutral nitrogen-vacancy center) energy level structure makes the optical storage of the diamond nitrogen-vacancy center possible. The coupling between the nitrogen-vacancy spin ensemble and superconducting qubits provides the possibility for microwave storage of superconducting qubits. Optical storage combines the coupling of electron spin state and superconducting quantum bits, which enables the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond to play a role in the hybrid quantum system of the mutual conversion of coherent light and microwave. =Orbital angular momentum is stored in basic steam= Large resonant light depth is the premise of constructing efficient quantum-optical memory. Alkali metal vapor isotopes of a large number of near-infrared wavelength optical depth, because they are relatively narrow spectrum line and the number of high density in the warm temperature of 50-100 ∘ C.Alkali vapors have been used in some of the most important memory developments, from early research to the latest results we are discussing, due to their high optical depth, long coherent time and easy near-infrared optical transition. Because of its high information transmission ability, people are more and more interested in its application in the field of quantum information. Structured light carries the orbital angular momentum, which must be stored in the memory is to faithfully reproduce the stored structural photons. Atomic vapor quantum memory is ideal for storing such beams because the orbital angular momentum of photons can be mapped to the phase and amplitude of the distributed integration excitation. Diffusion is a major limitation of this technique because the motion of hot atoms destroys the spatial coherence of the storage excitation. Early successes included storing weakly coherent pulses of spatial structure in a warm, ultracold atomic whole. In one experiment, the same group of scientists in a two-orbital caesium magneto-optical trap was able to store and retrieve vector beams at the single-photon level, characterized by changes in the plane polarization of the transverse beam. The memory preserves the rotation invariance of the vector beam, making it possible to use it in conjunction with qubits encoded for maladjusted immune quantum communication. The first storage structure, a real single photon, was achieved with electromagnetically induced transparency in rubidium magneto-optical trap. The predicted single photon generated by spontaneous four-wave mixing in one magneto-optical trap is prepared by an orbital angular momentum unit using spiral phase plates, stored in the second magneto-optical trap and recovered. The dual-orbit setup also proves coherence in multimode memory, where a preannounced single photon stores the orbital angular momentum superposition state for 100 nanoseconds. Optical Quantum =GEM= GEM(Gradient Echo Memory) is a photonic echo optical storage technology. The idea was first demonstrated by researchers at ANU. Their experiment is a three-level system based on steam. This system is the most efficient we've ever seen in hot steam, up to 87%. =Electromagnetically induced transparency= Electromagnetically induced transparency was first introduced by Harris and his colleagues at Stanford University in 1990. The work shows that when a laser beam causes quantum interference between excitation paths, the optical response of the atomic medium is modified to eliminate absorption and refraction at the resonant frequencies of atomic transitions. Slow light, optical storage, and quantum memory are realized based on electromagnetically induced transparency. Compared to other approaches, the electromagnetically induced transparency approach has a long storage time and is a relatively easy and inexpensive solution to implement. The electromagnetically induced transparency does not require the very high power control beams required for Raman quantum memory, nor does it require specific liquid helium temperatures. In addition, unlike the method based on photon echo, photon echo can read electromagnetically induced transparency while the spin coherence survives due to the time delay of readout pulse caused by a spin recovery in non-uniformly broadened media. Although there are some limitations on operating wavelength, bandwidth, and mode capacity, techniques have been developed to make electromagnetically induced transparency quantum memory feasible in quantum information systems. In 2018, a highly efficient EIT-based quantum memory in cold atom has been demonstrated of 92% storage efficiency, which is the highest record to date. =Crystals doped with rare earth= The mutual transformation of quantum information between light and matter is the focus of quantum informatics. The interaction between a single photon and a cooled crystal doped with rare earth ions is investigated. Crystals doped with rare earth have broad application prospects in the field of quantum storage because they provide a unique application system. Li Chengfeng from the quantum information laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences developed a solid-state quantum memory and demonstrated the photon computing function using time and frequency. Based on this research, a large-scale quantum network based on quantum repeater can be constructed by utilizing the storage and coherence of quantum states in the material system. Researchers have shown for the first time in rare-earth ion- doped crystals. By combining the three-dimensional space with two-dimensional time and two-dimensional spectrum, a kind of memory that is different from the general one is created. It has the multimode capacity and can also be used as a high fidelity quantum converter. Experimental results show that in all these operations, the fidelity of the three-dimensional quantum state carried by the photon can be maintained at around 89%. =Raman scattering in solids= Diamond has very high Raman gain in optical phonon mode of 40 THz and has a wide transient window in a visible and near-infrared band, which makes it suitable for being an optical memory with a very wide band. After the Raman storage interaction, the optical phonon decays into a pair of photons through the channel, and the decay lifetime is 3.5 ps, which makes the diamond memory unsuitable for communication protocol. Nevertheless, diamond memory has allowed some revealing studies of the interactions between light and matter at the quantum level: optical phonons in a diamond can be used to demonstrate emission quantum memory, macroscopic entanglement, pre-predicted single-photon storage, and single-photon frequency manipulation. Future development For quantum memory, quantum communication and cryptography are the future research directions. However, there are many challenges to building a global quantum network. One of the most important challenges is to create memories that can store the quantum information carried by light. Researchers at the University of Geneva in Switzerland working with France's CNRS have discovered a new material in which an element called ytterbium can store and protect quantum information, even at high frequencies. This makes ytterbium an ideal candidate for future quantum networks. Because signals cannot be replicated, scientists are now studying how quantum memories can be made to travel farther and farther by capturing photons to synchronize them. In order to do this, it becomes important to find the right materials for making quantum memories. Ytterbium is a good insulator and works at high frequencies so that photons can be stored and quickly restored.

She continued her studies at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn in 1958, earning a BFA in 1962. After attending Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid, Spain in 1963, she returned to Pratt and completed an MFA (1964). Following graduation, Murray worked with the United States Information Agency as an artist-in-residence in conjunction with the Grafica Americanska Exhibition held throughout Poland behind the Iron Curtain. Upon returning to the U.S., she accepted teaching positions at the University of Hawaii and the New York Institute of Technology; she would later teach and lecture at Long Island University, Pratt Institute, and Princeton University.

The Dallas Times Herald noted the \\"sheer visual dazzle\\" of their varied matte, gloss and slightly textured surfaces and \\"rhythms answered by counter-rhythms\\" that were anchored by thin, right-edge tan bars. In the mid-1980s, Murray began experimenting with raised areas of thick pigment, layered underpainting and dappled, gently modeled figures and grounds in paintings that the New York Times noted for contrasts of mysterious light and blackness and dynamic versus subdued, gradually clarified forms (e.g., Mercury or Bishop, 1983–4).Judith Murray website.

Retrieved August 25, 2020. By the end of the decade, Murray was producing paintings up to 8' x 9' that increasingly evoked the natural world, such as experiences of the Florida Keys—not literally, but as abstractly conveyed sensations (light, energy, sky, water, land, plants). Critic Barry Schwabsky wrote that this new work revealed \\"romantic affinities\\" and a sense of urgency and drama; he characterized Murray as \\"a temperate lyricist\\" combining sensibility (spirited brushwork, flickering light and tactility) and restraint (coherent architectures in each work). Many of her titles—some suggested by the poetry of Wallace Stevens—evoked the poetics of place or nocturnal moods: Night Fishing (1998), Camouflage for the Moon (1997), Shadows in Our Sun (1999–2000). Lilly Wei describes these works as vibrant, staccato \\"landscapes without landscapes, plumbing the referential, not the representational.\\" In the 2000s, critics continued to highlight Murray's lyrical expression, ethereal brushwork, sense of light, and increasingly, her sculptural use of paint, which lent her work depth, motion and a tangible physicality.Ban, Sandra. \\"Judith Murray,\\" ARTnews, January 2007. Alanna Heiss and Edward Leffingwell suggest that while Murray's subject is \\"paint itself,\\" she simultaneously evokes real sensations such as evening light on water (the grays and calligraphic white marks of Primary Document, 2006) or the reds and pinks of a fiery sunset (Royal Flush, 2006). The atmospheric work Magnetic South (2006), a sunny, fluctuating field of thick yellow and pink strokes, is often cited as a bravura display of the Murray's ability to achieve equilibrium and coherent structure through dense, abstract gestures and color organization.

Critic Barbara MacAdam writes that Murray's later work assumes \\"a daring position … steadfastly sticking to abstract gestural work.\\" These paintings feature deep, seductive colors and complex, modulated roses, grays, creams, oranges, golds and silvers, as well as a sense of discontinuous space that together bridge Eastern influences—(Rajput painting, Persian carpets and textiles, Chinese painting)—and Western impressionistic or pointillistic techniques. Lilly Wei described Murray's \\"Continuum\\" show (2009) as continuing her shift to a more painterly mode with \\"explosive, complex, imbricated rhythms\\" that conjure \\"landscapes in flux, worlds in transition and the roiling energy of the cosmos.\\" Murray's \\"Without Borders\\" show (2012) signaled \\"a stunning departure\\" and \\"breakthrough\\" to critics Lawrence Osgood and David Cohen, respectively, synthesizing her early hard-edged work and current expressive style. She continued to employ accumulated, Cézanne-like short brushstrokes, lively patterns and the right-edge bar, while introducing small, scattered geometric shapes recalling, in miniature, her 1970s figures; eccentric, crystalline and almost heraldic, these forms seemingly \\"invade\\" the now- signature all-over patterns of works such as First Day and A Night in Tunisia (both 2011). Murray's aptly named exhibition, \\"Tempest\\" (2018), featured mosaic-like, whirlwind compositions, overflowing with richly colored, energetic brushstrokes that reviews compare to swarms of bees or schools of fish crossing the picture plane. Its centerpiece was the large diptych, Once in the Morning (2014), which featured a sense of deep space and a blanket of gold marks that critics likened to the opulence of a Klimt interior. The show also introduced a new, late-career development: small, uncharacteristically quick-looking 11\\" x 14\\" canvasses employing a wider bar (to maintain the illusion of the square format), intersecting perspectives and interruptive gestures (e.g., Poof, Junction and Gaggle, 2017–8); they suggest buoyancy, movement and natural forces run amok.

It is a carnivorous fish that is endemic to the Atlantic Ocean (with the exception of the Southern Ocean and Arctic Ocean) and to much of the southern and northern Pacific Ocean.  Taxonomy  The species was first described by the Danish zoologist Henrik Nikolai Krøyer in 1868. Its genus name Magnisudis is derived from the Latin words magnus (\\"large\\") and sudis (\\"stake\\"), while the species name atlantica refers to the fish being predominantly found in the Atlantic Ocean. The fish's common name is a reference to the shape of its jaw being similar to that of a duck's bill.Lourdes, Maria & Palomares, M L D & Froese, Rainer & Pauly, Daniel. (2019).

They have a line of similarly colored and well defined scales running down their lateral line. The gill slits, mouth and jaws are a silvery metallic color.  Distribution and habitat  All oceans with the exception of the Arctic and Southern oceans are suitable environments for M. atlantica. However, the majority of specimens have been found within the northern Atlantic. Additionally there is a sizable minority of specimens which have been recorded along the Pacific coast of the Americas. A small amount of specimens have been found off the east coast of Japan and the Kamchatka Peninsula as well as the east coast of Australia off New South Wales. M. atlantica is generally pelagic and can be found in the mesopelagic to bathypelagic zone at depths of 66–2166 meters. It often lives closer to the coast in colder waters.  Reproduction  M. atlantica spawns year round in subtropical and tropical waters.  Diet and predation  M. atlantica feeds on small fish and shrimp and is in turn preyed upon by sharks, tuna and fish-eating whales.

Bone and cartilage, as load-bearing biological materials, are of interest to both a medical and academic setting for their propensity to fracture. For example, a large health concern is in preventing bone fractures in an aging population, especially since fracture risk increases ten fold with aging. Cartilage damage and fracture can contribute to osteoarthritis, a joint disease that results in joint stiffness and reduced range of motion. Biological materials, especially orthopedic materials, have specific material properties which allow them to resist damage and fracture for a prolonged period of time. Nevertheless, acute damage or continual wear through a lifetime of use can contribute to breakdown of biological materials. Studying bone and cartilage can motivate the design of resilient synthetic materials that could aid in joint replacements. Similarly, studying polymer fracture and soft material fracture could aid in understanding biological material fracture. The analysis of fracture in biological materials is complicated by multiple factors such as anisotropy, complex loading conditions, and the biological remodeling response and inflammatory response.  Bone fracture  For the medical perspective, see bone fracture. Fracture in bone could occur because of an acute injury (monotonic loading) or fatigue (cyclic loading). Generally, bone can withstand physiological loading conditions, but aging and diseases like osteoporosis that compromise the hierarchical structure of bone can contribute to bone breakage. Furthermore, the analysis of bone fracture is complicated by the bone remodeling response, where there is a competition between microcrack accumulation and the remodeling rate. If the remodeling rate is slower than the rate microcracks accumulate, bone fracture can occur. Furthermore, the orientation and location of the crack matters because bone is anisotropic. = Bone characterization = The hierarchical structure of bone provides it with toughness, the ability to resist crack initiation, propagation, and fracture, as well as strength, the resistance to inelastic deformation. Early analysis of bone material properties, specifically resistance to crack growth, concentrated on yielding a single value for the critical stress-intensity factor, K_c, and the critical strain-energy release rate, G_c. While this method yielded important insights into bone behavior, it did not lend insight to crack propagation like the resistance curve. Resistance curve of crack extension force versus crack extension for a brittle and ductile material, showing G_c, the critical strain energy release rate. The resistance curve (R-curve) is utilized to study crack propagation and toughness development of a material by plotting the crack extension force versus crack extension. In bone literature, the R-curve is said to characterize \\"fracture toughness\\" behavior, but this term is not favored in engineering literature and the term \\"crack growth resistance\\" is used instead. This term is used to emphasize the material behavior over a change in crack length. The R-curve linear elastic fracture mechanics approach allowed researchers to gain insight into two competing mechanisms that contribute to bone toughness. Bone displays a rising R-curve which is indicative of material toughness and stable crack propagation. There are two types of mechanisms that can impede crack propagation and contribute to toughness, intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. Intrinsic mechanisms produce resistance ahead of the crack and extrinsic mechanisms create resistance behind the crack tip in the crack wake. Extrinsic mechanisms are said to contribute to crack-tip shielding which reduces the local stress intensity experienced by the crack. An important difference is that intrinsic mechanisms can impede crack initiation and propagation while extrinsic mechanisms can only inhibit crack propagation.  Intrinsic mechanisms  Intrinsic toughening mechanisms are not as well defined as extrinsic mechanisms, because they operate on a smaller length-scale than extrinsic mechanisms (usually ~1 μm). Plasticity is usually associated with “soft” materials such as polymers and cartilage, but bone also experiences plastic deformation. One example of an extrinsic mechanism is fibrils (length scale ~10’s nm) sliding against one another, stretching, deforming, and/or breaking. This movement of fibrils causes plastic deformation resulting in crack tip blunting.  Extrinsic mechanisms  alt= Extrinsic toughening mechanisms are more well elucidated than intrinsic mechanisms. While the length-scale of intrinsic mechanisms are in the nanometers, the length scale of extrinsic mechanisms are along the micron/micrometer scale. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of bone have allowed imaging of extrinsic mechanisms such as crack bridging (by collagen fibers, or by un-cracked \\"ligaments\\"), crack deflection, and micro- cracking. Crack bridging by un-cracked ligaments and crack deflection are the major contributors to crack-shielding while crack bridging by collagen fibers and micro-cracking are minor contributors to crack-shielding. =Crack bridging= The extrinsic mechanism of crack bridging is when material spans in the crack wake behind the crack reducing the stress intensity factor. The stress intensity experienced at the crack tip, K_{tip}, is decreased by the stress intensity of bridging, K_{br}. K_{tip} = K_{app} - K_{br} where K_{app}is the applied stress intensity factor. Crack bridging can occur by two mechanisms of different length scales. *Crack Bridging by Collagen Fibers Crack bridging by Type I collagen fibers otherwise known as collagen-fibril bridging is on a smaller length-scale than untracked ligament bridging. The structure of collagen is in itself hierarchical, consisting of three alpha- chains wrapped together to form pro-collagen which undergoes processing and assembles into fibrils and fibers. The diameter of the collagen molecule is approximately 1.5 nanometers, and the collagen fibril is approximately 10X the diameter of the collagen (~10's nm). The process of crack bridging is analogous to the way polymers yield through crazing. Polymers plastically deform through crazing, where molecular chains bridge the crack reducing the stress intensity at the crack tip. Just as the Dugdale model is used to predict the stress intensity factor during crazing, the uniform-traction Dugdale-zone model can be used to estimate the decrease in the stress- intensity factor due to crack bridging, K_b^f. K_b^f = 2 \\\\sigma_b f_f \\\\bigg( \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2 l_f}{\\\\pi}} \\\\bigg) where the normal bridging stress on the fibers is denoted by \\\\sigma_b, the effective area-fraction of the collagen fibers is denoted by f_f, and the bridging zone length is denoted by l_f. * Uncracked \\"Ligament\\" Bridging Note: Ligament refers to the appearance of the extrinsic mechanism under imaging and not to the orthopedic ligament. Uncracked ligament bridging is one of the larger contributors to crack-shielding because the \\"ligaments\\" are on the length-scale of hundreds of micrometers in contrast to tens of nanometers. The formation of these ligaments are attributed to non- uniform advancement of the crack front or several microcracks semi-linked together forming bridges of uncracked material. = Crack deflection = Crack deflection and twist occurs due to osteons, the structural unit of cortical bone. Osteons have a cylindrical structure and are approximately 0.2 mm in diameter. As the crack tip reaches an osteon, crack propagation is deflected along the lateral surface of the osteon slowing crack growth. Because osteons are larger scale, than both collagen fibers and uncracked \\"ligaments, crack deflection through osteons are one of the major toughening mechanisms of bone. Schematic of crack propagation in cortical bone when microcracking occurs. Adapted from Vashishth et al.. A Formation of microcracks ahead of the crack tip B Crack accelerates into uncracked material ahead of microcrack zone (Stage I) C Crack growth slows as microcracks continue forming (Stage II) D Continuation of crack growth (Stage I) =Micro-cracking= As the name suggests, microcracking is the formation of cracks on the micron scale of various orientations and sizes. The formation of microcracks before and in the wake of the crack tip can delay crack propagation. Since bone often remodels both its trabecular and cortical structure to optimize strength in the longitudinal direction, the formation of microcracks in human bone are also formed longitudinally. This directionally in human bone contrasts with the more random orientation in bovine bone and lends to longitudinal bone toughness in humans. As with the other mechanisms of crack-shielding, the resistance curve (R-curve) can be used to study the resistance of cortical bone (trabecular bone is removed before experiments) to fracture. A generally accepted model for crack propagation under microcrack formation was proposed by Vashishth and colleagues. They studied the crack propagation velocity as the crack grew and identified two stages of crack growth that alternate as the crack progresses * Stage I: As the sample is loaded, the frontal process zone forms which is a zone of micro cracks ahead of the main crack tip. The crack accelerates through this zone until the crack tip is ahead of the formed microcracks. Crack propagation slows when the crack tip is ahead of the microcrack zone, where the region of microcracks exert a compressive stress on the crack tip. * Stage II: Microcracks continue forming around and ahead of the crack tip while the crack slowly progresses. When enough microcracks form, the crack goes back to Stage I.  Cartilage fracture  Studying cartilage damage and fracture from a mechanical perspective can lend insight to medical professionals on treatment of diseases affecting cartilage. Cartilage is a highly complex material with depth-variation of biological properties leading to differences in mechanical properties. Furthermore, cartilage has high water content and collagen content contributing to poroelastic and viscoelastic effects respectively. Experimentally, impact tests of cartilage samples can be done to simulate physiological high-intensity impact. Common type of experiments include, drop tower tests, pendulum tests, and spring-loaded systems. These impact tests serve to simplify the way the material is analyzed from poroelastic to elastic, because under high-velocity short-duration impacts, fluid does not have time to flow out of the cartilage sample.

It became one of the premier goldfields of Australia, yielding £23,000,000 worth of gold. Mosman is credited with having found the first gold-bearing stone.  Early life  Mosman was born about 1861 in North-Western Queensland. His tribal name is unknown. As a small boy, he came to Kynuna Station. In the late 1860s, pastoralist Hugh Mosman of Tarbrax Station visited Kynuna and liked the boy so much that Hugh Mosman arranged for the boy to come to live at Tarbrax with him. He was named Jupiter by Hugh Mosman because his eyes were \\"large, luminous, and as limpid as a planet\\". He became known as Jupiter Mosman and acted as Hugh Mosman's servant.  Prospecting  There had been discoveries of gold at Ravenswood and other places in North Queensland. Hugh Mosman decided to search for gold, selling Tarbrax to Duncan McIntyre of Dalgonally. Having travelled to Ravenswood with Jupiter, Hugh Mosman became acquainted with the prospector George Clarke and together with a Mr Fraser commenced a prospecting expedition in 1871. The party left Ravenswood working their way toward the Seventy Mile Pinnacle at Mount Leyshon, after which they swung back towards the high bluff, now known as Towers Hill, as it was an easily seen landmark. As they rode through the \\"Gap\\", camping on a creek on what is now the town side of the hill, Mosman was attracted by a stone in which he saw \\"color\\". The party soon realised that the ground was covered in gold-bearing brownstone quartz. They staked out a mining claim called \\"The North Australian\\" and found £6000 worth of gold on the surface. On 2 January 1872 they returned to Ravenswood where they formally registered their claim. This triggered a gold rush to what is now Charters Towers.  Education  Hugh Mosman and his white companions made much money from the Charters Towers gold fields, but soon went their separate ways. Hugh Mosman stayed longest but, after he lost his arm while using explosives, decided to retire to Sydney, taking Jupiter with him. There Jupiter was sent to school in Newtown, and afterwards to Lyndhurst College, Sydney, where he was baptised as Roman Catholic and christened John Joseph. There he did well at sports such as cricket, football and running. At cricket, he was a medium fast bowler, a good fielder, and a sound batsman. He could run 100 yards in 11 seconds. Hugh Mosman was a keen horseman who enjoyed competing in steeplechase races. He taught Jupiter how to ride and about horse racing more generally. They rarely opened a gate, preferring to jump their horses over it.  Pastoral work  After Jupiter had completed his schooling, Hugh Mosman and Jupiter returned to Charters Towers. When Hugh Mosman left Charters Towers in 1891, Jupiter decided he would join Hugh Mosman's nephew as a drover, taking a mob of cattle owned by Messrs Collins and White from Beaudesert near Kynuna to Wodonga in Victoria. The journey took six months and five days and no beasts were lost. Later Mosman worked for Messrs Rourke and Monroe at Lolwoth Station at Dotswood. He worked at a number of other pastoral stations, including Wombiana, and Stockyard Creek with Messrs Soilleux and Roberts. When he had the opportunity, Mosman went prospecting and is credited with discovering other mineral-bearing areas.  Later life  Grave of Mosman, Charters Towers Cemetery In his final years, Mosman was cared for at the Eventide Home nursing home in Charters Towers. Aboriginal people were not normally admitted to the home, but the people of Charters Towers successfully petitioned the Queensland Government to allow him residence there because of his historic association with Charters Towers. Mosman died at Eventide nursing home at Charters Towers on 5 December 1945 aged approximately 84 years. His funeral took place on 6 December 1945. He was one of the only two men remaining alive who were on Charters Towers in its beginnings, the other being Sir Thomas Buckland, who was then an assayer at Millchester.  Legacy  In December 1953, a large rock monument honouring Mosman as the founder of Charters Towers was unveiled in the front yard of Syd N. Williams opposite the Charters Towers Hospital. The unveiling was conducted by local Aboriginal leader King Kiara, son of Barney, of the Dalleburra people, who wore his breastplate for the occasion. A large boomerang-shaped monument was erected in memory of Mosman in Lissner Park, Charters Towers (). The Jupiter Mosman Cooperative Society provide accommodation services for Indigenous people in Charters Towers.

The initial rally fighting for anti-sexism and anti-violence of spy camera cases had sprouted into a series of rallies. The Hongik University spy cam case sparked the first rally. A male nude model was secretly photographed by another female model, and she was immediately arrested. However, many male spy camera perpetrators are not condemned and many cases go unsolved. Spy cam cases also called molka, a word for illegal and unconsented filming, in South Korea are common and many go unreported. From this incident, women gathered at Hyehwa Station to rally against women's discrimination and for reformation of the judiciary system against molka crimes. Following the initial rally on May, the participants increased to over 20,000 in June and July. The fourth rally in August had over 70,000 participants and took place in Gwanghwamun Plaza, a common venue for protests. Hyehwa Station Protest is continuous in 2019 as certain cases surface that question gender equality. Hyehwa Station Protest has evoked different responses from the media and government. Certain South Korea media has strong connection to certain government parties and their coverage ranges to different perspectives on this protest, which contrasts with coverage on American media of the topic. People in South Korea are losing faith in the authorities because of the lack of law enforcement and punishment of crimes. Beyond public restrooms, locations outside their homes are potential places of crime for both men and women. The Hyehwa Station Protest raises awareness about gender discrimination and sexual violence against women. Hyehwa Station Protest is an essential event that contributes to women's movement in South Korea.  Spy Camera in South Korea  = Hongik University Spy Camera Case = On May 1, 2018, a male nude model, remaining anonymous, in Hongik University's life drawing class was photographed without consent. Ahn, the 25-year-old female offender, was also a nude model working with the victim for a life drawing class in Hongik University's lecture room. During the break of the class, Ahn gets into a dispute with the victim. Ahn secretly photographed him, and later on the same day, she uploaded the photograph on a radical feminist site called Womad. After the photograph was uploaded, the victim was stripped of his personal information and encountered cyberbullying. After the release of the photograph, she was arrested 2 days later and sentenced to 10 months in prison. This case raised the controversy of double standards and gender inequality leading to Hyehwa Station Protest where activists protest for fair investigation. The state data shows that 98% of spy cam offenders are men and 80% of the victims are women. The male offenders have various titles such as professors, teachers, pastors, and even police officers. Under the Act on Special Cases Concerning the Punishment of Sexual Crimes, spy cam crimes is punished with up to 5 years in prison or 100,000 won, equivalent to 10,000 dollars. Many reported spy cam cases are unresolved because of lack of evidence or the difficulty of investigation. Many viewed Hongik University Spy cam Case as unfavorable investigation with a male victim, and 300,000 people signed a petition to the Blue House for a fair investigation of the case. = Jung Joon Young Spy Camera Scandal 2015-2019 = In March 2019, Jung Joon Young, a 30 year old South Korea singer- songwriter was accused of secretly filming women and sharing the footage in a group chat with other male celebrities and public figures. One of the male celebrities is Seungri, a male K-Pop idol who is one of the key figures of the Burning Sun scandal. The victims were around 11 women, some who are female K-Pop idols. Part of the group chat conversation was leaked March 12, 2019. The content involved derogatory terms and phrases for women and sexually objectified them. Jung Joon Young was arrested March 21, 2019 for spy cam video scandal and is scheduled to stand in court on June 27, 2019. During the investigation, the group chat was traced back to 2015, a time close to his scandal in 2016. In September 2016, Jung Joon Young was suspected for a spy cam scandal for filming his ex-girlfriend without her consent. On August 6, 2016, his ex-girlfriend pressed charges against Jung Joon Young for secretly filming her body and sexually assaulting her. On September 25, Jung Joon Young held a press conference stating that his ex-girlfriend had agreed to the filming when they were in a relationship. He claimed that they were involved in a fight because of his busy schedule and she had pressed charges against the use of the videos as a spy cam crime. After the press conference, his ex- girlfriend dropped the charges and clarified how they had resolved the misunderstanding. She also emphasized that she does not want to see Jung Joon Young punished. On October 10, 2018, the case was closed with Jung Joon Young as not guilty. After the uncovering of Jung Joon Young's Spy Cam Scandal in 2019, the 2016 case is being reinvestigated. After he is pressed with charges, the police brings him into questioning and demands him to submit his mobile device for inspection. However, Jung Joon Young first stated that he lost his phone and then reported the second time that he had found his phone but it was not functioning. He added that he would submit his phone after it was fixed, and then changed his claim again stating that he cannot recover any data on his phone. The police claimed that it would take long to recover and fix the device, so the case was transferred to the prosecutor. Although the device was never submitted for investigation, the case was closed. The victims were unaware that they were secretly filmed and even shared on the chat. One of the victims pressed charges stating she was sexually assaulted by Jung Joon Young and four other people. She realized that she was one of the victims after encountering the screenshots of the group chat conversation as well as voice recordings online. The last memory she had was drinking with them in a hotel suite after a fan meeting in March 2016. When she woke up, she was unclothed on the bed with a member of the group chat, also a male K-Pop idol named Choi Jong Hoon. During that moment, she states she did not understand the situation and quickly left the location. She only realized that she was sexually assaulted after the uncovering of Jung Joon Young's group chat. After the scandal, many female K-Pop idols were accused of being the victim, which was damaging their career. Their entertainment companies had to clarify to prevent any gossip around the issue. Many celebrities who were the victim of this case stayed quiet to protect their careers. This event evoked anger within the public and on March 2, 2019, activists gathered at Hyehwa Station bringing awareness not only to spy cam issues but also use of sexual assault drugs. = Illegal Motel Filming 2019 = From November 24, 2018 to March 3, 2019, spy cams in motels were broadcast live on the internet. Live broadcasting of spy cams to international site was unprecedented and placed many citizens in fear. The two offenders were Park, 50 years old, and Kim, 48 years old started to plan in June 2018. They were abroad running the international site to obtain international IP address, avoiding suspicion and IP address tracking. Within South Korea, they had two accomplices Im, 26 years old, and Choi, 49 years old. The spy cams were located in 10 cities, 30 different sites, and 42 rooms. The spy cams were 1mm in size and their locations were TV boxes, wall sockets, and hair dryer holders. There were around 1,600 victims; half was male and the other was female. Some may still not know that their videos were leaked live. After 3 months of investigation, Park and Kim was arrested and sentenced to 4 years in prison with 1.26 million dollar fine. The two accomplishes, Im and Choi, were not arrested, but the spy cameras have been removed. Spy cam cases in South Korea go unreported or undetected, and they do not lead to prison sentences. In 2017, more than 5,400 suspects were arrested, but fewer than 2% were sentenced to prison. In September 2018, the government officials announced for 8,000 employees’ inspection of 20,554 public restrooms. The authorities warn guests and public space users to pay attention to certain locations. Through surfacing of spy cam cases, activists hold signs with \\"My Life is Not Your Porn\\" protesting against spy cam uses. Women inspectors search 20,000 public toilets for spy cam as a response to this case.  Responses  = Media = The media coverage of the Hyehwa Station Protest differs in perspectives. Many people in South Korea shorten the word feminist as \\"femi\\" (페미). In some cases, the definition of feminism is misinterpreted as radical feminism. The different perspectives of the Hyehwa Station is split into a part of women's movement and the other as radical feminist movement. The different news coverage of the Hyehwa Station Protest reflects on civilian's perspective on feminism and the Hyehwa Station Protest. Some South Korean news coverage mentions the Hyehwa Station Protest's criticism of President Moon and states the violence of the protests and adds that these violent criticisms may deter the protest from reaching their primary goal. Many of the reporters of the news media had a particular experience at the Hyehwa Station Protest held on June 2, 2018 shining a light onto a new perspective. This protest had a restriction of the male press reporters asking questions. Male reporters were only allowed behind the police line for questioning and taking photographs. The male reporters state how they were frustrated that they couldn't get the best photographs or even interview the protesters. At the protest, the police line was a symbolic representation of how women cannot cross the gender boundaries in society. Another reporter, Lee from Hankook Ilbo, states that the gender discrimination was mirrored and was frustrating for him, but also thinks this was a great strategy to express one of Hyehwa Station Protest's primary goal, gender equality. = Civilians = The news reporters from BBC interviews the civilians witnessing the protest and their viewpoint. A middle aged woman states how she understands the gender inequality when she looks at her daughter, but is unsure when she thinks about her son. Another male bystander thinks that protests are necessary but needs to be cautious about the strategy and actions. A policeman at the scene interviews that he is afraid that there may be conflict between passing by civilians and protesters.  Women's Movement in South Korea  = Gangnam Post-It Note Protest = On May 17, 2016 a 23-year-old woman was stabbed in a restroom close to Gangnam Station exit 10. The assailant stated that he killed her due to his disgust for women and because he had been \\"murdered by a woman in his social life\\". After the murder occurred people gathered at the station exit to leave flowers and leave post-it notes expressing mourning, forming the Gangnam Station Post-It Note protest. The focus of the protest was to raise awareness about gender discrimination, misogyny, and gender inequality. The protest continued with protest marches and one week after the incident, at 7pm, protesters wearing black clothing and face masks gathered at the Sinnonhyeon Station, a subway station adjacent to Gangnam Station. Posters carried by attendees featured slogans such as \\"stop misogyny\\" and \\"we will be safe when we are equal.\\" Many young female activists participated in a large demonstration similar to Hyehwa Station Protest. = #MeToo = Comfort women were the first form of #MeToo movement in South Korea that has allowed for the following rallies and campaigns against sexual harassment. The #MeToo activism coincided with the Hyehwa Station Protest where a mass of young female activists are participating in a large demonstration in public. Sexual violence was one of the prevalent topics in the #MeToo movement in South Korea. The young female protesters in this movement became aware of the spy cam crimes and reacted to this issue. Many of these activists were also part of the Candlelight Protest to impeach President Park Geun Hye. Like Hyehwa Station Protest, #MeToo movement is pushing for reformation of the state and justice, acting against gender inequality. The #MeToo movement is connected to the global women's movement but in South Korea, the women are asking for specific reformation addressing government's unfair justice system and lack of enforcement of laws.

Eyer was a native of Bedminster Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania. During his career he taught school in Chester and Lancaster Counties, but by around 1786 he had moved with his entire family to Upper Mount Bethel Township in Northampton County, where he took a position at the Lutheran school. The family moved again in 1801, settling in Hamilton Township, Monroe County; there, at Christ Hamilton Lutheran Church, he became a schoolteacher and a clerk. He never married and remained in Hamilton Township until his death; during his career he taught in Mennonite schools as well as Lutheran. Eyer was the eldest son of the family, and in this position presided over the estate of his parents. With his brother Ludwig acting as agent, he founded and developed the town of Bloomsburg in 1802. Another brother, Johann Frederick, was a schoolmaster and organist who also produced fraktur. Eyer was friends as well with Andreas Kolb, another fraktur artist and Mennonite minister, with whom he exchanged artworks. In addition to his teaching activities, he was a successful businessman. Eyer produced hundreds of pieces of fraktur during his career, initially copying pieces produced by Mennonite or Schwenkfelder artists who created writing samples for their students. These he would fold to make a booklet, with four pages and a cover. Cutting a larger sheet in half lengthwise allowed him to produce a book of musical notation, a skill which he passed on to his pupils as well. Later in life he also produced hymnal bookplates, baptismal records, and presentation drawings, as well as illustrated poems. Also extant is a drawing of a soldier's wedding. The Mennonite Heritage Center owns several of his works. Three works are held by the American Folk Art Museum, while fourteen may be found in the collection of the Winterthur Museum. Twelve pieces are owned by the Philadelphia Museum of Art, or have been promised to the museum. Eyer's school roster book survives and has been translated for publication.

The unwritten rules of baseball are a set of unspoken rules in baseball that some players and managers follow. The rules often concern gamesmanship and not disrespecting players on the opposing team. Incidents have occurred when one or more players interpret the actions of another player as violating the unwritten rules, which can result in beanballs and bench- clearing brawls. As the rules are unwritten, and in many cases vague, the interpretation is left to the players involved. History Since the beginnings of baseball in the 19th century, players have adopted unwritten rules about how to behave during the game. According to sportswriter Ross Bernstein, these rules have evolved over time. Joe Garagiola Sr. wrote a book about baseball published in 1960, titled Baseball is a Funny Game, in which he mentioned the unwritten rules of baseball. In his book, Garagiola described the \\"purpose pitch\\", also known as a brushback pitch, a pitch thrown towards the batter's head. In 1986, Peter Schmuck and Randy Youngman of the Orange County Register wrote a column on the unwritten rules, identifying 30 such rules. The column was later carried by Baseball Digest in their June 1986 issue. The unwritten rules of baseball are meant to establish certain behavioral thresholds for sportsmanship. Though some rules are universal, they are not always enforced in an equal way. Certain players are given more leeway than others, especially veteran home run hitters who take time admiring their home runs. Unwritten rules The unwritten rules include: ;For the batter *Do not bunt to break up a no-hitter *Do not swing on a 3–0 count when your team is ahead *Do not spend your time admiring a home run you hit *Do not steal bases if your team is ahead by a significant amount *Do not swing at the first pitch of the at-bat if the pitcher has allowed back-to-back home runs *Do not work the count if your team is winning or losing by a significant amount *Do not rub the spot where you were hit by a pitch *Do not walk in front of a catcher or umpire when walking to the batter's box *Do not stand on the dirt near home plate when the pitcher is warming up *Do not assist a member of the opposing team *Do not speak to a pitcher who is in the process of throwing a no-hitter ;For the pitcher *A pitcher who is removed from the game in the middle of an inning must stay in the dugout until the end of the inning *A pitcher should not indicate displeasure if one of his fielders commits an error ;For the fans *Do not discuss a no-hitter that is currently in progresshttps://people.howstuffworks.com/why-is-it-bad-luck-to-mention-no- hitter-during-baseball-game.htm Punishments for violating the unwritten rules include beanball wars. These beanings can result in bench-clearing brawls. Some unwritten rules are no longer followed. The baseball color line, dictating that African Americans could not play in Major League Baseball (MLB), was an unwritten rule. It was broken in 1947. Notable incidents Stan Williams, a pitcher who played during the 1960s, wrote the names of players he felt he had to retaliate against on the inside of his baseball cap. In 1979, pitcher Ed Farmer allowed a home run to Wayne Gross, and felt that Gross took too long rounding the bases. The next time they faced each other was four years later; they were teammates and Farmer hit Gross during batting practice to retaliate. In a 1964 game between the Cincinnati Reds and the Philadelphia Phillies, the Reds' Chico Ruiz stole home during a scoreless game, while Frank Robinson, their best hitter, was at bat. The Phillies felt this violated baseball's unwritten rules, and he was hit in the ribs during an at bat. Pitcher Bob Gibson was a known adherent of the unwritten rules. He once beaned an opposing batter for a perceived slight that occurred 15 years earlier. Nolan Ryan adhered to the unwritten rules, and was known to retaliate for violations against other teams' players with beanballs. He would also throw beanballs at hitters who bunted to him, making him field his position. The Chicago White Sox took issue with his brushback pitches, leading to a brawl between Ryan and Robin Ventura after Ryan threw at Ventura during a game in 1993. In 1994, while playing in Minor League Baseball, Michael Jordan violated the unwritten rules by stealing third base even though his team had an 11–0 lead. His manager, Terry Francona, explained the unwritten rule to him after the game. Alex Rodriguez was twice criticized for violating the unwritten rules during his career. In 2007, Rodriguez distracted Howie Clark from catching a pop up while he ran the bases. During a 2010 game between the Oakland Athletics and New York Yankees, Rodriguez ran from first to third base on a foul ball, and crossed the pitcher's mound while returning to first base. Athletics' pitcher Dallas Braden called out Rodriguez for crossing the mound. Players who have bunted to break up a no-hitter have received attention. Ben Davis bunted against Curt Schilling during a potential perfect game in 2001, stirring controversy. During a 2014 game, Andrew Cashner was in the process of a no-hitter, when Domonic Brown bunted for a hit. Andrelton Simmons bunted for a hit during a no-hitter in 2018. In 2015, Manny Machado hit a home run off of Jonathan Papelbon, and Papelbon believed that Machado took too much time admiring the home run. The next time they faced each other, Papelbon threw at Machado's head. Bryce Harper, Papelbon's teammate, took issue with Papelbon's reaction. When Harper failed to hustle on a fly out, Papelbon confronted Harper in the dugout, leading to a fight. Harper later called for the end to the unwritten rules. While many fans agreed with Harper, players supported Papelbon. In the 2015 American League Division Series between the Toronto Blue Jays and the Texas Rangers, the Blue Jays' José Bautista hit a home run and flipped his bat in an exaggerated manner. Pitcher Sam Dyson took offense to the bat flip and told Edwin Encarnación to tell Bautista to \\"respect the game\\". The next year, Bautista slid into the Rangers' Rougned Odor, leading to a fight. In a 2019 National League game between the Cincinnati Reds and Pittsburgh Pirates, Reds player Derek Dietrich hit a home run against pitcher Chris Archer, which bounced out of the stadium and into the Allegheny River. The Pirates felt he admired it for too long of a time, and Archer threw behind him on his next at-bat, sparking a brawl that resulted in the ejections of four players and Reds manager David Bell. Dietrich went on to hit another home run that also left the stadium, though the Pirates eventually won 7-5.https://www.mlb.com/news/benches-clear-in-reds-pirates-series-finale \\"Let the Kids Play\\" marketing campaign In 2018 MLB launched a marketing campaign called \\"Let the Kids Play\\", which explicitly criticized the unwritten rules concerning bat flips and player celebrations. MLB began embracing bat flips, promoting them to fans on social media. This became an issue of contention when Tim Anderson did a bat flip after a home run in April 2019. Pitcher Brad Keller hit Anderson with a pitch during Anderson's next at bat, causing a bench-clearing brawl.

It officially began operation on May 14, 1887, as The Arlington Observer. The name Arlington is from the section of Kearny along the Greenwood Lake Branch of the Erie Railroad. The first issue was a single-page news broadsheet, filled with stories about the town and its residents. Early issues contained stories of local businesses, institutions such as the town's five churches, one public school, the shipyards, and manufacturing companies that framed the hub of the area. Annual subscription was $1.50, or 3¢ per copy. The title was changed to The Observer in 1889, and was shortly named The Kearny Observer during a portion of 1936, before reverting to its original title later that year. By 1939, the paper was recognized for wielding a powerful influence in its section of New Jersey. The newspaper registered the domain theobserver.com in 1996, and in the early 2000s, it changed its format from broadsheet to tabloid, and featured the addition of sporadic color printing. In 2012, it offered readers an online e-Edition, which features breaking news with video and audio.

Biography  He was the son of the painter, Antonio Cabral Bejarano. He actually began his studies with and only later took lessons from his father. In 1845, he enrolled at what is now the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de Santa Isabel de Hungría in Seville. After graduating, he was named an honorary \\"Painter to the Queen\\" (Isabel II). Many years later, he became a Professor there. He received honorary mention at the Exposiciones Nacionales de Bellas Artes in 1858, 1864, 1879 and 1880, (in Cádiz), and in 1856, 1858, 1867 and 1878 in Seville. His great attention to the fine details of dress, architecture and everyday objects makes his paintings of significant documentary value. Although he is most familiar as a painter of genre scenes, he also produced many portraits; notably those for the French Ducal family of Montpensier, for whom he worked in 1877, and the actors, (dressed in her role of Adriana Lecouvreur) and (dressed as Sullivan).

Life  Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Mademoiselle Dihau au piano, (1890, Musée Toulouse- Lautrec. Dihau was born in Lille in 1843. She studied music at the Conservatoire de Lille where she obtained a First prize in 1862. She was the sister of Désiré Dihau, ten years her senior, a bassoon player at the Paris Opera and composer, whose melodies she interpreted. A teacher of singing and piano, she was a pianist by the Concerts ColonneEdgar Degas, Mademoiselle Dihau au piano, Musée d'Orsay (read online) and singer at the Orchestre de la Société des concerts du Conservatoire. She divided her time between her hometown and Paris where she settled with her brother after the 1870 Franco- Prussian War. It is in their apartment on Montmartre, at number 6 rue Frochot, that Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, their cousin, was introduced to Edgar Degas. In 1867-1868, he painted her first portrait, Mademoiselle Marie Dihau, kept at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Between 1869 and 1872, he painted a second portrait of the artist, Mademoiselle Dihau au piano, kept at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris. In 1890, Lautrec, who called himself her \\"ordinary painter\\", a great admirer of Degas, painted another portrait entitled Mademoiselle Dihau au piano, kept at the Musée Toulouse-Lautrec of Albi and in 1898 La Leçon de chant where Dihau at the piano accompanies her friend Mrs Janne Favereau standing up. The painting is exposed at the Mohamed Mahmoud Khalil Museum of Cairo.Théodore Duret, Toulouse-Lautrec, Paris, 1920, VisiMuZ Editions, 2016 (read on line) The paintings are hung in the Dihau's living room and then, after Désiré's death in 1909, in Marie's modest apartment on rue Victor-Massé where \\"the charming old maid lives off a small income and the product of the music lessons she gives, often free of charge, to the young girls of Montmartre who are preparing to sing in the cafés\\".Jean Sutherland Boggs, Degas, New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1988, 633 p. (read on line) In need of money, she sold her first portrait painted by Degas to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 1922. Not wanting to separate herself from the two other Degas paintings she owned, L'Orchestre de l'Opéra and her portrait on the piano, she sold them to the Musée du Luxembourg in 1923, subject to usufruct and the payment of an annual rent of 12,000 Francs, financed by David David-Weill for L'Orchestre and for the portrait. Faced with the enthusiasm aroused, during an exhibition in 1924 at the Galerie Petit, by the two works which had never before been shown to the public, except for a few artists and a few relatives of the Dihau such as Toulouse-Lautrec, the contract was bought by the Musée du Louvre where they were exhibited after Dihau's death in 1935. They were transferred to the Musée d'Orsay in 1986. Under the same conditions, she bequeathed her portrait and the portraits of her two brothers painted by Toulouse-Lautrec to the city of Albi, which assigned them to the Toulouse-Lautrec Museum upon her death.

Goon held Commercial pilot licence No. 511 and was originally an instructor with Royal Victorian Aero Club (RVAC) at Essendon Airport, then later at Moorabbin, Wangaratta, Benalla, Albury, Corowa, Shepparton, Mildura and Swan Hill. Goon was also held Aircraft Engineer's Licence C and D grades. Goon's military career began when in 1935 in a Boeing P-26 Peashooter fighter with Chiang Kai-shek's forces in the Second Sino- Japanese War alongside Garnet Malley, and was credited with three kills with the Flying Tigers. Goon was one of a select group of civilian instructors teaching Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) personnel to fly. However, Goon had difficulty enlisting, as despite being born in Australia, his Chinese heritage conflicted with the RAAF decree that \\"all candidates of the Empire Air Training Scheme must be British subjects of pure European descent and also sons of parents both of whom are ... British subjects\\". Goon was eventually able to enlist via support from fellow RVAC member and then Minister for Air, the Hon. James Fairbairn. Wackett Trainers, at Ballarat (Vic.) The four aircraft from No. 3 Elementary Flying Training School, Essendon (Vic), were led by 280427, Flight Lieutenant Kenneth Holmes Wood in A3-77. Other aircraft were flown by instructors with pupils, 251367, Flight Lieutenant James Connelly Kinnear, and 251686, Flight Lieutenant Roy Francis Goon; and last instructor's name not recorded. Goon subsequently enlisted as a Pilot Officer in July, 1940 and flew a variety of aircraft including DH 60, DH82, Avro Cadet Trainers, Miles Falcon, Oxford, Wirraway, Bell P-39 Aircobra, Curtis P40E, Waco C & D, Boeing P26A, Stinson Reliant, Kittyhawk and CAC Boomerang. Goon was promoted to Squadron Leader of No. 83 Squadron RAAF in August, 1943. In 1945 Roy was Mentioned in Dispatches with his Citation noting: > \\"Squadron Leader Goon was posted to command No. 83 I/F Squadron which moved > to the North Western area in January 1944. No. 83 Squadron was responsible > for the protection of convoys and the shipping route from Horn Island to > Darwin and the base at Gove. These shipping patrols were particularly > arduous. They necessitated long flights over the seas in single engine > aircraft in all weathers. Squadron Leader Goon displayed conspicuous > leadership and devotion to duty and was at all times an inspiration to all > personnel under his Command\\". After the war with 5,000 hours in the log book, he continued his flying career in general aviation and was also operating the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia service for Whyalla. In 1958 he became a Test Pilot with the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation, particularly on the CAC Ceres crop dusting aircraft and also CAC Wirraway conversions. Goon was still with RVAC in the late 1960s in the advanced training live-in college, training Qantas and TAA cadets. The RVAC estimated that Goon trained over 800 pilots in peace and in war. One of his students was RAAF fighter ace, \\"Bluey\\" Truscott DFC & Bar. Roy Goon was also an outstanding aerobatic pilot and received Life Membership of the Australian Aerobatic Club.

It is named after the Shoshone woman named Sacajawea who guided Meriwether Lewis and William Clark during their expedition to the Pacific Ocean. The lake is made up of four sections, each separated by a bridged road. Several small parks are part of the larger Lake Sacajawea Park. Lake Sacajawea Park is a 67-acre park in the middle of the city. The lake's water is pumped into the north end from the Cowlitz River and flows to the south end where it exits into the Columbia River. Construction The lake was constructed in 1924 when what was then known as Fowler's Slough was dredged. Prior to dredging, Fowler's Slough was a channel of the Cowlitz River. This project was part of the larger project of founding the town of Longview by Robert A. Long. Japanese garden In 1990, the idea was conceived to create a Japanese garden on one of the lake's islands. Over the following years and with help from the community, the garden was developed. The idea and design for the garden came from then Longview Parks Superintendent Al George. He had the idea from seeing gardens while stationed in Japan during his time in the navy. Go 4th Festival During the week of July 4th, Lake Sacajawea hosts an annual festival which includes a flea market, a parade, concerts, and a fireworks show. The festival began in the 1960s and attracts more than 30,000 people per year. Solar system walk In 2001, the Friends of Galileo Astronomy Club installed plaques along the lake's trail. These plaques make up a scale model of the solar system which can be followed by walking along the west side of the lake. Each plaque provides details about the planet it represents.

His name has numerous variations but, at birth, it was most likely Cernotis or Zernotis. Life and work Nothing was known of his life until some documents were discovered in 1902. He was probably born on Rab, a small island just off the Croatian coast which, at that time, was part of the Republic of Venice. By 1530, apparently already a painter, he was in Venice. where he is on record as paying taxes for his wife, Marina. In 1533, he designated his brother, a priest named Gerolamo, to be his executor and legal representative. In the 1548 register of tithes, Marina is described as a widow.Biography from the Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani @ Treccani At first, his only attributed work involved three paintings that were part of a project begun in 1530 by Bonifacio Veronese at the Palazzo dei Camerlenghi.

Profil  The first issue of the German Biographical Encyclopedia contained articles on around 56,000 people. In the second edition, this number grew to around 63,000 people. The majority of the articles are short biographies compiled by the editorial staff; in addition there are around 1,300 detailed personal articles written by experts and signed by name. The period of coverage started with the beginning of the written tradition and continues to the present day – with the exception of living persons. It documents life and work, origin, educational background, influential encounters, significant works and achievements, friendships, membership of groups and associations, reception, in special cases prizes and honours. The geographical area to which the DBE refers is defined by the German language. In addition to people from Germany, Austria and German- speaking Switzerland, which in historical perspective also include those from Alsace, the Baltic States, South Tyrol, etc., the DBE also includes emigrants or German-speaking minorities abroad.  Criticism of the first edition  In contrast to the Neue Deutsche Biographie (NDB), the DBE was largely developed as a compilation from other reference works, with only a very small proportion of articles written specifically for the DBE. It could be realized in a comparatively short period of time, but also attracted criticism.vgl.

Korean flags and photographs now align the road to remember its significance. The March 1st Independence Movement Road in Daegu (3.1 운동길) is located in Dosan-dong, Jung- gu, Daegu of the Gyeongsang Province in South Korea. On March 8, 1919, students from various high schools in the area secretly assembled and rallied down this alleyway — at the time a pine forest — and its 90-step stairs during the March 1st Independence Movement. The road is located near many other historical sites relevant to the March 1st Independence Movement and overarching independence struggle, including the new building of the Daegu First Presbyterian Church, the homes of the Christian missionaries from the U.S., and the home of Seo Sang-don, the leader of the National Debt Repayment Movement, which aimed to gain back Korean autonomy. Today, pictures from the March 1st Independence Movement and taegukgis (Korean flags) decorate the walls all along the road, and it is included in many Daegu tourist courses due to the road's significance. TOC  Historical Context  = March 1st Independence Movement = Korea had been under Japanese rule from 1910-1945. One of the earliest demonstrations of resistance occurred in 1919 with the March 1st Independence Movement. The March 1st Independence Movement started on March 1, 1919, by which millions of Koreans assembled and marched, declaring Korean independence from Japan. These demonstrations occurred mostly in the capital Seoul, but also all throughout Korea, reaching all the way south to Busan. One of the active cities in this movement was Daegu of the Gyeongsang Province, with its own branch of the Independence Club as well as a women-led group called The Patriotic Women's Educational Society. On March 8, 1919, about 23,000 people protested in four major demonstrations across Daegu against the Japanese colonization of Korea, shouting “Mansae!\\" or \\"Long live Korean independence!\\" and reading out the Declaration of Independence of Korea from Japan. These demonstrations were met with harsh violence from the Japanese police, with many citizens being injured and murdered.Kim, Yong-bock. 1980. Historical Transformation, People's Movement, and Messianic Koinonia: A Study of the Relationship of Christian and Tonghak Religious Communities to the March First Independence Movement in Korea. Ann Arbor, MI: Princeton Theological Seminary.  Revolt in Daegu  = Important Actors =  Christians  Christians played a considerable role in the March 1st Movement.Stucke, Walter J. 2011.

Ann Arbor, MI: East Tennessee State University. This was true of the movement in Daegu as well, with many of its leaders and activists of Protestant faith. Churches were an active force in the independence movement, which explains the significance of the proximity of the Independence Road with the new building of Daegu First Presbyterian Church as well as the original homes of Christian missionaries. * Man-jip Lee was a minister at the First Presbyterian Church of Daegu, and the first president of Kyonam YMCA, where many Daegu youth organized campaigns for independence. He received the Declaration of Independence from a messenger from Seoul, and played a leading role during the protest on March 8. He was arrested by Japanese police for his involvement. * Tae-ryun Kim worked closely with missionaries and Man-jip Lee as the first manager of Kyonam YMCA. Kim received the Declaration of Independence from Lee and made copies in his home. He initiated the protest on March 8 by reading the Declaration of Independence, and his undying spirit even while being arrested ignited the passion of the remaining protesters. His son Yong-hae Kim was also arrested for his active involvement and became the first victim of the independence movement in Daegu after being tortured and killed by Japanese police.  High School Students  The independence movement in Daegu was nicknamed \\"the student movement\\" for its significant participation of students. Of the nearly 1,000 people who protested on March 8, the majority were students from Keisung, Shinmyung, and Daegu high schools. Students left school early that day to come participate in the protest, some hiding as marketers in West Gate Market and some hiding from Japanese surveillance on the stairwell in the nearby pine forest, now known as the March 1st Independence Movement Road. The students were a crucial part in the longevity of the protest, as they continued on after the original leaders had gotten arrested, allowing the movement to spread to neighboring cities. Currently, there are monuments built at Shinmyung and Keisung schools to commemorate the students' involvement in the movement.  Seo Sang-don  Seo Sang-don was the leader of the National Debt Repayment Movement, which he started in the efforts to gain back Korean autonomy after Japan supplied a massive loan in the attempts to strengthen its control over Korea. Seo started the movement in Daegu, and it spread to the rest of the country as part of the larger independence movement. Seo's house is located near the March 1st Independence Movement Road, and is included along with the road in many tourist courses about the independence movement in Daegu.  Women  Women were particularly active in the Daegu efforts of the independence movement through the Patriotic Women's League, Korean Patriotic Women's Society, and the National Debt Repayment Movement. Shinmyung High School, of which students took an active part in the March 8 protest, was also an all- girls' school.Park, Kyung Ae. 1992. Women and Social Change in South and North Korea: Marxist and Liberal Perspectives. East Lansing, MI: Michigan State University The Patriotic Women's League and Korean Patriotic Women's Society were underground groups actively resisting Japanese colonization by mobilizing community members, raising money for campaigns, and organizing the March 1st movement, and were active in Daegu as well. Women were also key players in the National Debt Repayment Movement started by Seo Sang-don in Daegu. While Seo encouraged men to save money by giving up smoking, women contributed by donating jewelry. * Aengmu was a Kisaeng who initiated women's participation in the National Debt Repayment Movement. She donated her own jewelry and cash despite belonging to a lower class, and encouraged her peers to do the same. Many Kisaeng, as well as other women, followed in her footsteps, inspired by her boldness during a time when it was rare for women to be involved socially.

Based on the DC Comics character of the same name who goes on to become Catwoman, Selina is a morally ambiguous street thief who becomes an ally and later love interest to Bruce Wayne, the orphaned son of Thomas and Martha Wayne. Camren Bicondova portrays Selina Kyle for the majority of Gothams run, but is replaced by Lili Simmons as an adult in the series finale.  Character development  Gotham depicts the origins of Batman, with the series starting with the murder of Bruce Wayne's parents, as well as that of notable allies and foes such as James Gordon, Alfred Pennyworth, Lucius Fox, Leslie Thompkins, Penguin, Riddler, Poison Ivy and The Joker. Catwoman has been considered a morally ambiguous character, initially being counted as one of Batman's foes but becoming an occasional ally in later comic storylines, developing an iconic love-hate relationship, as she is also Batman's most enduring love interest. Actress and dancer Camren Bicondova was cast to portray the teenaged Selina, assuming she was auditioning for a random role named \\"Lucy\\" and not finding out what the real role was until after she was selected. While she takes inspiration from previous Catwoman actresses Michelle Pfeiffer, Anne Hathaway and others, Bicondova wanted to portray a side of Selina Kyle not seen before, focusing on her past. As the series finale jumps ten years into the future from the rest of the series, Bicondova did not feel comfortable portraying her character as an adult, and at her request, an older actress was chosen to portray the adult Selina Kyle. Warner Bros. Television cast Lili Simmons in the role, with Simmons and Bicondova collaborating closely on the adult Selina's characterization.  Fictional character biography  = Season 1 = Selina Kyle is introduced as a 13-year-old street orphan and skilled thief. In the pilot episode of the series, she personally witnesses the murders of Thomas (Grayson McCouch) and Martha Wayne (Brette Taylor). She forms a tenuous alliance with GCPD Detective Jim Gordon (Ben McKenzie) after he saves her from kidnappers working for the Dollmaker (Colm Feore). She promises to help him solve the Wayne murders if he helps her get out of trouble with the law. Gordon has her temporarily housed at Wayne Manor, which leads to her befriending the Waynes' son, Bruce (David Mazouz). She saves him from a gang of hired killers and gives him his first kiss. She also helps Bruce find Reggie Payne (David O'Hara), the man who stabbed Bruce's butler Alfred Pennyworth (Sean Pertwee), pushing Payne out of a window to his death to prevent him from telling the people who hired him that she and Bruce are onto them. Selina also has connections with Ivy Pepper (Claire Foley) and later befriends Barbara Kean (Erin Richards), Gordon's ex- fiance. During the gang war between Carmine Falcone (John Doman) and Sal Maroni (David Zayas), Selina is among the street children recruited into Fish Mooney's (Jada Pinkett Smith) gang. When a gang war erupts between Oswald Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) and Mooney for the control of Gotham's underworld, Selina declines to pick a side and slips away during the conflict. = Season 2 = Selina later re-emerges working for Cobblepot's gang and tries to protect Bruce from corrupt billionaire Theo Galavan (James Frain) and his niece, Silver St. Cloud (Natalie Alyn Lind), who competes with Selina for Bruce's affections.Later,Bruce and Selina stage a kidnapping with the help of Tom the Knife (Tommy Flanagan) to try and find out what Silver knows about the Wayne murders. She teams up with Gordon and Cobblepot to save Bruce when he is kidnapped by the Sacred Order of Saint Dumas. She allows Bruce to live on the streets with her for a while and tries to teach him how to fight. When Bruce decides to go back home, Selina angrily spurns his friendship. Selina later volunteers to infiltrate Arkham Asylum to find Hugo Strange's (B.D. Wong) experiments. She also meets Bridgit Pike (Michelle Veintimilla), the alter ego of the vigilante Firefly, and becomes her ally in fighting human traffickers. In the season finale, Selina helps Bruce and Lucius Fox (Chris Chalk) infiltrate Arkham and save Gordon from Edward Nygma (Cory Michael Smith). = Season 3 = When Strange uses experimental technology to revive Fish Mooney, Selina once again goes to work for her. When one of Mooney's minions catches Ivy stealing from her, Selina tries to save her, but is helpless to stop Mooney's thugs from pushing Ivy into a vat of toxic waste. Later on, Selina encounters Subject 514A (Mazouz), a clone of Bruce created by Strange. After 514A saves Selina during a robbery gone wrong, she sees his scars and realizes he isn't Bruce. 514A explains the situation, and Selina tells him he is more normal than Bruce. With that, 514A kisses Selina and the two part ways. Later, while Selina is stealing wallets at the Cobblepot's party, she encounters Ivy (Maggie Geha), who reveals that Marv (victor pagan) aged her and gave her the power to make plants do her bidding. After Bruce confesses his feelings for her, Selina kisses him. She tries to help Bruce and Alfred break into a building owned by the Court of Owls, assisted by Selina's long-lost mother, Maria (Ivana Milicevic). Although Maria seems to want to reconnect with her daughter, Selina later discovers that she only returned to extort money from Bruce. Selina then tearfully tells her mother to leave Gotham and never return. Selina gets angry at Bruce once she finds out he kept the truth about her mother from her, and breaks up with him. 514A attempts to get Selina to leave Gotham with him, but she says that he will never be the man Bruce is and that she doesn't care about him. She attempts to warn Alfred, but 514A pushes her out a window. However, a herd of cats revive her, and she is taken to the hospital, where Ivy helps heal her. She comes back to Wayne Manor to kill 514A, but Alfred stops her and throws her out. She allies herself with Ivy and Cobblepot, but is captured by Barbara, Nygma and Tabitha Galavan (Jessica Lucas). She negotiates her way out by betraying Cobblepot, protecting Ivy, and getting money to leave Gotham. After her relationship with Bruce is further strained during the chaos caused by Jervis Tetch's (Benedict Samuel) \\"Alice\\" virus, Selina meets up with Tabitha looking for employment, which Tabitha gives her after testing her talents with a whip. Selina tells Tabitha that she is \\"done just surviving\\". = Season 4 = Eventually, Selina and Tabitha work for a revived Barbara Kean, even when Barbara aligns herself with Sofia Falcone (Crystal Reed). The Falcone family's hitman, Victor Zsasz (Anthony Carrigan), offers Selina and Tabitha the opportunity to enter Cobblepot's licensed crime system. After Tabitha refuses, Selina goes in alone. At Cobblepot's club, the relationship between Bruce and Selina rekindles, as Bruce apologizes for his previous behavior. They later encounter each other anonymously, both dressed as their vigilante personas. Selina is working for Barbara and Tabitha; she has to steal an ancient, mystical knife from Cobblepot's cargo, while Bruce is trying to make sure the knife doesn't fall into Ra's al Ghul's (Alexander Siddig) hands. When Bruce is spotted by Cobblepot's goons, they open fire and he has to fight his way out while Selina goes back to the Siren's club empty-handed. Bruce later buys the knife at auction and Selina asks him to give it to her, but he refuses and tells her to leave. When Barbara wants to shut the Sirens down, Selina proves her worth to them by going on her own to steal from the bikers' gang. The Sirens later oppose Cobblepot after being tasked to capture Nygma for him. The Sirens then capture Sofia as an asset against Cobblepot, then end up working for her to bring him down, sending him to Arkham and taking over his empire. Bruce and Selina meet again later in the season at the Siren's Club, where Bruce is drinking and partying to numb his guilt over killing Ra's al Ghul. Eventually, Bruce asks Selina for help, but she is on her way to stop Ivy from murdering innocent people and tells him to atone for his actions, especially regarding his behavior towards Alfred. During the second half of the season, Selina is torn between her loyalty to the Sirens and her feelings for Bruce, which causes friction between the three parties. Eventually, Selina helps Bruce fight other villains like Jerome Valeska (Cameron Monaghan), a resurrected Ra's Al Ghul, and Jonathan Crane (Charlie Tahan). Bruce is sprayed by Crane's fear toxin, but Selina is able to reach him. They share a kiss back at Wayne Manor seconds before she is shot and paralyzed by Jerome's brother Jeremiah (Monaghan). After Jeremiah and Ra's al Ghul destroy Gotham City's bridges to the outside world, turning the city into a No Man's Land, Bruce tells Alfred to take Selina to Gotham's last remaining hospital and oversee her recovery. = Season 5 = Months later, Selina has undergone an operation to keep her spine from collapsing, but she remains paralyzed. She tries to commit suicide, but her doctors stop her. Bruce takes the advice of a nurse to seek out \\"the witch\\" as he asks where to find her. The witch turns out to be Ivy (Peyton List), who reluctantly gives Bruce a strange boil to cure Selina. Once the boil is administered, Selina regains the ability to walk, as well as new, quasi-feline powers. Suffering from PTSD episodes, Selina decides to get revenge on Jeremiah by stabbing him in the chest. Later, Cobblepot comes to her for help in defeating jewel thief Magpie (Sarah Schenkkan), and the two of them plan to leave Gotham forever. Bruce and Selina share a surprise date where he expresses his intention to leave Gotham, which saddens her. Ivy walks in, hypnotizing Bruce and leaves Selina in the middle of a fight. Selina gets out and finds Bruce and they both violently fight each other. She manages to snap him out of it by hitting him and tearfully admitting that she doesn't want him to leave. Bruce takes Selina as his date to Gordon and Leslie Thompkins' (Morena Baccarin) wedding, and kisses her. However, Bruce eventually decides to leave Gotham in order to train himself to fight crime, leaving a heartbroken Selina a note wishing her well and promising to one day return. 10 years later, Selina has become a jewel thief and is being shadowed by a mysterious masked vigilante resembling a bat. Selina attends the opening of the new Wayne Tower and joins Barbara, Leslie Thompkins and Gordon in stopping Nygma and Jeremiah from destroying it. The vigilante – who she recognizes as Bruce – later tells her that he left Gotham City in order to protect her. She replies that she wanted him, not his protection. The two reconcile, but before leaving, Bruce tells Selina to return a diamond she had stolen, to which she mutters \\"like hell\\".

It has become one of the world's emerging economies and one of the fastest growing countries in the world with a strong industrial base caused by an economic boom in the 2000s. In addition, Turkey's economic situation was relatively prosperous during the 2008 global financial crisis. The Turkish government has developed a series of macroeconomic policies in accordance with the new economic plan and the Turkish government has used the new government structure and cooperated with the international monetary fund, which has led to some good effects, including reducing the unemployment rate, higher education level, and increasing life expectancy. As a result, real GDP growth made Turkey one of the fastest growing countries in the 2000s. Turkish geopolitical strategy and geography are extremely important as it is the crossroads connecting Europe and Asia. Turkey is a founding member of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, a member of the G20 and the NATO, and a candidate for the European Union.  History  = Domestic politics = After the establishment of the Turkish Republic, the new government committed itself to a relatively moderate economic policy. The basic direction of Turkey's economic development has been preliminarily determined, namely, the development of modern national industries, protection of customs duties, encouragement of private investment and absorption of foreign investment. At the same time, Economy Minister Mahmut Isat Pozkur as representative of the \\"new Turkish economics\\" illustrates the basic economic policies of the Turkish government in the 1920s, the principle of nationalism and liberalism dual economy, the state-owned economy and non-state economy coexist and mixed structure of national capital and foreign capital, to raise tariffs and restrict imports, to protect national industry, emphasizing the countries in the credit and dominant position in the field of industry. In the 1930s, the Turkish government abandoned the relatively moderate liberal economic policies and promoted the radical nationalist economic policies, vigorously developed the state-owned economy, emphasized the principle of giving priority to industrial development, and expanded government intervention and investment in industrial production, aiming at accelerating the process of industrialization. Coping with the negative impact of the western economic crisis from 1929 to 1933 on the Turkish economy is the direct cause of the implementation of the nationalist policy in Turkey. Atatürk's government = Global dynamics and foreign divestment = The first President, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk announced that foreign companies and foreign businessmen would be allowed to invest in Turkey within the framework of the law in 1921. At the beginning of the Republic of Turkey, foreign capital played an important role in Turkey's economic life, with finance, railways, and mining under the control of foreign capital. In 1927, Anglo-French controlled Ottoman Banks provided about half of Turkey's production credit and even the right to issue notes. In 1930, the Turkish government established the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey, which was responsible for the formulation of monetary policies and the regulation of money supply. At the same time, it recovered the right to issue notes and purchased foreign enterprises and railways and ports operated by foreign capital. The degree of nationalization of the national economy was significantly improved. In the 1950s, the Turkish government emphasized the liberal economic policies, encouraged private capital and foreign capital to invest in the industrial sector, and established the Turkish industrial development bank to provide loans to private entrepreneurs who invested in industry. In 1954, the Turkish government promulgated the Foreign Investment Act (Act no. 6224), offering many preferential conditions to foreign investors, opening up the domestic market and attracting foreign investors. With investors from the USA, West Germany, France and Italy the following suit, the modern industrial sector is the preferred investment for foreign investors. = The common development of private economy and state-owned economy = During this period, the number and size of private enterprises have shown a trend of substantial growth. According to statistics, there were 660 private enterprises with more than 10 employees in 1951, 1,160 in 1953 and 5,300 in 1960. At the same time, the average number of workers employed by the private sector increased from 25 to 33. Since the 1960s, the Turkish government take a series of positive measures, including tax rebates for private entrepreneurs in the emerging industry investment and preferential tariffs on imported equipment imported industrial tariffs and private companies to provide low-interest loans, to encourage the development of private enterprises, private enterprises accelerate the pace of development, production of private enterprises the soaring, the industrial structure of the private enterprises are also changing accordingly. The constitution promulgated in 1961 emphasizes the common development of the private economy and state-owned economy, the organic combination of market economy and planned economy, and the leading position of the state in the financial field. Investment in the state-owned economy is mainly concentrated in large enterprises that are capital - and technology- intensive, such as infrastructure construction and metallurgy and chemical industry. The investment sector of the private economy is mainly small and medium-sized enterprises that produce daily consumer goods such as food processing and textiles. In this period, the mixed economic structure of state-owned organizations and private business coexisted for a long time, and state-owned companies and private enterprises were divided equally. State- owned organizations were few in numbers but large in scale; The number of business that owned by privates was huge, but the scale was small. Enterprises which owned by the state had advantages in capital, technology and production scale, and private enterprises had higher production efficiency and market competitiveness than state-owned enterprises. The input-output ratio of national enterprises was lower than the private sectors. The size of organizations owned by the state and their proportion in the total value of industrial output showed a trend of a gradual decline, while the size of private enterprises and their proportion in the total industrial output value showed an increasing trend. Still, the state sector had long dominated Turkey's industrial production.  Recovery and progression  = New economic policies implemented in the 1980s = In the 1980s, the Turkish government abandoned the import-important industrial development model, formulated new economic development strategies, encouraged private investment, expanded the market economy, established a free trade zone, and emphasized the competitiveness of the international market in the context of globalization. The export-oriented economic model has gradually matured. In January 1980, the Demirel government announced a new economic reform program, abandoning the industrialization strategy of inward-looking import substitution, reducing direct government intervention, reducing import tariffs, implementing liberalized economic policies, and formulating export-oriented and market- adjusted Economic strategy is a turning point in the history of Turkey's economic development model. Furthermore, Turgutz Özal was appointed as the deputy prime minister to oversee economic affairs. In the year after the military coup, Özal's economic recovery plan was initially implemented, and the inflation rate fell from 140% to 35%. The government's fiscal revenues and expenditures gradually became balanced. After Özal was elected prime minister in 1983, he increased the implementation of new economic policies, devalued currencies, raised interest rates, frozen wages, encouraged private investment, attracted foreign investment, encouraged exports, relaxed import and export trade and currency restrictions, and increased export competitiveness. To alleviate the trade deficit, improve fiscal revenue and expenditure, and curb inflation. At the same time, the government is committed to transforming state-owned enterprises and promoting the privatization of state-owned enterprises. Since 1984, the government has abolished the preferential and subsidy policies enjoyed by state-owned enterprises, implemented fair competition between state-owned enterprises and private enterprises, and sold privately owned enterprises' securities and stocks to privately, canceled private investment restrictions, and expanded private investment. = Rapid economic growth in the 1990s = The new economic policy implemented in the 1980s accelerated the development of the Turkish economy. The annual growth rate of GDP was 3.3% in 1983, 5.1% in 1985, and 7.5% in 1987. In contrast, the rate of economic development in the 1990s, except 1991 and 1994, generally exceeded the 1980s (annual growth in GDP, 9.4% in 1990 and 0.3% in 1991). In 1992, it was 6.4%, in 1993 it was 8.1%, in 1994 it was 6.1%, in 1995 it was 8%, in 1996 it was 7.1%, and in 1997 it was 8%). On the other hand, the implementation of the new economic policy has led to a rapid increase in import and export trade. Along with the growth of import and export trade, the structure of export commodities has undergone significant changes; the export volume of industrial products has continued to rise, which constitutes a prominent phenomenon in the rapid development of the export- oriented economy in the 1990s. In 1990, Turkey's total exports increased to 13 billion U.S. dollars, of which the proportion of agricultural products in total exports fell to 25.5%, and the proportion of industrial products in total exports rose to 67.9%. In 1997, Turkey's total exports reached US$26.2 billion, of which agricultural products accounted for only 20.8% of total exports, and industrial products accounted for 74.9% of total exports.  Consequences of the new economic policy  As a result of the rapid growth of population and the rapid progress of industrialization, Turkey's urbanization has also led to corresponding changes in the social structure, shaping a new social class. The consequences of the new economic policy are the violent fluctuations in the economic field, the intensification of the polarization between the rich and the poor, which has a wide-ranging social influence and profound political influence. It is the historical background for the emergence of Islamism in the Turkish political arena. The inflation rate was lower than 40% in the early 1980s, 70% in 1987, and 1201% in 1992. In 1987, 20% of the rich had a 49.8% income; in 1994, 20% of the rich had a 50% income. On the one hand, modern industrial workers have gradually emerged and become important social forces; on the other hand, the shanty towns where rural immigrants live have expanded year by year, and the urban poor have expanded dramatically. The 1950s was the fastest stage of urbanization. In the 1980s, the number of shanty towns around the city, the number of people living in the city, and the proportion of the urban population showed a significant upward trend. With the expansion of shanty towns around the city and the rapid expansion of the urban poor, the opposition between the rich and the poor in urban society has become increasingly prominent, and the collapse of the traditional order has led to the state of helplessness and serious unemployment in the lower classes moving from rural to urban areas, providing radical forces and soils that are highly inclined to breed.  Current economic status and future economy  According to data released by the Turkish Statistical Office, gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 2.4% in the fourth quarter of 2017, which was the second consecutive quarter of economic decline after the third quarter contracted by 1.6%. Affected by the deterioration of the relationship between Turkey and the United States, the exchange rate crisis in Turkey. For the whole of last year, the Turkish lira fell by 30% against the US dollar. Due to the sharp depreciation of the lira, the cost of corporate debt repayment has increased, and many companies have filed for bankruptcy. In addition, Turkey is also facing high inflation problems. In October 2018, the consumer price index (CPI) rose by 25% year-on- year, a record high in 15 years.

History St Peter's was built as a chapel of ease to St. John the Baptist at Symondsbury, with £3,000 of its cost having been bequeathed by the rector, Rev. Gregory Raymond, who died in 1863. His successor, Rev. Henry Rawlinson, continued efforts to build a church at Eype.

Plans for the church were drawn up by the architect Talbot Bury of London who supervised its construction. The builder was Mr. George Swaffield of Shipton Gorge, with all carpentry and woodwork carried out by Mr. George G. Hayward of Burton Bradstock. Mr. W. K. Brown of Bridport undertook plumbing, painting and decorative work. The completed church was consecrated by the Bishop of Salisbury on 24 August 1865.The Western Flying Post – Consecration of the memorial church at Symondsbury – 29 August 1865 Eype Centre for the Arts In the face of a declining congregation, work was carried out at the church in 2002–03 to give it an additional role as an arts venue and it opened in 2003 as the Eype Centre for the Arts.

The game focuses on survivalOutward review – surviving with friends, Metro as well as the concept of the player being a commoner rather than a hero, and features several survival game aspects. Gameplay On top of more traditional gameplay of action role-playing games, Outward includes several survival aspects, such as having to carefully watch one's warmth, hunger, fatigue and thirst. It's also possible for the player character to suffer from such conditions as a cold, a disease or indigestion. Losing all of one's health in battle can lead to a variety of consequences, including being imprisoned by enemies or being brought back to safety by an NPC. The game has an auto-save system, meaning the player is unable to manually save and return to earlier saves upon death or other such setbacks. While the game has a magic system, spells were specifically designed to be challenging to obtain. Similarly, skills and stat increases must all be earned by completing quests for NPCs or paying experts to receive training. Quests have multiple outcomes, and success or failure can permanently affect the game world and how the story progresses, such as a character being convinced to stay in a faction, or an important city being permanently destroyed if the player fails to kill certain characters.Fantasy RPG Outward is the survival game I've been looking for, PC Gamer Story The game starts with the player character, an inhabitant of the city of Cierzo, getting shipwrecked off the coast of their home city. They had previously inherited a debt called a Blood Price from their ancestors, a debt that must be periodically paid. A Blood Price affects all members of a given family, and the voyage was meant to pay it off. Now penniless, and despite having barely survived the deadly wreck, they are given only five days by the desperate townsfolk to pay off this debt and retain the family holdings. Once this debt has been paid, or the players home has been seized, the player is given multiple ways to react to their unfair situation and the true story begins. They can free themselves of their bloodline by joining the Holy Mission of Elatt, enter a new spotless bloodline by helping the Blue Chamber Collective, or free themselves of the entire system through the Heroic Kingdom of Levant. These three factions are trapped in a stalemate; the Blue Chamber wants to uphold the current status quo, the Kingdom of Levant wants to overthrow the unfair Blood Price system and let people live for themselves, and the Holy Mission similarly rejects the bloodline and social systems upheld by the Blue Chamber but only because it hinders the forming of a unified front against the common enemy of mankind, an otherworldly force called the Scourge. After the player joins a faction, the stalemate starts to crack and global events begin to progress. The main part of the story consists of three parallel storylines, one for each of these factions, all of which are perspectives of the bigger story. Main quests have time limits, though these are typically several months. Downloadable content The first downloadable content called The Soroboreans came out for PC on June 16, 2020 and came out for PS4+Xbox One on July 7, 2020. It adds new dungeons and enchantments. Reception The game received mixed reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic. Outward has sold over 400,000 copies as of October 2019.

It is one of the Boulevards of the Marshals, which circle the outer parts of the city.  Route  The boulevard starts at Porte de Bagnolet and ends at Porte des Lilas, where it is continued by boulevard Sérurier. The housing estate is located on the west side, near Porte de Bagnolet. The boulevard was accessible through the Petite Ceinture bus line. Now it can be reached through the Métro Line 3.  History  A portion of the Thiers wall, the military structure and moat that later was replaced by the various Boulevards of the Marshals. The French war department had completed the Thiers wallincluding fortifications, a dry moat, a Rue Militaire and a large bermaround 1840. In 1859, the military engineering service gave conditional control to the Paris city council. The expansion of the land area of Paris in 1860, by annexing bordering communities, created a situation where everything within the Thiers wall was Paris and everything without was not. The Thiers wall, with its accompanying berm and moat, led to a profound disruption and complication of the synergistic relationship between Paris and its suburbs. Paris city council started upgrading and conversion of some sections of the Rue Militaire into boulevards in 1861, with the (yet unnamed) Boulevard de Mortier one of the first stretches to open. In 1864, the boulevard was named after Édouard Mortier (1768–1835), Duke of Trévise and Marshal of France. Each section of the upgraded Rue Militaire was then named for a marshal of the First French Empire (1804–1814) who served under Napoleon I, leading to the entire ring being collectively called the Boulevards of the Marshals. The Boulevards of the Marshals concept was almost fully realized by 1932, though the final three sections, closing the ring, would not be completed until 2005. Of the 22 boulevards, 19 have been named for Mortier or one of his fellow First Empire marshals.

It is located 5 km from the county center Rujiena, 45 km from Valmiera, 150 km from Riga, as well as 75 km from Pärnu and 200 km from Tallinn. Historical names are Wirken, Wirkken, Würken, Würcken, Wirkenhoff, Würkenhoff.  History  = The 16th Century = In 1520, on the orders of Wolter von Plettenberg, the Livonian Order master, several land parcels were leased to Kuddelen, who merged them and created a manor. The next owner of the manor was the von Dönhoff family – a well-known Baltic German family: the father, Gerard von Dönhoff, was the Governor of Tartu in 1598 and his sons, in turn Caspar von Dönhoff, a diplomat and a favourite of the Polish King Zigismund III Vases, was governor of Tartu (in today’s Estonia) and Sieradza (in today’s Poland) and Ernst Magnus von Dönhoff was the castellan of Parnu and Tartu. = The 17th Century = The First Half of the 17th Century – during the Swedish reign (Svenska Livland) from 1629-1721) the Manor belonged to the Engelhardt family. The first owner was a Swedish army cavalry lieutenant, the Vidzeme nobleman Michael von Engelhardt (who also owned the Endzele Manor). He received the manor as a gift from Swedish King Gustav II Adolf in gratitude for his faithful and long-time war service. Later the Manor was inherited by his son, the Baltic German landlord and major in the Swedish Army, Michael Johann von Engelhardt (1678-1730). In 1690, the Manor was taken away based on a decision by Swedish King Karl XI, but soon afterwards was returned. Rujiena municiplity (1798) = The 18th Century = The 18th Century – The Virkeni Manor continued to be owned by the von Engelhardt family. = The 19th Century = Ruhja kihelkonna mõisad (1903) From 1820 the Manor was run by artillery lieutenant and assessor Anton Johan II von Engelhardt (1788-1874) and his wife Sophie Magdalena Helene von Numers (1787-1848). Later, Virkeni Manor was inherited by Anton Johan’s II son Baron Karl Gustav Georg von Engelhardt (1811-1887) who was married to Eveline Katherine von Engelhardt (1826-1853) in 1850. In 1820, the Manor’s territory was the residence of 324 inhabitants (154 men and 170 women), while in 1860, according to the Rujiene Church Convent’s minutes, 249 inhabitants lived on the Virkeni Manor. From 1859-1861, the Neo-Latvian movement’s participant Jekabs Zvaigznite (1833-1867) worked as a tutor at the Virkeni Manor for Baron Karl Gustav Georg von Engelhardt’s (1811-1887) sons Karl Anton von Engelhardt (1851-1923) and Hermann Gustav von Engelhardt (1853-1914). At the time that he worked at the Virkeni Manor, he was a colleague of Juris Alunans, publishing the work „Sēta, Daba, Pasaule” (The Farmstead, Nature and the World) (1860). Immediately afterwards (in 1862) he became a member of the editorial staff at the „Pēterburgas Avīzes” (The Peterburg Newspaper). Karl Anton von Engelhardt began construction of a new Castle in the early 1890s, but his brother Hermann Gustav von Engelhardt left to study art in Germany and later became a painter. The last owner of the Virkeni Manor, Karl Anton von Engelhardt, who was connected with Russia’s emperor Aleksander II Romanov, lived abroad (Germany and Austria) from 1895 and rented the manor to his godson, the German cultivator Gustav Berkmann (1860-1931) for 300 roubles a year. From 1895-1910 Berkmann rented out the second floor of the Manor to Graf Treimanis from St. Petersburg. = The 20th Century = In 1920, the 704 ha large Virkeni Manor was taken over by the Latvian state and included in the State’s Land Bank. On 19 March 1921 the Virkeni Manor center was allocated to the Rujiena Agriculture Association to establish the Rujiena Agriculture school (from the end of the 1920s the Rujiena Agriculture and Home Economics School). On 16 October 1936 as a result of the liquidation of the Agriculture Association, the school became the property of the Agriculture Chamber.

He teaches sustainable and resilient architecture in lectures, workshops and writing. Promoting regionally specific architectural design, he often refers to vernacular architecture and the principles of new urbanism, rejecting globalised design trends as destructive to genius loci.  Biography  Lev was born in Czechia (then part of Czechoslovakia) to parents Jiri Loew, Czech architect, academic and politician and Lydie Loewova, architect. Prior to the Velvet Revolution the family was persecuted by the communist regime. He moved to Australia in 2005. He first established his multidisciplinary design practice in Prague in 1998. In 2005 he moved to Australia, where he studied architecture at the University of Newcastle under Richard Leplastrier and Kerry and Lindsay Clare. In 2014 Lev founded ArchiCamp, an irregular grassroots gathering of accomplished architects and architecture students, introducing the concept of loosely organised, guerilla style events, focused on learning and invited architectural intervention within disadvantaged or disaster-stricken rural communities.
