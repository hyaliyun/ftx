The film, in which Oliver Platt and Stanley Tucci play a Laurel and Hardy-like odd couple of out-of work actors, is set in the depression-era 1930s; indeed, the retro style of the film is a recreation of 1930s screwball comedy. The opening silent sequence harks back to the golden days of silent film. The film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1998 Cannes Film Festival.  Plot summary  In New York City, 1938 Arthur (Stanley Tucci) and Maurice (Oliver Platt) scrape a living by petty swindles, practicing their acting technique whenever they can. Following a drunken confrontation with pretentious and dreadful Shakespearean actor Sir Jeremy Burtom (Alfred Molina), they are forced to hide as stowaways on an ocean liner. Unfortunately for the duo, Burtom himself turns out to be a passenger on the ship, along with a vividly diverse ensemble of larger-than- life characters: a suicidal crooner named Happy Franks (Steve Buscemi) sobs through a song; Mr. Sparks (Billy Connolly), an aging gay professional tennis player; the first mate Voltri (Tony Shalhoub), who is also a mad bomber with his own language; and many more. Mistaken identities, pratfalls, slapstick, outrageous dialogue, and general mayhem ensue.

David Letterman, for whom the band served as house band on his late-night talk shows, often referred to Fig as \\"Anton Zip\\" or \\"Buddy Rich Jr.\\" Fig is also well-known for his work with Kiss and Ace Frehley. Early career Fig began playing drums at the age of four. After performing in numerous successful local rock bands in Cape Town, becoming locally respected with bands like Hammak, he moved to Boston to further pursue his musical interests. His formal education included studies at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, where he studied jazz and classical disciplines, and graduated with honors in 1975. In 1976, he moved to New York City, where he began to establish a career as a freelance musician. Fig was a member of the band Spider during both their album releases in 1980 and 1981 as well as on their 1982 album as newly-renamed band Shanghai, together with famed producer Beau Hill and songwriter Holly Knight. Fig had been the drummer on Ace Frehley's 1978 solo album and subsequently became a member of the then ex-Kiss lead guitarist's solo project Frehley's Comet from 1984 to 1987. Fig also played drums on all but one song on Kiss's 1979 album Dynasty and every song on their 1980 album Unmasked; the bringing-in of Fig to replace usual drummer Peter Criss (producers thought Criss, who had a drug problem, was not good enough of a drummer by then) upset Criss, to the point where, after appearing in promotional videos and tours through Unmasked, he left the band.Kitts, Jeff: 'Back in black (and white)', Guitar World, September 1996, p68 Eric Carr took over drumming duties following Criss's departure. Other artists with whom he has worked include Bob Dylan, Warren Zevon, B. B. King, Peter Frampton, Joan Armatrading, Cyndi Lauper, Link Wray, John Waite, Robert Gordon, Eric Johnson, Joe Bonamassa, Beth Hart and Kix. David Letterman Fig was the drummer for the Paul Shaffer-led house band of David Letterman's late night television shows since 1986, when he debuted with \\"The World's Most Dangerous Band\\" on NBC's Late Night with David Letterman. When Letterman's show moved to CBS in 1993 and became Late Show with David Letterman, the band (and Fig) moved as well, adding a horn section and becoming known as the \\"CBS Orchestra\\". During this tenure, Fig and the rest of the band have played with scores of artists including Miles Davis, James Brown, Bruce Springsteen, Steve Winwood, Bonnie Raitt, and Tony Bennett. Fig also played parts in several of the show's comic sketches, including the recurring gag, \\"Anton Fig's Guess The Expiration Date\\", in which Fig would be blindfolded and fed a perishable food product and attempt to guess the expiration date on the item solely from tasting it. The CBS Orchestra has also backed up a host of artists in other venues, such as Stevie Wonder, Faith Hill, Little Richard, and also B. B. King at the closing ceremonies of the summer 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. They also backed Al Green, Gloria Estefan, 'N Sync, and Eric Clapton for VH1's Save the Music concert at the White House. The World's Most Dangerous Band is also the house band for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Additionally, they were the backup band for The Concert for New York City where they performed with David Bowie, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, Eric Clapton and Buddy Guy, Macy Gray, and James Taylor. On occasions when Paul Shaffer has been absent from The Late Show or has guest-hosted, especially since the death of previous substitute bandleader Warren Zevon in 2003, Fig has filled in as bandleader. Other projects Some of the many recordings Fig has made include selections with Bob Dylan, Mick Jagger, Cyndi Lauper, Madonna, Gary Moore, Shanghai, Ace Frehley, Joan Armatrading, Rosanne Cash, Joe Cocker, John Phillips, Warren Zevon, Sebastian Bach, Oz Noy, Jed Davis, Joe Satriani, Paul Butterfield, Link Wray and Chris Spedding. He replaced Peter Criss on the Kiss albums Dynasty (1979) and Unmasked (1980), playing drums on all tracks for both albums (except Criss' song from Dynasty, \\"Dirty Livin'\\"). Due to Kiss' management attempting to cover up any personnel problems within the band, Fig would not be credited until years later, and Criss appears in the video for \\"Shandi\\" off the Unmasked album. As a freelance drummer, Fig has also played live with Paul Simon, Booker T and the MG's, The Thompson Twins at Live Aid, and Jim Keltner for Bob Dylan's 30th anniversary concert celebration. In 1996, Fig released a drum instructional video and book titled In the Groove and Late Night Drumming, respectively. In 2002, Fig completed his first solo record, Figments. Produced and co-written by Fig, the record represents three years of work and includes - among others singers and musicians - Richie Havens, Brian Wilson, Ivan Neville, Sebastian Bach, Ace Frehley, Al Kooper, Chris Spedding, Donald 'Duck' Dunn, Blondie Chaplin, Paul Shaffer, Chris Botti, Randy Brecker, and Richard Bona. In 2006, Fig worked with Blackmore's Night on The Village Lanterne. In 2007, Fig worked with Joe Bonamassa on his Sloe Gin album, in 2009 on his Ballad of John Henry album, and in 2014 on Different Shades of Blue. On 4 May 2009, Anton joined Joe Bonamassa's band for their debut appearance at the Royal Albert Hall in London, where Eric Clapton made a guest appearance. A DVD capturing this performance was subsequently released. Fig was featured on Ace Frehley's album Anomaly, released on 15 September 2009.

In 1969, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Jefferson Hotel is a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. On site is \\"Lemaire\\", a restaurant named after Etienne Lemaire, who served as maitre d'hotel to Thomas Jefferson from 1794 through the end of his presidency.  History  Tobacco baron Lewis Ginter planned the development of the hotel as a premier property in the city of Richmond, capital of the state. It was designed in the Spanish Baroque Style by Carr√®re and Hastings, noted national architects based in New York, who later designed the New York Public Library. Construction began in 1892 and the hotel opened for business on October 31, 1895. After a fire gutted the interior of the hotel in 1901, it had a lengthy restoration. It reopened in 1907. It has received restorations and upgrades of systems through the years. Patrons have included thirteen United States presidents, writers, and celebrities, including Henry James, Charles Lindbergh, The Rolling Stones, Dolly Parton, Elvis Presley, and Anthony Hopkins. In 1901, there was a wire fire that destroyed three-fifths of the hotel. There were no casualties; however, the statue of Thomas Jefferson was almost destroyed. The sculptor and crew pushed the statue on a mattress and pulled it to safety. During the rescue process, the head broke off. Eventually, the sculpture was repaired. In March 1944, another fire occurred. Six people were killed during the fire. In the check-in lobby, known as the Palm Court, nine original stained glass Tiffany windows with the hotel's monogram remain. The three stained glass windows above the front desk and the stained glass dome are reproductions. = Alligators in the lobby = In his autobiography The Moon's a Balloon (1972), Academy Award-winning actor David Niven described a trip from New York to Florida in the late 1930s, during which he decided to spend the night at the Jefferson Hotel. Niven said that, as he was signing the guest registry in the lobby, his eyes snapped open with amazement when he noticed a full-sized alligator swimming in a small pool located six feet from the reception desk. The alligators at the Jefferson became world-famous. Old Pompey, the last alligator living in the marble pools of the Jefferson's Palm Court, survived until 1948. Bronze statues of the alligators now decorate the hotel. Its restaurant, Lemaire, has a theme of alligator motifs.  In culture  The hotel and its restaurant were used for filming interior scenes for the 1981 American film My Dinner with Andre, featuring Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory.

The English version was translated from the French by Bernard Besserglik and published in 2005. The book exists also in Italian,L'ABC della drammaturgia SpanishLa dramaturgia and Portuguese. Content Writing Drama explores the mechanisms of dramatic story telling. The author makes a clear distinction between what is written to be seen and/or heard (theater, cinema, television, radio, opera and to a lesser extent comic books) and what is written to be read (literature). The book's principle is the same as Aristotle's Poetics. Yves Lavandier examines works by major scriptwriters and playwrights (Samuel Beckett, Bertolt Brecht, Charles Chaplin, Herg√©, Alfred Hitchcock, Henrik Ibsen, Ernst Lubitsch, Moli√®re, Dino Risi, William Shakespeare, Sophocles, Orson Welles, Billy Wilder, etc.) in order to answer three questions: * what do dramatic works consist of? * why is this so? * how does one go about writing them? The author scans all the tools of dramatic narrative: conflict, protagonist, obstacles, suspense, characterisation, three-act structure, preparation, dramatic irony, comedy, activity, dialogue. A play written by Moli√®re, The School for Wives, and a film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, North by Northwest, are analysed in detail. Several appendices deal with writing for children, drama and literature, short films, documentaries, etc. In the course of pages, Yves Lavandier develops several governing ideas. According to him: *Drama preexists theater and film. Life being full of conflicts and ruled by causality, one can say that life is Aristotelian. *The art of narrative can be taught, like every other human activity. *It takes two to speak the language of drama: writer and receiver. This is why dramatic irony‚Äîwhich consists in giving the audience an item of information that at least one of the characters is unaware of‚Äîis a fundamental mechanism, omnipresent in all genres (tragedy, comedy, melodrama, suspense, thriller, etc.) and all types of narratives. *All the great storytellers know the rules of narration, at least unconsciously. *One can respect the rules and take the spectator into account while keeping one‚Äôs liberty and authenticity. *Rules are called ‚Äúrecipes‚Äù by those who fear or despise them. *Drama should not be placed in the same basket as literature, Moli√®re and William Shakespeare beside Gustave Flaubert and Franz Kafka. *Dialogue, in theater or radio, is the visible part of the iceberg. Even in radio, structure and characterisation are paramount. *Theater is, as well as film, an art of the image. *To write a good story, three things are needed: conflict, conflict and conflict. *The spectacular and the sensational are cheap ways to generate emotion and often mingle with voyeurism and omnipotence. *When an actor is brilliant, he, of course, deserves all the plaudits he gets. But praise is also due to the director who directed him as well as to the writer who created his role in the first place. *The most powerful language of drama is structure, far before dialogue. *Nonetheless, the dialogue is inevitable when one tells a human story, even in silent movies where dialogues were numerous, either written on intertitles or guessed by the audience. *The three-act structure (dramatic acts, not logistical ones) relies simply on a universal triad: before-during-after. One can find the three-act structure in the vast majority of dramatic works, including in a narrative as deconstructed as 21 Grams. *Suspense should not be mistaken with mystery, Alfred Hitchcock with Agatha Christie. *Comedy is a noble, useful and difficult treatment. Its lightness is only an appearance, politeness. *As the mockery of human limitations, comedy may be disparaging but also demanding or compassionate. *The basics of the narrative are the pattern of a fractal structure. *TV series are highly respectable and can produce masterpieces of human art such as The Sopranos. *Children need good drama. To write for children is a wonderful school of narration. *Writers of drama will always be indispensable and keep on responding to a triple human need of emotion, meaning and distraction. Comment Writing Drama is considered a reference textbook amongst European playwrights and scriptwriters.What the professionals say about Yves Lavandier's Writing Drama According to Jacques Audiard, Writing Drama is on par with Aristotle's Poetics. Francis Veber said it is \\"the most thorough and challenging work of its kind to come out since the birth of scriptwriting\\". In 2006, Fr√©d√©ric Beigbeder called Yves Lavandier the \\"living god of screenwriters\\".

It is performed from any direction by putting an arm under the opponent's arm, and holding the opponent's midsection or upper body. Having an underhook with one arm is called a single underhook, while having underhooks with both arms is known as double underhooks. The typical response to an underhook is to try to break it, or to establish an overhook. Single underhook A single underhook can be used as a takedown maneuver. The protagonist underhooks one arm of the opponent and extends his underhooking arm partly or mostly across the opponent's back, while using his other hand to pull the opponent's other elbow across the opponent's body, and drives forward into the underhooked side of the opponent. Double underhooks The double underhooks are considered one of the most dominant positions in the clinch, primarily because they allow for great control of the opponent, and can be used for doing a takedown or throwing the opponent. The double underhooks can be used to advance into a bear hug by locking the hands behind the back, and holding the opponent close to the chest. The opponent typically responds to double underhooks with double overhooks, to prevent the opponent from advancing into the bear hug.

Grace Company expanded through the next century, creating myriad business divisions, including Grace Shipping, Grace Cruise Lines, Grace National Bank, Grace Petroleum, Grace Drilling, and Grace Healthcare. Grace acquired and combined other companies to create and expand businesses such as Barilla Pasta, FAO Schwarz, Ingersoll-Rand, Roto-Rooter, Del Taco, and Cartavio Distilleries. Under the leadership of the founder's grandson, J. Peter Grace, the company owned the country's largest oil-drilling fleet, ran the world's largest cattle ranch and the world's largest cocoa bean company; sugar plantations in Peru; cotton mills in Chile; silver, clay, phosphate, and tin mines; and processed rare earths for the US nuclear arms program. Grace owned a food group that operated 900 chain restaurant locations, a retail division with chains for sporting goods, home improvement, jewelry, aftermarket automotive parts, and leather goods. The company operated fertilizer companies, confectioners, and beverage companies, including Miller Brewing. Grace pioneered genetic engineering at its Agricetus division in Wisconsin, and human gene therapy at its Aurigent Pharmaceuticals group. The company constructed a 160-acre research complex, the Washington Research Center, in Columbia, Maryland. It also commissioned the New York City skyscraper, the W. R. Grace Building, as its world headquarters, in midtown Manhattan, from where it directed worldwide operations, including Grace Container Products, in Minhang China, the first wholly owned private business in communist China.\\"A Matter of Chemistry\\" - Time Inc. - Friday, Mar. 23, 1962 Grace listed on New York Stock Exchange with ticker GRA in 1953.

R. Grace & Co. According to a New York Times account, the company was incorporated as part of estate and successor planning, in 1895. The three brothers consolidated most of their holdings into a new private company, incorporated in West Virginia, called W. R. Grace & Company. The consolidation involved W. R. Grace & Co. of New York, Grace Brothers & Co. of Lima, Peru, Grace & Co. of Valparaiso Chile, William R. Grace & Co. of London, and J. W. Grace & Co of San Francisco. According to its website, W. R. Grace & Co. was incorporated in Connecticut in 1899. The listed capital of $6 million did not include Grace Brothers & Co. Limited in London or its branches in San Francisco, Lima and Callao, Peru, nor in Valparaiso, Santiago, and Concepci√≥n, Chile. J. Louis Schaefer, who joined the company as a boy, played a key role in not only W. R. Grace & Company, in which he became a vice president, but also as president of Grace National Bank. Schaefer was a co-executor of the estate of Michael Grace with William's son and corporate successor, Joseph P. Grace. J. Louis Schaefer died in 1927. =Shipping= Grace Line WWII poster For most of its history, Grace's main business was cargo shipping. To get cargo from Peru to North America and Europe, including guano and sugar, and noticing the need for other goods to be traded, William Grace founded a shipping division. Grace Line began service in 1882,Grace Line - Retrieved 2012-04-30 with ports of call between Peru and New York. Regular steamship service was established in 1893, with a subsidiary called the New York & Pacific Steamship Co., that operated under the British flag. Ships built outside the United States prior to 1905 were banned from US registry. US-flag service began in 1912 with the Atlantic and Pacific Steamship Company. The activities of both companies and the parent firm were consolidated into the Grace Steamship Company beginning in 1916. The firm originally specialized in traffic to the west coast of South America; then later expanded into the Caribbean. In 1916, Grace acquired a controlling interest in the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. In 1921, Pacific received five 535 ft. President class ships from the United States Shipping Board for transpacific operation. In 1923, the US Shipping board decided to place the five ships up for bid and Dollar Shipping Company won the bid. With no large ships for the transpacific operations Grace sold the Pacific Mail, its registered name, and goodwill to Dollar. Now without a transpacific service, Grace did not need the six intercoastal freighters and sold them off to the American Hawaiian Line. At this time Grace formed a new entity, the Panama Mail Steamship Company, to operate the smaller ships that were formerly owned and used by the Pacific Mail in the Central American trade. These ships were not involved in the sale to Dollar.Dollar Shipping Company history: cruiselinehistory.com- Retrieved 2012-04-30 On the death of William R.

J. Peter Grace, Jr. took over management of the company after his father suffered a stroke in 1945. After the war the Grace line operated 23 ships totaling 188,000 gross tons, and an additional 14 more on bareboat charters. In 1954 the company bought Davison Chemical Company (founded by William T. Davison as Davison, Kettlewell & Company in 1832), and the Dewey & Almy Chemical Company (founded in 1919 by Bradley Dewey and Charles Almy). In 1960 Grace Line, inspired by the pioneering efforts of Sea-Land Service, Matson Navigation, and Seatrain Lines, sought to begin containerizing its South American cargo operations by converting the conventional freighters Santa Eliana and Santa Leonor into fully cellular container ships. However, the effort was stymied by the opposition of longshoremen in New York and Venezuela and the ships were repeatedly laid up idle and were ultimately sold to the domestic container line Sea-Land Service in 1964.Cudahy, 2006, pp. 70-72, 89-90Levinson, 2006, pp. 67, 130 In 1963 Grace made a second attempt to containerize its South American trade when it ordered the four M-class combination passenger-cargo ships Santa Magdalaena, Santa Maria, Santa Mariana and Santa Mercedes with partial cellular holds, but they were no more successful as mixing conventional break-bulk cargo and containers in the same ship negated the operating economies that full containerization promised.Cudahy, 2006, p. 90 The company bought a 53% stake in Miller Brewing in 1966, for $36 million; Lorraine Mulberger sold the stake for religious reasons.\\"A Deal Between Grandchildren\\" - Time Inc. - Friday, Sep. 30, 1966 It sold the Miller stake in 1969 to Philip Morris for $130 million, topping a deal with PepsiCo for $120 million.\\"The Philip Morris USA Story\\" @ Altria.com\\"Miller Brewing Company: How New Leadership is Changing Corporate Culture\\" Case Study @ Ohio UniversityMiller Brewing Company @ FundingUniverse In 1969 Grace decided to exit the shipping business to concentrate on its chemical and diversification ventures.

The sugar lands were at Paramonga, 110 miles north of Lima, and at Cartavio, near Trujillo, 200 miles farther up coast. Grace retained small mining operations producing copper, tin and silver, in southern Peru, about 100 miles north of Juliaca. Jose E. Flores, head of W. R. Grace S.A.

After acting on stage as an amateur he turned professional in 1879 and, over the next eleven years, he gained experience with leading producers and actor-managers, including Tom Robertson, Henry Irving and Madge and W. H. Kendal. During this time, Alexander became interested in theatre management. In 1890 he took a lease on a London theatre and began producing on his own account. The following year, he moved to the St James's Theatre, where he remained, acting and producing, for the rest of his career. Among the most successful of the new plays he presented were Oscar Wilde's Lady Windermere's Fan (1892), A. W. Pinero's The Second Mrs Tanqueray (1893) and Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest (1895). Alexander followed Robertson and the Kendals in preferring a naturalistic style of writing and acting to the extravagantly theatrical manner favoured by some earlier actor- managers. He built around him a company of fine actors, many of whom were or later became leading figures in the profession, including Henry Ainley, Arthur Bourchier, Constance Collier, Julia Neilson, Fred Terry and Marion Terry. As an actor, Alexander's range was limited, and he did not attempt the great heroic roles or play much tragedy. His genre was naturalistic, and rarely very profound, comedy and drama, in which he was a recognised leader. Life and career  =Early years= Alexander was born in Reading, Berkshire, the eldest son of William Murray Samson (c. 1827‚Äì1892), a Scottish commercial traveller, and his first wife, Mary Ann Hine, n√©e Longman.Wearing, J.

Retrieved 5 February 2019 He was educated at private schools in Clifton, Bristol, and at Ealing, London, and then at Stirling High School, which he left when he was fifteen. His father was strongly opposed to the theatre and intended a commercial career for his eldest son. Alexander was apprenticed as a clerk to a drapery firm in the City of London. In his spare time Alexander began acting in amateur theatricals. On at least two occasions he appeared in amateur performances at the St James's Theatre, with which he was later to be professionally associated. In September 1879, aged 21, he abandoned commerce and became a professional actor, joining a repertory company at the Theatre Royal, Nottingham.\\"Alexander, Sir George, (19 June 1858‚Äì16 March 1918), actor and manager, St James's Theatre\\", Who's Who & Who Was Who, Oxford University Press.

The theatre historian J. P. Wearing writes that Alexander received \\"invaluable training from the acknowledged master of the profession\\", although Irving was not an easy man to work for: With Irving, Alexander visited the US twice, during the decade, in American tours (1884‚Äì1885 and 1887‚Äì1888). In Irving's company he progressed in a series of important supporting roles, such as Shakespeare's Orsino, Laertes, Bassanio and Macduff.\\"The Drama In America\\", The Era, 29 November 1884, p. 17, and 13 December 1885, p. 15 In January 1886, having originally been cast as Valentin in W. G. Wills's Faust, he was promoted to the title role opposite Irving's Mephistopheles.\\"Theatrical Gossip\\", The Era, 14 November 1885, p. 8 Alexander played the part for 384 performances. =Actor-manager= The St James's Theatre in Alexander's time Alexander (right) as Lord Windermere in Lady Windermere's Fan, 1892 Alexander had been nurturing managerial ambitions for some time, and in 1890 he secured a lease of the Avenue Theatre. At the time, he was contractually obliged to remain in the cast of a long-running melodrama called London Day by Day at the Adelphi Theatre, and so was unable to appear in his own first production as a manager. This turned out to be a stroke of good fortune, because the play he mounted as a fill-in until he was able to act in his own productions was a farce, Dr Bill, which was immensely successful, running for seven months and making Alexander financially secure. During the run his Aldephi contract expired and he joined the cast of Dr Bill. When it closed he appeared in the play with which he had planned to open, Alphonse Daudet's Struggle for Life. It was well reviewed but was a box-office failure, and he later commented that if he had been free to open in it at the start of his managerial career, that career would have been in jeopardy. As it was, he was able to carry on even when his manager absconded with the theatre's cash box.Mason, p. 210 At the end of his lease of the Avenue, Alexander obtained that of the St James's, to which he moved in November 1890, and remained there for the rest of his life. Alexander had the theatre newly decorated and electric lighting installed. He opened with a double bill of comedies, Sunlight and Shadow and The Gay Lothario.\\"George Alexander and the St. James's Theatre\\", The Era, 24 June 1899, p. 13 He followed this with The Idler, by Haddon Chambers, a serious drama. It had already been a success in America and ran at the St James's through most of the remainder of the season, which concluded with a costume drama, Moliere, by Walter Frith, in which The Era considered that \\"Mr Alexander was not only good, but at certain moments great\\". When Alexander took over the St James's he had only eleven years' professional experience in the theatre, but Wearing and the chronicler of the theatre A. E. W. Mason both note that he had already reached a firm and enduring managerial policy.Mason, p. 2 He sought to engage the best actors for his company: unlike some star actor-managers he did not wish to be supported by actors whose inferior talent would make the star look better. He did not, in fact, wish to be seen as the star, and regarded himself as a team player. In addition to maintaining a London company, Alexander frequently assembled touring companies to play his successes in the provinces. Among those he engaged for his companies were Arthur Bourchier, Lilian Braithwaite, Constance Collier, Kate Cutler, Julia Neilson, Godfrey Tearle, Fred Terry and Marion Terry.Parker, pp. 97, 103, 187, 225, 887 and 898 Like W. S. Gilbert, the Kendals and Bernard Shaw, Alexander was in favour of the naturalistic style of writing and acting propounded by Robertson.Durbach, Errol. \\"Remembering Tom Robertson (1829-1871)\\", Educational Theatre Journal, October 1972), pp. 284‚Äì288 Other features of his management noted by Wearing were his continual support of British playwrights; his concern for his employees; and his care to avoid alienating his key clientele, the fashionable society audience. The writer Hesketh Pearson commented that Alexander catered to the tastes and foibles of London Society in its theatre-going just as the Savoy Hotel catered to them in restaurant-going.Pearson, p. 74 With Mrs Patrick Campbell in The Second Mrs Tanqueray, 1893 Within a year of taking over the St James's, Alexander began a mutually beneficial professional association with Oscar Wilde, whose Lady Windermere's Fan he presented in February 1892. As with many other of his playwrights, Alexander offered practical advice for making the play more stageable. His most important contribution to this play was to convince the reluctant Wilde that the most effective way of revealing the key plot point ‚Äì that Mrs Erlynne is Lady Windermere's mother ‚Äì would be to do so by degrees rather than in one melodramatic stroke in the final act.Raby, p. 144 Alexander's diplomatic skills enabled him to get on well with even the most temperamental authors and actors, but he was more comfortable with less volatile colleagues. One such was Pinero, whose play The Second Mrs Tanqueray Alexander presented in May 1893. Like Lady Windermere's Fan it featured \\"a woman with a past\\", but unlike Wilde's play it ended in tragedy. It was thought daring at the time, but Alexander knew his audiences and kept to what Pearson called his \\"safe path of correct riskiness\\". It ran for 227 performances in its first production and was later much revived.Mason, p. 63 The title role was first played by Mrs Patrick Campbell, who made her name in the part. His acting style contrasted sharply with hers: she was extrovert and bold, whereas Alexander was understated and subtle. A contemporary profile commented that his range did not extend to parts requiring great dramatic power or tragic passion: \\"He is graceful in all that he does, but with an everyday humanity, the graceful, charming, well-bred, nicely-toned humanity proper to the drawing-rooms of Culture\\".Bright, Addison. \\"George Alexander\\", The Theatre\\", May 1892, p. 240 Between this and the play with which Alexander's name has become most closely associated ‚Äì The Importance of Being Earnest ‚Äì came Alexander's most conspicuous failure. The celebrated novelist Henry James had written a play, Guy Domville, about a hero who renounces the priesthood to save his family by marrying to produce an heir, but finally reverts to his religious calling. The play had been turned down by one London management, but Alexander took it on and opened it at the St James's on 5 January 1895. It was received politely by those in the more expensive parts of the house and impolitely by those in the cheaper seats. The reviews were unenthusiastic; Alexander kept the play on the bill for a month before turning to Wilde as a more theatrically adept writer.Horne, Philip. \\"James, Henry (1843‚Äì1916), writer\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press. Retrieved 5 February 2019 =The Importance of Being Earnest and aftermath= Allan Aynesworth as Algy (left) in the original production of The Importance of Being Earnest (1895) with Alexander as Jack In a biographical essay published in 1922, Pearson expressed the view that Alexander would be remembered in the profession for being an ideal actor- manager, and by the public for taking the risk of introducing Wilde's plays and producing \\"the greatest farcical comedy in the English language\\".Pearson, pp. 75 and 77 Unlike Shaw, who thought The Importance of Being Earnest \\"heartless ... hateful\\" and inferior to Wilde's other plays,Morley, p. 104 Alexander recognised its merits from the outset. He once again advised Wilde about the text; his most important contribution was to convince the author that the second and third acts should be merged, with a substantial cut in the text. The success of the play with audiences and critics was immediate and considerable, but it was short-lived. Within weeks of the premiere Wilde was arrested on a charge of committing homosexual acts and was tried, convicted and imprisoned. The public turned against him, and although Alexander tried to keep the production of the play going by removing the author's name from the playbills the day after the arrest, he had to withdraw the play after 83 performances.\\"The Importance of Being Earnest: The first stage production, 1895\\", Victoria and Albert Museum. Retrieved 7 February 2019 He further disappointed Wilde by declining to stand bail for him, and later, after Wilde's release from prison, failing to stop to talk to him when they passed in the street. Nevertheless he voluntarily paid Wilde a monthly sum for the rest of the latter's life, and bequeathed the rights in Lady Windermere's Fan and The Importance of Being Earnest to Wilde's son, Vyvyan Holland.Morley, pp. 119 and 146‚Äì147 Wearing observes that, later in 1895, Alexander himself was touched by sexual scandal, when he was arrested for soliciting a prostitute. Alexander maintained that the young woman was a beggar to whom he had charitably given a coin, and the case was dismissed.\\"Police\\", The Times, 5 November 1895, p. 13 The play chosen to fill the gap left by the withdrawal of The Importance was The Triumph of the Philistines by Henry Arthur Jones. Alexander had earlier presented Jones's The Masqueraders (1894) with some success, but the new play, a satire of small-town narrow-mindedness, received mixed reviews and quickly closed;\\"The Theatres in 1895\\", The Times, 3 January 1896, p.12 Alexander fell back on revivals, including The Second Mrs Tanqueray (without Mrs Patrick Campbell).\\"St. James's Theatre\\", The Morning Post, 21 June 1895, p. 3 In two productions during 1896 Alexander and his company moved temporarily away from drawing-room comedy and society drama, first with the Ruritanian swashbuckler, The Prisoner of Zenda, which ran for 255 performances; and at the end of the year a rare venture into Shakespeare, in As You Like It, with Alexander as Orlando, Julia Neilson as Rosalind and a supporting cast that included C. Aubrey Smith, Bertram Wallis, H. B. Irving, Robert Loraine and H. V. Esmond.\\"As You Like It\\", The Era, 5 December 1896, p. 13 At the end of 1899 Alexander closed the theatre to have it largely reconstructed, producing what The Era called \\"one of the handsomest temples of the drama in London\\", while retaining its charm and cosiness. =20th century= The young poet Stephen Phillips furnished Alexander with a verse drama, Paolo and Francesca, based on an episode in Dante's The Divine Comedy, produced at the St James's in March 1902. Alexander played the fierce and sombre Giovanni Malatesta, a part far removed from his more usual urbane roles; the young Henry Ainley and Evelyn Millard were well received as the eponymous lovers, and the play ran for 134 performances.\\"St James's Theatre\\", The Times, 7 March 1902, p. 3 In February 1906 Alexander presented and appeared in Pinero's new drama His House in Order, which was an artistic and box-office success, running for 427 performances. Wearing comments that Alexander was a leader of fashion, starting a trend in men's attire by appearing in this play wearing a soft-collared shirt with a lounge suit. Caricature of Alexander by Max Beerbohm, 1909 Alexander had the distinction of giving command performances for three successive British monarchs. Having appeared in Carton's Liberty Hall at Balmoral before Queen Victoria, the final command performance of her reign,Parker, p. 1217 he appeared before Edward VII, as Edward Thursfield in Alfred Sutro's The Builder of Bridges at Sandringham on 4 December 1908.Parker, p. 1218 And on 17 May 1911 in a royal command performance for George V he played Alfred Evelyn in Edward Bulwer- Lytton's Money in an all-star production at the Drury Lane, in which Alexander and Sir Herbert Tree were held to have carried off the honours. Alexander was knighted in 1911 and received an honorary LLD from the University of Bristol the following year. From 1907 to 1913 Alexander represented the South St Pancras division on the London County Council and served conscientiously on several of its committees. If his health had permitted he would, in Wearing's view, have stood for Parliament. He was an astute and capable committee man,Pearson, pp. 79‚Äì81 giving substantial amounts of time to the Actors' Benevolent Fund, the Royal General Theatrical Fund, the Actors' Association and the Actresses' Franchise League. He was a key organiser of the Coronation Gala Performance in 1911 and the Shakespeare tercentenary celebration at Drury Lane in 1916. When the First World War broke out in 1914 Alexander's health was in decline, but as well as continuing to appear at the St James's he worked for charities including the Red Cross, the League of Mercy and the Order of St John of Jerusalem, organising fund-raising performances, f√™tes and garden parties. Alexander died of tuberculosis and diabetes at his country home, Little Court, Chorleywood, Hertfordshire on 16 March 1918, at the age of 59. He was buried there four days later. A memorial service was held at Holy Trinity, Sloane Street, in London on 22 March, attended by a large congregation, mainly comprising the theatrical profession and British society.\\"Sir George Alexander\\", The Times, 3 March 1918, p. 3 A blue plaque unveiled in 1951 commemorates Alexander at his London house, 57 Pont Street, Chelsea.\\"Alexander, Sir George (1858‚Äì1918)\\", English Heritage.

Hungate played on Toto's first four records, including multiple Grammy award-winning album, Toto IV. He left the band shortly after its release for a career as a session musician in Nashville. Hungate, who plays many instruments including guitar, trumpet, drums, and piano, has arranged, produced and recorded with several country artists such as Chet Atkins. He was also a primary member of AOR supergroup Mecca fronted by Joe Vana and Fergie Frederiksen, the latter also of Toto fame. In 1990 he released a solo album entitled \\"Souvenir\\".

In 2005, Czugaj was arrested at Ngurah Rai International Airport in Denpasar with of heroin concealed on his body. After a criminal trial on 14 February 2006 Czugaj was sentenced to life imprisonment. His life sentence was reduced to a term of 20 years on appeal on 26 April 2006, but reinstated five months later. Background Czugaj was an apprentice glazier, keen surfer, one of eight children born to Polish Australian parents. He left his job in March 2005 and told his family that he was going to Cairns for a holiday. Czugaj's parents were quoted as saying he was a \\"problem child\\" but had never been in serious trouble and had no drug history. His father, Steven, said he didn't think he had a passport: :\\"The kid's got no money ... this must have all been arranged, I don't know how or by whom.\\" Following his sentencing, it was revealed that he had earlier led a life of petty crime including train fare evasion, wilful damage, drink-driving and receiving stolen property. It was reported that Czugaj had 14 convictions for offences and was regularly before several Brisbane Magistrates' Courts between 2003 and 2005. Subsequent to the criminal proceedings in Bali, in 2008 Czugaj's older brother, Richard, pleaded guilty to assault and was sentenced to 18 months' jail. Alleged trafficking conspiracy According to media reports, Czugaj claimed that his Brisbane friend, Scott Rush, introduced him to Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen whilst socialising in Brisbane. Nguyen offered them both a free holiday to Bali. Czugaj, aged 18, and Rush, aged 19, arrived in Bali on 8 April 2005 and checked into Hotel Aneka, the same hotel used by Indonesian police for their surveillance. =Arrest in Indonesia= Czugaj was arrested by Indonesian police on 17 April 2005 at Ngurah Rai International Airport in Denpasar, Bali. Heroin weighing was discovered strapped to his legs and chest, concealed underneath his clothing. Rush, Renae Lawrence and Martin Stephens were arrested at the same time as Czugaj. On 20 April 2005, graphic footage of the arrests and subsequent police questioning of Czugaj and other members of the Bali Nine was aired on Australian television. On the same day that Czugaj was arrested, Indonesian police also arrested Si Yi Chen, Nguyen, Myuran Sukumaran and Matthew Norman at the Melasti Hotel in Kuta. Alleged co- ringleader, Andrew Chan was also arrested the same day whilst seated on an Australian Airlines flight waiting to depart Denpasar for Sydney. At the time Chan was arrested, he was carrying three mobile phones and a boarding pass. No drugs were found in his possession. =Criticism of Australian Federal Police tipoff= Lee Rush, the father of Scott Rush, a fellow member of the Bali Nine, said that he contacted the Australian Federal Police (AFP) prior to the commission of the offence, fearing his son was travelling to Bali and would commit a drug-related crime. Rush senior claims then to have received assurances from the AFP that they would tell his son he was under surveillance to dissuade him from going through with the crime before the group's departure from Indonesia. Scott Rush's lawyers said he was never contacted. It was revealed that the AFP alerted Indonesian police that a crime was to be committed approximately two weeks before the arrests, and had commenced an investigation about ten weeks prior to the arrests. When the Bali Nine were arrested, the news of the tipoff became public and there was criticism of the role of the AFP in protecting the interests of Australian citizens. Commenting on the matter at the time, AFP Commissioner Mick Keelty was reported as saying: Rush took action in the Federal Court of Australia against the AFP for breach of the bilateral treaty between Indonesia and Australia when information was handed by the AFP to the Indonesians. Rush's case claimed that such information should only be released by the Attorney-General. However, the Commonwealth Government maintained that the treaty only applies after a suspect is charged. The application was dismissed by the Federal Court in January 2006. Criminal trial Criminal trials for the accused commenced in the Denpasar District Court on 11 October 2005. Chen, Nguyen and Norman were tried together, with Czugaj being one of the remaining six defendants tried separately. Czugaj testified Rush introduced him to Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen in Brisbane, with Nguyen allegedly offering both Czugaj and Rush a free holiday to Bali. Czugaj testified he had never met fellow drug mules Lawrence or Stephens, both of New South Wales, until they were all arrested together at Ngurah Rai International Airport carrying the concealed heroin; however, he had met Chan. During court proceedings, Czugaj at one stage accused one of his interrogators of lying under oath. Czugaj often complained about feeling ill and suffering headaches, and when in pain due to the extraction of a wisdom tooth, Judge I Putu Widnya asked Czugaj to proceed to the judges bench and open his mouth to prove tooth extraction had occurred. Czugaj testified that Chan threatened to kill him and his family if he did not cooperate and participate in the heroin smuggling attempt: =Sentencing and appeal= During his final plea, Czugaj said: On 14 February 2006, Czugaj was sentenced to life imprisonment. Commenting on the sentences at the time, Australian Federal Police Commissioner Mick Keelty stated: The Australian Prime Minister John Howard was reported as commenting: After an appeal for a more lenient sentence, Czugaj's sentence was reduced to 20 years on 26 April 2006; however, this was overturned and the original life sentence reinstated on 6 September 2006. Prison life Czugaj is held in Kerobokan Prison in Bali. He is studying business management. His beautician girlfriend, Lena, has been visiting him for more than three years. His mother, Vicki, visits annually from Brisbane, staying for two weeks at a time.

It is administratively located in the municipality's Musquodoboit Valley & Dutch Settlement planning area and the western edge of the valley includes communities that are considered part of the commutershed for the urban area of the Halifax Regional Municipality. The picturesque Musquodoboit River flows through majority of the valley, passing by most of the communities in the valley. The river is approximately long and originates in the extreme northeastern area of the valley. The three largest communities in the valley are Upper Musquodoboit, Middle Musquodoboit and Musquodoboit Harbour. The word \\"Musquodoboit\\" is derived from the Mi‚Äôkmaq language and means \\"rolling out in foam\\". Geography Musquodoboit River The Musquodoboit Valley region is located within the northeastern reaches of the Halifax Regional Municipality. Entirely rural, the region shares more in common economically with the neighboring rural areas of adjacent Pictou and Colchester counties, as well as the nearby Eastern Shore region, as the economy of the valley relies on forestry and agriculture. The Musquodoboit River bisects the valley, the headwaters of which are at the confluence of the North and South branches of the Musquodoboit River. The drainage area of the river is . The mouth of the river is at Musquodoboit Harbour, which in turn flows into the Atlantic Ocean. History The name of the valley, as well as the name of several communities within it, is derived from the mi'kmaw word Mooskudoboogwek, meaning \\"suddenly widening out after a narrow entrance at its mouth\\".. Musquodoboit is an Anglicized version of the native name. The area of present-day Musquodoboit Harbour was settled in the 1750s by the English. The first land grants around Middle Musquodoboit were given in the 1780s, and the mi'kmaw referred to the place as Natkamkik, meaning \\"the river extends up hill\\". The area was known as Laytonville until sometime after 1883. Gold mining was prevalent in the region in the 20th century, most notably in the community of Moose River Gold Mines. The community was the site of a cave-in disaster in 1936 which received national attention. Economy Middle Musquodoboit Upper Musquodoboit The upper part of the Musquodoboit Valley comprises the largest farming district in the Halifax Regional Municipality. The farms have adapted over time from family-run farms to large commercial scale farms, to adapt to the changing market. Most of the non-farming businesses within the valley are concentrated in Upper Musquodoboit and Middle Musquodoboit. Middle Musquodoboit had a Co-op store, which recently closed, as well as a bakery and restaurant. A fire station is present within the community, as well as a detachment of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The Natural Resources Education Centre is located within the community as well, offering cuuriculum-based programs as well as three kilometres (1.9 mi) of hiking trails. A federal post office and branch of the Royal Bank of Canada are in the community as well. Middle Musquodoboit also hosts the annual Halifax County Exhibition. Upper Musquodoboit has a convenience store, a volunteer fire station, an auto-body shop and a limestone mine. Musquodoboit Valley Memorial Hospital is the only hospital in the Musquodoboit Valley. It is located in Middle Musquodoboit and is on the opposite side of the river to the downtown area. It is adjacent to Braeside Nursing Home. =Education= Three schools are present within the valley region. Musquodoboit Rural High School (MRHS) is the only high school in the Musquodoboit Valley. It has two feeder schools and teaches grades 7-12. Offering an Intensive French program, the building was constructed in 2008. In 2018, there were 270 students enrolled in the school.

Administration  The district is administratively subdivided into five tehsils, which include 34 union councils: * Khuzdar * Moola * Nall * Wadh * Zehri The Union Council for each tehsil is given below: * Khuzdar ‚Äì Baghbana, Balina Khattan, Faizabad, Ferozabad, Gazgi, Khand, Parko, Sasol, Tootak, Zeedi, Zerina Khattan * Moola ‚Äì Abad KarKh, Moola, Sun Chakoo, Kharzan * Nall ‚Äì Durnaili, Goni Gresha, Hazar Ganji, Killi Alam Khan, Kocho, Nal, Ornach, Sar Raij * Wadh ‚Äì Arenji, Badari, Loop, Pesi Kapper, Saroona, Shah Noorani, Wadh, Waheer * Zehri ‚Äì Chashma, Ghat, Noorgama Zehri Source: (Local Government, Balochistan, 2005) Demography The population in 1998 was , % of which was urban. In 2012 it was estimated to be over 925,000. % are Muslim. The majority of the population is made up of Brahui-speaking tribes, and according to the 1981 census Brahui was the first language in 82% of households, followed by Balochi with 13%.These figures are for the combined population of Khuzdar and Wadh subdivisions and excludes the Awaran subdivision . In the 1998 census, which did not gather data for Brahui, 96.7% of the population reported their language as Balochi, and % ‚Äì as Punjabi.  Education  According to the Pakistan District Education Rankings 2017, district Khuzdar is ranked at number 122 out of the 141 ranked districts in Pakistan on the education score index. This index considers learning, gender parity and retention in the district. Literacy rate in 2014‚Äì15 of population 10 years and older in the district stands at 45% whereas for females it is only 26%.Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (2016). Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement Survey 2014-15. [online] Islamabad: Government of Pakistan, p.111. Available at: http://www.pbs.gov.pk/sites/default/files//pslm/publications/PSLM_2014-15_National- Provincial-District_report.pdf [Accessed 6 Aug. 2018]. Post primary access is a major issue in the district with 87% schools being at primary level. Compare this with high schools which constitute only 5% of government schools in the district. This is also reflected in the enrolment figures for 2016‚Äì17 with 23,848 students enrolled in class 1 to 5 and only 698 students enrolled in class 9 and 10. Gender disparity is another issue in the district. Only 30% schools in the district are girls‚Äô schools. Access to education for girls is a major issue in the district and is also reflected in the low literacy rates for females. Moreover, the schools in the district lack basic facilities. According to Alif Ailaan district education rankings 2017, the district is ranked at number 127 out of the 155 districts of Pakistan for primary school infrastructure. At the middle school level, it is ranked at number 133 out of the 155 districts. These rankings take into account the basic facilities available in schools including drinking water, working toilet, availability of electricity, existence of a boundary wall and general building condition. More than 4 out of 5 schools do not have electricity in them. 1 out 3 schools lack a toilet and 1 out of 2 do not have a boundary wall. 1 out of 3 schools do not have clean drinking water.

Physical characteristics  = Rotation period = In September 2006, a rotational lightcurve for Palach was obtained from photometric observations made by French amateur astronomer Laurent Bernasconi at St. Michel sur Meu. It gave a rotation period of 3.139 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.16 magnitude ().

The main source of information on Cynaethus is a Scholium to Pindar's second Nemean ode.This is found, with slightly different readings, in the Scholia Vetera in Pindari Carmina (ed. Drachmann), Nemean 2, scholium 1c, and in Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum (ed. M√ºller) 4.433, Hippostratus frag. #4. The scholium was picked up without reference to the Hymn in the 'modern commentaries' of Thomas Magister and Demetrius Triclinius, Scholia Recentiora Thomano-Tricliniana in Pindari Nemea et Isthmia (ed. Mommsen) #2. This tells us that the school of Cynaethus was prominent among the Homeridae and put out many of their own compositions under Homer's name, Cynaethus himself composing the Hymn. He was the first to recite the Homeric poems at Syracuse, which he did during the 69th Olympiad (504-501 BC). It was once argued that the dating made no sense because the Homeric poems must have reached Syracuse much earlier.Therefore, in the 19th century Welcker (Epischer Cyclus, p. 243) proposed reading ¬´Œ∫Œ±œÑ·Ω∞ œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ ·ºïŒ∫œÑŒ∑ŒΩ ·º¢ œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ ·ºêŒΩŒΩŒ¨œÑŒ∑ŒΩ ·ΩàŒªœÖŒºœÄŒπŒ¨Œ¥Œ±¬ª (\\"during the sixth or the ninth Olympiad\\"), instead of ¬´Œ∫Œ±œÑ·Ω∞ œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ ·ºëŒæŒ∑Œ∫ŒøœÉœÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ ·ºêŒΩŒΩŒ¨œÑŒ∑ŒΩ ·ΩàŒª.¬ª (\\"during the sixty-ninth Olympiad\\"), and dating Cynaethus to about 750 BC. However, the original date corresponds well to a probable date of composition of the Homeric Hymn to Apollo, 522 BC.

It was discovered on 26 October 1971, by Czech astronomer Lubo≈° Kohoutek at the Bergedorf Observatory in Hamburg, Germany. The S-type asteroid has a rotation period of 4.8 hours and is likely elongated in shape. It was later named after 15th- century theologian Jan Hus.  Orbit and classification  Hus is a core member of the Koronis family (), a very large asteroid family of almost 6,000 known asteroids with nearly co-planar ecliptical orbits. It orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.9‚Äì3.0 AU once every 5 years (1,821 days; semi-major axis of 2.92 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.02 and an inclination of 2¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. Hus was first observed as at the Lowell Observatory in October 1931. The body's observation arc begins with its observation as at the Goethe Link Observatory in January 1953, more than 18 years prior to its official discovery observation at Hamburg.  Naming  This minor planet was named after Czech Jan Hus (1372‚Äì1415), a fifteenth century Bohemian theologian, rector of Charles University in Prague and forerunner of the protestant reformation. He was condemned to death by the Council of Constance and burned at the stake for his reformation ideas. Jan Hus is also known as John Huss in the English speaking world. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 20 December 1974 ().  Physical characteristics  Based on the asteroid's membership to the Koronis family and its relatively high geometric albedo determined by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), Hus is very likely a stony S-type asteroid. = Rotation period and pole = In June 2006, a rotational lightcurve of Hus was obtained from photometric observations taken by Maurice Clark at the Chiro Observatory in Western Australia. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of hours with a high brightness variation of 0.85 magnitude (), strongly indicative of an elongated, non-spherical shape. In March 2016, a synthetic lightcurve gave a similar period of hours, using sparse-in-time photometry data from the Lowell Photometric Database (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by NASA's WISE telescope with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Hus measures 12.4 and 12.6 kilometers in diameter, and its surface has an albedo of 0.261 and 0.255, respectively. Conversely, the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for carbonaceous asteroids of 0.057, rather than one for a stony body, as indicated by WISE/NEOWISE ‚Äì and calculates therefore a twice as large diameter of 25.4 kilometers, as the lower the albedo, the larger the body's diameter for a constant absolute magnitude.

The town is situated 110 km from Kuala Lumpur and 265 km from Pahang's capital, Kuantan. Raub is one of the oldest towns in Pahang. History Raub was explored and founded in the 18th century. It is historically a gold mining settlement, and the gold mining industry is now undergoing something of a resurgence as the gold price has risen. According to the history, this mining centre was named Raub after a group of miners found a handful of gold in every tray of sand they dig. This is described by J.A. Richardson in his book, The Geology and Mineral Resources of the Neighbourhood of Raub Pahang. According to him (page 36), \\"People found that for every \\"dulang\\" of sand there was a handful (raub) of gold\\". The old folks' tale recounts that in the early 19th century, an old man and his two sons discovered gold every time they scooped up the earth in Raub. Thus, the town and the district derived their name from the Malay word raub which means \\"scoop\\". Raub became famous in the early 20th century for its mining resource (gold). Then, gold mining in Raub was operated by Raub Australian Gold Mine (RAGM), a company registered in 1889 in Queensland, Australia. The company was initially known as Australian Syndicate Ltd and later as Australian Gold Mining Co. Ltd in 1892. RAGM operated until 1961. The mining method used in Raub is shaft mining and started at the Raub Hole. This area is now known as Bukit Koman. The mining activity became a valuable heritage for Raub district. The main road in Raub Bibby Road, was named after the company's first manager, William Bibby. Mason Road was named after the first district officer J S Mason. Bukit Koman was once dubbed \\"Malaysian capital of gold\\" as the result of rapid development of gold mining. A new company, Peninsular Gold, has restarted gold mining at the Raub mine. Initially, the company recovered gold from the tailings dumps from the old mine, but started mining fresh ore again in 2011. A major drilling campaign is in progress, exploring additional resources adjacent and below the old mine. Communist threat in the 1940s in Raub resulted in the erection of new settlements. Among them are Cheroh (1948), Sang Lee (1948), Sungai Ruan (1948), Sungai Chetang (1948), Bukit Koman (1949), Sempalit (1950), Sungai Lui (1950), Tras (1950) and Sungai Klau (1960). There are a lot of British style buildings in Raub, especially along Mason Road (now known as Jalan Tengku Abdullah). Most of the buildings in Raub were built during the pre-World War II era. The Police Station of Raub is probably one of the oldest buildings in Malaysia, it was built in 1905. Economy After the gold mines were depleted, the main economic activity of Raub is agriculture. Main commodity crops in Raub are natural rubber, oil palm, cocoa and local fruits, like durians. Durians grown in Raub are probably the best in Malaysia. The town is styled as the \\"durian capital of Malaysia\\" attracting a steady stream of visitors, especially tourists from Singapore and China.  Government and administration  Map of Raub District Council. Raub is administered by the Raub District Council; its president is Haji Khairulanuar bin Mahmood. Raub has its own constituency in the Dewan Rakyat of the Malaysian Parliament. The incumbent MP is Ariff Sabri Abdul Aziz of the DAP. In turn, Raub delivers three seats to the Pahang State Legislative Assembly, comprising Batu Talam, Tras and Dong. Raub is the only place in western Pahang (Raub, Bentong and Kuala Lipis) that has state and federal- level administrative offices. There is a landmark building, situated next to Taman Bukit Koman (not to be confused with Kampung Bukit Koman), which contains most of the administrative offices, called Bangunan Gunasama Persekutuan. Inside Bangunan Gunasama Persekutuan, there are District Immigration Department, National Registry Department (District Branch) Office and other important offices in that building also. Besides that, there is Land Office which is on top of a hill, beside Taman Shahbandar, provides opportunity to renew their land title and land grant, unlike Bentong, they need to come to Raub to renew their land title. Actually, the existence of those administrative offices has its roots. During the early 20th century, because of massive gold mining activity, Raub was quickly developed and at once, it was tipped as the future administrative state capital for Pahang. However, at the last minute, Residence of Pahang decided to shift state administrative capital to Kuantan and left out Raub. Although Raub did not become state capital, however, British left a lot of administrative buildings in Raub, including the Resident's official residence (the present Raub District Officer's official residence) was situated in Raub. Transport =Car= Highway is the main route to Raub. Motorists from Kuala Lumpur will usually exit the LPT at Bentong and then enter highway to get to Raub or Kuala Lipis. Raub is also a stopover for motorists travelling to Kota Bharu, which is the northern end of highway 8. Raub is the eastern end of Route , which begins in Kuala Kubu Bharu in Selangor and passing through Fraser's Hill in the process. As a result, Route is an alternative to the Karak Highway for Selangor/Kuala Lumpur/Klang Valley motorists. Raub is also a gateway to the hill resort of Cameron Highlands, using Pahang State Route . =Public transport= Currently rapidKuantan does not serve Raub as well as most of western Pahang. Instead, buses in Raub are operated by several companies which include Pahang Lin Siong, Union and Central Pahang. The latter two merged a few years ago and has been operating as a single entity by the name of Union since. Besides these local companies, other interstate express coaches also stop by Raub central bus station as the town is strategically located along routes to cities like Gua Musang and Kota Bharu in the eastern states of Peninsular Malaysia. Raub is also not served by the KTM Intercity, given its mountainous terrain. The closest station will be Kuala Lipis.

Issued by President Barack Obama in 2009, Executive Order 13526 replaced earlier executive orders on the topic and modified the regulations codified to 32 C.F.R. 2001. It lays out the system of classification, declassification, and handling of national security information generated by the U.S. government and its employees and contractors, as well as information received from other governments. The desired degree of secrecy about such information is known as its sensitivity. Sensitivity is based upon a calculation of the damage to national security that the release of the information would cause. The United States has three levels of classification: Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret. Each level of classification indicates an increasing degree of sensitivity. Thus, if one holds a Top Secret security clearance, one is allowed to handle information up to the level of Top Secret, including Secret and Confidential information. If one holds a Secret clearance, one may not then handle Top Secret information, but may handle Secret and Confidential classified information. The United States does not have a British-style Official Secrets Act; instead, several laws protect classified information, including the Espionage Act of 1917, the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982. A 2013 report to Congress noted that the relevant laws have been mostly used to prosecute foreign agents, or those passing classified information to them, and that leaks to the press have rarely been prosecuted. The legislative and executive branches of government, including US presidents, have frequently leaked classified information to journalists.Stansfield Turner, Burn Before Reading, 2006The Deadly Bet, Walter LaFaberSeeds of Terror, Gretchen PetersClassified Information in \\"Obama's Wars\\", September 29, 2010, Jack Goldsmith, Lawfare, via stephenkim.org Congress has repeatedly resisted or failed to pass a law that generally outlaws disclosing classified information. Most espionage law criminalizes only national defense information; only a jury can decide if a given document meets that criterion, and judges have repeatedly said that being \\"classified\\" does not necessarily make information become related to the \\"national defense\\".Judge T.S. Ellis III, reduction of Franklin sentence hearing, 2009 Furthermore, by law, information may not be classified merely because it would be embarrassing or to cover illegal activity; information may be classified only to protect national security objectives. The United States over the past decades under the Obama and Clinton administrations has released classified information to foreign governments for diplomatic goodwill, known as declassification diplomacy. Examples include information on Augusto Pinochet to the government of Chile. In October 2015, US Secretary of State John Kerry provided Michelle Bachelet, Chile's president, with a pen drive containing hundreds of newly declassified documents. Terminology Derivative classification activity 1996‚Äì2011 In the U.S., information is called \\"classified\\" if it has been assigned one of the three levels: Confidential, Secret, or Top Secret. Information that is not so labeled is called \\"Unclassified information\\". The term declassified is used for information that has had its classification removed, and downgraded refers to information that has been assigned a lower classification level but is still classified. Many documents are automatically downgraded and then declassified after some number of years. The U.S. government uses the terms Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU), Sensitive Security Information (SSI), Critical Program Information (CPI), For Official Use Only (FOUO), or Law Enforcement Sensitive (LES) to refer to information that is not Confidential, Secret, or Top Secret, but whose dissemination is still restricted. Reasons for such restrictions can include export controls, privacy regulations, court orders, and ongoing criminal investigations, as well as national security. Information that was never classified is sometimes referred to as \\"open source\\" by those who work in classified activities. Public Safety Sensitive (PSS) refers to information that is similar to Law Enforcement Sensitive but could be shared between the various public safety disciplines (Law Enforcement, Fire, and Emergency Medical Services). Peter Louis Galison, a historian and Director in the History of Science Dept. at Harvard University, claims that the U.S. Government produces more classified information than unclassified information.Department of the History of Science, Harvard University Levels of classification used by the U.S. government The United States government classifies information according to the degree which the unauthorized disclosure would damage national security. Having Top Secret clearance does not allow one to view all Top Secret documents. The user of the information must possess the clearance necessary for the sensitivity of the information, as well as a legitimate need to obtain the information. For example, all US military pilots are required to obtain at least a Secret clearance, but they may only access documents directly related to their orders. Secret information might have additional access controls that could prevent someone with a Top Secret clearance from seeing it. Since all federal departments are part of the Executive Branch, the classification system is governed by Executive Order rather than by law. Typically each president will issue a new executive order, either tightening classification or loosening it. The Clinton administration made a major change in the classification system by issuing an executive order that for the first time required all classified documents to be declassified after 25 years unless they were reviewed by the agency that created the information and determined to require continuing classification.EXECUTIVE ORDER 12958 https://fas.org/sgp/clinton/eo12958.html =Restricted Data/Formerly Restricted Data= Restricted Data and Formerly Restricted Data are classification markings that concern nuclear information. These are the only two classifications that are established by federal law, being defined by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. Nuclear information is not automatically declassified after 25 years. Documents with nuclear information covered under the Atomic Energy Act will be marked with a classification level (confidential, secret or top secret) and a restricted data or formerly restricted data marking. Nuclear information as specified in the act may inadvertently appear in unclassified documents and must be reclassified when discovered. Even documents created by private individuals have been seized for containing nuclear information and classified. Only the Department of Energy may declassify nuclear information.CLASSIFICATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS-RELATED INFORMATION, http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/hss/Classification/docs/CTI- Training-RD-FRD-Briefing.pdf =Code Word classifications= Top Secret is the highest level of classification. However some information is compartmentalized by adding a code word so that only those who have been cleared for each code word can see it. This information is also known as \\"Sensitive Compartmented Information\\" (SCI). A document marked SECRET (CODE WORD) could be viewed only by a person with a secret or top secret clearance and that specific code word clearance.

Information is classified Secret when its unauthorized disclosure would cause \\"serious damage\\" to national security. Most information that is classified is held at the secret sensitivity. =Confidential= This is the lowest classification level of information obtained by the government. It is defined as information that would \\"damage\\" national security if publicly disclosed, again, without the proper authorization. For \\"C\\" and \\"(C)\\" designations, see also: Joint Electronics Type Designation System#Parenthetical C. =Public Trust= Despite common misconception, a public trust position is not a security clearance, and is not the same as the confidential clearance. Certain positions which require access to sensitive information, but not information which is classified, must obtain this designation through a background check. Public Trust Positions can either be moderate-risk or high-risk. =Unclassified= Unclassified is not technically a classification; this is the default and refers to information that can be released to individuals without a clearance. Information that is unclassified is sometimes restricted in its dissemination as Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) or For Official Use Only (FOUO). For example, the law enforcement bulletins reported by the U.S. media when the United States Department of Homeland Security raised the U.S. terror threat level were usually classified as \\"U//LES\\", or \\"Unclassified ‚Äì Law Enforcement Sensitive\\". This information is supposed to be released only to law enforcement agencies (sheriff, police, etc.), but, because the information is unclassified, it is sometimes released to the public as well. Information that is unclassified but which the government does not believe should be subject to Freedom of Information Act requests is often classified as U//FOUO‚Äî\\"Unclassified‚ÄîFor Official Use Only\\". In addition to FOUO information, information can be categorized according to its availability to be distributed (e.g., Distribution D may only be released to approved Department of Defense and U.S. Department of Defense contractor personnelU.S. Department of Defense Directive DoDD 5230.24, March 18, 1987). Also, the statement of NOFORN (meaning \\"no foreign nationals\\") is applied to any information that may not be released to any non-U.S. citizen. NOFORN and distribution statements are often used in conjunction with classified information or alone on SBU information. Documents subject to export controls have a specific warning to that effect. Information which is \\"personally identifiable\\" is governed by the Privacy Act of 1974 and is also subject to strict controls regardless of its level of classification. Finally, information at one level of classification may be \\"upgraded by aggregation\\" to a higher level. For example, a specific technical capability of a weapons system might be classified Secret, but the aggregation of all technical capabilities of the system into a single document could be deemed Top Secret. Use of information restrictions outside the classification system is growing in the U.S. government. In September 2005 J. William Leonard, director of the U.S. National Archives Information Security Oversight Office, was quoted in the press as saying, \\"No one individual in government can identify all the controlled, unclassified [categories], let alone describe their rules.\\"Michael J. Sniffen, \\"Report: Gov't Secrecy Grows, Costs More\\", Associated Press, September 5, 2005 . Retrieved December 15, 2006. Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) One of the 9/11 Commission findings was that \\"the government keeps too many secrets.\\" To address this problem, the Commission recommended that '[t]he culture of agencies feeling they own the information they gathered at taxpayer expense must be replaced by a culture in which the agencies instead feel they have a duty ... to repay the taxpayers' investment by making that information available.'\\" Due to over 100 designations in use by the U.S. government for unclassified information at the time, President George W. Bush issued a Presidential memorandum on May 9, 2008, in an attempt to consolidate the various designations in use into a new category known as Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI). The CUI categories and subcategories were hoped to serve as the exclusive designations for identifying unclassified information throughout the executive branch not covered by Executive Order 12958 or the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (as amended) but still required safeguarding or dissemination controls, pursuant to and consistent with any applicable laws, regulations, and government-wide policies in place at the time. CUI would replace categories such as For Official Use Only (FOUO), Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) and Law Enforcement Sensitive (LES). The Presidential memorandum also designated the National Archives as responsible for overseeing and managing the implementation of the new CUI framework. This memorandum has since been rescinded by Executive Order 13556 of November 4, 2010 and the guidelines previously outlined within the memo were expanded upon in a further attempt to improve the management of information across all federal agencies as well as establish a more standard, government-wide program regarding the controlled unclassification designation process itself.Executive Order 13556 of November 4, 2010, Controlled Unclassified Information, Federal Register - U.S. National Archives and Records Administration, Vol. 75, No. 216, November 9, 2010, p. 68675. The U.S. Congress has attempted to take steps to resolve this, but did not succeed. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the Reducing Information Control Designations Act on March 17, 2009. The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Because no action was taken in committee and bills expire at the end of every Congress, there is currently no bill to solve unclassified designations. =Restricted= During and before World War II, the U.S. had a category of classified information called Restricted, which was below confidential. The U.S. no longer has a Restricted classification, but many other nations and NATO do. The U.S. treats Restricted information it receives from other governments as Confidential. The U.S. does use the term restricted data in a completely different way to refer to nuclear secrets, as described above. =Classified classifications= Executive Order 13526, which forms the legal basis for the U.S. classification system, states that \\"information may be classified at one of the following three levels\\", with Top Secret as the highest level (Sec. 1.2). However, this executive order provides for special access programs that further restricted access to a small number of individuals and permit additional security measures (Sec. 4.3). These practices can be compared with (and may have inspired) the concepts multilevel security and role-based access control. U.S. law also has special provisions protecting information related to cryptography (18 USC 798), nuclear weapons and atomic energy (see Controls on atomic-energy information) and the identity of covert intelligence agents (see Intelligence Identities Protection Act). Proper procedure for classifying U.S. government documents To be properly classified, a classification authority (an individual charged by the U.S. government with the right and responsibility to properly determine the level of classification and the reason for classification) must determine the appropriate classification level, as well as the reason information is to be classified. A determination must be made as to how and when the document will be declassified, and the document marked accordingly. Executive Order 13526 describes the reasons and requirements for information to be classified and declassified (Part 1). Individual agencies within the government develop guidelines for what information is classified and at what level. The former decision is original classification. A great majority of classified documents are created by derivative classification. For example, if one piece of information, taken from a secret document, is put into a document along with 100 pages of unclassified information, the document, as a whole, will be secret. Proper rules stipulate that every paragraph will bear a classification marking of (U) for Unclassified, (C) for Confidential, (S) for Secret, and (TS) for Top Secret. Therefore, in this example, only one paragraph will have the (S) marking. If the page containing that paragraph is double-sided, the page should be marked SECRET on top and bottom of both sides. A review of classification policies by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence aimed at developing a uniform classification policy and a single classification guide that could be used by the entire U.S. intelligence community found significant interagency differences that impaired cooperation and performance. The initial ODNI review, completed in January 2008, said in part, \\"The definitions of 'national security' and what constitutes 'intelligence'‚Äîand thus what must be classified‚Äîare unclear. ... Many interpretations exist concerning what constitutes harm or the degree of harm that might result from improper disclosure of the information, often leading to inconsistent or contradictory guidelines from different agencies. ... There appears to be no common understanding of classification levels among the classification guides reviewed by the team, nor any consistent guidance as to what constitutes 'damage,' 'serious damage,' or 'exceptionally grave damage' to national security. ... There is wide variance in application of classification levels.\\" The review recommended that original classification authorities should specify clearly the basis for classifying information, for example, whether the sensitivity derives from the actual content of the information, the source, the method by which it was analyzed, or the date or location of its acquisition. Current policy requires that the classifier be \\"able\\" to describe the basis for classification but not that he or she in fact do so. =Classification categories= Step 3 in the classification process is to assign a reason for the classification. Classification categories are marked by the number \\"1.4\\" followed by one or more letters (a) to (h): * 1.4(a) military plans, weapons systems, or operations; * 1.4(b) foreign government information; * 1.4(c) intelligence activities, sources, or methods, or cryptology; * 1.4(d) foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States, including confidential sources; * 1.4(e) scientific, technological or economic matters relating to national security; which includes defense against transnational terrorism; * 1.4(f) United States Government programs for safeguarding nuclear materials or facilities; * 1.4(g) vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations, infrastructures, projects or plans, or protection services relating to the national security, which includes defense against transnational terrorism; and/or * 1.4(h) the development, production, or use of weapons of mass destruction. Classifying non-government-generated information The Invention Secrecy Act of 1951 allows the suppression of patents (for a limited time) for inventions that threaten national security. Whether information related to nuclear weapons can constitutionally be \\"born secret\\" as provided for by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 has not been tested in the courts. Guantanamo Bay detention camp has used a \\"presumptive classification\\" system to describe the statements of Guantanamo Bay detainees as classified. When challenged by Ammar al-Baluchi in the Guantanamo military commission hearing the 9/11 case, the prosecution abandoned the practice. Presumptive classification continues in the cases involving the habeas corpus petitions of Guantanamo Bay detainees. Protecting classified information GSA-approved security container =Facilities and handling= One of the reasons for classifying state secrets into sensitivity levels is to tailor the risk to the level of protection. The U.S. government specifies in some detail the procedures for protecting classified information. The rooms or buildings for holding and handling classified material must have a facility clearance at the same level as the most sensitive material to be handled. Good quality commercial physical security standards generally suffice for lower levels of classification; at the highest levels, people sometimes must work in rooms designed like bank vaults (see Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility ‚Äì SCIF). The U.S. Congress has such facilities inside the Capitol Building, among other Congressional handling procedures for protecting confidentiality. The U.S. General Services Administration sets standards for locks and containers used to store classified material. The most commonly-approved security containers resemble heavy-duty file cabinets with a combination lock in the middle of one drawer. In response to advances in methods to defeat mechanical combination locks, the U.S. government switched to electromechanical locks that limit the rate of attempts to unlock them. After a specific number of failed attempts, they will permanently lock, requiring a locksmith to reset them. Classified U.S. government documents typically must be stamped with their classification on the cover and at the top and bottom of each page. Authors must mark each paragraph, title and caption in a document with the highest level of information it contains, usually by placing appropriate initials in parentheses at the beginning of the paragraph, title, or caption. Commonly, one must affix a brightly colored cover sheet to the cover of each classified document to prevent unauthorized observation of classified material (shoulder surfing) and to remind users to lock up unattended documents. The most sensitive material requires two-person integrity, where two cleared individuals are responsible for the material at all times. Approved containers for such material have two separate combination locks, both of which must be opened to access the contents. Restrictions dictate shipment methods for classified documents. Top Secret material must go by special courier; Secret material within the U.S. via registered mail; and, Confidential material by certified mail. Electronic transmission of classified information largely requires the use of National Security Agency approved/certified \\"Type 1\\" cryptosystems using NSA's unpublished and classified Suite A algorithms. The classification of the Suite A algorithms categorizes the hardware that store them as a Controlled Cryptographic Item (CCI) under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR. CCI equipment and keying material must be controlled and stored with heightened physical security, even when the device is not processing classified information or contains no cryptographic key. NSA is currently implementing what it's calling Suite B which is a group of commercial algorithms such as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA), Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) and Elliptic curve Diffie‚ÄìHellman (ECDH). Suite B provides protection for data up to Top Secret on non-CCI devices, which is especially useful in high risk environments or operations needed to prevent Suite A compromise. These less stringent hardware requirements stem from the device not having to \\"protect\\" classified Suite A algorithms. Specialized computer operating systems known as trusted operating systems are available for processing classified information. These systems enforce the classification and labeling rules described above in software. Since 2005, however, they are not considered secure enough to allow uncleared users to share computers with classified activities. Thus, if one creates an unclassified document on a secret device, the resultant data is classified secret until it can be manually reviewed. Computer networks for sharing classified information are segregated by the highest sensitivity level they are allowed to transmit, for example, SIPRNet (Secret) and JWICS (Top Secret- SCI). The destruction of certain types of classified documents requires burning, shredding, pulping or pulverizing using approved procedures and must be witnessed and logged. Classified computer data presents special problems. See Data remanence. =Lifetime commitment= When a cleared individual leaves the job or employer for which they were granted access to classified information, they are formally debriefed from the program. Debriefing is an administrative process that accomplishes two main goals: it creates a formal record that the individual no longer has access to the classified information for that program; and it reminds the individual of their lifetime commitment to protect that information. Typically, the individual is asked to sign another non-disclosure agreement (NDA), similar to that which they signed when initially briefed, and this document serves as the formal record. The debriefed individual does not lose their security clearance; they have only surrendered the need to know for information related to that particular job. Classifications and clearances between U.S. government agencies Senator Barry Goldwater reprimanding CIA director William J. Casey for Secret info showing up in The New York Times, but then saying it was over-classified to begin with. 1983 In the past, clearances did not necessarily transfer between various U.S. government agencies. For example, an individual cleared for Department of Defense Top Secret had to undergo another investigation before being granted a Department of Energy Q clearance. Agencies are now supposed to honor background investigations by other agencies if they are still current. Because most security clearances only apply inside the agency where the holder works, if one needs to meet with another agency to discuss classified matters, it is possible and necessary to pass one's clearance to the other agency. For example, officials visiting at the White House from other government agencies would pass their clearances to the Executive Office of the President (EOP). The Department of Energy security clearance required to access Top Secret Restricted Data, Formerly Restricted Data, and National Security Information, as well as Secret Restricted Data, is a Q clearance. The lower-level L clearance is sufficient for access to Secret Formerly Restricted Data and National Security Information, as well as Confidential Restricted Data and Formerly Restricted Data.Los Alamos National Laboratory, Clearance Processing . Retrieved December 15, 2006. In practice, access to Restricted Data is granted, on a need-to-know basis, to personnel with appropriate clearances. At one time, a person might hold both a TS and a Q clearance, but that duplication and cost is no longer required. For all practical purposes, Q is equivalent to Top Secret, and L is equivalent to Secret. Contrary to popular lore, the Yankee White clearance given to personnel who work directly with the President is not a classification. Individuals having Yankee White clearances undergo extensive background investigations. The criteria include U.S. citizenship, unquestionable loyalty, and an absolute absence of any foreign influence over the individual, his family, or \\"persons to whom the individual is closely linked\\".The Football, GlobalSecurity.orgSelection of DoD Military and Civilian Personnel and Contractor Employees for Assignment to Presidential Support Activities (PSAs), Department of Defense Instruction No. 5210.87 (November 30, 1998). Also, they must not have traveled (save while in government employ and at the instructions of the United States) to countries that are considered to be unfriendly to the United States. Yankee White cleared personnel are granted access to any information for which they have a need to know, regardless of which organization classified it or at what level. See also the Single Scope Background Investigation below, along with explicit compartmented access indoctrination. Some compartments, especially intelligence-related, may require a polygraph examination, although the reliability of the polygraph is controversial. The NSA uses the polygraph early in the clearance process while the CIA uses it at the end, which may suggest divergent opinions on the proper use of the polygraph. Standard form 312 Standard Form 312 (SF 312) is a non-disclosure agreement required under Executive Order 13292 to be signed by employees of the U.S. Federal Government or one of its contractors when they are granted a security clearance for access to classified information. The form is issued by the Information Security Oversight Office of the National Archives and Records Administration and its title is \\"Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement.\\" SF 312 prohibits confirming or repeating classified information to unauthorized individuals, even if that information is already leaked. The SF 312 replaces the earlier forms SF 189 or the SF 189-A. Enforcement of SF-312 is limited to civil actions to enjoin disclosure or seek monetary damages and administrative sanctions, \\"including reprimand, suspension, demotion or removal, in addition to the likely loss of the security clearance.\\"*Standard Form 312 *SF 312 briefing booklet *Information Security Oversight Office (ISOO) Categories that are not classifications Compartments also exist, that employ code words pertaining to specific projects and are used to more easily manage individual access requirements. Code words are not levels of classification themselves, but a person working on a project may have the code word for that project added to his file, and then will be given access to the relevant documents. Code words may also label the sources of various documents; for example, code words are used to indicate that a document may break the cover of intelligence operatives if its content becomes known. The WWII code word Ultra identified information found by decrypting German ciphers, such as the Enigma machine, and which‚Äîregardless of its own significance‚Äîmight inform the Germans that Enigma was broken if they became aware that it was known. =Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) and Special Access Programs (SAP)= The terms \\"Sensitive Compartmented Information\\" (SCI) and \\"Special Access Program\\" (SAP) are widely misunderstood as classification levels or specific clearances. In fact, the terms refer to methods of handling certain types of classified information that relate to specific national-security topics or programs (whose existence may not be publicly acknowledged) or the sensitive nature of which requires special handling, and thereby those accessing it require special approval to access it. The paradigms for these two categories, SCI originating in the intelligence community and SAP in the Department of Defense, formalize 'Need to Know' and addresses two key logistical issues encountered in the day-to-day control of classified information: :* Individuals with a legitimate need to know may not be able to function effectively without knowing certain facts about their work. However, granting all such individuals a blanket DoD clearance (often known as a \\"collateral\\" clearance) at the Top Secret level would be undesirable, not to mention prohibitively expensive. :* The government may wish to limit certain types of sensitive information only to those who work directly on related programs, regardless of the collateral clearance they hold. Thus, even someone with a Top Secret clearance cannot gain access to its Confidential information unless it is specifically granted. To be clear, \\"collateral\\" simply means one lacks special access (e.g. SCI, SAP, COMSEC, NATO, etc.). Confidential, Secret, and Top Secret are all, by themselves, collateral clearances. SAP and SCI are usually found at the Top Secret classification, but there is no prohibition of applying such segregation to Confidential and Secret information.http://www.nicoe.capmed.mil/About%20Us/Shared%20Documents/security_clearance_faq.pdf SAP and SCI implementation are roughly equivalent, and it is reasonable to discuss their implementation as one topic. For example, SAP material needs to be stored and used in a facility much like the SCIF described below. Department of Energy information, especially the more sensitive SIGMA categories, may be treated as SAP or SCI. Access to compartmented information Personnel who require knowledge of SCI or SAP information fall into two general categories: * Persons with a need to know * Persons with actual access Access to classified information is not authorized based on clearance status. Access is only permitted to individuals after determining they have a need to know. Need-to-know is a determination that an individual requires access to specific classified information in the performance of (or assist in the performance of) lawful and authorized government functions and duties. To achieve selective separation of program information while still allowing full access to those working on the program, a separate compartment, identified by a unique codeword, is created for the information. This entails establishing communication channels, data storage, and work locations (SCIF‚ÄîSensitive Compartmented Information Facility), which are physically and logically separated not only from the unclassified world, but from general Department of Defense classified channels as well. Thus established, all information generated within the compartment is classified according to the general rules above. However, to emphasize that the information is compartmented, all documents are marked with both the classification level and the codeword (and the caveat \\"Handle via Channels Only\\", or \\"Handle via Jointly\\" if the document contains material from multiple programs). BYEMAN control system Examples of such SCI control systems are:Top Level Telecommunications, The US Classification System * COMINT or Special Intelligence (SI) * ENDSEAL (EL) * TALENT KEYHOLE (TK) * HUMINT Control System (HCS) * KLONDIKE (KDK) * RESERVE (RSV) * BYEMAN (BYE or B) The COMINT control system is for sensitive signals intelligence information and contains several compartments, like: * Very Restricted Knowledge (VRK) * Exceptionally Controlled Information (ECI), which was used to group compartments for highly sensitive information, but was deprecated as of 2011.NRO Review and Redaction Guide, p. 140. * GAMMA (SI-G) A person is granted access to a specific compartment after the individual has: (a) had a Single Scope Background Investigation similar to that required for a collateral Top Secret clearance; (b) been \\"read into\\" or briefed on the nature and sensitivity of the compartment; and (c) signed a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). The individual then has access to all information in the compartment, regardless of its classification (and assuming a need to know). However, access does not extend to any other compartment; i.e., there is no single \\"SCI clearance\\" analogous to DoD collateral Top Secret. The requirements for DCID 6/4 eligibility (a determination that an individual is eligible for access to SCI), subsumes the requirements for a TS collateral clearance. Being granted DCID 6/4 eligibility includes the simultaneous granting of a TS collateral clearance, as adjudicators are required to adjudicate to the highest level that the investigation (SSBI) supports. Groups of compartmented information SAPs in the Department of Defense are subdivided into three further groups, as defined in . There is no public reference to whether SCI is divided in the same manner, but news reports reflecting that only the Gang of Eight members of Congress are briefed on certain intelligence activities, it may be assumed that similar rules apply for SCI or for programs with overlapping SAP and SCI content. The groups for Department of Defense SAPs are: :* Acknowledged: appears as a line item as \\"classified project\\" or the equivalent in the federal budget, although details of its content are not revealed. The budget element will associate the SAP with a Department of Defense component organization, such as a Military Department (e.g. Department of the Navy), a Combatant Command (e.g. U.S. Special Operations Command) or a Defense Agency (e.g. Defense Information Systems Agency.) :* Unacknowledged: no reference to such SAPs is found in the publicly published federal budget; its funding is hidden in a classified annex, often called the \\"black budget\\". The Congressional defense committees, however, are briefed on the specifics of such SAPs. :* Waived: At the sole discretion of the Secretary of Defense, on a case-by-case basis in the interest of national security, there is no mention in the budget at all, and only the \\"Big 6\\" members of Congress; the Chairman and Ranking Minority Members of the armed services committees, the appropriations committees and the defense appropriations subcommittees; receive notification of such SAPs. Examples of SCI topics are human intelligence, communications intelligence, and intelligence collected by satellites. One or more compartments may be created for each area, and each of these compartments may contain multiple subcompartments (e.g., a specific HUMINT operation), themselves with their own code names. Specific compartmented programs will have their own specific rules. For example, it is standard that no person is allowed unaccompanied access to a nuclear weapon or to command-and-control systems for nuclear weapons. Personnel with nuclear- weapons access are under the Personnel Reliability Program. Some highly sensitive SAP or SCI programs may also use the \\"no lone zone\\" method (that is, a physical location into which no one is allowed to enter unaccompanied) described for nuclear weapons. =Handling caveats= The United States also has a system of restrictive caveats that can be added to a document: these are constantly changing, but can include (in abbreviated form) a requirement that the document not be shared with a civilian contractor or not leave a specific room. These restrictions are not classifications in and of themselves; rather, they restrict the dissemination of information within those who have the appropriate clearance level and possibly the need to know the information. Remarks such as \\"EYES ONLY\\" and \\"DO NOT COPY\\" also limit the restriction. One violating these directives might be guilty of violating a lawful order or mishandling classified information. For ease of use, caveats and abbreviations have been adopted that can be included in the summary classification marking (header/footer) to enable the restrictions to be identified at a glance. They are sometimes known as Dissemination Control Abbreviations. Some of these caveats are (or were): :*FOUO: For Official Use Only. Used for documents or products which contain material which is exempt from release under the Freedom of Information Act. :*NFIBONLY: National Foreign Intelligence Board Departments Only :*NOFORN: Distribution to non-US citizens is prohibited, regardless of their clearance or access permissions (NO FOReign National access allowed). :*NOCONTRACTOR: Distribution to contractor personnel (non-US- government employees) is prohibited, regardless of their clearance or access permissions. :*ORCON: Originator controls dissemination and/or release of the document. :*PROPIN: Caution‚ÄîProprietary Information Involved :*REL: Distribution to citizens of the countries listed is permitted, providing they have appropriate accesses and need to know. Example: \\"REL TO USA, AUS, CAN, GBR, NZL\\" indicates that the information may be shared with appropriate personnel from Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, and New Zealand. :::*FVEY is the country code used as shorthand for the Five Eyes. :*X: Information is exempt from automatic declassification (after the statutory default of 25 years) for exemption reason , and declassification review shall not be permitted for years (as determined by law or the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel). For the most part, the exemption reasoning and caveats are outlined in paragraphs (b)‚Äì(d) and (g)‚Äì(i) of Sec. 3.3 of Executive Order 13526, but paragraph (b) is typically the one being referenced as the exemption reason value . ::Example: \\"50X1\\" indicates the information must remain classified for 50 years, since it pertains to intelligence activities, sources, or methods (reason (1) of Section 3.3, paragraph (b)). :*RESTRICTED: Distribution to non-US citizens or those holding an interim clearance is prohibited; certain other special handling procedures apply. :*FISA: is used in FISC and probably in FISCR since at least 2017. Classification level and caveats are typically separated by \\"//\\" in the summary classification marking. For example, the final summary marking of a document might be: > SECRET////ORCON/NOFORN or > TOP SECRET//NOFORN/FISA =Controls on atomic-energy information= The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 sets requirements for protection of information about nuclear weapons and special nuclear materials. Such information is \\"classified from birth\\", unlike all other sensitive information, which must be classified by some authorized individual. However, authorized classifiers still must determine whether documents or material are classified or restricted. The U.S. Department of Energy recognizes two types of Restricted Data:Los Alamos National Laboratory, Guide to Portion Marking Documents and Material, Appendix B, Definitions . Retrieved December 15, 2006. * Restricted Data. Data concerning the design, manufacture, or utilization of atomic weapons; production of special nuclear material; or use of special nuclear material in the production of energy. * Formerly Restricted Data. Classified information jointly determined by the DOE and the Department of Defense to be related primarily to the military utilization of atomic weapons and removed from the Restricted Data category. Documents containing such information must be marked \\"RESTRICTED DATA\\" (RD) or \\"FORMERLY RESTRICTED DATA\\" (FRD) in addition to any other classification marking. Restricted Data and Formerly Restricted Data are further categorized as Top Secret, Secret, or Confidential. SIGMA categories and Critical Nuclear Weapon Design Information RESTRICTED DATA contains further compartments. The Department of Energy establishes a list of SIGMA Categories for more fine-grained control than RESTRICTED DATA. Critical Nuclear Weapon Design Information (CNWDI, colloquially pronounced \\"Sin-Widdy\\") reveals the theory of operation or design of the components of a nuclear weapon. As such, it would be SIGMA 1 or SIGMA 2 material, assuming laser fusion is not involved in the information. Access to CNWDI is supposed to be kept to the minimum number of individuals needed. In written documents, paragraphs containing the material, assuming it is Top Secret, would be marked (TS//RD-CNWDI). SIGMA information of special sensitivity may be handled much like SAP or SCI material (q.v.) Naval Nuclear Propulsion Information While most Naval Nuclear Propulsion Information is sensitive, it may or may not be classified. The desired power densities of naval reactors make their design peculiar to military use, specifically high-displacement, high-speed vessels. The proliferation of quieter- or higher-performance marine propulsion systems presents a national-security threat to the United States. Due to this fact, all but the most basic information concerning NNPI is classified. The United States Navy recognizes that the public has an interest in environmental, safety, and health information, and that the basic research the Navy carries out can be useful to industry. Sharing of classified information with other countries In cases where the United States wishes to share classified information bilaterally (or multilaterally) with a country that has a sharing agreement, the information is marked with \\"REL TO USA\\", (release) and the three-letter country code.See the WATERWITCH document at right for an example of a document marked REL TO USA, FVEY For example, if the U.S. wanted to release classified information to the government of Canada, it would mark the document \\"REL TO USA, CAN\\". There are also group releases, such as NATO, FVEY or UKUSA. Those countries would have to maintain the classification of the document at the level originally classified (Top Secret, Secret, etc.). Claims of U.S. government misuse of the classification system Max Weber: > Every bureaucracy strives to increase the superiority of its position by > keeping its knowledge and intentions secret. Bureaucratic administration > always seeks to evade the light of the public as best it can, because in so > doing it shields its knowledge and conduct from criticism > ...\\"Weber‚Äî‚ÄòOfficial Secrets‚Äô and Bureaucratic Warfare\\", Harper's, July 18, > 2009 While the classification of information by the government is not supposed to be used to prevent information from being made public that would be simply embarrassing or reveal criminal acts, it has been alleged that the government routinely misuses the classification system to cover up criminal activity and potentially embarrassing discoveries. Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists notes that > ... inquiring into classified government information and disclosing it is > something that many national security reporters and policy analysts do, or > try to do, every day. And with a few narrow exceptions‚Äîfor particularly > sensitive types of information‚Äîcourts have determined that this is not a > crime.\\" Aftergood notes, \\"The universe of classified information includes > not only genuine national security secrets, such as confidential > intelligence sources or advanced military technologies, but an endless > supply of mundane bureaucratic trivia, such as 50-year-old intelligence > budget figures, as well as the occasional crime or cover-up. The National Security Archive has collected a number of examples of overclassification and government censors blacking out documents that have already been released in full, or redacting entirely different parts of the same document at different times. In The Pentagon Papers case, a classified study was published revealing that four administrations had misled the American public about their intentions in the Vietnam War, increasing the credibility gap. Russo and Ellsberg were prosecuted under Espionage Law. The case prompted Harold Edgar & Benno C. Schmidt, Jr. to write a review of Espionage law in the 1973 Columbia Law Review. Their article was entitled \\"The Espionage Statutes and Publication of Defense Information\\". In it, they point out that Espionage law does not criminalize classified information, only national defense information. They point out that Congress has repeatedly resisted or failed to make the disclosing of classified information illegal, in and of itself. Instead, Congress has strictly limited which sort of classified information is illegal, and under which specific circumstances it is illegal. i.e. in Congress specifically criminalized leaking cryptographic information that is classified, but when it passed the law it specifically stated the law didn't criminalize disclosing other types of classified information.The Edgar & Schmidt 1973 Columbia Law Review, \\"The Espionage Statutes and Publication of Defense Information\\". The article is available online at https://fas.org/sgp/library/ Another article that discusses the issue is by Jennifer Elsea of the Congressional Research Service.Jennifer Elsea, January 2013, \\"Criminal Prohibitions on the Publication of Classified Defense Information\\" Various UFO conspiracies mention a level \\"Above Top Secret\\" used for UFO design information and related data. They suggest such a classification is intended to apply to information relating to things whose possible existence is to be denied, such as aliens, as opposed to things whose potential existence may be recognized, but for which access to information regarding specific programs would be denied as classified. The British government, for example, denied for several decades that they were either involved or interested in UFO sightings. However, in 2008, the government revealed they have monitored UFO activity for at least the past 30 years. The existence of an \\"Above Top Secret\\" classification is considered by some as unnecessary to keep the existence of aliens a secret, as they say information at the Top Secret level, or any level for that matter, can be restricted on the basis of need to know. Thus, the U.S. government could conceal an alien project without having to resort to another level of clearance, as need to know would limit the ability to have access to the information. Some suggest that claims of the existence of such a classification level may be based on the unsubstantiated belief that the levels of classification are themselves classified. As such, they feel that books claiming to contain \\"Above Top Secret\\" information on UFOs or remote viewing should arguably be taken with a grain of salt. Without making a judgment on if such classifications have been used for space aliens, it is a reality that even the names of some compartments were classified, and certainly the meaning of the code names. In the cited document, an (S) means the material it precedes is Secret and (TS) means Top Secret. According to the Department of Defense directive, \\"the fact of\\" the existence of NRO was at the secret level for many years, as well as the fact of and the actual phrase \\"National Reconnaissance Program\\" (see Paragraph II). Paragraph V(a) is largely redacted, but the introduction to the documents clarifies (see Document 19) that it refers to the now-cancelled BYEMAN code word and control channel for NRO activities. BYEMAN, the main NRO compartment, was classified as a full word, although the special security offices could refer, in an unclassified way, to \\"B policy\\". Responsible agencies Any agency designated by the President can originate classified information if it meets the content criteria; each agency is responsible for safeguarding and declassifying its own documents. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) has custody of classified documents from defunct agencies, and also houses the National Declassification Center (since 2010) and Information Security Oversight Office. The Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel has representatives from the Departments of State, Defense, and Justice; the National Archives, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence; the National Security Advisor; the Central Intelligence Agency; and Information Security Oversight Office.Executive Order 13526, Sec. 5.3. Declassification Declassification is the process of removing the classification of a document and opening it for public inspection. =Automatic declassification= In accordance with Executive Order 13526, published January 5, 2010 (which superseded Executive Order 12958, as amended), an executive agency must declassify its documents after 25 years unless they fall under one of the nine narrow exemptions outlined by section 3.3 of the order. Classified documents 25 years or older must be reviewed by any and all agencies that possess an interest in the sensitive information found in the document. Documents classified for longer than 50 years must concern human intelligence sources or weapons of mass destruction, or get special permission.Executive Order 12958, Section 3.3 (h) All documents older than 75 years must have special permission.Executive Order 12958, Section 3.3 (h)(3) =Systematic declassification= The Order also requires that agencies establish and conduct a program for systematic declassification review, based on the new and narrower criteria. This only applies to records that are of permanent historical value and less than 25 years old. Section 3.4 of Order 13526, directs agencies to prioritize the systematic review of records based upon the degree of researcher interest and the likelihood of declassification upon review. = Mandatory Declassification Review = A Mandatory Declassification Review, or MDR, is requested by an individual in an attempt to declassify a document for release to the public. These challenges are presented to the agency whose equity, or \\"ownership\\", is invested in the document. Once an MDR request has been submitted to an agency for the review of a particular document, the agency must respond either with an approval, a denial, or the inability to confirm or deny the existence or nonexistence of the requested document. After the initial request, an appeal can be filed with the agency by the requester. If the agency refuses to declassify that document, then a decision from a higher authority can be provided by the appellate panel, the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel (ISCAP). =Freedom of Information Act= The U.S. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson on July 4, 1966, took effect the following year, and was amended in 1974, 1976, 1986, 1996 and 2002 (in 1974 over President Ford's veto). This act allows for the full or partial disclosure of previously unreleased information and documents controlled by the U.S. government. Any member of the public may ask for a classified document to be declassified and made available for any reason. The requestor is required to specify with reasonable certainty the documents of interest. If the agency refuses to declassify, the decision can be taken to the courts for a review. The FOIA does not guarantee that requested documents will be released; refusals usually fall under one of the nine of the declassification exemptions that protect highly sensitive information. =History of National Archives and Records Administration role= After declassification, the documents from many agencies are accessioned at the National Archives and Records Administration and put on the open shelves for the public. NARA also reviews documents for declassification. NARA first established a formal declassification program for records in 1972, and between 1973 and 1996 reviewed nearly 650 million pages of historically valuable federal records related to World War II, the Korean War, and American foreign policy in the 1950s as part of its systematic declassification review program. From 1996 to 2006, NARA had processed and released close to 460 million pages of federal records, working in partnership with the agencies that originated the records. Over the years, NARA has processed more than 1.1 billion pages of national security classified federal records, resulting in the declassification and release of ninety-one percent of the records. NARA has also provided significant support to several special projects to review and release federal records on topics of extraordinary public interest such as POW/MIAs or Nazi war crimes. Additionally, NARA works closely with reference archivists to ensure that the federal records most in demand by researchers receive priority for declassification review and performs review on demand for individuals who need records that do not fall into a priority category. NARA has improved or developed electronic systems to support declassification, automating some processes and thus ensuring a more complete record of declassification actions. With assistance from the Air Force, NARA established the Interagency Referral Center (IRC) in order to support agencies as they seek access to their equities in federal records at the National Archives at College Park and to ensure that high-demand records are processed first. In 2009, Executive Order 13526 created the National Declassification Center at NARA, which also houses the Information Security Oversight Office.  Presidential libraries  Presidential libraries hold in excess of 30 million classified pages, including approximately 8 million pages from the administrations of Presidents Hoover through Carter, that were subject to automatic declassification on December 31, 2006. The foreign policy materials in Presidential collections are among the highest-level foreign policy documents in the Federal government and are of significant historical value. From 1995 to 2006, the national Presidential Library system reviewed, declassified, and released 1,603,429 pages of presidential materials using systematic guidelines delegated to the Archivist of the United States. NARA has also hosted on-site agency review teams at the Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Ford Presidential Libraries to manage classified equities and all presidential libraries have robust mandatory declassification review programs to support requests of individual researchers.

The village is about to the west of Kingston upon Hull city centre and north of the Humber Estuary in the foothills of the Yorkshire Wolds on the B1231 road. Geography The village of Swanland is located approximately to the west of the centre of Kingston upon Hull on the eastern fringes of the Yorkshire Wolds. The village is distinct from other settlements in the area, separated by fields. To the east are the townships of West Ella, Willerby and Anlaby; to the south-east Hessle and to the south-west North Ferriby.Ordnance Survey 1:25000 2006 The civil parish of Swanland is surrounded by the parishes of North Ferriby, Welton, Skidby, Kirk Ella and West Ella, and Hessle to the south, west, north, north-east and east respectively, with the A63 road forming part of the southern boundary, Melton Bottom road the western boundary, and the A164 approximating to the eastern boundary. The parish is between around above sea level, with a peak of on the western outskirts of the village, close to the location of a water tower. Swanland offers fine views of the surrounding countryside, particularly across the Humber Estuary, as has been noted historically. According to the 2011 UK census, Swanland parish had a population of 3,802, an increase on the 2001 UK census figure of 3,688. Swanland lies within the Parliamentary constituency of Haltemprice and Howden. =The village= Swanland village forms a significant part of the civil parish, and is the only place of note within the parish. Near the centre of the village are a pond, as well as library (East Riding of Yorkshire Council operated), school (Swanland Primary School) and public house. Swanland has a village hall, operating as a registered charity. The B1231 road passes through the village. There are two churches in the village: St Barnabas is the Church of England Parish Church; and Christ Church, also known as 'The Church by the Pond', is a Methodist / United Reformed Church. History There is evidence of human activity and habitation in the area around Swanland dating to the British Iron Age/Roman Britain period. Swanland is not mentioned in the Domesday Survey, though a chapel existed in the medieval period, in the 12th century or earlier, and a Hall, is thought to have been sited at Swanland from at least the 13th century, when it was the residence of Eustace de Vesci. In the later medieval period (16th) the Hall was the residence of the Haldenby family. By the late 18th century the Hall was no longer extant. Swanland House (2010) During the 18th and 19th centuries Swanland, together with other villages west of Hull, became a popular place for wealthy residents of Hull to relocate. Large houses in Swanland included Swanland Hall (built after 1740), Braffords Hall (built after 1778), Swanland House (built 1796, rebuilt ), and Swanland Manor (built 1848, demolished 1935). The Congregationalist church, 'Christ Church' was built in 1804, with porches added in the 1840s, and a Primitive Methodist chapel built in 1828. In 1831 Swanland had a population of 418. At the mid 19th century Swanland was essentially a linear settlement along the east-west Mill Lane/Main Street, with the larger halls and manor houses set back from the road in the surrounding land. Outside the village the landscape was rural, enclosed fields, with small scale chalk extraction from pits.Ordnance Survey Sheet 239 1852 A school was built 1876, next to the pond. The church of St Barnabas was built in 1899, established as a \\"mission room\\" for the parish of All Saints' North Ferriby. Swanland Water Tower, built 1931 In 1914 an Institute was built, containing a billiards room and library, funded by Sir James Reckitt. During the 1920s and 30s the village expanded again as a commuter village. Electricity was first supplied to the village in 1929 (with street lighting installed 1954). A large circular concrete water tower was built in 1931 by Hull Corporation, replacing an earlier tower built in the 1890s. Outside the village a large chalk pit was dug in the mid 20th century in the southeast corner of the parish (Humberfield Quarry, disused by the 1980s and subsequently filled in).Ordnance Survey 1:10560/10000 1956, 1968, 1971‚Äì80, 1982‚Äì8 Initial post war housing development consisted of prefabs. Further house building took place in the 1960s, 70s, 80s, and 90s. The population rose steadily from 1,212 in 1951 to around 4,000 in 1998. In 1992 a new St Barnabas church was built to replace the 1899 church, with a large integrated hall and conference facilities. The 'new' church was the first new Anglican Church to be built in the Diocese of York for over 50 years, and was funded primarily by sacrificial giving from members of the congregation under the visionary leadership of first Rev Mike Lowe and then Rev Richard Hill. The church is open 7 days a week, hosting a variety of community groups (Brownies, U3A, etc.) as well as numerous church activities open to all, including a popular parent and toddler group \\"Cygnets\\", fortnightly group walks, a weekly coffee morning, collecting for foodbanks, a senior citizens' exercise group, etc.) The church also hosts 2 thriving Sunday congregations who are actively involved in serving the local community through a buzzing children's church, healthy youth groups and a variety of small groups for all from 11 to 111. Swanland became a separate ecclesiastical parish in 1995. See also *Swanland is twinned with the village of Lestrem in Northern France.

Because the material was later proven to cause cancer in the long run, a large removal-and-replacement industry has been established. Endothermic materials have also been used to a large extent and are still in use today, such as gypsum, concrete and other cementitious products. More highly evolved versions of these are used in aerodynamics, intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and re-entry vehicles, such as the space shuttles. The use of these older materials has been standardised in \\"old\\" systems, such as those listed in BS476, DIN4102 and the National Building Code of Canada.  Fireproofing of structural steel  In a building fire, structural steel loses strength as the temperature increases. In order to maintain the structural integrity of the steel frame, several fireproofing measurements are taken: * restrictions on the amount of exposed steel set by building codes.Allen 2009, p. 459 * encasing structural steel in brick masonry or concrete to delay exposure to high temperatures. Historically, these masonry encasement methods use large amounts of heavy materials, thus greatly increasing the load to the steel frame. Newer materials and methods have been developed to resolve this issue. The following lists both older and newer methods of fireproofing steel beams (i-beams): * complete encasement in concrete square column.Allen 2009, p. 460 - 463 * wrapping the i-beam in a thin layer of metal lath and then covering it with gypsum plaster. This method is effective because gypsum plaster contains water crystals that are heat resistant. * applying multiple layers of gypsum board around the i-beam. * applying spray-on fireproofing around the i-beam. Also called spray-applied fire-resistive materials (SFRM) using air pressured spray gun, which can be made from gypsum plaster, mineral fibers mixed with inorganic binder or a cementitious formula using magnesium oxychloride cement. * enclosing the i-beam in sheet metal and fill with loose insulation. * hollow columns filled with liquid water or antifreeze. When part of the column is exposed to fire, the heat is dissipated throughout by the convection property of the liquid. * encasing the i-beam in rigid concrete slab. * a layer of suspended plaster ceiling isolating the i-beam Alternative methods Intumescent spray fireproofing product has expanded. Among the conventional materials, purpose-designed spray fireproofing plasters have become abundantly available the world over. The inorganic methods include: * Gypsum plasters * Cementitious plasters * Fibrous plasters The industry considers gypsum-based plasters to be \\"cementitious\\", even though these contain no Portland, or calcium aluminate cements. Cementitious plasters that contain Portland cement have been traditionally lightened by the use of inorganic lightweight aggregates, such as vermiculite and perlite. Gypsum plasters have been lightened by using chemical additives to create bubbles that displace solids, thus reducing the bulk density. Also, lightweight polystyrene beads have been mixed into the plasters at the factory in an effort to reduce the density, which generally results in a more effective insulation at a lower cost. The resulting plaster has qualified to the A2 combustibility rating as per DIN4102. Fibrous plasters, containing either mineral wool, or ceramic fibres tend to simply entrain more air, thus displacing the heavy fibres. On-site cost reduction efforts, at times purposely contravening the requirements of the certification listing, can further enhance such displacement of solids. This has resulted in architects' specifying the use of on-site testing of proper densities to ensure the products installed meet the certification listings employed for each installed configuration, because excessively light inorganic fireproofing does not provide adequate protection and, thus, could be in violation of the listings. Proprietary boards and sheets, made of gypsum, calcium silicate, vermiculite, perlite, mechanically-bonded composite boards made of punched sheet-metal and cellulose-reinforced concrete have all been used to clad items for increased fire resistance. An alternative method to keep building steel below its softening temperature is to use liquid convection cooling in hollow structural members. This method was patented in the 19th century although the first prominent example was 89 years later.see U.S. Steel Tower Substandard Penetrations of structural beams. The installation is incomplete, as the beams are not yet treated with fireproofing. If left as-is, they would collapse in a fire, resulting in openings in the fire separation wall. Money can be saved fraudulently by using apparently suitable fireproofing that is not built to the required standard. Such fraud can be prevented when documentation is required and checked to ensure that all installed configurations meet the certification standards. Possible cases include: * Entraining too much air in inorganic systems, thus reducing densities below fire-tested, saving on materials and labour. * Spraying inorganic fireproofing materials over through-penetrations and building joints that should be firestopped, not fireproofed. This practice negates fire-separation integrity. Firestops must precede spray fireproofing. * Substitution of intumescent and/or endothermic fireproofing coatings by less expensive paints of similar appearance, sometimes in the packaging of the correct materials. * The American and Canadian nuclear industries have, historically, not insisted on listing and approval use and compliance, on the basis of the use of accredited certification laboratories. This has allowed the use of Thermo-Lag 330-1, for which the basis of testing has been proven to be faulty, requiring millions of dollars of remedial work. The Thermo-Lag scandal came to light as a result of disclosures by American whistleblower Gerald W. Brown, who reported the deficiencies in fire testing to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. certification of fireproofing and firestopping remained optional for systems installed in nuclear power plants in Canada and the United States. * Reuse of older materials from demolished buildings, in newer buildings. Work staging Spray fireproofing products have not been qualified to the thousands of firestop configurations, so they cannot be installed in conformance of a certification listing. Therefore, firestopping must precede fireproofing. Both need one another. If the structural steel is left without fireproofing, it can damage fire barriers and a building can collapse. If the barriers are not firestopped properly, fire and smoke can spread from one compartment to another. Traffic tunnels Traffic tunnels may be traversed by vehicles carrying flammable goods, such as petrol, liquefied petroleum gas and other hydrocarbons, which are known to cause a very rapid temperature rise and high ultimate temperatures in case of a fire (see the hydrocarbon curves in fire-resistance rating). Where hydrocarbon transports are permitted in tunnel construction and operations, accidental fires may occur, resulting in the need for fireproofing of traffic tunnels with concrete linings. Traffic tunnels are not ordinarily equipped with fire suppression means, such as fire sprinkler systems. It is very difficult to control hydrocarbon fires by active fire protection means, and it is expensive to equip an entire tunnel along its whole length for the eventuality of a hydrocarbon fire or a BLEVE. =Concrete exposed to hydrocarbon fires= Concrete cannot, by itself, withstand severe hydrocarbon fires. In the Channel Tunnel that connects the United Kingdom and France, an intense fire broke out and reduced the concrete lining in the undersea tunnel down to about 50 mm. In ordinary building fires, concrete typically achieves excellent fire-resistance ratings, unless it is too wet, which can cause it to crack and explode. For unprotected concrete, the sudden endothermic reaction of the hydrates and unbound humidity inside the concrete generates pressure high enough to spall off the concrete, which falls in small pieces on the floor of the tunnel. Humidity probes are inserted into all concrete slabs that undergo fire testing to test for this, even for the less severe building elements curve (DIN4102, ASTM E119, BS476, or ULC-S101). The need for fireproofing was demonstrated, among other fire protection measures, in the European \\"Eureka\\" Fire Tunnel Research Project, which gave rise to building codes for the trade to avoid the effects of such fires upon traffic tunnels. Cementitious spray fireproofing must be certification-listed and applied in the field as per that listing, using a hydrocarbon fire test curve such as the one used in UL1709. Fireproof vaults Fireproof vaults to protect important paper documents are usually built using concrete or masonry blocks as the primary building material. In the event of a fire, the chemically-bound water within the concrete or masonry blocks is forced into the vault chamber as steam, which soaks the paper documents to keep them from igniting. This steam also helps keep the temperature inside the vault chamber below the critical threshold, which is the point at which information on paper documents is destroyed. The paper can later be remediated with a freeze drying process if the fire is extinguished before internal temperatures exceed . An alternate less expensive and time-consuming construction method is using dry insulating material. This vault construction method is sufficient for paper documents, but the steam generated by concrete and masonry structures will destroy contents that are more sensitive to heat and moisture. For example, information on microfilm is destroyed at (a.k.a. Class 150) and magnetic media (such as data tapes) lose data above (a.k.a. Class 125). Fireproof vaults built to meet the more stringent Class 125 requirement are called data-rated vaults. All components of fireproof vaults must meet the fire protection rating of the vault itself, including doors, HVAC penetrations and cable penetrations.National Fire Protection Association 232 \\"Protection of Records\\" See also * BLEVE * Brominated flame retardant * Cable tray * Channel tunnel * Circuit integrity * Compartmentalisation * Construction * Endothermic * Fire * Fire protection * Fire-resistance rating * Firestop * Flame retardant * Gerald W.

Brannon, with a screenplay by Ronald Davidson, and special effects by Republic's Lydecker brothers. It was intended to be Republic's second serial featuring \\"new hero\\" Commando Cody and the third 12-chapter serial featuring the rocket-powered flying jacket and helmet introduced in King of the Rocket Men (1949). Instead, for reasons unknown, the hero was renamed \\"Larry Martin\\", who must prevent Martian invaders from using a hydrogen bomb to blow Earth out of its orbit, so that the Martians can move a dying Mars into a closer position to the Sun. As in Radar Men from the Moon (also released in 1952), most of the screen time for each of the dozen chapters is spent on fistfights and car chases between the heroes and a gang of crooks hired by Narab and his extraterrestrial colleague Marex to steal and stockpile the Atomic supplies needed for construction of the H-bomb. The serial is best remembered as one of the first screen appearances of a young Leonard Nimoy, who plays Narab, one of the three Martian invaders. In 1958, a feature film version of this serial, retitled Satan's Satellites, was made by editing down the serial's footage to feature film length. Plot Larry Martin (Judd Holdren), a leader in the Inter-Planetary Patrol, detects a rocket coming to Earth. He takes to the air in his jet-powered rocket suit and helmet to investigate and discovers Martian invaders, led by Marex (Lane Bradford). Since Mars is now orbiting too far from the Sun and its ecology has been dying, the Martian invaders want to swap Earth's and Mars' orbits, so Mars will then be closer to the Sun. They plan on achieving this by using hydrogen bomb plans stolen from Earth scientists to cause the two planets' orbits to swap, using specifically placed atomic explosions on both worlds. Martin also learns the Martians have Earth accomplices in the forms of the traitorous Dr. Harding (Stanley Waxman), and two gangsters, Roth (John Crawford) and Shane (Ray Boyle), who bedevil him and his associates, Sue Davis (Aline Towne) and Bob Wilson (Wilson Wood). The Martians set up a base in a cave that can only be reached from underwater, where they begin constructing their bomb; and make a remotely-controlled robot to supplement their human associates in acquiring supplies and funds to complete the project. Eventually, Larry and his comrades gain the upper hand: Marex kills Harding when he attempts to surrender, Roth and Shane are killed when Larry turns the robot against them, and the Martians are brought down in flames in their rocket ship after a furious stratosphere raygun battle with Larry in his own spacecraft. Marex's Martian aide, Narab (Leonard Nimoy) survives the crash and tells Larry where to find the underwater cave with the activated bomb in it. Larry arrives in time to defuse the bomb just seconds before it would have exploded.

Then, just as filming began on this serial, the name of the hero was changed from Commando Cody to Larry Martin; but he retains all the same sidekicks (also renamed), high-tech props and laboratory facilities that Commando Cody had in the previous serial, Radar Men from the Moon. An addition to the Rocket Man back-pack and helmet, and used for the first time in this serial, is a two-way radio about the size of a lunchbox; Larry Martin wears it hanging heavily from his belt when dressed for flying. This radio is also seen in some stills of Cody in Commando Cody: Sky Marshal of the Universe. As most flying sequences are reused stock footage from earlier Rocket Man serials, the radio usually disappears when Commando Cody is in flight. Martin also uses an ordinary police revolver instead of the ray gun favored by Cody in earlier and later serials. Zombies of the Stratosphere was budgeted at $172,838, although the final negative cost was $176,357 (a $3,519, or 2%, overspend). It was the cheapest Republic serial of 1952 and was filmed between April 14, and May 1, 1952. At seventeen days, this is tied with King of the Carnival for the shortest filming period of all Republic serials. The serial's production number was 1933. Zombies of the Stratosphere reuses the \\"Republic Robot\\" (somewhat resembling a walking silvery hot-water heater with two ribbed arms that terminate in pincers), along with stock footage of it in action (such as the Bank Robbery by Robot scene from Mysterious Doctor Satan) and black-and-white footage from a Republic full color Roy Rogers film. The serial is also heavily padded with footage from their King of the Rocket Men (1949), to which this is a pseudo-sequel. Although the Zombies serial has Martians as the villains, they are not the same Martians as shown in the earlier Republic serial The Purple Monster Strikes.Harmon and Glut 1973, pp. 289‚Äì290.Stedman 1971, p. 141. The Robot was first seen in Undersea Kingdom (1936) and prominently featured in Mysterious Doctor Satan (1940). =Stunts= * Dale Van Sickel as Larry Martin (doubling Judd Holdren) * Tom Steele =Special effects= All the special effects in Zombies of the Stratosphere were produced by the Lydecker brothers, Republic's in-house physical and model effects team. Their flying effects, using a dummy running along a wire, were first used in Republic's Darkest Africa (1936) and with greater impact in their Adventures of Captain Marvel serial (1941). Release =Theatrical= Zombies of the Stratospheres official release date is July 16, 1952, although this is actually the date the sixth chapter was made available to film exchanges. This was followed by the release of Commando Cody: Sky Marshal of the Universe, which had been filmed around the productions of Zombies (three episodes before, the remaining nine afterwards) as a projected twelve-part TV series but which was theatrically issued instead. In this latter film, Judd Holdren played a masked Cody and Aline Towne appeared again as Joan Gilbert. A 70-minute feature film version, created by heavily editing down the serial footage, was released on March 28, 1958, under the new title Satan's Satellites. =Television= Zombies of the Stratosphere was one of two Republic serials later colorized for 1990s television broadcast. =Home video releases= During 1991, the serial was released in original full length and black-and-white on two videodiscs from The Roan Group; in 1995 by Republic Pictures Home Video in the U.S. on VHS edited to 93 minutes and colorized;\\"Zombies of the Stratosphere [VHS].\\" Amazon.

Reception Critics and viewers found the serial to be relatively dull and unimaginative, not as interesting as Radar Men from the Moon. The use of stock footage from earlier serials is not quite as overwhelming as seen in the earlier or later Cody outings, as greater emphasis is placed on fistfights rather than scenes using the rocket back-pack. Holdren's performance is often stiff and amateurish, especially when compared to the professionalism of the old Republic pros who surround him on screen.

They are typically 6 characters in length though Easyjet currently uses record locators which are either 6 or 7 characters.. When a passenger, travel agent or airline employee refers to a record locator they typically mean a pointer to a specific reservation which is known as a Passenger Name Record or PNR. However, a record locator can point at records containing other forms of data. Record locators are unique within a given system at a specific point in time. Because the number of character combinations in 6 characters is finite albeit very large, record locators get reused once the data to which it refers has been purged from the system. Because 1, I and L can be confused (also 0 and o) these characters are not always used in record locators. The pool of available character combinations is further reduced because the locator is actually a location address and there are rules about what character combinations can be used for such addresses. Because the term record locator is usually used to refer to a PNR the two terms can become confused. Use When a reservation is made a PNR is created in the system used by the person making the booking. This PNR will have a record locator. If the booking has been made through the airline and the only flight(s) are operated by the airline making the reservation only one PNR will exist. However, if the booking contains flights of more than one airline (for example a passenger flies London/New York City on British Airways and returns on United Airlines) then the reservation for both flights will typically be made through the first airline. The first airline will send messages to the 2nd confirming the reservation and the 2nd airline will create a separate PNR which has its own record locator. If the booking is made through a travel agency then a PNR (and record locator) will exist in the system used by the agency and further PNRs (each with their own record locator) will exist in each airline system. In recent years more and more airlines have stopped running their own reservation systems and have become clients of systems such as Amadeus and Sabre who provide hosting services. Where this occurs a single PNR (with just one record locator) may be created in the hosting system containing details of all the flights for which that hosting system is responsible. For example, a reservation for passenger traveling from London to Paris on Air France returning BA booked through AF will reside in one PNR in the Amadeus system with just one record locator because both airlines use Amadeus for reservations. If that booking is made through a travel agent using Amadeus the same single PNR/record locator will exist. However, if the reservation is made via an agency using a different system (e.g. Sabre) there will be two PNRs (one in Sabre and one in Amadeus) each with its own locator. Airline systems pass record locators between themselves as part of the confirmation process. Should a record locator fail to be passed between two systems the PNR can still be retrieved using flight number/date and name, or the ticket number. Other terms Not all airlines use the term record locator. Other terms in use include: *Confirmation number *Reservation number *Confirmation code *Booking reference *Booking code *Vendor locator Example record locators Example record locators are RMT33W, KZVGX5, IIRCYC. In the past, the Reservec 2 system had eight character record locators in the form xxnnnnxx where x was a letter and n a decimal digit. Some CPARS (Compact Programmed Airlines Reservations System) systems used five character locators.

An all-rounder who batted in the middle order, he was selected as one of Wisden Cricketers of the Year for 1909. Life and career Newstead was born in Marton, Middlesbrough, Yorkshire. He learned the game under the tutorship of William Brunton - a North Riding cricketer of good local repute in the days of the England eleven. He made such rapid progress that aged seventeen he was given an engagement with Middlesbrough C.C. He was given two trials for the county in 1903 against Cambridge University and Derbyshire, but he was treated as a batsman and not as a bowler. As a result of the mistake he was not kept on. He was then on the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) staff until 1906. Playing eight times for the club, he met with moderate results and was not regularly used as a bowler. The turning point in his career was an engagement in Ireland in 1907. In twelve weeks' engagement with Woodbrook Bray C.C. he took over a hundred wickets and his possibilities as a bowler were realised by the Yorkshire authorities. His emergence in 1908 was prefigured by an extraordinary analysis of 7 wickets for 10 runs against Worcestershire at Bradford, on his recall to the Yorkshire team at the end of the 1907 campaign. In 1908 he made 927 runs and took 140 wickets and was a big factor in Yorkshire's regaining the County Championship. A bowler of near medium pace, he also imparted the then fashionable in- duckers, or quick off spin. However, Newstead's great season proved to be something of a flash in the pan, for he took only 151 further wickets. He lost his place before the end of 1909: he averaged only fourteen with the bat, and did not appear regularly again, making his final first-class, and only appearance of the season, in 1913. In 1914 he joined Rishton Cricket Club in the Lancashire League, taking 94 wickets at 7.57, and he later appeared for Lidget Green and East Bierley, then on to Church Cricket Club from 1919 to 1921 and finally Haslingden in 1922. Newstead died in Blackburn, Lancashire, in March 1952.

Liliensternus was a moderate-sized, bipedal, ground-dwelling carnivore, that could grow up to long. It is the best represented Triassic theropod from Europe and one of the largest known.Rauhut, O.M.W. & A. Hungerbuhler, 1998, \\"A review of European Triassic theropods\\". Gaia 15. 75-88. Description Liliensternus restored with a speculative crest. Liliensternus was approximately long, and may have weighed about . Other estimates suggest that Liliensternus was at best long and weighed at most. The remains of two specimens of Liliensternus together form a syntype series with inventory number MB.R.2175, and consist of the partial and fragmentary skeletons of at least two individuals, containing elements of the skull, the lower jaws, the vertebrae and the appendicular skeleton. The tibia (409 mm) is shorter than the femur (440 mm) in both Dilophosaurus and Liliensternus, unlike those of coelophysid taxa, such as Coelophysis. Paul (1988) noted that based on its appearance, Liliensternus could be considered to be an intermediate between Coelophysis and Dilophosaurus. Although the skull is not well known, many reconstructions have Liliensternus with a crest similar to that observed in Dilophosaurus. Its ilium (hip bone) is unusually short, as is the case with Dilophosaurus. Liliensternus has five fingers, much like its contemporaries, but its fourth and fifth digits are smaller than the rest, a possible transitional stage between the five fingered theropods of the Triassic and the three fingered theropods of the Jurassic. Rauhut et al. (1998) noted that the remains may represent a juvenile or subadult individual based on the presence of only two fused sacrals and the fact that the neurocentral sutures are still visible in the vertebrae. A diagnosis is a statement of the anatomical features of an organism (or group) that collectively distinguish it from all other organisms. Some, but not all, of the features in a diagnosis are also autapomorphies. An autapomorphy is a distinctive anatomical feature that is unique to a given organism or group. According to Rauhut (2000), Liliensternus can be distinguished based on the following features: the cervical vertebrae feature a broad rounded ridge that extends from the posterior end of the diapophyses to the posteroventral end of the vertebral centrum, one pair of pleurocoels in the cervical vertebrae, a less developed infradiapophyseal fossa, the absence of a horizontal ridge at the basis of the cervical neural spines, absence of a lateral bulge on the ilium.Rauhut, 2000.

The syntypes were discovered by Count Hugo R√ºhle von Lilienstern in the winter of 1932/1933Barbara A. R. Mohr, Evelyn Kustatscher, Cornelia Hiller and Gottfried B√∂hme, 2008, \\"Hugo R√ºhle v.

This metatarsal was originally described as a manual or pedal element by Meyer (1855) and a pubic fragment by Huene (1908) of Plateosaurus, and the material was re-identified as a proximal metatarsal belonging to Liliensternus by Moser in 2003.Moser, 2003. Plateosaurus engelhardti Meyer, 1837 (Dinosauria: Sauropodomorpha) aus dem Feuerletten (Mittelkeuper; Obertrias) von Bayern. Zitteliana B 24, 3-186. Sander (1992) referred additional material to Liliensternus, which was thought to have been collected in 1961 grey/green marlstone from the L√∂wenstein Formation in Aargau, Switzerland, which is considered to also be from the Norian stage of the Late Triassic period.Sander, 1992. The Norian Plateosaurus bonebeds of central Europe and their taphonomy. Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology. 93:255-296. A tooth referred to this Liliensternus, deposited in the Norian, and collected in 1913 in dark red mudstone from the L√∂wenstein Formation in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany. The only material assigned to this genus from later strata was discovered in 1913 in blue claystone from the Rhaetian stage of the Late Triassic, in the Trossingen Formation from Sachsen-Anhalt, Germany, approximately 208 to 201 million years ago. The Liliensternus specimens remained in Hugo R√ºhle von Lilienstern's castle until 1969 when they were transferred to the collection of the Natural History Museum of Berlin, their present location. The genus and specific names Liliensternus liliensterni are derived from the last name of count, amateur paleontologist, and medical doctor, Hugo R√ºhle von Lilienstern. This dinosaur was named in his honor for his furthering paleontology in Germany by founding a paleontological museum in his castle in Bedheim, on 1 July 1934. Liliensternus was described by Friedrich von Huene in 1934. Because it was originally named by von Huene as a member of the genus Halticosaurus, the type species of the genus Liliensternus is Halticosaurus liliensterni; the combinatio nova is Liliensternus liliensterni. In 1993 Gilles Cuny and Peter Galton described a new species that they assigned to this genus, Liliensternus airelensis. Other researchers began to notice differences between L. airelensis and the type species, L. liliensterni, and in 2007, Martin Ezcurra and Cuny assigned the material to its own genus, Lophostropheus. Classification Teeth assigned to Liliensternus sp. In 1934, Huene described two skeletons assigning them the name Halticosaurus liliensterni, but in 1984 Samuel Paul Welles concluded that the type species of Halticosaurus, H. longotarsus, was a nomen dubium. Most what had been written in the literature about Halticosaurus in fact regarded H. liliensterni. Welles therefore erected a new genus: Liliensternus, the name again honoring R√ºhle von Lilienstern.S.P. Welles, 1984, \\"Dilophosaurus wetherilli (Dinosauria, Theropoda): osteology and comparisons\\", Palaeontographica Abteilung A 185: 85-180 The new species name became Liliensternus liliensterni. Rowe (1989) found that Liliensternus is more derived than Dilophosaurus. A second species named in 1993 by Cuny and Galton for fragmentary remains found in France, Liliensternus airelensis, which had an extra pair of cervical pleurocoels, was in 2007 reassigned to a separate genus, Lophostropheus.Ezcurra, M.D, and Cuny, G. (2007). \\"The coelophysoid Lophostropheus airelensis, gen. nov.: a review of the systematics of \\"Liliensternus\\" airelensis from the Triassic-Jurassic boundary outcrops of Normandy (France).\\" Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 27(1): 73-86. Originally assigned to the Halticosauridae, Liliensternus is today considered a basal member of the Neotheropoda. The following evolutionary tree illustrates a synthesis of the relationships of the early theropod groups compiled by Hendrickx et al. in 2015, including the position of Liliensternus in which all studies concur.Hendrickx, C., Hartman, S.A., & Mateus, O. (2015). An Overview of Non- Avian Theropod Discoveries and Classification. PalArch‚Äôs Journal of Vertebrate Palaeontology, 12(1): 1-73. Paleoecology Restoration of Liliensternus in its environment Liliensternus was an active bipedal carnivore that could have preyed on the larger herbivores like Plateosaurus, which were present in its paleoenvironment. The material discovered in Switzerland, Sachsen-Anhalt, Germany and the tooth from Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany, suggest that Liliensternus inhabited ancient floodplains that were abundant with reptiles, therapsids, and Plateosaurus.O.

The hospital, which opened in 1888, closed in 2003 and the site has since been developed for residential use. History High Royds Hospital in a state of decay in 2006 The 300 acre (1.2 km¬≤) estate on which the asylum was built was purchased by the West Riding Justices for ¬£18,000 in 1885. The hospital was designed on the broad arrow plan by architect J. Vickers Edwards and the large gothic complex of stone buildings was formally opened as the West Riding Pauper Lunatic Asylum on 8 October 1888. The administration building, which is Grade II listed, features an Italian mosaic floor in the main corridor which is intricately decorated with the Yorkshire Rose and black daisies - the latter of which provided inspiration for the title of Black Daisies, a television screenplay filmed at High Royds which took as its subject the experiences of sufferers of Alzheimer's disease. The hospital was intended to be largely self-sufficient, and had its own library, surgery, dispensary, butchery, dairies, bakery, shop, upholster's and cobbler's workshops and a large estate partly devoted to agriculture and market gardening. The patients lived in wards and if they were able, were expected to work towards their keep either on the farm, in the kitchens or laundry, or in various handicraft facilities. The hospital was formerly connected to the Wharfedale railway line by its own small railway system, the High Royds Hospital Railway, but this was closed in 1951.The Railways of Wharfedale, Peter E. Baughan (1969) David & Charles (Publishers) Ltd The report into the abuse committed by Jimmy Savile notes that he had carried out instances of abuse at High Royds Hospital in the 1980s. The report said that the assault was during a fancy dress fun run at the hospital and that the witness was credible and accepted the allegation as true. It was also alleged that Saville groped not only patients but also staff from the hospital and a porter was asked if there was a room that Savile could go to if \\"he pulled one of the nurses\\". In its final years of operation, High Royds become outdated and unsuited to modern psychiatric practice. This was acknowledged by the chief executive of Leeds Mental Health in 1999 after complaints from consultants about violence and cramped conditions on the wards. After services were transferred to St James' Hospital and the Mount, High Royds Hospital closed in 2003. In June 2017 a planning application was submitted to convert the administration block and workshops for residential use.  High Royds in popular culture  Since its closure, the site has been used as a film set for the film Asylum, as well as for the successful television series No Angels, Bodies, Fat Friends, Heartbeat and The Royal. The drama Diamond Geezer starring David Jason which aired on ITV1 in March 2005 was also partly shot at High Royds. Leeds band Kaiser Chiefs have written a song (\\"Highroyds\\") about the former hospital. Three of the band (Nick Hodgson, Nick 'Peanut' Baines and Simon Rix) used to attend St. Mary's Catholic High School, the school that faces High Royds Hospital. The band Kasabian named their third album, West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum [sic], after the hospital after hearing about it on a TV documentary. The hospital was the focus of a 2010 Open University documentary about asylums called Mental:A history of the Madhouse. Anna Hope's novel The Ballroom is set in the asylum in 1911.

Elaphrosaurus was a medium- sized but lightly built member of the group that could grow up to long. Morphologically, this dinosaur is significant in two ways. Firstly, it has a relatively long body but is very shallow-chested for a theropod of its size. Secondly, it has very short hindlimbs in comparison with its body. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that this genus is likely a ceratosaur. Earlier suggestions that it is a late surviving coelophysoid have been examined but generally dismissed. Elaphrosaurus is currently believed to be a very close relative of Limusaurus, an unusual beaked ceratosaurian which may have been either herbivorous or omnivorous.  Discovery  Skeletal restoration of elements recovered from 1920-1925 The type specimen of Elaphrosaurus bambergi HMN Gr.S. 38-44 was recovered in the Middle Dinosaur Member of the Tendaguru Formation in Tanzania.The specimen was collected by Werner Janensch, I. Salim, H. Reck, and Parkinson in 1910 in gray, green, red, sandy marl that was deposited during the Kimmeridgian stage of the Jurassic period, approximately 157 to 152 million years ago. This specimen is housed in the collection of the Natural History Museum of Berlin, Germany. Elaphrosaurus was described and named by Werner Janensch in 1920 and the type species is Elaphrosaurus bambergi. The genus name Elaphrosaurus is derived from the Greek words elaphros (ŒµŒªŒ±œÜœÅœåœÇ) meaning \\"light to bear\\" as in \\"light-footed\\", a reference to its presumed high running speed and \\"sauros\\" (œÉŒ±·ø¶œÅŒøœÇ) meaning \\"lizard\\"; thus, \\"light-footed lizard\\". The specific name honours the industrialist Paul Bamberg for his financial support of the Tendagaru expeditions. HMN Gr.S. 38-44 consists of 18 presacral vertebrae, 5 sacral vertebrae, 20 caudal vertebrae, a pelvic girdle, a nearly complete left hindlimb (missing only some phalanges), several isolated metacarpals, and a humerus. In 1925, Janesch referred two rib fragments, a dorsal vertebrae, and a manual phalanx he believed to be phalanx II-2. However, the referred vertebrae has been lost and the manual phalanx (now considered to be phalanx I-1) cannot be evaluated as belonging to Elaphrosaurus. In 1929, he also referred to Elaphrosaurus both scapulocoracoids, two more rib fragments, and a radius (although the radius, being proportionally long and from a different stratigraphic horizon, likely does not belong to this species). Many bones were damaged by calcite encrustation and reconstructed with plaster, although only the left scapulocoracoid was significantly deformed. A related animal, perhaps the same genus, was found in stratigraphic zones 2‚Äì4 of the Morrison Formation.Foster, J. (2007). \\"Appendix.\\" Jurassic West: The Dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation and Their World. Indiana University Press. pp. 327‚Äì329. Few theropod skeletons have been found, most discoveries being fragments. Dinosaur footprints from the Niger Republic and from Beit Zayit were attributed to Elaphrosaurus.M. Avnimelech. 1962. Dinosaur tracks in the Lower Cenomanian of Jerusalem. Nature 196(4851):264Ginsburg, L., Lapparent, A.F. deLoiret, B.and Taquet, P.

This assignment is considered inconclusive.  Description  Size comparison of Elaphrosaurus with a human Elaphrosaurus was long and slender, with a long neck. What is known about Elaphrosaurus mostly comes from a single nearly complete skeleton and no skull has been found. It was distinctive among theropods for being short-legged for its length. Paul (1988) noted that this was the longest-bodied and shallowest-chested theropod that he had examined. Elaphrosaurus was about long, tall at the hip, and weighed about . In 2016 another estimation listed it at 7.5 meters (24.6 feet) long, 2.1 meters tall (6.9 feet) at the hips and 210 kg (460 pounds) in weight. The tibia (shin bone) of Elaphrosaurus, measured 608 mm was considerably longer than its femur (thigh bone) that measured 520 mm, and the metatarsals were 74% the length of the femur. These proportions, also shared by some ornithomimosaurs, likely indicate cursorial habits. Its long tail ended with a rare downward bend which may be unrelated to taphonomy. Although the neck of Elaphrosaurus was long, the thin zygapophyses and a lack of epipophyses on the cervical vertebrae indicate that it was much less flexible than those of other theropods and that it may have only supported a rather small skull. These traits argue against Elaphrosaurus being a predator of large prey, and it was possibly omnivorous or herbivorous due to its close relation with Limusaurus. Restoration of Elaphrosaurus with head and hands based on the related Limusaurus A diagnosis is a statement of the anatomical features of an organism (or group) that collectively distinguish it from all other organisms. Some, but not all, of the features in a diagnosis are also autapomorphies. An autapomorphy is a distinctive anatomical feature that is unique to a given organism. According to Rauhut (2000), Elaphrosaurus can be distinguished based on the following characteristics: the cervical vertebrae possess thin latero-ventral laminae, bordering the posterior pleurocoel ventrally, the cervical vertebrae are strongly concave ventrally, with the ventral margin arching above the mid-height of the anterior articular facet at its highest point, the brevis fossa of the ilium is extremely widened, so that the brevis shelf forms an almost horizontal lateral flange, the distal end of the ischium is strongly expanded into a triangular boot. An emended diagnosis in Rauhut and Carrano's 2016 study added that Elaphrosaurus could uniquely be distinguished by pronounced ventrolateral laminae at the posterior ends of the cervical vertebrae, no cervical epipophyses (especially unique among abelisauroids), the distal end of metacarpal II offset ventrally from its shaft by a distinct step, the proximal end of metatarsal IV almost 2.5 times deeper anteroposteriorly than wide transversely, and a very short ascending process of the astragalus (if identified correctly).  Classification  Cervical vertebrae of the holotype Hind limbs of the holotype Elaphrosaurus was first described by Janensch as a coelurosaurian. At the time, Coelurosauria was a wastebasket taxon for small theropods. Then, Elaphrosaurus was placed in the family Ornithomimidae by Franz Nopcsa in 1928 because of its light frame and the fact that its humerus is straight and slender, with a low deltopectoral crest.Nopcsa, F. (1928). The genera of reptiles: Paleobiologica, 1, pp. 163‚àí188. Janensch himself rejected this assignment, believing any resemblances could plausibly be explained by convergent evolution. By the middle of the twentieth century, Elaphrosaurus was usually seen as a member of the Coeluridae. However, Nopcsa's hypothesis was revived by Dale Alan Russell in 1972, and confirmed by Peter Malcolm Galton in 1982.Galton, 1982. Elaphrosaurus, an ornithomimid dinosaur from the Upper Jurassic of North America and Africa. Pal√§ontologische Zeitschrift. 56, 265‚àí275. In 1988 Gregory S. Paul remarked that upon closer examination its limbs approximate those of Coelophysis and suggested a position in the Coelophysidae. Nevertheless, in 1990 Barsbold, Teresa Marya≈Ñska and Osm√≥lska and other researchers still classified it as an ornithomimid.Barsbold, R; [Teresa Marya≈Ñska[Maryanska, T ; & Osm√≥lska, H: Oviraptorosauria. Weishampel, D B, Dodson, P, & Osmolska, H, editors: The Dinosauria. University of California Press, Berkeley; 1990. More recent work by Carrano and Sampson (2008) and Carrano et al. (2012) assign Elaphrosaurus to the Ceratosauria.M. T. Carrano and S. D. Sampson. 2008. The phylogeny of Ceratosauria (Dinosauria: Theropoda). Journal of Systematic Palaeontology 6(2):183‚àí236M. T. Carrano, R. B. J. Benson, and S. D. Sampson. 2012. The phylogeny of Tetanurae (Dinosauria: Theropoda). Journal of Systematic Palaeontology 10(2):211‚Äì300 A re-study of the known fossil material, published in 2016, concluded that, due to characteristics of the scapulocoracod and metatarsals, Elaphrosaurus was actually an early member of the Noasauridae within Ceratosauria, and that it formed a distinct group with certain Asian noasaurids, which was named the Elaphrosaurinae.Rauhut, O.W.M., and Carrano, M.T. (2016). The theropod dinosaur Elaphrosaurus bambergi Janensch, 1920, from the Late Jurassic of Tendaguru, Tanzania. Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, (advance online publication) The following cladogram is based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by Rauhut and Carrano in 2016, showing the relationships of Elaphrosaurus among the noasaurids: = Formerly assigned species = The following material was assigned to Elaphrosaurus over the years, but further study revealed that these assignments were dubious: * Elaphrosaurus iguidiensis, was described by Albert-F√©lix de Lapparent in 1960,Lapparent, A.-F. 1960. Les dinosauriens du \\"Continental intercalaire\\" du Sahara central. M√©moires de la Soci√©t√© G√©ologique de France. 88A 1-57. and the material was collected in Algeria, Libya and Niger in Early Cretaceous sediments. The material consists of over forty teeth, a manual ungual, eight caudal vertebrae, a distal femur fragment, and a complete tibia measuring 350 mm. These specimens originated in three different localities and do not appear to belong to the same species. * Elaphrosaurus gautieri, was first described by de Lapparent in 1960, and the material was collected at the Tiouraren Formation in Niger in Middle-Late Jurassic sediments. This material, a partial skeleton, has since been renamed Spinostropheus gautieri by Sereno et al. (2004).Sereno, Wilson and Conrad, 2004. New dinosaurs link southern landmasses in the Mid-Cretaceous. Proceedings: Biological Sciences. 71(1546), 1325‚Äì1330. * Elaphrosaurus philtippettensis, subsequently Elaphrosaurus philtippettorum, was erected by Stephan PickeringPickering, 1995a. Jurassic Park: Unauthorized Jewish Fractals in Philopatry. A Fractal Scaling in Dinosaurology Project, 2nd revised printing. Capitola, California. 478 pp.Pickering, S., 1995, An extract from: Archosauromorpha: Cladistics and osteologies. A Fractal Scaling in Dinosaurology Project 2 pp in 1995 based on USNM 5737, which consists of a tibia, a humerus, some metatarsals, and the distal portion of a fragmentary pubic bones recovered from the Morrison Formation of Colorado. Research by Carpenter et al. (2005) concluded that these fossils are not ceratosaurian and are likely referable to the coelurid theropod Tanycolagreus. It is named after visual effects supervisor Phil Tippett. * Elaphrosaurus agilis, was a renaming by Dale Russell in 1980 of Coelurus agilis, originally named by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1884.Russell, D.A. ; Beland, P. & Mclntosh, J.S., 1980, \\"Paleoecology of the dinosaurs of Tendaguru (Tanzania)\\", M√©moires de la Soci√©t√© G√©ologique de France, nouvelle S√©rie, 139: 169-175 The species is based on a pair of fused pubic bones that were by Marsh believed to represent a much larger version of the type species Coelurus fragilis. John Ostrom (1980) confirmed Charles Whitney Gilmore's earlier position that Coelurus agilis was synonymous with Coelurus fragilis. This means that Elaphrosaurus agilis is actually the same animal as Coelurus fragilis, its junior synonym. * Elaphrosaurus sp. USNM 8415, was discovered in 1883 and first referred to the ornithopod Dryosaurus. It was later referred to Elaphrosaurus by Galton in 1982, based on remains recovered at the Morrison Formation of Colorado. This material, which is clearly ceratosaurian, does not bear any morphology that specifically ties it to Elaphrosaurus. Current knowledge limits the placement of this material to Ceratosauria incertae sedis.Carrano and Sampson, 2008. The phylogeny of Ceratosauria (Dinosauria: Theropoda). Journal of Systematic Palaeontology. 6, 183‚Äì236. * Elaphrosaurus sp. DMNH 36284, was referred to this genus by ChureChure, 2001. The second record of the African theropod Elaphrosaurus (Dinosauria, Ceratosauria) from the Western Hemisphere.

Phylogenetic analysis by Carrano and Sampson (2008) showed that it was not basal ceratosaurian, but instead resembled the leg bone of an abelisauroid theropod that has yet to be formally described.  Paleobiology  Holotype mount from the front Paul (1988) noted that Elaphrosaurus bambergi was too small to prey on the sauropods and stegosaurs present in its paleoenvironment, and instead, it likely hunted the small and swift ornithopod herbivores. However, newer studies support the idea that Elaphrosaurus was a herbivore or omnivore, owing to its close relation with Limusaurus and a neck which is much less flexible than those characteristic of carnivorous theropods.  Paleoecology  Studies suggest that the paleoenvironment of the Tendaguru Formation was a marginal marine environment with both non-marine faunal and floral content. The Middle Dinosaur Member of the Tendaguru Formation has yielded the sauropods Giraffatitan, Australodocus, Janenschia, Tornieria and Dicraeosaurus, theropods similar to Allosaurus and Ceratosaurus, the carcharodontosaurid Veterupristisaurus, the stegosaurid Kentrosaurus and the iguanodontian Dysalotosaurus. Dinosaurs shared this paleoenvironment with pterosaurs like Pterodactylus and Rhamphorhynchus, as well as with early mammals.

The company's distribution center was located in Abilene, Kansas, where it was previously headquartered. In October 2014, ALCO filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy; subsequently, the chain was sold to a liquidation firm and closed all of its stores by March 2015. History An ALCO store that was closed April 29, 2013 in Vermilion, Ohio. Duckwall's variety store photographed in Brush, Colorado, in 1991. In its early years the company operated five and dime (or \\"variety\\") stores called Duckwall's. In 1968 it began to move into the discount retail business and opened stores that were bigger than their five and dime counterparts called ALCO. ALCO stores (somewhat smaller than a non-supercenter Walmart) provided the full selection of merchandise offered by the company, while the Duckwall stores provided a limited selection. In 1985, after three acquisitions, the company went through a management-led leveraged buy-out. The company had 127 ALCO stores, and 33 Duckwalls in 14 states at that time. =First bankruptcy and later history= In May 1989, Duckwall-ALCO filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy, emerging in 1991 after securing financing from GE Capital, its primary creditor. At least 52 stores were closed during this period. After 1989 they switched to the business strategy of targeting communities where no direct retail competitor existed (such as Walmart, Target or Kmart). The strategy initially proved to be successful for the chain, and there were 205 ALCO stores and 59 Duckwall stores as of June 2008. The company previously experimented with a combination discount and food store called C.O.L.A. (Cost of Living Adjusters) in Mineral Wells, Texas, which was discontinued. The company also began a supercenter concept, ALCO Market Place, by providing limited perishable goods. These stores were considerably smaller than Walmart's or Target's supercenter stores. Duckwall-ALCO stores announced on November 29, 2010, the closure of all 44 of its Duckwall stores, thus ending the Duckwall name. The store in Hettinger, North Dakota was reopened as an ALCO while the remaining 43 stores permanently closed. Subsequently, the chain dropped the Duckwall name and renamed itself simply as ALCO Stores, Inc. In the Fall of 2011, ALCO stores opened its first store in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex suburb of Grand Prairie, Texas, but closed the store in May 2014 due to lackluster sales. On April 10, 2013, ALCO Stores, Inc. moved its corporate headquarters from Abilene, Kansas, to Coppell, Texas. =Second Bankruptcy and Closure= On October 12, 2014, ALCO Stores Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy citing \\"increased competition\\" and \\"declining consumer and business confidence, which has led to decreased customer traffic and reduced levels of consumer spending, particularly on discretionary items.\\" On November 17, bidding on the company through bankruptcy court ended with a liquidation firm joint venture, which provided a \\"stalking horse bid\\" and the only bid received by the court, being approved as the new owner. Going out of business sales at all locations started on November 21, 2014. The last ALCO store closed in March 2015. 20 locations were acquired by Shopko, and were converted into Shopko Hometown stores. Bomgaars took over 12 former locations. Orscheln Farm & Home acquired ALCO's former distribution center in Abilene, Kansas. Other locations were acquired by various entities, either before closure or afterwards (for example, Brookshire Brothers acquired the ALCO location in Pilot Point, Texas). Acquisitions *1983 - Sterling Stores Co. Inc was acquired. Based in Little Rock, Arkansas, it operated 48 stores under the Sterling and Magic Mart names in Mississippi and Arkansas. The majority of these stores were converted to either ALCO or Duckwall stores, though the Sterling nameplate was maintained until 2005 when the final Sterling store in Little Rock, Arkansas was closed.http://www.arkansaspreservation.com/National- Register-Listings/PDF/PU7342.nr.pdf *1984 - David's in Wichita, Kansas *1985 - Hornsby, a 9-store chain based in Morris, Illinois, was acquired. *1996 - Val chain of 14 stores in Indiana and Ohio, with headquarters in New Castle, Indiana, was acquired. *1997 - Acquired 18 stores from Perry Brothers, located in Texas and New Mexico, which were converted to Duckwall stores.

DERBY - Norman E. Vaughan ‚Äì 17 May 2002)GRO Register of Deaths: OCT 2002 B35 246 TOWER HAMLETS - Norman Edward Vaughan, DoB = 10 Apr 1923, aged 79 was an English comedian who led a long and successful career in the television and theatre, appearing occasionally in films. Early life Vaughan was born in Liverpool and began a stage career at the age of 14 with a boys' theatrical troupe - the Eton Boys Choir, singing 'D'ye Ken John Peel'. A few years later, he formed a dance trio called 'The Dancing Aces' and toured with it until he was called up to the join the Army in 1945. He served as a sergeant in Italy and the Middle East. During his military service he appeared in Army shows with Spike Milligan and Harry Secombe, who were later to form the Goons. In 1951, he appeared with Secombe again, when they performed on the same bill in variety. After two years of doing variety shows in Australia, Vaughan returned to Britain to appear in a summer season of shows called 'Twinkle'. By the end of the decade he was the compere of a show starring Cliff Richard. Television career Vaughan was by now becoming known as an entertainer and his big break came when he stepped into Bruce Forsyth's shoes to host Sunday Night at the London Palladium. The show was broadcast live and was a national institution, often reaching 20 million viewers. Vaughan used catch-phrases like 'swinging!' and 'dodgy!', which were accompanied by thumbs-up or thumbs- down gestures. He was a popular host for the long-running television programme (1962‚Äì1965). He also hosted The Golden Shot (during 1972 and 1973), taking over from Bob Monkhouse. Vaughan appeared in a 1960s TV advertising campaign for Cadbury's Roses chocolates which included the slogan 'Roses Grow On You'. On television, he was also a regular guest on variety and quiz shows, including Celebrity Squares, Give Us a Clue and Larry Grayson's Generation Game, as well as being compere of the BBC's Pebble Mill Showcase. Theatre career Vaughan had already launched a successful career as an actor. His stage appearances include In Order of Appearance at the Chichester Festival Theatre, a tour of Calamity Jane with Barbara Windsor and the farces A Bedful of Foreigners and No Sex Please, We're British. He also appeared in a number of pantomimes. Later years Vaughan devised the television game show Bullseye (1981), which was presented by Jim Bowen. He made few television or film appearances after 1974, other than appearing as Himself,in the Southern Television TV show 'Tell Me Another',(1976-'79);as a seaside entertainer in the sex comedy Come Play with Me (1977); playing himself, again , in Hear My Song (1991); and featuring in a TV tribute to Sir Harry Secombe (2001). He died, aged 79, in the Royal London Hospital in East London, on 17 May 2002, from injuries sustained in a road accident on 17 April, at Waterloo Bridge. Vaughan was married to Bernice, a former dancer, and they had one son, David. Norman was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium in North London on 23 May 2002 .

Rahman's lineage  Rahman Baba was a Mohmand sub- tribe of Ghoryakhel Pashtun, a group of people who migrated from Ghazni, to Nangarahar Province Afghanistan and then between 13th or 14th century to the outskirts of Peshawar.Rahman Baba, Abdu'l, Robert Sampson, and Momin Khan. The Poetry of Rahman Baba: Poet of the Pukhtuns. Translated by Robert Sampson and Momin Khan. Peshawar: University Book Agency, 2005. Rahman apparently lived peacefully in the area, and never mentions his involvement in the fierce intertribal conflicts of his day. Opinion is divided about Rahman's family background.RB-P . Several commentators are convinced that his family was village Malik (chieftains). However, Rahman Baba was more likely to have been a simple, though learned man. As he himself claimed: \\"Though the wealthy drink water from a golden cup, I prefer this clay bowl of mine.\\"D 135/9. Abdur Rahman Baba died in 1715 CE, and his tomb is housed in a large domed shrine, or mazar, on the southern outskirts of Peshawar (Ring Road Hazar Khwani). The site of his grave is a popular place for poets and mystics to collect to recite his popular poetry. In April each year, there is a larger gathering to celebrate his anniversary.  Religious background  Rahman Baba was an ascetic but various unfounded theories have been made about who Rahman's guide may have been, and to which Sufi order he was attached. Sabir suggests that Rahman had a Naqshbandi tariqa initiation in Kohat, as well as training from the sons of Pir Baba: while Schimmel and Saad Ahmed Baksh assign Rahman to the Chishti order.Annemarie Schimmel, 'Der Sufische Pakistanie', 1974, p 109 & etc Aqab, himself of the Qadiriyyah order, claims Rahman was a Qadiri. Some people claims that he (Rahman Baba) was a pure Hanafi  Published work  A collection of Rahman's poetry, called the Dƒ´wƒÅn (\\"anthology\\") of Rahman Baba, contains 343 poems, most of which are written in his native Pashto. The Dƒ´wƒÅn of Rahman Baba was in wide circulation by 1728. There are over 25 original hand-written manuscripts of the Dƒ´wƒÅn scattered in various libraries worldwide, including ten in the Pashto Academy in Peshawar, four in the British Library, three in the Biblioth√®que Nationale in Paris, as well as copies in the John Rylands Library in Manchester, the Bodleian Library in Oxford and the University Library Aligath. The first printed version was collected by the Anglican Missionary T.P. Hughes and printed in Lahore in 1877. It is this version which remains the most commonly used to this day.  Reputation  \\"Rahman Baba has received a large amount of praise. His work is regarded by many Pashtuns to be far more than poetry and next only to the Quran.\\"  Selected verses from Rahman Baba's Diwan translated into English rhyme  About 111 verses were translated into English Rhyme and published by Arbab Hidayatullah, himself a Ghoryakhel Mohmand, in 2009. The original Pashto version has been transliterated into the Roman alphabet in order to make it easier to read for those who can not read the Pashto alphabet. This translation, with a tilt to the romantic side of Rahman Baba's poetry, has been very well received. Rehman Baba Tomb located in Hazar Khwani Peshawar Shrine After his demise, poets, musicians and singers flocked to his gravesite annually. This annual congregation attained a festive status over the years which has carried on as part of Peshawar's rich cultural tradition to this day. However, on 5 March 2009, \\"militants\\" bombed Rahman Baba's tomb in Peshawar. \\"The high intensity device almost destroyed the grave, gates of a mosque, canteen and conference hall situated in the Rehman Baba Complex.

Feasibility studies began in late 2002 and were commissioned by Richard M. Daley, then mayor of Chicago. Current studies into the Mid-City Transitway utilize a dormant Beltway Railroad railway embankment just east of Cicero Avenue (Illinois Route 50) and other abandoned rail rights-of-way. The feasibility studies will help determine whether a two or four-lane highway can be built atop the embankment.

Single overhook A single overhook can be used to take an opponent down. The protagonist hooks over one arm of the opponent, simultaneously moving to that side of the opponent, often while holding the opponent's other upper arm or elbow with his other hand. He puts his weight on the opponent's hooked arm, forcing him to the ground, and then steps over the opponent's back. Double overhooks The double overhooks are generally considered inferior to double underhooks, and are often used in response to double underhooks by the opponent. If the opponent's hands can be locked to the opponent's body it is possible to advance into a bear hug, with the opponent's arms pinned.

One of the main differences between DRT-style approaches and traditional Montagovian approaches is that DRT includes a level of abstract mental representations (discourse representation structures, DRS) within its formalism, which gives it an intrinsic ability to handle meaning across sentence boundaries. DRT was created by Hans Kamp in 1981.Kamp, Hans and Reyle, U. 1993. From Discourse to Logic. Kluwer, Dordrecht. A very similar theory was developed independently by Irene Heim in 1982, under the name of File Change Semantics (FCS).

Discourse representation structures DRT uses discourse representation structures (DRS) to represent a hearer's mental representation of a discourse as it unfolds over time. There are two critical components to a DRS: * A set of discourse referents representing entities which are under discussion. * A set of DRS conditions representing information that has been given about discourse referents. Consider Sentence (1) below: :(1) A farmer owns a donkey. The DRS of (1) can be notated as (2) below: :(2) [x,y: farmer(x), donkey(y), owns(x,y)] What (2) says is that there are two discourse referents, x and y, and three discourse conditions farmer, donkey, and owns, such that the condition farmer holds of x, donkey holds of y, and owns holds of the pair x and y. Informally, the DRS in (2) is true in a given model of evaluation if and only if there are entities in that model which satisfy the conditions. So, if a model contains two individuals, and one is a farmer, the other is a donkey, and the first owns the second, the DRS in (2) is true in that model. Uttering subsequent sentences result in the existing DRS being updated. :(3) He beats it. Uttering (3) after (1) results in the DRS in (2) being updated as follows, in (4) (assuming a way to disambiguate which pronoun refers to which individual). :(4) [x,y: farmer(x), donkey(y), own(x,y), beat(x,y)] Successive utterances of sentences work in a similar way, although the process is somewhat more complicated for more complex sentences such as sentences containing negation, and conditionals. Donkey anaphora In one sense, DRT offers a variation of first-order predicate calculus ‚Äî its forms are pairs of first-order formulae and the free variables that occur in them. In traditional natural language semantics, only individual sentences are examined, but the context of a dialogue plays a role in meaning as well. For example, anaphoric pronouns such as he and she rely upon previously introduced individual constants in order to have meaning. DRT uses variables for every individual constant in order to account for this problem. A discourse is represented in a discourse representation structure (DRS), a box with variables at the top and the sentences in the formal language below in the order of the original discourse. Sub-DRS can be used for different types of sentences. One of the major advantages of DRT is its ability to account for donkey sentences (Geach 1962) in a principled fashion: :(5) Every farmer who owns a donkey beats it. Sentence (5) can be paraphrased as follows: Every farmer who owns a donkey beats the donkey that he/she owns. Under a Montagovian approach, the indefinite a donkey, which is assumed to be inherently an existential quantifier, ends up becoming a universal quantifier, an unwelcome result because the change in quantificational force cannot be accounted for in any principled way. DRT avoids this problem by assuming that indefinites introduce discourse referents (DRs) which are stored in the mental representation and are accessible (or not, depending on the conditions) to expressions like pronouns and other anaphoric elements. Furthermore, they are inherently non- quantificational, and pick up quantificational force depending upon the context. On the other hand, genuine quantifiers (e.g., 'every professor') bear scope. An 'every-NP' triggers the introduction of a complex condition of the form K1 ‚Üí K2, where K1 and K2 are sub-DRSs representing the restriction and the scope of the quantification respectively. Unlike true quantifiers, indefinite NPs just contribute a new DR (together with some descriptive material in terms of conditions on the DR), which is placed in a larger structure. This larger structure can be the top-level DRS or some sub-DRS according to the sentence-internal environment of the analyzed NP ‚Äî in other words, a level which is accessible to an anaphor that comes later.

The tower from approximately 250 metres away. 10 Holloway Circus (also referred to as the Holloway Circus Tower or Beetham Tower) is a tall mixed-use skyscraper in Birmingham city centre, England. It was originally named after the developers, Beetham Organisation, and was designed by Ian Simpson and built by Laing O'Rourke. The entire development covers an area of . It is the tallest occupied building in Birmingham and the 42nd tallest building in the United Kingdom. Features It has 39 floors, and is the second tallest structure in the city after the British Telecom Tower. The front fa√ßade of the building is floor-to-ceiling glass decorated in \\"tiger stripes\\" which are used to enhance the vertical impact. As the apartments were being furbished, an aqua coloured camouflage was also added to these windows with some of the tiger stripes being removed. Coloured lights can be seen underneath the overhang at night. The lower 19-floors are a Radisson Blu hotel, which opened to guests on 16 January 2006 whilst the upper floors were still being furnished. The upper 20 floors contain 158 apartments. There are eight circular concrete columns as well as the core on each floor. The post- tensioned flat plates of the upper floors are concrete and measure in thickness. 10 Holloway Circus received 12 points in the 2006 Emporis Skyscraper Awards placing it in eighth position in the top ten. Design and construction The plans for the development were first revealed in 1998 as part of a competition in which designs for a tower acting as a gateway to the city centre were to be submitted to the council and also for a building that could aid the regeneration plans in and around the area. The site chosen was the AEU Building, designed by The John Madin Design Group and completed in 1957, at Holloway Circus. Two serious proposals were put forward, one by CALA Homes, which consisted of two cylindrical glass towers, and the other by the Beetham Corporation, which was a single 44-storey tower with two spires on the roof producing a total height of . The Beetham Corporation won, however it was forced to scale down the towers height, due to height limits enforced after the September 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, by the Civil Aviation Authority. The spires were also removed and replaced by two cones placed on the rear of the tower on top of the stairwells. The overhang at the front was added. The proposed office space was also removed and the planning application was withdrawn. The new design was submitted, however, was withdrawn by the Beetham Corporation after talks over the purchase of the adjacent multi-storey car park with National Car Parks broke down without a deal. This was a surprise to the developers as they had expected to be able to purchase the land and had even included their plans for the site in the previous planning application. Amendments to the planning application were made and it was resubmitted in October 2000. The final design was approved by the Planning Department at Birmingham City Council with conditions on 3 April 2003 after the Beetham Corporation paid ¬£1.8 million under Section 106 to gain planning approval. A model of the tower was tested in a wind tunnel with models of surrounding buildings also being included. The ground of the model was also accurate to that of the Birmingham landscape. The model passed with few problems and construction of the tower began. Construction began in March 2003 with the erection of hoardings around the site allowing clearance work to commence and the construction of a tower crane. The concrete core then began to rise and reached a considerable height before the construction of the concrete floor panels began. The transportation of materials to the higher levels were done using a lift attached to the middle of the curved frontage. That area was intended to be used as a staircase in the case of an emergency. The building topped out in April 2005. The construction of the building encountered several problems. Not far into the construction of the lift shaft, a piece of scaffolding became dislodged and fell to the ground causing traffic delays around Holloway Circus which subsequently resulted in widespread disruption in the city centre. On 24 November 2005, 5 pieces of cladding from the higher levels on the sides became detached from the building and fell to the ground. No injuries were caused, however fear of more panels falling off caused nearby roads to be closed for an entire weekend, until the site could be declared safe by inspectors. Clips were later installed to secure the panels, and as of mid-2006, work was underway to permanently secure the panels in place using new clips. The securing of the panels was completed in late- August 2006. The Beetham Corporation could now face legal action due to the structure causing road closures and subsequent congestion. Excluding the problems with the panel clips, construction of the floors took ten months. Concrete was the primary material in the construction of the structure. The Beetham Organisation again faced legal action over claims by people who signed contracts to buy flats before the tower was completed that the flats they received did not match those described in the sales literature. As a result of technical problems within the underground car park, resident's cars were trapped for three days. Cars are placed on a platform and are taken into a space by a computer when the owner's card is swiped, however, glitches meant that people who had purchased spaces within the park either could not get access to their cars or were unable to enter the car park in their vehicles. 10 Holloway Circus faced yet more problems when, on 8 July 2007, a glass panel shattered and sent pieces raining onto the ground. The by panel on the eighth floor of Beetham Tower is believed to have shattered due to a build up of chemical compounds inside the glass. Splinters fell onto the car park roof and Smallbrook Queensway at about 6.30 am. It was the third safety incident at the tower in three years.

The name may mean \\"avenger.\\" His date of birth is not known, but he was an adult during the late 60s BC, at which time he was described by Julius Caesar as a \\"senator\\" of the Aedui. In Caesar's The Gallic War the word \\"senator\\" is used to refer to Gallic aristocrats who took part in their clans' decision-making. He supported the Aedui's preexisting alliance with Rome. Visit to Rome In 63 BC, at the age of 32, he survived the Battle of Magetobriga, where forces of the Sequani and Arverni, together with Germanic troops under the Suebi King Ariovistus, massacred the Aedui. Thereafter, the Aedui became tributary to the Sequani. Following the Aedui's defeat at Magetobriga, Diviciacus traveled to Rome and spoke before the Roman Senate to ask for military aid. While in Rome, he was a guest of Cicero, who spoke of his knowledge of divination, astronomy and natural philosophy, and names him as a druid.Cicero, De Divinatione I xli. Julius Caesar, who knew him well, noted his particular skills as a diplomat without calling him a druid. Alliance with Caesar Following Caesar's victory over the Helvetii, Diviciacus went as a prominent member of the Gallic delegation to Caesar, and was appointed as their chief spokesman. He brought the Gallic people's concerns to Caesar over Ariovistus, who had taken the lives and liberty of the Aedui, yet he also drew attention to the fact that much of the Sequani (the ancient enemies of the Aedui) lands were also being hijacked by Ariovistus.Walter, Caesar: A Biography, 158 and 161Goldsworthy, Caesar, 271 The Gaul's request provided the catalyst for the next phase of Caesar's Conquest of Gaul, when Caesar went on to confront and defeat Ariovistus. Diviciacus had a brother, Dumnorix, who was aggressively anti-Roman. Dumnorix throughout the Gallic Wars had actively sabotaged Caesar many times during his conquests because of his powerful position among the Aedui, he also conspired to take all of Gaul through his influence with the Helvetii, through the cunning statesman Orgetorix, and the Sequani. After defeating him in battle, Caesar spared his life so as to avoid antagonizing Diviciacus, who had begged Caesar not to punish his brother. Later, however, Dumnorix attempted to escape from Caesar's control and was killed in the attempt. Social positions Delamarre contends that, in addition to holding the religious office of druid, Diviciacus may have been the Uergobretos, the annually elected political leader or chief magistrate of the Aedui, one of the most powerful nations in Gaul. If true, his combination of military and religious office responsibilities in Aedua paralleled Caesar's duties among the Romans. For in Rome, Caesar was Pontifex Maximus in addition to being a magistrate and general. Diviciacus would have been Uergobretos sometime before 52 BC, when the election was contested between Convictolitavis and Cotos. The date of Diviciacus's death is not known; Cicero speaks of him in the past tense in 44 BC. Popular culture Diviciacus appears as a special Druid unit in the video game Praetorians, part of which is set during the Gallic Wars. In the game, Diviciacus serves as a healer frequently appearing on the side of Rome during the campaign. His name is spelled 'Divitiacus'. The lyrics to the Eluveitie song \\"(Do)minion\\" are written from the point of view of Diviciacus, addressed to his brother Dumnorix.

The Concert at Hajduƒçka ƒçesma) is the first live album by Yugoslav rock band Bijelo Dugme, released in 1977. The album's title refers to the band's famous concert played on August 28, 1977 near Hajduƒçka ƒçesma grounds at Ko≈°utnjak Park in Belgrade, however, the material on the record is only partially recorded at the said event. The album was polled in 1998 as the 74th on the list of 100 greatest Yugoslav rock and pop albums in the book YU 100: najbolji albumi jugoslovenske rok i pop muzike (YU 100: The Best Albums of Yugoslav Pop and Rock Music). Background During the promotional tour for the band's third studio album, 1976's Eto! Ba≈° hoƒáu!, Bijelo Dugme experienced numerous difficulties, from clashes within the band to technical problems and dwindling attendance. After spending three years at the top of the Yugoslav rock scene, the band suddenly faced a clear drop in popularity. Combined with certain hiatus due to its 25-year-old leader Goran Bregoviƒá being called up for his mandatory army service, Bijelo Dugme found itself in a bit of a rut, looking to reverse the negative trend as the tour neared its end. On suggestion from journalist and Bregoviƒá's close confidant Peca Popoviƒá, they decided to hold a large open-air concert at Belgrade's Hajduƒçka ƒçesma with free admission ‚Äî hoping to end the tour in spectacular fashion as well as to leave their fans on a positive note before temporarily disbanding due to Bregoviƒá's upcoming army duty. The concert, held on Sunday, 28 August 1977, was attended by between 70,000 and 100,000 spectators, the biggest rock concert crowd in Yugoslavia until then. After the opening acts (Slaƒëana Milo≈°eviƒá, Tako, Zdravo, D≈æad≈æo, Suncokret, Ibn Tup and Leb i Sol) Bijelo Dugme played a successful concert. However, after disappointingly realizing the show's sound recording sounded poor on tape due to technical limitations and the wide open space, the band played another show at ƒêuro ƒêakoviƒá Hall in Sarajevo on 25 October 1977, which is the actual performance heard on the album. In the end, the only part of original Hajduƒçka ƒçesma concert that ended up on the album were the crowd reactions after each song. Koncert kod Hajduƒçke ƒçesme would turn out to be the band's last album with keyboardist Laza Ristovski and drummer Ipe Ivandiƒá, for the time being at least, as the two decided to leave the group after releasing a side project of their own, album Sti≈æemo (Here We Come) in 1978. Both eventually rejoined Bijelo Dugme; Ivandiƒá in 1982 and Ristovski in 1984.

Marvel Comics Powers and abilities Mr. Immortal is a mutant with the power of immortality, which allows his body to regenerate from any injury, including ones that would normally kill ordinary humans. Although injuries that are sufficiently traumatic appear to kill him at least initially, his regenerative power causes him to return to life in anywhere from ten minutes to a matter of seconds. This rapid healing only manifests itself in response to nominally fatal injuries: when non-fatally injured, he heals at a normal human rate, though such injuries tend to rapidly heal the next time he dies. This ability seems to be unconscious, since he has tried to commit suicide on numerous occasions only to walk away unscathed afterwards. He has recovered from being shot, suffocated, stabbed, drowned, crushed, starved, dehydrated, exploded, poisoned, decapitated, irradiated, and incinerated. Upon revival he is often extremely enraged due to the pain of death. During Dinah Soar's tenure as his teammate, she can utter a vocalization, inaudible to humans, that can bring him out of this state, which Flatman speculated is hypersonic in nature. Mr. Immortal's body does not age. While most mutants' powers manifest at adolescence, Mr. Immortal's ability did not become apparent until he first attempted suicide. He regained consciousness minutes after, only to find that he was fully healed and still alive. Deathurge once explained to him that he is a mutant, but not Homo sapiens superior, the more familiar subspecies of mutant who has simply taken the next step in evolution, but rather he is the final step in human evolution: a man who has evolved past death itself, and is therefore Homo sapiens supreme. He also explained that he will be around until the end of the universe, and the one to whom its final secret will be revealed. As seen during certain fights in West Coast Avengers #46 and Great Lakes Avengers #4, Mr. Immortal appears to be highly acrobatic and athletic in addition to his mutant power. In other media Craig Hollis / Mister Immortal was set to appear in the Marvel Television live-action New Warriors TV series played by Derek Theler before it was cancelled.

Attraction facts * Renamed: ** Discovery River Taxi (November, 1998) ** Radio Disney River Cruise (March 1999) Ride History and present status The boats docked at the Safari Village and in Asia. The ride was a non-stop trip that brought the passengers near to the Tree of Life and past all the lands of the theme park. During the journey, the guests would be shown small animals that had been brought on board. The captain would walk the aisles and point out other items on the trek. The ride was similar to the Jungle Cruise at the Magic Kingdom, however there was little to see exclusive to the ride. These handful of scenes included a fire-breathing dragon's cave outside Camp Minnie Mickey (intended as a preview for the unbuilt Beastly Kingdom), geysers in Africa, and a bathing Iguanodon outside of Dinoland USA. In 1999 the attraction was renamed Radio Disney River Cruise and played commentary from Radio Disney DJs Just Plain Mark and Zippy. The guests were told that the songs were broadcast from the top of the Tree of Life. The boats were all re-painted in new colors, and animals were no longer brought on board. The routes were also modified, with boats returning to the departing dock instead of stopping at the other dock for guests to disembark. The ride closed in late summer 1999 due to large numbers of disappointed guests who had not realized that the ride's original purpose was transportation and showed a minimal number of animals that, with the exception of the Banteng, could all be seen from the paths surrounding the Tree of Life. The docks, however, can still be seen in the park. The Asia dock is now a Baloo and King Louie meet and greet with the other dock now used as a prop. The boats are still on Disney property sitting in their maintenance dock in a cast-only area on Marina Alley behind Primeval Whirl and Finding Nemo ‚Äì The Musical. Two of the boats were later moved to the Magic Kingdom resort area on Bay Lake and the Seven Seas Lagoon, where they were repurposed for a pirate-themed fireworks cruise. The names of these two boats have been changed to ‚ÄúCalm Seas‚Äù and ‚ÄúFair Winds.‚Äù They were also repainted to better suit their new role.

Celebrezze Federal Building (also known as the Federal Office Building, the Celebrezze Building, or the Federal Building for short) is a skyscraper located in downtown Cleveland, Ohio. Design The building was designed by the firms of Outcault, Guenther, Rode & Bonebrake, Schafer, Flynn & Van Dijk, and Dalton, Dalton, Little, and Newport,Emporis.com: Federal Building. Accessed 2007-05-21. The building has 32 stories, rises to a height of , of space, and is located at 1240 East 9th Street. Huber Hunt and Nicols served as general architects and contractors. It was completed in 1967 and houses U.S. government agency offices. History Named after Cleveland's 49th mayor, United States Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare and Federal appeals judge Anthony J. Celebrezze, the Federal Building is typical of the modern, commercial office buildings of the 1960s. It displays strength in design through a purity and rich variety of materials. When construction began, protesters demonstrated against the lack of minority contractors. Problems with the foundation delayed construction. As the building was being built, a piece of the building's stainless-steel skin fell, hitting a parked car on Lakeside Avenue. As Federal agencies were moving in 1967-68, a fire hose on the 25th floor burst and water caused damage. Appearance The building is wrapped in a skin of stainless steel and glass. It is lifted by a base of four recessed rectilinear marble volumes, resting upon a field of rough cut slate and granite. Walls of glass stretch taut between two larger end volumes, creating an interior lobby and plazas to the east and west with the smaller volumes encasing double-sided elevator shafts. Plot Construction for the Federal Building began with the demolition of the Old Central Armory and the Cuyahoga County Morgue. The Armory building was designed by Lehman and Schmitt and constructed in 1896. It was made in a late Victorian style with a Gothic exterior. The Morgue, constructed in 1894, showed examples of Egyptian Revival architecture. Renovations Between 2003 and 2006, The Cleveland Federal Building massively renovated its entrances. The original entrances were cold and foreboding, but have recently been glass- enclosed and modernized for today's security and comfort. When the Federal Building opened in 1967, the biggest problem was winds off Lake Erie. People would have to hold on by pull ropes on the railings of the steps. In Cleveland's brutal winters of 1976‚Äì77 and 1977‚Äì78, the GSA placed plexiglass covers for shielding due to winds. In 2008, a new fire alarm system was installed, leaks in the roof over the underground cafeteria were repaired, and new landscaping was installed. In 2011 work began on a new exterior which will increase the energy efficiency of the building. Funding for the $121 million project came from the 2009 economic stimulus package. In 2002, the Cleveland FBI office, which serves Northeast Ohio, moved from the Federal Building to its own offices a block away due to safety and security logistics. When the FBI arrested a criminal, they had to ride in the same elevators as people who had business in the building. Federal agencies with offices in the building include the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, the Coast Guard Ninth District Command Center, recruiting offices for the Armed Forces, the Small Business Administration, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Social Security Administration.

History  It was one of four Carolingian foundations intended to establish Christianity in the region of the Odenwald (the others were the monasteries of Lorsch, Fulda and Mosbach). According to legend, a Gaugraf named Ruthard called the Frankish bishop, Saint Pirmin, to the area to set up a monastic settlement with chapel west of today's town, at the entrance to the Otterbachtal. A disciple of Pirmin, an Aquitanian called \\"Amor\\" supposedly then moved the monastery to its current location in 734. By 800 it had become a Reichsabtei, the abbot being directly answerable to Charlemagne. Pepin united it to the Bishopric of W√ºrzburg, although control of it was much disputed by the Bishops of Mainz. The abbey played an important role in the clearing and settlement of the vast tracts of forest in which it was located, and in the evangelisation of other areas, notably Saxony: many of the abbots of the missionary centre of Verden an der Aller - later to become the Bishops of Verden - had previously been monks at Amorbach. It was severely damaged by the invasions of the Hungarians in the 10th century. In 1446, the priest Johannes Keck brought reliquaries of a \\"Saint Amor\\" and a \\"Saint Landrada\\" from M√ºnsterbilsen near Maastricht to the church Amorbrunn, which started to attract pilgrims. In particular after the end of the Thirty Years' War in 1648, people came in search of help for childlessness. In 1525 the abbey buildings were stormed and plundered during the German Peasants' War by forces under the command of G√∂tz von Berlichingen. During the Thirty Years' War the abbey was attacked by the Swedes in 1632, was dissolved for a short time between 1632 and 1634 and the lands taken by a local landowner, and although it was afterwards restored and the lands regained, there followed a period of decline and poverty. In 1656 the Bishops of Mainz and W√ºrzburg reached agreement: Amorbach was transferred into the control, both spiritual and territorial, of the Archbishop of Mainz, and significant building works followed. Likely appearance of the abbey, c. 1735 In the 1740s the site was completely refurbished in the late Baroque/early Rococo style, of which it remains a significant example, under the supervision of Maximilian von Welsch. From 1742-4 the Abteikirche was built, incorporating the two six-storied west towers (12th century). Further extensive construction and decoration was undertaken in the 1780s, including in 1782 the installation of what was at the time the biggest organ in the world. The patrons were the Virgin Mary, with Saints Simplicius, Faustinus and Beatrix.  Dissolution  The abbey was finally dissolved in 1803 and given with its lands to the Princes of Leiningen as compensation for lost territories occupied in 1793 by French revolutionary troops. Until 1806, a separate F√ºrstentum Leiningen with the √Ñmter Mosbach, Buchen, Ostburken, K√∂nigsheim and Gr√ºnfeld, was based on Amorbach. The princes left the abbey church to the (Protestant) parish and converted the other monastic buildings into a Residenz. Jurisdiction over the abbey and its territories passed to the government of the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1816. Description Interior of the abbey church =Abbey church= Welsch put a massive fa√ßade made from Buntsandstein before the Romanesque towers, on the pediment he placed a statue of Saint Benedict. The elevated main portal is reached by two large stairs with railings ornamented with statues of Jesus, Mary, Zechariah, Elisabeth, Joachim and Anne. A niche in the wall holds a figure of Saint Beatrix. The interior features stucco work and frescoes in late Baroque/early Rococo style by members of the Wessobrunner School. The main painter was Matth√§us G√ºnther. The story of Saint Benedict features prominently in the frescoes. The side aisles contain altars dedicated to Saint Joseph, Magdalena, Agnes and others. One of them is dedicated to the Bishops of Verden Suitbert, Patto and Issinger, who were monks from Amorbach according to the Verden chronicles. The high altar has six red marble columns supporting black beams topped by a Holy Trinity. G√ºnther's main altar picture shows the arrival of Mary in Heaven, flanked by life-sized statues of her parents, Joachim and Anne. The stucco-workers who made the ceiling above also added the altars in the northern and southern transept in 1747. The choir screen from wrought iron was made in 1748-50 by Marx Gattinger from W√ºrzburg, who had also worked with Oegg on the fence in front of the W√ºrzburg Residence. The gold- covered pulpit, by Johann Wolfgang van der Auvera, from 1749 is already more Rococo than Baroque. Organ An important feature of the church is its Stumm organ. It was built in 1776-82, by Johann Philipp Stumm (1705‚Äì1776) and Johann Heinrich Stumm (1715‚Äì1788) of the organ-building . In their work at Amorbach, this style and Klangideal (\\"sound-ideal\\"), a synthesis of Southern German and French organ building, could be thoroughly realized. The work's original sound-producing hardware remained unchanged for more than two centuries. In the final years of the 19th century and on into the early 20th century, a number of further organ stops were added according to the preferences of the time. Behind the organ's 16-field fa√ßade with its 124 sounding and up to seven-metre-tall organ pipes are found several ranks of pipes in their original configuration and piping on the slider chest, reconstructed in 1982. All 14 pedal ranks are freestanding behind it. Furthermore, also standing there, in three levels, is the swell box, added in 1982, along with its attendant works. It contains an assembly of ranks added after 1868, with one dedicated to the sound of French Romantic organ music. The organ has 5,116 pipes and 30 percussion devices shared across 66 stops, and is played from four manuals and one pedalboard. =Residence buildings= Amorbach Abbey Rooms in the residence include the Green Hall, in Neoclassical style, which is used as a concert hall. The library is a two-storied room with a gallery. It contains the abbey library from 1790 in addition to the collection of the Princes of Leiningen. The stairway- and gallery-railings were made by J.B. Berg in 1797/8. The ceiling fresco by Conrad Huber (1798) shows allegories of wisdom, virtue and science. Today The family of Leiningen still live here today.  Media  The Stumm organ of Amorbach Abbey was filmed in November 2005 in performances by John Scott Whiteley of music by J S Bach. The films will form part of the BBC's 21st Century Bach series, for transmission in 2007 and subsequent DVD release.

Intel TXT uses a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) and cryptographic techniques to provide measurements of software and platform components so that system software as well as local and remote management applications may use those measurements to make trust decisions. It complements Intel Management Engine. This technology is based on an industry initiative by the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) to promote safer computing. It defends against software-based attacks aimed at stealing sensitive information by corrupting system or BIOS code, or modifying the platform's configuration.  Details  The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) as specified by the TCG provides many security functions including special registers (called Platform Configuration Registers ‚Äì PCRs) which hold various measurements in a shielded location in a manner that prevents spoofing. Measurements consist of a cryptographic hash using a Secure Hashing Algorithm (SHA); the TPM v1.0 specification uses the SHA-1 hashing algorithm. More recent TPM versions (v2.0+) call for SHA-2. A desired characteristic of a cryptographic hash algorithm is that (for all practical purposes) the hash result (referred to as a hash digest or a hash) of any two modules will produce the same hash value only if the modules are identical. = Measurements = Measurements can be of code, data structures, configuration, information, or anything that can be loaded into memory. TCG requires that code not be executed until after it has been measured. To ensure a particular sequence of measurements, hash measurements in a sequence are not written to different PCRs, but rather a PCR is \\"extended\\" with a measurement. This means that the TPM takes the current value of the PCR and the measurement to be extended, hashes them together, and replaces the content of the PCR with that hash result. The effect is that the only way to arrive at a particular measurement in a PCR is to extend exactly the same measurements in exactly the same order. Therefore, if any module being measured has been modified, the resulting PCR measurement will be different and thus it is easy to detect if any code, configuration, data, etc. that has been measured had been altered or corrupted. The PCR extension mechanism is crucial to establishing a Chain of trust in layers of software (see below). = Chain of trust = The technology supports both a static chain of trust and a dynamic chain of trust. The static chain of trust starts when the platform powers on (or the platform is reset), which resets all PCRs to their default value. For server platforms, the first measurement is made by hardware (i.e., the processor) to measure a digitally signed module (called an Authenticated Code Module or ACM) provided by the chipset manufacturer. The processor validates the signature and integrity of the signed module before executing it. The ACM then measures the first BIOS code module, which can make additional measurements. The measurements of the ACM and BIOS code modules are extended to PCR0, which is said to hold the static core root of trust measurement (CRTM) as well as the measurement of the BIOS Trusted Computing Base (TCB). The BIOS measures additional components into PCRs as follows: * PCR0 ‚Äì CRTM, BIOS code, and Host Platform Extensions * PCR1 ‚Äì Host Platform Configuration * PCR2 ‚Äì Option ROM Code * PCR3 ‚Äì Option ROM Configuration and Data * PCR4 ‚Äì IPL (Initial Program Loader) Code (usually the Master Boot Record ‚Äì MBR) * PCR5 ‚Äì IPL Code Configuration and Data (for use by the IPL Code) * PCR6 ‚Äì State Transition and Wake Events * PCR7 ‚Äì Host Platform Manufacturer Control The dynamic chain of trust starts when the operating system invokes a special security instruction, which resets dynamic PCRs (PCR17‚Äì22) to their default value and starts the measured launch. The first dynamic measurement is made by hardware (i.e., the processor) to measure another digitally signed module (referred to as the SINIT ACM) which is also provided by the chipset manufacturer and whose signature and integrity are verified by the processor. This is known as the Dynamic Root of Trust Measurement (DRTM). The SINIT ACM then measures the first operating system code module (referred to as the measured launch environment ‚Äì MLE). Before the MLE is allowed to execute, the SINIT ACM verifies that the platform meets the requirements of the Launch Control Policy (LCP) set by the platform owner. LCP consists of three parts: # Verifying that the SINIT version is equal or newer than the value specified # Verifying that the platform configuration (PCONF) is valid by comparing PCR0‚Äì7 to known-good values (the platform owner decides which PCRs to include) # Verifying that the MLE is valid, by comparing its measurement to a list of known-good measurements. The integrity of the LCP and its lists of known-good measurements are protected by storing a hash measurement of the policy in the TPM in a protected non-volatile location that can only be modified by the platform owner. = Execute as a Trusted OS = Once the LCP is satisfied, the SINIT ACM allows the MLE to execute as a Trusted OS by enabling access to special security registers and enabling TPM Locality 2 level access. The MLE is now able to make additional measurements to the dynamic PCRs. The dynamic PCRs contain measurement of: * PCR17 ‚Äì DRTM and launch control policy * PCR18 ‚Äì Trusted OS start-up code (MLE) * PCR19 ‚Äì Trusted OS (for example OS configuration) * PCR20 ‚Äì Trusted OS (for example OS Kernel and other code) * PCR21 ‚Äì as defined by the Trusted OS * PCR22 ‚Äì as defined by the Trusted OS The technology also provides a more secure way for the operating system to initialize the platform. In contrast to the normal processor initialization [which involved the boot-strap-processor (BSP) sending a Start-up Inter-Processor Interrupt (SIPI) to each Application Processor, thus starting each processor in \\"real mode\\" and then transitioning to \\"virtual mode\\" and finally to \\"protected mode\\"], the operating system avoids that vulnerability by performing a secure launch (a.k.a. measured launch) which puts the Application Processors in a special sleep state from which they are directly started in protected mode with paging on, and are not allowed to leave this state.  Application  PCR values are available both locally and remotely. Furthermore, the TPM has the capability to digitally sign the PCR values (i.e., a PCR Quote) so that any entity can verify that the measurements come from, and are protected by, a TPM, thus enabling Remote Attestation to detect tampering, corruption, and malicious software. Additionally, those values can be used to identify the execution environment (the particular BIOS version, OS level, configuration, etc.) and compare them to their own lists of known-good values to further categorize the platform. This ability to evaluate and assign trust levels to platforms is known as Trusted Compute Pools. Some examples of how Trusted Compute Pools are used: * Isolation ‚Äì the ability to control if a platform connects to the production network or is quarantined based on its trust level or failure to pass its launch control policy. * Trust Based Policy ‚Äì such as restricting critical apps to only execute on platforms that meet a specified trust level * Compliance and Auditing ‚Äì demonstrating that critical, personal, or sensitive data has only been processed on platforms that meet trust requirements Numerous server platforms include Intel TXT, and TXT functionality is leveraged by software vendors including HyTrust, PrivateCore, Citrix, and VMware. Open-source projects also utilize the TXT functionality; for example, tboot provides a TXT-based integrity system for the Linux kernel and Xen hypervisor.

The linea aspera is a prominent longitudinal ridge or crest, on the middle third of the bone, presenting a medial and a lateral lip, and a narrow rough, intermediate line. It is an important insertion point for the adductors and the lateral and medial intermuscular septa that divides the thigh into three compartments. The tension generated by muscle attached to the bones is responsible for the formation of the ridges. Structure =Above= Above, the linea aspera is prolonged by three ridges. * The lateral ridge is very rough, and runs almost vertically upward to the base of the greater trochanter. It is termed the gluteal tuberosity, and gives attachment to part of the gluteus maximus: its upper part is often elongated into a roughened crest, on which a more or less well-marked, rounded tubercle, the third trochanter, is occasionally developed. * The intermediate ridge or pectineal line is continued to the base of the lesser trochanter and gives attachment to the pectineus; * the medial ridge is lost in the intertrochanteric line; between the intermediate and medial ridges a portion of the Iliacus is inserted. =Below= Below, the linea aspera is prolonged into two ridges, enclosing between them a triangular area, the popliteal surface, upon which the popliteal artery rests. * Of these two ridges, the lateral is the more prominent, and descends to the summit of the lateral condyle. * The medial is less marked, especially at its upper part, where it is crossed by the femoral artery. It ends below at the summit of the medial condyle, in a small tubercle, the adductor tubercle, which affords insertion to the tendon of the adductor magnus. =Development= The tension generated by muscle attached to the bones is responsible for the formation of the ridges. Function A number of muscles attach to the linea aspera: * From the medial lip of the linea aspera and its prolongations above and below, the vastus medialis originates. * From the lateral lip and its upward prolongation, the vastus lateralis takes origin. * The adductor magnus is inserted into the linea aspera, and to its lateral prolongation above, and its medial prolongation below. * Between the vastus lateralis and the adductor magnus two muscles are attached: ** the gluteus maximus inserted above, ** and the short head of the biceps femoris originating below. * Between the adductor magnus and the vastus medialis four muscles are inserted: ** the iliacus and pectineus above; ** the adductor brevis and adductor longus below. The linea aspera is perforated a little below its center by the nutrient canal, which is directed obliquely upward.

It operates a fleet of diesel buses. A total of 25 bus routes serve St. John's and its western suburbs of Mount Pearl and Paradise, carrying 2.9m passengers in 2016.Metrobus Statistics History Metrobus Transit was established in 1958, and is operated by the St. John's Transportation Commission, a board consisting of six members and a chair, appointed by St John's City Council. Metrobus Transit currently operates 22 routes. Routes travel around the cities of St. John's and Mount Pearl and service major destinations including the Avalon Mall, Village Shopping Centre, Memorial University, Confederation Building, College of the North Atlantic, Marine Institute, Mile One Centre, and downtown St. John's. An experimental extension of the Metrobus network into Paradise has also begun as of 2016, with a new route providing access to a hub at the Double Ice Complex arena. June 27, 2016 In recent years, Metrobus was plagued by two strikes in 2004 and 2010 respectively. The first of those strikes lasted roughly two weeks, and wages were the key issue in that dispute; while the introduction of a 50/50 cost-sharing health benefit system was the key issue in the 2010 dispute. The latter dispute lasted about three months, and was settled with a modest pay hike on January 27, 2011. In 2006, Metrobus Transit upgraded its fare system to use a smart card system called the m-Card, which replaces tickets and monthly passes with a reloadable card and offers a points and rewards loyalty program.m-Card November 7, 2010 In 2012, Metrobus Transit acquired nine new fully accessible Nova LFS Smart Buses and plan to purchase twenty-one additional buses by 2017. The Smart Bus technology on these buses can improve fuel economy by up to 18% and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. From the outside, the new buses look very similar to the other 23 low-floor buses already in its fleet, however, are fully accessible and include a wheelchair ramp and other related equipment.Metrobus Transit takes delivery of nine new fully accessible low-floor buses February 24, 2012.

Prior to 1870 the area was heavy woodland, but the opening of the Penrhiwceiber Colliery in 1878 saw its rapid expansion into a thriving village. Etymology Penrhiwceiber, according to Thomas Morgan in his 1887 publication, should be worded as Pen-Rhiw-Cae-Byr - 'Top of the hill of the little field'. Other thoughts refer to the word ceiber, which means joist, beam or rafter and may suggest a place where timber was plentiful, which would certainly describe the area, which was a heavy woodland, before the coming of the coal trade.  History  Penrhiwceiber was once a heavily wooded area with steep sloping mountainsides up until the last 20 years of the 19th century. According to the 1871 Census Records the village of Penrhiwceiber is not listed, however in 1881 the Census lists a number of streets within the village of Penrhiwceiber, notably Railway Terrace, Cynon Terrace, Glanlay Street and Penrhiwceiber Road. This rapid growth was connected to the burgeoning coal trade and the construction of the Penrikyber Colliery in 1878. The sinking of the colliery was first attempted in 1872 by a Mr. Thomas of Cwmbach on behalf of a group of businessmen who set themselves up as the Penrhiwceiber Navigation Collieries Company. After facing problems such as running water and soft sand beds, the first commercial coal was raised from the mine in 1879, though the pit was serviced by a simple wooden headgear with a single rope. Growth was rapid, and in an 1896 report by the Inspector of Mines, the colliery was employing 1,463 men. By 1908, that number was close to 1,800. In 1909 the colliery suffered a pit fire which saw the lives of 30 men saved by the actions of the fire brigade. There was one fatality. The school primary school in the area is Penrhiwceibr Primary School (Welsh: Ysgol Gynradd Penrhiwceibr) which was originally built in 1881 and which provides further evidence as to the rapid growth of the village, with its having to be enlarged on three separate occasions: in 1893, 1895 and 1901. This growth was to continue into the 20th century until in 1920 the Kelly's Trade Directory was able to list over one hundred commercial properties for Penrhiwceiber, as well as railway stations (Penrhiwceiber railway station) on both the Great Western and Taff Vale railways, religious buildings including Carmel Chapel (1880), Moriah Chapel, Bethel Eglwys-y-Wesleyaid (1884), Saint Winifred's Church (Welsh: Eglwys Santes Gwenffrewi) (1883), and the Penrhiwceiber Workmen's Hall and Institute (Welsh: Neuadd a Sefydliad y Gweithwyr Penrhiwceibr) built in 1888. In Penrhiwceiber there is a clock tower memorial that was erected in memory of those who died while serving in World War I, World War II and the Korean War. Penrhiwceiber Workmen's Hall and Institute (Welsh: Sefydliad a Neuadd y Gweithwyr Penrhiwceibr) was opened in the village in 1888 and restored in 1992. It remains one of the most prominent landmarks in the village. The former public library, on Rheola Street, closed in 2014. Coal mining Penrhiwceiber was an important area for coal mining for the first half of the 20th century, it was home to two Coal Mines, which were: * Penrhiwceibr Colliery - Begun in 1872 by a Mr. Thomas of Cwmbach, at one point in 1923 there were over 2200 employees, but Penrhiwceiber Colliery closed on 8 October 1985. * Cwm Cynon Colliery - Begun in 1889 it closed in 1949, in 1945 there were 644 people employed there. At its peak there were 1950 people working there. Where Penrhiwceiber Colliery once sat, is now a local park and football and rugby fields which is locally known as Glasbrook Field. Where the Cwm Cynon Colliery once sat is now an industrial park and an industrial estate with few factories known as (English: Cwm Cynon Business Park) and the Ystad Ddiwydiannol Cwm Cynon (English: Cwm Cynon Industrial Estate). Religion War Memorial and Clock Tower Penrhiwceiber falls within the historic Parish of Llanwynno, Church in Wales. The local St Winifred's Church (Welsh: Eglwys Santes Gwenffrewi) was built in 1883. The other church, All Saints (Tyntetown), was built in 1903 to serve the two communities of Tyntetown and Ynysboeth. Originally a daughter church of Penrhiwceiber, it became an independent parish fairly early on, before rejoining Penrhiwceiber in 1972.penrhiwceiber.org welcome to our new website! There used to be a Salvation Army corps in the village. There were a number of nonconformist chapels at Penrhiwceiber including Jerusalem (Baptist), Carmel (Independent) and Hermon (Calvinistic Methodist). Penrhiwceiber is home to Cylch Meithrin Penrhiwceiber which is a Welsh language pre-school for local children. Penrhiwceiber is generally known as \\"Ceiber\\" to the locals. To the east of the village lies Mynydd Twyn Brynbychan which is around 1,500 ft above sea level, the village is one of the steepest in Wales, and possibly the United Kingdom. The community and electoral ward of Penrhiwceiber includes both the village itself as well as the districts of Perthcelyn and Miskin. Governance Penrhiwceiber is also the name of the electoral ward which is coterminous with the community. The ward elects two county councillors to Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council. The ward has been represented since 1995 by both Labour Party and Plaid Cymru councillors, though both councillors were from Labour between 2004 and 2017.Rhondda Cyon Taff County Borough Council Election Results 1995-2012, The Election Centre.

It seats approximately 1,500 people. Building It was designed by James Robinson Watson, chief assistant in the office of Leeds- based architect George Corson, and opened on 18 November 1878. It was built as a complex in three parts: the theatre, a set of six shops and Assembly Rooms, all facing onto New Briggate, in High Victorian style of red brick with stone dressings and a slate roof, the whole being a Grade II* listed building. The exterior is in a mixture of Romanesque and Scottish baronial styles, and the interior has such Gothic motifs as fan-vaulting and clustered columns. The auditorium and assembly room ceilings are by John Wormald Appleyard. History Leeds Grand Theatre Blue Plaque The Assembly Rooms were modified to create a cinema, which opened in 1907 as the Assembly Rooms Cinema, the name being changed to Plaza in 1958. The cinema closed in 1958 and it became rehearsal rooms. In 1970 it was bought by Leeds City Council and restored, becoming the home of Opera North in 1978. For many years it was programmed by Howard & Wyndham Ltd and staged plays, musicals, pantomime and revues. The theatre closed at the end of May 2005 for a major refurbishment, transformation, and it reopened on 7 October 2006 with a production of Verdi's Rigoletto. The Stalls area was completely re-seated and re-raked, the orchestra-pit enlarged, technical facilities dramatically improved, and improvements to Opera North to the south of the theatre, accessible via a bridge and at street-level, which includes two new stage-sized rehearsal spaces and increased office space. The cost of the refurbishment has been estimated at ¬£31.5 million. A second phase of transformation included the restoration of the Assembly Rooms, making a second performance space, the Howard Assembly Room, which is used for recitals, concerts, chamber operas, experimental and educational work and other events for which the main theatre is unsuitable. Present use Interior The theatre is a large scale receiving house and hosts touring productions of West End and Broadway musicals and plays, comedians and music. The theatre is home to Opera North and is regularly visited by Northern Ballet. It has hosted many touring productions, musical artists and comedians. Since the \\"transformation\\" at the theatre, particularly after a state-of-the-art automated flying system was introduced, the theatre has been more able to host larger West End Musicals and plays. Recent productions at the theatre have included: The Phantom Of The Opera, Dirty Dancing, Shrek The Musical, Oliver, We Will Rock You and Wicked. Leeds grand theatre hosted the world stage premier of Kay Mellor's Band Of Gold in November 2019.

He obtained a geology degree at the University of Southampton and later studied vertebrate palaeontology under British palaeontologist David Martill at the University of Portsmouth, where he obtained both an M. Phil. and PhD. He is founder of the blog Tetrapod Zoology, created in 2006. Research Though initially beginning his research career in palaeontology with the intention of working on fossil marine reptiles, Naish became known for his doctoral work on the basal tyrannosauroid theropod Eotyrannus, a dinosaur that he, together with Steve Hutt and colleagues, named in 2001. He has published articles on the Wealden Supergroup theropods Thecocoelurus, Calamospondylus and Aristosuchus. With Martill and Dino Frey, he named a new illegally acquired Brazilian compsognathid theropod Mirischia. In 2004, Naish and Gareth Dyke reinterpreted the controversial Romanian fossil Heptasteornis. Suggested by other authors to be a giant owl, troodontid or dromaeosaurid, it was argued by Naish and Dyke to be an alvarezsaurid, and as such is the first member of this group to be reported from Europe. Other fragmentary European alvarezsaurid specimens have since been reported. Naish has also published work on sauropod dinosaurs, pterosaurs, fossil marine reptiles, turtles, marine mammals and other fossil vertebrates, and he has also produced articles on other aspects of zoology. He published a series of articles on poorly known cetaceans during the 1990s and in 2004 published a review article on the giant New Zealand gecko Hoplodactylus delcourti. In 2004 Naish and colleagues described a giant Isle of Wight sauropod dinosaur that appears closely related to the North American brachiosaurid Sauroposeidon, and informally referred to as Angloposeidon. Prior to the 2006 description of Turiasaurus from Spain, this was the largest dinosaur reported from Europe. In 2005 he coauthored the description of the new Cretaceous turtle Araripemys arturi, and in 2006 he and David Martill published a revision of the South American crested pterosaurs Tupuxuara and Thalassodromeus. During 2007 and 2008, Naish and Martill published a major revision of British dinosaurs; Naish also published work with Barbara S√°nchez-Hern√°ndez and Michael J. Benton on the vertebrate fossils of Galve in Spain. The Galve fossils are significant in including istiodactylid pterosaurs, heterodontosaurids and spinosaurines. In 2007, Naish co-authored the description of the new sauropod Xenoposeidon with fellow Portsmouth-based palaeontologist Mike P. Taylor. In 2008 he published an evaluation of azhdarchid pterosaurs with Mark Witton, in which they argued that azhdarchids were stork- or ground hornbill-like generalists, foraging in diverse environments for small animals and carrion. Along with his colleagues Mike Taylor and Matt Wedel he published a paper on sauropod neck posture in 2008. In 2010 Naish published a paper on the theoretical flotation abilities of giraffes. In 2011 Hone, Naish and Cuthill published a paper on mutual selection in dinosaurs and pterosaurs In 2013, Naish described Vectidraco daisymorrisae, a small azhdarchoid pterosaur from the Isle of Wight. Also in 2013 Naish and Witton published a follow-up to their 2008 paper on terrestrial stalking in azhdarchid pterosaurs. In 2015 Naish and colleagues published on a new, as yet unnamed, Transylvanian pterosaur taxon. In 2017, a new species of pycnodont fish, Scalacurvichthys naishi, was named after Naish. Publications Illustration of the prehistoric marine reptile Helveticosaurus by Naish Naish has published several popular books on prehistoric animals including Dinosaurs: How They Lived and Evolved co- authored with Paul Barrett (Natural History Museum 2016) Dinosaur Record Breakers (Carlton Kids 2018), the Dorling Kindersley Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs and Prehistoric Life (2003, with David Lambert and Elizabeth Wyse), the Palaeontological Association book Dinosaurs of the Isle of Wight (2001, with David Martill) and the highly acclaimed BBC Walking with Dinosaurs: The Evidence (2000, with David Martill), produced to accompany the TV series Walking with Dinosaurs. In 2010, he published The Great Dinosaur Discoveries as sole author. In 2017 Naish published Evolution in Minutes a book answering fundamental questions on the topic of evolution through a collection of mini- essays. Naish has also published several books on cryptozoology, including Hunting Monsters: Cryptozoology and the Reality Behind the Myths and Cryptozoologicon: Volume I with John Conway and C. M. Kosemen. His name is also attached to several children's books on prehistoric animals. Naish is an associate editor for the journal Cretaceous Research and was also on the editorial board of the journal The Cryptozoology Review. He acts as a regular book reviewer for the Palaeontological Association. =Bibliography= * Naish, D. 2019.

Media appearances Naish has appeared widely on British television, having featured on BBC News 24, Channel 4's Sunday Brunch, Richard and Judy, and Live from Dinosaur Island,, as well as the documentary How to build a dinosaur. He appeared on a Channel 4 discussion programme on cryptozoology, presented by journalist Jon Ronson, during the late 1990s. Naish's research on the giant Isle of Wight sauropod \\"Angloposeidon\\", on the pterosaur Tupuxuara, and on the sauropod Xenoposeidon was widely reported in the news media, as was his research paper on floating giraffes. Naish has been featured in several stories about so-called mystery carcasses including the Montauk Monster, San Diego Demonoid, Beast of Exmoor, and a Russian mystery monster carcass. He emphasises the effects of taphonomy in making familiar animals unrecognisable. Among the popular books by Naish that were widely featured in the media were the Cryptozoologicon and All Yesterdays.  Tetrapod Zoology Naish with Matt Wedel and Mike P. Taylor, the three writers of SVPOW TetZooCon 2015, London Wetland Centre In 2006, Naish started a weblog, Tetrapod Zoology, that covered various aspects of zoology. In 2007 he joined the ScienceBlogs network. In July 2011, the blog moved to the Scientific American blog network, as of 31 July 2018 the blog has moved away from Scientific American and is hosted independently. Tetrapod Zoology seems to cover most subjects concerning tetrapods. Popular subjects commonly written about include frogs, reptiles, mammals, birds, dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and cryptozoology. Together with colleagues Michael P. Taylor and Mathew Wedel, Naish also contributes to the Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the Week blog. In 2010, Naish published a collection of early articles from Tetrapod Zoology as a book titled Tetrapod Zoology Book One. =Tetrapod Zoology Podcast= The Tetrapod Zoology Podcast was launched on 1 February 2013 and is the official podcast of the TetZooVerse. The podcast covers all things tetrapod and vertebrate palaeontology. The podcast is hosted by Naish and co-host John Conway, For episode 15 the regular hosts were joined by Memo Kosemen, co-author and artist of Cryptozoologicon. =Tetrapod Zoology Convention= TetZooCon is an annual meeting themed around the contents of the Tetrapod Zoology blog. The convention was first held on 12 June 2014 and has taken places in various venues in London. The convention involves talks on a variety of subjects, ranging from palaeontology to cryptozoology, as well as workshops. The convention is organised by Naish and Conway; Darren traditionally gives a talk himself, whereas John Conway hosts a workshop.

Although the mountain is not outstanding for its elevation, it is very rugged and has excellent views of the surrounding lakes, mountains, and forests. Mount Chocorua's bare summit can be seen from almost every direction and identified from many points throughout central New Hampshire and western Maine. Many hiking trails ascend the mountain. Scenic Chocorua Lake lies directly to the south. Geography Mount Chocorua is in the town of Albany and is the easternmost peak of the Sandwich Range in New Hampshire's White Mountain National Forest. The Sandwich Range is located north of the Lakes Region and south of the Kancamagus Highway. The range extends about east-west from Conway on the Saco River to Campton on the Pemigewasset. Chocorua's summit is a picturesque rocky cone, and the mountain is purported to be one of the most photographed in the world.AMC White Mountain Guide, page 310 The view from Chocorua Lake, which often casts a reflection of the mountaintop, was chosen to represent the White Mountain National Forest on a quarter issued by the U.S. Mint in 2013 as part of its America the Beautiful coin series. The Chocorua Lake basin is protected by the Chocorua Lake Conservancy,Chocorua Lake Conservancy previously the Chocorua Lake Association & Chocorua Lake Conservation Foundation. Hiking trails Mount Chocorua from Fowler's Mill Road Although Mount Chocorua is under in elevation, its bare and rocky summit commands excellent views in all directions. There are many trails up the mountain, and they can be quite crowded during the summer months. Especially popular are the Piper Trail ( each way from the east), the Champney Falls Trail (from the north), and the Liberty Trail (from the southwest). Trails on the southeastern section of the mountain, as well as trails on Mount Paugus immediately to the west of Chocorua, are maintained by the Chocorua Mountain Club, an all-volunteer crew since 1908.Chocorua Mountain Club Hiking trails (listed clockwise, starting from southwest side): * Liberty Trail * Brook Trail * Bolles Trail * Bee Line Trail * Champney Falls Trail * Middle Sister Trail * Carter Ledge Trail * Nickerson Ledge Trail * Piper Trail * Weetamoo Trail * Hammond Trail Legends Mount Chocorua, John White Allen Scott (1815-1907) The Chocorua legend tells of a Native American prophet or chief, Chocorua, who is supposed to have lived near the mountain at the dawn of white settlement, although no authentic records of his life are known to exist. The usual story‚Äîmuch of it drawn from a short work of fiction by Lydia Maria Child‚Äîis that in about 1720 Chocorua was on friendly terms with settlers and in particular the Campbell family that had a home in the valley now called Tamworth. Chocorua was called away and left his son in the care of the Campbell family. The boy found and drank a poison that Mr. Campbell had made to eliminate troublesome foxes, and Chocorua returned to find his son had died. Chocorua, distraught with grief, pledged revenge on the family. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Campbell returned home one afternoon to find his wife and children had been slain. Campbell suspected Chocorua and pursued him up the mountain. Chocorua was wounded by a shot from Campbell's rifle and, uttering a curse upon the white settlers, he leaped from the summit to his death. There are at least three other versions of the legend of Chocorua. One is that Chocorua simply fell from a high rock on the mountain while hunting. A second is the white settlers pursued Chocorua up the mountain after an Indian massacre, and he leaped to his death. The third is that all the white settlers pursued him with guns, pitchforks, and torches. As Chocorua reached the top, the settlers decided to torch the remaining trees and in doing so they burned and exposed the topsoil of the last . As the flames drew closer to Chocorua, he cursed the white men and leaped to his death. =The curse= The east face of Mount Chocorua from Carter Ledge Although the exact words of Chocorua's curse (or even if there was a curse) are not known, it has been reported (Mudge, page 34) to be as follows. > \\"May the Great Spirit curse you when he speaks in the clouds and his words > are fire! Lightning blast your crops! Wind and fire destroy your homes! The > Evil One breathe death on your cattle! Panthers howl and wolves fatten on > your bones!\\" Another version appears in the story \\"Chocorua's Curse\\", by Lydia Maria Child, contained in The Token (1830): > \\"A curse upon ye, white men! May the Great Spirit curse ye when he speaks in > the clouds, and his words are fire! Chocorua had a son ‚Äî and ye killed him > while the sky looked bright! Lightning, blast your crops! Wind and fire > destroy your dwellings! The Evil Spirit breathe death upon your cattle! Your > graves lie in the war path of the Indian! Panthers howl, and wolves fatten > over your bones! Chocorua goes to the Great Spirit ‚Äî his curse stays with > the white men!\\" The Chocorua legend is featured on a New Hampshire historical marker (number 31) along New Hampshire Route 16 in Tamworth. Cultural references Mount Chocorua, with its alpine spur, reflecting lake, wide viewscape, and romantic legend, has long attracted the attention of American artists. Art historian Robert L. McGrath has written: > \\"In terms of the broader history of American art, no mountain has figured > more prominently in the representation of the national landscape. Without > exception, Chocorua has been more frequently depicted than any other > peak...\\" Early 18th century painters of Chocorua included Thomas Cole, who used the mountain again and again in his paintings as his vision of America and the human experience evolved over his lifetime. Cole is considered a founder of the Hudson River School of American artists, which to a considerable extent overlapped with the \\"White Mountain School\\" of painters. Among the hundreds of artists who have painted Chocorua are Asher Brown Durand, Benjamin Champney, Thomas Doughty, Aaron Draper Shattuck, David Johnson, Albert Bierstadt, Sanford Gifford, Alfred Thompson Bricher, John Marin, e e cummings, and Frank Stella. McGrath (2001) Among the most notable artists who have painted in the White Mountains was John Frederick Kensett (1816‚Äì1872). A painter of the Hudson River School, his Mount Chocorua (1864‚Äì66) typifies American Luminism. This important art movement, containing a transcendental realism of the sublime, incorporates an inner illumination of an almost spiritual light (color), expressive geometric effects of composition (space), and the isolation of the American wilderness setting (silence). Wallace Stevens (1879‚Äì1955) mentions Mount Chocorua in stanza XXI of his poem \\"The Man with the Blue Guitar\\". It is also the subject of his poem \\"Chocorua To Its Neighbor\\". Ezra Pound mentions Chocorua at least twice in the Pisan Cantos: \\"...For the purity of the air on Chocorua / in a land of maple...\\" Cedric H. Whitman (1916-1979), Elliot Professor of Greek Literature at Harvard University, wrote a narrative poem, \\"Chocorua\\", published posthumously by William L. Bauhan, publisher, Dublin, New Hampshire, in 1983. The American composer Alan Hovhaness (1911‚Äì2000), who often climbed the White Mountains during his childhood, composed a piano sonata named \\"Mt. Chocorua\\" (Op. 335) in 1982.Performed on Fred the Cat: Half a Century of Piano Music by Alan Hovhaness, Marvin Rosen, piano. Koch International Classics, 1995.

Latrotoxins are the main active components of the venom and are responsible for the symptoms of latrodectism. The following latrotoxins have been described: five insecticidal toxins, termed Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥, Œ¥ and Œµ-latroinsectotoxins, one vertebrate-specific neurotoxin, alpha-latrotoxin, and one toxin affecting crustaceans, Œ±-latrocrustatoxin. Œ±-Latrotoxin The best-studied latrotoxin is alpha- latrotoxin, which acts presynaptically to release neurotransmitters (including acetylcholine) from sensory and motor neurons, as well as on endocrine cells (to release insulin, for example). It is a ~130 kDa protein that exists mainly in its dimerized or tetramerized forms. Œ±-Latrotoxin (Œ±-LTX) can naturally be found in widow spiders of the genus Latrodectus. The most widely known of those spiders are the black widows, Latrodectus mactans. The venom of widow spiders (Latrodectus) contains several protein toxins, called latrotoxins, which selectively target against either vertebrates, insects or crustaceans. One of these toxins is Œ±-latrotoxin and targets selectively against vertebrates; it is ineffective in insects and crustaceans. Œ±-LTX has a high affinity for receptors that are specific for neuronal and endocrine cells of vertebrates. = Biosynthesis = As the DNA sequence for Œ±-LTX is transcribed and translated, an inactive precursor molecule of Œ±-LTX (156.9 kDa) is formed. This precursor molecule undergoes post-translational processing where the eventual, active Œ±-LTX protein (131.5 kDa) is formed. The N-terminus of the Œ±-LTX precursor molecule is preceded by short hydrophilic sequences ending with a cluster of basic amino acids. These clusters are recognized by proteolytic enzymes (furin-like proteases), which cleave and activate the Œ±-LTX precursor molecules by means of hydrolysis. The C-terminus too is recognized by these furin-like proteases and is also cleaved. Œ±-LTX precursor molecules are synthesized by free ribosomes in the cytosol and are therefore cytosolic in the secretory epithelial cells of the venom glands., They can, however, associate with secretory granules although they are not taken up in the lumen of the granules. The cytosolic Œ±-LTX precursor molecule is released from the cell by means of holocrine secretion where it ends up in the venom gland of the spider. This gland contains the several proteases involved in the cleavage of the precursor Œ±-LTX molecule. The Œ±-LTX protein tertiary structure can be divided in three parts: the N-terminal wing (36 kDa), the body (76 kDa), and the C-terminal head (18.5 kDa). Because of C-terminal ankyrin repeats, which mediate protein-protein interactions, the Œ±-LTX monomer forms a dimer with another Œ±-LTX monomer under normal conditions. Tetramer formation activates toxicity. = Toxicokinetics = Œ±-LTX affects motor nerve endings and endocrine cells. No major enzymatic activities are associated. Instead, the toxin can form pores in the lipid membranes and induce Ca2+ ion flow. The onset of effects by intoxication can occur with a lag-period of 1 to 10 minutes, even at subnanomolar concentration levels. At nanomolar concentrations, bursts of neurotransmitter release occur. After the bursts, prolonged periods of steady-state release take effect. Stimulation of small end-plate action potentials are initially induced by the neurotoxin, while later on the neurotransmission is blocked at the neuromuscular junction. This is due to depletion of synaptic vesicle contents. = Toxicodynamics = Œ±-LTX in its tetrameric form interacts with receptors (neurexins and latrophilins) on the neuronal membrane, which causes insertion of Œ±-LTX into the membrane. Once the tetramer is inserted into the cell membrane, two mechanism of actions can occur. First, insertion may lead to pore formation and possibly other effects, and second, the receptor may be activated, which leads to intracellular signaling. The four heads of the tetramer form a bowl surrounding the pore, which is restricted at one point to 10 √Ö. Millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ strongly catalyze tetramer formation, suggesting that the tetrametric state is divalent cation-dependent, while EDTA favours formation of the dimer. Research also shows that concentrations of La3+ higher than 100 ŒºM also block tetramerisation. Pore formation can occur in pure lipid membranes, but reconstituted receptors greatly increase pore formation. Biological membranes block pore formation when no Œ±-LTX receptors are present (neurexin, latrophilin, PTPœÉ). It is also known that the three highly conserved cysteine residues are involved with Œ±-LTX receptor binding, because mutants containing serine instead of cysteine residues did not induce toxicity. The N-terminal domain needs to fold properly, in which the disulfide bonds need to be functional. The Œ±-LTX toxin is bound by a small protein, LMWP or latrodectin. It has been observed that pore formation in lipid bilayers is impossible when latrodectin is unavailable. Lactrodectin has no effect on Œ±-LTX toxicity.  Pore formation  The pores formed by Œ±-LTX in the membrane are permeable to Ca2+ and therefore allow an influx of Ca2+ into the cell. This influx into an excitable cell stimulates exocytosis directly and efficiently. The cation influx is proportional to the amount of pores and hence the amount of involved receptors expressed on the cell membrane. Also Ca2+ strongly facilitates the forming of the tetramers and so its pore formation. The pore is also permeable to neurotransmitters, which causes massive leakage of the neurotransmitter pool in the cytosol. Alongside the influx of Ca2+, the channel is not very selective, allowing Na+, K+, Ba2+, Sr2+, Mg2+, Li+ and Cs+ to pass the membrane too. The pore is open most of the time, with an open probability of 0.8. Most trivalent cations block channels at 50-100 ŒºM, such as Yb3+, Gd3+, Y3+, La3+ and Al3+. The pore is not only permeable for cations, but also for water. This causes nerve terminal swelling. Further membrane potential disturbances occur due to permeability of small molecules, such as neurotransmitters and ATP to pass through the Œ±-LTX pore. ;Membrane penetration Although tetrameric pore formation of Œ±-latrotoxin has been shown conclusively , some authors still dispute whether this is the main mode of action of Œ±-latrotoxin, and believe that Œ±-latrotoxin (tetrameric or not) may penetrate through the membrane of target cells to interact directly with intracellular neurotransmitter release machinery.  Receptors  The following mechanism is suggested for receptor-mediated effects. Three receptors for Œ±-latrotoxin have been described: * neurexin * latrophilin (aka CIRL, Calcium-Independent Receptor for Latrophilin) * protein tyrosine phosphatase sigma (PTPœÉ). The toxin stimulates a receptor, most likely latrophilin, which is a G-protein coupled receptor linked to GŒ±q/11. The downstream effector of GŒ±q/11 is phospholipase C (PLC).When activated PLC increases the cytosolic concentration of IP3, which in turn induces release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. This rise in cytosolic Ca2+ may increase the probability of release and the rate of spontaneous exocytosis. Latrophilin with Œ±-LTX can induce the activation of Protein Kinase C (PKC). PKC is responsible for the phosphorylation of SNARE proteins. Thus latrophilin with Œ±-LTX induces the effect of exocytosis of transport vesicles. The exact mechanism has to be discovered. ;Signaling As well as the major effects of Œ±-latrotoxin pore formation, other effects of Œ±-latrotoxin are mediated by interaction with latrophilin and intracellular signalling (see signal transduction). =Structure activity relationship (SAR)= The natural occurring Œ±-LTX dimer has to form a tetramer to be toxic. Tetramerisation occurs only in the presence of bivalent cations (such as Ca2+ or Mg2+) or amphipathic molecules. The four monomers that form this tetramer are symmetrically arranged around a central axis, resembling a four-blade propeller with a diameter of 250 √Ö and a thickness of 100 √Ö. The head domains form the compact, central mass brought together and surrounded by the body domains. The wings stand perpendicular towards the axis of the tetramer. Because of this form the tetramer contains a pear-shaped channel in the central mass. At the lower end the diameter of this channel is 25 √Ö, then widens to 36 √Ö to be constricted to 10 √Ö at the top. The base of the tetramer (below the wings) is 45 √Ö deep and is hydrophobic, which mediates insertion into the cell membrane. Also insertion of the tetramer is only possible in presence of certain receptors (mainly neurexin IŒ± and latrophilin and PTPœÉ in a minor extent) on the membrane. Neurexin IŒ± only mediates insertion under presence of Ca2+, whereas latrophilin and PTPœÉ can mediate insertion without presence of Ca2+. So because of the channel and the insertion in the cell membrane the protein makes the cell more permeable to substances that can pass through the channel. These substances are mono- and bivalent cations, neurotransmitters, fluorescent dyes and ATP. = Toxicity = The LD50 of Œ±-LTX in mice is 20‚Äì40 Œºg/kg of body weight. The LD50 of Latrodectus venom in mg/kg for various species: frog = 145, blackbird = 5.9, canary = 4.7, cockroach = 2.7, chick = 2.1, mouse = 0.9, housefly = 0.6, pigeon = 0.4, guinea-pig = 0.1. = Scientific contribution = Œ±LTX has helped confirm the vesicular transport hypothesis of transmitter release, establish the requirement of Ca2+ for vesicular exocytosis, and characterize individual transmitter release sites in the central nervous system. It helped identify two families of important neuronal cell-surface receptors. The mutant form of Œ±LTX, which is called Œ±LTXN4C and does not form pores, has contributed to research. It helped the approach to deciphering the intracellular signaling transduction mechanism stimulated by Œ±LTX. The mutant toxin can also be used to study the nature and properties of intracellular Ca2+ stores implicated in the toxin receptor transduction pathway and their effect on evoked postsynaptic potentials. The mutant toxin can also be an instrument to elucidate the endogenous functions of Œ±LTX. Other venom components The natural prey of widow spiders are insects, and several insectotoxins are found in its venom. The latroinsectotoxins appear to have similar structures. High- molecular-weight proteins that have been isolated from the Mediterranean black widow (L. tredecimguttatus) include the insect-specific neurotoxins Œ±-latroinsectotoxin and Œ¥-latroinsectotoxin, a neurotoxin affecting crustaceans known as latrocrustatoxin, and small peptides that inhibit angiotensin-1-converting enzyme. Apart from the high molecular weight latrotoxins described above, Latrodectus venom also contains low molecular weight proteins whose function has not been explored fully yet, but may be involved in facilitating membrane insertion of latrotoxins.

It was created by WGBH, a public television broadcast service located in Boston, Massachusetts. WGBH is a member of PBS, which allowed for the series to be viewed on various other PBS stations. Each episode began with host James Earl Jones sitting in a chair in a room with a table, lamp, and window. The walls were blue with white dots in order to make it appear as if the room was sitting out in space or the night sky. James Earl Jones talks during the short opening section, then acts as narrator for the balance of an episode. This series, aimed at children aged six to nine years old, presents stories based on traditional fairy tales. A number of presentation methods were used to tell these stories, with stop motion animation, live-action or cel animation being used depending on the episode. James Earl Jones only hosts in seasons 1 & 2 but does not host in seasons 3 & 4. Long Ago and Far Away also featured a number of guest narrators, including Tammy Grimes (who narrated \\"The Happy Circus\\"); Kim Loughran (who narrated \\"Bill and Bunny\\"); David Suchet (who narrated \\"The Fool of the World and the Flying Ship\\"); Mia Farrow (who narrated \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" and \\"Pegasus\\"); Robert Hardy (who narrated \\"Pied Piper of Hamelin\\"); and Kevin Kline (who narrated \\"Merlin and the Dragons\\").

In 1975 Derek Bailey, Steve Beresford, Max Boucher, Paul Burwell, Jack Cooke, Peter Cusack, Hugh Davies, Mandy and Martin Davidson, Richard Leigh, Evan Parker, John Russell, David Toop, Philipp Wachsmann and Colin Wood came together and agreed to produce a magazine. It was independently published and dedicated to the coverage of free improvised music. Its need was suggested in a conversation between Evan Parker and Mandy and Martin Davidson. The title was proposed by Paul Burwell at the first meeting in the Davidsons' house and unanimously adopted. Musics, headquartered in London, has not been published since 1979. In 2016 the Ecstatic Peace Library published Musics: A British Magazine of Improvised Music & Art 1975‚Äì79, a facsimile reprint of all issues of the magazine with a foreword by Steve Beresford, an introduction by David Toop, and afterword by Thurston Moore. Eva Prinz and Thurston Moore hosted an exposition on the magazine and the book, covering it at the Red Gallery on Rivington Street in London in July of 2017. History and profile Musics was launched with Issue No. 1 April/May 1975 with the banner \\"MUSICS an impromental experivisation arts magazine\\". The journal was distributed in the UK and worldwide. Mandy Davidson edited the first issue. Soon afterwards she moved to the US, and it was decided there would be no permanent editor. Max Boucher was appointed production editor. The 'editorial board' moved quickly towards becoming a collective. Each collective member contributed ¬£4 to cover the costs of the first issue, which was run off on an A3 Gestetner duplicator. Issue no.2 was pasted up and printed by offset-litho. Over time the print run was increased and all income was ploughed back. Eventually it was possible to pay the printers (Islington Community Press) to make the plates and run off the copies. However collective members continued to do all the unpaid work of editing and preparing the camera ready artwork. No editors, writers, designers, or photographers were ever paid. Limiting expenditure was only part of the financial model. From the beginning the Musics collective took the position that they would not accept paid advertising or grant aid, and the only income came from subscriptions and sales through (mostly alternative) bookshops. In addition there were associates in cities such as Bristol and Glasgow who sold copies through local outlets and at performances. In the final months there was an imminent financial crisis, but this was resolved through a successful jumble sale. The policy of financial independence was copied from Lib√©ration, the French daily paper which had no paid ads. The two publications shared a vibrant pluralism, due to their freedom from the influence of advertisers or funding bodies. Musics and Libe were informally affiliated, as can be seen from occasional mutual references in archived copies. Both have a dynamic energy which radiates from the pages - in Musics perhaps almost reaching perfection. (Liberation later reverted to the standard model and it continues in name only.) Musics came out six times a year, with occasional exceptions. Musics proposed the destruction of artificial boundaries and linked jazz, the music of composers such as John Cage, and indigenous and non-European musics. It was significant in the discussion of traditional Asian instruments (Clive Bell) as paths of equal value for the performance of musics, a term that discarded the use of the word \\"jazz\\". Early issue covered audio soundscape work, reviewing performance events from a cliff-top piano hurling festival or burning pianos, trap set improvisation against a rising sea tide that drowned cymbals and floated and retuned toms, or drummer Han Bennink's inclusion of saws and power tools in his percussion set. Electronics were explored as micro-environments at a level of equality with acoustic instruments in the precursors of glitch, such as the STEIM experiments with the cracklebox or the circuit board work of Hugh Davies (1943‚Äì2005), and an attack on the possibilities of brass instruments, notably by Steve Lacy and Evan Parker. Lindsay Cooper in her essay Women, Music, Feminism ‚Äì notes in Musics #14 (October 1977) analyzed how to overcome gender roles in music. Tensions and unresolved contradictions accumulated. A small faction formed within the collective and soon un-democratically added to the artwork for the front cover of issue no.23 the words FINAL ISSUE.

During the American Civil War, the Battle of Buffington Island took place on July 19, 1863, just south of the Ohio community of Portland. The Ohio Historical Society maintains a four-acre park adjacent to the island that features a monument about the battle. It also features signs that tell of the events at the battle. Buffington descendants will appreciate Fortescue Cumming's account of river travel before the island was host to the great civil war battle. \\"We were here hailed by two men who offered to work their passage to the falls. We took them on board, and one proved to be one Buffington, son to the owner of Buffington's island, from whom Pickets had purchased his farm and mill.... Buffington was a very stout young man, and was going to the falls to attend a gathering (as they phrase it in this country) at a justice's court, which squire Sears, who resides at the falls, holds on the last Saturday of every month: He supposed there would be sixty or seventy men there‚Äîsome plaintiffs, and some defendants in causes of small debts, actions of defamation, assaults, &c.; and some to wrestle, fight, [117] shoot at a mark with the rifle for wagers, gamble at other games, or drink whiskey. He had his rifle with him and was prepared for any kind of frolick which might be going forward. He was principally induced to go there from having heard that another man who was to be there, had said that he could whip him (the provincial phrase for beat.) After his frolick was ended he purposed returning home through the woods. \\"He related a laughable story of a panick which seized the people of his neighbourhood about two years ago, occasioned by a report being spread that two hundred Indians were encamped for hostile purposes on the banks of Shade river. The Pickets's and some others not accustomed to Indian war, forted themselves, and hired Buffington to go and reconnoitre. He hunted, and, to use his own language, fooled in the woods three or four days; then returned late in the evening to his own house, and discharged his two rifles, giving the Indian yell after each, which so terrified the party forted at Pickets's, that the centinels threw down their rifles, and ran into the river up to the belts of their hunting shirts. The whole party followed‚Äîcrossed the Ohio in canoes, and alarmed the Virginia side by reporting that Buffington's wife, and some others, who had not been forted, were shot and scalped by the Indians; but when the truth came out, they were much ashamed. \\"Buffington deals in cattle and hogs, which he occasionally drives to the south branch of the Potomack, where they find a ready market for the supply of Baltimore and the sea coast. The common price here is about three dollars per cwt. \\"Two or three years ago when bear skins were worth from six to ten dollars each, he and another man killed one hundred and thirty-five bears in six weeks.\\" Cuming's Tour to the Western Country (1807-1809), Cuming, Fortescue, 1762-1828.

The types of events include living history, which emphasises the garrison life of the average serviceman or servicewoman, and tactical events, involving simulated combat operations. The hobby has expanded significantly since the 1970s and is now practiced around the world. Cavalry Polish groups reenact light cavalry (uhlan). Death marches and executions Polish groups reenact German crimes, eg. death march of Stutthof concentration camp prisoners and execution of 22 Polish workers in S≈Çupsk. In September 2010 Bƒôdzin Ghetto deportation of 1942 was reenacted. Also crimes committed by Ukrainian nationalists were reenacted, including burning of reconstructed village. Controversies Some reenactment includes Waffen-SS units, the paramilitary force of the Nazi Party in Nazi Germany. Although banned in Germany and Austria, SS reenacting groups exist elsewhere, including in Europe and North America. By the end of the 1990s there were 20 Waffen-SS reenactment groups in the United States. Within the UK, a number of events only allow the portrayal of Allied service personnel and ban the wearing of any German uniform featuring symbols of the Third Reich. In some cases, events permit only Heer, Kriegsmarine and Luftwaffe, whilst specifically refusing any SS uniforms. In 2007, BBC investigative reporter John Sweeney produced a documentary entitled Weekend Nazis that delved into the reenactment scene in the UK. Members of German units, especially the Second Battle Group (SBG), were interviewed and investigated about their hobby. Two SBG members were covertly filmed expressing racist views. The documentary was broadcast on 27 August 2007; in the ensuing controversy, the SBG issued a statement through their lawyers: \\"The views alleged to have been made by members of the SBG are, in the opinion of the SBG, fascist, racist and utterly reprehensible and as such are views we strongly oppose.\\" In 2010, Rich Iott, a Republican candidate for US Congress, came under intense scrutiny after images were released showing him wearing an SS uniform. Iott defended his interest in historical reenactment.

Operating in the Magaliesburg area in North West Province, South Africa, Camp Sizanani offers multiple camp sessions throughout the year for children aged twelve through nineteen whose lives have been affected by HIV/AIDS. The term HIV-affected can imply that an individual is infected with the virus, but it can also mean that the infection of family members or guardians have impacted the individual's life. While some children at Camp Sizanani are HIV +, many more have been orphaned by a parent's AIDS-related death or have family members coping with the disease. Nearly all of Sizanani's campers come from Soweto, Johannesburg's enormous township, to which many black Africans were relegated during South Africa's apartheid era. The children attend the camp free of charge; they are sponsored by Global Camps Africa and its donors. Goals Sizanani takes its name from a Zulu word which translates idiomatically to mean \\"help each other\\". It is largely modeled on the North American summer camp tradition. Accordingly, its stated goals include fostering independence, self-esteem, cooperative skills, respect for others and awareness of HIV/AIDS and other health issues. This final goal is particularly unique to Sizanani, given the children's backgrounds and the AIDS crisis that continues to grip South Africa. Curriculum A day at Camp Sizanani would likely include any or all of the following: theatre, dancing, singing, and drumming; swimming; arts & crafts; adventure/teamwork; sports (including cricket, soccer, volleyball, netball, and basketball), yoga; nutrition; and Life Skills. Life Skills is an activity that teaches health awareness, prevention of STDs, sexuality, identifying abusive behaviors, gender bias, empowerment, drugs, crime, alcohol, and male circumcision. It is the single most important segment of the camp. The 8-day camp (and 4-day staff training period) is followed by the availability to campers of six Youth Clubs that meet every other Saturday at various locations around the Soweto area. There the campers get further training in life skills, enjoy more fun, and bond with the former campers and counselors. They also take on leadership roles in their communities with community service projects, soccer teams, and singing, dancing, and theatre groups. The clubs, like camp, are offered at no charge to the camper. There is no deadline beyond which they may not attend, although they are permitted only a single camp experience, due to the large numbers of children and youth that are waiting to be served. As of August 2016, some 8,000 campers had gone through the program.

They released an album called Burn the Idol of the White Messiah on Uprising Records in 1998 and then a split EP called Make Them Talk on Trustkill with Indianapolis band Burn It Down in 1999 before an initial breakup. The band has reformed as of 2016, releasing two EPs featuring new music on Organized Crime Records. Their second full length \\"2042\\" was released by Good Fight Music in October 2018. The band's radical take on racial politics made them one of the most controversial groups in the 1990s music scene and gained them recognition from magazines such as Maximumrocknroll and HeartattaCk prior to having any official releases. History After the breakup of Chicago band Hinkley, drummer Karl Hlavinka, guitarist Daniel Binaei and bassist Brent Decker formed Racetraitor with new vocalist Mani Mostofi, who had released Hinkley's sole EP. At the time, all four members attended New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois. Beginning playing a style similar to powerviolence and grindcore, the band was formed as way to address racial politics. Hlavinka eventually changed roles in the group, beginning to perform as an additional guitarist, leading to the recruitment of Andy Hurley, to take on drum duties. Although Hurley was much younger than the rest of the band, they often referred to him as the groups \\"secret weapon\\", due to his technical metal-influenced style of playing. His entrance led to the band altering their songwriting style, leading to their transition into the metalcore genre. However, soon after Decker departed from the group, leading to a number of musicians playing bass in the band for a period of time. In particular, Pete Wentz was a recurring member of the band due to this, however he was never officially the permanent bassist. During a performance in Columbus, Ohio during this period, the band members criticised members of Anti-Racist Action who were present for only opposing overtly white nationalist groups like the Ku Klux Klan and not deeper issues such as institutional racism. This led to a confrontation between the two groups and eventually a physical altercation. In 1999, Tacoma, Washington metalcore band Botch released the song \\"C. Thomas Howell as the 'Soul Man'\\" on their album We Are the Romans, which was a critique of Racetraitor's confrontational take on race politics and their way of dividing their allies in the anti-racism movement. =Post-breakup= Drummer Andy Hurley became a member of Fall Out Boy alongside occasional Racetraitor fill-in bass player Pete Wentz. Hurley also played drums in several other projects, including Killtheslavemaster and Project Rocket, and was briefly reunited with singer Mani Mostofi in a band called The Kill Pill, who released one record on Uprising before disbanding. Hurley was also a guest drummer on the \\"Jihad\\" EP released by the briefly reformed Vegan Reich. In 2016, Hurley joined the band SECT with members of Earth Crisis and Burning Love. Dan Binaei went on to form Arma Angelus with Pete Wentz and Jay Jancetic (Harm's Way). For a short time it also included Tim McIlrath (Rise Against) on bass, and eventually Andy Hurley on drums. Binaei currently has put together a new experimental rock project entitled Tiger Spirit consisting of previous members of Suicide File, Sweet Cobra, and Nude Celebs. Bass player Brent Decker continued his activism in the US and abroad before returning to Chicago. Currently, Decker works at Cure Violence out of the University of Illinois at Chicago School of Public Health (Cure Violence stops the spread of violence in communities by using the methods and strategies associated with disease control) and plays in a band called Tiger Spirit. Mostofi briefly played in a Chicago band called the Enemy that recorded but never released a full length on Indicision Records. When members of the Enemy joined the Rise Against and Shai Hulud, Mani formed the Kill Pill. After the Kill Pill, he went on to complete an MA in Middle Eastern Studies from the University of Texas at Austin. He continued his activism in the anti-war and Palestinian rights movements and traveled to the Middle East extensively. More recently, Mostofi earned a JD at Fordham Law School in New York with an emphasis in international law and works as a human rights researcher and advocate. Eric Bartholomae, who played bass and guitar, spent several years doing activism in Chicago following the breakup of the band. In the fall of 2008, he moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota. Now relocated to Arizona, Eric is currently pursuing a PhD in Exercise and Nutritional Sciences and conducting applied biochemical research related to diet and exercise performance while teaching university classes. Additionally, he holds a black belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and a brown belt in Judo. He now plays guitar in Vegan Reich. Wentz went on to form Arma Angelus with Binaei, who released one full-length album on Eulogy Recordings and an EP on the label Happy Couples Never Last. Lastly, Karl Hlavinka left Racetraitor in 1997, eventually joining the Pittsburgh band Creation is Crucifixion. He later left Creation is Crucifixion, returning to play on and off with Racetraitor until the band's breakup in 1999, after which he went on to form the aforementioned Killtheslavemaster with Hurley. =Reunion= Since Racetraitor's break up there have been occasional reunion rumors, but nothing ever materialized. In 2016, however, the band announced on its Facebook page that they were in the process of re-mixing \\"Burn the Idol\\" for a re-release on vinyl. In August 2016, the band announced its first show in 17 years with Detroit hardcore band Earthmover. In September 2016, the group went on to release two brand new songs: \\"By the Time I Get to Pennsylvania\\" and \\"Damaged\\". All music is available at the band's bandcamp page. ‚ÄúWe had discussed playing a show or doing something else over the years, but nostalgia was never all that motivating, so the idea died,‚Äù explained Hurley in September 2016. ‚ÄúBut with everything happening in the past couple of years, from the way things heated up in Ferguson, Missouri, to the rise in xenophobia and bigotry reflected by the popularity of Donald Trump, making new music with Racetraitor felt important again. We needed to respond to this moment in history in our own way.‚Äù In July 2017, Carry the Weight Records, from the United Kingdom, released reissue Burn the Idol of the White Messiah. The record was remixed by Dallas Thomas from the Chicago band Pelican. The same month Organized Crime Records released a new EP from the Racetraitor called Invisible Battles Against Invisible Fortresses. Racetraitor announced they signed to Good Fight Music in October 2018, releasing their second full length \\"2042\\" with lead single \\"BLK XMAS.\\" The second press of the Burn the Idol of the White Messiah reissue was also released on Good Fight in partnership with Ugly and Proud Records from Bulgaria. Characteristics =Musical style= Early Racetraitor music could be characterized as powerviolence and grindcore, featuring an abundance of noise and blast beats. Songs often timed less than a minute, which gave their early shows the quality of containing more spoken word than music. Eventually, their 1990s hardcore, extreme metal, especially death metal, and metalcore influences came to the foreground and Racetraitor's songs became longer and more defined. Along with bands like Abnegation and Day of Suffering, Racetraitor because one of the forerunners of the vegan metal sound and an early pioneer of metalcore. =Influences= The band cites their influences as: 108, Deicide, Los Crudos, Groundwork, Public Enemy, Unbroken, Suffocation, Downcast, Sepultura, Acme, Pantera, Ressurrection, Propagandhi, Quicksand, Metallica, KRS-One, Lauryn Hill, Ottawa, Neurosis, Anthrax, Minor Threat, The Misfits, Meshuggah, Man is the Bastard, Union of Uranus, Arrested Development, Spitboy, and Bolt Thrower. =Political Message= Racetraitor's message centered around anti-racism and anti-colonialism. They often discussed issues like white privilege, class privilege, the war on drugs and biases in the US criminal justice system, inequities in economic globalization, and US foreign policies in Latin American and the Middle East. The name Racetraitor was in reference to using one's social and economic privilege to create a more egalitarian world. The idea was to take the pejorative term \\"race traitor\\" used by white American racists and the band claim it as a positive self-chosen label. The band's message also held that \\"race\\" was an artificial and constructed human category and was a social construct devised to facilitate exploitation and oppression. Their radical beliefs were influenced by black nationalism, third worldism and other anti-colonial ideologies (and for some members, eventually, Islam). Their lyrics also touched on topics of sexual abuse, spirituality, corporate dominance of economic and public life, rugged individualism. The band's members were vegan and lived the straight edge lifestyle. Especially in the early days of the band, Racetraitor consciously took a more confrontational approach to spreading its message for and ideas about such social justice. They would often challenge their (mostly white) audiences to recognize the roles that everyone played in perpetuating racial, sociocultural, economic, and colonial oppression. The band became known for calling their own audience members \\"crackers\\", which they explained as people who \\"crack the whip\\"; not necessarily someone who is Caucasian, in other words, but rather those who simply perpetuate racism and exploitation in their day-to-day lives. According to members of Racetraitor, this \\"in-your-face\\" approach was intentionally designed to shock audiences and force a debate on issues such individuals might otherwise have totally ignored. After both the release of their first record and starting to garner considerable attention across the American hardcore scene, Racetraitor's message and means of communication gradually evolved to become much less confrontational in its style and instead took something of a more motivational form. =In the press= Racetraitor has been featured on the covers of both Maximumrocknroll and HeartattaCk. Racetraitor has been featured in the books Burning Fight: The Nineties Hardcore Revolution in Ethics, Politics, Spirit, and Sound by Brian Peterson (), Sober Living for the Revolution: Hardcore Punk, Straight Edge, and Radical Politics by Gabriel Kuhn () and New Wave of American Heavy Metal by Garry Sharpe-Young ().

The Act abolished the system of poor law unions in England and Wales and their boards of guardians, transferring their powers to local authorities. It also gave county councils increased powers over highways, and made provisions for the restructuring of urban and rural districts as more efficient local government areas. Poor Law reform Under the Act all boards of guardians for poor law unions were abolished, with responsibility for public assistance transferred to county councils and county boroughs. The local authorities took over infirmaries and fever hospitals, while the workhouses became public assistance institutions. Later legislation was to remove these functions from the control of councils to other public bodies: the National Assistance Board and the National Health Service. The Metropolitan Asylums Board was also abolished, and the London County Council became responsible for its institutions. Highways County councils gained increased powers as the ultimate highway authority for all roads in the county. They acquired direct responsibility for all roads in the charge of rural district councils, as well as retaining control of roads classified by the Ministry of Transport. Urban district councils continued to be in charge of unclassified roads in their areas. Adjusting local government areas The 1929 Act sought to solve a problem that had arisen in the existing scheme of local government, with administrative counties divided into many small urban and rural districts. Some urban districts had a population of just a few hundred and did not have the resources to deliver modern local government services. Similarly, there were a number of rural districts created in 1894 that had small and irregular areas. There were also a few areas where parishes in one county were administered by a rural district council in another. =County review schemes and orders= Section 46 of the Act provided for a review of districts in each administrative county in England and Wales, with a view to forming more effective areas for administrative purposes. The process involved the putting forward of a scheme by the county council to which objections or representations could be made before an order was made by the Minister of Health. All county councils were required to finalise schemes by 1 April 1932, although the period could be extended at the minister's discretion. The final submission was by Cheshire County Council on 1 July 1935. The first orders under the Act were made in 1932, and in November 1936 Robert Hudson, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health, was able to report that the process was nearly completed. The last order, affecting districts in the West Riding of Yorkshire, came into effect on 1 April 1938. In the counties of Radnorshire and Rutland no changes were made to the existing structure. The effects of the review orders made in the period 1932-1938 on the county districts was as follows: *189 boroughs extended *206 urban districts abolished and 49 created (a net decrease of 159) *236 rural districts abolished and 67 created (a net decrease of 169) The Act did not allow for the abolition of municipal boroughs, so a number of small boroughs continued in existence. This power was later incorporated in the Local Government Act 1958. At the same time as reorganising rural districts, many parishes within them were also amalgamated. It was originally envisioned that reviews would be carried out every ten years, but the intervention of the Second World War and legislation in 1945 creating a Local Government Boundary Commission meant that there were no further large scale changes in administrative areas until the period 1965-1968.

Legend The legend about them is that the brothers Simplicius and Faustinus were cruelly tortured on account of their Christian faith, beaten with clubs, and finally beheaded; their bodies were thrown into the Tiber (according to another version a stone was tied to them and they were drowned). Their sister Beatrix had the bodies drawn out of the water and buried. Then for seven months she lived with a pious woman named Lucina and together they secretly helped persecuted Christians. Finally she was discovered and arrested. Her accuser was her neighbor Lucretius who desired to obtain possession of her lands. She asserted before the judge that she would never sacrifice to demons, because she was a Christian. As punishment, she was strangled in prison. Her friend Lucina buried her with her brothers in the cemetery ad Ursum Pileatum on the Via Portuensis. Divine punishment soon overtook the accuser Lucretius, who at a feast was mocking the folly of the martyrs. A small child cried out, \\"Thou hast committed murder and hast taken unjust possession of land. Thou art a slave of the devil\\", who at once took possession of him and tortured him three hours and drew him down into the bottomless pit. The terror of those present was so great that they became Christians. Veneration Of these martyrs, apart from their names, nothing is known except that they were buried on a July 29 in the Cemetery of Generosa on the Via Portuensis. Their feast day is thus July 29.\\"Martyrologium Romanum\\" (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2001 ) Because of the extremely limited knowledge about them, they are no longer included in the General Roman Calendar,\\"Calendarium Romanum\\" (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 132 but, since they are included in the Roman Martyrology, they continue to be officially venerated worldwide and may be included in local liturgical calendars. From the time of the Tridentine Calendar until 1969, the General Roman Calendar included a commemoration of them within the liturgy of Saint Martha on July 29. Pope Leo II (682-683) translated their relics to a church which he had built in Rome in honor of Saint Paul. Later the greater part of the relics of the martyrs were taken to the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore. Saint Simplicius is represented in art with a pennant, on the shield of which are three lilies, called the crest of Simplicius; the lilies are a symbol of purity of heart. Saint Beatrix is portrayed with a cord in her hand, because she was strangled. Their feast day is July 29. Venerating the body of the martyr St. Beatrice at the Benedictine Convent of Perpetual Adoration, Clyde, Missouri in 1940: \\"There, under the altar, enclosed in glass, lay the body of the Roman martyr, Beatrice. We bent our heads eagerly and peered under the glass, where, on silken pillows lay the glittering doll-like body of Saint Beatrice (which we later learned was not her real body but a wax figure encasing her bones). We gazed, fascinated by the rosy cheeked young girl lying there, wearing a richly brocaded and embroidered dress, looking as if she had just breathed her last breath. We stared at her head. Her brown curls were encircled by a filigree band; her pretty mouth was open. We could see her little white teeth and pink tongue. Her glassy eyes had rolled back into her head and were fixed as though staring into heaven. Her pretty head had fallen back onto a silken pillow. Above the gold brocaded collar band, her long, prettily arched neck revealed the bloody spot our eyes always sought in fearful anticipation. It was eternally there--the blood encrusted stab wound that had taken her life. Drops of her blood appeared still fresh on her neck and were caught in a gold chalice beside the pillow. \\"We were enraptured at her dress--a prettier dress than any we had ever or would ever know, prettier than our first communion dresses, prettier even than any doll dress, trimmed in gold, with seed pearls and precious stones. Gold trim ran around her sleeves and down the panels of her skirt and around her hem. Her dress was caught in with a golden belt. Her tiny feet were hidden in two little shoes also trimmed in gold and jewels, resting on a small satin pillow.\\" References * External links *Saints of July 29 *St Beatrice Statue in St Peter's Square 302 deaths Saints trios 4th- century Christian martyrs Late Ancient Christian female saints Year of birth unknown 4th-century Roman women Executed Roman women 4th-century Romans ","title":"Simplicius, Faustinus and Beatrix"},{"id":"3540441","text":"First generation: 1959 2-door sedan Third generation: 1967 2-door sedan Rambler American badge The Rambler American is a compact car that was manufactured by the American Motors Corporation (AMC) between 1958 and 1969. The American was the second incarnation of AMC's forerunner Nash Motors second-generation Rambler compact that was sold under the Nash and Hudson Motors marques from 1954 and 1955. The American can be classified into three distinct model year generations: 1958 to 1960, 1961 to 1963, and 1964 to 1969. During the entire length of its production, the car was sold under the Rambler brand name, and was the last Rambler named automobile marketed in the Canadian and United States markets. The compact Rambler American was most often the lowest priced car built in the U.S. It was popular for its economy in ownership, as was proven by numerous Mobilgas Economy Run championships. After an optional second-generation AMC V8 engine was added in 1966, it also became known as a powerful compact performance model that also included the version built in conjunction with Hurst, the 1969 SC/Rambler. A special youth-oriented concept car, the 1964 Rambler Tarpon, was built on an Rambler American platform that foretold the fastback design of the 1965 Rambler Marlin, as well as future trends in sporty-type pony cars, including the 1968 AMC Javelin. Development The genesis of the Rambler American began with the Nash Rambler, introduced in 1950. AMC President George Mason believed in small cars and had introduced the Austin built/Nash designed Metropolitan in 1954. The Rambler line grew to a larger size (108\\") in 1956. With costs to produce the Metropolitan rising, AMC decided to reintroduce a modified version of the 1955 Nash Rambler (the last 100\\" wheelbase model). The domestically produced replacement let AMC control costs more closely. New AMC president George Romney also wanted to build momentum in AMC's challenge to the domestic Big Three automakers by adding a third car line. The introduction of the new low priced subcompact Rambler was ideal‚ÄîAmerica had just entered into a recession in 1958 as the car was introduced. The first proposals were to modify AMC's captive import by extending the Metropolitan with a station wagon type roof design to make room for four passengers. However the wheelbase of the Metropolitan severely limited the necessary interior room, and costs of the overseas built model were harder to control. On the other hand, the company had retained the tooling from its 1955 model Rambler. The old model's wheelbase fit between its bigger family-sized wheelbase Ramblers and the small import. The old design could be slightly modified and then used for the basis of the \\"new\\" American. American Motors' financial condition meant it could not afford to develop an entirely new model. The reintroduction of the old model leveraged the Rambler's renown for fuel economy and wins in the Mobil Economy Runs, with the consumer's need for a smaller and more efficient alternative to the standard-sized cars that were marketed by the domestic Big Three (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler) at that time. First generation = 1958 = Using the platform of the Nash Rambler, American Motors' designers gave the car a new grille and more open rear fender wells, giving the car a lighter appearance than that of the earlier car, which had hidden its rear wheels behind deeply skirted fenders. The original taillights were turned upside down, saving money on retooling. This design was originally mandated by Nash's Airflyte styling motif, which sought to reach for the blinding optimism of post-World War II transportation. The car's seemingly narrow track was not much different from the industry standard, but rather an illusion fostered by the bulbous bodywork. Romney worried about cannibalizing sales of his larger, more profitable senior Ramblers, so for 1958, the American was available only as a two-door sedan (senior Ramblers came only in a variety of 4-door body styles.) The only engine was a flathead six producing . The American went on sale late January 1958, with a minimum of marketing and promotion. It was available in two trims, a base Deluxe model priced at US$1,789 allowing AMC to claim the lowest-priced car made in America (adjusted only for inflation, equal to US$ in dollars) and as a Super trim version for $1,874 offering more \\"luxuries\\". The car was advertised as being the only small car with an automatic transmission. All Americans were completely dipped in rust proofing. The automotive press was positive to the reintroduced model. Tom McCahill wrote in Mechanix Illustrated, \\"There isn't a better buy in the world today.\\" He continued, \\"The Rambler American ... is an ideal-size small family car... It will give up to 30 miles on a gallon of gas (and more, with overdrive) and will outperform any imported sedan selling for under $2,000 except in the cornering department... It is by far the most rattle-and-squeak-free 1958 Detroit product I've driven-and I've driven them all!\\" Reports by owners praised the car's economy of operation, but ranked at the top its ease of handling. A \\"workhorse\\" priced at under $2,000 \\"it doesn't look as though every penny was pinched out of it\\", but retains a \\"chic look\\". The American found 30,640 buyers during the abbreviated 1958 model year and helped Rambler become the only domestic make to post an increase in sales that year. = 1959 = 1959 Rambler American 2-Door Club Sedan A two-door station wagon was added to the line in 1959. With the larger Rambler Six wagons offered only as four- door models, AMC's management thought there would be little sales cannibalization from the American. The Deluxe wagon was priced at $2,060, while the $2,145 Super version included a standard cargo-area mat and roof rack. A Deliveryman commercial wagon, with no rear seat and an extended cargo floor, was available, but found few takers. Self-adjusting brakes were added in 1959. Rambler sales increased in 1959, and AMC struggled to keep up with demand as production tripled to 91,491 Americans, with 32,639 (almost 36 percent) made up by the new wagon. The two-door sedans each sold nearly as well, also, at 29,954 for the lower-priced Deluxe and 28,449 for the top-line Super. = 1960 = 1960 Rambler American Custom wagon For the 1960 model year, the Rambler American line added a four-door sedan body style and a third trim level, a top-of-the-line Custom. The new four-door rode on the same wheelbase as the other models and was meant to battle the newly introduced compacts from the Big Three, the Ford Falcon, Chevrolet Corvair, and Plymouth Valiant. The new Custom model came standard with a new overhead valve engine with a slightly higher compression ratio of 8.7:1 producing an additional , for a total output of , while the base models retained the flathead as the standard engine. The flathead six had no visible intake manifold since it was integrated within the cylinder head, while the exhaust manifold is a \\"log- type\\" that looks like a long tube. All models received an enlarged gas tank, now capacity, while power steering was a new option. Even in the face of the new competition from much larger automakers, the compact Rambler American enjoyed appeal not only because of its low initial price, economy, and high gas mileage, but also because its resale values ranked among the highest. The suggested delivered price for the Deluxe 2-door sedan was $1,795, and it was advertised as the lowest priced car in America. Demand for the traditional American continued to grow as sales increased to 120,603 units (of which 44,817 were two-door sedans, 46,973 four-door sedans, and 28,813 station wagons), thus helping AMC reach 7.5 percent of the U.S. market with a total Rambler sales of 485,745 automobiles and third place among domestic brands. Second generation The second-generation Rambler American was achieved through a heavy restyling of the previous year's model under AMC's styling Vice President Edmund E. Anderson. While mechanically identical to the 1960 model, Anderson's restyle resulted in a car that was three inches (76 mm) narrower and shorter in its exterior dimensions with an overall length of , but increased in its cargo capacity. Continuing to ride on the wheelbase, the American's new styling was more square (sometimes described as \\"breadbox\\") instead of the round \\"roly-poly\\" shape (or \\"bathtub\\"), and the visual connection with the original 1950 Nash model had finally disappeared along with the last of the engineering compromises required to accommodate George Mason's favored skirted front wheels as the new skin, designed from the outset with open wheel arches in mind, reduced overall width a full three inches. Popular Mechanics wrote \\"seldom has a car been completely restyled as the 1961 Rambler American and yet retain the same engine, driveline, suspension on the same unit body\\". All outside sheet metal was changed, but the side window frames remained the same as previous models. Only the back glass changed to conform to the new roofline. The firewall and dashboard were new stampings, with the clutch and brake pedals moved from under the floor to the firewall. = 1961 = Rambler American 400 For 1961 the American line added a four-door station wagon, as well as a two-door convertible for the first time since 1954. It featured a power-operated folding top with roll-down door glass, rather than the fixed side-window frames of the original design. Passenger room increased from five to six. The straight-six was modernized with an overhead-valve cylinder head for higher-grade models, but the base cars continued with the flathead engine. American Motors built a new assembly plant in Brampton, Ontario, Canada, for the production of Rambler Americans as well as the larger Rambler Classics. = 1962 = The 1962 Rambler American \\"400\\" Convertible used in the 3rd Rock from the Sun TV show Setting new sales records, American Motors continued its \\"policy of making changes only when they truly benefited the customer.\\" The 1962 model year Rambler American lineup was essentially the same as 1961. Model designations changed with the Custom trim becoming a 400. A new \\"E-stick\\" option combined a manual 3-speed transmission with an automatic clutch as a low-cost alternative to the fully automatic transmission. The E-stick was also available in conjunction with an overdrive unit. The system cost $59.50, but offered stick-shift economy, performance, and driver control without a clutch pedal by using engine oil pressure and intake manifold vacuum to engage and disengage the clutch when shifting gears. Although the \\"Big Three\\" domestic automakers had introduced competitive compact models by 1962, the Rambler American remained the oldest, smallest, \\"stubbornly unique\\" refusing \\"to conform to Detroit's standard pattern for scaled-down automobiles\\" and \\"free of gimmicky come-ons.\\" A road test by Popular Science described the 1962 Rambler American as \\"sturdy, solid, dependable little automobile, comfortable to drive ... a good buy for what it's built for ‚Äì transportation, not a status symbol.\\" The automaker's president, George W. Romney, appeared prominently in advertisements asking potential customers to \\"think hard\\" about new cars and describing \\"more than 100 improvements in the 1962 Ramblers\\" and why they are not available in competitive cars, as well as AMC \\"workers as progress-sharing partners\\" so that buyers can \\"expect superior craftsmanship.\\" = 1963 = 1963 Rambler American 440 hardtop with \\"Twin-Stick\\" manual overdrive transmission For 1963, model designations were changed once again with the 400 now called 440. A new hardtop (no B-pillar) coupe body design debuted, whose steel roof was designed to mimic the appearance of a closed convertible top. This was a one-model- year-only design with a thin profile, clean lines, stamped faux-convertible ribs, and a textured finish. A special top-of-the-line model called the 440-H was equipped with sports-type features including individually adjustable reclining front bucket seats and a center console, as well as a more powerful version of Rambler's stalwart inline-6 engine. An optional console shifted \\"Twin-Stick\\" manual overdrive transmission was introduced. This transmission has a bigger gap between 2nd and 3rd gears compared to the regular three-speed transmissions with overdrive (that operated like a five-speed although the driver needed to know the governor cut-in speed, free-wheeling, as well as when to lock the overdrive in or out). This allowed the transmission to be shifted as a five-speed (1, 2, 2+OD, 3, and 3+OD). The Twin-Stick-shift had the kick-down button on top of the main shift-knob to facilitate five-speed shifting. The entire product line from AMC earned the Motor Trend Car of the Year award for 1963. The recognition was used by AMC to promote the carryover Rambler American models. First, as the Nash Rambler and then as two generations of the Rambler American, this automobile platform performed the rare feat of having two distinct and successful model runs, an almost unheard of phenomenon in automobile history. The convertible and hardtop were the sportiest of the final wheelbase Rambler Americans, and arguably the most desirable now. Third generation For its third generation, the American emerged with what would be its only completely new design. The entire line was treated to neat and trim lines with pleasing simplicity (compared to the more boxy predecessors) with characteristic tunneled headlights with a simple horizontal grille between them. The Rambler American's wheelbase grew by six- inches or 152 mm (to 106 in or 2692 mm) and the interiors were made more spacious. The station wagons in the restyled 1964 series came with four doors and gained 17% more cargo space compared to the previous design. They all featured a new roll-down disappearing rear window for the bottom-hinged tailgate. Full coil front springs along with soft rear leaf units, gave the new American an unusually smooth ride, better than many larger domestic cars. The new models also incorporated various parts and components (such as doors) that were interchangeable with AMC's larger cars. In essence, the new body was a shorter, narrower version of the previous year's new Rambler Classic. The new styling was the work of designer Dick Teague, who later designed the 1968 Javelin and AMX. Teague selected the front-end design developed by Bob Nixon, who was later in charge of AMC's small car studio. Many viewed the newly designed station wagon as the best looking of any American wagon, with its new trim lines, with ample passenger, and cargo room. Led by the top-line 440-series convertible, they were arguably the 1964's most attractive Detroit compacts. Car Life magazine titled its road test of the 1964 Rambler American: \\"The Original Plain Jane Compact Car Just Got Back From the Beauty Parlor\\". = 1964 = 1964 American 440 convertible 1964 American 220 Sedan In addition to the top-of-the-line 440 models, the cheaper 330 and 220 models were also available, and Rambler American sales soared to a record 160,000-plus. The old I6 was a gas stingy champ in the Mobil Economy Runs and available in , , and versions. American Motors focused its marketing on the economy of the new models, advertising that was previously only popular during the Great Depression. The company's series of \\"Love Letters to Rambler\\" advertisements included \\"ordinary user testimonials\\" about the economy and reliability of their Ramblers, rather than in pursuit of buyers in the whole compact car market segment. This strategy was copied ten years later by Datsun. = 1965 = 1965 American 440 convertible The 1965 Americans were little changed, but were advertised as \\"The Sensible Spectaculars\\". This was part of Roy Abernethy's strategy for AMC to shed its \\"economy car\\" reputation and take on the domestic Big Three automakers in new market segments. There were few changes to AMC's smallest models, as Abernethy pinned his hopes for recovery not so much on the low-priced Rambler American as on the medium and higher- priced Classic and Ambassador lines. The 1965 models were the last year for the venerable flathead six available in or versions. It was the last flathead engine to be used in a domestic U.S. car. The year also saw the introduction of an entirely new overhead valve straight-6 engine. This engine was available on any American model equipped with an automatic transmission. American Motors used this modern straight-six design through 1979, with a smaller version used 1966‚Äì1970. The same engine was later available in a larger version (used from 1971 to 1989) and the fuel injected versions that debuted in 1987, known as the Jeep 4.0, which Chrysler would continue their production after its purchase of AMC in 1987, all the way through 2006. The 440 trim was available as a convertible and it was the most affordable US-made open body style with prices starting at $2,418. It was available with twin individually adjustable and reclining front seats or buckets with center console. It was one of the best convertibles on the market, but lacked some sporty features that buyers wanted, such as a V8 engine.  Rambler Carrousel  The 1964 Chicago Auto Show featured a special version of a top-of-the-line American named the Rambler Carrousel on raised rotating platform. The 1965 show car exterior was finished in \\"Turquoise Fireflake\\" and a white leather interior with turquoise carpeting, instrument panel, and slim bucket seats. Other features included die-cast aluminum road wheels and AMC's console-mounted Twin-Stick manual transmission. American Motors made specially trimmed, production-based show cars and the Carrousel was one of three concepts displayed for 1965 at the Chicago Show: the Rambler Tarpon fastback and the Rambler Cheyenne station wagon. = 1966 = 1966 American 440 convertible As the automobile marketplace in the US was moving away from economy towards performance and luxury vehicles, American Motors began removing the historic Rambler name from its larger models. The American and Classic models retained their economy car marketing image, and their traditional nameplate. To cement this image, a Rambler American was again the overall winner in the Mobil Economy Run. The mid-trim level 330 model was dropped, leaving the top 440 and base 220 models in the lineup for 1966. The top of the line model, available only as a two- door hardtop, saw its name changed from 440-H, to Rogue. The American models were facelifted for the 1966 model year with more squared-off front and rear styling. The front of the car was extended three inches (76 mm), that increase allowed the optional air conditioning to be installed with the new 199, and 232 in-line six-cylinder engines, which were longer than the previous 195.6 versions. A completely new \\"Typhoon\\" V8 engine was developed by AMC, it was introduced in the special mid-1966 Rogue model. Available in two-barrel carburetor version or producing with a 4-barrel carburetor and high compression, the new engines utilized \\"thin-wall\\" casting technology and weighed only . The newly powered Rogue came with a 3-speed automatic transmission or a floor mounted 4-speed manual, and made the car \\"suitable for the Stoplight Grand Prix.\\" American Motors' new engine design would expand in power and applications across the company's passenger cars, and eventually in Jeeps. The engine continued to be assembled through 1991 for the Jeep Grand Wagoneer, long after AMC was sold to Chrysler in 1987. = 1967 = 1967 Rambler American Rogue 2-door hardtop 1967 Rambler American Rogue convertible The 1967 model year Rambler American used the same body styling as the previous year's models, with only minor changes that included new taillamps and full-length body moldings on 440 and Rogue models that were now positioned lower on the sides. The last convertible available in the American series was in 1967, and it was moved up from 440 models to join the hardtop in the Rogue trim version. The American was available in nine models, and was the only U.S. compact to be available in \\"all\\" body styles (2-door, 4-door, sedan, wagon, pillar-less hardtop, and convertible). For 1967 only, AMC's new high- compression (10.2:1) V8 engine with a 4-barrel carburetor that produced and of torque @ 3000 rpm, was optional in Rogue and 440 models. Factory installations of this engine were in 58 Rogues and just 55 in the 440 models, with seven of them being in the convertible version. Out of the total production of 69,912 Rambler Americans for the 1967 model year, 921 were Rogue convertibles. Rogues also received grille trim that wrapped around the fender sides. All Rambler Americans received a new grille insert with prominent chromed horizontal bars. The 1967 Rogue models were available in new two-tone paint schemes for the roof, trunk lid and hood that included border trim along the upper body line. The two-door hardtops were also available with a black or white vinyl roof cover. Taillight lenses were more sculptured into the rear panel. The 1967 model year also saw the addition of the new safety standards for passenger cars mandated by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The regulations began with seat belts on automobiles produced after March 1, 1967. The 1967 Rambler Americans included a collapsible, energy- absorbing steering column and steering wheel, more padding on interior surfaces, 4-way hazard flashers, and locking seat back latches for 2-door models. The instrument cluster was changed from the previous rectangular design to round gauges: The speedometer and odometer were center, with twin, smaller fuel and engine temperature gauges, with matching warning-light pods on both sides of the speedometer. All 1967 Americans were covered by AMC's comprehensive warranty designed to increase customer confidence in their vehicles with the tagline: quality built in, so the value stays in. It was the strongest backing among all the automakers up to that time: 2-years or on the entire automobile, as well as 5-years or on the engine and power train. American Motors continued its industry-exclusive ceramic-coated exhaust system as standard on Rambler Americans. Newly appointed as AMC's new Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Roy D. Chapin, Jr. began to promote and reposition the Rambler American, the automaker's least popular line. He bet on the Rambler American to improve the automaker's financial performance after George W. Romney. Chapin also saw a price gap between U.S. cars and inexpensive imports (primarily the Volkswagen) and lowered the price to make the Rambler American's \\"total value superior to the imports, as well as superior in both price and range of choice to U.S. compacts\\". The suggested retail price of the base two-door Rambler American sedan dropped to $1,839 (its closest US competitor was the $2,117 Plymouth Valiant), making the larger and more powerful American only $200 more than the Volkswagen Beetle. American Motors announced that it was forgoing the annual styling changeovers that were expected among the domestic firms, thus saving retooling costs and passing on the savings to consumers by keeping the car's price low. The automaker promised in a special $300,000 advertising campaign future changes to the car would be to enhance safety and reliability. The American's 1966 design was then continued mostly unchanged through the 1969 model year. = 1968 = 1968 Rambler American 440 station wagon. At the time this photograph was taken (2006), this specimen had only 998 miles on its odometer and was essentially a brand-new car. For 1968, the line was further simplified from nine to five models, with the 2-door coupe and 4-door sedan comprising the base line (with the 220 designation no longer used), 4-door sedan and station wagon being offered in uplevel 440 guise, and a lone hardtop coupe making up the top-line Rogue trim line. The American, along with \\"A-body\\" Chryslers, were the only domestics that came as a hardtop coupe model, the Ford Falcon and Chevy Nova being only available as pillared sedans (and a wagon in the Ford Falcon line). All Americans received a new chrome horizontal grille bar that extended outboard to the headlights, while the grille sections got an attractive \\"blackout\\" treatment. The wraparound rear window on the sedans was modified to a flat unit, with a more squared-off \\"C\\" pillar, which changed the appearance from the earlier sedans with their overhanging rooflines. The overall effect was a more formal-looking car. The 440 and Rogue versions picked up a stainless steel trim piece running stem to stern on either body side, straight back between the wheel wells and the beltline. At each end of the strip were the newly safety-mandated body side reflectors, amber for the front fenders, red for the rear. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) standards for all passenger cars sold in America for 1968 also called for shoulder harness for the front seats and elimination of reflective interior trim. Other requirements for all cars manufactured after 1 January 1968, included exhaust control systems to help reduce unburned hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions. The biggest change was the decision to keep the MSRP (manufacturer's suggested retail price) of the base two-door model to within US$200 of the Volkswagen Beetle. The domestic Big Three automakers did not respond to this strategy, thus giving AMC a big price differential over the competing domestic models. Sales of the Rambler American increased and the showroom traffic boosted morale among AMC's independent dealerships. This was backed up by a marketing campaign stating, \\"Either we're charging too little for our cars or everyone else is charging too much.\\" The promotion and lower prices were designed to rekindle the Rambler American as a practical and economical car in customers' minds. Advertisements by AMC's new agency, Wells, Rich, and Greene, headed by Mary Wells Lawrence violated the accepted rule of not attacking the competition. = 1969 = 1969 Rambler sedan Since its introduction \\"the Rambler American has done well at American Motors.\\" For its final model year, 1969, the \\"American\\" name was dropped as the car was now referred to as the \\"American Motors Rambler\\". Continuing the tradition of minimal changes, the models received a new \\"suspended\\" accelerator pedal and cable throttle linkage. Additional safety equipment for the 1969 models included front shoulder belts and headrests for both front outboard seating positions and the front parking lights stayed on with the headlights. On the exterior, the center horizontal chrome grille bar was deleted. As a true compact-sized car on a wheelbase, the Rambler station wagon had no domestic competitors, and it offered interior space advantage compared to imported models with its of cargo space. Available only in 440 trim, the wagons came with a roll down rear window with drop-down tailgate, as well as a roof rack. In part to commemorate the impending passing of the Rambler name, American Motors added the Rogue-based SC/Rambler to the line (detailed separately). A total production for the 1969 model year was 96,029. The last U.S.-made Rambler was assembled in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on 30 June, making the production total of 4,204,925 units. After the 1969 model year, a completely redesigned model, the AMC Hornet, replaced the American. SC/Rambler The SC/Rambler was purposefully promoted by AMC as a potent drag strip challenger SC/Rambler in \\"A\\" trim SC/Rambler in \\"B\\" trim Interior One of the muscle car era \\"most visually arresting examples\\" was a special model that was produced during 1969 in collaboration with Hurst Performance, the Hurst SC/Rambler. The objective of AMC was more than to \\"just build these cars for the street and claim they performed ‚Äî they took the cars racing.\\" \\"Likely the most outrageous musclecar from AMC\\" with 1,512 built, it was probably the only production model made and promoted for a specific drag racing class, the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) F/Stock class. The SC/Rambler was a competent performer with quarter mile times in the low 14 second range.\\" A true muscle car with zero options and a suggested retail price(MSRP) of less than US$3,000, it would take down some much more vaunted cars. The marketing brochures suggested that owners check the current NHRA rule book as to racing classification and if any modifications are allowed. = Equipment = Each Hurst SC/Rambler came equipped with the AMC V8 engine from the AMX that translated into 10.03 pounds per horsepower. There were no factory options to this package. Standard clutch was a with a three finger long-style Borg and Beck pressure plate. The 390 engine was mated to a manual transmission four-speed T-10 with close gear ratios. A Hurst shifter came with a large metal \\"T\\" handle. The rear end was an AMC 3.54:1 \\"Twin-Grip\\" limited slip differential using Dana internals, with outer wheel hubs attached through a spline and keyway system. Factory cast iron manifolds exited to a true dual exhaust with Thrush (a Tenneco brand) two-chamber oval mufflers with Woodpecker logos. These were baffled mufflers, not glasspacks. Minimal baffling gave a deep throaty sound, similar to modern Flowmasters. The exhaust exited through chrome tips attached with hose clamps. While similar Rogue and American models had standard drum brakes, the SC package came with front discs, a heavier sway bar, as well as strengthened drive train and body components. These included connectors between the front and rear subframes. The rear end used fore-and-aft staggered rear shock absorbers to eliminate wheel hop (axle wrap) under extreme acceleration conditions with leaf spring suspensions. The staggered shocks required a special plate riveted in the trunk pan, as well as brackets for the subframe end of upper torque links. Other body modifications differentiating Hurst SC Ramblers from regular hardtop Ramblers included rolled-back front and rear wheel openings to allow for larger tires. American Motors called on Hurst to help develop a vehicle for the racing market. Stock class rules required a minimum of 500 identical vehicles to be produced and sold. This led to the SC Hurst Rambler, (SC) meaning \\"Super Car\\". This vehicle is commonly referred to as a \\"Scrambler\\", although Jeeps later used the Scrambler name. Available only as a two-door hardtop, the interior came in standard gray charcoal vinyl upholstered reclining seats with a headliner embossed with small squares. The front seats reclined, and the new safety mandated head restraints were upholstered in red, white, and blue stripes. The SC/Rambler included a standard 90-degree-arc dial Sun tachometer. It was attached to the right side or top of the steering column with a stainless hose clamp. The only factory option was an AM radio. The SC/Ramblers came with wild factory paint jobs. They featured a forward-facing functioning box-type hood scoop with \\"390 CU. IN.\\" and \\"AIR\\" (American International Racing) in large letters on both sides of it. The hood scoop air flapper was vacuum operated, allowing higher pressure cool air to pressurize a Carter AFB carburetor. A blue arrow on the hood pointed towards the air intake. The Scrambler came in only two red, white, and blue color schemes, \\"A\\" or \\"B\\". These schemes appeared randomly through early production. Some AMC historians claim American Motors built a batch of 500 \\"A\\" scheme SC/Ramblers before switching to the \\"B\\" scheme, with 500 \\"B\\" models built before a switch to the final lot of 512 SC/Ramblers in \\"A\\" pattern. However, there are \\"B\\" scheme cars in the Hurst SC/Rambler registry with very early build dates, putting their manufacture among the \\"A\\" scheme versions. AMC used the same paint code for all special paint schemes, so it cannot be used to determine exactly how the cars rolled out of the factory. Some of the other unique standard items on this model included racing mirrors, anti-hop rear axle links, and blue Magnum 500 steel wheels (common to Fords) with chrome beauty rings and AMC hub centers. Tires were E-70-14 fiberglass belted 4-ply tires with red stripe Goodyear Polyglas tires. American Motors priced the SC/Rambler at just $2,998, a real bargain for a serious dragstrip contender, capable of quarter miles in the low 14 second range at about right off the dealer's lot. For example, Road Test magazine reported 14.4 at 100.44 mph and reached without topping out. With a few simple bolt on modifications they would run low 12's. Modified SC/Ramblers have run the quarter-mile in the 9-second bracket. The automaker provided AMC dealers with numerous \\"Group 19\\" parts and upgrades to make customer's SC/Ramblers even quicker. Well-tuned legal stock S/C's with allowable changes have run in the 12-second range. Charles Rauch set a D/S quarter-mile record of 12.54 seconds at Detroit Dragway. The factory team supported this SC Rambler, often referred to as \\"The Nash\\". Modifications included a special cast iron manifold, advanced camshaft timing, heavier valve springs, factory-supplied carburetor, six-cylinder front springs with factory-supplied bottom shims to restore stock height, 90/10 front shocks, lightened chassis components, exhaust system modifications, Chevrolet 10.5-inch diaphragm pressure plate, wide-ratio transmission gear set, 4.44 rear axle ratio, as well as larger, softer, G70-15 rear tires on identical design \\"Magnum 500\\" 15-inch Ford wheels painted AMC blue. The manifold and some other parts were specially selected factory components for the stock 1970 Rebel Machine engine, but legal for use in the big bore, short stroke 1969 AMC 390 engine. International Production The compact Rambler Americans were exported from the U.S. and Canada, as well as produced in other markets by AMC subsidiaries or assembled under license. It was manufactured in Australia, Iran, Mexico, Argentina, and South Africa. =Argentina= IKA Torino TS sedan From 1966 to 1982, Industrias Kaiser Argentina (IKA) produced in Argentina a hybrid of the second-generation Rambler American and Classic platforms. The car was called IKA Torino, later Renault Torino, and featured AMC's Automobile platform with a facelifted front and rear design and instrument panel by Pininfarina to create a new car. The Torino was received by journalists and the public as The Argentinean car. It was available in two-door hardtop and four-door sedan body styles and all came with luxurious interior appointments. The Torino's engine, transmission, and upgraded interior fittings were unique to Argentina and were not used on any of the U.S. market Ramblers. The engine was the Tornado Interceptor overhead cam (OHC) six originally developed for the new 1963 Jeeps. The car was actually a 1963-1964 Rambler Classic passenger compartment with 1964-1965 Rambler American front and rear sections. The front suspension sills extended all the way under the floor to meet the rear suspension sills, a feature that made the Torino much stiffer than its U.S. produced cousins (The Rambler Marlin also used these long sills, but other models did not). The Torino handled the roads of the interior of the country very well while its engine acquired fame for being robust and reliable. The car was successful in Argentina. It was also entered in races against famous sports cars, including the \\"84 hours of N√ºrburgring\\" endurance race in 1969, where a Torino finished with the most laps, but was classified in fourth place due to penalties. =Iran= Sherkate Sahami Jeep company built Ramblers in Iran. These cars used the 1966 American 4-door body, but feature 1968-model trim, including the blackout grille and US-type side marker lights. Aria and Shahin advertisement (Iran) From 1967 to 1974, the 1966 version of the AMC Rambler American was assembled by the Sherkate Sahami Jeep company in Iran. The American was offered in two trim levels as Aria (sometimes spelled \\"Arya\\") and Shahin. Aria means ‚ÄúAryan,‚Äù and Shahin ‚ÄúFalcon.‚Äù The Aria was a more luxurious version that came with a 3-speed automatic as well as manual transmission, while the Shahin was the base model with a manual transmission. The engine used was AMC's inline-six producing . The cars were available with factory air conditioning, a unique feature for the Iranian market during that time. The Aria and Shahin were assembled under the license of AMC by Pars Khodro starting in 1967. The factory in Tehran was dedicated by the last Shah of Iran. Five-year projections called for the Pars Khodro plant to build 75,000 Rambler Americans. The target was the upper and middle classes that had grown prosperous under the Shah. The Arya and Shahin versions of the Rambler American, as well as the Jeep Aho (Grand Wagoneer), \\"were among the best domestically produced vehicles.\\" Production was continued by the Iran Jeep Company plant in Tehran. The Iran Jeep Company (Sherkate Sahami) formed a new company called General Motors Iran Ltd. in June 1972, and after production of Rambler Americans ended in early 1974, they continued to produce selected Opel Rekord, Chevrolet Nova and Pickup, Buick Skylark, and Cadillac Seville models from 1974 until 1987. =Australia= 1966 Rambler American 440 (Australia) The Rambler American was introduced to the Australian market in 1964. It was built by Australian Motor Industries (AMI) in Port Melbourne from semi knock- down kits shipped from the U.S. The kits were received in right-hand-drive and were assembled with a percentage of local content as required by Australian law to gain tariff concessions. There were also differences and overlaps in the Australian production and equipment compared to U.S. model years. The 1965 model Ramblers were produced through 1966, mostly in 440 trim and with the smaller engine. Because AMI assembled other automobile brands at its facility (including Toyotas and Triumphs), there were some sharing of colors, options, and interior trims. By 1967, the local content of the Rambler Americans had been progressively raised to 53%. Importantly for the Australian market, the Rambler was considered reliable, with the mechanicals being generally solid and trouble free. AMI stopped assembling the American in 1967, replacing it with the Toyota Corolla and Corona, the new Rambler Rebel, and the Triumph 2.5.https://www.tradeuniquecars.com.au/feature-cars/1304/ami-rambler-review- aussie-classic AMI distributed Ramblers from Melbourne for the state of Victoria.

Early in the year, American Motors signed an agreement with an assembly plant based in Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n, that produced a number of vehicles for different makes and had its own dealership network. Virtually, the whole Rambler line was available. However, production and sales volumes were low and the agreement was terminated in late 1959. American Motors resumed the importation of its products into the country until a new partner was located. Early in 1960, the company signed a new agreement with Willys Mexicana S.A. de C.V. and the first model produced was none other than the Rambler American, becoming the first American Motors product made and sold by the company that would become Veh√≠culos Automotores Mexicanos S.A. (VAM) in 1963. The 1960 Rambler American produced under Willys Mexicana was available in two-door sedan, four-door sedan, and two-door station wagon body styles. They were powered by a 90 hp L-head I6 with 8.0:1 compression ratio and single-barrel carburetor coupled to a three-speed manual transmission with column shift. It featured built-in flow-through ventilation, four-wheel drum brakes, regular suspension, regular cooling system, manual steering, pull-handle parking brake, bench seats, four- side armrests, vacuum wipers, cigarette lighter, front ashtray, hood ornament, glove box, driver's side remote mirror, and hubcaps over standard wheels. Factory optional equipment included the one-barrel OHV version of the 195.6 cu in engine. For 1961 the Rambler American for Mexico was available as the new second generation of the line, growing from three to four body styles with the introduction of the four-door station wagon. Wipers and washers changed to electric units, a Motorola AM radio with an antenna as well as twin-circuit brakes became standard. The line continued with minor changes in 1962, which were mostly cosmetic. In 1963, a fifth body style, a two-door hardtop, was introduced. Named the Rambler American Hardtop, it was the Mexican equivalent to the Rambler American 440H model in the US. This made the 1963 Rambler American line the broadest ever in the history of VAM with only the convertible model missing. The car became VAM's first sporty compact, its first high-end luxury model (even above the also-new regular-production Rambler Classic), and its first limited edition. Its main characteristic was the standard presence of the top-of-the-line with two-barrel carburetor and OHV configuration. A total of 90 units of this version were sold. For 1964, the third-generation Rambler American debuted in Mexico and was available only in the two-door sedan, four-door sedan, and four-door station wagon body designs. At first available with the L-head I6, but it soon was replaced by the one-barrel OHV version. After this change, the two-barrel version of this engine became an option. The only transmission available was still the three- speed manual with a steering column mounted shifter on all body styles. The Rambler American line for 1965 switched to AMC's new one-barrel . The new version became available at midyear as the standard and only engine. The 232 engine series was already being produced in Mexico while the 195.6 engine series was imported from the US. In terms of product line volumes, warranty claims among others, having those two engines available was not a cost- effective procedure. The company intended to consolidate and standardize production as much as possible, which was achieved by terminating the 195.6 engines and offer both the Rambler Classic and Rambler American lines with the 232 engines until the 199 was available for the latter. Aside from the engine, the VAM Rambler American saw the same aesthetic features of its AMC counterpart, such as a partially redesigned grille design with four vertical lines and new tail lights with a flat internal side and a curved external one. Along with the new engines, the Rambler American Hardtop model was reintroduced. It featured luxury and sporty touches of the original model and was once again a low-volume limited edition. The cars came standard with the two-barrel version of the 232 engine coupled to a Borg-Warner \\"Flash-o-Matic\\" three-speed automatic transmission with floor shift. Other standards included a luxury steering wheel, individually adjustable and reclining front seats, high-trim upholstery, a center console with locking compartment, custom wheel covers, a full bright molding package (including 440H emblems), and an under- dash tissue holder. Despite incorporating the top-of-the-line engine plus the sportier and more luxurious focus of this version compared to its 1963 counterpart, several performance-minded and luxury items were still optional such as seat belts, power steering, power brakes, and a heater. The Mexican Rambler American for 1966 saw mostly the same cosmetic changes as its US counterparts in the form of more squared external lines, squared headlight bezels, and redesigned taillights. A padded surround for the dashboard edges for safety purposes was now standard as well as the updated instrument cluster with the horizontal speedometer. The hardtop model was dropped and the line was restricted to the I6 engine with three-speed manual transmission on the column. The 1967 models saw a new semi-concave squared taillight design and the five-dial instrument cluster with a round speedometer at the very center. A fully synchronized 150-T model three-speed manual transmission was now standard equipment, meaning the end of non-synchromesh units in VAM cars. The new transmission was joined by a 3.73:1 rear differential gear ratio. Hazard lights were added to the standard equipment list. The 1968 models saw stronger changes in the form of the engine as included standard equipment in the station wagon while becoming optional equipment in both sedan models. These two body styles also received an all-new rear glass without wraparound portions and all saw new larger side armrests. Front two-point seatbelts became standard for the first time. The rear differential was changed to 3.54:1 gear ratio. The 1969 model year cars were almost the same as their immediate predecessors with only minor changes. VAM developed its own performance model in the form of an optional package for the two-door sedan that was named Rambler American Rally, being the highest novelty for the year. This model was inspired by VAM's successful 1965 racing season using Rambler American sedans and hardtops, as well as a growing domestic market demand for muscle and performance cars in general. The package consisted of a two-barrel I6 engine, power drum brakes, fender-mounted \\"232 SIX\\" rectangular emblems and individual reclining front seats with center folding armrest. Transmission was still the three-speed manual with column-mounted shifter with a floor-mounted gearshift as a dealership option. Other dealership options included front disk brakes, front sway bar, stiffer shock absorbers, and a Hurst-linked four-speed manual transmission. Factory options included a dash-mounted 8,000 RPM tachometer and the sport steering wheel used in the Javelin models. The Rambler American line was discontinued in 1969 to make way for the all-new AMC Hornet models. Unlike in the U.S., the \\"Rambler American\\" name was continued on the new Mexican-made compact as the \\"Hornet\\" name would have no connotation in VAM's market aside from the fact that unlike in the US, the model still had a highly positive image among the Mexican buyer. However, the 1970 model year Hornet line did not include a station wagon body style, but AMC had the larger sized Rebel wagon for the U.S. market. The VAM Rambler American four-door station wagon was carried over for one more year. The 1970 Camioneta Rambler American also became the first VAM regular production compact model (unless the 1968 VAM Javelin is counted) to offer a three-speed automatic transmission as an option. Optional was a bright molding package that included \\"440\\" emblems, even though there were no other trim levels or versions. This model was replaced in 1971 with the equivalent Hornet Sportabout version. The Hornet-based Rambler American model continued as a \\"fourth generation\\" until it was replaced with an updated and expanded new VAM American line for 1975. =Norway= Rambler American. Photo on display at the Oslo Museum, Norway Ramblers were imported into Norway during the 1950s and 1960s by Norwegian importer Kolberg & Caspary AS located at √Ös, Norway. K&C; was formed in 1906 and imported automotive, industrial, and construction products.https://translate.google.com.au/translate?sl=no&tl;=en&u;=kcl.no%2F The Rambler American was imported from 1963 until 1969, peaking in 1965. A total of 260 cars were brought in to Norway by production end. KCL also imported the Rambler Ambassador, Classic, and Rebel.https://translate.google.com.au/translate?hl=&sl;=no&tl;=en&u;=http%3A%2F%2Fracn.net%2Fnb%2Fno%2Farkiv%2F56 --sp-504%2F97-statistikk-rambler-i-norge = Philippines = While the Philippines was almost exclusively an American car market until 1941, the post-World War II years saw an influx of European cars enter the market. Despite a saturation of international brands, American Motors Corporation managed to establish a presence and the Rambler Classic and Rambler American were locally assembled by Luzon Machineries Inc. in Manila during the 1960s.https://www.topgear.com.ph/features/feature-articles/Philippine-cars- cost-history-a52-20180209 Rambler Americans quickly became the favorite of the Manila Police Department.https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/musclecarsphfr/amc- javelin-t1803.html =South Africa= Rambler Americans were assembled in South Africa by National Motor Assemblers (NMA), in Natalspruit (Gauteng) beginning in 1961. The Rambler American was available in sedan, station wagon, and hardtop until 1970 after which it was replaced by the locally assembled AMC Hornet. The American sedan was marketed as the \\"Rambler Rogue\\" and the station wagon was marketed as the \\"Rambler 440 Super Stationwagon.\\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/ifhp97/5438236612/in/album-72157625360064860/ NMA had existed as a motor assembly plant since the 1920s and assembled numerous automobile marques, including Hudson, throughout the years before it was sold to the Rootes Group in 1964. Thereafter NMA assembled Hillman, Humber, and Sunbeam, alongside Peugeot and Rambler. Rambler assembly at NMA ceased in 1967 after Chrysler in the USA acquired Rootes Group. Between January 1968 and January 1969 Rambler production was moved to the Datsun assembly plant, Rosslyn Motor Assemblers. In 1969 Rambler production was moved to the former GM plant, Motor Assemblies Limited (MA) in Durban which had come under the control of Toyota South Africa in 1964. A total of 3,664 sedans, 736 wagons, and 288 hardtops were produced. Rambler Tarpon The Rambler American also served as the basis for the Rambler Tarpon, a sporty 2 plus 2 \\"youth-oriented\\" concept car. The semi-boat tail roofed fastback hardtop coupe was developed in 1963 from the tooling that was already set for the 1964 model year Rambler Americans. Shown before the introduction of Ford's compact Falcon-based Mustang, AMC's show car was \\"an instant success\\" with 60 percent of surveyed potential buyers stating they would buy one. The Tarpon was aimed at the Plymouth Valiant and anticipated a new market segment that later became known as the pony cars; however, AMC executives introduced the Rambler Marlin, a larger personal luxury car. The automaker waited until the 1968 model year to introduce the Javelin, a small fastback aimed directly at the market segment that was created by the Ford Mustang. Records =Economy= 1962 American winning the Mobil Economy Run in an advertisement for Champion spark plugs The American was introduced as the North American economy was in a recession and buyers were looking for smaller and more economical cars and the Rambler brand was known as a fuel miser. The Rambler American was a yearly winner of the best fuel economy in the Mobil Economy Run and the Pure Oil Company Economy Trials, even during later years when fuel efficiency was not a major factor in the purchase of automobiles. For example, the five-day event in 1959 covered . A Rambler American Deluxe topped the 47-car Mobilgas Economy Run field with an average . The 1959 Pure Oil Trials were conducted from Los Angeles to Miami, featuring covering over all types of terrain and driving types, where a Rambler American with overdrive set the all time NASCAR- supervised coast-to-coast average economy record of . In the 1960 Mobilgas Economy Run, a Custom two-door sedan returned over a route of more than , finishing first in the compact class. Further proof of the American's exceptional fuel economy came when an overdrive-equipped car driven coast to coast under NASCAR's watchful eyes averaged . However, the most astounding demonstration was the record set in the Pure Oil Economy Trials, another NASCAR-supervised event: , which AMC sagely noted, \\"No car owner should expect to approach in everyday driving.\\" In the 1964 run, a 6-cylinder Rambler American 440 sedan averaged ; once again, the best of all the cars that year. Economy claims for stock cars could be confirmed by these open and sanctioned trials. American Motors (as well as its OEM suppliers, such as the print advertisement for Champion spark plugs) promoted the results of this popular event in its advertising as a marketing technique that further emphasized the thriftiness of the Rambler Americans. Rambler's emphasis on economy over performance can be observed through the example of automatic transmission use in a Rambler American where the 1959 owner's handbook describes leaving the gear selector in the D-2 position (1.47:1 gear ratio) blocks access to low gear (2.40 ratio) when starting out from a stop; therefore, given the car's 3.31 axle, this yields an initial 4.86:1 final drive ratio reducing crankshaft revolutions for maximum fuel economy. =Music= In 1958, the Playmates recorded a novelty song called \\"Beep Beep\\" about a duel between a Cadillac driver who just cannot shake a \\"little Nash Rambler\\" following him. The song uses an accelerating (accelerando) tempo and ends with the Rambler passing the Cadillac \\"...in second gear!\\" The song was on Billboard Top 40 charts for twelve weeks while also selling over one million copies, and it was awarded a gold disc. Concurrently with the popularity of this song, AMC was setting production and sales records for the Rambler models. This was also the same year the old Rambler reappeared as the new American, with the song popularizing the re-released car and making AMC the only automaker have increased sales during the recession of 1958.Gunnell, p. 161 =Drag racing= American Motors was not actively involved in auto racing during the early 1960s as not to glamorize corporate sponsorship of activities that promote dangerous speeds and driving. It continued to support the 1957 Automobile Manufacturers Association (AMA) prohibition on automobile racing. The automaker ran national advertisements: \\"Why don't we enter high-performance Rambler V-8s in racing? Because the only race Rambler cares about is the human race.\\" However, independent AMC dealerships began sponsoring cars in drag racing events. Preston Honea achieved fame with the 1964 \\"Bill Kraft Rambler\\" American from Norwalk, California. The car had a transplanted AMC V8 engine that was bored out to with four carburetors on special intake manifold and featured a transistorized ignition system as well as an Isky 505-A camshaft. The big engine from an Ambassador added only more than the venerable straight-6 normally found in the small two-door American. However, with its 8200 rpm redline, the Rambler ran at the Fontana dragstrip. After the departure of Roy Abernethy, AMC eagerly embraced automobile competition and its effect on car sales. It sponsored Rambler Americans in various motorsport venues and produced a factory-ready Rambler American for drag racing ‚Äî as noted above with the 1969 SC/Rambler. =Off-road= Mexico hosted a grueling mostly off-road race, the Baja 500. In July 1967, a Rambler American in the passenger-car category was driven by Spencer Murray and Ralph Poole and finished the run in a record 31 hours. American Motors then got serious in this type of racing and signed up James Garner's \\"American International Racers\\" (AIR) team to a three-year contract. Garner's shops prepared ten 1969 SC/Ramblers provided by AMC. The cars were modified for the punishing Baja 500 race. Raising the suspension and using Goodyear tires on 10x15-inch wheels increased ground clearance. All window glass was removed and roll cages were installed. The cars had fuel tanks. Two cars were further modified with four- wheel drive. The AIR team built AMC's V8 engines to blueprint tolerances, thus increasing horsepower to at the flywheel. The cars were capable of runs along smooth straights at about 7000 rpm in fourth gear. On 11 June 1969, eight of the Ramblers were entered into the passenger-car category and the two 4WD versions were in the Experimental class. Garner did not drive in the race because of a film commitment in Spain. Seven of the Ramblers finished the grueling race, taking three of the top five places in the passenger-car class. One of the four-wheel-drive cars came in fourth in its class. The AIR team included a car with Bob Bondurant and Tony Murphy that took the first place. For one of the winning Rambler drivers, this was his first-ever race and the experience launched the career of Walker Evans. =Rallying= Rambler Americans competed with good results in the Shell 4000 Rally that was held in Canada. In 1968, for example, the grueling rally over the often-tortuous muddy road from Calgary to Halifax, the AMC team finished 2nd, 3rd, and 5th winning the Manufacturers Team Award. Battery power experiments In 1959, AMC and Sonotone Corporation announced work on a car to be powered by a \\"self- charging\\" battery. It was to have sintered plate nickel-cadmium batteries. During the 1960s, AMC partnered with Gulton Industries to develop a new battery based on lithium and to use an advanced speed controller designed by Victor Wouk. However, the actual running prototype was a 1969 Rambler American station wagon converted from V8 to an all car electric using nickel‚Äìcadmium batteries. Power consisted of 160 cells, each rated at 75 ampere hours (Gulton KO-75), arranged in two banks of 80 cells each, and connected in parallel. The equipment Wouk designed \\"gave it good acceleration, but there was still a problem with the car's range.\\" Later, AMC and Gulton developed the Amitron and the similar Electron city cars.  Legacy  Rambler '65 album cover 3rd Rock from the Sun museum display American Motors used the compact Rambler American chassis as the basis for the 1968 Javelin, a two-door hardtop marketed as a \\"hip\\", dashing, and affordable pony car, as well as available in several muscle car performance versions. In 1988 Ben Vaughn, a musician and a longtime Rambler automobile fan, released El Rambler Dorado on his Blows Your Mind album. He later recorded an entire album in his 1965 Rambler American. Released in 1997 by Rhino Records and titled Rambler '65, Vaughn turned his car into a makeshift studio. Putting the recording equipment inside his Rambler was a gimmick or an act of showmanship, but according to most reviews, the music he created inside his car is \\"timeless\\" rock roll. The Rambler '65 24-minute music video also includes vintage AMC TV advertising clips. Vaughn also achieved success in Hollywood as the composer for the hit NBC television series 3rd Rock from the Sun in which the main characters use a 1962 Rambler American convertible. The car is featured in posters and in the 100th episode (during season 5) entitled \\"The Fifth Solomon\\", the space aliens \\"learn that it's possible to get emotionally attached to a car\\" after they crash their Rambler and have no insurance. During his 2006‚Äì2007 campaign for U.S. president, Mitt Romney sat in a Rambler American at fund-raising events as a way to emphasize the need for more efficient cars. He also stated that his father (George W. Romney) \\"was a man ahead of his time,\\" at campaign stops and that \\"He also coined the term 'gas-guzzling dinosaurs.' That's what we're driving today and that's got to change.\\"  Collectibility  More than 50 years after it was produced, the mission of the first generation Rambler American as \\"an affordable, stylish people mover hasn't changed - though now it's rolling stingily down the road as a collector's item rather than a daily beater.\\" The economical car \\"that put Detroit on notice is one of today's most affordable, fun collectibles.\\" Benefiting from network television exposure, the 1962 Rambler American convertible became \\"a hot ticket item\\" for collectors after it began to appear regularly on the sitcom 3rd Rock from the Sun with owners of rusty cars asking high prices and prime examples commanding upward of $14,000. A fully restored 1962 convertible was given to Mitt Romney on his 60th birthday by his son, Tagg, in 2008. The \\"outlandishly adorned\\" limited-edition, mid-model year addition to the Rambler line \\"built under the aegis of the Hurst shifter people\\" is unique. The SC/Rambler has a strong collector following, with websites, clubs, and a registry. The SC/Rambler has become a popular muscle car to replicate because of the ease of installing a powerful AMC V8 drivetrain into one of the large number of inexpensive 1966 through 1969 Rambler Americans. To identify a true SC/Rambler, it must be a hardtop and the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) must have the letter M in the third digit and the engine code of X as the seventh digit. Most SC/Ramblers took extensive abuse as they were raced hard, and there are stories of cars being sold with their time slips passing along with the vehicle. According to Old Cars Weekly magazine, \\"a No. 1 condition example can still be had for mid-five figures. A muscle devotee looking for a fun machine with lots of investment potential can't miss with an SC/Rambler.\\" Notes References  * External links * AMC Rambler Club (AMCRC) * American Motors Owners Association (AMO) * Crittenden Automotive Library: American * Shell 4000 Rally * American American Rear-wheel-drive vehicles Compact cars Convertibles Coup√©s Sedans Station wagons Muscle cars Cars introduced in 1958 1960s cars ","title":"Rambler American"},{"id":"3540442","text":"The multinational technology corporation Apple Inc. has been a participant in various legal proceedings and claims since it began operation and, like its competitors and peers, engages in litigation in its normal course of business for a variety of reasons.

The new case is essentially the same but is filed only against Apple, not AT&T; Mobility. In late 2013, the various parts of the case were dismissed by the district court. The parts relating to SIM locking were rejected because AT&T; was not a party and the plaintiffs were not willing to add AT&T.; The remaining claim, in its final version, was that Apple monopolised the market for iPhone applications and that the plaintiffs were damaged by paying Apple's 30% commission for paid applications in the App Store, which the court rejected saying that the commission was \\"a cost passed-on to consumers by independent software developers\\", not paid by the consumers directly, and so the plaintiffs did not have standing under the Illinois Brick doctrine.

In September 2011, the District Court granted Apple's motion to dismiss for lack of Article III standing and failure to state a claim, but gave the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint, thereby not shutting out the claims permanently. The court ruled that without a showing of legal damages compensable under current law, the plaintiffs had not shown they sustained injury in fact by the defendants' actions. The problem facing the plaintiffs is the current state of electronic privacy law, the issue being that there is no national privacy law that provides for compensatory damages for breach of privacy, and this is the same issue faced by victims of data breaches, as breaches, per se, sustain no legal damages without a showing of actual and measurable harm such as monetary loss.Romanosky, Sasha, Hoffman, David, and Acquisti, Alessandro, Empirical Analysis of Data Breach Litigation, Heinz Col. of Pub.

Ct., S.D.Ill., 2009. and was settled on February 10, 2012, with payments to be made to consumers by Apple. The Owens complaint alleged that Apple wrongfully marketed, distributed, and sold iTunes gift cards and songs through its online iTunes store, while representing that consumers could use the gift cards to purchase songs for US$0.99 a song and then, after such gift cards were purchased, raised the price on certain songs to $1.29 on April 7, 2009. The lawsuit's allegations included that Apple's conduct constituted breach of contract, violated the state consumer fraud statute, and violated consumer protection statutes of other states. The plaintiffs sought a $.30 refund remedy for each song that class members purchased using a $.99 iTunes card for which they were charged $1.29, plus their attorneys' fees and costs. Apple mounted a vigorous defense and sought to dismiss the suit but lost its motion in December 2009. Individuals are part of the class of plaintiffs if they are U.S. residents who purchased or received an iTunes Gift Card on which the card itself or its packaging contained language to the effect that songs were priced at $0.99 and who used the card to purchase one or more $1.29 songs from the iTunes Store on or before May 10, 2010.Important Dates, Johnson iTunes Settlement.

Does Ultimately decided under the title O'Grady v. Superior Court, the suit filed by Apple against unnamed bloggers raised the issue for the first time of whether bloggers hold the same protections against revealing sources that journalists have. In November 2004, three popular weblog sites featuring Apple rumors publicly revealed information about two unreleased Apple products, the Mac mini and an as yet unreleased product code-named Asteroid, also known as Project Q97. Apple subpoenaed three sites to force them to identify their confidential sources: Apple Insider, Power Page, and, separately, Think Secret, which did no original reporting on the case and thus had no sources to reveal.News Publishers and Internet Industry Urge Reversal in Apple Case, Kansas City infoZine, infozine.com, April 9, 2005.

Accessed 2012-7-23. =Copyright= Apple v. Franklin Apple v. Franklin established the fundamental basis of copyright of computer software, even if it was provided only as object code or in firmware. In 1982, Apple filed a lawsuit against Franklin Computer Corp., alleging that Franklin's ACE 100 personal computer used illegal copies of the Apple II's operating system and ROM. The case was decided in Franklin's favor but reversed by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp., 714 F.2d 1240, 3d Cir., 1983. Object code cases and conflicts of law Apple's litigation over object codeCompare object code with object file contributed to the development of contemporary copyright law because the company's object code cases brought different results in different courts, creating a conflict of laws that resulted in international litigation. In the 1980s, Apple litigated two copyright cases with central issues that included the question of whether object code (as contrasted with source code) of a computer program is subject to copyright laws. A third case in which Apple was not a party but that involved the Apple decisions followed in New Zealand. The specific cases were Computer Edge Pty. Ltd. v Apple Computer Inc. (1986, Australia) (\\"Computer Edge\\"),Computer Edge Pty. Ltd. v Apple Computer Inc., 65 ALR 33, 1986; F.S.R. 537, 1986, High Court of Australia. Apple Computer Inc. v Mackintosh Computers Ltd., (Canada, 1987) (\\"Apple v. Mackintosh\\"),Apple Computer Inc. v Mackintosh Computers Ltd., 44 DLR (4th) 74 Federal Court of Appeal, 1987, Canada, (later affirmed, Supreme Court of Canada , [1990] 2 S.C.R. 209). Accessed July 22, 2012. and IBM v. Computer Imports Ltd. (\\"IBM v. Computer Imports\\"), (New Zealand, 1989).International Business Machines Corporation v. Computer Imports Limited, 2 NZLR 395, 409, 1989. In the Computer Edge case, the Australian court decided against the then-prevailing opinions in other courts (the U.K., Canada, South Africa, and the U.S.) and ruled object code was not copyrightable,In Computer Edge the court looked to 1986 161 CLR 171 (test in Exxon for literary work is \\"not intended to establish a comprehensive or exhaustive definition of literary work for copyright purposes\\" per Mason and Wilson JJ (Aus.)). while the Supreme Court of Canada in Apple v. Mackintosh reversed its earlier decisions and ruled that because object code was a translation of source code and embodied in a silicon chip, it was therefore a translation of an original literary work expressed in a material form and unauthorized reproduction of the object code was therefore an infringement of copyright. The Canadian court opined that programs within ROM silicon chips are protected under the Copyright Act of Canada and the conversion from the source code into object code is a form of translation. It further held that such translation does not include the expression of an idea in another form, but rather only applies to the expression of an idea in another language, and that a translation has a one-to-one correspondence between works that are expressed in two different languages. In these conflict of laws cases, Apple met with conflicting international judicial opinions: an Australian court decision conflicted with a Canadian court decision on the copyrightability of object code. In IBM v. Computer Imports, the High Court of New Zealand then considered these prior decisions and sided with the Canadian decision in ruling that, although object code is not an original literary work in its own right, it is a reproduction of source code in material form and therefore an infringement of copyright takes place if it is copied without the authorization of the copyright owner. Such legal conflicts affected not only Apple, but all other software companies as well, and the conflicts remained unresolved until the creation of an international legal regime embodied in further changes to national copyright laws, which ultimately made object code subject to copyright law.The 1994 Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs), the 1991 European Economic Council Directive on the Legal Protection of Computer Programs (\\"EC Directive\\"), the Copyright Act of Canada, the New Zealand Copyright Act 1994, and other national copyright law revisions. These revisions of law in favor of making object code subject to copyright law are still controversial.Corbett, Susan, What if Object Code Had Been Excluded from Protection as a Literary Work in Copyright Law?, a paper for presentation at the 4th Annual Intellectual Property Conference: Rewriting History: Counterfactuals and Alternative Stories in Intellectual Property and Cyberspace Law, Michigan State Univ.

Cited, among other things, was the use of overlapping and resizable windows in Windows 2.0. The case was one of the \\"look and feel\\" copyright lawsuits of the 1980s. After several years in court, Apple's claims against Microsoft were dismissed, primarily due to a license John Sculley had negotiated with Bill Gates for Windows 1.0. The decision was upheld on appeal in 1994, but legal disputes on this topic were still ongoing until 1997, when the two companies came to a wide-ranging agreement that included Microsoft buying non-voting Apple stocks.Kawamoto, Dawn; Heskett, Ben; Ricciuti, Mike.

Accessed 2012-12-21. Judge Lucy H. Koh later decided that the jury had miscalculated $450 million in its initial damage assessment and ordered a retrial that commenced in November 2013. Following a week-long trial, also overseen by Judge Koh, Samsung was ordered to pay $600 million to Apple for the 2012 lawsuit. On August 9, 2013, the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) announced its decision regarding an Apple-initiated case, whereby Samsung is accused of infringing four Apple patents related to user interfaces and headphone input functionality. The USITC sided with Apple in what was described in the media as a \\"mixed ruling\\" and stated that some of Samsung's older devices infringe on two of Apple's patents‚Äîone covering touch-screen technology and another regarding headphone jacks; however, no violations were identified in four other patents. The final determination of the ITC was signed by Lisa Barton, Acting Secretary to the Commission. In a damage-only retrial court session on November 13, 2013, as ordered by Judge Koh in December 2012, a Samsung Electronics representative stated in a San Jose, U.S. courtroom that Apple's hometown jury found that the company copied some features of both the iPhone and iPad. Samsung's attorney clarified the purpose of the damage-only retrial and stated the result of the first trial, \\"This is a case not where we're disputing that the 13 phones contain some elements of Apple's property,\\" but the company has disputed the $379.8 million amount that Apple claimed ‚Äî Samsung presented a figure of $52 million. The San Jose jury eventually awarded Apple $290 million in damages after jurors completed a one-page assessment form for each infringed patent. The six-woman, two-man jury reached its decision after a three-day period. In the first week of January 2014, a filing with the U.S. District court in San Jose showed that legal executives from both parties agreed to meet prior to February 19, 2014, to engage in settlement discussions. Both Samsung and Apple were responding to a court order that instructed the completion of such a meeting before a new trial begins in March 2014. One of three Samsung chiefs met with Cook, but the filing did not reveal the name of the representative. A new trial is scheduled for March 2014, in which Apple will seek to prevent Samsung from selling some of its current devices in the U.S. The case will involve further debate over monetary compensation. In the 2014 lawsuit, Samsung is accused of infringing five of Apple Inc.'s patents in 10 phone and tablet models, while Samsung has responded with a counterclaim, in which it states that two patents for nine phones and tablets have been infringed on by Apple. Jury selection for the trial occurred on March 31, 2014. Samsung stands to gain $6 million if the jury rules in its favor, while Apple is seeking $2 billion in damages and could proceed with similar lawsuits against other Android handset makers, as the relevant patent issues extend beyond Samsung's software technology. Corephotonics v. Apple On 6 November 2017, Israeli start-up Corephotonics sued Apple. They claimed that the technology behind the dual-camera systems in Apple's iPhone 7 Plus and 8 Plus infringed four patents owned by them (Corephotonics). Corephotonics said that they approached Apple over a possible partnership, but Apple's lead negotiator apparently declined the idea, with Apple going ahead and launching the iPhone 7 Plus in late 2016, and then the 8 Plus in late 2017. The patents claimed by Corephotonics to be infringed are: two patents on mini telephoto lens assembly, one patent on dual aperture zoom digital cameras, and one on high resolution thin multi-aperture imaging systems. Corephotonics also blamed Apple's consumers (who bought the 7 Plus or 8 Plus) to be infringing the patents, as they claim that Apple sells the products with \\"knowledge of or willful blindness\\", which the consumers buy. The lawsuit demands monetary compensation for the lawyers the start-up had to hire, as well as for damages. They are also asking Apple to immediately stop producing dual-lens cameras systems. The iPhone X is not included in the lawsuit, despite having a dual- lens camera. =Licensing= Norwegian Consumer Council In June 2006, the Consumer Ombudsmen in Norway, Sweden and Denmark challenged Apple's iTunes end user license agreement (EULA) through the Norwegian Consumer Ombudsman Bj√∏rn Erik Thon, who claimed that Apple was violating contract and copyright laws in their countries.

Although it did not win, it went on to be a German hit under the title \\"\\". In 1978, Rosenberg competed in the German heats again, and this time was placed seventh with \\"\\" (\\"No, I Won't Cry\\"). Not so successful was her 1980 entry \\"\\" (\\"I'll Be There if There Is a Storm\\") which came twelfth (and last). Marianne Rosenberg's final challenge for Eurovision was in 1982 with the song \\"\\", a ballad which took eighth place. She also achieved chart success in other European countries, including Austria and the Netherlands. Rosenberg is also considered a gay icon in several countries, such as the Netherlands and her native Germany . = Continued success = Rosenberg in 2014 In 2004, Rosenberg re- released Marleen in a remixed version and with a new promotional video. The single reached No.33 on the official German Charts as compiled by Media Control. The follow-up single \\"\\" reached No.77. Both singles were taken from her 2004 disco-flavoured album , which reached # 12 on the German Album charts, and consisted of remakes of her hits from the 70s . In 2008, Rosenberg released her first jazz and chanson album, I'm a Woman. In 2011 she released her first album with new music since Himmlisch in 2000. With Regenrhythmus she was trying to change her sound from being a German Schlager singer to more modern. She was very involved in the production of the album, and received very positive reviews for the result. The album reached number 29 on the German charts . It wasn't until 2020 when she released her next album. With Im Namen Der Liebe she made it to the number 1 spot of the German album charts for the first time in her career.

The pure breed is now extinct, though hybrids still exist. The Alderney was one of three Channel Island cattle breeds, the others being the Jersey and the Guernsey. Alderney cattle were first imported to the United States by Reuben Haines III. Description Pure-breed Alderneys were smaller, more slender boned animals than the cattle of the other Channel Islands and in some ways they were more deer-like than bovine. They were docile animals and would even follow children passively to or from pastures. Their milk was copious and produced very rich butter. A 1912 writer said, \\"The Alderney ranks as the best butter cow in the world, whilst its abundant yield of milk, rich in cream, is phenomenal.\\"Barton, Frank Townsend. Cattle, Sheep and Pigs: Their Practical Breeding and Keeping, p. 21. New York: McBride, Nast & Co., 1912. Extinction Most of the pure-breed Alderney cattle were removed from the island to Guernsey in the summer of 1940, because the island was then occupied by the Germans (during World War 2) and it was difficult for the few remaining islanders to milk them. On Guernsey, the cattle were interbred with local breeds. The few pure-breed cattle remaining on Alderney were killed and eaten by the Germans in 1944. In France, the Alderney was absorbed into the Normande breed. In literature The Alderney takes a part in A. A. Milne's poem \\"The King's Breakfast\\" and is mentioned in Chapter 4 of Jane Austen's novel Emma. It is also mentioned in Elizabeth Gaskell's novel of middle Victorian era, Cranford.

People have been found to perceive images with spiritual or religious themes or import, sometimes called simulacra, in the shapes of natural phenomena. The images perceived, whether iconic or aniconic, may be the faces of religious notables or the manifestation of spiritual symbols in the natural, organic media or phenomena of the natural world. The occurrence or event of perception may be transient or fleeting or may be more enduring and monumental. The phenomenon appears to approach a cultural universal and may often accompany nature worship, animism, and fetishism, along with more formal or organized belief systems. Within Christian traditions, many instances reported involve images of Jesus or other Christian figures seen in food; in the Muslim world, structures in food and other natural objects may be perceived as religious text in Arabic script, particularly the word Allah or verses from the Qur'an. Many religious believers view them as real manifestations of miraculous origin; a skeptical view is that such perceptions are examples of pareidolia. The original phenomena of this type were acheropites: images of major Christian icons such as Jesus and the Virgin Mary which were believed to have been created by supernatural means. The word acheropite comes from the Greek ·ºÄœáŒµŒπœÅŒøœÄŒøŒØŒ∑œÑŒøœÇ, meaning \\"not created by human hands\\", and the term was first applied to the Turin Shroud and the Veil of Veronica. Later, the term came to apply more generally to simulacra of a religious or spiritual nature occurring in natural phenomena, particularly those seen by believers as being of miraculous origin.  Explanations  = Pareidolia = Scientifically, such imagery is generally characterized as a form of pareidolia. This is a false perception of imagery due to what is theorized as the human mind's over-sensitivity to perceiving patterns, particularly the pattern of a human face, in otherwise random phenomena. It is suggested that a tendency of religious imagery in Islam to be perceived as Arabic words is made more likely by the general simplicity of letter forms in the Arabic alphabet (especially in the everyday Riq'a); a tradition of massive typographical flexibility in Islamic calligraphy; and the particular shape of the word Allah (ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá). These factors make the word easy to read into many structures with parallel lines or lobes on a common base. = C. S. Lewis = The author C. S. Lewis wrote about the implications of perception of religious imagery in questionable circumstances on issues of religious belief and faith. He argued that people's ready ability to perceive human-like forms around them reflects a religious reality that human existence is immersed in a world containing such beings. The principal reason he believed in religion was because he believed himself to be wired to believe it, just as he believed human beings are wired to perceive inference (if ... then) and other mental logical phenomena as representing truths about the external world that can be learned from, rather than representing purely internal phenomena to be characterized as error. He chose to believe in his wiring for religious perception in the same way and for the same reasons that he chose to believe in his wiring for logic, choosing to use and rely on both as guides to learning about the world rather than regarding them as purely random in origin and discarding them. People continue to have faith in the phenomenon of logic, despite the fact that they sometimes make demonstrably mistaken inferences.C.S. Lewis made a more detailed exposition of the underlying argument with respect to general problems of futility in his essay \\"De Futilitate in The Seeing Eye And Other Selected Essays in Christian Reflections, = Perceiver as cultural filter = From an etic perspective, perception of an image, icon, or sign of religious or spiritual import to the perceiver is indelibly mediated or filtered through culture, politics, and worldview. As Gregory Price Grieve states: Psychology of the sacred, taking stock of the human condition, conveys that people construct meaning from that which is without meaning; stated differently, culture gives context to lived experience. Therefore, both meaning and absence of meaning may be perceived as being co-existents. Cultural context as constructed meaning and memetic transmission engenders social, existential, and spiritual comfort in a tenuous and arbitrary lived experience and millieu: perception as a participatory event parsing experience into meaningful units. The crossroads or intersections of evolutionary psychology of religion, pattern recognition, neuroaesthetics and symbolic communication lend to the construction of meanings as group cohesion and bond-forming in human society.  Christian examples  The Clearwater Virgin on Christmas Day 1996.The Virgin Mary accounts for a substantial number of sightings of this type. A typical example is the \\"Clearwater Virgin\\", where an image of Mary was reported to have appeared in the glass fa√ßade of a finance building in Clearwater, Florida, and attracted widespread media attention. The building drew an estimated one million visitors over the next several years and was purchased by an Ohio Catholic revivalism group. A local chemist examined the windows and suggested the stain was produced by water deposits combined with weathering, yielding a chemical reaction like that often seen on old bottles, perhaps due to the action of the water sprinkler. On March 1, 2004, the three uppermost panes of the window were broken by a vandal. Other examples of Marian apparitions of this type that have received substantial press coverage include a fence in Coogee, Australia in 2003; a hospital in Milton, Massachusetts in June 2003; and a felled tree in Passaic, New Jersey in 2003. Images of the Virgin have also been reported on a rock in Ghana, an underpass in Chicago, a lump of firewood in Janesville, Wisconsin; a chocolate factory in Fountain Valley, California; and a pizza pan in Houston, Texas. A grilled cheese sandwich, a pretzel and a pebble said to resemble images of the Virgin Mary have been offered for sale on internet auction sites, the former being purchased by Internet casino GoldenPalace.com, which is known for its publicity stunts. Another image regularly reported is that of Jesus Christ. Sightings of this type have been reported in such varied media as cloud photos, Marmite, chapatis, shadows, Cheetos, tortillas, trees, dental x-rays, cooking utensils, windows rocks and stones, painted and plastered walls, and dogs' hindquarters. Again, some of these items have been offered for sale on internet auction sites, and a number have been bought by the Golden Palace casino. When such images receive publicity, people frequently come considerable distances to see them, and to venerate them. On April 30, 2002 the Hubble Space Science Institute released new photographs of the Cone Nebula, also known as the Space Mountain, to showcase a new extremely high resolution camera. Shortly afterwards some began to call it the \\"Jesus Nebula\\", believing they could see Jesus's face in it.Spring, Tom \\"In Pictures: The Most Spectacular Sights in Google Sky ‚Äì what Galileo saw and more\\" PC World October 2007 The new camera was installed on Hubble by astronauts during a space shuttle mission in March 2002. The Cone Nebula, located in the constellation Monoceros, is a region that contains cones, pillars, and majestic flowing shapes that abound in stellar nurseries where natal clouds of gas and dust are buffeted by energetic winds from nurseries of newborn stars. One controversial incident that received considerable publicity was when the face of Mother Teresa was claimed to have been identified in a cinnamon bun at Bongo Java in Nashville, Tennessee on 15 October 1996. Dubbed the \\"Nun Bun\\" by the press, it was turned into an enterprise by the company, selling T-shirts and mugs, which led to an exchange of letters between the company and Mother Teresa's representatives. On 25 December 2005 the bun was stolen during a break-in at the coffee house. This phenomenon can even take political meanings, such as the cross-shaped reflection seen on the East Berlin TV Tower, nicknamed \\"the Pope's revenge\\" and cited by Ronald Reagan as an example of the survival of religious ideas in the secular Communist society. In at least two instances, the images of deceased Anglican clergymen allegedly appeared on the walls of their church. In 1902, the image of a Dean Vaughan allegedly appeared on the walls of Llandaff cathedral, while the image of Dean Henry Liddell allegedly appeared on the walls of Christ Church, Oxford in 1923. Another example, either a miraculous sign or of face recognition pareidolia, originated in the fire at Notre Dame Cathedral, when a few observers claimed to see Jesus in the flames.  Examples in Islam  In the Muslim community, a frequently-reported religious perception is the image of the word \\"Allah\\" in Arabic on natural objects. Again, the discovery of such an object may attract considerable interest among believers who visit the object for the purpose of prayer or veneration. Examples of this phenomenon have been reported on fish, fruit and vegetables, plants and clouds, eggs, honeycombs, Explanation on the backcover: \\"In August 1982 a devout Muslim bee-keeper found this honeycomb in one of his beehives, in the village of Karakoy, Turkey. In the formation of the honeycomb the bees have written in large and clear letters the most beautiful name of the essence of God: Allah.\\" This is followed by a quotation from and on the markings on animals' coats. The Arabic script for the name of Allah is purported to be visible in a satellite photograph of the 2004 Asian tsunami. This was taken as evidence by some Muslims that Allah had sent the tsunami as punishment.  Other examples  Several Hindu murtis are held to be \\"self- manifest\\" or Swayambhu. Most are lingams of Shiva. = Monkey tree = In Jurong West, Singapore in September 2007, the discovery of calluses on a tree which look like the Hanuman, the monkey deity in the Hindu pantheon, created a social phenomenon. There are two nearby trees which also resemble deities. One features an apparent outline of Guan Yin, the goddess of mercy, and another resembles the Hindu elephant god Ganesha.  Created depictions  In some cases, apparent religious images have been deliberately created from natural materials as part of an artistic endeavor or investigation into the phenomenon of perceptions of religious imagery. The \\"Pope Tart\\" was a hoax apparition created by Karen Stollznow in 2005 as part of an investigation into pareidolia for The Skeptic in Australia. In other cases these deliberate images have been mere commercial ventures. The Jesus Toaster and The Virgin Mary Toaster were created by Galen Dively in 2010. These toasters create images of Jesus and Mary on bread.

The Blackstone is famous for hosting celebrity guests, including numerous U.S. presidents, for which it was known as the \\"Hotel of Presidents\\" for much of the 20th century, and for contributing the term \\"smoke-filled room\\" to political parlance.  History  The hotel and the adjacent establishment called then The Blackstone Theatre (now known as the Merle Reskin Theatre) were built on the site of Timothy Blackstone's mansion by John and Tracy Drake, sons of Blackstone's former business partner, the hotel magnate John Drake. John and Tracy Drake also developed the Drake Hotel. Their father had been a director of Blackstone's Chicago and Alton Railroad.Berger, Miles L., pp. various. At the time of the opening, the hotel and theatre were located at the southern edge of the Chicago Theatre District at Michigan Avenue and Hubbard Court (which was first renamed 7th Street and later Balbo Drive). The hotel was named for Timothy Blackstone, a notable Chicago business executive and politician, who served as the founding president of the Union Stock Yards, president of the Chicago and Alton Railroad, and mayor of La Salle, Illinois. It was built from 1908 to 1910 and designed by Marshall and Fox. The original construction was capitalized at $1.5 million ($ million today), including a $600,000 to $750,000 bond issue by the Drake Hotel Company.Berger, p. 155., ISBN. In the 1920s, the Drake Hotel Company undertook some financing arrangements which included extending their debt to construct the Drake Hotel. They used the Blackstone Hotel as collateral for one loan in 1927.Berger, p. 159., ISBN. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 rippled into the hotel industry, leaving the Chicago Title and Trust Company with 30 Chicago hotels in receivership and causing the Drakes to default in 1932. The hotel ended up belonging to Metropolitan Life, which held the mortgage. MetLife leased the Blackstone to hotelier Arnold Kirkeby in 1936, and Kirkeby bought the hotel outright in 1941.http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/PDFs/201375.pdf Kirkeby sold the hotel to Sheraton Hotels in 1954 and it was renamed the Sheraton-Blackstone Hotel. The hotel endured troubles in the late 1960s, as the neighborhood surrounding it declined, and Sheraton finally sold the property to local hotelier Mark Friedman on September 12, 1973, for $5 millionhttp://www.newspapers.com/newspage/71658015/ and the hotel became the Blackstone Hotel again. In 1995, the Blackstone was sold to the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. On May 29, 1998, the Blackstone Hotel was designated as a Chicago Landmark. The hotel was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 8, 1986. It is also a historic district contributing property for the Chicago Landmark Historic Michigan Boulevard District. The hotel closed in 2000 after Occupational Safety and Health Administration building inspectors found safety problems during a 1999 inspection. The building's owner, Heaven on Earth Inns Corp, run by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, looked into several options before selling the property to Rubloff, Inc., which in 2001 announced plans to convert the building into condominiums priced as high as $8.5 million. Rubloff's plans were unsuccessful due to financing difficulties and a lackluster market for buyers of Blackstone condominiums. Even two rounds of price cuts were not enough to spur interest in the condo opportunities and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's non-profit organization was unable to obtain financing. The years of neglect following the closing of the hotel took a toll on the building's appearance with both the interior and exterior facade crumbling. In 2005, it was announced that the hotel would undergo a $112 million renovation and acquisition ($22 million of the expected $112 million was the cost associated with the acquisition) with a planned opening in 2007 in a deal between Marriott International/Renaissance Hotels and Sage Hospitality, a Denver, Colorado-based company. The hotel's restoration process was quite lengthy because of the extensive interior damage. Sage sought $22 million in tax increment financing from the Chicago Community Development Commission. They eventually were approved for $18 million in tax-increment financing. The final cost of the restoration came to $128 million, of which the city of Chicago provided $13.5 million for street-front improvement, including the restoration and recasting of over 10,000 pieces of decorative terra cotta, and federal historical tax credits because the building is a historical landmark. The Chicago Landmark status necessitated renovation oversight by the Commission on Chicago Landmarks. View along Michigan Avenue outside of The Blackstone of crowds leaving Grant Park after Barack Obama's 2008 election victory speech Sage had been interested in the property long before the condominium conversion was attempted. The newly restored hotel reopened on March 2, 2008, as the Renaissance Blackstone Hotel. Sage uses the Renaissance brand \\"for hotels that are very unique in terms of location, style, design, or historic values\\". The other parties involved in the restoration were local architect Lucien Lagrange and hotel interior design, development, and procurement firm Gettys, for design work. James McHugh Construction Co. was responsible for construction. The engineering firm handling the exterior renovation was Illinois-based Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc.Engineering News-Record  ENR The restoration resulted in 332 rooms, 12 suites, and of meeting space. The 21-story hotel is now equipped with a health club, a business center, and a street-level cafe with outdoor seating area. As part of the restorations, sconces and chandeliers were restored. Many of the details, such as brass fittings, several of the statues and the original chandeliers, had been sold off. However, Sage was able to repurchase many of them on eBay and refabricate many others. The primary historic facades were fully restored, including the hotel's ornate terra cotta-clad exterior. All the guest-room floors were reconfigured and dramatically enlarged. Some have described the restoration as \\"garish\\". Only two guest rooms were preserved during the restoration: the famous ninth-floor \\"smoke-filled room\\" and the original tenth-floor presidential suite. They both retained their original floors, fireplaces, and structural shapes. However, the Presidential Suite's famed hidden passage behind the fireplace‚Äîwhich allowed the president to exit through the hotel's eastern stairwell unnoticed‚Äîhas been converted into closet space. Notable features that failed to survive the renovation were a barbershop, which has been converted to a rentable meeting room named \\"the barbershop\\", and the theater, which was converted to the Blackstone's bar and restaurant. On June 7, 2017, The Blackstone was transferred from Marriott's Renaissance Hotels division to their Autograph Hotels division and returned to its historic name, The Blackstone Hotel. The transition included a renovation to update the look of the hotel with a historic meets-contemporary-feel by revitalizing the soft goods of the guest rooms, meeting spaces and lobby. The hotel also opened a bar in the lobby called Timothy's Hutch, paying homage to the hotel's namesake, Timothy Blackstone.  Hotel and politics  The Blackstone Hotel has been dubbed \\"The Hotel of Presidents\\". It was once considered one of Chicago's finest luxury hotels, and a dozen 20th-century U.S. presidents have stayed at the hotel. In addition, the Blackstone has also become part of Chicago's history as the city that has hosted more United States presidential nominating conventions (26) than any other two American cities, a history which goes back to the 1860 Republican National Convention hosted at the Wigwam. The Blackstone also hosted first Czechoslovak president T.G.Masaryk. The hotel has a special room designed for use by presidents which was separated from the rest of the hotel by hollowed out walls in which the Secret Service could operate. In 1911, Republican businessman and philanthropist Julius Rosenwald‚Äîthen president of Sears, Roebuck & Company‚Äîinvited African American educator Booker T. Washington and a few dozen of Chicago's leading citizens to discuss raising funds for Washington's Tuskegee Institute. Washington became the hotel's first African American guest. As a result of the meeting, Rosenwald became a supporter and trustee of Tuskegee, and the following year initiated a campaign to fund the construction and support of schools throughout the South to provide an education to black children, by the time of his death building nearly 5000 schools educating well over half a million African American children. In 1920, Warren G. Harding was selected as the Republican candidate for the presidency at the Blackstone. Although the convention was being held at the Chicago Coliseum, a group of Republican leaders met at the Blackstone on the night of June 11 to come to a consensus. When Raymond Clapper of United Press reported on the decision-making process, the reporter stated it had been made \\"in a smoke-filled room\\". The phrase entered American political parlance to denote a political process which is not open to scrutiny. In addition, the Blackstone is where Franklin Delano Roosevelt's third-term Democratic presidential nomination was forged in 1940, where Harry S. Truman stayed when he received the 1944 Democratic vice presidential nomination and where Dwight D. Eisenhower heard the news of his first-ballot 1952 Republican presidential nomination. In all, guests have included at least 12 U.S. presidents: Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, Woodrow Wilson, Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, and Jimmy Carter. During Kennedy's visit he was informed of the Cuban Missile Crisis.  Architecture  The Blackstone Hotel was designed by architect Benjamin Marshall, of Marshall and Fox, in 1909.\\"Blackstone Hotel,\\" (PDF), HAARGIS Database, Illinois Historic Preservation Agency. Retrieved June 15, 2007. Sources vary as to the precise style in which Marshall designed the building.Mougey, Paul. \\"Chicago's cinematic allure,\\" USA Today, November 3, 2003. Retrieved June 16, 2007.McBrien, Judith Paine. Pocket Guide to Chicago Architecture, (Google Books), 2004, W. W. Norton & Company, p. 11, (). Retrieved June 16, 2007. According to the Landmarks Division of the City of Chicago's Department of Planning and Development, the hotel's exterior and interior are considered an excellent example of neoclassical Beaux-Arts architecture; the nomination form for the building's listing on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places classifies the structure as distinctly Second Empire. However, the two styles are related, and the Blackstone Hotel demonstrates elements from both schools. The design was influenced by Marshall's trip to Paris, after which he completed the hotel. The Blackstone is a 22-floor rectangular structure and its structural steel frame is cased in tile and plaster fireproofing. On the exterior south and east (front) elevations is a one-story base of pink granite, with high arched openings; it supports the red brick- and terra cotta-trimmed building shaft.Steiner, Frances H., \\"The Architecture of Chicago's Loop,\\" pg. 124, The Sigma Press, 1998, () Above the granite base are four stories of white, glazed terra cotta. The large windows of the second and third floor, which once poured natural light into the lobby, ballroom, and restaurants, have mostly been covered for a theater. The majority of the building rises as a 12-story shaft of red brick dotted with white, terra cotta window surrounds; above this section is a belt course of terra cotta and two stories of red brick. Above this, the original design included an intermediate terra cotta cornice topped by a cast-iron railing. This has been removed and replaced with red brick and white glazed brick, flush with the rest of the building. The mansard roof was originally decorated with small spires around the perimeter, and 2 very tall flagpoles.  In popular culture  In addition to its celebrity guests and its contributions to political parlance, the Blackstone has a place in popular culture. Among its uses in cinema, it hosted the banquet where Al Capone smashes a guest's head with a baseball bat in the Brian De Palma film The Untouchables, a party in The Hudsucker Proxy, and Tom Cruise's pre-pool tourney stay in The Color of Money. Also, the 1996‚Äì2000 television series Early Edition was set in this building, featuring a man (Kyle Chandler) who lives in the hotel and receives the newspaper a day in advance.

It saw action on the Western Front in the First World War and later became a searchlight unit of the Royal Artillery in the Second World War. Origins Gladstone was a leading figure in the Volunteer Movement at that time, serving on the War Office committee that drew up rules for RVCs in August 1859, and on the founding committee of the National Rifle Association of the United Kingdom in October that year.Beckett, pp. 24 & 33. In 1860 he leased land from Lord Sefton to create the Altcar Rifle Range. Gladstone died in 1863.Adam Steuart Gladstone at Genealogy Links As the number of RVCs grew rapidly during 1860, the smaller company-sized units were grouped into Administrative Battalions.

The individual character of the companies was lost in the reorganisation, but a new Liverpool Scottish battalion reformed in 1900, and the 46th (Liverpool Welsh) Royal Tank Regiment was formed in 1939. The 5th Lancashire RVC became a volunteer battalion of the King's Regiment (Liverpool) as part of the Childers Reforms in 1881 (and was designated as the 2nd Volunteer Battalion from 1888). By that time Robert Tilney was the Commanding Officer with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, when he was awarded a CB.London Gazette 24 May 1881.

It formed part of the Liverpool Brigade in the West Lancashire Division of the TF.London Gazette 20 March 1908.Mark Conrad, The British Army, 1914. First World War When war broke out in August 1914 the Territorial Force had just begun its annual training camps. The 6th Battalion, Kings Regiment immediately returned to Prince's Park Barracks to mobilise. However, the West Lancashire Division did not go to war as a single formation: its infantry battalions volunteered for Foreign Service and went to the Western Front separately as reinforcements for the British Expeditionary Force.James, p/ 51.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 133‚Äì9.King's Liverpool at Regimental WarpathKing's (Liverpool) at Long, Long Trail55 Division at Long, Long Trail These were termed First Line battalions, while Home Service men, recruits and the unfit were transferred to Second Line battalions: the 2/6th King's was formed at Liverpool on 10 September 1914.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 1‚Äì7. Later the 2/6th King's was brought up to war readiness in the 2nd Liverpool Brigade of 2nd West Lancashire Division and a Third Line battalion (3/6th) was formed as reserve to provide drafts to the 1/6th and 2/6th.57 Division at Long, Long Trail =1/6th (Rifle) Battalion= The battalion moved to Canterbury, Kent in the autumn of 1914. In February 1915 it was sent to France, disembarking at Le Havre on 25 February 1915 and joining 15th Brigade in the Regular 5th Division.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 133‚Äì9.Becke, Pt 1, pp. 65‚Äì71. Soon after the battalion's arrival, 15th Brigade was temporarily transferred to the Regular 28th Division, but returned to the 5th in time for the fighting around Ypres in April 1915.Becke, Pt 1, pp. 105‚Äì111. The 1/6th's first major engagement occurred on 5 May, in a German attack on Hill 60 during the Second Battle of Ypres. Control of Hill 60 had briefly fluctuated after its capture in a British attack on 17 April, but fighting ended with the British in possession.'The Capture of Hill 60 in 1915' at Firstworldwar.com. Poison gas was used during the preliminary German attack, facilitating the assault against positions held by the 2nd Duke of Wellington's Regiment.Hill 60 at 1914-18.co.uk After Hill 60 was lost, companies from the Liverpool Rifles were used successively in support of the 1st Battalion, Cheshire Regiment; \\"C\\" Company, heavily engaged, suffered 60 casualties.Wyrall (2002), p123-130 The Liverpool Rifles collectively sustained nearly 100 casualties between the period of 5 May-6 May, 22 of whom were killed.Wyrall (2002), p131 German control of Hill 60 was consolidated by 7 May. In November the Liverpool Rifles left the 5th Division to become Third Army Troops. By now the Army Council had decided to reform the West Lancashire Territorial Division in France as the 55th (West Lancashire) Division. 1/6th King's rejoined the Liverpool Brigade (now numbered as the 165th (Liverpool) Brigade on 26 January 1916. 1/6th King's served on the Western Front for the remainder of the war, participating in the following actions: 1916 * Battle of the Somme ** Battle of Guillemont, 4‚Äì6 September ** Battle of Ginchy, 9 September ** Battle of Flers‚ÄìCourcelette, 17‚Äì22 September ** Battle of Morval, 25‚Äì28 September 1917 * Third Battle of Ypres ** Battle of Pilckem Ridge, 31 July‚Äì2 August ** Battle of the Menin Road Ridge, 20‚Äì23 September * Battle of Cambrai ** The Tank Attack, 20‚Äì21 November ** German Counter-Attacks, 30 November‚Äì3 December 1918 * Battle of the Lys ** Battle of Estaires, 9‚Äì11 April ** Defence of Givenchy, 9‚Äì17 April ** Battle of Hazebrouck, 12‚Äì15 April * Advance to Victory ** Capture of Givenchy Craters, 24 August ** Capture of Cateleux Trench, 17 September (by the Liverpool Brigade) On 2 October 1918 the Germans started to withdraw on 55 Division's front and the troops pushed forward and occupied La Bass√©e the same day. They forced the line of the Haute Deule Canal on 14‚Äì16 October and captured Ath early on 11 November. When the Armistice with Germany came into force at 11.00 on 11 November, the division had reached a line seven miles east of Ath. On 15 November the division was ordered to advance into Germany as part of the occupation forces, but this was cancelled on 21 November, and the division was chiefly employed on railway reconstruction and road repair. By 18 December the division had moved to Brussels. Demobilisation proceeded during January 1919 and the division had dwindled to small numbers by the end of April 1919 as men went home. The battalion was disembodied on 16 June 1919. =2/6th (Rifle) Battalion= The 2/6th Battalion was formed on 10 September 1914 at Liverpool The 2nd West Lancashire Division assembled around Canterbury, with 2/6th Battalion at Margate from 15 March 1915 and at Upstreet Camp on 13 July 1915 The division was numbered 57th (2nd West Lancashire) Division in August 1915, the 2/6th King's forming part of 171st (2/1st Liverpool) Brigade. At first the battalion only had .256-in Japanese Ariska rifles with which to train. In late November, they received .303 Le-Enfield rifles; although many of these were in poor condition, the Japanese rifles could now be returned to store. Towards the end of February 1916 the battalion received its Lewis guns. In July 1916 the 57th Division moved to Aldershot Command for final training, with 2/6th Battalion at Bourley, and then at Inkerman Barracks, Woking, from 27 September 1916. On 14 February 1917 the 2/6th King's landed at Boulogne. It went into the line on 25 February and served on the Western Front for the remainder of the war, participating in the following actions: 1917 * Second Battle of Passchendaele, 26 October‚Äì7 November 1918 * Second Battle of Arras ** Battle of the Scarpe, 28‚Äì30 August ** Battle of Drocourt-Qu√©ant Line, 2‚Äì3 September * Battle of the Hindenburg Line ** Battle of the Canal du Nord, 27 September‚Äì1 October ** Battle of Cambrai, 8‚Äì9 October ** Capture of Cambrai, 9 October * Final Advance in Artois and Flanders ** Occupation of Lille, 17 October On 1 November 1918, 57th Division was relieved in the front line and went into billets. It was still resting when hostilities ended on 11 November. After the Armistice, the troops were engaged in collecting and evacuating stores in the Arras area. Demobilisation began in January 1919 and by March the units had been reduced to cadres, the last of which left for England on 25 June. The battalion was disbanded on 20 May 1919 at Landguard Common. =3/6th Battalion= The 3/6th King's was formed in Liverpool in May 1915 and moved to Blackpool in the autumn. Its role was to train drafts for the 1/6th and 2/6th battalions. In early 1916 it moved to Oswestry, and then in April it became the 6th (Reserve) Battalion, King's in the West Lancashire Reserve Brigade. On 1 September 1916 6th (Reserve) Bn was absorbed into the 5th (Reserve) Bn.Training Bns TF at Warpath Interwar years C Company of the 6th (Rifle) Battalion at Kinmel Park, near Rhyl, Wales. (July 1931). The 6th (Rifle) Battalion, King's Regiment reformed in the TF (Territorial Army (TA) from 1921) on 7 February 1920. It was supposed to have amalgamated with the 5th Bn King's in 1922, but the order was rescinded. It became part of 165th (Liverpool) Brigade, part of the reformed 55th (West Lancashire) Division.Titles & Designations, 1927. =38th (The King's Regiment) AA Battalion= In the 1930s the increasing need for anti-aircraft (AA) defence for Britain's cities was met by converting TA infantry battalions to that role. On 10 December 1936 the 6th (Rifle) Battalion was converted into a searchlight unit of the Royal Engineers (RE) as 38th (The King's Regiment) Anti-Aircraft Battalion, RE (TA), with HQ, 351 and 352 AA Companies at The Drill Hall, Mather Ave, Liverpool, and 350 and 353 AA Companies at Princes Park Barracks. The unit was assigned to 33rd (Western) AA Group (later Brigade) in 2nd AA Division.Frederick, pp. 859, 866.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 109, 113.Army List. Second World War =Mobilisation= 90 cm Projector Anti- Aircraft, displayed at Fort Nelson, Hampshire. The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October.Routledge, pp. 62‚Äì3. In February 1939 the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6, 371. 38th AA Battalion was still in 33rd AA Bde based at Woolton, Liverpool, but this was now part of 4th AA Division at Chester.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot FilesRoutledge Table LX, p. 378. In August 1940 the RE AA Battalions were transferred to the Royal Artillery (RA), when the battalion was redesignated 38th (The Kings Regiment) Searchlight Regiment, RA (TA). The men continued to wear a 'Liverpool Rifles' shoulder title with red lettering on a Rifle green background.Litchfield, p. 132.Farndale, Annex M, p. 339.38 SL Rgt at RA 1939‚Äì45. =Blitz and Orkneys= The regiment served througth the early part of The Blitz in the autumn of 1940.

Then, while 352 S/L Bty remained attached to 2nd AA Division, the rest of the regiment went to Orkney, where it joined 59th AA Bde in the Orkney and Shetland Defences (OSDEF), protecting the Home Fleet's base at Scapa Flow.Organization of the Field Force in the United Kingdom and Order of Battle, Part 12, Orkney and Shetland Defences, 1940, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 212/114.Organization of the Field Force in the United Kingdom and Order of Battle, Part 12, Orkney and Shetland Defences, 3 March 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/115.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, TNA file WO 212/79. Meanwhile, in the Midlands where 352 S/L Bty was deployed, the searchlight layout was reorganised in 1941, so that any hostile raid approaching the Gun Defended Areas (GDA) around the towns must cross more than one searchlight belt, and then within the GDAs the concentration of lights was increased. Increasing numbers of Searchlight Control (SLC) radar sets also became available.Routledge, p. 399. Demonstration of No 2 Mk VI SLC ('Elsie') The regiment returned to the mainland UK by mid-November 1941 and was reunited with 352 S/L Bty in 68th AA Bde in 11th AA Division (later 4 AA Group) covering the West Midlands.

The regiment moved to join 27th AA Bde controlling S/Ls over South Eastern England for 2 AA Group. Between 21 January and 14 March 1944 the Luftwaffe carried out 11 conventional night raids on London in the so-called 'Baby Blitz'. These raids were met by intense AA fire and Royal Air Force night- fighters, which scored an impressive number of 'kills' in conjunction with radar-controlled S/Ls.Routledge, pp. 408‚Äì11. AA Command was now being forced to release manpower for the planned Allied invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord), and all Home Defence searchlight regiments were reduced by one battery. 353 Battery commenced disbandment on 7 February 1944, completing by 28 February. AA Command also had the task of protecting the Overlord assembly areas and ports: in May and June 1944, while the build-up for Overlord was at its height, 38th S/L Rgt was transferred to the command of 38th AA Bde in 2 AA Group (covering the Thames Estuary), but returned a month later.Order of Battle of AA Command, 27 April 1944, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/85. The beginning of the V-1 campaign against London came on 13 June, a week after Overlord was launched on D Day, and Operation Diver was put into effect. The S/L positions had been established at intervals to cooperate with RAF night- fighters, and each position also had a Bofors 40 mm light AA gun. After a poor start the guns and fighters began to gain a measure of control over the flying bombs, and by the end of the first phase of the operation, after 21st Army Group had overrun the launch sites in Northern France in September, 1800 night fighter interceptions had been achieved, of which 142 were due to S/L illumination. In the autumn the focus switched to East Anglia when the Luftwaffe began air-launching V-1s over the North Sea.Routledge, pp. 410‚Äì5. =635 (King's Regiment) Infantry Regiment= By January 1945 21st Army Group fighting in North West Europe was suffering a severe manpower shortage, particularly among the infantry.Ellis, pp. 141‚Äì2. At the same time the German Luftwaffe was suffering from such shortages of pilots, aircraft and fuel that serious aerial attacks on the UK could be discounted. In January 1945 the War Office began to reorganise surplus AA units in the UK into infantry battalions, primarily for line of communication and occupation duties, thereby releasing trained infantry for frontline service.Ellis, pp. 369, 380. 27th AA Brigade was one formation chosen for this conversion, becoming 303 Brigade, in which 38th S/L Rgt became 635 (King's Regiment) Infantry Regiment RA on 23 January 1945.Frederick, p. 883.Joslen, p. 399.635 Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45. After infantry training, including a short period attached to 61st Infantry Division, 303 Bde was sent to Norway in June 1945 following the liberation of that country (Operation Doomsday). 635 Regiment was placed in suspended animation at Colchester on 31 January 1946. Postwar When the TA was reconstituted on 1 January 1947, 635 Regiment reformed as 573 (The King's Regiment) (Mixed) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment RA (TA), based at Liverpool and attached to 79th Anti-Aircraft Brigade at Woolton. (The term 'Mixed' indicated that members of the Women's Royal Army Corps were integrated into the regiment.)Frederick, p. 1023.Litchfield, Appendix 5.Watson, TA 1947564‚Äì591 Regiments at British Army units from 1945 on 266-288 Regiments at British Army units from 1945 on On 10 March 1955, Anti-Aircraft Command was disbanded, and 573 HAA Regiment was merged into 287 (1st West Lancashire) Medium Regiment, becoming Q (King's) Battery. After another regiment was absorbed the battery became R (King's) Battery on 31 October 1956. It was amalgamated into Q (1st West Lancashire) Battery on 1 May 1961.Frederick, p. 1002. 573 HAA Regiment, and later R (King's) Battery of 287 Regiment, wore an arm badge of a black rose over a strung bugle horn on a red rectangle, based on the Liverpool Rifles cap badge.Litchfield, p. 120. In the 1967 reduction of the TA into the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve (TAVR), B Troop (The Liverpool Rifles) was formed from 287 Regiment in the new West Lancashire Regiment RA, but this in turn was reduced to a cadre in 1969 and absorbed into 208 (3rd West Lancashire Artillery) Battery of 103rd (Lancashire Artillery Volunteers) Regiment Royal Artillery in 1973.West Lancashire Rgt, RA, at Regiments.org.Royal Regiment of Artillery, Volunteer Regiments at Lineage of British Army Regiments, 1967‚Äì2000.

Early history The earliest records of Kellie go back to 1150 where it is mentioned in a charter issued by King David I. The first known owner was Robert of London, the illegitimate son of King William the Lion. By 1266 Kellie had passed to the Siward family, who had hailed from Northumbria and had assisted King Malcolm Canmore to overthrow Macbeth. The Siewards supported England during the wars of independence (1296-1328) and as a result Sir Richard Sieward forfeited his lands in Scotland after Bannockburn. However his daughter Helena Sieward, ‚ÄúLady Kellie‚Äù retained Kellie. None of the buildings they occupied appear to have survived. In about 1360 Helena, or Elena, assigned Kellie to her kinsman Walter Olifard (or Oliphant) of Aberdalgie who was married to Elizabeth, a daughter of Robert the Bruce. Thus began 250 years of occupation by the Oliphant family. The estate was signed over to a Siward relative, Walter Oliphant, in 1360 and the castle remained in the ownership of the Oliphant family until 1613. It was purchased by Sir Thomas Erskine, who had saved the life of King James VI during the Gowrie Conspiracy by killing Sir Alexander Ruthven. The King stayed at Kellie in 1617 during his only visit to Scotland after the Union of the Crowns, and he appointed Erskine as Earl of Kellie in 1619. It is likely that the ceiling of what is now the library in the 1573 east tower was decorated in plaster in anticipation of a Royal visit by King James. This room may be the first in Scotland where plaster decoration was used ‚Äòin the London style‚Äô in preference to the painted beams and boarded ceilings that were generally fashionable in the early 17th century. Incorporated in the ceiling is the date \\"1617\\" and monogram \\"T V F\\" for Thomas Viscount Fenton,which title the King awarded Thomas Erskine in 1606. Kellie Castle (rear view) Originally a simple tower house, the lower section of what now constitutes the northwest tower is the oldest part of the castle, dating from around 1360, and is said to be haunted. In 1573 a new tower was built by the 4th Lord Oliphant to the east of the original tower. It is believed that the 4th Lord built the east tower as a jointure-house (a property set aside for the wife after the husband's death) for his wife Margaret. Between 1573 and 1606 the two towers were linked by a new range, terminated by another tower in the south-west, creating the T-plan layout that remains today. The castle is a fine example of Scots Baronial domestic architecture, with an imposing mix of gables, corbelled towers, and chimneys. Recent history Methven Erskine the 10th Earl of Kellie died in 1829 to be succeeded by John Francis Miller Erskine as 11th Earl of Kellie. The castle was abandoned by Erskine and cleared of its contents at a muckle roup (public auction) in 1830. John Francis Miller Erskine was confirmed as 26th Earl of Mar in 1835 and the Earldom of Kellie was united with the Earldom of Mar. The property then seems to have fallen to James Maitland Hog of Newliston (thereafter titled \\"of Newliston and Kellie\\") but Hog made little use of the estate, and the castle lay abandoned for many years. In 1878 it was rented from the Earl of Mar and Kellie by James Lorimer, Regius Professor of Public Law at Edinburgh University, and father to Sir Robert Lorimer, the renowned Scottish architect. The Lorimer family set about restoring the castle for use as a holiday retreat, but it soon became the family home. Robert Lorimer was instrumental in much of the restoration work, restoring magnificent plaster ceilings, painted panelling and furniture. There are examples of Robert Lorimer‚Äôs work as an architect across the world. At Kellie we have the doocot and garden house as well as the restoration of the garden with his sister Caroline-Louise. The Kellie Castle survey drawing (1887) featured at Kellie, illustrates his draftsmanship. Close to Kellie is the renovation and extension of Lundie Cottage (1902) in Ancroach. The interesting dormer windows can be seen from the roadway, opposite the church, as you drive west into the village. Following the death of the professor the tenancy was taken by his wife Hannah in 1890. Robert Lorimer began the first of his alterations in 1900: building a doocot and garden house. On the death of Hannah in 1916 the tenancy was taken over by their son, John Henry Lorimer the famous Scottish painter. Robert then began work on restoring the main house, this previously having been resisted by Hannah. Upon John's death in 1936, the tenancy lapsed and the house was cleared and the castle once again became vacant. In 1936 Sir Robert's son, the sculptor Hew Lorimer and his wife Mary, renewed the Lorimer tenancy. Hew and Mary Lorimer purchased the castle in 1948 and it remained in his ownership until 1970. Between 1970 and 1990 Hew continued to live in part of the castle and used the stable block as his studio. Kellie Castle Gardens Present day Hew Lorimer sold the castle, together with 6.5 hectares of gardens and an organic walled garden to the National Trust for Scotland in 1970. The walled garden is 17th century, with late Victorian additions, and contains a fine collection of old-fashioned roses, fruit trees and herbaceous plants. The main castle contents were given into the care of the Trust by the Secretary of State for Scotland and, in 1998 the Trust purchased the Lorimer family artifacts. Amongst these artifacts are included paintings by Hannah Cassels im Thurn, the eldest daughter of Hannah and James Lorimer. The castle and gardens are open to the public, and there is a permanent exhibition of Hew Lorimer's work and studio in the old stables. Interior Phoebe Anna Traquair, who was an outstanding proponent of the Arts and Crafts philosophy, completed the painted panel above the fireplace in the drawing room in 1897. The painting is based on Botticelli's Primavera and was completed when John Henry Lorimer lived in the castle. Hew and Mary Lorimer, who took over the tenancy after John Henry, apparently did not like the painting and they had it covered in the late 1940s. They were careful not to damage the painting and they used cartridge paper with flour paste. The painting was restored in 1996 by the National Trust for Scotland following the death of Hew Lorimer who had remained at Kellie and lived in part of the east tower of the castle until 1990. The tapestry now in the dining room is made up of at least two, possibly three, different tapestries. The centre and main element is a Flemish tapestry (1580) that depicts Europa and the Bull. This tapestry used to be located in the drawing room as illustrated in a Country Life photograph taken in 1964. The beauty of Europa inspired the love of Zeus, who approached her in the form of a white bull. He carried her away from Phoenicia to Crete. The Latin inscription, which does not refer or relate to the main tapestry ‚Äì‚ÄòThe young man has saved his wounded father, carried him back and put him on his horse'. The borders have been added at some later time. In the 1930s John Henry Lorimer was vice-president of what was then known as the Edinburgh Astronomical Association and now The Astronomical Society of Edinburgh. Upon his death in 1936 he left a substantial legacy to the society who now award a medal in his honour. The society owns a bust of John Henry and two of his paintings. The bust and both paintings, ‚ÄúSunlight in the South Room, Kellie‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Long Shadows‚Äù, are exhibited at Kellie Castle. The largest room in the castle, used by the Lorimers as the drawing room, is the Great Hall, completed circa 1606. On the west wall are two mirrors with eagle cresting, designed by Sir Robert Lorimer and made by Whytock and Reid of Edinburgh. These mirrors, hanging on either side of the west window, appear to have a magical effect. No matter how far back you go, your image appears to stay the same size.

Jelly shoes come in a large variety of brands and colors and the material is frequently infused with glitter. Its name refers to the semi- transparent materials with a jelly-like sheen. The shoes became a fad in the early 1980s, when a pair could frequently be purchased for less than one US dollar. Like many other fashion trends from the 1980s, jellies have been revived a number of times since the late 1990s. Although considered a populist shoe in the 1980s, the jelly shoe has been reinterpreted by a number of high- end fashion designers in the early twenty-first century. The exact origins of the jelly shoes are unclear. A frequently offered explanation is that they were designed by a shoe maker in France after World War II, when there was a leather shortage in Europe. Another possibility is that the shoes were created somewhere in the late 1950s or early 1960s, when plastic became a commonplace material, and fashion designers began to experiment with it. Black and brown t-bar jellies sandals were popular school wear for boys and girls in Australia during the 50s and 60s. The Brazil-based shoe company Grendene Shoes claims to have introduced the jelly shoes to the US market in 1982, though a New York Times article published on June 1, 1980 also mentions them. (complete text) In 1981, a bank president named Preston Haag Sr. quit his job to look for a business that would involve his family. He traveled to South America where he began visiting American ambassadors to find potential products for the United States. At a reception in Brazil, Haag noted bright shoes worn by many young women. He inquired and learned that the manufacturer was Grendene, a small company that employed 3,000 of the 10,000 people living in Farroupilha, Brazil. In March 1981, Haag struck a deal to distribute Grendene's plastic shoes in the southeastern US through a new company named Grendha, which introduced the shoes during the 1982 World's Fair. While successful, according to Haag the jellies really landed on the map in America in February 1983, after Bloomingdale's, a trendy department store in New York City, ordered 2,400 pairs in nine styles. Jelly shoes companies like Holster in Australia are now adding trending health features and benefits to the shoes as well. Holster's jelly shoes are recyclable, odor resistant and non-toxic, which have been distributed to 2,200 retail stores globally. Jelly shoes are vegan- friendly and offer alternative shoes that are not made from leather. Brazilian shoe store, Melissa Shoes, opened locations in New York City, London, Spain and three locations in Florida because it experienced a continuous increase in sales regarding its eco-friendly shoes. Jelly shoes come in a variety of styles such as flats, heels and wedges. They are known to be comfortable shoes for the winter, fall and spring seasons.

Sound On this album, Nagelfar combined Northern black metal influences with their own rhythmicity and influences from their Teutonic thrash metal background. The vocals were partly \\"crazily screamed\\", partly clean and \\"heroically sung\\". The production by Andy Classen, who had never worked with black metal bands before, gave them \\"a brutal yet 'true' sound\\". The production, which was \\"extremely fat and punchy for black metal conditions\\", is considered \\"an important building stone for the success of this album\\". Drummer Alexander von Meilenwald believes the band distanced themselves from the Scandinavian sound with H√ºnengrab im Herbst; according to him, the album \\"did not sound as black metal did at that time\\".Wolf-R√ºdiger M√ºhlmann: Die K√∂nige vom Westwall.

His career has focused on the application of physical ideas, especially the laws of thermodynamics, to economics; a long-standing pioneering interest in material flows and transformations (industrial ecology or industrial metabolism)‚Äîa concept which he originated. His most recent work challenges the widely held economic theory of growth. Career Trained as a physicist at the University of Chicago, University of Maryland, and King's College London (PhD in Mathematical Physics), Ayres has dedicated his professional life to advancing the environment, technology and resource end of the sustainability agenda. His major research interests include technological change, environmental economics, \\"industrial metabolism\\" and \\"eco- restructuring\\". He has worked at the Hudson Institute (1962‚Äì67), Resources for the Future Inc (1968) and International Research and Technology Corp (1969‚Äì76). From 1979 until 1992 he was Professor of Engineering and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, except for two years (and six summers) on leave at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Laxenburg Austria. In 1992 he moved to the international business school INSEAD in Fontainebleau, France as Sandoz (later Novartis) Professor of Environment and Management. Since his formal retirement in 2000 he has been Jubilee Visiting Professor (2000‚Äì2001) and king Karl Gustav XVI professor of environmental science (2004‚Äì2005) at Chalmers Institute of Technology Gothenburg (Sweden). He is currently an Institute Scholar at IIASA. He remains an active researcher. He has written or co- authored 20 books, edited or coedited another dozen books, written or co- authored more than 200 journal articles and book chapters not to mention many unpublished reports, on subjects ranging from environmental effects of nuclear war to theoretical economics. But most of his life-work is interdisciplinary. He was a pioneer of a new field, sometimes called Industrial Metabolism or Industrial Ecology. He has contributed to futures studies, technological forecasting, transportation and energy studies, material flow studies (\`dematerialization'), environmental technology, environmental economics, thermodynamics and economics, and the theory of economic growth. Here taken from one of his recent papers are two paragraphs that provide a flavor of his recent work: > Mainstream economics today is based to a large extent on bad ideas. Economic > concepts, from foundational issues like markets, supply and demand and ‚Äúfree > trade‚Äù, to money and finance, lack any systematic awareness of the physical > process of production or the implications of the Laws of Thermodynamics for > those processes. A corollary, almost worthy of being a separate bad idea on > its own, is that energy doesn‚Äôt matter (much) because the cost share of > energy in the economy is so small that it can be ignored e.g. {Denison, 1984 > #6184}. The so-called ‚Äúproduction functions‚Äù used by all schools of economic > thought that build growth models omit any necessary role for energy, as if > output could be produced by labor and capital alone‚Äîor as if energy is > merely a form of man-made capital that can be produced (as opposed to > extracted) by labor and capital. The essential truth missing from economic > education today is that energy is the stuff of the universe, that all matter > is also a form of energy, and that the economic system is essentially a > system for extracting, processing and transforming energy as resources into > energy embodied in products and services. This is a thermodynamic process, > as the Rumanian economist Georgescu-Roegen said half a century ago > (Georgescu-Roegen 1971). The economic process is subject to both the first > law of thermodynamics (conservation of mass/energy; nothing can be created > or destroyed) and the second law of thermodynamics (increasing entropy; all > transformation processes are irreversible).

He was the original drummer for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers for 18 years until his departure in 1994.  Early years  Lynch was born in Cincinnati,According to Colin Larkin, Gainesville is Lynch's place of birth. Ohio, U.S., and moved to Gainesville, Florida, in the early 1960s. He began playing music as a small child. As a teenager growing up near Gainesville, Lynch determined that he would find a way to make a living with music. \\"As a kid I had very little opportunity. I was a marginal student. I wasn't going to college. My parents didn't have money.\\" \\"I played guitar and piano, and I always thought I was going to be a guitar player,\\" said Lynch. \\"The drums were sort of a happy accident. I didn't really think that they would be my ticket out of the ghetto. Choosing to be a musician back then was not like choosing a job, but an entire lifestyle. My father looked at me as if I were going to wear a dress and dance in the circus.\\" Lynch was always involved in fights at school so his friends reasoned that the high-strung youth might be able to rip the aggression with drums. His parents made him take lessons before they bought him a kit, and he recalls with a laugh, \\"as soon as I got my first set they took up tennis‚Äîthey just split, and I don't blame them.\\"  The Heartbreakers  Lynch started to work with various Florida bands, among them Styrophoam Soule and Road Turkey, and when he was 15 he met Ron Blair, who was six years older than Lynch. \\"I remember he accused me of stealing an amp from him. Hell, I didn't steal it. I was roadieing for him!\\" Drums didn't absorb all of Lynch's feistiness as his parents had hoped, although he stayed in school long enough to graduate from P.K. Yonge School in 1973. Lynch moved to Los Angeles, and hooked up again with fellow Floridian Ron Blair, during a recording session set up by Benmont Tench in 1976. The session also included Jacksonville native Mike Campbell. Benmont called Tom Petty, also from Gainesville, to ask for some help with some vocals. While they were taking a break Petty looked into the recording studio and thought to himself \\"this should be my band\\".From Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers: Runnin' Down a Dream spoken by Petty Petty had come out to LA with his band Mudcrutch, which Tench and Campbell were originally a part of, and had a recording contract. But once in LA the producers decided they were not keen on the rest of the band, so it broke up, leaving Petty basically a solo act ‚Äî something he was not happy about. But because he had the record deal already, after the break Petty went back into the studio and started his pitch. By the end of the evening, Lynch and the rest walked out as Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers. After being with the Heartbreakers, Lynch calmed down. \\"Tom told me, 'Look man, you can call anybody anything you want...but you can't lay a hand on anyone in this band.' \\" Even though he was still in the band in 1989, Lynch did not perform on any songs on Petty's solo album Full Moon Fever, even though Campbell, Tench and Epstein did. For his part, Lynch felt that he had just begun to play well on the band's fourth and fifth albums, Hard Promises and Long After Dark. \\"[I'd] gotten looser, more pliable over the years,\\" he commented. \\"When I listen to our first couple of albums, I think that I sound stiff.\\" As Lynch's ability increased, so did the offers to play with other artists, creating experience that covers a wide variety of musical territory. Lynch contributed to albums by the following artists: *The Amazing Delores *The Blasters *Jackson Browne *T-Bone Burnett *The Byrds *Belinda Carlisle *Bob Dylan *The Eagles *Elliot Easton *Eurythmics *Aretha Franklin *Don Henley *Jackopierce *Freedy Johnston *Jim Lauderdale *Eric Martin *The Mavericks *John Mellencamp *Roger McGuinn *Kevin Montgomery *Scotty Moore *Stevie Nicks *The Nudes *Rank and File *Timothy B. Schmit *Del Shannon *Todd Sharp *Henry Lee Summer *Toto *Warren Zevon  Departure from the Heartbreakers  Lynch left the group in 1994. His last gig with the Heartbreakers was on October 2, 1994, at the Bridge School Benefit Concert in Mountain View, California. It was immediately following this gig that Lynch left the band due to musical and personal differences with Petty. After his departure, Lynch moved back to Florida, where he partnered with longtime friend Don Henley to help put together the Eagles' reunion album Hell Freezes Over. He also has toured with the Eagles. Lynch gave away his drum sets and now works as a producer and songwriter in St. Augustine, Florida. He teaches children the drums a few times a week at a high school friend's music store in Gainesville. Acts Lynch has produced include The Band, the Eagles, Don Henley, Jackopierce, Joe 90, Scotty Moore, and Sister Hazel. As a songwriter, he has co-written with or written for numerous acts, including Matraca Berg, Meredith Brooks, The Fabulous Thunderbirds, The Jeff Healey Band, James House, June Pointer, Eddie Money, Toto, Tora Tora, Sister Hazel, Ringo Starr and the Mavericks. Tim McGraw recorded \\"Back When\\", a song Lynch wrote with Stephony Smith and Jeff Stevens, for his album Live Like You Were Dying. The song went to No. 1 in early December 2004. Lynch reunited with his former bandmates in 2002 when they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, playing \\"American Girl\\" and \\"Mary Jane's Last Dance\\". Tom Petty had the following to say about Lynch, included in his 2005 book, Conversations with Tom Petty:  Personal life  Lynch was involved in a five-year relationship with actress Louise \\"Wish\\" Foley whom he met while he and the rest of the band were on set shooting a production for the Tom Petty song \\"Don't Come Around Here No More\\". Foley played the main blond haired Alice in Wonderland character in the video. She was also in the video 'Make It Better (Forget About Me)'  References  External links * Berkery, Patrick.

Early life and family  Sturt was the son of Humphrey Sturt (1687-1740) of Horton and Diana Napier (died 1740), daughter of Sir Nathaniel Napier, 3rd Baronet of Critchell More. He matriculated at Queen's College, Oxford on 27 April 1741, aged 16. He married Mary Pitfield, daughter of Charles Pitfield and Dorothy Ashley, on 27 April 1756 at St James, Westminster, London. He owed his wealth to his grandfather, Sir Anthony Sturt, who had been a successful business man and City of London alderman and Victualler to the Navy. Diana Napier, his mother, was the great great granddaughter of Sir Nathaniel Napier the builder of Crichell House, and it was through her that the house passed to the Sturts.Neale, John Preston & Thomas Moule (1823), Views of the Seats of Noblemen and Gentlemen in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland Political career Sturt was the Lord of Horton Manor. He was returned unopposed as the Member of Parliament for Dorset at the 1754 general election and was classed as a Tory. He was returned again unopposed at the general elections of 1761, 1768, 1774 and 1780. He did not stand in 1784. Estate and works He was responsible for remodelling Crichel House at the nearby village of Moor Crichel. He wanted more than that just one house with a setting of comparable splendour. At Horton he had already created a lake, and he resolved to indulge this whim again at Moor Crichel, albeit on a smaller scale. There was only one difficulty: the cottages of the village were in the way. The site of the former village of Moor Crichel now lies submerged beneath the waters of the lake. The entire village was moved to what is now called New Town at Witchampton, leaving only the church (rebuilt in 1850) and a carefully contrived landscape in front of the classical mansion. The site of the old village disappeared under the waters of a large crescent- shaped lake, around which was planted an elegantly landscaped park. The residents were moved to houses in nearby Witchampton.The Ancient Feudal Manor and Lordship of Winterborne St. Martin (Dorsetshire)- The family of Sturt - http://www.martinstown.co.uk/WEBSITE/sturt.htm Humphrey Sturt had many ideas for the improvement of agriculture, which he introduced both in the Crichels and on Brownsea Island in Poole Harbour. He used steam power for threshing and transformed Brownsea Island by importing vast quantities of manure and planting new crops. The estates passed to Humphrey Sturt's younger son, Charles Sturt.  Horton Tower  Horton Tower, the architectural folly designed by Sturt Sturt designed the Horton Tower in Horton, Dorset, built 1750. Horton Tower, also known as Sturt's Folly, is an architectural folly with six stories, 140 feet (43 m) high. It had a fireplace halfway up. Taylor's 1765 map of Dorset describes it as an 'Observatory', but according to one local legend it was built by Sturt as a viewing platform from which he could watch the local hunt when he was too old to ride to hounds. Sturt died on 20 October 1786.

The river, originally known as Mya, derives its name from the Ingrian word for \\"slush\\" or \\"mire\\". It is long and wide. The river flows from the Fontanka near the Summer Garden past the Field of Mars, crosses Nevsky Prospect and the Kryukov Canal before entering the Neva river delta. It is also connected with the Neva by the Swan Canal and the Winter Canal. In 1711 Peter the Great ordered the consolidation of the banks of the river. After the Kryukov Canal linked it with the Fontanka River four years later, the Moyka became so much clearer that its name was changed from Mya to Moyka, associated with the Russian verb \\"to wash\\". In 1736 the first Moyka quay was constructed in wood. Four bridges originally spanned the river: the Blue, the Green, the Yellow, and the Red. The -wide Blue Bridge, now hardly visible underneath Saint Isaac's Square, remains the widest bridge in the whole city. Magnificent 18th- century edifices lining the Moyka quay include the Stroganov Palace, Razumovsky Palace, Yusupov Palace, New Holland Arch, Circular Market, St. Michael's Castle, and the last accommodation and museum of Alexander Pushkin. In 1798 work started to construct a stately embankment faced with red granite and adorned with ornate railings. After the completion of construction works in 1811, it was discovered that the water of the river became so muddy that its use for cooking has been officially forbidden ever since. 15 bridges cross the Moyka.

An expert marksman, Dickinson died from injuries sustained in a duel with Andrew Jackson, who later became President of the United States. Dickinson was born at Wiltshire Manor in Caroline County, Maryland, the son of Elizabeth Walker and Henry Dickinson, the grandson of Sophia Richardson and Charles Dickinson (1695‚Äì1795), and the great-grandson of Rebecca Wynne (daughter of Dr. Thomas Wynne) and John Dickinson. He studied law under U.S. Chief Justice John Marshall, who wrote formal letters of introduction and recommendation for his student. Dickinson owned a house in Maryland for 3 years before moving to Tennessee, where he became a successful horse breeder and plantation owner. Within two years of his arrival in Tennessee, he courted and married the daughter of Captain Joseph Erwin. Unfortunately for Dickinson, he also ran afoul of fellow plantation owner and horse breeder, Andrew Jackson. Horse race dispute In 1805, a friend of Jackson's deprecated the manner in which Captain Joseph Erwin had handled a bet with Jackson over a horse race. Erwin's horse, Ploughboy, was scheduled to race Jackson's horse, Truxton; however, Erwin's horse had to drop out of the race. According to the pre-race agreement, if a horse was unable to race, a forfeit fee of $800 would be paid to the injured party, in this case Jackson. However, Jackson and Erwin disagreed on how this was to be paid, and a nasty quarrel ensued. Erwin's son- in-law, Charles Dickinson, became enraged and started quarreling with Jackson's friend, which led to Jackson becoming involved. Dickinson wrote to Jackson calling him a 'coward and an equivocator.' The affair continued, with more insults and misunderstandings, until Dickinson published a statement in the Nashville Review in May 1806, calling Jackson a 'worthless scoundrel, ... a poltroon and a coward.' The political atmosphere in Nashville was heated by ambition. John Coffee, a friend of Jackson's, had fought a duel earlier in the year with one of Dickinson's associates, and there were larger political and sporting interests involved. The Jackson‚ÄìDickinson duel, like that between Aaron Burr‚Äîa political friend of Jackson's at the time‚Äîand Alexander Hamilton, had been developing over some time. Although the actual issue that led to the duel was a horse race between Andrew Jackson and Dickinson's father-in-law, Joseph Erwin, Jackson had confronted Dickinson over a report that he had insulted his wife, Rachel Jackson. Dickinson said if he had, he was drunk at the time and apologized. Jackson accepted his apology, but there were probably still hard feelings between the two. Jackson and Erwin had scheduled their horse race in 1805. The stakes specified a winning pot of $2,000 paid by the loser, with an $800 forfeit if a horse could not run. Erwin's horse went lame, and after a minor disagreement about the type of forfeit payment, Erwin paid.Remini, Robert V., Andrew Jackson, Volume One: The Course of American Empire, 1767‚Äì1821. (Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc., 1977, 1998) Later, one of Jackson's friends, while sitting in a Nashville store, shared what was probably a more lurid story about Erwin's disputed payment. When Dickinson heard the story, he sent a friend, Thomas Swann, to act as a go-between to inquire about what Jackson said about his father-in-law. Whether the friend misinterpreted or even misrepresented what was said by the two men, this minor misunderstanding flamed into full controversy. In a confrontation at Winn's Tavern, Jackson struck Swann with his cane and called him a stupid meddler. Dickinson sent Jackson a letter calling him a coward about the same time that Swann wrote a column in a local newspaper calling Jackson a coward. Jackson responded in the same newspaper saying Swann was a \\"lying valet for a worthless, drunken, blackguard\\" meaning Dickinson. That did it for Dickinson, who, after he returned from New Orleans in May 1806, published an attack on Jackson in the local newspaper, calling Jackson \\"a poltroon and a coward.\\" After reading the article, Jackson sent Dickinson a letter requesting \\"satisfaction due me for the insults offered.\\" Death Dueling was illegal in Tennessee. However, under the criminal law of the period around 1800, it was difficult to be extradited across state lines. As a result, the two men met near Adairville, Kentucky, adjacent to the Tennessee border, on May 30, 1806. Dickinson left Nashville the day before the duel with his second and a group of friends, confident, even demonstrating his shooting skills at various stops along the way. Since Dickinson was considered an expert shot, Jackson and his friend, Thomas Overton, determined it would be best to let Dickinson fire first, hoping that his aim might be spoiled in his quickness. The obvious weakness of this tactic was, of course, that Jackson might not be alive to take aim. Jackson and Overton also devised a strategy that, if Overton should win the coin toss to give the word to fire, he would ask Dickinson the question \\"Gentleman, are you ready?\\" purposefully after Jackson, and then immediately say fire in an attempt to cause Dickinson to fire impulsively. Overton did indeed win the coin toss, and subsequently used this strategy. Dickinson fired first, hitting Jackson in the chest; incredibly, Jackson was not killed, but merely wounded, and was capable of returning fire. Under the rules of dueling, Dickinson had to remain still as Jackson took his shot. Jackson's pistol stopped at half cock, so he drew back the hammer and aimed again, this time hitting Dickinson in the chest. Dickinson bled to death. The expert Dickinson had aimed at Jackson's heart, though the bullet had been slightly deflected by Jackson's brass button on his coat, which some claim was due to him deliberately wearing loose clothing over his lean frame. It has also been suggested that Jackson adopted a careful sideways stance to ensure that his heart was obstructed. The bullet broke some of Jackson's ribs, and had ended up lodged inches from his heart. While Jackson could easily have been incapacitated by such a wound, an unconfirmed account later claimed that while conversing with a friend on his deathbed he stated, \\"If he had shot me through the brain, sir, I should still have killed him.\\" Doctors determined that the bullet lodged in Jackson's chest was too close to his heart to operate, so Jackson carried it for the rest of his life, and suffered much pain from the wound. Locals were outraged that Dickinson had to stand defenseless while Jackson re-cocked and shot him. This was a confusing application of the rules of dueling, as snaps were considered as good as a shot. A snap implies that the hammer fell completely and failed to cause a shot, but a half cock is not a snap. Dickinson's second nervously permitted Jackson to re-cock his pistol. Some might claim that Jackson could have shot into the air or shot only to injure Dickinson; this would have been considered sufficient satisfaction under dueling rules. Jackson replied that Dickinson had meant to \\"kill the gent,\\" so Jackson had also shot to kill. Jackson's reputation suffered greatly from the duel. Dickinson was originally buried on a family plantation (now on the outskirts of Nashville), but was reinterred in the Old City Cemetery in Nashville after his grave was rediscovered in 2010. By that time, the original grave site had become unmarked and claims had been made that his remains were buried elsewhere.

Srontgorrth is a loose concept album, with the first four tracks focusing on the four seasons. The riff introduced at the beginning of the first piece is reprised at some point in every track on the album. The first three tracks had previously appeared on the band's first two demos and first album, respectively, but were re-recorded for this release. The fourth track is performed featuring no guitars whatsoever. Most likely because more than half of the songs are re-recordings of previously released material, the band themselves do not consider Srontgorrth as an album, referring instead to their next album, Virus West, as their second album. Sound In a 2009 interview, drummer Alexander von Meilenwald wrote that the first Srontgorrth chapter was influenced by Enslaved's \\"Slaget i skogen bortenfor\\";Wolf-R√ºdiger M√ºhlmann: Die K√∂nige vom Westwall.

The bank was headquartered in Elkin, North Carolina. On July 4, 2014, Yadkin Financial and VantageSouth Bancshares Inc. completed a merger which resulted in the largest community bank based in North Carolina, and the fourth-largest bank headquartered in the state, with $4 billion in assets and $3.2 billion in deposits. The company was headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina with banking operations based in Statesville, North Carolina. History of Yadkin Bank The original bank was opened in 1968. However, in three years Yadkin Valley Bank grew significantly by the acquisition of two other regional banks (Main Street Bankshares, Inc. in June 2002, operating as \\"Piedmont Bank\\", and High Country Financial Corporation in January 2004, operating as \\"High Country Bank\\") and a mortgage broker (Sidus Financial LLC in October 2004), as well as opening new branch locations. Piedmont Bank and High Country Bank were reorganized as divisions of Yadkin Valley Bank but maintained their names and logos. Sidus remained as a wholly owned subsidiary. Yadkin Valley Bank and its divisions operated 23 full- service branch locations. As of December 31, 2005, the company achieved a milestone in the bank's history by reaching the US$1 billion mark in total assets for the first time. On July 1, 2006, the company reorganized into a holding company, becoming Yadkin Valley Financial Corporation.\\"Yadkin Valley Bank Reorganizes Into Holding Company and Announces Stock Repurchase,\\" press release dated July 5, 2006 Yadkin Valley Bank announced in June 2007 that it was buying Cardinal State Bank of Durham, North Carolina. The purchase is the bank's first entry into the Triangle market. The completion of the deal gave Yadkin Valley 28 branches in 11 North Carolina counties.\\"Yadkin Valley to Acquire Cardinal State,\\" Associated Press, June 15, 2007 Yadkin Valley Bank acquired American Community Bank of Monroe, North Carolina in 2009. As of May 28, 2013, all of the banks Yadkin Valley had acquired would have one name, Yadkin Bank. The holding company also changed names to Yadkin Financial Corporation. With $1.9 billion in assets and 36 branches, Yadkin Valley Bank would become Yadkin Bank and its NASDAQ symbol would change from YAVY to YDKN. History of VantageSouth In 2005, VantageSouth began in Burlington, North Carolina. In 2009, J. Adam Abram and Steven Lerner started Piedmont Community Bank Holdings. In 2010, Piedmont bought a majority stake in VantageSouth. On October 5, 2011, it was announced that Piedmont would buy VantageSouth, which had two branches in Burlington, $91 million in assets and $73 million in deposits, and that the company would take the name VantageSouth. Piedmont had a controlling interest in VantageSouth and in Salisbury, North Carolina-based Community Bank of Rowan, which would also merge with the company. On October 24, 2011, Piedmont announced it would acquire a controlling interest in Cary, North Carolina-based Crescent Financial Bancshares, parent of Crescent State Bank. Abram would become Crescent chairman, and Piedmont president and former RBC Bank CEO Scott Custer would be Crescent CEO. In August 2012, Crescent announced a merger with VantageSouth, which had five branches and $260.7 million in assets as of September 30 and was called by Custer \\"one of the most profitable banks in North Carolina.\\" On December 3, the fifteen Crescent branches took the VantageSouth name. Custer became CEO and VantageSouth CEO Steve Jones became president. On September 25, 2012, Crescent and Engelhard, North Carolina-based East Carolina Bank, with 25 branches, announced their merger. Once the East Carolina deal was completed, VantageSouth had 45 branches in central and eastern North Carolina and $2 billion in assets. It was announced in January 2014 that five of those will close. History of Yadkin Financial On January 27, 2014, Yadkin Financial and VantageSouth announced a \\"merger of equals\\". The new company was called Yadkin Financial Corp. and was based in Raleigh. Banking operations were based in Statesville, North Carolina. VantageSouth president and CEO Scott Custer will become Yadkin Financial CEO, and Yadkin Financial's Joe Towell becomes executive chairman. VantageSouth chairman Adam Abram will remain on the board. Yadkin will have $4 billion in assets, $3.2 billion in deposits, The completion of the merger happened July 4 and the VantageSouth disappeared. Signs were to be changed by September. On March 1, 2016, Yadkin Financial and NewBridge Bancorp completed a $456 million deal, which gave Yadkin $7.3 billion in assets and 110 branches. Yadkin had few branches in the Piedmont Triad, where NewBridge had most of its locations. Even before changing the signs on NewBridge branches, Yadkin agreed to a $1.4 billion deal with FNB Corporation of Pittsburgh. With the completion of the FNB deal, conversion of Yadkin Bank branches to First National Bank took place March 11, 2017.

The first such camp was Camp Sizanani of Magaliesburg, South Africa, which was founded in 2003 and operates several camp sessions per year. The children at Sizanani come from the townships of Johannesburg, the nation's largest city. Additional camps outside Cape Town and Durban have been held. The long-term goal of Global Camps Africa is to expand to other nations, both in Africa and elsewhere. Founder Global Camps Africa Inc.(formerly WorldCamps), was founded by Philip H. Lilienthal, an American lawyer and camp director. Lilienthal owned and operated Camp Winnebago in Fayette, Maine for 30 years before founding Global Camps Africa. Although Lilienthal had Peace Corps experience in Ethiopia, his first foray with Global Camps Africa led him to South Africa. There, he teamed with HIVSA, a local HIV/AIDS foundation, to establish Camp Sizanani in the Gauteng province, home to South Africa's capital, Pretoria and its largest city, Johannesburg. When establishing a new Global Camps Africa location, Lilienthal temporarily assumes the role of camp director for the new camp's fledgling sessions. He then passes the daily operations on to local leadership for the long term. In 2013, Lilienthal received the U.S. Peace Corps' 2013 Sargent Shriver Award for Humanitarian Service.

His short fiction and non-fiction pieces have appeared in Atlantic Monthly, Esquire, The New Yorker, and a variety of literary magazines. A Shortcut in Time \\"Readers of all persuasions will welcome the quiet metaphysics of A Shortcut in Time.

There's one problem: Only Helene can drive, and she's blind. Beer-swigging Ina acts as her eyes. On back roads in the dead of night they travel across an America they never knew.

The uprising, named after the village of Rakovica in south-central Croatia where it started, lasted only four days in October 1871, and ended in defeat for Croatian rebels. Revolt =Preparations= Eugen Kvaternik had planned to launch a rebellion years earlier against what was then the Austrian Empire since 1859. However, he failed to secure allies in either Italy or Hungary to participate in the cause. Kvaternik planned a revolt without notifying anybody from Party of Rights, including its leader Ante Starƒçeviƒá.Horvat, (1989) p. 199 Kvaternik's idea was creation of an independent Croatian state, union of Croatian Military Frontier with provincial Croatia and their secession from Austria-Hungary. Kvaternik planned a revolt months before, already issuing a seal of a new Croatian state. The population of the Croatian Military Frontier did not support an unification with the Kingdom of Croatia following the Croatian-Hungarian Agreement, as Croatia was under Hungarian influence, while the Frontiers supported the ruling dynasty (Austria). This made conditions for the revolt much harder than Kvaternik expected. Another bad condition for the revolution was its location; the village of Rakovica and the area of Kordun was mostly populated by Orthodox Serbs of Croatia. However, a large number of the local Orthodox population supported Kvaternik. =Conflict= Kvaternik gathered rebels in Broƒáanac village on October 7, 1871, and on the same day Kvaternik declared the Croatian People's Government and the rebels declared him president. Soon he gained supporters from the villages of Rakovica, Broƒáanac, Brezovac, Ma≈°vina, Plavƒça Draga and Gornja Moƒçila. Kvaternik's government also made a declaration where he represented equality before the law, municipal self- governing, the abolition of military administration in the Croatian Military Frontier and introduction of free counties. In order to get to the border with Bosnia Vilayet which was part of the Ottoman Empire at the time, the rebels concluded they needed to capture the village of Dre≈ænik. Rakija≈° advanced with 300 men into Dre≈ænik, however, the population refused to join them, so Rakija≈° returned to Rakovica. On October 9, Kvaternik led the attack on Pla≈°ki, at which time the Austro-Hungarian Army reacted and sent Ogulin Regiment to deal with rebels, which upon arriving saw the majority of Kvaternik's 1700 rebels escaping. On October 10, Kvaternik's rebellion was crushed, and he was executed on October 11, along with Bach, Rakija≈° and one of the ƒåuiƒá brothers (the other one took refuge in Serbia). Aftermath The revolt ultimately failed. Immediately after rebellion, on 10 October, the Austrian government began the arrests. On November 11, the court sentenced seven participants to hanging, including Petar Ugarkoviƒá, Petar ƒåuiƒá, Marko Milo≈°eviƒá, Janko ƒåuiƒá, Ilija ≈†a≈°a, Jozo Stregar and Petar Tepavac. Since there were no executioners available at that exact time, the convicts were shot the same day. On October 14, Lazo ƒåuiƒá, Filip Milanoviƒá, Petar Do≈°en, Miladin ≈†a≈°a were sentenced to death; Mladin ≈†a≈°a's conviction was changed to 18 years in a dungeon. During the night of October 12/13, all citizens with the Starƒçeviƒá surname were arrested. Among others arrested was Petar Vrdoljak who was sentenced to 12 years in a dungeon, Rudolf Fabijani who was later released, Franjo Turkalj and Milovan Miljkoviƒá who were sentenced to 14 years in a dungeon, Maksim ƒÜuriƒá who was sentenced to 8 years in a dungeon, Lazo ≈†a≈°a who was sentenced 4 years in a dungeon, Mihael Bosniƒá, Petar Vojnoviƒá, Mihajlo Majnoloviƒá and Stjepan ƒêakoviƒá who were released. On October 16, Franjo Raƒçki informed Josip Juraj Strossmayer about one of Kvaternik's plans if the revolt would have been successful. In letters found with the corpses of Kvaternik and Bach, it was stated that they would eliminate Ivan Ma≈æuraniƒá (who led a friendly policy with Austria at the time), Matija Mrazoviƒá, Franjo Raƒçki, ƒêuro Crnadak and Nikola Kre≈°iƒá. Also, before the rebellion started, Austria was governed by the government of Karl Sigmund von Hohenwart. His government had planned to federalize Austria-Hungary into three major parts: Austrian, Hungarian and South Slavic (Croatian) parts. The Hungarian ruling elite was against such measures, namely Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula Andr√°ssy who advocated Croatian subordination to Hungary. Andr√°ssy represented Croats as opponents of the Franz Joseph's regime so he used Kvaternik's rebellion as an example, since Kvaternik had in mind to declare Croatia independent from Austro- Hungarian rule. This led to fall of Hohenwart's government and abandonment of federalism. Monument A statue of Kvaternik in Rakovica was unveiled in 1933. After World War II, it was removed by the communist authorities, but was later returned. The statue was removed and damaged by Serbian soldiers during the War in Croatia, and was restored in 1996.http://vojnapovijest.vecernji.hr/komunisti-kvaternika-zamijenili-palim- borcima-a-sprski-teroristi-na-njemu-vjezbali-gadanje-974909 References Literature *Horvat, Josip. \\"Graditelj Ma≈æuraniƒá [Builder Ma≈æuraniƒá]\\".

Together with major parts of the other two main districts of Tyres√∂, Trollb√§cken and Gamla Tyres√∂, Bollmora forms a conurbation with Stockholm. Bollmora derives its name from Bollmora farm (Bollmora g√•rd) which was located near current day Njupk√§rrsv√§gen‚ÄìIndustriv√§gen intersection. Up until the 1950s Bollmora was a village, but in conjunction to the large migration to Stockholm in 1950s and 1960s, Bollmora expanded. The large expansion was made possible by Lex Bollmora from 1959, a legislation that made possible for municipal real estate companies to operate in other municipalities than their own. The municipal real estate companies of Stockholm started immediately constructing in Bollmora after the legislation came into effect. Many of the apartment building areas of Bollmora are from the Million Programme origin. Bollmora centre (Bollmora centrum) was inaugurated in 1965, and it was fairly ordinary small-town centre with pedestrian streets. The centre underwent a major overhaul to an enclosed shopping mall in early 1990s. It was renamed Tyres√∂ centre (Tyres√∂ centrum) and the new centre was inaugurated in 1992.

Early life and education Dawson was born in Croydon, the son of Henry Dawson, of Purley, an architect. He entered St Paul's School in London in 1877 and University College London in 1879, graduating in 1888 with a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree. He graduated from the Royal London Hospital in 1893 with a Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree. Career After graduation he was registered as a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons (MRCS) in 1890 and invested as a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians (FRCP) in 1903, and worked as a physician for several years. In 1907, Dawson joined the Royal Household as a physician-extraordinary to King Edward VII, an office he held until 1910, when he was promoted to a physician- in-ordinary under King George V until 1914. He was appointed Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) in 1911. Following the outbreak of World War I, he was given the rank of colonel in the Royal Army Medical Corps in November 1914. He served on the Western Front in France from 1915 to 1919, rising to the rank of major-general (he had served as a Royal Army Medical Corps officer in the Territorial Force for many years), noticing the poor physical fitness of British troops and conducting research into trench fever. He was mentioned in despatches. He held the office of Physician-in-Ordinary to King George V until 1936 and was appointed Knight of Grace in the Venerable Order of Saint John and Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 1916, Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO) in the 1918 New Year Honours, and Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1919. Report on the Future Provision of Medical and Allied Services Dawson was commissioned whilst he was Chairman of the Consultative Council on Medical and Allied Services in 1919 by Christopher Addison, the first British Minister of Health to produce a report on \\"schemes requisite for the systematised provision of such forms of medical and allied services as should, in the opinion of the Council, be available for the inhabitants of a given area\\". An Interim Report on the Future Provision of Medical and Allied Services was produced in 1920, though no further report ever appeared. The report laid down details plans for a network of Primary and Secondary Health Centres, together with architectural drawings of different sorts of centres. The report was very influential in debates about the National Health Service when it was set up in 1948. Titles In the 1920 New Year Honours, he was elevated to the peerage as Baron Dawson of Penn, of Penn, in the County of Buckingham and became an active member of the House of Lords. In April 1926 he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB), and he was appointed to the Privy Council in the 1929 Birthday Honours. He held the office of President of the Royal Society of Medicine from 1928 to 1930 and President of the Royal College of Physicians from 1931 to 1937. Death of George V On the night of 20 January 1936 as King George V was dyingThe Illustrated London News, with a photograph of Dawson from bronchitis, his death was hastened by Dawson, who gave him lethal injections of cocaine and morphine. > \\"At about 11 o'clock it was evident that the last stage might endure for > many hours, unknown to the patient but little comporting with the dignity > and serenity which he so richly merited and which demanded a brief final > scene. Hours of waiting just for the mechanical end when all that is really > life has departed only exhausts the onlookers and keeps them so strained > that they cannot avail themselves of the solace of thought, communion or > prayer. I therefore decided to determine the end and injected (myself) > morphia gr. 3/4 and shortly afterwards cocaine gr. 1 into the distended > jugular vein [...]\\" Dawson said that he acted to preserve the King's dignity, to prevent further strain on the family, and so that the King's death at 11:55 p.m. could be announced in the morning edition of The Times newspaper rather than \\"less appropriate ... evening journals\\". (Subscription required) To make doubly sure that this would happen Dawson telephoned his wife in London asking her to let The Times know when the announcement was imminent.Ramsay, J. H. R. A king, a doctor, and a convenient death at British Medical Journal, May 1994,308:1445 When this appeared in The Daily Telegraph a reader wrote in recalling a clerihew in circulation during Dawson's life: Lord Dawson of Penn/ Killed many men./ That's why we sing/ 'God Save the King'. Dawson's public stance on euthanasia was expressed later that year when he opposed a move in the Lords to legalise it because it \\"belongs to the wisdom and conscience of the medical profession and not to the realm of law\\". In 1986, the contents of Dawson's diary were made public for the first time, in which he clearly acknowledged what he had done‚Äîwhich was described by a medical reviewer in 1994 as an arrogant \\"convenience killing\\". Further career In the 1936 Birthday Honours, on 30 October, he was advanced in the peerage as Viscount Dawson of Penn, in the County of Buckingham and remained in the Medical Households of King Edward VIII and King George VI. During the abdication crisis of 1936 Dawson was believed to have attempted to influence the retirement of prime minister Stanley Baldwin on health grounds, thereby to reduce pressure on the king to abdicate. Dawson was undoubtedly indebted to and supportive of Edward but the account of his close colleague William Evans appears to clear him of any unethical manipulation in the matter. > Dawson was physician and friend to both parties in the feud that was then > taking place between the King and the Prime Minister. That Dawson, although > initially inclined to the view that Baldwin should retire, eventually > pronounced on the Prime Minister's health from medical grounds exclusively, > and uninfluenced by either political or moral considerations, was confirmed > through his immediate acceptance of a young medical colleague's opinion that > the Prime Minister's heart was healthy, which made Baldwin's retirement on > the grounds of his unfitness from heart trouble no longer tenable, so that > any attempt to dethrone the Prime Minister on that assumption must > fail.Evans W Journey to Harley Street David Rendel, London (1968) Family Lord Dawson of Penn married Minnie Ethel Yarrow, daughter of Sir Alfred Fernandez Yarrow, 1st Baronet, of Homestead, on 18 December 1900. They had three daughters: * The Honourable Sybil Frances Dawson (1904 ‚Äì 2 June 1977), married on 1 October 1929 David Eccles, 1st Viscount Eccles, and had issue * The Honourable Ursula Margaret Dawson (1907 ‚Äì 16 November 1999), married on 10 December 1927 Sir Ian Frank Bowater, Lord Mayor of London, and had issue, including Charlotte Mary Bowater, mother of the actor Damian Lewis * The Honourable Rosemary Monica Dawson (1913 ‚Äì 13 June 1998), married on 30 November 1939 Sir John Wrightson, 3rd Baronet (19 June 1911 ‚Äì 1983), and had four children, including Sir Charles Mark Garmondsway Wrightson, 4th Baronet (18 Feb 1951 ‚Äì ). Dawson died in March 1945, aged 80. As he had no male heirs, on his death his titles became extinct.

Hodge (April 18, 1912 - March 19, 1979) was an American actor best known for playing space adventurer Captain Video on the DuMont Television Network from December 15, 1950, to April 1, 1955. He played the Green Hornet on radio from January 1936 until January 1943. Biography Hodge was born in Ravenna, Ohio. His parents operated a tailoring and dry-cleaning business. Hodge acted and took part in sports at Ravenna High School. Nicknamed \\"Abie\\", he was a track star, a drum major and manager of the band, sang bass in the boys glee club and was a cheerleader. Hodge graduated from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, in 1934, majoring in drama. After touring as an actor with the Casford Players, he was hired by WXYZ in Detroit, Michigan. Besides originating the role of Britt Reid, the Green Hornet, Hodge wrote and delivered daily editorials, announced at football games, wrote advertising copy, worked as a disc jockey, and produced radio dramas and documentaries, including The Lone Ranger and Challenge of the Yukon. He served in the United States Navy during World War II, and was bedridden for a year with pleurisy. =Captain Video= After his discharge from the Navy, Hodge worked in New York City in a variety of radio and early TV roles. In December 1950 he took over the role of Captain Video from Richard Coogan, who wanted to leave the series to concentrate on Broadway. Hodge played the role on live television Monday through Saturday at 7pm ET, and then Monday through Friday at 7pm for the last four seasons. When the DuMont network collapsed in 1955, Hodge continued the role of Captain Video on a children's show, Wonderama, and as the host of Captain Video's Cartoons from 1955 to 1957. Those programs were seen only in the New York City area. Hodge felt that working on Captain Video had typecast him, and by the late 1960s and early 1970s he was working in increasingly low-paying jobs, eventually having to work as a security guard. He felt he was too closely identified with the role of Captain Video to gain acting parts. As late as 1978, Hodge told reporters that he was almost always recognized on the street and greeted as \\"Captain Video\\". =After Captain Video= He also MC'd \\"Super Serial\\" (later the series was retitled:\\"Serial Theater\\") weekday evenings on WNTA TV Ch.13 during the 1959 TV season. Hodge's last regular TV stint was hosting \\"The Space Explorer's Club\\" weekday evenings on WOR TV Ch.9 in NYC in 1961. Ironically, he hosted his last TV program as himself (information about Hodge hosting \\"Super Serial\\"/\\"Serial Theater\\" and \\"The Space Explorer's Club\\" can be found in \\"The NYC Kids Shows Round Up\\" Section of www.tvparty.com). Hodge then moved to California, where he guest-starred on Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Mannix, The Mod Squad, Tightrope, Hawaiian Eye, Coronado 9 and other drama or detective series. The grave of Al Hodge in Kensico Cemetery Hodge largely dropped from sight after 1975. He lived for four years in the George Washington Hotel in New York City, his room crammed with collectible items from his career as Captain Video. He died there in 1979 at age 66. He is said to have struggled with alcoholism. Personal life Little is known of Hodge's private life. He married three times, and it is sometimes erroneously stated he fathered three children.Al Hodge mini-biography, IMDB In reality, he fathered a daughter, Diane, during his first marriage to Betty; the boy and girl he was frequently photographed with in the 1950s were John Taft Potter Jr. and Lois Trimble Potter, his step children from his second wife, Doris Ruth Trimble Hodge. Hodge and his third wife, a former showgirl, are buried in the same grave at Kensico Cemetery in Westchester County, New York. Tributes In the first filmed episode of The Honeymooners (\\"TV or Not TV?\\", October 1, 1955), Ed Norton and Ralph Kramden watch a fictionalized \\"Captain Video\\" episode on their new mutually owned television set (although \\"Captain Video\\" had ended its run six months earlier).

Kellmeyer is an alumnus of Florida Atlantic University. A junior champion in the 1950s, Kellmeyer played No. 1 on the University of Miami women's tennis team and became the first woman to compete on a Division 1 men's squad. Hired as physical education director and coach at Florida's Marymount College in 1966, Kellmeyer successfully sued to overturn an AIAW rule barring women's athletic scholarships, leading to Title IX legislation. In 1973, Kellmeyer was tapped by founder Gladys Heldman as the first tour director of the fledgling Virginia Slims Circuit. She continuously pushed to secure additional venues and increased prize money for players. In 1977, she brought the first women's tennis tournament to Madison Square Garden. She is the tour operations executive consultant for the Women's Tennis Association.

Usually the pianist receives a small salary plus tips in a jar or basket on or near the piano, especially from patrons requesting a song traditionally written on a beverage napkin.Swenson, John. \\"Pat O'Brien's: The Song Remains the Same\\", offbeat.com, August 20, 2012 Some piano bars feature a baby grand or grand piano surrounded by stools for patrons (or, somewhat humorously, an upright piano covered by a counter that makes it appear to be a grand piano). Others have a bar surrounding the piano or keyboard. Jimmy Durante started as a piano bar player, as did Billy Joel. Joel's classic hit \\"Piano Man\\" is based on his experiences as a piano bar player. Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli also played in piano bars to pay for singing lessons. Theatre historian John Kenrick describes the piano bar as follows: > A piano bar is a hybrid creature: part performance space, part living room, > part cruise-a-thon, and part saloon. The bar is there to sell drinks, the > pianist is there to perform, and the crowd is there to sing, listen, drink > and socialize.

The Manhattan Association of Cabarets & Clubs presents annually several awards, MAC Awards, for piano bar performers: Piano Bar Instrumentalist, Restaurant/Hotel Lounge Instrumentalist, Piano Bar/Restaurant Singing Entertainer ‚Äì male and female.Manhattan Association of Cabarets & Clubs Types There are several types of piano bars: *Instrumental only: the professional piano/keyboard player plays strictly instrumental music, which is usually classical, semi-classical, or easy listening; this type of piano bar is often found in hotel lobby lounges or fine dining restaurants and upscale bars. *Only the musician sings: the professional piano/keyboard player sings to his/her accompaniment, usually on microphone, but no other singers are generally allowed.Alavattam, Kris. \\"Play us a song at the piano bar\\" , Swocol.com, Cox Ohio Publishing (Dayton, Ohio), May 05, 2008 Examples include Carousel Piano Bar & Lounge. *Musician and waiters sing: the professional musician sings and also invites waiters to sing solos. *Sing-along: patrons surrounding the piano/keyboard sing as a group, usually without microphones, often preferring standards and show tunes, or very old songs like \\"Down By The Old Mill Stream\\", \\"Bicycle Built For Two\\", etc., but in some cases pop or rock. It is \\"a social venue for singing\\".Maltese, Racheline. \\"New York City Favorite: Rose's Turn\\", gather.com, December 28, 2006 Examples include Marie's Crisis Cafe and The Duplex in Greenwich Village. *Dueling pianos: usually on stage with two grand pianos, each played by a professional player who sings and entertains; humor and audience participation are prevalent. Usually these types of piano bars have substantial sound systems, and most of the songs performed are rock and roll, classic rock, Top 40, R&B; or country, sometimes played by request. The format is based on dueling piano entertainments offered at Pat O'Brien's Bar in New Orleans, Louisiana. Numerous popular clubs offer the sing-along format, while Howl at the Moon Piano Bar, Shake Rattle & Roll Dueling Pianos (in New York City) and The Big Bang Dueling Piano Bar feature full performance shows, often with singing and dancing by their wait staff.Howl at the Moon websiteBig Bang Dueling Piano BarList of duelling piano bars , Piano Bars Worldwide Guide, accessed 9 February 2010 *Open mic: individual patrons sing (on microphone) to the accompaniment of the professional musician; in some ways, this type of piano bar is like karaoke, except that the music is live and dynamic, and there are usually no lyrics available (although some piano bar players do supply some lyrics); like karaoke, the songs performed may cover a wide, eclectic range (show tunes, standards from the 1920s forward, jazz, country, R&B;, rock'n'roll, blues, folk, soul, disco, hip-hop, etc.); the patron singers are usually called to the microphone in a rotating order; often, each singer is allowed 2 or 3 songs each time he/she is called to perform. The Alley in Oakland, California, uses this format. *Combination: some piano bars include the characteristics of two or more of the above, either on different nights or combined on the same night.

Dap is a friendly gesture of greeting, agreement, or solidarity between two people that has become popular in Western cultures, particularly since the 1970s, originating from African American communities.Dalzell, Tom (2009). The Routledge Dictionary of Modern American Slang and Unconventional English. Taylor & Francis. p. 271. Giving dap typically involves handshaking (often, by hooking thumbs), pound hugging, fist pounding, or chest- or fist bumping.Green, Lisa J. (2002). African American English: A Linguistic Introduction. Cambridge University Press. p. 144. The practice and term originated among black soldiers during the Vietnam War, as part of the Black Power movement, and the term is attested from around 1969. 90% of those imprisoned in the Long Binh Jail during the war were African Americans; it was in the jail that the handshake was created under pan-African nationalist influences. Giving dap can refer to presenting many kinds of positive nonverbal communication between two people, ranging from a brief moment of simple bodily contact to a complicated routine of hand slaps, shakes, snaps, etc. known only by the two participants. Elaborate examples of dap are observed as a pregame ritual performed by many teams in the National Basketball Association. These choreographed actions are rarely televised and serve as a superstitious means of psychological preparation and team solidarity. Etymology The etymology of dap is uncertain, and there are various theories. Most simply, it may be imitative (compare tap, dap), and is sometimes explained as an acronym for dignity and pride, possibly a backronym.

It is an autonomous organization in Spain responsible for overall coordination of statistical services of the General State Administration in monitoring, control and supervision of technical procedures. Every 10 years, this organization conducts a national census. The last census took place in 2011. Through the official website one can follow all the updates of different fields of study. History =First agency and evolution= The oldest statistics agency of Spain and the predecessor of the current agency was the General Statistics Commission of the Kingdom, created on November 3, 1856 during the reign of Isabella II. The so-then Prime Minister Narv√°ez approved a decree creating this body and ordering that people with recognized ability in this matter were part of it. On May 1, 1861, the Commission changed its name to General Statistics Board and their first work was to do a population census. By a decree of September 12, 1870, Prime Minister Serrano created the Geographic Institute and in 1873 this Institute changed its name to Geographic and Statistic Institute assuming the competences of the General Statistics Board. In 1890, the titularity of the agency was transferred from the Prime Minister's Office to the Ministry of Development. Between 1921 and 1939, change its name many times. In the same way, the agency was transferred from one ministry to another, passing through the Deputy Prime Minister's Office, the Ministry of the Presidency, and the Ministry of Labour. =National Statistics Institute= The National Statistics Institute was created following the Law of December 31, 1945, published in the BOE of January 3, 1946, with a mission to develop and refine the demographic, economic and social statistics already existing, creating new statistics and coordination with the statistical offices of provincial and municipal areas. At the end of 1964 the first computer was installed at the INE. It was a first-generation IBM 1401, for which a team was formed consisting of four statistics faculty and ten technicians. In the four years following it was possible that said computer would operate at its full capacity.

Life He was the son of William Rainsborough, a captain and Vice-Admiral in the Royal Navy, and ambassador to Morocco (for his services to end white slavery he was offered a baronetcy, which he declined).The Medallic History of England Before the war, Thomas and his brother, William Rainsborowe, were both involved in an expedition to the Puritan Providence Island colony, off the coast of NicaraguaThe Surnames of Scotland, Their Origin, Meaning, and History ‚Äì by George Fraser Black, Ph.D. (1866‚Äì1948) and the Rainsborough family had previous marriage links to Massachusetts. Thomas Rainsborough was devout in his religious beliefs and was a Fifth Monarchist.H. Brailsford, The Levellers and the English Revolution (Nottingham, 1961) Military career Rainsborough served in the Parliamentary forces during both the first and second English Civil Wars. Originally a naval officer he commanded the Swallow, the Lion and other English naval vessels during the first civil war. By May 1645, he was a Colonel in the New Model Army having raised an infantry regiment. Rainsborough took an active part in the battles at Naseby and Bristol. In 1645 he captured the symbolic stronghold of Berkeley Castle for Parliament before moving to the siege of Oxford, which surrendered the following June. Later in 1646, he helped conclude the Siege of Worcester and was made the city's governor. Rainsborough's Flagship In 1648 Rainsborough was moved from the army and given, by Parliament, command of the navy, holding the rank of Vice-Admiral. His appointment was unpopular with both officers and sailors, resulting in a mutiny (and declaration for the King) of six ships on 27 May 1648.Samuel Gardiner, History of the Great Civil War, Vol IV (London, 1987) In the same year he briefly replaced the Royalist sympathiser William Batten as Captain of Deal Castle, but was dismissed when the castle also declared for the King. Despite his previous experience, Rainsborough was viewed by the navy as being too radical and having been imposed on them by the army. As a result of the mutiny the Earl of Warwick was appointed Lord High Admiral, with Rainsborough returning to the army. On his return to the army, Rainsborough led the siege and victory at Colchester. From Colchester he was tasked with taking Pontefract Castle and it was during this siege he was killed. MP for Droitwich In January 1647, Rainsborough became a member of parliament for Droitwich, Worcestershire, England. Putney Debates Rainsborough was the most senior member of the Army Council to support the Leveller proposals. During the Putney Debates his arguments for universal suffrage were called 'anarchy' by Henry Ireton, who spoke for the Army Grandees.Geoffrey Robertson, The Levellers: The Putney Debates (London, 2007) During the debates, Rainsborough said: Death and controversy In October 1648, Rainsborough was sent by his commander, Sir Thomas Fairfax, to the siege at Pontefract Castle. Whilst he was in nearby Doncaster, he was killed by four Royalists during a bungled kidnap attempt. The site is still marked today by a plaque outside of the House of Fraser. As Rainsborough was under Cromwell's disfavour and there were tensions between Rainsborough and the commander he was displacing, Henry Cholmeley, who later defected to the Royalists, many at the time wondered whether there was some Parliamentary complicity in his death, as do historians today.Thomas Rainborowe (c. 1610‚Äì1648): Civil War Seaman, Siegemaster and Radical by Whitney R.D. Jones (Boydell Press, 2005) However Royalist Propaganda may also have played a part in all the rumours. The four Royalists involved in the bungled kidnap crossed the River Don at Mexborough and hid out at Conisborough Castle before their failed attempt. His murder was the subject of a ballad, published in 1648 called \\"Colonell Rainsborowes ghost or, a true relation of the manner of his death, who was murthered in his bed-chamber at Doncaster, by three of Pontefract souldiers who pretended that they had letters from Lieutenant General Cromwell, to deliver unto him.\\" Catalogue of prints and drawings in the British Museum, v. 1, p. 398 . British Museum. Department of prints and drawings (London), 1870. Funeral 1648 His funeral was the occasion for a large Leveller-led demonstration in London, with thousands of mourners wearing the Levellers' ribbons of sea-green and bunches of rosemary for remembrance in their hats. He was buried in St John's Churchyard, Wapping. After his death, his brother, William Rainsborowe, continued in the Ranter cause. Memorials and popular culture Plaque installed in Wapping 12 May 2013 In May 2013 a plaque was unveiled by Cllr Rania Khan, John Rees (writer) and Tony Benn (former MP) in memory of Rainsborough at St John's, Wapping.

Merritt was born in Bedford in Westchester County, New York on July 3, 1793. His father, Thomas, fought as a United Empire Loyalist in the American Revolutionary War. After the revolution, the family resided in New Brunswick before returning to the U.S. In 1795, they moved to Upper Canada, settling on the Niagara Peninsula on the Twelve Mile Creek. Merritt attended school in Burlington, Ontario, studying mathematics and field surveying. Afterwards, he became a partner in a store at Shipman's Corners (now St. Catharines). Just before the War of 1812, he sold his interest in the store and returned to his family's farm on the creek. During the war, he joined the Second Lincoln Militia, stationed at Chippawa. He was a captain and leader of the volunteer dragoons throughout the war. During constant patrols along the Niagara River, an idea came to him for a canal to by-pass the Niagara Falls. He was captured during Battle of Lundy's Lane and held prisoner of war in Massachusetts until March 1815. After the war, Merritt purchased at Shipman's Corners, where he built a house and a store. He also sold goods in Niagara (now Niagara-on-the-Lake) and Queenston. In 1816, he bought a rundown sawmill on the Twelve Mile Creek, and added a grist mill and a store. His property had a salt spring, and Merritt began to manufacture salt at a time when it was still expensive. The water levels in the creek varied considerably, creating difficulties for Merritt and his mill. In 1818, when the flow was especially low, Merritt pursued the idea of bringing water to his mills from the Chippawa Creek. The idea of a canal across the Niagara Peninsula was examined before, as early as 1799, but at that time the route for shipping materials in order to bypass Niagara Falls still occurred along a portage road. However, it is Merritt, and indirectly the lack of water for his mills, that is credited with realizing the idea. On July 4, 1818, Merritt organized a meeting in St. Catharines. The outcome was a petition sent to Upper Canada Legislature to provide for construction of a canal between the Twelve Mile Creek and Chippawa Creek. Unlike Merritt's original water-canal plan, the petition included plans for allowing boats to cross the Niagara Escarpment. On January 19, 1824, an act of the Legislature formed the Welland Canal Company, with a capitalization of $150,000 and Merritt as the financial agent. As part of his fundraising duties, he travelled extensively, including the United States and Great Britain. He recruited Alfred Barrett as the chief engineer on the project. Later, Merritt served in the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada from 1832 to 1841 for Haldimand County. After the unification of Upper and Lower Canadas, he served in the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada from 1841 to 1860 for Lincoln County. He supported free trade policies and transportation projects, including the first steel suspension bridge over the Niagara River. In 1860, he was elected to the Legislative Council in the Niagara Division. In 1844, the residents of a community on the Welland Canal named Aqueduct, renamed their village Merrittsville to acknowledge the role of William Hamilton Merritt's enterprise in founding the hamlet. The road connecting Merrittsville to St. Catharines is to this day named Merrittville Highway. Merrittsville was later incorporated as the Village of Welland in 1858. Ironically, Merritt died in 1862 aboard a ship near Cornwall. He is buried at the Victoria Lawn cemetery in St. Catharines, Ont. His son, Thomas Rodman Merritt, was later a member of the Canadian House of Commons.

He has proposed a theory for the origin of the universe which allegedly resolves the distant starlight problem that exists in young Earth creationism. Education and affiliations Humphreys graduated with a B.S. from Duke University and was awarded his Ph.D in physics from Louisiana State University in 1972. He has worked for General Electric and Sandia National Laboratories in nuclear physics, where he received a patent and a science award. From 2001‚Äì2008, he was an associate professor at The Institute for Creation Research. He currently works for Creation Ministries International (USA). Humphreys is a board member of both the Creation Research Society and the Creation Science Fellowship of New Mexico.CRS Board of Directors http://www.creationsciencenm.org/3.html Planetary magnetism In an article published in the Creation Research Society Quarterly in December 1984, Humphreys proposed a creationist model for the origin of planetary magnetic fields. According to the model, the planets were initially created as spheres of water, with the polar magnetic moments of the water molecules largely aligned. Lenz's law predicts that the resulting magnetic field would decay exponentially, and Humphreys fits an exponential decay model to recent observations of the earth's magnetism to conclude that the magnetic field is 6000 years old. As part of his model, he also made predictions about the magnetic fields of Mercury, Mars, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto by using assumed values for their initial magnetic field and decay rates. In 1990 Humphreys published a follow up to his predictions as Voyager II had now measured Uranus and Neptune's magnetic fields. In an article, Humphreys claimed that his model had an easier time explaining their magnetic fields than the dynamo theory. According to Humphreys, his model's predictions were again verified when probes in 2008 and 2011 flew past Mercury and measured the magnetic field. Humphreys claimed that the observed decay of Mercury's magnetic field was in line with that predicted by his model. Cosmology Humphreys' book Starlight and Time presents his alternative to the Big Bang in an attempt to solve what young Earth creationists call the Distant Starlight Problem. Its thesis is that the Earth and universe are about six thousand years old when measured in Earth's reference frame, whereas the outer edge of an expanding and rotating 3-dimensional universe is billions of years old (as measured from its reference frame). It proposes, using the principles of relativity, to postulate that time ticked at different rates during the universe's origin.Starlight and Time, Russell Humphreys, Chapter 2, p.34, In other words, according to his theory, clocks on earth registered the six days of creation, while those at the edge of the universe counted the approximately 15 billion years needed for light from the most distant galaxies to reach earth. The model places the Milky Way galaxy relatively near the center of the cosmos. Humphreys' proposal has been criticized by other scientists and old earth creationists, such as Hugh Ross and Samuel R. Conner. RNCSE 24 (1): 31-32 Humphreys has replied to Ross' and Conner's critiques.Starlight Wars: Starlight and Time Withstands Attacks, D. Russell Humphreys In 1998, physicist Dave Thomas wrote that in Humphreys' thousands-of-years-old universe, he \\"has his astronomy backwards - the Kuiper Belt contains the remains of the 'volatile' (icy) planetesimals that were left over from the formation of the solar system - numbering in the hundreds of millions. If anything, it is the Kuiper Belt that supplies the more remote hypothesized Oort Cloud, as some icy chunks are occasionally flung far away by interactions with large planets.\\"\\"Creation Physicist\\" D. Russell Humphreys, and his Questionable \\"Evidence for a Young World\\", Coalition for Excellence in Science and Math Education Thomas also criticised Humphreys' idea that there is \\"not enough sodium in the sea\\" for a several billion year old sea, writing, \\"Humphreys finds estimates of oceanic salt accumulation and deposition that provide him the data to 'set' an upper limit of 62 million years. But modern geologists do not use erratic processes like these for clocks. It's like someone noticing that (A) it's snowing at an inch per hour, (B) the snow outside is four feet deep, and then concluding that (C) the Earth is just 48 hours, or two days, in age. Snowfall is erratic; some snow can melt; and so on. The Earth is older than two days, so there must be a flaw with the 'snow' dating method, just as there is with the 'salt' method.\\" =New Cosmology= In 2008 Humphreys published a new but lesser-known cosmological proposal. In it he seeks to challenge a foundational dogma of general relativity and postulates an additional spacetime dimension, one which grants God ample liberty to hold the earth in a ‚Äútimeless‚Äù region of suspended animation while the rest of the universe ages for billions of years, thus allowing very old and distant starlight to bathe a young Earth on creation day four. A critic pointed out that the well-known equation for gravitational redshift/blueshift countermands his model's efforts to achieve today's observed redshift from cosmic sources, to which Humphreys countered by terming the gravitational redshift equation a ‚Äúflawed equation‚Äù and became dismissive in his remarks about any potential applicability to his model. Since his new cosmology relies heavily on the observed sunward acceleration of the Pioneer spacecraft as a manifestation peculiar to features of his model, his ideas were dealt a significant blow when researchers from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California discovered that the apparent anomaly was due to the thermal recoil force acting on the spacecraft. =Helium Problems= Geologist Kevin Henke has criticised Humphreys for stating that \\"zircons from the Fenton Hill rock cores... contain too much radiogenic helium to be billions of years old.\\"Young-Earth Creationist Helium Diffusion \\"Dates\\", Kevin R.

Early life Raised in Winnetka, Illinois, on the North Shore of Chicago, Byrum attended New Trier High School, and later studied at New York University in the late 1960s. His instructors included Haig P. Manoogian and graduate student Martin Scorsese, and classmates Oliver Stone and Eric Jenkins. At NYU, he co-wrote Item 72-D, The Adventures of Spa and Fon with director Edward Summer. Career As a student, Byrum interned with Jim Henson on early appearances of The Muppets and was later hired by Henson as one of the original writers of Sesame Street. Henson took a special interest in Byrum's talent, and hired him to write freelance projects. Byrum left New York for Hollywood after Byrum's original script Inserts received positive reaction and he was tapped to write the script Harry and Walter Go to New York by producers and mentors Don Devlin, Tony Bill, and Harry Gittes. After that script was sold for a then-record-breaking amount, Byrum was hired to write the Diana Ross vehicle Mahogany. He passed on the chance to write the script for Jaws in order to work on Mahogany with one of his idols, director Tony Richardson, only to have Richardson leave the film mid-production after clashing with producer Berry Gordy of Motown fame. Berry took over directing chores and it is said that the true drama of Mahogany was the behind-the- camera relationship between Berry Gordy and Diana Ross.JOYCE HABER: Berry: The Mentor From Motown Los Angeles Times 20 Jan 1975: f7. Byrum directed his first feature film Inserts with stars Richard Dreyfuss, Jessica Harper, Veronica Cartwright, Stephen Davies, and Bob Hoskins.

It was on this film that Byrum started his long collaborative relationship and friendship with composer Jack Nitzsche. The Tangled Lives of 'Heart Beat': 'HEART BEAT' Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times 19 Jan 1980: c5. Byrum teamed with Mahogany producer Rob Cohen which resulted Scandalous and The Razor's Edge, the 1984 film directed by Byrum based on the W. Somerset Maugham novel starring Bill Murray in his first dramatic role as Larry Darrell, co-starring Catherine Hicks, Theresa Russell, Denholm Elliott, and James Keach. Byrum and Murray co- wrote the screenplay. The film faltered with critics and audiences, as most were not ready to accept Murray in a non-comedic role. In later years the film achieved cult status and many fans have traveled to its international locations, to replicate Larry's spiritual journey. Following the box office failure of The Razor's Edge, a financially strapped Byrum directed the goofy comedy The Whoopee Boys starring Michael O'Keefe and Paul Rodriguez. He was the original director of the TV movie Desperado (1987) but left the project during filming.PRODUCTION LINES The Globe and Mail; Toronto, Ont.

Byrum was scheduled to direct his original script of karaoke road trip dramedy Duets when he was felled by a serious case of Lyme disease that had gone long undiagnosed. Byrum's friend Bruce Paltrow wanted to direct Duets with his daughter Gwyneth Paltrow as one of the six ensemble characters. Brad Pitt was attached to co-star with Paltrow, his fiancee at the time, but when their engagement ended, the film's financing faltered once again. Duets was filmed several years later with Scott Speedman in the role originally chosen by Pitt, along with Paul Giamatti, Maria Bello, Andre Braugher, and Huey Lewis. John Byrum resides in Santa Monica, California and Redding, Connecticut with his wife Karin Reznack.

Notable for its high toroidal magnetic field (of up to 8 Tesla), Alcator C-Mod holds the world record for volume averaged plasma pressure in a magnetically confined fusion device. Until its shutdown in 2016, it was one of the major fusion research facilities in the United States. Alcator C-Mod was the third of the Alcator (Alto Campo Toro, High Field Torus) tokamak series, following Alcator A (1973‚Äì1979) and Alcator B (1978‚Äì1987). It was the largest fusion reactor operated by any university and was an integral part of the larger Plasma Science and Fusion Center.  History  = Alcator A = In the late 1960s, magnetic-confinement fusion research at MIT was carried out on small-scale \\"table-top\\" experiments at the Research Laboratory for Electronics and the Francis Bitter Magnet Laboratory. At this time, the Soviet Union was developing a tokamak (though this was unknown in the United States), and Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) was developing the stellarator. Bruno Coppi was working at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University and was interested in the basic plasma physics problem of plasma resistivity at high values of the streaming parameter, as well as the behavior of magnetically confined plasmas at very high field strengths (‚â• 10 T). In 1968, Coppi attended the third IAEA International Conference on Plasma Physics and Controlled Nuclear Fusion Research at Novosibirsk. At this conference, Soviet scientists announced that they had achieved electron temperatures of over 1000 eV in a tokamak device (T-3). This same year, Coppi was named a full professor in the MIT Department of Physics. He immediately collaborated with engineers at the Francis Bitter Magnet Laboratory, led by Bruce Montgomery, to design a compact (0.54 m major radius), high-field (10 T on axis) tokamak which he titled Alcator. The name is an acronym of the Italian Alto Campo Toro, which means \\"high-field torus\\". With the later construction of Alcator C and then Alcator C-Mod, the original Alcator was retroactively renamed to Alcator A. Alcator was approved by the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) in 1970 and was first operated in 1972. Performance problems (poor-quality vacuum and arcing in toroidal field magnets) led to the rebuilding of the machine in 1973‚Äì1974 with a new vacuum vessel, with scientific results beginning in 1974. Alcator A was powered by the Bitter Laboratory's 32 MW DC motor-generators and was the first tokamak in the world to use an air-core transformer for ohmic current drive and heating. = Alcator B and C = The success of Alcator A led to the conceptual design, beginning in 1975, of a larger machine called Alcator B. However, the motor-generators used for Alcator A were not powerful enough to drive the new machine, necessitating the purchase and installation of new power supplies, a cost that the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) was unwilling to fund. ERDA was, however, enthusiastic about building another Alcator, and a solution was found: a 225 MVA alternator was donated to MIT by Con Ed from a plant on the East River in New York City. The conceptual design was changed to accommodate the different power supply, and the project was renamed to Alcator C. Alcator C was officially authorized in 1976. This same year, the Plasma Fusion Center (now the Plasma Science and Fusion Center) was spun off from the Francis Bitter Magnet Laboratory. Construction of Alcator C proceeded rapidly and initial tests were conducted at the end of 1977. The alternator arrived from Con Ed in early 1978 (its transport was complicated by the blizzard of 1978) and was incorporated into the system in the summer of 1978. Scientific operations began in September of that year. Alcator C was a larger machine (R0 = 0.64 m) and operated at a higher field (B0 ‚â§ 13 T) than Alcator A. With the addition of 4 MW of lower hybrid heating in 1982, electron temperatures over 3.0 keV were reached. While Alcator C did not originally have the energy confinement time expected, due to the onset of ion temperature gradient turbulence at high values of eta = text{d} ln T / text{d} ln n, pellet fueling was used to produce peaked density profiles and values of the nœÑ product of over 0.8 √ó 1020 s¬∑m‚àí3 were achieved in 1983. = Unfunded ideas and the C-Mod proposal = Several ideas for new devices and upgrades at the PSFC were never funded. From 1978 to 1980, a design activity was carried out for Alcator D, a larger version of Alcator C that would allow for more heating power, and possibly even deuterium‚Äìtritium (D‚ÄìT) operation. This design was never formally proposed to the Department of Energy (DOE), but continued to evolve under Coppi's direction, eventually becoming the Italian‚ÄìRussian IGNITOR device planned for construction at TRINITY near Troitsk, Russia. In 1982, another more ambitious device called Alcator DCT was conceived. This machine would have superconducting coils producing 7 T on axis. 4 MW of lower hybrid current drive would drive a steady-state plasma with 1.4 MA plasma current. As this design was similar to the French Tore Supra, a joint French‚ÄìAmerican workshop was held in Cadarache in 1983 to compare the two designs and exchange ideas. Alcator DCT was formally proposed to the DOE in late 1983 but was not funded. At that time, the budget for magnetic fusion energy research in the United States had been increasing year-over-year, reaching a peak of $468.4 million in fiscal 1984. That year, the PSFC was notified that for a time, budgets would be falling, and DOE policy would be to only fund upgrades to existing devices, not new machines. Thus, design work was begun on a copper-coil machine which would reuse some of the power supplies from Alcator C, allowing the team to pitch it as a \\"modification\\" to Alcator C. The conceptual design was completed and Alcator C-Mod was formally proposed to DOE in late 1985. The project was approved and construction was authorized in 1986.  Characteristics  Interior view of the tokamak showing the molybdenum armor tiles on the wall. Three Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequencies (ICRF) heating antennas are visible ‚Äì two on the left with two copper straps each, and the four-strap ‚Äúfield- aligned‚Äù antenna (installed 2011) at right. = Heating and current drive = Alcator C-Mod uses ion cyclotron range frequencies (ICRF) heating as its primary auxiliary heating source. The source frequency is 80 MHz and the standard minority heating scenarios are D(H) for 4.4‚Äì6.9 T and D(3He) for high field operation (7.3‚Äì8.0 T). A minority species (Hydrogen or He3) is indicated, and ICRH scenarios use a two-component plasma. Absorption efficiency varies with the minority concentration. It is also possible to transition between minority and mode conversion (MC) heating by varying the minority species concentration. The relative H fraction eta_H = n_H/(n_H+n_D) can be scanned from roughly 2‚Äì30% via gas puffing and measured using passive charge exchange. The relative He3 fraction eta_{He3} = n_{He3}/n_e concentration can also be scanned from roughly 2‚Äì30% via gas puffing. Phase contrast imaging (PCI) can be used to measure the mode converted waves directly in the plasma.  Minority heating  Minority heating is the most common scenario used at C-Mod. The ICRF heating system operates at 80 MHz in D(H) plasmas. This frequency corresponds to on-axis minority fundamental cyclotron resonance of protons at 5.3 T and absorbing fast waves by hydrogen minority species in a deuterium plasma. It can be very efficient (typical single pass absorption in C-Mod is 80‚Äì90% for minority concentrations of 5‚Äì10%). Minority heating at 80 MHz and 7.9 T in a deuterium majority plasma is achieved using the He3 minority resonance (on-axis), but single pass absorption with He3 minority ions in deuterium tends to be much lower than for protons (e.g. the minority heating scenario at 5.3‚Äì5.4 T).  Mode conversion heating  Mode conversion of a fast magnetosonic wave to an ion cyclotron wave and ion Bernstein wave in the ion cyclotron range of frequencies (ICRF) can be used to heat electrons. Mode conversion heating is done at C-Mod using the ICRF in D(3He) plasmas.  Lower hybrid current drive  Lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) (based on Lower hybrid oscillation) is used to supplement the current driven by the Ohmic transformer. The LHCD system is capable of delivering 1.0+ MW of microwave power (planned upgrade to 2 MW or more with addition of a second antenna in 2013) to the plasma at 4.6 GHz. Power is provided by 250 kW klystron microwave amplifiers manufactured by CPI, Inc. Non-inductive operation for up to 0.5 s pulses at 500 kA was achieved. Lower hybrid waves are launched preferentially in the direction opposite the plasma current (i.e. in the direction of electron travel) and deposit energy on electrons moving at approximately three times the thermal velocity via Landau damping. A major area of LHCD research has been in the area of current drive at the high densities (ne > 1020 m‚àí3) required for a fusion power plant.  2013‚Äì2016: Final operations and shutdown  Alcator C-Mod was slated to shut down in October 2013. However, the 2014 Congressional omnibus spending bill explicitly specified operation of the experiment, providing $22 million. The experimental operation was restarted in February 2014. Funding was once again extended for FY 2015, although the omnibus bill that provided the funding explicitly stated that no funding would be provided beyond FY 2016. In 2016 Alcator C-Mod set a world record for plasma pressure in a magnetically confined fusion device, reaching 2.05 atmospheres ‚Äì a 15 percent jump over the previous record of 1.77 atmospheres (also held by Alcator C-Mod). This record plasma had a temperature of 35 million degrees C, lasted for 2 seconds, and yielded 600 trillion fusion reactions. The run involved operation with a toroidal magnetic field of 5.7 tesla. It reached this milestone on its final day of operation. Following completion of operations at the end of September 2016, the facility has been placed into safe shutdown, with no additional experiments planned at this time. There is a wealth of data archived from the more than 20 years of operations, and the experimental and theoretical teams continue to analyze the results and publish them in the scientific literature.http://www.psfc.mit.edu/research/topics/alcator-c-mod-tokamak The Alcator C-Mod plasma pressure record of 2.05 atmosphere will likely hold for some time. The only machine currently under construction that is predicted to break this record is the ITER tokamak in France. ITER is not expected to be fully operational until 2032, meaning that Alcator C-Mod's record will hold for 15 years unless another new device is constructed before then.

The aim of the encyclical was to advance the revival of Scholastic philosophy. Introduction In August 1879, eighteen months into his pontificate, Pope Leo XIII (formerly Joachim Cardinal Pecci, bishop of Perugia), issued the encyclical letter Aeterni Patris. The aim of the encyclical was to aid and advance the restoration of Christian philosophy, which he felt had fallen into danger and disrepute by adhering to modern trends in secular philosophy, by urging a return to the scholastic thinkers of the Middle Ages, most especially the Angelic Doctor St. Thomas Aquinas, and the related philosophical system of Thomism.Gilley, Sheridan. \\"The Papacy\\", The Cambridge History of Christianity, Vol. 8 , Cambridge University Press, 2006, p.20 The encyclical attempts to clarify the roles of faith and philosophy, later to be covered again in John Paul II's encyclical, Fides et Ratio (On Faith and Reason), showing how most beneficially each may profit from the other. The purpose of Leo XIII was the revival of St. Thomas's philosophy and the continuing of his spirit of investigation, but not necessarily the adoption of every argument and opinion to be found in the works of the scholastics.O'Riordan, Michael. \\"√Üterni Patris.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 18 November 2015 According to the encyclical, the philosophy most conformable and useful for the faith is that of St. Thomas. The vigorous reintroduction of St. Thomas into the Catholic philosophical teaching was perceived by many as a bold and unprecedented step by the new pope. Indeed, since the French Revolution, most pontiffs had preferred to condemn the errors in contemporary philosophy, not to recommend explicitly a return to the old. The encyclical, however, was no surprise to any acquainted with Cardinal Pecci, who had for years been spearheading a Thomistic renaissance in the schools in his diocese of Perugia, leading to such theologians and philosophers as Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange, Etienne Gilson, and Jacques Maritain. The content of the encyclical was strongly influenced by Tommaso Maria Zigliara professor from 1870 to 1879 at the College of Saint Thomas, the future Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum. \\"Zigliara also helped prepare the great encyclicals Aeterni Patris and Rerum novarum and strongly opposed traditionalism and ontologism in favor of the moderate realism of Aquinas.\\"Benedict Ashley, The Dominicans, 9 \\"The Age of Compromise,\\" Accessed 19, 2013 Zigliara, a member of seven Roman congregations including the Congregation for Studies, was a co-founder of the Academia Romano di San Tommaso in 1870.

Romero Carrasquillo. \\"Ite ad Thomam\\", Accessed Feb. 6, 2013 Following the publication of this encyclical Pope Leo XIII created the Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas on October 15, 1879, and ordered the publication of the critical edition, the so-called \\"leonine edition\\", of the complete works of Aquinas, the doctor angelicus. The superintendence of the leonine edition was entrusted to Zigliara.  An overview of the document‚Äôs main points  Introduction 1. The opening paragraph begins with a reference to Christ‚Äôs command to His Apostles to set all men free by teaching the truth of the faith to all nations (Matthew 28:19). Although philosophy can and has deceived men about important matters, it is also capable of illuminating the other sciences. This, then, is the aim of Aeterni Patris: to promote the kind of philosophy that ‚Äúshall respond most fitly to the excellence of faith, and at the same time [is] consonant with the dignity of human science.‚Äù 2. The errors of philosophy have caused problems in public and private life. Philosophy alone is insufficient to emerge from error or prevent further erroneous conclusions ‚Äúconcerning divine or human things.‚Äù The faith of the Christian religion preserves philosophic truth by bringing to men ‚Äúthe grace of the divine wisdom.‚Äù Neither reason nor philosophy is destroyed by faith; God, creator of ‚Äúthe light of reason in the human mind,‚Äù strengthens man and his reason by faith. 3. Pointing to the Church Fathers, the encyclical shows how reason and science were used to call people to faith. The Relationship between Philosophy and Faith: How Philosophy Aids Faith 4. In the fourth paragraph, the encyclical begins to articulate the ways in which philosophy can aid and complement true faith. Reason is characterized as a ‚Äústeppingstone‚Äù to Christian faith, in that philosophy, when used rightly, fortifies the road to faith and prepares the soul for fit reception of revelation. Reason is characterized as rather autonomous, in that the pagans demonstrated and proved conclusions, using only their natural reason, which supported certain truths regarding faith: the existence of God, his power and divinity, as well as the existence of a natural law. A comparison is drawn between the way in which the Hebrews took with them Egyptian treasures to offer to the service of God, and the way in which truths discovered by the philosophy of the pagans are to be turned to the use and purposes of revealed doctrine. 5. The great and noble fruits gathered from natural reason, as described in the fifth paragraph, include its ability to recognize ‚Äúthat the doctrine of the Gospel has even from its very beginning been made manifest by certain wonderful signs.‚Äù The spread, sanctity, and unity of the Church is another sign that reason can recognize. 6. The sixth paragraph draws attention to the fact that sacred theology requires philosophy in order to be a genuine science: in order to assume the nature, form, and genius of a true science, theology requires the solid foundation of philosophy. Moreover, Philosophy complements theology in that true understanding and knowledge are better and more easily attained by those who join together philosophic studies with the love of faith and integrity of life. 7. Philosophy is characterized as both a defensive and offensive tool of faith. Defensively it protects the revealed truth from distortion; offensively it weakens arguments contrary to revealed truth. The examples of the Apostle Paul‚Äôs use of Greek philosophy in Athens (17:16‚Äì34) and David‚Äôs use of Goliath‚Äôs sword (Samuel 17:50‚Äì54) are given as literal and metaphorical examples of using philosophy in a defensive and offensive manner. The Church ‚Äúcommands‚Äù Christian teachers to enlist the help of philosophy in instructing the faithful but cautions against philosophical arguments that are contrary to revealed truth. The Relationship between Philosophy and Faith: How Faith Aids Philosophy 8. Philosophy and revelation represent two realms of knowledge. Philosophy represents the profane realm of natural truth whereas revelation represents the divine realm of supernatural truth. Revelation or supernatural truth is beyond the reach of reason and therefore philosophy must accept these truths by faith. Philosophy is characterized as a handmaid to faith that humbly accepts revelation. Revelation has the ‚Äúforce of certain truth‚Äù so that what is contrary to faith is also contrary to reason. Thus, the philosopher is discouraged from accepting any conclusion that is opposed to revealed doctrine. 9. The human mind is limited and needs the truth of revelation to avoid error. Without the supernatural truth of revelation the human mind is subject to error and opinion. The fact that revelation assists the philosopher in reasoning correctly does not detract from the dignity of the human intellect because wisdom is gained in recognizing the limits of reason. ‚ÄúFaith frees and saves reason from error, and endows it with manifold knowledge.‚Äù Revelation serves as a lamp for the philosopher‚Äôs path toward truth. The Relationship between Philosophy and Faith in Historical Perspective 10. The history of philosophy is marked by those who lacked ‚Äúthe gift of faith‚Äù‚Äîan error that led to doubtful claims about the nature of reality but especially divinity. However, Christ, ‚Äúas the power and wisdom of God,‚Äù restores knowledge through his followers, and by their efforts redeems what is true in pagan philosophy. In doing so, Catholic doctrine was developed and defended against heretics and other adversaries who sought to propose contrary views. 11. In combating these adversaries, Catholic apologists even from the early centuries (for example, Justin Martyr) encountered both the power of reason to demonstrate certain attributes of God and the limitation of reason in relationship to revelation. 12. The encyclical continues the list of those early Christian thinkers who have labored to defend the faith from error and develop a philosophically informed account of it: Quadratus, Aristides, Hermias, Athenagoras, Irenaeus of Lyons, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Tertullian, amongst others, are listed. 13. In paragraph 13, Pope Leo XIII continues his list of those who have advanced the Christian intellectual tradition. He turns his attention first to St. Augustine, who Leo says ‚Äú[w]ould seem to have wrested the palm from all.‚Äù The genius of Augustine was his ability to combat ‚Äúmost vigorously all the errors of his age,‚Äù as well as his ability to lay down the ‚Äúsafe foundations and sure structure of human science.‚Äù The paragraph ends with mention of John Damascene, Basil, and Gregory of Nazianzen as carrying the tradition in the East, and Boethius and Anselm in the West, all of whom Pope Leo says ‚Äú[a]dded largely to the patrimony of philosophy.‚Äù 14. Paragraph 14 speaks of the ‚Äúdoctors of the middle ages,‚Äù the ‚ÄúScholastics,‚Äù whose contribution to the tradition was their ‚Äúdiligently collecting, and sifting, and storing up, as it were, in one place, for the use and convenience of posterity the rich and fertile harvests of Christian learning scattered abroad in the voluminous works of the holy Fathers.‚Äù Pope Leo XIII quotes Pope Sixtus V, who names in particular the ‚Äúangelic St. Thomas and the seraphic St. Bonaventure‚Äù as preeminent doctors whose ‚Äúsurpassing genius‚Äù and ‚Äúunwearied diligence‚Äù aided in further advancing the tradition. 15. The quotation from Sixtus V continues through paragraph 15, and it is here that scholasticism, drawing together and compiling the sacred writings, the work of the ‚Äúsovereign Pontiffs, the holy Fathers and the councils,‚Äù is portrayed as beneficial to the posterity in three ways: for (1) understanding and interpreting Scripture, (2) understanding the Fathers, and (3) combating heresies and errors. The last way is highlighted in the paragraph for the particular importance it plays in ‚Äúconfirming the dogmas of Catholic faith and confuting heresies.‚Äù 16. In paragraph 16, the praise of scholastic theology is extended to the philosophy upon which it is based. 17. The following paragraph names Thomas Aquinas as the preeminent example of scholasticism. He is praised for collecting together all the other arguments of scholastics, and then made valuable additions as well. Apart from his contributions to theology, Thomas, the encyclical claims, also touched finely upon all points of philosophy. 18. In paragraph 18, Thomas is said to have triumphed over previous errors, and supplied those who follow him with the means to defeat other errors that would arise. Thomas also distinguished, ‚Äúas is fitting,‚Äù faith from reason, without infringing upon the legitimate rights of either of them and instead strengthening each through the aid of the other. The Authority of St. Thomas Aquinas 19. The nineteenth paragraph begins a discussion of the many ways in which Aquinas‚Äôs authority has been recognized through the centuries. The encyclical describes how many religious orders mandated the study of his works to their members: the Dominicans, of course, but also the Benedictines, Carmelites, Augustinians, and Jesuits. This was done because St. Thomas reached such sound and defensible conclusions. 20. The twentieth paragraph of the encyclical refers to all the great universities of the scholastic period where Thomistic theology enjoyed prominence, creating harmony among all the schools adhering to his teaching. 21. The twenty-first paragraph of the encyclical continues the list of testimonials to St. Thomas‚Äôs greatness by mentioning some of the popes who have honored, borrowed from, and praised the work of St. Thomas. 22. Thomas Aquinas has long been held ‚Äúin singular honor‚Äù in the ecumenical councils, including those of Lyons, Vienne, Florence, and the Vatican. This high regard was most especially evident during the Council of Trent, in which his Summa was laid ‚Äúupon the altar, together with sacred Scripture and the decrees of the supreme Pontiffs.‚Äù 23. Aquinas has been equally esteemed even among critics of the Church, ‚Äúwho openly declared that, if the teaching of Thomas Aquinas were only taken away, they could easily battle with all Catholic teachers.‚Äù 24. The ‚Äústruggling innovators of the sixteenth century‚Äù philosophized without regard for faith. Their inventions were in accordance with their own whims, and so, naturally, there arose a great diversity of philosophies, ‚Äúdiffering and clashing‚Äù even in those matters of human knowledge that are most important. Pope Leo fears that many philosophers were forsaking the solid philosophical foundation of antiquity and turning toward ‚Äúa foundation open to change.‚Äù And another danger: while Leo affirms the important work of scholarship, he cautions that philosophical pursuits should not be characterized by ‚Äúmere erudition‚Äù; what is required, rather, is an authentic development of learning. The Need for a Thomistic and Scholastic Renaissance 25. Paragraph 25, which acknowledges that, in the face of these dangers, some already have already returned to the superior philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas, is followed by the hortatory and encouraging remarks in paragraph 26. 26. Both paragraphs use ornamental language in speaking of the ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù of the ‚Äúpure streams‚Äù from the ‚Äúprecious fountainhead of the Angelic Doctor.‚Äù The language may appeal implicitly to a Thomistic understanding of Beauty as a transcendental quality inseparable from the Good and the Truth. 27. The encyclical goes on in paragraph 27 to urge the teaching of scholastic philosophy and theology, especially to the young seminarians ‚Äúwho are the growing hope of the Church.‚Äù Scholastic thought is likened to a strong weapon with which one may best defend the Catholic faith against the assault waged against her by the ‚Äúmachinations and craft of a certain false wisdom.‚Äù Scholastic philosophy is presented as second only to the ‚Äúsupernatural help of God,‚Äù in its ability to defend the faith. 28. The restoring of the teachings of Thomas Aquinas in the universities and the strong foundation this will offer the students will also help society as a whole by offering it a ‚Äúmore peaceful and secure existence,‚Äù as well as protecting it from the ‚Äúplague of perverse opinions.‚Äù 29. Scholastic philosophy, with its ‚Äúsound judgment,‚Äù ‚Äúright method,‚Äù and ‚Äúspirit,‚Äù will strengthen and guide all the different disciplines, including the liberal arts and the physical sciences. 30. In particular, scholastic philosophy does not oppose the ‚Äúadvance and development of natural science.‚Äù On the contrary, philosophy is in accord with the conclusions of modern physics. This accord is exemplified by the openness of Aquinas and Albertus Magnus, among other scholastics, to giving ‚Äúlarge attention to the knowledge of natural things.‚Äù 31. This paragraph emphasizes that the revival of scholasticism and, in particular, Thomism for which the encyclical calls is not a recommendation to practice a slavish adherence to outdated doctrines and ideas: ‚Äúif there is anything that ill agrees with the discoveries of a later age ‚Ä¶ it does not enter Our mind to propose that for imitation in Our age.‚Äù It is crucial, as well, that Aquinas‚Äôs own writings be read and studied, rather than derivative works that may already be affected by errors. Conclusion 32.‚Äì34. The document ends with an invocation of God‚Äôs grace and the blessing of the saints, for the important work that is recommended in the encyclical.  Effects of the encyclical  Volume 1 of the Leonine edition of the works of St. Thomas Aquinas (1882) The interpretations and effects of the encyclical have been varied, some using it to authorize a return to a strict adherence to St. Thomas, others believing the document urges more a return to the spirit of Thomistic thinking. However various the effects may have been, the document has at least succeeded in reestablishing since its promulgation St. Thomas as a central figure in Catholic philosophy. The chief aim of Aeterni Patris was the reintroduction of Thomism into Catholic educational centers for the purpose of bringing faith and reason back into a fruitful dialectic. Pope Leo XIII had recognized the detrimental effects to both society and religion when reason is privileged over faith. In an effort to promote Thomistic scholarship, Pope Leo XIII commissioned a critical edition of Aquinas‚Äôs works, referred to as the ‚ÄúLeonine‚Äù edition. Although Thomism had already enjoyed a half-century revival before 1879 through the writings of scholars such as Carlo Maria Curci (d. 1891), Giovanni Maria Cornoldi (d. 1892), and Tommaso Zigliara (d. 1893), Aeterni Patris heralded a renaissance of Thomism that still reverberates in modern theological and philosophical discourse. Jesuit theologians such as Joseph Mar√©chal (1878‚Äì1944), Karl Rahner (1904‚Äì1984), and Bernard J. F. Lonergan (1904‚Äì1984) developed a post-Kantian Thomism sometimes called ‚ÄúTranscendental Thomism.‚Äù The French theologians Charles Journet (1891‚Äì1975), Jacques Maritain (1882‚Äì1973), and √âtienne Gilson (1884‚Äì1978) contributed significantly to Thomistic methodology. Journet along with Maritain founded the journal Nova et Vetera and contributed to sessions at Vatican II. Gilson founded the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies in Toronto, Ontario. Gilson‚Äôs Being and Some Philosophers (1949) and Maritain‚Äôs The Degrees of Knowledge (1932) are still widely popular among students of Thomism. Together, Gilson and Maritain are sometimes called \\"existential Thomists.\\" French Dominicans Pierre Mandonnet (1858‚Äì1936), Marie-Dominique Chenu (1895‚Äì1990), and Yves Congar (1904‚Äì1995) explored the historical background of Thomas Aquinas and its relationship to theology. One of the best known French Dominicans of the twentieth century was R√©ginald Garrigou-Lagrange (1877‚Äì1964), who influenced generations of students during his tenure at the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum) in Rome. These developments and contributions can be seen as a natural consequence of the aim of Aeterni Patris to bring faith and reason together in a fruitful dialectic. The spirit and thought of Saint Thomas Aquinas advocated by the encyclical has proven a valuable resource for Catholic philosophy and theology in bringing both faith and reason to bear on the problems of modern life. In Three Rival Versions of Moral Inquiry (1990) Alasdair MacIntyre examines three major rival traditions of moral inquiry: encyclopaedic, genealogical and traditional. Each was given defense from a canonical piece published in the late 19th century (the 9th Edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Nietzsche's Genealogy of Morals and Pope Leo XIII's Aeterni Patris). MacIntyre ultimately conducts a complex series of both interior and exterior critiques of the encyclopaedic and genealogical positions in an attempt to vindicate philosophical Thomism as the most persuasive form of moral inquiry.

It is printed fortnightly, normally at ¬£2.99, and is read by over 520,000 people each fortnight. Their slogan is No.1 for YouTubers!, the ONLY teen mag YOU need! The categories include a wide range of articles. The celebrity pages may have a topic (such as celebs who pick their noses, etc.) or can be just be embarrassing or enhancing pictures. Fashion shows clothes available at various stores and different ways to wear them and different ranges of colours and ways to apply make up to enhance one's features. Flow charts and polls let readers express their opinion and see what other people think on a topic. True stories contain stories of people's experiences, problems or ailments. \\"Problems\\" is a write-back system which allows girls to send in their problems which may appear in the magazine or receive a written reply. \\"Embarrassing moments\\" is a feature on readers' recent embarrassing moments. They are rated on how embarrassing they are: if the editors say 'Get over it', then it is deemed barely embarrassing; 'Slightly shameful' means it was embarrassing at the time but the reader should eventually get over it, and 'Completely cringey!' means she will never live it down. The magazine also features advice columns from YouTubers Zoella and Sprinkle of Glitter. Another magazine, named Shout Secrets, was released in October 2008, after a survey which showed that readers wanted more true stories and celeb gossip.

Emergency rations are items of food and drink that a person stores and relies on in case of an emergency. Emergency food supplies can be purchased for camping trips or wilderness adventures. These supplies are meant to last for several days. Many people also purchase long shelf life emergency food in case of natural disasters or other emergency situations. The food can come in the form of a powder, freeze dried, smoked or salted. The rations are to help people survive until help arrives and are often carried while hill walking or mountaineering, because of the risk of being stranded by an accident. In some organised events, such as Ten Tors, it is obligatory to carry emergency rations. Emergency rations are often carried by camping enthusiasts, especially back-pack campers, who are more likely to be far from food supplies. Emergency foodstuffs are usually high in caloric content, and sometimes also in nutritional content. Typical emergency foodstuffs are high- calorie foods such as candy bars, nutritional bars, energy or sports bars, hard bread or biscuit, dried meat (such as jerky), and dried fruit. If water is available, rations with little water content are lighter to carry. Emergency rations are generally carried on the person by people on foot in case of becoming lost or separated from normal food supplies. Water or other drinks are carried if water is not readily available from the environment.

It was released on May 28, 2002 through Relapse Records and was re-released on October 21, 2003. Production Most of the songs were written long before the album was recorded. \\"Workhorse\\" was premiered live in Memphis in July 2001. \\"Trampled Under Hoof\\", \\"Trilobite\\", \\"Where Strides the Behemoth\\", \\"Crusher Destroyer\\" and \\"Mother Puncher\\" were all played on a WFMU radio show on August 7, 2001, and \\"Trainwreck\\" was written while Eric Saner was still in the band. At the beginning of \\"Crusher Destroyer\\" is the roar of the Tyrannosaurus rex from the film Jurassic Park with Lex saying her brother's name, \\"Timmy!\\", as they get attacked in the jeep. Theme and cover art Troy Sanders has said that the album's theme is the element of fire. However, Remission was Mastodon's only album not considered a concept album until 2011's The Hunter. In an interview with online magazine Lollipop in 2004, Dailor explained how Remission was an album that helped him cope with his sister's death: > \\"My sister committed suicide when I was 15 (she was 14)...I was never able > to put that stuff anywhere. All that pain I was carrying inside. The pain of > losing her had always been there. With Today Is the Day, there was a lot of > anger involved. After that, I didn't want to be angry. When I start playing > in Mastodon and moved to Atlanta, there was a big personal healing. Mastodon > had a lot to do with that. That's one of the main reasons that the album is > titled Remission. Remission means forgiveness and healing. Mastodon helped > me do that: Forgive a lot of things that happened in my life.\\" Re-release The album was re-released on October 21, 2003, coinciding with a music video for \\"March of the Fire Ants\\". It had significant airplay on both Uranium and Headbangers Ball and featured dark elements such as a man being dug up and placed in a throne. A deluxe edition of the album, folded in digipak, contained a bonus DVD with a professionally filmed nine song live set recorded at The Masquerade in Atlanta, Georgia, on December 1, 2002, along with previously unreleased material. Another additional feature is a covered song, \\"Emerald\\", by Thin Lizzy, which appears as a bonus track on the CD. Reception Remission received overwhelmingly positive reception. AllMusic's Brian O'Neill noted the album's \\"technical ecstasy\\" with \\"a complex slant that nears prog rock proportions\\". He also compared the \\"Southern- sounding\\" jazzy drumming and clean guitars of \\"Ol'e Nessie\\" to the Allmans. Bryan Haywood of Pitchfork Media praised the album's production and drummer Brann Dailor as the stand-out musician. \\"They drop in just enough [mathematics] to keep the arrangements flavorful, but not so much as to overload the vintage guitar riffs with Dream Theater-like complexity. And then they counterbalance it with some nice, old-fashioned, Sabbath-style metal attitude.\\" Haywood commented, \\"The complete package sounds timeless, but in that unbelievable way that you've never heard before.\\" Kerrang! named the album in their list \\"The 13 Most Essential Sludge Records.\\" Commercial performance As of 2006, Remission has sold 49,000 units in the United States.

He was leader of the T√¢y Ninh branch, the dominant branch of Cao ƒê√†i in southern Vietnam. His authority, however, was not uncontested. =A top-level medium= In 1925, he and his two colleagues (Cao Quynh Cu and Cao Hoai Sang) tried to contact with spiritual entities through spirit communications. Using table-tapping, they got messages, first from their deceased relatives, then from Saints, and eventually from God. They all were admitted to be God's first disciples in the Third Religious Amnesty. On 25-4-1926, eighteen mediums were chosen by God to spread His teachings and carry out His instructions. Of those, Ph·∫°m C√¥ng T·∫Øc was the most important medium. It was he who wrote out the Cao ƒê√†i Religious Constitution and most of the Scriptures currently worshipped by Caodaiists. He was promoted to H·ªô Ph√°p, one of the top-ranking posts of the clergy. =An organizer= In 1927, transferred to Cambodia by the colonial government, he seized the opportunity to establish Cao ƒê√†i Foreign Missions under spiritual guidance. After acting Gi√°o T√¥ng L√™ VƒÉn Trung's death, he became the religious head and established a number of other religious organs. Arguably, most of the relatively complex religious structure owed him the full development as we know it. =An architect= He himself both gave the order to begin the construction of the T√¢y Ninh Holy See and later officiated the inauguration. Without this temple, Cao ƒê√†i might not have become a well-organized religion. Furthermore, other buildings and houses were set up under his supervision, including The Temple Of Intuition, The Temple of Enlightenment, Long Hoa Market, The Temple of Acknowledgement, The Temple of the Goddess. Others were planned for more favorable conditions such as The Temple of Thousands of Dharma, The Main Entrance Avenue, Cao ƒê√†i University which have not been started (2007). =A priest spreading God's teachings= In addition to the responsibilities of religious leadership, he was a true missionary who, in the name of God, preached the new doctrines. Not to mention numerous religious speeches, he gave speeches on The Holy Never Pathway and Esoteric Practice which were shorthanded by stenographists and published in 1970. These documents were considered among the most significant scriptures due to their content of Cao ƒê√†i philosophy as well as the ways of religious practice. =A leading religious figure in Vietnam from 1940s to 1950s= In 1941, many Vietnamese rebellions against French colonists broke out throughout the country. French rulers did what they could to crush the movement, imprisoning those who challenged their power. The fact that Cao ƒê√†i developed too fast also frightened them too much to overlook this new religion. Eventually, H·ªô Ph√°p Ph·∫°m C√¥ng T·∫Øc and at least four other Cao ƒê√†i dignitaries were sent into exile in Madagascar. During this period, French soldiers seized the T√¢y Ninh Holy See and the other religious offices, temporarily prohibiting all religious activities. As a result, the Cao ƒê√†i Armed Forces were founded by General Tran Quang Vinh in Southern Vietnam so as to protect Cao ƒê√†i believers as well as to overthrow the French government with Japanese military aid. However, Japanese Armed Forces were defeated in 1945 and withdrew to Japan. Vietnamese, in general, and the Cao ƒê√†i Army, in particular, were faced with the Allied, then French, return to Vietnam. In 1946, the political situation changed. Faced with the threat of the communist-led Vi·ªát Minh in the south, the French decided to bring back H·ªô Ph√°p Ph·∫°m C√¥ng T·∫Øc from exile and to ask for his cooperation in the struggle against the communists. Ph·∫°m C√¥ng T·∫Øc agreed, but not all Cao ƒê√†i leaders followed his lead. A treaty was signed between General Tran Quang Vinh and the French colonists on 9-6-1946. From then on, H·ªô Ph√°p Ph·∫°m C√¥ng T·∫Øc resumed his post as leader of the T√¢y Ninh branch of the Cao ƒê√†i. Like most Cao ƒê√†i, Ph·∫°m Cong T√°c collaborated with the French with the aim of securing the independence of at least the southern part of Vietnam. In 1954, Vietnamese Head of State B·∫£o ƒê·∫°i asked H·ªô Ph√°p Ph·∫°m C√¥ng T·∫Øc to be one of the advisors for the Vietnamese delegates in Geneva, Switzerland. He went to Paris and tried to prevent Vietnam from being partitioned. However, his persuasion failed, so he returned to Vietnam. After that, he paid visits to Taiwanese and South Korean leaders. In 1955, General Nguyen Thanh Phuong, unofficially instigated by Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu, surrounded T√¢y Ninh Holy See, demanding an internal purification which was actually a raid on those who opposed Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám's regime. So critical was the situation that H·ªô Ph√°p Ph·∫°m C√¥ng T·∫Øc had to flee the country, seeking political asylum in Cambodia. He lived there until his death in 1959. =An author= He was the author of many books on Cao ƒê√†i, including: *How to practice Caodaism under the pen-name Ai Dan ‚Äì 1928 *A Visit to Heaven 1927 *The Third Method of Practicing Caodaism 1947 *Breviaries for secular activities *Speeches *Poems A symbol of esoterism for Caodaists It is believed that H·ªô Ph√°p Ph·∫°m C√¥ng T·∫Øc was taught how to practice esoterism by God. He himself established the first meditation house, The Temple of Intuition, and entered for the first esoteric performance. However, there has been no evidence that he taught someone else to do so. He was the only Cao ƒê√†i leader who did a lot of preaching on Esoteric and Exoteric Practices of Cao ƒê√†i. Therefore, he is considered the Master of Cao ƒê√†i Esoterism.  Conclusion  The life of Ph·∫°m C√¥ng T·∫Øc exemplifies the early history of the Cao ƒê√†i religion from its founding in 1925 until 1956 when he left the T√¢y Ninh Holy See. He is revered as one of the most beloved disciples of the Great Cao ƒê√†i (God). At 37 years of age, he was ordained [by God] as the highest dignitary of Hiep Thien Dai. Since then he dedicated the rest of his life to the service of Cao ƒê√†i. From within the grounds of the Holy See to the surrounding areas throughout T√¢y Ninh Province, from temples to mansions, from small road ways to large highways and bridges, from the local markets to townhouses, from schools to hospitals, nursing homes to orphanages... there is a constant reminder of his great contributions in the name of Cao ƒê√†i. Though he is no longer with us, his spirit and energy lives on in each of the Cao ƒê√†i disciple many generations since. According to Cao ƒê√†i Cardinal Nguyen Huong Hieu and Cao ƒê√†i Juridical Renovator Truong Huu Duc, \\"without him there is no Cao ƒê√†i religion, because God came to Ngo Minh Chieu only to make it known that He is the Great Teacher, calling Himself Cao ƒê√†i the Great Sage\\"[without assigning specific duties as He later did Ph·∫°m C√¥ng T·∫Øc]. This statement speaks of his great significance in the organization and proliferation of the Cao ƒê√†i teachings. With this work concerning the Cao ƒê√†i faith and contribution to humanity, historian and Cao ƒê√†i dignitary Tran Van Rang summed up Ph·∫°m C√¥ng T·∫Øc's life (in the book A Portrait of Pham Cong Tac) in the following way: \\" An unwavering soul, of great courage, great fortitude, and great compassion\\".

During the Second World War, Roberts worked at the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS;) at Bletchley Park from 1941-45. He was a leading codebreaker and linguist, who worked on the Lorenz cipher system ‚Äî Hitler's most top-level code. Jerry Roberts was born in Wembley, London. His father Herbert, had trained as a pharmacist, but worked for Lloyds Bank head office in the City for the rest of his 40-year career, since coming to London from Wales in 1915. His mother, Leticia, was a pianist and an organist who played in the local chapel. He was educated at Latymer Upper School, Hammersmith in London 1933-39 and University College London 1939-41. He gained a degree in German and French. War service Early in the Second World War, his tutor at University College London, Prof. Leonard Willoughby, who had worked during the First World War in Room 40, the main cipher-breaking unit of that time, recommended the twenty-year-old Roberts as a German linguist to the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park where he was interviewed and accepted by Colonel John Tiltman as a codebreaker and linguist. Roberts was one of the four founding members of the Testery at Bletchley Park; the other two senior cryptanalysts were Major Denis Oswald and Captain Peter Ericsson, whilst head of the unit, Major Ralph Tester, was a linguist but not cryptanalyst. The Testery was tasked with breaking the Lorenz cipher code, named \\"Tunny\\" by the British. This was the Nazis' highest- level communications cipher system, which was used for communications between the Germany Army High Command in Berlin and their Army Commands in the field throughout occupied Europe, some of which were signed \\"Adolf Hitler, F√ºhrer\\". The cipher was Adolf Hitler's most secret code system and had 12 wheels against well-known 3 wheel Enigma; it was declassified in 2002, compared with Enigma in the 1970s. Roberts worked in the Testery until the end of the war, by which time it had grown to nine cryptanalysts, a team of 24 ATS women, and a total staff of 118. Work was organised in three shifts working round the clock. Roberts was one of the three shift-leaders For the first year, the messages that were broken by hand amounted to 1.5 million pieces. The Newmanry, which became active in July 1943, developed and used machine methods to help speed up one stage ‚Äî breaking of the chi-wheels but the psi-wheels and motor-wheels were still broken by hand in the Testery. From mid-1943 onwards, the Testery is credited with breaking over 90% of Lorenz traffic. Tens of thousands of Lorenz messages were intercepted by the British and broken at Bletchley Park by Roberts and his fellow code-breakers in the Testery. These messages contained much vital insight into top-level German thinking and planning. Tunny provided vital information that changed the course of the war in Europe and saved tens of millions of lives at critical junctures ‚Äî such as the Battle of Kursk in the Soviet Union, and D-Day. General Dwight Eisenhower (later the U.S President 1953-61) said after the war \\"Bletchley decrypts shortened the war by at least 2 years\\". Post-war After the war, Roberts was a member of the War Crimes Investigation Unit. There he employed his fluency in the German and French languages while working in the British Zone, interviewing witnesses and victims for various cases and taking legal statements from them for use in court. Thereafter, from 1948, Roberts pursued a new career in market research for 50 years. He initially worked for Market Information Services (MIS), a leading market research firm, in London. Between 1954‚Äì59 he was based Caracas, Venezuela, where he set up the first general research company in South America, learned to speak fluent Spanish and developed the company DATOS. Roberts spent 1960 in New York as a manager representing a major international advertising agency (CPV). Then, from 1961 to 1969, he was based in London as board director of M.I.S. In 1970, Roberts formed his own market research companies (one for the UK, one for the rest of Europe). These were sold to GfK NOP (National Opinion Polls) in 1993. He continued working as a consultant to NOP assisting with multi-country studies until he was nearly 80. He used his skill in languages in his work, pioneering multi-country market research studies across Europe for leading UK and multinational companies. He carried out market research for a wide range of leading UK and international clients in the fields of product marketing, public opinion and media research. His clients included British Gas, Reebok trainers, DuPont Teflon, Lycra, American Airlines, Chrysler cars, Holiday Inn hotels and many others. In retirement Roberts was the last survivor of the nine cryptanalysts who worked on Lorenz cipher. For the last six years of his life, he campaigned for proper recognition for Bletchley Park's \\"4Ts\\" ‚Äî for his colleagues in the Testery, and especially for its three \\"heroes\\": Alan Turing who broke the naval Enigma, Bill Tutte who broke the Lorenz cipher to help shorten the war, and Tommy Flowers who designed and built the Colossus, the world's first large-scale electronic, digital, programmable computer ‚Äî to vastly speed up the chi-wheel stage of the breaking of Tunny traffic. The other five stages of the work were performed by hand in the Testery by codebreakers and support staff. Roberts was honoured several times for his achievements. In July 2011, he was presented to Queen Elizabeth II in July 2011 at Bletchley Park. In October 2011, Roberts was featured in a BBC Timewatch Special titled Code-Breakers: Bletchley Park's Lost Heroes, first broadcast on BBC Two on 25 October 2011. In 2013, he received an MBE New Years Honours List and awarded a University College London Honorary Fellowship. The same year, he was also honoured with an investiture stamp, which is available through Bletchley Park Post Office. Roberts accepted all of these accolades as acknowledgment not of his own accomplishments, but of the work of his teammates at Bletchley Park, most of whom died unrecognised, before Tunny was declassified. Roberts' autobiography was published in March 2017, titled Lorenz: Breaking Hitler's top secret code at Bletchley- Park.http://www.thehistorypress.co.uk/articles/how-lorenz-was-different-from- enigma/ Notes References  in * 1920 births 2014 deaths People from Wembley People educated at Latymer Upper School Alumni of University College London British cryptographers Bletchley Park people Members of the Order of the British Empire ","title":"Jerry Roberts"},{"id":"3541172","text":"Nguy·ªÖn Th√†nh Ph∆∞∆°ng was a Vietnamese general under the Cao ƒê√†i sect and was in command of 25,000 soldiers.Serguei A.

The north‚Äìsouth position is a dominant position, where the top combatant can apply effective strikes such as knee strikes to the head, or easily transition into various grappling holds or more dominant positions. Transitioning into side control can be done by first switching into a particular hold known as ushiro-kesa-gatame (ÂæåË¢àË£üÂõ∫) or reverse scarf hold, where the chest points to the side, and the opponent's arm is controlled similarly to kesa-gatame. The north‚Äìsouth choke is employed exclusively from this position.

Kami shiho gatame involves pinning the opponent's arms to his or her side, typically by grabbing the opponent's belt and using the arms to press the arms of the opponent inwards. Kuzure-kami-shiho-gatame is similar, except that one or both arms of the opponent aren't pinned to the side, but can be controlled by for instance pinning them in between an upper arm and a knee. Kami shiho gatame is one of the seven mat holds, Osaekomi-waza, of Kodokan Judo. In grappling terms, it is categorized as a north‚Äìsouth hold.

He is a right-handed batsman and off-spin bowler. He is perhaps best known for taking a spectacular diving catch in a One Day International against Australia in 2007. Domestic career  Born in Nairobi, Kenya, Dalrymple made a double-century in 2003, becoming only the third batsman to do so in a Varsity match. Dalrymple has represented England at under-19 level against Sri Lanka, before captaining British Universities. In 1999, he joined Middlesex, and with them made a career-best innings of 244 at The Oval in 2004, despite only being present as a substitute for Andrew Strauss, away making his international debut. In November 2007, he announced he was to leave Middlesex, having turned down the offer of a new contract, saying: 'the time was right to seek a fresh challenge.' The next day, Glamorgan announced that Dalrymple had signed a three-year deal with them. It was announced in October 2008 that Dalrymple has been appointed County Captain for the 2009 season, succeeding David Hemp. In November 2010, he resigned from Glamorgan as a player, after being replaced as captain by incoming South African, Alviro Petersen; and, in April 2011, it was announced that he had rejoined Middlesex. After contributing 505 runs and 10 wickets to Middlesex's 2011 County Championship season, Dalrymple was released at the end of the summer. International career In June 2006, he made his One Day International debut against Ireland at Stormont, Belfast, scoring 17 off as many balls, and taking 1‚Äì51 from nine overs. He also made his Twenty20 International debut against Sri Lanka later that month, taking 1‚Äì17 from two overs and scoring 1. In addition, Dalrymple was selected in the squad to face Pakistan in the 2nd Test at Old Trafford, in what would have been his debut Test appearance. However, he was released from the squad prior to the match, with Monty Panesar preferred instead. Dalrymple also toured India with the English One Day International team, to compete in the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy. On 16 December 2006, he was drafted into the England Ashes Squad to replace Ashley Giles, who had flown back to England to tend to his sick wife. Although he did not play in any Test matches, he was a key member of the team during the Commonwealth Bank one-day series that followed, making a superb diving catch to dismiss Australia's Shane Watson as England won the second final. Dalrymple was selected for England's first two games of 2007 Cricket World Cup. However, after posting only scores of 2 and 3, and taking only one wicket, he was dropped. He did, however, return for England's final game of the Super 8 series against the West Indies.  Personal life  Like former Middlesex teammates Andrew Strauss and Ben Hutton, Dalrymple was educated at Radley, before going on to study Modern History at St Peter's College, Oxford, achieving a 2:1 whilst also captaining the Blues. He is married to Sophie Sackler. His grandfather, Ian Dalrymple, was a successful screenwriter, film director, and producer, who introduced Dirk Bogarde to the British Cinema in \\"Esther Waters\\" (1948).

The orchestra was established in 1964 as a studio orchestra, led by jazz musician Hans Last. The orchestra started touring in 1968 and has been very popular worldwide. From 1965, Polydor Records named him 'James Last', as they thought the name 'James' would be more suitable for the international market. Around 1970 the rhythm section was reorganized as a rock group (lead guitar: Helmuth Franke, rhythm guitar: Peter Hesslein, drums: Barry Roy Reeves, bass: Benny Bendorff, percussion: Christian Lembrecht and later Herbert Bornholdt). Bornholdt and Hesslein were members of the German progressive rock band Lucifer's Friend (another member, Peter Hecht, played with Last for a few years in the late 1970s), and Franke was a member of the pop-rock band Wonderland, whose recordings were produced by Last. Last initially used many of the musicians who, like himself, were based in Hamburg and were regularly employed by the Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR, or North German Radio) big band. Over time, many of the NDR musicians could not always get time off to tour with the Last band, so Last used this chance to make the orchestra more international. Some of the top musicians who have played in the James Last orchestra include Canadian violinist Trudean Conrad, Welsh drummer Terry Jenkins, Belgian trombonist Georges Delagaye, Swedish trumpeter Leif Uvemark and a number of American trumpeters including Bob Lanese, Rick Kiefer and brothers Chuck Findley and Bob Findley. Another trumpeter, Derek Watkins from England, recorded with The Beatles, playing on \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" and \\"Revolution 1\\". Some musicians are family: father-and-son violinists Dmiter Pintev and Stefan Pintev, and husband and wife Bob Coassin (trumpet, USA) and Anne-Louise Comerford (viola, Australia). Bob Coassin is widely known in America. All in all, about 20 different countries are represented in the membership of the orchestra.(All of Which were Recruited through the various James Last Admin Offices in Hamburg, London, and North America when the band became more of a Multi-National orchestra). James Last took much influence from the world of rock and pop when arranging music for his orchestra. A typical example is his version of \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" from the album Beachparty 2 which is influenced by the version sung by Richie Havens in the film Woodstock. Last's epic version of \\"Greensleeves\\" is a combination of the styles of Iron Butterfly and Blood, Sweat & Tears, two bands that he publicly declared his favourites in the late 1960s. His studio recordings do not always capture the energy unleashed at his live concerts where a combination of skilful arranging and talented musicians give some surprising performances. His versions of \\"Nature Boy\\" featuring Chuck Findley and \\"MacArthur Park\\" featuring Derek Watkins are two examples. James Last has so far (2013) sold more than 80 million albums during his career, which has honoured him with 208 Golden and 11 Silver records. On April 17 2014, James Last celebrated his 85th birthday. At the same time, he presented a tour for his band in 2015 which he completed in the spring of 2015, just before he died on 9 June in Florida.

Under the Childers Reforms it amalgamated with the 61st (South Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot to form the Gloucestershire Regiment in 1881. History =Early years= facings The regiment was first raised by Colonel Sir John Gibson, who had served as the Lieutenant-Governor of Portsmouth, as Sir John Gibson's Regiment of Foot on 16 February 1694. It was posted to Newfoundland to protect the colony there, losing many of its men to the extreme cold. The regiment was disbanded in 1697, but reformed under the same colonel in 1702. Posted to the continent during the War of the Spanish Succession the regiment fought at the Battle of Elixheim in July 1705 and at Battle of Ramillies in May 1706. It was then sent to the Spain, losing over half its men at the Battle of Almansa in April 1707, and then took part in the capture of Vigo in October 1719 during the War of the Quadruple Alliance. The regiment saw action in Flanders during the War of the Austrian Succession and, having been designated the 28th Regiment of Foot in 1751, it took part in the Battle of Louisburg in June 1758 and the Battle of the Plains of Abraham at Quebec in September 1759 during the Seven Years' War. The regiment was sent back in North America in May 1776 and took part in the Battle of White Plains in October 1776 during the American War of Independence. It also fought in the West Indies and helped take Saint Lucia in 1778, but was captured by the French on Saint Kitts in 1782 and interned until the end of the war. In 1782, renamed the 28th (North Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot as part of the reforms to create a territorial association for each regiment, it returned to Flanders following the outbreak of war with revolutionary France in 1793 and moved to the West Indies in 1795. A detachment remained in Gibraltar before being moved to Menorca in 1798. =Napoleonic Wars= In March 1801 the regiment formed part of the British expeditionary force that landed at Aboukir Bay in Egypt to oppose Napoleon's Army of the East. On 21 March, during the Battle of Alexandria, French cavalry broke through the British lines, formed up behind the regiment, and began to charge. Still heavily engaged to their front, the order was given \\"Rear Rank, 28th! Right About Face\\", and standing thus in two ranks, back to back, the regiment successfully defended itself. After the battle, the regiment began wearing a badge on the back as well as the front of the headdress to commemorate their action, a unique distinction in the British Army which was officially sanctioned in 1830.Daniell pp.69-75Grazebrook pp. 112‚Äì113 The regiment was dispatched to Denmark and took part in the Battle of Copenhagen in August 1807 during the Gunboat War.Cadell, p. 8 The regiment next landed in Portugal in July 1808 for service in the Peninsular War.Cadell, p. 29 It took part in the Battle of Corunna on 16 January 1809Cadell, p. 69 before being evacuated from the Peninsula the following day.Cadell, p. 72 A detachment remained behind and fought at the battle of Battle of Talavera in July 1809.Cadell, p. 74 The remainder of the regiment went on to take part in the disastrous Walcheren Campaign in summer 1809.Cadell, p. 76 The 28th Regiment at Quatre Bras by Elizabeth Thompson (Lady Butler)alt= The regiment returned to the Peninsula in January 1810.Cadell, p. 85 It saw action at the Battle of Barrosa in March 1811,Cadell, p. 94 the Battle of Albuera in May 1811Cadell, p. 110 and the Battle of Arroyo dos Molinos in October 1811, as well as the Battle of Vitoria in June 1813Cadell, p. 155 and the Battle of the Pyrenees in July 1813.Cadell, p. 172 It then pursued the French Army into France and fought at the Battle of Nivelle in November 1813,Cadell, p. 187 the Battle of the Nive in December 1813,Cadell, p. 192 the Battle of Orthez in February 1814Cadell, p. 212 and the Battle of Toulouse in April 1814.Cadell, p. 219 It was one of the few Peninsula veteran regiments which was available for the Hundred Days campaign and fought at the Battle of Quatre Bras and at the Battle of Waterloo, as part of the 8th Brigade commanded by James Kempt, in June 1815.Cadell, p. 232 Because of its actions in this campaign, the regiment earned distinguished mention in the dispatches of the Duke of Wellington. =The Victorian era= After the war the regiment spent the next 20 years in the Mediterranean, Ireland and England, before being posted to Australia as garrison troops. It served in India from 1842 to 1848 and fought at the Battle of Alma in September 1854, the Battle of Inkerman in November 1854 and the Siege of Sevastopol in winter 1854 during the Crimean War. It then served in India from 1858 to 1865, before spending further time in the Mediterranean. As part of the Cardwell Reforms of the 1870s, where single- battalion regiments were linked together to share a single depot and recruiting district in the United Kingdom, the 28th was linked with the 61st (South Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot, and assigned to district no. 37 at Horfield Barracks in Bristol. The final postings were to Hong Kong, Singapore, Malacca and Penang. On 1 July 1881 the Childers Reforms came into effect and the regiment amalgamated with the 61st (South Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot to form the Gloucestershire Regiment. Archive material of the 28th Regiment of Foot is held by The Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum in the Historic Docks Gloucester. Battle honours The battle honours of the regiment were: * Egypt campaign: No individual battle honours were awarded immediately after the campaign, instead the Sphinx badge superscribed \\"Egypt\\" (8 March -26 August 1801) was awarded in 1802. Mandora, awarded 1813-1817.

The \\"idiot light\\" terminology arises from popular frustration with automakers' use of lights for crucial functions which could previously be monitored by gauges, so a troublesome condition could be detected and corrected early. Such early detection of problems with, for example, engine temperature or oil pressure or charging system operation is not possible via an idiot light, which lights only when a fault has already occurred ‚Äì thus providing no advance warnings or details of the malfunction's extent. The Hudson automobile company was the first to use lights instead of gauges for oil pressure and the voltmeter, starting in the mid-1930s. Regulation Automotive tell-tales are regulated by automobile safety standards worldwide. In the United States, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 101 includes tell-tales in its specifications for vehicle controls and displays. In Canada, the analogous Canada Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 101 applies.Canada Motor Vehicle Safety Standard No. 101 In Europe and throughout most of the rest of the world, ECE Regulations specify various types of tell- tales. Types Different tell-tales can convey different kinds of information. One type lights or blinks to indicate a failure (as of oil pressure, engine temperature control, charging current, etc.); lighting and blinking indicate progression from warning to failure indication. Another type lights to alert the need for specific service after a certain amount of time or distance has elapsed (e.g., to change the oil).ECE R48, \\"Installation of lighting and light-signalling devices on motor vehicles\\" Colour may also communicate information about the nature of the tell-tale, for example red may signify that the vehicle cannot continue driving (e.g. oil pressure).) Many older vehicles used schemes which were specific to the manufacturer, e.g. some British Fords of the 1960s used green for oil pressure warning, while many other makes of the same era used amber for oil pressure. =Oil pressure= The oil pressure idiot light lights when engine oil pressure drops below a predetermined level. The light normally appears when the vehicle ignition is turned on, but the engine is not running, as it detects no oil pressure due to the oil pump not operating (the oil pump is powered off the crankshaft, so only operates when the engine is running). It normally turns off a few seconds after engine start as the oil pump starts working and building up oil pressure. This tell-tale can bear the legend or a pictogram of an oil can. Some cars illuminate the light red or yellow, depending on the action needed to be taken. =Engine temperature/EV battery temperature= The engine temperature tell-tale is usually installed singly, but has less commonly been installed in pairs. A pair of lights indicate insufficient (, blue) and excessive (, red) engine temperature. A single light usually indicates only an overheat condition in engine. In electric cars, it is usually to monitor the EV battery temperature and indicate the EV battery is overheating or is too cold to operate. One example is in a Nissan Leaf EV. =Malfunction indicator (check engine/hybrid/EV system)= A malfunction indicator lamp A \\"malfunction indicator lamp\\" (MIL) or \\"check engine light\\" (CEL) illuminates, usually in red, amber, or yellow, to indicate malfunction or a service requirement detected by the computerized engine management system. It is found on the instrument console of most automobiles. In the United States, an MIL with specified functions is required by environmental protection regulations. Unlike other types of idiot light, an MIL does not correspond to a condition that would have been read out on a gauge.https://books.google.com/books?id=q8_vHlaJHVwC&pg;=PA200&dq;=Malfunction+indicator+light+OBD&hl;=en&ei;=h4j-TNSEFoiDOpaCvc4M&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=1&ved;=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q;=Malfunction%20indicator%20light%20OBD&f;=false Code of Federal Regulations CFR 40 ar{Part 86, retrieved 2010 Dec 7 On vehicles equipped with OBD-II, the light has two stages: it illuminates steadily to indicate a minor fault such as a loose gas cap or malfunction with the vehicle's emissions controls, and it flashes when a severe condition is detected to alert the driver that continued driving may cause severe damage to the engine or catalytic converter emission control system. The MIL can present a legend, such as , , , or ; or it also can present a pictogram of an engine. In hybrid and electric cars, a fault with the hybrid/EV system shows the pictogram of the vehicle with the exclamation point to indicate a fault with the electric motor and/or hybrid/EV battery (in fuel cell cars, it is also to determine a fault with the hydrogen fuel cell) =Charging system= An idiot light can indicate that the vehicle's alternator or generator is not properly charging the battery. The battery will then discharge, disabling the car. The light normally appears when the vehicle ignition is turned on, but the engine is not running, as it detects that no power is coming from the alternator (the alternator is powered off the engine so only generates when the engine is running). It subsequently extinguishes as soon as the engine starts and the alternator starts generating electricity. This light presents a pictogram of a battery, or it presents the legend or or . =Trouble indicator= Some vehicles had a single indicator labeled or ; this was not a Check Engine Light, but a catch-all warning light to indicate trouble that was serious enough to portend an imminent breakdown. Early 1980s Fords, such as the LTD Crown Victoria, without the instrument option, had only this light, which indicated low oil pressure, overheating and carburetion problems without distinguishing among them. This usage of the \\"engine\\" light was discontinued in the mid-1980s to prevent confusion with the MIL. =Brake= Many vehicles have a red tell-tale to indicate that the parking brake is engaged or that there is a fault with the vehicle's braking system. This tell-tale in most cases bears the ISO symbols for a parking brake and for a braking system emergency. In the past, US regulations required this tell-tale to bear the legend . Vehicles with anti-lock braking system (ABS) have a lamp to indicate a detected failure. = Tire Pressure = Tire pressure monitoring systems are often mandated by law. As a cost-saving measure, individual readouts for each tire are often substituted with a single tell-tale indicator for all tires. Other systems Dashboard indicator lights or tell-tales are provided for turn signals, high beam, transmission mode in automatic transmission vehicles, and similar devices. These indicate running status and are not an indication of a fault. As automobiles became increasingly complex, more dashboard indicator lights have been added for the status of safety and convenience systems. Lights can indicate many conditions including: * Low fuel/charge or re-fuel/re-charge ‚Äì Appears when vehicle's fuel tank is nearing empty. Usually shaped like a gas dispenser, or a light next to \\"E\\" on the fuel gauge, and (most later cars) a buzzer. In an EV when the battery runs low, usually shaped with the EV charger symbol or the EV battery symbol and in most cases a buzzer or chime. Sometimes a \\"power low warning\\" indicator is displayed usually shaped like a turtle with a outline circle when the EV battery is critically low. In a plug-in hybrid (PHEV) when the battery is depleted and vehicle runs low on fuel, both indicators may show indicating to recharge and to refuel. * Glowplugs operating or wait to start (most diesel engines) ‚Äì Appears when the engine is switched on to indicate the engine glow plugs are operating, and the driver should wait for the light to extinguish before starting the engine. Usually shaped like a coiled cord. * Fasten driver or passenger seat-belt (usu. with a buzzer) ‚Äì Appears when the engine is switched and the driver's and/or passenger's seat belt is not buckled. A pressure sensor in the passenger seat prevents the passenger warning light from activating if the seat is unoccupied. Usually shaped like a person wearing a seat belt. * Traction control anti-skid system operative * Low windshield washer fluid * Air-bag system malfunction detected * Water in fuel (most diesel engines) *Door open (usu. DOOR AJAR), or trunk lid open (usu. with a buzzer) * Anti- theft alarm/engine immobilizer active (most later cars) * Speed radar detected * Automatic transmission fault * Low tire pressure * Modes of the heating/air conditioning system (defrost, recirculation, and others) * Cruise control on (shaped like a gauge with an arrow on the needle in most later cars) * Autopilot/Self driving mode active *EV light (Hybrids/PHEVs) to determine if vehicle is in electric operation and engine shut off. *Eco light (Newer cars) indicates that vehicle is in efficient/fuel-saving operation *Eco/Comfort/Sport Mode - Driving modes to drive economically or for excitement References Display technology Vehicle parts ","title":"Tell-tale (automotive)"},{"id":"3541230","text":"Notes of a Son and Brother is an autobiography by Henry James published in 1914. The book covers James' early manhood and tells of \\"the obscure hurt\\" that kept him out of the Civil War, his first efforts at writing fiction, and the early death of his beloved cousin, Minny Temple, from tuberculosis. Summary and themes In this second installment of his autobiography James begins to use family letters, especially those of his brother William and his father Henry James, Sr. Scholarship has shown that James altered the letters with revisions of his own. The book covers the Civil War years, which saw James' younger brother Wilky seriously injured and brought back to the family home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. James himself was exempted from service due to a back injury, the \\"obscure hurt\\" he suffered while putting out a fire with the local volunteer fire department. Meanwhile, James pursued his writing and earned his first fourteen dollars, which he looked at long and proudly. He began to place critical pieces and short stories in magazines like the North American Review, The Nation and The Atlantic Monthly. James' older brother William vacillated between art and science but finally settled on the latter, though many years would pass before he became the philosopher and psychologist of enduring fame. James offers a vivid portrait of his sometimes whimsical father, who insisted that his children \\"be something\\" instead of going in for \\"mere doing.\\" The final chapter of the book covers the ill health and death (at 25) of James' spirited and appealing cousin, Minny Temple. James quotes extensively from her touching letters and says that, for himself and William, her death was \\"the end of our youth.\\" Critical evaluation The book is written in the densest but also the most mature and insightful prose of James' final years. Contemporary critics especially appreciated the final chapter, the heartfelt and moving memorial to Minny Temple. The last paragraph of the chapter looks back to The Wings of the Dove, whose heroine Milly Theale was clearly inspired by Minny. This was one of the last books James saw through the press before his stroke in December 1915 and his death three months later. That biographical fact gives the book a special poignance that enriches James' loving memories of his family and friends. References * Henry James: Autobiography edited by F.W.

He won nine medals at the International athletics competitions. but curiously, he never won national championship (not outdoor, not indoor). Biography Antibo was born on 7 February 1962 in Altofonte, within the province of Palermo (Sicily). He revealed as a consistent middle-distance runner in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, when he arrived fourth in the 10,000 m final. His national popularity was however overshadowed by his compatriot Alberto Cova, who won the gold medal. After a bronze medal at the 1986 European Championships, behind Stefano Mei and again Cova, he gained the status of Italian number one, winning the silver medal over 10,000 m at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. At the 1990 European Championships in Athletics in Split he was victorious over both 10,000 m and 5000 m, becoming one of the most popular sportsmen in his country. He was famous for his unorthodox tactics. In Split, he won the 10,000 m through front-running and the 5000 m with a sprint on the final straight. In the 10,000 m final at the 1991 World Championships in Athletics in Tokyo, Antibo finished twentieth and last, losing to, for example, Moses Tanui, Richard Chelimo and Khalid Skah. He ran well during the first half of the race, but he slowed down radically during the second half (see, for example, \\"World Athletics Championships in Tokio 1991\\" (Yleisurheilun MM-kisat Tokiossa 1991), The Runner magazine (Juoksija- lehti), Helsinki, 1991). It was eventually revealed that such sudden absences during the races were related to a form of epilepsy. He retreated from professional athletics after his return from the 1992 Summer Olympics for a seizure in his last run.

New features included faster loading, an improved UI, VPN with an extra plugin, the saving of image and HTML files to a memory card or the device, homepages, bookmarks, and the ability to start on the last viewed page. Blazer 4 also featured support for web standards including HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0, WML 1.3, SSL 3.0, cHTML, JavaScript 1.5, CSS 1.0 and 2.0 (partial), GIF (both still and animated, along with transparency), JPEG, PNG, BMP and Cookies. The use of some advanced features may cause the browser to crash if it is not in Wide Page Mode. Soon after, Blazer 4.3 browser became available on the Treo 650, TX and LifeDrive. The most significant addition to 4.3 was the fast mode option, which removes images and/or disables cascading style sheets. Blazer 4.5 was released in May 2006, along with the Treo 700p as part of the device's application suite. It offers faster page rendering, and support for streaming video (using a built- in version of Kinoma Player). It was also provided with the Treo 755p along with a mobile optimized version of Google Maps.  Streaming video  Video is streamed via the Kinoma Video Player. It supports many formats, including Windows Media. At this time, Blazer does not support Adobe Flash Player - meaning you cannot view popular videos on sites such as ESPN or YouTube. This issue has never been addressed by Palm. A relatively small number of phones have the ability to use Flash. The new Centro has demonstrated the ability to play YouTube videos on its browser using a high speed internet connection. This is demonstrated on the mobile version of YouTube which does not use Flash Technology. Previous Palm phones with the current version of Blazer can also play these videos. This is the same version of YouTube accessed by the application of the same name on the Apple iPhone. Kinoma released an upgrade to the Video Player, which can be purchased for many Palm phones, that has support for Flash Video, but is not part of the Blazer web browser itself. The videos must be searched for via the Kinoma media guide. This guide acts as a browser for many popular video sites, like YouTube and Google Video. Many Palm users could get a discount on this upgrade.

Wrobel, Nation And History: Polish Historians from the Enlightenment to the Second World War While prewar Polish governments had little influence on Dictionary editorial policies, the postwar communist government of the People's Republic of Poland interfered substantially regarding who should be included.Peter Brock, John Stanley and Piotr J. Wrobel, Nation And History: Polish Historians from the Enlightenment to the Second World War Since Poland's 1989 break with the Soviet bloc, this bias has been partly corrected in several supplements. Polski s≈Çownik biograficzny constitutes a unique mosaic that depicts the full sweep of Polish history through biographies of many of the country's most notable sons and daughters. History This reference work has been published in Krak√≥w since 1935, although publication was suspended during Poland's World War II occupation by Nazi Germany and during the Stalinist period. The Dictionary is a joint publication of the Polish Academy of Sciences (Polska Akademia Nauk) and the Polish Academy of Learning (Polska Akademia Umiejƒôtno≈õci). It is edited at the Tadeusz ManteuffelHistorical Institute (') and is sponsored by the Foundation for Polish Learning (Fundacja na Rzecz Nauki Polskiej) and the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage (Ministerstwo Kultury i Dziedzictwa Narodowego). The Dictionary had been founded by W≈Çadys≈Çaw Konopczy≈Ñski. The first volume appeared in 1935, and four more (through \\"DƒÖbrowski, Ignacy\\") before World War II. After the war, by 1949, when Konopczy≈Ñski was forced by the communist government to resign his editorship, two more volumes had been published (through \\"Firlej, Henryk\\"). The project was then frozen until 1958, when it was revived under Kazimierz Lepszy. In 1964, after the Dictionary had grown by an additional three volumes (through \\"Jarosi≈Ñski, Pawe≈Ç\\"), Lepszy yielded to Emanuel Rostworowski. During Rostworowski's tenure as editor, the quality of the biographies increased, while government interference and censorship decreased. Twenty-two further volumes had been published (through \\"R√≥≈ºycki, Ignacy\\") when Rostworowski in 1989 passed the baton to Henryk Markiewicz. Under Markiewicz, nine further volumes were published (through Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski), as well as a supplement of Uzupe≈Çnienia i sprostowania do tom√≥w I-XL (Additions and Corrections to Volumes I-XL) rectifying communist-era bias and censorship. Since 2003, the Dictionary's editor has been Andrzej Romanowski. The PSB team estimates they will end their work around 2030, with expected 62 tomes. In 2003, PSB has launched its official Internet homepage. In 2010, the project has been unanimously endorsed by the Polish parliament (Sejm), and given its honorary patronage.

He published many of his works under the pen name Cezar Vraja.  Biography  IbrƒÉileanu was born into a family of Armenian origin, in T√¢rgu Frumos, Ia≈üi County. During the 1890s, he was attracted to Socialism, and began a collaboration with the left-wing press - periodicals such as Munca and AdevƒÉrul. He adopted part of the themes and goals expressed by the defunct Junimea, merging them with the ideas of Marxist thinker Constantin Dobrogeanu- Gherea, into a new form of Romanian populism, making it the main attribute of the magazine he led. He is remembered as the first mentor to such diverse figures as Mihail Sadoveanu, Ion Ag√¢rbiceanu, Ionel Teodoreanu, Gala Galaction, Octavian Goga, George Top√Ærceanu, and Tudor Arghezi. In his first major essay (1908), Spiritul critic √Æn cultura rom√¢neascƒÉ (roughly: \\"Selective Attitudes in Romanian Culture\\"), IbrƒÉileanu analysed the trends in Romanian literature from cca. 1840 to cca. 1880, trying to establish what had been the characteristics of original works. This is the first draft of his theory of selection, through which he determined the relationship between social context and artists' subjectivism (using it to explain why original artists had been ignored in favor of conformist ones of lesser talent). His thesis found its first major critic in modernist figure Eugen Lovinescu. He expanded the idea in works of literary criticism that are still influential: in 1909 - Scriitori ≈üi curente (\\"Writers and Trends\\"); in 1912 - Opera literarƒÉ a d-lui Vlahu≈£ƒÉ (\\"Mr. Vlahu≈£ƒÉ's Literary Works\\"), a doctorate thesis that featured one of IbrƒÉileanu's most quoted chapters, Literatura ≈üi societatea (\\"Literature and Society\\"); in 1930 - Studii literare (\\"Literary Studies\\"), containing his other major writing, Crea≈£ie ≈üi analizƒÉ (\\"Creation and Analysis\\"). He also authored a volume of aphorisms (1930), and a novel - Adela (1933). IbrƒÉileanu died in Bucharest.

He is the father of Fromental and L√©on Hal√©vy. Life and work Born at F√ºrth (in present-day Bavaria), at an early age Hal√©vy went to Paris, where he became cantor and secretary to the Jewish Consistoire of Paris. His knowledge of the Talmud and his poetical talent earned him the esteem of many French scholars, particularly the well-known Orientalist Sylvestre de Sacy. His first poem was \\"Ha-Shalom\\", a hymn composed on the occasion of the treaty of Amiens; it was sung in the synagogue of Paris, in both Hebrew and French, on the 17th Brumaire (8 November) 1801. The poem was praised in Latin verses by Protestant pastor Marron. In 1808 Hal√©vy composed a prayer to be recited on the anniversary of the battle of Wagram; in 1817, with the help of some of his co- religionists, he founded the French weekly L'Isra√©lite Fran√ßais, which, however, expired within two years. To this periodical he contributed a remarkable dialogue entitled \\"Socrate et Spinosa\\" (ii.73). His Limmude Dat u-Musar (Metz, 1820) is a text-book of religious instruction compiled from the Bible, with notes, a French translation, and the decisions of the Sanhedrin instituted by Napoleon.

Roosevelt Lake in the US state of Washington. The crossing carries State Route 21 between the Colville Indian Reservation in Ferry County and Clark in Lincoln County. The ferry has been in operation since the 1890s and under state control since 1930. During that time, five vessels have served the crossing, including the Martha S., which operated from 1948 to 2013, and the current ferry, the M/V Sanpoil. The M/V Sanpoil is the only Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) owned and operated ferry in Eastern Washington; the others are on Puget Sound in Western Washington. This was the first ferry crossing operated by the state of Washington; Washington State Ferries did not begin operations on Puget Sound until 1951. The other fare- free public ferry in Eastern Washington, the Gifford‚ÄìInchelium ferry, is operated by the Colville Confederated Tribes. Hours of operation are 6:00 a.m. to Midnight 7 days per week. The fare to ride is free.  Vessels  = Keller, L. A. McLeod & San Poil = Before the construction of the Grand Coulee Dam, the Keller, a cable ferry, served the crossing, at the confluence of the Columbia River and the Sanpoil River. The Keller had an on-board motor to winch the boat across the river. The L. A. McLeod, a Diesel powered side- wheeler, served the crossing from 1939 to 1944, a period which saw the completion of the Grand Coulee Dam and the formation of Lake Roosevelt. Between 1944 and 1948, the route was served by a barge called the San Poil, which was pushed by a tugboat, the Ann of Wilbur. = Martha S. = The Martha S. Launched in 1948, the Martha S., was powered by two diesel engines making total 470 horsepower, and was 80 feet in length and 30 feet in beam. Its maximum capacity was 12 cars, or a single tractor-trailer truck alone, but it was unable to accommodate highway legal double tractor-trailer trucks. The ferry was in service from its launch until its retirement on Sunday, July 7, 2013. The vessel was named in honor of Martha Shain, the wife of State Highway Director Clarence Shain at the time it was put in service. = M/V Sanpoil = The current Keller ferry, the M/V Sanpoil, is 116 feet in length, and is designed to carry 20 passenger vehicles, two single tractor-trailer trucks and 9 passenger vehicles, or a double tractor-trailer truck and 8 passenger vehicles. It was christened, received a tribal blessing, and began service on August 14, 2013, after the Martha S. docks were refit to handle the larger replacement vessel. The name \\"Sanpoil\\" is an Anglicized version of the name of the native peoples of the surrounding area, and is the name of the river adjacent SR 21 to the north of the ferry. The project to acquire a replacement ferry for the Martha S. was funded by the Washington State Legislature during the 2011 session. The Colville Confederated Tribes contributed $2 million of the approximately $12 million cost of the new vessel. On November 16, 2011, WSDOT awarded a contract for construction of the replacement vessel with delivery slated for May 2013. Justification for replacing the Martha S. included replacement parts for it no longer being commercially manufactured, requiring them to be custom-made as needed.

Summary and themes The seven chapters of this fragment show promise as a record of James' young manhood in Europe. He met many of the leading writers of the day, though his opinions of them were not always flattering. Tennyson he found rather dull and commonplace, not at all the fine mind he expected. The poet's reading of Locksley Hall left James unimpressed. George Eliot appealed much more to James with her interesting conversation and alert consideration of ideas. James tells a story of how he helped summon a doctor when George Eliot's injured stepson required urgent medical aid. He compliments the novelist on how carefully she attended to the young man. James also has much to say about the London of his first impressions: the rooms he stayed in, the Londoners he talked with on the streets, the theaters and museums he visited.

Mongrue, Liberia: America's Footprint in Africa: Making the Cultural, Social, and Political Connections, iUniverse.com, 2013, p. 72. He was the last president to belong to the Republican Party. Early life Payne was born in Richmond, Virginia, in 1819 to free mixed-race parents. Payne grew up in a deeply religious Methodist family and was a devout Christian.\\"Payne, James Spriggs\\", Dictionary Of African Christian Biography His father, David M. Payne, was a Methodist minister and was ordained a deacon by the Virginia Conference in 1824.Melton (2007), p. 58. Payne was noted for having a rather light complexion, with some estimates claiming that he was indeed an octoroon‚Äîhaving seven-eights European ancestry and one-eighth African ancestry. When Payne was ten years old, his family emigrated to Liberia on the ship The Harriet, the same ship as Joseph Jenkins Roberts, Liberia's future first president, under the auspices of the American Colonization Society.\\"Roll Of Emigrants That Have Been Sent To The Colony Of Liberia, Western Africa, By The American Colonization Society And Its Auxiliaries, To September 1843\\" Aside from religion, the young Payne showed interest in politics and economics. He later became a successful writer in these areas. As an adult, he was appointed by the Liberian government to work to complete the severance of Liberia's ties to the American Colonization Society. Political career Payne was elected as the fourth president of Liberia in 1868 and served a single two-year term. During his presidency, he worked to end the slave trade that still took place along Liberia's coast. Payne improved government relations with the indigenous communities and peoples, whom he believed the newer settlers and politicians had for the most part ignored. He worked to extend Liberia's trading and political ties with Europe.Thomas Morris Chester & R. J. M. Blackett, Thomas Morris Chester, Black Civil War Correspondent. Payne was elected a second time in 1876, again serving a single two-year term. Escalating economic difficulties began to weaken the state's dominance over the coastal indigenous population. When the financially burdened ACS withdrew its support from the colony in the years after the American Civil War, conditions worsened as Liberia struggled to modernize its largely agricultural economy. The cost of imported goods was far greater than the income generated by the nation's exports of coffee, rice, palm oil, sugarcane, and timber. As a result, Payne made efforts to increase the country's foreign trade. Later life and family On leaving political office in 1878, Payne continued his lifelong involvement in church work. In 1880, he was the Liberian delegate at the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Cincinnati, Ohio. The next year, he was elected president of the Methodist Annual Conference of Liberia. James Spriggs Payne died in Monrovia in 1882.

Since the Spring 2009 Timetable change on Monday 18 May, trains are able to arrive/depart from the station every half hour after the commissioning of a passing loop near Merthyr Vale. Wales Online news article  History  Merthyr Tydfil station in January 1968 before its first relocation The first station in Merthyr was opened by the Taff Vale Railway on 21 April 1841 in Plymouth Street. This was the second stage of the building of the main line from Navigation House (later Abercynon). The station was closed on 1 August 1877 when all Taff Vale passenger traffic was diverted to the Great Western Railway station at Merthyr High Street. In 1853, Merthyr High Street railway station opened as the terminus of the Vale of Neath Railway on the site. Designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, the two platform station encompassed broad gauge lines, and was enclosed by an overall roof. The Vale of Neath also encompassed the Swansea and Neath Railway, enabling trains to run to Swansea docks, and after amalgamation with the Great Western Railway on 1 February 1865, also ran through trains to London Paddington. Although other railways which ran into Merthyr had their own stations, after a third rail was added to the whole of the Vale of Neath system in 1863, the mixed gauge allowed them all to consolidate their services at Merthyr High Street: *Great Western Railway: trains from Hereford through to Swansea over a connection at Middle Duffryn *Taff Vale: to Cardiff (transferred from their own Plymouth Street terminus in 1877) *Brecon & Merthyr: onwards to Brecon *Rhymney Railway *London & North Western: to the Midlands (via Brynmawr and ) and Swansea *Cambrian Railways: Cardiff/Treherbert service to Aberystwyth via the Brecon & Merthyr route The station in 1986. After the whole of the Great Western system was converted to standard gauge on 11 May 1872, a thin central platform was later added to the station, adding two additional platforms. After the end of steam trains, and the closure of all but the Taff Vale lines into the station between 1951 and 1964, the passenger facilities were rebuilt by British Rail on the southwest corner of the original site in 1974 as a single island providing two platforms.

Early life Born to a Jewish family in Paris, L√©on was the son of the writer and chazzan √âlie Hal√©vy and the younger brother of the composer Jacques Fran√ßois Fromenthal Hal√©vy. He was educated at the Lyc√©e Charlemagne. Career Hal√©vy became a disciple and collaborator of Saint-Simon, aiding in the foundation of his journal, Le Producteur, and writing the introduction to his work, Opinions Litt√©raires, Philosophiques et Industrielles, in which Olinde Rodrigues and √âtienne-Martin Bailly also assisted. In 1828 he wrote a History of the Jews in Modern Times, one of the earliest works on this topic. In 1831, Hal√©vy became an assistant professor of French literature at the Ecole Polytechnique, where there was some discrimination against Jews. However he abandoned the position three years later. In 1837, Hal√©vy was attached to the Ministry of Public Instruction as chief of the bureau of scientific societies, and remained there until his retirement in 1853, after which he devoted the remainder of his life to literature, writing a large number of poems, translations, plays, and other works. Few of these are read today, although he was well regarded in his time. Amongst them was a biography of his brother Fromental, published after the latter's death in 1864. Personal life and death Hal√©vy became baptised in order to marry the daughter of the architect Louis-Hippolyte Lebas. Their son Ludovic Hal√©vy was one of the leading librettists of mid-century France. Ludovic's own children, √âlie Hal√©vy and Daniel Hal√©vy, were noted academics. Another son, by L√©on's irregular liaison with an opera singer, was the politician Lucien-Anatole Pr√©vost-Paradol. Hal√©vy died, aged 81, at Saint Germain-en-Laye.

It is performed by a waiter by using service forks and spoons from the diner's left. In France, it appears to be now known as service √† l'anglaise (\\"English service\\"), although historically that meant something else, with the hostess serving out the soup at one end of the table, and later the host carving a joint of meat at the other end, and diners serving themselves with other dishes.Strong, Roy, Feast: A History of Grand Eating, p. 296, 2002, Jonathan Cape, A modification of silver service is known as butler service. Features * Silver service food is served from the left. * Meals are served to the diner from platters, not plated in the kitchen. * The guest to the host's right is served first, usually a female guest. * Service continues clockwise. * Plates are cleared from the right,http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/nqfdocs/units/pdf/14438.pdf glasses from the right; again by starting with the guest to the host's right. * Glasses are stacked in a diagonal to the right and away, with wine (by course) in order and then water glass in front. * At a wedding, the bride is served first, followed by the bride's mother, then the Bridegroom, then to the left of the \\"top table\\" with the bridal party, restarting again at the other side of the table with the best man first then any other member of the bridegroom's party. Silver service, like all formal food service, is oriented for a right-handed waiter, left-handed waiters may use their right hand: to serve the food, the waiter stands behind the guest and to the guest's left, holds or supports the platter with their left hand and serves the food with their right hand. It is common for the waiter to hold the serving-fork above the serving-spoon both in the right hand, and use the fingers to manipulate the two as a pincer for picking up, holding and transferring the food. This technique or form requires much practice and dexterity. In butler service, the diner helps himself from a serving plate held by the waiter (butler). Traditionally, this type of service was used on Sunday evenings, when the waiting staff had the evening off and the butler helped out at dinner. In France, this kind of service is known as service √† la francaise (\\"French service\\"), again a very different meaning from the historical one.

The Mirage IIIV was a VTOL derivative of an existing conventional fighter, the Dassault Mirage III; the principal difference between the two types was the addition of eight small vertical lift jets which straddled the main engine. These lift jets would have been used during vertical takeoffs and landings, but would have been inactive during horizontal flight. The Mirage IIIV had come about as a response to the issuing of a NATO specification, NATO Basic Military Requirement 3 (NBMR-3), which sought a supersonic-capable VTOL strike fighter. The Mirage IIIV was a competitor with Hawker Siddeley's P.1154 VTOL fighter, a cousin of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier. Both aircraft competed to be selected to meet the NBMR-3 requirement. While the Mirage IIIV is commonly viewed as being more politically palatable due to an emphasis having been placed upon multinational development and manufacturing plans, the design of P.1154 (which only used a single engine) was seen as more straightforward and practical. Ultimately the P.1154 was selected to meet the NBMR-3 requirement to the detriment of the Mirage IIIV. One of the two prototypes constructed was destroyed in an accident; shortly following its loss, the whole project was abandoned; the surviving aircraft has since been placed on public display. Design and development =Background= In August 1961, NATO released an updated revision of its VTOL strike fighter requirement, NATO Basic Military Requirement 3 (NBMR-3).Jefford 2006 et al., p. 12. Specifications called for a supersonic V/STOL strike fighter with a combat radius of . Cruise speed was to be Mach 0.92, with a dash speed of Mach 1.5. The aircraft, with a payload, had to be able to clear a obstacle following a takeoff roll. Victory in this competition was viewed being of a high importance at the time as it was seem as being potentially \\"the first real NATO combat aircraft\\". During the 1950s and 1960, both French aircraft manufacturer Dassault Aviation and British aerospace company Hawker Siddeley Aviation (HSA) were deeply interested in vertical takeoff/landing (VTOL)-capable combat aircraft. HSA had already been keen to develop a new generation of combat aircraft that would be capable of supersonic speeds.Wood 1975, pp. 211-213. HSA's chief aircraft designer Sir Sydney Camm decided that the company should investigate the prospects of developing and manufacturing a viable combat-capable vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) fighter aircraft.Wood 1975, p. 213. Along with the subsonic Hawker P.1121 fighter (which would become the Hawker Siddeley Harrier later on, a supersonic design, designated as the P.1150 was produced; however, the release of NBMR-3, and subsequent revisions to it, led to the P.1150 proposal being considered to be undersized and thus unsatisfactory, which led to a desire for a redesign. The new, larger aircraft design soon emerged, which was initially designated as P.1150/3 prior to being redesignated as the P.1154.Buttler 2000, p. 118. In January 1962, HSA submitted the P.1154 design to NATO via the Ministry of Aviation.Wood 1975, p. 215. NBMR.3 attracted a total of eleven contenders, including Dassault's Mirage IIIV proposal, which would become viewed as the principal competitor to the P.1154. Substantial support for the Mirage IIIV came from Britain, work on the programme having involved the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC), while the Dassault-led design also held the favour of several members of the British Air Staff. While the P.1154 was judged to be technically superior, the Mirage IIIV had acquired a greater level of political palatability due to the co-operative development and production aspects proposed for the programme, under which work was to be distributed across a number of member nations. Protracting political maneuvering by firms and national governments alike was deployed in attempts to secure their respective project's selection.Wood 1975, p. 216. In May 1962, the P.1154 emerged as the winner in the competition for the NBMR.3 over the Mirage IIIV.Buttler 2000, p. 119. While the Mirage IIIV had not been selected to meet NBMR-3, however this did not lead to orders for the rival P.1154 being placed. The French government subsequently withdrew from participation once the Dassault design had not emerged victorious.Jefford 2006 et al., pp. 12‚Äì13. According to aviation author Jeffort, the Mirage IIIV had been rejected mainly because of its excessive complexity, using nine engines compared to the P.1154's single-engine approach.Jefford 2006 et al., p. 19. However, NATO lacked any central budget, instead relying on individual member nations to actually procure military equipment, while the NBMR-3 selection went unheeded by all of the NATO member nations. Thus, in 1965, the whole NATO project was unceremoniously terminated. =Dassault Balzac V= Since the Rolls-Royce RB162 lift engines which had been specified for the Mirage IIIV were not expected to be available before 1963, Dassault decided to modify the first Mirage III prototype into an interim VTOL testbed; in this configuration, it became the Balzac V. This was fitted with eight Rolls-Royce RB.108 lift engines along with a single unreheated Bristol Orpheus BOr 3 as the main engine.\\"R-R for Dassault.\\" Flight International, 17 May 1962. p. 764. According to aerospace publication Flight International, a key goal for the Balzac prototype was to prove the autopilot system, which was identical to the unit which was proposed use with the Mirage IIIV, as well as the lift and transition system.\\"Balzac VTOL Forerunner of the Mirage IIIV.\\" Flight International, 2 August 1962. pp. 174-175. The Balzac began tethered hovering on 12 October 1962 and achieved the first free hover only six days later. The first accelerating transition from vertical take-off to horizontal flight took place on its 17th sortie on 18 March 1963. The aircraft had two fatal accidents, one in January 1964 and one in September 1965. After the last accident the aircraft was not repaired.Jackson 1985, p. 62. =Mirage IIIV= Dassault Mirage IIIV In the meantime, the Balzac had led to the actual Mirage IIIV, which was roughly twice the size of the earlier aircraft. A pair of Mirage IIIV prototypes were constructed, the first of which conducted its first hovering trial on 12 February 1965.Jackson 1985, p. 66.\\"IIIV in the Z Axis.\\" Flight International, 25 February 1965. p. 276. It was powered by a single Pratt & Whitney JTF10 turbofan engine, designated as the TF104. The TF104 engine was originally evaluated on a specially-constructed aerial testbed aircraft, the Mirage IIIT, which shared many similarities to basic design of the Mirage IIIC design, with the exception of modifications in order to accommodate the selected engine.\\"Mirage III T.\\" Dassault Aviation, Retrieved 18 June 2017. The TF104 engine was quickly replaced by an upgraded TF106 engine, with thrust of 74.5 kN (16,750 lbf), before the first prototype made its initial transition to forward flight in March 1966.\\"Snecma TF-106.\\" Flight International, 6 May 1965. p. 687. The prototype subsequently attained Mach 1.32 during test flights. In June 1966, the second prototype, which featured a TF306 turbofan engine for forward thrust of 82.4 kN (18,500 lbf), conducted its first flight. During September of that year, it attained Mach 2.04 in level flight, but was lost in an accident on 28 November 1966. The Mirage IIIV was never able to take off vertically and successfully attain supersonic flight during the same flight. The loss of the second prototype had effectively killed the program, and in fact killed any prospect of an operational Mach 2 vertical take-off fighter for decades. The competing Hawker P.1154 had been cancelled in 1965 by the government just as the prototypes were under construction; however, its subsonic cousin, the Hawker-Siddeley Kestrel VTOL attack aircraft was flying in tri-partite trials with the UK, US and West Germany. The French preferred the Mirage IIIV, and the international cooperation that would have been necessary to move the P.1154 into reality would never materialise. Some of the P.1154 work contributed to the final operational vertical take-off fighter based on the Kestrel, the highly successful Harrier. The Mirage IIIV was never a realistic combat aircraft; the eight lift engines would likely have been a maintenance nightmare, and certainly their weight imposed a severe range and payload penalty on the aircraft. Design The Dassault Mirage IIIV was a supersonic-capable vertical takeoff/landing (VTOL) fighter aircraft. It shared the general layout of earlier Mirage fighters, but featured a long and relative broad fuselage along with a bigger wing; the Mirage IIIV was considerably larger than contemporary fighter aircraft of its era.Flight International 20 May 1965, pp. 774-775. Akin to the earlier Balzac V testbed, the Mirage IIIV was outfitted with a total of nine engines: a single SNECMA-modified Pratt & Whitney JTF10 turbofan, designated TF104, capable of producing up to 61.8 kN (13,900 lbf) of thrust, and eight Rolls-Royce RB162-1 engines, each being capable of generating a maximum of 15.7 kN (3,525 lbf) thrust, which were mounted vertically in pairs around the centreline. A key design feature of the Mirage IIIV to improve vertical flight performance was the installation of movable thrust deflector doors ahead of the nozzles set in the aircraft's underside.Flight International 20 May 1965, p. 774. These would be inclined 45¬∞ rearwards while on the ground, dispersing both debris and hot gasses away from the aircraft. As the engines accelerated to full power, these doors would automatically drop to a 90¬∞ position in order to obtain maximum lift thrust. According to Flight International, the Mirage IIIV had an advertised performance envelope in the vicinity of Mach 1.15 when flown at low altitude and Mach 2.3 when flown at height. Throughout development, the electronics were given substantial attention; it was this element of the design that has been attributed as being a major contributing factor to the cost overruns which impacted the programme.Flight International 20 May 1965, p. 775. Many elements of the cockpit and ancillary electronics of the Mirage IIIV were later reused on the conventional Mirage IIIF, which later re-designated as the Mirage F1.

Bell logos contained on the bottom of Trimline bases were filled in, leaving a giant lump next to \\"Western Electric\\".  Telephone changes  Toward the end of the Bell System, Western Electric telephones contained much more computer technology and more plastic over metal, since advances in electronics and manufacturing processes made it possible, and there was no longer the need to produce heavy duty, long-lasting telephones. In 1985, the 2220 Trimline was heavily modified, including a touch-tone/pulse dial switch, eliminating the need for the 220 rotary phone, foreshadowing what was to come for other AT&T; telephones. The 1985 Trimline, like other new telephones introduced after the AT&T; breakup, was marked \\"AT&T; TECHNOLOGIES - MADE IN U.S.A.\\" IC chips, used in these updated \\"electronic\\" telephones used WExxx model number nomenclature. In 1986, AT&T; closed the Western Electric Indianapolis Works plant, and Trimline and other residential telephone production was moved overseas. Production of the residential models of the 2500/2554 telephones were shifted overseas as well, both marketed under the \\"Traditional 100\\" brand. The 500/554 rotary phones ended production as they were no longer needed. A new Design Line telephone was introduced and produced overseas as well, and many variations of single line telephone sets were manufactured over the years. AT&T; Technologies kept the Shreveport Works open, and Princess & 2500/2554 business model production continued in the U.S.. Also multiline key telephone systems, such as the Merlin and the Spirit systems were manufactured there. Formerly Shreveport manufactured payphones. Any phone made overseas by AT&T; Technologies no longer had Western Electric markings, except for plugs on modular telephone cords whose clips were marked with \\"WE\\" initials. Telephones made overseas by AT&T; Technologies were produced in Thailand, Hong Kong, Singapore, and China. Telephones produced at these plants were also marked with \\"Custom Manufactured in (country) by AT&T;\\"; Chinese made telephones were marked \\"Custom Manufactured in China for AT&T;\\". Residential telephone production was shifted back to North America in 1993 when AT&T; opened established a subsidiary in Mexico and built a telephone plant.

The devotee Beni chants Guru Nanak's merit who in serenity spiritual bliss enjoys. Brief biography Nothing is known about the exact date and place of birth of Bhagat Beni. In spite of all this uncertainty, he can be called a contemporary of Guru Nanak. It seems that Beni lived in this world somewhere between mid-15th century to the mid-16th century. He was a well-educated scholar, with a very humble temperament. He was ever ready to serve the true preceptor which provided him real comfort: \\"Beloved! other than Thee none else have I. Nothing else do I love; in Thy grace lies my joy.\\" SGGS-61 Principles and ideals Bhagat Beni makes a severe denunciation of the Hindu rituals and austerities of Hath Yoga' so that common man learns of the real motive of true religion i.e. cultivation of the Divine Name. He has three hymns on this subject included in the Guru Granth Sahib under Siri Raag (P.93), Ramkali (974) and Prabhati (1351) musical measures. In these hymns he has severely denounced in an apt and cryptic tone the ritual formalism and advised us to ever remember the True Lord. In his hymn in Ramkali measure, beginning with The passage ira, Pingala and Sukhmana, all in one place, at the tenth Door abide\\" says: The Master's teaching in mind he bears, His mind and body to the Lord's devotion dedicating. By the enlightenment by the Master granted, are crushed demons of evil. Lord! Beni for devotion to Thy Name supplicates. SGGS-974 This shows that he, who is fully absorbed in the Divine Name, has got rid of his sleep. He who has to overcome his five senses, must love the Lord's Name. The nine doors open only to develop love for and attachment with this manifest world. However, the tenth door is mystical through which one develops unity with God. A proper use of this saves man from failing to the trap of maya. As such, his life is not wasted, and he remains united to his object. The Divine Light kindles within him the four-pronged lamp, a musical measure which comprises five instruments begins to play in his mind. Thus, in this hymn, Bhagat Beni lays emphasis on discarding ritualism and on developing unity with the Lord through the feeling of devotion. On an analysis of the language of this hymn, some scholars opine that Beni has denounced 'the limbs smeared with sandalwood paste and tulsi leaves placed on the forehead yet the heart be like one holding knife in hand (SGGS 1351). Thus, this hymn is said to stand in binary opposition to the Sikh precepts, but the fact is that he makes a categorical statement that the state of mystical unity with the Lord includes the fruits of Yoga practices and pilgrimages. The hymn included under Prabhati measure paints a true picture of a man caught in a life of rituals and sham. Beni says: \\" You besmear your body with sandalwood paste and put tulsi leaves on your forehead, but in the hand of your heart you have a sharp dagger. How deceitful you are! still you pretend to have your consciousness fixed on the Lord. You are a prey to agnosticism. In your heart of hearts you have been conspiring either to kill someone or to usurp the property of the other. You dance before your deity so as to please it, but your mind is ever full of wicked designs. Thus, all that you are doing is futile because you are by nature wicked, immoral and impious. No doubt, you wear a rosary of tulsi-beads, a pastemark on your forehead, but all this is a sham because you have not purified yourself from within. Thus all your actions are futile, deceitful and full of wastage, How can the Lord be pleased with such action? What is acceptable to Him is the prayer offered in a humble and devout manner. Therefore, the seeker must make a note that: Whoever the essence of the self has not contemplated, All his action are hollow, blind. Saith Beni : Let man by the Master's guidance On the Lord meditate. None without the holy Preceptor finds the path. SGGS-1351 Guru Arjan Dev has also said that Bhagat Beni attained enlightenment only through the Holy Word. Bhai Gurdas has also referred to the life of Bhagat Beni in the 14th stanza of his tenth Var. Therein he says that Beni was so close to the Lord that the latter Himself took the form of a king and fulfilled all his material needs (The Lord) protects honour of the devotee and calls on him as a king. He provides him all solace and takes care of his expenses ... ... He came down from there to the devotee and showed his benevolent love. Thus He makes devotees ford Him. From the above it appears that Bhagat Beni had completely coalesced himself with the Lord. Bhagats generally have in a way, put the Lord under their spell : Thou to Thy devotees art compliant- The devotees from Thee have strength SGGS-962 Death As we have not been able to locate the exact date, year of Beni's birth we have also failed to ascertain the date/Year and place of his death. However, it remains an accepted fact that he has through his pious and enlightened utterances, set new paths for a devotee to realize the spiritual essence.

Education From 1899‚Äì1902, he was a student at the Royal Drawing School, now the Norwegian National Academy of Craft and Art Industry in Oslo. Arneberg began his education of the architect with employment as assistant to the architect, Alfred Christian Dahl (1857‚Äì1940) in Oslo from 1888‚Äì1900. Arneberg studied at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm from 1904 to 1906. He also studied with Swedish architects Isak Gustaf Clason, Gustaf Lindgren, and Erik Lallerstedt. In Stockholm, he studied with a group of Norwegian architect students who came to be influential in the academic environment, including Magnus Poulsson.The Viking Ship Museum (Kulturhistorisk museum) Career In 1908, Arneberg established his own architectural practice. He and architect Ole Andreas Sverre (1865-1952) worked as partners on Arneberg's earliest works, including a proposal for the Royal Lodge (Kongsseteren) at Voksenkollen outside Oslo. As an independent architect, Arneberg's work included a large array of residences, office buildings, churches, railroad stations, and interiors. He is most associated with his work on the Oslo City Hall (with Magnus Poulsson) and interior design of the UN Security Council in New York City. The Viking Ship Museum in Bygd√∏y, built for the Oseberg ship was completed in 1926. He also worked on Skaugum, the official residence of the Crown Prince and Crown Princess of Norway.Skaugum in Asker (The Royal Family) Awards Arneberg was one of the first recipients of the Medal of St. Hallvard in 1956 and was awarded the Prince Eugen Medal in 1960. He was named a Commander with Star of the Order of St. Olav and received the King Haakon VII's Jubilee Medal and the King Haakon VII's Commemorative Medal in gold. He was made a commander of the Order of the Polar Star and was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in Stockholm. The √òstfold Architectural Association (√òAF) named the Arnstein Arneberg Prize (Arnstein Arnebergprisen) in his honor. The prize was first awarded for the 50-year anniversary of the √òAF in 2008.

The film was originally rated X but later re- rated as NC-17 in 1996. The plot concerns actors and directors in the early 1930s who were unable to make the transition from silent films to talkies, and thus turned to making pornography. The film's title takes its name from the double meaning that \\"insert\\" both refers to a film technique and sexual intercourse. Inserts was filmed in the vein of a one-act stage play on one set and filmed entirely in real time. Plot Prior to the opening credits we see portions of the stag film that is shot in the course of the movie. Voices are overheard that make it apparent that men and women are watching this in the present day. At the end a man complains that there was no \\"cum shot\\", something that will later develop into a plot point. The story takes place in Hollywood in the early 1930s, shortly after the start of the talkie period. A visionary and gifted young Hollywood director known as Boy Wonder (Richard Dreyfuss) has fallen out of favor with the studios. This is ostensibly due to his reluctance to lower his standards or abandon his artistic and experimental style, such as using a hand-held camera, for the sake of churning out lesser quality stag films for easy money, due to his alcoholism and his fear of leaving his house. He works out of his decaying mansion, which is the only one left on a street being turned into a freeway. On the morning of this particular shoot, a heroin-addicted waitress named Harlene (Veronica Cartwright) arrives. Harlene was once a well-known and respected star during the silent film era, and she too is reluctant to join the ranks of the \\"talkies\\" due in part to her unappealing, high-pitched squeaky voice. She is now the star in the first of his six-picture deal. She prepares and shoots heroin while Boy Wonder drinks heavily during a conversation about the changing times in Hollywood. An actor called Rex the Wonder Dog (Stephen Davies) soon arrives, wearing a white suit with grass stains on his knees, having just come from his job working for a mortician. During his introduction, Rex gullibly believes a man from a studio who that says that he will put him in the mainstream talkies, and has an appointment to meet him in his hotel room later that same day. Boy Wonder awkwardly attempts to make an artistic film using an actress under the influence of heroin and an actor who becomes increasingly frustrated with the director and all of his poetic talk, much of which he admits he doesn't understand. The scene goes wrong when Rex gets out of control during the action and Boy Wonder needs to smash a wine bottle over his head to get him to stop. Just then Big Mac (Bob Hoskins), a porno film producer, enters the scene. He has small heroin packets in his jacket pocket, an unlit cigar in his mouth, wads of money for Rex and a pretty wannabe actress named Cathy Cake (Jessica Harper) hanging on his arm. Harlene takes her payment in heroin and soon dies from an overdose in an upstairs bedroom. Rex finds the dead body, and everyone is terribly upset over this turn of events. Boy Wonder talks about continuing his film, but Rex refuses to perform with a dead woman. Big Mac offers Rex a part in a mainstream movie in order to convince Rex to help him bury the body and, while the two are away, Cathy and Boy Wonder develop a chemistry that eventually leads to another ironic high point in the film. Boy Wonder offers to film Cathy for insert shots of her nude body to double for the late Harlene. At first, Cathy refuses to undress, but when she does, she soon becomes aroused by Boy Wonder filming her. After a while, he makes love to her believing he has found something of a soulmate, but she is disappointed when she learns the camera was off. Boy Wonder's sexual experience with Cathy marked the end of his longstanding problem with impotence, which was evidently related to his emotional problems. Boy Wonder quickly realizes that this romantic encounter was simply a ploy to get her into the film, and that she has used and directed him the way he used and directed her. Big Mac and Rex return to find both of them half naked. In a jealous rage, Big Mac ends his six-picture stag film contract with Boy Wonder, who by this time is completely drunk. Rex beats up Boy Wonder in retribution for hitting him earlier with the wine bottle by doing likewise. Big Mac takes the film reel that Boy Wonder used and leaves with Rex and Cathy. After Boy Wonder is left alone in his home, a man knocks at the door. This is Clark Gable, a then little-known actor who had been said to be intending to call on Boy Wonder about a film project. Boy Wonder will not answer the door, and after a short time the unseen man leaves. The end of the film finds Boy Wonder alone in his spacious living room, sitting in the same place where the film began; playing piano and singing, pondering what he'll eat for lunch. This last remark brings home the fact that, while a great deal has occurred in the course of the film, the movie was shot in real time. Cast * Richard Dreyfuss as Boy Wonder * Jessica Harper as Cathy Cake * Veronica Cartwright as Harlene * Bob Hoskins as Big Mac * Stephen Davies as Rex Production The film was originally written in 1972. John Byrum felt his career was, in his words, \\"going nowhere fast. I was asked to write a porn film but I couldn't so instead I wrote a film about trying to write in the porno genre. It's a very personal film.\\" Byrum was unable to raise finance but the script was read by Tony Bill who then hired Byrum to write Harry and Walter Go to New York. When this script was sold for $500,000, Byrum was considered \\"hot\\" and he was able to raise finance for Inserts. The money came from United Artists, Devina Belling, Clive Parsons and star Richard Dreyfuss, who had just made Jaws. (Belling and Parsons helped finance Harry and Walter.) The film was made in London over three weeks on a budget of $350,000 of which $150,000 went to Dreyfuss. Byrum said the film \\"would probably have been better accepted ten years ago but whether people love or hate the movie they should know that everyone involved made a commitment and believed in it.\\" The film involved waist-up nude scenes from Jessica Harper and Richard Dreyfuss.New Face: Perils of Jessica Harper By JENNIFER DUNNING. New York Times 19 Aug 1977: 55. Release The film was originally given an X rating. Richard Dreyfuss personally appealed the decision. \\"We knew it would be controversial but had no idea it would get an X rating,\\" said Belling. \\"It is a film about survival, ambition and fear of rejection but nobody seems to understand that.\\"Movie Call Sheet: Beatty to Star in 'Hard Core' Murphy, Mary. Los Angeles Times 27 Feb 1976: e9. Reception =Critical= Roger Ebert gave Inserts 2.5 stars out of a possible 4, writing that the film's dialogue was stilted and the setting not entirely convincing, but that Dreyfuss and Cartwright gave effective performances and the film \\"has a certain quirky charm.\\"Roger, Ebert (April 2, 1976). \\"\\"Inserts\\". RogerEbert.com. Retrieved May 28, 2019. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune awarded an identical 2.5-star grade and observed, \\"You can tell the film was directed by a writer. Many times it reads like a play, one of those plays in which dialog always echoes earlier dialog. But that's where Dreyfuss' energy rescues the film. He supplies the rough edge that busts up the concocted script.\\"Siskel, Gene (April 6, 1976). \\"'Inserts': A love-hate poem to film?\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 3, p. 5. Vincent Canby of The New York Times thought that the film was \\"essentially a stunt, a slapstick melodrama in the form of a one-act, one-set, five-character play. It is, however, a very clever, smart-mouthed stunt that, in its self-described 'degenerate' way, recalls more accurately aspects of old Hollywood than any number of other period films, including 'Gable and Lombard.'\\" A review in Variety declared, \\"Chalk up Byrum as a director with a good flair for handling actors, with Jessica Harper scoring as the shrewd innocent and Stephen Davies and Bob Hoskins right as the more flamboyant stud actor and boss respectively. But it is all somewhat too surface despite its possible allusions to highly fictionalized real Hollywood '30s types.\\"\\"Film Reviews: Inserts\\". Variety. December 10, 1975. 26. \\"Reviewed at Paris International Film Festival, Paris, Nov. 22, 1975.\\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called it \\"one of those pictures that's absolutely determined to tell it like it was‚Äîor still is. But writer-director John Byrum is so intent on this it apparently never occurred to him that he really doesn't have anything to say that isn't already pretty well known‚Äîmainly, that Hollywood could be/can be a pretty sordid place, endlessly deceptive even to the most jaded.\\"Thomas, Kevin (February 5, 1976). \\"Black Humor on the Porno Set\\". Los Angeles Times. Part I, p. 31. \\"...opening today at Mann's Westwood...\\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post panned the film as \\"one of those trashy concepts with nowhere to go but back to the trash heap. The sooner this sordid and pretentious fiasco drops out of sight, the better it will be for several promising careers, particularly the career of Richard Dreyfuss, who has committed a formidable artistic faux pas by hitching his lively, ascendant star to a worthless vehicle.\\" Pauline Kael of The New Yorker stated, \\"Byrum is only twenty-eight, and this film was made (in England) on a small budget (around a half million). Still, the Boy Wonder's callow paradoxes ('Nothing pure, old sport, is ever simple,' followed by 'Nothing simple is ever pure') and the pearls of condescending wisdom that he drops are pure juvenilia.\\"Kael, Pauline (March 15, 1976). \\"The Current Cinema\\". The New Yorker. 121. Tom Milne of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote that early on \\"Inserts looks as though it might be going somewhere as a reflection on Hollywood's fall from dream factory to second-hand porn pusher,\\" but then \\"the script wanders well out of its depth into some turgid ruminations about artistic integrity versus commercial opportunism, simultaneously taking the opportunity to indulge a little titillation until the whole thing begins to founder with embarrassed self-mockery into routine sexploitation.\\" The film holds a score of 73% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 11 reviews, with an average rating of 6.08/10. =Box office= The film was a box office disappointment.CLOSE ENCOUNTERS WITH A RISING STAR By Michael Goodwin.

A flexible and far-sighted politician, he recovered Georgia from a century-long Mongol domination, restoring the country's previous strength and Christian culture. Reign Royal charter of King George V, 14th century. Territory of Georgia during the reign of King George V. George was born to King Demetrius II the Self- sacrificing and his third wife Natela, daughter of Beka I Jaqeli, prince and Atabeg of Samtskhe. Demetrius was executed by the Mongols in 1289, and the little prince George was carried to Samtskhe to be reared at the court of his maternal grandfather (Beka). In 1299, the Ilkhanid khan Ghazan installed him as a rival ruler to George's elder brother, the rebellious Georgian King David VIII. However, George's authority did not extend beyond the Mongol-protected capital Tbilisi, so George was referred to during this period as \\"The Shadow King of Tbilisi\\". In 1302, he was replaced by his brother, Vakhtang III. After the death of both his elder brothers ‚Äì David and Vakhtang ‚Äì George became a regent for David's son, George VI, who died underage in 1313, allowing George V to be crowned king for a second time. Having initially pledged his loyalty to the Il-khan √ñljait√º, he began a program of reuniting the Georgian lands. In 1315, he led the Georgian auxiliaries to suppress an anti-Mongol revolt in Asia Minor, an expedition that would prove to be the last in which the Georgians fought in the Mongol ranks. In 1320, he drove the marauding Alans out of the town Gori and forced them back to the Caucasus Mountains. King George was on friendly terms with the influential Mongol prince Choban, who was executed by Abu Sa'id Khan in 1327. George used this loss as a pretext to rebel against the already weakened Ilkhanate. He stopped payments of tribute and drove the Mongols out of the country. The following year he ordered great festivities on the Mount Tsivi to celebrate the anniversary of the victory over the Mongols, and massacred there all oppositionist nobles. In 1329, George laid siege to Kutaisi, western Georgia, reducing the local king Bagrat I the Little to a vassal prince. In 1334 he reasserted royal authority over the virtually independent principality of Samtskhe, ruled by his cousin Qvarqvare I Jaqeli. Having restored the kingdom's unity, he focused now on cultural, social and economic projects. He changed the coins issued by Ghazan khan with the Georgian ones, called George's tetri. Between 1325 and 1338, he worked out two major law codes, one regulating the relations at the royal court and the other devised for the peace of a remote and disorderly mountainous district. Under him, Georgia established close international commercial ties, mainly with the Byzantine Empire, but also with the great European maritime republics, Genoa and Venice. George V also extended diplomatic relations to the Bahri dynasty of Egypt, achieving the restoration of several Georgian monasteries in Palestine to the Georgian Orthodox Church and gaining free passage for Georgian pilgrims to the Holy Land. According to Kldiashvili (1997), the introduction of the Jerusalem cross, taken as the inspiration for the modern national flag of Georgia in the 1990s, might date to the reign of George V.D. Kldiashvili, History of the Georgian heraldry, Parlamentis utskebani, 1997, p. 35. In the 1330s, George secured the southwestern province of Klarjeti against the advancing Osmanli tribesmen led by Orhan I. In 1341 he interfered in the power struggle in the neighbouring Empire of Trebizond and supported Anna Anachoutlou who ascended the throne with the help of the Laz, only to be put to death a year later. George V died in 1346. He was succeeded by his only son, David IX. He was buried at the Gelati Monastery near Kutaisi, western Georgia. Marriage and child The identity of his wife is not known. The \\"Georgian Chronicle\\" of the 18th century reports George V marrying a daughter of \\"the Greek Emperor, Lord Michael Komnenos\\". However the reigning dynasty of the Byzantine Empire in the 14th century were the Palaiologoi, not the Komnenoi. The marriage of a daughter of Michael IX Palaiologos and his wife Rita of Armenia to a Georgian ruler is not recorded in Byzantine sources. Neither is the existence of any illegitimate daughters of Michael IX. The Komnenoi did rule however in the Empire of Trebizond. A Michael Komnenos was Emperor from 1344 to 1349, but his only attested child was John III of Trebizond; whether John III had siblings is unknown.Kelsey Jackson Williams, \\"A Genealogy of the Grand Komnenoi of Trebizond\\", Foundations, 2 (2006), p. 178 The Chronicle reports only one known son of George V, David IX of Georgia.

Finn and Godleman became the two youngest first-class debutants for the county, beating the record set by 16-year-old Fred Titmus in June 1949. Godleman did not bat in the first innings, but opened the batting in the second innings, scored an unbeaten 69. He continued to play for the Middlesex second XI in 2005 and 2006, and also played for Middlesex in four Twenty20 matches in 2006. He played in three Under-19 Test matches against the Indian side that toured England in 2006, and in five Under-19 ODIs in Malaysia in early 2007. Godleman played his second first-class match for Middlesex against Oxford UCCE at the Parks in April 2007, scoring 55 after opening both innings. He played his third first-class match in Middlesex's first match of the 2007 County Championship, against Somerset in Taunton. Batting at number 5, he made 113*, sharing a fourth-wicket partnership of 80 with Owais Shah (193) and then an unbroken fifth-wicket partnership of 193 with wicket-keeper David Nash (100*), with the team declaring on 600‚Äì4. Somerset responded with a mammoth score of 850‚Äì7 declared, including a triple century for Justin Langer, and the match was drawn. In his next game, Godleman top-scored in the first innings, reaching 77 against Northamptonshire at Lord's. At that point he had passed 50 in all five innings he had played in first-class cricket, but his run came to an end in the second innings when he was lbw to Jason Brown for 40. England Under-19s His form dropped slightly as he continued to make 40s and 30s but failed to convert to 50s and larger scores. He was given a chance to regain this lost form when Pakistan U19 toured England in August 2007. Godleman opened the innings with Alex Wakely and the two shared a relatively slow but prolific opening partnership which ended at 198 when Wakely departed for 112. Godleman fell soon after for 71 but England went on to amass 532 all out. Pakistan U19 were then bowled out for 214 and 260 resulting in England winning by an innings and 58 runs. The second test saw another good opening partnership of 95 and this time Godleman went on to make a U19 Test Match century, eventually being caught out on 115. He was out in the second innings however for a duck as Pakistan went on to win the 2nd test by 3 wickets and level the series at 1‚Äì1. The U19 One Day International series provided Godleman an opportunity to prove that he could score quickly as well as slowly, as he had batted in the Test series. He made a brisk 32* in the first ODI as rain intervened and the match was abandoned as a no result, he then made a rather slow 29 runs off 43 balls in the low scoring second match, which saw Pakistan finish a remarkable game chasing 161 by just 1 wicket having recovered from 99‚Äì8. The third ODI proved another disappointment for Godleman as he once again made it to the high 20s and once again got out. The fourth match proved to be his day however as he became the highest U19 run scorer for England in ODIs, passing names such as: Michael Vaughan, Alastair Cook, Nick Knight and Marcus Trescothick. He faced exactly half the balls in the innings (150 balls) and scored 149 not out, as Adam Lyth and himself took England to a massive score of 313‚Äì7. Move to Essex Having moved to Essex on loan after losing his place in the Middlesex side, Godleman signed a three-year deal with the county in August 2009. Playing in his debut innings in a County Championship match against Hampshire, Billy scored 92 off 146 before being bowled by Danny Briggs. After a disappointing start to the 2011 season when Billy averaged just 19, he was dropped from the LV County Championship team. On his recall, he made 39 and 130 at Grace Road vs Leicestershire County Cricket Club in July 2011. At the start of the 2012 season Billy made 130 against Gloucestershire County Cricket Club, but then was dropped from the first XI in May after failing to reach 30 in eight championship innings.  Derbyshire career  At the end of August 2012 Billy was released by Essex, and joined newly promoted first division side Derbyshire, on a two-year contract. In April 2013, he scored what is believed to be the slowest half- century in the history of the County Championship. Whilst playing for Essex, Godleman played his club cricket for Wivenhoe Town CC and helped coach at Colne Cricket Academy. In 2015 season he crossed 1,000 Championship runs in a season for the first time in his career. He also made centuries in three successive innings as well as impressed with his stand-in captaincy in three games. In March 2016, he was named captain of Derbyshire County Cricket Club side after Wayne Madsen stepped down.Godleman appointed Derbyshire captain References External links Billy Godleman's player profile at Middlesex County Cricket Club 1989 births Living people English cricket captains Derbyshire cricket captains English cricketers Essex cricketers Middlesex cricketers Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers People from Camden Town English cricketers of the 21st century ","title":"Billy Godleman"},{"id":"3541408","text":"Walhalla with the village of Donaustauf (around 1850) Donaustauf is a market town in Bavaria, east of Regensburg at the foothills of the Bavarian Forest.

It was originally inspired by the work of H. Paul Grice and developed out of his ideas, but has since become a pragmatic framework in its own right. The seminal book, Relevance, was first published in 1986 and revised in 1995. The impact of their work is seen by the fact that Google Scholar lists over 21,000 citations of this book. Overview Relevance theory aims to explain the well recognised fact that communicators usually convey much more information with their utterances than what is contained in their literal sense. To this end, Sperber and Wilson argue that acts of human verbal communication are ostensive in that they draw their addressees' attention to the fact that the communicator wants to convey some information. In this way they automatically assert that they are \\"relevant\\" to their addressees. A relevant utterance in this technical sense is one from which many conclusions can be drawn at a low processing cost for the addressee. The addressee uses the information contained in the utterance together with his expectations about its relevance, his real-world knowledge, as well as sensory input, to infer conclusions about what the communicator wanted to convey. Typically, more conclusions can be drawn if the utterance contains information that is related to what the addressee already knows or believes. In this inference process, the \\"literal meaning\\" of the utterance is just one piece of evidence among others. Sperber and Wilson sum up these properties of verbal communication by calling it ostensive-inferential communication. it is characterised by two layers of intention on part of the communicator: :a. The informative intention: The intention to inform an audience of something (to communicate a certain content). :b. The communicative intention: The intention to inform the audience of one's informative intention (to draw the audience's attention to one's informative intention). Definitions To describe the claims of relevance theory on a more rigorous level, we need to define a number of technical terms as introduced by Sperber and Wilson. ;Manifestness A fact is manifest to an individual if he is capable of accepting it as true or probably true at the given time. ;Cognitive environment The set of all facts that are manifest to an individual. This comprises everything they can perceive, remember or infer, including facts they are not currently aware of. ;Cognitive effect An effect on an individual's cognitive environment triggered by \\"outside\\" information such as utterances directed at the individual. This includes addition of new facts or beliefs, as well as increase or decrease of the confidence in existing beliefs and their rejection, and also the reorganization of information into schemas or maybe other structures to simplify subsequent processing. Typically, an utterance has more cognitive effects if it contains new information that is somehow related to the addressee's current cognitive environment, so that he can draw conclusions from the combined old and new data. ;Positive cognitive effect A cognitive effect that is helpful rather than hindering for the individual (e.g. providing true information as opposed to wrong information). More technically: a cognitive effect that contributes positively to the fulfilment of the individual's cognitive functions and goals. ;Relevance of a phenomenon An utterance ‚Äì or any other observed phenomenon ‚Äì is relevant to an individual to the extent that its positive cognitive effects on the individual are large and the mental processing effort to achieve these effects is small. Relevance is a comparative property: the more positive cognitive effects and the less processing effort, the more relevant the utterance. Relevance of an utterance Here are some examples to illustrate the concept of relevance. If Alice and Bob are planning to go on a trip next weekend and Alice tells Bob : (1) Next weekend the weather will be really awful. this is highly relevant to Bob, as he can draw a host of conclusions, modifying his cognitive environment: Alice wants them to rethink their plans and wants to inform Bob of this wish; Bob agrees ‚Äì or doesn't agree and just wants to bring oilskins; Alice wants to know Bob's opinion on that matter; etc. By contrast, saying : (2) The weather was really awful on 19 October 1974 in Cumbria. makes just one piece of new, unrelated information manifest to Bob, and is thus hardly relevant; and : (3) The weather is really awful right now. is not relevant as it doesn't tell Bob anything new; he has already seen for himself. Finally, the sentence : (4) On the weekend weeks after 19 October 1974 the weather will be really awful. contains exactly the same information as (1) but requires more effort to process, and is thus less relevant under this definition. The two principles of relevance The first or cognitive principle of relevance says that human cognition tends to be geared to the maximisation of relevance. Historically, evolutionary pressure has resulted in cognitive systems that recognise potentially relevant stimuli and try to draw relevant conclusions. More importantly for the issue at hand, the second or communicative principle of relevance says that every utterance conveys the information that it is : a. relevant enough for it to be worth the addressee's effort to process it. (If the utterance contained too few positive cognitive effects for the addressee in relation to the processing effort needed to achieve these effects, he wouldn't bother processing it, and the communicator needn't have taken the trouble to utter it.) : b. the most relevant one compatible with the communicator's abilities and preferences. (Otherwise the communicator would have chosen a more relevant utterance ‚Äì e.g. one that needs less processing effort and/or achieves more positive cognitive effects on part of the addressee ‚Äì to convey her meaning. After all, she wants to be understood as easily and reliably as possible.) This principle is summed up as \\"Every utterance conveys a presumption of its own optimal relevance\\". If Alice tells Bob something ‚Äì anything ‚Äì, he is entitled to expect that Alice wanted her utterance to be consistent with the communicative principle of relevance. Consequently, if Alice tells Bob something that does not seem to be worth his processing effort, such as sentences (2) or (3) above, or something that seems to be less relevant than Alice could have put it, such as (4), Bob will automatically search for an alternative interpretation. The most easily accessible interpretation that is consistent with the communicative principle of relevance is the one Bob accepts as the right one, and then he stops processing (because any further interpretations would cost him more processing effort and would thus violate condition b). The constraint that utterances are compatible with the communicator's abilities and preferences accounts for suboptimal communication, such as when the communicator is unable to think of a better phrasing at the moment, as well as for stylistic and cultural preferences (e.g. politeness considerations), withholding information, and lying. Inferences =Explicature= On hearing an utterance, the addressee first concludes that the presumption of optimal relevance is met. He then decodes it, which however yields only very incomplete information. Usually, most of the information conveyed by the utterance has to be inferred. The inference process is based on the decoded meaning, the addressee's knowledge and beliefs, and the context, and is guided by the communicative principle of relevance. For example, take an utterance : (5) Susan told me that her kiwis were too sour. Information the addressee has to infer includes * assignment of referents to indexical expressions ** For the utterance to be relevant, \\"Susan\\" most likely has to refer to a Susan both speaker and addressee know. ** In the absence of other possible female referents, the pronoun \\"her\\" has to refer to Susan. (In a different context, as when (5) is preceded by \\"Lucy didn't like the food at the banquet\\", a different inference would be drawn.) * disambiguation of ambiguous expressions ** Possible interpretations involving sour kiwifruit are far more accessible than ones involving sour birds; and even if the sentence were about birds it would not provide enough context to satisfy condition a of the communicative principle of relevance. * enrichment of semantically incomplete expressions ** The possessive \\"her kiwis\\" could refer to kiwis Susan ate, kiwis she bought, kiwis she grew herself, etc. Following (5) by \\"So she didn't win the fruit grower's contest\\" establishes relevance of the latter option. ** \\"too sour\\" also needs to be specified to make sense. Given the above context, the kiwis must be too sour for the judges at the contest. Consequently, the explicit meaning of (5) is : (6) Susan told the speaker that the kiwifruit she, Susan, grew were too sour for the judges at the fruit grower's contest. This is called an explicature of (5). =Implicature= Further inferences that cannot be understood as specifications and extensions of the original utterance are implicatures. If speaker and addressee know that Susan is a sore loser, an implicature of (5) could be : (7) Susan needs to be cheered up. The distinction between explicature and implicature is not always clear-cut. For example, the inference : (8) He drank a bottle of vodka and fell into a stupor. ‚Üí He drank a bottle of vodka and consequently fell into a stupor. has traditionally been seen as an implicature. However, relevance theorist Robyn Carston has argued that an utterance's implicatures cannot entail any of its explicatures, because the otherwise resulting redundancy would not be consistent with the relevance principle. Therefore, the inference in (8) has to be an explicature, or more specifically a case of enrichment. Another argument for (8) to be an explicature is that it can be embedded in negations and if clauses, which is supposedly impossible for implicatures. =Real-time interpretation= The described process does not run in sequential order. An addressee of an utterance does not first decode it, then derive explicatures, then select implicated premises from his cognitive environment, and then derive implicated conclusions. Instead, all of these subtasks run in parallel, and each can aid in solving the others. Interpretation vs. description ‚Äî =Echoic utterances= Sperber and Wilson distinguish the interpretive use of utterances from their descriptive use. An utterance is used descriptively in the \\"usual\\" situation where the communicator claims it to represent some state of affairs, i.e. to be true of this state of affairs, as in \\"It is raining\\". It is used interpretively if it represents some other utterance or thought, irrespective of the truth or state of affairs, as is the case with direct or indirect quotations, summaries, quoting folk wisdom, linguistic example sentences, tentative scientific hypotheses, et cetera. On a deeper level, every utterance is interpretive of a thought of the speaker's. This makes interpretations of other people's thoughts interpretive to the second degree (path (a) in the diagram). An utterance that achieves its relevance by interpreting another utterance and expressing some propositional attitude towards it (such as endorsement, doubt, ridicule, etc.) is called echoic. Both attribution and attitude can be made explicit or left implicit; implicit information of course has to be inferred. : (9) Max correctly predicted that it was a good time to buy. (both attribution and attitude explicit) : (10) A good time to buy, I don't think. (attribution implicit, attitude explicit) : (11) A good time to buy, indeed. (both attribution and attitude implicit) =Literal and non-literal utterances= Just as quotations are not necessarily identical to the material they quote or interpret but only have to resemble it to some extent, an utterance need not be identical to the speaker's thought it interprets. Consequently, there is a continuum from strictly literal and not-quite-literal to figuratively used utterances. Examples for the latter are loose language use (saying \\"I earn ‚Ç¨2000 a month\\" when one really earns ‚Ç¨1997.32), hyperbole, and metaphor. In other words, relevance theory views figurative language, just as literal language, as a description of an actual state of affairs (path (c) in the diagram), the only difference being the extent to which the utterance resembles the speaker's thought. Now if a figurative expression needs less processing effort than the literal expression (as with \\"I earn ‚Ç¨2000\\"), or has more contextual effects (as with good metaphors), the principle of relevance mandates its use over literalness. =Irony= Relevance theory explains irony as an echoic utterance with implicit attribution and implicit attitude, the attitude being one of rejection, disapproval, ridicule, or the like. For example, if an overly cautious driver pulls into a main road which is completely clear except for a cyclist on the horizon, the co-driver might reprovingly say \\"There's something coming\\". In saying this, he echoes the driver's usual attitude and ridicules it; and this makes the utterance ironic. Just as there is a continuum from literal to metaphorical utterances, there is a continuum of echoic utterances from approving literal quotations to disapproving irony. =Speech acts= Relevance theory only recognises three types of generic, universal speech acts: saying (that), telling (to), and asking (whether). Other speech acts are either * culture specific or institutional rather than linguistic (for example, bidding at bridge, promising, or thanking); they have to be learned like all aspects of a culture, or * not essential to the comprehension process, so that no special pragmatic principles are needed to explain them (for example, asserting, predicting, suggesting, claiming, denying, requesting, warning, threatening). Saying that is the speech act type associated with declarative sentences and paths (a) and (c) in the diagram. Depending on the context, a declarative utterance of \\"The bus is leaving\\" can be an assertion (c), a prediction (c), a report of what the bus driver has said (a), and so on. Telling to is associated with imperative sentences. These, too, can serve different functions depending on context, such as expressing a request or a desire of the speaker (path (d)), or an advice or a desire of the hearer (path (b)). : (12) Driver to traffic warden: Pretend you didn't see me. (d) : (13) A: Could you tell me the way to the station? :: B: Turn right at the traffic lights and keep straight on. (b) Asking whether is the speech act type for interrogative sentences. To cover not only ordinary questions but also rhetorical questions, exam questions, etc., this speech act type is not analysed as a request for information but as an assertion that the answer would be relevant to the speaker or the hearer. In asking an ordinary question, the speaker expresses that the answer would be relevant to her; in rhetorical questions, she brings something to the addressee's attention that she thinks is relevant to him; etc.  Contrasted with the conduit metaphor There are two ways to conceive of how thoughts are communicated from one person to another. The first way is through the use of strict coding and decoding (such as is used with Morse code), also known as the Shannon-Weaver model. In this approach the speaker/author encodes their thoughts and transmits them to their audience. The audience receives the encoded message and decodes it to arrive at the meaning the speaker/author intended. This can be visualized as follows: :Speaker's thought/intention ‚áí encoded ‚áí transmitted ‚áí decoded ‚áí intention/thought understood This is usually referred to as the code model or the conduit metaphor of communication. Human communication, however, is almost never this simple. Context almost always plays a part in communication, as do other factors such as the author's intentions, the relationship between the sender and receiver, and so forth. The second way of conceiving how thoughts are communicated is by the author/speaker only conveying as much information as is needed in any given context, so that the audience can recover their intended meaning from what was said/written as well as from the context and implications. In this conceptual model, the author takes into account the context of the communication and the mutual cognitive environment between the author and the audience. (That is what the author/speaker thinks that audience already knows.) They then say just enough to communicate what they intend ‚Äì relying on the audience to fill in the details that they did not explicitly communicate. This can be visualized as follows: :Speaker's thought/intention ¬± context-mediated information ‚áí encoded ‚áí transmitted ‚áí decoded ¬± context-mediated information ‚áí thought/intention understood by hearer (an interpretive resemblance to the speaker's intention) References Bibliography  * This is a useful overview of relevance theory.

The enlistment dates for officers and rank and file soldiers extended to 23 April 1775, based on their response to the alarm for the Battles of Lexington and Concord.Hammond, Vol 1, pp.80-106. The regiment saw action at the Battle of Bunker Hill, the Battles of Saratoga, and the Battle of Newtown. In addition, the 3rd participated in or was present at the Siege of Boston, the Invasion of Canada, Valley Forge, and Sullivan's Expedition.Wright, p.199. The 3rd Regiment was ordered disbanded on 1 January 1781, based on Congress prescribing a new arrangement for the Continental Army on 3 October 1780, that dictated there be just two regiments from New Hampshire, rather than three.Continental Congress Washington's general orders of 1 November 1780, conveyed this arrangement to the army.Washington's General Orders of Nov 1, 1780 The officers of the three New Hampshire regiments met and agreed on who would continue to serve and who would agreeably retire based on this new arrangement; this resulted in several officers from the 3rd Regiment continuing service by moving to the 1st or 2nd regiments.Hammond, vol XVI, page 182 3rd Regiment 1775-1776 Its first commander was Colonel James Reed. Companies were initially commanded by:Hammond, vol 1, page 38 Captains Force, series 4 vol 4 *Captain Josiah Crosby (1775 only) *Captain Jacob Hinds *Captain Hezekiah Hutchins (1775 only) *Captain Benjamin Mann *Captain John Marcy (1775 only) *Captain Robert Oliver (1776 only) *Captain David Place (1776 only) *Captain Levi Spaulding *Captain Philip Thomas (1775 only) *Captain Ezra Town (1776 only) *Captain William Walker (1775 only) *Captain James Wilkinson (1776 only) *Captain Jonathan Witcomb (1775 only) Under Reed, the regiment saw action on 17 June 1775, at the Battle of Bunker Hill, which is more properly known as the Battle of Breeds Hill. There they were on the field at two locations. The bulk of the regiment was at the rail fence positioned between John Stark's 1st New Hampshire Regiment which extended on the fence to the Mystic River and Thomas Knowlton's company of Connecticut militia. One company, under Josiah Crosby of Wilton, New Hampshire, was detached into Charlestown to snipe at the British Marines as they advanced on the redoubt where the bulk of the American forces were deployed.Frothingham page 40 Array of American forces for the Battle of Breeds Hill Crosby's company's actions (along with one other company) resulted in the British ships on the Charles River loading their cannon with hot grapeshot and burning Charlestown. The battle occurred in three phases, and the 3rd Regiment participated in the first two, which resulted in the decisive defeat of the right wing of the British Army under Major General William Howe. However, the New Hampshire regiments were nearly out of ammunition and could only pull back to Bunker Hill to watch the final phase of the battle play out and then cover the retreat of the Massachusetts soldiers as they escaped the redoubt after it had been finally overrun. On 1 Jan, 1776, the 3rd Regiment was redesignated as the 2d Continental Regiment and assigned to Sullivan's Brigade.Wright page 199 On 27 April 1776, the regiment was assigned to the Canadian Department and was sent to Canada via New York City and then Albany via the Hudson River under Major General John Sullivan during the Invasion of Canada campaign. As the regiment arrived in Canada they suffered through a smallpox epidemic. They made it as far as Montreal where they were from June 12‚Äì17 and are shown there on Major Alexander Scammell's Return of the Continental Forces in Canada. The return of Reeds Regiment, dated 21 April 1776, showed 518 officers, staff, and rank and file, and then on General Horatio Gates' return, dated 24 August 1775, there were only 409 men in the regiment, an unfortunately typical loss for regiments in the Canadian Department. The 3rd Regiment returned to Fort Ticonderoga on 16 July 1776, and were there until November 1776. The 3rd Regiment spent the late summer and fall of 1776 at Fort Ticonderoga. Reed's health was failing, and in November the state sent representatives who with the help of John Stark secured the re-enlistment of many New Hampshire officers and soldiers and re-formed the 1st and 2nd New Hampshire Regiments with those men, which included many from the 3rd Regiment.American Archives, Peter Force, Series 5, Vol 3, page 646 It is because of this that the 3rd Regiment is usually given credit for participating in the Battle of Trenton and the Battle of Princeton, though in reality these men had re-enlisted or had been reorganized into these new 1st and 2nd New Hampshire Regiments. The 1st New Hampshire Regiment was also known as the 5th Regiment of Foot and was commanded by John Stark, and the 2nd New Hampshire Regiment was also known as the 8th Regiment of Foot and was commanded by Enoch Poor. They left Fort Ticonderoga to join George Washington on November 16, 1776.American Archives, Peter Force, Series 5, Vol 3, pages 877, 1037, and 1038 In November 1776, what remained of the 3rd Regiment was not much more than a corps of invalids and men who had not re-enlisted and whose enlistments would expire by the end of the year‚Äîabout 250 in all. Those who did re-enlist in November were incorporated into the 1st and 2nd Regiments. The main army at Fort Ticonderoga marched south to join Washington on 16 and 17 November 1776; the 3rd left Fort Ticonderoga two days laterAmerican Archives, Peter Force, Series 5, Vol 3, pages 743-744 for Fort George, at the southern end of Lake George, where they were assigned until relieved by a New Hampshire militia call-up at the end of December when the majority of the men's enlistments ran out. In December 1776, Col. Alexander Scammell was commissioned to command the 3rd Regiment.American Archives, Peter Force, Series 5, Vol 3, page 1453 on 11 December 1776.MilHistOfNH, page 296 Some of the company commanders had been commissioned as of November 8, 1776, and were already in New Hampshire recruiting, and several more captains were added by March 1777 to complete the regiment and recruiting. The result was a new 3rd Regiment for 1777 with an experienced officer corps, but with newly recruited rank and file soldiers, some of whom had had experience in the Continental Army during the Siege of Boston in 1775. 3rd Regiment 1777-1781 Area of operations for the American and British armies, June‚ÄìOctober 1777 By 15 June 1777, the 3rd Regiment under Colonel Alexander Scammell was completed and present for duty at Fort Ticonderoga. The companies of the 3rd Regiment were commanded as follows:Hammond vol 15 page 458 *1st Company: Captain James Gray *2nd Company: Captain Zachariah Beal *3rd Company: Captain Michael Mcclary *4th Company: Captain Daniel Livermore *5th Company: Captain Richard Weare *6th Company: Captain Benjamin Stone *7th Company: Captain Isaac Frye *8th Company: Captain William Ellis The 3rd Regiment did not stay long at Fort Ticonderoga; the fort's commander, Arthur St. Clair, was forced to abandon the fort because British commander John Burgoyne's forces had taken control of nearby Mount Defiance, making it possible to easily cannonade Fort Ticonderoga. Thus, late on July 5, 1777, orders to leave Fort Ticonderoga were given, and by early morning on 6 July 1777 the 3rd Regiment was marching toward Hubbardton with the main portion of the American army under St. Clair's command. By 8 July 1777 they had reached Fort Edward, New York, and began a campaign of damming streams and felling trees to make the countryside as impassable as possible for the invading British Army. On 28 July 1777, the American Army moved to Fort Miller, then on 10 August 1777 to Stillwater, and on 18 August 1777 to Van Schaick Island at the confluence of the Mohawk and Hudson rivers. The American Army, now swelled by post-harvest militia, then began moving north, arriving at Bemis Heights to camp on 8 September 1777. Most of the summer was spent without proper camp and supplies such as tents, given the hasty retreat from Fort Ticonderoga. Under Scammell the 3rd regiment saw heated action at the Battles of Saratoga, as evidenced by the loss of several officers and many men.Hammond Vol 16 pages 7-44 It is remarkable, given the positioning of the 3rd Regiment on the battlefield at Freeman's Farm, that such an inexperienced unit was able to hold the middle of the field. The 3rd was also on the field, in the thick of the battle as part of Enoch Poor's brigade in the Battle of Bemis Heights. Deployment of units at the Battle of Freeman's Farm, 19 September 1777 Deployment of units on the field at the outset of the Battle of Bemis Heights Just two days after the battle, the regiment marched for Valley Forge, where they suffered through the winter. At Valley Forge, Colonel Scammell was chosen to join Washington's inner circle as the Army Adjutant General.Washington's General Orders of 13 January 1778 The de facto command of the 3rd Regiment fell to Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Dearborn. Under Dearborn the 3rd regiment was at the Battle of Monmouth, where some of its most soldierly men participated. The 3rd then wintered near Danbury, Connecticut. In 1779 the 3rd Regiment was assigned to the Sullivan Expedition, and saw heated action at the Battle of Newtown, again evidenced by the toll shown in their muster rolls. In 1780 the 3rd Regiment was garrisoned at West Point. On 1 Jan 1781, the 3rd New Hampshire Regiment was disbanded, based on the Commander in Chief's general orders of 1 Nov, 1780. The 1st and 2nd regiments were reorganized, incorporating all of the officers and rank and file from the 3rd Regiment who had time remaining on their enlistments. Alexander Scammell resigned the post of Adjutant General in 1781 and returned to command the 1st Regiment. Scammell was then given the honor of commanding a detachment of light infantry that also served as the vanguard of the American army that marched south to Yorktown in 1781.Washington's General Orders of May 17, 1781 References Bibliography   External links *Roster of 3rd New Hampshire officers *3rd New Hampshire Regiment 1776, a reenactment group *Bibliography of the Continental Army in New Hampshire, compiled by the United States Army Center of Military History *Officers of the 3rd NH Regiment who wintered at Valley Forge *Orderly books of the New Hampshire Regiments *Journal of Captain Daniel Livermore at USGenWeb Military units and formations established in 1775 New Hampshire regiments of the Continental Army ","title":"3rd New Hampshire Regiment"},{"id":"3541477","text":"Ocular hypertension is the presence of elevated fluid pressure inside the eye (intraocular pressure), usually with no optic nerve damage or visual field loss.American Academy of Ophthalmology American Optometric Association - Ocular Hypertension For most individuals, the normal range of intraocular pressure is between 10 mmHg and 21 mmHg.webMD - Tonometry Elevated intraocular pressure is an important risk factor for glaucoma. One study found that topical ocular hypotensive medication delays or prevents the onset of primary open-angle glaucoma. Accordingly, most individuals with consistently elevated intraocular pressures of greater than 21mmHg, particularly if they have other risk factors, are treated in an effort to prevent vision loss from glaucoma. Pathophysiology The pressure within the eye is maintained by the balance between the fluid that enters the eye through the ciliary body and the fluid that exits the eye through the trabecular meshwork. Diagnosis The condition is diagnosed using ocular tonometry and glaucoma evaluation. Increased IOP without glaucomatous changes (in optic disc or visual field) is considered as ocular hypertension. Treatment Ocular hypertension is treated with either medications or laser. Medications that lower intraocular pressure work by decreasing aqueous humor production and/or increasing aqueous humor outflow. Laser trabeculoplasty works by increasing outflow. The cannabinoids found in cannabis sativa and indica (marijuana) have been shown to reduce intraocular pressure, by up to 50% for approximately four to five hours. But due to the duration of effect, significant side-effect profile, and lack of research proving efficacy, the American Glaucoma Society issued a position statement in 2009 regarding the use of marijuana as a treatment for glaucoma.

Early life He was born in Edinburgh, the second son of architect Sir Robert Lorimer. He was educated at Loretto School in Musselburgh, then at Magdalen College, Oxford University, but he left Oxford prematurely to study design and sculpture under Alexander Carrick at the Edinburgh College of Art. After graduating in 1934, he entered an apprenticeship with sculptor and stonemason Eric Gill. Sculptor The font at St Machar's Cathedral by Hew Lorimer Lorimer was principally an architectural sculptor, and his profound religious beliefs had a lasting effect on his art and subject matter. After World War II, he worked on many grand sculptures, including Our Lady of the Isles, 1958, a massive granite statue of the mother and child sited at Rueval on South Uist. Between 1950 and 1955 he also sculpted the artwork adorning the facade of the National Library of Scotland in Edinburgh, for which he produced a series of tall, allegorical figures, depicting history, law, medicine, music, poetry, science and theology. The architect of the library was Reginald Fairlie, who had been apprentice to Lorimer's father Robert. Lorimer carved the figures directly into the stone rather than copying from clay models, a practice known as direct carving.

Mewata is a Cree word meaning \\"O Be Joyful\\". The building was built between 1915 and 1918 for an original cost of CA$282,051 (). The building was designed by Thomas W. Fuller (Department of Public Works Architect) and the project was supervised locally by Calgary architect Leo Dowler. The structure was actually built by A. G. Creelman Co. of Vancouver, British Columbia. The building is located at 801 11th Street S.W. and is still home to local Militia Units, chiefly The King's Own Calgary Regiment (RCAC) and The Calgary Highlanders, but also 15 (Edmonton) Field Ambulance Detachment Calgary, the 41 Canadian Brigade Group Influence Activities Company (attached to The King's Own Calgary Regiment (RCAC)) and various cadet organizations. History Prior to the construction of the Mewata Armoury, Calgary had minimal military infrastructure in place. A modest two-storey drill hall was opened on 12th Avenue SW in January 1904, the facility was purchased using private funds. In the late 1900s, Calgary City Council passed a motion offering the five lots (hospital site) to the federal government free of charge for the construction of a suitable facility, however, the offer did not materialize. When Lieutenant-Colonel E. A. Cruikshank approached City Council again in 1910 for the hospital site, city officials suggested alternative sites. The 1911 Canadian federal election, the previous Liberal government under Wilfrid Laurier was toppled by Robert Borden's Conservative Party. Sam Hughes was appointed Minister of Militia and Defence and together Borden and Hughes sought to expand the role and prominence of militias in Canada. By December 1911, Borden had won over Hughes and Frederick Debartzch Monk Minister of Public Works to fund a $250,000 \\"Western Armoury\\". In January 1912, Hughes would announce in Parliament \\"towns making offers of valuable sites were most likely to receive favorable consideration of the government.\\" The City of Calgary's land offer would be valued at approximately $100,000, and in June 1912, the federal government approved $50,000 for the Calgary project. Mewata Park, originally a federal reserve which was transferred to the City of Calgary as a park in 1906 was chosen for the site. The area was between the city's downtown and growing residential neighbourhoods. Calgary officials expected the federal government to transfer the military's old Calgary Rifle Range in exchange for the Mewata land, however despite correspondence from the city to Borden about the trade, Borden did not press the issue in Ottawa. In 1913, Borden wrote the city, pressing the issue of the federal government obtaining the Mewata Park land stating: By 1913 the Mewata Park land had become a civic issue in Calgary, opposed by labour groups which had previously seen the federal government use militia to crush strikes in Cape Breton and Vancouver Island. Calgary Mayor Herbert Arthur Sinnott was reluctant to give away the Mewata Park land, but still sought the construction of an armory. Compounding the issue was the 1902 Crown grant for the Mewata land which stipulated the property would be used for \\"purposes of a public park and for no other purpose\\". Eventually Calgary City Council would pass a motion for administration to transfer the Mewata land to the federal government, which was strongly opposed by many Calgarians, and the City requested the Legislative Assembly pass a private bill for the purpose of enabling the transfer which was overwhelming defeated by the majority Liberal provincial government. Eventually a plebiscite was held alongside the 1913 Calgary municipal election in which the electorate was asked whether to transfer \\"a small portion of Mewata Park of approximately 90,000 square feet\\", in which more than 70% of ratepayers voted in favor of transferring the land. Bennett would later respond to Sinnott and the plebiscite noting the total area provided was approximately 10,000 square feet too small, Bennett would propose a solution where the city would transfer the full property as requested and the federal government would issue an Order in Council absolving the city of any liability in regards to the letters patent. Construction began September 24, 1915 and according to some sources was held up by lack of bricks. Two brick factories, one in Redcliff and one in Montgomery were built for the specific purpose of providing the bricks to complete the project. The building was completed in 1917. During the Second World War, several wooden huts were built to accommodate the large number of Calgary soldiers mobilized for the Canadian Active Service Force. In 1939, a large recreation hall was built adjacent to the armouries but the hall burnt down in 1941. The armoury for a time was home to a Permanent Force squadron of Lord Strathcona's Horse, but is most commonly associated with the Militia units in Calgary. Over the years, several units have been based at Mewata including South Alberta Light Horse, 19th Alberta Dragoons, King's Own Calgary Regiment, the Calgary Highlanders, and 746 Communications Squadron. During the First World War, Mewata was used as an induction and training centre and a demobilization depot for returning soldiers. In addition to military uses, other groups and organizations have always used the armoury including a military ball for the Prince of Wales in 1919, the scene of a verbal confrontation between William Aberhart and Major C. H. Douglas founder of Social Credit. The Calgary Police Service and Calgary Fire Department have often used it for training purposes. In 1975, prior to the 63rd Grey Cup parade, twenty marching bands were marshalled in the drill hall. =Construction materials= The building has a cut stone foundation with a structure of red brick (common bond with steel reinforcement) and sandstone. The drill hall is significant for the large uninterrupted span of its steel trusses. A second story on the west side was added some time after original construction. =Architectural style= The building was designed in a Tudor/Gothic Revival style. A classic example of armoury design, Mewata has features deliberately bringing to mind a medieval fortress or castle, including four square corner towers, four smaller six sided towers, and buttresses with turrets and a crenellated roofline. =Original interior details= The original design featured a large central drill hall with 117 rooms (two storeys of soldiers quarters) arranged around its perimeter. The basement included bowling alleys and 30 yard shooting ranges. The facility also included officers' and sergeants' billiard rooms. Barracks have been altered in recent years to serve as offices and storage space. A catwalk around the drill hall has been enclosed on the north and south sides, as well as part of the east side, leaving a short \\"balcony\\" overlooking the parade square. Heritage Status Battery Bridge Monument On November 11, 1979 the Government of Alberta designated the Mewata Armoury a Provincial Historical Resource, referencing the sites historical significance in providing training facilities for the Dominion Government's armed forces following 1900, and the structure's long-term purpose which did not arise from a specific military emergency. The Minister of Culture Mary LeMessurier and Member of the Legislative Assembly for Calgary-McCall Andy Little announced the Provincial Historical Designation during the Royal Canadian Legion's Remembrance Day ceremonies at the Southern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium. On November 14, 1984 the Government of Canada recognized the Mewata Armoury as a Federal Heritage Building under Treasury Board Heritage Buildings Policy. The recognition referenced the structures significance due to its historical associations with the Canadian government's late-19th century initiatives to build and maintain militia practice and training areas in urban locations, the building's role in housing militia and permanent forces during inter-war periods, and the substantial role the building played in training efforts for the Second World War. Additionally the Tudor Gothic architectural style, and landmark status in downtown Calgary contributed to the building's significance. On June 22, 1989 the Government of Canada designated the structure and area a National Historic Site of Canada under the name \\"Mewata Drill Hall / Calgary Drill Hall National Historic Site of Canada\\". The designation referenced the site's representation of the third phase of drill hall construction in Canada during 1896 to 1918, the scale and bold design of the armoury following the South African War, and the armoury's role as home of King's Own Calgary Regiment and The Calgary Highlanders. The Mewata Armoury was only the fourth site in Calgary to receive the National Historic Site of Canada designation, following Fort Calgary in 1925, Calgary City Hall in 1984, and Heritage Hall in 1987.Prairie Fire (Prairie Militia Area Training Bulletin) Oct. 1991 (Final Edition). =Plaque= The Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada plaque at the Mewata Armouries states: Lodger units King's Own Calgary Regiment soldiers on parade at Mewata Armoury, 2005.

Monuments Calgary Highlanders Monument.The Calgary Highlanders erected and dedicated a Regimental Monument in front of Mewata Armoury in 1998. The monument takes the form of a Universal Carrier, of the type used by the regiment in the Second World War, painted in the markings of the 1st Battalion. A plaque dedicates the memorial to all soldiers of the regiment and its predecessors who have \\"Served Canada in War and Peace.\\" Regimental Markings included a gold maple leaf on Royal Blue, indicating the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, and a green square indicating the 5th Brigade, upon which was placed the Unit Sign \\"62\\" in white. Plaque.Lieutenant Brian S. King, CD, Curator of the Regimental Museum, received permission from 41 Canadian Brigade Group to place a vehicle in front of Mewata Armoury, after discussions in the Museum in 1997. This form of homage is common in other armouries and military bases across Canada. Lieutenant King sought out collectors in order to obtain an appropriate vehicle, and negotiations with the Canadian War Museum yielded this fully restored carrier, from the collection of Jack Guthrie, a notable Calgary vehicle collector. The concrete pad for the carrier was donated by BURNCO and the plaque purchased by the Regimental Funds Foundation through a grant from the Royal Alberta United Services Institute. The markings were researched and painted by Corporal Michael Dorosh, at that time a clerk with battalion headquarters. The plaque was unveiled by Second World War veterans Sergeant Clarence \\"Ken\\" Crockett, DCM and Lance Corporal Floyd Rourke, DCM. A second monument was later erected in celebration of 100 years of military engineering in Canada. An M4A2E8 Sherman tank displaying the wartime markings of The King's Own Calgary Regiment including the formation sign of the 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade was placed atop a Bailey bridge bearing a plaque dedicated by 33rd Field Engineer Squadron. The KOCR mobilized a tank regiment which served with the brigade at Dieppe and in Italy from 1941 to 1945.

Comparison of a generic \\"true\\" stone arch (left) and a corbel arch (right). A corbel arch (or corbeled / corbelled arch) is an arch-like construction method that uses the architectural technique of corbeling to span a space or void in a structure, such as an entranceway in a wall or as the span of a bridge. A corbel vault uses this technique to support the superstructure of a building's roof. A corbel arch is constructed by offsetting successive courses of stone (or brick) at the springline of the walls so that they project towards the archway's center from each supporting side, until the courses meet at the apex of the archway (often, the last gap is bridged with a flat stone). For a corbeled vault covering, the technique is extended in three dimensions along the lengths of two opposing walls. Royal Palace of Ugarit, Bronze Age Syria. Although an improvement in load-bearing efficiency over the post and lintel design, corbeled arches are not entirely self-supporting structures, and the corbeled arch is sometimes termed a false arch for this reason. Different from \\"true\\" arches, \\"false\\" or corbelled arches are built of horizontally laid stones or bricks, not of wedge-shaped voussoirs converging towards, and being held together by a central keystone. Unlike \\"true\\" arches, not all of the structure's tensile stresses caused by the weight of the superstructure are transformed into compressive stresses. Corbel arches and vaults require significantly thickened walls and an abutment of other stone or fill to counteract the effects of gravity, which otherwise would tend to collapse each side of the archway inwards. Some arches use a stepped style, keeping the block faces rectangular, while other form or select them to give the arch smooth edges, usually with a pointed shape. Use in historical cultures Corbelling is a technique first applied by the ancient Egyptians and Chaldeans.Nakassis(2000), p. 364 =Ireland= The Newgrange passage tomb, built sometime between 3200 and 2500 BC during the Neolithic period, has an intact corbel arch (vault) supporting the roof of the main chamber. The medieval buildings of the monastery at Skellig Michael are also constructed using this method. =Ancient Egypt= During the Fourth Dynasty reign of Pharaoh Sneferu (c. 2600 BC), the Ancient Egyptian pyramids used corbel vaults in some of their chambers. These monuments include the Meidum Pyramid (around 2600 BC), the Bent Pyramid (c. 2600 BC) and its satellite pyramid, and the Red Pyramid (c. 2590 BC). The Great Pyramid of Giza (c. 2580‚Äì2560 BC) uses corbel arches at the Grand Gallery. The Egyptians discovered the principle of the true arch early on, but continued to use the corbel arch in many buildings, sometimes mixing the two in the same building. In particular they avoided the true arch in temples as long as these were constructed,Wilkinson, John Gardner, The Architecture of Ancient Egypt; ... with Remarks on the Early Progress of Architecture, Etc, 1850, Internet Archive preferring rectangular openings with a straight lintel. =Ancient Mediterranean (Near East, Europe)= Corbel arches and vaults are found in various places around the ancient Mediterranean. In particular, corbelled burial vaults constructed below the floor are found in Middle Bronze II-III Ebla in Syria, and in Tell el-Ajjul, Hazor, Megiddo and Ta'anach in Canaan (today's Israel and Palestine).Suzanne Richard (2003), Near Eastern Archaeology: A Reader. Ugarit also has corbelled structures. Nuraghe constructions in ancient Sardinia, dating back to the 18th century BC, use similar corbel techniques. The use of beehive tombs on the Iberian peninsula and elsewhere around the Mediterranean, going back to 3000 BC, is also similar. Hittites (Anatolia) Corbelled chamber with hieroglyphs in Hattusa The Hittites in ancient Anatolia were also building corbelled vaults. The earliest ones date to the 16th century BC. Some similarities are found between the Hittite and Mycenaean construction techniques. Yet the Hittite corbelled vaults are earlier by about 300 years.√á. Maner (2012), Corbelled Vaults in Hittite and Mycenaean Fortification Architecture Greece (Mycenaean, Classical, Hellenistic) The Treasury of Atreus at Mycenae Greece has a long list of surviving or archaeologically studied corbelled arches and vaults used for bridges and a multitude of other structures, dating from the Mycenean and Minoan, the late Classical, and the Hellenistic periods.Nakassis(2000), pp. 363‚Äì364 The ruins of ancient Mycenae feature many corbel arches and vaults, the Treasury of Atreus, built around 1250 BC, being a prominent example. The Arkadiko Bridge is one of four Mycenean corbel arch bridges, which are part of a former network of roads, designed to accommodate chariots, between Tiryns and Epidauros in the Peloponnese, in Greece. Dating to the Greek Bronze Age (13th century BC), it is one of the oldest arch bridges still in existence and use. The well- preserved Hellenistic Eleutherna Bridge on Crete has an unusually large span of nearly 4 metres. A second nearby bridge, which had survived until the late 19th century, is tentatively dated to the late Classical period. =Maya civilization= Maya corbel arch at Cahal Pech. Corbeled arches are a distinctive feature of certain pre-Columbian Mesoamerican constructions and historical/regional architectural styles, particularly in that of the Maya civilization. The prevalence of this spanning technique for entrances and vaults in Maya architecture is attested at a great many Maya archaeological sites, and is known from structures dating back to the Formative or Preclassic era. By the beginning of the Classic era (ca. 250 CE) corbeled vaults are a near-universal feature of building construction in the central Pet√©n Basin region of the central Maya lowlands.Coe (1987), p.65. =India= A corbelled arch at the tomb of Nasir ud din Mahmud, Ghori, New Delhi Before the true arch was introduced in Indo-Islamic architecture, almost all the arches in Indian buildings were either trabeated or corbelled. In North India in the state of Orissa, \\"the later temples at Bhubaneswar were built on the principle of corbelled vaulting, which is seen first in the porch of the Mukteswar [a temple said to epitomize North Indian architecture, circa AD 950] and, technically speaking, no fundamental change occurred from this time onwards.\\"Michael Edwardes, Indian Temples and Palaces, London: Hamlyn, 1969, p. 95. The earliest large buildings of the Delhi Sultanate established in 1206 after a Muslim invasion used Indian workers used to Hindu temple architecture, but the patrons were used to Central Asian styles that used true arches heavily. Corbel arches, the largest of exceptional size, were used in the massive screens in front of the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque in Delhi, begun in 1193, and the Adhai Din Ka Jhonpra mosque, Ajmer, Rajasthan, c. 1229. These are examples of Islamic architecture drawing on Persia and Central Asia, where builders were well used to the true arch, that stick with the corbelled arch that Indian builders were used to.Harle, 421-425 It took almost a century from the start of the Delhi Sultanate in 1206 for the true arch to appear. By around 1300 true domes and arches with voussoirs were being built; the ruined Tomb of Balban (d. 1287) in the Qutb complex in Delhi may be the earliest survival.Harle, 425 =Indonesia= The candi or temples of Indonesia which were constructed between 8th to 15th century, made use of corbel arch technique to create a span opening for gate or inner chamber of the temple. The notable example of corbel arch in Indonesian classic temple architecture are the arches of Borobudur. The interlocking andesite stone blocks creating the corbel arch, are notable for their \\"T\\" formed lock on the center top of the corbel arch. =Cambodia= All the temples in Angkor made use of the corbel arch, between the AD 9th and 12th centuries.

Early life Simon Arnauld was born in Paris in 1618. He was son of Robert Arnauld d'Andilly, governor of Monsieur and \\"intendant d'arm√©e\\" under Richelieu, and of Catherine Le Fevre de la Boderie. Member of the famous jansenist family Arnauld (his siblings were Antoine Arnauld and Ang√©lique de Saint-Jean Arnauld d'Andilly), he was named Simon Arnauld de Briottes till 1643, then Simon Arnauld d'Andilly from 1643 to 1660, and eventually Simon Arnauld de Pomponne, after the estate of Pomponne, which was led to him by his mother, when he got married in 1660. After having been taught by Martin Barcos, he entered the world of the \\"pr√©cieuses\\", attending the salon of Mme de Rambouillet, with several members of his family. He wrote a number of poems for the \\"Guirlande de Julie\\", and was a friend of important writers, such as Marie de Rabutin-Chantal, marquise de S√©vign√©, Marie-Madeleine Pioche de la Vergne, comtesse de la Fayette, and the duke Fran√ßois de La Rochefoucauld. Early career He began his career as an intendant of the French garrison in Casale, where he staid from 1642 to 1647. Then, supported by Mazarin and Michel Le Tellier, he was appointed \\"intendant d'arm√©e\\" in Italy, in Paris during the Fronde, and in Catalonia. He first acted as a diplomat in 1655, having to negotiate and sign a treaty with the Duke of Mantua, a mission he was to achieve outstandingly. However, as Jansenism began to widespread, his uncle Antoine Arnauld became one of its leaders, and his own father decided to retire in Port-Royal-des-Champs. In 1658, Mazarin thus refused to let him become chancellor of Monsieur, Louis XIV's own brother. Worse, Pomponne turned to be both a client and a friend of Nicolas Fouquet and married one of his cousins, which caused his exiles in Verdun, in eastern France (1662-1664), then to his estate of Pomponne (1664-1665).  Diplomat  Though he was allowed back to Paris by the King only in 1665, his friendships with Michel Le Tellier, Le Pelletier and Hugues de Lionne enabled him to be promoted as ambassador to Sweden. His part was to prevent it from entering the Triple Alliance (1665-1668). Even if Sweden strengthened its links with the United Provinces, Pomponne gave the King complete satisfaction and so was entrusted a new mission, this time in the United Provinces (1668-1671). In 1671, however, he was recalled to Sweden for the delicate mission of forging a new alliance between Sweden and France. Therefore, the United Provinces were isolated on the diplomatic scale and could be attacked by Louis XIV. After Hugues de Lionne, Secretary of State for Foreign affairs, died in September 1671, Simon Arnauld de Pomponne was brought to the board of which he remained in charge until 1679. His style is one of a real diplomat, trying to find agreements with other countries in wartime, and Louvois, Secretary of State for War, was more aggressive and keen to fight. In 1673 to 1675, when the ardently-Catholic English courtier Edward Colman asked the French Government for large sums of money to persuade King Charles II to pursue a pro-French policy, Pomponne showed his strong common sense by telling his own King firmly that Charles' support was not worth bidding for. While Pomponne managed to obtain the Treaty of Nijmegen (1678), he was eventually dismissed at a time since Louis wanted to conduct a more warlike foreign policy (18 November 1679). Later life However, Louis remained favourable to him since his estate of Pomponne became a marquisate in 1682, and his sons were offered a regiment and an important abbey. The King called him back in 1691 (as a member of the Conseil d'en haut but without the charge of a specific board), right after Louvois's death and fostered the marriage of the son of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the marquis de Torcy, with Pomponne's daughter. Pomponne still played an important role in French policy in the 1690s. He died in Fontainebleau in 1699.

It generally consists of an engine, drums, and spar, but has a range of configurations and variations such as the swing yarder. Clyde Skidder at Marathon Logging Camp near Newton, MS ~1921Madill 124 Yarder. An example of modern yarders still being used in logging industry. Early Yarders The early yarders were steam powered. They traveled on railroads, known as \\"dummylines\\" and the felled trees were dragged or \\"skidded\\" to the railroad where they were later loaded onto rail cars. Popular brands were: Willamette, Skagit, Washington, Tyee, or Lidgerwood and Clyde built by Clyde Ironworks in Duluth, Minnesota. Although these machines appear to be large and cumbersome, they were true workhorses of their day. The Clyde was capable of retrieving logs from four different points at the same time. Each cable, or lead, was approximately 1000 feet in length. Once the logs were attached and a clearance signal was sent for retrieval, they could be skidded at a speed of 1000 feet per minute (1MPH = 88 fpm = 26.8 meter per minute) this is around 10 mph. Working conditions around these machines were very dangerous. After the logs were hauled to the landing, a separate machine called a loader, loaded them with tongs or heel-booms onto rail cars or diesel engine trucks. Loaders were sometimes called duplexes as they had two steam engines to control the tongs. A large machine with a yarder and loader combined is called a unit. In the 1950s steam engines were replaced by diesel engine, and war-surplus tank chassis, which provided a frame for the new yarders, now that rail mounted ones were obsolete. Modern Cable Logging Cable logging used primarily on the U.S. west coast uses a yarder, loaders and grapple yarders.

Labour activists from the Co-operative Union along with the Labour Party set up the relief effort. Background Whilst the Conservative government of Neville Chamberlain preserved official neutrality in its dealings with Spain following the 1936 military uprising, the civilian population of the Republic suffered terrible hardships in the winters that followed. The bombings and battles caught the attention of the media, but hunger and disease spread as supplies became difficult to obtain, with the coastlines being cut off from the Republican strongholds in the north and south of Spain. As refugees congregating upon Catalonia and Valencia swelled the population of these cities by twice their normal size, the refugee homes often went for three days without a meal. No milk was being supplied without a certificate. The hunt for food led to some attempting to eat edible herbs and grass. Many of the children were left to sleep all day by their families to reduce the awareness of starvation. In these conditions, one in three refugee children became affected by tuberculosis. This was soon to amount to tens of thousands of consumptive children. Relief programme In November 1937 a Milk for Spain fund was opened after an appeal to the various co-operative societies and Labour Party branches around the country. The response was overwhelming. The London Co-op raised ¬£877 alone. In addition to large contributions from societies, anybody who shopped at a Co-op store was able to buy milk tokens; the proceeds of which would go to the Republican civilians. In particular, the milk was directed at children of under four years old and invalids. As the rate of donations from the societies gradually subsided, the selling of six-penny and three-penny tokens in shops assumed growing importance. A major problem was how to deliver the supplies. The first delivery ship had a hazardous journey, with many delays. Deliveries by road were slowed by the difficult logistics involved in contracting lorries in France. Rail was probably the most reliable form of supply. All three methods were used; with no consignment ever going astray. The Co-operative Wholesale Society's Export Department lent its assistance to ensure the safe delivery of all consignments. The first consignment of CWS powdered and condensed milk, over 7,000 cases, arrived in early 1938. These were sent to distribution centres under strict supervision of the Milk for Spain Committee. From here, the milk was distributed through maternity hospitals, food kitchens and rations. By March 1938, co-operators had raised over ¬£9,000, the Labour Party over ¬£5,100. The Municipal Clinic in Madrid, the Catalonia region and Barcelona all benefited, as the insurgents made gains across the country. The Co-operative Union often spent the money before it had arrived, realising the urgency of the situation, and sent out a second appeal to co-ops in July 1938. A second wave of leaflets and posters were produced. A quickening in the rate of donations enabled Milk Canteens to be set up in elementary schools in Barcelona. The breakdown of the Front in Catalonia exacerbated transport difficulties still further, but with the assistance of the International Federation of Trade Unions, supplies were maintained by sea until the final capitulation of the Republic. By May 1939, more than ¬£32,500 had been raised to alleviate the suffering of the Spanish people at the hands of insurgents and the Axis Powers. Much of this money had come from people in deprived areas, and a retailer struggling with recession. More than 4,000 Basque children had been brought to Britain and adopted. The remainder of the money was directed towards Spanish emigrants who had fled to refugee camps around Europe.

The Rolling Stones were its house band in its first year and were followed by The Yardbirds. Several other notable British blues and rhythm and blues acts also played there. History Giorgio Gomelsky was a Georgian √©migr√© who worked as an assistant film editor by day and a music promoter by night. He began in the jazz scene before starting the Piccadilly Club, a blues club in central London. When that closed in early 1963 he needed a new venue and, since he knew the landlord of the Station Hotel in suburban Richmond, he took over the back room, which had been little used since its jazz sessions had petered out. The name of the club derived from Bo Diddley's 1960 song \\"Doing the Craw-Daddy\\", which The Rolling Stones regularly performed as part of their set. In turn the club would inspire the name of the American music magazine Crawdaddy! Gomelsky's first house band was the Dave Hunt Rhythm & Blues Band whom he knew from the Piccadilly. Sometimes they used a young drummer called Charlie Watts, and for about six weeks in January-February 1963 their guitarist was Ray Davies, who later formed The Kinks. The Rolling Stones played their first gig at the Crawdaddy in February 1963, because the Dave Hunt band were snowed in during the coldest winter since 1740. Although the Stones had played their first gig the previous summer, Bill Wyman did not become a member until 7 December 1962, and Charlie Watts joined in January 1963, so the Crawdaddy saw the first public performance with them in the band. This first gig was not a commercial success; Gomelsky had to plead with customers of the main hotel to attend, offering two entries for the price of one ticket. Within three weeks word had spread and the Stones took over the residency; by April they had two gigs a week at the Crawdaddy and a weekly slot at Eel Pie Island, away in Twickenham. The Beatles came to see them on 14 April 1963, and afterwards went back to Mick Jagger's flat in Chelsea. Audiences overflowed onto the street, and the Crawdaddy was forced to move up the road to a larger venue, the Richmond Athletic Ground. During that time, the Stones had their first chart hit, a cover of Chuck Berry's \\"Come On\\". When the Stones became too big for small local clubs and went on tour, their residency at the Crawdaddy was taken over by another leading R&B; group from nearby Kingston upon Thames, The Yardbirds, featuring Eric Clapton. Other artists who played at the club included Led Zeppelin, Long John Baldry, Elton John and Rod Stewart. The Crawdaddy Club also ran events at the same time at The Star Public House in Broad Green, Croydon. The main band was The Yardbirds, but other bands from the Richmond Crawdaddy would visit and play. It hosted a lot of American R&B; artists who would jam with them, including Sonny Boy Williamson. The Animals would also visit after a gigs at The Orchid, Purley, and would enjoy a pint at the bar. Julie Driscoll started her singing career there after being dared to get up and sing. In March 2011, the Crawdaddy Club was revived at the Athletic Ground by Mike Rivers and his wife Sylvie. Gigs hace been held on a monthly basis, and feature top R&B; bands, including The Others, who were the third house band at the original club after The Rolling Stones and The Yardbirds.http://www.crawdaddyclubrichmond.com/about-the-venue.html The Station Hotel has gone through several incarnations, most recently as the \\"Bull & Bush\\" pub and as \\"One Kew Road\\" restaurant.

As the chairman of the United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense in the 1980s, he was a noted critic of President Ronald Reagan's massive defense spending increases. Addabbo was born in Queens, New York and lived in the borough his entire life. He was a 1946 graduate of St. John's Law School and practiced law in Ozone Park, New York before his election to Congress in 1960. Addabbo was the Democratic nominee to replace Queens Rep. Albert H. Bosch, a Republican who left Congress to begin a judicial career. Defense spending critic Addabbo became chairman of the defense spending subcommittee in 1979. In the post, he frequently sparred with President Reagan and was a favorite media source for accounts of the epic military spending battles in the early 1980s. Addabbo created a yearly routine of calling for deep cuts to the administration's budget. In 1983, he proposed slashing Reagan's defense spending plan by $30 billion. Though Addabbo's efforts were usually unsuccessful, he managed to eliminate funding for MX and Pershing II missiles in 1982. Final campaigns and death Although he usually sailed to reelection in his overwhelmingly Democratic and Italian- American Southwestern Queens district, a reapportionment following the 1980 census spelled trouble for Addabbo in his final two campaigns. His district absorbed a considerably larger number of African Americans in Jamaica, Queens than had previously been in the district. His old district was 35 percent black, while his new district was 65 percent black. Some of his Italian- American base were moved into the district of fellow Democrat Charles Schumer while others were moved into the district of fellow Italian-American Democrat Geraldine Ferraro, who had won a closer-than-expected election two years earlier. This left him open to a surprisingly strong primary challenge from black real estate developer Simeon Golar in 1982. Two years later, Golar ran again with the active backing of then-presidential candidate Jesse Jackson, but Addabbo won again. Addabbo's health started to fail shortly after his 1984 re-election. In 1985, he spent four months in the Walter Reed Army Medical Center with a cancer-related kidney ailment. After returning to work for two months in early 1986, he fell ill at a luncheon in March and lapsed into a coma on March 12. He died a month later, aged 61, and was buried in Saint John's Cemetery, Queens. After Addabbo's death, Queens elected its first African-American congressman after a disputed special election between two black candidates. In 2001, Addabbo's son, Joseph P. Addabbo Jr., was elected as the New York City Council representative for District 32 in Queens. He was elected to the New York State Senate in 2008.

With respect to \\"split\\" keyboards, quality studies that demonstrate injury reductions are lacking, with the exception of physically split keyboards which have \\"sharply angled keyboard faces\\". There is evidence, however, that such keyboards are not well tolerated. Narrow studies examining hand position at rest neglects many other possible factors.

The workshops cover topics including supporting literacy and math skills at home, understanding child and adolescent development and navigating the middle and high school applications process. The program aims to help increase parent knowledge about the public school system and learning standards and to develop strategies for effectively supporting their children's education. Bringing Community and Family Resources to Schools Learning Leaders divides its volunteer programs into two main models: the Core Program and the Enrichment Programs. The Core Program recruits and trains community and family volunteers to provide students with one-on-one tutoring in reading, writing, ESL, math and other academic subjects at the elementary and middle school levels, as well as non-instructional support such as general office and library assistance. Through Learning Leaders‚Äô Enrichment Programs, volunteers supplement students‚Äô education beyond core academic support. These programs, which include BookTalk and Book Buddies, promote a lifelong love of reading and literature, encourage students to discuss and think critically and develop confidence and communication skills.

Blomberg was born in Ratisbon (modern Germany), the eldest daughter of Wolfgang Plumberger or Blomberg, a burgher, and of his wife Sibilla Lohman. A singer, in 1546 she was for a short time the mistress of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, who was in Regensburg for the meeting of the Imperial Diet. On 24 February 1547 Blomberg gave birth to John of Austria, who was almost immediately taken from her and sent to be raised in Spain. Shortly afterwards Blomberg married Hieronymus Kegel, an imperial official. In 1551 she moved to Brussels with her husband where Kegel was responsible for the equipment of the imperial mercenary army. They had three children. When Kegel died in 1569, Blomberg and her children were in reduced financial circumstances. At the request of the governor of the Netherlands, the Duke of Alba, she was granted a pension by King Philip II of Spain (her oldest son's agnate half-brother). In November 1576 Blomberg met her son John of Austria for the only time since his birth. Subsequently, she went into a Dominican convent in Castile, 70 km south of Valladolid. After John of Austria died in 1578, Philip II allowed her to choose her own residence. She established herself first in the village of Colindres. In 1584 she purchased an estate in the village of Ambrosero in Cantabria. Blomberg died at the age of seventy at her estate in Ambrosero.

Frank Baum.Patrick M. Maund, \\"Bibliographia Baumiana: Dot and Tot of Merryland,\\" The Baum Bugle, Vol. 32 No. 3 (Winter 1988).Barbara S. Koelle, \\"Dot and Tot of Merryland: An Appreciation\\", The Baum Bugle, Vol. 45 No. 1 (Spring 2001). After Baum wrote The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, he wrote this story about the adventures of a little girl named Dot and a little boy named Tot in a land reached by floating on a river that flowed through a tunnel. The land was called Merryland and was split into seven valleys. The book was illustrated by artist W. W. Denslow, who had illustrated three previous Baum books. Unlike The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Dot and Tot of Merryland contained no tipped in color plates, but was filled with colored text illustrations. There were four full page pictures. The book is the last Baum book that was illustrated by W. W. Denslow. Dot and Tot of Merryland was first published by the Geo. M. Hill company of Chicago in 1901. Books of Wonder reprinted Dot and Tot of Merryland with minor text alterations and new illustrations by Donald Abbott. The reprint contains no color illustrations, but Mr. Abbott styled his after the Denslow illustrations. Although Baum and Denslow were hoping for another hit after the popularity of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, it met with very little commercial success. Plot Evangeline \\"Dot\\" Freeland is sent to her rich father's country estate Roselawn for her health. She soon meets the gardener's son \\"Tot\\" Thompson, who becomes her friend and playmate. One day, they have a picnic and sit in a boat they find by the river, which gets away and takes them to a passage in a cliff face that brings them to the magical country of Merryland. Merryland is made of seven valleys, arranged in a circular pattern connected by a river running through them. The first valley is populated by clowns, the second is a land in which everything‚Äîincluding the people‚Äîis entirely made of candy, and the third the valley where babies grow from blossoms before storks deliver them to their parents. The fourth valley is populated by living dolls and is also the home of the Queen of Merryland, a large wax doll who makes Dot and Tot her adopted children. After Dot and Tot have a day of running the valley by themselves, the queen joins Dot and Tot to see the remaining three valleys. The fifth valley is populated entirely by cats, the sixth valley is run by Mr. Split, who makes wind up animals. The final valley is the Valley of Lost Things, where every lost item goes. Tot finds a doll he'd lost and is allowed to take it with him. The Queen decides to allow Dot and Tot to travel onward, which will take them back to Roselawn, but she will close the way to Merryland forever. Returning to the river, Dot is found by her father who notices that she no longer looks sickly. Tot deduces that the Queen of Merryland‚Äîwho was either interrupted or forgot to answer when asked her name‚Äîmust be named \\"Dolly.\\" Legacy The book was adapted into a musical by Jennifer Kirkeby with music and lyrics by Michael Pretasky for the Stages Theater Company, debuting July 11, 2003 in Hopkins, Minnesota.Dot and Tot of Merryland: Based on the Book by L. Frank Baum, Script Book from the Dramatic Publishing Compant The Candy Man from the second valley and the Queen of Merryland attend Ozma's birthday party in L. Frank Baum's 1909 book The Road to Oz. Baum's map of the surrounding countries of Oz‚Äîfirst seen as an endpaper in Tik-Tok of Oz (1913)‚Äîdepicts Merryland as being across the desert from the Land of Oz and north of Hiland and Loland.

Furie and starring Frank Sinatra, Peter Vaughan and Edward Fox. It was the last film Sinatra made with Warner Bros., and is largely viewed as being a disastrous end to his association with the studio. Plot Sam Laker (Sinatra) is a former World War II Office of Strategic Services (OSS) operative who is recruited by his former commanding officer to do a mission whilst he attends a business conference in Leipzig. To ensure his cooperation, his son is kidnapped. Cast * Frank Sinatra ... Sam Laker * Peter Vaughan ... Martin Slattery * Derren Nesbitt ... Colonel Hartmann * Nadia Gray ... Karen Gisevius * Toby Robins ... Ruth * Inger Stratton ... Anna * Cyril Luckham ... Cabinet minister * Edward Fox ... Ritchie Jackson * J.A.B. Dubin-Behrmann ... Joseph Production =Development= Sinatra was in need of a hit‚ÄîMarriage on the Rocks and Assault on a Queen having flopped in the two previous years‚Äîso he put actor and trusted aide Brad Dexter in charge of finding a suitable vehicle. After negotiations for him to star in Harper fell through, The Naked Runner was chosen instead. Sinatra had been impressed with 1965's The IPCRESS File and recruited its director Sidney J. Furie. =Writing= The script by Stanley Mann is based on the 1965 novel by Francis Clifford (a pseudonym of Arthur Leonard Bell Thompson). The title comes from a line in Arthur Symons' In the wood of Finvava‚Äî\\"A naked runner lost in a storm of spears\\"‚Äîthat begins the book. The screenplay largely follows the novel but makes the lead character an American based in London. =Casting= Sinatra was paid $1 million. His co-stars included Peter Vaughan, Derren Nesbitt and Edward Fox. =Filming= The film was shot on location in Europe. However, while in Copenhagen, Sinatra left the production to perform at a rally for California's Democratic governor Pat Brown who was running in the 1966 California gubernatorial election against Republican Ronald Reagan (Brown would lose in a landslide). After doing the campaign event, Sinatra decide he was not going to return to Europe. Instead he informed the crew he wanted to finish all his outstanding scenes on a soundstage in Los Angeles. Dexter and Furie decided to take the maverick action of finishing the film with a stand-in (James Payne) for Sinatra's remaining scenes, editing in close-ups from earlier shots in postproduction and overdubbing the dialogue. Reception Opening to mostly poor reviews on 19 July 1967, The Naked Runner was criticised for its slow pace, camera work and plotting. Variety, however, gave Frank Sinatra fair notice, commenting that \\"Sinatra, whose personal magnetism and acting ability are unquestioned, is shot down by script. Peter Vaughan overacts part as the British agent.\\" However, the reviews of the film weren't enough to keep away audiences who made the film Sinatra's first hit‚Äîalbeit a minor one‚Äîsince the massive success of Von Ryan's Express two years earlier. Although the film makes uses of some interesting locations like the post-war ruins of Leipzig and a rare view inside Centre Point, the film has been described as a lifeless depiction of spy-games, with a listless (if stylised) cinematography, that has a heavy-handed plot and very little real characterisation..

Combatants are said to be in a neutral position if neither is in a more favourable position. If one party has a clear advantage such as in the mount they are said to be in a \\"dominant position\\". Conversely, the other party is considered to be in an inferior position, usually called \\"on the bottom\\", but in this case sometimes called the \\"under mount\\".  Stand-up grappling position  Called clinch position or standing grappling position, these are the core of clinch fighting. From a separated stand-up position, a clinch is the result of one or both fighters applying a clinch hold. The process of attempting to advance into more dominant clinch positions is known as pummelling. The major types of standing clinch are such as: * Bear hug * Collar-and-elbow position * Double collar tie * Double underhooks * Pinch grip tie * Clinch hold Fighters may attempt to break from the clinch, either as the rule requires it as in boxing or because they wish to obtain a better position by moving out and re-engaging, If the clinch continues, fighters may attempt to strike, takedown or throw an opponent. This may result in a win, or the start of ground grappling. Ground grappling position Side control as shown in a combatives manual. Positioning is the foundation of ground fighting, if one combatant is controlling an opponent from a top position, such as if they are pinning the opponent to the ground, then that combatant is said to have the top position, while their opponent is said to have the bottom position. Top positions are usually dominant as fighters can use their weight to their advantage, but depending on the set of rules used, it can have notable exceptions such as the guard. A dominant ground position is usually easier to obtain for the person who initiated the throw or takedown. It may be possible for a fighter in a dominant position to score points or win by pinning their opponent, applying a submission hold or striking. There is a rough hierarchy of major ground grappling positions from the most advantageous to the least for the \\"top\\" fighter: # Rear mount # Mount # Knee-on-stomach # Side control # North-south position # Turtle # Half guard # Disengaged* # Guard : *Fighters are disengaged if neither has a grip on the other they can use to restrict their movement A reversal from a dominant or top position is called a sweep; these are usually the aim of a fighter in the bottom position, though there are some submissions that can be executed from the bottom, most commonly from the guard. While a position may be considered dominant in one sport, that may not be the case in another: for example, the closed guard in BJJ may be dominant in terms of submission; in mixed martial arts (MMA), however, where striking is allowed, while the guard still offers submission opportunities and defence, the fighter on top can strike better than the one on the bottom so the position is usually viewed as neutral in MMA and Budo Moussaraa MMA. Wrestling is different again, viewing the guard as inferior due to the risk of being pinned. Examples * In an amateur wrestling match, the wrestlers are standing in a symmetrical position, with both wrestlers having a pinch grip tie on the other wrestler. The wrestlers are in a neutral position. Wrestler 'A' then pummels through to gain double underhooks so gaining a dominant position. * In a Brazilian jiu-jitsu match, grappler 'C' is holding the other grappler 'D' in an open guard. The open guard allows grappler 'C' to attempt a multitude of submission holds, while grappler 'D's priority is to advance in position; grappler 'C' is in a dominant position while the top grappler is in an inferior position, as it is hard for 'D' to attack before they improve their position. 'D' then used a near knee guard pass getting one leg though to gain a half guard, a more dominant position where they can attack 'C' and 'C' will find submitting them more difficult * In Budo Moussaraa MMA and a mixed martial arts bout, fighter 'E' has a strong closed guard and is using it to help defend against punches; fighter 'F' cannot strike with full effect, but is unlikely to be struck effectively or submitted quickly so they are in a relatively neutral position; fighter 'F' is then swept and mounted by fighter 'E' giving them a dominant position. * In Muay Thai, the stand-up clinch is effectively utilized. However, its grappling attacks are limited to sweeps, as the clinch is mainly used for setting up uppercuts and strikes from the knees and elbows. The primary clinch in this art is known as the Thai Plum or the Collar Tie.

He was noted for introducing the constant pressure engine that is the basis for the gas turbine, and which is now referred to as the Brayton cycle. Brayton's Ready Motor Brayton Gas engine 1872 The early Brayton engine (image taken from Gas and Oil Engines by Dugald Clerk in 1886, and used on the cover of some later editions) Brayton double acting constant pressure engine cut away 1877 In 1872 George Brayton patented a constant pressure internal combustion engine, initially using vaporized gas but later using liquid fuels such as kerosene and oil, known as Brayton's Ready Motor,Borth, Christy. Masters of Mass Production, p. 152, Bobbs-Merrill Company, Indianapolis, IN, 1945. The engine used one cylinder for compression, a receiver reservoir, and a separate power/expander cylinder in which the products of combustion expanded for the power stroke. The significant difference from other piston driven internal combustion engines is that the two cylinders are arranged so that the fuel/air mixture burns progressively at constant pressure as it is transferred from the compressor cylinder and reservoir to the working/expansion cylinder. In the original version a gas/air mixture was created by a vapor carburetor, then compressed and stored in a reservoir where it was ignited and then introduced into an expansion cylinder. A metal gauze/mesh was used to prevent the combustion running back to the reservoir. However at times the mesh failed, leading to flash-back or explosion. In 1874 Brayton filed a patent for a liquid fuel injection system. In this version, fuel was introduced as the air passed into the expansion cylinder, thus eliminating the explosion problem. Ignition remained a pilot flame. The principle was referred to as constant pressure combustion, and had been attempted without success by Sir William Siemens c1861 using a 4-cylinder engine with a separate combustion chamber. Brayton not only achieved success in making the constant pressure cycle work, but he also made and marketed a commercial product. Brayton cycle engines were some of the first engines to be used for motive power. In 1881 John Philip Holland used a Brayton engine to power the world's first successful self- propelled submarine, the Fienian Ram.Fienian Ram Also the Selden auto of 1878 used a Brayton cycle engine. This design never actually ran. When the Brayton engine was applied to an omnibus in 1878 as part of a project between Brayton and the engineers George and James Fawcett the latter described the attempt as a 'complete failure'.From a letter to George Fritz: I am very sorry to say that the car did not run, the engine not being able to move it. You ask me to explain what I mean by failure. I mean that Mr. B's plan to run the car with that 'hobby' of his, 'fluid circulation,' was a total failure, notwithstanding his contradiction; we, at his advice abandoned it and applied chains, but the engine would not move the car with them, would not even slip the wheels on wet ground, but would come to a standstill, so we concluded to give it up. I would like you to get me some information in regard to the experiment he made in Prov. some years ago, how much the engine did, how he succeeded in keeping it cool, and what grade he went up, and, in fact, everything connected with it, if it would not be too much trouble for you. I, goose that I was, put every faith in what the B's and their friends said and did not even enquire from outside parties. I remain, Your friend Jim. J. Harold Byers: The Selden Case. Selden Auto showing Brayton cycle engine The engine's cycle of operations including sectional drawings and indicator diagrams for both gas and petroleum fueled versions. Details of the way the liquid fuel was introduced are described over 11 pages of Dugald Clerk's book Gas and Oil Engines.Dugald Clerk, Gas and Oil Engines, Longman Green & Co, 1897. The petroleum engine in these tests was made by the \\"New York and New Jersey Ready Motor Company\\". This is followed by a similar analysis of Simon's engine which was an adaptation of the Brayton engine made by Louis Simon & Sons, in Nottingham, UK and marketed as The Eclipse Silent Gas Engine. The Simon engine had an added complexity in that it injected some of the water/steam heated by the engine/exhaust into the engine. The indicator diagrams for this engine are also reported by Dugald Clerk and show that the addition of the water has little merit in terms of power production, the cooling of the gases and expansion of the steam compensating for each other. Because the Brayton engine had a slow progressive burn of the fuel/air mixture it was possible to maintain a pilot flame, and so the engine, once lit, needed no form of ignition system. The measured efficiency of the gas engine was intermediate between that of the Lenoir/Hugon engines, and the Otto & Langen atmospheric engine, but the liquid fueled Brayton engine had an advantage in not requiring a gas supply. The early Brayton gas engine had the engine speed governed by varying the point of cut-off for the admission of the combusted gases into the power cylinder, and the admissions of gas and air to the pump was similarly regulated to maintain the reservoir pressure. The liquid fueled engine reported by Clerk only regulated the cut-off to the power cylinder, and used a pressure relief valve to limit the reservoir air pressure. The reservoir on the Brayton engine allowed it to be readily started if it remained pressurized, though Clerk states that \\"leakage and loss were so frequent that the apparatus was of little use.\\" Brayton's engine was displayed at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876, and the Simon variant was displayed at the 1878 Paris Exhibition, and for a few years was well regarded, but within a short time the Otto engine became more popular. However, it was considered the first safe and practical oil engine and also served as inspiration to George B. Selden. As a production engine the design evolved over time, and according to Henry de Graffigny in Gas and Petroleum Engines, it was available in both vertical and horizontal forms.Henry de Graffigny (translated from the French), Gas and Petroleum Engines, Whittaker, London, 1898 A Brayton Engine is preserved in the Smithsonian Institution in the American History museum, and a later Brayton engine which powered one of John Philip Holland's early submarines is preserved in the Paterson Museum in the Old Great Falls Historic District of Paterson, New Jersey. Brayton's contributions to the Diesel engine Brayton air blast injection system 1890 Brayton direct injecton 1887 In 1890 Brayton patented a 4 stroke engine with an air blast fuel injection system. Rudolf Diesel's first engines used an air blast atomization system that was very similar to Brayton's . Unlike Diesel's engine Brayton's engine was fairly low compression. The ignition source was a constantly glowing mesh of platinum.Source: Cassier's Magazine Jun 1893, pgs. 155-157 \\"Engineering\\" July 15 1892  See also  * History of the internal combustion engine *Brayton cycle history *Selden Auto References External links *Short biography on the ASME website 1830 births 1892 deaths People associated with the internal combustion engine American mechanical engineers ","title":"George Brayton"},{"id":"3541661","text":"Ullingswick is a small village in Herefordshire, England located about south west of Bromyard, north east of Hereford and 10 miles south east of Leominster.

On Hutchison's first-class debut for Yorkshire County Cricket Club in 1997, he took 7 for 38, followed by a County Championship debut tally of 7 for 50, recording the best Yorkshire debut bowling return since Wilfred Rhodes in 1898. He went on to play thirty nine first-class matches for Yorkshire between 1996 and 2001, taking 143 wickets at 22.68, before being released by the county. At the start of the 1996 season Hutchison was selected to play in the Test trial match at Chelmsford where he played for 'The Rest of England' against England 'A'. The highlight being dismissing Nasser Hussain in the second innings. Hutchison also toured with England 'A' twice, firstly to Kenya & Sri Lanka in 1997/98 and then Zimbabwe and South Africa in 1998/99. Injury to his back cut short this tour and he returned home with a stress fracture to the back. An injury that would trouble him for the rest of his career. He joined Sussex in 2002, but, beset by injury, he only stayed two years before moving to Middlesex. However, he only made two first-class appearances in 2005. His most recent non first-class appearance was at Lord's in June 2007, when he took 2 for 35 for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against a European XI.

The wires are short-circuited together at the left end, reflecting the waves back up the wires toward the oscillator, creating a standing wave of voltage along the line. The voltage goes to zero at nodes located at multiples of a half- wavelength from the end. The nodes were found by sliding a Geissler tube, a small glow discharge tube like a neon light, up and down the line (two are shown on the line). The high voltage on the line makes the tube glow. When the tube reaches a node, the voltage goes to zero and the tube goes out. The measured distance between two successive nodes is equal to half the wavelength Œª/2 of the radio waves. The line is shown truncated in the drawing; the length of the line was actually 6 meters (18 feet). The radio waves produced by the oscillator were in the UHF range, with a wavelength of several meters. The inset shows types of Geissler tube used with Lecher lines. Lecher-line educational kit sold by Central Scientific Company in the 1930s for teaching radio theory in college. It contains everything necessary, including an absorption wavemeter for independently measuring frequency. In electronics, a Lecher line or Lecher wires is a pair of parallel wires or rods that were used to measure the wavelength of radio waves, mainly at UHF and microwave frequencies. They form a short length of balanced transmission line (a resonant stub). When attached to a source of radio-frequency power such as a radio transmitter, the radio waves form standing waves along their length. By sliding a conductive bar that bridges the two wires along their length, the length of the waves can be physically measured. Austrian physicist Ernst Lecher, improving on techniques used by Oliver Lodge and Heinrich Hertz, developed this method of measuring wavelength around 1888.E. Lecher (1888) \\"Eine studie uber electrische Resonanzerscheinungen\\" (Study of Electrical Resonance Phenomena), Wiedemann Annalen, Vol. 41, p. 850, cited in Fleming, 1908. Lecher lines were used as frequency measuring devices until frequency counters became available after World War 2. They were also used as components, often called \\"resonant stubs\\", in UHF and microwave radio equipment such as transmitters, radar sets, and television sets, serving as tank circuits, filters, and impedance-matching devices. They are used at frequencies between HF/VHF, where lumped components are used, and UHF/SHF, where resonant cavities are more practical. Wavelength measurement A Lecher line is a pair of parallel uninsulated wires or rods held a precise distance apart. The separation is not critical but should be a small fraction of the wavelength; it ranges from less than a centimeter to over 10 cm. The length of the wires depends on the wavelength involved; lines used for measurement are generally several wavelengths long. The uniform spacing of the wires makes them a transmission line, conducting radio waves at a constant speed very close to the speed of light. One end of the rods is connected to the source of RF power, such as the output of a radio transmitter. At the other end the rods are connected together with a conductive bar between them. This short circuiting termination reflects the waves. The waves reflected from the short-circuited end interfere with the outgoing waves, creating a sinusoidal standing wave of voltage and current on the line. The voltage goes to zero at nodes located at multiples of half a wavelength from the end, with maxima called antinodes located midway between the nodes. Therefore, the wavelength Œª can be determined by finding the location of two successive nodes (or antinodes) and measuring the distance between them, and multiplying by two. The frequency f of the waves can be calculated from the wavelength and the speed of the waves, which is the speed of light c: :f = frac{c}{lambda} , The nodes are much sharper than the antinodes, because the change of voltage with distance along the line is maximum at the nodes, so they are used. =Finding the nodes= Two methods are employed to find the nodes. One is to use some type of voltage indicator, such as an RF voltmeter or light bulb, attached to a pair of contacts that slide up and down the wires. When the bulb reaches a node, the voltage between the wires goes to zero, so the bulb goes out. If the indicator has too low an impedance it will disturb the standing wave on the line, so a high impedance indicator must be used; a regular incandescent bulb has too low a resistance. Lecher and early researchers used long thin Geissler tubes, laying the glass tube directly across the line. The high voltage of early transmitters excited a glow discharge in the gas. In modern times small neon bulbs are often used. One problem with using glow discharge bulbs is their high striking voltage makes it difficult to localize the exact voltage minimum. In precision wavemeters an RF voltmeter is used. The other method used to find the nodes is to slide the terminating shorting bar up and down the line, and measure the current flowing into the line with an RF ammeter in the feeder line. The current on the Lecher line, like the voltage, forms a standing wave with nodes (points of minimum current) every half wavelength. So the line presents an impedance to the applied power which varies with its length; when a current node is located at the entrance to the line, the current drawn from the source, measured by the ammeter, will be minimum. The shorting bar is slid down the line and the position of two successive current minima is noted, the distance between them is half a wavelength. With care, Lecher lines can measure frequency to an accuracy of 0.1%. =Construction= Lecher line wavemeter, from \\"DIY\\" article in 1946 radio magazine A major attraction of Lecher lines was they were a way to measure frequency without complicated electronics, and could be improvised from simple materials found in a typical shop. Lecher line wavemeters are usually built on a frame which holds the conductors rigid and horizontal, with a track that the shorting bar or indicator rides on, and a built-in measuring scale so the distance between nodes can be read out. The frame must be made of a nonconductive material like wood, because any conducting objects near the line can disturb the standing wave pattern. The RF current is usually coupled into the line through a single turn loop of wire at one end, which can be held near a transmitter's tank coil. A simpler design is a \\"U\\"-shaped metal bar, marked with graduations, with a sliding shorting bar. In operation, the U end acts as a coupling link and is held near the transmitter's tank coil, and the shorting bar is slid out along the arms until the transmitter's plate current dips, indicating the first node has been reached. Then the distance from the end of the link to the shorting bar is a half-wavelength. The shorting bar should always be slid out, away from the link end, not in, to avoid converging on a higher order node by mistake. In many ways Lecher lines are an electrical version of the Kundt's tube experiment which is used to measure the wavelength of sound waves.  Measuring the speed of light  If the frequency f of the radio waves is independently known, the wavelength Œª measured on a Lecher line can be used to calculate the speed of the waves, c, which is approximately equal to the speed of light: :c = lambda f , In 1891, French physicist Prosper-Ren√© Blondlot made the first, credited to K. D. Froome and L. Essen, \\"The Velocity of Light and Radio Waves\\", Academic Press, 1969 measurement of the speed of radio waves, using this method., p.15 He used 13 different frequencies between 10 and 30 MHz and obtained an average value of 297,600 km/s, which is within 1% of the current value for the speed of light. Other researchers repeated the experiment with greater accuracy. This was an important confirmation of James Clerk Maxwell's theory that light was an electromagnetic wave like radio waves. Other applications Lecher line as a tank circuit in an RF amplifier. Not shown in this simplified diagram are the chokes that feed the tube anodes from the HT source. Without them the two anodes are shorted together. Short lengths of Lecher line are often used as high Q resonant circuits, termed resonant stubs. For example, a quarter wavelength (Œª/4) shorted Lecher line acts like a parallel resonant circuit, appearing as a high impedance at its resonant frequency and low impedance at other frequencies. They are used because at UHF frequencies the value of inductors and capacitors needed for 'lumped component' tuned circuits becomes extremely low, making them difficult to fabricate and sensitive to parasitic capacitance and inductance. One difference between them is that transmission line stubs like Lecher lines also resonate at odd-number multiples of their fundamental resonant frequency, while lumped LC circuits just have one resonant frequency. =Power amplifier tank circuits= Lecher line circuits can be used for the tank circuits of UHF power amplifiers. For instance, the twin tetrode (QQV03-20) 432 MHz amplifier described by G.R JessopG.R. Jessop, VHF UHF manual, RSGB, Potters Bar, 1983, uses a Lecher line anode tank. =Television tuners= Quarter-wave Lecher lines are used for the tuned circuits in the RF amplifier and local oscillator portions of modern television sets. The tuning necessary to select different stations is done by varactor diodes across the Lecher line.  Characteristic impedance of Lecher line  The separation between the Lecher bars does not affect the position of the standing waves on the line, but it does determine the characteristic impedance, which can be important for matching the line to the source of the radio frequency energy for efficient power transfer. For two parallel cylindrical conductors of diameter d and spacing D, Z_0 = 276 log left(frac{D}{d} + sqrt{left(frac{D}{d}right)^2 - 1} right) = frac{120}{sqrt{epsilon_r}} cosh^{-1} left(frac{D}{d}right) For parallel wires the formula for capacitance (per unit length) C is :C = frac{pi epsilon_0 epsilon_r}{ln {left(frac{2D}{d}right)}}, Hence as :Z_0^2 = frac{L}{C} :begin{align} c &= frac 1 {sqrt{frac{L}{C} cdot C^2}}  &= frac 1 {Z_0cdotleft(piepsilon_0epsilon_rright)cdot ln left(frac{2D}{d}right)} end{align} Commercially available 300 and 450 ohm twin lead balanced ribbon feeder can be used as a fixed length Lecher line (resonant stub).

About Callebaut is a Belgian couverture chocolate manufacturer. Couverture chocolate is chocolate with a high cocoa butter content used by gourmet and culinary professionals. Many professionals who use Callebaut couverture chocolate use it for its workability and typical taste, which has remained constant over the decades. The company's core chocolate range is manufactured in Belgium from bean to chocolate according to traditional recipes. Callebaut still applies the whole-bean roasting technique (instead of roasting cocoa kernels), as it did over 100 years ago. This technique allows the preservation of all the flavors and aromatic oils within the cocoa husk and fully releases them in the chocolate. Whole-bean roasting is nowadays often used by artisan, small-batch chocolate makers. Callebaut has preserved this original roasting method. History The original Callebaut factory. =Chocolaterie Callebaut= ‚ÄòChocolaterie Callebaut‚Äô was established in 1911Callebaut 100 Years - 100 years by Octaaf Callebaut in the small Belgian village of Wieze. His chocolate company took up the same factory building his grandfather Eug√®ne Callebaut founded as a family-run brewing and milling company called ‚ÄòDe Ploeg‚Äô in 1850. Octaaf Callebaut's chocolate recipes (of which the 811 and 823 recipes are still produced today) quickly took to the liking of numerous chocolatiers, bakers and pastry chefs. As a result, Chocolaterie Callebaut PLC was established in 1930. A clear focus towards the professional market took shape and the company from then on dedicated its activities to supplying and servicing chocolatiers, confectioners and bakeries. Callebaut worldwide export. =Focus on couverture chocolate= After Octaaf Callebaut's death, his daughter Marie and his nephew Charles Callebaut took over the company in 1945. After World War II, the production of couverture chocolate became the company's core business, complemented by a limited range of bars and tablets. Callebaut now offered chocolate for artisan chocolatiers around the world and the company's W2 reference was created. By 1965 Callebaut couverture chocolates had entered new markets across Europe and overseas, marking the beginning of Callebaut's global exploration. in 1988, the Callets see the daylight: these small drop-shaped chocolate pieces were developed to optimize the workability of chocolate. Dosing, melting and tempering work better with smaller drops than with the original big 5 kg blocks of chocolate. In the same year Callebaut established the Callebaut College in Belgium. It is a teaching and training center for artisans and professionals who want to improve their working skills in chocolate and learn about new trends, techniques and recipes. It was the first of the current 13 Callebaut Chocolate Academies, located all over the world. World Chocolate Masters =Sustainable growth= In 1996 Callebaut merged with French chocolate maker Cacao Barry to form the Barry Callebaut group. Both chocolate brands however still remain existent separately under the Barry Callebaut umbrella, with Callebaut as its premium couverture chocolate brand for Belgian Chocolate. In 2002 Callebaut called the Callebaut Ambassador Club into existence to support the development of new products, packaging, recipes and professional training events. Today, the club counts 55 members worldwide, all of which are renowned chefs, pastry chefs and confectioners with an international reputation. In the same year, Callebaut, together with chocolate brands Carma and Cacao Barry, organized the World Chocolate Masters for the first time. The World Chocolate Masters were (and still are) the only international competition in the world solely dedicated to the art of chocolate. As a result of its tremendous success, the competition instantly grew into a biennial event. In May 2012 Callebaut was Belgium's first chocolate brand to shift to sustainably grown cocoa for all its Finest Belgian Chocolate recipes. The launch of Callebaut's Growing Great Chocolate program was aimed at making cocoa cultivation a sustainable source of income for West African farmers and have a positive impact on farmer livelihoods.Hot Choccy Callebaut - Growing Great Chocolate Awards, decorations and certifications =Awards and decorations= :1993 : :* Prince Philippe of Belgium awards Callebaut with the ‚ÄòGrote Oscar voor de Export‚Äô, a highly prestigious distinction that recognizes the company‚Äôs efforts to share its unmistakably Belgian heritage with the world. : :* Callebaut receives the Golden Quality Logo, which is only awarded to companies that are ISO-certified and show a clear progress in terms of integral quality : :2008 : :* Callebaut‚Äôs Callets Sensation, shiny chocolate pearls, are awarded the Ruban Bleu award in the chocolate category at the Europain-Intersuc trade fair in Paris, acknowledging Callebaut‚Äôs sense of innovation and progress, market knowledge and value for money products. : :2010 : :* Callebaut‚Äôs Crispearls, tiny chocolate pearls with a crunchy, toasted biscuit kernel, win the Ruban Bleu award at the Europain-Intersuc trade fair in Paris.

History Built on the site of an earlier castle, and dedicated to Saints Laurence and Gregory, it was founded by Bishop Otto of Bamberg between about 1108 and 1113; the foundation charter is dated 1122. The new foundation was settled by monks from Hirsau Abbey. The first abbot was Ekkehard of Aura, a monk from Bamberg, famous as the continuer of the Weltchronik of Frutolf of Michelsberg. The V√∂gte were the Counts of Henneberg, although later the Bishop of W√ºrzburg seems to have acquired some authority here. In 1469 the abbey joined the Bursfelde Congregation, but suffered repeated disasters in the 16th century, including almost complete destruction by a rioting mob in 1525, and after rebuilding, a second destruction in 1553 during the second campaign of Albert Alcibiades, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach (the Markgr√§flerkrieg). It was finally dissolved in 1564 and its assets transferred to the exchequer of the Diocese of W√ºrzburg. An attempt at a revival was started in 1617 by Prince-Bishop Gottfried von Aschhausen, but the project was abandoned at his death in 1622, leaving some impressive remains of the unfinished church.

It stars Ryuji Harada, Miki Tanaka, and Mubu Nakayama.  Synopsis  In the Edo period of Japan, a lone wanderer wearing a cloak of skins ends up in a gambling town run by demons, namely Boss Ounizo, that hide in the guise of humans to interact with other people. Demons Youkai in this era, like the fair folk, were once equal citizens, and lived beside mankind peacefully; but as advances in technology, especially warfare (with the explosive introduction of the Howitzer, nonetheless), humans have forgotten their tolerance and nearly wiped their counterparts into extinction. Kibakichi is forced to stay, but uncovers the gambling house's secret: the demons, tired of living in fear, have taken the biggest gamble of all - a pact with the current ruling human government to fortify a sanctum where they would be free from tyranny. However, as Kibakichi himself remembers, though not all humans are bad, not all can be trusted. Being the likely sole survivor of his exterminated clan (a native tribe of Wolves that once put their faith in humanity, to catastrophic consequences),he is a cautious and un-trusting warrior, though quickly comes to see that not all is as it seems. The shady business acts more like a close and happy family of those without homes, like him, that welcome him warmly; even Ounizo has adopted a human girl, Kikyo, as his daughter, and all do their best to live. No matter for how short a time that may be.

Implementation Pilot experiments are frequently carried out before large-scale quantitative research, in an attempt to avoid time and money being used on an inadequately designed project. A pilot study is usually carried out on members of the relevant population. A pilot study is often used to test the design of the full-scale experiment which then can be adjusted. It is a potentially valuable insight and, should anything be missing in the pilot study, it can be added to the full-scale (and more expensive) experiment to improve the chances of a clear outcome. Other applications In sociology, pilot studies can be referred to as small-scale studies that will help identify design issues before the main research is done. Although pilot experiments have a well-established tradition, their usefulness as a strategy for change has been questioned, at least in the domain of environmental management.Bill√©, R.

S.A.P.I.EN.S. 3 (1) Extrapolation from a pilot study to large scale strategy may not be assumed as possible, partly due to the exceptional resources and favorable conditions that accompany a pilot study. In the health research context, studies conducted in preparation for a future randomized controlled trial are known as pilot and feasibility studies, where pilot studies are a subset of feasibility studies. A feasibility study asks whether something can be done, should we proceed with it, and if so, how.

Responsibility for the Fund within government lies with the Shareholder Executive, on behalf of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. The Fund is incorporated as a limited company registered in Scotland and is owned by the Nuclear Trust. It consists of five trustees, three appointed by the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change and two by the owners of the nuclear power stations, now EDF Energy. The trustees are also directors of the Fund as well as owning the ordinary share capital of the Fund.  History  The Nuclear Generation Decommissioning Fund was established on 28 March 1996 by the UK Government as part of the preparations for the privatisation of British Energy. It covered the nuclear power stations owned by the company on 20 March 1996, comprising seven advanced gas cooled reactor (AGR) stations and one pressurised water reactor (PWR) station. The obligations of the Fund were set out in an agreement known as the Nuclear Decommissioning Agreement. The Fund had an initial endowment of ¬£232m and thereafter received ¬£4m a quarter from British Energy, adjusted each year in line with RPI. On 14 January 2005, following the restructuring of British Energy after it required financial assistance from the government, the original agreement was terminated. It was replaced by the Contribution Agreement (CA) and the Nuclear Liabilities Funding Agreement (NLFA). Broadly, these agreements resulted in the following: * The renaming of the Fund as the Nuclear Liabilities Fund. * Changes in decommissioning arrangements set out in the CA and the NLFA, such that the Fund continued to have the object of discharging the decommissioning liabilities of British Energy but also certain contracted and uncontracted nuclear liabilities. The Secretary of State agreed to fund these liabilities to the extent that they might exceed all the assets of the Fund. * British Energy continued to pay quarterly contributions of ¬£6m but in addition the Fund received ¬£275m in 7% Guaranteed Bonds issued by British Energy, entitlement to 65% of British Energy's free cashflow in each year and ¬£150k per tonne in respect of fuel loaded at Sizewell B, the UK's sole PWR station. * The Trustees ceased to have responsibility for adequacy. The newly created Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) became responsible for determining liabilities. A first review of the Fund is due to be carried out in January 2015 by the Fund and at each ten-year anniversary thereafter or at any time after 2015 on the instigation of the Secretary of State. Part of the Fund's interest in British Energy was realised on 31 May 2007, when it converted approximately 30% of its entitlement to British Energy's free cashflow into 450m British Energy shares. These were immediately sold to investors at a price of 520p per share, raising ¬£2.34 billion. On 19 January 2009, the Fund sold its remaining 36% interest in British Energy following the takeover of the company by EDF Energy. The sale raised a further ¬£4.421 billion, taking the total Fund value at that date to ¬£8.3 billion. This is to be invested to fund the long term decommissioning costs of EDF's eight former British Energy nuclear stations, plus certain other contracted and uncontracted nuclear liabilities relating to the assets as they arise.

It featured pop and rock music videos over a 30-minute timeframe, presented in a countdown format. The show was typically hosted by a man identified on-air as \\"Joe from Chicago\\". Most episodes feature Joe traveling to various locations to hear viewers request specific music videos. Several guest hosts were featured over the program's run, such as the Monkees and They Might Be Giants. Music videos played on the show were decided using request letters sent in by viewers. In 1987, five to six thousand requests were received weekly. Many musical guests on Nick Rocks were also seen on Nickelodeon sister channel MTV at the time; according to Nickelodeon president Geraldine Laybourne, MTV executives assisted in finding talent for the program. History Upon the series' premiere in 1984, representatives for Nickelodeon's parent company Warner-Amex addressed concerns that the program would show \\"indecent\\" music videos like sister network MTV. Warner-Amex's Margaret Wade told Newsweek that schedulers would be \\"meticulous\\" in choosing what to show on Nick Rocks. Nick Rocks was initially broadcast three times a week until July 1984, when it became part of Nickelodeon's daily rotation. In 1987, the Monkees became involved in a dispute with their supporters at MTV, causing MTV to pull the group's videos; as a result, \\"Monkees\\" videos were transferred to Nick Rocks. The band's \\"Heart and Soul\\" music video was voted by Nick Rocks viewers to be their favorite 1987 music video. Despite heavy promotion on Nickelodeon, the founders of the Monkees' label Rhino Records felt that the transition from MTV to Nickelodeon was a reason behind the commercial failure of the Monkees' album Pool It!. Nickelodeon launched several promotional events in support of Nick Rocks. In 1984, a musical presentation called \\"Nick Night\\" was staged at New York's Nassau Coliseum to advertise the series. In 1987, the network held the \\"Jet for a Day\\" sweepstakes, with the prize being a role on Nick Rocks and tickets to a Jets concert. After production on Nick Rocks ended, Nickelodeon incorporated past episodes into a three-hour variety show known as Total Panic. The program aired on Sunday mornings in 1989 and was produced by Andy Bamberger, who also produced Nick Rocks. Merchandise Nickelodeon staff distributed Nick Rocks merchandise, including buttons and decals, at the \\"Nick Night\\" event in 1984. 1990 issues of Nickelodeon Magazine, sold exclusively at Pizza Hut restaurants, featured pop culture quizzes based on rerunning Nick Rocks episodes. While Nick Rocks was never released on home video while running, an episode of Nick Rocks starring They Might Be Giants is included as a bonus feature on the DVD release of the band's 2003 film, Gigantic: A Tale of Two Johns. Nick Jr. Rocks Nick Jr. Rocks title card. A spin-off geared towards preschool viewers, titled Nick Jr. Rocks, premiered as part of Nickelodeon's Nick Jr. block in October 1991. The series was produced by actress Shelley Duvall and initially ran for five minutes at a time. Differently from its predecessor, Nick Jr. Rocks featured original music videos created specifically for the program. According to a 1991 interview with Duvall, Nickelodeon offered her as much airtime as she wanted for the series; as a result, Nick Jr. Rocks had no permanent position on the network's lineup.

Although he died a natural death (of throat cancer in Swansea)http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/paddy-meehan-1.489729 Herald obituary a number of people involved in the case died violent deaths, in clashes between former associates among Glasgow criminals. Meehan came from Glasgow and was a \\"peter man\\", a safe-blower with convictions for bank robbery. In 1969 Mrs. Rachael Ross was murdered during a robbery at her bungalow in Ayr by two men. Her husband (Abraham Ross) survived the robbery, and he reported that the robbers had addressed each other as \\"Pat\\" and \\"Jim\\". Police suspected two known criminals, Meehan and James Griffiths, who had been in the area. Griffiths panicked when the police tried to arrest him, and he went on a gun-toting rampage across Glasgow. He was shot dead by police, but only after he shot and injured several passers-by, one of whom later died. Meehan was arrested more peacefully and charged with the murder of Mrs. Ross. His solicitor was Joseph Beltrami, and his advocates were Nicholas Fairbairn and John Smith, who both later became high-ranking politicians. At his trial he submitted a defence of incrimination, claiming that the murder was committed by another man, Ian Waddell, but was found guilty. His conviction proved controversial and there was a campaign for his release which included Fairbairn and Ludovic Kennedy.Kennedy, Ludovic Presumption of Innocence After the trial Waddell made a number of statements to journalists that he had committed the murder. Meehan spent several years in prison, but was eventually released and given a royal pardon in 1976. Later that year Waddell was put on trial for the murder of Mrs. Ross. At his trial he submitted a defence of incrimination, claiming that the murder was committed by Meehan. This trial, and particularly the judge's summing-up, raised important questions about the legal meaning of a royal pardon, and Waddell was acquitted. Shortly after Bruce Millan, Secretary of State for Scotland, commented in the House of Commons about these issues.http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1976/dec/08/mr-patrick- meehan Millan's statement in Hansard Waddell was himself later murdered by an associate, Andrew Gentle, shortly after a robbery in which they murdered a woman. Gentle was convicted of both murders and later committed suicide in prison.Jeffreys, Thomas. Glasgow's Hard MenJeffrey, Robert Crimes Past: Glasgow's Crimes of the Century An inquiry into the miscarriage of justice, held due to public demand, and chaired by Lord Hunter, reported in 1982. This concluded that, despite a pardon, Meehan's guilt was not disproved, and there was no evidence of the police fabricating evidence as claimed. It was widely criticised as a whitewash. In view of information which has come to light since then, it is now generally accepted that the murder of Mrs. Ross was committed by Waddell and William \\"Tank\\" McGuiness, another man who was also murdered in 1976, apparently in a drunken street brawl. One crucial aspect of the case was that Beltrami knew that McGuiness had committed the murder of Mrs. Ross since he had told him under client confidentiality, but he was unable to reveal this; he was only able to do so after McGuiness was dead. (The last person to be seen with McGuiness while alive, John Winning, was charged with his murder, but the case against him collapsed because of insufficient evidence. Winning was also later murdered.) In later years Meehan put forward elaborate claims that he was framed by intelligence services due to issues concerning the escape of George Blake.

Life Stekelman studied modern dance in Buenos Aires with Paulina Ossona and Renate Schottelius and then traveled to New York, where she studied at the Martha Graham Dance School. In 1968 she joined the Oscar Araiz School of Dance and in 1972 attended the Opera College, where she studied dance and music research). She was a founder member of the San Martin Theatre Contemporary Ballet and was Artistic Director of the company between 1977 and 1981 and again between 1988 and 1990. In 1976, 1978 and 1990, she was invited to participate in the American Dance Festival. After creating Tangokinesis, she continued her research into the fusion of tango and modern dance. The company has toured the world, performing in the most important cultural festivals, such as: The Autumn Festival in Madrid, Biennale de la Danse de Lyon, Colorado Dance Festival, The American Dance Festival, World Financial Center in New York, and twice at the Kennedy Center. She was the only Argentine choreographer invited to close the Festival of Avignon in the Coeur d'honneur del Palais des Papes in 1999. Working with Julio Bocca, Tangokinesis performed at the Paris Opera Garnier, showcasing the worldwide premiere of Consagraci√≥n del Tango (Tango's Consecration). The main feature of the Tangokinesis is not only the fusion of two choreographic languages (Modern Dance and Tango) but also the fact that the group employs dancers with very different disciplines: the women are from the classic and modern dance background, whereas the men are trained in tango and folklore. Stekelman has created pieces for different ballet companies around the world, including the Ballet Stagium of Brazil, Ballet du Nord in France, Ballet dell' Opera of Rome, the National Ballet of Chile, and the Colon Theatre of Buenos Aires. She has created several works for internationally renowned dancer Julio Bocca: Concertango, Consagraci√≥n del Tango, Mambo Suite, Piazzolla Tango Vivo; Bocca Tango, Repercusiones and El hombre de la corbata roja. In addition, Stekelman was asked by Spanish movie director Carlos Saura to choreograph some scenes for the film Tango, for which she was awarded the American Choreography Award in Los Angeles and was nominated for an Academy Award. In April 2002, Tangokinesis was selected to feature in the documentary film Tango D√©sir produced by the French Arte channel, and in September 2003 she was invited by the Hebbel Theatre to perform at the Marlene Dietrich Square in Berlin with the show Tango, Vals, Tango.

They had a son, Steve Chiolak, in 1911, but their marriage did not last. By the end of the decade CumpƒÉna»ô was working as a prostitute; she later became a madam. Her first brothel was in East Chicago and in 1923, she opened a second one in Gary. CumpƒÉna»ô married attorney Alexandru Suciu, and the couple used Sage as their surnameSegel, p.200 (this was an Anglicization of Suciu, reputedly preferred by Immigration and Naturalization Service officials). In 1923 or 1924, CumpƒÉna»ô-Sage traveled to the Kingdom of Romania and visited her mother, returning on board the RMS Majestic. Friction between her husband and her son led to the breakup of the marriage, and CumpƒÉna»ô left Alexandru in 1932. A year later, she opened a brothel on Halsted Street in Chicago. By 1934, CumpƒÉna»ô was facing deportation to Romania, after the authorities deemed her to be an \\"alien of low moral character\\".Christopher Connolly, \\"Famous Spies and Snitches\\", CNN release, August 19, 2008 (originally published by mental floss); retrieved June 25, 2009 On July 4, 1934, John Dillinger began frequenting CumpƒÉna»ô and her circle of friends. CumpƒÉna»ô was reportedly close to Polly Hamilton, who was Dillinger's lover. Once CumpƒÉna»ô became aware of Dillinger's real identity, she considered turning him in as a way of obtaining permanent US residence.Berlioz-Curlet, p.157-158; Gorn, p.164; Segel, p.200. According to Goodman, Hamilton was \\"the girl Mrs. Sage had 'arranged' for [Dillinger]\\" As Dillinger was rumored to have killed two Chicago Police officers on May 24 of that year, a large reward had also been offered for his capture. On July 22, after contacting the Federal Bureau of Investigation through the Chicago Police, CumpƒÉna»ô fingered Dillinger to the FBI agent Melvin Purvis, resulting in Dillinger's shooting outside the Biograph Theater in Chicago.Berlioz-Curlet, p.157-158; Goodman, p.169; Gorn, p.164-165, 172; Segel, p.200\\"Milestones\\", in TIME, May 5, 1947 Despite the nickname and her alleged promise to wear red as a distinctive mark, CumpƒÉna»ô is said to have actually worn orange that night.Goodman, p.169 The FBI moved CumpƒÉna»ô first to Detroit and then to California. She received a US$ 5,000 reward, only half of what she had been allegedly promised.Berlioz- Curlet, p.158. See also Goodman, p.169 In 1935, she informed reporters of the deal to keep her in the country, but deportation proceedings had already begun. Allegedly, the FBI told her they could not stop the procedures, due to bureaucracy or poor communication between branches of the federal government. She appealed the decision to deport her, and her case was heard in Chicago on October 16, 1935. In January 1936, the court agreed with the lower court, and CumpƒÉna»ô was deported to Timi»ôoara, Romania, the same year.Berlioz-Curlet, p.158 Making a point of shunning further publicity, she lived there until her death from liver disease in 1947. Legacy Famous as the \\"Woman in Red\\", CumpƒÉna»ô reached the status of cultural icon in the United States in the years following Dillinger's death.Gorn, p.172, 175 Her story was integrated into a series of Dillinger myths, entertaining the public during the Great Depression. According to this popular interpretation, the gangster had been betrayed by his own weakness for women (an idea first circulated by the newspapers covering her role in the 1934 events).Goodman, p.169; Gorn, p.172, 175 On the night of Dillinger's death, an unknown chalked a pavement near the Biograph Theater with the epitaph: Stranger, stop and wish me well, Just a prayer for my soul in Hell. I was a good fellow, most people said, Betrayed by a woman all dressed in red. Hollywood films and television productions focusing on Dillinger also include references to Ana CumpƒÉna»ô. She has been portrayed, albeit not always as Anna Sage, by several actresses including: Ann Morriss (as Mildred Jaunce) in Gang Busters (1942) and Guns Don't Argue (serialized in 1952, and released as a feature film in 1957); Jean Willes in The FBI Story (1959); Cloris Leachman in Dillinger (1973); Bernadette Peters (as Nellie) in Love, American Style; Louise Fletcher in The Lady in Red (1979); Debi Monahan in Dillinger and Capone (1995); and Branka Katiƒá in Public Enemies (2009).Anna Sage, at the Internet Movie Database; retrieved July 22, 2009 In Romania, interest in the career of Ana CumpƒÉna»ô was sparked by Mircea Veroiu's film Femeia √Æn ro»ôu (\\"The Woman in Red\\", 1997). It is in turn based on a 1990 book co-authored by three Postmodernist writers‚ÄîAdriana Babe»õi, Mircea MihƒÉie»ô and Mircea Nedelciu‚Äîreputedly suggested by Banat Swabian author William Totok. Cornel Ungureanu, \\"De la o enciclopedie la alta\\" , in Revista 22, Nr. 719, December 2003 The latter is a fictionalized account, depicting real or imagined events occurring after her return from America.Segel, p.201 The narrative moves beyond genre boundaries, mixing the account with metafictional elements and accounts of unrelated episodes (involving, among others, writer Elias Canetti and psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud). A best seller, the novel reportedly propelled CumpƒÉna»ô the character to iconic status in Romania, and, according to critic Cornel Ungureanu, made her \\"the actual aunt of autochthonous Postmodernism.\\" The case of Ana CumpƒÉna»ô was discussed by researcher Jay Robert Nash in his book Dillinger: Dead or Alive?, as part of a theory claiming that, unable to apprehend the real John Dillinger, the FBI had staged his killing, using an innocent victim.Goodman, p.171 Nash, whose version of events is deemed \\"quaint\\" by crime historian Jonathan Goodman, further argues that her deportation was part of a cover-up.

He stated that the policies of Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke and President Obama would lead to double-digit inflation with high unemployment and could facilitate the abandonment of the US Dollar by the end of the Obama Presidency. Murphy warned that soaring prices for gasoline and imported products sold at Wal-Mart might be blamed by Obama Administration officials on \\"an attack on the Dollar by foreign speculators\\" and used by them to replace the Dollar with the Amero or some other currency \\"issued by a supranational organization\\". Murphy urged investors to purchase an \\"emergency stockpile\\" of physical gold and silver, and predicted double-digit inflation.Robert P. Murphy, \\"Killing the Currency\\", The American Conservative, December 10, 2009. In July 2009, Murphy proclaimed that the economy would be \\"in the toilet for a decade\\" and predicted \\"20+ percent price inflation\\".Murphy, Robert P. (January 2, 2013). \\"Learning from Brad DeLong and Paul Krugman.\\" In a series of articles on his personal website, Murphy states that he agreed to a bet that there would be a year/year increase in the seasonally adjusted Consumer Price Index of over 10% by 2013, and notes that he lost the bet. In a column criticizing economists \\"who stick with their ideology no matter how badly it performs in practice\\", Paul Krugman noted that University of California, Berkeley Professor of Economics J. Bradford DeLong had attacked Murphy for \\"predicting double-digit inflation for years but remain[ing] absolutely committed to his framework\\" despite the predictions being unfulfilled. In December 2012 Krugman again addressed Murphy's failed inflation predictions, criticizing Murphy's belief that \\"his failed inflation forecast is OK\\" because it is attributable to \\"huge deflationary downdraft that offset the inflationary impact of Fed expansion.\\" Krugman wrote that if that was true, \\"we should be hailing Ben Bernanke for preventing a catastrophic deflation.\\"Paul Krugman, On Not Learning, Continued, New York Times, December 31, 2012. Murphy replied on his blog to Krugman and DeLong's criticisms, saying \\"my price inflation wager has nothing to do with Austrian business cycle theory\\" and that Krugman was using a \\"macro model\\" which does not apply to Austrian theory which relies on \\"heterogeneous capital goods\\" and artificially low interest rates distortion of investment flows into various sectors. He admitted he was not sure why his inflation prediction was wrong.Learning From Brad DeLong and Paul Krugman, Robert P. Murphy blog, January 2, 2013. In a May 2013 piece published by The American Conservative, Murphy wrote about Krugman's predictions regarding fiscal austerity and the 2013 U.S. government budget sequestration.Robert P. Murphy, Heads Krugman Wins, Tails ‚ÄòAusterity‚Äô Loses, The American Conservative, May 23, 2013. In 2013 Murphy challenged Krugman to a debate and unnamed supporters of Murphy promised to donate $100,000 to a charity if Krugman would debate Murphy on economic policy issues. A promotional website was established for the challenge. Krugman called the proposed debate a \\"public circus\\" and stated \\"Why should I dignify that totally-wrong doctrine ‚Äî that doctrine that's gotten everything wrong ‚Äî by giving them a platform?\\"Lehrer, Brian (June 4, 2012). \\"The Brian Lehrer Show: Paul Krugman Weighs In.\\"Krugmandebate.com Religious views Murphy is a Christian, and has stated in his writings that \\"my ethical beliefs are informed by my Christian faith, and I am a firm believer in natural law\\".Murphy, Robert P. \\"The Possibility of Private Law.\\" Mises.org. 3 August 2005.

He is best known for his work as a drummer for New York singer- songwriter Billy Joel's recording and touring band and most recently as drummer for The Slim Kings, but he has also played with the NYC Hit Squad and has been a session drummer on recordings of other artists. He is credited as drummer on over 150 million records sold. Life and career DeVitto was born in New York City, of Italian ancestry, where his father was a police officer at the New York Police Department. He taught himself to play the drums after seeing The Beatles on their appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show in February 1964. He was also influenced as a teenager by rock drummer Dino Danelli. DeVitto got his big break in the music business when he was hired to play drums for Billy Joel in the mid-1970s. In an online interview, DeVitto describes how Joel's classic late 1970s-early 1980s band first came together: > Billy and I used to play the same club in Plainview, Long Island, called \\"My > House.\\" He was 17 and in a band called The Hassles and I was 16 and in a > band called The New Rock Workshop. We would watch each other play and > acknowledge each other in passing. In 1974, he was living in Los Angeles and > had already released Piano Man and Streetlife Serenade. He used studio > musicians for the recording and different guys out on the road. I was > playing in a band called Topper with Doug Stegmeyer and he got the gig to > play bass with Billy on the \\"Streetlife\\" tour. He told Doug that he wanted > to move back to New York and find a permanent band he could record and tour > with on a regular basis. Doug recommended me because Billy was looking for a > New York-type drummer, aggressive and hard hitting, and the rest is history. > The three of us recorded the basic tracks for Turnstiles and we both > recommended Russell Javors and Howie Emerson, who played guitars in Topper > and with the addition of Richie Cannata on saxophone, the \\"Billy Joel Band\\" > was born.Blog Interview with Liberty DeVitto In addition to his work with Joel, DeVitto has also been an active session musician working with other big acts such as Carly Simon, Phoebe Snow, Karen Carpenter, Stevie Nicks, Rick Wakeman, Bob James and Meat Loaf. After working with Joel for 30 years, DeVitto was discharged from drumming duties for the 2006 Billy Joel tour for an unknown reason. Up to that point, he had the longest running tenure in Joel's band, starting with the recording of 1976's Turnstiles. As of 2018, DeVitto uses Liberty drums, pedals & hardware, Sabian cymbals, Evans drumheads, Latin Percussion and Pro-Mark drumsticks.http://www.drummersresource.com/liberty-devitto- interview/https://www.libertydrums.com/pages/artists DeVitto appeared on the November/December 2013 cover of Making Music magazine to discuss his life and career. Around that time he began collaborations with Brooklyn singer- songwriter Michael Sackler-Berner, which led to the founding of band The Slim Kings alongside bassist Andy Attanasio. The Slim Kings released two albums and multiple singles, landing music featured on shows like Bloodline on Netflix, Chicago PD and Chicago Fire on NBC, Nurse Jackie on Showtime and many others. The band toured with ZZ Top, Los Lonely Boys and continues to play in the tri- state region regularly. They recently worked with Grammy-winning producers Steve Jordan and Joel Hamilton. On October 23, 2014, DeVitto, Cannata, and Javors (with Stegmeyer, posthumously) were inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame, primarily for their work with Joel. Shortly thereafter, DeVitto, Cannata, and Javors officially formed The Lords of 52nd Street band; the band also includes a pianist and lead vocalist, keyboardist, and a guitarist, and plays faithful renditions of the recorded Joel originals. =Lawsuit= On May 19, 2009, DeVitto filed a lawsuit in Manhattan's state Supreme Court claiming Joel and Sony Music owed him over 10 years worth of royalty payments. DeVitto has never been given songwriting credit on any of Joel's songs. DeVitto's lawyer added that he does not know exactly how much DeVitto is owed, and that Joel's record sales are subject to an audit. In April 2010, it was announced that Joel and DeVitto \\"amicably resolved\\" the lawsuit. =Philanthropy= In 2003, DeVitto signed on as an official supporter of Little Kids Rock, a nonprofit organization that provides free musical instruments and instruction to children in underserved public schools throughout the United States. DeVitto has personally delivered instruments to children in the program, performed at benefit events for the cause and sits on the organization's Honorary Board of Directors. =Personal life= Liberty DeVitto is the father of four daughters, Devon (b. 1980), actress and model Torrey DeVitto (b. 1984), Maryelle (b. 1988) and Mae Elizabeth Josephine on 11 February 2017.

She holds three top songwriting awards including the Kerrville New Folk Competition's Best New Folk Award, Boston Music Award for Outstanding Folk Act, and Grand Prize in the John Lennon Songwriting Contest. Biography Duvekot moved to Delaware at the age of 13. Duvekot writes songs that are often profound and personal, and she frequently records and performs with little accompaniment besides her acoustic guitar. She began recording music on her own at the age of cassette tapes for her friends. At 18 she won the first open mic competition she entered, at the Sam Adams Brewpub in Philadelphia. Within a year, she had recorded a number of songs on a borrowed 4-Track tape machine, and released a self-produced full-length cassette entitled Waterstains\\" which she sold at gigs in and around Newark, Delaware, where she had attended the University of Delaware. In 2000, her song \\"Soma\\" won the grand prize in the rock category of the John Lennon Songwriting Contest. Duvekot often tours with Ellis Paul, who sings on her first studio album, Big Dream Boulevard. Big Dream Boulevard was produced by S√©amus Egan of the Irish-American band Solas. Solas has previously recorded five of Duvekot's songs: \\"Black Annis,\\" \\"The Poisonjester's Mask,\\" \\"Erin,\\" \\"Reasonland,\\" and \\"Merry Go Round.\\" Duvekot's first two albums, Little Peppermints and Boys, Flowers, Miles, are based on recordings of live performances, although some tracks include studio overdubs as well. Both albums include spoken anecdotes from Duvekot. In 2007, Duvekot's song \\"Merry-Go-Round\\" was featured a large- scale marketing campaign for Bank of America, including a high-profile spot during Super Bowl XLI. Duvekot performed for the first time as a professional in Europe, in August 2007, as part of Denmark's Tonder Festival, accompanied by Karan Casey, John Doyle, Liz Carroll, Julie Fowlis, and Mick McAuley. Duvekot released her second studio CD, The Near Demise of the Highwire Dancer, on Black Wolf Records in March 2009. The album, which features 11 tracks, most of them originals, was produced by singer-songwriter Richard Shindell. Duvekot's latest album, Toward the Thunder, is her fourth full-length studio album featuring 11 tracks. The album is her most personal to date and she handled all aspects of the record herself, including designing the cover.

The hunting strategy that a hunter uses depends on the species of wildlife being pursued, the climate, terrain, and local hunting laws where they hunter is going to be hunting. Some of the most common hunting methods that are used include: still hunting, stand hunting, calling, baiting, and hunting with dogs.  Still Hunting  Still hunting is a common method of hunting used to hunt North American big game species such as deer, elk, bear, and feral hogs. Still hunting is the process of hunting an animal by sneaking into habitats where the animal lives and trying to spot the animal before the animal spots you. The still hunting method of hunting is not the most popular hunting technique because it takes a fair amount of skill and time. Still hunting is an ancient method of hunting that was used by our ancestors to hunt and kill animals to eat. Still hunting is done by tracking animals down by looking for their tracks, droppings, mating signs, etc. and following this sign very carefully. When following the animal sign it is important to walk very slowly and very quietly while constantly scanning for movement and wildlife. It is also important to stop frequently to watch and listen for wildlife around you. Wind direction is another important aspect of still hunting because if the wind is blowing in the direction that you are walking, it is likely that the animal that you are hunting will smell you and scurry before you ever come into contact with the animal.  Stand Hunting  Stand hunting is likely the most common form of hunting used today when hunting for most North American big game species. Stand hunting is when the hunter is stationary in one location and waits for the animal to come to them. Hunters often use tree-stands, ground blinds, and tripod stands to make the hunt more comfortable and to make it harder for the wildlife to spot them. The locations where hunters chose to stand hunt varies greatly. Often hunters will set up a stand near a food source that their target animal species is coming to for food. Hunters will also stand hunt along game trails, and even near water sources in drier climates. The stand hunting method is also the fundamental method used when using baiting, and often calling hunting methods. = Calling = The technique of calling can be a very effective hunting technique. Calling is the process of using game calls or some other instrument to replicate the sounds of the animal that you are hunting. Game calls are especially effective during the desired species' mating season. During this time, animal mating calls can be a sure fire way to lure in an animal that is within earshot of you. The most common calls used when hunting deer are grunt calls, bleat calls, and rattling antlers. The grunt call can be aggressive buck grunts that would attract a buck that is looking to display his dominance, while bleat calls mimic the sound of a doe that is looking for a buck to breed her. Rattling antlers imitate the sound of two bucks fighting and can lure other bucks in to see what the commotion is all about. = Baiting = While baiting is an extremely popular and very effective way to encounter various species of wildlife, it is important to check local game laws to ensure that baiting is legal in the area. While most places allow baiting, some areas still deem it illegal to bait wildlife. Baiting is pretty simple and is just the act of using an artificial food source that is placed near your hunting stand to attract the species of animal that is being pursued. Some common baits that are used to attract big game in North America are things such as dried field corn, apples, salt, minerals, and even processed foods such as peanut butter and molasses. Hunting strategies include: *Baiting is the use of decoys, lures, scent or food to attract targeted animals. *Blind or Stand hunting is waiting for animals in a concealed or elevated position. *Calling is the use of noises to attract or drive animals. *Camouflage is concealing oneself visually, or with scent, to blend in with the environment. *Dogs may be used to help flush, herd, drive, track, point at, pursue, or retrieve animals. *Game drive system was a prehistoric hunting strategy where game were herded into areas where they could be hunted in groups. *Driving is the herding of animals in a particular direction, as over a cliff or to other hunters. *Flushing is the practice of scaring targets from concealed areas. *Spotlighting is the use of artificial light to find or blind targets before capture. Modern lighting also includes IR and other devices. *Scouting consists of a variety of tasks and techniques for finding animals to hunt. *Stalking is the practice of walking stealthily, often in pursuit of an identified animal. *Tracking is the practice of interpreting physical evidence to pursue animals. *Trapping is the use of devices (e.g., snares, pits, deadfalls) to capture or kill an animal.

The firm operated from 1972 until 1996, with some stores lasting until 1999. History Texas Homecare was established in 1972, by Manny, Sydney and Gerald Fogel, who had previously founded the high street specialist paint and wallpaper chain Home Charm. Taking their lead from America, they revolutionised the market of DIY in the United Kingdom, with the introduction of the 'DIY Shed' style outlet. Mervyn Fogel, co founder and managing director for over twenty five years, had a vision of turning the small family business into a retail empire for DIY. Texas specialised in higher volume, lower margin DIY products. The company had been adversely affected by a recession and depressed housing market. Ladbrokes officially acquired the chain in April 1986, which they sold within nine years. =Acquisition= In January 1995, Ladbrokes put the firm up for sale. Later in the month, Sainsbury's bought out Texas Homecare, and with its acquisition, Homebase hoped to hold around 10% of the total DIY market in the United Kingdom. In May 1995, however, it was announced that only twenty six stores of Texas were to close, with limited redundancies. Sainsbury's found that full conversion to the Homebase format was an investment worth making, and allowed ¬£50 million for the task. By the time of the purchase, Texas had staff totaling 11,600, and Homebase had 4,500. These stores were rebranded, and redesigned to the format of Homebase, the first to be converted being in Longwell Green, Bristol in February 1996. A few other stores were sold off to other retailers; including the store in Merry Hill in the West Midlands, which closed in 1995, which was then split between PC World and Currys. The last sixty stores of Texas Homecare were converted to Homebase in 1999, and the name Texas vanished from high streets, shopping malls and retail parks. In August 2000, the former chief executive of Texas Homecare, Ron Trenter, made an unprecedented bid for Homebase, which was sold off within four months. =Advertising= In its early years, Texas was famous for its television advertising slogan: Texas ‚Äî THE BIG ONE!. In later years, Texas used the fictional character, named Texas Tom, in its advertising. During the beginning of the 1990s, this campaign was altered slightly to refer to Tom's Place: Only at Tom's Place!.

It was formed in 1930 in Cicero, Illinois as a successor to the American Conference of Undenominational Churches. It adopted its current name in 1996. Membership It has nearly 1000 churches located largely in the United States and up to three times that number of associated churches in 26 countries outside the U.S. It also has over 1100 individual members: pastors, missionaries, professors, church planters, chaplains, and other vocational Christian workers. In the U.S there are five member colleges, 11 home mission agencies, and 12 church planting agencies. It also has 8 foreign mission agencies ministering outside the U.S. Beliefs It sees its roots in the rejection of theological modernism and the reaffirmation of the traditional, fundamental doctrines that it believes to underlie Biblical Christianity: Biblical inerrancy, the Virgin Birth of Christ, the substitutionary atonement of Christ, the literal resurrection of Christ, the Second Coming of Christ, the eternal joy of those who are redeemed by the blood of Christ through the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit, and the eternal judgment of those who are unredeemed. It also holds to the Pretribulational Rapture of the Church and the Premillennial Return of Christ to establish His 1000-year reign on earth before the eternal state. The shift to the use of initials rather than its original name reflects a rejection of much of what is currently described by the label fundamentalist Gregory & Gregory (2005), p. 172 and a rejection of any nationalist focus rather than a softening of its message. Nonetheless, it is doctrinally quite conservative, strongly rejecting ecumenism and what it construes as liberalism within Christianity. =Purpose statement= The IFCA International purpose statement is: \\"Enhancing the strength of the Church by equipping for, and encouraging toward, ministry partnerships to accomplish Great Commission objectives.\\" Its organizational ambition is to become healthy churches who work together. =Core values= There are five IFCA International core values: Biblical Doctrine (contemporary importance of the historic Fundamentals) + Biblical Leadership (Christ-like integrity, humility, zeal, and sacrifice) + Biblical Outreach (evangelism at home and abroad) + Biblical Partnerships (accomplishing more together than separately) + Biblical Excellence (doing the best possible for God's glory). Organizational structure IFCA International establishes an organizational structure to coordinate and encourage joint participation in ministry activities. IFCA International provides this while guaranteeing the autonomy of congregational government.

He was convicted in Indonesia for drug trafficking as a member of the Bali Nine. In 2005, Nguyen was arrested in a room at the Melasti Hotel in Kuta together with three others. Police uncovered of heroin in a suitcase in the room. After a criminal trial, on 15 February 2006 Nguyen was sentenced to life imprisonment. His appeal to the Indonesian Supreme Court to have the sentence reduced suffered a shock when the Supreme Court imposed the death penalty on 6 September 2006. A subsequent appeal to the Indonesian Supreme Court, following a full confession by Nguyen of his role in the plan to import heroin from Bali to Australia, resulted in the original sentence of life imprisonment being reinstated. Some media reports claimed Nguyen was believed to be a financer of the smuggling plan. An Indonesian justice ministry official announced on 5 June 2018 that Nguyen had died of stomach cancer on 9 May. Trafficking conspiracy Media reports based on the testimony of co-conspirator, Renae Lawrence, claim that Nguyen (going by the alias of David), from Wellington Point in Brisbane, Queensland, had arranged an earlier attempt at trafficking from Indonesia to Australia. This attempt in December 2004 involved Lawrence, Andrew Chan, Matthew Norman and others. The delivery was aborted when heroin suppliers failed to deliver \\"due to a financial matter or someone knowing about the plan the shipment was cancelled\\". Further media reports, again based on court testimonies, claim that Nguyen met Michael Czugaj and Scott Rush (both Brisbane school friends) in a pub in Fortitude Valley where Nguyen reportedly offered Rush and Czugaj an all-expenses-paid trip to Bali. Arriving in Bali on or about 8 April 2005, Rush and Czugaj met co-ringleaders Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan at the Hard Rock Hotel, and also Renae Lawrence and Martin Stephens. On 14 April, Norman, Si Yi Chen, Lawrence and Stephens checked into Adhi Dharma hotel in Bali, with Nguyen arriving in the same hotel two days later. In the evening of Sunday 17 April, acting like tourists, Nguyen, Norman, and Chen checked into the Melasti Hotel. Myuran Sukumaran, who was also with them, with his bags, left them with the others as he decided to go to the Hard Rock Hotel complex. All were later convicted of drug trafficking as fellow members of the Bali Nine. =Arrest in Indonesia= Approximately 20 minutes after checking in, Nguyen was arrested at the Melasti Hotel in Kuta on 17 April 2005 with Matthew Norman, Myuran Sukumaran and Si Yi Chen. Indonesian police claim the group were in possession of of heroin and bundles of plastic wrapping, Elastoplast tape, and a set of scales, indicating involvement in a plan to transport drugs to Australia. Earlier that day at Ngurah Rai International Airport in Denpasar, Indonesian police also arrested the following drug mules after they were found carrying various amounts of heroin concealed on their bodies. Martin Stephens was found to be carrying ; Renae Lawrence was found to be carrying ; Michael Czugaj was found to be carrying and Scott Rush was found to be carrying of heroin. Co-ringleader Andrew Chan was also arrested the same day while seated on an Australian Airlines flight waiting to depart Denpasar for Sydney. At the time of his arrest, Chan was carrying three mobile phones and a boarding pass. No drugs were found in his possession. =Criticism of Australian Federal Police tipoff= Lee Rush, the father of Scott Rush, a fellow member of the Bali Nine, said that he contacted the Australian Federal Police (AFP) prior to the commission of the offence, fearing his son was travelling to Bali and would commit a drug-related crime. Rush senior claims then to have received assurances from the AFP that they would tell his son he was under surveillance to dissuade him from going through with the crime before the group's departure from Indonesia. Scott Rush's lawyers said he was never contacted. It was revealed that the AFP alerted Indonesian police that a crime was to be committed approximately two weeks before the arrests, and had commenced an investigation about ten weeks prior to the arrests. When the Bali Nine were arrested, the news of the tipoff became public and there was criticism of the role of the AFP in protecting the interests of Australian citizens. Commenting on the matter at the time, AFP Commissioner Mick Keelty was reported as saying: Rush took action in the Federal Court of Australia against the AFP for breach of the bilateral treaty between Indonesia and Australia when information was handed by the AFP to the Indonesians. Rush's case claimed that such information should only be released by the Attorney- General. However, the Commonwealth Government maintained that the treaty only applies after a suspect is charged. The application was dismissed by the Federal Court in January 2006. Criminal trial Criminal trials for the accused commenced in the Denpasar District Court on 11 October 2005. Chen, Nguyen, and Norman, all arrested at the Melasti Hotel and earning the epithet, The Melasti Three, were tried together, with the remaining six defendants tried separately. In December 2005, it was reported that tensions were building between the Bali Nine drug mules and Sukumaran and Chan. Several days later, lawyers acting for some members of the Bali Nine initially sought the support of the Director of Public Prosecutions to intervene and lay charges for conspiracy to import drugs, so that the nine could be extradited and charged under Australian law. However, the judges hearing the trial matters in Bali called on Australia not to interfere in Indonesia's right to impose capital punishment;. Lawyers acting for Stephens, one of the Bali Nine, claimed that the fairness of his trial was in jeopardy following comments made in the media by Indonesian Foreign Minister Hassan Wirajuda that Australians should be prepared for members of the Bali Nine to receive a death sentence, if found guilty. During his trial, Nguyen was accused of both recruiting members and financing the drug importation scheme. Czugaj, since convicted, stated that he travelled to Bali, with school friend Scott Rush, after Rush introduced him to Nguyen. Their reason for travel was that Nguyen offered them both a free holiday to Bali. When asked why he chose to travel to Bali on a paid holiday, Rush replied: :\\"Basically we got the response that [Nguyen] didn't have anyone to come to Bali with him\\". Nguyen refused to testify; Czugaj confirmed Rush's account of events as being true. =Sentencing and appeal= During his final plea to judges, Nguyen said: On 15 February 2006, Nguyen was sentenced to life imprisonment. Commenting on the sentences at the time, Australian Federal Police Commissioner Keelty stated: The Australian Prime Minister John Howard was reported as commenting: Appealing against the sentence, on 6 September 2006, his sentence was upgraded to the death penalty. On 5 March 2008, three judges in the Indonesian Supreme Court in Jakarta decided to spare the lives of Nguyen, Chen, and Norman. Prison life After initially serving time in Bali's Kerobokan Prison, in 2014 Nguyen and Stephens were transferred to a prison in Malang, East Java when it was reported that they had violated prison rules. Death Nguyen died from cancer on 9 May 2018 in a Jakarta hospital, aged 34, confirmed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.

Although Little Walter had been recording sporadically for small Chicago labels over the previous five years, and had appeared on Muddy Waters' records for Chess Records since 1950, \\"Juke\\" was Little Walter's first hit, and it was the most important of his career. Due to the influence of Little Walter on blues harmonica, \\"Juke\\" is now considered a blues harmonica standard. Recording In May 1952, Little Walter had been a regular member of the Muddy Waters Band for at least three years. \\"Juke\\" was recorded on 12 May 1952 at the beginning (not the end, as commonly thought) of a recording session with Muddy Waters and his band, which at the time consisted of Waters and Jimmy Rogers on guitars, and Elga Edmunds on drums, in addition to Little Walter on harmonica. The originally released recording of \\"Juke\\" was the first completed take of the first song attempted at the first Little Walter session for Leonard Chess; the song was released as a single at the end of July on Chess's subsidiary label Checker RecordsChecker Records no. 758 The song was recorded by recording engineer Bill Putnam at his Universal Recorders studio at 111 E. Ontario St., on the near north side of Chicago. (Coincidentally, several years earlier Putnam had recorded one of the few other harmonica instrumentals ever to become a hit record, \\"Peg O' My Heart\\" by The Harmonicats.) After recording two takes of \\"Juke\\" (the second, vastly different alternate take finally being issued for the first time over 40 years later), at the same session Little Walter recorded \\"Can't Hold On Much Longer\\", which took considerably more takes than \\"Juke\\" to complete. After the completion of Little Walter's recordings, Muddy Waters recorded his only song that day, \\"Please Have Mercy\\", backed by Little Walter and the band. Composition \\"Juke\\" is played as a swinging shuffle featuring a boogie- woogie guitar pattern, and is originally in the key of E; Walter played it in \\"second position\\" (cross harp) on a harmonica tuned to the key of A. \\"Juke\\" is a standard twelve-bar blues, set for the most part in the time signature of 4/4, but its time changes once to 3/4 and once to 2/4. \\"Juke\\" contains eight choruses. The harmonica playing in \\"Juke\\" is deep-toned and features long saxophone-like phrases. \\"Juke\\" is a dynamic song, building and releasing in intensity several times. The opening eight bars of the song, or \\"head\\", consist of a repeated six note phrase commonly and frequently played by jazz and swing horn players in the 1930s and 1940s. The much-studied and debated head that opens \\"Juke\\" was used most notably in Louis Armstrong's 1941 recording \\"Leap Frog\\", an instrumental that was recorded later in the 1940s by several other artists, but the exact source of Little Walter's inspiration is unknown. The remainder of the song is an improvisation of Little Walter's own invention. \\"Juke\\" was originally titled on the recording session log as \\"Your Pat Will Play\\"; later it was discovered that this was a mistake, a mis-hearing of Little Walter's intended title, \\"Your Cat Will Play\\". The song was renamed \\"Juke\\" upon release in July 1952, probably by label owner Leonard Chess. Junior Wells later claimed that he was playing \\"Juke\\" prior to Little Walter's recording of it, although Wells never recorded his version. Snooky Pryor's 1948 recording \\"Snooky and Moody's Boogie,\\" begins with the same repeated ascending riff that Little Walter uses in the first eight bars of \\"Juke\\", although the remainder is distinctly different. (Pryor himself claimed in an interview that Walter \\"picked up 'Snooky and Moody's Boogie' and made 'Juke' out of it.\\")\\"I Started the Big Noise Around Chicago\\" ‚Äì an interview with Snooky Prior by Jim O'Neal, Steve Wisner, and David Nelson, Living Blues #123 (Sept./Oct. 1995), pp. 14-15. Jimmy Rogers, guitarist on \\"Juke\\", claimed that parts of \\"Juke\\" were based on an unrecorded intermission/theme song frequently played by piano player Sunnyland Slim, which he called \\"Get Up the Stairs Madamoiselle\\". Successes In an apparent acknowledgement of Little Walter's unique instrumental skills, the instrumental \\"Juke\\" was promoted as the A-side of the single, with the vocal \\"Can't Hold On Much Longer\\" as the B-side. Within weeks of its release, \\"Juke\\" had reached the number-one spot on Billboard's R&B; chart, unheard of for a harmonica instrumental; no other harmonica instrumental has ever achieved this position, before or since. \\"Juke\\" was not only a major success for Little Walter, it was the biggest hit record by any artist for Chess or any of its associated labels up until that time, and only the third Chess record to hit number one. Juke stayed in the top spot for eight weeks, surpassing both previous Chess number one hits, which had occupied the position for a combined total of six weeks. The record stayed on the Billboard charts for a total of 20 weeks, and was one of the biggest R&B; hits in the U.S. in 1952. Impact The hit song launched Little Walter's successful solo career, and he immediately left the Muddy Waters band to form his own band, which was initially known as \\"The Jukes\\" in order to capitalize on the success of his hit single. Beginning with the massive success of Juke, Little Walter would go on to eclipse the chart success of his former boss Muddy Waters through the rest of the 1950s. Juke became the most important and influential song for blues harmonica players of the era, and was expected to be in the repertoire of any serious blues harmonica player; at least in Chicago, blues harmonica players were judged on their ability to play it. In addition, Juke popularized the Chicago blues harmonica technique still in use today by harmonica players around the world: using a small hand-held microphone cupped to the harmonica to produce a dynamic, rich and slightly distorted amplified harmonica sound. Recognition On December 19, 2007, the Recording Academy announced that it was inducting Little Walter's recording of \\"Juke\\" into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008, as a song that \\"exemplify[s] the best qualities that make the recording arts such a vital part of our culture ‚Äì and each not only uniquely reflects the zeitgeist of its time, but also possesses the enduring power of transcending time.\\" In 1986, \\"Juke\\" was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in the \\"Classics of Blues Recordings ‚Äì Singles or Album Tracks\\" category. Writing for the Foundation, blues historian O'Neal noted: \\"Other Chicago harmonicists had played similar tunes... but it was Walter who made it into a masterpiece, ushering in a new sound with his swooping, amplified attack.\\" \\"Juke\\" has been recorded by Big Walter Horton, James Cotton, Billy Branch, Paul Butterfield and Carey Bell, among others.

Origins The de Ferriers family is believed to have originated at the manor of Ferri√®res-Saint-Hilaire in the southern marches of the Duchy of Normandy and had previously protected the duchy from the hostility of the Counts of Maine and Anjou. With the union of the domains of Anjou and Normandy in 1144, and the investment of Geoffrey V Plantagenet as Duke of Normandy, most of this land lost its strategic importance. Walchelin was the son of Henry de Ferrieres, a nephew of Robert de Ferrers, 1st Earl of Derby and a son of either Enguenulf or William. Like his father, Walchelin held the castles of Ferri√®res-Saint-Hilaire and Chambray for the service of 5 knights. He held lands equating to 42 3/4 Knight's fees. In England, Walchelin held the manors of Oakham in Rutland and Lechlade in Gloucestershire. He is known to have held these lands since at least 1172. Ceremonial horse-shoes on the walls of Oakham Castle in honour of the de Ferrers family The cognizance or proto-heraldic device of the family was a horse-shoe, a play on the Latin word ferrarius meaning a \\"worker in iron\\" (ferrum) thus a black-smith or farrier. Thus originated the custom, still current today, of the affixing of ceremonial horse-shoes on the walls of the great hall of Oakham Castle to commemorate the visit of a peer or royal. After the start of the age of heraldry (circa 1200-1215), branches of the Ferrers family adopted horse-shoes as charges in their coats of arms.For example the Ferrers family of Bere Ferrers in Devon, see Career During the Third Crusade, he and his son and heir, Henry, served in the force of Richard I of England. A John de Ferrieres, believed to be a nephew, was also present. Walchelin had stayed with the King in Sicily. It is apparent that Walchelin was one of the king's counselors. He and his knights arrived at Saint-Jean d'Acre sometime in April or June 1191. Some months previously, William de Ferrers, 3rd Earl of Derby, his second cousin, had been killed at the Siege of Acre. After the conclusion of the siege, King Richard and Hugh III of Burgundy marched their forces south to the city of Jaffa. Along the route, several skirmishes broke out between the crusaders and the Saracen army marching in parallel under Saladin. On 7 September 1191, the great battle of Arsuf was fought. Richard had made Walchelin a commander of one of the elite bodies of knights, according to the chronicle attributed to Geoffrey de Vinsauf. Later, in 1194, Richard was imprisoned for ransom in Germany. Walchelin brought the treasure of Normandy to Speyer and gave himself as a hostage (along with many others) to the Western Emperor Henry VI. He was freed from captivity in about 1197. His sons Henry and Hugh managed his estates during the years he spent in prison. Sometime prior to his death, the younger son, Hugh was granted lordship of the manor of Lechlade. Death & succession Walchelin died in 1201 and was succeeded by his son, Henry. Henry sided with King John of England over King Philip II of France until December 1203 when John left Normandy, never to return. At this point, Henry did homage to King Philip for his Norman lands. Hugh had left England and the care of Lechlade and Oakham went to his sister, Isabella, who was married to Roger de Mortimer of Wigmore. After her death, the land escheated to the crown as Terra Normanorum.

As a member of the Mutant Liberation Front, Forearm has always been a mainstay on the terrorist group's roster, even staying through leader changes and incarceration. Publication history Forearm has a minor cameo appearance (nothing but his two right arms are seen, and only in one panel) as a member of the Mutant Liberation Front in New Mutants #86, as Rob Liefeld took over as the penciller of the series. This was immediately followed by his first full appearance in New Mutants #87. Fictional character biography Forearm was one of the founding members of the terrorist organization known as the Mutant Liberation Front (or MLF). One of their first missions under the leadership of Stryfe was to liberate the incarcerated New Mutants members Rusty and Skids. They broke them out of prison and the pair joined the MLF out of confusion (and, as later evidence showed, neural implants kept them there).The New Mutants #87 (March 1990) Forearm continued to be a mainstay in the team's ventures, including fighting Wolverine, Sunfire, and X-Factor.X-Factor #77 (1992) Under the leadership of Cable the New Mutants became the paramilitary organization known as X-Force, and began to be more aggressive in their campaigns. In one such mission X-Force discovers a hidden MLF base and, while fighting Forearm, Reaper and other members of the team, nearly lose their lives when Stryfe orders the destruction of the base. Later, Garrison Kane stumbles upon Forearm, Wildside, and Sumo in the Canadian mountains and, after a brief scuffle, follows them through their teleportation portal, where he is tortured. After a series of supposedly unconnected art thefts (all of which are related to Apocalypse), Forearm is one of the few members of the MLF to approach Mister Sinister and propose a trade. In exchange for a genetic matrix (none other than the Legacy Virus which Stryfe owned), Sinister would hand over the captive Cyclops and Jean Grey. These events begin the X-Cutioner's Song crossover.\\"X-Force\\" Vol1 #16 In the end, all of the MLF members are taken into custody- Forearm is defeated by Psylocke and Boomer working in tandem. Soon after, a tyrannical despot named Reignfire decides to restart the MLF. He breaks Forearm, Reaper, Wildside, and Tempo out of prison, and gives them their first mission: capture Henry Peter Gyrich. The MLF also picks up new members Locus and Moonstar.X-Force #27 (1993) During the initial kidnap, Forearm is wounded by the self-described 'biosentry', Hardaway who is employed by Gyrich.X-Force #27 (Oct '93) The other team members kill the man. The fact that Hardaway had been altered so much in order to battle mutants only serves to further enrage Forearm. Their mission is foiled by X-Force. During the battle Locus and Sunspot become lost, but Feral defects to the MLF after having a heated discussion with Gyrich. The team leaves and is taught teamwork by Moonstar, as, at the time, their ranks are once again down to four‚ÄîMoonstar, Wildside, Forearm, and Feral. During this time Forearm and Moonstar begin to form a close friendship, as she sees something in him that is different from the other members of the terrorist outfit. During the time Moonstar was part of the team, Forearm ends up battling forces from the other-dimensional realm of Asgard, which had appeared due to Moonstar's history with the realm. Sometime later Reignfire begins to hunt down his followers, taking Wildside and Forearm out first. All would have been lost if not for X-Force and Locus teleporting in to stop the madman. Next the MLF travel to Muir Island where they mean to steal the Legacy Virus data from Moira MacTaggert. While there, they learn about the Xavier Protocols, which they decide to try to steal. They are confronted by members of the super-team Excalibur. If not for the covert efforts of Moonstar, the mission would have been a success, but instead the team teleports away. In their last appearance, the MLF once again is trying to steal data on the Legacy Virus, this time from a government institution who is trying to manufacture their own strain of the disease. They infiltrate the building and take the scientists hostage. Again, through the sabotaging efforts of Moonstar, members of X-Force manage to enter the building in an attempt to stop them. However, three of the scientists reveal themselves to be Prime Sentinels and begin to attack. The two groups pool their resources to try to survive, but only X-Force, Moonstar and Forearm manage to escape. The remaining members of the MLF are captured by operatives of Operation: Zero Tolerance. During their time together, Moonstar reveals to him that she had been an undercover agent for S.H.I.E.L.D. meant to infiltrate the organization and feed the government information. Feeling betrayed, Forearm parts ways with the team. When he surfaced next Forearm was part of a fighting championship in Madripoor called Bloodsport where superpowered opponents fight to the death. However, Forearm was killed during a fight with Serpent Society member Anaconda, who broke his neck.Wolverine (Vol2) #167 Powers and abilities Forearm had an extra set of arms that extend from beneath his first set, giving him four arms (hence the name). In addition to this, he also had increased strength, resistance to injury, and stamina. Cable and Warpath have both stated that Forearms' strength has increased since the first time they had fought him. Nonetheless, Warpath is able to defeat him with ease after a certain point, joking about toying with \\"the boy\\". Other versions =What If?= Forearm was also featured in a What If issue that asks \\"What If Magneto Took Over the USA?\\". He is shown as a member of the MLF.

The epithet \\"Traditional\\" is also sparingly used for roughly the same sector, as in the Union for Traditional Judaism. Until the 1970s, traditional Conservative and liberal Orthodox synagogues had a substantial area of overlap, with many congregations calling themselves either Orthodox or Conservative having a similar combination of a traditional liturgy in a synagogue with mixed gender seating, together with traditional but lenient or lax personal observance among the membership. \\"Orthodox\\" and \\"Conservative\\" congregations could be almost identical in liturgy and practices, with a substantial interdenominational blurring. Changes in both the Conservative and Orthodox movements came to distinguish both more clearly, leaving an increasing gap in between. Beginning in 1973, the Conservative movement began more actively involving women in services, and following the Conservative decision to ordain women as Rabbis in 1983, ritual egalitarianism became a distinguishing characteristic of Conservative synagogues. Although a small minority of Conservative congregations continue to maintain traditional roles, the minority became very small (10% or less) by the end of the 20th century. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the Conservative movement moved leftward on a variety of liturgical and social issues, shortening services, changing the traditional liturgy, developing new rules for women, and supporting liberal positions on such issues as abortion, homosexuality, public religion displays, and more. More traditional Conservative synagogues became an ever-shrinking minority. On the Orthodox side, in the 1980s, the Orthodox Union, the principal Modern Orthodox organization of synagogues, began requiring member synagogues which previously had mixed seating to build a mechitza with separate seating for men and women or de-affiliate, thus creating an irreconcilable physical distinction between the most liberal OU synagogues and the most traditional Conservative ones. As of 2005, \\"Beth Midrash Hagadol-Beth Joseph [of Denver, Colorado] remains the only synagogue in the country affiliated with the OU to have mixed seating. In addition, social trends in Judaism and in the larger society have reflected an increased rightward trend in Orthodoxy, including Modern, on matters of both ritual and social outlook. The Haredi segment, which believes in separation from secular culture and in a pronounced distinction between men and women has had increasing influence.Chaim L. Waxman, Winners and Losers in Denominational Memberships in the United States, Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs. As a result, those who a generation ago could feel comfortable in either an Orthodox or a Conservative setting, have become increasingly isolated from both as the gap between the two has widened. This trend has resulted in attempts to experiment in new organizations and liturgical styles at both the right of Conservatism and the left of Orthodoxy to appeal to this constituency. \\"Conservadox Jews\\" are largely a North American phenomenon, although similar trends can be identified in Israel and Europe. Congregations of a \\"Conservadox\\" persuasion have formed affiliations such as the Union for Traditional Judaism in the United States and the Canadian Council of Conservative Synagogues.

The main line through the town was the Woodhead route of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway between Sheffield Victoria and Manchester, London Road. The line was heavily graded with a summit some 400 yards inside the eastern portal of the Woodhead tunnel. Cattle Drover's Neglect, 1845 During a parliamentary committee meeting to debate the building of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, George Stephenson was asked if it would not be awkward should a train hit a cow. His now classic reply, given in his broad Northumbrian dialect, was to state \\"Oo, ay, very awkward for the COO!\\".Allen, chapter 2 On the evening of 6 October 1845 this assumption was dramatically put to the test. Shortly after leaving Dunford Bridge the Sheffield bound train struck a cow, which a drover from Penistone market had been unable to remove from the line. The impact caused the locomotive and carriages to derail and the cow was killed instantly. Such was the force of the accident that the cow was almost entirely cut in half.Dow vol. 1, p.52 None of the passengers suffered any injuries other than some minor bruising, although the guard was more severely injured. A replacement train was dispatched from Sheffield and the passengers all completed their journey by two o'clock the following morning.Illustrated London News, 11 October 1845 Bullhouse Bridge accident, 1884 The first major accident occurred on 16 July 1884, a few miles to the west of the town, near Bullhouse Colliery. The accident is often referred to as being at \\"Bullhouse Bridge\\", where the road to Huddersfield passes below the line. An express passenger train, the 12:30 pm from to , with through carriages for in connection with the evening steamer sailing, had left Woodhead Tunnel and was gathering speed on the downhill gradient towards Penistone. The locomotive was 4-4-0 No. 434, built at Gorton Locomotive Works.Earnshaw (1996), p.14 As it entered the curve at Bullhouse, the driver felt the engine develop an uneasy roll, but before he could apply the brakes, he heard a crack. A driving wheel axle on the locomotive had snapped, and the resulting spread of the driving wheels distorted the track. The axle fracture was probably caused by metal fatigue. A Cheshire Lines Committee horsebox coupled behind the engine was derailed but remained upright. The coupling between the horsebox and the following carriages failed, and the first five GNR carriages (the London portion of the train) ran off the rails and down the embankment on the outside of the curve. The last five MS&L; carriages (the Grimsby portion) were also derailed but suffered less damage. Nineteen passengers were killed at the scene. Five more later died in hospital, the last on 6 August. Many of the dead were womenDow vol. 2, pp.199‚Äì200 and the toll also included railway mechanical engineer Massey Bromley. The Inspector's report allowed that the accident \\"could not have been foreseen or prevented\\". It did however question, among other matters, the use of inside cranked axles, and the use of iron rather than steel for these important components. Barnsley Junction accident, 1885 The second unfortunate incident took place on the other side of Penistone Station, between Huddersfield Junction and Barnsley Junction, within six months. On 1 January 1885 a special excursion train from stations in the Sheffield area to Liverpool (9 coaches) and Southport (9 coaches) was climbing towards Penistone. At the same time a train of empty coal wagons travelling in the opposite direction to return the wagons to collieries in South Yorkshire and North Nottinghamshire was descending the gradient and had just passed the Huddersfield Junction signal box when one of the wagons derailed. The driver of the locomotive applied his brakes and this wagon, Shireoaks No. 218, jumped forward and became buffer-locked with the wagon in front, Shireoaks No. 1, which also came off the rails, and struck the locomotive of the excursion. The wagon was brushed aside by the locomotive but rebounded after the first four of the excursion's carriages passed. The fifth, sixth and seventh carriages were wrecked and the following three were brought off the track. One person was killed in the accident and two others died as a result of amputations. On examination, Shireoaks No. 218 wagon was found to have a fractured axle with two flaws in the metal, a problem again caused by metal fatigue. Unexpected catastrophic failure of axles (and wheels) was a problem on all railway vehicles at the time, owing to the lack of understanding of the causes, especially fatigue crack initiation and growth. Crack initiation was usually caused either by defects or poor design, with stress concentrations raising the local stress to failure. The small crack so created would then grow slowly under repeated loading from usage until the axle could no longer withstand imposed loads. (It was noted that the day of the Barnsley Junction accident was very cold and the ballast under the railway sleepers was frozen, increasing the loads on the wheels and axles.) Although the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire railway could not be held directly responsible for this accident, the enquiry recommended more thorough inspection of all rolling stock.Dow vol. 2, pp.200,202 Huddersfield Junction accident, 1889 The next serious accident occurred four years later on 30 March 1889. This was the day of the F.A. Cup Final. Preston North End, then considered the best team in the country, were due to play Wolverhampton Wanderers at Kennington Oval, and the University Boat Race was to take place over the Thames Tideway between Putney and Mortlake in London. The Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway ran an excursion with portions from Liverpool, Southport and Wigan to London, Kings Cross. Although it was not intended as a football excursion, many people from Lancashire took advantage of it to watch Preston play. The Southport portion of the train was joined to the main train from Liverpool at Warrington Central and the Wigan portion was picked up at Glazebrook. The completed train made its way over the Cheshire Lines Committee tracks to Godley Junction where a stop was made for Railway Clearing House checks. It departed 55 minutes late. The locomotive was Class 23 No. 188, a six-coupled locomotive, which was usually to be found on goods workings, but was regularly used on excursion traffic. The train ran down the gradient towards Penistone station when the locomotive, having no leading wheels to guide it, jumped the points where the goods line diverged from the main line on the approach to the Huddersfield Junction signal box. The locomotive crew stood by their posts and applied the brakes. The coaches followed the locomotive into the \\"six-foot\\" ripping up some 25 yards of track. The tender capsized and became entangled in signal wires, the locomotive dug into the ballast and the front coach was totally smashed. Coaches two and three toppled onto their sides and the following three which were pulled round in different directions were left standing broadside against the first pair. One person was killed and many injured.Dow vol. 2, p.205 Those with minor injuries were treated at Penistone Station, those with more severe injuries were taken to the Wentworth Arms Hotel, opposite the bottom of the station approach road, where the billiard room was turned into an operating theatre. A further crash was averted by the prompt action of the signalman in Huddersfield Junction box. Having witnessed the crash he sent the message to Barnsley Junction, the next box on the Sheffield side, to \\"Stop the Mail\\", but the 10:40 pm King's Cross to Manchester Mail had already passed by. He set all his signals against the train and the driver applied his brakes but it could not stop before hitting the tender of the crashed locomotive. The Mail train's buffers penetrated the plating of the tender and the bogie wheels were thrown off the track, but the engine did not reach the crashed coaches. The Railway Inspectorate found that the leading axle of the locomotive had fractured and questioned both the use of a \\"goods locomotive\\" on passenger work, where they would travel at higher speeds than usual, and the locomotive having no leading bogie wheels.

The through coach to Huddersfield, conveyed on the 5:30 pm King's Cross to Manchester (London Road) express was detached at Penistone and placed to await collection by the local train.

The locomotive proved impossible to recover in one piece and so was scrapped on site, and a replacement built with the same number. 2 February 1916. Probably the only accident to take place on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway line, at the Penistone end of the viaduct which takes the tracks northward from the station. A Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway 2-4-2T locomotive, No. 661, was standing when the end of the viaduct and the embankment subsided below it. The collapse was slow and the crew jumped to safety before the arch fell down. The cause of the collapse was stated to be scouring of the foundations after prolonged heavy rain; the parapet of the viaduct had been observed to be cracked some days earlier.Marshall, p. 243 27 February 1927. An avoidable accident blamed mainly on signalman's error, in which an LMS locomotive, Aspinall radial tank No. 10760, from the Huddersfield line, having arrived and discharged its passengers, needed to clear the line to allow an empty coaching stock train from Bradford to enter the station. It shunted its stock into the other LMS platform to prepare for the return working. The locomotive then needed to be turned (unnecessarily but following usual practice on the line) and worked to the opposite end of the train, a move needing quite a few backwards and forwards shunts. The final move to reach the front of his train was via the LMS \\"up\\" line, a wrong line movement which started on the LNER line as this was the only route available to reach his train. The driver made this last movement on his own, the fireman being sent to \\"mash\\" (brew) the tea in the porter's room. The last move was controlled by a hand signal but having given the signal, the Huddersfield Junction signalman, new on shift at 6 pm, forgot to set the points for the LMS line and the locomotive went along the main line into the station platform. The driver realised that something was wrong and stopped. On seeing the signal at the east end of the platform go \\"off\\", he thought that the signalman had realised his error and the signal was meant for him. He moved off to regain his right line, but the signal was in fact intended for the Manchester ‚Äì Marylebone express, loaded to five coaches and hauled by class D10 \\"Director\\" No.5437 \\"Prince George\\", which was approaching. Because of the speed restriction in force at Penistone, the train was easing up and the impact speed was around . The LMS driver was the most seriously hurt in the accident. His fireman jumped clear and the LNER crew were shaken. The Huddersfield Junction signalman was held to be responsible for the accident, although the LMS driver did receive a mention in the report for his breach of rules. The Inspector also referred to Rule 55(b) which provided that the fireman should go to the signalbox and remain there to remind the signalman of the presence of his train, standing on a running line. Effects on the railway The stretch of line where all these accidents occurred is among some of the bleakest scenery in the Pennines, and as none of the earlier accidents could be conveniently ascribed to human error, the superstitious had a field day. Penistone was reckoned to be an unlucky place to cross the hills.Dow vol. 2, p.202 Other bad publicity concerned the dangers of asphyxiation if a passenger train were to stall in the Woodhead Tunnels, though this was not wholly folklore. Between 1910 and 1914, there were three instances of westbound train crews being overcome by smoke in the tunnel and the driverless trains running away on the downhill gradient as far as Torside, where they were diverted into a siding fitted with a very substantial stop block.

It is about southwest of Utqiaƒ°vik, on the north side of Walakpa Bay near the mouth of the Walakpa River. The flight was described by the Associated Press as prelude to a planned Trans-Siberian flight to Moscow. The pair were flying from Fairbanks to Barrow (modern-day Utqiaƒ°vik) when they encountered fog and low visibility. Locating a hole in the fog at Walakpa Bay, they landed. They spent some time with a small party of Alaska Natives and received directions for the short distance remaining to Barrow. They were barely airborne, around , when the motor failed. The aircraft plummeted into the lagoon and overturned. It was the first fatal air accident near the city of Utqiaƒ°vik. The first monument at the site was dedicated three years after the crash and financed through nationwide public subscription. It was designed in Oklahoma, home of both Rogers and Post, and built from poured concrete. The design was essentially two cubes, the smaller atop the larger, with a pink granite memorial marker quarried near the Rogers family home in Claremore, Oklahoma. The elaborate dedication ceremonies involved a four-way CBS radio broadcast from Barrow, the United States Capitol, the Oklahoma State Capitol, and the Texas State Capitol. The second monument, built 15 years later, is a concrete obelisk consisting of four diminishing rectangular blocks, and is more slender and almost 10 feet (3 m) taller than the first monument. It was built by then 72-year-old Jesse Stubbs (November 30, 1879 ‚Äì March 14, 1960), who claimed to be a childhood friend of Rogers and arrived in Anchorage in summer 1953 intending to walk from there to Barrow, only getting as far as Fairbanks where he, and his dog Quacco, caught a plane flight for the remainder of the journey. The Stubbs monument memorializes not only Rogers and Post, but also the Alaskan veterans of World War II. Both monuments overlooked the lagoon crash site. Photos from the summer of 2017 show only the original monument still standing. The Stubbs monument was relocated to Barrow in 2016 after its location was threatened by coastal erosion. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

Activated in July 1942 during World War II, the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment participated in the Allied invasion of Sicily, later landing at Salerno, the Battle of Normandy, the Netherlands and the Battle of the Bulge. During the 1960s, the 505th was one of the units which played a role in Operation Power Pack in the Dominican Republic and later assisted local authorities during the civil disturbances which occurred within the United States. The regiment was sent to the Republic of Vietnam in 1968 during the Vietnam War. After the Vietnam War, the 505th participated in various military operations. Among them were Operation Urgent Fury, Operation Just Cause, Operation Desert Shield, Operation Desert Storm, Operation Restore Hope, Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom. The regiment's most recent engagement has been in OEF in Afghanistan. Currently its 1st and 2nd battalions are active. Both battalions are assigned to the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. History =World War II= Under the command of Colonel James M. Gavin, the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment (PIR) was activated at Fort Benning, Georgia on 6 July 1942, during World War II, as part of the U.S. Airborne Command. Colonel Gavin, then just 35, was an early airborne pioneer, who led the men of the 505th through some extremely grueling training. In early 1943, for instance, he noted in his diary, \\"In 36 hours the regiment had marched well over 50 miles, maneuvered and seized an airhead and defended it from counterattack while carrying full combat loads and living off reserve rations\\". In February 1943, the 505th was assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division, commanded by Major General Matthew Ridgway, then stationed at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. The other two regiments serving alongside the 505th were the 504th PIR and the 325th Glider Infantry Regiments, and other supporting units. In late March the 505th was visited by many distinguished political and military leaders, including, among numerous others, General George Marshall, General Henry H. Arnold, British Field Marshal Sir John Dill and Anthony Eden. British troops of the 6th Battalion, Durham Light Infantry chat with an American paratrooper of the 505th PIR in Avola, Sicily, July 11, 1943. In April, in preparation for the Allied invasion of Sicily (codenamed Operation Husky), the regiment was moved to Tunisia, in North Africa, where they completed six weeks of training. The 505th (organized into a regimental combat team with the addition of the 3rd Battalion of the 504th, along with the 376th Parachute Field Artillery Battalion and 'C' Company of the 307th Airborne Engineer Battalion temporarily attached) made its first combat jump behind enemy lines into Gela in the early hours of July 10, 1943, which was the first regimental sized combat jump in the history of the United States Army. High winds on the 505th's drop zone caused a large number of the regiment to be scattered all over the island, with up to 100 men landing in the British Eighth Army's sector. The 505th suffered heavy losses during the relatively brief campaign, including Lieutenant Colonel Arthur F. Gorham, the 1st Battalion commander, who was killed. The regiment then returned to North Africa in August for refit to absorb replacements before taking part in the assault on Salerno, on the night of September 14, where they made their second combat jump. The regiment continued to fight in the Italian Campaign, where the 505th, aided by tanks of the British 23rd Armoured Brigade, captured the city of Naples in early October, later helping the Allies breach the Volturno Line before returning to Naples for occupation duty. In October Colonel Gavin was promoted to brigadier general and became the assistant division commander (ADC) of the 82nd Airborne Division. Gavin was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Herbert F. Batcheller, formerly the regimental executive officer (XO). Soon afterwards, the 505th was pulled back to the United Kingdom, together with the rest of the 82nd Airborne Division (minus the 504th PIR) where they began training for Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of Normandy. Originally sent to Northern Ireland, the 505th went to the Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire region of England in February 1944. In the American airborne landings in Normandy in June 1944, the 505th PIR actually jumped before its scheduled \\"H-Hour\\", thus earning their motto \\"H-minus\\". Upon completing operations in the Ste. Mere-Eglise area, the unit was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation. In September 1944, the unit then participated in Operation Market Garden, in which the regiment received a second Presidential Unit Citation. The 505th later, in December 1944, fought in the Battle of the Bulge, the largest battle fought on the Western Front during World War II. By the end of the war, the 505th was awarded three foreign distinguished unit citations: the French fourrag√®re, the Netherlands Military Order of William, and the Belgium fourrag√®re. Following the German surrender in May 1945, the regiment served as part of the Allied occupation force in Berlin. Three of the five members of the 82nd Airborne Division to receive the Distinguished Service Cross twice during World War II were members of the regiment. They were the regiment's first commander, then-Colonel James M. Gavin, the 1st Battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Arthur F. Gorham and the 2nd Battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin H. Vandervoort. =Post World War II= After the war, the 505th returned to Fort Bragg, North Carolina. In 1947, the 3rd Battalion was reduced to zero strength. The separate 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion (the \\"Triple Nickles\\") the army's only all-black airborne unit, was then inactivated, and its paratroopers were reassigned to the 505th's 3rd Battalion. Soon after, its black paratroopers began to be reassigned as individuals throughout the 82nd Airborne Division, making it the first division in the U.S. Army to become fully integrated. In June 1957, the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment was reorganized and redesignated as the 505th Infantry Regiment and relieved from assignment to the 82nd. This marked the end of the era of infantry regiments as tactical units and the beginning of the Pentomic era, in which regimental numbers were used for the purpose of perpetuating lineages and honors. 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion Association patch. Effective 1 September 1957 the lineage of Company A, 505 PIR was reorganized and redesignated as HHC, 1st Airborne Battle Group, 505th Infantry, and remained assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division (organic elements concurrently constituted and activated). It was relieved on 15 January 1959 from assignment to the 82nd Airborne Division and assigned to the 8th Infantry Division in Germany as part of a rotation that saw both 1-505th and 1-504th depart the 82nd. When the Pentomic era ended, 1-504th and 1-505th were reflagged respectively as 1st and 2nd Battalions (Airborne), 509th Infantry, elements of the 1st Brigade (Airborne), 8th Infantry Division on 1 April 1963. The colors of 1-505th returned to the 82nd, where they were reorganized and redesignated on 25 May 1964 as the 1st Battalion (Airborne), 505th Infantry, an element of the 3rd Brigade. On 30 April 1965, the 3rd Brigade was alerted for combat as part of \\"Operation Power Pack\\", the defense of the Dominican Republic against communist insurgents. Within 18 hours, the first C-130 landed at San Isidro Airfield, Dominican Republic. After two months of bitter fighting, the 3rd Brigade returned to Fort Bragg, North Carolina. On 24 July 1967, the 3rd Brigade deployed to Detroit, Michigan to assist local authorities in quelling a civil disturbance. =Vietnam War= Members of Company \\"C\\", 1st Battalion, 505th Airborne Infantry board trucks after arriving at Chu Lai Air Base, 23 February 1968 Less than a year later, on 12 February 1968, the 3rd Brigade was alerted for deployment to the Republic of Vietnam in response to the Tet Offensive. Many members of the 3rd Brigade had recently returned from Vietnam and were not required, by the Army's own regulations, to return so soon if they did not wish to do so. About two-thirds of those eligible accepted transfers out of the brigade, which was back-filled from other units in the Division. The Brigade deployed on \\"temporary change of station\\" orders with the expectation that it would return to Fort Bragg after the Tet 68 emergency was resolved. When it was decided to retain the Brigade in Vietnam its status was changed to \\"permanent change of station\\" and all soldiers who had deployed with the Brigade were given the option of continuing to serve a full tour in Vietnam or to return to Fort Bragg. Most (except for junior officers and junior enlisted men) had already served at least one combat tour and opted to return to CONUS. The Brigade was then filled with replacements from across USARV and from CONUS. Most replacements were not airborne qualified and the Brigade eventually became \\"Airborne\\" in name only -- just as the 101st Airborne Division and the 1st Airborne Brigade of the 1st Cavalry Division had already done during Vietnam service. The infantry battalions assigned to the 3rd Brigade during its Vietnam tour were 1-505th, 2-505th, and 1-508th. After 22 months of fighting, the brigade had helped secure the region south of the DMZ and redeployed to Fort Bragg, North Carolina in December 1969, the only brigade of the 82d Airborne Division to participate in the Vietnam War. =Post-Vietnam= Following its return from Vietnam, the 3rd Brigade again participated in controlling civil disturbances, deploying to Washington, D.C., in May 1971 to help local and federal officials in their efforts to keep demonstrators from disrupting the daily operations of the government. In August 1980, the brigade's 1st Battalion (Airborne), 505th Infantry was alerted and deployed to conduct civil disturbance duty at Fort Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania during the Cuban refugee internment. The 1st Battalion (Airborne), 505th Infantry deployed to the Middle East in March 1982 as the first United States member unit of the Multinational Forces and Observers (MFO) in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. 1-505 PIR returned home in August 1982 from the most important peacekeeping mission in history. In October 1983, the 3d Brigade deployed to the country of Grenada to evacuate US citizens and establish a US-aligned government during Operation Urgent Fury. B Company deployed initially, and took command of the island of Carriocou north of Grenada. The remainder of 2-505 air-landed on Point Salines airfield and captured General Hudson Austin on Westerhall Point as a direct result of an airmobile block and sweep which captured General Austin holding hostages in a waterfront haven. Once surrounded, Austin sent an emissary to LTC Keith Nightingale with the message \\"Let us leave or we will kill all the hostages.\\" LTC Nightingale called in Cobra attack helicopters and sent back the message, \\"You and everyone and the house surrenders now, or else I will blow you and everyone in the house to Hell\\". General Hudson Austin capitulated at that point, thus ending the revolt. The 2-505 established bases around the rest of the island. The Battalion communications officer, Jim Adams, managed to secure the communications facility at the top of Mount Saint Catherine's and secure communications back to Fort Bragg, thereby establishing a communications links back to the Special Operations Division at Fort Bragg. In September 1989, the 2-505th PIR was tasked to serve as part of the Multi-National Forces and observers in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula ending in March 1990. In December 1989, Company A, 3rd Battalion (Airborne) and HHC 3rd Battalion 81mm Mortar Platoon (Airborne), 505th Infantry participated in Operation Just Cause and assisted in overthrowing Manuel Noriega as the leader of Panama. This marked the first combat jump for the 505th since World War II. In August 1990, the 505th was airlifted to Saudi Arabia as a part of Operation Desert Shield The ground phase of operation Desert Storm began 25 February 1991 and saw the brigade move north to conduct combat operations through the Euphrates River Valley. After eight months, the brigade had helped secure U.S. objectives and redeployed to Fort Bragg in April 1991. In March 1994 the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment was tasked to serve as part of the Multinational Force and Observers in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula. The 4th Battalion, 505th PIR, bearing the lineage of the WW II-era Company D, 505th PIR, was formed in the summer of 1994, and formally activated on 4 November 1994. Composed of 88% National Guard and Army Reserve Soldiers from 32 different states, as well as 12% Regular Army Paratroopers from the other battalions of the 505th PIR, the 4th Battalion, 505th PIR deployed to the Sinai from January 1995 through July 1995. Following its redeployment to Fort Bragg from the Sinai, the 4th Battalion was inactivated. In September 1994, the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment along with the rest of the 82d Airborne Division was alerted as part of Operation Restore Democracy. The 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment was scheduled to make a combat parachute jump, in order to help oust the military- led dictatorship and restore the democratically elected president, although Haiti had never had democracy in any form. The Division's first wave was in the air, with the 505th PIR loaded on aircraft awaiting takeoff, when the Haitian military dictator, upon learning the 82nd Airborne was on the way, agreed to step down and averted the invasion. =Operations Safe Haven and Safe Passage= In December 1994, the 2-505 Parachute Infantry Regiment, deployed as part of Operations Safe Haven and Safe Passage. The battalion deployed from Fort Bragg while on Division Ready Force 1 to restore order against thousands of Cuban refugees who had attacked and injured a number of Air Force personnel while protesting their detainment at Empire Range along the Panama Canal. The battalion participated in the safeguarding of the Cuban refugees and the active patrolling in and around the refugee camps near the Panamanian Jungle for two months, enjoying a 92-degree Christmas Day and returning to Fort Bragg in February 1995. =Operation Joint Guardian= In April 1999, TF 2-505 (with B/3-505) deployed to Albania for Operation \\"NOBLE ANVIL\\", positioned at Tirana airport. When NATO forces moved into Kosovo in June, 2-505 was in the lead, performing an air assault movement to establish Camp Bondsteel, before returning to the States in September. =Operation Helping Hand= In September, 2005, the 505th PIR deployed a brigade size element, minus the rear detachment, to New Orleans, Louisiana. Soldiers either flew or convoyed, for three days, to the city to assist in rescue and recovery operations of \\"displaced Americans\\", as well as restoring order to the city in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Upon arrival, paratroopers of the 505th PIR established a command and control environment for the senior leaders of the unit to work effectively in, making decisions that were vital to the restoration of law and order as well as being able to efficiently provide needed medical attention to the citizens of New Orleans. It was at this time that the unit was also reunited with Archbishop Philip Hannan who had served in the 505th PIR as a chaplain in World War II. Archbishop Hannan was sometimes referred to as the \\"Jumping Padre\\" and was involved in the liberation of several German concentration camps. Archbishop Hannan remained in the city during Katrina and was instrumental in recovery work immediately after the storm. Subordinate units were directed to maintain different portions of the city; these units were tasked with guarding key infrastructure, stopping the looting and providing aid to the civilian population. One of the key buildings being guarded was the badly damaged Louisiana Superdome, guarded by the 3rd battalion of the 505th PIR; later redesignated the 5th Squadron 73rd Cavalry Regiment and 1st Squadron 73rd Cavalry Regiment respectively. Emergency responders, police and other assets were given to COL Owens to manage and direct as necessary. COL Owens and his staff directed paratroopers and civilians to recover the remains of the dead, provide water rescues, provide vehicle detoxification sites and patrol the street for security purposes and, secure major civil and municipalities buildings. Army engineers were also sent to begin the cleanup of the area. During the operation Hurricane Rita was heading through the same region that Katrina had just battered. COL Owens ordered that all paratroopers were to remain indoors during the storm, except for key personnel who needed to be outside. Engineers and commanders waited nervously, sending and receiving reports on whether the already badly damaged levies would hold. When the storm had ended, the levies had held. The operation lasted for approximately thirty days, then the paratroopers of the 505th returned to Fort Bragg, North Carolina. The paratroopers of the 505th PIR were awarded the Humanitarian Service Medal for service in Operation Hurricane Katrina. =Global War on Terrorism= From July 2002 to January 2003 the 505th PIR deployed to Afghanistan for Operation Enduring Freedom. Based in south eastern Afghanistan, the 505th helped curb the flow of Taliban fighters as they crossed over from Pakistan. 505th Infantry soldiers take up defensive positions during Operation Enduring Freedom. From August 2003 to April 2004, the 505th PIR deployed as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The unit was sent to areas with heavy insurgent presence. On 4 September 2003 the 1-505th was stationed at Forward Operating Base Volturno on the outskirts of Fallujah and tasked with maintaining control of the area containing this important city. The 3-505th was stationed at FOB St. Michael, near Al Mahmoudiyah, known as \\"The Gateway to Baghdad\\". The 505th tried to operate a base inside the city of Fallujah on April 23, 2003, but there were violent protests. Two days later, on April 30, the 82d Airborne was replaced by 2nd Troop (Fox) / U.S. 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment. In early September 2004, the 1-505th was deployed to Eastern Afghanistan to provide security and support for Afghanistan's first free elections. Elements of the 2-505th PIR deployed in April 2006 for a 15-month tour with other elements of the reorganized 3-505th task force in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. From August 2006 to November 2007, the 1-505th again deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The brigade combat team deployed again in November 2008 for a one-year tour. The 505th PIR took over the responsibilities of the Global Response Force mission on 1 October 2010. 1-505th deployed in May 2011 to Feb 2012 is support of the Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force - Afghanistan, two of its paratroopers were killed. The 2-505th PIR deployed once again in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in June 2012. The battalion returned in late September 2012 and successfully finished its mission without loss of life. The BCT (-) once again answered the call and deployed on short notice in support of Operation Inherent Resolve and is currently serving in Iraq. Distinctive unit insignia The distinctive unit insignia was originally approved for the 505th Airborne Infantry Regiment on 24 January 1952. It was redesignated for the 505th Infantry on 20 May 1958. The 505th PIR distinctive unit insignia is, according to the U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry > \\"A Silver color metal and enamel device 1 5/16 inches (3.33 cm) in height > overall, consisting of a shield blazoned: Argent, four bendlets Azure > surmounted by a winged Black panther salient inverted Proper, that part on > the bendlets fimbriated of the first. On a wreath Argent and Azure, a winged > arrowhead point down Gules, in front of a cloud Proper. Attached below the > shield a Blue scroll turned Silver and inscribed \\"H-MINUS\\" in Silver.\\" The colors blue and white are used to symbolize Infantry. The black panther symbolizes stealth, speed and courage, all characteristics of a good Paratrooper. The wings are added to represent entry into combat via air, and the bendlets symbolize the unit's parachute drops into combat. The winged red arrowhead is used to represent the regiment's first combat attack in Sicily during World War II. The phrase \\"H-Minus\\" signifies the Regiment's readiness prior to the start of the operation, or \\"H-Hour\\". The official insignia is in fact not the insignia first designed by the men of the unit, which was simply a black panther on a shield, with the original motto, \\"Ready\\" inscribed below it. However, the Institute of Heraldry refused to approve the crest known by the men of the World War II 505th and replaced it with the above-referenced insignia.

Today eleven of these elephants are still alive and only five have royal titles. A white elephant in Thailand is not necessarily albino, although it must have pale skin. After being discovered, the elephants are assigned to one of four graded categories before being offered to the king, although the lower grades are sometimes refused. In the past, lower grade white elephants were given as gifts to the king's friends and allies. The animals needed a lot of care and, being sacred, could not be put to work, so were a great financial burden on the recipient - only the monarch and the very rich could afford them. According to one story, white elephants were sometimes given as a present to some enemy (often a lesser noble with whom the king was displeased). The unfortunate recipient, unable to make any profit from it, and obliged to take care of it, would suffer bankruptcy and ruin.

It is located on the Barry Branch 6¬Ω miles (10 km) south of Cardiff Central. The line continues to the terminus of the Barry Branch at Barry Island but from Barry Junction the line also continues as the Vale of Glamorgan branch to Bridgend via Rhoose for Cardiff International Airport bus link and then Llantwit Major. As of October 2018, passenger services are operated by Transport for Wales as part of the Valley Lines network. History The station here was built and opened by the Barry Railway in December 1888 and just east of the station, the Barry Railway Company's main line from Cadoxton South Junction via to Junction in the Rhondda Valley ran and was opened in 1889. It was very busy from the outset and later with Biglis Junction a short distance to the north-east, the former Taff Vale Railway's coastal Penarth branch from Cogan Junction joined the Barry Company's Cadoxton-Cogan Junction extension towards what was up to 1964, subsequently changed to Cardiff Central. This network thus served the then newly commissioned, rail-served Barry Docks complex.\\"The Barry Railway\\" www.trackbed.com; Retrieved 2013-09-13 A major yard at Cadoxton North (with 39 sidings) north of Cadoxton South Junction was built in the early 1890s to handle the large numbers of coal trains brought down to the docks for coal export and the community of Cadoxton soon grew substantially to house the railway workers employed there, which in turn led to increasing levels of passenger traffic using the station. The arrival of the Taff Vale Railway's coastal route from via Lavernock in 1890, the completion of the branch to in 1896 and the opening of the Vale of Glamorgan Line two years after that, added even greater volumes of both passengers (mainly day-trippers but often holidaymakers to the resort at Barry Island) and goods passing through - by 1910 the docks had surpassed neighbouring Cardiff's as the busiest in South Wales for coal exports and subsequently became the biggest coal export dock (in terms of volume) in the world by 1913. The majority of passenger services ran to/from Cardiff (either via the coast and Penarth or directly via ) but the line via the Wenvoe Tunnel was used by trains to and from via Pontypridd Graig from 1896 onwards and the VoG line had a passenger service to/from Bridgend from its opening in 1898 until closure in 1964. Service frequencies were kept relatively low on the Wenvoe line however in order to accommodate the high volumes of freight, with six trains per day each way the standard frequency (except on summer Saturdays) for many years. Traffic levels declined significantly after World War II, with road competition leading to a significant drop in usage on all of the routes serving the station, especially in the summer months. This led to British Railways closing many of the routes to passengers in the 1960s - the Pontypridd line was the first to go in September 1962, whilst the Vale of Glamorgan (June 1964) and Penarth (May 1968) lines both fell victim to the Beeching Axe, leaving only the Cardiff to Barry Island line still open. Of the three that lost their passenger trains, (Cadoxton-Pontypridd, Barry-Bridgend and Penarth-Cadoxton), only the Cardiff- Barry Island and Cardiff-Bridgend via Llantwit Major (reopened in June 2005)) services remain, with many through trains from Valley termini, such as Aberdare, Treherbert, Merthyr and Rhymney. Cadoxton-Pontypridd (via Treforest Junction) and Penarth-Cadoxton were closed completely and the tracks lifted by 1970. The yard also suffered a similar fate, with the sidings dismantled after the abandonment of the Wenvoe 'main line' in March 1963RCTS Mystery Photos - Cadoxton Junction RCTS website; Retrieved 2013-09-13 and the site subsequently redeveloped for housing. The decline in routes serving the station has had a consequent effect on the layout here, with only two of the four original platforms now in use. Some freight traffic bound for the remaining rail- connected parts of the docks still passes through (such as containers & scrap steel) along with that heading further west (e.g. automotive parts for the Ford factory at Bridgend and bulk coal bound for Aberthaw Power Station), but many of the flows that once ran to the docks have now ceased (such as the ICI chemical tank trains from Burn Naze and Baglan Bay which ended in the late 1990s). By October 2019, it was apparent that coal deliveries to Aberthaw \\"B\\" power station had ceased and it had been announced that the Power station was to close in the spring of 2020. The Ford factory at Bridgend was also to close in 2020 but on a better note, there had been some considerable flow of cement delivery by rail from Tarmac's Aberthaw cement works during 2018 and 2019.

Technique  Half knots are tied alternately behind and in front of the rope until the width of the band of twine approaches the diameter of the rope. A reef (square) knot, or better a series of reef (square) knots, completes the whipping. If a needle is available this string of reef (square) knots can be pulled through the rope to bury the ends. Alternatively, a short bight of another rope can be laid first and used to pull the rope ends through. If the rope is a stranded rope, the ends can usually be pulled through without a needle.

The document challenged the churches' response to what the authors saw as the vicious policies of the apartheid regime under the state of emergency declared on 21 July 1985. The KD evoked strong reactions and furious debates not only in South Africa, but world-wide. The KD is a prime example of contextual theology and liberation theology - or \\"theology from below\\" - in South Africa, and has served as an example for attempted, similarly critical writing at decisive moments in several other countries and contexts (Latin America, Europe, Zimbabwe, India, Palestine, etc.).  Context  The KD was predominantly written by an ecumenical group of pastors in Soweto, whose names have never (officially) been released to the public. Many believe it was a conscious decision to make the document anonymous, perhaps for security reasons since the Apartheid regime frequently harassed, detained, or tortured clergy who opposed the government. It is widely thought though that Frank Chikane, a black Pentecostal pastor and theologian, and Albert Nolan, a white Roman Catholic priest and member of the Dominican Order, belonged to this group. John W. de Gruchy writes decidedly that Frank Chikane, then General Secretary of the Institute for Contextual Theology (ICT) in Braamfontein, Johannesburg, initiated the process. When this fairly short, 11,000-word document was first published in September 1985, it included over 150 signatures; it was subsequently signed by many more church leaders and theologians in South Africa, though the amended list was never published. A substantially revised, second edition appeared in 1986.  Summary  The document is structured in five short chapters (the second edition comes to less than 40 pages): (1) The Moment of Truth; (2) Critique of 'State Theology'; (3) Critique of 'Church Theology'; (4) Towards a Prophetic Theology; (5) Challenge to Action; and a short conclusion. The following summary is based on the revised edition, and is designed to focus on the most important aspects of the KD, without comment. = Chapter One: The Moment of Truth = This chapter sets the context in which the KD is written. The time has come (September 1985) to act on the situation. The Greek term kairos / Œ∫Œ±ŒπœÅŒøœÇ (meaning 'special moment' in this context) was chosen as a key term to describe the highly situational nature of this document. It was addressed to the churches in the context of South Africa at that very moment, and was meant to be understood as a process rather than a definitive statement, \\"... this was an open-ended document which will never be said to be final\\" (KD, Preface). The document is primarily addressed to the divided churches; divided, that is, due to the roles that Christians within the churches play in the conflict between the racist minority government and the black majority population. \\"Both oppressor and oppressed claim loyalty to the same church\\". The KD theologians see three broad theological positions within the church, which are discussed in turn in the next three chapters. = Chapter Two: Critique of State Theology = 'State theology' is defined as, \\"the theological justification of the status quo with its racism, capitalism and totalitarianism... It does [this] by misusing theological concepts and biblical texts for its own political purposes\\". The government, as well as parts of the church, are accused of using state theology. Four examples are discussed.  Romans 13:1-7  \\"'State Theology' assumes that in this text Paul is presenting us with the absolute and definitive Christian doctrine about the State ... and absolute and universal principle ... The falseness of this assumption has been pointed out by many biblical scholars\\". Reference is made to K√§semann's Commentary on Romans, as well as Cullmann's The State in the New Testament. The KD authors insist that texts must be understood in their context: within a particular writing (here: Romans); within the Bible as a whole; and within the particular historical context (here: Paul and the community in Rome). Note that, \\"In the rest of the Bible, God does not demand obedience to oppressive rulers ... cannot contradict all of this\\". The letter known as the Biblical book Romans was sent to an early Christian community in Rome that could be characterized as 'antinomian' or 'enthusiast.' Roman Christians thought that \\"because Jesus ... was their Lord and King,\\" every authority should be obeyed. Paul was arguing against such an understanding; that is, he is \\"not addressing the issue of a just or unjust State.\\" Attention is drawn to (\\"the State is there for your benefit\\"): \\"That is the kind of State that must be obeyed.\\" The question of an unjust government is not addressed in but, for example, in .  Law and Order  State theology implies that law and order must be upheld, but in the Apartheid State, the KD authors contend, this is an unjust law and order. \\"Anyone who wishes to change this law ... is made ... to feel guilty of sin\\". The KD theologians argue that the State has no divine authority to maintain any sort of law and order. The appeal to law and order is misplaced. Ultimately, it is God who must be obeyed (). State theology further justifies the State's use of violence to maintain the status quo. Thus \\"state security becomes a more important concern than justice ... The State often admonishes church leaders ... not to 'meddle in politics' while at the same time it indulges in its own political theology which claims God's approval for its use of violence in maintaining an unjust system of 'law and order'\\".  The Threat of Communism  \\"Anything that threatens the status quo is labeled 'communist'... No account is taken of what communism really means ... Even people who have not rejected capitalism are called 'communists' when they reject 'State Theology.' The State uses the label ... as its symbol of evil\\". The State uses \\"threats and warnings about the horrors of a tyrannical, totalitarian, atheistic and terrorist communist regime\\" simply to scare people.  The God of the State  The Apartheid State often makes explicit use of the name of God to justify its own existence, most explicitly in the preamble to the (1983) Constitution of South Africa: \\"In humble submission to almighty God ... who gathered our forebears together from many lands and gave them this their own; who has guided them from generation to generation ...\\" The KD theologians reject this categorically: \\"This god [of the State] is an idol ... [it is] the god of teargas, rubber bullets, sjamboks, prison cells and death sentences.\\" In other words, \\"the very opposite of the God of the Bible\\", which is, theologically speaking \\"the devil disguised as Almighty God.\\" Therefore, \\"State Theology is not only heretical, it is blasphemous ... What is particularly tragic for a Christian is to see the number of people who are fooled and confused by these false prophets and their heretical theology.\\" = Chapter Three: Critique of 'Church Theology' = 'Church Theology' is defined as the kind of theology shown by public pronouncements of many church leaders in the so-called English speaking churches of South Africa, such as Anglicans, Methodists, and Lutherans. While such a theology tends to reject apartheid in principle, the KD theologians regard it as counter-productive and superficial as they do not analyze \\"the signs of our times [but rather rely] upon a few stock ideas derived from Christian tradition,\\" which is uncritically 'applied' to the then South African context.  Reconciliation  While true reconciliation and peace are the core of the Christian tradition, true reconciliation, the KD authors argue, is not possible without justice. Calls for reconciliation without justice are calls for \\"counterfeit reconciliation\\". Such false reconciliation relies on the notion that the church must stand between 'both sides' and 'get them to reconcile,' as if all conflicts were the same: some struggles are about justice and injustice, where blindly calling for reconciliation is \\"unChristian.\\" Therefore, \\"no reconciliation, no forgiveness and no negotiations are possible without repentance\\". Yet, the imposition of the brutal State of Emergency in July 1985 shows that there is no repentance.  Justice  The KD theologians acknowledge that the concept of justice is not absent from much Church Theology. Yet the KD accuses Church Theology of advocating a \\"justice of reforms,\\" a justice of concessions that is determined by the oppressor. Hence \\"almost all Church statements are made to the State or to the white community\\". At the heart of this approach, the KD sees the reliance on individual conversion as a moralizing approach directed at the individual Christian. Yet \\"the problem ... in South Africa is not merely a problem of personal guilt, it is a problem of structural injustice.\\" The question one has to ask is: \\"Why does this [Church] theology not demand that the oppressed stand up for their rights and wage a struggle against their oppressors? Why does it not tell them that it is 'their' duty to work for justice and to change the unjust structures\\"?  Non-Violence  The KD questions the blanket condemnation of all \\"that is called violence,\\" which \\"has been made into an absolute principle.\\" This aspect of Church Theology tends to exclude state-organized, \\"structural, institutional and unrepentant violence of the State.\\" Indeed, \\"is it legitimate ... to use the same word violence in a blanket condemnation to cover\\" the violence of the state and the \\"desperate attempts of the people to defend themselves\\"? The KD observes that the term violence is used in the Bible to denote the violence of the oppressor (e.g. , etc.). \\"When Jesus says that we should turn the other cheek he is telling us that we must not take revenge; he is not saying that we should never defend ourselves or others\\". \\"This is not to say that any use of force at any time by people who are oppressed is permissible...\\"; the problem with such acts of \\"killing and maiming\\" is, however, \\"based upon a concern for genuine liberation\\". While Church Theology tends to decry violent resistance, it tends to accept the militarization of the Apartheid State, which implies a tacit acceptance of the racist regime as legitimate authority. Neutrality, in this context, is not possible: \\"Neutrality enables the status quo of oppression (and therefore violence) to continue\\".  The fundamental problem  According to the KD, Church Theology lacks appropriate social analysis: \\"It is not possible to make valid moral judgments about a society without first understanding that society\\". Secondly, it lacks \\"an adequate understanding of politics and political strategy,\\" not because there is a \\"specifically Christian solution\\" as such, but because Christians need to make use of politics. The reasons for this are seen in the \\"type of faith and spirituality that has dominated Church life for centuries,\\" namely an approach that has regarded spirituality as an \\"other-worldly affair,\\" wherein God was relied upon to intervene \\"in God's own good time.\\" Yet such a faith has \\"no foundation\\" in the Bible, which shows how God redeems all of creation (Romans 8:18-24): \\"Biblical faith is prophetically relevant to everything that happens in the world\\". = Chapter Four: Towards a Prophetic Theology = What would the alternative to State and Church Theology be? \\"What would be the characteristics of a prophetic theology\\"?  Prophetic Theology  In the first place, prophetic theology will have to be biblical: \\"Our KAIROS impels us to return to the Bible, and to search the Word of God for a message that is relevant to what we are experiencing in South Africa today\\". It does not \\"pretend to be comprehensive and complete;\\" it is consciously devised for this situation, and therefore needs to take seriously the need to read the \\"signs of the times\\" (). It is always a call to action, a call for \\"repentance, conversion and change\\". This will involve confrontation, taking a stand, and persecution. It is, nevertheless, fundamentally a \\"message of hope.\\" It is spiritual: \\"Infused with a spirit of fearless[ness] ... courage ... love ... understanding ... joy and hope\\".  Suffering and Oppression in the Bible  Reading the bible in this context \\"what stands out for us is (sic) the many, many vivid and concrete descriptions of suffering and oppression\\" from Exodus to Revelation. Israel was often oppressed by both external and internal forces. \\"Their oppressors were their enemies. The people of Israel were in no doubt about that\\". Indeed, \\"people of the townships can identify fully with these descriptions of suffering\\". Nor is the concern about oppression only found in the Old Testament, even though the New Testament tends to focus on internal repression rather than the Roman occupying forces. \\"Throughout his life Jesus associated himself with the poor and the oppressed and as the suffering (or oppressed) servant of Yahweh he suffered and died for us. 'Ours were the sufferings he bore, ours the sorrows he carried.' () He continues to do so, even today\\".  Social Analysis  The KD offers \\"the broad outlines of an analysis of the conflict in which we find ourselves\\". This conflict is seen not so much as a 'racial war' but rather a situation \\"of tyranny and oppression\\". This is expressed in social structures which \\"will sooner or later bring the people involved into conflict.\\" Those who benefit from this system will only make reform possible in order to maintain the essential status quo. On the other hand, those who do not benefit from the system have no say in it. The situation now is one where the oppressed are no longer prepared to accept this. \\"What they want is justice for all...\\". Of course this social structure is more complex, but the KD authors come to this distinction: \\"Either we have full and equal justice for all or we don't\\". Prophetic theology, like Jesus', addresses this situation (e.g. ). \\"It is therefore not primarily a matter of trying to reconcile individual people but a matter of trying to change unjust structures so that people will not be pitted against one another as oppressor and oppressed\\".  Tyranny  In terms of the Christian tradition, the KD maintain, a tyrannical government has no moral right to govern, \\"and the people acquire the right to resist\\". The South African Apartheid government is tyrannical because it consistently demonstrates its hostility to the common good as a matter of principle. As a tyrannical regime, it uses terror to maintain power. As a result, the oppressed refer to it as 'the enemy'. The Apartheid State is not capable of true reform; any reforms will have to be facile only since they are designed to ensure the survival of the white minority government. \\"A regime that has made itself the enemy of the people has thereby also made itself the enemy of God,\\" even though at the level of the individual, people in government are not aware of this. This is, however, \\"no excuse for hatred. As Christians we are called upon to love our enemies\\" (Mt 5:44). However, \\"the most loving thing we can do for both the oppressed and for our enemies who are oppressors is to eliminate the oppression, remove the tyrants from power, and establish a just government for the common good for all the people\\".  Liberation and hope in the Bible  The Bible is commonly understood as a message of hope in the face of oppression; Yahweh will liberate the people (e.g. , , ). \\"Throughout the Bible, God appears as the liberator ... God is not neutral. He does not attempt to reconcile Moses and Pharaoh ...\\". Neither is Jesus \\"unconcerned about the rich ... These he calls to repentance ... We believe that God is at work in our world turning hopeless and evil situations to good so that God's Kingdom may come and God's Will may be done on earth as it is in heaven\\".  A message of hope  \\"The people need to hear it said again and again that God is with them and that 'the hope of the poor is never brought to nothing'\\" (). Also, while the oppressors must be called to repentance, \\"they must also be given something to hope for. At present they have false hopes ... Can the Christian message of hope not help them in this matter\\"? = Chapter Five: Challenge to Action =  God sides with the oppressed  The Church's call to action must consider that the struggle against Apartheid is generally waged by the poor and oppressed, who are part of the church already. Church unity is a matter of joining in the struggle. \\"For those Christians who find themselves on the side of the oppressor or sitting on the fence, [the way forward is] to cross over to the other side to be united in faith and action\\". Liberation, however should be noted that it does not come on a silver platter.  Participation in the struggle  \\"Criticism [of the way the struggle is being waged] will sometimes be necessary but encouragement and support will be (sic) also be necessary. In other words, ... move beyond a mere 'ambulance ministry' to a ministry of involvement and participation\\".  Transforming church action  The traditional life, ritual, and actions of the church must be re-envisaged in the light of the kairos. \\"The repentance we preach must be named. It is repentance for our share of the guilt for the suffering and oppression in our country\\".  Special campaigns  Special church action and campaigns must be in \\"consultation, co-ordination and co-operation\\" with the people's political organization, rather than a 'new, third force' that duplicates what already exists.  Civil disobedience  \\"In the first place, the Church cannot collaborate with tyranny... Secondly, the Church should not only pray for a change of government, it should also mobilize its members in every parish to begin to think and work and plan for a change of government in South Africa\\". At times, the KD contends, this will mean getting involved in civil disobedience.  Moral guidance  People look to the church for moral guidance, and this position of influence must be taken seriously. \\"There must be no misunderstanding about the moral duty of all who are oppressed to resist oppression and to struggle for liberation and justice. The Church will also find that at times it does need to curb excesses and to appeal to the consciences of those who act thoughtlessly and wildly\\". = Conclusion = \\"As we said in the beginning, there is nothing final about this document nor even about this second edition. Our hope is that it will continue to stimulate discussion, debate, reflection and prayer, but, above all, that it will lead to action ... We pray that God will help all of us to translate the challenge of our times into action.\\"  Reactions  Although the Apartheid State was not directly addressed in the KD, the government reacted strongly against it. A government spokesperson rejected it in a speech in Parliament, denouncing it as a call for violence, and calling for its prohibition ('banning') by the government. An Inkatha political magazine, the Clarion Call, similarly attacked it as a theological document that supported the 'violence of the ANC' (African National Congress). However, to the surprise of many observers at the time, the KD was never banned by the Apartheid government. Within the churches in South Africa, and indeed worldwide, the KD led to intense and often heated debates. The unpolished nature of this radical document allowed many critics to disengage from real debate. For example, Markus Barth and Helmut Blanke make a rather brief, disparaging remark, which seems to be based on a reading of the KD that is significantly at variance with its substance. In the KD, Barth and Blanke claim, \\"it is the starved, exploited, oppressed people whose cause, as it were, by definition is righteous, while all political, economical, and ecclesiastical wielders of institutionalized power are depicted as instruments of the devil.\\" A crucial part of the debate was the distinction made between state, church, and prophetic theology. The distinction between 'church' and 'prophetic' theology, where the former was explicitly rejected by the KD, caused furious debates. Many argued the KD's qualified criticism of central theological concepts like reconciliation. Another aspect of this debate, especially in South Africa, was the question of violence: not the violence of the state, but the supposed use of violence to resist and indeed overthrow the state. As the summary above shows, this was not a central part of the KD, but it nevertheless became a focus for the debate. This focus on violence soon came to eclipse much of the rest of the KD. The publication of the book Theology & Violenceis testimony to that debate; it attempted both to ground it in biblical, historical, ethical and theological reflections, and to 'move on', as Frank Chikane in his contribution to that book called it. The influence and effect of the KD was such that attempts were made in a number of contexts to create similarly 'revolutionary' documents to challenge the churches' attitude to particular issues. None of these were remotely as successful as the KD. For example, in South Africa again, a group in the ICT attempted to address the sharply rising and complex violence in 1990 with a 'new Kairos document'. Several years later, some theologians in Europe tried to address global economics as 'the new Kairos'. Perhaps the most successful attempt to follow in the footsteps of the KD was the 'Latin American KD', called The Road to Damascus, written by Central American theologians and published in April 1988. However, the KD was successful in influencing black evangelicals and Pentecostals to come up with their own declarations in the context of Apartheid.

Philippe Antoine d'Ornano, 1st Comte d'Ornano (January 17, 1784 ‚Äì October 13, 1863) was a French soldier and political figure who rose to the rank of Marshal of France. He was made Count d'Ornano of the French Empire in 1808. He was born a son of Lodovico Antonio Ornano and Isabella Maria Buonaparte, making him a second cousin of Napoleon Bonaparte. Life =Revolution and First Empire= Born in Ajaccio, Corsica, he served in Italy during the French Revolutionary Wars (in 1798 and 1799), and later took part in the expedition to Saint-Domingue. D'Ornano served in the campaigns of the Napoleonic Wars from 1805 on. He commanded the 5th Dragoon regiment during the battle of Fuentes de O√±oro, after a brave attack of cavalry, he was promoted to brigadier general. He returned to France and took part in the Russian campaign of 1812. At the Battle of Borodino, d'Ornano was promoted to g√©n√©ral de division. D'Ornano was wounded at the Battle of Krasnoi. In 1813, after the death of Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bessi√®res, he commanded the cavalry of the Imperial Guard. He accompanied Napoleon to the south of France until the emperor embarked for Elba, and was exiled from France by the Bourbon Restoration. In 1816, d'Ornano married Napol√©on's former mistress Marie Walewska - she died in childbirth in 1817. Her heart was placed in the crypt of the d'Ornano family at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris and her body was brought back to Poland for burial. (In 1869, however, her coffin was found to be empty. It was speculated that some unknown necrophile had removed her remains.) The line of Counts d'Ornano was continued by his only son Rodolphe- Auguste d'Ornano, and exists until the present day. =Restoration, July Monarchy, and Second Empire= Coat of arms He returned to France and resumed active service in 1829 when he was given a position at the Military Academy of Saint-Cyr. In 1830, after the July Revolution, he was given command of the 4th military division at Tours. Two years later, he suppressed revolts in the Vend√©e after which he was made a Peer of France. In 1848 he served as head of the 14th military division until he resigned for reasons of health. In 1849, d'Ornano was elected to the National Assembly as a member for the d√©partement of Indre-et-Loire. During the Second Empire, he was made a Senator and a Grand Cross in the L√©gion d'honneur. After the death of R√©mi Joseph Isidore Exelmans, he was appointed Chancellor of the order. In 1853 he was made Governor of Les Invalides. At the age of seventy seven, he was promoted to Marshal of France by Napol√©on III. He died in Vincennes, a suburb of Paris, in 1863.

Early life Parr was born in Lichfield Grove, Finchley, now in the London Borough of Barnet but still in the historic County of Middlesex. His father was a milkman. He lived most of his life at 52 Lodge Lane, North Finchley, the youngest of eleven children of Edward and Alice Parr.WWI Centenary: First casualty Private John Parr shrouded in mystery, Barnet & Whetstone Press, 4 August 2014 Many of his siblings died before their fourth birthday.A mother‚Äôs anguish over the first man to fall, Daily Telegraph, 3 August 2014 Upon leaving school he took a job working as a butcher's boy, and then as a caddie at North Middlesex Golf Club.

He was nicknamed \\"Ole Parr\\", possibly after Old Tom Parr. Military service Parr became an infantry scout with the 4th Middlesex, whose role was to ride ahead of the battalion on the march with a detachment mounted upon bicycles to detect the enemy, or points of military note, and then return with all possible speed to notify the Battalion's Commanding Officer as to what lay ahead. On the outbreak of the First World War in early August 1914 the 4th Middlesex was mobilized, and was among the first British Army units of the British Expeditionary Force to cross the English Channel to France. With the Imperial German Army invading Belgium and France at that moment, Parr's unit took up positions near the village of Bettignies, beside the canal running through the town of Mons approximately away. On 21 August 1914, Parr and another cyclist were sent to the village of Obourg, just northeast of Mons, and slightly over the border in Belgium, with orders to locate where the Germans were. It is believed that whilst doing this they encountered an Uhlan patrol from the German First Army engaged in the same work, and that Parr remained to hold off the enemy whilst his companion returned to report. He was killed in an exchange of rifle fire. The exact circumstances of his death remain unclear, and historical research in 2014 has posited the theory that he may have been killed by friendly fire rather than that from a German patrol as previously thought, or during the Battle of Mons on 23 August 1914.WW1 mystery: Who killed Private John Parr?, BBC News, 4 August 2014 As the British Army retreated from the area shortly afterwards, Parr's body was left behind, and with the absence of confirmation of his fate Parr's death was not officially recognised until much later in the conflict.

Grave Parr's body was later found to have been buried, probably by the Germans, in a battlefield grave, which was subsequently located by the Imperial War Graves Commission. Today his grave lies in St Symphorien Military Cemetery, just southeast of Mons.

It is an executive agency of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. The Agency values properties for the purpose of Council Tax and for non-domestic rates in England and Wales (in Scotland this function is performed by the Scottish Assessors). This work is undertaken on behalf of the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government in England, and the Welsh Government in Wales. The Agency also provides additional valuation services to HM Revenue and Customs through its District Valuer Services business stream. This includes property valuations for the purpose of assessing taxes, such as capital gains and inheritance tax. District Valuer Services also provide a wide range of valuation services to the public sector, such as asset valuations for resource accounting and compulsory purchase advice on the purchase and sale of property, specialist building surveying advice, and valuation of mineral bearing property, landfill sites and plant and machinery. Since April 2008 following a restructure, District Valuer Services has been divided into National and Central Services, who look after the Agency's statutory services to HMRC, and Commercial Services who provide commercial property valuation services to the public sector. The predecessors of the Valuation Office Agency were the separate Valuation Office organisations in England and Wales (established in 1910) and in Scotland (established in 1911). The Valuation Office Agency was created as a merger of these two and became a Next Steps Agency of the Inland Revenue on 30 September 1991. The VOA employs 3,990 people (full-time equivalent) in 86 offices. It is the largest single employer of Chartered Surveyors in the UK. The current Chief Executive is Melissa Tatton, appointed in September 2017. The equivalent body to the VOA for Northern Ireland is the Valuation and Lands Agency. In Scotland it is the Scottish Assessors.  History  The Finance Act 1910 introduced a new land value tax on that part of the capital appreciation of a property which followed from the expenditure of public money on communal development such as roads or other public services. In order to apply this tax it was necessary to value all property in the UK and the Inland Revenue set up the Valuation Office to carry out this task. This led to the Valuation Office Survey (1910-1915). The VO soon began to receive requests from other government departments for valuation assistance a task which it continues to undertake today. It was this other government work that lead to the VO's retention after the 1910 land value tax was abolished in the 1920s. During the following years the VO took on some major tasks such in 1931 which saw a further proposed tax on land values and from 1939 to 1945 when it valued property destroyed by enemy action in the UK during the Second World War. In 1950 the role of the VO was expanded when it took over responsibility for the valuation of property in England and Wales for rating purposes. Prior to this year it had been the task of each local authority to compile and maintain its own rating list but this had led to inconsistencies in valuations. When in 1948 a new system of government equalisation grants to local authorities was introduced uniformity in rating valuation was essential and this could only be provided by a central organisation such as the VO. It was not feasible to absorb the extra rating staff and work into the hundred existing VO offices so a separate network of 268 new offices were opened with the majority of their staff being transferred from local authorities. Each local office was headed by a district valuer responsible for all of the rating and revenue work within the geographical responsibility of his office. There were regional offices each headed by a superintending valuer who was responsible for the general management of the district valuers within his region and liaison between the local offices and the Chief Valuer's Office in London. Over the years the number of offices has reduced as the rating and other functions of the VO were combined into so- called \\"integrated\\" offices and the network was slimmed down as the number of local offices were closed and by 1996 there were only 93. Staffing numbers have varied in accordance with the workload peaking in the years around the times of rating revaluations when it was necessary to increase staff to carry the revaluation and to settle appeals arising from it. So in 1965 there were around 7,000 compared to 2,600 prior to 1950. By 1994/5 there were 4,775 permanent staff. In 1998 the VO underwent a large scale re-organisation which saw a large reduction in the size of the regional layer of management and the closure of regional offices. The district valuer post in the local office was abolished and there was a reorganisation of the local offices into 24 Groups each headed by a Group Valuation Officer. A number of regionally-based specialist rating units were set up to take over responsibility from the local offices for the more complex or higher-value non-domestic rating assessments. As part of this re-organisation further offices were closed leaving a total of 85. As of 2017-2018 the VOA continues to undergo transformation with further office closures in England and Wales. =Revaluations= Rating system revaluations have taken place irregularly. The first was due in 1952 but was postponed until 1956 where unusually the residential rateable assessments were based on 1939 values. The next due in 1961 was postponed until 1963 due to difficulties in valuing houses and the 1973 revaluation took place five years after it was originally scheduled. The next revaluation should have been in 1982 but was again postponed until 1990. This revaluation was purely for commercial property as domestic rating had been abolished. Since then there has been a five yearly cycle of commercial revaluations, however, on 18 October 2012 the government introduced a new Growth and Structure Bill into the House of Commons which included measures to postpone the next business rates revaluation in England from 2015 to 2017. In the Spring Statement 2018 the Chancellor Philip Hammond announced a move to more frequent revaluations, which would now be held every three years, starting from the next revaluation in 2021. In 1993 domestic rating returned in the form of the Council Tax where a residential property's sale price, rather than it letting value, is the basis for assessment. It was intended to have a domestic revaluation in England in 2007 but following the domestic revaluation in Wales, where over a third of households saw a banding increase, it was decided to postpone the revaluation of England. The current government announced on the 24 September 2010 there will be no revaluation of council tax bands in England during this parliament. In another announcement on 4 December 2010 the Department for Communities and Local Government said the revaluation of the Welsh Council Tax bands, pencilled in for 2015, would not now go ahead, and decisions over any future re-valuations should be taken in Cardiff Bay. = The Rent Service = The Rent Service (TRS) was a government agency providing a rental valuation service to local authorities in England supplying them with a range of valuations to assist them in settling claims for housing benefit from claimants living in privately rented housing. Valuations were provided for landlords and tenants for fair rent registrations made under Section 70 of the Rent Act 1977 (amended by the Housing Act 1988) and assisting local authorities with housing renovation grant applications. The introduction of the new Local Housing Allowance for new claimants in April 2008 had a significant impact on the Rent Service. It was expected that by 2011 its workload would be approximately 75% lower than the level in 2007‚Äì8. The residual functions of The Rent Service were transferred from the Department for Work and Pensions to the Valuation Office Agency on 1 April 2009. =Working more efficiently= In November 2007, chief executive Andrew Hudson announced to staff a series of measures to improve its service to customers and take account of a reduction in government funding. The plans included more centralisation of routine processing functions; better management of data; a reduction in the space the Agency occupies through digitisation of records; and the introduction of more flexible ways of working, supported by enhanced technology. =VOA 2015= In February 2009 Andrew Hudson was named as the next managing director of the public services and growth directorate in HM Treasury. His replacement at the VOA was Penny Ciniewicz, who had joined the Civil Service in 1997 and since then has worked in the Department of Trade and Industry and the Cabinet Office. Prior to joining the VOA, she was Director, Knowledge, Analysis and Intelligence in HMRC. Ciniewicz brought across a number of staff from HMRC to assist her with her plan known as VOA 2015. VOA 2015 was a continuation of the search for cost savings by staff reductions (staff numbers reduced by 300 in the year 2009-10), the introduction of new technology, and office closures. The plan took into account the additional 20% cost cuts required by the government. As part of VOA 2015 the CEO abolished the 'group' structure and its associated group valuation officer position, organising staff by function into business streams rather than by location. = Check Challenge Appeal = In April 2017 launched a new online service, Check Challenge Appeal (CCA). The Valuation Office Agency (VOA) deals with checks and challenges and the independent Valuation Tribunal for England handles any appeals. The online service allows users to \\"claim\\" a property and to check the information the VOA hold, this record can then be amended or challenged and if not resolved then they can move to appeal. The CCA service was heavily criticised by service users, the Treasury Select Committee undertook an inquiry. The Committee heard evidence from a large number of businesses and trade organisations. Their findings were that the service was broken, delays were common, there were issues with staffing in specialist roles and public confidence had been eroded. The Government promised to make changes at the VOA as part of a fundamental review in its reply in February 2020.

Puyallup is normally assigned to the Edmonds‚ÄìKingston route, although she is often reassigned to the Seattle‚ÄìBainbridge Island route whenever either of her sisters assigned to that route are out of service. Puyallup had been at the Bainbridge Route for over a year while underwent maintenance. The vessel then returned to Edmonds‚ÄìKingston where her extra capacity was missed. While Puyallup spent three weeks in dry dock in November 2003, and served the Edmonds-Kingston route. In mid-2008, Puyallup was sent out of service for repainting and to have a new security system installed. She returned to service in January 2009. In the winter of 2013 she was hauled and her hull was stripped down to steel for a thorough inspection and scheduled maintenance. She was also fitted with new five bladed propellers as an experiment to reduce vibration and increase efficiency. Incidents There have been a few incidents in which passengers aboard Puyallup have disappeared. On April 15, 2001, a man disappeared while en route from Seattle to Bainbridge Island. Authorities suspected he fell overboard when the ship turned to enter Eagle Harbor while he was sitting on a railing.

Gilbert Gauthe as a Boy Scout chaplain despite the fact that Gauthe had previously come to Frey's attention for having molested altar boys. Gauthe was stripped of his priestly duties after more allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced in 1983. Bishop Frey was criticized for his handling of Gauthe's case, and in 1985 expressed his regret, saying, \\"I ask for the prayers and understanding of all our people and of all people of good will of every faith and belief. I deeply regret and am distressed by the suffering that has taken place because of the tragic events in the diocese over the past several years.\\" In total, the diocese settled for more than $20 million in lawsuits involving Gauthe. Gauthe was later jailed for violating the Texas sex offender registration law and released in April 2010.

During the famine in Ansbach in the middle of the 18th century, Hofmann's parents had emigrated from Pretzendorf (now Himmelkron), near Bayreuth, to Bohemia, where they lived in very poor circumstances. His early training he received at home, and from his thirteenth year he studied at Prague as a \\"bachur\\" (Talmudic scholar) under Rabbi Abraham Plohn. After completing his studies he entered as teacher the house of Joel Baruch, a tobacco farmer for the Austrian government. Besides giving instruction to the children, Hofmann took charge of the books of his employer. When in 1788 Baruch moved to Vienna and opened a wholesale house there, Hofmann was appointed manager of the entire business. Having received the same year a permit from the Austrian government to do business in Vienna, he chose the name \\"Isaak L√∂w Hofmann\\". On the death of Baruch he was made a partner in, and in 1794 became sole member of the firm which bore the name \\"Hofmann und L√∂winger\\". Becoming interested in 1796 in the manufacture of silk, he was one of the first to farm the silk monopoly from the Hungarian government (1802), a privilege which his house retained for nearly half a century. At his instigation, his son Emanuel wrote a pamphlet, \\"Einleitung zur Seidenzucht\\", of which more than 16,000 copies were distributed. Hofmann was very active in business, and succeeded in making his firm one of the leading houses of Austria-Hungary. Hofmann took great interest in the Jewish community of Vienna, being president in 1806 and representative in 1812, which latter office he held until his death. In 1822 he founded the institution for the poor (\\"Armenanstalt\\"), which is still flourishing. He received many honours, and was made a member of the hereditary nobility by the Emperor of Austria in 1835. He was the great-grandfather of Hugo von Hofmannsthal.

History  = Origins = Zalambessa was a village that was fortified by Italian colonial forces. = 20th Century = The fortifications were taken over by the Ethiopian military in 1952 when Eritrea was federated with Ethiopia. The older village (Tsorona) remained under Eritrean Administration and the exact border became an issue before and during the Eritrean-Ethiopian War (1998‚Äì2000). After the war, the town was in ruins. = 21st Century = In 2000, Eritrea and Ethiopia signed the Algiers Agreement (2000) which forwarded the border dispute to a Hague boundary commission. In the Agreement both parties agreed in advance to comply with the ruling of the Border Commission. In 2002, the commission ruling, reconfirmed and made more precise in their final ruling effective November 2007, placed Tsorona inside Eritrean territory, and Zalambessa inside Ethiopian territory.

Wellington, Tasmania, 1975 Henry Barber and Lyle Closs on first free ascent of Incipience at Coles Bay, Tasmania, 1975 Henry Barber (born 1953 in Boston, Massachusetts) is an American rock climber and ice climber who rose to prominence in the 1970s. Known by the nickname \\"Hot Henry\\", Barber was an advocate of clean climbing, a prolific first ascenscionist and free soloist. He was one of the first American rock climbers to travel widely to climb in different countries. Barber was one of the first \\"professional\\" American rock climbers, supporting himself as a sales representative for outdoor equipment companies including Chouinard Equipment and Patagonia, and by giving lectures and slide shows. He was an integral member of the \\"Front Four\\" quartet of the 1970s: \\"Hot Henry\\", John Stannard, Steve Wunsch, and John Bragg. Initial climbs At age 17, Barber started climbing with the Boston chapter of the Appalachian Mountain Club. Although initially not athletically gifted, he became obsessed with the sport, and persevered, climbing as much as possible. By his own account, Henry climbed approximately 270 days in 1972, and 325 in 1973. In 1973, Henry did the second ascent of Foops, a 5.11 climbing route in the Gunks; this was five years after John Stannard had done the pioneering first ascent. In rock climbing, especially at popular crags like the Gunks, a second ascent is normally done soon after the first, usually in a matter of days or weeks. Hot Henry Barber was known for climbing in trademark white golfer's cap and white painter's pants, as well as his abrasive and arrogant demeanor. He was one of the few climbers of his era to actively seek and use media attention. His repertoire of moves, creativity, and problem-solving abilities, and his tremendous self-confidence and mental control, set him apart from his contemporaries. Henry Barber was an early advocate of clean climbing, climbing with only nuts for protection. One of Barber's specialties was doing the first free ascent of established aid climbs. Barber was a prolific soloist, specializing in on-sight solo ascents. In 1973, Barber soloed the Steck- Salath√© Route on Sentinel Rock in Yosemite National Park. The solo ascent, done on-sight in 2¬Ω hours, first brought Barber to prominence as a leading rock climber. International travel In 1976 Henry (with Steve Wunsch and Fritz Wiessner) traveled to Dresden, East Germany as the first American climbing visitors. Wiessner had learned rock climbing around Dresden early in the century. Tradition (and soft, fragile sandstone) demanded that rock climbers use no metal for protection, relying instead only on knotted nylon slings jammed into cracks to hold a leader's fall. Climbers were expected to climb barefoot, and to abstain from the use of gymnasts' chalk. Barber was impressed with the rigours and difficulty of climbing around Dresden; the Dresden climbers were impressed with Henry's ability, although they also thought him too reckless, especially in the area of free soloing. Barber was well-traveled at a time when rock climbers generally did not stray far from their home crags. His style was to show up at an area and greatly exceed local standards. In one trip he single-handedly jumped technical standards in Australia by more than a number grade. Other accomplishments include first ascent of the often-tried Butterballs in Yosemite; blazing a trail of desperate first ascents in the Gunks; and on-sight free-soloing dozens of routes on many different rock types in many different countries, up to hard 5.10, at a time when the 5.11 grade was only starting to solidify. Barber climbed at Mount Arapiles in Australia; Dresden; Great Britain; Scotland; Russia; Mexico; as well as climbing all over the United States, from the crags of New England to Yosemite in California, and (seemingly) most crags in between. Ice climbing In 1977, Barber travelled with Rob Taylor to Scotland and Norway to climb waterfalls. They did the (likely) first ascent of the Vettisfossen near Ardal, Norway (300m, WI5), among other climbs. In early 1978, Henry and partner Rob Taylor attempted the first ascent of the Breach Wall on Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. Taylor fell while leading steep ice, and broke his ankle very badly. The details of what happened following the accident vary depending on which of the two parties is telling the story. Barber's party says that Barber helped Taylor descend; got him to a hospital; and then left to fly back to the United States to keep a speaking commitment. Taylor's party says that Barber abandoned him on the mountain, forcing him to climb down alone with his leg mangled. He somehow reached the rainforest at the base of the mountain and was rescued by local tribesman. Taylor nearly lost his leg at the hospital, and felt abandoned by his partner. After he recovered, Taylor wrote articles and a book (The Breach, Putnam, 1981) painting Barber in a very unflattering light. This incident effectively ended Taylor's career as a top climber. Barber continued to climb at a very high level after the Taylor incident, for example making the first free ascent of Women in Love (5.12), Cathedral Ledge, New Hampshire. Barber continues to travel worldwide, climbing in his own style and learning other's styles. He eschews modern camming devices and harnesses, preferring the simpler, more rigorous style of nuts and swami belt. Barber currently lives near North Conway, New Hampshire. He still climbs, and presents climbing slide shows and lectures. Bibliography  Williams, Richard (2005) Shawangunk Rock Climbs: The Trapps, esp.

Williams of Wilmington; acquired on 27 November 1944; and commissioned on 28 November 1944, with Lieutenant Commander D. MacInnes in command. Service history Catron stood out of San Pedro, California, on 18 January 1945, bound for training in the Solomon and Florida Islands. She arrived at Purvis Bay on 5 February, and on 21 March reported at Ulithi, Caroline Islands, to combat load for the assault on Okinawa. Carrying men of the 6th Marines and their cargo, she arrived off Okinawa for the initial assault on 1 April. Through the first week of the last large campaign of the Pacific War, Catron remained offshore for the next week, landing cargo to support the Marines in their push across the island. Leaving Okinawa on 7 April 1945, Catron sailed to San Francisco to load cargo which she delivered to Guam on 13 June. Here she embarked 297 Japanese prisoners of war with whom she arrived at San Francisco on 5 July. After a brief overhaul, she was underway with cargo for Okinawa, where she called from 12 to 24 August. Her next passage was to the Philippines, where she embarked occupation troops for transportation to Japan, arriving on 25 September. Here Catron took aboard 562 former prisoners of war whom she carried home to San Francisco, arriving on 19 October. Catron made two more voyages from San Francisco to carry troops to the Philippines between 29 October 1945 and 12 February 1946, when she reported at Pearl Harbor to be stripped in preparation for \\"Operation Crossroads\\" the atomic tests at Bikini.

Jackals are fond of the fruit, hence the common names. It is a member of the family Ebenaceae, and is related to the true ebony (D. ebenum) and edible persimmon (D. kaki). Description Mature trees have dark gray fissured bark. An adult tree reaches an average of 4 to 6 metres in height, though occasionally trees reach 25 metres. The foliage is dense and dark green with elliptical leaves, which are often eaten by grazing animals such as elephants and buffalo. The tree flowers in the rainy season; the flowers are imperfect, with genders on separate trees, and are cream- colored. The female tree bears fruit in the dry season and these are eaten by many wild animals; they are oval-shaped, yellow or purple when ripe and about 20‚Äì30 mm in diameter. The fruit remain embedded in the persistent calyx lobes. Like the marula, the tree is favoured by the Bantu, who will leave them growing in their cultivated lands in order to harvest the fruit. Habit Jackalberry trees often grow on termite mounds, preferring deep alluvial soils, but are not uncommon on sandy soils in savanna. It grows in mutualism with termites, which aerate the soil around its roots but do not eat the living wood; in turn, the tree provides protection for the termites. The jackalberry is the largest member of its genus in the southern subtropics, and is northwards present to the Sahara. It occurs in high densities from subtropical to tropical regions.  Uses  =Fruit= Fruiting branch of the female tree A traditional food plant in Africa, this fruit has potential to improve nutrition, boost food security, foster rural development and support sustainable landcare. The fruit is edible for humans; its flavor has been described as lemon-like, with a chalky consistency when unripe, and sweet fleshy when ripe. On average the fruit contains 2-5 brown seeds. Most people prefer letting them dry before eating, and the dry ones are stored and consumed as a snack when the fresh fruit goes out of season. They are sometimes preserved, can be dried and ground into a flour, and are often used for brewing beer and brandy. The Ovambo people call the fruit of the jackalberry eenyandi and use it to distill ombike, their traditional liquor. =Medicinal= The leaves, bark and roots of the tree contain tannin, which can be used as a styptic to staunch bleeding. The roots are consumed to purge parasites and are thought to be a remedy for leprosy. =Wood= The wood of the jackalberry is almost impervious to termite damage. The heart wood is fine-grained and strong, and is often used for making wood floors and furniture. Trunks of the tree are used for canoes. The wood ranges in color from light reddish-brown to a very dark brown.

The garden is both a visitor attraction and a centre for botanical research and conservation, and features the world's largest single-span glasshouse measuring long by wide. The National Botanic Garden of Wales seeks \\"to develop a viable world-class national botanic garden dedicated to the research and conservation of biodiversity, lifelong learning and the enjoyment of the visitor.\\" The Garden is a registered charity reliant upon funding from visitors, friends, grants and gifts. Significant start-up costs were shared with the UK Millennium Fund. History of the site View through the restored Wallace Garden towards the Paxton built Principality House. The garden features a bronze bust of Alfred Russel Wallace by the sculptor Anthony Smith. The Middleton family from Oswestry built a mansion here in the early 17th century. In 1789 Sir William Paxton bought the estate for ¬£40,000 to create a water park. He used his great wealth to employ some of the finest creative minds of his day, including the eminent architect Samuel Pepys Cockerell, whom he commissioned to design and build a new Middleton Hall, turning the original one into a farm. The new Middleton Hall became ‚Äòone of the most splendid mansions in South Wales‚Äô which ‚Äòfar eclipsed the proudest of the Cambrian mansions in Asiatic pomp and splendour‚Äô. Paxton created an ingenious water park. Water flowed around the estate via a system of interconnecting lakes, ponds and streams linked by a network of dams, water sluices, bridges and cascades. Spring water was stored in elevated reservoirs that fed into a lead cistern on the mansion‚Äôs roof, allowing Paxton‚Äôs residence to enjoy piped running water and the very latest luxury, water closets. In 1806, Paxton engaged Pepys Cockerell again to design and then oversee the construction of Paxton's Tower on the estate, which was completed in 1809. A Neo-Gothic folly erected in honour of Lord Nelson, it is situated on a hilltop near Llanarthney in the Towy Valley. Today the folly is now owned by the National Trust. By the time of Paxton's death in 1824, Middleton Hall estate covered some . The sale agents engaged that year described the estate thus in their catalogue: Middleton Hall estate was sold to Jamaican-born West India merchant, Edward Hamlin Adams, for ¬£54,700. Adams, neither a gardener nor a lover of water features, added buildings that aided his love of country sports, but let the bath houses fall into disrepair. Of the gardens, only those immediately visible from the house were maintained. In 1842 the estate passed into the hands of his eccentric son Edward, who immediately changed his name from Adams into the Welsh form Abadam. Not loving the country or gardens, according to his estate manager Thomas Cooke, Edward was a social nightmare. As his son predeceased him, on his death in 1875 the estate passed to his eldest daughter, Lucy, then next sister Adah who had married into the local Hughes family. In 1919 the estate changed hands again when Major William J. H. Hughes sold it to Colonel William N. Jones. His youngest daughter Alice Abadam was a leading suffragist, and a blue plaque to her was unveiled on the centenary of women's suffrage in the gardens of what had been Middleton Hall, her childhood home, by her great-niece Margaret Vaughan. In 1931, the mansion was completely gutted by fire, leaving only the walls standing, themselves covered in globules of molten lead from the melted roof. After this the estate fell into decline, and 20 years later the walls of the main house were pulled down. The site was then bought by Carmarthenshire County Council, and leased to young farmers hoping to make their way into an agricultural career. A tree on the site, known as the Llanarthne oak, was almost cut down at this time during the clearance of a paddock on one of the farms. Enzo please note although not a Redwood Wales on Line. It survived and in 2016 was named as Wales's Tree of the Year. History of the garden View from over the Great Glasshouse at the National Botanic Garden of Wales, towards Paxton's Tower The Great Glasshouse at National Botanic Garden of Wales In 1978, interest had been captured by local walkers, who were keen to revive the splendour of what they could see around them. Setting up a fund raising scheme, the little money raised led to the rediscovery of a number of historical features. The idea for a National Botanic Garden of Wales originated from the Welsh artist, William Wilkins, whose aunt had described to him the ruins of an elaborate water features she had discovered while walking in the local woods at Pont Felin Gat. Under the guidance of the Welsh Historic Gardens Trust, an application was made to the Millennium Commission to fund Britain‚Äôs first national botanic garden for 200 years. Virtually on the site of Cockerell's mansion, the Great Glasshouse now forms the centrepiece. Much of the original water-scape has been restored, and extended by introducing cascades to the western approach to the Glasshouse. The extraordinary original view the east side of the mansion offered over the grounds has been restored, extending as originally to Paxton's Tower in the distance. Many experts have commented that this view gives visitors an ability to see and hence understand something of what the great landscape architects of the end of the eighteenth century understood by the word \\"Picturesque\\". The Garden was opened to the public for the first time on 24 May 2000, and was officially opened on 21 July by the Prince of Wales. In 2003, the garden ran into serious financial difficulties, and in 2004 it accepted a financial package from the Welsh Assembly Government, Carmarthenshire County Council and the Millennium Commission to secure its future.p. 592, The Welsh Academy Encyclopedia of Wales. Cardiff: University of Wales Press 2008. The site extends to , and among the garden's rare and threatened plants is the whitebeam Sorbus leyana. 21st Century approaches to recycling and conservation have been used in the design of the centre: biomass recycling is used to provide heating for some of the facilities such as the visitor centre and glasshouses.National Botanic Garden of Wales: The Biomass Energy Centre With many plant exhibits now fully mature, and exhibits and activities to attract younger visitors, three quarters of income is now self- generated, with the remaining quarter in grants. In 2019, there were 160,000 visitors, quoted as being a \\"sustainable average\\". Botanical collections Inside the Great Glasshouse, designed by Foster and Partners. Placed virtually on the same site as Paxton's new but now demolished Middleton Hall, the Great Glasshouse, designed by Foster and Partners, is the largest structure of its kind in the world.

Housing plants from several Mediterranean climate regions, the plants are divided into sections from Chile, Western Australia, South Africa, California, the Canary Islands and the Mediterranean itself. The Double Walled Garden has been rebuilt from the ruins, and is being developed to house a wide variety of plants, including a modern interpretation of a kitchen garden in one quarter, and ornamental beds to display the classification and evolution of all flowering plant families in the other three quarters. In 2007, a new tropical glasshouse, designed by Welsh architect John Belle, was opened to continue the classification displays with tropical monocotyledons. In 2015 a large collection of Welsh apple varieties was planted. A Welsh pomona (annotated survey) is planned.

The Hanish Islands () are an island group in the Red Sea. Most of them are a part of Yemen, but before 1998 they were claimed by Eritrea as well. After a case in an international court under the guidance of Abdul Karim al-Iryani, Yemen was granted full ownership of the larger Islands, and Eritrea was awarded the peripheral islands to the southwest. The three largest islands are Jabal Zuqar to the north (about 130 km¬≤), Al-anƒ´sh al-Kabƒ´r (Great Anƒ´sh) to the south (about 116 km¬≤), with the much smaller Al-anƒ´sh al-·π¢aghƒ´r (Little Anƒ´sh) in between.  History  French-built lighthouse on the Hanish Islands The Hanish Islands were claimed by the Ottoman Empire, a claim abandoned by Turkey in 1923. In June 1915 the islands were occupied by Britain to \\"Forestall the Italians\\". From that point forward they were administered by the Italian colony of Eritrea until 1941. In that year, after the surrender of the Italian colonial forces, the British army established Eritrea as a protectorate. Throughout the 1970s, Ethiopia (which had annexed Eritrea) and Yemen claimed the islands. Ethiopian interest stemmed from the fact that Eritrean independence groups used the Hanish Islands and the nearby Zuqar Island as a base to attack Ethiopian military interests. In 1991, Eritrea gained independence and, in 1996, attempted to exercise sovereignty over the archipelago, starting the Hanish Islands conflict, which was eventually ended after a brief conflict between Eritrea and Yemen over the islands. In all, 3‚Äì12 Eritreans and 4‚Äì15 Yemenis were killed in the fighting. During the 2015 Yemeni Civil War, the archipelago was the scene of intense fighting between forces loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh and Houthi insurgents on one side and forces loyal to acting president Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, backed by Gulf Arab coalition forces, on the other.

Retrieved January 8, 2019.) was an American bass guitar player known for his work as a session musician in Los Angeles with the Wrecking Crew and Nashville with the A-Team of studio musicians during the 1960s through the 1980s.  Biography  =Early career= Osborn began his career working in local clubs, then played on a hit record by singer Dale Hawkins. He moved to Las Vegas at age 20, and spent a year playing backup for country singer Bob Luman. With legendary guitar player Roy Buchanan among his bandmates, Osborn switched from guitar to electric bass. In 1960, with Allen \\"Puddler\\" Harris, a native of Franklin Parish, also in northeastern Louisiana, and James Burton, originally from Webster Parish, he joined pop star Ricky Nelson's backup band, where he spent four years. His playing on such Nelson hits as \\"Travelin' Man\\" began attracting wider notice, and he found opportunities to branch out into studio work with artists such as Johnny Rivers. =Studio bassist in Los Angeles= When the Nelson band dissolved in 1964, Osborn turned to studio work in Los Angeles full-time. For the next ten years, he was considered a \\"first-call\\" bassist among Los Angeles studio musicians (known as The Wrecking Crew), and he worked with well-known producers such as Lou Adler and Bones Howe, frequently in combination with drummer Hal Blaine and keyboardist Larry Knechtel‚Äîthe combination of Blaine, Osborn and Knechtel have been referred to as the Hollywood Golden Trio. His bass can be heard on many of the hit records cut in Los Angeles during that time, along with numerous film scores and television commercials. His playing can be heard on records by such well-known groups as The Mamas & the Papas, The Association, The Grass Roots and The 5th Dimension. Osborn can be heard on Simon & Garfunkel's \\"Bridge over Troubled Water\\" and the 5th Dimension's version of \\"Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In\\". A song featuring prominently mixed bass in melodic counterpoint to acoustic guitars is the 1972 hit single \\"Ventura Highway\\" by the group America. He also played on several Johnny Rivers records. Osborn played on many of Neil Diamond's major hits in the late 1960s and early to middle 1970s, including the hauntingly unique bass lines on \\"Holly Holy\\" in 1969. Osborn is also known for his discovery and encouragement of the popular brother-and-sister duo, the Carpenters, on whose albums he played bass throughout their career. He can be heard playing on several of Nancy Sinatra's 1970's recordings and he was the bassist on the 1977 Christian album Forgiven by Don Francisco. Osborn in 2012. =Work in Nashville= In 1974, Osborn left Los Angeles and moved to the country and western capital, Nashville. He continued an active studio career, playing behind such vocalists as Kenny Rogers, Mel Tillis, and Hank Williams, Jr. One count listed Osborn as bassist on fifty-three number one hits on the country charts and at least 197 that were in the top 40's. Osborn's musical gift has been credited to over 242 different songs, with many performances going uncredited in his early years.Rate Your Music Osborn left Nashville in 1988 and settled in Keithville in Caddo Parish near Shreveport in northwestern Louisiana. =Later life= From 2005 until December 2018, he continued to live in semi-retirement and record occasionally. He enjoyed continuing to create new charts and recordings with Richard Carpenter, as well as playing bass at his local church. Joe continued to inspire and work in the studio locally through May 2017, with his most recent credit being given on the album by Micah and the Jazzgrass ApocalypseMicah and the Jazzgress Apocalypse which was released in August 2018. Osborn was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in early 2018 and died on December 14, 2018 at his home. Equipment and style Osborn's instrument throughout most of his recording career was a 1960 Fender stack-knob Jazz Bass, which was given to him by Fender just prior to touring Australia with Nelson. Osborn said he was initially disappointed that Fender had not sent him a Precision Bass, which he had been using, but he said he grew to like the Jazz Bass because the narrower neck made it easier for his short fingers. He strung the bass with LaBella flatwound bass strings that he did not change for 20 years and his style was distinctive, with a resonant, bright tone produced, in part, by his use of a plectrum (pick). This very bass is on permanent display at Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville, TN. Many producers and arrangers chose to spotlight his contributions by mixing the bass line more prominently than had been customary, and incorporating brief bass solos into their arrangements. He had a signature bass, the \\"Joe Osborn Signature\\", made by American guitar manufacturer Lakland, although it is now called the \\"44-60 Vintage J Bass\\". In 2012, Fender Guitar built a custom Fender Jazz Bass for Osborn according to his desired specifications. He recorded with this bass for the first time when producing and playing bass on teen musician Matthew Davidson's debut recording.

Its first commander was Colonel Enoch Poor, with Joseph Cilley as major. Many of the men who served in the unit hailed from southeastern New Hampshire and western Maine (then part of Massachusetts). During the first part of its service, the regiment took part in the siege of Boston, and there is a link below in the reference section to the orderly book of an officer in the unit during that time. History =1776= In 1776, the 2nd New Hampshire also became known as the 8th Continental Regiment, though that designation would revert to the 2nd NH by the end of that year. After the capture of Boston in March, the 2nd New Hampshire saw action at the Battle of Trois-Rivi√®res in Quebec, and by July 1776 they had retreated south to Fort Ticonderoga and helped construct a new fort across Lake Champlain on Rattlesnake Hill (which became known as Mount Independence in July 1776). At an exhibition currently at the fort, an original 8th Continental Regiment button that was probably worn on the coat of a New Hampshire soldier is on display for visitors to see.http://www.fortticonderoga.org/visit/what-to-see/museum/founding-fashion The 2nd NH/8th Continentals remained at Fort Ticonderoga until November 1776, when the New Hampshire units marched south to join the rest of the Continental Army and fought in the legendary winter battles of Trenton and Princeton in late 1776/early 1777. By the spring of 1777, the 2nd New Hampshire had marched back north to Mount Independence and Fort Ticonderoga, the headquarters of the American Northern Army, where they would remain until July. =1777= In the spring of 1777, several thousand stands of French arms arrived at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and were transported to Fort Ticonderoga/Mount Independence on Lake Champlain where the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd New Hampshire Regiments were encamped. These Yankee soldiers must have eagerly exchanged their old hunting fowlers and Committee of Safety muskets which they had used for the first two years of the conflict for these state of the art French weapons, which today are the only surviving regimentally marked American arms from the Revolutionary War. These handsome guns became popularly known as \\"Charleville\\" muskets, for one of the armories where they were made in France; \\"Charleville\\" was often inscribed on the lockplate. Once the guns were in American hands in 1777, the barrel of each musket was also stamped with letters \\"NH\\" as well as the battalion, and individually numbered. These weapons served the New Hampshire troops well for the remainder of the war. One French Model 1768 musket issued to a man in the 2nd NH is now preserved at the NRA Museum.http://www.nramuseum.org/the-museum/the-galleries/seeds-of- greatness/case-26-lafayette-the-first-us-pattern-arms/french- model-1768-flintlock-musket.aspx After Enoch Poor was promoted to Brigadier, Nathan Hale was commissioned colonel of the 2nd New Hampshire Regiment in April 1777. Only three months later, at Hubbardton, Vermont, in July, Colonel Hale, Captain James Carr and part of the regiment were captured by the British Army in a surprise dawn attack as the New Hampshire soldiers were having breakfast. While Hale was fortunate to not have been with the regiment during its sufferings at Valley Forge in 1778, he died as a POW in September 1780, the same month that General Enoch Poor died as well. After Hale's capture, George Reid of Londonderry took command of the regiment until the end of the war. Flags or colors which belonged to the 2nd NH were captured at Fort Anne in July 1777 during the retreat from Fort Ticonderoga. After more than a century, they were returned from Britain, and are on display today at the Tuck Library of the New Hampshire Historical Society in Concord. They are among the only American battle flags from the Revolutionary War known to exist. The colors containing the motto \\"The Glory Not the Prey\\" are marked \\"2nd NH Regt\\", while the other colors captured at the time, the linked 13 rings, were likely a type of national color. Two other flags captured by the British at Skenesboro were also noted and they had similar designs, especially another with the 13 linked rings. While their colors were lost, the 2nd New Hampshire fought bravely in the autumn of 1777, where they were heavily engaged with British forces at Saratoga, leading to the surrender of General John Burgoyne's army. =Final years= In 1778, the 2nd NH survived the horrors of Valley Forge and then fought at the scorching fields of Monmouth in June. In 1779, they were part of General John Sullivan's controversial campaign against Loyalists and Iroquois allied with the British. By 1781, the best soldiers of the 2nd New Hampshire had become designated as light infantry to serve as flankers and shock troops for the Continental Army. They served with distinction under the Marquis de Lafayette during the victorious Yorktown Campaign that year and returned north to New York afterwards. During the summer of 1783 after eight years of hard service, the 2nd Regiment was merged into the 1st New Hampshire Regiment and were disbanded on January 1, 1784. The 2nd New Hampshire, along with the 1st and 3rd Regiments, were among the most effective American units of the Revolutionary War and played a vital role in securing American independence. Present-day portrayals Today, the 2nd New Hampshire/8th Continental Regiment is recreated by a group of living historians dedicated to portraying this illustrious unit as authentically as possible. The group portrays one company of the regiment through its various uniforms and equipage over the course of the American Revolution, from the civilian hunting fowlers and \\"small clothes\\" of the militia to the distinctive uniform and Charleville muskets of the light infantry in 1781. The unit portrayed was originally a militia company commanded by Captain Jonathan Wentworth in what is now Dover and Rollinsford in Strafford County, New Hampshire. Capt. Wentworth was unfortunately court martialed and cashiered in July 1776 for dereliction of duty, though he claimed it was because he was lacking a tent and still recovering from \\"small pox and camp distemper\\". Though Wentworth was exonerated and returned to the army a few years later, in 1776 command of the company passed to Lieutenant James Carr. He became paymaster in 1779, and Samuel Cherry, originally a native of Ireland, became company commander and led the soldiers during their greatest moment at Yorktown when they stormed the British lines.

In 1928 he translated Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice into Romanian. In 1915 Bretan married pianist Nora Osv√°t. In 1944, Osv√°t's family, who were Jewish, were transported to the Auschwitz concentration camp and murdered.

Following the death of Jim Robinson (Alan Dale) in 1993, she remained the only original character left in the series until her own death in 1997, making her the second longest-serving original character after her grandson Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis). Creation and casting Helen is one of the twelve original characters conceived by the creator and then executive producer of Neighbours, Reg Watson.Oram 1988, p.116. Watson invited Haddy to play Helen in a bid to portray a mother-in-law out of conjunction with the battleaxe stereotype. The role required Haddy and her husband James Condon to relocate from Sydney to Melbourne for filming. Haddy admitted that it was a big decision. As the couple were settling into their new home, Haddy learned Seven Network had cancelled Neighbours. She said \\"My heart fell to the floor. Jim and I had moved all our furniture from Sydney to Melbourne and the thought of packing up again was too much.\\" The serial was soon picked up by Network Ten and Condon joined the cast alongside his wife. Haddy commented that she was \\"working like a dog and loving every minute of it.\\" She also liked that she was not treated \\"like an old crock\\" on set. Development Helen's character outline, detailing her fictional backstory, appeared in James Oram's 1988 book Neighbours: Behind the Scenes: Haddy thought Helen was similar to herself, saying that she was \\"very supportive, downright, earthy and very modern in her ideas. She wasn't when she was younger but she's developed that way through her experiences.\\" Helen is a caring woman, often being portrayed as \\"a shoulder to cry on\\" for her friends and family, She has a sympathetic nature and offers motherly advice to anyone who needs it. Helen's storylines have sometimes been tragic, but she always remains the voice of reason and helps those around her. In the Neighbours twentieth anniversary book she is described as being the serial's matriarch for over 12 years. Also described as \\"having a heart of gold\\" and \\"not only being the linchpin of the Ramsay Street community, but she opened her heart and home to anyone in need of care and attention.\\" In 1997, Haddy was forced to quit the serial due to her own ill health. Storylines She married her first husband Bill Daniels at age seventeen and remained married to him for over thirty years until his death in 1969. Years after she was devastated to find out he had an affair with her best friend Grace Barnett (Marijke Mann). The couple had a biological daughter, Anne, and an adopted daughter, Rosemary (Joy Chambers). Anne married Jim Robinson (Alan Dale) and had three children with him ‚Äì Paul (Stefan Dennis), Scott (Darius Perkins; Jason Donovan) and Julie (Julie Mullins) ‚Äì before dying while giving birth to Lucy. After Anne's death, Helen moved into the Robinsons' home at 26 Ramsay Street, to help Jim with the family. In the show's storyline Helen helped run the Robinson household. During her time in Erinsborough she endured the deaths of her son- in-law Jim, as well as her grandchild Julie. Her other grandchildren gradually departed, and Julie's widower Philip Martin (Ian Rawlings) and his children, Debbie (Marnie Reece-Wilmore) and Hannah Martin (Rebecca Ritters) moved into the Robinson house. During her 12 and a half years on the show, Helen was charged with drink driving, buried a granddaughter, had an affair with her daughter's fianc√©, was kidnapped, was evicted, was widowed, told her daughter she was adopted and had a bout of depression after son in law Jim Robinson died. In the storyline Helen remarried twice, first in 1991 to Michael Daniels (Brian Blain), her first husband's cousin. Michael was soon revealed as a bigamist who was still married to his first wife Louise (Maggie Payne) and so the marriage was annulled. She later married Reuben White (James Condon) in 1995; however, he died soon afterwards. After becoming increasingly frail and spending a long time in hospital, Helen returned home on her birthday in 1997. After watching a ten-year-old video of Scott and Charlene's wedding, with Philip, Debbie, Hannah and her friends Harold (Ian Smith) and Madge Bishop (Anne Charleston) around her, she fell asleep on the sofa and died. A memorial service was held at Lassiter's lake where her ashes were laid. At the end of the episode, Helen became the third character to have her death marked by the sad piano theme tune and tribute stills. However, for the first, and so far only time, there were no actual credits shown, given her exceptionally important and long-standing role in the show. Reception For her portrayal of Helen, Haddy won the Sustained Performance by an Actress in a Series accolade at the 1987 Penguin Awards. In 1995, Haddy was nominated for Most Popular Actress at the 1st National Television Awards. The following year, Haddy received an Inside Soap Award nomination for Best Single Performance by a Female, as Helen grieved for Reuben. At the two subsequent ceremonies, Haddy won Best Soap Veteran, and Helen was nominated for Most Missed Character. Anthony Hayward of The Independent described Helen for Anne Haddy's obituary, he stated: \\"When the serial started, Helen was the widowed mother-in-law of Jim Robinson, and to the Robinson family she was known as \\"The Rock of Gibraltar\\". She was the diplomat and voice of reason to whom residents of Ramsay Street, in the fictional Melbourne suburb of Erinsborough, turned for advice.\\" He also branded her \\"the most glamorous granny on television\\". Ruth Deller of television website Lowculture gave Helen a 5 out of 5 for her contribution to Neighbours, during a feature called \\"A guide to recognising your Ramsays and Robinsons\\". Deller called Helen \\"The most respected elder of the Robinson clan\\". She added \\"Helen was a local artist renowned for her 'interesting' paintings of the locals and her tendency to take in waifs and strays. She also had an unfortunate habit of marrying conmen, bigamists or men who died shortly after their wedding. Helen was always the voice of reason, and when she died (sadly followed closely by Anne Haddy, who played her), the street lost perhaps its most beloved character ever\\". In 2010 to celebrate Neighbours' 25th anniversary Sky, a British satellite broadcasting company profiled 25 characters of which they believed were the most memorable in the series history. Helen is in the list and describing her they state: \\"According to the mid-nineties joke, what will be left at the end of the world? Cockroaches and Helen Daniels. Well, you could guarantee that in such an event, Helen would take in the waifier, strayier cockroaches and rehabilitate them off the path to juvenile centre. Helen was a far gentler matriarch than her British equivalents, dealing with the problems of all the neighbourhood teens, which presumably revolved around waxing for her own grandkids Debbie and Hannah. Her name lives on in her eponymous charity foundation, and as the painter of that dreadful portrait of the Kennedy children in Karl and Susan's front room.\\" Editor of MSN TV, Lorna Cooper branded Helen a 'kindly matriarch' for caring for many of the shows teenagers. ATV News labeled Helen one of their icons, describing her capacity to love as great, even after all the tragic events she had lived through, subsequently branded her as a shoulder to cry on for all of her neighbours. They also compared her to Meg Richardson, a fellow fictional character from UK serial drama Crossroads, which was also created by Reg Watson, stating they are well known to be similar and often drew these comparisons in Helen's time in the serial. Josephine Monroe in her book \\"Neighbours: The first 10 Years\\", describes Helen as being the \\"linchpin of Neighbours\\", adding that everyone wanted to be her friend and would turn to her for help and that she is universally loved. In her book \\"Soap opera\\", Dorothy Hobson describes Helen as breaking the stereotype for older women stating: \\"She was a very attractive woman, probably in her sixties, who had a successful career as an artist a number of romances and led a completely independent life, whilst still providing stability within the family.\\" References Neighbours characters Fictional artists Television characters introduced in 1985 Female characters in television ","title":"Helen Daniels"},{"id":"3542419","text":"Nagaon (previously Nowgong), is a city and a municipal board in Nagaon district in the Indian state of Assam.

Nalbari town is also the headquarters of Nalbari District.  Etymology  The word Nalbari derived from Nal and Bari. Nal is variety of reed while Bari is enclosed ground with plantation. History The history of Nalbari dates back to many centuries B.C. The area also produced a special perfume among others.

As the train started running through, certain traders and businessmen from outside the state came and interacted with the local people. Business transactions were started on the rail station road. The Nalbari M.E. School had been started in the meantime to the Gurdon School site, and it was upgraded into a High School named Gurdon High School in 1917. Both these two events attracted the people to throng to the area which had changed its shape and size. It became a strong business centre with great growth potentials in the whole of the north bank of the river. Migration started in a significant way. Population increased, administrative offices were started gradually and in 1931, it assumed an urban look. In 1941, it was declared as one of the town in Kamrup district with a town committee with a population of 3578. In 1945, the Nalbari College was started in a temporary shed and in 1950 it was shifted to its present site which helped in the growth of the Bidyapur-Shantipur area of the town into a densely populated area. The establishment of the PWD offices on the Palla road, led to the growth of the Gopalbazar area.

Tourism Hari Mandir, the major landmark of Nalbari * Planetarium and Science Centre - The Planetarium and the Science Centre is located at Sariahtali. Its Planetarium dome organises regular shows. The centre has various corners dedicated to different Scientific phenomenon. * Kamrup Sanskrit Sanjivani Sabha - The Kamrup Sanskrit Sanjivani Sabha was formed in 1930's to preserve ancient Sanskrit manuscripts. It library contains thousands of rare Sanskrit manuscripts. * Billeshwar Temple - The temple is dedicated to God Krishna, is over 500 years old. It is believed that a Shivalinga was unearthed in this place and hence it is notable that a temple for Lord Krishna is constructed in this site. Legends state that a priest who lived here owned a cow, which regularly gave milk to virina, a grass type. The king of the state was intrigued about it and he ordered the place to be dug up to find a Shivalinga on the spot. Following the incident, a temple was constructed here but it was dedicated to Krishna. Ahom king and Lakshmi Singha rebuilt the temple, which faced the wrath of natural disaster. * Hari Mandir - The temple is major landmark of the town. Its history is correlated with the Ras Mahotsav being organized in Nalbari district since early twentieth century. The evolution of the Hari Mandir is been a saga of decades. The history of the Hari Mandir is connected to the Ras Puja of Nalbari. In the year 1931, under leading of the then Engineer Amar Kundu of Nalbari Public Works Department (PWD) and Veterinary Assistant Naren Basu and some of the local people including Gadamalla Barua, Dandiram Mahajan, Rabi Mahajan, Tanuram Das, Keertiram Thikadar, Padmapani Dutta and Bhairab Choudhury organized a meet at the official residence of engineer Kundu. Their issue of meet was about to organize Ras Puja at Nalbari. Though they weren't able to organize Ras Puja in the same year, but in the next year they were able to organize the Puja at the free space of the PWD Engineer Amar Kundu's official residence. In 1933, Ras Puja Committee was formed to organize the Puja. In that year, with the help of public donation, the Ras Puja was organized publicly at the Hatkhola (old) of Nalbari. At that time the Ras Puja was initiated religiously and was an occasion of 3 days. Soon after few years, the Ras Puja became popular and the organizers had to think about a new place for the Puja, as the need of wider place arose. The organizers and the local people searched for a permanent public plot to maintain the continuity of the Puja. Finally the permanent public plot found at the Dag No 584 of Nalbari town, with the grateful help of the then Sub-Deputy Collector Krishna Ram Medhi, and this is the plot till existing with current age. The plot was a private ownership property of which revenue was pending for many years. With a negotiation with the plot owner and Ras Puja comity, witnessed by the then Mouzadar Pratap Narayan Choudhury, the ownership of the plot was transferred to the Hari Mandir. In year 1939, the foundation of the Mandir (currently the old mandir) was imposed with the 4 wooden post of Shal donated by Priyanath Kabiraz of Alengidal. In year 1946 the Ras Puja was shifted from the Hathkhola (old) to the plot of the Hari Mandir. Late Damahuram Mahajan played the prime role in the construction of the Hari Mandir (old), which was completed in 1965. With help of his donation the Puja Mandap was constructed in 1968. With the change of ages, the popularity of Ras Puja increased year by year, so the growth of the Mandir too. Very sooner the Ras Puja festival turned from Utsava to Mahotsava with the continuation of public interest, co operation & donation. At the initial ages, the Ras Mahotsava was an occasion of 3 days, but in the decade of 1960 it became an occasion of 5 days, and then it became occasion of 7 days in the decade of 1970.

History =The Wardlaw Country Day School= In 1882, the precursor to the Wardlaw School, The Leal School for Boys, headed by Mr. Wardlaw, serving boys from first grade to senior year of high school, was founded in Plainfield, New Jersey. In 1916, Charles Digby \\"Pop\\" Wardlaw moved from teacher to Head and purchased the school, and changed its name to The Wardlaw School. In 1959, the school was purchased from 'Pop' Wardlaw and renamed The Wardlaw Country Day School. The campus on Central Avenue was expanded with a new classroom wing and auditorium. In the late 1960s, the Wardlaw school moved to a campus off Inman Avenue in the bordering town of Edison.The Wardlaw Hartridge School. History. Accessed December 11, 2007. =The Hartridge School for Girls= The Misses Scribner and Newton's School for Girls was founded in 1884 in Plainfield near the Wardlaw School. The school name was changed to The Hartridge School when, in 1903, Miss Hartridge became the school's owner. For many years, the Hartridge School and the Wardlaw School were closely affiliated. Each school would invite students from the other school to dances, and the two schools shared a drama department (out of necessity, as boys and girls were both needed to fill roles in school plays and musicals.) =The Wardlaw-Hartridge School= The Wardlaw School and the Hartridge School merged into one coeducational school, the Wardlaw-Hartridge School, in 1976. The former Hartridge campus became the Oakwood campus for the K - 7 Lower School, while the former Wardlaw Country Day Upper School campus became the home to the Upper school for grades 8 - 12. In 1991, many students of the Vail-Deane School were assimilated into the Wardlaw-Hartridge School. The Vail-Deane school, founded in 1869, boasted a rich history, and the school's Alumni Association was merged with Wardlaw-Hartridge's. In the 1990s, Wardlaw- Hartridge created a 6-8 Middle School on the Edison Campus. In 1997, the consolidation of the lower, middle, and upper schools to a single campus was completed when the Lower School moved into a new wing on the Upper School campus in Edison. Facilities and campus The Wardlaw+Hartridge School sits on a campus including a Performing Arts Center, library, Center For Global Learning, STEM Labs, art studios, two gymnasiums, an indoor swimming pool, fitness center, tennis courts, and two turf fields. =Plans for expansion= In 2003 and 2004, the school remodeled both the Upper School science facilities and the Middle School, increasing classroom size and adding new features to facilitate the use of technology. There is a long-range project referred to as the Strategic Plan 2018-2021 which encompasses several plans to expand the school. This includes extending the Lower School, extending the school to enclose the central courtyard, and building a theater for performing arts.

Students are also exposed to enrichment in learning about Earth sciences and Social Studies, including instruction about the history of New Jersey (in Fourth Grade) and ancient civilizations (in Fifth grade.) Lower School students enjoy \\"specials,\\" instruction in rooms outside their usual classroom. These include a special Science and Technology class, Art Class, Choir, and Band.

Middle School students have little course choice, except in foreign language. The current Middle School Head is Dr. Corinna Crafton. English and Social Studies Middle School English and Social Studies are linked by regional focus. In Sixth Grade, students study Africa, South America, and Asia. In Seventh and Eighth grades, students focus on the United States. In all years, grammar, writing skills, and public speaking are developed between the two subject areas. Mathematics and Science Each Middle School student follows a set curriculum in both math and science. In math, each student progresses from a general math course in sixth grade, through prealgebra in seventh, to algebra I in eighth. In science, students move from topics in life science in sixth, to topics in chemistry in seventh, to earth science in eighth. Foreign Language The Foreign Language curriculum begins by requiring all sixth-grade student to take a survey course, Introduction to World Languages, of Latin, Mandarin, and Spanish. After this, students must choose to continue one of the languages in levels IA and IB in seventh and eighth grades, respectively. This is the only academic course choice offered to Middle School students, but once they have chosen, they may not change for the duration of their Middle School career. Homerooms The Middle School experience is organized around homerooms. Each student is placed in a homeroom of around eleven students as soon as he or she enters the Middle School and stays with that homeroom throughout his or her Middle School career. Each student starts the day in homeroom and eats lunch with the homeroom on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. The homeroom teacher serves as a student's advisor. =The Upper School= The school offers 18 Advanced Placement (AP) classes, and each year, students are recognized as National Merit Commended Scholars and AP Scholars. Since 1999, all students have been required to purchase a laptop computer for use at school, and the school, particularly teacher Tom Hunt, was recognized for this incorporation of technology into the classroom with an Alan Shepard award. The school maintains a WiFi Network, several network-accessible laser printers, and email on the whschool domain to facilitate the students' use of technology for their schoolwork. Upper Schoolers are required to fill a certain number of credits to graduate (currently 24.5). All students must fulfill 4 credits in English, 3 in math, 4 in science, 3 in history, 1 in the arts, 0.5 in health, 1.5-2.5 in various electives, and 2-3 in a foreign language (through level 3.)

For the calculation of GPAs, letter grades are converted into numbers corresponding to the middle percentile of the letter's range, and then averaged. Certain grades are weighted, however: AP grades are factored in with a multiplier of 1.05, and Honors Courses are factored in with a multiplier of 1.025. Wardlaw-Hartridge does not encourage inflation of grades and will only employ a grade curve in extreme cases. However, to make sure one class does not detract greatly from a student's GPA, Wardlaw- Hartridge has a policy by which no student can receive a grade lower than a 55 on his or her semester grade. The current Upper School Head is Dr. Bob Bowman. Arts Wardlaw Hartridge offers instruction in visual and performing arts.

It is an alternative to axiomatic set theory as a foundation for much, but not all, of mathematics. A precursor to second-order arithmetic that involves third-order parameters was introduced by David Hilbert and Paul Bernays in their book Grundlagen der Mathematik. The standard axiomatization of second-order arithmetic is denoted by Z2. Second-order arithmetic includes, but is significantly stronger than, its first-order counterpart Peano arithmetic. Unlike Peano arithmetic, second-order arithmetic allows quantification over sets of natural numbers as well as numbers themselves. Because real numbers can be represented as (infinite) sets of natural numbers in well-known ways, and because second-order arithmetic allows quantification over such sets, it is possible to formalize the real numbers in second-order arithmetic. For this reason, second-order arithmetic is sometimes called ‚Äúanalysis‚Äù (Sieg 2013, p. 291). Second-order arithmetic can also be seen as a weak version of set theory in which every element is either a natural number or a set of natural numbers. Although it is much weaker than Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory, second-order arithmetic can prove essentially all of the results of classical mathematics expressible in its language. A subsystem of second-order arithmetic is a theory in the language of second-order arithmetic each axiom of which is a theorem of full second-order arithmetic (Z2). Such subsystems are essential to reverse mathematics, a research program investigating how much of classical mathematics can be derived in certain weak subsystems of varying strength. Much of core mathematics can be formalized in these weak subsystems, some of which are defined below. Reverse mathematics also clarifies the extent and manner in which classical mathematics is nonconstructive. Definition =Syntax= The language of second-order arithmetic is two-sorted. The first sort of terms and in particular variables, usually denoted by lower case letters, consists of individuals, whose intended interpretation is as natural numbers. The other sort of variables, variously called ‚Äúset variables,‚Äù ‚Äúclass variables,‚Äù or even ‚Äúpredicates‚Äù are usually denoted by upper-case letters. They refer to classes/predicates/properties of individuals, and so can be thought of as sets of natural numbers. Both individuals and set variables can be quantified universally or existentially. A formula with no bound set variables (that is, no quantifiers over set variables) is called arithmetical. An arithmetical formula may have free set variables and bound individual variables. Individual terms are formed from the constant 0, the unary function S (the successor function), and the binary operations + and cdot (addition and multiplication). The successor function adds 1 to its input. The relations = (equality) and < (comparison of natural numbers) relate two individuals, whereas the relation ‚àà (membership) relates an individual and a set (or class). Thus in notation the language of second-order arithmetic is given by the signature mathcal{L}={0,S,+,cdot,=,<,in}. For example, forall n (nin X rightarrow Sn in X), is a well-formed formula of second-order arithmetic that is arithmetical, has one free set variable X and one bound individual variable n (but no bound set variables, as is required of an arithmetical formula)--whereas exists X forall n(nin X leftrightarrow n < SSSSSS0cdot SSSSSSS0) is a well-formed formula that is not arithmetical, having one bound set variable X and one bound individual variable n. =Semantics= Several different interpretations of the quantifiers are possible. If second-order arithmetic is studied using the full semantics of second-order logic then the set quantifiers range over all subsets of the range of the number variables. If second-order arithmetic is formalized using the semantics of first-order logic (Henkin semantics) then any model includes a domain for the set variables to range over, and this domain may be a proper subset of the full powerset of the domain of number variables (Shapiro 1991, pp. 74-75). =Axioms= Basic The following axioms are known as the basic axioms, or sometimes the Robinson axioms. The resulting first-order theory, known as Robinson arithmetic, is essentially Peano arithmetic without induction. The domain of discourse for the quantified variables is the natural numbers, collectively denoted by N, and including the distinguished member  0, called \\"zero.\\" The primitive functions are the unary successor function, denoted by prefix S, and two binary operations, addition and multiplication, denoted by infix \\"+\\" and \\" cdot\\", respectively. There is also a primitive binary relation called order, denoted by infix \\"<\\". Axioms governing the successor function and zero: :1. forall m [Sm=0 rightarrow bot]. (‚Äúthe successor of a natural number is never zero‚Äù) :2. forall m forall n [Sm=Sn rightarrow m=n]. (‚Äúthe successor function is injective‚Äù) :3. forall n [0=n lor exists m [Sm=n] ]. (‚Äúevery natural number is zero or a successor‚Äù) Addition defined recursively: :4. forall m [m+0=m]. :5. forall m forall n [m+Sn = S(m+n)]. Multiplication defined recursively: :6. forall m [mcdot 0 = 0]. :7. forall m forall n [m cdot Sn = (mcdot n)+m]. Axioms governing the order relation \\"<\\": :8. forall m [m<0 rightarrow bot]. (‚Äúno natural number is smaller than zero‚Äù) :9. forall n forall m [m :10. forall n [0=n lor 0 (‚Äúevery natural number is zero or bigger than zero‚Äù) :11. forall m forall n [(Sm These axioms are all first-order statements. That is, all variables range over the natural numbers and not sets thereof, a fact even stronger than their being arithmetical. Moreover, there is but one existential quantifier, in axiom 3. Axioms 1 and 2, together with an axiom schema of induction make up the usual Peano-Dedekind definition of N. Adding to these axioms any sort of axiom schema of induction makes redundant the axioms 3, 10, and 11. Induction and comprehension schema If œÜ(n) is a formula of second- order arithmetic with a free number variable n and possible other free number or set variables (written m‚Ä¢ and X‚Ä¢), the induction axiom for œÜ is the axiom: :forall m forall X ((varphi(0) land forall n (varphi(n) rightarrow varphi(Sn))) rightarrow forall n varphi(n)) The (full) second-order induction scheme consists of all instances of this axiom, over all second- order formulas. One particularly important instance of the induction scheme is when œÜ is the formula ‚Äún in X‚Äù expressing the fact that n is a member of X (X being a free set variable): in this case, the induction axiom for œÜ is :forall X ((0in X land forall n (nin X rightarrow Snin X)) rightarrow forall n (nin X)) This sentence is called the second-order induction axiom. If œÜ(n) is a formula with a free variable n and possibly other free variables, but not the variable Z, the comprehension axiom for œÜ is the formula :exists Z forall n (nin Z leftrightarrow varphi(n)) This axiom makes it possible to form the set Z = { n  varphi(n) } of natural numbers satisfying œÜ(n). There is a technical restriction that the formula œÜ may not contain the variable Z, for otherwise the formula n ot in Z would lead to the comprehension axiom :exists Z forall n ( n in Z leftrightarrow n ot in Z), which is inconsistent. This convention is assumed in the remainder of this article. =The full system= The formal theory of second-order arithmetic (in the language of second-order arithmetic) consists of the basic axioms, the comprehension axiom for every formula œÜ (arithmetic or otherwise), and the second-order induction axiom. This theory is sometimes called full second- order arithmetic to distinguish it from its subsystems, defined below. Because full second-order semantics imply that every possible set exists, the comprehension axioms may be taken to be part of the deductive system when these semantics are employed (Shapiro 1991, p. 66). Models This section describes second-order arithmetic with first-order semantics. Thus a model mathcal{M} of the language of second-order arithmetic consists of a set M (which forms the range of individual variables) together with a constant 0 (an element of M), a function S from M to M, two binary operations + and ¬∑ on M, a binary relation < on M, and a collection D of subsets of M, which is the range of the set variables. Omitting D produces a model of the language of first- order arithmetic. When D is the full powerset of M, the model mathcal{M} is called a full model. The use of full second-order semantics is equivalent to limiting the models of second-order arithmetic to the full models. In fact, the axioms of second-order arithmetic have only one full model. This follows from the fact that the axioms of Peano arithmetic with the second-order induction axiom have only one model under second-order semantics. When M is the usual set of natural numbers with its usual operations, mathcal{M} is called an œâ-model. In this case, the model may be identified with D, its collection of sets of naturals, because this set is enough to completely determine an œâ-model. The unique full omega-model, which is the usual set of natural numbers with its usual structure and all its subsets, is called the intended or standard model of second-order arithmetic. =Definable functions= The first-order functions that are provably total in second-order arithmetic are precisely the same as those representable in system F (Girard and Taylor 1987, pp. 122-123). Almost equivalently, system F is the theory of functionals corresponding to second-order arithmetic in a manner parallel to how G√∂del's system T corresponds to first-order arithmetic in the Dialectica interpretation. Subsystems There are many named subsystems of second-order arithmetic. A subscript 0 in the name of a subsystem indicates that it includes only a restricted portion of the full second-order induction scheme (Friedman 1976). Such a restriction lowers the proof-theoretic strength of the system significantly. For example, the system ACA0 described below is equiconsistent with Peano arithmetic. The corresponding theory ACA, consisting of ACA0 plus the full second-order induction scheme, is stronger than Peano arithmetic. =Arithmetical comprehension= Many of the well-studied subsystems are related to closure properties of models. For example, it can be shown that every œâ-model of full second-order arithmetic is closed under Turing jump, but not every œâ-model closed under Turing jump is a model of full second-order arithmetic. The subsystem ACA0 includes just enough axioms to capture the notion of closure under Turing jump. ACA0 is defined as the theory consisting of the basic axioms, the arithmetical comprehension axiom scheme (in other words the comprehension axiom for every arithmetical formula œÜ) and the ordinary second-order induction axiom. It would be equivalent to include the entire arithmetical induction axiom scheme, in other words to include the induction axiom for every arithmetical formula œÜ. It can be shown that a collection S of subsets of œâ determines an œâ-model of ACA0 if and only if S is closed under Turing jump, Turing reducibility, and Turing join (Simpson 2009, pp. 311-313). The subscript 0 in ACA0 indicates that not every instance of the induction axiom scheme is included this subsystem. This makes no difference for œâ-models, which automatically satisfy every instance of the induction axiom. It is of importance, however, in the study of non-œâ-models. The system consisting of ACA0 plus induction for all formulas is sometimes called ACA with no subscript. The system ACA0 is a conservative extension of first-order arithmetic (or first-order Peano axioms), defined as the basic axioms, plus the first-order induction axiom scheme (for all formulas œÜ involving no class variables at all, bound or otherwise), in the language of first-order arithmetic (which does not permit class variables at all). In particular it has the same proof-theoretic ordinal Œµ0 as first-order arithmetic, owing to the limited induction schema. =The arithmetical hierarchy for formulas= A formula is called bounded arithmetical, or Œî00, when all its quantifiers are of the form ‚àÄnforall n stands for :forall n(n and :exists n stands for :exists n(n. A formula is called Œ£01 (or sometimes Œ£1), respectively Œ†01 (or sometimes Œ†1) when it of the form ‚àÉm‚Ä¢(œÜ), respectively ‚àÄm‚Ä¢(œÜ) where œÜ is a bounded arithmetical formula and m is an individual variable (that is free in œÜ). More generally, a formula is called Œ£0n, respectively Œ†0n when it is obtained by adding existential, respectively universal, individual quantifiers to a Œ†0n‚àí1, respectively Œ£0n‚àí1 formula (and Œ£00 and Œ†00 are all equivalent to Œî00). By construction, all these formulas are arithmetical (no class variables are ever bound) and, in fact, by putting the formula in Skolem prenex form one can see that every arithmetical formula is equivalent to a Œ£0n or Œ†0n formula for all large enough n. =Recursive comprehension= The subsystem RCA0 is a weaker system than ACA0 and is often used as the base system in reverse mathematics. It consists of: the basic axioms, the Œ£01 induction scheme, and the Œî01 comprehension scheme. The former term is clear: the Œ£01 induction scheme is the induction axiom for every Œ£01 formula œÜ. The term ‚ÄúŒî01 comprehension‚Äù is more complex, because there is no such thing as a Œî01 formula. The Œî01 comprehension scheme instead asserts the comprehension axiom for every Œ£01 formula which is equivalent to a Œ†01 formula. This scheme includes, for every Œ£01 formula œÜ and every Œ†01 formula œà, the axiom: :forall m forall X ((forall n (varphi(n) leftrightarrow psi(n))) rightarrow exists Z forall n (nin Z leftrightarrow varphi(n))) The set of first- order consequences of RCA0 is the same as those of the subsystem IŒ£1 of Peano arithmetic in which induction is restricted to Œ£01 formulas. In turn, IŒ£1 is conservative over primitive recursive arithmetic (PRA) for Pi^0_2 sentences. Moreover, the proof-theoretic ordinal of mathrm{RCA}_0 is œâœâ, the same as that of PRA. It can be seen that a collection S of subsets of œâ determines an œâ-model of RCA0 if and only if S is closed under Turing reducibility and Turing join. In particular, the collection of all computable subsets of œâ gives an œâ-model of RCA0. This is the motivation behind the name of this system‚Äîif a set can be proved to exist using RCA0, then the set is recursive (i.e. computable). = Weaker systems = Sometimes an even weaker system than RCA0 is desired. One such system is defined as follows: one must first augment the language of arithmetic with an exponential function (in stronger systems the exponential can be defined in terms of addition and multiplication by the usual trick, but when the system becomes too weak this is no longer possible) and the basic axioms by the obvious axioms defining exponentiation inductively from multiplication; then the system consists of the (enriched) basic axioms, plus Œî01 comprehension, plus Œî00 induction. =Stronger systems= Over ACA0, each formula of second-order arithmetic is equivalent to a Œ£1n or Œ†1n formula for all large enough n. The system Œ†11-comprehension is the system consisting of the basic axioms, plus the ordinary second-order induction axiom and the comprehension axiom for every Œ†11 formula œÜ. This is equivalent to Œ£11-comprehension (on the other hand, Œî11-comprehension, defined analogously to Œî01-comprehension, is weaker).  Projective determinacy  Projective determinacy is the assertion that every two-player perfect information game with moves being integers, game length œâ and projective payoff set is determined, that is one of the players has a winning strategy. (The first player wins the game if the play belongs to the payoff set; otherwise, the second player wins.) A set is projective iff (as a predicate) it is expressible by a formula in the language of second-order arithmetic, allowing real numbers as parameters, so projective determinacy is expressible as a schema in the language of Z2. Many natural propositions expressible in the language of second-order arithmetic are independent of Z2 and even ZFC but are provable from projective determinacy. Examples include coanalytic perfect subset property, measurability and the property of Baire for Sigma^1_2 sets, Pi^1_3 uniformization, etc. Over a weak base theory (such as RCA0), projective determinacy implies comprehension and provides an essentially complete theory of second-order arithmetic -- natural statements in the language of Z2 that are independent of Z2 with projective determinacy are hard to find (Woodin 2001). ZFC + {there are n Woodin cardinals: n is a natural number} is conservative over Z2 with projective determinacy, that is a statement in the language of second-order arithmetic is provable in Z2 with projective determinacy iff its translation into the language of set theory is provable in ZFC + {there are n Woodin cardinals: n‚ààN}. Coding mathematics Second-order arithmetic directly formalizes natural numbers and sets of natural numbers. However, it is able to formalize other mathematical objects indirectly via coding techniques, a fact which was first noticed by Weyl (Simpson 2009, p. 16). The integers, rational numbers, and real numbers can all be formalized in the subsystem RCA0, along with complete separable metric spaces and continuous functions between them (Simpson 2009, Chapter II). The research program of Reverse Mathematics uses these formalizations of mathematics in second-order arithmetic to study the set-existence axioms required to prove mathematical theorems (Simpson 2009, p. 32). For example, the intermediate value theorem for functions from the reals to the reals is provable in RCA0 (Simpson 2009, p. 87), while the Bolzano‚ÄìWeierstrass theorem is equivalent to ACA0 over RCA0 (Simpson 2009, p. 34).

The 382-foot vessel entered service in June 1968, and spent most of her career working the Anacortes-San Juan Islands-Sidney B.C. route. History Elwha was built in 1967 in San Diego, CA, as the last of the four Super-class ferries. She made her maiden voyage on June 16, 1968 on the Seattle-Bainbridge Island route, and remained on the route for the first four years of her career before being replaced in fall 1972 by the Walla Walla. For much of the 1970s, the Elwha served as a maintenance relief vessel, filling in for other Super and Jumbo class ferries when and where needed for maintenance cycles. In the 1980s, Elwha was assigned to the Anacortes-San Juan Islands route, where she stayed, with rare exception, until her retirement in 2020. On October 2, 1983, the Elwha ran aground in Grindstone Harbor, near Orcas Island, on a submerged reef while carrying 100 passengers. The collision was initially blamed on the failure of a steering component, but was later found to have been caused by Captain Billy Fittro going off-course to give a visitor a view of her waterfront home. The captain resigned in lieu of being discharged a few days after the incident; ferry chief Nick Tracey was fired the following month, after failing to report Captain Fittro's past negligence. The collision caused $250,000 in damage and forced the ferry out of service for several weeks. The rock was later named \\"Elwha Rock\\" in 1989 after the ferry; the incident also inspired the song \\"Elwha on the Rocks\\", performed by the Island City Jazz Band. In December 1990, a winter storm descended on the Puget Sound region while the Elwha was out of service for routine maintenance. Hurricane-force winds ripped mooring lines and repeatedly slammed the now partially adrift ferry into the concrete pier it was tied up alongside. The accident resulted in millions of dollars in damage and forever altered the ferry. On September 8, 1999, the vessel suffered another serious accident when a software glitch led to it ramming the Orcas Island ferry dock, causing $3.8 million worth of damage to the linkspan and other terminal structures.http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19990908&slug;=2981737http://web.kitsapsun.com/archive/1999/09-09/0064_orcas_islandferry_elwha_rams_do.html This paper describes the planning, design and construction of the $3.8 million replacement facilities. In April 2018, an inspection of the ferry uncovered 12,000 square feet of wasted steel beneath the floor of the Elwha's main passenger cabin. Repairs to the ferry took seven months and cost $25 million dollars. In July 2019, just eight months after her return to service, another routine inspection at Lake Union Drydock uncovered further steel wastage on the ferry's car deck. Repairs were estimated at $12 million, and the ferry was placed in layup while WSF attempted to procure the necessary funding to repair the ferry. Following the passage of I-976 in November 2019, the State Legislature proposed to retire the ferry rather than fund necessary repairs. On April 17, 2020, following seven months of layup, the ferry was towed to Bainbridge Island for de-crewing.

After high school, he enrolled at Swarthmore College, then during the war attended the United States Merchant Marine Academy and served in the merchant marine, returning to Swarthmore in 1946 to earn a B.S. in Engineering. He then completed an MBA at the Harvard Business School in 1951. At the Harvard Business School he worked with venture-capital pioneer Georges Doriot and his colleague Curtis Tarr, who advised Diebold's research project on \\"Making the Automatic Factory a Reality\\". Diebold made automation studies the focus of his assignments for a small Chicago-based consulting firm, then in 1954 he returned to Weehawken to found his own consulting company. By 1960, he numbered more than 30 prominent clients including such notable companies as Bear, Sterns & Company; Boeing Airplane; General Electric, Radio Corporation of America; Westinghouse Electric; and others. Diebold's first book, Automation: The Advent of the Automatic Factory, based on his studies at the Harvard Business School, was published by Van Nostrand in 1952. Owing to independent research and ever-persistent curiosity about the whole field of technology, he originated many of the concepts of data processing and utilization that are accepted today in both automation and management. This book was reissued unchanged on its 30th anniversary as a ‚Äúmanagement classic‚Äù by the American Management Association. He is credited with coining the word automation in its present meaning, and had much to do with introducing it to general usage. Career summary 1952 wrote first book, Automation, originating many concepts basic in today‚Äôs technology. 1954 founded John Diebold & Associates, Inc. consulting in automation and management; later known as The Diebold Group, Inc., the international management consulting firm -, sold to Daimler-Benz in 1991. 1968 founded The Diebold Institute for Public Policy Studies, WorldCat Identities Inc., an operating foundation to apply advanced computer and communications technology to the improvement of the quality of life for a broad segment of the public. In 2005, the year of his death, the Institute led an international cooperative effort to assess the value of information technology in public infrastructures: health care; road transportation; education; communications and public safety. Business career John Diebold & Associates,Inc. soon grew into The Diebold Group, Inc., which played a unique and often central role in the development of the information technology(IT) industry. John Diebold and his company were responsible for the creation of new products and services as well as in the definition of the IT role in the management of businesses and governments. His original wish to play a role in and to contribute to the development of a few of the formative issues that changes the world in which we live was fulfilled. Starting at the founding of the firm, in 1954, Diebold found himself in a unique leadership role of teacher and concepts innovator. He recognized at the outset that computers meant much more than mechanization of existing systems. Instead, they would open hitherto undreamed of opportunities to do new things. Only a few years after the Diebold Group‚Äôs founding, books were being written about John Diebold, his ideas and his firm. Central to all of this was the insight that for computers to achieve their potential they had to be viewed as management and strategy tools. The firm‚Äôs leadership was evident not only in technical innovations but also in the highest level of strategic planning. Working through and with the senior managements of the largest and best run corporations in the world, John Diebold and his firm had an impact that went far beyond their small professional firm. There was a multiplier effect with widespread dissemination through these organizations, their managements, employees and customers. From its founding to its sale in 1991, the firm and John Diebold had a continuing role in the creation and dissemination of new ideas, insights and the introduction of new paradigms. An example was the concepts that talent is capital and its consequences were a key to success in the new world that took shape. From the beginning Diebold contributed to new expectations for the delivery of public services and to what citizens could expect from governments. The firm provided counsel to over 100 cities, most U.S. states, several foreign governments and major corporations, in the U.S. and abroad.

He was known for the genre of opera semiseria.  Life and career  Coccia was born in Naples, and studied in his native city with Pietro Casella, Fedele Fenaroli, and Giovanni Paisiello, who introduced him to King Joseph Bonaparte for whom he became the private musician. He wrote his first opera, Il matrimonio per lettera di cambio, in 1807, but it was a failure; however, the following year, with the help of Paisiello, his second opera, Il poeta fortunato, was well received. He then moved to Venice, where he concentrated on opera semiseria, of which Clotilde from 1815, is perhaps the best example. Accused of imitating other composers, and of producing too many uneven operas in great haste, he was eventually eclipsed by the emerging Rossini, and left for Lisbon, where he remained from 1820 to 1823. He then settled in London in 1824, where he was conductor at His Majesty's Theatre. In 1827, he wrote Maria Stuarda for Giuditta Pasta, which, despite her and the celebrated bass Luigi Lablache being in the cast, was not successful, achieving only four performances. Back in Italy, he concentrated on opera seria, and obtained some success with Caterina di Guisa, in 1833, but by then he had to compete with the likes of Donizetti and Bellini. Carlo Coccia contributed to a portion of Messa per Rossini, specifically the seventh section of II. Sequentia, Lacrimosa Amen. He became Maitre de chapelle in Novare, in 1837, and director of the Music Conservatory of Turin, where he wrote his last opera in 1841. He died in Novare.

History The Cathlamet was built in 1981, as an Issaquah Class ferry, for service on the Mukilteo-Clinton route. In 1991, in order to keep up with growing demand, the Cathlamet, along with many of her sister ships were upgraded from Issaquah class to Issaquah 130 class ferries, by adding additional vehicle areas above the vehicle areas along the outside edge of the ferry. These upgrades had been planned for in the original design of the vessels. The ferry's passenger cabin was updated in the late 1990s, included in the upgrades were the removal of many tables located in the passenger cabin to allow for the bench seats to be spaced closer together in some sections of the ship, and an upgrade of the galley area. Control issue The Cathlamet is infamous in Puget Sound as it has on several occasions struck ferry docks while attempting to dock‚Äîoccasionally referred to by Whidbey Island residents as the Crashlamet. The problem was eventually traced to the computer that controls the pitch of the props, which because of a large amount of unshielded wiring, would short out a couple of signal lines causing the props to re-angle for full propulsion, instead of reversing. The computer system was eventually replaced in the early 2000s, and since then, the Cathlamet has not struck another dock. Status In late June 2014, the new Olympic-class ferry Tokitae replaced the Cathlamet on the Mukilteo/Clinton route. As a result, the Cathlamet was assigned to the Southworth/Vashon/Fauntleroy route to replace the Klahowya. Since being assigned to the North Vashon Triangle route, the Cathlamet has often been used as a relief boat elsewhere showing up on the Seattle-Bremerton route or the Mukilteo-Clinton route in planned and unplanned shortages. In 2011 she sailed between Edmonds and Clinton for a few days due to work being done on the Mukilteo dock.Route information, WSF, WSDOT References External links * Washington State Ferries vessels 1981 ships Ships built in Seattle ","title":"MV Cathlamet"},{"id":"3542492","text":"Transurethral needle ablation (also called TUNA or transurethral radiofrequency ablation) is a technique that uses low energy radio frequency delivered through two needles to ablate excess prostate tissue. A cystoscope/catheter deploys the needles toward the obstructing prostate tissue is inserted into the urethra directly through the penis under local anesthetic before the procedure begins. The energy from the probe heats the abnormal prostate tissue without damaging the urethra. The resulting scar tissue later atrophies, reducing the size of the prostate which in turn reduces the constriction of the urethra. It can be done with a local anesthetic on an outpatient basis.Transurethral needle ablation (TUNA) Why it's done - Mayo Clinic It takes about an hour to perform the procedure.Transurethral needle ablation (TUNA) What you can expect - Mayo Clinic It takes about 30 days for the ablated prostate tissue to resorb.Transurethral needle ablation (TUNA) Results - Mayo Clinic Patients should have an annual rectal prostate exam for their doctor to feel the prostate health with a lubricated gloved finger. Transurethral needle ablation can be used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) Treatments and drugs - Mayo Clinic Some clinical studies have reported that TUNA is safe and effective, improving the urine flow with minimal side effects when compared with other procedures, such as transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and open prostatectomy. However, other studies have reported that the procedure has a high failure rate, with the majority of patients requiring retreatment. Some patients have reported long-term inflammation of their prostate after undergoing the TUNA process. This is known as chronic prostatitis. Judgements in guidelines * The American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines for the treatment of BPH from 2018 stated that \\"TUNA is not recommended for the treatment of LUTS/BPH\\". * The European Association of Urology (EAU) has - as of 2019 - removed TUNA from its guidelines.EAU: Management of Non-neurogenic Male LUTS - Summary of Changes 2019. History The TUNA system was pioneered by Stuart Denzil Edwards. The device was the main product for a startup company called Vidamed. Vidamed was founded in 1992 by Stu D. Edwards along with Ron G. Lax, Hugh Sharky and Ingemar Henry Lundquist, in Menlo Park, California, prior to building an international global corporation headed up by Lyle F. Brotherton.

The design was developed into two four- engined versions: the prototype Singapore II and production Singapore III. The latter became the Royal Air Force's main long-range maritime patrol flying boat of the 1930s and saw service against the Japanese with the Royal New Zealand Air Force during the Second World War. Design and development Rolls-Royce H.10 Buzzard engines and Handley Page auto-slots on the upper wings. The first prototype of the Short Singapore, also known as the Short S.5 (military designation Singapore I), was a metal hull version of the wooden-hulled Short Cromarty. The biplane design included a single fin and rudder, and was originally powered by two Rolls-Royce Condor IIIA engines. Its maiden flight was made from Rochester on 17 August 1926, piloted by Short's Chief Test Pilot John Lankester Parker. The type did not enter production, but was used by Sir Alan Cobham for a survey flight around Africa. Registered G-EBUP, it left Rochester on 17 November 1927 and arrived at the Cape on 30 March 1928, returning to Rochester on 4 June 1928. It was displayed at the Olympia in July 1929. Short Singapore II prototype (N246) early in its development, with four engines, single tail, open cockpit and no ailerons on the lower wings. The Singapore II (manufacturer's designation Short S.12) which followed was a development of the Singapore I with four engines, mounted in tractor/pusher pairs (better known as the push-pull configuration). The single example of this aircraft to be built was first flown on 27 March 1930, also by John Lankester Parker. From the Singapore II came a design with four engines and triple fins. In 1933 the British Air Ministry ordered four flying boats based on the Singapore II for trials with squadrons under specification R.3/33. These would be followed by a further production order to specification R.14/34. These aircraft, the Singapore III (manufacturer's designation Short S.19), had all-metal hulls and fabric-covered metal flying surfaces. They were powered by four Rolls-Royce Kestrel IX mounted between the wings in two tandem push-pull pairs, similar to the Singapore IIs. The crew of six was located in a central cabin and fore, aft, and midships open gun positions (Vickers machine gun or Lewis gun). A long-range fuel tank could be carried externally on the dorsal hull. The first Singapore III flew on 15 June 1934. Although obsolescent by the time the first aircraft entered service with 210 Squadron in January 1935, the type arrived just in time to benefit from the arms race of the late 1930s and 37 were built. Production terminated in June 1937. Operational history Short Singapore III flying boat of 230 Squadron at Alexandria, mid-1930s. 230 Squadron was the first squadron equipped with Singapore IIIs. It was posted to Alexandria in 1935. During 1937 the Singapores of 209 Squadron and 210 Squadron moved from RAF Kalafrana in Malta to Algeria as part of an international effort to prevent gun running during the Spanish Civil War. Replacement of the Singapore with the Short Sunderland was well underway by the outbreak of the Second World War. However, 19 survivors saw limited service in secondary theatres, mainly in a training role. The last RAF unit operating the type was No. 205 Squadron RAF in, appropriately enough, Singapore which relinquished its aircraft in October 1941. Four 205 squadron aircraft found their way to No. 5 Squadron RNZAF in Fiji, for use against German raiders. When Japan attacked in December, the New Zealand aircraft found themselves in the front line. They accounted for a Japanese submarine and conducted several air-sea rescues before being replaced by the Consolidated Catalinas from No. 6 Squadron RNZAF in April 1943. Survivors None are known to have survived.

The parish contained the village of Tushingham and the hamlet of Bell o' th' Hill. According to the 2001 UK census, the total population of the civil parish was 166, rising to 187 at the 2011 Census. The civil parish was abolished in 2015 to form Tushingham-cum-Grindley, Macefen and Bradley. Etymology The Grindley component of the name has been given as Grenleg' Grenlet, Grenlee, Grynleye, Grynesley, and Gryndley sometimes with Broke, broc, or \\"le Brock\\" added to the end since the thirteenth century. It refers to \\"Green wood\\" or \\"clearing\\" next to a brook. The brook later became known as Wych Brook, and it now forms the county boundary between Cheshire and Shropshire at that point. For the origins of Tushingham', two possible explanations have been reported: the first was originally put forward by Eilert Ekwall, who concluded that it referred to \\"the village of Tunsige's people\\", but a more recent suggestion is that a more direct origin from the Middle English \\"tuss(h)e\\" (a tuft of grass or rushes) and \\"ing\\" (a place) with \\"ham\\" yields a meaning of \\"the village in the place where tufts of grasses or rushes grow\\". All the forms of the name that Dodgson records from the Domesday Book onwards begin with \\"Tus-\\" as opposed to \\"Tuns-\\": Tusigeham, Tussinhgham, Tussincham, Tussingeham, and Tussyncam. Governance Tushingham was originally a township in Malpas ancient parish which obtained its separate civil parish status in 1866. As a separate civil parish it has sometimes been known as \\"Tushingham\\" or \\"Tushingham with Grindley\\". It was originally in Broxton Hundred. From 1837 to 1857 it was in Nantwich Poor law union, and from 1857 to 1930 it was in Whitchurch (in Shropshire) poor law union. It was also part of Whitchurch rural sanitary district. Following the local government restructuring at the end of the nineteenth century, when local districts were formed using rural sanitary districts as a guide, Tushingham joined Malpas Rural District and remained there from 1894 to 1936. From 1936 to 1974 it became part of Tarvin Rural District. From 1974 to 2009 it was part of Chester District, and is currently part of the unitary authority of Cheshire West and Chester. St Chad's Chapel, Tushingham is a Grade I listed building, and it is reported that there appears to have been a chapel present there since the fourteenth century.

It is often part of a Christmas or New Year's Eve tradition. The name translates literally as fire-tongs punch. The popularity of the drink was boosted in Germany by the 1944 comedy film '. It is a traditional drink of some German fraternities, who also call it ', as the red color is reminiscent of a cherry liqueur of that name which was manufactured by the distillery (in Gda≈Ñsk).  Procedure  ' is prepared in a bowl, similar to a fondue set, which usually is suspended over a small burner ('). The bowl is filled with heated dry red wine spiced with cinnamon sticks, cloves, star anise and orange peel, similar to mulled wine. The ' was originally a pair of tongs, but nowadays it is common for a purpose-designed metal grate mounted on top of the bowl to hold the ' (sugarloaf), a lump of sugar. The sugar is soaked with rum and set alight, melting and caramelizing.

He is most widely recognized as a hymnodist.Philipp Nicolai, Hymnwriter (justus.anglican.org) Biography Philipp Nicolai was born at Mengeringhausen in Waldeck, Hesse, Germany where his father was a Lutheran priest. His early education include studies at Kassel in Hesse, Hildesheim in Lower Saxony and Dortmund in Westphalia. He studied theology at the University of Erfurt where he was a pupil of Ludwig Helmbold.Philipp Nicolai, 1556-1608 (STEM Publishing) In 1583, he was ordained to the Lutheran ministry and was appointed minister at Herdecke. He was subsequently expelled during the Counter-Reformation. In 1588, he became pastor at Altwildungen in Hesse. He graduated with a Doctorate Degree in Theology from the University of Wittenberg in 1594. In 1596, he became the minister at Unna in Westphalia. In 1601, he was elected chief pastor of St. Katherine's Church (Katharinenkirche) in Hamburg.Philipp Nicolai (Hymns and Carols of Christmas.com)Nicolai, Philipp, D.D.(Hymnary.org) He was the author of two famous hymns: Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme and Wie sch√∂n leuchtet der Morgenstern, sometimes referred to as the King and Queen of Chorales, respectively. These two chorales have inspired many composers, including Johann Sebastian Bach, whose chorale cantatas Wie sch√∂n leuchtet der Morgenstern, BWV 1, and Wachet auf, ruft uns die Stimme, BWV 140, are based on them. Bach's organ transcription of the latter, as published in the Sch√ºbler Chorales, has become world famous.

Most members of this organization were opposition militants, among them many communists. The political activists who were anti-regime used to be investigated and persecuted by PIDE-DGS, the secret police, and according to the gravity of the offence, were usually sent to jail or transferred from one university to another in order to destabilize oppositionist networks and its hierarchical organization. The students responded with demonstrations that culminated on March 24 with a huge student demonstration in Lisbon that was vigorously suppressed by the riot police, which led to hundreds of student injuries. Immediately thereafter, the students began a strike that became a mark in the resistance against the regime. This events were called Academic Crisis (). Marcelo Caetano, distinguished member of the Estado Novo regime and a reputed professor at the University of Lisbon Law School, was the 9th Rector of the University of Lisbon from 1959 on, but the Academic Crisis of 1962 led him to resign after protesting students clashed with riot police in the university's campus. Caetano would be appointed the successor of Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar, the mentor and leader of Estado Novo, in 1968. However, between 1945 and 1974, there were three generations of militants of the radical right at the University of Coimbra and other universities, guided by a revolutionary nationalism partly influenced by the political sub-culture of European neofascism.

She was named for the state of Washington, whose nickname is \\"The Evergreen State\\". When delivered in 1954, the Evergreen State was assigned to the Seattle-Winslow run serving Bainbridge Island. She was reassigned to the San Juan Islands in 1959 where she remained for the majority of her active career for Washington State Ferries. However, the ferry also was used as a relief vessel on the Seattle to Winslow runs in the 1960s. From June 2000 until the retirement of the Steel Electric-class in November 2007 this ferry was used as a relief vessel. The sudden retirement of the Steel Electrics forced the full-time reactivation of the Evergreen State. After reactivation, the Evergreen State was the inter- island service vessel in the San Juan Islands. The Evergreen State left the San Juan Islands for good on June 29, 2014, replaced by her sister ship MV Klahowya, and made her last sailing from Friday Harbor at 2:15 PM and from Lopez Island at 3:05PM. Following that sailing, she sailed to Eagle Harbor on Bainbridge Island. A month after 'retirement', a substantial fleet shortage resulted in the reactivation of the Evergreen State, and for some time thereafter the vessel was intermittently in service - usually on the Fauntleroy-Vashon-Southworth triangle route. Galley Service has not been provided on the Evergreen State since the mid 2000s.

LeMay, the unit was initially known as Detachment \\"A\\" of the 3902nd Air Police Squadron at Offutt Air Force Base. With end of the Cold War in 1992 the Strategic Air Command Elite Guards were formed into the United States Air Force Security Police and later merged in 1997 into the new United States Air Force Security Forces, which exists to this day. Formation The Elite Guard was formed under a signed order from General Curtis LeMay, who was instrumental in modernizing USAF security forces in general and the Strategic Air Command in particular. At the creation of the USAF in 1947, aircraft were normally guarded by security detachments formed from airdrome or air base squadrons. In many cases \\"guard duty\\" was a detail or extra duty and not a full-time job, often given out as punishment to underperforming personnel. Security and weapons training was minimal or nonexistent. During his initial inspection of the SAC strategic bomber fleet at Offutt Air Force Base in 1948, LeMay reported that at one hangar he found an Air Police sentry on duty \\"armed only with a ham sandwich\\".Watson, George M., Secretaries and Chiefs of Staff of the United States Air Force, Washington, D.C.: Air Force History and Museums Program, USAF (2001) p. 132: LeMay raged in a memo that \\"this afternoon I found a man guarding a hangar with a ham sandwich. There will be no more of that.\\" The exigencies of the Korean War imposed additional delays in retraining and reequipping SAC personnel. Despite these problems, LeMay continued to press for improvements in air base and SAC command security, and proposed the formation of an elite Air Police unit in charge of SAC command security at Offutt Air Force Base. In 1956, after the existing SAC Provost Marshal failed to act with sufficient dispatch in forming the new unit, LeMay replaced him, instituting changes in SAC security force structure that resulted in the creation of the Elite Guard in December that year. Mission, organization, and equipment The Elite Guards' mission was threefold. Primarily, Detachment \\"A\\" would be responsible to provide stringent security for SAC Headquarters and its resources. The second portion of their mission was to provide personal protection for the Commander and Vice Commander in chief of the Strategic Air Command and their assembled staff. It also had a third, ceremonial function: acting as an official Strategic Air command representative at military and civic functions requiring military unit participation, with an official drill team. In 1957 General LeMay, General Horace M. Wade (SAC director of personnel), and the Commander for the 3902nd Air Police Squadron personally selected and procured a distinctive uniform.Meyer, Herbert L.

The new uniform included a blue serge wool beret with affixed SAC patch, making the Elite Guard the first Air Force unit authorized (from 1957 onwards) to wear the blue beret.Balcer, Ray (Col.), HQ SAC Elite Guard, April 2005Meilahn, Luther, The Elite Guard, The Klaxon, May 1994, p. 8World's Smartest-Looking Airmen Celebrate A Birthday, Omaha Evening World-Herald, 1 May 1962, p. 16: In May 1962, the Evening World-Herald covered the fifth anniversary celebration of the SAC Elite Guard, complete with a photo of the ceremony clearly showing the Guardsmen in their signature blue wool berets and bone-handled .38 revolvers. The blue beret became the prototype for the headgear later introduced for wear by all Air Force security forces. Through the years, changes in Air Force dress standards necessitated changing the colors and combination of this unique uniform. While the drill team was disbanded in 1969, the guard's primary mission continued with added responsibility for the monthly Changing of the Guard ceremony, funeral details, civic events and formal military functions.

She was named for the state flower of Washington, the rhododendron. She was referred to affectionately as \\"The Rhody\\" by residents of Vashon Island. The Rhododendron was one of two similar Chesapeake Bay ferries that were purchased to become part of the WSF fleet in the 1950s; the other being the now-retired MV Olympic. The Rhododendrons former name was the MV Governor Herbert R. O'Conner. She was originally purchased to be used in the interim while other new ferries were being built. The ferry was retired in January 2012 and was sold in February 2013. It is currently anchored in Fanny Bay, British Columbia, where it serves as a storage and operations platform for nearby oyster farming. Career Rhododendron, circa 1955 Her original use in Washington from 1953 to 1961 was on a route from the Olympic Peninsula to the Kitsap Peninsula, near the current site of the Hood Canal Bridge. Her service there ended when the Hood Canal Bridge was built. At that time, she was reunited with the Olympic and reassigned to the Mukilteo-Clinton route, where she stayed until 1974. In 1975, Washington State Ferries (WSF) acquired the Port Townsend to Keystone route from a private company and reassigned the Rhododendron and the Olympic to this route. In 1983, the Rhododendron was mothballed and stored at the WSF maintenance facility at Eagle Harbor. In 1990, the ferry was completely reconditioned, with its rotted superstructure completely replaced. Due to her construction, she was not permitted to operate more than one mile (1.6 km) from shore. Consequently, in 1993 she was assigned to the Point Defiance to Vashon Island route, a 12-minute trip that is a total of long.

Biography Born in La Paz to wealthy parents, Ballivi√°n had a rather undistinguished military career until his elevation to the post of Commander of the Army in June 1841. He had been a royalist until 1822, but switched sides and joined Lanza's insurrectionist army at the age of 18. His advance in the Bolivian army was unremarkable, although his role was apparently fundamental to the Confederate triumph over Salaverry at the Battle of Socabaya (early 1836). Importantly, he had been a supporter of Santa Cruz in the 1830s. His golden hour came, and he rose dramatically to the occasion, when at aged 37 and as Bolivian Army chief he united the pro-Velasco and pro- Santa Cruz factions under his command to face-off a massive Peruvian invasion led by President Agust√≠n Gamarra. At the Battle of Ingavi (November 1841), Ballivi√°n emerged with a surprising and crushing victory against Gamarra, whom he took prisoner and ordered executed. It was a stunning turn of events, and one that marks the highest point in Bolivian military history. Ingavi preserved Bolivian independence and transformed Ballivi√°n into an overnight hero in a fractured nation badly in need of one. Congress almost immediately proclaimed him Provisional President in Calvo's replacement. Marshall Santa Cruz, from France, acquiesced to his rule and declined to return in the face of the enormous popularity of the new Caudillo. Elected at the ballot box in 1842, Ballivi√°n was a capable leader who enacted important reforms, including a revision of the Constitution. Generally, he followed the organizational and administrative style of Santa Cruz and took great care to keep his supporters happy, thus positioning himself as the Grand Marshall's heir. It was Ballivi√°n who ordered the firsts serious attempt at exploring and mapping the vastly unknown interior of the country and its frontiers. He also created the Department of Beni, and endeavored to establish Bolivian control over the sea- fronting Department of Litoral. Under his administration, the guano riches of that frontier region were exploited for the first time in earnest. However, he failed to create a credible deterrent military presence in the area, since he tended to concentrate loyal troops in the important centers of population in order to quell rebellions, especially after 1845. Ballivi√°n had the misfortune of experiencing the defection, and subsequent dogged personal opposition, of the charismatic General Manuel Belzu, once head of the Army but now wounded by the alleged or perceived pursuit of his‚ÄîBelzu's -- wife by the President. Smarting, Belzu withdrew to the countryside with his followers in 1845 and, swearing revenge, all but declared war on Ballivi√°n, igniting a massive confrontation that polarized Bolivian society. Little by little, the populist Belzu's legend grew, while Ballivi√°n's became more tarnished, especially when the latter was forced to resort to increasingly authoritarian measures to keep control. Eventually, civil war-like conditions erupted, forcing the embattled Hero of Ingavi to flee shortly before Christmas of 1847. He left in his place General Eusebio Guilarte, head of the Council of State and second in line to the presidency in accordance to the new Constitution Ballivi√°n himself had promulgated. Following exile in Chile, he moved to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where he remained the rest of his days. He died young (around age 47) in 1852 in Rio de Janeiro, but is revered to this day as one of Bolivia's greatest Presidents and foremost military leaders. His remains were repatriated and he was given a lavish state funeral. Jos√© Ballivi√°n's son, Adolfo Ballivi√°n, followed in his father's footsteps and became Constitutional President of Bolivia in 1873. Historical perspective Sometimes historians excoriate president Ballivi√°n for having squandered a golden opportunity, after the Battle of Ingavi, to impose upon Peru the cession of Arica (often referred to as \\"Bolivia's natural port\\"), perhaps in exchange for Bolivian territory bordering on Chile further South. But clearly his thinking had been that a magnanimous peace would be wiser and provide Bolivia with a trustworthy ally and permanent friend on her Western flank, as indeed happened.

Along with Joan Carlile (c. 1606 ‚Äì 1679) and Susan Penelope Rosse (c. 1655 ‚Äì 1700), she was part of a small band of female professional artists working in London. Beale became the main financial provider for her family through her professional work ‚Äì a career she maintained from 1670/71 to the 1690s. Beale was also a writer, whose prose Discourse on Friendship of 1666 presents scholarly, uniquely female take on the subject.

She was baptised on 26 March by her father John Cradock in All Saints Church in the village. Her mother was Dorothy; her maiden name is illegible on her marriage record to John Cradock. Aside from being a rector, John Cradock was also an amateur painter, who may have taught Mary how to paint. It was common for fathers to teach their daughters how to paint at the time . Growing up in Barrow, Mary lived close to Bury St Edmunds. A group of painters worked in Bury St Edmunds, including Peter Lely and Matthew Snelling, whom Mary may have met in her youth. On 23 August 1643, John and Dorothy Cradock gave birth to a son named John. Dorothy died not long after the birth. During the Civil War, John Cradock appointed Walter Cradock, a distant cousin of his, as guardian of his children John and Mary. Mary Cradock met Charles Beale (1632-1705), a cloth merchant who was also an amateur painter, during a visit to the Heighams of Wickhambrook, who were related to the Yelverton and Beale families. Charles Beale wrote her a passionate love letter and poem on 25 July of an unknown year. Mary Cradock married Charles Beale on 8 March 1652 at the age of eighteen. Her father, John Cradock, was gravely ill at the time and died a few days after Mary's marriage. The couple moved to Walton-on-Thames at some point afterward. Charles Beale was a Civil Service Clerk at the time, but eventually became Mary's studio manager once she became a professional painter. At some point, Charles was working for the Board of Green Cloth where he mixed colour pigments. Circa 1660‚Äì64 the family moved to Albrook, (now Allbrook), Otterbourne, Hampshire, to escape the plague.Bonhams Portrait of Charles Beale (1632‚Äì1705). Url visited on 20 June 2018 Throughout their marriage, Mary and Charles worked together as equals and as business partners, which was not often seen at the time. On 18 October 1654 Charles and Mary's first son, Bartholomew, was buried. Little else is known about their first son. Their second son was baptised on 14 February 1655/6 and also named Bartholomew. Their third son Charles was born in 1660. Her husband, the painter Charles Beale the Elder, by Mary Beale  A professional businesswoman  The most common way to learn how to paint at the time was to copy great works and masterpieces that were accessible. Mary Beale preferred to paint in oil and water colours. Whenever she did a drawing, she would draw in crayon. Peter Lely, who succeeded Anthony van Dyck as the court painter, took a great interest in Mary's progress as an artist, especially since she would practice painting by imitating some of his work. Mary Beale started working by painting favours for people she knew in exchange for small gifts or favors. Charles Beale kept close record of everything Mary did as an artist. He would take notes on how she painted, what business transactions took place, who came to visit, and what praise she would receive. Charles wrote thirty notebooks' worth of observations over the years, calling Mary \\"my dearest heart\\". She became a semi-professional portrait painter in the 1650s and 1660s, working from her home, first in Covent Garden and later in Fleet Street in London. When living in Convent Garden, Beale was a near neighbor to artist Joan Carlile. = Training = Mary received no formal training from an academy, had no connection to an artist guild, and no royal or courtly patronage. She received a humanist education from her father, who is most likely the one who taught Mary how to draw and paint. During her childhood in Suffolk Mary's father was friendly with contemporary British artists such as Sir Nathaniel Bacon, Robert Walker, and Sir Peter Lely, leading to both Robert Walker and Peter Lely being \\"the most likely drawing masters to the young Mary\\". The exact time of Mary's introduction to Lely is debated and one theory has the two meeting prior to her marriage to Charles, when she was living in Suffolk. The other theory has the pair meeting in either 1655 or 1656 when Mary and Charles moved to Convent Garden in London and became Lely's neighbour. In detailed documents kept by Charles Beale of his wife's practice it states that Lely would visit the Beale home occasionally to observe Mary paint and praise her work. Their friendship led to Lely loaning Beale and her family some of his old master paintings for them to copy from. The Beale's commissioned many portraits from Lely of themselves and their friends. It is noted by contemporary George Vertue that portraits of Mary and her family were present at their home at Hind Court in 1661. = Writings = In 1663 Mary Beale wrote Observations, an instruction on painting apricots using oils. The work marks one of the earliest writings on oil painting instruction to come out of England by an artist of either gender. It was never released on its own in print, however scholars believe that manuscripts of the work were distributed. The work was found in a notebook collecting writings by Charles Beale but was written entirely by Mary, which Helen Draper states is \\"a unique example of husband-and-wife collaboration in the history of technical literature on painting.\\" Mary Beale also wrote a manuscript called Discourse on Friendship in 1666 and four poems in 1667. = The business of painting = The key for a female to become a successful professional painter was to earn a good reputation. Mary's father, an amateur artist, funded her general education may have including courses in painting and drawing. It could be easy to misconstrue strangers entering a woman's home for a business transaction as something that would portray the woman in an impure light. Once Mary did start painting for money in the 1670s, she carefully picked whom she would paint, and used the praise of her circle of friends to build a good reputation as a painter. Some of these people included Queen Henrietta Maria and John Tillotson, a clergyman from St James' Church, a close friend of Mary Beale who eventually became the Archbishop of Canterbury. It may be due to Mary's father, John, who was a rector, or her close connection to Tillotson that kept the clergymen of St James' as consistent customers.{original research} Mary's connection to Tillotson as well as her strong Puritan marriage to Charles worked in her favour in building up her good reputation. Mary Beale typically charged five pounds for a painting of a head and ten pounds for half of a body for oil paintings. She made about two hundred pounds a year and gave ten per cent of her earnings to charity. This income was enough to support her family, and she did so. Needless to say, it is truly remarkable that Mary Beale was responsible for being the breadwinner of the family. By 1681 Mary's commissions were beginning to diminish. In 1681, Mary Beale took on two students, Keaty Trioche and Mr. More, who worked with her in the studio. In 1691, Sarah Curtis from Yorkshire became another student of Mary's. Sarah had similar behaviours and dispositions as Mary. Mary Beale died on 8 October 1699. Her death was mistaken for the death of Mary Beadle, whose recorded death is on 28 December 1697. Not much is known about her death besides that she died in a house on Pall Mall and was buried under the communion table of St James's Church, Piccadilly on 8 October 1699. Her tomb was destroyed by enemy bombs during the Second World War. A memorial to her lies within the church.  Prominent Sitters  Distinguished Anglican Clergyman Dr. John Tillotson (1630‚Äì1694) was a frequent sitter for Mrs. Beale. She painted him a total of five times in 1664,1672,1677, 1681, and 1687. Dr. Tillotson was related to the Cromwell family because he married the niece of Oliver Cromwell, Elizabeth in 1664. Elizabeth was a close friend of Mary's and was one of the individuals who received her writing \\"The Discourse on Friendship\\". the Beale's would commission a portrait of Dr. Tillotson for themselves by Sir Peter Lely in 1672. Royalist Colonel Giles Strangways (1615‚Äì1675) was an admirer of Mary Beale's paintings and another important patron. Strangways fought for King Charles I during the English civil war and also had a hand in the secret escape of Charles II into exile in 1651, as well as his reinstatement in 1660. Mary was commissioned by Strangways to paint his portrait along with ones of his wife, his son and his daughter during the 1670s. Nobleman Henry Cavendish (1630‚Äì1691) was another important sitter for Mary Beale. He became the 2nd Duke of Newcastle in 1676 and him and is Duchess Frances n√©e Pierrepont were frequent patrons of Mary who commissioned their portraits soon after in 1677. The Duke and Duchess were introduced to Mary's work through Frances' father, the Hon. William Pierrepont (1607‚Äì1678) who's portrait was also painted by Mary around 1670. William Pierrepont was supportive of Oliver Cromwell during the English Civil War and remained an opponent to the Restoration of the Stuart Monarchy.A memorial to Mary Beale in St James's Church, Piccadilly. Her son Bartholomew Beale (1656‚Äì1709), by Sir Peter Lely, circa 1670  The Beale children  Charles and Bartholomew Beale helped with work in the studio in their youth, where they painted draperies and sculpted ovals; these ovals were a critical piece in Mary Beale's head portraits. Young Charles Beale, the third son and named after his father, showed great talent in painting and went to study miniature painting on 5 March 1677. He enjoyed painting miniature sculptures from 1679 to 1688, when his eyesight started to fail him. From then on, he worked on full scale portraits. Bartholomew Beale, the second son, started with painting but instead turned to medicine. In 1680, he studied at Clare Hall, Cambridge and graduated MB in 1682. Bartholomew set up his medical practice on a small property in Coventry, which his father owned.  Artworks  * See Chronological list of paintings by Mary Beale = Style = The style that Mary Beale painted in was Baroque. Baroque art is a style of sculpture, painting, music, and architecture that was prominent in Europe from the early 17th century until the mid 18th. Baroque art is characterized by use of light and shadow, depictions of movement, as well as use of rich color, all to elicit a sense of grandeur and awe. Baroque portraiture in particular is known for its rich colors, light contrasts, and attention to fabric detail. Mary Beale's paintings are often described as \\"vigorous\\" and \\"masculine\\". (It was common to praise a woman for her work by calling her \\"masculine\\".) The colour is seen as pure, sweet, natural, clear and fresh, although some critics see her colouring as \\"heavy and stiff\\". Due to copying Italian masterpieces as practice, Mary Beale is said to have acquired \\"an Italian air and style\\". Not too many could compete with her \\"colour, strength, force, or life\\". Sir Peter Lely admired Beale's work, saying she \\"worked with a wonderful body of colour, and was exceedingly industrious.\\" Others criticise her work as weak in expression and finish with disagreeable colours and poorly rendered hands. It is sometimes described as \\"scratchy\\" with a \\"limited colour palette\\" and too closely imitates the work of Lely. In the decades after her death, art historian George Vertue praised her work by saying \\"Mrs. Mary Beale painted in oil very well\\" and \\"work'd with a wonderfull body of colors\\". Some of her work can be found on display in the Geffrye Museum in London, though the largest public collection can be found at Moyse's Hall museum, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. Beale was the subject of a solo exhibition at the Geffrye Museum in 1975, which transferred to the Towner Art Gallery in Eastbourne the following year.Exhibition catalogue The Excellent Mrs Beale  Notes   Bibliography  * Tabitha Barber, Mary Beale (1632/3-1699): portrait of a seventeenth- century painter, her family and her studio, [exhibition catalogue, 21 September 1999 to 30 January 2000, Geffrye Museum, London], (London: Geffrye Museum Trust, 1999). * Ellen C.

In 2006, one additional union council formed with the name of Alizai, bringing the total union councils to 13. Demography In 2005 the population of Mastung district was estimated to be over 180,349. The major religion is Islam, which accounts for % of the total population. The text of the 1998 census report suggests that the main language in the district is Dehwari Farsi, Brahui, but the actual figures of the census (which did not provide a separate option for Brahui) indicate that % of the population declared their mother tongue to be Balochi. There is also a sizeable minority of Pashto speakers (%).

Post primary access is a major issue in the district with 79% schools being at primary level. Compare this with high schools which constitute only 8% of government schools in the district. This is also reflected in the enrolment figures for 2016‚Äì17 with 15,842 students enrolled in class 1 to 5 and only 642 students enrolled in class 9 and 10. Gender disparity is another issue in the district. Only 36% schools in the district are girls‚Äô schools. Access to education for girls is a major issue in the district and is also reflected in the low literacy rates for females. Moreover, the schools in the district lack basic facilities. According to Alif Ailaan district education rankings 2017, the district is ranked at number 107 out of the 155 districts of Pakistan for primary school infrastructure. At the middle school level, it is ranked at number 115 out of the 155 districts. These rankings take into account the basic facilities available in schools including drinking water, working toilet, availability of electricity, existence of a boundary wall and general building condition. 4 out of 5 schools do not have electricity in them.

A butcher, a pig and a psychedelic gaggle of gals from 1969. With more and more stores offering fancy dress for hire, the streets of Headingley have become more and more Surreal. The Otley Run is a pub crawl in Leeds, West Yorkshire. The route shares much in common with the Headingley Mile (a similar crawl in LS6) but usually incorporating more pubs on the A660 road, typically those towards Leeds City Centre. The Otley Run is seen as a rite of passage for students visiting or studying at LeedsLeeds RAG ¬ª Blog Archive ¬ª Halloween Otley Run Challenge and is a popular social gathering for student clubs and societies from The University of Leeds, Leeds College of Music, Leeds Arts University, Leeds Trinity University, Leeds Beckett University and The University of Bradford Hockey Club. It also a common activity for birthdays and other celebrations among graduates and city residents. Participants often wear fancy dressBBC - Leeds - Students - A piece of student culturehttp://blog.otleyrunfancydress.co.uk/2013/03/31/doing-the-otley-run-in- fancy-dress/ and coordinate their costumes to a particular theme. It is also traditional for students of Leeds Grammar School, Lawnswood School, Roundhay School, Notre Dame Sixth Form College, Guiseley School, Horsforth School, St Mary‚Äôs School and Abbey Grange Academy Sixth Form to do the Otley Run on their last day, as well as students from Otley's Prince Henry's Grammar School Sixth Form, with their run usually including various pubs and bars around Otley as well as the Headingley Mile venues. History of the route Early incarnations of the Otley Run route covered considerably more of the Otley Road and followed it closely. Influences on the choice of route over time include: * The original \\"Otley run\\", in which pubs were opened for farmers' business use under provisions of the Licensing Act 1964. This allowed Otley pubs opening hours preferable to Leeds' on market days, set out in relevant byelaws as on Monday and Friday * Tetley's incredible popularity and copious Yorkshire pubs, including The Oak Inn (Original Oak) and a brewhouse at The Woodman (Woodies) * Students being able to include bars on University of Leeds and LMU union premises (which for a time were members' clubs and required membership cards to enter), on-site at residences such as Bodington Hall, and those at or near sports facilities (eg. The Stables at Weetwood Hall) * Former Bodington residents including main road pubs around Adel/Weetwood/Far Headingley, and similarly for venues near other popular residences over time * Changes in opening hours laws encouraging new bars to open in the \\"Headingley Mile\\" section and enhancing the appeal of those at the city centre end of the main road * Commercial interest from discount card providers looking to get their associated venues \\"on the route\\", from hen/stag party planners and fancy dress shops advising customers on which pubs to visit, and from viral marketing campaigns involving Twitter feeds and web sites publishing route maps claiming to be official * Competition over claims to be the end point between various bars and clubs beyond Woodhouse Lane The tradition of starting an Otley Run early predates The Licensing Act 1988's repeal of the law requiring pubs to close in the afternoon. Prior to this, Otley's status as a thriving market town having given it exemption from this law made it a popular start point. A journey covering the Tetley pubs lining the main road would therefore pass or approach such sites as the University playing fields at Bodington Hall/Weetwood Pavilion, as well as Carnegie stadium, Castle Grove Masonic Lodge, Associated Tower Cinemas' famous Lounge and Cottage Road cinemas, the site of the Skyrack wapentake Shire Oak (now commemorated with a blue plaque at the Original Oak), Woodhouse Ridge, the site of Leeds Girls' High School, and Woodhouse Moor/Hyde Park. For students, an Otley Road pub crawl might start or end on University Union premises and include the Bodington Hall on-site bar. As city centre pubs began to adopt the new longer opening hours, the northern end point of the popular route crept into Adel, Lawnswood, and Weetwood in keeping with the location of The Stables (at University-owned Weetwood Hall) and proximity of student residences such as Devonshire Hall, Bodington Hall, and Oxley. Starting around the ring road junction was also popular with student sports societies thanks to Bodington's playing fields and to Sports Park Weetwood in particular, and Woodhouse Lane/Albion Street and city centre clubs offered end points for south-bound runs should drinkers not qualify as members or guests as required for access to student union bars at the time. With the eventual closure closure of the halls at Weetwood, Cavendish, Tetley, and Bodington in favour of alternatives in and around city centre, the modern route choice ceased inclusion of central Weetwood and beyond, taking inspiration from the crawl associated with the Headingley Mile (the section of the A660 from the Hyde Park Hotel to the New Inn) which usually headed south from Woodies' Ale House; Woodies' (originally The Woodman, and technically in Far Headingley) was also conveniently close to the boundary served by cheap \\"Green Zone\\" bus tickets. Newly opened pubs such as the converted Lounge cinema (Headingley) and Dry Dock (Woodhouse) were adopted to fill the gaps on the list, and many city centre bars and club nights began to jostle for position as the official end point. Prior to the introduction of a strong student following the regulars at The Woodman would go to the town of Otley on market day. Market day was traditionally a Monday and the pubs were open all day. This was unheard of elsewhere due to the licensing laws where most bars closed at 3pm and opened round 5.30pm. The Woodman was a popular pub for Leeds Supporters, bikers and students from Carnegie College. The visits to Otley would be usually the hardened drinkers and guests who would be celebrating a birthday, wedding, birth of a child, new job or other. The all day session was then told by stories to the regulars on a Saturday in The Woodman. This is where the term \\"the Otley Run\\" came from. The hardened drinkers would also go from The Woodman down Otley Road calling at the Tetley pubs all the way into town. The good relationships between students and regulars of Headingley pubs emerged into a cult like following for the beer crawls. The Leeds supporters in The Woodman would on occasions (end of season / Manchester derby's) wear fancy dress. This transferred to the beer crawls and hence today as we know the fancy dress theme which is unique every weekend along the route. The idea that followers of the modern run should start early and visit as many venues as possible rather than cover a greater area has caused upset with locals and prompted some pubs to turn away visitors in fancy dress and in obvious large groups.

It became a separate district in 1992, prior to which it was a tehsil within Loralai District.  History  After the first phase of the Afghan war of 1878-79 AD, the British took control of the northern areas of Balochistan under the Treaty of Gandamak. During 1879-84 AD, efforts were made to extend the British influence over the Khetrans and Musakhels of the, now Musakhel, territory. The Musakhels took part in outrages committed by the Kakars under Shah Jahan in 1884, but surrendered to the British government on the conclusion of the expedition in the same year. On 1 November 1887, the whole area was declared part of British India. Zhob agency was formed in 1890 and Musakhel territory was annexed to it. Musakhel was made a tehsil in 1892 and was transferred to Loralai district in October 1903. In 1905, the Musakhel tehsil comprised 61 villages and the total population, according to 1901 census, was 15,537 (8,374 males and 7,163 females). The principal tribes represented were: Isot (1,941); Jafar (1,026); Panri (10,144) including the Musakhel clan (9,748) the principal divisions of which were the Belkhel (7,662) and Laharzai (2,086); and Syed (271). The chief language spoken was Pushto. Musakhel remained a tehsil of Loralai district till 1 January 1992 when it was notified as a district as a result of splitting Loralai district into 3 districts, Loralai, Musakhel, and Barkhan. Although Musakhel is an old human settlement there is no remarkable archaeological site.There are 3 tehsils of Musakhel...Kingri, Darug and Musakhel bazar which is also the district headquarter.  Geography  District Musakhel is located in north- eastern border of Balochistan and bordering to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Dera Ghazi Khan, Punjab. The district comprises 5728km¬≤. The headquarters of the district is Musa Khel. = Climate = The climate of Musakhel, located 1,200‚Äì2,400 metres above sea level, is semi-arid. It can be placed in the \\"warm summer and mild winter\\" temperature region. The summer is hot with mean temperatures ranging from 21¬∞C to 32¬∞C. June is the hottest month when maximum temperature does exceed 32¬∞C and occasionally rises above 38¬∞C. Summer is longer than winter and lasts for about 7 months (April‚ÄìOctober). In winter the temperature drops below 21¬∞C, but in the coolest month (January) the mean monthly temperature drops below 10¬∞C. The mercury may touch the freezing point during cold spells.Some areas of Musakhel also receives snowfall in winter like Kingri and Rarasham.  Administrative divisions  The district of Musakhel is divided into four tehsils: * Darug * Kingri * Musakhel * Toisar  Demography  The population in 1998 was 134,060, % of which was urban. The main tribes of the district are the Musakhels. According to the 1988 census, the major first languages\\"Mother tongue\\": defined as the language of communication between parents and children, and recorded of each individual. spoken were Pashto (%) and Balochi (%). According to the United Nations, in 1981 over 85% of households spoke Pashto, 7.2% spoke Jafferki and 7.8% spoke Balochi. Seraiki is also spoken in the region as well  Education  District Musakhel is ranked at the 81st position in the education score index of the Pakistan District Education Rankings 2017 published by Alif Ailaan. The education score is composed of the learning score, retention score and gender parity score. Retention is one of the biggest concerns in this district, with the relevant score being only 43.79 out of a potential 100. While, gender parity and learning scores lying a little above average. There has been only a slight improvement in the provision of post primary school infrastructure, with government primary schools still accounting for over 80% of the total number of government schools in the province, with a score of 27.87. In percentage terms, the allocations for education in Baluchistan have seen the highest growth compared to all other provinces during the 2013‚Äì2018 tenure, including district Musakhel.

Originally built in 1967 to replace an earlier ferry, it was used on the Point Defiance‚ÄìTahlequah route during its early years. Upon its retirement in 2016, it was the smallest ferry in the fleet, with a capacity of 34 cars and 200 passengers, and a length of . History The Hiyu was originally built in 1967 by Gunderson Brothers in Portland, Oregon to replace the aging wooden ferry on the Point Defiance‚ÄìTahlequah ferry, which had a capacity of 32 cars at the time and a clearance of on her car deck. The Hiyu was slightly bigger and faster than her predecessor, but most importantly, she had a higher clearance in her two center lanes, allowing trucks to reach Vashon Island without having to drive to Fauntleroy. The Hiyu worked the short route between Vashon Island and Tacoma until the late-1980s. By then, she could no longer handle the increased traffic on the route and was replaced with the 55-car . Washington State Ferries reassigned her to the San Juan Islands where she served as the inter-island boat, serving San Juan Island, Orcas Island, Shaw Island and Lopez Island. By the late-1990s, the Hiyus small size became an issue once again on the San Juan inter-island route, and she was replaced by a larger vessel, the . She was mothballed for over 10 years at Washington State Ferries' maintenance facility in Eagle Harbor. During that period, she was mainly used as a WSF training vessel. She was also used for filming some movies and television commercials, including a commercial for the Seattle Seahawks football team in 1999. Occasionally, she was contracted out for service on the Steilacoom-Anderson Island ferry route when the needed emergency repairs. During this time, WSF considered selling this ferry. The Washington State Department of Corrections was interested in using her for service to their prison on McNeil Island. There were also plans to sell her to Whatcom County for them to use at Lummi Island or for ferry service between Blaine and Point Roberts. In the end, nothing came of the plans to sell the Hiyu. In June 2007, Washington State Ferries put the Hiyu back in service once again between Point Defiance and Tahlequah when the encountered rudder problems. At the time, Hiyu was the only other ferry available to cover for the Rhody. On November 20, 2007, the four Steel Electric-class ferries were removed from service, leaving Hiyu as the only back-up ferry in the fleet. She continued to serve as a back-up ferry, but couldn't provide enough capacity on any of WSF's routes. She also couldn't be made ADA-accessible. In the governor's proposed budget for 2009, the Hiyu was slated to be permanently assigned to the Point Defiance-Tahlequah route to allow for the Rhododendrons retirement. The legislature did not approve this proposal, so the Rhododendron remained in service until 2012 when the 64-car replaced her. The Hiyu proved useful in December 2012 when three ferries, the Walla Walla, Sealth and Klahowya, were taken out of service and the Hiyu was put on the Vashon- Southworth-Fauntleroy run for six days while repairs were made. On November 25, 2013, the local TV station KING 5 reported that, since January 2012, WSF had spent $710,000 keeping engineers on the boat almost every day, but that it was only in service for eight days during that time. The head of WSF, David Moseley, said that the expense was minimal, amounting to less than one percent of the total cost of labor for engineers. At the time, WSF was building two new 144-car Olympic-class ferries which entered service in 2014 and 2015. One of them was to allow WSF to have a more adequate backup ferry. After a year without service, the Hiyu was put back to work in January 2014 on the San Juan Interisland route to cover for the Evergreen State, which had broken down. The Hiyu was in service during two days until the regular ferry was repaired.David Moseley's Jan 24, 2014 weekly update , wsdot.wa.gov On July 23, 2015, the Hiyu was put in service for the last time, sailing on the Fauntleroy-Vashon- Southworth route, which was otherwise running on a 2-boat schedule due to vessel moves elsewhere in the WSF system, which were made to accommodate emergency repairs to the MV Puyallup and MV Elwha while maintaining reasonable service throughout the WSF system. On May 17, 2016, WSDOT announced that the Hiyu had been officially retired and that it would soon be put up for sale. In October 2016 the State of Washington Surplus Operations ran an auction for Hiyu, ending with no sale.http://www.publicsurplus.com/sms/auction/view?auc=1699398 A second auction for the vessel later in the year also failed to find a buyer, but in February 2017 the state reached an agreement to sell Hiyu to a private buyer who would use her as a floating entertainment venue on Lake Union.

Gold played eight seasons of professional football as a linebacker in the National Football League (NFL) for the Denver Broncos from 2000 to 2003 and 2004 to 2007 and for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2004. He appeared in 115 NFL games, 80 as a starter, registered 422 tackles, and was selected to play in the 2002 Pro Bowl. Gold played college football as a linebacker for the University of Michigan from 1996 to 1999 and was a member of the undefeated 1997 Michigan Wolverines football team that was ranked #1 in the final AP Poll. He was selected as a first-team linebacker on both the 1998 and 1999 All-Big Ten teams. Early years In August 1978, Gold was born at University Hospital in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where his parents were both students at the University of Michigan. He attended middle school in Ann Arbor, Michigan. In middle school, he developed a passion for the arts, while enjoying time with his friends. Gold earned All-West Wayne Offensive MVP and was selected to the Detroit News All-State Dream Team after his senior campaign. University of Michigan Gold enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1996 and played college football for head coach Lloyd Carr's Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1996 to 1999. As a sophomore, Gold started one game at inside linebacker for the undefeated 1997 Michigan Wolverines football team that outscored opponents 322‚Äì144, won the Big Ten Conference championship, defeated Washington State in the 1998 Rose Bowl, and was ranked #1 in the final AP Poll.

Gold led the 1999 team with 95 tackles, including 71 solo tackles, and was selected by the conference coaches as a first-team linebacker on the 1999 All-Big Ten Conference football team. He won the 1999 Roger Zatkoff Award as the team's top linebacker. Professional football Gold was selected by the Denver Broncos in the second round (40th overall pick) of the 2000 NFL Draft. He appeared in all 32 regular season games for the Broncos in 2000 and 2001, but was not a starter. In 2002, Gold started all 16 games at weakside linebacker and totaled 85 tackles and 6.5 quarterback sacks. Gold began the 2003 season on a strong note with 10 tackles and his first career interception return for a touchdown in the opening game against the Cincinnati Bengals. However, he sustained an anterior cruciate ligament injury in his right leg on a special teams play during the sixth game of the 2003 season against the Pittsburgh Steelers. He missed the remainder of the season and underwent surgery to repair the injury. In April 2004, the Broncos stopped contract negotiations with Gold after drafting D. J. Williams in the first round of the 2004 NFL Draft. Four days later, Gold signed as a free agent with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The contract was for seven years and $38 million with a $1.3 million signing bonus, though the contract only guaranteed the signing bonus and gave the team the option to release him after the 2004 season. Gold appeared in all 16 games for the Buccaneers, including 13 as the team's starting strongside linebacker. In early March 2005, the Buccaneers cut Gold to the free agent market rather than pay him a reported $9.6 million option bonus.

Alberto Franchetti (18 September 1860 ‚Äì 4 August 1942) was an Italian opera composer. Biography Alberto Franchetti was born in Turin, a Jewish noblemanSon of barone Raimondo Franchetti; his mother was a Vienna Rothschild (Alan Mallach, The autumn of Italian opera from verismo to modernism, 1890-1915 2007:58); cf. Samuele Schaerf, I cognomi degli ebrei d'Italia con un appendice su le famiglie nobili ebree, s.v. Franchetti. of independent means. He studied first in Venice, then at the Munich Conservatory under Josef Rheinberger, and finally in Dresden under Felix Draeseke. His first major success occurred in 1888 with his opera Asrael. His operatic style combined Wagnerianism and the traits of Meyerbeer with Italian verismo. During his life, critics sometimes referred to him as the \\"Meyerbeer of modern Italy.\\" The words of music critic G. B. Nappi sum up Franchetti's primary talents: \\"His character is perhaps unsuitable for passionate dramas, but rather for those subjects, where the fantastic, romantic and epic are required in the symphonic texture and large choral pictures. In this regard Alberto Franchetti knows that he has no rival\\" (from \\"Orfeo\\" 6.3, 1915). Grove considers Cristoforo Colombo (1892) Franchetti's best work. However, his most popular opera was Germania (1902; libretto by Luigi Illica). It clung to the general operatic repertoire until the First World War; it was performed worldwide, and Arturo Toscanini (who conducted the work at La Scala) and Enrico Caruso held it high regard. Caruso included a few of the arias in his very first commercial recording session in 1902 and repeated one piece the following year for the Zonophone company, and two pieces with orchestra in 1910 when he appeared in a revival of the work in New York. But by the war, Germania had lapsed into obscurity. Mosco Carner notes that Illica's libretto of Tosca, or at least the sketch for a libretto, was first offered to Franchetti, who, too busy with other projects at the time, passed it on to his friend Puccini. Other authors have stated that Franchetti was working on the opera but Puccini asked Ricordi to let him have it and that Franchetti was persuaded that the violence in the story made it unsuitable for an opera. Another version is that Franchetti waived his rights to the opera because he felt that Puccini would make a better job of it - this is believed to have been stated by the Franchetti family. Of Franchetti's last opera Glauco only the third act finale (sung by soprano) No piange ancora with its haunting melody, seems to have survived. Among the reasons for Franchetti's descent into obscurity is the fact that, after the promulgation of the Fascist Racial Laws of 1938, which largely disenfranchised Italy's Jewish population, Franchetti's works were banned from performance. This was despite a plea for tolerance on his behalf from Pietro Mascagni to Benito Mussolini, which was rejected, just before Franchetti's death. Recent revivals and recordings of Cristoforo Colombo and Germania (Berlin Oper 2006/7) show his work to be of genuine quality with a fine ability in orchestration and use of the chorus, symphonic in style. These traits, along with an unfortunate tendency for two- dimensional characters, were recognised early. He also wrote a Symphony in E minor. He was the director of the Florence College of Music from 1926 to 1928: it was the only musical post he ever held. He died in Viareggio in 1942, aged 81. Franchetti's main residence the substantial Villa Franchetti - (Nardi) in Florence was accepted as a \\"Historical Residence of Italy\\" in 1991 and in 2009 it became a hotel as well as a home, preserving much of its historical fabric. The villa, with its numerous outbuildings, was rescued from near dereliction by its current owner Gustavo Nardi, who writes of the villa's connections with Franchetti(http://www.villanardifirenze.com/History) His son Arnold Franchetti (1911‚Äì1993) became a composer after emigrating to the United States in 1949. Before coming to the US, he studied physics at the University of Florence, music at the Salzburg Mozarteum, and then moved to Munich where he studied composition and orchestration with Richard Strauss for three years.

With a career spanning more than twenty-five years, Mullich worked not only for some of the first video game publishers, but went on to work for some of the biggest game companies of today. Career Mullich's work in video games began at the birth of the video game industry in 1978 when his COBOL professor at California State University, Northridge hired him to work as a clerk and programmer at Rainbow Computing, one of the first computer stores to open in the Los Angeles area. Sherwin Steffin, who was a frequent customer at the store, recruited Mullich to develop games for his new start-up game publishing company, Edu-Ware Services. Upon graduating in 1980 with a degree in computer science, Mullich joined Edu-Ware as a full-time employee, and as his first assignment created the ground-breaking adventure game The Prisoner. Mullich went on to design most the Edu-Ware's innovative line of adventure games and role-playing video games, and programmed the company's EWS3 graphics engine as well as many of its educational programs. As the company grew, he was promoted to Vice President of Software Development and managed other programmers coding both entertainment and educational products designed by him and other members of the design staff. After five years, Mullich and several other key Edu-Ware employees left to form their own company, Electric Transit, which specialized in first person 3D games and became Electronic Arts‚Äô first affiliated label publisher. In 1987, Mullich joined Walt Disney Computer Software, where he produced video games based upon Disney characters, films, and television shows with external developers and licensees. Four years later he joined developer Interactive Support Group to create driving and action games for fifth generation console systems CD-I and 3DO. Mullich next went on to become development director at game publisher Cyberdreams, where he produced award- winning games in collaboration with notables such as science fiction author Harlan Ellison, fantasy artist H.R. Giger and horror director Wes Craven. While participating in a game design panel at the Computer Game Developer‚Äôs Conference, Mullich met Jon Van Caneghem, founder of veteran game developer New World Computing. Van Caneghem hired Mullich in 1997 to lead the thirty- person development team for Heroes of Might and Magic. Mullich ran the team behind the best-selling strategy game franchise for five years, including the development of Heroes of Might and Magic III, named by video gamer magazine in 2005 as the 25th best game of all time. With the financial demise of parent company The 3DO Company, Mullich left New World for software publishing giant Activision to produce Star Trek themed real-time strategy games and the Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines role-playing game based upon the Half- Life 2 engine. When his contract with Activision concluded, Mullich was hired by fellow Cyberdreams alumni Jamie Ottilie to be the development director of his mobile game publishing start-up, Abandon Mobile. During the filming of Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, Mullich was a well-known member of the J.R.R. Tolkien on-line fan community, being a news reporter and film messageboard moderator for the website Tolkien Online and, under the pseudonym Ancalagon The Black, publisher of \\"The Complete List of Film Changes,\\" documenting the differences between the films and the books.

It is the centerpiece of Temescal Regional Recreation Area, also known as Temescal Regional Park (and originally, Lake Temescal Regional Park). It is a part of the East Bay Regional Park District.  History  The lake received its name from the stream which is its source, Temescal Creek, which was dammed in 1868 to create a reservoir to provide drinking water for the greater East Bay area, pumped by the Contra Costa Water Company, owned by Anthony Chabot. Prior to being dammed, Lake Temescal was a sag pond, a depression caused by the Hayward Fault. The bulk of the manual labor of removing soil and digging to bedrock was provided by Chinese immigrants, who probably immigrated to build the railroads.Chinese Workers and the East Bay's Early Water Systems Herds of wild mustangs were used to compact the tons of dirt that were brought to create the dam. The dam is long and wide and rises above the creek. The shores of the lake were a popular camping spot with bohemian artists and writers in the late 1800s.Schenck, Marvin A. (1991). Maurice Logan, Artist and Designer. Retrieved on 2006-16-09. The British painter J.H.E.

Pacific Gas and Electric constructed its Claremont substation directly above Lake Temescal starting in October of 1921. It opened on October 23, 1922Pacific Service Magazine, vol.14, p.175, 346 (1922) and remains in service to this day. During the first half of the 20th century, the tracks of the Sacramento Northern Railroad ran along the eastern side of the lake. Until the mid 1930s, Lake Temescal extended northeastward into Temescal Canyon. This arm of the lake was traversed by a trestle for the Sacramento Northern railway until the inlet was filled in as part of the Broadway Tunnel (Caldecott Tunnel) project. As part of the project, Landvale Road was extended as a connecting viaduct with Mountain Boulevard and the Montclair District to the south. This required the construction of a large concrete retaining wall along the east side of Lake Temescal to support the fill. The railroad trestle was removed and the Sacramento Northern tracks re-laid just below it. Landvale Avenue ran above the wall to an intersection with the new extension of Broadway leading to the tunnel. The retaining wall survives, but the railroad was gone by 1957. Landvale was replaced by the Warren Freeway and Broadway by the Grove-Shafter Freeway in the late 1960s. In 1936, Lake Temescal opened to the public as one of the first three parks established by the East Bay Regional Park District. Its early amenities included a beach-like shore for swimming, a boathouse built by the WPA, a well established trail around the lake, and numerous picnic benches.  Present-day function  The lake currently supports an artificial recreational beach and is stocked periodically with rainbow trout, largemouth bass, redear sunfish, bluegill, and catfish. The park is open to all visitors from 5 am to 10 pm, and receives around 200,000 visitors a year. The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) has developed a safe eating advisory for Lake Temescal based on levels of mercury or PCBs found in fish caught from this water body. The lake is constantly becoming shallower due to sediment runoff and must be periodically dredged. Today it is approximately at its deepest point;Perry v. East Bay Regional Park Dist. (--- Cal.Rptr.3d ---, 2006 WL 1620299, Cal.App. 1 Dist., June 13, 2006). previously it was deep. Since the dam crosses the Hayward Fault, there is a possibility of dam failure in the event of an earthquake, which would cause serious flooding in parts of Oakland, Berkeley, and Emeryville. However, due to the additional fill placed between the dam and Highway 24, any hydraulic failure is now unlikely. During the 1991 Oakland firestorm, water-equipped helicopters refilled at Lake Temescal, largely draining it. The beach house is available for event rentals, such as weddings.

What is believed to be the authentic version of the painting was discovered in a private collection in 2014; the painting was previously only known to art historians a number of copies made by followers of the artist. Mina Gregori, an Italian art historian and Caravaggio specialist certified the painting's authenticity, stating \\"I know a Caravaggio when I see one.\\" If the painting is, in fact, authentic, it would be valued at over ¬£20 million ($32.3 million). It is widely accepted that Caravaggio painted the work in 1606 while in hiding at the estates of the Colonna family after fleeing Rome following the killing of Ranuccio Tommason, According to a legend popular in Caravaggio's time, after Christ's death his faithful female disciple Mary of Magdala moved to southern France, where she lived as a hermit in a cave at Sainte-Baume near Aix-en-Provence. There she was transported seven times a day by angels into the presence of God, \\"where she heard, with her bodily ears, the delightful harmonies of the celestial choirs.\\" Earlier artists had depicted Mary ascending into the divine presence through multicoloured clouds accompanied by angels; Caravaggio made the supernatural an entirely interior experience, with the Magdalen alone against a featureless dark background, caught in a ray of intense light, her head lolling back and eyes stained with tears. This revolutionary naturalistic interpretation of the legend also allowed him to capture the ambiguous parallel between mystical and erotic love, in Mary's semi-reclining posture and bared shoulder. The painting was immensely influential for future treatment of the theme by artists such as Rubens and Simon Vouet (who adopted Carvaggio's earth-bound Magdalen but reintroduced the angels), and of course Bernini and his celebrated Ecstasy of St Theresa.

The fluid fills the inside of body cavities. Serous fluid originates from serous glands, with secretions enriched with proteins and water. Serous fluid may also originate from mixed glands, which contain both mucous and serous cells. A common trait of serous fluids is their role in assisting digestion, excretion, and respiration. In medical fields, especially cytopathology, serous fluid is a synonym for effusion fluids from various body cavities. Examples of effusion fluid are pleural effusion and pericardial effusion. There are many causes of effusions which include involvement of the cavity by cancer. Cancer in a serous cavity is called a serous carcinoma. Cytopathology evaluation is recommended to evaluate the causes of effusions in these cavities. Examples Saliva consists of mucus and serous fluid; the serous fluid contains the enzyme amylase, which is important for the digestion of carbohydrates. Minor salivary glands of von Ebner present on the tongue secrete the lipase. The parotid gland produces purely serous saliva. The other major salivary glands produce mixed (serous and mucus) saliva. Another type of serous fluid is secreted by the serous membranes (serosa), two-layered membranes which line the body cavities. Serous membrane fluid collects on microvilli on the outer layer and acts as a lubricant and reduces friction from muscle movement. This can be seen in the lungs, with the pleural cavity. Blood serum is the component of blood that is neither a blood cell, nor a clotting factor. Blood serum and blood plasma are similar, but serum does not contain any clotting factors, such as fibrinogen, prothrombin, thromboplastin and many others.

Scott Fitzgerald written and published in 1920. It was first published in The Saturday Evening Post, with the help of Fitzgerald's agent, Harold Ober. It later appeared in his short story collection Flappers and Philosophers. It tells the story of a young prodigy at Princeton who falls for a spirited dancer in spite of himself.  Plot  Horace Tarbox is a young and prospective intellectual, completely absorbed in his studies. Marcia shows up at his door one day (the \\"rap\\" alluded to in the story's ending) and takes to showing Horace another side of life. It quickly snowballs into an improbable pairing between a philosopher and an actress. Marcia talks Horace into watching her in the theater, and he finds emotions and appreciation for a beautiful woman. And she returns the affection, being drawn to their connection as \\"infant prodigies\\", as she calls them. The story concludes as a role reversal of the two characters, for the better or for the worse, as Horace becomes a successful entertainer using gymnastics and Marcia becomes a successful writer. The title comes from Marcia's idea that she represents the shoulders as a \\"chorus girl\\" known for shaking her shoulders during her dance routine in order to support the couple, and Horace as the head for all the ideas and thinking. Towards the end of the story, this dynamic reverses: Horace's athletic shoulders financially supporting Marcia's writing, as she becomes the supposed \\"head\\" or thinker in the family, as an acclaimed writer.  Themes  Fitzgerald weaves in several themes that he would later hone‚Äîand become famous for‚Äîin his short stories and novels. One of his recurring themes is the odd matching of love interests, of people not supposed to find love with each other, as in the novel \\"The Great Gatsby\\". But in the short story the mismatch is hopeful. Horace is from the intellectual elite, born and bred to think instead of live. Marcia represents the adventures of life, the passion of art and a steaming sexuality. The second major theme is the adjustment of a career goal for love, especially in the beginning stages of romance, which would be taken up again in the novel Tender is the Night. Horace admits to having trouble thinking with the idea of Marcia in his head. That sense builds until he finds himself being consumed by passion. The third major theme is the mildly-bitter end. At the end of the short story, Horace says that he should not have answered the door. He has given up something for romance: Marcia has gained fame from it. This anticipates Fitzgerald's dispute with his wife, Zelda, who he thought kept him from writing more and better. External links *Head and Shoulders, full text * Short stories by F.

Ron Hubbard, extending his earlier writings on Dianetics. Its original subtitle was \\"simplified, faster dianetic techniques\\", although more recent editions have the subtitle \\"Prediction of human behavior\\". It is one of the canonical texts of Scientology. The title of Science of Survival alludes to Science and Sanity, a highly popular work by Alfred Korzybski, the founder of general semantics. Hubbard acknowledged Korzybski's contributions in the book.Jon Atack, A Piece of Blue Sky, p. 122 (Lyle Stuart, 1990) It has remained perpetually in print over the years, and is currently published by Bridge Publications, Inc. Science of Survival was the follow-up to Hubbard's best-selling Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health. It expanded significantly on Dianetics, setting out what Hubbard called the \\"dynamics of behaviour\\" and provided descriptions of new techniques of Dianetics processing that Hubbard described as being faster and simpler than those that he had advanced previously. In the book, Hubbard introduced two concepts that were later to become key elements of Scientology: theta and the tone scale. He also endorsed the concept of past lives. Theta Although Hubbard had not yet established Scientology, which was overtly presented as a religious practice, and continued to maintain that Dianetics was a scientific subject with techniques aimed towards therapeutic results, the information on \\"theta\\" in the book clearly begins to move the subject into a religious direction. Hubbard describes theta as a sort of \\"life energy\\", and contrasts it with \\"MEST\\" \\"matter, energy, space and time\\", the components of the physical universe. He discusses the concept of \\"entheta\\", or enturbulated theta, and \\"enMEST\\", or enturbulated MEST, as being confused or dysfunctional states of being, and describes how at low levels of the tone scale theta and MEST become overwhelmed by entheta and enMEST before ultimately death occurs and only enMEST remains, whilst as the tone scale is ascended theta and MEST act more and more in accord with each other until MEST is entirely overcome and pure theta is attained. This concept of a spiritual life energy entering and purifying the physical universe recalls the ideas of Gnostic religions. Tests and results As Hubbard tells the story in Science of Survival, in 1950 the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation agreed to a definitive test of claims demanded by the psychological community who wanted Dianetics to validate its claims. The claims to be tested were increased IQ, the relief of psychoses, and the relief of psychosomatic illnesses. Hubbard said that the tests had been done using psychology's strictest psychometric protocols (Minnesota Multiphasic Test and the Wechsler-Bellevue, \\"Form B\\") with examiners Gordon Southon, Peggy Southon and Dalmyra Ibanez, Ph.D., Ed. D. Hubbard also said that their witnessed signatures were affixed to each bank of tests and that all three claims were validated by these tests and these psychometrists. In January 1951 Hubbard published a booklet by these same alleged doctors: Dianetic Processing A Brief Survey of Research Projects and Preliminary Results by Dalmyra Ibanez, Ph.D., Ed. D., Gordon Southon, Peggy Southon and Peggy Benton In it, the authors state: The names of the persons in this \\"group of psychologists\\" are not mentioned. The booklet presents case histories and X-Rays and says that it proves that Dianetics can cure \\"aberrations\\" including manic depression, asthma, arthritis, colitis and \\"overt homosexuality.\\" The booklet further says that it used twelve different tests and presents results from five, four of which came from the California Test Bureau and had according to a 1946 investigation of V. E. Ordahl of the University of California no evidence of reliability or validity. Modern reprintings of Science of Survival (post twentieth printing) no longer contain information about this study or mention the alleged IQ gains of about ten points and other similar alleged gains.

Body odor and the tone scale In Science of Survival, Hubbard discusses the correlation between body odor, bodily substances, and one's position on the emotional tone scale: Controversy One passage in particular in Chapter 27 of Science of Survival has been singled out for criticism by opponents of Scientology.For one example of such criticism, see Solitary Trees, an anti-Scientology website In it, Hubbard states that > The sudden and abrupt deletion of all individuals occupying the lower bands > of the tone scale from the social order would result in an almost instant > rise in the cultural tone and would interrupt the dwindling spiral into > which any society may have entered. It is not necessary to produce a world > of clears in order to have a reasonable and worthwhile social order; it is > only necessary to delete those individuals who range from 2.0 down, either > by processing them enough to get their tone level above the 2.0 line ‚Äî a > task which, indeed, is not very great, since the amount of processing in > many cases might be under fifty hours, although it might also in others be > in excess of two hundred ‚Äî or simply quarantining them from the society.

Los > Angeles: The American Saint Hill Organization, 1975 (originally published in > 1951). Critics, such as the French Government's Anti-cult interministerial mission, believe that forcibly quarantining all human beings that are classified low on Scientology's tone scale would be a violation of human rights.Le rapport MILS, page 61 Furthermore, the book's claims that \\"adders are safe bedmates compared to people on the lower bands of the tone scale\\" and that it is one's \\"level on the tone scale which gives [him or her] value\\"L. Ron Hubbard, Science of Survival: Prediction of Human Behavior, Bridge Publications: Los Angeles, CA, 1989, p145. have also come under fire.Le rapport MILS (page 61), Solitary Trees, etc. Hubbard has also been criticized for the strong opposition to abortion, which he displays in the book, in which he says that \\"America spends [billions] yearly on institutions for the insane and jails for criminals ... primarily because of attempted abortions done by some sex- blocked mother to whom children are a curse, not a blessing of God.\\"Bent Corydon, L. Ron Hubbard: Messiah or Madman?, p. 272 (Lyle Stuart, 1987) Publication history The book was published in August 1951 and was originally dedicated to his daughter Alexis Valerie Hubbard (whom he later disowned). It was dictated on SoundScriber discs in Havana, Cuba, where Hubbard took refuge when his marriage to his second wife Sara Northrup Hubbard broke down. Author Russell Miller claims Hubbard was in an advanced state of mental deterioration at the time of the book's creation, consuming large quantities of alcohol and addictive prescription drugs, consumed by paranoia and elaborate persecution complexes relating to a wholly fictional attempt by Communists to ruin Dianetics, and was embroiled in a bitter and often surreal custody dispute over his then infant child Alexis.Russell Miller, Bare-Faced Messiah, p. 193. (Michael Joseph, 1987) By the time Science of Survival was published, the public popularity of Dianetics had faded and only one Dianetics Foundation Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation in Wichita, Kansas, funded by millionaire Dianeticist Don Purcell was still in existence. The Wichita Foundation underwrote the costs of printing the book. It recorded poor sales when first published, with only 1,250 copies of the first edition being printed. However, the book has remained in print as a standard reference work of the Church of Scientology and is listed in its Materials Guide Chart. A deluxe 50th anniversary revised edition was released in 2001 and a new revised edition in 2007.

Biography Zandonai was born in Borgo Sacco, Rovereto, then part of Austria‚ÄìHungary. As a young man, he showed such an aptitude for music that he entered the Pesaro Conservatorio in 1899 and completed his studies in 1902; he completed the nine-year curriculum in only three years. Among his teachers was Pietro Mascagni, who regarded him highly. During this period he composed the Inno degli studenti trentini, that is, the anthem of the organised irredentist youth of his native province. His essay for graduation was an opera named Il ritorno di Odisseo (The Return of Ulysses), based on a poem by Giovanni Pascoli, for singers, choir and orchestra. The same year 1902 he put to music another Pascoli poem, Il sogno di Rosetta. At a soir√©e in Milan in 1908, he was heard by Arrigo Boito, who introduced him to Giulio Ricordi, one of the dominating figures in Italian musical publishing at the time. His opera Il grillo del focolare has received occasional Italian performances since its premiere at the Politeama Chiarella di Torino in 1908. Zandonai's fame rests largely on his opera Francesca da Rimini, a free adaptation of a tragedy which Gabriele D'Annunzio had written expanding a passage from Dante's Inferno; it has never fallen entirely from the repertoire, and has been recorded several times. Some time after the premiere, he married soprano Tarquinia Tarquini, for whom he had created the role of Conchita in the eponymous opera (dealing with a topic that Puccini had first considered and then rejected). Soon, however, war broke out; patriotic Zandonai in 1916 composed a song, Alla Patria (\\"For the Motherland\\"), dedicated to Italy, with the result that his home and belongings in Sacco (then still in Austro‚ÄìHungarian hands) were confiscated (they were returned to him after the war). When Puccini died without completing the music for the last act of Turandot, Zandonai was among several composers the Ricordi publishing firm considered for the task of finishing it. Puccini himself, in his final illness, seems to have supported the choice of Zandonai ‚Äî certainly Toscanini looked with approval on this choice ‚Äî but his son Tonio Puccini, for reasons still obscure, vetoed it. One version is that Tonio Puccini thought that Zandonai was too well-known and for that reason would be associated with the opera and might even overshadow his father. Ultimately Franco Alfano was chosen to complete Turandot. In 1935 Zandonai became the director of the Rossini Conservatory in his beloved Pesaro. There he revived some works of Rossini, such as Il viaggio a Reims and the overture for Maometto secondo. In 1941 he re-orchestrated La gazza ladra, reducing it to three acts. Three years later, he died in Trebbiantico, Pesaro, after undergoing gallstone surgery. His last words were for the priest who announced to him that Rome had been liberated the day before. The dying composer said, in his native dialect: \\"Good! Viva l'Italia; the sound part\\".

History The Chelan was built in 1981, as an Issaquah Class ferry, for service on the Edmonds-Kingston route. In the early 1990s, ridership on the Edmonds-Kingston route had grown to the extent that the Chelan could not handle capacity, and she was replaced on this route by a second Super-class vessel. The Chelan was kept in reserve to serve as replacement ferry. On many of the routes she would serve, she would replace a larger Issaquah 130 ferry, causing service disruptions by carrying fewer vehicles. In 2004, she was refit, much like her sister ships to include a second vehicle deck along the outer bulkheads. After changes in Coast Guard rules for international travel, the Chelan was upgraded in 2005 to meet the SOLAS standards. As a result of the SOLAS upgrades, the Chelan often makes the international crossing to Sidney, British Columbia, although the , the other vessel with the SOLAS standards, usually operates on this route during fall and early spring operations. The refit also coincided with the modification of the interior layout of the Chelan to match that of its sister- ships, which had their interiors upgraded beginning in the early 2000s. The exception on the Chelan is the addition of a duty free area on board for the international crossings.

Later that year, the president of the Province, Jos√© Lustosa Paranagu√°, approved a larger budget and initiated a competition for the presentation of plans. The chosen project was made by the Gabinete Portugu√™s de Engenharia e Arquitectura, an engineering and architecture office from Lisbon. By 1884, construction was ready to begin under the Italian architect Celestial Sacardim. Work proceeded slowly over the following fifteen years with some stops and restarts from 1885 to 1892. By 1895, when the masonry work and exterior were completed, the decoration of the interior and the installation of electric lighting could begin more rapidly. The theatre was inaugurated on December 31, 1896, with the first performance occurring on January 7, 1897, with the Italian opera, La Gioconda, by Amilcare Ponchielli. Architecture and style The theatre's architectural style is considered typically Renaissance Revival. The roofing tiles were imported from Alsace, the steel walls from Glasgow, Scotland and the Carrara marble for the stairs, statues and columns, from Italy. The dome is covered with 36,000 decorated ceramic tiles painted in the colors of the national flag of Brazil. The interior furnishing came from France in the Louis Quinze style. Italian artist Domenico de Angelis the Younger painted the panels that decorate the ceilings of the auditorium and of the audience chamber. The curtain, with its painting \\"Meeting of the Waters\\", was originally created in Paris by Crispim do Amaral. The theatre's 198 chandeliers were imported from Italy, including 32 of Murano glass.

Crosman is also a producer of many varieties of airgun and airsoft ammunition and Powerlet cartridges. In addition, Crosman sells branded, licensed products as well as a variety of airsoft guns. Crosman history Crosman was incorporated in 1924 as Crosman Rifle Company, after the sale of \\"Crosman Brothers\\" to Frank Hahn. The firm was based in Fairport, New York, a suburb of Rochester (from the print on the bottom of free vintage targets available as a pdf on the company's website). In 1960 it was acquired by Bangor Punta Corp..https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rqkgAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=FGkFAAAAIBAJ&pg;=4309%2C6685658 In 1970, the company moved to another Rochester suburb, East Bloomfield. Crosman's first models were the traditional American multi-pump pneumatic design, where 3 to 10 pumps would pressurize a reservoir for each shot. Descendants of these original models are still made, in rifle, pistol and carbine form, and they remain quite popular. In 1992, Crosman acquired the Benjamin Sheridan company's assets. From 1971 through 1989, Coleman of Wichita, Kansas owned Crosman. In 1989, MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings of New York acquired Coleman and sold Crosman to Worldwide Sports and Recreation. In 1997, an investment group headed by Leonard Pickett purchased the company. Pickett was named CEO and held that position until his death in 2000. Ken D'Arcy served as CEO from 1997 to 2012. In 2011 Wellspring Capital Management purchased Crosman and in August 2012 Phil Dolci was named CEO and served until May 2015. Brad Johnson was named as Executive Chairman and Interim CEO while remaining Chairman & CEO of United Sporting Companies, a separate company that is also part of the Wellspring portfolio. In June 2017 Wellspring sold Crosman to Compass Diversified Holdings, INC (NYSE: CODI). Upon the sale of the company, Robert Beckwith was appointed the new CEO. Robert had previously been the CFO under Brad Johnson. =Benjamin= In 1882, Walter R. Benjamin of St. Louis, Missouri, introduced the first Benjamin air rifle. These Benjamin Pump guns were manufactured by the Wissler Instrument Co. of St. Louis under a U.S. patent that had been issued to Benjamin. Unlike many air guns of this period, the Benjamin was intended not as a toy, but as a high-power compressed air gun in which pressure was built up by pumping a built-in piston located beneath the barrel. The Benjamin Air Rifle Company was formed in 1902 when Walter R. Benjamin purchased the patent rights from the defunct St. Louis Air Rifle Company. Production from 1902 to 1904 and from 1906 to 1986 was in St. Louis. In 1977, the Benjamin Air Rifle Company purchased Sheridan Products in Racine, Wisconsin. Benjamin and Sheridan were acquired by Crosman in 1992. By 2015, Benjamin was positioned as Crosman Corporation's adult hunting and high performance line and Sheridan had its name on one model: the Cowboy, a youth- oriented lever action. CO2 In the 1930s, Crosman began to experiment with CO2 power. Like other CO2 guns of the day, they were bulk fill, which meant that liquid CO2 was loaded into a pressurized reservoir on the gun. Other manufacturers started to use 8 gram CO2 bulbs used in soda dispensers. Crosman capitalized on this in 1954 by introducing a new 12 gram CO2 bulb, called a Powerlet. The new Powerlet gave more shots per bulb than the soda bulb, and with the addition of a simple spacer, a Powerlet gun could use the shorter 8 gram bulb. The 12 gram Powerlet, charged with CO2 and a tiny amount of lubricating oil to keep the airgun's seals conditioned, is used by nearly all manufacturers of CO2 airguns today. In 2004, Crosman introduced a new disposable CO2 power source, the 88 gram AirSource.

He carried on the nationalistic message of Ahmad Khani in his writings. He wanted to enlighten the people and help them to remedy the problems of illiteracy and backwardness and ideas which result from lack of knowledge and religious fanaticism. He encouraged people instead to turn to science and to the realities of modern society in the struggle to liberate and build an independent Kurdistan. According to him, a Kurd is one who speaks Kurdish. In his time, in the late 19th century, the remaining Kurdish principalities had been overthrown by the Ottoman and Persian states. Koyi attacked the shaikhs and mullahs who did not care for the Kurdish language and the notables who ignored the destinies of their people. Living his last years in cosmopolitan Istanbul, he was familiar with the nationalist struggles and the material advancement of modern nations.http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/kurdish-written-literature He constantly advocated use of the Kurdish language. Although his own medium was poetry, he urged the Kurds to publish magazines and newspapers. Calling on the Kurds, in the 1880s, to unite and form their own independent state, he also urged them to use the modern tools such as newspapers and magazines for mass communication. The first Kurdish newspaper, Kurdistan, was published in Cairo in 1898, a year after Haji Qadir's death. Farangis Ghaderi who has studied his poetry in her PhD dissertation argues that modern Kurdish poetry emerged in the late nineteenth century and with Koy√Æ's poetry. She also argues that Hac√Æ Qadir√Æ Koy√Æ should be considered the architect of Kurdish nationalism. Jalal Dabagh wrote a book discussing Haji Qadir Koyi with the same name.

Eads, diagnosed with ovarian cancer, was turned down for treatment by a dozen doctors out of fear that treating such a patient would hurt their reputations. By the time Eads received treatment, the cancer was too advanced to save his life.  Plot  The film begins in the spring and documents Eads' life through the following winter. Eads falls in love with Lola, a transgender woman. He spends those remaining warm days in the company of his \\"chosen family\\": Maxwell, Cas, and \\"the rest\\". That summer, his mother and father drive ten hours to visit Robert, who is still their daughter in their eyes. Later that year, Eads makes his last appearance at the Southern Comfort Conference in Atlanta, Georgia, a prominent transgender gathering. Already feeling ill, he addresses a crowd of 500 and takes Lola to what is for them a prom that never was. Shortly after the conference, Eads dies in a nursing home with his chosen family. After Eads' death, his ashes were spread across the family farm around a lone Christmas tree which was to symbolize Robert's many changes and blossomings in life. Eads' friends, Tom and Debbie King, also appear in the film. They saved Eads' life when he collapsed in a pool of his own blood while staying with them. They initially sought treatment for Eads but were unable to locate a doctor willing to treat a transgender man. Robert's lifelong struggle to have his outer appearance match his inner self is a salient theme in the movie. All persons portrayed in the movie wrestle with themes of rejection from others, rejection of self, feeling ostracized from humanity and ultimately crafting their own lives and personal support systems. Stage adaptation A stage musical, based on the film, was presented off-Broadway at the Public Theater.

All but two of the roles had been filled by cisgender actors. However, Pride Films & Plays in Chicago announced a new production in 2019 featuring trans performers playing all five transgender characters.  Cinematic influence  Southern Comfort is included within texts that cross reference cinematic with feminist theory, often in conjunction with other films with transgender leads such as Boys Don‚Äôt Cry and The Crying Game. These texts state that the documentary serves as a corrective device for many transgender stereotypes. Since the transgender character is historically stereotyped in film, Southern Comfort's style has created a cinematic influence, specifically on how the audience views transgender bodies. One of them is the fact that it doesn‚Äôt use ‚Äúcamp‚Äù or ‚Äúfetish‚Äù as the backbone to Robert Eads. Another is the use of the \\"transgender look\\". This is a term coined by Judith Halberstam which was adapted from bell hook's theory of \\"The Oppositional Gaze\\", which was a way to politicize the way black women are \\"gazed\\" at and seen as spectacles within cinematography. The \\"transgender look\\" was a way of theorizing transgender readability by letting the transgender character exist outside of the \\"male gaze\\" - which is the patriarchal lens through which most cinema has been processed. It is the idea that we are ‚Äúlooking with‚Äù the transgender character instead of observing or ‚Äúlooking at‚Äù them. Southern Comfort is part of these discussions because it is one of the first films, along with the others earlier mentioned, that uses these cinematic preferences to erase stereotype and influence the film's audience in a new way.

Stanocola Park, after more than forty years of use, was replaced by the new City Park Field in 1933. A contract for a permanent, on-campus stadium structure (with dormitory complex) was awarded by the state board of education on November 14, 1938. The new stadium was to be completed along the field's west sideline by creatively taking Works Progress Administration funds that were earmarked to build a student dormitory and then building the dorm in the shape of a grandstand‚Äîa technique that was possibly borrowed from Skipper Heard's 1931 expansion plans for Tiger Stadium at nearby Louisiana State University (the University of Tennessee similarly had dorm rooms incorporated into a Neyland Stadium expansion project around this time period as well). By the 1939 season Mumford's football program was so successful that it had begun turning heads even within the local white community; as a sign of the changing times, Southern had begun advertising accommodations for white patrons on the new stadium grounds. When the stadium was completed in 1940, it included a 150-seat section for white patrons. One of the more noteworthy white fans was Ellis A. \\"Little Fuzzy\\" Brown who, along with his twin brother James (\\"Big Fuzzy\\"), coached Istrouma High School into the most successful dynasty in Louisiana's highest classification of prep football. Wooden bleacher seats were added to the east side in the late 1950s, and an additional expansion was funded by the state in 1958. In the 1960s the dorm rooms were converted into the team's meeting and locker rooms. Because SU's stadium could only hold 13,000 fans in the 1970s, Baton Rouge's Memorial Stadium‚Äîwhich could max out at 25,000‚Äîoccasionally provided an alternative venue for prominent games. However, Memorial Stadium had to be used exclusively for home games while the on-campus stadium was being enlarged, beginning immediately after the 1977 home-opener. In 1982, with the expansion project finally complete, \\"University Stadium\\" was renamed after Mumford. 7,500 seats were added to boost capacity to 20,000‚Äîalong with improved lighting that allowed for televised night games. 6,000 bleacher seats were added to the end zones before the 1992 home opener. 5,000 temporary bleacher seats were placed in the end zones in 1998. All 5,000 bleacher seats were then concentrated on the northern end zone side for the 1999 season, to go along with 1,000 new temporary bleacher seats that were also being installed there. The concrete grandstands along the sidelines held 24,000 seats. A $6.75 million renovation was begun on A. W. Mumford Stadium's west side in 2000. The structure was waterproofed, concrete seating was replaced with aluminum bleachers, and the cramped, single-story press box was replaced with a two-story box that included two elevators, seven suites, and an increase to four restrooms from the original one. The east side of the stadium was then renovated before the 2001 season. However, the Jaguars still had to dress at the F. G. Clark Activity Center, and the opponents still had to dress at the Seymour Gym; meanwhile, the stadium's seating capacity stood at 24,000 seats. In 2009 an extensive addition was completed behind the north end zone. 2,300 seats were added along with training rooms, weight rooms, conference rooms, coaches' offices, a student lounge, media rooms, memorabilia rooms, and eight luxury boxes. In 2016 UBU Sports, Incorporated-produced synthetic field turf was installed. Track and field Every spring semester the stadium hosts the Pelican Relays. College and high school track teams compete at this event.

History The Kittitas was built in 1980, as the second Issaquah 100 class ferry. When delivered it acted as a relief boat until it was moved to the Mukilteo‚ÄìClinton route in the mid 1980s. In 1990, in order to keep up with growing demand, the Kittitas underwent a capacity expansion by adding additional vehicle areas above the vehicle areas along the outside edge of the ferry. These upgrades had been planned for in the original design of the vessels. The ferry's passenger cabin was updated in the late 1990s. Included in the upgrades were the removal of many tables located in the passenger cabin to allow for the bench seats to be spaced closer together in some sections of the ship. The galley area was also upgraded and each ship was given a unique look. The original color on the Kittitas was yellow, and her new colors are a mix of turquoise and orange. The Kittitas serves the triangle route along with the MV Cathlamet and MV Sealth.
