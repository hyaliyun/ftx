In 1898 he graduated from Alexandrovski Lyceum in Saint Petersburg and from the same year started his career at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. His two big assignments came in 1910-1912 when he was appointed a head of Russian diplomatic mission in Bulgaria, and then in 1912-1916 when he served as the first secretary at the Russian embassy in Japan. In 1917, after February Revolution in Russia, Lev Urusov emigrated to France and lived there till his death in 1933. Prince Urusov was one of the leading tennis players of Russia those years. In 1907 he won the Championship of Saint Petersburg, and the next year he became the Champion of Russia. In 1913, during his diplomatic mission in Japan, he won the Open Championship of Tokyo. In 1910, he was elected a member of International Olympic Committee. He retained this position even after the revolution, and remained, while living in France, the only official representative of Russia in IOC. After the end of the World War he repeatingly submitted proposals for incorporating Russian teams back to the Olympic movement. Toward the 1920 Olympic he suggested that a team of Russian emigrants may compete, while four years later he asked for the participation of two teams, one composed of the emigrants and another representing Soviet Russia. The proposals were rejected, and Pierre de Coubertin later wrote that he regretted this rejection. The rejection was based on the fact that the Soviet Russia has not been recognized yet by the IOC while the emigrants were not representing a distinct existing country. In 2008, Prince Lev Urusov was inducted into the Tennis Hall of Fame of Russia. Reporters were informed that no relatives of Lev Urusov remained in Russia and that his award will wait in Russia till his relatives abroad claim it.

The decree, a fragmentary marble inscription, is located in the National Historical Museum in Sofia.  Inscription  The decree mentions a Dacian town named Argedauon (), potentially Argidava or Argedava. The stone is damaged and name was read differently by various editors and scholars: * [·ºêœÄŒøœÅŒµœçŒ∏Œ∑ Œµ·º∞œÇ] ·ºàœÅŒ≥Œ≠Œ¥Œ±[œÖŒπ]ŒøŒΩ by Wilhelm Dittenberger (1898) * [œÄŒ≠ŒºœàŒ±œÇ?] ŒëœÅ[Œ≥]Œ≠Œ¥Œ±[œÅ]ŒøŒΩ by Ernst Kalinka (1905) * [...Œµ·º∞]œÇ ·ºàœÅŒ≥Œ≠Œ¥Œ±œÖŒøŒΩ by Wilhelm Dittenberger and Friedrich Hiller (1917), noting that the œÖ is an uncertain reading * ·ºàœÅŒ≥Œ≠Œ¥Œ±Œ≤ŒøŒΩ by Vasile P√¢rvan (1923) The inscription also refers to the Dacian king Burebista, and one interpretation is that Akornion was his chief adviser (, literally \\"first friend\\") in Dionysopolis. Other sources indicate that Akornion was sent as an ambassador of Burebista to Pompey, to discuss an alliance against Julius Caesar. This leads to the assumption that the mentioned Argedava was Burebista's capital of the Dacian kingdom. This source unfortunately doesn't mention the location of Argedava and historians opinions are split in two groups. One school of thought, led by historians Constantin Daicoviciu and Hadrian Daicoviciu, assume the inscription talks about Argidava and place the potential capital of Burebista at VƒÉrƒÉdia, Cara≈ü-Severin County, Romania. The forms Argidava and Arcidava found in other ancient sources like Ptolemy's Geographia (c. 150 AD) and Tabula Peutingeriana (2nd century AD), clearly place a Dacian town with those names at this geographical location. The site is also close to Sarmizegetusa, a later Dacian capital. Others, led by historian Vasile P√¢rvan and professor Radu Vulpe place Argedava at Pope≈üti, a district in the town of MihƒÉile»ôti, Giurgiu County, Romania. Arguments include the name connection with the Arge≈ü River, geographical position on a potential road to Dionysopolis which Akornion followed, and most importantly the size of the archaeological discovery at Pope≈üti that hints to a royal palace. However no other sources seem to name the dava discovered at Pope≈üti, so no exact assumptions can be made about its Dacian name. It is also quite possible for the two different davae to be just homonyms. The marble inscription is damaged in many areas, including right before the word \\"Argedauon\\", and it is possible the original word could have been \\"Sargedauon\\" () or \\"Zargedauon\\". This form could potentially be linked to \\"Zargidaua\\" mentioned by Ptolemy at a different geographical location. Or again, these two could be simple homonyms.

The storm was part of the 2010 Pacific typhoon and hurricane season. On December 18, 2010, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) began monitoring a subtropical cyclone near the International Dateline for possible tropical cyclogenesis. Over the following two days, the system tracked southwestward, entering the Western Pacific basin. It then began to transition into a tropical cyclone. Shortly before crossing the dateline on December 20, the CPHC assessed the system to have become a tropical storm. The storm was assigned the name Omeka several hours later as it moved into the CPHC's area of responsibility - which is from 140¬∞W to the International Dateline. Upon doing so, Omeka attained its peak intensity with winds of 60 mph (100 km/h). Later on December 20, wind shear in the region increased, causing the system to weaken. By December 21, the center of Omeka was devoid of convection and dissipated on the next day. Omeka brushed Lisianski Island with no damage. Meteorological history The origins of Omeka were from an extratropical cyclone in the western Pacific Ocean. The storm tracked southeastward near the International Dateline, and by December 18 it transitioned into a kona storm and soon into a subtropical cyclone. A large, sprawling system, little development was initially expected to take place as the storm moved towards the southwest. As the low moved over warmer waters, the cyclone was able to maintain an area of deep convection near its center. According to the CPHC, the system was nearly fully tropical early on December 19 as it moved west of the dateline. However, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) considered the low to be fully subtropical as a cold-core was present over the center of circulation. At this time, the storm had an eye-like feature, and attained its peak strength with winds of 60 miles per hour (100 km/h) and a barometric pressure of . Later on December 19, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression as the low turned towards the southeast. Early on December 20, the JMA issued their final advisory on the depression as it moved east of the dateline and reentered the CPHC's area of responsibility. Wide-view of Omeka as a subtropical storm and the larger extratropical system it originated from Already classifying it as a tropical storm, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC) issued their first advisory on the system at 0900 UTC on December 20, at which time it was situated roughly 505 miles (815 km) south of Midway Island. Upon issuing this advisory, they designated the system as Tropical Storm Omeka, the first named storm of the Central Pacific season. The storm generally tracked towards the northeast, in response to a mid-level low to the west, throughout the remainder of its existence. Traversing an area of decreased sea surface temperatures and increasing wind shear, Omeka quickly weakened to a minimal tropical storm later on December 20, with winds of 40 miles per hour (65 km/h). Intermittent bursts of convection allowed the system to maintain gale-force winds through December 21; however, persistent shear finally took its toll later that morning. Between 0700 and 0800 UTC, Omeka brushed Lisianski Island. Around 0900 UTC, the CPHC issued their final advisory on Omeka, as it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone roughly east-southeast of Midway Island, near Lisianski Island. Omeka's extratropical remnant dissipated on December 23. Impact and records On December 21, the center of Omeka brushed Lisianski Island, with winds of 40 miles per hour (65 km/h). However, no tropical storm watches or warnings were issued since the CPHC anticipated weakening prior to the storm passing the island. On December 20, Omeka crossed the International Dateline into the northeast Pacific, becoming the first tropical cyclone to do so since Tropical Storm Wene in 2000, At the time, Omeka was judged to have existed in the northeast Pacific later than any other storm since the 1960s, when reliable records begin in the basin. However, according to the CPHC's database, there are two possible tropical cyclones in 1903 and 1904 which developed on December 23. In addition, even though it did not strengthen into a tropical storm, Tropical Depression Nine-C of the 2015 Pacific hurricane season formed later in the calendar year than Omeka, forming on December 31, 2015 and dissipating the next day. Omeka was the first December storm in the Central Pacific since Tropical Storm Paka in 1997. Throughout 2010, the entire Pacific Ocean experienced record-low tropical cyclone activity due to a strong 2010‚Äì12 La Ni√±a event. Since Omeka was the first storm in the Central Pacific during the year, it marked the latest start to a season since reliable records began, excluding seasons with no storms.

Two of the most distinctive characteristics of laser emission are spatial coherence and spectral coherence. While spatial coherence is related to the beam divergence of the laser, spectral coherence is evaluated by measuring the linewidth of laser radiation. Theory =History: First derivation of the laser linewidth= The first human-made coherent light source was a maser. The acronym MASER stands for \\"Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation\\". More precisely, it was the ammonia maser operating at 12.5 mm wavelength that was demonstrated by Gordon, Zeiger, and Townes in 1954. One year later the same authors derived theoretically the linewidth of their device by making the reasonable approximations that their ammonia maser (i) is a true continuous-wave (CW) maser, (ii) is a true four-level maser, and (iii) exhibits no intrinsic resonator losses but only outcoupling losses. Notably, their derivation was entirely semi-classical, describing the ammonia molecules as quantum emitters and assuming classical electromagnetic fields (but no quantized fields or quantum fluctuations), resulting in the half-width-at- half-maximum (HWHM) maser linewidth : Delta u_{rm M}^* = frac{4 pi k_{rm B} T (Delta u_{rm c}^*)^{2}}{P_{rm out}} Leftrightarrow Delta u_{rm M} = frac{2 pi k_{rm B} T (Delta u_{rm c})^{2}}{P_{rm out}}, denoted here by an asterisk and converted to the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) linewidth Delta u_{rm M} = 2 Delta u_{rm M}^* . k_{rm B} is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, P_{rm out} is the output power, and Delta u_{rm c}^* and Delta u_{rm c} = 2 Delta u_{rm c}^* are the HWHM and FWHM linewidths of the underlying passive microwave resonator, respectively. In 1958, two years before Maiman demonstrated the laser (initially called an \\"optical maser\\"), Schawlow and Townes transferred the maser linewidth to the optical regime by replacing the thermal energy k_{rm B} T by the photon energy h u_{rm L} , where h is Planck's constant and u_{rm L} is the frequency of laser light, thereby approximating that (iv) one photon is coupled into the lasing mode by spontaneous emission during the photon-decay time tau_{rm c} , resulting in the original Schawlow-Townes approximation of the laser linewidth: : Delta u_{rm L,ST}^* = frac{4 pi h u_{rm L} (Delta u_{rm c}^*)^{2}}{P_{rm out}} Leftrightarrow Delta u_{rm L,ST} = frac{2 pi h u_{rm L} (Delta u_{rm c})^{2}}{P_{rm out}}. Also the transfer from the microwave to the optical regime was entirely semi-classical, without assuming quantized fields or quantum fluctuations. Consequently, the original Schawlow-Townes equation is entirely based on semi-classical physics and is a four-fold approximation of a more general laser linewidth, which will be derived in the following. =Passive resonator mode: Photon-decay time= We assume a two-mirror Fabry-P√©rot resonator of geometrical length ell , homogeneously filled with an active laser medium of refractive index n . We define the reference situation, namely the passive resonator mode, for a resonator whose active medium is transparent, i.e., it does not introduce gain or absorption. The round-trip time t_{rm RT} of light travelling in the resonator with speed c = c_0/n , where c_0 is the speed of light in vacuum, and the free spectral range Delta u_{rm FSR} are given by : t_{rm RT} = frac{1}{Delta u_{rm FSR}} = frac{2 ell}{c}. Light in the longitudinal resonator mode of interest oscillates at the q-th resonance frequency : u_L = frac{q}{t_{rm RT}} = q Delta u_{rm FSR}. The exponential outcoupling decay time tau_{rm out} and the corresponding decay-rate constant 1 / tau_{rm out} are related to the intensity reflectances R_i of the two resonator mirrors i = 1, 2 by : R_1 R_2 = e^{- t_{rm RT} / tau_{rm out}} Rightarrow frac{1}{tau_{rm out}} = frac{-ln{(R_1 R_2)}}{t_{rm RT}}. The exponential intrinsic loss time tau_{rm loss} and the corresponding decay-rate constant 1 / tau_{rm loss} are related to the intrinsic round- trip loss L_{rm RT} by : 1 - L_{rm RT} = e^{- t_{rm RT} / tau_{rm loss}} Rightarrow frac{1}{tau_{rm loss}} = frac{-ln{(1 - L_{rm RT})}}{t_{rm RT}}. The exponential photon-decay time tau_c and the corresponding decay-rate constant 1 / tau_{rm c} of the passive resonator are then given by : frac{1}{tau_{rm c}} = frac{1}{tau_{rm out}} + frac{1}{tau_{rm loss}} = frac{-ln{[R_1 R_2 (1 - L_{rm RT})]}}{t_{rm RT}}. All three exponential decay times average over the round-trip time t_{rm RT}. In the following, we assume that ell , n , R_1 , R_2 , and L_{rm RT} , hence also tau_{rm out} , tau_{rm loss} , and tau_{rm c} do not vary significantly over the frequency range of interest. =Passive resonator mode: Lorentzian linewidth, Q-factor, coherence time and length= Besides the photon-decay time tau_{rm c} , the spectral-coherence properties of the passive resonator mode can be equivalently expressed by the following parameters. The FWHM Lorentzian linewidth Delta u_{rm c} of the passive resonator mode that appears in the Schawlow-Townes equation is derived from the exponential photon-decay time tau_{rm c} by Fourier transformation, : Delta u_{rm c} = frac{1}{2 pi tau_{rm c}}. The Q-factor Q_{rm c} is defined as the energy W_{rm stored} stored in the resonator mode over the energy W_{rm lost} lost per oscillation cycle, : Q_{rm c} = 2 pi frac{W_{rm stored}(t)}{W_{rm lost}(t)} = 2 pi frac{varphi (t)}{-frac{1}{ u_L} frac{d}{dt} varphi (t)} = 2 pi u_L tau_{rm c} = frac{ u_L}{Delta u_{rm c}}, where varphi = W_{rm stored} / h u_L is the number of photons in the mode. The coherence time tau_{rm c}^{rm coh} and coherence length ell_{rm c}^{rm coh} of light emitted from the mode are given by : tau_{rm c}^{rm coh} = frac{1}{c} ell_{rm c}^{rm coh} = 2 tau_{rm c}. =Active resonator mode: Gain, photon-decay time, Lorentzian linewidth, Q-factor, coherence time and length= With the population densities N_{2} and N_{1} of upper and lower laser level, respectively, and the effective cross sections sigma_{rm e} and sigma_{rm a} of stimulated emission and absorption at the resonance frequency u_L , respectively, the gain per unit length in the active laser medium at the resonance frequency u_L is given by : g = sigma_{rm e} N_{2} - sigma_{rm a} N_{1}. A value of g > 0 induces amplification, whereas g < 0 induces absorption of light at the resonance frequency u_L , resulting in an elongated or shortened photon-decay time tau_{rm L} of photons out of the active resonator mode, respectively, : frac{1}{tau_{rm L}} = frac{1}{tau_{rm c}} - cg. The other four spectral-coherence properties of the active resonator mode are obtained in the same way as for the passive resonator mode. The Lorentzian linewidth is derived by Fourier transformation, : Delta u_{rm L} = frac{1}{2 pi tau_{rm L}}. A value of g > 0 leads to gain narrowing, whereas g < 0 leads to absorption broadening of the spectral linewidth. The Q-factor is : Q_{rm L} = 2 pi frac{W_{rm stored}(t)}{W_{rm lost}(t)} = 2 pi frac{varphi (t)}{-frac{1}{ u_L} frac{d}{dt} varphi (t)} = 2 pi u_L tau_{rm L} = frac{ u_L}{Delta u_{rm L}}. The coherence time and length are : tau_{rm L}^{rm coh} = frac{1}{c} ell_{rm L}^{rm coh} = 2 tau_{rm L}. =Spectral-coherence factor= The factor by which the photon-decay time is elongated by gain or shortened by absorption is introduced here as the spectral-coherence factor Lambda : : Lambda := frac{1}{1 - cg tau_{rm c}}. All five spectral-coherence parameters then scale by the same spectral- coherence factor Lambda : : tau_{rm L} = Lambda tau_{rm c}, (Delta u_{rm L})^{-1} = Lambda (Delta u_{rm c})^{-1}, Q_{rm L} = Lambda Q_{rm c}, tau_{rm L}^{rm coh} = Lambda tau_{rm c}^{rm coh}, ell_{rm L}^{rm coh} = Lambda ell_{rm c}^{rm coh}. =Lasing resonator mode: Fundamental laser linewidth= With the number varphi of photons propagating inside the lasing resonator mode, the stimulated-emission and photon-decay rates are, respectively, : R_{rm st} = cg varphi, : R_{rm decay} = frac{1}{tau_{rm c}} varphi. The spectral-coherence factor then becomes : Lambda = frac{R_{rm decay}}{R_{rm decay} - R_{rm st}}. The photon-decay time of the lasing resonator mode is : tau_{rm L} = Lambda tau_{rm c} = frac{R_{rm decay}}{R_{rm decay} - R_{rm st}} tau_{rm c}. The fundamental laser linewidth is : Delta u_{rm L} = frac{1}{Lambda} Delta u_{rm c} = frac{R_{rm decay} - R_{rm st}}{R_{rm decay}} Delta u_{rm c}. This fundamental linewidth is valid for lasers with an arbitrary energy-level system, operating below, at, or above threshold, with the gain being smaller, equal, or larger compared to the losses, and in a cw or a transient lasing regime. It becomes clear from its derivation that the fundamental laser linewidth is due to the semi-classical effect that the gain elongates the photon-decay time. =Continuous-wave laser: The gain is smaller than the losses= The spontaneous-emission rate into the lasing resonator mode is given by : R_{rm sp} = c sigma_{rm e} N_{2}. Notably, R_{rm sp} is always a positive rate, because one atomic excitation is converted into one photon in the lasing mode. It is the source term of laser radiation and must not be misinterpreted as \\"noise\\". The photon-rate equation for a single lasing mode reads : frac{d}{dt} varphi = R_{rm sp} + R_{rm st} - R_{rm decay} = c sigma_{rm e} N_{2} + cg varphi - frac{1}{tau_{rm c}} varphi. A CW laser is defined by a temporally constant number of photons in the lasing mode, hence d varphi / dt = 0 . In a CW laser the stimulated- and spontaneous-emission rates together compensate the photon-decay rate. Consequently, : R_{rm st} - R_{rm decay} = -R_{rm sp} < 0. The stimulated-emission rate is smaller than the photon-decay rate or, colloquially, \\"the gain is smaller than the losses\\". This fact has been known for decades and exploited to quantify the threshold behavior of semiconductor lasers.Siegman, A. E. (1986) \\"Lasers\\", University Science Books, Mill Valley, California, ch. 13, pp. 510-524. Even far above laser threshold the gain is still a tiny bit smaller than the losses. It is exactly this small difference that induces the finite linewidth of a CW laser. It becomes clear from this derivation that fundamentally the laser is an amplifier of spontaneous emission, and the cw laser linewidth is due to the semi-classical effect that the gain is smaller than the losses. Also in the quantum-optical approaches to the laser linewidth,Sargent III, M.; Scully, M. O.; Lamb, Jr., W. E. (1993) \\"Laser Physics\\", 6th edition, Westview Press, Ch. 17. based on the density- operator master equation, it can be verified that the gain is smaller than the losses. =Schawlow-Townes approximation= As mentioned above, it is clear from its historical derivation that the original Schawlow-Townes equation is a four-fold approximation of the fundamental laser linewidth. Starting from the fundamental laser linewidth Delta u_{rm L} derived above, by applying the four approximations (i)-(iv) one then obtains the original Schawlow-Townes equation. (i) It is a true CW laser, hence : R_{rm decay} - R_{rm st} = R_{rm sp} Rightarrow : Delta u_{rm L} = frac{1}{Lambda} Delta u_{rm c} = frac{R_{rm decay} - R_{rm st}}{R_{rm decay}} Delta u_{rm c} = frac{R_{rm sp}}{R_{rm decay}} Delta u_{rm c}. (ii) It is a true four-level laser, hence : N_{1} = 0 Rightarrow cg = c (sigma_{rm e} N_{2} - sigma_{rm a} N_{1}) = c sigma_{rm e} N_{2} = R_{rm sp} Rightarrow : Delta u_{rm L} = frac{R_{rm sp}}{R_{rm decay}} Delta u_{rm c} = frac{cg}{frac{1}{tau_{rm c}} varphi} Delta u_{rm c}. (iii) It has no intrinsic resonator losses, hence : frac{1}{tau_{rm loss}} = 0 Rightarrow frac{1}{tau_{rm c}} = frac{1}{tau_{rm out}} Rightarrow P_{rm out} = h u_{rm L} frac{1}{tau_{rm out}} varphi = h u_{rm L} frac{1}{tau_{rm c}} varphi Rightarrow : Delta u_{rm L} = frac{cg}{frac{1}{tau_{rm c}} varphi} Delta u_{rm c} = frac{cg h u_{rm L}}{P_{rm out}} Delta u_{rm c}. (iv) One photon is coupled into the lasing mode by spontaneous emission during the photon-decay time tau_{rm c} , which would happen exactly at the unreachable point of an ideal four-level CW laser with infinite spectral-coherence factor Lambda , photon number varphi , and output power P_{rm out} , where the gain would equal the losses, hence : R_{rm st} = R_{rm decay} Rightarrow R_{rm sp} = cg = frac{1}{tau_{rm c}} = 2 pi Delta u_{rm c} Rightarrow : Delta u_{rm L} = frac{cg h u_{rm L}}{P_{rm out}} Delta u_{rm c} = frac{2 pi h u_{rm L} (Delta u_{rm c})^{2}}{P_{rm out}} = Delta u_{rm L,ST}. I.e., by applying the same four approximations (i)-(iv) to the fundamental laser linewidth Delta u_{rm L} that were applied in the first derivation, the original Schawlow-Townes equation is obtained. Thus, the fundamental laser linewidth is : Delta u_{rm L} = frac{1}{Lambda} Delta u_{rm c} = frac{R_{rm decay} - R_{rm st}}{R_{rm decay}} Delta u_{rm c} = (1 - cg tau_{rm c}) Delta u_{rm c} = Delta u_{rm c} - frac{cg}{2 pi}, whereas the original Schawlow-Townes equation is a four- fold approximation of this fundamental laser linewidth and is merely of historical interest. =Additional linewidth broadening and narrowing effects= Following its publication in 1958, the original Schawlow-Townes equation was extended in various ways. These extended equations often trade under the same name, the ‚ÄúSchawlow-Townes linewidth‚Äù, thereby creating a veritable confusion in the available literature on the laser linewidth, as it is often unclear which particular extension of the original Schawlow-Townes equation the respective authors refer to. Several semi-classical extensions intended to remove one or several of the approximations (i)-(iv) mentioned above, thereby making steps towards the fundamental laser linewidth derived above. The following extensions may add to the fundamental laser linewidth: (a) Hempstead and Lax, as well as Haken,Haken, H. (1970) \\"Laser Theory\\", Vol. XXV/2c of Encyclopedia of Physics, Springer. predicted quantum-mechanically an additional linewidth narrowing by a factor of two near laser threshold. However, such an effect was observed experimentally only in a handful of cases. (b) Petermann derived semi-classically a previously experimentally observed linewidth-broadening effect in gain-guided compared to index-guided semiconductor waveguide lasers. Siegman later showed that this effect is due to the non-orthogonality of transverse modes. Woerdman and co-workers extended this idea to longitudinal modes and polarization modes. As a result, the so- called \\"Petermann K-factor\\" is sometimes added to the laser linewidth. (c) Henry predicted quantum-mechanically an additional linewidth broadening due to refractive-index changes related to electron-hole-pair excitation, which induce phase changes. As a result, the so-called \\"Henry's alpha -factor\\" is sometimes added to the laser linewidth. Measurement of laser linewidth One of the first methods used to measure the coherence of a laser was interferometry.O. S. Heavens, Optical Masers (Wiley, New York, 1963). A typical method to measure the laser linewidth is self-heterodyne interferometry. An alternative approach is the use of spectrometry. Continuous lasers The laser linewidth in a typical single-transverse-mode He-Ne laser (at a wavelength of 632.8 nm), in the absence of intracavity line narrowing optics, can be on the order of 1 GHz. Rare-earth-doped dielectric- based or semiconductor-based distributed-feedback lasers have typical linewidths on the order of 1 kHz. The laser linewidth from stabilized low- power continuous-wave lasers can be very narrow and reach down to less than 1 kHz.L. W. Hollberg, CW dye lasers, in Dye Laser Principles, F. J. Duarte and L. W. Hillman (eds.) (Academic, New York, 1990) Chapter 5. Observed linewidths are larger than the fundamental laser linewidth due to technical noise (temporal fluctuations of the optical pump power or pump current, mechanical vibrations, refractive-index and length changes due to temperature fluctuations, etc.). Pulsed lasers Laser linewidth from high-power, high- gain pulsed-lasers, in the absence of intracavity line narrowing optics, can be quite broad and in the case of powerful broadband dye lasers it can range from a few nm wide to as broad as 10 nm. Laser linewidth from high-power high- gain pulsed laser oscillators, comprising line narrowing optics, is a function of the geometrical and dispersive features of the laser cavity.F. J. Duarte,Tunable Laser Optics, 2nd Edition (CRC, New York, 2015). To a first approximation the laser linewidth, in an optimized cavity, is directly proportional to the beam divergence of the emission multiplied by the inverse of the overall intracavity dispersion. That is, : Deltalambda approx Delta theta left({partialThetaoverpartiallambda}right)^{-1} This is known as the cavity linewidth equation where Delta theta is the beam divergence and the term in parenthesis (elevated to ‚Äì1) is the overall intracavity dispersion. This equation was originally derived from classical optics.J. K. Robertson, Introduction to Optics: Geometrical and Physical (Van Nostrand, New York, 1955). However, in 1992 Duarte derived this equation from quantum interferometric principles, thus linking a quantum expression with the overall intracavity angular dispersion. An optimized multiple-prism grating laser oscillator can deliver pulse emission in the kW regime at single-longitudinal- mode linewidths of Delta u ‚âà 350 MHz (equivalent to Delta lambda ‚âà 0.0004 nm at a laser wavelength of 590 nm). Since the pulse duration from these oscillators is about 3 ns, the laser linewidth performance is near the limit allowed by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

The sculpture is carved from 2,500 pounds of Indiana limestone and bronze. It consists of one solid form and measures about 75\\" x 36\\". Chrysalis was installed in the entrance of the Marion Chester Read Center in October 1990. Description Chrysalis was commissioned by the Charles and Margaret Lescrenier family for the Girl Scouts headquarters at the entrance of the Marion Chester Read Center. The artwork is an abstract, organic shape carved out of 2,500 pounds of Indiana limestone and bronze. The stone has a linear texture carved into it and the bronze tendrils are done by the lost-wax process and bonded to the stone. The base of the sculpture is made out of concrete. Historical information Chrysalis is located in the entrance of the Marion Chester Read Center. Marion Chester Read pays tribute to the legacy of the Chester Read family, and more specifically, Marion, who continues to inspire others by her support of the Girl Scouting and the Girl Scouts of Wisconsin Southeast. 1921, Alice Chester, a community activist and philanthropist, became the first president of the local organization. She decided that the young women in Girl scouts needed a permanent summer camp. In turn, she bought a 125-acre site, which was later on given her name. 1987, a new headquarters building for the Girl Scouts of the Milwaukee Area was completed and is managed by descendants of Alice Chester. After the Center was completed, employees of Gammex Inc. offered support for a sculpture to be placed in the front of the building. Along with the patronage from the Charles and Margaret Lescrenier family, a $15,000 commission for a sculpture was offered. This is when Ms. Beth Sahagian learned of the commission and submitted drawings and a model to the patrons of the Girl Scout officials. Beth Sahagian chose to invoke a feeling of growth and change by creating an abstraction of a natural cocoon form. The materials she used, Indiana limestone and bronze, contrasted with the simplicity of the form. The linear texture carved into the sculpture gives variation and texture to the surface, and the bronze tendrils that are bonded to the stone are done so to give the artwork a feeling of growth and evolution. Chrysalis has a nearby plaque that reads: CHRYSALIS/A GIFT TO/GIRL SCOUTS OF MILWAUKEE AREA/FROM THE/CHARLES & MARGARET LESCRENIER FAMILY/ARTIST: BETH SAHAGIAN/(logo) 1990.. She collaborated with other artists from the Hartbronze Inc. foundry to complete and transport the work to its location. =Acquisition= The work cost roughly $15,000 and was funded by the Charles and Margaret Lescrenier family. Artist Beth Sahagian grew up as the daughter of a pattern maker and trained Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design from 1977 to 1981. She studied sculpture under Joe Mendla, the co-founder of Hartbronze Inc. In the 1980s, she did independent study at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and later on travel and sculpture study in museums and galleries in Europe. She is currently and has been for the past several years, an employee of Hartbronze where she developed her sculpture skills. In 1985, under the guidance of Paolo Grassi and Associates in Carrara, Italy, she created stone sculptures which cemented her resolve to make. Sahagian has other public sculptures in Wisconsin, Earth Flight (1988), at the north entrance of the Clinical Science Center at the University Hospital in Madison; and Current Mode I and II for Wisconsin Electric Power Company's downtown Milwaukee Annex. Sahagian has received numerous awards and participated in national and international exhibitions. She is also represented by a variety of regional galleries.Buck, Diane M. and Virginia A. Palmer.

He was born in Saint-Quentin, Aisne. After completing secondary studies at the Coll√®ge de la Providence in Amiens, he studied under the Jesuits at Saint-Dizier. He began writing in 1907, occasionally using the pseudonym Jean de l'Escritoire. Billy used ecclesiastical settings for the novels B√©noni, L'Approbaniste, Intro√Øbo, and Le Narthex. He was inspired by the story-tellers of the 18th century for La Femme maquill√©e, L'Amie des hommes, Quel homme es-tu? and the essay Pudeur. For many years he was the literary critic for L'≈íuvre. He edited the collection Leurs Raisons. Billy became honorary president of the Soci√©t√© des amis de Phil√©as Lebesgue. Retiring to Lyon during the Occupation of France, he worked on a series of imposing biographies: Vie de Balzac, Vie de Diderot, and Vie de Sainte-Beuve. He was elected to the Acad√©mie Goncourt in 1943, but could not take his seat until 1944 because of the hostility of several members, some of whom he had criticised in his writings. After the War, he wrote the Chroniques du samedi for Le Figaro litt√©raire. The collection Histoire de la vie litt√©raire (√©ditions Tallandier) was published under the direction of Andr√© Billy, who contributed L'√âpoque 1900.

It was designed to minimize the use of materials in general and plastics and threaded fasteners in particular in order to minimize cost. The Society of Automotive Engineers of Japan named the Choinori as one of the 240 Landmarks of Japanese Automotive Technology. Concept and design The Choinori was designed to be a short distance scooter for commuting and running errands. The name \\"choinori\\" is derived from \\"tohnori\\" the Japanese term for a long-distance touring motorcycle. \\"Toh nori\\" means \\"long ride\\", \\"choi nori\\" is the opposite, meaning \\"short ride\\", or \\"short hop\\". The Choinori was designed to minimize the use of materials, especially plastic parts and nuts and bolts. A new 49 cc pushrod OHV engine was designed for the Choinori. The aluminium engine had a linerless bore that was plated by a newly developed high-speed plating process, reducing both cost and weight. Another feature to reduce cost and weight was the lack of a rear suspension, with the rear axle being bolted directly to the frame. The minimalist design allowed the Choinori to be sold at an extremely low price, with the basic version advertised at a lower price than Suzuki's contemporary electric bicycle. Developments and end of production The Choinori engine was found to have a design problem with the cam followers, this was solved by redesigning the cam followers. In 2004, the Choinori SS was introduced. Mechanically the same as the regular Choinori, the SS had the leg shield replaced by a headstock cover, a different style of handlebar was used, and the turn signals were moved to the handlebars. Production of the Choinori was moved from Japan to Taiwan in 2005, and was discontinued in 2007 when the engine could not meet new emission standards. More than ten million were built.

Early 18th Century French Music - A Woman's Role Women were generally trained in opera in Paris during the Early 18th Century. Ballet and opera were on the rise during this period of time in Paris. Additionally, the Baroque era attracted patrons because of its elaborate and lush arrangements as well as the presence of the organ. During the 17th and 18th centuries, there was an increase in public secular music making as well as opportunities for woman not tied directly to the church. Women began to appear in public performances often subbing for males on organ and harpsichord if they possessed the lineage and privilege to do so. Women were often seen as pianists, vocalists, harpists, organists, and harpsichord players. It would have been rare for a women composer to publicly display violin performance such as √âlisabeth de Haulteterre.https://www.britannica.com/biography/Elisabeth-Claude-Jacquet-de- la-Guerre Participation in Le Concert Spirituel Le Concert Spirituel was the most prolific concert giving society in 18th century Paris founded by Anne Danican Philidor.https://www.britannica.com/topic/Le-Concert-Spirituel Le Concert Spirituel was founded in 1725 and served as instrumental and choral performances at Salle de Swisses of the Tulieres Palace during lent and on other religious holidays when the opera was closed.

A satirical response to the German Wirtschaftswunder, the story examines the relationship between the generations in post-war Germany and the country's post-war surge in religious belief. Synopsis The Murke of the title is a psychology graduate whose first job is as editor for the Cultural Department at Broadcasting House. Everything about the place irritates him: \\"The rugs were impressive, the corridors were impressive, the furniture was impressive, and the pictures were in excellent taste.\\" He takes out a little card his mother has sent him, with a picture of the Sacred Heart and I prayed for you at St. James's Church (Ich betete f√ªr Dich in Sankt Jacobi), and sticks it in one of the corridors behind an assistant producer's door frame.; for the German, . Murke begins his days with a \\"panic-breakfast\\" (\\"Angstfr√ºhst√ºck\\") by riding the paternoster lift to the empty space at the top for a brief dose of terror that it might get stuck.; . He has started collecting discarded tape‚Äîtape containing silence, where the speaker has paused‚Äîwhich he splices together and takes home to listen to in the evening. Soon he advances to recording his girlfriend sitting silently in front of a microphone. The story centres on Murke's editing of two radio lectures on The Nature of Art by the prominent cultural critic Professor Bur-Malottke, author of \\"numerous books of a belletristic-philosophical- religious and art-historical nature\\". Looking at Bur-Malottke, Murke \\"suddenly knew the meaning of hatred\\": > [H]e hated this great fat, handsome creature whose books‚Äîtwo million three > hundred and fifty thousand copies of them‚Äîlay around in libraries, > bookstores, bookshelves, and bookcases, and not for one second did he dream > of suppressing this hatred. Bur-Malottke had converted to Catholicism in 1945, the high point of post-war German guilt, but overnight, or so he said, has had second thoughts about his Nature of Art tapes, fearing he \\"might be blamed for contributing to the religious overtones in radio\\". The tapes contain the word \\"God\\" 27 times, and Bur-Malottke wants them changed to \\"that higher Being Whom we revere\\" (jenes h√∂here Wesen, das wir verehren\\"), a phrase more consistent with his pre- conversion beliefs. Rather than have him re-record the talk, he asks that the technicians record the new words, then splice them in instead of \\"God\\". The editing is complicated by the need to record different cases‚Äîten nominatives, five accusatives (that is, fifteen \\"jenes h√∂here Wesens, das wir verehren\\"), five datives (\\"jenem h√∂heren Wesen, das wir verehren\\"), seven genitives (\\"jenes h√∂heren Wesens, das wir verehren\\"), and one vocative (\\"O du h√∂heres Wesen, das wir verehren!\\")‚Äîmuch to Bur-Malottke's irritation and Murke's amusement. Half a minute will have to be cut from each Nature of Art lecture to accommodate the extra words. \\"It was clear that Bur-Malottke had not thought of these complications; he began to sweat, the grammatical transposition bothered him.\\" > Bur-Malottke pursed his lips toward the muzzle of the mike as if he wanted > to kiss it, sweat ran down his face, and through the glass Murke observed > with cold detachment the agony that Bur-Malottke was enduring; then he > suddenly switched Bur-Malottke off, stopping the moving tape that was > recording Bur-Malottke's words and feasted his eyes on the spectacle of Bur- > Malottke behind the glass, soundless, like a fat, handsome fish. He switched > on his microphone and his voice came quietly into the studio, \\"I'm sorry, > but our tape is defective, and I must ask you to begin again at the > beginning, with the nominatives.\\" Heinrich B√∂ll, 1983 Bur-Malottke approaches the director afterwards to ask that the station review all the tapes he has recorded since 1945: \\"I cannot bear the thought that after my death, tapes may be run off on which I say things I no longer believe. Particularly in some of my political utterances, during the fervor of 1945 ...\\" Murke's boss congratulates Murke for having been able to sit through Bur-Malottke's lectures. The boss once had to listen three times to a four-hour Hitler speech. When he began, he was still a Nazi and by the time he'd finished he wasn't: \\"a drastic cure ... but very effective\\". A technician gives 12 of Bur-Malottke's \\"Gods\\" to an assistant producer who is editing a play about an atheist whose questions are answered by silence: \\"Atheist (louder still): 'And who will remember me when I have turned into leaves?' (Silence).\\" The producer wishes he had a voice saying \\"God\\" at those points, and is amazed when the technician hands him Murke's tin of \\"Gods\\" (\\"you really are a godsend\\"). The technician decides to keep the producer's spare silences for Murke's collection. There had been no silences at all in Bur-Malottke's Nature of Art lectures. The story ends with the producer taking a crumpled piece of paper from his back pocket (\\"Funny, isn't it, the kitschy stuff you can find in this place?\\"), the card Murke had stuck in his door frame earlier that day: I prayed for you at St. James's Church. Themes The story is a satirical response to Germany's postwar Wirtschaftswunder. Mikko Keskinen, a professor of comparative literature, writes that Bur-Malottke's project of erasure stands for Germany's efforts to integrate citizens with a suspect past; Murke's collected silences stand in contrast to the \\"hollow words and inauthentic deeds\\" that surround him. That Germans were \\"dumbstruck\\" after the Holocaust was often the only possible response to it: \\"[O]ne could retreat from the word, and thus, at least momentarily, renounce the very tokens of humanity.\\" But the word can be used to defeat the hypocrisy: Murke's imposition of the rules of declension was able to \\"bring about a deterioration in the powers that be and a deviation in their articulatory authority\\". Keskinen links the story back to the final sentence of Ludwig Wittgenstein's Tractatus (1921): \\"Wovon man nicht sprechen kann, dar√ºber mu√ü man schweigen\\" (\\"Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.\\"); .

He was a Professor of English at Hamilton College.  Professional career  Scollard was born at Clinton, New York on September 28, 1860, son of James Isaac and Mary Elizabeth (Stevens) Scollard. He graduated from Hamilton College in 1881, and later attended Harvard University, where his friends included poets Bliss Carman and Frank Dempster Sherman. At Hamilton, where he was a member of the Chi Psi fraternity, he played varsity baseball and is credited with introducing the curveball to college baseball. After a period in Cambridge, Massachusetts, he spent a year at University of Cambridge in England. In 1888 he became an Associate Professor of English at Hamilton College, where he remained until 1896. Except for a further year in the English Department at Hamilton College in 1911, he devoted the rest of his life to creative writing.

He is probably best known for his television shows and specials over a period of almost thirty years. Como came to television in 1948 when his radio show was selected by NBC for experimental television broadcasts. His television programs were seen in more than a dozen countries, making Como a familiar presence outside of the United States and Canada. He received five Emmys from 1955 to 1959, a Christopher Award (1956) and shared a Peabody Award with good friend Jackie Gleason in the same year. Como was inducted into the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Hall of Fame in 1990 and received a Kennedy Center Honor in 1987. Como has the distinction of having three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work in radio, television, and music. Radio Perry Como began performing on radio in 1936 when he became a member of the Ted Weems Orchestra. The band had its own weekly radio show on the Mutual Broadcasting System from 1936 to 1937. They were also part of the regularly featured cast of Fibber McGee and Molly. Ted Weems and his Orchestra were cast members for the first season of the radio show Beat the Band, which was a musical quiz show; they were weekly performers from 1940 ‚Äì 1941. Como left the Ted Weems Orchestra for his home in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania with the intention of returning to his trade as a barber in late 1942. Before he could sign a lease for a barber shop, Como was offered an opportunity to host his own sustaining (non-sponsored) radio show on CBS from New York City. He began working for CBS March 12, 1943. Doug Storer, then an advertising executive with the Blackman Company, was a listener of Como's CBS radio show. Storer believed Como's ability and style would be ideal for a new radio variety program he was planning. He created an audition recording of the proposed program with Como and the Mitchell Ayres Orchestra and brought it to the advertising agency that handled the Chesterfield cigarettes account. The agency liked the concept of the radio show, but had someone else in mind as its host. The singer of their choice was under contract with someone else, so the agency asked Storer to obtain a release from his contract for their new program. Storer believed that Perry Como was the right host for the new radio show and did not do anything about the singer's release from his contract. Weeks later, he received a call from Chesterfield's advertising agency, asking about the status of the singer's contract, since the show was scheduled to begin on NBC in about one week. Storer told the agency that the right person for their new program was the man on the audition recording. The agency had no time to spare and agreed to sign Perry Como. At the end of 1944, Como became the host of The Chesterfield Supper Club. Chesterfield Supper Club radio audience ticket, February 6, 1946. The Chesterfield Supper Club had a main theme song, \\"Smoke Dreams\\", composed by John Klenner, Lloyd Shaffer and Ted Steele. Another musical theme that was also used on the broadcasts was Roy Ringwald's \\"A Cigarette, Sweet Music and You\\". These themes were also used when the Chesterfield Supper Club television shows began in 1948. Como was joined by Jo Stafford in 1946, with Perry hosting the 15 minute program on Monday, Wednesday and Friday evenings. By 1948, Peggy Lee and the Fontane Sisters had joined the cast, with the Fontane Sisters moving to television with Como. The radio show continued and was simulcast after the \\"Supper Club\\" television broadcasts began; Como was heard on radio until he left NBC in 1950 for CBS with The Perry Como Chesterfield Show. Mutual began simulcasting his CBS television show on radio in 1953; it was the first instance of a simulcast between two different networks. The radio show continued until June 1955, when Como left CBS to return to NBC. Como did not return to a regularly broadcast radio program until 1989 when he began a syndicated radio show co-hosted with John Knox called Weekend With Perry. He continued with this program until his death in 2001. =Radio shows= As host or cast member * Columbia Presents Como (1943) (host) * The Perry Como Chesterfield Supper Club (1944‚Äì1950) (host) * The Perry Como Chesterfield Show (1950‚Äì1955) (host) * Ted Weems and his Orchestra (1936‚Äì1937) as part of the Ted Weems Orchestra * Fibber McGee and Molly (1937) as part of the Ted Weems Orchestraaudio file of Perry Como with Ted Weems Orchestra singing \\"Cabin of Dreams\\" on the \\"Fibber McGee & Molly\\" show on NBC October 11, 1937 (RealPlayer) * Beat the Band (1940‚Äì1941) as part of the Ted Weems Orchestra * Weekend With Perry (1989‚Äì2001) (host) As a guest With Arthur Godfrey as a guest on Bing Crosby's radio show, 1950. * For The Record‚ÄîJuly 31, 1944 * Bill Stern‚ÄîJune 20, 1946 * The Bing Crosby Chesterfield Show (1949‚Äì1952)--April 5, 1950, May 24, 1950 (with Bob Hope) * The Big Show (1950-1952)--November 19, 1950 * Recollect At 30‚ÄîFebruary 20, 1957 * Ted Lewis‚Äîfrom San Francisco-date unknown * Guard Session‚Äîdates unknown * Pop Chronicles the 40s‚Äî1972 Television Como and Ginger Rogers at the show's rehearsal, 1957. Como's television career began when NBC decided to experiment with televising his Chesterfield Supper Club radio show on December 24, 1948. The cameras were simply brought into the radio studio to televise the radio broadcast of the show. NBC initially planned to televise three Friday evening \\"Supper Club\\" radio shows; the network was pleased enough with the results that the experimental period was extended into August 1949. Como admitted that he felt awkward and unsure at first, but was able to relax enough to perform on the television show in the same manner as he did for normal radio broadcasts. On September 8, 1949, Chesterfield Supper Club became an officially scheduled television program airing on Sunday nights for a half- hour. Perry and his sponsor moved to CBS in 1950; the show was re-titled The Perry Como Chesterfield Show and the schedule returned to one similar to the \\"Supper Club\\" radio shows: a 15-minute program three times a week. J. Fred Muggs, who rose to fame on the NBC Today show, made his debut on Perry Como's CBS program. Pat Weaver of Today saw the baby chimp on the show and thought he would be able to help his still-floundering morning program. NBC offered Como a long-term contract to host a weekly hour-long television show that would beginning in the fall of 1955. Como signed a 12-year contract with the network in April 1955. The Perry Como Show made its debut September 17, 1955, with the following announcement from announcer Frank Gallop: \\"We assume everyone can read, so we will not shout at you.\\" Initially, only Gallop's voice was heard because there was not enough room for him to appear onstage.Retrieved 10 June 2010 Clad in his well-known cardigan sweaters, Como welcomed guest stars to his musical-comedy variety program. The \\"Sing to me, Mr. C.\\" segment of the show was where Como responded to letters of viewer song requests. Como was seated on a stool as he sang some of the music of the weekly requests. The setting for this segment had its beginnings in the first television broadcasts of the Chesterfield Supper Club. Como and his guests did the radio show sitting on stools behind music stands; this is what was seen by the cameras when they initially came into the radio studio. The opening theme song for Como's shows from 1955-1963 was \\"Dream Along with Me (I'm On My Way to a Star)\\". The closing theme was \\"You Are Never Far Away From Me\\". \\"We Get Letters\\", composed by Ray Charles, was the musical beginning of the \\"Sing to me, Mr. C.\\" segment of Como's weekly shows. It was revived by the Late Show with David Letterman. The Perry Como Show was rated as number seven in the Nielsen top ten after it had been on the air for two months.(subscription required) The program became one of the first color television programs with its 1956 season premiere; it was also the only NBC television show in the Nielsen top ten for the 1956‚Äì1957 season. During this time, a ratings war developed between the Como show and that of entertainer Jackie Gleason. Off- screen, Gleason and Como were long-time friends; Como had been one of those who filled in for Gleason in 1954, when he suffered a broken leg and ankle in an on-air fall. While both men were eager to win, neither wanted to do so at all costs. They kept their friendship intact with phone calls the day after the show; the winner of the weekly ratings battle phoned the loser for some good-natured joking. Elroy Face and Hal Smith of the Pittsburgh Pirates with Perry Como and Casey Stengel of the New York Yankees rehearsing for a Kraft Music Hall appearance, 1960 Kraft Foods had been the sponsor of a long- running radio program called Kraft Music Hall. The company decided to develop the show for television in 1958, hosted by Milton Berle. Kraft approached Perry Como regarding becoming the program's new host in early 1959. Como signed what was then a record-breaking deal with Kraft, receiving $25 million to host the show for the next two years with another contract to serve as the company's spokesman for the next seven years. The agreement also put Como in charge of his television show's production, as well as for the shows replacing it during the summer hiatus. Como's production company, Roncom, named for his son, Ronnie Como, handled the transactions. Como also had control of the show which would replace his during the summer television hiatus. Como then moved from Saturday evenings to Wednesday evenings with Perry Como's Kraft Music Hall. Como, who had done a regularly scheduled television show since 1948, began taking a slower pace by the fall of 1963. From 1963 to 1967, he only appeared on television in seven specials per season. The Como show was rotated with three other Kraft-sponsored programs: Kraft Suspense Theatre, The Andy Williams Show, and The Road West. After 1967, his television appearances mainly came in the form of specials at holidays, especially Christmas. Como actually began doing specials in 1960 while he was still hosting Kraft Music Hall. Perry Como Comes To London was the first of these programs which would eventually span over twenty-five years. He continued with the television specials, which were filmed in countries like Austria, France, Mexico and the United States until 1987, when an angry Como canceled the Christmas special after being offered a 10 pm late-prime time slot, outside the family hour, by ABC. Como's final Christmas special, Perry Como's Irish Christmas, was seen on PBS in 1994. =Television shows= Regularly scheduled television shows * The Perry Como Chesterfield Supper Club (1948‚Äì1950). * The Perry Como Chesterfield Show (1950‚Äì1955) * The Perry Como Show (1955‚Äì1959) * Perry Como's Kraft Music Hall (1959‚Äì1967) =Television specials= * Perry Como Comes To London (1960) * The Perry Como Holiday Special (1967) * Perry Como Special - In Hollywood (1968) * Academy of Professional Sports Awards (February 21, 1969) * Christmas At The Hollywood Palace (1969) * The Many Moods Of Perry Como (1970) * Perry Como - In Person (1971) * Perry Como's Winter Show (1971) * The Perry Como Winter Show (1972) * Cole Porter in Paris (1973) * The Perry Como Winter Show (1973) * The Perry Como Sunshine Show (1974) * Perry Como's Summer of '74 (1974) * Perry Como's Christmas Show (1974) * Como Country: Perry And His Nashville Friends (1975) * Perry Como's Springtime Special (1975) * Perry Como's Lake Tahoe Holiday (1975) * Perry Como's Christmas in Mexico (1975) * Perry Como's Hawaiian Holiday (1976) * Perry Como's Spring in New Orleans (1976) * Perry Como: Las Vegas Style (1976) * Perry Como's Christmas in Austria (1976) * Perry Como's Music From Hollywood (1977) * Perry Como's Olde Englishe Christmas (1977) * Perry Como's Easter by the Sea (1978) * Perry Como's Early American Christmas (1978) * Perry Como's Springtime Special (1979) * Perry Como's Christmas in New Mexico (1979) * Perry Como's Bahamas Holiday (1980) * Perry Como's Christmas in the Holy Land (1980) * Perry Como's Spring in San Francisco (1981) * Perry Como's French-Canadian Christmas (1981) * Perry Como's Easter in Guadalajara (1982) * Perry Como's Christmas in Paris (1982) * Perry Como's Christmas in New York (1983) * Perry Como's Christmas in England (1984) * Perry Como's Christmas in Hawaii (1985) * The Perry Como Christmas Special (1986) * Perry Como in Japan (March 1993-Japanese TV) * Perry Como's Irish Christmas (1994) =Guest appearances= * The Frank Sinatra Show (March 10, 1951) * Texaco Star Theater (December 27, 1949), (January 9, 1951), (January 16, 1951) * Arthur Godfrey and His Friends (March 29, 1950), (April 5, 1950) * Treasury Open House (June 2, 1950) * The Frank Sinatra Show (October 19, 1951) * The U.

Perry Como was signed to a seven-year 20th Century-Fox contract in 1943, prior to his becoming the host of the Chesterfield Supper Club. Como wound up in a stock company, where actors were called for work only if the studio needed to make a film to complete a schedule. For the filming of Something for the Boys in 1944, Como was told to report immediately to the Fox Studio Hollywood lot. It was five weeks from Como's arrival to his being called onto the set. When he came on the movie set, the director did not know who he was. Como made five feature films, but felt that his roles and his personality were a poor match. He expressed his discomfort with the medium, saying in 1949, \\"Television is going to do me a lot more personal good than the movies ever have...The reason should be obvious. On television, I'm allowed to be myself; in pictures, I was always some other guy. I come over like just another bum in a tuxedo.\\" Though his last movie, Words and Music, was produced by prestigious Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer, the change was of little help. Shortly before the film's debut, columnist Walter Winchell reported the following in his column: \\"Someone at MGM must have been dozing when they wrote the script for Words and Music. In most of the film Perry Como is called Eddie Anders and toward the end (for no reason) they start calling him Perry Como.\\" Como then asked for and received a release from the remainder of his MGM contract, saying, \\"I was wasting their time and they were wasting mine.\\". =Films= Including shorts * Swing, Sister, Swing (1938) with the Ted Weems Orchestra * Swing Frolic (1942) with the Ted Weems Orchestra * Upbeat in Music (1943) * Something for the Boys (1944) * Doll Face (1945) \\"Perry Como and Martha Stewart sing \\"Hubba, Hubba, Hubba\\" in this clip from the movie-YouTube * March of Time (1945) * If I'm Lucky (1946) * Words and Music (1948) * Tobaccoland on Parade (1950) * The Fifth Freedom (1951).

However Russell Baillie of the New Zealand Herald praised the film giving it 4 out of 5, calling it an \\"endearingly funny, if sugar-coated local romantic comedy.\\" Graeme Tuckett of the Dominion Post also gave the film 4 out of 5 saying: \\"Love Birds does what it does just fine. There is Queen on the soundtrack, love in the air, and quite probably a smile on your face as the credits roll.\\" Despite the film's overall mixed reviews, Rhys Darby received an overwhelmingly positive reception with reviewers quoted as saying; \\"Rhys Darby steals the show again, but in a very different role to what we are used to seeing him play. He plays the relatively straight role of a typical Kiwi bloke, but there is no hiding the charm and likeability he brings to the big screen.\\" and \\"He's an affable, believable and extremely convincing lead - and based on this alone, he's destined for even greater things.\\" Notes This film contains music from the rock band Queen, including the theme from Highlander: The Series.

It is a white solid or oily liquid with a sharp odor. Since the pure material poses an explosion hazard, it is often used as a solution, e.g., in dimethyl phthalate as a solvent. Preparation Diacetyl peroxide forms upon combining hydrogen peroxide and excess acetic anhydride. Peracetic acid is an intermediate. Safety  Organic peroxides are typically explosive since they contain both the oxidizer, the O-O bond, and reducing agents, the C-C and C-H bonds. It is shock sensitive and explosive. The threshold quantity for Process Safety Management per Occupational Safety and Health Administration 1910.119 is if the concentration of the diacetyl peroxide solution is greater than 70%. There have been reports of detonation of the pure material. The 25% solution also has explosive potential. The crystalline peroxide is especially shock sensitive and a high explosion risk. Health hazards Contact with liquid causes irritation of eyes and skin. If ingested, irritates mouth and stomach.

It is located from Layyah, the headquarters of the Layyah District, on the Mianwali and Multan road (MM road). Chowk Azam has an estimated population of more than 150,000 people. The city has many educational and vocational institutions, including the Government Muslim High School, Divisional Public School, Government College for Boys and Government College for Girls. The campus of the Government College University Faisalabad and Bahauddin Zakariya University in Layyah provides point services for the commuting of Chowk Azam students and others who live in the vicinity. History Chowk Azam Minar According to popular legend, the history of Chowk Azam dates back to the 14th century, when a conflict between the ruling king of Afghanistan and his brother arose over the crown and throne. Taking with him a caravan of Muslim and Christian allies, the king's brother fled the country in the hope of receiving political asylum from the king of India. He brought his entire household, including courtesans, slaves, and cattle. Hearing of the exodus, the king of Afghanistan pursued the caravan with his armed forces. They attacked at the Sindharr clan's thatched house, which is said to have been located where Habib Bank Limited is today. The king's forces engulfed the departed caravan and slaughtered the men, women, children and cattle. It is claimed that the well in which they deposited the dismembered bodies of the dead was so full, blood gushed out of it, giving way to it being formally named \\"Khooni Chowk\\". Later, when Colonel Muhammad Azam arrived, he purchased the land. He built a mosque that is the central mosque of the city today; this led it to be named after Colonel Azam and called Chowk Azam. The city's inhabitants consist mainly of Punjabi, Saraiki, Pashtun, and Rohitky communities, with the majority being Punjabi. Punjabi people came to this region in the pre and post-partition era. Agricultural peasants migrated from upper and central Punjab, mainly from Sialkot, Gujrat, Gujranwala, Lahore, Faisalabad and Narowal, and settled in Chowk Azam to expand their businesses there. Chowk Azam, Pakistan is location at a latitude of 30.9706551 and a longitude of 71.212303.

He was born in the Tarzana neighborhood of Los Angeles and was raised in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles. He currently resides in Culver City, Los Angeles, California. Southern California Public Radio described him as \\"LA's big new electronica musician\\" in 2010. Previously signed with Anticon, he now releases music through his own label Basement's Basement. History Will Wiesenfeld is a classically trained musician, and began learning the piano at the age of four \\"to compete with his brother\\". By twelve he had \\"completely abandoned it,\\" but continual musical experimenting led him to record his first piece of music at age fourteen. He released a few projects, including an album entitled The Fabric, as his previous moniker, [Post-foetus]. He also ventured into a more ambient style with side-project Geotic, which Irish magazine State.ie called \\"gorgeous\\". Will Wiesenfeld derives his current alias from his childhood memory of taking in art and music by dwelling on it in his bathtub, which he claims he was very fond of. Baths released the debut album Cerulean under Anticon in 2010. He recorded the entire album in two months from his bedroom. It was listed by The A.V. Club as the 21st best album of 2010. It also made Pitchforks \\"Album of the Year: Honorable Mention\\" list. His third album, Obsidian, was released in May 2013. On March 6, 2014, during a concert in Hong Kong, Wiesenfeld unveiled one of his latest tracks from his EP \\"Ocean Death\\", released on May 6, 2014. On November 16, 2017, Baths released his fourth album, Romaplasm. On May 29, 2020, Baths released his fifth album, \\"Pop Music/ False B-Sides II.\\". Style The BBC's Mike Diver claims Baths' nearest musical soundalike is chillwave musician Toro y Moi. Drowned in Sound noted Baths' use of \\"unorthodox\\" sounds layered in and around the electronics, in particular \\"clicking pens, vocal samples, rustling blankets and scissor snaps\\". British newspaper The Guardians Paul Lester commented he was reminded of \\"J Dilla playing around with the Pavement and Prince catalogues\\" while listening to Cerulean.

They are intended to reduce response times for personnel deployed to assist with transnational criminal investigations, major events or emergency situations by waiving normal visa requirements. The travel documents consist of an e-Passport Booklet and an e-Identification Card identifying the holder as an Interpol officer, granting them special immigration status when travelling on official Interpol duties to participating member countries. The Interpol Travel Document initiative proposal was approved by Interpol's Executive Committee in March 2009 and was unanimously ratified by Interpol member countries at the 79th Interpol General Assembly in Doha in November 2010. Physical appearance The e-Passport Booklet contains 34 visa pages and a polycarbonate machine readable bio-data page. The cover is black with silver embossing on the front. The word \\"INTERPOL\\" in both Latin (INTERPOL) and Arabic () script appears at the top, with the Interpol logo below. The word for 'Passport' then follows in all four official Interpol languages: English (PASSPORT), French (PASSEPORT), Spanish (PASAPORTE), and Arabic (). The biometric passport symbol appears at the bottom of the cover. The bio-data page features the holder's name, date and place of birth, photograph and signature, their job title, the passport number, the issuer code \\"XPO\\", and its issue and expiry dates. A machine readable strip runs along the bottom of the page. The e-Identification Card is a light blue polycarbonate smartcard. The front features the Interpol logo overlaid with the holder's biographical data, photograph and signature, the document number and its expiry date. The reverse features the officer's job title, the card's issue date, the issuer code \\"XPO\\", and a machine readable strip. Technical features The Interpol travel documents were developed by the EDAPS Consortium and Entrust, Inc. The passport contains 29 security features including laser engraving and an electronic RFID chip storing the holder's biometric data, as well as holographic, micrographic, and optical security elements. Both travel documents meet the relevant ICAO/ISO standards and have been allocated the three-letter country code 'XPO'. The passports are produced in Kiev by EDAPS and can be printed and dispatched in less than two hours after an individual's personal data has been received. International recognition Each participating member country decides whether to recognise either the e-Passport Booklet and/or the e-Identification Card and whether they need be used in conjunction with or without a valid national passport. The holder is then granted visa exemption, expedited visa processing or some other special visa treatment depending on the individual arrangement.

The original 16th-century bridge was the oldest bridge in Vilnius. History The first bridge dated from 1536. It stood closer to the present-day Mindaugas Bridge. It was a wooden covered bridge with brick and stone piers. It had a second floor with apartments for toll collectors. Because its builder Ulryk Hozjusz wanted to recoup the cost by collecting tolls, Grand Duke Sigismund the Old granted him a privilege prohibiting others from building any other bridges between Kernavƒó and Bistrica (–ë—ã—Å—Ç—Ä—ã—Ü–∞ in Belarus) or to offer other crossing services between Verkiai and Paneriai. The bridge was burned by retreating Lithuanian Army commanded by Janusz Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç after the Battle of Vilnius (1655). A new project was planned in 1673, which envisioned a span of between piers ‚Äî the longest known span at the time. However, an early spring and ice jam destroyed the piers. Therefore, the old piers from the first bridge were reused and the second bridge was completed in 1679. In 1739 another wooden bridge was erected and painted green. Since then this crossing has been known as the Green Bridge. In 1789 a new plan for a brick bridge was prepared by Laurynas Guceviƒçius, but the builders selected another proposal. The construction was supervised by Marcin Knackfus. The project was not successful as the bridge burned in 1791. It was rebuilt according to a plan by Michael Schulz in 1805, but it was burned again on orders from Michael Andreas Barclay de Tolly during the French invasion of Russia of 1812. The bridge was rebuilt in 1827‚Äì1829. A steel bridge was designed by Nikolai Belelyubsky and completed in 1894. It survived World War I, but was blown up by the Wehrmacht in 1944. The present-day bridge was completed in 1952 and named after Soviet General Ivan Chernyakhovsky. After Lithuania's declaration of independence in 1990, the bridge was returned to its historical name. Sculptures The bridge long featured four sets of sculptures ‚Äì prominent examples of so-called Soviet realism. Each featured two people, representing social classes idealized by the Soviet authorities (soldiers, workers, farmers, students). Three sculptures were in height (including the pedestal); the soldiers reached due to the raised flag.

In a 1998 article, Christian Reus-Smit and Richard Price suggested that the rationalist‚Äìconstructivist debate was, or was about to become, the most significant in the discipline of international relations theory.Price, Richard. Reus-Smit, Christian (1998) 'Dangerous Liaisons? Critical International Relations Theory and Constructivism', Journal of International Relations, 4: 263 The debate can be seen as to be centered on preference formation, with rationalist theories (such as neorealism) characterising changes in terms of shifts in capabilities, whereas constructivists focus on preference formation.Glenn R. Chafetz, Michael Spirtas, Benjamin Frankel (1999) The Origins of National Interests, London: Frank Cass Publishers, p. 350 Rationalism Rationalists subscribe to positivism, the idea that scientific enquiry must rely upon empirical validation or falsification.Zehfuss, Maja (2002) Constructivism in International Relations: Politics of Reality, Cambridge, University of Cambridge Press, p. 3 Rationalist theories such as neorealism and neoliberalism also have exogeneously given preferences such as can be seen in Kenneth Waltz's Theory of International Politics, where anarchy is a structural constraint on state behaviour. Constructivism Constructivists have been seen to challenge the assumptions of rationalism in arguing that the social world is constructed. They emphasize the importance of norms and ideas in international relations. Bridging the divide Zehfuss argues that it is wrong to characterise the dialogue between the two theories as a debate due to the lack of debate between the two theories in key international relations journals.Zehfuss, Maja (2002) Constructivism in International Relations: Politics of Reality, Cambridge, University of Cambridge Press, p. 5 Leading rationalist James Fearon and leading constructivist Alexander Wendt argued in an article in 2002 that some form of synthesis between the two theories is possible, and that the two perspectives should have been seen primarily as methodological tools rather than diametrically opposed ontologies. Meanwhile, political economist Robyn Klingler-Vidra further substantiated the debate in her book addressing that contextualism and rationality are often construed as diametric opposites. The phrase contextual rationality means that policymakers are rational in that they have excellent computational ability and that their preferences are rooted in their normative context. Norms and identities ‚Äì the key arenas for constructivist study ‚Äì are not rational, and as such, are left out of rationalist models and arguments. Mainstream economic models depicts actors as rational, meaning that actors have ‚Äúimpressively clear and voluminous,‚Äù if not absolutely complete, knowledge; the rational actor exhibits a well-organized and stable system of preferences; and possesses a strong computational skill (Herbert Simon 1955, 99)Simon, H.A. (1950) \\"A Behavioral Model of Rational Choice\\", The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Volume 69, Issue 1, February 1955, Pages 99‚Äì118. When the rational man learns, makes optimal choices according to a cost-benefit analysis that maximizes utility by minimizing risk. On the other hand, scholarship that examines context, such as norms, culture, and institutions, as the core analytical object seeks to explain why locales pursue often idiosyncratic actions. Explanations emanating from context as the analytical inroads, reveal variance, diversity, and specificity through qualitative research methods. To illustrate, Context-specific explanations, as one would expect, repudiate the idea that rational actor models could account for the variety of preferences caused by distinct (local) experiences. Contextual rationality is an alternative depiction of rationality. Psychology and behavioural economics notion of ‚Äúbounded rationality‚ÄùBounded rationality on Wikipediaposit that rationality is limited or incomplete, as actors‚Äô learning and decision-making processes are abbreviated by their cognitive biases. More than the delimiting of rationality due to incomplete information; cognitive psychology research by scholars such as Danny Kahneman and Amos TverskyAmos Tversky, Daniel Kahneman. (1974) \\"Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases\\", Science, Vol. 185, Issue 4157, pp. 1124-1131, show that actors rely on cognitive shortcuts to learn and to make decisions, and these shortcuts help them to skirt the rational analytical process. Such cognitive heuristics make learning and decision making ‚Äúeasier.‚Äù Cognitive biases point actors toward studying and replicating models that are representative and available, and being ‚Äúanchored‚Äù by models. The starting information‚Äîthe anchor‚Äîexerts drag on actors' ability or desire to act in too different in a manner than they observe. Different than traditional accounts of rationality or bounded rationality, contextual rationality bridges the constructivist-rationalist divide by contending that actors are rational; they are computationally able to process information, they access large swathes of information and their system of preferences is consistent and stable. At the same time, their computations are context-based because preferences are derived from norms that inform how the actors see themselves (their ‚Äúidentity‚Äù). Contextually rooted appropriateness, not technical efficiency, underpins the cost-benefit calculations performed in the learning process. Norms do more than constrain behaviors expected by rational actor models, or subvert otherwise robotic decision-making processes; norms are the bedrock for identity, and as such, preferences that inform rationality. With contextual rationality as the basis, we can better learn, and design, policies and systems that can build on local context.

Towns in this Zone include Meti.  Overview  The area of the Mezhenger Zone lies to the east of the escarpment which borders the edge of the lowlands which define the majority of the area of the Gambela Region. The terrain is predominantly hilly, and elevations range 550‚Äì1260 meters above sea level. According to the Atlas of the Ethiopian Rural Economy published by the Central Statistical Agency (CSA), over 40% of the Zone is forest.Atlas of the Ethiopian Rural Economy , p. 18 This Zone covers the extent of the original special woreda of Godere, which was made part of the Administrative Zone 2 between 1994 and 2001.

Most of his collected poems are in praise of the Fatimids against the claims of the Abbasids and the Umayyads of Spain. He was also called al-Mutanabbi of the West () by many of his contemporaries as well as later historians. Ibn Hani was murdered on his way from Egypt in c. 973. Early life HƒÅni's father was a native of a village near al-Mahdiyya in Tunisia, who had moved to Elvira (present-day Granada) in Spain or, according to others, to C√≥rdoba. Ibn HƒÅni' was born in one of these two towns. He studied in C√≥rdoba and then proceeded to Elvira and Seville. In the latter city, his frivolous way of living and too free speech brought upon him the wrath of the people who accused him of agreeing with the Greek philosophers and of heresy, so that he was counseled by the local ruler, a supporter, to leave Seville as he was afraid of being suspected of allying with him. At the age of 27, he went to Africa to Jawhar, a freeman and general of the Fatimid al-Mans≈´r. When he received only 200 dinƒÉrs from the latter for a qasida addressed to him, he went to al-Masila (Msila) in Algiers where his compatriots Ja'far b. Ali b. Falah b. Abi MarwƒÉn and Yahya b. Ali b. Hamdun al-Andalusi were ruling. Treated with great respect by them he composed some notable poems in their honor. Rise to prominence Spending his childhood in a pro-Fatimid atmosphere, Ibn Hani was well versed with the Fatimid traditions and religious traits. He was at first a courtier to the Banu Hamdun of al- Masila, the Fatimid client state founded during the reign of Abdullah al Mahdi; then he joined the Fatimid court at al-Mansuriyyah before the Banu Hamdun allied themselves with the Zanata and pro-Umayyad factions. While at the Banu Hamdun, his fame spread throughout the empire owing to his incomparable odes until he was summoned by the Caliph Al-Muizz himself to serve him at his court, overwhelming him with tokens of esteem. He was a highly revered poet even before he entered the Capital. The poets of Ifriqiya lampooned him aiming to demoralize him upon his arrival to which he replied \\"I shall not reply to any of them unless Ali al Tunusi writes to me, for if he does I shall reply to him and no other.\\" Hearing this, Ali replied, \\"I would never lampoon him even if I was the worst of all men after he has given me a status above all the other poets of this land.\\". At this point of time, he became the chief court poet and panygerist of Al-Muizz. Defending the claims of the Fatimids against those of the sunni Umayyads and Abbasid usurpers, he continued to eulogize the merits of al-Muizz and other Fatimid Imams, making known their noble aims. He thus rendered a valuable service to Fatimid propaganda through his poetry, which was widely read from C√≥rdoba to Baghdad. Themes He has essentially covered three main themes throughout his poetic career namely politics, religion and battle. =Religion= Having a strong religious conviction, it's devotional spirit runs deep through all his poetry. He was well versed in Ismaili thought and was devoted to the Ahl al Bait (People of the House of the Prophet) in whose honour he composed poems of remarkable power and beauty. The following lines are a perfect display of the religious theme in his poetry. Command what you will, not what the fates ordain, For you are the one, the overpowering one.. You are the one through whose love and affection, salvation is foreseen and our burdens removed.. You are the one on whose intercession we depend, when tomorrow brings forth the day of resurrection.. You are the one in whose presence the fire of hell, would at once flicker out if it were to see you.. All glory belongs to the progeny of Ahmad, what is not ascribed to them is empty of glory! =Politics= Ibn Hani played an important role in establishing the political propaganda for the Fatimid State through his poetry. He claimed in a number of panegyrical verses that not only all of the Muslim world, but the entire world belongs legitimately to the Fatimid Caliph. Also, his political mentioning dramatically merges with his religious views whereby he claims that the Umayyads and the Abbasids rule over illegitimate territories as they have defied the sayings of Prophet Muhammad by usurping and killing the Ahl al Bait for whom the Prophet willed obedience, loyalty and allegiance and the Fatimid Imam is that very descendant who claims absolute loyalty of the Muslim world. The Fatimids believed themselves surrounded by these two and the Byzantine Empire as enemies. The propaganda written by Ibn Hani attacked where he thought them most vulnerable. The Umayyads were chastised for cowardice, ostentatious luxury, questionable genealogy and ineptitude. The Abbasids, the weakest and most distant of the Fatimid adversaries, were seen as debauched people unworthy to rule, effeminate, indifferent to the Byzantine advances in Syria they were unable to check, and an old decrepit dynasty which should make room for new blood. The propaganda against the Byzantines, which was written primarily for internal consumption and self-congratulation, created an image of the infidel ever defeated by the might of Fatimid land and sea power. This propaganda coupled with intense diplomacy resulted in a series of convergent attacks against Egypt, the Byzantine fleet, the Qarmatians in Palestine and Berber tribes near Alexandria. After c. 966, an official Fatimid delegation was sent to Egypt inviting the amir Kafur to recognize Fatimid suzerainty. The embassy was given amiable reception but nothing more. On 23 April 968 C.E., Kafur died leaving Egypt open for conquest. The news reached al Muizz in al Mansuriyyah a month later. By the middle of Ramadan in the year 969 C.E., a messenger had returned to al Muizz with the glad tidings that Egypt had fallen to the Fatimids. Ibn Hani, ready on the spot, recited an ode which began thus: \\"The Abbasids are saying, \\"Has Egypt been conquered?\\", So say to them, \\"The matter has been decided!\\" =Battle= Not unlike his contemporary Al Mutanabbi, he found immense success in the description of the Fatimid armies and their battles. He gained singular recognition for describing Caliph al Muizz's fleet, which was the most dominant force in the whole of the Mediterranean, and his well-bred horses, to which he dedicated hundreds of verses. Death When al-Muizz went to Egypt in c. 972 to take up his residence in Cairo, Ibn Hani left him and returned to the Maghreb to bring back his family, but was murdered in Barqah in Cyrenaica on his road on Wednesday, 30 April, c. 973 at the age of 36. Accounts of his murder differ. When al Muizz in Egypt heard of the poet's death, he lamented, \\"He was a man whom we hoped to rival the poets of the East, but this was not granted to us.\\" Diwan There is scarce information about other court poets who flourished under the patronage of the Fatimid Caliph Imams. A large portion of their works seems to have perished in the destruction of Cairo's famed libraries which followed the collapse of the Fatimid state in c. 1171. Ibn Hani's diwan, apart from surviving, has been the subject of research for many scholars like Zahid Ali, Farhad Daftary and M. Canard, the author of the French book \\"L'imperialisme des Fatimides et leur propagande\\". Zahid Ali has edited the Diwan and elaborated the verses in his thesis \\"Tabyeen al Ma'ani fi Sharh Diwan Ibn Hani\\" for which he has received the Doctorate of Philosophy from the Oxford University in London. The Zahid Ali edition of the Diwan has sixty poems and three in the appendix which have disputed claims with regard to their authorship.

During the pre-independence period, inhabitants of the current Portuguese territory were often enslaved and enslaved others. After independence, during the existence of the Kingdom of Portugal, the country played a leading role in the Atlantic Slave Trade, which involved the mass trade and transportation of slaves from Africa and other parts of the world to the American continent. Slavery was abolished in Portugal in 1761 by the Marqu√™s de Pombal. After the abolishment of slavery in Portugal, the Portuguese slave traders turned to clients in other countries where slavery was not yet abolished, predominantly to Brazil. As for the Atlantic slave trade, this began in 1444 A.D., when Portuguese traders brought the first large number of slaves from Africa to Europe. Eighty-two years later (1526), Spanish explorers brought the first African slaves to settlements in what would become the United States. History =Ancient era= Slavery was a major economic and social institution in Europe during the classical era and a great deal is known about the ancient Greeks and Romans in relation to the topic. Rome added Portugal to its empire (2nd century BC), the latter a province of Lusitania at the time, and the name of the future kingdom was derived from \\"Portucale\\", a Roman and post-Roman settlement situated at the mouth of the Douro River. The details of slavery in Roman Portugal are not well-known; however, there were several forms of slavery, including enslaved miners and domestic servants. =Visigothic and Suebi kingdoms= The Visigoths and the Suebi (Germanic tribes), of the 5th century AD, seized control of the Iberian peninsula as the Roman Empire fell. At the time, Portugal did not exist as a separate kingdom, but was primarily a part of the Visigothic Iberian kingdom (the Visigothic ruling class lived apart and heavily taxed the native population). However, during this period, a gradual transition to feudalism and serfdom was occurring throughout Europe. =Islamic Iberia= After the Umayyad conquest of Hispania in the 8th century, in which Moors from North Africa crossed the Strait of Gibraltar and defeated the Visigothic rulers of Iberia, the territory of both modern-day Portugal and Spain fell under Islamic control. The pattern of slavery and serfdom in the Iberian Peninsula differs from the rest of Western Europe due to the Islamic conquest. They established Moorish kingdoms in Iberia, including the area that is occupied by modern Portugal. In comparison to the north, classical-style slavery continued for a longer period of time in southern Europe and trade between Christian Europe, across the Mediterranean, with Islamic North Africa meant that Slavic and Christian Iberian slaves appeared in Italy, Spain, Southern France and Portugal; in the 8th century, the Islamic conquest in Portugal and Spain changed this pattern. Trade ties between the Moorish kingdoms and the North African Moorish state led to a greater flow of trade within those geographical areas. In addition, the Moors engaged sections of Spaniards and Portuguese Christians in slave labor. There was not a ‚Äúracial‚Äù component to slavery in Iberia. The Moors used ethnic European slaves: 1/12 of Iberian population were slave Europeans, less than 1% of Iberia were Moors and more than 99% were native Iberians. Periodic Arab and Moorish raiding expeditions were sent from Islamic Iberia to ravage the remaining Christian Iberian kingdoms, bringing back stolen goods and slaves. In a raid against Lisbon in 1189, for example, the Almohad caliph Yaqub al- Mansur held 3,000 women and children as captives, while his governor of C√≥rdoba, in a subsequent attack upon Silves, held 3,000 Christian slaves in 1191. In addition, the Christian Iberians who lived within Arab and Moorish- ruled territories were subject to specific laws and taxes for state protection. =Reconquista= Muslim Moors who converted to Christianity, known as Moriscos, were enslaved by the Portuguese during the Reconquista; 9.3 per cent of slaves in southern Portugal were Moors and many Moors were enslaved in 16th-century Portugal. It has been documented that other slaves were treated better than Moriscos, the slaves were less than 1% of population. After the Reconquista period, Moorish slaves began to outnumber Slavic slaves in both importance and numbers in Portugal. =Age of Discovery= Black slaves African slaves prior to 1441 were predominately Berbers and Arabs from the North African Barbary coast, known as ‚ÄòMoors‚Äù to the Iberian. They were typically enslaved during wars and conquests between Christian and Islamic kingdoms. The first expeditions of Sub-Saharan Africa were sent out by Prince Infante D. Henrique, known commonly today as Henry the Navigator, with the intent to probe how far the kingdoms of the Moors and their power reached. The expeditions sent by Henry came back with African slaves as a way to compensate for the expenses of their voyages. The enslavement of Africans was seen as a military campaign because the people that the Portuguese encountered were identified as Moorish and thus associated with Islam. The royal chronicler Gomes Eanes de Zurara was never decided on the ‚ÄúMoorishness‚Äù of the slaves brought back from Africa, due to a seeming lack of contact with Islam. Slavery in Portugal and the number of slaves expanded after the Portuguese began exploration of Sub-Saharan Africa. Slave raids in Sub-Saharan Africa began in the 1430s and 1440s as war campaigns, but this period was short- lived. The Portuguese quickly transitioned into a trade network with African nobility and slavers. Prince Infante D. Henrique began selling African slaves in Lagos in 1444. In 1455, Pope Nicholas V gave Portugal the rights to continue the slave trade in West Africa, under the provision that they convert all people who are enslaved. The Portuguese soon expanded their trade along the whole west coast of Africa. Infante D Henrique held the monopoly on all expeditions to Africa granted by the crown until his death in 1460. Afterward, any ship sailing for Africa required authorization from the crown. All slaves and goods brought back to Portugal were subject to duties and tariffs. Slaves were baptized before shipment. Their process of enslavement, which was viewed by critics as cruel, was justified by the conversion of the enslaved to Christianity. The high demand for slaves was due to a shortage of laborers in Portugal. Black slaves were in higher demand than Moorish slaves because they were much easier to convert to Christianity and less likely to escape. Although it was more expensive to purchase a slave than it was to employ a freeman, the sparse population and the lack of free labor made the purchase of a slave a necessary investment. The number of black slaves in Portugal given by contemporary accounts argue that Lisbon and the colonies of Portugal averaged a maximum of 10% of the population between the 16th and 18th centuries, but these numbers are impossible to verify. Most slaves in Portugal were concentrated in Lisbon and to the south in the Algarve. The number of black slaves brought to Lisbon and sold cannot be known. This is because the records of both royal institutions responsible for the sale of black slaves, the Casa de Guin√© and the Casa dos Escravos were damaged during the earthquake of 1755 in Lisbon, and the fiscal records containing the numbers and sales of these companies were destroyed. The records of the royal chronicler Zurara claim that 927 African slaves were brought to Portugal between 1441 and 1448, and an estimated 1000 black slaves arrived in Portugal each year afterward. A common estimate is that around 2000 black slaves arrive in Lisbon annually after 1490. Because of Portugal‚Äôs small population, Portuguese colonization was only possible with the large number of slaves they had acquired. In the late 15th and into the 16th centuries, the Portuguese economic reliance on slaves was less in question than the sheer number of slaves found in Portugal. People wishing to purchase slaves in Portugal had two sources, the royal slaving company, the Casa da Guin√©, or from slave merchants who had purchased their slaves through the Casa de Guin√© to sell as retail. There were up to 70 slave merchants in Lisbon in the 1550s. Slave auctions occurred in the town or market square, or in the streets of central Lisbon. The sale of slaves was compared by observers as similar to the sale of horses or livestock. The laws of commerce regarding slavery addresses them as merchandise or objects. There was a period of time set upon purchase for the buyer to decide if he is happy with the slave he had purchased. The occupations of slaves varied widely. Some slaves in Lisbon could find themselves working in domestic settings, but most worked hard labor in the mines and metal forges, while others worked at the docks loading and maintaining ships. Some slaves worked peddling cheap goods at the markets and returning the profits to their masters. Opportunities for slaves to become free were scarce, however there were many instances in which slaves had either elevated their status or obtained their freedom. Slaves were able to buy their freedom by saving any earnings, so long as their masters allow them to keep their earnings, or purchase a slave to replace them. Women slaves could be freed if their masters chose to marry them, but this was more common among the colonies. When Lisbon was on the verge of being invaded in 1580, slaves were promised their freedom in exchange for their military service. 440 slaves took the offer and most, after being freed, left Portugal. Black female slaves were desired for sexual purposes, resulting in many mixed- race offspring. This prompted the Council of Trent in 1563 to denounce the widespread immorality. Mulattoes had the ability to integrate into society, some would even command whole fleets of ships. Slavery did little to alter society in Portugal, due to the slight ease of enslaved people‚Äôs integration, those who did not assimilate were treated similar to the poor. Asians After the Portuguese first made contact with Japan in 1543, a large-scale slave trade developed in which Portuguese purchased Japanese as slaves in Japan and sold them to various locations overseas, including Portugal itself, throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. Many documents mention the large slave trade along with protests against the enslavement of Japanese. Japanese slaves are believed to be the first of their nation to end up in Europe, and the Portuguese purchased large numbers of Japanese slave girls to bring to Portugal for sexual purposes, as noted by the Church in 1555. King Sebastian feared that it was having a negative effect on Catholic proselytization since the slave trade in Japanese was growing to massive proportions, so he commanded that it be banned in 1571. Records of three Japanese slaves dating from the 16th century, named Gaspar Fernandes, Miguel and Ventura who ended up in Mexico showed that they were purchased by Portuguese slave traders in Japan, brought to Manila from where they were shipped to Mexico by their owner Perez. Japanese slave women were even sold as concubines to black African crew members, along with their European counterparts serving on Portuguese ships trading in Japan, mentioned by Luis Cerqueira, a Portuguese Jesuit, in a 1598 document. Hideyoshi blamed the Portuguese and Jesuits for this slave trade and banned Christian proselytizing as a result. Some Korean slaves were bought by the Portuguese and brought to Portugal from Japan, where they had been among the tens of thousands of Korean prisoners of war transported to Japan during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592‚Äì98). Historians pointed out that at the same time Hideyoshi expressed his indignation and outrage at the Portuguese trade in Japanese slaves, he himself was engaging in a mass slave trade of Korean prisoners of war in Japan. Chinese were bought in large numbers as slaves by the Portuguese in the 1520s. Japanese Christian Daimyos mainly responsible for selling to the Portuguese their fellow Japanese. Japanese women and Japanese men, Javanese, Chinese, and Indians were all sold as slaves in Portugal. Some Chinese slaves in Spain ended up there after being brought to Lisbon, Portugal, and sold when they were boys. Trist√°n de la China was a Chinese who was taken as a slave by the Portuguese, while he was still a boy and in the 1520s was obtained by Cristob√°l de Haro in Lisbon, and taken to live in Seville and Valladolid. He was paid for his service as a translator on the 1525 Loa√≠sa expedition, during which he was still an adolescent. The survivors, including Tristan, were shipwrecked for a decade until 1537 when they were brought back by a Portuguese ship to Lisbon. There are records of Chinese slaves in Lisbon as early as 1540. According to modern historians, the first known visit of a Chinese person to Europe dates to 1540 (or soon after), when a Chinese scholar, apparently enslaved by Portuguese raiders somewhere on the southern China coast, was brought to Portugal. Purchased by Jo√£o de Barros, he worked with the Portuguese historian on translating Chinese texts into Portuguese. In sixteenth century southern Portugal there were Chinese slaves but the number of them was described as \\"negligible\\", being outnumbered by East Indian, Mourisco, and African slaves. Amerindians, Chinese, Malays, and Indians were slaves in Portugal but in far fewer number than Turks, Berbers, and Arabs. China and Malacca were origins of slaves delivered to Portugal by Portuguese viceroys. A testament from 23 October 1562 recorded a Chinese man named Ant√≥nio who was enslaved and owned by a Portuguese woman, Dona Maria de Vilhena, a wealthy noblewoman in √âvora.: \\"e o chin√™s, tamb√©m Ant√≥nio, ainda h√° pouco referido e que era condutor das az√©molas de D. Maria de Vilhena\\" Ant√≥nio was among the three most common male names given to male slaves in √âvora. D. Maria owned one of the only two Chinese slaves in √âvora and she specifically selected and used him from among the slaves she owned to drive her mules for her because he was Chinese since rigorous and demanding tasks were assigned to Mourisco, Chinese, and Indian slaves. D. Maria's owning a Chinese, 3 Indians, and 3 Mouriscos among her fifteen slaves reflected on her high social status, since Chinese, Mouriscos, and Indians were among the ethnicities of prized slaves and were very expensive compared to blacks, so high class individuals owned these ethnicities and it was because her former husband Sim√£o was involved in the slave trade in the east that she owned slaves of many different ethnicities. When she died, D. Maria freed twelve of her slaves including this Chinese man in her testament, leaving them with sums from 20,000 to 10,000 r√©is in money. D. Maria de Vilhena was the daughter of the nobleman and explorer Sancho de Tovar, the capit√£o of Sofala (List of colonial governors of Mozambique), and she was married twice, the first marriage to the explorer Crist√≥v√£o de Mendon√ßa, and her second marriage was to Sim√£o da Silveira, capit√£o of Diu (Lista de governadores, capit√£es e castel√µes de Diu). D. Maria was left a widow by Sim√£o, and she was a major slave owner, possessing the most slaves in √âvora, with her testament recording fifteen slaves. A legal case was brought before the Spanish Council of the Indies in the 1570s, involving two Chinese men in Seville, one of them a freeman, Esteban Cabrera, and the other a slave, Diego Indio, against Juan de Morales, Diego's owner. Diego called on Esteban to give evidence as a witness on his behalf. Diego recalled that he was taken as a slave by Francisco de Caste√±eda from Mexico, to Nicaragua, then to Lima in Peru, then to Panama, and eventually to Spain via Lisbon, while he was still a boy. Chinese boys were kidnapped from Macau and sold as slaves in Lisbon while they were still children. Brazil imported some of Lisbon's Chinese slaves.: \\"J√° por a√≠ se v√™ que devem ter sido numerosos os escravos chineses que tomaram o caminho de Lisboa ‚Äî e por extens√£o o do Brasil ... Em 1744 era o imperador Qianlong quem ordenava que nenhum Chin√™s ou europeu de Macau vendesse filhos e filhas, prohibi√ß√£o reiterada em 1750 pelo vice-rei de Cant√£o.\\" Fillippo Sassetti saw some Chinese and Japanese slaves in Lisbon among the large slave community in 1578, although most of the slaves were blacks. Brazil and Portugal were both recipients of Chinese slaves bought by Portuguese. Portugal exported to Brazil some Chinese slaves. Military, religious, and civil service secretarial work and other lenient and light jobs were given to Chinese slaves while hard labor was given to Africans. Only African slaves in 1578 Lisbon outnumbered the large numbers of Japanese and Chinese slaves in the same city. Some of the Chinese slaves were sold in Brazil, a Portuguese colony. Cooking was the main profession of Chinese slaves around 1580 in Lisbon, according to Fillippo Sassetti from Florence and the Portuguese viewed them as diligent, smart, and \\"loyal\\". The Portuguese \\"highly regarded\\" Asian slaves like Chinese and Japanese, much more \\"than slaves from sub-Saharan Africa\\" and Moorish Muslims. The Portuguese attributed qualities like intelligence and industriousness to Chinese and Japanese slaves which is why they favored them more. Traits such as high intelligence were ascribed to Chinese, Indian and Japanese slaves. In 1595, a law was passed by Portugal banning the selling and buying of Chinese and Japanese slaves due to hostility from the Chinese and Japanese regarding the trafficking in Japanese and Chinese slaves On 19 February 1624, the King of Portugal forbade the enslavement of Chinese people of either sex. A Portuguese woman, Dona Ana de Ata√≠de owned an Indian man named Ant√≥nio as a slave in √âvora. He served as a cook for her. Ana de Ata√≠de's Indian slave escaped from her in 1587. A large number of slaves were forcibly brought there since the commercial, artisanal, and service sectors all flourished in a regional capital like √âvora. A fugitive Indian slave from Evora named Ant√≥nio went to Badajoz after leaving his master in 1545. Portuguese domination was accepted by the \\"docile\\" Jau slaves. In √âvora, Brites Figueira owned a Javanese (Jau) slave named Maria Jau. Ant√£o Azedo took an Indian slave named Heitor to Evora, who along with another slave was from Bengal were among the 34 Indian slaves in total who were owned by Trist√£o Homem, a nobleman in 1544 in √âvora. Manuel Gomes previously owned a slave who escaped in 1558 at age 18 and he was said to be from the \\"land of Prester John of the Indias\\" named Diogo. In √âvora, men were owned and used as slaves by female establishments like convents for nuns. Three male slaves and three female slaves were given to the nuns of Montemor by the alcaide-mor's widow. In order to \\"serve those who serve God\\" and being told to obey orders \\"in all things that they ordered them\\", a boy named Manual along with his slave mother were given to the Nuns of Montemor by father Jorge Fernandes in 1544. A capel√£o do rei, father Jo√£o Pinto left an Indian man in Porto, where he was picked up in 1546 by the √âvora-based Santa Marta convent's nuns to serve as their slave. However, female slaves did not serve in male establishments, unlike vice versa. =Slavery in Macau and the coast of China= Beginning in the 16th century, the Portuguese tried to establish trading ports and settlements along the coast of China. Early attempts at establishing such bases, such as those in Ningbo and Quanzhou, were however destroyed by the Chinese, following violent raids by the settlers to neighboring ports, which included pillaging and plunder and sometimes enslavement.(the University of Michigan) (the University of Michigan)(the University of California)(the University of Michigan) The resulting complaints made it to the province's governor who commanded the settlement destroyed and the inhabitants wiped out. In 1545, a force of 60,000 Chinese troops descended on the community, and 800 of the 1,200 Portuguese residents were massacred, with 25 vessels and 42 junks destroyed.(Original from the University of California)(Original from the New York Public Library)(Original from Princeton University)(Original from the New York Public Library) Until the mid-17th century, during the early Portuguese mandate of Macau, some 5,000 slaves lived in the territory, in addition to 2,000 Portuguese and an ever-growing number of Chinese, which in 1664 reached 20,000. This number decreased in the following decades to between 1000 and 2000. Most of the slaves were of African origin. Rarely did Chinese women marry Portuguese, initially, mostly Goans, Ceylonese/Sinhalese (from today's Sri Lanka), Indochinese, Malay (from Malacca), and Japanese women were the wives of the Portuguese men in Macau. Slave women of Indian, Indonesian, Malay, and Japanese origin were used as partners by Portuguese men. Japanese girls would be purchased in Japan by Portuguese men. From 1555 onwards Macau received slave women of Timorese origin as well as women of African origin, and from Malacca and India. Macau was permitted by Pombal to receive an influx of Timorese women. Macau received an influx of African slaves, Japanese slaves as well as Christian Korean slaves who were bought by the Portuguese from the Japanese after they were taken prisoner during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592‚Äì98) in the era of Hideyoshi. On June 24, 1622, the Dutch attacked Macau in the Battle of Macau, expecting to turn the area into a Dutch possession, with an 800-strong invasion force led by under Captain Kornelis Reyerszoon. The relatively small number of defenders repulsed the Dutch attack, which was not repeated. The majority of the defenders were Africans slaves, with only a few dozen Portuguese soldiers and priests in support, and they accounted for most of the victims in the battle. Following the defeat, the Dutch Governor Jan Coen said of the Macao slaves, that \\"it was they who defeated and drove away our people there\\".(the University of California)(University of Texas)(the University of Michigan) In the 1800s, during the Qing dynasty, the British consul noted that some Portuguese were still buying children between five and eight years of age.(the University of Michigan) In 1814, the Jiaqing Emperor added a clause to the section of the fundamental laws of China titled \\"Wizards, Witches, and all Superstitions, prohibited\\", later modified in 1821 and published in 1826 by the Daoguang Emperor, which sentenced Europeans, namely Portuguese Christians who would not repent their conversion, to be sent to Muslim cities in Xinjiang as slaves to Muslim leaders. =Treatment= During transport to Portugal, slaves were fastened and chained with manacles, padlocks, and rings around their necks. Portuguese owners could whip, chain, and pour burning hot wax and fat onto the skin of their slaves, and punish their slaves in any way that they wished, as long as the slaves remained alive. The Portuguese also used branding irons to brand their slaves as property. =Banning= Voices condemning the slave trade were raised quite early on during the Atlantic Slave Trade period. Among them was Gaspar da Cruz (1550-1575), a Dominican friar who dismissed any arguments by the slave traffickers that they had \\"legally\\" purchased already-enslaved children, among the earliest condemnations of slavery in Europe during this period. (Includes an translation of Gaspar da Cruz's entire book, with C.R. Boxer's comments) From an early age during the Atlantic Slave Trade period, the crown attempted to stop the trading of non-African slaves. The enslavement and overseas trading of Chinese slaves, who were prized by the Portuguese, was specifically addressed in response to Chinese authorities' requests, who, although not against the enslavement of people in Macau and Chinese territories, which was common practice,: \\"From very early on, it was recognized that the purchase of Chinese persons (particularly female infants) caused no particular problems in Macao, but that the export of these people as slaves was contrary to the safeguarding of peaceable relations with the Chinese authorities. This point is clearly made by a Royal Decree of 1624 ... [t]hese good intentions were, however, difficult to uphold in the territory where the monetary purchase of persons was easily accomplished and the supply very abundant, particularly of young females.\\" at different times attempted to stop the transport of slaves to outside the territory. In 1595, a Portuguese royal decree banned the selling and buying of ethnically Chinese slaves; it was reiterated by the Portuguese King on February 19, 1624, and, in 1744, by the Qianlong Emperor, who forbade the practice to Chinese subjects, reiterating his order in 1750. However, these laws were not able to stop the trade completely, a practice which lasted until the 1700s. In the American colonies, Portugal halted the use of Chinese, Japanese, Europeans, and Indians to work as slaves for sugar plantations, which was reserved exclusively for African slaves. The abolition of all forms of slavery occurred in 1761 on mainland Portugal and Portuguese India through a decree by the Marquis of Pombal, followed, in 1777, by Madeira. The transatlantic slave trade was definitively outlawed altogether by Portugal in 1836, at the same time as other European powers, as a result of British pressure. Slavery within the African Portuguese colonies, however, would only be definitively abolished in 1869, following a treaty between United States and Britain for the suppression of the slave trade. In Brazil, which had become independent from Portugal in 1822, slavery was finally abolished in 1888. However, Portuguese involvement in slavery in its colonies continued into the 20th century. So-called contract labourers were effectively slaves as, although they signed a piece of paper, they had no idea what they were signing. In most cases they were not paid and few were returned to their homes when the duration of the contract was over. The use of such slavery in S√£o Tom√© led in 1909 to the three leading British chocolate makers, Cadbury's, Fry's and Rowntree's, ceasing to buy cocoa beans from that colony.

The Maya built long canoes to navigate the Campeche Bank, the Yucatan Straits, and the Gulf of Honduras.

After graduation, Bauman began his work in journalism as a reporter for the Chicago Herald-Examiner.Duncan Bauman Resume, at St. Louis Mercantile Library website (University of Missouri-St. Louis), www.umsl.edu, accessed 2010-12-18. There, he was involved in the surrender of Robert George Irwin, wanted for the Easter weekend murder of girlfriend Veronica Gedeon, her mother, and a boarder. The Herald-Examiner had paid Irwin $5,000 for the exclusive rights to Irwin‚Äôs confession and surrender to authorities.‚ÄúDuncan Bauman was one of the Reporters Guarding Killer Irwin,‚Äù Humboldt Republican, 1937-07-02 at p. 1. Bauman temporarily left journalism in 1939, moving to St. Louis to work as an architectural representative for paint manufacturer Pratt & Lambert Inc. In 1943, however, he returned, joining the St. Louis Globe-Democrat as a reporter. He became the assistant city editor (while attending Washington University Law School, where he graduated in 1948). Bauman was promoted to the newspaper‚Äôs personnel manager in 1951. In 1959, after the newspaper had been purchased by the Newhouse family in 1955 and had entered into a joint operating agreement with its principal competitor, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, he became the Globe-Democrat's business manager. In 1967, he was named to succeed Richard Amberg as its publisher. A major difference between the St. Louis dailies concerned their policies of civic involvement. While the Pulitzer family‚Äôs Post-Dispatch formally prohibited its staff from most involvement in local organizations to avoid conflicts of interest, the Globe-Democrat encouraged it, and Bauman was particularly active in St. Louis civic organizations. From 1957 to 1961 he served as the secretary of the St. Louis Board of Election Commissioners.‚ÄúVote Probed,‚Äù San Antonio Express and News, 1960-08-07 at p. 8.

A special congressional committee investigating efforts by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to discredit Martin Luther King Jr. suggested that a March 30, 1968 Globe-Democrat editorial critical of Dr. King was inspired and ghostwritten by the FBI, which considered the newspaper‚Äôs publisher to be ‚Äúespecially cooperative to the bureau.‚ÄùReport of the Select Committee on Assassinations, U.S. House of Representatives, 95th Congress, 2d sess. p. 439-41 (Washington, D.C., U.S. Government Printing Office, 1979). While recognizing that the Globe-Democrat‚Äôs editorial was protected by the First Amendment, the Committee was highly critical of ‚Äúthe ease with which the Bureau had been able to use the newspaper for its counterintelligence initiatives.‚Äù The Committee found that, not only did the FBI‚Äôs conduct ‚Äúcontribute to the hostile climate that surrounded Dr. King, it was morally reprehensible, illegal, felonious, and unconstitutional.‚Äù In 1983, the Pulitzers and Samuel Irving Newhouse, Jr. entered into an agreement under which the Globe-Democrat would fold, and Newhouse News Service would receive a share of the resulting profits of the Post-Dispatch.Carol Felsenthal, ‚ÄúCitizen Newhouse: Portrait of a Media Merchant,‚Äù p. 220 (1998). Thus, in October 1983 Bauman announced the end of his newspaper, effective December 31, 1983. However, the United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division insisted that Newhouse seek out a purchaser, and in December 1983 a sale to Jeffrey M. Gluck was announced.St. Louis Paper Purchased,‚Äù Winchester (VA) Star, 1983-12-24 at p. 30. Bauman retired, however, and by 1986 the newspaper closed for good.

In 1991, Bauman married Lucy Beatrice (Hencke) Hume, widow of Fred Hume, a St. Louis businessman who had worked with Bauman at the Globe-Democrat in the 1940s. Bauman had no children.

Both were tried and found guilty in March 1893 and were sentenced to death. John was hanged on 15 August 1893 but Sarah's sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. On 29 April 1911, Sarah was paroled from the State Reformatory for Women at Long Bay in response to the petition of her daughters. Background Sarah Jane Sutcliffe was born on 20 December 1845 to Ellen Murphy and Emanuel Sutcliffe; her father was a miller and former convict. Sarah's first marriage was to sailor Charles Edwards on 29 April 1865 in Sydney. She later married brewery drayman John Makin of Dapto, New South Wales, on 27 August 1871. John was the son of farmer William Samuel Makin and his wife Ellen Selena. John and Sarah produced five sons and five daughters. The couple turned to baby farmingthe practice of caring for illegitimate babies in exchange for paymentas a source of income after John was injured in an accident. Case of Horace Murray In 1892, eighteen-year-old Amber Murray placed an advertisement in the Sydney Morning Herald in search of a mother to adopt a baby boy. Murray was unable to care for her illegitimate son Horace, born on 30 May of that year, and offered to cover child support expenses. The Makins replied that they were willing to take care of Horace for ten shillings per week. Daughter Blanche Makin accepted an initial payment of three pounds and collected the child. John Makin continued to collect child support payments from Amber Murray while responding to her requests to see Horace with excuses. When Murray visited an address near Sydney the Makins had provided, the family had moved to Macdonaldtown, NSW, and could not be found. Murray never saw her baby alive again. Discovery of bodies The Makins came to police attention on 11 October 1892, when worker James Hanoney was clearing a clogged underground drain in the backyard of a home in Burren Street, Macdonaldtown, and found it blocked with the remains of two infants. Investigators examined records to trace the Makins, who had moved again to Chippene. The Makins and four of their daughters were arrested, though only John and Sarah were charged. Police exhumed remains from the backyards of eleven homes that the Makins had occupied since 1890. The bodies of twelve infants were recovered, though some sources say thirteen. Prosecutors believed the Makins sought to profit by taking in babies for childcare payments, and found it easier to kill the children and deceive the parents to continue receiving money. One of their victims was Horace Murray, whose clothing was identified by his mother Amber. Trial In March 1893, the Makins' daughters testified against them in court. Sixteen-year-old Clarice said she recognised clothing recovered from one of the dead babies that was previously in the custody of her mother. Eleven-year-old Daisy recalled that two young girlsbut not Horacehad followed them to Macdonaldtown. Another couple testified that they had been paying the Makins ten shillings per week for the temporary care of their illegitimate baby. The child died within days and the couple paid the Makins two pounds to cover funeral costs. The Makins did not attend the funeral. Sentencing Both Sarah and John Makin were sentenced to death by hanging by the Supreme Court of New South Wales at Sydney for the murder of Horace Murray, with a recommendation by the jury that Sarah Makin be spared the death penalty. Before sentencing the Makins, the judge, Sir Matthew Henry Stephen, said the following: After two appeals,.. and a plea for clemency, were denied, John Makin was hanged on the gallows at Darlinghurst Gaol on 15 August 1893. Sarah's sentence was commuted to life imprisonment with hard labour at the State Reformatory for Women at Long Bay. After her daughters campaigned for her release, Sarah was paroled in 1911, having served nineteen years in prison. According to court records, the Makins were not charged with any further criminal activity. On 13 September 1918, Sarah Makin died in Marrickville, NSW; she was buried in Rookwood Cemetery. Effect on legislation The case of John and Sarah Makin raised awareness of the institution of baby farming and led the New South Wales Legislative Assembly to initiate the Children's Protection Act of 1892 to bring the care of orphaned and destitute children under state control. In media The story of Amber Murray and the Makin family inspired the 2008 Australian theatre production The Hatpin, which played in Sydney and in New York City. In 2009, it was nominated for three Sydney Theatre Awards and won one for best actress. In August 2009, the Makin story was televised in the Discovery Channel's documentary series Deadly Women. The third-season episode \\"Blood for Money\\" featured a re-enactment in which Pip Moore played Amber Murray.

He was the eldest son of Japanologist Philipp Franz Balthasar von Siebold. Biography After his father was deported from Japan in 1829, he settled in Leyden, in the Netherlands. He eventually married in Germany and had three sons and two daughters. After the signing of the Japan- Netherlands Commercial Agreement, one of the unequal treaties ending Japan‚Äôs national isolation policy in 1858, von Siebold returned to Japan in 1859, bringing the young Alexander with him. Living in Nagasaki, Alexander rapidly became fluent in the Japanese language. When his father obtained a position as a foreign advisor to the Tokugawa shogunate, father and son travelled to Edo (modern-day Tokyo). As father Von Siebold acted against the wishes of the Dutch government he was told to return to Java in 1861. Before his father left Japan, Alexander was engaged by the British representative Harry Parkes as a student interpreter because of his fluency in Japanese. Alexander assisted British consul Edward St. John Neale during the Anglo-Satsuma War and was based on the flagship during the conflict. He later accompanied the European task force during the Bombardment of Shimonoseki and the negotiations for opening the port of Hyogo to foreign settlement and trade in 1864. When Tokugawa Akitake was sent to visit the 1867 World Fair in Paris, France, Alexander accompanied him. With the Meiji Restoration, Tokugawa Akitake was ordered back to Japan, but Alexander stayed on in Europe and returned to Japan a year later in 1869 as an advisor to the Empire of Austria-Hungary. He was subsequently ennobled with the title of baron by Franz Joseph I In August 1870, he resigned from the British Consulate. However, the new Meiji government found use for his talents, and he was sent to London and subsequently to Frankfurt to make arrangements for Japanese students in those countries and to hire foreign advisors in all areas of expertise to come to Japan. He also arranged for Japan‚Äôs participation in the Vienna World Expo of 1873. He returned to Japan in November 1872, but was sent back to Europe again in February 1873 to late 1874 to render assistance to Sano Tsunetami. In May 1875, he became official interpreter for the Ministry of Finance. On the death of his mother in 1877, he returned to the Netherlands on six months leave, but was ordered to visit the Exposition Universelle and to assist in commercial negotiations in Berlin. He returned to Japan in October 1881, but was sent back to Germany to assist Inoue Kaoru in Berlin in negotiations with the German government over treaty revisions in October 1881. The negotiations were protracted and ultimately unsuccessful; he left Berlin in 1882, moved to Rome in 1884, returned to Japan in 1885, and moved to London in 1892 to assist Aoki Sh≈´z≈ç in the successful conclusion of the 1894 Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation.

History Thomas Ball Barratt was in the United States when he was baptised in the Holy Spirit. When he returned to Norway, his preaching attracted great attention. In the spring of 1907 Barratt held revival meetings in Oslo, where he preached about the baptism of the Holy Spirit, sanctification and speaking in tongues. He had difficulty in finding a suitable venue for his preaching. Nordquelle and the Free Friends in Torvgaten lent his pulpit to Barratt and there was soon close collaboration between the two. Many Christians there were skeptical of Barratt, and the new revival met with strong resistance. The people who received Spirit baptism were ridiculed as religious fanatics, and satirical cartoons lampooning them appeared in the newspapers. Despite the resistance, or as a result of media attention and gossip, the meetings were well attended. Revivals in Oslo spread with greater speed then in the rest of Norway, and several already established congregations joined the movement. Cooperation between Barratt and Nordquelle went on for some time, but when Barratt rented a separate room in M√∏llergata, there began to be conflict between them, with the Free Friends complaining that Barratt had started competing meetings.

The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria's HIV Program in Kosovo estimated there to be 5,037 prostitutes in the country. Many women turn to prostitution through poverty. There are report that prostitution has become a new organised crime in Kosovo. Recent history Prior to the Kosovo War following the 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence, prostitution was limited to serving the needs of locals. Following the ceasefire and presence in the country of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo and other international organisations, the demand for prostitution soared. As well as women turning to prostitution voluntarily, some were trafficked from Moldova, Bulgaria and the Ukraine. Amnesty International UK Director Kate Allen is quoted as saying \\"Women and girls as young as 11 are being sold into sexual slavery in Kosovo and international peacekeepers are not only failing to stop it they are actively fuelling this despicable trade by themselves paying for sex from trafficked women.\\" Head of the Mitrovica based International Press Centre, Rade Negojevic, claimed Kosovo had become the world's biggest brothel since the arrival of the international peacekeepers. In 2000, the UNMIK administration set up a Trafficking and Prostitution Police Unit with the intention combating pimps, traffickers and organised crime. Measures against trafficking were included in the Interim Penal Code of Kosovo when it was drafted. The State Police Service reported in 2008 that prostitution was occurring in 694 bars, cafeteria and night clubs in Kosovo. Sex trafficking Kosovo is mostly a destination country ( but also a source) for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Most victims are internally trafficked for sexual exploitation. Traffickers recruit victims through false promises of marriage or employment offers in cafes, night-clubs, and restaurants. Many prostitutes, especially from foreign countries also come voluntarily to prostitute in Kosovo. Most sex trafficking victims in Kosovo are girls, with criminal groups which also force women or bring women from Moldova, Romania, Serbia, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Albania and other European countries ( such as Russia) into prostitution. Women and girls are subjected to sex trafficking in private homes and apartments, night-clubs, and massage parlors. Children used as dancers and escorts are vulnerable to sex trafficking. Traffickers subject Kosovo citizens that belong to minorities to forced prostitution throughout Europe. Economically marginalized Roma, Ashkali, and Egyptians communities are vulnerable and used for sex trafficking. Government corruption creates an environment that enables some trafficking crimes. Several police officers, labor ministry employees, and other government officials have been charged with or convicted of trafficking crimes. Article 171 of the criminal code prohibits all forms of trafficking and prescribes punishments of five to 12 years imprisonment and a fine of up to ‚Ç¨500,000. When sex trafficking offenses involve minors or a group of victims subjected to sex trafficking, the penalties increase to 15 to 20 years imprisonment and a fine. Article 231 prohibits taking sexual services from a trafficking victim. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Kosovo as a 'Tier 2' country.

Mention of an Inoue surname is found in Nara period records; however, the Inoue clan which later became prominent in the Edo period traces its antecedents to the Seiwa Genji line founded by Minamoto no Yorisue, grandson of Minamoto no Mitsunaka in the late Heian period. Minamoto no Yorisue, settled in a place called \\"Inoue\\" in Takai District, Shinano Province, and the Inoue clan of Shinano Province were the main branch, but there were other branches in Harima, Aki and Mikawa Provinces.

The play is based on the Charles Dickens 1843 novella, A Christmas Carol. A Klingon Christmas Carol is the Charles Dickens classic tale of ghosts and redemption, adapted to reflect the Klingon values of courage and honor, and then translated into Klingon, performed with English supertitles. Originally created as a fundraiser for Commedia Beauregard theatre company, it was written in 2007 by Christopher Kidder-Mostrom and Sasha Warren and was originally translated by Laura Thurston, Bill Hedrick and Christopher Kidder- Mostrom. Additional content and translations were provided by Chris Lipscombe when the show was expanded in 2010. Commedia Beauregard produced the play from 2007 to 2010 in Minnesota and in Chicago from 2010 to 2014. The play has also been presented in Cincinnati in 2013, Washington DC in 2014, and Simi Valley, CA in 2017. Additionally, the play returned to Minnesota in 2014 and returned to Chicago in 2016.  Synopsis  = Act I = The play opens in a classroom; a member of the Vulcan Institute of Cultural Anthropology begins a comparative lecture on Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol and its Klingon counterpart tlhIngan ram nI' bom (Klingon Long Night's Song). The Vulcan Narrator is assisted by members of the Imperial Klingon Players, who proceed to act out the play. SQuja', a Klingon money lender, demonstrates a lack of courage and honor - refusing to participate in the \\"Year Games\\" and to provide assistance to the sons and daughters of fallen warriors. He is visited first by his deceased partner, marlI', who tells him that he will be visited by three spirits; these will prevent him from sharing marlI's fate of fighting without end and without glory. The first spirit to arrive - ben qeylIS qa' (Ghost of Kahless Past) takes him on a journey through his history - first at his school, then at the party of his former employer (veSIwIq) and finally to a moment shared with his former mate, bel. He is returned to his quarters and anxiously awaits the arrival of the next spirit. = Act II = Act II begins at the same moment Act I ended - with an off-stage voice (Ghost of Kahless Present) yelling SQuja's name. This spirit, DaHjaj qeylIS qa', bids SQuja' drink from the cup of Klingon courage and then shows him what is happening in his current time. They visit the meager feast of SQuja's assistant, QachIt, and his family - including tImHom, QachIt's son, who is crippled and unlikely to pass his Age of Ascension ritual without dying. Next SQuja' and the spirit attend the party of vreD (SQuja's nephew), which consists of a training tournament. Lastly, DaHjaj qeylIS qa' introduces SQuja' to quvHa'ghach (Corruption) and SaHHa'ghach (Apathy) - which spell doom for the Empire - before disappearing. He is replaced by the last spirit, pIq qeylIS qa' (Ghost of Kahless Yet-to-Come). This silent spirit shows SQuja' scenes of what may be - including the death of tImHom - before leaving SQuja' alone in an unfamiliar and unfriendly place. A parade of dead warriors make their way to what SQuja' assumes to be Sto-vo-kor (the Klingon Heaven) while SQuja' realizes the error of his dishonorable ways. SQuja' wakes up in his own bed, elated at the change within himself and proceeds to correct his previous indiscretions, including visits first to vreD and finally to the home of QachIt and tImHom.  Inception and development  Commedia Beauregard, a theatre company whose mission is \\"to translate the universal human experience to the stage: to expand our horizons and share knowledge of all cultures, translating between languages and between arts to create theater that is beautiful in expression\\", created A Klingon Christmas Carol as a fundraising event in 2007. The idea was originally a joke, but was ultimately developed into a serious play. Christopher Kidder-Mostrom and Sasha Warren wrote a new script, based on the Dickens classic. Translations and other assistance for the first production were provided by local Twin Cities Klingon fan groups. After receiving favorable reviews, the play expanded its Twin Cities production to two performances in 2008 and a three-week (12 night) run in 2009 (at the Paul & Sheila Wellstone Center and Mixed Blood Theater, respectively). The 2009 production featured a script with Klingon-language revisions by Chris Lipscombe, a member of the Klingon Language Institute. In 2010, A Klingon Christmas Carol was further expanded and revised by Kidder-Mostrom. Scenes originally absent from the play, including the children under the Ghost of Kahless Present's robe (named \\"Apathy\\" and \\"Corruption\\", in contrast to \\"Ignorance\\" and \\"Want\\" from the Dickens original) and Huch qoy'wI' (literally \\"one who begs for money\\") requesting assistance for the sons and daughters of fallen warriors, were added to the script. Also, new sections of narration provided transition for the scenes involving the Ghost of Khaless Yet-to-Come. Marc Okrand, creator of the Klingon language, reviewed the script in this year and introduced new words - including quvHa'ghach (corruption) and SaHHa'ghach (apathy) - which were needed for the play. Chris Lipscombe made further revisions, improving the Klingon translation.  Productions  = Premiere = Bat'leth fight from premiere production of A Klingon Christmas Carol in 2007 with Brian Watson-Jones as vred (left) and Scot Moore as Warrior 2 (right).

In 2010, a new set of costumes was commissioned, designed by Jeff Stolz. These costumes were also used for the first Cincinnati production, in 2013. A new puppet was designed and constructed for the first Chicago production by Kat Pleviak, of Sea Beast Puppet Company. Beginning with the original production in 2007, the production design for A Klingon Christmas Carol included costumes reminiscent of medieval Earth and a very minimal set construction. Commedia Beauregard reinvented the production design for their 2013 production with costumes that had a more Victorian feel (by kClare Kemock) and a multi-level set design (by Ian Mostrom). = Sound design = Sound design for the premiere production was provided by Derek Sandbeck. In 2010, a musical score for the play was commissioned for the first time. This score was composed by Mike Hallenbeck and used in the Minnesota and Chicago Productions. In 2011, a new score was commissioned and composed by Jon Silpayamanant. This score was used for the 2011 and 2012 Chicago productions, the 2013 Hugo West Theatricals production in Cincinnati, OH, and the 2014 WSC Avant Bard production in Washington D.C. Sound design and original music for the reimagined 2013 and final 2014 Commedia Beauregard Chicago productions and the 2014 The Arts' Nest production in Minnesota was provided by Joe Griffin, of Toxic Bag Productions.

After briefly working for a small firm in Oakland, he joined California Rural Legal Assistance (CRLA). Over time, Yeghiayan rose from junior attorney to become the Northern California Regional Director of the CRLA. Due to his experience, in 1974 President Richard Nixon appointed him as the Special Assistant for International Operations to Director of ACTION. He was later appointed assistant director to the Peace Corps and remained in this position until 1980. Yeghiayan was made responsible for the establishment and management in formulating policy, agency planning, conducting liaison with foreign and domestic governmental and private organizations and individuals, and encouragement of voluntary service programs within the United States and abroad.

Class-action lawsuits In 1987, Yeghiayan came across a passage in the memoirs of Henry Morgenthau, Sr., the American Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1913‚Äì16, describing an exchange between him and Mehmed Talat Pasha, the man chiefly held responsible for the Armenian Genocide.Bobelian. Children of Armenia, p. 208. The text in question spoke of Talat's and, by extension, the state's interest in claiming as beneficiaries the life insurance policies of the Armenians who had perished during the genocide. The Armenians had purchased these policies from New York Life and Equitable Life of New York prior to the beginning of the war and, after exploring the issue more in depth, Yeghiayan came to the conclusion that New York Life, as well as other insurance companies, had withheld death benefits totaling in the tens of millions from the descendants of the deceased.Bobelian. Children of Armenia, pp. 208‚Äì209.Bazyler, Michael J. (2003). Holocaust Justice: The Battle for Restitution in America's Courts. New York and London: New York University Press, pp. 317-20. After gathering evidence and finding several descendants of the victims, in 1999 he filed a class action lawsuit against New York Life in a case which lasted for four years. In January 2004, New York Life agreed to settle by paying $20 million to the plaintiffs.Weinstein, Henry. \\"Insurer Settles Armenian Genocide Suit.\\" Los Angeles Times. January 29, 2004. Retrieved December 19, 2010. Since then Yeghiayan, has filed additional suits against other insurance companies, including AXA (with co-counsel Brian Kabateck), which agreed to settle in 2005 by paying $17.5 million, and Deutsche Bank.Vartanian, Hrag. \\"The Aftermath of the New York Life Insurance Settlement .\\" AGBU Magazine.

In September 2008, Yeghiayan filed suit against the National Archives and Records Administration of the United States, seeking documents from 1914 to 1925 relating to the Armenian Genocide, following the administrations failed response to his repeated request to procure information. In June 2010, Yeghiayan filed on behalf of the Western Prelacy of the Armenian Church suit against the J. Paul Getty Museum for the return of eight thirteenth-century Armenian illuminated manuscript folios, the work of Armenian manuscript illuminator Toros Roslin, the first such case in the United States that the return of cultural or religious objects stolen during the Armenian Genocide.

He was the founder and principal of the rival New Veterinary College (1873‚Äì1904), originally housed in Gayfield House, Edinburgh. He wrote several standard works on veterinary science. Life Williams was born in Bontnewydd near St Asaph, north Wales, in 1832. As with many early vets, he appears to have had a background in farriery. He enrolled in the new Dick Veterinary College in Edinburgh under William Dick in 1855.The New Veterinary College, Edinburgh, 1873‚Äì1904, C. M. Warwick and A. A. MacDonald He qualified MRCVS in 1857, and set up a veterinary practice in Bradford, Yorkshire, England. In 1867 he returned to his alma mater in Edinburgh to become third principal of the Dick Veterinary College, replacing the brief principalship of Colonel James H. B. Hallen FRSE who was urgently called to India to address an outbreak of cattle plague. Walter George Burnett Dickinson FRSE was amongst his many students. In 1868 Williams was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh his proposer being Sir William Turner. In January 1869 he and fellow veterinary professor Allen Dalzell were sued in the Scottish Court of session by a former colleague, John Adam McBride, leading to a great deal of ill-will in the college.Cases Decided in the Court of Session, 1869, no.168 A lot of the ill- will focussed upon Mary Dick, William Dick's sister, who held a high degree of control over the college after her brother's death.https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1842/2198/New%20Vet%20College%20web.pdf?sequenc In 1873 Williams founded the New Veterinary College in Edinburgh, in direct competition to William Dick's College. The new college was housed in Gayfield House on East London Street.The Veterinary Record: 27 September 2003 His staff included Dr Stevenson Macadam.https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1842/2198/New%20Vet%20College%20web.pdf?sequenc In 1883, due to growing success, the College commissioned William Hamilton Beattie to design a purpose-built building on the east side of Elm Row, at the head of Leith Walk where it remained until closure in 1904. The building, later also serving as a BBC Scotland studio, is now converted into student housing. Williams died on 12 November 1900, at 1 Crawford Place, Edinburgh. He was interred at Warriston Cemetery. His white marble stone is flat to the ground and disappearing from view. It lies on the upper section of the vaults to the west side. Family Williams married Caroline Owen. Her death in 1867 affected Williams greatly. Their son William Owen Williams FRSE (1860‚Äì1911) was also a veterinarian and worked with his father at the Elm Row college. Following his father's death the college lost momentum and in 1904 William Owen Williams moved to Liverpool to set up a new veterinary college, being officially Professor of Veterinary Medicine and Surgery at Liverpool University. Artistic Recognition Williams was one of twenty \\"shadow portraits\\" created in 2005 of the various Dick Vet Principals.

The first lifeboat was stationed on Mudeford Quay 1963 and the present station was opened in 2003. It operates an inshore lifeboat (ILB). History During the 1960s the RNLI deployed inflatable ILBs at places around the coast where a quick response to increasing numbers of leisure boats and water users could not be made by larger all-weather lifeboats (ALBs) at stations established to serve commercial shipping. Mudeford Quay, at the entrance to Christchurch Harbour, was selected as a suitable place and a small inflatable boat provided. This type of boat could only operate in relatively good conditions and were seldom used in the winter. As their usefulness was proven some stations received an 'intermediate' ILB which could operate in more severe conditions. One of these boats was stationed at Mudeford in 1981, a new boathouse being opened for it on 28 June. In 1988 the crew facilities were improved and the following year a new type of boat arrived. This was a B Class rigid-hulled inflatable. In 2003 a new boathouse and crew facilities were opened on 25 October. Description The crew facilities are in a two- storey building. This is rendered and has a tile roof; large first floor windows at both ends give views across the water. Adjoining this and at right angles is the boathouse. This is built of timber with large windows along one side that allow visitors to see the lifeboat inside. The roof is metal with large skylights. The boat doors open onto a concrete platform and shallow slipway. Area of operation The can go out in Force 6/7 winds (Force 5/6 at night) and can operate at up to for 2¬Ω hours. Adjacent lifeboats are at Lymington Lifeboat Station to the east, and Poole Lifeboat Station to the west. If a larger ALB is needed in the area it will come from Swanage.

Originally known as \\"Littledean Roman Camp\\" or just \\"Roman Camp\\" whilst once thought to have had Roman origins (as reflected in older Ordinance maps), 20th century archaeology has shown that the castle was built in the 11th century following the Norman invasion of 1066.Scott-Garrett, p.58. The castle was positioned on high ground overlooking the Severn valley and the town of Littledean.Scott-Garrett, p.48. In addition to protecting the local villages, the castle was probably intended to operate with the castles at Glasshouse Woods and Howle Hill Camp as a screen to protect the city of Gloucester from military threats from Wales.Scott-Garrett, pp.59-60. Today, only the outer wall earthworks remain and be clearly seen. Trees are growing throughout the remains of the Castle, and due to its listing as a scheduled monument, the site is not maintained. However, the collection of trees that cover the earthworks stand out from the surrounding fields, allowing this hilltop site (elevation ~600m) to be clearly seen from many miles away. The castle itself is circular and relatively small, some 60 ft in diameter, with an inner and an outer bailey, the latter protected by a very tall vallum wall.Scott-Garrett, pp.48-9. The outer wall has surviving earthworks 12 ft high; originally it would have been 15 ft tall. Uniquely for a castle of this period the outer wall has a motte integrated into the design, rather than located at the centre of the castle; this was probably designed to act as a combination of look-out tower and keep. The entrance to the castle was from the south.Scott-Garrett, p.49. Littledean castle was not occupied for long and by the time of the Anarchy in the middle of the 12th century had already been abandoned for several years, being referred to as the \\"Old Castle of Dean\\".

The Mission Covenant Church in Skien is seen as the direct offspring of this dissident congregation. Overseas missions In Hong Kong and Macau, the church is known by its Chinese name: Jƒ´d≈´ji√†o Sh√®ngyuƒì J√†ohu√¨ (Âü∫Áù£ÊïôËÅñÁ¥ÑÊïôÊúÉ).

It is located in Rockville, Soweto, a populous black urban residential area within the city of Johannesburg. Due to the role it played as a place of gathering for the people of Soweto in the years before, during, and after the anti-apartheid struggle, it is often referred to as \\"the people's church\\" or \\"the people's cathedral\\". The church is located in the middle of Soweto, in Rockville, in the neighbourhood of Moroka; it was built in 1964, replacing Moroka's former parish church. While the A-shaped exterior of the building is quite ordinary in design, its main feature is the vast interior, that can accommodate as many as 5000-7000 people. The stained-glass windows are decorated with scenes of Mary's life and were donated by Poland in 1998. One of the most prominent artifacts in the church is the painting entitled \\"The Madonna and Child of Soweto\\", mostly referred to as \\"The Black Madonna\\",Soweto, South Africa: The Madonna and Child of Soweto depicting a black Virgin Mary holding the Child Jesus (also black). The painting was created by artist Larry Scully in 1973, as a part of a campaign to raise funds for the education of black South Africans. The painting was then bought by a benefactor and donated to the church. A highly symbolic element of the painting is a large eye right under the Black Madonna. According to journalist Mpho Lukoto of newspaper The Star, the pupil of the eye represents the township of Soweto; two forks directed towards the pupil from the sides represent the violence that was used against the people of Soweto during the apartheid era, and the cross in the center of the pupil represents the Church that illuminates the people with hope.The Star, 23 March 2004, quoted in Soweto After the end of apartheid, a large park was built before the church, with a fountain and memorials, including a \\"peace pole\\" donated to the church by Japanese Christians. The church is still a popular place for the people of Soweto and it has also become a prominent tourist attraction in the area. Regina Mundi and the anti-apartheid movement Regina Mundi played a pivotal role in the struggle against apartheid in the second half of the 20th century.Joburg's great places of worship Since political meetings in most public places were banned, the church became the main place where Soweto people could meet and discuss. Even funerals often ended up as political meetings. For this reason, Regina Mundi earned the reputation of being one of the main centres of anti-apartheid activism in the province of Gauteng. During the Soweto uprising of June 16, 1976, when students were shot by the police in Orlando West (with Hector Pieterson and others being killed), many demonstrants fled to Regina Mundi. The police entered the church, firing live ammunition. No one was killed, although many were injured and the church itself, as well as its furniture, decorations, and symbols (for example the marble altar and the statue of Christ), were damaged. Both the interior and the external walls of the church still bear the signs of the shootings. After the end of apartheid, from 1995 to 1998, several meetings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission were held in the church, presided over by Archbishop Desmond Tutu. From 1995 on, funds were raised to restore the church. The campaign eventually collected 1.5 million rands, and restorations were made. The events of 1976 are commemorated by a dedicated ceremony held in the church every year on June 16. Regina Mundi Day In 1997, President Nelson Mandela established 30 November as \\"Regina Mundi Day\\" to honour the church.Regina Mundi - Queen of Soweto Bill Clinton's visit and controversy In March 1998, Regina Mundi was visited by the President of the United States of America Bill Clinton with his wife Hillary. Their visit was controversial as they received Holy Communion in the church despite not being Catholics. Clinton's visit was also widely covered by the media because the sermon mostly revolved on the topic of adultery, seemingly to the discomfort of President Clinton who was at the time involved in the Lewinsky scandal. Visit of Michelle Obama First Lady of the United States Michelle Obama visited the church on the South Africa leg of her tour of the continent. She addressed the Young African Women Leaders Forum at the church, and in attendance were the Archbishop of Johannesburg and other women leaders.

Darnley Naylor - then the Hughes Professor of Classics - anticipated that a future and \\"much-needed Classical and Historical Museum\\" would incorporate a recent donation of ancient coins to the university. Further coin collections were added between the wars. It was only in the 1960s, however, that the Classics Dept acquired a display case and a small collection of antiquities, mostly Greek pottery, which were housed within the Dept. As the teaching of Greek and Roman archaeology grew at Adelaide, so too did the collection. In 1979, students and staff created a large model of Athens for a temporary exhibition within the University. By 1980, the Classics' collection had clearly outgrown its location, and the university agreed to house it within the grand Henry Basten Room, upstairs in the historic Mitchell Building on North Terrace. It opened to the public in 1983, under the directorship of Dr. Frank Sear. Staffing was provided by the Department. In addition to objects owned by the university, the new Museum of Classical Archaeology included Greek and Roman objects on long-term loans from the store-rooms of the South Australia Museum and the Art Gallery of South Australia. This generous collaboration continues to this day. The Greek community in Adelaide has long supported the Dept in its teaching and outreach activities. The committee of the longstanding Greek Glendi Festival donated some forty casts of sculptures from the Greek Government. They were too numerous to fit into the Henry Basten Room, and so its foyer area was adapted to showcase these Classical and Hellenistic casts. To celebrate the opening of the Museum in September, 1983, the University Foundation funded the acquisition of a Corinthian bronze helmet - a type that was popular in the 6th century BC - whilst Prof. A. D. Trendall donated a Campanian late Classical lekythos by the Pagenstecher Group. The \\"Friends of the Museum\\" was also launched at the opening, to support the outreach programme of public talks about classical archaeology, and to raise money for further acquisitions. An opportunity presented itself the next year, when the personal collection of the late Arthur Dannatt came on the market in Adelaide. With the substantial support of the Friends, his collection was added to the Museum in its entirety. In so doing, the Museum expanded its cultural horizons, for Dannatt had acquired not only Greek, Etruscan and Roman small objects, but also objects from Egypt and Mesopotamia. In the early 1990s, Sear took up the Chair of Classics at the University of Melbourne. Under the directorship of his successor, Dr. Margaret O'Hea, Near Eastern cultures have been added to the Museum, including material donated by Sydney University's excavations at Pella. The Museum continues to grow as a result of private donations. Financial considerations in the 1990s made it impossible to continue to keep the Museum open, but school groups can pay to visit the museum, and in recent years, the enthusiasm of the Alumni Volunteers of the University have made it possible to re-open the Museum on the first Tuesday of the month during the academic year. The Museum now has a Facebook page, and public archaeology lectures in Adelaide are advertised there and on Eventbrite.  Highlights  Egyptian artifacts include a representative collection of funerary amulets, figurines and funerary equipment from the New Kingdom to the Late Period. On permanent loan from the Student Union is a fragmentary table of offerings and stele from New Kingdom Egypt, acquired at the start of the 20th century by Lady Symons. Some pottery from graves excavated by John Garstang at Beni Hassan in Middle Egypt is also on loan here from the SA Museum and AGSA. The Near Eastern collection includes Paleolithic and Neolithic stone tools from the 1994-1996 Pella Hinterland Survey in the north Jordan Valley and pottery from Bronze Age and Iron Age tombs excavated by the Sydney University Expedition to Pella in Jordan. There is also pottery, some cuneiform tablets and figurines from the site of Ur in southern Mesopotamia. The Eastern Mediterranean is also represented by a representative range of Early Bronze Age to Iron Age pottery from Cyprus. In addition to pottery and lamps from the Late Bronze Age to Hellenistic periods, the Greek collection includes both the Corinthian bronze helmet, mentioned above, and a fragment of a Late Classical marble lekythos from Attica, showing the deceased Leonike and her husband Kalliphanes (Clairmont Catalogue 7.330). Italian cultures before the rise of Rome are also represented, particularly Villanovan and Etruscan pottery and bronzes. The painted terracotta sarcophagus (Gentili Catalogue B150) dates from the period of Roman domination of Etruria (modern Tuscany), showing a young man reclining as if for a feast on its lid. Highlights of the Roman collection include small bronze figurines from Gaul and Egypt, as well as marble funerary sculptures. Objects from Roman and early Byzantine Egypt also include terracotta figurines (on loan from SAM), a fragment of Coptic textile and a souvenir pilgrim flask of Saint Menas. A small number of early Islamic and mediaeval objects are also on display, to highlight the continuity and changes of material culture in the post-Roman world. There is also a wide-ranging display of glassware, from Mycenaean flat beads, a core-formed aryballos of the Classical period, to Roman and Byzantine blown and mould-blown vessels.

He spent several years in the military service in the Soviet Army and then continued his theology studies, graduating from the seminary in 1962. He was ordained priest by Bishop Petras Ma≈æelis on 18 April 1962. He ministered as vicar in the parishes of Alytus, Lazdijai, Kudirkos Naumiestis, Prienai, Simnas. In 1968 he entered the Society of Jesus, which was then illegal under Soviet law. Tamkeviƒçius was among the initiators of the petition action protesting the Soviet discriminating restrictions on the Kaunas Seminary. Because of that Soviet authorities forbade Tamkeviƒçius from exercising his ministry. He worked in a factory and in the land-reclamation area for one year. While vicar in Simnas parish, Tamkeviƒçius initiated the underground publication of the Chronicle of the Catholic Church of Lithuania in 1972.

It has been established in 2004 as an amalgamation of several villages and settlements along the main road between Oshikango and Ohangwena which are both also part of the town. Helao Nafidi has 19,375 inhabitants. The town is separated into three urban areas, Oshikango in the north, bisected by the Namibian‚ÄìAngolan border, and Omafo and Ohangwena south of it, with settlements and villages in the agricultural area between them. All the villages that have been combined to form the town (Onhuno, Ohangwena, Omafo, Engela and Oshikango) still maintained their own village councils until the 2015 local authority election. History The area that today is the town of Helao Nafidi was heavily affected by the South African Border War 1966 to 1989 between South Africa and its allied forces (mainly UNITA) and the Angolan government and South-West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO). The border post at Oshikango, one of the oldest between Namibia and Angola, had been near destroyed in the guerrilla war, and the settlement appeared dilapidated until the mid-1990s. After Namibian independence several settlements were proclaimed villages in 1996 in order to increase border trade. Economy The border post at Oshikango is the busiest Namibian border post with on average 500 people crossing per day. This has brought business opportunities to the surrounding area. With the help of the European Union an Export Processing Zone was established there, consisting of 14 warehouses. Omafo, another suburb of Helao Nafidi, hosts an annual trade show. The parallel prevalence of land owned by the villages, the town, and land under traditional jurisdiction has led to uncertainties about ownership that had to be settled in court. The case of Helao Nafidi, where traditional authorities and the town and village councils frequently disagree on what is in their respective jurisdiction, can be seen as an example of the clash between tradition and modernity in Namibian law. =Transport= In mid-2005, the second stage of the new Northern Railway began construction from Oshivelo to Oshikango. By mid-2006, it had reached Ondangwa. A train called Omugulugwombashe Star traveled weekly on this track until the locomotives broke down after a few rounds of service and were found unsuitable for Namibia‚Äôs railway network. The railway extension to Ohangwena and Oshikango is under construction, and a short extension across the border was proposed in 2008 to bypass the congested border post. Politics Helao Nafidi is governed by a town council that has seven seats. The 2015 local authority election was won by SWAPO which gained six seats (2,261 votes). The remaining seat was won by the Rally for Democracy and Progress (RDP) with 272 votes. Eliaser Nghipangelwa retained his position as mayor of the Helao Nafidi Town Council, and is once again being deputised by Panduleni Hainghumbi. People Helao Nafidi is inhabited by the Kwanyama community, a subgroup of the Ovambo. Members of this community live on both sides of the border and speak the same language. In the years 2005 and thereafter, foreign investors, mainly Chinese, have bought communal land in large quantities, leaving villagers without the means to raise livestock and farm. Some of the land transfers are thought to be unlawful, facilitated by corrupt town officials. The influx of Chinese businesspeople has been dubbed an \\"invasion\\".

While Homicide and Romero went after the World Title, Reyes wanted a tag title shot against Tony Mamaluke and Sal Rinauro. He picked Homicide as his partner, but they did not win. In late 2005, Reyes began fighting students from the ROH Wrestling School. They were no challenge for him, and he defeated them all quickly. He claimed that no one could escape his Dragon Sleeper. These actions angered then head trainer Austin Aries of Generation Next. At Hell Freezes Over, Austin Aries of Generation Next challenged Reyes to a match. After Aries pinned Reyes, Reyes would not release a sleeper hold and Roderick Strong, a fellow Generation Next member, came out to break things up. A return match was held at Best in the World.

The Coinage of the Republic of Venice include the coins produced by the Republic of Venice from the late 12th century to 1866. After this date, coins were still produced in Venice. From the 16th century, the coinage was made in the very prominently- located Zecca of Venice, close to the Doge's Palace. History Although there is no information about coinage in what was the Duchy of Venice (a semi- independent entity within the Byzantine Empire from which the Republic of Venice originated), ancient historians such as Andrea Dandolo and Marin Sanudo mention that the privilege of coinage was given to Venice by the kings of Italy Rudolph II (in 921) and Berengar II (in 950); however, it is more likely that this privilege had been granted by Byzantine emperors,Dizionario di erudizione storico-ecclesiastica, pag. 237 as coins with the names of Venice and the name of German emperors Louis I (814-840) and Lothair I (840-855) had been already in circulation before the aforementioned dates. From around 1031, there are records of coins minted under doge Ottone Orseolo, while in 1193-1202 Enrico Dandolo issued in Venice the silver coin called Matapan, named after the Greek promontory. The most common type of Venetian coin is the ducati issued in silver and gold. The gold ducato was later known as zecchino; this had the doge's image receiving the standard from St. Mark on the obverse. The zecchino had on the reverse Christ within an oval (mandorla), which also contained nine stars. The zecchini remained unchanged from the first issue, in 1284, to the last one, during the reign of the last doge of Venice in 1796, Ludovico Manin. See Zecca of Venice for the organization and operations of the mint in the Renaissance and the remaining centuries of the Venetian Republic. Coins The main coins minted during the Republic of Venice include: *silver ducato (or Matapan), minted for the first time between 1193 and 1202; it was one of the first grossi. *soldo, in silver, minted during the reign of doge Francesco Dandolo (1328‚Äì1339) and doge Giovanni Gradenigo (1355-1356). *lira (including lira Tron), minted from 1472. *ducato, minted from 1284, with the same weight and title of Florence's florin. From the 16th century onwards it was called zecchino. *giustina, name of different types of silver coins minted under doge Alvise II Mocenigo in 1572. A giustina minore (\\"lesser giustina\\") was minted under Pasquale Cicogna). *scudo, both in silver and gold. It showed the city's symbol. The golden scudo was minted for the first time in the 16th century and weighed some 3.40 g *gazzetta, of the value of 2 soldi. *quartarolo, a small coin with the value of one quarter denaro, minted for the first time under Enrico Dandolo (1192), and discontinued in 1328. *tallero, used for overseas trades. Other types included the osella, a medal-coin awarded by the doge to the Republic's main personalities. The mint of the Republic's coins was located in Venice, in the Palazzo della Zecca.

These volumes appeared together in the collection The Necklace of Princess Fiorimonde ‚Äì The Complete Fairy Stories of Mary de Morgan, published by Victor Gollancz Ltd in 1963, with an introduction by Roger Lancelyn Green. Though de Morgan is one of the lesser known authors of literary fairytales, her works, heavily influenced by Hans Christian Andersen, are remarkable in deviating from the fairytale norm ‚Äì often not including a happy ending, or not having the protagonist gain wealth or power (rather procuring the wisdom of recognising the value of living without these things); and in the satirical element of political comment in her works.Marilyn Pemberton \\"Mary de Morgan: Out of the Morrisian Shadow \\", University of Warwick According to the Greenwood Encyclopedia of Folk Tales and Fairy Tales, the fairytales of Mary de Morgan played a \\"comprehensive and central role\\" in her era in the evolution of the literary fairytale.

Biography  Mary de Morgan, the youngest daughter of distinguished mathematician Augustus de Morgan, was born in 7 Camden Street, London, on 24 February 1850.Introduction to The Necklace of Princess Fiorimonde ‚Äì The Complete Fairy Stories of Mary De Morgan, Victor Gollancz Ltd, 1963 In her youth, Mary earned herself a reputation for tactlessness, apparently at one point telling Henry Holiday, \\"All artists are fools! Look at yourself and Mr. Solomon!\\" Mrs. Poynter, wife of the artist Edward Poynter, wrote in a letter to her sister Alice, \\"She chattered awfully, and Louie, she is only just fifteen. I believe a judicious course of snubbing would do her good!\\" She also apparently said something to offend a young Bernard Shaw who, according to Lancelyn Green, \\"hated her exceedingly\\". Following her father's death in 1871, she resided with her brother William in his Chelsea house until his marriage in 1887, after which she lived in lodgings, making a living as a typist. Mostly during her time living with William, Mary told stories to her own nephews and nieces, as well as to the children of friends and family, many among them artists and writers of note. Jenny and May Morris, children of William Morris; a young Rudyard Kipling and his sister, as well as their cousins, the Burne-Joneses and the Mackails. Angela Thirkell, n√©e Mackail, and her brother, Denis Mackail, both novelists, were treated to the stories of Mary de Morgan in their youth. William Morris was fond of her stories, and when he was dying in 1896, Mary came to nurse him. The Windfairies, published in 1900, was her last collection of fairytales. de Morgan died of tuberculosis in Cairo, Egypt, in 1907.AIM25 text-only browsing: Senate House Library, University of London: De Morgan family.

These views are reflected in her fairytales, which often have strong female protagonists (often outwitting or rescuing men), and, in the case of The Toy Princess, have been interpreted as mocking society's expectations of women (though the fictitious kingdom of the story places the same expectations upon its men.) Renowned socialist William Morris was a close family friend; indeed, Mary told some of her stories to his children, and it has been suggested that his politics influenced her writings: she ridicules mass- production in \\"Siegfried and Handa\\" and \\"The Bread of Discontent\\", both of which show beings of evil intent behind a community's turn from well-made, hand-crafted goods to poor-quality mass-produced goods, with disastrous consequences. This has been interpreted as a criticism of capitalism. de Morgan's stories also often contain the theme of wealth and power being shown to be negative attributes ‚Äì an attitude which resonates with her remark quoted in Roger Lancelyn Green's introduction to her work: \\"I am so thankful I have only a small income ‚Äì it is so delightful planning things and deciding what one can afford. It would bore me to death to be rich!\\"  Fairytales  = On a Pincushion = In the collection On a Pincushion, the first three stories are held within a frame story in which a brooch, a shawl-pin and a pin on a pincushion are telling each other tales to pass the time.

It was the main settlement (or caput) of the feudal barony of William Peverel, known as the Honour of Peverel,Sanders, I.J., English Baronies, Oxford, 1960, p.136 and was founded some time between the Norman Conquest of 1066 and its first recorded mention in the Domesday Survey of 1086, by Peverel, who held lands in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire as a tenant-in-chief of the king. The town became the economic centre of the barony. The castle has views across the Hope Valley and Cave Dale. William Peveril the Younger inherited his father's estates, but in 1155 they were confiscated by King Henry II. While in royal possession, Henry visited the castle in 1157, 1158, and 1164, the first time hosting King Malcolm IV of Scotland. During the Revolt of 1173‚Äì1174, the castle's garrison was increased from a porter and two watchmen to a force led by 20 knights shared with the castles of Bolsover and Nottingham. The Earls of Derby had a claim to the Peveril family's estates through marriage, and in 1199 William de Ferrers, the fourth earl, paid 2,000 marks for the Peak lordship, although the castle remained under royal control. The closest Peveril Castle came to seeing battle was in 1216, when King John gave the castle to William de Ferrers, but the castellan refused to relinquish control. Although they were both John's supporters, the king authorised the earl to use force to evict the castellan, who eventually capitulated, although there is no evidence that the castle was assaulted. In 1223 the castle returned to the Crown. In the 13th century there were periods of building work at the castle, and by 1300 its final form had been established. Toward the end of the 14th century, the barony was granted to John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster. Having little use for the castle, he ordered some of its material to be stripped out for re-use, marking the beginning of its decline. From the time of John of Gaunt to the present day, the castle has been owned and administered by the Duchy of Lancaster. Peveril Castle became less important administratively, and by 1609 it was \\"very ruinous and serveth for no use\\". In the 19th century, Sir Walter Scott featured the castle in his novel Peveril of the Peak. The site is situated in a national park, and cared for by English Heritage. Peveril Castle is protected as a scheduled monument and a Grade I listed building. History Peveril Castle stands on a limestone outcrop overlooking the west end of Hope Valley, in the midst of an ancient landscape. Overlooking the head of the valley, 2 km to the west, is Mam Tor, a Bronze Age hill fort, and to the east at Brough-on-Noe is the Roman fort of Navio. The valley formed a natural line of communication and had extra importance due to valuable mineral resources in the area, particularly lead. =From the Norman Conquest= The small Hope Castle lay halfway along the valley. The castle's founder, William Peveril, was a follower of William the Conqueror and was rewarded for supporting him during the Norman Conquest. The first mention of him in England records that in 1068 he was granted the new castle at Nottingham by William the Conqueror, who was in the process of subduing the Midlands and northern England. An unsubstantiated legend states that Peveril was William's illegitimate son. By the Domesday Book of 1086, Peveril had become a powerful landowner, with holdings in Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. The exact year he founded the castle is uncertain, although it must have been started by 1086 as it is recorded in the Domesday Book, one of 48 castles mentioned in the survey and the only one in Derbyshire. The castle was recorded as standing at Pechesers which has been translated as both \\"Peak's Tail\\" and \\"Peak's Arse\\". Although the earliest Norman castles were usually built in timber, Peveril Castle seems to have been designed from outset to be built in stone. Peveril Castle's keep dates from around the 12th century. William Peveril had custody of royal lands such as the district of Hope, and although he had his own estates, he relied on continued royal favour to maintain power in this way. In 1100 the new king, Henry I, granted William \\"his demesne in the Peak\\". Thus the Peak became an independent lordship under William Peveril's control, and the castle became an important centre of administration for the area, allowing the collection of taxes. Castleton benefited from the castle's new status and began to grow as the lordship's economic heart. William Peveril died in 1114 and was succeeded by his son, William Peveril the Younger. In the civil war known as The Anarchy between King Stephen and the Empress Matilda, Peveril backed the losing side and his fortunes suffered after his capture at the Battle of Lincoln in 1141. In 1153 Peveril was suspected of attempting to poison Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester. In 1153 the future King Henry II accused Peveril of \\"plundering and treachery\\" and threatened to confiscate his estates and hand them over to the Earl of Chester. Two years later Henry, now king, followed through his threat. The Earl of Chester was dead by this time, and the king kept the property for himself. Once under royal control, Peveril became the administrative centre of the Forest of High Peak. William Peveril the Younger died in 1155, and as his only male heir had predeceased him, the family's claim on the confiscated estates was taken up by the husband of William's daughter, Margaret Peveril. Margaret had married Robert de Ferrers, 2nd Earl of Derby. King Henry II visited Peveril Castle three times during his reign. During the first visit, in 1157, he hosted King Malcolm IV of Scotland who paid homage to Henry after ceding Cumberland and Westmorland to the English king. Henry II visited again in 1158 and 1164. When a group of barons led by Henry's sons Henry the Young King, Geoffrey, Duke of Brittany, and Prince Richard, later Richard the Lionheart, took part in the Revolt of 1173‚Äì1174 against the king's rule, the king spent ¬£116 on building work at Peveril and Bolsover Castles in Derbyshire. The garrison was also increased. Previously Peveril was guarded by two watchmen and a porter, but this was expanded to a force led by 20 knights shared with Bolsover and Nottingham castles during the revolt. After the revolt ended in 1174, further steps were taken to improve Peveril Castle, and the Pipe Rolls (records of royal expenditure) show that between 1175 and 1177 ¬£184 was spent on building the keep. Building in stone was expensive, and though Peveril's keep was small, moderately-sized stone castles such as the contemporary Orford could cost thousands of pounds. Henry II's average income during his reign has been estimated to be around ¬£10,000 per year. As few documents have survived, it is uncertain when parts of the castle were built, and archaeological investigations have been unsuccessful in dating the stonework. Henry II died in 1189 and was succeeded by his son, Richard the Lionheart. Soon after his coronation, Richard granted the lordship of the Peak, including the castle, to his brother John. While Richard was on crusade, John rebelled and on his return Richard confiscated the lordship. John became king in 1199 after Richard's death. William de Ferrers, 4th Earl of Derby maintained the claim of the Earls of Derby to the Peveril estates. He paid King John 2000 marks (¬£1333) for the lordship of the Peak, but the Crown retained possession of Peveril and Bolsover Castles. John finally gave Ferrers these castles in 1216 to secure his support in the face of country-wide rebellion. However, the castellan Brian de Lisle refused to hand them over. Although de Lisle and Ferrers were both King John's supporters, the king gave Ferrers permission to use force to retake the castles. =Henry III= The situation was still chaotic when King Henry III became king after his father's death in 1216. Although Bolsover fell to Ferrers' forces in 1217 after a siege, there is no indication that Peveril was assaulted, and it is likely that Brian de Lisle negotiated his surrender. Ferrers only had possession of the lordship until King Henry III came of age. When the time came he was reluctant to hand over the property, and after an initial deadlock the Crown took control in 1223. Although contemporary Pipe Roll records of expenditure at Peveril survive, they do not specify how the money was spent. As a result, it is unclear what constitutes maintenance and what marks substantial construction work; however, Richard Eales, who wrote the 2006 English Heritage guidebook, suggests that there were two periods of building, when sums spent were larger than usual: ¬£54 in 1204‚Äì1207 and ¬£67 in 1210‚Äì1212. The medieval historian Sidney Painter estimated that in about 1200 there were only seven magnates in England whose annual income exceeded ¬£400 and a knight could easily live on ¬£10 to ¬£20 per year. Map of the area from The Growth of the English House by John Alfred Gotch, 1909 The rest of the 13th century was relatively peaceful, and records show that Peveril Castle was maintained by the Crown. In 1235, in preparation for the king's visit, the north wall and bridge were repaired. After significant work in 1250‚Äì52 (¬£60 spent), 1272‚Äì1275 (¬£40) and 1288‚Äì1290 (¬£151), it is likely that the castle buildings were complete by 1300. King Henry gave Prince Edward (later King Edward I) Peveril Castle along with the County Palatine of Chester with the royal holdings in Wales and Ireland. Some of the lands, including Peveril, were made part of Eleanor of Castile's dower, to come into her possession should her husband, Prince Edward, die. At this time, the Peak lordship was worth around ¬£300 a year. At the outbreak of the Second Barons' War in 1264, Peveril Castle was occupied by Robert de Ferrers, 6th Earl of Derby. Simon de Montfort pressured King Henry III into giving him Peveril, although it was recovered by the Crown after De Montfort's death in 1265. The castle was returned to Eleanor's dower, and as she predeceased her husband the lordship returned into royal hands. Its income was used to provide for members of the royal family such as King Edward II's queen, Isabella of France, and their children, and royal favourites such as Piers Gaveston. In 1331 Edward III gave the lordship to his wife, Philippa of Hainault. It was given to John de Warenne, 7th Earl of Surrey, in 1345. After its return to the Crown, the estate was given to John of Gaunt, Edward III's third surviving son, partially in exchange for the Earldom of Richmond. =The Lancastrians= John of Gaunt's ownership marked the start of Peveril Castle's decline. He was the richest nobleman in England and held several castles. As Peveril Castle was relatively unimportant, John decided not to maintain it and in 1374 gave orders to strip the lead from the buildings for re-use at Pontefract Castle. It was inherited by his son Henry Bolingbroke, later King Henry IV, and remained under royal control, administered by the Duchy of Lancaster. During the 15th century, Peveril became less important as administrative functions were moved elsewhere. Although other castles administered by the Duchy of Lancaster were repaired in 1480, there is no indication that this happened at Peveril. A survey conducted for the Duchy in 1561 revealed that Peveril was in a state of decay, and as a result, along with Donnington, was one of two castles that were subsequently abandoned. The castle however hosted local courts until 1600. A survey in 1609 found that Peveril was \\"very ruinous and serveth for no use\\". At some point in the post- medieval period the keep's facing stone was removed from three sides. The steep slope prevented the removal of the stone from the fourth side. At one point, the castle was used to house animals. =Modern era= With the advent of the railways in the 19th century, the area became a tourist attraction. The Duchy of Lancaster undertook maintenance in the 19th century to ensure the castle's condition did not deteriorate further, mostly by clearing rubble and adding mortar. Sir Walter Scott's 1823 novel Peveril of the Peak, set in the mid 17th century, described the castle ruins. In 1932 the Duchy gave custody of the castle to the Office of Works, while retaining ownership. The site is today cared for by English Heritage, the successor to the Office of Works. The surrounding landscape has been protected as a national park since 1951. The castle is a scheduled monument, which means it is a \\"nationally important\\" historic building and archaeological site which has been given protection against unauthorised change. It is also a Grade I listed building (first listed in 1985), and recognised as an internationally important structure. It has been described as \\"perhaps the finest medieval landmark of the Peak District\\", and architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner remarked that it is \\"By far the most important castle in the county ‚Äì in fact the only one of importance\\". Before Duffield Castle in the south of the county was destroyed in 1266 it had one of the largest keeps in England, though only the foundations survive. Layout Peveril Castle in Castleton is roughly triangular in shape, about , on top of a hill overlooking the Hope Valley. The land slopes steeply away from the castle's perimeter, forming an almost sheer face to the south east, and the winding approach from the north is the most practical way to the castle. Not only was the site naturally defensible, but its prominence would have allowed the castle to be a highly visible symbol of the builder's power. The town of Castleton provided supplies to the castle. It commands views of Hope Valley below and Treak Cliff, Mam Tor, Black Tor, and Lose Hill. The castle was entered through the gatehouse to the east. Its design was simple, wide with a passage across. Little survives, although earlier drawings contain details of mouldings that suggest the structure was built in the 12th century, perhaps by Henry II or King John. The curtain walls enclosing the castle show the multiple phases of construction at Peveril, with stonework from the Norman period ‚Äì differentiated by the use of opus spicatum ‚Äì to modern repairs. The walls were surmounted by walkways, which next to the gatehouse would have stood about above the ground level immediately outside the castle. In the 12th century, a tower projecting less than was added to the north wall. In Eales' opinion, it \\"would have been of limited military value, compared with the boldly projecting towers of later castles\\" which allowed defenders to deploy flanking fire along the base of the walls. The land within the castle slopes downwards from west to east. Water storage would have been a concern for the garrison of the castle, but how they procured water is uncertain. The southern curtain wall is a modern replacement along the line of the medieval wall. There are the remains of two round or semi-circular towers projecting from the wall. Enough of one tower survives that one can see the use of Roman tiles in the construction, probably from the fort of Navio away. It is uncertain when these towers were built, although it is thought they may date from the 13th century. Foundations mark the position of buildings abutting the south wall, probably the old hall and a chapel. A document from 1246 recorded a chapel at the castle; the remains of the easternmost building against the south wall are assumed to mark the site of the chapel, as they are oriented roughly east‚Äìwest. Foundations at the west end of the north wall mark a large building: probably a hall where the lord of the castle would have eaten and entertained high-status guests. It is unclear when the new hall was built, probably replacing the old hall in the south of the castle, although an \\"old hall\\" was mentioned in a document of 1251, implying there was also a new hall by that time. The kitchen and food stores would have stood at the east end of the hall, although little remains of those structures. Buildings were also constructed against the west curtain wall, probably high-status apartments. Although the main approach to Peveril Castle was from the north, there was also a gate in the west, reached via a bridge spanning the gorge and linking the castle with an enclosure on the other side. As it has not been excavated, the exact form the enclosure took is uncertain. Its purpose is also a matter of speculation, whether it was an elaborate outer bailey for defence or used for storage and stabling. The keep occupies the southern corner of Peveril Castle. Construction probably began in around 1176, instigated by Henry II. Its plan is square, measuring less than , and the parapet is above the keep's base; as the ground is uneven, on the other side it rises above ground level. It is smaller than contemporary royal keeps such as those at Dover and Scarborough Castles. Today the exterior is coarse, but originally the facing would have been smooth; the south-east side, where the steep natural slope prevented removal of the facing stone, gives an idea of how it may once have appeared. A projection in the south-east face of the keep housed a garderobe. As was usual with Norman keeps, Peveril's was entered through the first floor and was accessed by a staircase. This entrance level would have been a large public room and the basement used for storage. A narrow staircase in the east corner allowed access to the basement and the wall walk around the top of the keep.

In the late 1980s, Oda gained prominence as a songwriter. He composed over 50 top-ten hit singles on the Japanese Oricon chart during the 1990s, including 12 of which have sold over 1 million copies. At the commercial peak of successful career, Oda produced a string of popular hit songs with artists like Zard, Wands, Deen, and Field of View. He also discovered and collaborated with Nanase Aikawa, one of the best-selling Japanese female pop icons from the latter half of the 1990s. Oda embarked on his own solo career since the 1980s, and achieved mainstream success thanks to the contributions to other artists. As a recording artist, he is best known for the chart-topping single \\"Itsumademo Kawaranu Ai o\\", which was released in 1992. In 1990, Oda won the 32nd Japan Record Award for the song \\"Odoru Pompokorin\\", co-written by Momoko Sakura and performed by B.B. Queens. In the history of the Japanese singles chart which started in 1968, Oda has been the third best-selling composer behind Kyohei Tsutsumi and Tetsuya Komuro. Accumulated sales of his compositions released as singles have been estimated at over 40 million units as of 2008. In 2000, he was attacked by a robbery in Madrid, Spain, where he visited for sightseeing. When the neck was squeezed from behind, the vocal cords were damaged and the conventional singing voice disappeared. After a year of rehabilitation, Oda resumed the livetour in 2002.

Club career Robaina was born in Las Palmas. After starting out with local UD Las Palmas, playing mainly in Segunda Divisi√≥n B, the 20-year-old signed with CD Tenerife also in the Canary Islands in 1995, immediately having an impact in La Liga by playing 39 games as the club finished fifth and qualified to the UEFA Cup, also appearing regularly as his team reached the latter competition's semi-finals. After another average season he gradually fell out of favour with Tenerife and, in the 1999 January transfer window, returned to Las Palmas in the first of a series of loans. Robaina spent one season in Portugal with Sporting Clube de Portugal, taking no part whatsoever in the Lisbon side's national championship conquest (three games, ten minutes). In the following year he played with another team in his native region, Universidad de Las Palmas CF, suffering relegation from Segunda Divisi√≥n and being subsequently released by his main club, for which he appeared in nearly 150 competitive games.

The company is engaged in the acquisition, development and production of crude oil and natural gas in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin and in the Eagle Ford in the United States. Approximately 83% of Baytex's production is weighted toward crude oil and natural gas liquids. Baytex's common shares trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BTE. History Early on (1993‚Äì2000) the company was more focused on developing light oil and natural gas containing properties in North and SE Alberta. In Jan 19, 2006, Baytex Energy Trust announced that the New York Stock Exchange had cleared Baytex to file an Original Listing Application to list its trust units on the NYSE. The company began trading on the NYSE on March 27. In April 2008 it completed a $181 million takeover of Burmis Energy Inc, a Calgary-based oil and natural gas producer (72% of production was natural gas) that was nine times smaller than Baytex at the time. The deal gave Baytex control of the Seal heavy oil property in Alberta and increased daily production by 3,650 boe. Many key heavy oil and natural gas assets were purchased from True Energy Trust in the summer of 2009 for US$79.9 million (when the US:Cdn exchange rate was 1:1.164). The deal which included properties near Lloydminster and Kerrobert, Saskatchewan (heavy oil) and also central Alberta (natural gas) increased production and cash flow by 7% and 6% respectively. In October 2010 it sold half of the interest it had in the Kerrobert heavy oil properties to Petrobank Energy and Resources (including another asset acquired in Dawson the transaction cost Petrobank $15 million, Petrobank's THAI and CAPRI technology can help Baytex exploit more of the resource). In February 2011 it completed a $156.5 million deal with a private company for heavy oil assets in Saskatchewan (near Seal Lake and Lloydminster). The acquisition added over 10 million boe of proved and probable reserves and raised company production by about 5%. In 2011 and 2016, respectively, Baytex acquired \\"heavy oil assets located in the Reno and Seal areas of its northern Alberta Peace River area.\\" In June 2014 Baytex acquired Aurora Oil & Gas Limited, which led to its significant new position in the EagleFord shale oil play in Texas. In 2014 Baytex 52-week high was $49.88 and its 52-week low was $14.56. For fiscal 2016 total production was /d, flat to the year before. Baytex's portfolio is 79% oil and liquids with the remaining 21% natural gas. Light and medium oil (oil with an API gravity over 22.3 degrees) makes up a growing part of its reserve base. In June 2018, Baytex announced an offer to buy Raging River Exploration Inc., another Canadian oil and gas firm, for C$2.8 billion. The all-stock deal was poorly received by markets and analysts, with both companys' share prices falling. On March 18, 2020, Baytex announces a 50% reduction to its 2020 capital budget to $260 to $290 million, from the original $500 to $575 million. Ed LaFehr, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the company commented that they are \\"facing unprecedented challenge due to the significant degradation and volatility in global crude oil prices.\\"  Sustainability  Baytex was recognized by Corporate Knights as one of the Future 40 Responsible Corporate Leaders in Canada for 2018 In September 2019, Baytex published its fourth biennial Corporate Responsibility Report, detailing efforts and performance with respect to people, the environment, the community and stakeholders, and responsible business practices. In September 2019, Baytex published a greenhouse gas (\\"GHG\\") emissions reduction target with an objective of reducing corporate emission intensity by 30% by 2021, relative to a 2018 baseline Operations Baytex's operations are organized into five main operating areas: Peace River, Lloydminster, Viking, Duvernay and the Eagle Ford. Approximately 82% of its production and reserves are derived from crude oil and liquids. The Eagle Ford in Texas represents approximately 46% of our production. * Eagle Ford - the Eagle Ford assets are located in the core of the liquids-rich Eagle Ford shale in South Texas and include non-operated working interests in approximately 78,205 (19,851 net) acres. The lands consist of four areas of mutual interest (Sugarloaf, Longhorn, Ipanema and Excelsior) with an average working interest of approximately 25%. In 2019, production in the Eagle Ford averaged 39,055 boe/d. * Viking - the Viking assets are located in the greater Dodsland area in southwest Saskatchewan and in the Esther area of southeastern Alberta. These assets were acquired through a business combination with Raging River and produce light oil from the Viking formation. In 2019, the Viking assets produced 22,546 boe/d. * Heavy Oil ‚Äì Baytex's heavy oil assets are located at Peace River in northwest Alberta and Lloydminster in Alberta and Saskatchewan. In Peace River, Baytex produces heavy oil from the Bluesky formation. In Lloydminster, operations include primary and thermal production. In 2019, the heavy oil assets produced 29,377 boe/d. * Duvernay - as a result of the merger with Raging River, Baytex acquired a land position in the emerging Pembina Area Duvernay shale in central Alberta. In 2019, the Duvernay assets produced 1,688 boe/d.

Cowgill's law in Greek In Proto-Greek, Cowgill's law says that a former /o/ vowel becomes /u/ between a resonant (/r/, /l/, /m/, /n/) and a labial consonant (including labiovelars), in either order. Examples: *ŒΩœçŒæ \\"night\\" < PIE *nok ∑ts (cf. Lat. nox, Ved. n√°k < *nakts, Goth. nahts, Hitt. gen. sg. nekuz /nek ∑ts/) *œÜœçŒªŒªŒøŒΩ \\"leaf\\" < PIE *b ∞olyom (cf. Lat. folium) *ŒºœçŒªŒ∑ \\"mill\\" < PIE *mol-eh‚ÇÇ- (cf. Lat. molƒ´na) *·ΩÑŒΩœÖŒæ \\"nail\\" (stem √≥nukh-) < early PG *onok ∑ ∞- < PIE h‚ÇÉnog ∑ ∞- (cf. OE n√¶gl < PGerm *nag-laz) Note that when a labiovelar adjoins an /o/ affected by Cowgill's law, the new /u/ will cause the labiovelar to lose its labial component (as in n√∫ks and √≥nuks/√≥nukh-, where the usual Greek change *k ∑ > p has not occurred). Cowgill's law in Germanic Cowgill's law in Germanic has no relation to Cowgill's law in Greek other than having been named after the same person. It says that a PIE laryngeal /h‚ÇÉ/, and possibly /h‚ÇÇ/, turns into /k/ in Proto-Germanic when directly preceded by a sonorant and followed by /w/. This law is still controversial, although increasingly accepted. Donald Ringe (2006) accepts it; Andrew Sihler (1995) is noncommittal. Examples are fairly few: **kwikwaz \\"alive\\" (whence English quick) < PIE *g ∑ih‚ÇÉ-wos (cf. Lat. vƒ´vus) * \\"us two\\" (cf. Goth. ) < PIE *nÃ•h‚ÇÉwe (cf.

Gk. dƒÅ·∏ór, Ved. dev·πõÃÅ, Lat. lƒìvir) If it becomes generally accepted, the relative chronology of this law could have consequences for a possible reconstructed phonetic value of h‚ÇÉ. Since Germanic /k/ results from earlier PIE /g/, and since the change occurred before Grimm's law applied (according to Ringe), the resulting change would be actually h‚ÇÉw > g ∑. This would have been more likely if h‚ÇÉ was a voiced velar obstruent to begin with. If h‚ÇÉ was a voiced labiovelar fricative as is occasionally suggested, the change would therefore have been: > .

It was the first of three Pegasus satellites to be launched. The Pegasus spacecraft were manufactured by Fairchild Hiller, and operated by NASA. Spacecraft Pegasus 1 was a Pegasus satellite, consisting of of instruments, attached to the S-IV upper stage of the carrier rocket which had placed it into orbit. It had a total mass of , and was equipped with two sets of micrometeoroid detection panels, and a radio for tracking and returning data. The panels were long, and equipped with 116 individual detectors. Launch The launch of Pegasus 1 Pegasus 1 was launched atop a Saturn I rocket, serial number SA-9, flying from Launch Complex 37B at the Cape Kennedy Air Force Station. The launch occurred at 14:37:03 UTC on 16 February 1965. Following launch, Pegasus 1 was given the COSPAR designation 1965-009A, while NORAD assigned it the Satellite Catalog Number 01085. Pegasus 1 was a secondary payload of Apollo program mission AS-103, which also carried a boilerplate Apollo spacecraft BP-16. The Apollo boilerplate acted as a payload fairing for the Pegasus spacecraft, which was stored inside what would have been the Service Module of a functional spacecraft. Upon reaching orbit, the boilerplate Command and Service modules were jettisoned. The trajectory and space-fixed velocity were very nearly as planned. The Apollo shroud separated from the Pegasus satellite about 804 seconds after lift-off and deployment of two meteoroid detection panel wings of the Pegasus satellite commenced about 1 minute later. Operations Pegasus 1 was operated in a low Earth orbit. On 18 March 1965 it was catalogued as being in an orbit with a perigee of and an apogee of , inclined at 31.7 degrees to the Equator and with a period of 97.00 minutes. Once in orbit, the panels were deployed to detect micrometeoroid impacts. Experiment results were returned to Earth by radio. The spacecraft operated until 29 August 1968, and subsequently remained in orbit until it decayed and reentered the atmosphere on 17 September 1978. Although minor malfunctions occurred in both the launch vehicle and the satellite, the mission was a success in that all objectives were met.

Career Heydon qualified for the 2007 UK Open as an amateur qualifier, losing in the first round to John Burton. He also reached the last 40 of the 2009 World Masters. Heydon joined the PDC in 2010, and quickly made an impact, reaching a semi-final in his second Pro Tour event in Gibraltar.Ovens Wins In Gibraltar PDC.tv He also qualified for the 2010 UK Open. Entering at the last 64, he defeated Mark Dudbridge and Wayne Atwood before losing to Wes Newton in the last 16. He narrowly missed out on qualification for the 2010 World Matchplay, but did qualify for his first PDC World Championship in 2011. He lost 1‚Äì3 in sets to Robert Thornton in the first round, despite having darts to level the match at 2‚Äì2. Heydon qualified for the 2011 Grand Slam of Darts after reaching the final of the Wildcard qualifier. He opened his campaign with a surprise 5‚Äì3 victory over Premier League champion Gary Anderson. At the 2012 World Championship Heydon almost pulled off a huge upset by knocking out reigning champion Adrian Lewis. He led 2‚Äì0 in the best of five sets match only for Lewis to regain parity at 2‚Äì2. In the deciding set Heydon had three darts to move into a 2‚Äì0 lead but missed them and Lewis would ultimately be victorious. Lewis admitted after the match that Heydon had been \\"phenomenal\\" in the first two sets. In August, Heydon beat Brandon Walsh and Gary Butcher in the UK Qualifier for the European Tour Event 4, and defeated Andy Smith 6‚Äì5 in the first round in Stuttgart. Heydon continued his form in round two with a 6‚Äì2 win over Mark Walsh with a 100.45 average, but then lost to James Wade 4‚Äì6 in the last 16. Heydon's best results of 2012 came after this as he reached the quarter-finals of both the 12th and 16th Players Championship events, losing to Andy Hamilton (5‚Äì6) and Jamie Caven (0‚Äì6) respectively. He finished the season 57th on the ProTour Order of Merit, missing out on qualification for the World Championship by ¬£800. Heydon began 2013 by qualifying for the UK Masters and beat James Hubbard 6‚Äì4, before losing 6‚Äì5 to Dave Chisnall in the second round. He reached the same stage of the Austrian Darts Open where James Wade won 6‚Äì1. Heydon was a last 32 loser in four of the eight UK Open qualifiers to enter the event in the second round where he was edged out 5‚Äì4 by Andy Jenkins. He started 2014 ranked world number 71, outside of the top 64 who retained their places on the tour and Heydon therefore entered Q School in a bid to win his spot back. On the fourth and final day he beat Stuart Anderson 5‚Äì0 in the last round to earn a tour card. Heydon had changed his throwing style in the previous 18 months due to back problems and has also begun wearing glasses but stated afterwards that he was adapting to the changes and hopeful for further successes in the future. In February 2014, Heydon enjoyed his best run in an event in 16 months by reaching the last 16 of the fifth UK Open Qualifier with victories over the likes of Mark Walsh and Richie Burnett, but lost 6‚Äì3 to eventual winner Gary Anderson. At the UK Open itself he beat Johnny Haines 5‚Äì4 and Steve Maish 9‚Äì1, before losing 9‚Äì7 against Brendan Dolan in the fourth round. His form continued at the third Players Championship as he reached the semi-finals of a PDC event for the second time in his career by whitewashing John Part and also beating Ian White and Ronnie Baxter, before Phil Taylor defeated Heydon 6‚Äì0. Heydon could not get past the last 64 in any other event during the rest of the season. Heydon began 2015 70th in the world rankings and so entered Q School in a bid to earn a two-year PDC tour card. He was successful on the first day by defeating Jim Walker 5‚Äì3 in the final round. The highlight of Heydon's year undoubtedly came at the 11th Players Championship event in May, when he overcame Darren Johnson, Alan Norris, Mark Dudbridge, John Bowles and Jelle Klaasen to play in the semi-finals, where he lost 6‚Äì4 to Dave Chisnall. Other than that, Heydon was unable to get past the last 32 of any event in 2015. In 2016, he qualified for the Austrian Darts Open, where he made the quarter-finals by beating Roxy-James Rodriguez 6‚Äì4, reigning World Grand Prix champion Robert Thornton 6‚Äì5 and number six seed Ian White 6‚Äì0. Heydon was defeated 6‚Äì4 by Michael Smith. This was by far his best finish of the season as he only reached the last 32 twice in all the other events he played in. In 2018 Nigel Heydon was active on the British Darts Organisation circuit. He played for England in the British International Championships (darts), Six Nations Cup & was named in the 4 man squad for the WDF Europe Cup. He also qualified for the 2019 BDO World Darts Championship by winning one of the 4 places on offer in the playoffs in Bridlington, The same week he qualified for Stage finals of the 2018 World Masters (darts) before losing in the last 32 to Welshman Jim Williams (darts player) 3-2 in a tense match.

Biography  Terry Brighton studied philosophy at Lancaster University and theology at Birmingham University before being ordained an Anglican priest. His parishes included St Martin‚Äôs in Hereford, where he stood in as chaplain to the SAS and first developed an interest in military history. After leaving the church he worked on the curatorial staff of the Queen's Royal Lancers Regimental Museum, for which he remains a consultant. He is best known for his research on the Charge of the Light Brigade, published in Hell Riders: the Truth about the Charge of the Light Brigade. He used survivors‚Äô accounts, many of them never before published, to give the soldiers' viewpoint of this famous cavalry action. He argued that the Charge was not the military disaster it appeared, and controversially claimed that it could be considered ‚Äúan astounding success‚Äù. In October 2004, on the 150th anniversary of the Charge, he broadcast an account of this action from the Crimea to the U.S. live on NPR. Although best known for his research on the Crimean War, according to Publishers Weekly it was his later work on the Second World War generals Patton, Montgomery and Rommel that moved him ‚Äúinto the top rank of general audience military writers‚Äù.http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/1-legacy/21-nonfiction- book-reviews/article/14335-nonfiction-reviews-9-7-2009-.html The book uses the personal writings of the generals to argue that the explosive relationship between the allies Patton and Montgomery had a greater effect on the conduct and course of the war than the respectful relationship between the enemies Patton and Rommel. In October 2010 he was awarded the Imperial Service Medal. His first novel, Hell's Mile, was published in 2020 by Hard Corps Books. According to the author, this makes good a promise he made to Richard Madeley on the British TV chat show Richard & Judy that he would ‚Äúwrite the novel‚Äù of the Charge of the Light Brigade. The publisher adds that Hell's Mile is based on survivors' graphic accounts and is not for the faint-hearted. In his controversial extended essay, The MAGA Offensive, published by Hard Corps Essays in September 2020, he argues that \\"the re-election of President Donald Trump is crucial for the survival of the real USA and the core values that define Western culture.\\" Terry Brighton lives in England with his wife, Linda, and their dog, Belle.

Hopkins co-founded the White Cross Army in 1883, and vigorously advocated moral purity while criticising contemporary sexual double standards.  Early life  Jane Ellice Hopkins was born in Cambridge, the daughter of William Hopkins, a mathematics tutor at the University of Cambridge, and his second wife, Caroline Frances Boys Hopkins. As a girl, Hopkins knew the photographer Julia Margaret Cameron. At age 30, after her father's death, Hopkins moved to Brighton with her mother.  Activism  In 1874 Hopkins and rescue worker Sarah Robinson established the Soldier's Institute at Portsmouth, and in 1876 toured several British towns, recruiting thousands of women to the Ladies' Association for the Care of Friendless Girls. Her biographer describes her as \\"instrumental\\" in the passing of the Industrial Schools Amendment Act of 1880, which allowed children to be removed from hazardous homes (including brothels) and placed in industrial schools. She also lobbied for the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885, which raised the female age of consent from 13 to 16, and criminalized male homosexuality. Hopkins co-founded the White Cross Army, a men's Christian organization, in 1883 with Bishop J. B. Lightfoot of Durham. \\"It was hard that the power which would have been a glory to me if I were a man, should be held a shame and a disgrace to me because I was a woman,\\" she recalled of her work.  Writing  Hopkins wrote in a wide variety of genres, including two volumes of poetry, English Idylls (1865) and Autumn Swallows (1883), and a sensational gothic novel, Rose Turquand (1874). An Englishwoman's Work Among Workingmen (1875) was a memoir of her activism. She wrote pamphlets, most notably True Manliness (1883), and Christian devotional works, including Christ the Consoler, A Book of Comfort for the Sick (1879), and A plea for the wider action of the Church of England in the prevention of the degradation of women, an essay in which she criticised the contemporary double standard by which women were disproportionately blamed for sexual immorality. Her last books were The Power of Womanhood (1899), on the role of mothers in \\"moral evolution\\", and The Story of Life (1902), a guide intended to help parents teach sex education to their adolescent children.Hall, Lesley A., Outspoken Women : an anthology of women's writing on sex: 1870-1969. London : Routledge, 2005. (pp. 79-80, 329).  Personal life  Multiple chronic health issues led Hopkins to withdraw from public life in 1888. She died in 1904, aged 67 years, in Brighton. Fellow activist Rosa Mary Barrett wrote a short biography of Hopkins, published in 1907.  References   Further reading  * Morgan, Sue.

W. Snow. \\"Obituaries : John Buxton.\\" IBIS 132 (International Journal of Avian Science, British Ornithologists' Union). 1990. pp. 621-622. John Buxton was born in Bramhall, Cheshire, and educated at Yarlet Hall, Malvern College, and New College, Oxford. Before the war he visited Norway several times and gave lectures on English Literature at Oslo University. He also went on digging expeditions to Palestine and Ireland. He was Warden at Skokholm Bird Observatory in 1939 with his wife, Marjorie (Ronald Lockley's sister), conducting research and bird ringing.Shearwaters, p182 Lockley, R M Second World War At the outbreak of war he was reading for his D.Phil. at Oxford. He volunteered for the Navy, but when a special appeal came from the War Office for men with certain language qualifications he responded to that.

At this camp, the prisoners organised a 'University' and Buxton gave lectures in English and helped in the work of the library. His love of the countryside and of birds, apparent in his poetry, was a constant solace in camp life and bird-watching was, for him and several of his fellow prisoners, Peter Conder, John Barrett and George Waterston, one of the keenest of their few pleasures.Atropos, flyleaf They were brought together in Oflag VIB near Warburg Niemann, Derek.

It was of particular interest that prisoners should be able to carry on their literary work and for it eventually to reach England. John managed, from his prison camp, to get in touch with Erwin Stresemann, who sent him rings to use in the camp and some useful literature, including the scarce first volume of Niethammer's Handbuch der Deutschen Vogelkunde, now in the Alexander Library at Oxford.

(also Babbington, died 1569) was an English divine and an academic administrator at the University of Oxford. He was elected Master (head) of Balliol College, Oxford on 2 September 1559, a post he held until he resigned the following year on 27 October 1560. Babington was Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University from 1560 to 1562. He was also Rector of Lincoln College, Oxford from 1560 until he resigned in 1563. Life Babington is said to have been a native of Leicestershire, to have entered Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1544, and to have taken his B.A. degree in 1548-9. Two years later he was appointed Fellow of St John's College, Cambridge, and in 1552 became M.A. By 1555 he must have changed his religion, for at that date his name is found appended to the Roman Catholic articles of belief.Lamb, Cambr. Doct. 176 About the same time he seems to have transferred his residence to Oxford, where he 'incepted' in arts 1554.Gutch's WoodApp. 95 After three years, he was unanimously chosen Proctor of his new university (1557), being already a Fellow of All Souls College. In 1557 and 1558, he successively took his Bachelor's and Doctor's degrees in Divinity; but Wood adds a special warning that such rapid promotion was only because Oxford University was very empty, and wanted \\"theologists to perform the requisite offices.\\" There were only three doctors in theology who proceeded in six years; and sermons were so rare, that scarce one was given. It is only fair, however, to add that in another passage Wood mentions Francis Babington as renowned for his philosophical and logical disputations. In 1559, Queen Elizabeth I's visitors removed Dr Wright from the mastership of Balliol College, Oxford, and appointed Dr Babington instead. Dr Babington had no objection to heaping together a plurality of livings and offices. Between 1557 and 1560, he was rector of at least four parishes: Milton Keynes, Twyford, Sherrington Aldworth, and Adstock; and two or three of these he must have held together. Besides these preferments he was, in May 1560, appointed Rector of Lincoln College, Oxford, and was Sir John Mason's commissary or Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University in 1560, 1561, and 1562. He even held the Lady Margaret readership in divinity for 1561, although the statutes forbade its being held by the Vice-Chancellor. In March 1562, he appears in conjunction with \\"Anthony Forster, of Cumnore, gent.\\",Sir W. Scott's Tony Foster. as assisting in forcing a Protestant warden upon the Roman Catholic fellows of Merton College. Wood has given a graphic description of the whole scene.Annals, anno 1562. Dr Babington was the Earl of Leicester's chaplain, and seems about this time to have been high in favour with that nobleman. Anthony √† Wood tells us that he was one of Leicester's five most trusted advisers in Oxford, and was chosen to preach Amy Robsart's funeral sermon at St Mary's Church, Oxford, on which occasion he \\"tript once or twice by recommending to his auditors the virtues of that lady so pitifully murdered instead of so pitifully slain.\\" His text was 'Beati mortui qui in Domino moriuntur' (1560) (Bartlett's Cumnor). In the same year, Dr Babington stood as the representative of the more conservative party for the deanery of Christ Church, Oxford against Dr Sampson, the great pillar of the puritanical body. Strype, in his account of this contest, describes Dr Babington as \\"a man of mean learning and of a complying temper\\",Annals of Refor. i. chap. 43. but he failed in his candidature. He seems by this time to have been losing Leicester's favour, and was more than suspected of being a concealed Papist. In 1563, he had to resign the rectorship of Lincoln College, and two years later was forced to flee overseas, where he is said to have died in 1569.

Leveau: Caesarea Mauretaniae (in French) and is now called Cherchell, in modern Algeria. In the present time is Caesarea used as a titular see for Catholic bishops.  History  = Antiquity to third century AD = Phoenicians from Carthage founded a settlement on the northern coast of Africa, 100 km west of the present-day city of Algiers at present Cherchell around 400 BC to serve as a trading station and named the city Iol or Jol. It became a part of the kingdom of Numidia under Jugurtha, who died in 104 BC and it became very significant to the Berber monarchy and generals of Numidia. The Berber Kings Bocchus I and Bocchus II lived there. During the 1st century BC, due to the city‚Äôs strategic location, new defences were built. The last Numidian king Juba II and his wife, the Ptolemaic princess Cleopatra Selene II, were forced to flee the other part of Numidian kingdom because the local population disapproved of their king being too Romanized, which caused civil unrest between 26 and 20 BC. Roman Emperor Augustus had intervened in the situation and in 33 BC Rome and divided the Numidian Kingdom into two. One half of the kingdom became a part of the Roman province of Africa Nova, while western Numidia and the old kingdom of Mauretania became one kingdom in the hands of a Berber prince named Juba II. Although his father was once an ally of Pompey, Juba had lived in Rome under the tutelage of Julius Caesar, learning to read and write Greek and Latin. As he was considered too Roman to rule, Juba and his wife, Cleopatra Selene (the daughter of Marcus Antonius and last Pharaonic queen Cleopatra), were at the mercy of civil unrest when Emperor Augustus intervened. Juba II renamed Iol Caesarea or Caesarea Mauretaniae, in honor of the emperor. Caesarea would become the capital of the Roman client kingdom of Mauretania, which became one of the important client kingdoms in the Roman Empire, and their dynasty was among the most loyal client Roman vassal rulers. Juba and Cleopatra did not just rename their new capital, but rebuilt the town as a typical Graeco-Roman city in fine Roman style on a large, lavish and expensive scale, complete with street grids, a theatre, an art collection and a lighthouse similar to the one at Alexandria. The construction and sculptural projects in Caesarea and throughout the kingdom were built in a rich mixture of ancient Egyptian, Greek and Roman architectural styles. The monarchs are buried in their mausoleum, the Royal Mausoleum of Mauretania which can still be seen. The seaport capital and its kingdom flourished during this period with most of the population being of Greek and Phoenician origin with a minority of Berbers. It remained a significant power center with a Greco-Roman civilization as a veneer, until 40 AD, when its last monarch Ptolemy of Mauretania was murdered on a visit to Rome. The murder of Ptolemy set in motion a series of reactions resulting in a devastating war with Rome. In 44 AD after a four-year bloody revolt, the capital was captured and Roman Emperor Claudius divided the Mauretanian kingdom into two provinces. The province of which Caesarea became the capital was called Mauretania Caesariensis after it. The city itself was settled with Roman soldiers and was given the rank of a colonia, and so was also called Colonia Claudia Caesarea. In later centuries, the Roman population expanded, as did the Berber population, resulting in a mixed Greco-Phoenician, Berber and Roman population. The city featured a hippodrome, amphitheatre, basilica, numerous Greek temples and Roman civic buildings. Leveau Philipe: \\"L'amphith√©√¢tre et le th√©√¢tre-amphith√©√¢tre de Cherchel\\" (in French) During this heyday, the city had its own school of philosophy, academy and library. As a significant city of the Roman Empire it had trading contacts across the Roman world. = Romanization and Christianity center = Considered to be one of the more loyal of Roman provincial capitals, Caesarea grew under Roman rule in the 1st and 2nd century AD, soon reaching a population of over 30,000 inhabitants.Leveau, Philippe. \\"Caesarea de Maur√©tanie, une ville romaine et ses campagnes\\" first chapter In 44 AD, dng the reign of Emperor Claudius it became the capital of the imperial province of Mauretania Caesarensis. Later, the emperor made it a colonia, ‚ÄúColonia Claudia Caesarea‚Äù. As with many other cities throughout the empire, he and his successors further Romanised the area, building monuments, enlarging the bath houses, adding an amphitheatre, and improving the aqueducts. Later, under the Severan dynasty, a new forum was added. The city was sacked by Berber tribes during a revolt in 371/372 AD, but recovered. In later centuries, the Roman population expanded, as did the Berber population, resulting in a mixed Berber and Roman population. The city was mostly Romanized under Septimius Severus and it grew to be a very rich city with nearly 100,000 inhabitants, according to historian Gsell. In about 165 AD, it was the birthplace to the future Roman Emperor Macrinus. From an early stage, the city had a small but growing population of Christians, Roman and Berber and was noted for the religious debates and tumults which featured the hostility of Roman public religion toward Christians. By the 4th century, the conversion of the population from pagan to Christian beliefs resulted in nearly all of the population being Christianised. By the 5th century the capital of Mauretania Caesariensis was totally Romanised, according to Theodor Mommsen, one of the 80 cities in the Maghreb populated (and sometimes even created) by Roman colonists from Italy. It remained an extremely loyalist force for the Roman Empire. Additionally, the Romanized city's elite held considerable control of international trade. Although it stagnated for over a hundred years and even lost population, as did most cities in the Roman Empire, it still remained much as it had been since it was founded. Consequently, the Roman Empire largely relied on its North African dominion for essential grain supply and some elite rulers. It became a target of the Vandals and was finally taken over by them in 429 AD. The Vandal army and fleet burnt the town and turned many of its old magnificent Roman era buildings into Vandal citadels. Although this devastation was significant, the Vandal era saw restoration of much of the damage, an expansion in population, and the creation of a vibrant Romanised Germanic community. The area and remained in Vandal hands until 533 AD, when the city was captured by the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I. The new rulers used the Greek language (along with Latin), but the Neo-Latin local dialect remained in use by the inhabitants. The city declined. The Roman and the semi-Romanised Vandal population held a stratified position over the growing numbers of Berbers it allowed to settle in return for cheap labor.Leveau, Philippe. \\"Caesarea de Maur√©tanie, une ville romaine et ses campagnes\\" third chapter This reduced the economic status of small freeholders and urban dwellers, especially what remained of the Vandal population, who provided most of the local military forces. Furthermore, the increasing use of Berber workers ground down the Roman population of free peasants. By the 8th century, the city and surrounding area had neither a strong urban middle class of free citizens, nor a rural population of freehold farmers, nor a crack military aristocracy of Vandal warriors and their retinue. It thus succumbed to an Arab Moslem jihad.  Ecclesiastical history  Apart from some bishops who may have been of the church in Caesarea and whose names are engraved in inscriptions that have been unearthed, the first bishop whose name is preserved in extant written documents is Fortunatus, who took part in the Council of Arles of 314, which condemned Donatism as heresy. A letter of Symmachus mentions a bishop named Clemens in about 371/372 or 380. The town became a Donatist centre and at the joint Conference of Carthage in 411, was represented both by the Donatist Emeritus and by the Catholic Deuterius. Augustine of Hippo has left an account of his public confrontation with Emeritus at Caesarea in the autumn of 418, after which Emeritus was exiled. The last bishop of Caesarea whose name is known from written documents was Apocorius, one of Catholic bishops whom Huneric summoned to Carthage in 484 and then sent into exile. An early 8th- century Notitia Episcopatuum still included this see.Joseph Mesnage, L'Afrique chr√©tienne, Paris 1912, pp. 447‚Äì450Charles Courtois, v. C√©sar√©e de Maur√©tanie, in Dictionnaire d'Histoire et de G√©ographie eccl√©siastiques, vol. XII, Paris 1953, coll. 203-206 =Titular see= There was Caesarea in Mauretania,Caesarea Mauretaniae diocese but also a small city called Caesarea in Numidia (near the actual border between Algeria and Tunisia). The second was one of over 120 cities in the Roman province of Numidia that were important enough to become a suffragan bishopric of the Metropolitan of Carthage, but would fade away, plausibly at the seventh century advent of Islam. The ruins of this small Numidian city ruins are in Hammamet () in modern Algeria, but remains a Latin Catholic titular see. * Its only historically documented incumbent, Dominicus, was among the Catholic bishops convoked to a Council of Carthage in 484 by king Huneric of the Vandal Kingdom and like most of them (unlike the Donatist schismatics) was exiled, in his case to Corsica. * Morcelli also attributes to this see the Donatist heretic Cresconius, who probably was bishop in Caesariana (Numidia). The diocese was nominally restored in 1933 as Latin titular bishopric of Caesarea in Numidia.

She was sunk off the shore of Isle Royale in Lake Superior in 1906 and the remains of her wreck and cargo are still on the lake bottom. The wreck was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. History Monarch (Official Number 96843) was a wooden passenger-cargo ship built in 1890 in Sarnia, Ontario, Canada, by John Dyble for the Northwest Transportation Company. She was launched on June 27, 1890, the last ship built in Sarnia until World War II. The ship was 259 feet (78.9 meters) long, 35 feet (10.7 meters) in beam, and 15 feet (4.6 meters) in depth. She had a 900-hp (671-Kw) triple-expansion steam engine with two Scotch boilers, allowing her to attain 14 mph. The ship's hull was heavily reinforced with iron, and she was fitted with 65 cabins. Monarch was used to transport both passengers and packages on the Great Lakes throughout her career, primarily running between Sarnia, Thunder Bay, Ontario, and Duluth, Minnesota. In 1899, Northwest Transportation merged with another company to form the Northern Navigation Company, Ltd. Final voyage On December 6, 1906, the Monarch finished loading a cargo of wheat, oats, salmon, and general merchandise and departed Thunder Bay for Sarnia in a blinding snowstorm. For some reason, the ship headed off her planned course, and that night she ran at full speed into the palisade area on the north side of Blake Point on Isle Royale. The ship's engineer kept the engine engaged to maintain the ship's position on the shore, and John D. McCallum, brother of first mate Burt McCallum, carried a line to shore through the rough seas. The crew and passengers used the line to escape the wreck, and only one person perished. The survivors camped on Isle Royale for four days, salvaging food from the wreck and keeping signal fires alight, before they were rescued on December 10, 1906. During the night of 11‚Äì12 December 1906, the wreck broke into two pieces, leaving only the bow section visible. Salvage operations on Monarch were carried out over the next two years, and the engine and associated machinery was salvaged in 1908. The wreck today The wooden wreck has disintegrated, although a number of pieces of wreckage can be seen. Large pieces of wooden wreckage are scattered on the bottom of Lake Superior at depths of 10 to 80 feet (3 to 24.4 meters), and there is a trove of Monarch‚Ä≤s cargo still lying on the bottom near the wreck. Approximately 85 dives were made on the wreck in 2009 out of 1,062 dives made to wrecks in the Isle Royale National Park.

He preached a sermon at the Lincoln assizes, which, at the request of his hearers, was published at Cambridge in 1678. It is a curious instance of the style of the time, being elaborately learned and crammed with quotations in Latin and Greek, and even Hebrew. Its political views may be estimated by its assertion that 'monarchy is the best safeguard to mankind, both against the great furious bulls of tyrannical popery, and the lesser giddy cattle of schismatical presbytery.' This sermon probably procured him the degree of Doctor of Divinity (DD) per literas regias in 1669.

This species can reach in standard length. Elassoma gilberti is closely related to E. okefenokee, and the two species are very similar in appearance. E. gilberti in general has four preopercular canal pores, while E. okefenokee on average has three. The average number of anal fin rays is seven in E. gilberti and eight in E. okefenokee. The female E. gilberti often expresses a blue patch of color behind her eye, while the E. okefenokee does not. Range This species occurs in northwestern Florida and southwestern Georgia in the lower Suwannee River drainage and other Gulf of Mexico drainages from the Waccasassa River west to Choctawhatchee Bay, whereas E. okefenokee occurs in central and northeastern Florida and southeastern Georgia in the upper Suwannee River drainage and other drainages east of the Waccasassa River and Suwamnee River. Both species are usually found among dense aquatic vegetation and leaf litter, where they feed mainly on tiny insects, crustaceans, and worms. Spawning Elassoma gilberti will breed in a wide range of water conditions, and spawning has been confirmed in both 0 DH and 20 DH water. Males require a region of dense living or artificial rooted aquatic plants to claim as territory to woo females in to spawn. Each spawning male claims about a cubic foot of volume as his territory. The males spend their time patrolling around their territories and dancing to catch the females' attention. When dancing, they wiggle their dorsal, anal, and caudal fins to show off their bright blue iridescence. Then, suddenly, they do a full stop, holding completely still for a few seconds with no visible motion. After the pause, they continue dancing again, often moving up and down in their eagerness to woo the female into their respective clumps of dense plants. Females swim in and out of the males' territories to spawn. The male then guards the spawn site until the eggs hatch, chasing females and other males away. It takes about three to four days for the eggs to hatch. At this point, the male stops protecting the spawn site and becomes receptive to spawning again.

Early life and education Probst was born on 18 November 1911 in Vianden in the north of Luxembourg. After a classical education in Luxembourg from 1924 to 1931, he spent a year studying art at the Ecole des Artisans in Luxembourg City. He then went to Brussels where he attended the Acad√©mie Royale des Beaux-Arts before completing his studies at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des arts d√©coratifs in 1940.Guy Wagner, \\"Der stille Pionier: Zum Tode von Joseph Probst\\" . GuyWagner.net. Retrieved 20 December 2010. Career After the Second World War, Probst began to work as an artist under the influence of Expressionism. Initially he concentrated on portraits of nudes and, especially mother-and-child paintings, but moved ever closer to abstract art under the influence of Michel Stoffel and Lucien Wercollier with whom he became one of the founding members of the Nouvelle Equipe. In 1954, together with his wife Colette W√ºrth and Will Dahlem, Henri Dillenburg, Fran√ßois Gillen, Fran√ßois Kinnen, Emile Kirscht, Wenzel Profant, Michel Stoffel und Lucien Wercollier, he became a co-founder of the Iconomaques, a group bent on abstract art. Thereafter, Probst was recognized as one of Luxembourg's classic artists, not just through local interest in his works but through exhibits at the Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne in Paris and at the Universal Postal Union in Bern. In 1960, he was awarded the Italian Marzotto Prize, indicating the extent of foreign interest in his work. Style His abstract style developed slowly from the early effects of his dark, subdued colours on form until his oils and guaches became ever more geometrical. From 1955, he moved even further into complex, interwoven forms with an extended spectrum of colour, making him a true proponent of lyrical abstract art. From 1972, he developed a new clarity of form which he also applied to stained- glass windows, murals and mosaics. The spiral took on special importance in his work, revealing his growing depth of interest in abstraction. Representing variations on a theme, his mosaics depict visual versions of musical compositions such as Franz Schubert's Winterreise cycle.\\"Picturing Winterreise: Artist Inventory\\", Schubert Society USA. Retrieved 20 December 2010. In later life, Probst returned to figurative painting which can be seen in his 1994 and 1995 exhibits.

Internationally he is best known for his scientific biography of Christiaan Huygens.  Education  Andriesse studied applied physics at Delft University of Technology, where he specialized in radiation physics. In 1969 he received his PhD degree from the same university with a thesis on the scattering of neutrons in gaseous argon-36. After that, he initiated a research project on the force between noble gas atoms.  Research  He then worked at the Kapteyn Observatory in Roden, part of the University of Groningen. In 1978 he was the first to calculate the radiation of interstellar dust with a fluctuating temperature.Platt particles in M17? Only after the turn of the century Infrared observations from space showed the calculated spectrum to be characteristic of all galaxies. In 1979 Andriesse came up with a theory for the mass loss of stars.Fluctuation Theory of the Mass Flux from the Stars ‚Äì summarized in C. Chiosi & A. Maeder, \\"The Evolution of Massive Stars\\", Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics, 24 (1986), 329‚Äì375 =Fluctuation Theory= There are two classic explanations for the mass loss of stars by stellar winds. For stars of high luminosity radiation pressure is the driving force; for fainter stars like the Sun the stellar wind is driven by mechanical effects such as shock waves or magnetic fields. To what level a stellar wind swells, depends on accidental features of the mechanism. The strength of the wind is not easily related to the basic properties of the star (mass, radius, and luminosity). Andriesse's fluctuation theory is a metatheory for the two mechanisms mentioned. It does not matter much which mechanism occurs in a certain star, as long as that mechanism meets certain requirements: the stellar wind must take the form of puffs that are so pronounced that they affect the equilibrium between gravitational and thermal forces of the star as a whole. Only after the equilibrium is regained, a subsequent puff may take place. The fluctuation theory establishes a clear link between the strength of the stellar wind and the basic properties of the star, which, as mentioned above, the mechanisms by themselves cannot establish. Metatheories are not very common in astrophysics. Also fluctuations are usually ignored rather than taken as a starting point. When the fluctuation theory, which Andriesse still sees as his best work,A.J. K√∂bben & H. Tromp, De onwelkome boodschap, Mets, Amsterdam (1999) p. 73: In Groningen he [Andriesse] develops theoretical ideas that give him great satisfaction ‚Äì years later he is still lyrical about this theory ‚Ä¶ 'the best of my achievements.' did not gain much acceptance, Andriesse left astrophysics in disappointment in 1980. =Nuclear Energy= He joined the research institute KEMA of the Dutch electricity companies in Arnhem and started a 'source-term' program, with the aim to determine which and how many radioactive substances would be released by nuclear reactors, when they become overheated. Tiny amounts of uranium oxide, irradiated by neutrons, and thus containing fission products, were heated above 2,000 degrees. When these experiments were under way, the nuclear reactor in Chernobyl exploded. There happened outdoors what Andriesse with his student Richard Tanke were doing inside a safe laboratoryR.H.J. Tanke, Mass‚Äì and gamma spectrometric measurements of fission products released from overheated, fresh irradiated, uranium dioxide, Journal of Nuclear Materials 188 (1992) 262‚Äì272. His results, presented to the International Atomic Energy Agency, showed that even at very high temperatures most fission products will stay in the reactor coreC.D.

He later cautioned for an explosion of the Petten nuclear reactor caused by a sudden break of the cooling circuit.  Professor  In 1989 Andriesse was appointed professor of electricity supply at the University of Utrecht. This position was paid by KEMA. Commotion arose, when he expressed opinions about the safety of nuclear power plants, which were too negative in the eyes of KEMA.The showcase professor Eventually the conflict was resolved by Andriesse moving to a position financed by the University of Utrecht. As professor of energy physics, he investigated why photovoltaic cells are more efficient in using solar energy than plants. Molecular transport in plant cells turned out to be the limiting factor.Minimum entropy production in photosynthesis (pdf) additional note For the Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands he studied the Pebble Bed Reactor.The end of the Pebble Bed Reactor? ; Technology Assessment HTR ‚Äì Summary and Conclusions In 2002 Andriesse formally retired. He remained active at the Institute for the History and Foundations of Mathematics and Natural Sciences (IGG) of the University of Utrecht for several more years.  Books  After age forty Andriesse started to write fiction for a general audience. In his novels, he steps back from exact science and sketches poetic, often erratic images of a disordered world. His first historical novel \\"Titan kan niet slapen\\" ( \\"Titan cannot sleep\\") got a place on the longlist of the AKO Literatuurprijs in 1994. It is about the life and works of Christiaan Huygens (1629‚Äì1695), and it has been translated in French and English. \\"De opstand\\" and \\"Alsnog een portret voor Heinsius\\" are historical novels about the physician Gadso Coopmans (1746‚Äì1810) and the politician Anthonie Heinsius (1641‚Äì1720).

It stands some to the south of Acle in an isolated position adjacent to a farm. History The tower dates from the 12th century, and the nave and chancel from the 14th century. The south porch was added during the 16th century, and the east wall of the chancel was rebuilt during the 1870s. Architecture =Exterior= St Mary's is constructed in flint and red brick, with limestone dressings. The tower and nave are tiled, and the chancel and porch are slated. Its plan consists of a nave with a south porch, a chancel, and a west tower. The tower is in Norman style, the nave and most of the chancel are Gothic, the porch is Tudor, and the east wall of the chancel is in Georgian style. The tower is round with a conical roof. It has a slit window high on the south side, on the north side is a louvred bell opening, and on the west side is a blocked two-light Decorated window. The porch has a sundial in the southwest corner, a niche over the doorway, and blocked three-light windows on each side. The south wall of the nave is divided into three bays by stepped buttresses. In the middle bay is a three-light window with Perpendicular tracery. In each of the two lateral bays is a two-light window with Y-tracery. The south wall of the chancel contains two two-light windows and a priest's door. The chancel roof is at a lower level than that of the nave; the east gable of the nave is hung with slates. The east wall of the chancel is brick and contains a three-light window. At the northeast corner of the chancel is a stone and flint buttress. In the north wall of the chancel, and in the eastern bay of the nave, are wide single lancet windows. The other bays of the north wall of the nave contain two- and three-light windows, and a doorway. =Interior= In the south wall of the chancel is a double piscina and a sedilia. The benches in the chancel date from the 17th century and are carved with poppyheads. The communion rail dates from the same period and is carried on turned balusters and posts. At the southeast corner of the nave are the remains of a former stairway that led to a rood loft. On the wall of the nave are 14th-century wall paintings in relatively good condition. Those on the north wall depict Saint Christopher, and on the south wall are paintings representing the Seven Acts of Mercy. The nave also contains a wall monument to Edmund Anguish who died in 1616. The octagonal pulpit dates from the early 17th century; it is finely carved, and has a backboard and a tester. The font is also octagonal, each face is carved with a pair of blind arches; it dates from the 13th century, and is carried on a central stem and eight shafts.

It was the second of three Pegasus satellites to be launched, following the launch of Pegasus 1 three months earlier. The Pegasus spacecraft were manufactured by Fairchild Hiller, and operated by NASA. Spacecraft Pegasus 2 was a Pegasus spacecraft, consisting of of instruments, attached to the S-IV upper stage of the carrier rocket which had placed it into orbit. It had a total mass of , and was equipped with two sets of micrometeoroid detection panels, and a radio for tracking and returning data. The panels were long, and equipped with 116 individual detectors. Launch The launch of Pegasus 2 Pegasus 2 was launched atop a Saturn I rocket, serial number SA-8, flying from Launch Complex 37B at the Cape Kennedy Air Force Station. The launch occurred at 07:35:01 UTC on 25 May 1965. Following launch, Pegasus 2 was given the COSPAR designation 1965-039A, whilst NORAD assigned it the Satellite Catalog Number 01381. Pegasus 2 was a secondary payload on the carrier rocket, which was carrying a boilerplate Apollo spacecraft, Apollo 104 or BP-26, as part of a series of configuration tests for the Apollo program. The Apollo boilerplate acted as a payload fairing for the Pegasus spacecraft, which was stored inside what would have been the Service Module of a functional spacecraft. Upon reaching orbit, the boilerplate Command and Service modules were jettisoned. Boilerplate separation occurred 806 seconds after liftoff, with Pegasus 2's detectors being deployed one minute later. The predicted orbital lifetime of Pegasus 2 was 1220 days. Operations Pegasus 2 was operated in a low Earth orbit. On 3 July 1965 it was catalogued as being in an orbit with a perigee of and an apogee of , inclined at 31.7 degrees to the equator and with a period of 97.15 minutes. Once in orbit, the panels were deployed to detect micrometeoroid impacts. Experiment results were returned to Earth by radio. The spacecraft operated until 29 August 1968, and subsequently remained in orbit until it decayed and reentered the atmosphere on 3 November 1979.

Designed by Marco Donadoni, the chief game designer at IT, Zargo's Lords was the first fantasy wargame to be produced in Italy,Zargo's Lord review (in Italian) and was well received both in Italy and abroad. It sold well into the early 1980s and in some countries (including Italy) it was instrumental in letting wargames be known to a larger audience.Zargo's Lords reviewReview of Zargo's Lord at Boardgamegeek Due to the success of the game, IT later released an expansion set; moreover, the fantasy setting created by IT for Zargo's Lords was later used in other, independent games. After Zargo's Lords, IT published several other fantasy wargames, including Wohrom and Idro.List of games by IT, with brief descriptions General description As with most of Donadoni's games, Zargo's Lords is a hex map-based wargame. It is intended for 2‚Äì4 players. The game, as was usually the case with IT productions, is characterized by sophisticated graphics (by artist Enea Riboldi) and good quality materials. The large map of the game depicts the four continents of the fantasy world of Zargo. These are inhabited by four factions: the \\"Knights\\", the \\"Monks\\", the \\"Winged men\\", and the \\"Dragons\\". Every faction has different units with different features; for example, the knights mostly rely on brute force, while monks have magic powers (such as teleportation and the ability to cast spells), the dragons throw flames at distant targets, and Winged units can fly over mountains and other obstacles. At game setup, each faction controls a continent, as well as four cities, that are placed by the player using that faction. The objective of the game is to conquer enemy cities. Related games and influence In 1983 IT released Zargo's Lords II, an expansion set (described at the time as a \\"gamette\\") with two additional factions, the \\"Amazons\\" and the \\"Arachnids\\", as well as updated and revised rules. Another independent game from IT, Blue Stones (1987), was later set in the world of Zargo.Review of Blue Stones (in Italian) After IT went bankrupt (in 1988), another company, Eurogames, acquired most IT material and produced a series of game that largely relied on IT earlier projects; one of these was a Risk-like game based on the same fantasy setting as Zargo's Lords and entitled Zargos (1989).Information on Eurogames productions, including ZargosReview of \\"Zargos\\" Angelo Porazzi, designer of the Warangel wargame, has often mentioned Zargo's Lords as one of the main influences on his own work. Reception Elisabeth Barrington reviewed Zargo's Lords in The Space Gamer No. 31. Barrington commented that \\"If you don't mind slight difficulties in moving pieces, finding rules, and sorting through four CRTs, this is a fun game. The background is a familiar one, but the scenario is novel in some ways and uses some interesting ideas.

Typical prepress or fixed page size output formats like PostScript or PDF are not reflowable during the actual printing process because the page is not resized. For end users, the World Wide Web standard, HTML is a reflowable format as is the case with any resizable electronic page format. In contrast to end user terminology, the notion of reflow is sometimes used to discuss desktop publishing program features for print publication page layout such as automatically balancing the amount of text in a number of columns. Reflow is not limited to text; 21st century scorewriters enable music notation to be reflowed between systems and pages in a similar way to how text reflows between lines and pages.  Examples  Besides HTML, commercially available systems include: * EPUB is a simple reflowable format that allows a single column with inline images, in many ways similar to a stripped-down HTML. * Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) introduced XAML-based documents together with a viewer call \\"SinglePageViewer\\" that can reflow any WPF objects. However the XPS document standard also introduced by Microsoft with WPF does not support reflow. * Tagged PDF documents can contain an additional data layer that (among other things) allows content to reflow within the boundaries of one original page. * FictionBook is a free reflowable format by design. It does not specify the appearance of a document; instead, it describes its structure. For example, there are special tags for epigraphs, verses and quotations.

It connects the Neuwied station on the Right (east) Rhine line to the major railway junction at Koblenz Hauptbahnhof (central station) and to the Left (west) Rhine and Moselle lines. History  The railway line and the Crown Prince William Bridge were built during the First World War, for military and strategic reasons, by the Prussian state railways and opened on 15 August 1918. Also built at the same time were the Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen, together with a connection to the Ahr Valley Railway and the Hindenburg Bridge at Rudesheim, together with a connection to the Nahe Valley Railway. On 15 September 1935, Urmitz Rheinbr√ºcke halt was opened. The line was put out of service on 9 March 1945, late in the Second World War, by the demolition of the line by German pioneers and reconstruction was not completed until 1954. Just two years later, the bridge was damaged by fire, with repairs lasting until May 1957. On 22 September 1962, the bridge became fully functional again, with two tracks, upgraded and electrified with overhead wire. For a better connection to the Brexbach Valley Railway and the Westerwald, a single track curve was built connecting to the right bank line running south towards Engers station but it was never put into operation. In 1987, the Urmitz Rheinbr√ºcke halt was closed. After the renovation of the bridge in 2005, the halt was reopened on 28 May 2006. Route  Map The line branches from the Right Rhine line in Neuwied station on the approach from the north as a two track line; the branch is a flying junction. The current crossover at Neuwied Rheinbr√ºcke was formerly the location of the junction to the connecting line to Engers station and the Brexbach Valley Railway. Urmitz Rheinbr√ºcke halt is immediately west of the end of the Urmitz railway bridge. The line then runs on an embankment through the Neuwied Basin and crosses the A 48 autobahn. At Kesselheim junction, a single track line branches off to run on the eastern side of the line and continues on the eastern side of the Left Rhine line, which it merges with in the Koblenz north industrial area in Koblenz-Bubenheim. In the northern track field of Koblenz-L√ºtzel station, there is a connection to the port railway of Koblenz Rhine port. The line crosses the Left Rhine line for the first time and runs through the northern track field of Koblenz-L√ºtzel station to the west and parallel with the Left Rhine line and continues through Koblenz- L√ºtzel station and over the Moselle railway bridge, which was widened to accommodate four tracks in 1927. At the location of the former Koblenz station of the Rhenish Railway, the line branches. Two tracks run on a large curve to the right to the former Koblenz Moselle freight yard and one track continues to run parallel with the Left Rhine line through Koblenz-Stadtmitte station to Koblenz Hauptbahnhof.  Operations  The only passenger services on the line, until December 2010, was one local train line. This runs hourly between Cologne Hauptbahnhof and Koblenz Hauptbahnhof, some starting at Rommerskirchen station or M√∂nchengladbach Hauptbahnhof, and leaves the Right Rhine line at Neuwied station. The first stop on the line is at Urmitz Rheinbr√ºcke halt, where the line has already reached the left (western) bank of the Rhine. RE 8 Rhein-Erft-Express stops at the western platforms of Koblenz-L√ºtzel and Koblenz Stadtmitte stations. Since the timetable change on 12 December 2010, the Regionalbahn RB 10 service (RheingauLinie) is also operated hourly by the VIAS company. The service previously ran from Frankfurt via Wiesbaden and R√ºdesheim am Rhein to Koblenz and it is now extended to Neuwied. Its only stop between Koblenz and Neuwied is at Koblenz-Stadtmitte.

History Black Prince was founded as a coach hire firm 1969 by Brian Crowther, a former employee of British Rail. Its name was inspired by Edward, the Black Prince, a statue of whom stands in the centre of Leeds. In 1986, deregulation introduced on-road competition local bus service operation. Black Prince moved into scheduled service operation, launching a number of routes centred on Morley in competition with Yorkshire Rider. A variety of second-hand vehicles were acquired to operate the routes, and a livery of red and yellow introduced.

Although this move reduced competition in Leeds, it was approved by the Office of Fair Trading as Black Prince had intended to close if the acquisition had not taken place. This was one of the first uses of the failing-firm defence, which was created under the Enterprise Act 2002. The takeover was completed on 31 July 2005.

It was the last of three Pegasus satellites to be launched, the previous two having been launched earlier the same year. It was manufactured by Fairchild Hiller, and operated by NASA. Spacecraft Pegasus 3 was a Pegasus spacecraft, consisting of of instruments, attached to the S-IV upper stage of the carrier rocket which had placed it into orbit. It had a total mass of , and was equipped with two sets of micrometeoroid detection panels, and a radio for tracking and returning data. The panels were long, and equipped with 116 individual detectors. Launch Pegasus 3 was launched atop a Saturn I rocket, serial number SA-10, flying from Launch Complex 37B at the Cape Kennedy Air Force Station. The launch occurred at 13:00:00 UTC on 30 July 1965. Following launch, Pegasus 3 was given the COSPAR designation 1965-060A, whilst NORAD assigned it the Satellite Catalog Number 01467. Pegasus 3 was a secondary payload on the carrier rocket, which was carrying a boilerplate Apollo spacecraft, Apollo 105 or BP-9A, as part of a series of configuration tests for the Apollo program. The Apollo boilerplate acted as a payload fairing for the Pegasus spacecraft, which was stored inside what would have been the Service Module of a functional spacecraft. Upon reaching orbit, the boilerplate Command and Service modules were jettisoned. Operations Pegasus 3 was operated in a low Earth orbit. On 3 September 1965 it was catalogued as being in an orbit with a perigee of and an apogee of , inclined at 51.6 degrees to the equator and with a period of 95.15 minutes. Once in orbit, the panels were deployed to detect micrometeoroid impacts. Experiment results were returned to Earth by radio. The spacecraft operated until 29 August 1968, and subsequently remained in orbit until it decayed and reentered the atmosphere on 4 August 1969. It had originally only been expected to operate for 720 days.

His ancestor, Jean-Conrad Hottinguer, created the Bank Rougemont, Hottinguer & Cie. in 1786. In doing so, he added a 'u' to the family name, to preserve the Germanic pronunciation; see also House of Hottinguer. After 20 years as CEO of the Hottinger Group, Rodolphe Hottinger is now CEO of La Financi√®re Rodolphe Hottinger SA He is also a Board Member of Petrolin SA.  Early life and education  Arms of the Hottinger dynasty. Rodolphe Hottinger is the seventh Baron Hottinger. Rodolphe Hottinger was born in Paris in 1956 to Henri Hottinger and Josyane Van Laere. He is the eldest of two children, and the head of the seventh generation. He attended high school at the Coll√®ge Bernard Palissy in the 17th arrondissement in Paris, and went on to obtain a university degree at the Acad√©mie de Commerce International. After his studies, Rodolphe Hottinger held several trainee and assistant positions at various well-known banking establishments in Paris, London, New York, Hong Kong and Singapore, namely Coutts & Co., Brown Brothers Harriman, Baring Brothers, Kidder Peabody, and Chemical Bank. In 1981, Rodolphe Hottinger left Paris for New York to secure and expand the family's financial operations. In doing so, he re-established the Hottinger name in the United States, a presence which dated back to the first half of the 19th century. At that time, Jean-Conrad and Jean-Henri Hottinguer forged an alliance with Heinrich Escher, and created the first Hottinger branch in the United States. Heinrich Escher later returned to Switzerland where his son, Alfred Escher, founded the Zurich Polytechnic school, and was also one of the co-founders of the Schweizerische Kreditanstalt, later named Credit Suisse.  Career  In 1982, Rodolphe Hottinger created the brokerage firm Hottinger Bros. in New York, a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers. In 1987, he was instrumental for the creation of the Swiss Helvetia Fund, the first Swiss close-end investment firm listed on the New York Stock Exchange, which deals in equity and equity-linked securities of Swiss companies. That same year, he was named Managing Partner at Hottinger & Cie. in Zurich, a position he would hold for the next twenty-three years. Other positions held during this period include President of the management board of Emba NV, (listed on Euronext until 2007), from 1990 to 2009, and President and CEO of the Swiss Helvetia Fund (listed on the NYSE ) from 1997 to 2009. He rang the closing bell of the New York Stock Exchange on October 3, 2007. Rodolphe Hottinger was a member of the Board of Directors of AXA RE US from 1983 to 2002, AXA Life and P&C; Switzerland from 1998 to 2006 and AXA Winterthur Life and P&C; from 2007 to 2012. After 30 years with the Hottinger Group and 20 years as its CEO, Rodolphe Hottinger now manages La Financi√®re Rodolphe Hottinger. In 2010 he decided to create his own operation to address the specific challenges that financial institutions now face in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. According to the website of FINMA, the Swiss regulatory body for banks and securities dealers, La Compagnie Financi√®re Rodolphe Hottinger (a wholly own subsidiary of La Financi√®re Rodolphe Hottinger) has discontinued its activities as a security dealer.  Philosophy  Rodolphe Hottinger with his grandfather, Baron Rodolphe Hottinguer (1902‚Äì1985) Rodolphe Hottinger remains inspired by a speech given by his grandfather, Baron Rodolphe Hottinguer (1902-1985), as Chairman of the EC Banking Federation, at the inaugural meeting of Bankers' Day in Munich on 14 November 1963. > The example of the past should allow for the pursuit of this ancestral > occupation of banking. To qualify it, to define it, to anticipate what it > might become: therein lies the secret of its future. In the conduct of its > forebears and the example they set, our banking family will receive the > encouragement to persevere, the intelligence to change and adapt, the > character to overcome challenges, and the hope to undertake new ventures. > :- Max G√©rard, Messieurs Hottinguers et Cie.

It was based mostly in Scania, although it at times had active local chapters in other places. For a time, it saw itself as a Swedish equivalent of the Progress Party in Denmark and Progress Party in Norway.  Early years  The party was founded on 6 November 1968 by Bertil Rubin, a former Member of Parliament for the Centre Party, and the remains of the minor parties Medborgerlig samling and Samling f√∂r framsteg. The party soon had 10,000 members and planned to run for the 1970 general election, but it failed because of economic problems. The party won only three mandates in Klippan and was practically dissolved as a national party following the defeat. The party lost all its mandates in Klippan after the 1973 local elections and was largely just active in the municipality of Motala through the 1970s. The party was refounded at a party congress in Norrk√∂ping in 1979, with Nils Lindgren of Motala as party chairman. The party for the first time ran in an election with a national list. In 1979 and 1980, the party was visited by Mogens Glistrup of the Danish Progress Party and evolved into an outspokenly right-wing populist party through the 1980s, inspired by him. For the 1982 general election, the party changed its name to the Swedish Progress Party under the new chairman Stefan Herrmann, with chapters in Motala and Stockholm. Stickers then included messages such as \\"AIDS comes from abroad\\", \\"the woman back to the stove\\" and \\"let the booze free\\". In the 1988 general election, the party had its strongest base in √ñsterg√∂tland.  Two Progress parties  The Swedish Progress Party was founded as a national party in a congress in Helsingborg on 11 March 1989. The party then added to its base defectors from the Centre Democrats in Scania, Mittpartiet in √Önge, L√∂ntagarepartiet in √Östorp and Kommunens V√§l in Skurup. Tony Wiklander of L√∂ntagarepartiet was elected as new party chairman, an established local politician in √Östorp with a history in the Left Party and the Social Democrats. By 1990, the party claimed 2,000 members in twenty chapters around the country. However, Wiklander was expelled as chairman in June due to comments in the media that were seen as too extreme and his connections with the early Sweden Democrats and the New Swedish Movement. Wiklander then chose to establish a new party with the old Progress Party name in October the same year, with economic support from millionaire Carl Lundstr√∂m. In the electoral campaign for the 1991 general election, Wiklander's party claimed that Swedes would become \\"a minority in their own country around the year 2055\\". In the general election, both parties won six mandates in municipalities in southern Sweden and Wiklander's party had become the most important local party in southern Sweden. In √Östorp, Wiklander's party started a cooperation with New Democracy and an immigration-skeptical faction of the Social Democrats. As New Democracy emerged with similar policies, this led the primary financier of the Progress Party, Carl Lundstr√∂m, to change his support to New Democracy. The Helsingborg chapter of the party then reshaped itself into Svensk Samling which merged into the Sweden Democrats in 1998. Later, most of the leaders joined the National Democrats when that party was formed from the split of the Sweden Democrats in 2001. Most municipal chapters, including that of party leader Tony Wiklander's in √Östorp, waited until after the split of the Sweden Democrats in 2001 and thereafter merged with the Sweden Democrats, the more moderate faction. In √Östorp, Kommunens framtid was formed in January 2002 as a replacement for the Progress Party for the 2002 general election. By 1997, the Progress Party had likely no more than 300 members. A local Progress Party was founded in Bjuv in March 2000, gaining two seats in the municipality in the 2002 local elections. Allan J√∂nsson was the party chairman from the start and was turned into a local Sweden Democrats chapter before the 2006 general election.  Election results  = Local representation = In the 1970 general election, the party received three mandates in Klippan. In the 1985 general election, the party received one mandate in Motala. In the 1991 general election, the party received three mandates in Landskrona, two in Helsingborg. In the 1994 general election, the party received one mandate in Bjuv, two in Landskrona, two in Markaryd and two in √Östorp. In the 1998 general election, the party received two mandates in Bjuv, four in Landskrona and one in √Östorp. In the 2002 general election, the party received two mandates in Bjuv.

A. Bayona and written by Sergio G. S√°nchez. It is based on the experience of Mar√≠a Bel√≥n and her family in the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. It features an international cast including Naomi Watts, Ewan McGregor and Tom Holland. The film received positive reviews from critics for its direction and its acting, especially for Watts who was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress, the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress ‚Äì Motion Picture Drama, and a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role. Plot English doctor Maria Bennett, her husband Henry Bennett, and their three sons Lucas, Thomas, and Simon go on a Christmas holiday in 2004 to Khao Lak, Thailand. Arriving on Christmas Eve, they settle in and begin to enjoy the brand new Orchid Beach Resort. Two days later on Boxing Day, the massive 2004 tsunami inundates the area. Maria and Lucas eventually emerge from the swirling water and find one another, with Maria having sustained serious injuries to her leg and chest. They help a toddler, Daniel, from the wreckage and are soon found by locals who dress and transfer them to a hospital in the city of Takua Pa. Daniel is separated from them during the journey. At the hospital, Maria encourages Lucas to help others find their family members while she goes into surgery for her chest injuries. Meanwhile, Henry, Thomas, and Simon have also survived and are together. Henry leaves the two boys with another family who are then taken to the mountains for safety by local relief crews. Henry stays behind to search for Maria and Lucas in the resort's rubble. While out looking, injured and alone, he is picked up by a passer-by and driven to a nearby bus station with other survivors. Communication facilities are scarce, but a European tourist named Karl, who has also been separated from his family, lends Henry his cell phone to contact his relatives in England. Henry promises Maria's father he will look everywhere for his family and that he will find them. Karl volunteers to accompany Henry to look for Maria and Lucas as well as his own family, who were at the beach when the tsunami hit. While Maria is in surgery, her medical chart is mixed-up with a patient named Muriel Barnes, who has died. Lucas returns to find his mother's bed empty and is then taken to a tent where children without families are kept safe. The mistake is discovered when Lucas cannot identify any of the dead woman's jewelry and he is subsequently reunited with his mother, who had been moved to a private room in the ICU. While he waits in the hospital, Lucas finds Daniel, who has been reunited with his father. Henry and Karl search for their families in various places before they arrive at the hospital, where Henry is given five minutes to look. Karl gives him a piece of paper with the names of his family members. A vehicle carrying Thomas and Simon also stops outside the hospital, and the boys get off so Simon can urinate. From a distance, Lucas recognizes his father, and while searching for him in the chaotic crowd outside, Lucas's brothers spot him and they reunite. Henry finds the three of them together. He learns that Maria is in the hospital, ready to undergo more surgery for her leg. As the anesthesia puts her to sleep, Maria experiences flashbacks of how she came to be injured and how she surfaced the water. While in surgery, Lucas tells his father he has something really important to tell Maria. The following day, the family boards an ambulance airplane to Singapore so Maria may receive further medical treatment. A representative from their insurance company, Zurich Insurance, assures them everything will be taken care of as Lucas sees countless people outside the hospital looking through patient lists. On the plane, Lucas tells his mother that Daniel is safe with his father. Maria cries and looks out the window at the chaos left behind as the plane takes off.

Filmed between the Ciudad de la Luz studio in Alacant (Spain) and Thailand. Principal photography began 23 August 2010 in Alacant and continued in October in Thailand. Director Juan Antonio Bayona decided not to specify the nationalities of the main characters in order to create a universal film in which nationalities were irrelevant to the plot. The tsunami was recreated with a mixture of digital effects and real water surges filmed in slow motion created in a water tank in Spain using miniatures that were destroyed by a huge wave. Bayona committed to working with real water rather than a computer- generated wave because he wanted the story to be authentic. This meant Watts and Holland spent five weeks filming physically and psychologically demanding scenes in a massive water tank. Holland, aged 14 at the time of filming, later described it as a \\"scary environment ...You can imagine how tiring and brutal that was.\\" The Impossible is the second collaboration between Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor after appearing together in the 2005 film Stay. Release Warner Bros. released the film in Spain on 11 October 2012. The United States distribution rights were pre-bought by Summit Entertainment. A teaser trailer was released on 26 December 2011. After a full-length English language trailer was released on 20 August 2012, a United States release date of 21 December 2012 was confirmed by Summit. It was released on 11 October 2012 in Spain and in Ireland and the United Kingdom on 1 January 2013. The film was released in the United States on 4 January 2013 and was made available by Summit Entertainment through a website streaming the film to members of SAG-AFTRA for consideration of the SAG awards. It was released on DVD/Blu-ray in the United States and Canada on Tuesday, 23 April 2013, with a European release 13 May 2013. Reception =Critical response= Naomi Watts' performance garnered critical acclaim and she received her second Academy Award & SAG nomination and her first Golden Globe nomination. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film an approval rating of 81% based on 201 reviews, with an average rating of 7.32/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"The screenplay isn't quite as powerful as the direction or the acting, but with such an astonishing real-life story at its center, The Impossible is never less than compelling.\\" At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating to reviews, the film had an average score of 73 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating \\"generally favourable reviews.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun- Times gave a perfect four-star rating, praising the performances of Watts and McGregor, and the direction of Bayona. He called it \\"one of the best films of the year\\". Deborah Young of The Hollywood Reporter gave a very positive review, praising the performances of the two leading stars, stating that \\"Watts packs a huge charge of emotion as the battered, ever-weakening Maria whose tears of pain and fear never appear fake or idealised. McGregor, cut and streaked with excessive blood he seems too distraught to wash away, keeps the tension razor-sharp as he pursues his family in a vast, shattered landscape.\\" About the film she added, \\"The Impossible is one of the most emotionally realistic disaster movies in recent memory ‚Äì and certainly one of the most frightening in its epic re-creation of the catastrophic 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.\\" Justin Chang of Variety magazine gave a positive review, praising Bayona's directing and S√°nchez's writing: \\"Collaborating again after their impressive 2007 debut feature, The Orphanage, Bayona and Sanchez get many things right here, starting with their decision to eschew a more panoramic view of the disaster to follow one family's journey from start to finish.\\" About the performances of the main cast members he added, \\"Watts has few equals at conveying physical and emotional extremes, something she again demonstrates in a mostly bedridden role, and McGregor, in one of his better recent performances, manages to turn a simple phone call home into a small aria of heartbreak. Holland, in his live-action bigscreen debut, is wonderful as a kind, somewhat short-tempered kid who still has plenty to learn, setting the tone for similarly heartrending turns by young Joslin and Pendergast.\\" A village near the coast of Sumatra lies in ruins after the tsunami that struck South East Asia Damon Wise of The Guardian gave the film four stars out of five. He also praised the performances, stating that \\"as Maria, Watts is both brave and vulnerable, and her scenes with the young Lucas (the excellent Tom Holland) are among the film's best, with adult and child now unexpected equals, the mother humbled, the son rising to the challenge. McGregor, meanwhile, gives one of his best performances as the sad and desperate Henry, trying to play the hero, the provider, while knowing his cause is almost certainly lost.\\" About the film, he added: \\"Part of the appeal of this affecting and powerful drama is that it puts the viewer right in the moment at every stage, using authentic locations and tsunami survivors to hammer home the reality of this tragedy.\\" Eric Kohn of IndieWire gave the film a \\"B-\\" grade and stated that the film \\"suffers from the greater problem of emphasising a feel-good plot within the context of mass destruction.\\" According to The New York Times reviewer A. O. Scott, this narrowly-defined cinematic framing of the disaster through European and not Thai lenses represents \\"a troubling complacency and a lack of compassion in The Impossible,\\" a movie which he found to be \\"less an examination of mass destruction than the tale of a spoiled holiday.\\" =Response from victims= Simon Jenkins, a British survivor from Portsmouth, wrote to The Guardian, stating the film is \\"beautifully accurate\\". This was in response to critics commenting that the film is \\"overdramatic\\" and \\"whitewashed\\". He says of the comments, \\"As I must, I've never been the sort of person to revisit and analyse events of the past, but some of these articles frustrated me. Had this film been purely about the tale of a western middle class family's 'ruined' holiday then I would have agreed. For me, it was the exact opposite. Rather than concentrating on the 'privileged white visitors', the film portrayed the profound sense of community and unity that I experienced in Thailand, with this family at the centre of it. Both for my (then) 16-year-old self and the Bel√≥n family, it was the Thai people who waded through the settled water after the first wave had struck to help individuals and families... The Thai people had just lost everything ‚Äì homes, businesses, families ‚Äì yet their instinct was to help the tourists.\\" =Box office= The Impossible was a box office success. In Spain the film was released on 11 October 2012, and opened in 638 cinemas, grossing $11,569,306 on its opening weekend, ranking No. 1 with a per-cinema average of $18,134, the highest-grossing opening weekend for a film in Spain. On its second weekend the film remained at No. 1 and grossed $9,016,065 with a per-cinema average of $14,022. On its third weekend it remained at No. 1 and made $5,768,184 with a per-cinema average of $9,098. The film ended up earning $54,536,668 at the Spanish box office and $180,274,123 worldwide, compared with its estimated $45 million production budget. = Accolades = See also * Survival film about the film genre, with a list of related films References External links  * 2012 films 2010s disaster films 2012 drama films Survival films Spanish films Spanish disaster films Spanish drama films English-language films 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami Disaster films based on actual events Drama films based on actual events Films about death Films about families Films about tsunamis Films about vacationing Films set in 2004 Films set in Thailand Films shot at Ciudad de la Luz Foreign films shot in Thailand Telecinco Cinema films Films directed by J.

He was Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1792, was Professor of Divinity at the University of Edinburgh and a Founding Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. right Life Andrew Hunter of Dumfriesshire, was born in 1743, eldest son of Andrew Hunter., W.S, in Edinburgh, and Grizell Maxwell of Cardoness. He was educated at the High School and then studied divinity at the University of Edinburgh under Rev Prof Robert Walker, but did not graduate. He then spent a year in Utrecht furthering his studies in Calvinist theology. He was then made a licensed probationer by the Presbytery of Edinburgh in 1767, though it seemed he refused to take up any formal position while his father, whom he adored, lived. He was ordained as minister to the Second Charge (the New Church) of the Parish of Dumfries, on 20 September 1770. He inherited Abbotshill on the death of his father, but sold the estate and instead purchased the estate of Barjarg near Dumfries from James Erskine in 1772 and remained for nine years. He was awarded the degree of Doctor of Divinity by the University of Edinburgh in 1779 and transferred to New Greyfriars Church, Edinburgh, on 25 November 1779. This post was to be held in conjunction with the professorship of divinity at the university, which he held jointly with the aging incumbent, Professor Hamilton, with no salary but with a view to succeeding him. From his own funds he establish a prize for the best theology essay by his students. On 21 October 1785, the Town Council presented him to the Tron Church, He took up post on 2 April 1786. Dr Hunter's lecturing and preaching style is described as \\"earnest and affectionate\\" and reports of his character portray him as amiable but unruffled. Even when urging against the dangers of public unrest, his language was \\"moderate and conciliatory\\". He was elected Moderator of Assembly on 17 May 1792. It was the time of the French Revolution and the British Government was anxious that the Church do all in its power to calm growing popular demands for political reform. The General Assembly was anxious to show its loyalty to the Government and passed motions urging Ministers to remind their parishioners forcibly of how blessed they were to live in a free country ruled over by a beneficent monarch. The Assembly sent congratulations to the Duke of York on his marriage to the Princess of Prussia and approved measures to promote the Protestant religion in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland (this was an annual measure, drawing upon funds specially donated by the Crown). In the year following he declined the customary appointment as one of His Majesty's Chaplains in Ordinary. In 1783 he was a founding fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (and of its predecessor, the Newtonian Society). He took part in its deliberations, though not always successfully. He once turned up to give a talk, with a mass of papers under his arm, announcing he would deal with twelve topics. The Preses (chairman) said he had twelve objections to this, and took some time to deliver them, followed by six members who took it in turn to add their objections. Dr Hunter listened glumly throughout the evening, then gathered his papers together and left in silence. Andrew Hunter died at his home at the head of New StreetEdinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1800-01 on the Canongate in Edinburgh on 21 April 1809. He had collapsed suddenly \\"with an inflammation\\" after having returned from a Holy Fair (regional Communion Services) in Leith. He died after a few days illness, calmly assured of a future life. He is buried in Canongate Kirkyard on the Royal Mile. Family On 14 April 1779, he married the Hon. Marion (aka Mainy or Mary) Schaw Napier (born 5 Aug. 1756, died 9 Oct. 1806), the eldest daughter of William Napier, 7th Lord Napier, with whom he had three sons and three daughters.

Her first sport idols were table tennis players Angelica Rozeanu and Sari Szasz, who were then at the peak of their careers. When Pascu's father took a position at the Romanian Fencing Federation, she transferred her interests to the sport, which was practiced at the Athenaeum of Bucharest, and whose athletes spoke French. At the age of eleven, she began to take fencing lessons with Italian master Angelo Pellegrini. Future champion Maria Vicol featured amongst his other pupils. Pascu won the 1963 Junior World Championship in Ghent, a result she considers as the best of her career. She joined the senior national team, which featured Maria Vicol and Marina Stanca. They were later joined by Olga Szabo, Ileana Gyulai, Ecaterina Stahl and Suzana Ardeleanu. Romania was one of the only countries at the time offering centralised training in fencing: the national team trained twice a day, nine months a year.

The site of the complex at 1361 Amsterdam Avenue in Manhattan - predating residential development in Harlem - was chosen due to its relative isolation at the time.  History  = Brewery = Beginning in the 1830s, German immigrants brought to New York a brewery tradition which ultimately triumphed, and by 1880, Yorkville, the Lower East Side, Williamsburg and Bushwick, all had become home to large populations of German immigrants, and also home to more than a hundred breweries. The Mink Building site has variously housed the following breweries: Casper Heindel, Manhattan Brewery (10th Avenue & 128th Street); 1865-1870 William Maack, Manhattan Brewery 1870‚Äì1875; Yuengling & Co., Manhattan Brewery 1875‚Äì1880; D. G. Vuengling, Jr., Manhattan Brewery 1880‚Äì1884; D. G. Yuengling Brewing Co. 1884‚Äì1897; John F. Betz, Manhattan Brewery (Amsterdam Avenue & 128th Street) 1897‚Äì1901; Betz & Sons Brewing Co. of New York City; Manhattan Brewery 1901‚Äì1903; and the Bernheimer & Schwartz, Pilsener Brewing Co.; readdressed to 127th to 129th & Amsterdam in 1903‚Äì1920, after which brewery operations were shut down by National Prohibition. The property originally part of the Excelsior Brewery, followed by the Manhattan Brewery. While the Betz Brewery was operating, so was the Lion Brewery, owned by Max E. Bernheimer and his brother Simon, along with partners August Schmid and Anton Schwartz (April 23, 1853-November 6, 1910). Both the Betz Brewery and the Lion were extremely successful. In 1875, David G. Yuengling, Jr. purchased the property in the dense, industrial enclave in the deep valley between Morningside and Hamilton Heights near the Hudson River. Nearby was the D. F. Tiemann pigment factory, a worsted mill. and the first buildings of Manhattan College. The following year, in 1876, The New York Times reported Yuengling Brewery establishment, whose structures make up a small town. . . now has equipment which comprises all the latest ideas in brewing science. It drew its pure water from artesian wells on the property which the newspaper said were ‚Äúof unlimited capacity.‚Äù The giant red-brick brewery included a swimming pool and opulent parlors for entertaining dignitaries, who included King Edward VII of England. On August 7, 1903, the New York Tribune reported the sale of the property to J. F. Betz Brewery, which is considered one of the best brewery plants in equipment and one of the largest in size in this country. The complex included a single span bridge over and across West 128th Street. It would be two-years before the site for the Bernheimer & Schwartz Pilsener brewery complex was completed. The malt house complex featured on a lithographic calendar in 1914 shows the complex in its heyday.Lithographic Calendar The Bernheimer & Schwartz Pilsener Brewing Company was extremely successful. The members of the Bernheimer family directly involved in the brewery company, Simon Emanuel Bernheimer (1849-1911), and Max E. Bernheimer (1855-1913); both Bernheimer brothers died suddenly. In July 1923, The New York Times reported, A flood of prewar beer was let loose into Harlem sewers yesterday when Federal prohibition officers began the destruction of 836,000 gallons of non-de-alcoholized lager and 4,000 barrels of twelve-year-old ale at the plant of the Bernheimer Schwartz Pilsener Brewing Company, 128th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. =Later years= During prohibition, the complex was adapted for use by several businesses, including dairy, cold storage, and laundry. Most of the complex returned to brewery use for the Horton's Pilsner Brewing Company in the 1930s. 423-427 West 127th Street was constructed in 1934-1936 and Horton went out of business in 1941. The Mink Building eventually became in the 1940s. the site of Interborough Fur Storage Company, a storage facility where the wealthy stored their furs for the summer before becoming office space in the late 1990s. Of the two brewery complexes that remain on Manhattan island, 1361 Amsterdam Avenue is part of a malt house complex considered the finest ‚Äî with ethnic German architectural motifs ‚Äî and the most complete.https://www.huffingtonpost.com/todd-fine/the-mink-building- and-dis_b_8518826.html The property was calendared for consideration as a historic landmark in the 1990s. In 2011, Manhattan Community Board 9 tried to put an end to the standoff between preservationists and developers last week, by voting overwhelmingly to remove the building from consideration as a historic landmark. Current building owner Janus Property Company and Cushman and Wakefield lease approximately of space to commercial, nonprofit, and civic tenants. Janus is redeveloping the area around 126th and Amsterdam as part of the Manhattanville Factory District, and as part of the development, the Mink Building is being converted into affordable housing and high-tech office space. Architect Louis Oberlein, an architect working at the turn of the 20th century designed 1361 Amsterdam Avenue, possibly along with partner, Anthony Pfuend. A reminder of the period when brewing was a major industry in New York, this complex of buildings is the larger, more architecturally distinguished and intact of the two groups of brewery buildings surviving in Manhattan. The buildings were designed mostly in the American Round Arch style popular for industrial buildings at the time. Oberlein was originally employed by a firm called Lederle, Wessely & Company, which designed a building at 196 Broadway that has since been demolished. Oberlein started his own practice sometime after he was commissioned to design the Bernheimer & Schwartz Pilsener Brewing Company, the complex which included the Mink Building. The architect designed not only the brewery but also surrounding buildings that met the company's other needs. Records indicate that Oberlein worked primarily for Bernheimer & Schwartz, although he designed the Mt. Kisco Brewing Company and a stock house, which still stands today at 37th Street and 1st Avenue in Manhattan.Real Estate Record and Builders' Guide. Publication. 1555 ed. Vol. 61 A review of the Mink building, as well as the stock house in mid-town, shows that Oberlein was skilled in the German-American style of building, perhaps contributing to his popularity with brewers. Bernheimer & Schwartz wanted their building to advertise their business, and so Oberlein was able to use German building characteristics to achieve this. This largely consisted of the decorative brick patterns found on the fa√ßade of the Mink Building. There is also usually an emphasis on floors, windows, and verticality in German- American architecture, all traits that Oberlein used to distinguish his buildings as German. Site and design The Mink Building is located in northern Manhattan, adjacent to the Hudson River, in Manhattanville. This settlement was initially part of the Dutch settlement of Harlem.Eric K. Washington, Manhattanville: Old Heart of West Harlem, 7. Even after New York became a British colony and then a state, this area maintained its status as a crossroads. The form of the Mink Building derives largely from its original use as a brewery owned by German-Americans, and especially from its architect, Louis Oberlein. The Mink Building contains concrete slab floors supported by interior columns and load bearing masonry exterior walls. The floor slabs are visible on the fa√ßade as stylistic elements. Concrete is used to supplement the brick elsewhere on the fa√ßade, and reveals places of structural significance, such as the upper corners of the windows.

American Airlines, Inc., 107 F.3d 1565 (Fed. Cir. 1997), was a case for the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in which Lawrence B. Lockwood sued American Airlines, Inc for patent infringement for their reservation system, SABREvision. The case was first heard by the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, which ruled in favor of American Airlines, Inc. In the summary judgment for that case, the court ruled that American Airlines, Inc's SABREvision system did not infringe on U.S. Patent Re. 32,115, U.S. Patent 4,567,359,. and U.S. Patent 5,309,355. held by Lockwood. Furthermore, the court ruled that the '355 patent was invalid under 35 U.S.C. ¬ß 102. and the asserted claims of the '359 patent were invalid under 35 U.S.C. ¬ß 103.. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld these rulings in favor of American Airlines, Inc. based on the fact that district court determined there were no genuine issues of material fact in dispute. Participants =The Plaintiff= The plaintiff in this case was Lawrence B. Lockwood, who held the '115, '359 and '355 patents. He also holds seven other patents, with a total of ten patents in his name. Most of the patents he holds are related to \\"systems\\" of a \\"self-service\\" nature used for \\"sales presentations\\". Robert M. Taylor, Jr. of the law firm Lyon & Lyon LLP in Costa Mesa, California argued for Lockwood. =The Defendant= The defendant in this case was American Airlines, Inc. an American-based airline company. It is one of the major airlines companies in the United States and second-largest airline company in the world. Don W. Martens of the firm Knobbe, Martens, Olsen & Bear LLP in Newport Beach, CA argued for American Airlines. Joseph R. Re and Paul A. Stewart were also on the case. Martens was one of the founding members of his firm and is now a mediator for the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. =The Court= This case was presented for the United States District Court for the Southern District of California presided by Judge William B. Enright. Judge Enright started as a deputy district attorney in San Diego, CA in 1951 and was appointed to the United States District Court for the Southern District of California in 1972. This case was then argued before the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit before circuit Judges Haldane Robert Mayer, Alan David Lourie and Randall R. Rader. Mayer was appointed to the court in 1997 and was Chief Judge from 1997 to 2004. Lourie was appointed to the court in 1990. Rader was appointed to the court in 1990 and became Chief Judge in 2010. Background Lockwood sued American claiming that their SABREvision reservation system infringed on the three patents he held, '115, '359, and '355. =SABREvision= SABREvision is the reservation system created by American. It is an improved version of SABRE, the original system that American developed in the 1960s. SABREvision is used by travel agents * to access schedules * fare information * to book itineraries * to retrieve photographs of places of interest, including ** hotels ** restaurants ** cruises for their customers. =U.S. Patent Re. 32,115= This patent is for \\"a self service terminal for dispensing voice and video information, printed documents, and goods; and for accepting service orders and payments therefor by currency or credit card\\". The district court ruled that SABREvision did not infringe this patent because it was not in violation of the following four parts of the asserted Claim 11: * \\"a substantially self-contained apparatus dimensioned to be easily transported\\" * \\"audio-visual means\\" * \\"customer operated means\\" * \\"means for collecting payments\\" =U.S. Patent 4,567,359= This patent is for \\"a system for automatically dispensing information, goods and services to a customer on a self-service basis including a central data processing center in which information on services offered by various institutions in a particular industry is stored\\". The district court ruled that SABREvision did not infringe this patent because it did not have \\"audio-visual means\\" or \\"customer-operated input means\\" as was asserted by Claim 1. In addition, the district court ruled that patent '359 was invalid because its claims were obvious in combination of the original SABRE system and the patent reissued as '115. =U.S. Patent 5,309,355= This patent is for \\"An apparatus for composing individualized sales presentations created by various data sources from customer profiles managed by organizational hierarchy matrixes directed by multiple operating programs\\". The district court ruled that SABREvision did not infringe this patent because it did not \\"compose 'individualized sales presentations' or 'selectively combine' customer information to retrieve its photographs\\" as was asserted by Claim 1. Additionally, the district court found the '355 patent invalid because it could be anticipated by the '359 patent under 35 U.S.C. ¬ß 102(b). Patent Validity =Patent '359= The district court ruled that the patent '359 was invalid because its claims were obvious due to the prior art in patent '631 and American's original SABRE reservation system. Lockwood argues that SABRE is not prior art because certain algorithms of the system were not available to the public and therefore an expert would not be able to reproduce the system. In addition, he claims that even if SABRE was considered prior art, combining it with patent '631 was not enough to claim patent '359 was obvious. American responds that SABRE was unveiled in 1962 and was used by many different airlines by 1970. While there are \\"inner workings\\" that were kept hidden, the functionality of the system was known. The appellate court decides that, as American stated, despite the fact that certain implementation details of SABRE were \\"inner workings\\", the public knew and used these features, and so it constitutes prior art. Additionally, the court does not agree with Lockwood's argument that the actual terminals described in both patents are different and therefore that the SABRE system combined with patent '631 was enough to claim that patent '359 was obvious. =Patent '355= The district court ruled that patent '355 was invalid because its claims were anticipated by the '359 patent. The '359 patent was issued from the first of five applications. In addition, the '359 patent described the invention in patent '355. In order for the '355 patent to be valid, it must have an early enough filing date. The issue was whether the third, fourth and fifth applications were entitled to the filing date of the second application, which was undisputedly entitled to the benefit of the filing date of the first application. The district court ruled that not all of the third, fourth and fifth applications described the invention with accurate detail and therefore, patent '355 was not entitled to the earlier filing date. Lockwood argued that the court only looked at the applications for the patents themselves, but failed to recognize that it was enough to show that he was \\"in possession\\" of the invention. The appellate court disagreed with Lockwood's argument and held that the conditions for being entitled to an earlier filing date can only be satisfied by what is described in the applications themselves, not to any ideas implied by them. The court ruled that the patent '355 was invalid. Patent Infringement The district court ruled that American Airlines did not infringe on any of the three patents that Lockwood held. Lockwood argues to the appellate court that the district court \\"misconstrued\\" the claims of each of the patents. =Patent '115= Lockwood claims that \\"self-contained\\" means \\"apparatus or collection of components which includes the materials necessary for the apparatus to function on its own\\". However, American claims that this argument contradicts the argument Lockwood presented to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office when the patent was prosecuted. The appellate court agrees with American that Lockwood cannot claim one definition during that presentation and another one during this case. Lockwood also argues that \\"audio-visual\\" means either audio or video, not necessarily both and that SABREvision violates that. The district court ruled, and the appellate court agrees, that both are necessary and that SABREvision cannot produce any audio presentations. In addition, Lockwood argues that \\"customer\\" should be interpreted as \\"someone with whom you do business\\" which includes the travel agents that use SABREvision. However, American claims that the patents expressly claim that the point of the invention is to eliminate travel agents, and therefore, the \\"customer\\" of both structures is different. The appellate court agrees with American's claim. =Patent '359= For this patent, Lockwood made similar arguments regarding \\"customer\\" and \\"audio-visual\\" as with the '115 patent. The appellate court held the same rulings it did with the patent '115. =Patent '355= Lockwood disputes the district court's ruling that SABREvision's requirement of \\"manually selec[ting] and view[ing]\\" is not equivalent to \\"composing and displaying individualized sales presentations\\". However, the appellate court agrees with the district court ruling that the two structures are different in that aspect. Conclusion The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upholds the ruling made by the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. This ruling states that * the '359 patent is invalid because it was obvious and the '355 patent is invalid because its claims were anticipated by the '359 patent * the '115 patent, the '359 patent, and the '355 patent were not infringed by the SABREvision reservation system References External links * 1997 in United States case law United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit cases United States patent case law ","title":"Lockwood v.

The murders and surrounding story were the subject of an ITV drama series The Secret, broadcast in April and May 2016. Howell killed his wife Lesley (n√©e Clarke) and the husband of his lover, Trevor Buchanan (who was an RUC officer), in what appeared to be a suicide pact between the spouses of two lovers. The bodies were found in a fume-filled car in Castlerock on 19 May 1991. In 1998 Howell confessed the murders to his second wife, but she agreed not to inform the authorities. She was investigated following his arrest, but was not charged. Howell's ex-brother-in-law has since accused him of murdering Harry Clarke. Howell's father-in-law died only 11 days before Lesley. After murdering his wife, Howell received a payout of ¬£400,000. He later lost ¬£350,000 in a get-rich-quick scheme which had claimed to find Yamashita's gold in the Philippines. Howell had been led to believe he would make ¬£20 million; however he only acquired a few brass ammunition boxes, containing silver coins, worth about ¬£30. Howell initially invested ¬£100,000 but, over six months, steadily invested more after being told that the gold was buried under booby-trapped tunnels. He sold his shares in two dental practises and attempted to persuade friends to invest. He believed that this, and the death of his son, were punishments from God. Howell, a native of Portadown and a dentist by occupation, was a deeply religious father of nine and a former lay preacher. He married Lesley in July 1983 and together they had four children. They were members of the local Baptist church. After his wife's death Howell married Kyle Jorgensen, a native of New York, with whom he had five children. Howell confessed his role in the murders to elders in his church, who urged him to inform police. He pleaded guilty to the murders on 18 November 2010 and was sentenced to life imprisonment. He was told he must serve a minimum 21-year jail term. His former lover Hazel (n√©e Elkin, formerly married to Trevor Buchanan, currently married to David Stewart) claimed in court that she acted under duress, but was found guilty of the murders of Lesley Howell and Trevor Buchanan in March 2011 and sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 18 years. The trial judge stated that Hazel Stewart could have prevented Buchanan's death. Police investigators were later criticized for having overlooked some facts, most notably that the driver's window was open and that Buchanan's leg was hanging out of the open car door; in addition, a witness had told police that Howell had previously tried to murder his wife. On 17 May 2011 Howell pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting nine female patients in his surgery over a period of several years. He was consequently stripped of his National Health Service pension.

An Ekal Vidyalaya teacher was killed by Naxalites for ignoring their directive not to teach Hindu culture. As of July 2003, the FTS was operating 6,966 schools with 222,775 students. By July 2007, the FTS and the Ekal Vidyalaya was operating over 23,000 schools. The FTS had the goal of operating 30,000 schools by 2011. The target was achieved and surpassed by March 2010 itself reaching 34,000 schools with 10,30,290 students. The society is associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which belongs to the Sangh Parivar, a Hindu nationalist organization, although FTS officials claim to be independent of these organizations. After a 2004 electoral victory by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Madhya Pradesh, the Human Resources Development minister Murli Manohar Joshi gave credit to the FTS for helping achieve the BJP victory. In May 2005, the Union Human Resource Development Ministry stopped grants to the FTS for their schools after an inquiry reported that the organization was misusing this funding. The FTS was said to be inflating their school registers, failing to provide educational material and teaching divisive ideology. In December 2010 the State Bank of India donated money to purchase teaching materials for 150 one-teacher schools in the Patna area.

Several years later, another such song is in the making, and instead of legends, those who will be featured in the music video are youth icons of India who can lead and inspire more than 50 per cent of India's population. The man behind this venture is Dhanapal Padmanabhan of Minveli Media Works, who had earlier made A Little Dream, a documentary on former President Dr. Abdul Kalam. After some time Dhanapal decided to make a music video on the song, that Kalam wrote for the youth, so that it will reach many more youngsters in India. Dhanpal's intention while making this song was to celebrate the power of Indian Youth and inspire them. Dhanpal said, \\"Dr. Kalam is always ready to do anything that reaches and inspires the youth of India. With a song by Kalam, I can reach as many youngsters as possible, and my intention was to make it as grand as possible. So, I have decided to show the diversity in our landscape and the huge talent that is available\\". Dhanpal added that the obvious choice for the slot of music director was Yuvan Shankar Raja, because of his young age, and also he is the \\"Youth Icon\\". Dhanpal added more, \\"When I told Yuvan about the project, he said that he was honoured to compose music for such a video.\\" Yuvan was very excited about the whole idea and he will be on the lead for the video with Kalam. Dhanapal concludes, \\"This will be a National Anthem for the Youths in India\\". Video Shoot Dhanapal has planned to shoot at all the heritage places in India like the India Gate, Jaipur Fort, etc. He says, \\"I will show various Indian dance forms dancing to Kalam's song. Yuvan's music is aimed at the youth, so it will be fast paced and aggressive in nature.

It has been called a masterpiece. The cedar shingled synagogue won the Interfaith Forum on Religion, Art, and Architecture excellence in design award. Jaffe called on Kabbalistic symbolism, the famed light of the Hamptons, and local vernacular traditions to create a contemporary religious space that uses architecture to shape spiritual experience. New York Times architecture critic Paul Goldberger described it as \\"a building that is at once a gentle tent and a powerful monument, at once a civic presence that celebrates community and a place of quiet meditation that honors solitude\\". History and use The Jewish Center of the Hamptons (JCOH) was founded in 1959 when 23 individuals living in the East Hampton area began meeting for services in their own homes. As the congregation grew and migrated to various borrowed facilities, the need for their own permanent facility became clear. Land was acquired and, largely through the efforts of local financier Evan Frankel, funds were raised to construct a facility. In 1983, Frankel he met with Jaffe to discuss the project. Jaffe eagerly pursued the commission and, although he encountered some resistance from the board of directors, he eventually was chosen to design the new sanctuary when he offered his services pro bono. Jaffe initially imagined Gates of the Grove as a tent in the woods ‚Äî an elemental structure consisting of little more than a canopy roof. He quickly realized that he would need to adapt this vision to the needs of the congregation and the board and looked to wooden synagogues of Eastern Europe for inspiration. His final design, approved in 1984, continued the east-west longitudinal axis of the existing structure on the property via a new volume attached to its west end. Despite the complexity of his solution, he‚Äôd managed to preserve the essence of the original idea‚Äîthe luminescent feeling of a tent softly lit by the sun‚Äîthrough an array of bent porticos separated by skylights. The Gates of the Grove Jaffe made many design decisions on site. He also engaged tradespeople and encouraged them to contribute to the creative development of the project. Randy Rosenthal, a painter and carpenter, co-designed and hand-carved extensive wood detailing, including the doors. Dennis Lawrence, a woodworker, developed a unique hinge for the ark. At completion, expenses totaled nearly $2 million. The building was dedicated in 1987. New York Attorney General Robert Abrams presided over the ceremony, attended by four hundred people. Members of the local government and clergy attended as a gesture of public support. East Hampton Town Supervisor Judith Hope later featured Evan Frankel in her column in the East Hampton Star, writing, ‚ÄúBy his personal example he proved that sensitive development, development that respected the delicate integrity of nature, was viable.‚Äù Though JCOH uses tents for high holiday services‚Äî‚Äìthe congregation is now 400 families‚Äì‚Äîthe facility remains largely as Jaffe had intended. Gates of the Grove continues to hold weekly Shabbat services year-round every Friday night and Saturday morning. From Memorial Day to Labor Day, the Jewish Center of the Hamptons hosts Shabbat on the Beach on Fridays with hundreds of people in attendance. Rabbi Joshua Franklin and Cantor/Rabbi Debra Stein currently serve as the Jewish Center of the Hamptons clergy. Shabbat on the Beach Site and context Jaffe made his first trip to the Hamptons in the 1960s. ‚ÄúArriving for the first time, I was taken with the flat, green, pool-table, horizontal character of the landscape,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe sky came down dramatically.‚Äù He initially stayed with friends for weekend visits but as his commissions in the Hamptons increased, the gravitational pull of the East End increased. In 1973, he moved his practice to Bridgehampton. Jaffe once said, ‚ÄúThe site is at once the base, the foreground, and the background.\\" At the Jewish Center, he manipulates the multiplicity of this definition in a structure that is both formally interesting and completely integrated into the site and greater context. Set back from the street and tucked behind the style of privet hedge favored by Hamptons‚Äô estate owners, the synagogue is at once visible but not tangible. Jaffe used mature trees at the north end of the relatively flat property as a leafy backdrop for Gates of the Grove. In the foreground, a grass lawn extends from Woods Lane to the south elevation. From the road the fa√ßade is manifest but from the parking area at the east end of the site, a bed of shrubs and ornamental trees screens the southeast view, revealing the synagogue only as one reaches the entrance. Form Jaffe‚Äôs design research introduced him to the wooden synagogues of Eastern Europe, where an inventive building style had developed in the early 18th century. He took particular interest in these buildings‚Äô tiered roofs, lovingly crafted interiors, and the way that wood conveyed a simplicity and forthrightness. By the 1930s all extant examples of these synagogues were destroyed by the Nazis but in referencing this history, Jaffe revived a lost tradition. Gates of the Grove Sanctuary Viewed from the west elevation, the synagogue appears as a series of staggered bent forms that allude to the tiered roofs that Jaffe admired. On the south elevation‚Äîthe longitudinal side and point of entry‚Äîthe building resembles a long, low barn punctuated by vertical windows. Congregants enter at the southeast corner of the structure and turn west toward a loggia that acts as an interlude and a transition to the sanctuary space, visible beyond. Jaffe researched Judaism and its symbolism extensively and applied his understanding of the faith in a variety of ways. His simple exterior reflects Judaism‚Äôs desire to turn inward. Many Chasidic stories emphasize that the Messiah will be indistinguishable in outside appearance from any other ordinary person. Here, the understated exterior of the sanctuary conceals an exalted interior. Outside the Jewish Center of the Hamptons In the sanctuary space, seating faces north so that congregants sit with their backs to the road. Indirect light filters through a series of north-facing skylights‚Äîthe main source of illumination‚Äîthat evoke a spiritual sensibility and create the tent-like luminescence that Jaffe envisioned. The repetition of alternating glass and solid creates a governing rhythm that evokes a higher geometric order, and the structure of the building, concealed within wood cladding, assumes a weightlessness quality. Here again, Jaffe used symbolism, representing the numerology of the Kabbalah and the number ten, a significant number in Judaism. Moses received Ten Commandments and a quorum of ten men is required for public services. In the sanctuary, ten structural sections line the side-walls. Within each of these is a prayer niche; carvings in each niche list one of the ten attributes of God. The building becomes a collection of metaphorical aspects of faith, a space that‚Äôs imbued with spirituality and meaning on multiple levels. Materials and methods In addition to its references to Eastern Europe, Jaffe‚Äôs use of wood also reflects local vernacular architectural traditions that date to the early settlers of East Hampton. He clad the exterior of the wood-framed synagogue in plain cedar shingles, the preferred building material of the area since the 1600s. In a subtle variation on the decorative patterns typical of the late nineteenth-century Shingle Style (an interpretation of early colonial architecture), Jaffe integrated rows of Star of David-shaped shingles into shingle courses at several key locations. Over the years the unstained exterior has weathered to an inky brown, while the finished interior paneling retains the pale blush of newly sawn wood. Architect I.M. Pei has said, ‚ÄúArchitecture has to have an element of time.‚Äù Here, time expresses itself in the building‚Äôs patina, amplifying the architectural message by distinguishing the realities of the exterior world from the eternal quality of the spiritual realm. The interior space offers another play in contrast. Jaffe inverts the traditional relationship between cold stone and warm wood, pairing floors of soft, sensual Jerusalem limestone with clear Alaskan cedar paneling. The irregular stones, chipped at the edges, recalled a horizontal Wailing Wall. On the dados where the wood-clad walls meet stone, the exposed vertical edges are unfinished, a Jewish tradition for cornerstones. We, like stones, are works in progress. (pamphlet) Every wall and ceiling surface is covered in paneling. Together with the pews and bima, crafted from the same material, this architectural condition contributes a unifying effect that prevents the elaborately detailed carvings from becoming overly dominant. Jaffe layered wood in a hierarchical fashion: beyond the smooth wood cladding of the interior, congregants see the aged shingles of the exterior and beyond these, mature trees. Significance Architect and author Henry Stolzman proclaimed Gates of the Grove as one of the finest examples of modern synagogue design. Architectural historian Carol Herselle Krinsky called it ‚Äúa building that deserves an exceptional place among postwar synagogues in this country and Europe.‚Äù The most telling commentary, perhaps, speaks of an emotional response to the space. Paul Goldberger described Gates of the Grove in Why Architecture Matters, writing, ‚ÄúIn the sanctuary of the synagogue, as in all great religious buildings, something takes us a bit away from the secular life, away from the rational.‚Äù Indeed, the building‚Äôs transcendent atmosphere incites reverence in the most skeptical non-believer. In that light, it shouldn‚Äôt come as a surprise that Norman Jaffe later acknowledged that the project rekindled his own Jewish faith.

Together with his wife, Sigrid Marie Christie (18 April 1923 - 16 May 2004) he worked from 1950 on the history of Norwegian church architecture, particularly stave churches. Their research resulted in Norges Kirker which consisted of seven major volumes covering churches in √òstfold, Akershus and Buskerud. Biography Christie was born at Nannestad in Akershus, Norway. He was the son of Hartvig Caspar Christie (1893-1959) and his wife Elisabeth Theodora Stabell (1898-1977). His father was a Provost who supervised Church of Norway parishes in Akershus including √òstre B√¶rum, H√∏vik, Asker and Nannestad. His family resided in the minister's house by in Nannestad. He participated in the resistance during Nazi occupation of Norway and in 1945 he entered the Norwegian Institute of Technology in Trondheim, where he graduated in 1949. As a student, he worked as assistant to the architect Gerhard Fischer. He continued as an assistant to Fischer from 1950 and was hired as building historical consultant / research fellow at the Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage project on Norwegian churches. From 1970, he was an antiquarian until he retired in 1991. He was a researcher from 1994 at the Norwegian Institute for Cultural Heritage Research. H√•kon Christie was a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters and the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. He was appointed a Knight of the 1st Class in the Order of St Olaf and was awarded the Grosch medal, Urnes Medal and Europa Nostra award. Sigrid Marie Bing Christie graduated from the University of Oslo in 1949 with a master's degree in art history. From 1950 to 1970, she was a research fellow with the Norwegian Research Council. She was a member of the Liturgy Commission of 1965 (Liturgikommisjonen av 1965) which undertake a comprehensive revision of the Liturgy of the Church of Norway. She was employed in the National Archives (Riksantivar) from 1970. In 1974, she earned her Ph.D. She was a co-editor of the Norwegian Artists Lexicon (Norsk kunstnerleksikon) from 1978 to 1986. In 1988 Sigrid Christie became a knight of St. Olav's Order and in 1999 she received the Urnes medal (Urnes-medaljen). Sigrid Christie died during 2004 and H√•kon Christie in 2010.

Emergency medical services in Portugal are organized in three separate systems, one each covering Continental Portugal, the Azores and Madeira. The largest system is SIEM, which covers the territory of Continental Portugal. The modern Portuguese emergency medical services were created in 1964, and were initially provided only in the major cities of Lisbon, and later Porto, Coimbra, Aveiro, Set√∫bal and Faro, by PSP Police ambulances and staff. These services were accessible through a telephone call to the national emergency number 115. In 1971, the National Ambulance Service (SNA) was created. It was later absorbed into the National Institute of Medical Emergencies (INEM) when it was created 10 years later. The Integrated Medical Emergency System (SIEM) was created as a part of INEM in 1980. In the 1990s the national emergency number 115 was replaced by the European common emergency number 112. Services in Continental Portugal In Continental Portugal, there are three major emergency medical services providers: the National Institute of Medical Emergencies (INEM), the fire departments, and the Portuguese Red Cross. INEM is the agency of the Portuguese Ministry of Health responsible for coordinating the Integrated Medical Emergency System (SIEM) of Continental Portugal, and directly providing some of its emergency medical services. Of the services provided by INEM, some are operated by their own staff (e.g. guidance centers and ambulances in major cities), while the operation of others is delegated to the staff of local fire departments, and of the Portuguese Red Cross, but using INEM's equipment (e.g. ambulances in small towns). Fire departments are traditionally the major providers of local emergency medical services outside of major cities in their respective areas of responsibility, which usually coincide with the territory of a municipality. Virtually all of the more than 400 fire departments include an emergency medical services unit. The services are provided through the use of the departments' own equipment and/or, with equipment delegated by INEM. In major cities, the emergency medical service units of fire departments serve as backups or reinforcements to INEM. The Portuguese Red Cross ‚Äì through its Corps of Rescue Units (CORUS) ‚Äì is another major provider of medical emergency services. It usually acts as a backup or reinforcement to both INEM and the fire departments. =Integrated Medical Emergency System (SIEM)= The Integrated Medical Emergency System () or SIEM, is centrally managed by the National Institute of Medical Emergencies (INEM). It covers Continental Portugal and operates like other organised Emergency medical services around the world. In Portugal, the free of charge phone number for emergency medical service is the Europe wide 112 (emergency telephone number). When someone dials \\"1-1-2\\", the call is directed to a PSP Police dispatch center. The PSP dispatch center redirects the call accordingly for the type of emergency to the appropriate emergency services. In continental Portugal medical emergency calls are directed to one of INEM's urgent patient guidance centers () or CODU's. There are four regional CODU's; Lisbon, Porto, Coimbra and Faro. Additionally, there is the CODU-Mar that responds to maritime medical emergencies. Under the coordination of CODU's, a number of specialized mobile resources operate, including ambulances, fly cars, air ambulances and motorcycle ambulances. The ambulances are either directly operated by INEM from its regional delegations, or are operated from the medical emergency and reserve posts installed in the local fire departments, or local delegations of the Portuguese Red Cross. Besides CODU's, SIEM also operates INEM's Anti- Poison Information Center (CIAV), which provides 24/7 toxicological medical information at a national level (including in the Azores and Madeira), as well as the Pediatric Inter-Hospital Transport (TIP) subsystem, which provides emergency transportation of high risk newborns to specialized hospital units. =Mobile Resources= SIEM includes standard medical emergency mobile resources, some of them directly operated by INEM, while others are operated by fire departments, the Portuguese Red Cross, or other entities. The following resources exist: * Ambul√¢ncia de emerg√™ncia m√©dica (AEM) ‚Äì basic life support ambulance, crewed by two emergency medical technicians. All AEM ambulances are owned by INEM, but the operation of some is delegated to other entities such as local fire departments. AEM's are complemented by fire department owned fire rescue ambulances (ABSC). * Ambul√¢ncia de suporte imediato de vida (SIV) ‚Äì immediate life support ambulance, similar to an AEM, but with an emergency medical nurse in its crew instead of a second emergency medical technician. * Viatura m√©dica de emerg√™ncia e reanima√ß√£o (VMER) ‚Äì resuscitation and emergency medical vehicle (fly car), crewed by an emergency medical physician and a nurse. * Ambul√¢ncia de suporte avan√ßado de vida pedi√°trico ‚Äì pediatric advanced life support ambulance, crewed by a physician, nurse, and an emergency medical technician. * Helic√≥ptero de emerg√™ncia m√©dica ‚Äì medical emergency helicopter (air ambulance), crewed by two pilots, a physician and a nurse. * Motociclo de emerg√™ncia m√©dica ‚Äì medical emergency motorcycle (motorcycle ambulance), crewed by a single medical emergency technician. * Ve√≠culo de interven√ß√£o em cat√°strofe ‚Äì disaster intervention vehicle, carrying advanced life support equipment, and able to set up a small field hospital and mobile communications center. File:Ambulancia INEM.jpgINEM AEM ambulance File:Album pic218.jpgINEM VMER Services in the Portuguese Atlantic Islands As part of their unique administrative powers, the Portuguese autonomous regions of The Azores and Madeira have their own separate emergency medical services, each controlled by their respective regional secretaries of Health. These services are smaller than those on continental Portugal, but share many common features with SIEM. =Madeira= In Madeira, emergency medical services are coordinated by the Regional Medical Emergency Service (SEMER), which mirrors the role and function of INEM on continental Portugal specifically for the region. SEMER includes the Rapid Intervention Medical Team (EMIR), which is prepared to provide medical rescue in any part of the region, including rescue in maritime and air environments if needed. =The Azores= In the Azores, emergency medical services are centrally managed by the Regional Civil Protection and Fire Service. =Air ambulance= Unlike continental Portugal, where air ambulance services are typically provided directly by INEM with its own helicopters, in the Atlantic islands, the Portuguese Air Force is in charge of emergency patient evacuations between islands, and from ships. Rotary and/or fixed wing aircraft (usually EADS CASA C-295 aircraft operated by the 502 Squadron, and EH-101 helicopters operated by the 751 Squadron), are used in combination if needed.

It is based on the concept of application business logic separation into middleware layer. This is also called three-tier software architecture. Although there are many application servers for Java platform, there are no cross-platform application servers for .NET and Mono. The main principle of TNAPS is that a developer has to write business logic only and would be able to host it and set user access policy, database parameters and other configuration without writing code ‚Äì just by existing component reusage. Current version of TNAPS requires .NET 4 (Windows) and Mono 2.10.1 (Linux and Mac OS X)  Basics  TNAPS focuses on business logic implementation. Developer applies principle of decomposition and splits server side logic into set of components (called business objects in TNAPS). The main idea behind this decomposition is to get business objects that provide some value to the end-user (the one using client application). Developer defines business objects contracts for accessing created server functionality and implement client application using contracts. After finishing set of business objects development they should be arranged into Bizlet - one server application instance in TNAPS. Bizlet contains business objects, database configuration, user access permissions and hosting parameters (i.e. IP address and port to listen). Developers or end-users of the TNAPS application can decide what kind of logic provide to the respective use by granting or revoking access to particular business object. Business objects access permissions are defined at the user group level.  Features  * Development of three-tier applications is straightforward. * Developer has no problems with hosting, security, channel encryption, user access management etc. * Windows administrators-oriented management console (MMC snap-in). * User can switch between database server types without rewriting code. * TNAPS supports all .NET languages. * Database access technologies - all available in .NET : ADO.NET, LINQ, EDM * All logic written for local TNAPS server can be migrated to cloud hosting providers like Amazon EC2 without rewriting. * Extensibility - almost every part of the server can be extended by user.  Management  TNAPS configuration is done within TNAPS Management Center (or Console). It is a snap-in for Microsoft Management Console.  Hosting  TNAPS uses .NET Remoting for network communications. That means that client application can be implemented using .NET or Mono platform only. However, developer can extend TNAPS with WCF or any other hosting technology through hosting provider extension. TNAPS Remoting Host Provider has some advanced (comparing to standard .NET Remoting) features: Channel Encryption, Traffic Signing and Traffic Compression.  Licensing & Pricing  TNAPS is freeware, proprietary application server.  TNAPS 3  On June 9, 2011 TN reported that TNAPS 3 is being in the early beta-testing process. TNAPS 3 features .NET and Mono compatibility as well as multiple operation systems support: Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. New major version of TNAPS application server uses component-driven approach and application can be created by combining existing components. This concept is a further development of business object approach from TNAPS 2. Other TNAPS 3 features include: * Ability to use .NET languages and Java in one application. * SOAP and REST support for communications. * Universal web console for server management and application development. * TNAPS Marketplace for applications and components. Starting from version 3 TNAPS can not be called pure .NET Application Server as it supports Java hosting. However, TNAPS core engine runs inside .NET or Mono.

Although the earliest such constructs fitting this description come from the Neolithic British Isles, with a few also dating to later Bronze Age Britain, British hillforts were primarily constructed during the British Iron Age. Some of these were apparently abandoned in the southern areas that were a part of Roman Britain, although at the same time, those areas of northern Britain that remained free from Roman occupation saw an increase in their construction. Some hillforts were reused in the Early Middle Ages, and in some rarer cases, into the Later Medieval period as well. By the early modern period, these had essentially all been abandoned, with many being excavated by archaeologists in the nineteenth century onward. There are around 3,300 structures that can be classed as hillforts or similar \\"defended enclosures\\" within Britain.Hogg 1979. Most of these are clustered in certain regions: south and south-west England, the west coast of Wales and Scotland, the Welsh Marches and the Scottish border hills.Alcock 2003 p. 179.Forde-Johnston 1976. p. 01. British hillforts varied in size, with the majority covering an area of less than 1 ha (3 acres), but with most others ranging from this up to around 12 ha (30 acres) in size. In certain rare cases, they were bigger, with a few examples being over 80 ha (200 acres) in size.Forde-Johnston 1976. p. 04. Various archaeologists operating in Britain have criticised the use of the term \\"hillfort\\" both because of its perceived connection to fortifications and warfare and because not all such sites were actually located on hills. Leslie Alcock believed that the term \\"enclosed places\\" was more accurate, whilst J. Forde-Johnston commented on his preference for \\"defensive enclosures\\".Forde- Johnston 1976. p. 03. Bronze Age hillforts British hillforts, as now recognised, first appeared in the Late Bronze Age. Archaeologists Sue Hamilton and John Manley believed they were a part of \\"...substantial landscape and social reconfigurations at the start of the first millennium [BCE]\\", that coincided with the change of three characteristics of British Bronze Age society: \\"...disappearance of an archaeologically visible burial rite, ... increased deposition of prestige metalwork in rivers, ... and the demise of a middle Bronze Age settlement format of groups of round houses set within enclosures.\\"Hamilton and Manley 2001. p. 07. They went on to note that \\"Accrued place-value may have been important in the establishment of the earliest hillforts. These are often in locations with conspicuous traces of previous ritual monuments. This may have been a means of validating new social practices through making links with the past\\".Hamilton and Manley 2001. p. 11. This idea was examined in more depth by ethnologist J. Forde-Johnston, who made note of how a number of Iron Age hillforts had been built close to earlier Bronze Age barrows. Commenting on the fact that both types of monument typically were constructed in high locations, he said, \\"It is not surprising that the two features should coincide in several dozen cases.\\" He added that it was possible that hillforts had been intentionally sited near barrows for defensive protection from the \\"...sacred associations of the burial place.\\"Forde-Johnston 1976. p. 103. Maiden Castle in England is one of the largest hill forts in Europe. Photograph taken in 1935 by Major George Allen (1891‚Äì1940). Iron Age hillforts British Camp, a contour hillfort at Herefordshire Beacon. The Iron Age hillforts have remained dominating features in the British landscape: as ethnologist J. Forde-Johnston noted, \\"Of all the earthworks that are such a notable feature of the landscape in England and Wales few are more prominent or more striking than the hillforts built during the centuries before the Roman conquest.\\" He continued, describing them as an \\"eloquent testimony of the technical ability and social organization of the Iron Age peoples.\\" On a similar note, the English archaeologist J. C. D. Clark remarked that \\"[Iron Age] Hillforts are at once among the most impressive and informative of our prehistoric antiquities. They impress by their mere size, by the height of their ramparts, by the depth of their ditches, by the extent of the areas they enclose, and frequently by their commanding position.\\"Clarke 1948. p. 80. There was \\"immense variation subsumed within the class of monuments called hillforts\\",Bowden and McOmish 1989. p.12. and those of the British Iron Age have been characterised as belonging to four different types. The main two are contour and promontory forts, and the lesser two are hill- slope and plateau forts. Contour forts are those \\"...in which the defences cut off the upper portion of a hill from the ground below by following, more or less, the line of the contours encircling it.\\" Promontory forts are typically defined by \\"...an area to which the approach is limited, to a greater or lesser extent, by natural features such as cliffs, very steep slopes, rivers etc. Where such features exist little or nothing in the way of man-made fortification is required.\\" Hill-slope hillforts, rather than \\"enclosing the hilltop in the manner of contour forts, are situated on the sloping ground on one side of it, overlooked by the crest\\", whilst plateau forts \\"face level ground on all sides, regardless of their elevation above sea-level\\"; these final forts then are often, although by no means always, located in plateaus, hence their name.Forde-Johnston 1976. p. 05-08. Iron Age hillforts made use of both natural and man-made defences, with the former including such geographical features as cliffs, steep slopes, rivers, lakes and the sea, and the latter largely consisting of banks and ditches. There were actually two forms of banks built at such sites: revetted and glacis. Revetted banks present \\"a vertical or near-vertical outer face to the enemy. This outer face or revetment is normally of timber or dry stone walling, or a combination of the two, and retains the core of earth, chalk, clay etc., derived in most cases from the outer ditch.\\" Glacis banks on the other hand \\"are usually triangular in cross-section and at their simplest consist of a single dump of the material excavated from the ditch.\\"Forde-Johnston 1976. p. 04, 12-14. The number of these such ramparts differs in Iron Age British hillforts; some, which are known as univallate, are single-rampart only, whilst others, known as multivallate, are multi-rampart forts. Commenting on their distribution across southern Britain, Forde-Johnston stated that \\"roughly one-third of the Iron Age forts in England and Wales have multivallate defences, the remaining two-thirds being univallate.\\"Forde-Johnston 1976. p. 08-11. It has been suggested that only the innermost rampart would be manned with the other ones serving more to make space and breakup charges.Thompson 1991. p. 117. =Purpose= The reason for why British Iron Age peoples built hillforts is still under dispute. One school of thought, dominant amongst archaeologists in much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, holds that they were primarily defensive structures built in an era of intertribal warfare. However, in the late twentieth century, various archaeologists began to challenge this assumption, claiming that there was not sufficient evidence to back it up. As Mark Bowden and Dave McOmish remarked, \\"there is a tendency to assume that they were all built for similar purposes and are all performing similar functions\\", something that they note may well not have been true.Bowden and McOmish 1989. p. 12. Taking a similar stance, archaeologist Niall Sharples noted that \\"It is clear from [my] analysis of the sequence [of construction] at Maiden Castle, and by comparison with other sites, such as Danebury, that hillforts do not have a single function. A variety of different activities can be associated with these sites and with time the importance or perhaps the emphasis of certain activities changed dramatically.\\"Sharples 1991. p. 83. Defensive usage It has been traditionally assumed that hillforts were constructed for defensive purposes in the Iron Age. Describing warfare of the period, archaeologist Niall Sharples stated that war was such an integral part of all agricultural human societies that it was possible \\"to believe a priori that after the introduction of agriculture [in the Neolithic,] warfare was a constant feature of the prehistoric societies of the British Isles.\\"Sharples 1991. p. 80. It was in this context, he believed, that hillforts were constructed as defensive positions. Writing in 1948, J.G.D. Clark commented that hillforts' \\"defensive character cannot be stressed too often.\\"Clarke 1948. p. 04. Another archaeologist to hold a similar viewpoint, Barry Cunliffe, a specialist in the Iron Age, believed that hillforts from this period were defensive settlements.Cunliffe 2005. p. 347. Nonetheless, various archaeologists have called into question the defensive capacity of many hillforts. Using the case study of the Scratchbury hillfort in Wiltshire, Bowden and McOmish noted that \\"The positioning of [the fort] suggests that it was not built for defence\\" because \\"a potential assailant is enabled to observe all the dispositions of the defence\\", thereby leaving it particularly vulnerable to attackers.Bowden and McOmish 1989. p. 13. On a similar note, archaeologists Sue Hamilton and John Manley, after investigating the forts in south-east England, noted that for this region, \\"It is noteworthy that most of the hillforts are univallate, and lack the in-depth perimeter elaboration which elsewhere has been ascribed a defensive role.\\"Hamilton and Manley 2001. p. 34. Niall Sharples, after accepting that many British hillforts were not particularly defensible, theorised that Iron Age warfare in Britain, like much warfare around the world, did not consist purely of physical violence, but instead might have primarily \\"...involved ritualised display and threatening behaviour. I believe that the bulk of the evidence for warfare in the archaeological record [which included hillforts] is created as a deterrent, or to symbolise the nature of the conflict rather than actually the physical act.\\"Sharples 1991. p. 88. In this manner, hillforts would have in many respects been symbolically defensive rather than practically so, in a period when warfare was primarily about being threatening to your enemies rather than entering into open conflict with them. Ceremonial and ritual usage Mark Bowden and Dave McOmish, writing in 1989, noted that \\"The idea that some hillforts performed ceremonial functions is not a new one but discussion has concentrated on the possible existence of shrines and temples within the defences.\\" Instead, they proposed that \\"The morphology and topography of the ramparts themselves may indicate ceremonial activity\\". Sue Hamilton and John Manley noted that archaeologists must keep in mind a phenomenological view of hillforts within their landscapes, noting that \\"Hillforts provide a defined location from which to view the 'world' ... Such an experience of changing visual perspectives is largely lost in academic publication, yet it must have been a preeminent aspect of how hillfort builders and users described and understood hillforts.\\" =Southern Britain in the Romano-British Iron Age= In the 1st century, southern Britain was conquered and absorbed into the Roman Empire, leading to the creation of a hybrid Romano-British culture within what is now known as Roman Britain. It appears as though settlement ceased at many hill forts in Roman Britain. For instance, excavators working at the Dinas Powys hillfort in the Vale of Glamorgan, southern Wales, noted that although artefacts that were clearly Romano-British in nature were found at the site, they were not found in sufficient quantities to imply settlement, and that there was also no evidence of any construction going on during the first four centuries of the Common Era. They concluded therefore that under Roman rule, Dinas Powys had been effectively abandoned.Alcock 1963 p. 22-25. In the extreme southwest, however, enclosed settlements, albeit on a much smaller scale, continued to be constructed such as at Chysauster or the 'Rounds' found in Cornwall--presumably reflecting a lesser degree of Roman influence, which continued through into Sub-Roman Britain. =Northern Britain= The Roman Empire never occupied northern Britain (which at this time was largely the geographical equivalent to the later nation-state of Scotland), and as such a native British Iron Age culture was able to continue here with less imperial interference. This had some bearing on the nature of hill forts in this period. Archaeologist Leslie Alcock noted that a fort-building hiatus in the early centuries [CE] was followed by a new wave of construction--beginning in the third century, gathering momentum in the fifth, and perhaps extending through to the eighth. Also, out of all northern forts with radiometric dates, about half were either earlier forts that had been refurbished in the later period, or were newly constructed on virgin sites in the later period.Alcock 2003 p. 179-180. Early Medieval hillforts Dunadd hill fort near Kilmartin in Argyll, similar to ring-forts in Ireland and Iberian castros. In the Early Medieval period, which began in the fifth century CE, much of southern Britain (comprising much of the area that later became the nation-state of England), adopted a variant of Germanic culture from continental Europe, likely due to migration from that region. These Germanic peoples, the Anglo-Saxons, typically did not build or re-use hillforts. However, in Northern and Western Britain, areas that retained a cultural link to the earlier Iron Age, hillfort use continued. After looking at the difference between Iron Age and Early Medieval hill forts, archaeologist Leslie Alcock thought it reasonable to infer that Political and social conditions that demanded the massive pre-Roman Iron Age hillforts--and had the labour to build them--no longer existed in [the fifth and sixth centuries CE]. This implies a remarkable change in social organization.Alcock 1963 p. 66. =Western Britain= In Wales and the West Country, Iron Age British culture continued, largely free from the adoption of Anglo-Saxon culture. For instance, the Dinas Powys hillfort in South Wales saw resettlement in the fifth century, as did South Cadbury Hillfort which has revealed significant evidence for the construction of a Sub-Roman 'Great Hall' within the enclosure, having long been associated with the mythical Camelot. In other cases, defensive positions were also reoccupied, for instance, on the defensive peninsula of Tintagel in Cornwall, a promontory fort known as Tintagel Castle was built in the Early Medieval period, with archaeologists believing that it acted as a \\"stronghold for the post-Roman kings of Dumnonia.\\"Thomas 1993. p. 87. Several similar promontory forts of Cornwall, as well as in neighbouring Brittany, show signs of occupation from this period and are often associated with so-called 'Celtic Christian' hermitages and/or chapels such as at Rame Head, St Ives, St Michael's Mount, Mont Saint-Michel, Burgh Island and Looe Island recently excavated by Channel 4's archaeological television programme Time Team. A later example can be found at Castell Dinas Br√¢n, where a hillfort of c.600 BCE was the location for a stone castle built in the 13th century CE.King 1974 pp.113-132. =Northern Britain= Kite aerial photo of Peace Knowe Hillfort Northern Britain had never been conquered by the Roman Empire, and so the Iron Age proceeded directly into the Early Medieval without imperialist intervention. According to archaeologist Leslie Alcock, \\"warfare\\" was perhaps the \\"principal social activity in Early Historic northern Britain\\", playing a major part in \\"contemporary prose and poetry\\", and for this reason many hill forts of this period have been commonly thought of as defensive structures designed to repel attack.Alcock 2003 p. 205. Hill forts occupied in the Early Medieval period appear to have primarily been settlements for the social elite, the ruling classes who governed society. The northern British peoples who constructed hill forts knew of various forms of the monuments, leading Alcock to note that \\"the three Celtic peoples of northern Britain [Britons, Picts and Gaels] were fully aware of the potential of different types of fort, and used them variously, taking account only of local terrain, building materials, and politico-military needs.\\"Alcock 2003 p. 190.

It is part of the Amt (collective municipality) of Usedom-Nord. The community is known for the Peenem√ºnde Army Research Center, where the world's first functional large-scale liquid-propellant rocket, the V-2, was developed. Geography Peenem√ºnde railway station for service to Zinnowitz V-2 rocket The village with its seaport is located on the westernmost extremity of a long sand-spit, where the Peene empties into the Baltic Sea, in the northwestern part of Usedom Island. To the southeast it borders on the sea resort of Karlshagen. Peenem√ºnde harbour can be reached by ferry boat across the Peene from Kr√∂slin, liners also run along the Baltic coast to R√ºgen Island. The local railway station is the northern terminus of the Usedomer B√§derbahn line to Zinnowitz. Air service for the village is available at the Peenem√ºnde Airfield. History During the 10th and 11th centuries, Peenem√ºnde was part of the region of Circipania, an area settled by the Circipanes, a West Slavic tribe constituent of the Lutici federation. Circipania was incorporated into the Billung March of the Holy Roman Empire in 936, but the Empire's influence in the region decayed by the end of that century after a successful Slavic uprising. During the late 12th century, in the aftermath of the Wendish Crusade, the region fell under the rule of the Duchy of Pomerania. After the Treaty of Kremmen in 1236, most of Circipania was transferred to the Margraviate of Brandenburg.Bucholz, Werner (1999). Pommern. Deutsche Geschichte im Osten Europas. Siedler, pp. 23ff. In World War II, the area was highly involved in the development and production of the V-2 rocket, until the production's relocation to Nordhausen. The village's docks were used for the ships which recovered V-2 wreckage from test launches over the Baltic Sea. German scientists such as Wernher von Braun, who worked at the V-2 facility, were known as \\"Peenem√ºnders\\". The entire island was captured by the Soviet Red Army on 5 May 1945. The gas plant for the production of liquid oxygen still lies in ruins at the entrance to Peenem√ºnde. The post-war port was a Soviet naval base until turned over to the armed forces of East Germany in 1952. The seaport facilities were used at first by the East German Seepolizei (sea police) after new facilities for police motorboats had been built. On 1 December 1956 the headquarters of the First Fleet of the East German People's Navy was established at Peenem√ºnde. The birthplace of modern rocket science is today displayed at the Peenem√ºnde Historical Technical Museum, a World War II museum on the European Route of Industrial Heritage opened in 1992 in the power station of the former Army Testing Site and the area of the World War II power station (now part of the village) ‚Äì exhibits include a V-1 and a V-2.

After his mother's death in 1800, Pavel and his elder brother Andrew were brought up at a private boarding school in Moscow. He started his career as an aide-de-camp to Mikhail Miloradovich and other notable commanders but, citing ill health, moved to the civil service in 1809. He married Maria, the only daughter of Georg Johann von Glasenapp, Vice-Roy of Siberia. She became known as \\"the Princess Termagant\\" for her dreadful character and haughty manners. As a senior member of the Governing Senate in the reign of Nicholas I, Prince Gagarin inspected several governorates and led a commission investigating the activities of Dostoyevsky and other members of the Petrashevsky Circle. Many years later, Gagarin was also responsible for investigating Dmitry Karakozov's attempt to assassinate Alexander II of Russia. After Alexander's accession to the throne, Gagarin was involved, together with Yakov Rostovtsev, in the activities of a secret committee that prepared the Emancipation Reform of 1861. Always keen to support the party of wealthy landowners, Gagarin was made Chairman of the Committee of Ministers in 1864. He was also in charge of the State Council during Count Bludov's final illness and for several months following his death.

Entered in the ecclesiastic career, he moved to Rome where he was appointed auditor (judge) of the Roman Rota.

He was consecrated bishop on 13 December 1584 by Cardinal Tolomeo Gallio. He made his formal entrance in Milan on 22 July 1585. During his tenure as archbishop many religious institutes opened their convents in the archdiocese, such as the Camaldoleses in 1590 and the Camillians in 1594. In 1594 he published the new edition of Ambrosian Missal which preparation was started under Charles Borromeo. Following the footsteps of Charles Borromeo, Visconti convened six diocesan synods, started the pastoral visit to all the diocese, erected new churches such as Santa Maria al Paradiso in Milan and the church of Montevecchia and established the hospital of Fatebenefratelli in Milan. Visconti found difficulties in his action as bishop, which cannot stand comparison with Charles Borromeo's one.

In 1959 he received the Royal Subsidy for Painting, which was followed by the City of Maastricht Prize (1962), another Royal Subsidy for Painting (1962) and a travel grant from the French government (1964). Smits travelled to Spain, Italy (regularly), France, Mexico, the United States and Indonesia to complete his studies. He specialised as painter, collagist, draftsman, designer and sculptor.Jacobs, P.M.J.E. Beeldend Nederland: biografisch handboek, Tilburg: P.M.J. Jacobs, 1993, p. 401 Among his works, non-figurative mixed media wall‚Äìpaintings, glass mosaics, and wooden and metal sculptures can be seen with the number three as a constant element. Three is an important number for Smits, as it disposes the amount of different media mixed on the art work (three media), the parts in which the composition is divided (tripartite composition), and the physicality of the support (triptych). The subject- matter of Smits‚Äô work explores the relationship between nature and culture. In this sense, he explored culture itself in a daily life context with the exhibition.Tot lering en vermaak (To education and enjoyment, Van Abbemuseum 1970) Smits attempted with Ad Snijders and Johan Lennarts to bring art closer to people and make it more understandable. Smits has worked as a lecturer at the Fine Arts Academy in Tilburg and has collaborated in environment projects. He has also been a member of the Brabantse Stichting voor Beeldende Kunst en Edelambacht and of the B.B.K. Amsterdam. Smits has displayed his work in the Barreira Galerry, Valencia, Spain and in the Loewy Galerie, Los Angeles, United States, in Arti en Amicitiae, Amsterdam and the Centre Cultureel, Toulousse, France (1986), in the Galerie Traject, Utrecht (1988), and in La Passarelle des Arts, Chambourcy, France (1999) and both the municipalities of Eindhoven and Amsterdam acquired work by him (Amsterdam possesses Z.W.

The History of Yonkers New York: Wilbur B. Ketchum, 1896 In 1999, it was purchased and renovated.  History  Spann House was built in 1897 for Isaac Osgood Carleton. Carleton operated an import/export business in New York City. Unlike its neighbors the Spann House had an all stone structure, a simple form and basic dormered gable roof, which seemed an Active Design departure at a time when wood construction was cheaper and more popular than stone.Bolton, Robert. The History of the Several Towns, Manors, and Patents of the County of Westchester. Philadelphia, J.P. Lippincott & Co., 1924. In 1931, the current owners of Spann House converted it to a multifamily residence. Many of the other single family residences were left in disrepair, as their owners died or moved. In the 1970s a rash of development surrounded Spann House with multi-story apartment buildings. Between 1970 and 1975 one development company alone built five apartment buildings within a mile of Spann House.Gdc-homes.com In 1999 Kathryn Spann. a New York City lawyer, purchased Spann house. By then, it was a dilapidated but functioning apartment building. She purchased it from the estate of Sanislav Kira, a carpenter who specialized in high-end church furniture.City of Yonkers Water board Spann maintained its multi-family designation to offset the enormous cost of purchasing and renovating the building.  Site  Spann House sits at the edge of the Old Croton Aqueduct Trail, which slopes down towards Warburton Avenue and the Hudson River. The house site is covered in lush vegetation that includes pine, maple, hostas and fern. Rocks jut out all over the site. The stone on the site is Yonkers Gneiss.Bisotopes.ess.sunysb.edu, Tin.er.usgs.gov/geology Warburton Avenue runs parallel to the Hudson River and is relatively level. this flatness is the reason for the street's early development and growth. New York Statesman, The future of Warburton Avenue, 1883. Spann house has a large porch on the parlor level, and large windows from all the rooms looking out on the east side to the aqueduct, on the north and south at the Lawn and hosta gardens respectively. Approaching from Warburton Avenue, stone steps take visitors past a 15 foot deep step in the slope at the front of the site approximately 5 feet above street level. This is the first garden and has always been the most manicured part of the site. Where there were probably local ornamental flowers, Spann now has vegetable gardens and ornamental plants. The next level on Spann House is the house level, the southern portion near the entrance is partially manicured and covered in hostas. On the north side there is a large lawn used to host garden parties and was probably hedged by rose bushes, as is evident in the remnant bushes that line the area. A big problem with rejuvenating the Spann House garden was the abundance of vines. As a result of years of neglect thick vines had taken over the lawn and manicured gardens. Truckloads were removed to return the grounds to their pristine state.  Form and materials  The Spann house buildings form an extruded rectangle plan, the only irregularities being the protrusion of bay windows to let in the views of the Hudson. The roof is a steeply pitched Gable, with Gable dormers on the north and south sides. In plan, Spann house is generally similar to its middle class Victorian counterparts. It has a porch that wraps around the south side to the front, a partially submerged lower level, a raised first level, two floors above that and an attic. The plan was converted first in the 1930s and at least once in the 1980s before its present configuration. What would have been the parlor floor during Spann House's incarnation as a single-family residence now contains a large, one-bedroom apartment, which housed Spann during renovation. Another large one-bedroom apartment occupies what would have been the living floor. The floor, where the family bedrooms would have been, was converted to a two-bedroom apartment and where there was a kitchen and servants quarters in the cellar, now there are two studio apartments and a work room. It is connected to the Warburton Avenue on the south west corner by a stone stair, and via a single car garage at the northernmost corner of the site. Spann researched the history of the Spann House and found images of it close to when it was built. The color used on the wood trim was an approximation based on the photos. She repointed the walls and rebuilt the wall and steps leading to the house from the street and up to the aqueduct. To restore the interiors she referenced images from comparable houses in the area. Spann gutted the house as the interiors had begun to wear, the last extensive renovation had been in the 1970s. At that time, Formica surfaces and a new boiler was added and the electrical system and most fixtures were replaced. Spann's renovation took over five years, due in equal parts to the availability of funds and the tedium of sourcing quality vintage or vintage style fixtures along with the complexity of maintaining at least 3 tenants at all times.

Scott was named Acting President upon Michael Sata's death in office on 28 October 2014. He was the first white president of Zambia and the first white president in mainland sub- Saharan Africa since F. W. de Klerk, South Africa's last apartheid-era president, left office in 1994. Family, early life, and education Guy Lindsay Scott was born on 1 June 1944 in the border city of Livingstone, the pre-1935 capital of what was then Northern Rhodesia (today Zambia). His father, Alec Scott, was a doctor who had emigrated to Northern Rhodesia from Glasgow, Scotland, UK in 1927 to work on Cecil Rhodes' railways, whilst his mother Grace, had emigrated from England in 1940. Scott is the brother of Alexander \\"Sandy\\" Scott, a noted scientist, who was awarded the Fisheries Society of the British Isles's Beverton Medal in 2014 for his contributions to fisheries science. During the 1950s, his father was a Member of Parliament for the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, representing Lusaka as an Independent. Scott's eventual participation in politics was largely inspired by his father, who had been an ally of Zambian nationalists and had even founded several newspapers that advocated for independence. Scott completed his primary and secondary education at Springvale School and Peterhouse Boys' School, respectively, both located in what was then Southern Rhodesia (today Zimbabwe). He continued his education in England, where he received his undergraduate degree in economics in 1965 from Trinity Hall, a constituent college of Cambridge University. Scott then returned home to join the government of newly independent Zambia, in which he was a planner within the Ministry of Finance. During this time he was also the deputy editor of a publication called The Business and Economy of East and Central Africa. In 1970, Scott established an agribusiness venture known as Walkover Estates, which focused on producing high-value crops such as irrigated wheat, strawberries, and a wide range of off-season vegetables. Strawberries produced by Walkover Estates were often featured in local Sainsbury's supermarkets. During this time, Scott was considered a model employer who spoke the local language and was known for his inclusive parties. Scott eventually returned to England to continue his education at the University of Sussex, where he studied cognitive sciences and artificial intelligence, receiving his Master's degree in 1983 and his doctorate in 1986. His doctoral thesis was entitled \\"Local and global interpretation of moving images\\". He went on to study robotics at Oxford University. Political career In 1990, Scott joined the Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) and was elected to be Chair of its Agriculture Committee during the first party convention. He was elected as Member of Parliament for Mpika Central on the MMD ticket in the National Assembly during the 1991 general election and was subsequently appointed as Minister of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries. He presided over a number of policy reforms and was responsible for managing the \\"drought of the century\\" in January and February 1992. There was no reserve maize in Zambia and none in southern Africa, so emergency arrangements had to be made to import it from overseas and move it into Zambia on dilapidated rail and road networks. He also oversaw the drought recovery \\"bumper harvest\\" of 1992‚Äì93. However, he was sacked by President Chiluba on 15 April 1993.Jacqueline Audrey Kalley, Elna Schoeman & Lydia Eve Andor (1999) Southern African Political History: A Chronology of Key Political Events from Independence to Mid-1997 Greenwood Publishing Group, p703 In 1996, Scott resigned from the MMD to form the Lima Party together with Ben Kapita, the president of the ZNFU. He piloted the merger between the Lima Party and other parties including Dean Mungomba's Zambia Democratic Congress to form the Zambia Alliance for Progress. In 2001, he returned to politics and joined the Patriotic Front, returning to the National Assembly after being elected MP for Lusaka Central in the 2006 general election. =Vice-President= Guy Scott attending the United States‚ÄìAfrica Leaders Summit. A presidential election was held on 20 September 2011, and final results released on 23 September 2011 showed the Patriotic Front's presidential candidate, Michael Sata, winning over MMD's Rupiah Banda by a large margin. Scott was sworn in as Vice-President of the Republic of Zambia on 29 September 2011, the first white Zambian leader since its independence. Shortly after his election, The Guardian quoted Scott as saying: \\"I have long suspected Zambia is moving from a post-colonial to a cosmopolitan condition. People's minds are changing: they are no longer sitting back and dwelling on what was wrong about colonialism\\".Zambia's white vice-president hails 'cosmopolitan' new era, The Guardian, 4 October 2011 Referring to a 2012 meeting with former US President George W. Bush (who sponsors various charity initiatives in Zambia), he said, \\"when they introduced me as Vice President, he thought they were kidding\\". =Acting President= After Michael Sata's death on 28 October 2014, Scott became acting president for an interim period of no more than 90 days until a new election could be held to permanently fill the office, as required by Article 38 of the Constitution of Zambia.Zambia's Guy Scott makes history as white president in sub-Saharan Africa, Faith Karimi, CNN, 29 October 2014. Since the parentage clause of Article 34 of the Constitution of Zambia requires that both parents of presidential candidates are \\"Zambian by birth or descent,\\" Scott was considered ineligible to stand for the office in the January 2015 election. That provision had been put in place by President Frederick Chiluba to prevent Kenneth Kaunda ‚Äì whose father was born in what became Malawi ‚Äì from becoming president. However, a previous judgement by the Zambian Supreme Court, in a similar case in 1998, could have validated him as a potential candidate. Nevertheless, Scott did not stand as the presidential candidate for his political party, the Patriotic Front. On 3 November 2014, Scott dismissed Edgar Lungu as Secretary General of the Patriotic Front; however, he reinstated him a day later,Zambian President Guy Scott in row over Edgar Lungu sacking, BBC News, 4 November 2014. after street protests in Lusaka. On 17 December 2014, Scott rejected calls from cabinet members asking him to resign as acting president.

For the younger, see Abraham Hartwell Life Hartwell was born in 1542 or 1543. He was educated at Eton College and admitted scholar at King's College, Cambridge, on 25 August 1559, becoming a fellow on 26 August 1562. He graduated B.A. in 1563, M.A. in 1567, and resigned his fellowship in 1567. When Richard Shacklock published a translation of a letter written by the Portuguese bishop, Jer√≥nimo Os√≥rio da Fonseca, urging Queen Elizabeth to return to Catholicism, Hartwell, a Protestant, responded with an English translation of Walter Haddon's Latin riposte to Osorio. Describing himself as \\"an Englishe man borne, one of the quenes majesties suppliauntes, and enfourmed in my countrie fashions\\", Hartwell accused the exiled Shacklock of \\"grosse ignorance of our English customes\\".

Historical information Three Bronze Discs was created for the then new Golda Meir Library at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. It is set in a sunken brick courtyard outside the library. The building's architectural plan called for a sculpture, planter, and benches in the courtyard. Wines designed and molded Three Bronze Discs in plaster and the work was cast in bronze in Rome.

The Kenwood Library (now Mellencamp Hall) continued to serve the school for a time, but as the growth of the university accelerated, it became apparent the Kenwood Library would be too small for the anticipated number of holdings. Construction began in 1967 on the first stage of a modular library building planned to provide for future growth. After additions in 1974 and 1987, the original size of the library doubled. Artist A native of Chicago, James Wines grew up admiring the architecture of Louis Sullivan and Frank Lloyd Wright. After receiving his fine arts degree from the University of Syracuse in 1956, Wines began competing for commissions which blended architecture and sculpture. Three Bronze Discs is one of his earliest commissions.

It is located in Belgrade and is operated by the Astronomical Society Ruƒëer Bo≈°koviƒá. Before 1967 it was known as the \\"Turkish bath in Lower Town\\".  Location  The planetarium is located in the Lower Town of the Belgrade Fortress. It is situated on the plateau below the Danube slope of the hill, in the immediate vicinity of the remains of the medieval Lower town's Eastern Gate complex.  History  The edifice was originally built as the Turkish bath (hamam). It was constructed between 1860 and 1867, when Ottomans left the fortress, though the exact date is unknown. During the World War I it was used as the military bath. The building was almost demolished as the result of the 1944 explosion in the nearby Eastern Gate of the fortress. After the city Institute for the protection of the cultural monuments was founded, the Institute initiated the reconstruction of the hamam in 1962, citing the building's \\"undisputed monumental properties\\". The reconstruction was finished in 1964 and the venue remained unused until 1967. The original idea was for the facility to be adapted into the lapidarium. It was to become an exhibition space for the stone objects ‚Äì monuments, epitaphs, sarcophagi, statues, etc. The plan was scrapped at one point and it was decided to turn it into the planetarium. In order for the building to function as the planetarium, in the halovat, a central section of the hamam, an independent circular structure was constructed. It hosts the projector and the vault of the dome is used as the screen. The planetarium of the Astronomical Society Ruƒëer Bo≈°koviƒá was installed in 1967‚Äì1968. The planetarium's instrument, little Zeiss's planetarium ZKP-2 (Zeiss Kleines Planetarium-2), was purchased at the Belgrade Fair of technology in 1966 thanks to Josip Broz Tito, after an initiative of the members of the Society. Unofficially, it started working in 1969, and officially in the 1970. The planetarium's hall has a diameter of and 80 seats. The 1960s drawings of the panorama of Belgrade are preserved. During the festivities which marked the 50 years of the planetarium in 2019, the facility was renewed with the new projector which would allow the video wall projections. Also the planetarium was partially renovated as the lead roof panels deteriorated in time. Though on of the most modern planetariums in the Southeast Europe at the time, by 2019 it became and \\"oldtimer\\" among such facilities.  Characteristics  At the entrance into the planetarium is the sculpture titled \\"The man at the end of the second millennium\\". It is work of sculptor Zoran Kuzmanoviƒá. In 2019, it was estimated that over half a million visitors came to the planetarium in the 50 years since it was open. The venue occasionally hosts artistic and cultural gathering, unrelated to the astronomy. The main visitors to the planetarium are students of Belgrade primary and high schools. Following periodic activities of the Society are taking place in the Planetarium: * Astronomy courses for beginners (spring and autumn; in spring of 2007, the eightieth course was held) * Belgrade Astronomical weekend * Summer astronomy meetings  References   External links  * ASRB: Planetarium Planetaria Kalemegdan Planetarium ","title":"Belgrade Planetarium"},{"id":"30128437","text":"Shahid Kolahdooz Metro StationShahid Kolahdooz station page is the eastern end of Tehran Metro Line 4.

Jan Martens studied at the Academy of Visual Arts (The Hague, 1954‚Äì1959) under the direction of Kees Bol, among others, and at the Jan van Eyck Academy (Maastricht 1961‚Äì1966). In the time between the two schooling periods, he made his living as a graphic designer and silkscreen printer. The second degree developed his fine arts skills, and he specialized in painting and sculpture.Jacobs, P.M.J.E.

Marten‚Äôs first artistic period was marked by Abstract Expressionism and Pop Art, producing ‚ÄúMechanical Landscapes‚Äù, but also works inspired by Classical culture, such as \\"Il Ritorno d‚Äô√ölise\\". Even at that time, his painting demonstrated his characteristically baroque use of colors, in combination with transparent layers. A second is deemed by some more mature.

He was a wicket-keeper who also played as a lower-order batsman. He did not pass 50 runs in any first-class innings during his career. Early life Welman was born 19 February 1849 at Norton Manor in Norton Fitzwarren, just outside Taunton, the son of Charles Noel Welman, a Justice of the peace for Somerset. He was educated at Oxford University, but was not rated as good enough to feature in the university's cricket side. His first noted cricket appearance was for 'Surrey Club' against Uppingham School, a two-day match played at The Oval in London. During the 1870s, he appeared for both the Gentlemen of Devon, and the Gentlemen of Somerset a few times each year. When the two sides faced he each other, he appeared for the Somerset side. His first-class debut came in 1874, when he appeared for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against Cambridge University. In a nine wicket loss for the MCC, he was dismissed for a duck in the first innings, and three runs in the second. He did not play another first-class match for almost five years, when he faced Oxford University for the MCC, during which he once again was dismissed without scoring in the first innings. First-class regular In 1880, Welman began playing significantly more first-class cricket; in addition to a match for the MCC, he also played on three occasions for Middlesex County Cricket Club, and was selected for the 'Gentlemen of England' to face Oxford University. He played five or more first-class matches in each of the seasons from 1880 until 1888, with the exception of 1881 when he made only one first- class appearance. His best seasons with the bat were in 1882 and 1883, in each of which he passed 100 runs in total, though on both occasions his average remained under 20. He enjoyed greatest success as a wicket-keeper slightly later, the majority of his catches and stumpings coming between 1884 and 1887. His final first-class game was in 1901, for Somerset against the touring South Africans. He continued to play second-class cricket for the MCC until 1905, appearing when the London club toured in the South West of England. Personal life There is no record of Welman being paid to work, an indication that he was likely quite wealthy. He married May, 11 years his junior, sometime between the 1881 and 1901 censuses. He died in South Ascot, Berkshire, on 30 December 1931, aged 82.

The inability of affirmative premises to reach a negative conclusion is usually cited as one of the basic rules of constructing a valid categorical syllogism. Statements in syllogisms can be identified as the following forms: * a: All A is B. (affirmative) * e: No A is B. (negative) * i: Some A is B. (affirmative) * o: Some A is not B. (negative) The rule states that a syllogism in which both premises are of form a or i (affirmative) cannot reach a conclusion of form e or o (negative). Exactly one of the premises must be negative to construct a valid syllogism with a negative conclusion. (A syllogism with two negative premises commits the related fallacy of exclusive premises.) Example (invalid aae form): :Premise: All colonels are officers. :Premise: All officers are soldiers. :Conclusion: Therefore, no colonels are soldiers. The aao-4 form is perhaps more subtle as it follows many of the rules governing valid syllogisms, except it reaches a negative conclusion from affirmative premises. Invalid aao-4 form: :All A is B. :All B is C. :Therefore, some C is not A. This is valid only if A is a proper subset of B and/or B is a proper subset of C. However, this argument reaches a faulty conclusion if A, B, and C are equivalent. In the case that A = B = C, the conclusion of the following simple aaa-1 syllogism would contradict the aao-4 argument above: :All B is A. :All C is B. :Therefore, all C is A.

As part of the implementation, Nakamoto also devised the first blockchain database. In the process, Nakamoto was the first to solve the double-spending problem for digital currency using a peer-to-peer network. Nakamoto was active in the development of bitcoin up until December 2010. Many people have claimed, or have been claimed, to be Satoshi Nakamoto.  Development of bitcoin  Nakamoto has stated that work on the writing of the code for bitcoin began in 2007. On 18 August 2008 he or a colleague registered the domain name bitcoin.org, and created a web site at that address. On 31 October 2008, he published a paper on the cryptography mailing list at metzdowd.com describing a digital cryptocurrency, titled \\"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\\". Satoshi Nakamoto message embedded in the coinbase of the first block On 9 January 2009, he released version 0.1 of the bitcoin software on Sourceforge, and launched the network by mining the genesis block of bitcoin (block number 0), which had a reward of 50 bitcoins. Embedded in the coinbase transaction of this block was the text: \\"\`The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks\`\\", referring to a headline in the UK newspaper The Times published on that date. This note has been interpreted as both a timestamp of the genesis date and a derisive comment on the instability caused by fractional-reserve banking. Nakamoto continued to collaborate with other developers on the bitcoin software until mid-2010, making all modifications to the source code himself. He then handed over control of the source code repository and network alert key to Gavin Andresen, transferred several related domains to various prominent members of the bitcoin community, and stopped his recognized involvement in the project. Except for test transactions, , Nakamoto's coins remain unspent since mid January 2009. At bitcoin's peak in December 2017, these were worth over US$19 billion, making Nakamoto possibly the 44th richest person in the world at the time.  Characteristics and identity  Nakamoto has not disclosed any personal information when discussing technical matters. He provided some commentary on banking and fractional-reserve banking. On his P2P Foundation profile as of 2012, Nakamoto claimed to be a 37-year-old male who lived in Japan, but some speculated he was unlikely to be Japanese due to his native-level use of English and his bitcoin software not being documented or labelled in Japanese. Some have considered that Nakamoto might be a team of people: Dan Kaminsky, a security researcher who read the bitcoin code, said that Nakamoto could either be a \\"team of people\\" or a \\"genius\\"; Laszlo Hanyecz, a developer who had emailed Nakamoto, had the feeling the code was too well designed for one person. Gavin Andresen has said of Nakamoto's code: \\"He was a brilliant coder, but it was quirky.\\" The use of British English in both source code comments and forum postings ‚Äì such as the expression \\"bloody hard\\", terms such as \\"flat\\" and \\"maths\\", and the spellings \\"grey\\" and \\"colour\\" ‚Äì led to speculation that Nakamoto, or at least one individual in the consortium claiming to be him, was of Commonwealth origin. The reference to London's The Times newspaper in the first bitcoin block mined by Nakamoto suggested to some a particular interest in the British government. Stefan Thomas, a Swiss coder and active community member, graphed the time stamps for each of Nakamoto's bitcoin forum posts (more than 500); the resulting chart showed a steep decline to almost no posts between the hours of 5 a.m. and 11 a.m. Greenwich Mean Time. This was between 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. Japanese time, suggesting an unusual sleep pattern for someone presumably living in Japan. As this pattern held true even on Saturdays and Sundays, it suggested that Nakamoto was asleep at this time.  Possible identities  There is still doubt about the real identity of Satoshi Nakamoto. Speculation about his true identity has focused on a number of cryptography and computer science experts, mostly of non-Japanese descent. = Hal Finney = Hal Finney (4 May 1956 ‚Äì 28 August 2014) was a pre-bitcoin cryptographic pioneer and the first person (other than Nakamoto himself) to use the software, file bug reports, and make improvements. He also lived a few blocks from a man named Dorian Nakamoto, according to Forbes journalist Andy Greenberg. Greenberg asked the writing analysis consultancy Juola & Associates to compare a sample of Finney's writing to Satoshi Nakamoto's, and they found that it was the closest resemblance they had yet come across (including the candidates suggested by Newsweek, Fast Company, The New Yorker, Ted Nelson and Skye Grey). Greenberg theorized that Finney may have been a ghostwriter on behalf of Nakamoto, or that he simply used his neighbor Dorian's identity as a \\"drop\\" or \\"patsy whose personal information is used to hide online exploits\\". However, after meeting Finney, seeing the emails between him and Nakamoto and his bitcoin wallet's history (including the very first bitcoin transaction from Nakamoto to him, which he forgot to pay back) and hearing his denial, Greenberg concluded that Finney was telling the truth. Juola & Associates also found that Nakamoto's emails to Finney more closely resemble Nakamoto's other writings than Finney's do. Finney's fellow extropian and sometimes co-blogger Robin Hanson assigned a subjective probability of \\"at least\\" 15% that \\"Hal was more involved than he's said\\", before further evidence suggested that was not the case. = Nick Szabo = In December 2013, a blogger named Skye Grey linked Nick Szabo to the bitcoin whitepaper using an approach he described as stylometric analysis. Szabo is a decentralized currency enthusiast and published a paper on \\"bit gold\\", which was one of the precursors of bitcoin. He is known to have been interested in using pseudonyms in the 1990s. In a May 2011 article, Szabo stated about the bitcoin creator: \\"Myself, Wei Dai, and Hal Finney were the only people I know of who liked the idea (or in Dai's case his related idea) enough to pursue it to any significant extent until Nakamoto (assuming Nakamoto is not really Finney or Dai).\\" Financial author Dominic Frisby provides much circumstantial evidence but, as he admits, no proof that Nakamoto is Szabo.Frisby, Dominic (2014) \\"Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?\\" In Bitcoin: the Future of Money?, pp. 85‚Äì149. Unbound. However, Szabo has denied being Nakamoto. In a July 2014 email to Frisby, he said: \\"Thanks for letting me know. I'm afraid you got it wrong doxing me as Satoshi, but I'm used to it.\\"Frisby p 147 Nathaniel Popper wrote in the New York Times that \\"the most convincing evidence pointed to a reclusive American man of Hungarian descent named Nick Szabo.\\" = Dorian Nakamoto = In a high-profile 6 March 2014 article in the magazine Newsweek, journalist Leah McGrath Goodman identified Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto, a Japanese American man living in California, whose birth name is Satoshi Nakamoto, as the Nakamoto in question. Besides his name, Goodman pointed to a number of facts that circumstantially suggested he was the bitcoin inventor. Trained as a physicist at Cal Poly University in Pomona, Nakamoto worked as a systems engineer on classified defense projects and computer engineer for technology and financial information services companies. Nakamoto was laid off twice in the early 1990s and turned libertarian, according to his daughter, and encouraged her to start her own business \\"not under the government's thumb.\\" In the article's seemingly biggest piece of evidence, Goodman wrote that when she asked him about bitcoin during a brief in-person interview, Nakamoto seemed to confirm his identity as the bitcoin founder by stating: \\"I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it. It's been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection.\\" The article's publication led to a flurry of media interest, including reporters camping out near Dorian Nakamoto's house and subtly chasing him by car when he drove to do an interview. However, during the subsequent full-length interview, Dorian Nakamoto denied all connection to bitcoin, saying he had never heard of the currency before, and that he had misinterpreted Goodman's question as being about his previous work for military contractors, much of which was classified. In a Reddit \\"ask-me-anything\\" interview, he claimed he had misinterpreted Goodman's question as being related to his work for Citibank. Later that day, the pseudonymous Nakamoto's P2P Foundation account posted its first message in five years, stating: \\"I am not Dorian Nakamoto.\\" In September, the account posted another message saying it had been hacked, raising questions over the earlier message's authenticity. = Craig Wright = On 8 December 2015, Wired wrote that Craig Steven Wright, an Australian academic, \\"either invented bitcoin or is a brilliant hoaxer who very badly wants us to believe he did\\". Craig Wright took down his Twitter account and neither he nor his ex-wife responded to press inquiries. The same day, Gizmodo published a story with evidence supposedly obtained by a hacker who broke into Wright's email accounts, claiming that Satoshi Nakamoto was a joint pseudonym for Craig Steven Wright and computer forensics analyst David Kleiman, who died in 2013. Wright's claim was supported by Jon Matonis (former director of the Bitcoin Foundation) and bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen as well as cryptographer Ian Grigg. A number of prominent bitcoin promoters remained unconvinced by the reports. Subsequent reports also raised the possibility that the evidence provided was an elaborate hoax, which Wired acknowledged \\"cast doubt\\" on their suggestion that Wright was Nakamoto. Bitcoin developer Peter Todd said that Wright's blog post, which appeared to contain cryptographic proof, actually contained nothing of the sort. Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik agreed that evidence publicly provided by Wright does not prove anything, and security researcher Dan Kaminsky concluded Wright's claim was \\"intentional scammery\\". In May 2019, Wright started using UK libel law to sue people who denied he was the inventor of bitcoin, and who called him a fraud. In 2019 Wright registered US copyright for the bitcoin white paper and the code for Bitcoin 0.1. Wright's team claimed this was \\"government agency recognition of Craig Wright as Satoshi Nakamoto\\"; the United States Copyright Office issued a press release clarifying that this was not the case. = Other claimed candidates = In a 2011 article in The New Yorker, Joshua Davis claimed to have narrowed down the identity of Nakamoto to a number of possible individuals, including the Finnish economic sociologist Dr. Vili Lehdonvirta and Irish student Michael Clear, who was in 2008 an undergraduate student in cryptography at Trinity College Dublin. Clear strongly denied he was Nakamoto, as did Lehdonvirta. In October 2011, writing for Fast Company, investigative journalist Adam Penenberg cited circumstantial evidence suggesting Neal King, Vladimir Oksman and Charles Bry could be Nakamoto. They jointly filed a patent application that contained the phrase \\"computationally impractical to reverse\\" in 2008, which was also used in the bitcoin white paper by Nakamoto. The domain name bitcoin.org was registered three days after the patent was filed. All three men denied being Nakamoto when contacted by Penenberg. In May 2013, Ted Nelson speculated that Nakamoto is really Japanese mathematician Shinichi Mochizuki. Later, an article was published in The Age newspaper that claimed that Mochizuki denied these speculations, but without attributing a source for the denial. A 2013 article in Vice listed Gavin Andresen, Jed McCaleb, or a government agency as possible candidates to be Nakamoto. In 2013, two Israeli mathematicians, Dorit Ron and Adi Shamir, published a paper claiming a link between Nakamoto and Ross Ulbricht. The two based their suspicion on an analysis of the network of bitcoin transactions, but later retracted their claim. In 2016, Financial Times said that Nakamoto might have been a group of people mentioning Hal Finney, Nick Szabo and Adam Back as potential members. In 2020, a YouTube channel called Barely Sociable claimed that Adam Back, inventor of bitcoin predecessor Hashcash, was Nakamoto. Back subsequently denied this. A 2017 article published by Sahil Gupta espoused the possibility of Elon Musk being the real Satoshi Nakamoto, based on Musk's technical expertise with financial software and history of publishing whitepapers. However, in a tweet dated 28 November 2017, Musk denied the claim. In 2019 journalist Evan Ratliff claimed drug dealer Paul Le Roux could be Nakamoto.

The present church, built to serve the Victorian suburb of Roffey‚Äîpart of the ancient market town of Horsham‚Äîreplaced a schoolroom in which religious services had been held since 1856. Arthur Blomfield's Early English-style church, built of locally quarried sandstone and funded by a widow as a memorial to her late husband, was completed in 1878 and was allocated a parish immediately. Roman Catholic services were also held in the building to serve Roffey's Catholic population, but these ceased in the early 21st century. English Heritage has listed the church at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance. History A settlement existed at Roffey by the 16th century, and the area was known for its early ironmaking industry. A manor called Roffey, part of the ancient and larger manor of Chesworth, was first described in the mid-15th century; its land covered an area northeast of the market town of Horsham. Horsham was linked to the national railway network in 1848, when a branch line was built from Three Bridges on the London‚ÄìBrighton Main Line. More lines were built to surrounding towns in the next 20 years, stimulating residential and commercial growth. The area around the village of Roffey, which had been common land until enclosure in 1812‚Äì13, began to develop in the 1820s after the road from Horsham to Crawley was turnpiked. Growth was focused on the old Star Inn, and the village had the alternative name Star Row until as late as 1874 (as well as variations on its original name‚Äîsuch as Roughey, Roughheath and Roughway‚Äî which was derived from the Old English Rogh hay meaning \\"deer enclosure\\"). The village was in the ecclesiastical parish of Horsham, whose parish church (St Mary's Church) was distant. The possibility of opening a church in Roffey was first discussed in about 1840. In 1856, an iron school was erected on Roffey Street, and this building almost immediately became the village's first church when it was licensed as a 90-capacity place of worship. Consideration was soon given to building a permanent church to serve the continuously growing population; and in 1870 Mrs A. Gertrude Martyn, widow of Cecil Martyn from nearby Roffey Lodge, donated money and land for the construction of a church in memory of her late husband. Gothic Revival architect Arthur Blomfield, who designed or restored several churches in Sussex, was commissioned to design the church. Building work began in 1878 and was finished within the year. Blomfield used locally quarried sandstone dressed with Bath stone. During construction, a swan crashed into the scaffolding around the tower while in flight, and fell dead on the ground. Coincidentally, the Martyn family crest featured a swan and a crown, so the incident was seen as auspicious‚Äîand the dead swan's feathers were removed and incorporated into the antependium of the altar when the church opened. Building work was complete by 1 November 1878 (All Saints Day), and the church was consecrated by the Bishop of Chichester Richard Durnford. Construction work had cost between ¬£4,000 and ¬£5,000. Roffey continued to thrive: in 1878, the suburb was described as \\"growing, populous, but very poor\\", and by the end of the 19th century a workhouse, working men's club, reading room, larger school and a parade of shops were all built. The workhouse site became a military camp and hospital in 1916, and later a psychiatric hospital. The 300-capacity church was allocated its own parish immediately after opening, and was well-used from the beginning‚Äîcongregations were typically around 125 in its early years, although some residents of distant parts of the parish worshipped in the nearby villages of Colgate or Rusper. In 1880, the churchyard was consecrated and a J. W. Walker & Sons manual organ was installed in the church. A Calvary‚Äîa wooden crucifix of teak and oak‚Äîwas erected in the churchyard in 1919 as Roffey's war memorial. The Bishop of Chichester Winfrid Burrows dedicated the sculpture on 4 October 1919. In 1971, it had to be rebuilt and rededicated after being knocked over and badly damaged during a tree-felling exercise. A new vicarage, replacing an earlier building which was too expensive to maintain, was opened in 1967. A parish hall had already been built in 1957. In 1972, All Saints Church began to hold regular Roman Catholic Masses, which continued until 2011 or later. Architecture font. All Saints Church is a small Early English Gothic Revival-style building with a \\"surprisingly large\\" tower. It is built of Horsham sandstone, laid as rubble in a snecked formation (courses of stonework with smaller stones, or snecks, inserted at frequent intervals). There is also Bath stone and some brickwork. The roof is laid with tiles, and the tower roof is shingled. The plan consists of a 3-bay nave with an aisle on the north side only, a chancel of a further two bays (and at a lower level), and a tower, vestry and porch‚Äîall grouped close to each other. The simple building was described as \\"hard and soulless\\" by Nikolaus Pevsner, although he noted that its interior was \\"impressively proportioned\\". The quadruple-trussed timber hammerbeam roof of the nave, held on carved stone corbels and supported by scissor braces (paired diagonal braces running between pairs of beams), displays Blomfield's characteristic careful regard for the timberwork in his churches. The west window consists of a pair of lancets below a quatrefoil, and elsewhere in the nave there are three-light lancets set into recessed arches and separated by buttresses. The vestry window is similar to the west window, and sits above an arched doorway. Seven more lancet windows are in the north aisle, and the chancel has a further three sets‚Äîincluding a three-light east window, which contains stained glass designed by the Clayton and Bell firm in 1878. Michael Charles Farrer Bell, later of the same firm, was responsible for the glass in the church's other windows. Scenes depicted include Christ in Majesty, the Four Gospels, the Apostles and various saints. The porch is timber-framed and has arch braces with elaborately carved spandrels. The adjacent tower rises in four parts to a shingled spire topped with a weather vane. The windows are variously arch-headed and lancet, and the uppermost stage has louvred arched openings. Interior fittings include a stone and marble-columned font of octagonal design, a stone and timber-panelled carved pulpit, oak choir stalls and Communion rails, timber confessional, a J. W. Walker and Sons organ and a stone, wood and marble reredos with carvings and mosaic work. Cecil Martyn, for whom the church was built as a memorial, is commemorated by a brass tablet on the north side. The church today All Saints Church was listed at Grade II by English Heritage on 11 November 2002; this defines it as a \\"nationally important\\" building of \\"special interest\\". As of February 2001, there were 1,628 Grade II listed buildings, and 1,726 listed buildings of all grades, in the district of Horsham. The parish covers the whole of Roffey and surrounding areas as far as the Rusper Road and Littlehaven railway station, part of the North Horsham housing estate, and surrounding rural areas towards the villages of Rusper, Colgate and Faygate. The legal name of the parish is \\"All Saints Roughey or Roffey\\", reflecting the variable spelling of the area's name. As well as regular Anglican services, All Saints Church served for many years as a Mass Centre for local Roman Catholics. It was served by priests from St John the Evangelist's Church in the centre of Horsham, and had services on Saturday evenings (a \\"Vigil Mass\\", or First Mass of Sunday) and on Holy Days of Obligation. This ceased at some point between 2011 and 2013.

The major axis, R, is measured from the center of the hole in the middle to the center of the cylindrical confinement area. The minor axis, r, is the radius of the cylinder. In a toroidal fusion power reactor, the magnetic fields confining the plasma are formed in a helical shape, winding around the interior of the reactor. The safety factor, labeled q or q(r), is the ratio of the times a particular magnetic field line travels around a toroidal confinement area's \\"long way\\" (toroidally) to the \\"short way\\" (poloidally). The term \\"safety\\" refers to the resulting stability of the plasma; plasmas that rotate around the torus poloidally about the same number of times as toroidally are inherently less susceptible to certain instabilities. The term is most commonly used when referring to tokamak devices. Although the same considerations apply in stellarators, by convention the inverse value is used, the rotational transform, or i. The concept was first developed by Martin David Kruskal and Vitaly Shafranov, who noticed that the plasma in pinch effect reactors would be stable if q was larger than 1. Macroscopically, this implies that the wavelength of the potential instability is longer than the reactor. This condition is known as the Kruskal-Shafranov limit. Background The key concept in magnetic confinement fusion is that ions and electrons in a plasma will rotate around magnetic lines of force. A simple way to confine a plasma would be to use a solenoid, a series of circular magnets mounted along a cylinder that generates uniform lines of force running down the long axis of the cylinder. A plasma generated in the center of the cylinder would be confined to run along the lines down the inside of the tube, keeping it away from the walls. However, it would be free to move along the axis and out the ends of the cylinder. One can close the ends by bending the solenoid around into a circle, forming a torus (a ring or donut). In this case, the particles will still be confined to the middle of the cylinder, and even if they move along it they would never exit the ends - they would circle the apparatus endlessly. However, Fermi noted a problem with this arrangement; consider a series of circular magnets with the toroidal confinement area threaded through their centers, the magnets will be closer together on the inside of the ring, with a stronger field. Particles in such a system will drift up or down across the torus.For a general discussion of forces in a toroidal confinement system, see Freidberg, Chapter 11. The solution to this problem is to add a secondary magnetic field at right angles to the first. The two magnetic fields will mix to produce a new combined field that is helical, like the stripes on a barber pole. A particle orbiting such a field line will find itself near the outside of the confinement area at some times, and near the inside at others. Although a test particle would always be drifting up (or down) compared to the field, since the field is rotating, that drift will, compared to the confinement chamber, be up or down, in or out, depending on its location along the cylinder. The net effect of the drift over a period of several orbits along the long axis of the reactor nearly adds up to zero.Freidberg, pg. 284 Rotational transform The effect of the helical field is to bend the path of a particle so it describes a loop around the cross section of the containment cylinder. At any given point in its orbit around the long axis of the toroid, the particle will be moving at an angle, Œ∏. In the simple case, when the particle has completed one orbit of the reactor's major axis and returned to its original location, the fields will have made it complete one orbit of the minor axis as well. In this case the rotational transform is 1. In the more typical case, the fields do not \\"line up\\" this way, and the particle will not return to exactly the same location. In this case the rotational transform is calculated thus: i = 2 pi cdot frac{R cdot B_p}{r cdot B_t} where R is the major radius, r the minor radius, B_p the poloidal field strength, and B_t the toroidal field. As the fields typically vary with their location within the cylinder, i varies with location on the minor radius, and is expressed i(r). Safety factor In the case of an axisymmetric system, which was common in earlier fusion devices, it is more common to use the safety factor, which is simply the inverse of the rotational transform: q = frac{2pi}{i} = frac{r cdot B_t}{R cdot B_p} The safety factor is essentially a measure of the \\"windiness\\" of the magnetic fields in a reactor. If the lines are not closed, the safety factor can be expressed as the pitch of the field: q = frac{dphi}{dtheta} As the fields vary across the minor axis, q also varies and is often expressed as q(r). On the inside of the cylinder on a typical tokamak it converges on 1, while at the outside it is nearer 6 to 8. Kruskal-Shafranov limit Toroidal arrangements are a major class of magnetic fusion energy reactor designs. These are subject to a number of inherent instabilities that cause the plasma to exit the confinement area and hit the walls of the reactor on the order of milliseconds, far too rapidly to be used for energy generation. Among these is the kink instability, which is caused by small variations in the plasma shape. Areas where the plasma is slightly further from the centerline will experience a force outwards, causing a growing bulge that will eventually reach the reactor wall. These instabilities have a natural pattern based on the rotational transform. This leads to a characteristic wavelength of the kinks, which is based on the ratio of the two magnetic fields that mix to form the twisted field in the plasma. If that wavelength is longer than the long radius of the reactor, then they cannot form. That is, if the length along the major radius L_s is: L_s = frac{2 pi r B_phi}{B_theta} > 2 pi R Then the plasma would be stable to this major class of instabilities. Basic mathematical rearrangement, removing the 2 pi from both sides and moving the major radius R to the other side of the equality produces: q = frac{r B_phi}{R B_theta} > 1 Which produces the simple rule of thumb that as long as the safety factor is greater than one at all points in the plasma, it will be naturally stable to this major class of instabilities. This principle led Soviet researchers to run their toroidal pinch machines with reduced current, leading to the stabilization that provided much higher performance in their T-3 machine in the late 1960s. In more modern machines, the plasma is pressed to the outside section of the chamber, producing a cross sectional shape like a D instead of a circle, which reduces the area with lower safety factor and allows higher currents to be driven through the plasma.

It is located just south of the Balkan Mountains and is administratively part of Kazanlak Municipality, Stara Zagora Province. Kran was an important castle of the Second Bulgarian Empire in the 13th‚Äì14th century. Among the local sights are a conserved ancient Thracian tomb, a much older Thracian sanctuary and the ruins of the medieval fortress. Geography Kran lies some north of the city of Kazanlak. It is situated in direct vicinity of the Shipka Pass, a major pass through the Central Balkan Mountains. The mountains stand just to the north of the town. Among the amenities that the town offers are a motel and a camping site. As of 2010, Kran was the most populous village in Stara Zagora Province. Due to the village's population, the mayor Temenuzhka Lyutskanova formally suggested that it be proclaimed a town. In October 2011, Kran was formally declared a town by a decision of the Council of Ministers. The industry of the town is represented by the spring factory Zavod za pruzhini AD, founded in 1974 as part of the Kazanlak-based Arsenal AD firearms manufacturing company. Since 1999, the factory has been a separate joint-stock company. History Kran is located in the so-called Valley of the Thracian Kings, a region of Bulgaria known for the abundance of Thracian sites and artifacts. In 1995, a team of archaeologists headed by Georgi Kitov unearthed a Thracian tomb under Sarafova Mogila, a mound near the town. The tomb is known as Kran II and was built in the 4th century BC. The tomb is notable for the earliest known example of painted friezes in Thracian architecture. It is also among the earliest to make use of bricks and mortar as construction materials. The conservation of the Kran II tomb was completed in 2009 and the site was opened to the public. A Thracian sanctuary was discovered by archaeologists near the town in 2009. The sanctuary dates to 2200‚Äì1900 BC and also includes nine burials of infants. Kran is first mentioned under its modern name during the High Middle Ages. In 1190, the surviving Byzantine troops of a failed anti-Bulgarian campaign retreated to Kran en route to Beroia (today Stara Zagora). = Despotate of Kran = In the late 13th century, the fortress of Kran emerged as the capital of the Kran Despotate, an appanage of the Second Bulgarian Empire under the rule of despot Aldimir, younger brother of the Bulgarian Emperor George Terter I (r. 1280‚Äì1292). Aldimir may have already been in charge of the fortress in the 1280s and early 1290s, and he was certainly the lord of Kran from 1298 to 1305, under the regent queen Smiltsena and his own nephew Theodore Svetoslav (r. 1300‚Äì1322). In that year, the despotate was annexed by Theodore Svetoslav and direct rule from Tarnovo was restored. At the height of Aldimir's reign as despot of Kran, the fortress was the capital of a domain which extended from Yambol and Karnobat in the east to Kazanlak or Karlovo in the west. The despotate appears to have been restored at some point thereafter, however, as the father of Bulgarian Emperor Ivan Alexander (r. 1331‚Äì1371), Sratsimir, is mentioned as the despot of Kran before and during the rule of his son. The ruins of the medieval castle are located on the rocks north of the town. The fortress is a descendant of an earlier Byzantine settlement and a fortification from the 7th‚Äì8th century. The castle's natural position atop a cliff facilitated its defence, though it was also supported by thick walls and several defensive towers. = Formation of a modern settlement = The modern settlement was perhaps founded in the 1370s or 1380s, after the castle was captured and destroyed by the Ottomans. In Ottoman times, it was known as Hasat (–•–∞—Å—ä—Ç, \\"The Has\\", a kind of Ottoman estate). The name was changed back to the medieval Bulgarian appellation in 1906.

He was optioned back to the minors after the game. On May 31, Cobb was recalled back to the majors. On June 7, Cobb earned his first major league victory while starting for the Rays. Cobb pitched for 6 innings and the Rays defeated the Angels 4‚Äì1. In late July, Cobb began to experience numbness and swelling in his right arm. After an August 5 start, he required surgery to repair a blood clot in his chest and remove one of his ribs, which had caused the blood clot. The two surgeries ended his 2011 season. 2012 season Cobb was invited to spring training in 2012, but sent to minor league camp to begin the season. Cobb was called up to fill in for Jeff Niemann while Niemann was injured. On August 23, 2012, Cobb pitched his first career complete game shutout against the Oakland Athletics. He did not lose in his first seven starts, and ended the season with a 3-2 record and a 3.42 ERA in nine games started at the major league level. 2013 season Cobb being lifted onto a stretcher after being struck by a line drive, June 15, 2013. On May 10, 2013, Cobb struck out four batters in a single inning. He also gave up one run in that inning after the batter stole second base, third base, and was then balked home for the first time in recorded baseball. Cobb was struck in the head by a line drive off the bat of Kansas City Royals first baseman Eric Hosmer on June 15, 2013. Cobb left the field on a stretcher, and was transported to Bayfront Medical Center in St. Petersburg, Florida. It was reported that Cobb suffered a mild concussion and had a cut on his right ear, while all other scans and tests came back normal, and he would be released the next day. Cobb would miss two months, making his return on August 15. In 22 starts of 2013, Cobb finished the year 11-3 with a 2.76 ERA. 2014 season One year later, Cobb endorsed a product designed to help protect young ball players from similar injuries: the isoBLOX padded cap insert. The insert, a skull cap which fits underneath adjustable or stretch caps, is based on the same technology Major League Baseball approved for on-field use in January 2014. \\"If boys and girls start wearing protective inserts, it will become second nature for them when they‚Äôre older,\\" Cobb said. \\"I want to be a part of the evolution toward introducing this successfully at the big league level and I think the best way to do it is by starting at youth ages,\\" he said. \\"My optimism is through the roof. The biggest thing is to further the process for technology to catch up, where we can wear it without altering mechanics or comfort‚Äîthis is the best step.\\" In 2014, Cobb went 10-9 with a 2.87 ERA in 27 starts. 2015 season To begin the 2015 season, Cobb was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to right forearm tendinitis. On May 5, 2015, it was revealed that his elbow was diagnosed with a partial tear of the UCL. Three days later, it was announced that he would undergo Tommy John surgery, therefore ending his 2015 season. 2016 season Cobb began the 2016 season on the 60-day disabled list. He returned to the Rays rotation towards the end of the season but was not very effective. In five starts, Cobb posted an 8.59 ERA.  2017 season  Since Cobb returned from Tommy John surgery, he completely changed the usage of his pitches. Due to the health of his arm and his rehabilitation program, Cobb is not allowed to throw his split-finger fastball, his most dominant and often used pitch. Cobb went back to using his four-seam fastball and an improved, and more commonly used, curveball. Due to the success of Cobb's first 10 starts of the 2017 season (3.82 ERA) and his impending free- agency, the Rays were reported to be shopping the starter if they were to fall out of the playoff race or if they felt they had the depth to lose Cobb. After the injury to Matt Andriese and the poor play of Blake Snell coupled with Cobb's flashes of high potential, the Rays stated that they were not actively shopping Cobb, instead planning on utilizing him as a key piece for the regular season and playoffs. After a poor May and early June, Cobb showed signs of brilliance, constantly pitching late into games, getting weak contact, and consistently keeping his pitch count down. Between June 9 and July 26, Cobb recorded 9 quality starts in 10 games, pitching 7 or more innings in 6 of those games. In that stretch, he went 5-1 and lowered his era from 4.52 to 3.46, even flirting with a no-hitter through 7 innings against the Pirates. After a strong year from Cobb, he was named the winner of Paul C. Smith champion award, which goes to the Rays player who best exemplifies the spirit of true professionalism on and off the field. Cobb ended the season 12-10 with a 3.66 ERA in a 177 innings. =Baltimore Orioles= On March 20, 2018, Cobb agreed to a 4-year deal worth $57 million with the Baltimore Orioles. The deal was finalized on March 21.  2018 season  On September 23, he aggravated a blister, keeping him out for the remainder of the season. He finished the first season of his 4 year contract with a 5-15 record in 28 starts, striking out 102 batters and a 4.90 ERA. He struck out 102 batters in innings.  2019 season  On March 13, 2019, the team announced that Cobb would be the team's Opening Day starter.http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/26248649/orioles-name-cobb-start- opening-day A week later, he was placed on the 10 day disabled list to start the season. He was placed on the disabled list for a third time on April 28 with a lumbar strain. At the time of the injury, Cobb had allowed 9 home runs in innings. He was transferred to the 60-day disabled list on May 22. On June 11, it was revealed Cobb needed to undergo hip surgery, and he was ruled out for the rest of the season. In 2019, balls hit against him had the highest average exit velocity (94.9 mph) of those hit against all major league pitchers, and he gave up the highest percentage of hard-hit balls in MLB (60.0%). For the season, he was 0-2 with a 10.95 ERA.  2020 season  In 2020 for the Orioles, Cobb pitched to a 2-5 record with a 4.30 ERA and 38 strikeouts over 52.1 innings pitched in 10 games.https://www.mlb.com/player/shawn-armstrong-542888 =Pitching style= Cobb throws four pitches: a four-seam fastball and sinker averaging about 93 mph, a knuckle curve in the low 80s, and a splitter in the high 80s. More than half of his pitches with 2 strikes are splitters. He tends to throw more four- seamers and splitters to right-handed hitters, but batters from both sides of the plate see a fair amount of all of his pitches. Personal life Cobb proposed to his girlfriend, Kelly Reynolds, in February 2014 at the Discovery Cove in Orlando. Cobb's brother, R. J., is a United States Army captain who served in the Iraq War and earned a Purple Heart. R. J. is four years older than Alex. Their mother, a nurse practitioner, died in December 2005 as the result of two strokes.

It is located south of Peoplestown and Grant Park, west of Boulevard Heights and Benteen Park, northwest of Thomasville Heights and the Atlanta federal penitentiary, and northeast of South Atlanta and Lakewood Heights. It is situated directly on the path of the Atlanta Beltline, which has begun to acquire and develop properties along the rail lines in the Chosewood corridor, including the Boulevard Crossing Park. The neighborhood is composed of craftsman-style bungalows, many of which were built in the early 1900s. Many of the newly constructed homes in the neighborhood also reflect this craftsman theme while adding modern amenities. Chosewood Park is named for the six-acre park located near the center of the neighborhood. The park offers tennis courts, basketball courts, a baseball field, a children's playground and a small grilling area. Portions of the neighborhood are perched atop a gently sloping hill that provides an unobstructed view of the downtown Atlanta skyline from the neighborhood's north side. In 2010 the park was enlarged to include approximately six additional acres to the southeast of the original park. The additional acres contains mostly deep woods with nature trails. The Park is designated a Certified Wildlife Habitat by National Wildlife Federation. History Mural in Chosewood Park. Chosewood Park was primarily work force housing for the United States Penitentiary, Atlanta, established in 1902. Between 1927 and 1990, the workers at the Lakewood Assembly plant operated by General Motors populated the neighborhood. In the late 2000s, Chosewood Park neighborhood experienced a surge in interest as close-in neighborhoods gained in popularity. Several large developments were planned around the periphery of the neighborhood including the Village at Chosewood Park (planned for the Lakewood Assembly site), and Cityview @ Englewood between the single family area and the Atlanta BeltLine. These were in the approval process when the United States housing bubble stopped progress on the projects and the wave of foreclosures that swept the U.S. hit Chosewood early and hard. By 2008 approximately 24% of the housing stock in the neighborhood was vacant, most having been scavenged of all items of any value. By the end of 2008 houses were selling for less than $9,000. This was not uncommon on the south side of Atlanta. As part of the Atlanta Housing Authority plan to Demolished public housing projects in Atlanta Englewood Manor was razed in 2009. City BeltLine projects in the neighborhood include \\"Phase I opened ... in fall 2011, and it is an illustration of how the Atlanta BeltLine vision is taking hold in areas that had fallen into disuse and been neglected over time. Blighted industrial land along Boulevard south of Grant Park has been transformed into five acres of glorious greenspace featuring two large multiuse activity fields. \\" By the end of 2012 more than 60% of the dilapidated or vacant houses were renovated. Property crime and violent crime are rare within the neighborhood, though the periphery experiences a significant number along the arterial streets bounding the neighborhood. Chosewood Park is the pilot site for Edible Neighborhood. In February 2013 two dozen fruit and nut trees were planted along the sidewalks of Chosewood Park. This was the beginning of the pilot project. The trees were followed by hundreds of edible flowers planted in the sidewalk strips. In March 2013 three dozen herbs were planted: rosemary, oregano, thyme. All planted along the sidewalks and curbsides of Chosewood, available to everyone to take a snip for cooking. The following winter saw the planting of blueberries, raspberries, grapes, and figs along the sidewalks. In February 2017 another planting of 2 dozen apple, plum, pear, persimmon, and fig trees was provided for all neighbors who want to host a fruit tree for the neighborhood. Edible Neighborhood, a program to encourage community building, local food, and celebration of \\"permanent\\" plantings, began with this neighborhood project. Chosewood Park Neighborhood Association The Chosewood Park Neighborhood Association (CPNA) is actively engaged in improvement projects, social activities, and security. In 2011 the neighborhood volunteers removed invasive species and planted 50 native trees and understory within the park's woodland. The neighborhood association organizes tree and flower planting along neighborhood streets. In January 2013 approximately 1,000 day lilies were planted along neighborhood streets. In February 2013 over 20 fruit trees were planted. In March 2013 neighborhood volunteers and Trees Atlanta volunteers planted 85 shade trees and street trees. Also in March 2013 a Little Free Library was donated. The annual ice cream social is being organized as the Chosewood Park Frozewood Day Ice Cream Festival in July.

Descended from an illustrious family from Argos, Polycrates joined the court of the Egyptian monarch Ptolemy IV Philopator, just before his campaign against Antiochus III in 217 BC. He was of great service in drilling and encouraging the Egyptian troops, and he commanded the cavalry on the left wing at the battle of Raphia, in which Antiochus was defeated, and which secured for Ptolemy the provinces of Coele-Syria, Phoenicia, and Palestine. Although still young, Polycrates was second to no one in the king's court, says Polybius, and was accordingly appointed by Ptolemy governor of Cyprus. He discharged the duties of this office with the utmost fidelity and integrity. He thus secured the island for Ptolemy V Epiphanes, the infant son and successor of Ptolemy IV and, on his return to Alexandria in about 196 BC, he brought with him a considerable sum of money for the king's use. He was received at Alexandria with great applause which made him a powerful influence in the kingdom. But as he advanced in years, it is said that his character changed for the worse, and he indulged in every kind of vice and wickedness. Because of the loss of the later books of Polybius, Polycrates' subsequent career is unknown, but a fragment that has survived from the historian's books suggest that it was through his poor advice that Ptolemy took no part in military affairs, although he was only 25 years old. Polycrates was married to Zeuxo of Cyrene and had three daughters: Zeuxo, Encrateia and Hermione. Following his father's example as an athlete, Polycrates was a winner of the horse races at the Panathenaic Games from 192 to 184 BC, as were his wife and daughters. At that time, it was rare for women to participate in these races. For this reason they are frequently mentioned in texts from the Hellenistic period.

The concept has been also been referred to as \\"piggybacking\\" or \\"hitchhiking.\\" Description Hosted payloads are used most often by government agencies seeking to have communications capability in orbit without having to pay the cost of building and launching an entire government-owned satellite. Using a hosted payload on a commercial satellite can reduce both the expense and time required to get communications capacity into space. However, because some government agencies desire to own and control entire satellite platforms, hosted payloads have not been widely accepted by government space planners, despite the fact that a large proportion of government satellite communications is over commercially owned and operated satellites. For example, according to Space Commerce, over 80% of all U.S. government and military satellite communications goes through commercial services. Hosted payloads give government agencies the ability to own and control a portion of a satellite's capacity. In 2007, the US Department of Defense projected that satellite demand for the next 10‚Äì13 years would increase much more rapidly than the government could build and launch its own satellite systems, making hosted payloads on commercial satellites an attractive alternative. Hosted payloads are perfect for a variety of missions. These include Space Situational Awareness (SSA) such as collision avoidance, debris monitoring, nuclear detection and still imagery; and data collection for hyper-spectral sounding, ocean color analysis, ozone mapping, and weather tracking; as well as communications; and research and development. A hosted payload's schedule usually takes from start date to launch around 30 months. This launch time is actually an advantage compared to the longer launch date of typical government satellite programs. Hosted Payload's also allow the government a way to reduce many risks when it comes to program funding, launch delays and operational concerns. As of March 2010, eighteen commercial satellites that had the capability to carry U.S. government piggyback payloads have been placed into production, but only one is expected to host a payload because the government has yet to have a policy on the matter.http://www.spacenews.com/civil/100326-govt-missing-hosted-payload- opportunities.html The role of hosted payloads in the government has been increasing over the years. In 2007, Department of Defense's projected satellite demand for the next 10‚Äì13 years shows a rise in satellite demand but a gap in actual capability. Hosted Payloads is a potential answer to meet the demand of satellites through their ability to provide rapid and dependable access into space.http://www.intelsatgeneral.com/service-offerings/hosted- payloads In December 2010, mobile satellite provider, Inmarsat, announced plans to construct three Ka-band satellites to provide bandwidth to commercial military customers. One of the Global Xpress satellites, to be built by Boeing Defense, Space & Security, will carry a hosted payload built by Inmarsat. It is expected to be leased by a customer of the U.S. Department of Defense.http://www.spacenews.com/satellite_telecom/101222-ex-im-financing- global-xpress.html A particularly promising area of development for hosted payloads is in earth observation missions. There are countless environmental monitoring missions, both old and new, which should be launched in the coming years. IRIS An example of such was launched in November 2009 called the Intelsat 14. The Internet Routing in Space (IRIS) program, according to Intelsat, its provider of fixed satellites, was a \\"technology demonstrator\\" hosted payload. According to Intelsat's press release and Steve Boutelle, Vice President, Cisco Systems Global Government Solutions Group, the IRIS payload supports network services for voice, video and data communications, enabling U.S. military units and allied forces to communicate with one another using Internet Protocol (IP) and existing ground equipment. In January 2010, Cisco completed the first-ever software upgrade of an IP router aboard a commercial satellite while in orbit. Australian Defence Force/ ILS International Launch Services teamed up with Intelsat to launch the Intelsat 22 satellite for Intelsat on a Proton rocket. In April 2009 Intelsat announced an expansion agreement for hosted payload services with the Australian Defence Force (ADF). According to a press release, the Intelsat 22 satellite is under construction by Boeing Space and Intelligence Systems is scheduled for launch in the first half of 2012. The ADF purchased the remainder of the specialized ultra-high frequency (UHF) communications payload that Intelsat is integrating within its Intelsat 22 satellite. The Intelsat 22 satellite was promoted to provide optimal coverage for commercial networks, mobility and defense-related applications. Other examples With budget concerns facing the US space program, hosted payloads were examined in 2011 as a more cost-effective alternative to traditional space launches into orbit. This led to development of knowledge bases to further promote hosted payloads by the space industry. An example of a hosted payload is the U.S. Coast Guard's Nationwide Automatic Identification System (NAIS) Project. According to the Office of Space Commerce, NAIS is designed to enhance the current Automatic Identification System (AIS), which monitors vessel traffic for maritime domain awareness. The payload is testing the feasibility and effectiveness of AIS message reception and reporting from space for ship tracking and other navigational activities. The Coast Guard paid a commercial satellite operator (Orbcomm) to develop and integrate the NAIS demonstration payload on one commercial satellite. Sensing a business opportunity, the company used its own funds to add the same capability to five additional satellites. Other customers of a satellite-based AIS data service could include the Navy, NOAA, insurance firms, and trucking companies. The U.S. Air Force's Commercially Hosted Infrared Payload (CHIRP) flight demonstration program is a wide field-of-view, passive infrared sensor on a commercial GEO (SES-2) launched by SES in 2011.

The style stands in opposition to the Southern School () of Chinese painting. This style, in retrospect, focuses around the development of a distinct tradition of landscape painting in China. At the beginning of this brief period there was no clear image of how landscape painting would be realised. At its end there existed an idea of a national style.Barnhart, \\"Three Thousand Years of Chinese Painting\\", 93. This style is considered to be founded by Jing Hao who was among the first distinctive masters of landscape. His styles were propagated by his pupil Guan Tong, who in turn influenced Northern Song painters such as Li Cheng and Fan Kuan. Li Cheng uses the dramatic high mountain composition of Jing Hao and Guan Tong.Barnhart, \\"Three Thousand Years of Chinese Painting\\", 99. Later his style was enshrined within the artistic orthodoxy of Northern Song Dynasty. Guo Xi, patronized by Emperor Shenzong, had his name joined to name the Li-Guo school. The tradition the two men created is the classical, imperially sanctioned, official canon of Song Landscape painting.Barnhart, \\"Three Thousand Years of Chinese Painting\\", 119. However, it is important to note that Li Cheng was also influenced by the southern Jiangnan Landscape style. Juran travelled to the Song court around 975. Li Cheng's combination of the northern and southern styles is as if it were a microcosm symbolic of the physical reunification of China under the Song Dynasty. Later Dong Qichang would find it useful to contrast the Jiangnan style and the Northern Landscape style in order to support his theories. However his writings ignore the heavy influence both played on the formation of the artistic tradition in the Song and the subsequent dynasties.

It, along with the attached Sunday School building, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. History Classroom wing The congregation was initially organized in 1839. It was the first presbytery established in Iowa. with On February 2, 1842 the Rev. John Stocker became the first pastor and the church itself was organized with the following members: Elizabeth R. Stocker, Harvey Gillete, Azel Farnsworth, Jane Lathrop, Priscilla Burdit, William Hill, Isabella Ogilvie, Martha Vanatta, Rebecca Smith, Almira Lockwood and Ann Farnsworth. At first the congregation did not have a building of its own and they worshiped in a building called the People's Church, which was a union meeting house, a building occupied by Trinity Episcopal and the Masons, and a log school house. The congregation erected its first church building in 1849 when the Rev. John Hudson was the pastor. The building measured and was located at the corner of Mulberry Street between Third and Fourth Streets. The first Iowa Synod in the Presbyterian Church was organized here in 1852. By 1856 the congregation outgrew the building and plans were made for a new one. The present church building was built at the corner of Iowa Avenue and Fourth Street. The Gothic Revival style structure was dedicated in 1859. The dedicatory address was delivered by the Rev. W.S. Plummer, D.D., of the Western Theological Seminary in Allegheny, Pennsylvania. The classroom wing was added to the church in 1915. The building was listed as an American Presbyterian and Reformed Historical Site in 1976, and the following year it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The sanctuary was remodeled in 2004-2005. The renovation featured a larger gathering space in the narthex. Architecture The church building is a rectangular structure, built on a raised basement, that follows a basilica plan. The exterior is composed of red brick, and the early Gothic Revival style exhibits Tudor Revival elements. The building is five bays in length and divided by buttresses capped with white stone weatherings. It is also three bays wide. The shallow, gable roof features a narrow wood cornice. The three-stage central tower on the main facade includes the primary entry on the lower level and a belfry at the top. It is capped with a crenelated parapet. The door at the primary entrance is deeply recessed within a four-centered arch with a tracery-window transom. Pinnacles are located in each corner of the facade. The Sunday School building sits to the north of the church. The plan and massing of the structure is Neoclassical with Gothic Revival details that repeat those of the church. The two-story structure is on a raised basement, and capped with a hip roof. The facade features a three-bay gabled pavilion. The windows are rectangular overall with the exception of the second floor windows in the central pavilion, which have four-centered arches. The building also reflects the neighboring church with the white trim around windows and white stone for the water table. The two buildings are connected by an entrance pavilion. The stone trim and shape of the gable end reflects the pavilion of the Sunday School building. The wide Tudor arch and tracery panel at the entrance reflects the church's entry. The church, Sunday School building and the entrance pavilion form a U-shaped complex.

National Trust Trencrom Hill was acquired by the National Trust as freehold on 8 August 1946 from Lieutenant Colonel G L Tyringham. The freehold was 25.568 hectares (63.18 acres). On ascending the hill from the north side there is a plaque in situ in the rock facing the path. It reads: \\"This property was presented to the National Trust by Lt Col C L Tyringham, of Trevethoe in March 1946 & at his wish is to be regarded as a memorial to the men and women of Cornwall, who gave their lives in the service of their country during the two world wars. 1914 ‚Äì 1918, 1939 ‚Äì 1945\\" The well on the west side of the ramparts of the hill fort is known as the Giant's Well. JO Halliwell-Phillips mentioned it in 1861 in \\"Rambles in Western Cornwall\\", \\"Outfide the vallum at Trecrobben, or, as it is called by the rustics, Trancrom, is the Giant's Well\\". The well low down on the eastern flank of the hill is not the Giant's Well and is a disused shaft of the Praed Consols (Wheal Cherry/New Trencrom) sett, which was used as a well after the mine had flooded. Mining The sett (area) of Wheal Cherry (later known as New Trencrom Mine and Mount Lane Mine) included the summit of Trencrom Hill. Trencrom is within the granite and the sett also covered the metamorphosed killas to the east. Wheal Cherry seems to have been short-lived with ¬£2,293 spent on the erection of a 24-inch pumping engine and 24 inch whim with stamps in 1857/58 and by September 1858 the sett and materials being offered for sale. The sale notice stated that Wheal Cherry was ‚Ä≥a valuable property‚Ä≥. There was another attempt at the start of the 20th century by the Gerry Brothers of Lelant and after five years they sold their interest in 1907. At this time a new shaft was being sunk on the eastern slope and at a depth of found a wide lode which yielded of black tin to the ton. Work was still continuing on Wheal Cherry in 1916. A further attempt in 1943 at the mine, now known as the Mount Lane Mine was unsuccessful. A survey in January 1996 found small scale quarrying, mostly post-medieval using drills but in some cases using wedges which may be earlier. Large parts of the granite summit have been levelled and a paved track was probably used to transport stone from the quarry face on carts.

This discipline is an overlap between electrochemistry and chemical engineering. According with the IUPAC, the term electrochemical engineering is reserved for electricity intensive processes for industrial or energy storage applications, and should not be confused with applied electrochemistry, which comprises small batteries, amperometric sensors, microfluidic devices, microelectrodes, solid-state devices, voltammetry at disc electrodes, etc. More than 6% of the electricity is consumed by large-scale electrochemical operations in the US. Scope This diagram shows the relationship between electrochemical engineering and other disciplines. Electrochemical engineering combines the study of heterogeneous charge transfer at electrode/electrolyte interphases with the development of practical materials and processes. Fundamental considerations include electrode materials and the kinetics of redox species. The development of the technology involves the study of the electrochemical reactors, their potential and current distribution, mass transport conditions, hydrodynamics, geometry and components as well as the quantification of its overall performance in terms of reaction yield, conversion efficiency, and energy efficiency. Industrial developments require further reactor and process design, fabrication methods, testing and product development. Electrochemical engineering considers current distribution, fluid flow, mass transfer, and the kinetics of the electro reactions in order to design efficient electrochemical reactors. Most electrochemical operations are performed in filter-press reactors with parallel plate electrodes or, less often, in stirred tanks with rotating cylinder electrodes. Fuel cell and flow battery stacks are types of filter-press reactors. Most of them are continuous operations. History Cell room of a chlor-alkali plant ca. 1920 This branch of engineering emerged gradually from chemical engineering as electrical power sources became available in the mid 19th century. Michael Faraday described his laws of electrolysis in 1833, relating for the first time the amount of electrical charge and converted mass. In 1886 Charles Martin Hall developed a cheap electrochemical process for the extraction of aluminium from its ore in molten salts, constituting the first true large-scale electrochemical industry. Later, Hamilton Castner improved the process aluminium manufacturing and devised the electrolysis of brine in large mercury cells for the production of chlorine and caustic soda, effectively founding the chlor-alkali industry with Karl Kellner in 1892. The next year, Paul L. Hulin patented filter-press type electrochemical cells in France. Charles Frederick Burgess developed the electrolytic refining of iron ca. 1904 and later ran a successful battery company. Burgess published one of the first texts on the field in 1920. During the first three decades of the 20th century, industrial electrochemistry followed an empirical approach. After the Second World War, interest focused towards the fundaments of electrochemical reactions. Among other developments, the potentiostat (1937) enabled such studies. A critical advance was provided by the work of Carl Wagner and Veniamin Levich in 1962 who linked the hydrodynamics of a flowing electrolyte towards a rotating disc electrode with the mass transport control of the electrochemical reaction through a rigorous mathematical treatment. The same year, Wagner described for the first time \\"The Scope of Electrochemical Engineering\\" as a separated discipline from a physicochemical perspective. During 60s and 70s Charles W. Tobias, who is regarded as the \\"father of electrochemical engineering\\" by the Electrochemical Society, was concerned with ionic transport by diffusion, migration, and convection, exact solutions of potential and current distribution problems, conductance in heterogeneous media, quantitative description of processes in porous electrodes. Also in the 60s, John Newman pioneered the study of many of the physicochemical laws that govern electrochemical systems, demonstrating how complex electrochemical processes could be analysed mathematically to correctly formulate and solve problems associated with batteries, fuel cells, electrolyzers and related technologies. In Switzerland, Norbert Ibl contributed with experimental and theoretical studies of mass transfer and potential distribution in electrolyses, especially at porous electrodes. Fumio Hine carried out equivalent developments in Japan. Several individuals, including Kuhn, Kreysa, Rousar, Fleischmann, Alkire, Coeuret, Pletcher and Walsh established many other training centers and, with their colleagues, developed important experimental and theoretical methods of study. Currently, the main tasks of electrochemical engineering consist in the development of efficient, safe and sustainable technologies for the production of chemicals, metal recovery, remediation and decontamination technologies as well as the design of fuel cells, flow batteries and industrial electrochemical reactors. The history of electrochemical engineering has been summarised by Wendt, Lapicque, and Stankovic. Applications Electrochemical engineering is applied in industrial water electrolysis, electrolysis, electrosynthesis, electroplating, fuel cells, flow batteries, decontamination of industrial effluents, electrorefining, electrowinning, etc. The main example of an electrolysis based process is the Chloralkali process for production of caustic soda and chlorine. Other inorganic chemicals produced by electrolysis include: * Chlorine * Fluorine * Sodium chlorate * Ammonium persulfate * Sodium persulfate * Sodium hypochlorite * Potassium permanganate * Potassium dichromate * Hydrogen peroxide * Ozone * Manganese dioxide * Silver nitrate * Basic lead carbonate \\"White lead\\" * Several metals are produced or refined using electrochemical processes, see electrowinning. Conventions The established performance criteria, definitions and nomenclature for electrochemical engineering can be found in Kreysa et al. and an IUPAC report.

He was married to former olympian athlete Mercy Kuttan. Career Hailing from Punnapra, in Alappuzha district, Murali Kuttan was a late bloomer in his favourite sport. He initially competed in the shorter versions of the sprint, 100 metres and 200 metres. Success came his way after joining the Indian Army in 1974 and after he switched his attention to the 400 metres. He was national champion in 400 m during 1975 to 84. His personal best time in 400m was 46.8 s. One of his first international success came in the Indo-Russian athletic meet in 1978 where he won the 400m gold. In the same year, at the Bangkok Asian Games, Murali won the 400 m bronze behind Abbas Al Aibi of Iraq and compatriot Uday K. Prabhu. With the latter, Murali shared a healthy rivalry through the most part of the 1970s. He was also a member of the silver medal winning Indian team in the 4 √ó 400 m relay at the 1978 Bangkok Asian Games. In 1981, he won the bronze in the 4 √ó 400 m relay at the Asian Athletics Championships in Tokyo. Murali took a diploma in coaching from the Netaji National Institute of Sports in Calcutta in 1985 before joining TISCO, Jamshedpur as an athletic coach. Personal life Muralikuttan was married to Mercy Kuttan, a former athlete who represented India at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. He and Mercy had met at the selection camp for the 1980 Moscow Olympics. They married two years later. They were the first Indian athletic couple to emerge National champions and win Asian medals. Murlai took the role of the coach and had influenced Mercy to shift from long jump to 400 metre. Both Murali and Mercy worked for Tata Steel, Jamshedpur. They set up the \\"Mercy Kuttan Athletics Academy\\" in Kochi, a non-profit organisation to train promising youth for major international competitions.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. History The church was organized on February 5, 1842. There were originally nine members, many of whom transferred their membership from the Linn Grove Presbyterian Church near Springville, Iowa. It was originally called the Old School Presbyterian Church. While that generally refers to it being conservative, it also meant in the years before the Civil War that it was anti-slavery. Initially, the congregation met for services in public buildings, including the Linn County courthouse, which was in Marion at that time. There was no pastor in the early years. The Rev. Salmon Cowles, a Presbyterian missionary based in Keokuk, visited about four times a year. The Marion and Linn Groves churches shared the Rev. J.S. Fullerton as a pastor starting in 1849. Property on Market Street (now Tenth Street) was purchased for $60 in 1851. It took five years to build a church building with volunteer labor. In 1852 a Sunday School was organized. At the same time, the Rev. Alexander S. Marshall began a nearly 40-year pastorate with the church. He saw that construction was finished on the church. The congregation grew and planning for a new building was begun. Construction on the present Gothic Revival structure began in July 1884. It was designed by Marshalltown, Iowa architect Frank M. Ellis. Stone for the building was hauled in from Stone City, Iowa. The church was dedicated on September 27, 1885. A unique feature of this church building in Iowa is its octagonal shape. with The Westminster House was the first major addition since the church was built, and was constructed from 1954 to 1956. A kitchen was added and a new Moller organ was purchased at the same time. A major remodeling project occurred in 1967, which included a new ceiling and new pews. A 1988 addition was built and it included a lounge, choir room, and pastor's office. The lot northwest of the church was acquired in 1989, the building on it was razed and it was made into a parking lot. In 1997 the sanctuary was renovated with new carpet and new pew cushions. The following year the handbell choirs were established. The first part of a three-phase restoration project of the stained glass windows was completed in 1999. In 2000 Pastor Howard Chapman served a Presbyterian church in Scotland during the summer months, and First Presbyterian hosted Scottish Pastor Eric Foggit and his family. In 2001 the second phase of the stained glass window restoration was completed and the renovation of the Westminster House chapel as a multi- purpose room as well as a chapel was completed. Architecture A notable feature of the church building is its symmetry. It has a steeply pitched hipped roof, a square corner tower with a spire, and four large projecting gables. Large stained glass windows are located in three of those gabled elevations. The fourth gable houses the pipe organ on the interior. There are two main entryways into the building, one in the tower and one in the northeast angle. The sanctuary is an open room without columns or other dividers. Its primary decorative feature is the Gothic-style woodwork that frames the large windows and the ceiling. The pews are set at an angle so as to fill the octagonal space. The 1950s addition was built immediately adjacent to the west wall of the sanctuary. Social Ministry Mission House was built by First Presbyterian in 1985 just north of the church. The Churches of Marion Pantry, which was begun in 1982, is located there. It is operated by nine local churches and makes food available to those in need. Also housed there is Helping Hands Storeroom, which is operated by volunteers from First Presbyterian. The Storeroom provides donated clothing, bedding, household items, and toys to those in need.

He is associated with the commercial production of the sweet yeast bread panettone. Biography Motta was a Milanese pastry chef , before leaving for military service during The Great War. After the war, in 1919 he opened his first bakery starting production of panettone, sweet typical Milanese, first in the form of a handmade version and later expanding his production to make panettone at an industrial plant. Motta and his rival panettone maker Gioacchino Alemagna are credited with the industrialisation of panettone from its Milanese origins to a staple of the Italian Christmas. Production had expanded considerably by 1930 and a new large factory was required on the outskirts of town to replace the four small bakeries that Motta was using. In 1935 l‚Äôillustrazione italiana reported that the new factory had a conveyor belt measuring thirty metres and large industrial ovens to keep up with production.Stanisloa Porizo, Il panettone. Storia, leggende, segreti e fortune di un protagonista del Natale, Datanova, (2007), Motta‚Äôs edge in the production of panettone was to create a distinctive high dome shape to his bread that replaced the older style of flatter panettone as the standard. His startling success saw his company expand considerably during the inter war years with Motta foods introducing new breads including a celebratory Easter bread known as a Colomba di Pasqua, a dove shaped yeast bread that uses panettone yeast but contains less fruit. In many companies, panettone became the de rigueur holiday gift to give to staff. Top artists were commissioned by Motta to immortalize his bread in advertisements. Prices were slashed to attract yet more consumers.Alexandra Richardson, Panettone: the Quintessential Italian Cake and not only at Christmas!, Winter 2009 The Magazine of the British-Italian Society It is estimated that panettone is now sold in seventy five countries. After the war Motta's also manufactured ice cream including the famous brands Mottarello and Coppa del Nonno (Grandfather's cup). Motta's continued as an independent company until 1970 when it became state controlled.

There are often two distinct groups: the 'old' hard core (active from the year 1970) and the 'new' hard core (active since 1990 and violent), also known as Feyenoord third generation Rotterdam (FIIIR).Iedere grote rel begint met uitdagen, NRC Handelsblad, 28 April 1999 After this there came a third younger group, who frequently used hard drugs. In order to distinguish them, the SCF hooligans sometimes calls themselves 'real S.C.F.' analogy of the Real IRA.NIEUWE HOOLIGANS NOG GEWELDDADIGER AMSTERDAMSE POLITIE OP SCHERP OM VELDSLAG BIJ AJAX-FEYENOORD TE VOORKOMEN, De Telegraaf, 1 mei 1999 Moreover, the distinction between the 'new' hard core and the 'elusive hooligans' are thin: both groups seems a football subordinate role and is all about the riots.  Violence and composition  Violence forms an integral part of the SCF. In clashes with rival hooligans such as F-side of AFC Ajax, there are often carried weapons (such as knives, bats and brass knuckles), but firearms are rejected. Recordings of fights are sometimes made by members to return home to see. There is a silence within the group.Feyenoordfans vormden puur criminele organisatie, Het Parool, 19 augustus 1997 Within the SCF there is clear hierarchy. Newcomers (\\"errand boys\\") can be set by the SCF 'scout' or voluntary base, where boys with acquaintances in the SCF often easier to be included. All entrants must prove themselves. Running away from battles means for example that they be put out.Feyenoord Hooligan word je niet zomaar, Algemeen Dagblad, 22 februari 1997 If they are part of the SCF, it is often 'for life', as they describe themselves. By showing strength, members can progress to a higher status. The highest status have the 'leaders' or 'controls'.  History  The first time the group (then often called simply \\"Vak S\\", after the fixed position in the stadium) wide in the headlines was during the final of the UEFA Cup in 1974 when Feyenoord hooligans and Tottenham Hotspur went to blows with each other, with 200 wounded. In 1982 there was a bomb thrown by a Feyenoord hooligan during a game against AZ. In 1983 followed a rebound between Feyenoord and Tottenham Hotspur, who was wide again defeated by the press, which exclude images from a Feyenoord hooligan with a knife stabbing on a hooligan from Tottenham Hotspur. In the 1980s, many vandalism committed (scrapping trains and buses) were gas station s and shopping (in the city of the party) robbed and many fights were organized, especially with Ajax and the police. The authorities and the police were, however, was and did everything to thwart the group, with success: the group disintegrated. Early 1990s there was a violent new group, according to journalist Paul Gageldonk by UEFA were considered the most violent core of Europe.Interview Paul van Gageldonk: Hooligans Feijenoord, De Gelderlander, 23 augustus 1996 (bij de publicatie van zijn boek) This group was among others involved in the 'Battle of Beverwijk', where one or more Feyenoord hooligans killed F-side boy Carlo Picornie. Several other people were seriously injured. Because the fight was so heavy the riot police could look on only. According to some it was a miracle that \\"just\\" one man was killed. Feyenoord hooligans came armed with bats, chains, bottles, Molotov Cocktails, and tasers, many of which were seized by police after the battle. Earlier, in 1991 it was also a Feyenoord hooligan who killed FC Twente hooligan Erik Lassche, reportedly the first football death by violence. The violent reputation had its appeal to violent types who cared little about football.  Measures against SCF  Police seized hard after the murder and the prosecutor tried unsuccessfully to prosecute Feyenoord hooligans for participating in a criminal organization, the court found the evidence insufficient. However, the leaders of the SCF were often observed by a special unit of the Rotterdam police, who also visited the SCF hooligans at home and warned them that they were followed.Politie zit hooligans non-stop op de huid, De Telegraaf, 9 juni 2004 During the period from the year 1990 followed also various other measures like camera surveillance, the introduction of the season ticket with pictures and the introduction of stadium bans. Feyenoord is also attempted to prevent youth with problems to go on the hooligan tour, for example by organizing football tournaments for young people in Rijnmond. Because many previous measures are only partly led to results, Feyenoord agreed with Ajax to play away games in the coming years without fans. In March 2009 the Lower House on the football law to prepare for fights that offense. The law gives more powers to mayors nuisance groups area ban for a long time and contact ban to impose, including a notification can be imposed.

Today it is part of Sugar City. History The Hoogheemraadschap van Rijnland built this building as a meeting hall to use for water management of the IJ and the Haarlem Lake in 1645. They had previously built a similar meeting house in 1641 to oversee the dam in Spaarndam. Since 1518 when the Hoogheemraadschap sent men to defend the dam at Spaarndam from troops sent by the rebellious city of Haarlem, the Hoogheemraadschap had met for water management on neutral ground in Leiden. To be able to meet more efficiently during yearly inspection of the dikes, they built meeting halls in strategic locations outside the Haarlem city limits on their own terrain. The Hoogheemraadschap privileges were considered a higher form of government than the Haarlem city rights (awarded to Haarlem in 1245), and were described in a document that was given to the dike wardens at Spaarndam in 1255. This granting of privileges by Count William II of Holland was the subject of a painting by Caesar van Everdingen that was painted as decoration for the meeting hall in Halfweg, and which hangs today in the Gemeenlandshuis van Rijnland, the meeting hall purchased in 1578 on the Breestraat in Leiden. This building was also the permanent residence of the Halfweg dijkgraaf (official). The duties of the dike warden changed over time and Zwanenburg evolved into a weather station. The Zwanenburg resident Jan Noppen (1706‚Äì1734) and his friend and Spaarndam water board colleague Nicolaas Kruik were inspired by the British Royal Society to measure the temperature, air pressure, humidity, and rainfall 3 times daily. They decided to measure wind as well and it was Jan Noppen who invented the Dutch windspeed standard based on the amount of sail in use on windmill sails. For example, when it was too dangerous to run the mill, it was considered \\"molenwind 13\\", which today is \\"windkracht 8\\" or gale force on the Beaufort scale.Molenwind at the KNMI website The location was later in use by the town hall and chamber of commerce of Halfweg, and eventually in 1919 the newly formed N.V. Centrale Suiker Maatschappij, or CSM Suiker fabriek, set up headquarters there.

The Louis Sullivan-designed building has been individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1985. In 2000 it was included as a contributing property in the Second and Third Avenue Historic District. History St. Paul's Methodist Episcopal Church, as it was known at its founding, was begun in 1840. Its first minister was the Rev. J. Hodges, who was a circuit rider, and was sent by the Rock River Conference. He first preached in the autumn of 1840 in a log cabin owned by Mrs. John Listebarger. It is believed to be the first public (Christian) religious service in the city of Cedar Rapids. Land was purchased by the congregation for $180 on September 11, 1853 to build a church. The property later became the site for Union Station and is now the Third Avenue Parking Ramp. A one-story brick church was begun the same year. During construction, the building was blown over before the roof was completed. It was dedicated in 1856. As the congregation continued to grow a larger building was needed and in 1870 a new structure was built on the corner of Fourth Avenue and Fifth Street SE. Progress on building the structure was slowed by the financial panic of 1870. The lower floor was completed in 1873 and the main auditorium was completed five years later. Henry Ward Beecher preached in the newly completed auditorium. A new parsonage, the first for the church, was built as part of the church. That site, including the church and parsonage, were later razed to provide the location of the Young Women's Christian Association, now the present-day Waypoint shelter. Property for the present church building was purchased in 1909 at Third Avenue and Fourteenth Street, SE, which was on the edge of town at the time. Louis Sullivan was commissioned to design the new church. Sullivan lived in Cedar Rapids from 1910-1912 while he designed the church. He designed a ‚ÄúModern church for a seven-day program‚Äù that included Sunday School space, a gymnasium and a sanctuary with a multi-colored glass dome in the auditorium. The building would have cost twice the amount the church was willing to spend so Sullivan was told to re-draw his plans. He resigned as the architect after making minor changes that reduced the costs only slightly. He was not willing to sacrifice the ornamentation of his design. W.C. Jones was hired to re-draw the Sullivan plans within the budget of $100,000. He made minor changes to the design, which is essentially still Sullivan's work. Jones largely cut out many of the decorative details, such as four large angels on the church tower as well as interior changes in the auditorium. Bishop William Quayle dedicated the new church on May 31, 1914. The church building features a buttressed bell tower that is and tall. The church was remodeled in 1946. The project included new carpeting, a new organ, a remodeled chapel, and the gymnasium was converted into classroom space. In 1954 the sanctuary, formerly referred to as the auditorium, was remodeled and in 1963 an education wing was opened. A bell loft for the handbell choirs was added in 1976. The following year Robert L. Sipe built a new pipe organ. It includes four divisions, 43 ranks, and 2,358 pipes. The building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 27, 1985.

It was designated as a Michigan State Historic Site on February 19, 1958 and later listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 16, 1972. It is located very close to but is not part of the Downtown Adrian Commercial Historic District.  Description and history  Charles Croswell was born in 1825 in New York. He was orphaned at an early age, and went to live with his uncle, carpenter Daniel Hicks. Hicks, with young Croswell, moved from New York to Adrian in 1831. Hicks constructed this house some time in the 1840s. Croswell purchased the house from the Hicks family after Daniel died in 1847. Croswell himself moved into the house in the early 1850s soon after his marriage to Lucy Eddy. Croswell formed a law partnership and started his involvement in local and state politics, serving as deputy county clerk, register of deeds, and taking part in the formation of the Republican Party. He later served two terms in the state legislature, and served as the Governor of Michigan from 1877‚Äì1881. Lucy Eddy Croswell died in 1868, and Charles Croswell remarried in 1880 to Elizabeth Musgrave. Charles Croswell died in 1886, and Elizabeth lived in the house for two or three years until her own remarriage to lumber baron Thomas Merrill. In 1925, Croswell's widow, Elizabeth Merrill, restored the house, and donated it to the Lucy Wolcott Barnum Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution as a memorial to Charles Croswell. Today, the chapter continues to maintain ownership of the house, which now serves as a museum. Description Charles Croswell The Croswell House is a one-and-a-half-story Greek Revival structure, constructed of red-painted brick with white trim. A single story wing is located to one side, and a single-story extension is located at the rear. Two square-pillared verandas extend across the fronts of the main section and the wing. Each shelters an entryway, the one located in the main section which opens into a hallway, and the one located in the side wing leading into the dining room.

Furthermore, the Council welcomed that UNMEE had been able to retain the integrity of the Temporary Security Zone (TSZ) but expressed concern at the build-up of Ethiopian troops in areas adjacent to the TSZ. =Acts= The resolution extended UNMEE's mandate until 15 September 2005. Both parties were urged to fulfil their commitments under the Algiers Agreement and co-operate with the Boundary Commission in order for it to fulfil its mandate. The parties were further called upon to co-operate with UNMEE and protect United Nations personnel, and refrain from increasing troops in areas adjacent to the TSZ. There was concern at the worsening humanitarian situation in both Ethiopia and Eritrea. The Council reaffirmed the importance of dialogue between the two countries and the normalisation of their diplomatic relations. Meanwhile, it supported the efforts of the Special Envoy Lloyd Axworthy to secure the implementation of their agreements.

The congregation was organized in 1856 and the church building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. In 2004 it was included as a contributing property in the Jefferson Street Historic District. History Seventeen individuals signed the charter that initiated the congregation in 1856. Chicago architect Gurdon P. Randall designed the present church and the cornerstone was laid in 1868. with The building cost $30,000 to construct, and it was dedicated on December 9, 1869. A parsonage was built on the eastside of the church in 1891, which was later sold to the university and is now the location of the biology building. In 1903 a Lyon and Healy organ was installed. Other additions to the church include the administration annex, which was built in 1924, and the Little Chapel built in 1940. In 1957 the Congregational Church and the Evangelical and Reformed Church merged to form the United Church of Christ. The congregation was affiliated with the new church at this time. The same year a new Wicks organ was installed and the Christian Education building was added. Renovations to the church building made for a new ground floor entry and improvements to the social hall, choir loft and chancel in 1969. The sanctuary became handicapped accessible in 1986, and was renovated in 2002. The Casavant Fr√®res, Opus 3867, pipe organ was donated anonymously to the congregation in 2007. It combines elements of the church's previous instruments. The base of the retable woodwork is from the 1903 Lyon and Healy organ; the upper portion of the case, with the Gothic style embellishments, were from the 1934 additions; and seven ranks from the 1958 Wicks organ are part of the 29 ranks of the new organ. Architecture The brick, Gothic Revival structure features a square corner tower, an asymmetrical facade, and a small tower at the rear that was part of the ventilating heating system. The small turret opposite the tower originally terminated in a pinnacle. A small vestibule, added in 1969, projects from the front of the building. Above it are three lancet windows. The same type of window also lines the side walls. The main sanctuary is located above a raised basement. A 1934 renovation of the interior saw the introduction of the Gothic-styled beams on what was a plain ceiling.

Paul was best known for his previous world records in push- ups, and most notably consecutive one-finger push-ups. Records ;One-Arm Push-Ups Paul's first world record happened in 1982, June 10, when Paul accomplished 760 one-armed push-ups at the YMCA, Wimbledon, Greater London, at the age of 27 years. As an effect Paul's record appeared in the, 1983 - Guinness Book of Records. Paul's second world record occurred in 1983, July 10, when Paul accomplished 1,753 one-armed push-ups at the Wimbledon YMCA, London. ;One-Finger Push-Ups The One-Finger push-up is done with just one finger of one arm only, and must be done consecutively with no breaks. The back must remain straight, and the elbow must make a 90 degree angle to mark each successful push-up. However, Guinness does allow the one-finger to be performed on the knuckle of the finger being used (Paul used his fully extended finger). The One-Finger can be subjectively argued as the hardest push-up in the Guinness category, as most Guinness push-ups are well with the thousands. The Pioneer of the first documented one finger push-up can be credited to Mich (Michael Gooch) who in 1982, March 20 achieved 39 one finger push-ups during the Kyokushinkai European Championships (Karate Championships) at Wembley Arena, London UK. Soon after, Mich Gooch, broke his record achieving 45 one-finger push-ups to become the first Guinness World Record Holder in the one-finger in 1985. The Attempt On 21 April 1992 at London's Hippodrome, Lynch performed 124 consecutive one-finger push-ups over approximately 5 minutes, during what would have been his 125th push-up, Paul shattered the bones in his finger. After the attempt, Lynch was quoted as saying, \\"It felt like sticking my finger in an electrical socket.\\" Guinness no longer publicizes the consecutive one-finger push-up, rather a new category of most one-finger in 30 seconds has been introduced.

With Iraqi government forces occupied by the Iran-Iraq War, Kurdish Peshmerga (combining the forces of the KDP and PUK) succeeded in taking control of some enclaves, with Iranian logistic and sometimes military support. The initial rebellion resulted in stalemate by 1985. The most violent phase of the conflict between the Kurds and Iraqi Ba'athist regime was the Al- Anfal Campaign of the Iraqi Army against the Kurdish minority, which took place between 1986‚Äì1988 and included the Halabja chemical attack. The Al-Anfal campaign ended in 1988 with an agreement of amnesty between the two belligerents. No permanent gains were made by the Kurds. Background =The Kurdish people of Iraq= Iraqi Kurdistan is located in northern Iraq, along its borders with Syria, Turkey, and Iran. It is a mostly mountainous and fertile region. Towards the north, along the Iranian border, is the periphery of the Iranian Zagros Mountains. The Kurds have lived in this region for thousands of years, but never as part of a Kurdish ethno-state. Instead, different empires and modern states have controlled this region. The Kurds identify themselves as Kurdish through the language they speak, their customs, religion (mainly Sunni Muslim, but with Shia, Alevi and Yazidi minorities), tolerance of other religions, and their tribal affiliation. Tribes are determined through kinship and territorial location.Kreyenbroek, Philip G., and Stefan Sperl. The Kurds: A Contemporary Overview. London: Routledge, 1992. Print. Pg. 12. For Kurds, identification with the tribe is more important and significant than the official country the tribe is located in. Since the 1920s, the Kurds have harbored grievances against the various Iraqi governments due to a lack of representation in state institutions. =Kurdistan Democratic Party= The Kurdistan Democratic Party, KDP, is the longest standing and preeminent political party of the Kurdish people. It was created in 1946 under Mulla Mustafa Barzani with initial goals based on Kurdish nationalist aspirations and the desire for self-government.Gunter, Michael M. \\"The KDP-PUK Conflict in Northern Iraq.\\" Middle East Journal 50.2 (1996): 227. Print. Overtime Barzani and his supporters evolved the mission of the KDP into a fight for \\"the full rights of the Kurds for self-determination ... achieved through peaceful means in a democratic, pluralist, and federal Iraq.\\"\\"General Information About KDP.\\" Kurdistan Democratic Party Official Website. Web. 06 Oct. 2010. . Barzani was the first person to assemble almost universal Kurdish nationalism among the people and from the mid-1930s through to his expulsion from Iraq in the 1970s he was synonymous with the Kurdish quest for independence.Kreyenbroek, Philip and Sperl, Stefan. Pg. 52. Barzani led rebellions intermittently against the governments of Iraq (First and Second Iraqi‚ÄìKurdish Wars), Iran, and Turkey, in hopes of gaining larger revolutionary forces each time. =Patriotic Union of Kurdistan= The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, PUK, was established in 1975 under Jalal Talabani. Talabani had worked as a Kurdish revolutionary in the KDP and grew his name and reputation by speaking out against Barzani. In 1975 Talabani and his followers split from the PUK and started a new, more liberal party. In essence the PUK is run on the same platform as the KDP, lobbying for \\"autonomy for Kurdistan, democracy for Iraq\\". The PUK defines itself apart from the KDP by drawing its supporters from central and southern Kurdistan. The PUK has come to represent a more urban, intellectual, and politically forward group of people, versus the traditional rhetoric of the KDP. Supporters of each party are able to distinguish themselves personally by tribal alliance, personal differences, and ideological disagreement. =The Iraqi Ba'athist Government= The KDP and PUK, although separate political parties, fought the same opponent, the government of Iraq under the leadership of Saddam Hussein. Since the beginning of the Ba'ath rule in Iraq there have been issues between the leaders of the Ba'ath and the Kurdish people. Intermittent negotiations occurred between the two groups to discuss party platforms and to try to come to a consensus on representation; however the Ba'ath were exceptionally distrustful of the Kurds and harbored suspicions against the KDP, especially of leader Barzani.McDowall, David. The Kurds: A Nation Denied. London: Minority Rights Group, 1992, 113. In contrast, a natural alliance was drawn between the Ba'ath and political party PUK. Both were leftist organizations that advocated a Kurd-Arab alliance.McDowall, David, pg. 90. =Window of opportunity= By the late 1970s, Masud Barzani had already established a force of 5,000 men in North Iraq (by 1979), and his forces engaged the PDKI during 1979 Kurdish rebellion in Iran, true to their alliance with Iran.Lortz, M. G. Willing to Face Death: A History f Kurdish Military Forces - the Peshmerga - From the Ottoman Empire to Present-Day Iraq. 2005: p.52. In September 1980, Iraq engaged in warfare with Iran over the Shatt al-Arab and rather than a quick victory the war had degenerated into a very long drawn out stalemate. The Kurds saw this as the prime opportunity to take control of the Kurdish areas, while the Iraqi government was preoccupied and weakened. The goal was to create a new bargaining platform and push Iraqi governmental forces out of Kurdistan. Since the beginning of the warfare, the KDP under Barazanis established a solid alliance with the Iranians, while the PUK - a leftist organization, kept its distance from the newly created conservative Islamic Republic of Iran, receiving logistic support from Baathist Syria and from Libya. Chronology =War tactics= A wide variety of war tactics were used in this conflict, everything from the most simple hit and run to advanced chemical warfare. This conflict is a good case to look at how asymmetrical capabilities influence battle. Kurdish tactics To combat the Ba'ath the Kurd's strategy involved the use of guerrilla warfare and armed with light weapons either stolen from the Iraqi troops or given to them by the Iranians.Human Rights Watch. GENOCIDE IN IRAQ: The Anfal Campaign Against the Kurds, A Middle East Watch Report. New York City: Human Rights Watch, 1993, http://hrw.org/reports/1993/iraqanfal/ANFAL1/htm The peshmerga worked with the locals to build up defenses and teach defensive tactics to the local militia in hopes of educating the mass public and protect them against future attack and seizure by the Ba'ath army. Furthermore, the peshmerga supplied the villages with a local government and services (education, medicine, security). The mountains in northern Kurdistan proved to be an excellent place to hide and camp out. The mountain region was also very difficult for the Iraqi army to traverse on foot and by air. The guerrilla style war tactics of the Kurds proved very beneficial when fighting in this region. In contrast to the helpful assistance of the northern region, the southern flatlands of Kurdistan worked against the Kurdish insurgency. The Iraqis were able to easily bomb the major cities of the southern region and the fertile valley. Kurdish guerrilla tactics of hit and run did not prove to be successful against the firepower of the Iraqis during aerial bombardment and shelling. Iraqi tactics The Iraq army used full-scale military tactics in combating the Kurdish insurgency. In the heavily populated agricultural areas daily air raids destroyed towns, crops, and people. The army used its superior military power of more men, guns, and artillery to combat the insurgents. In order to inflict the greatest destruction, the Iraqi army divided Southern Kurdistan into a grid pattern, dividing the most densely populated cities and farming areas into sections. The grid facilitated a mechanized detonation of heavy artillery in predetermined areas by fighter planes and inflicted the greatest destruction possible. The Kurds had no knowledge of the oncoming attack or ways to protect themselves from the shelling. This was very structured and assigned per Iraqi army goals. The shelling and bombing per grid was very successful in driving mass fear among the Kurds. Aftermath =Al-Anfal Campaign= Beyond using traditional warfare techniques the Ba'ath engaged in the use of chemical weapons against the Kurds during the al-Anfal campaign of 1987‚Äì88. A total onslaught began against the Kurdish people that eventually killed tens of thousands of Kurds and displaced at least one million of the Kurdish population to Iran and Turkey.\\"Whatever Happened To The Iraqi Kurds?\\" (Human Rights Watch Report, March 11, 1991). Web. 6 Oct. 2010. Ali Hassan al- Majid, nicknamed \\"Chemical Ali,\\" led the three step process of \\"village collectivization\\": the destruction of hundreds of Kurdish villages and the relocation of their residents to concentration camps, mujamma'at. This campaign was the first documented use of chemical weapons by a government against its own civilians. The process of village collectivization violated widespread human rights, it is an example of systematic genocide that went unchecked by the global community. Al-Majid and his commanding officers warned if the Peshmerga did not lay down their arms and allow the cleansing program to continue peacefully the army would stop the Peshmerga with chemical weapons. Iraq had signed the 1925 Geneva Protocol outlawing the production and use of chemical and biological weapons, however this did not stop al-Majid from giving the OK to the army to proceed with the deployment of shells carrying the deadly weapons. This was the first time a government used chemical weapons against its own civilian population. The Iraqi government and leaders behind the campaign were not punished for their campaign of genocide or the violations against the Geneva Protocol of 1928. Halabja poison gas attack The most famous attack of chemical warfare by the Iraqi army against the Kurds was the attack on the town of Halabja on March 16, 1988. Over 4,000 Kurds were killed in this one attack by the combination of mustard gas and hydrogen cyanide.Anonymous. \\"The Silence from Halabja.\\" Commonwealth 115.9 (1988): 261. Print. Between 7,000 and 10,000 civilians were injured and thousands more died of complications, diseases, etc. stemming from the release of chemical gas. The town was attacked because Kurdish guerrillas had allied with Tehran and the city was now under Iranian control.\\"Whatever Happened To The Iraqi Kurds?\\" (Human Rights Watch Report, March 11, 1991).\\" Web. 08 Oct. 2010. Conventional artillery, mortars, and rockets bombed Halabja for two days before the chemical attack; the use of chemical weapons was done for good measure to assure no survivors were possible. This attack is considered separate from the al-Anfal campaign and was one of the last attacks by the Iraqis during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. This act has also been declared an act of genocide against the Kurdish people of Iraq. =End of hostilities= The rebellion by the PUK and KDP was officially declared over by the Iraqi government on September 6, 1988 when a decree of amnesty for all Iraqi Kurds was read aloud on the radio.GENOCIDE IN IRAQ, p. 297 The announcement came as a surprise to the Kurdish population. The decree was declared most likely because Baghdad believed the peshmerga had finally been defeated. The government pardoned the insurgents, but refused to let the Kurds return to their previous relatively free lives. The Ba'ath instituted draconian measures on all surviving towns and cities in Kurdistan. The government feared a resurgence of the insurgent peshmerga group, draconian measures prevented a revival. Furthermore, any man suspected having ties with the peshmerga insurgency were round up and relocated to camps in the southern deserts. The men taken to these deserts were tortured on a daily basis and murdered in mass quantities. It is believed these efforts to weed out any remaining insurgents lasted through 1989 with an additional 300,000 people relocated from various villages to \\"more modern villages with better facilities.\\" Secure zones, or cluster camps, were created along the Iranian border as well as outside the cities of Erbil, Mosul, and Suleimaniyeh.O'Ballance, Edgar. The Kurdish Struggle 1920‚Äì1994. New York: St. Martin's Press, Inc (1996), 176 =Post Iran‚ÄìIraq War= KDP and PUK controlled areas of Kurdistan The decree of amnesty did not bring any gains for the Kurdish front nor did it redistribute Kurdish powers or representation in the Iraqi government. After al-Anfal and the post-rebellion oppression the Kurds did not engage in further resistance, instead the leaders tried more diplomatic means to engage the Ba'ath in coming to a consensus on the status of Iraqi Kurdistan. No progress was made in the diplomatic realm either. Inter-factional issues between the KDP and PUK were continually on the rise and prevented any progress in Kurdish autonomy. These internal issues degenerated into civil war in the 1990s, after the KDP and PUK took control of part of northern Iraq following the Gulf War (see Iraqi Kurdish Civil War). =Recognition of Kurdish autonomy= With the overthrow of the Ba'ath government by the United States in 2003 the Kurds have increased diplomatic means to seek further gains towards legitimacy. The United States and Kurdish parties disagree over the ethnic alignment of the regional government, and this disagreement continues to stall any concrete gains from occurring. The United States believes a non-ethnically defined government is best for the region so that the collective majority can broker an identity and connect both politically and as a society. However the Kurds do not agree with this concept, as they prefer a regional government explicitly built on the Kurdish identity.O'Leary, Carole A. \\"The Kurds of Iraq: Recent History, Future Prospects.\\" Middle East Review of International Affairs Journal 6.4 (December 2002). http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2002/issue4/jv6n4a5.html This is a step in the direction of autonomy and a method for the Kurdish population to showcase their abilities in governing themselves and generating a productive self-sufficient economy. Time will tell if these new negotiations and concepts will bear success for the Iraqi Kurdish plight. Massoud Barzani has been elected president of Iraqi Kurdistan and Jalal Talabani has been elected president of the new Iraqi democratic government. Impact: refugee and death statistics * Refugees: At least 1 Million people fled (almost 30% of the population) to Iran, Turkey and Pakistan ** Since 1971, at least 370,000 have sought refugee in Iran, over 10% of the Iraqi Kurdistan population * Al-Anfal Campaign ** 50,000 to 100,000 were killed, including women and children ** 90% of targeted Kurdish villages were destroyed, this is approximately 4,000 villages * Halabja poison gas attack ** 3,000‚Äì5,000 killed ** 7,000 to over 10,000 injured ** At least 50,000 Kurds escaped into Iran after this one attack These numbers were collected by Human Rights Watch.GENOCIDE IN IRAQ Role of Iran Iran covertly aided the Iraqi Kurds against the Iraqis with weapons, food supplies, and intelligence in exchange for intelligence on Iraq movements and assistance along the northern Iran‚ÄìIraq border.Gunter, Michael M. \\"The KDP-PUK Conflict in Northern Iraq.\\" Middle East Journal 50.2 (1996): 18. Print In addition, Iran was an ally of Masud Barzani's and aided the KDP with arms and training of peshmerga forces and leaders. In exchange for arms and education the Iranians received intelligence on Iraqi military information and Kurdish assistance in fighting the Iraqi army. The Iranians had an invested interest in assisting the Kurds. The constant siege by the Kurds preoccupied the Ba'ath and prevented the army from devoting entire resources to conquering the Iranians. The Iranians supported the Kurds just to the point where they were powerful enough to fight against the Iraqis, but not strong enough to overcome the Iraqi army.

Dry river canyons cut through the hills, and game trails led in and out of the brush. Unlike the Kalahari, which I had glimpsed from the airplane, here the vegetation was thick. Almost every bush and tree had thorns. \\"In the early light, gemsbok, hartebeest and kudu were easily spotted by the reflection of sunlight on horn. We stopped to glass on top of one hill, and a troop of baboons took off running along the road below us.\\"'' He is twice past President of the Northwest Outdoor Writers Association (NOWA).

Study  √âmile Brumpt introduced the xenodiagnosis technique into parasitological research and extensively studied such diseases as bilharzia, Chagas disease, onchocerciasis and leishmaniasis. Medical professionals primarily use xenodiagnosis in determining the presence of a chronic infection of Trypanosoma cruzi (the flagellate that causes Chagas disease). Directly and definitively demonstrating the presence of this causative agent in a patient proves difficult. Therefore, the doctor allows a triatominae, a vector of the flagellate, to take a blood meal from the patient. The doctor later inspects the gut of the triatominae for growth of Trypanosoma cruzi. Medical professionals historically successfully identified babesiosis with xenodiagnosis, both in hamsters for Babesia microti and in gerbils for Babesia divergens.

He began his career in Germany and Switzerland, before moving to England in 2012 where he spent the next three years. Club career =Germany= Born in Wei√üenfels, Proschwitz played football as a youth for teams in Michelau, Lichtenfels and Hallstadt, before joining the youth team at Greuther F√ºrth. He signed a contract for the 2004‚Äì05 season with the reserve team of Hoffenheim, before spending the 2005‚Äì06 season in the reserve team of Hamburg, where he played in the fourth tier. In 2007, he dropped a league to the reserve team of VfL Wolfsburg in the fifth tier where he achieved his first promotion back to the fourth tier, scoring 16 goals in the process. Following his success in Wolfsburg, however, he opted to switch to league rivals Hannover 96 II, scoring 11 times in 33 games. =Switzerland= In 2009, he transferred to the Liechtenstein side FC Vaduz, who had been recently relegated back to the Swiss Challenge League, the second highest league in Switzerland. He made his debut on 16 July 2009, and went on to score 23 goals in 29 appearances for the club. He remained with Vaduz for only a single season. In May 2010, he signed a three-year contract with FC Thun, who had just been promoted to the Swiss Super League, the top tier of Swiss football, the first time he had played in the highest league in a country, scoring eight goals up to April 2011. On 12 April 2011, he made it clear that he wished to leave Thun and move to FC Luzern in the summer transfer window. =SC Paderborn= He signed a three-year deal with Luzern, a contract which would last until 2014. A change in management at FC Luzern, however, meant that Proschwitz was surplus to requirements, and was immediately transferred out of the club before the season had even kicked off. He returned to Germany, signing with 2. Bundesliga side SC Paderborn 07. He made his debut on 17 July 2011 against FC Hansa Rostock, scoring the first goal of the game. He played 33 times for Paderborn in 2011‚Äì12, scoring 17 times. Along with Alexander Meier and Olivier Occ√©an, he was the joint top scorer in division. Following the 2011‚Äì12 season, his future was once again uncertain, with several clubs interested in signing him from Paderborn, including his former youth team SpVgg Greuther F√ºrth and English Championship side Hull City. On 12 July 2012, it was reported that Proschwitz and his agent had flown out to Hull City's pre-season training camp in Portugal to discuss personal terms with the English club. =Hull City= On 19 July 2012, he signed for Hull City on a three-year contract for a fee of ‚Ç¨3.3 million (¬£2.6 million). His debut came when Hull defeated Rotherham United on penalties after a 1‚Äì1 draw in a League Cup first round tie on 11 August. Proschwitz scored one of the penalties to help ensure Hull City booked their place in the next round of the League Cup. He made his league debut a week later, in the Championship opener at home to Brighton which resulted in a 1‚Äì0 win. His first goals for the club came in a 2‚Äì1 victory against Ipswich Town on 20 October 2012, in which he scored twice after coming on as a late substitute. On 5 January 2013, Nick kept his side in the FA Cup in the 3rd Round tie against Leyton Orient with a 90th-minute equaliser, a goal that would become a contender for the club's goal of the season competition. On 4 May 2013, in the final match of season that would see Hull promoted to the Premier League, Proschwitz scored a vital 58th-minute equaliser against Cardiff City. The goal was his 3rd of the season in the league and his 5th in total. In the same match however, he did see his late penalty saved by David Marshall that, if scored, would have secured victory for the Tigers and consequently promotion; as it was, Cardiff counter-attacked and gained a penalty of their own merely seconds later, which they duly converted to leave the final score at 2‚Äì2. There would be another fifteen minutes of anxious waiting by Hull players, staff and fans alike for Watford's (Hull's promotion rivals') loss to Leeds to be confirmed, meaning Proschwitz's penalty miss was not, as it could have been, ultimately significant. He made his Premier League debut as a late substitute in a 1‚Äì0 loss to Tottenham Hotspur on 27 October 2013. On 23 January 2014, Proschwitz signed for Barnsley on loan for the remainder of the 2013‚Äì14 season. =Brentford= On 7 August 2014, Proschwitz signed for newly promoted Championship side Brentford on a free transfer. He signed an initial one-year contract with an option for a further two years. Lacking fitness, Proschwitz made his Bees debut from the bench on the opening day of the 2014‚Äì15 season, coming on for Andre Gray after 67 minutes of a 1‚Äì1 draw with Charlton Athletic. He made his first start in the following match against Dagenham & Redbridge in the League Cup first round and scored Brentford's third goal in an incredible 6‚Äì6 draw, which was settled on penalties in the Bees' favour. Proschwitz made his first league start for the club in a 2‚Äì1 victory over Blackpool on 19 August and scored his first league goal of the season three games later, tapping in Jon Toral's cross to seal a 2‚Äì0 win over Rotherham United. =Coventry City (loan)= On 27 February 2015 Proschwitz moved to Coventry City on loan until the end of the 2014‚Äì15 season. He scored his first Sky Blues goal in a 3‚Äì1 defeat against Crewe Alexandra at the Ricoh Arena. =Return to SC Paderborn= Following his release from Brentford, Proschwitz returned to Germany and SC Paderborn 07 in the summer of 2015. He was released on 25 January 2016, after an incident in which he allegedly exposed himself to a woman during a late-night drinking session at SC Paderborn's mid-season training camp. =Sint-Truidense= Proschwitz signed for Belgian First Division A club Sint-Truidense on 2 February 2016. He scored just 4 goals in 33 appearances for the club, before departing the club at the end of the 2016‚Äì17 season. =Sparta Rotterdam= On 4 September 2017, Proschwitz moved to the Netherlands to join Eredivisie club Sparta Rotterdam on a one-year deal. He finally made his debut on 29 October, coming on as an 85th minute substitute in a 2‚Äì1 home win over FC Groningen. =Eintracht Braunschweig= In May 2019 it was confirmed, that Proschwitz had joined Eintracht Braunschweig on a 2-year contract.Eintracht Braunschweig verpflichtet Nick Proschwitz, braunschweiger-zeitung.de, 29 May 2019 Honours Hull City *Football League Championship runner-up: 2012‚Äì13 Individual * Swiss Challenge League top scorer: 2009‚Äì10 (23 goals in 29 games for FC Vaduz) * 2.

His most notable achievement was the 1887 Jubilee Bridge. Early life Leslie was born in London on 18 August 1831 the son of Charles Robert Leslie a noted painter and illustrator. His younger brother George was also later a painter and illustrator and his older brother Robert Leslie became a marine artist. Educated at the Mercers' School in London at the age of 16 Leslie was apprenticed to Isambard Kingdom Brunel, the usual fee of 1,000 guineas was waived in consideration of his father painting some pictures for Brunel. Leslie became a specialist at bridge building and in 1851 was assistant engineer on the Chepstow Bridge, his next position was resident engineer on the Saltash Bridge. Before the Saltash Bridge was completed he returned to London to undertake inspection of material for the steamship Great Eastern and at the launch of the ship he acted as an assistant to Brunel. India right Brunel was a consulting engineer to the Eastern Bengal Railway and Leslie was sent to India as engineer in charge of bridges and viaducts. He supervised the building of the Eschamutter and Koormar river bridges before returning to Britain in 1861 to design bridges for railway lines in South Wales. He soon returned to India as chief engineer of the Eastern Bengal Railway and in 1876 Leslie became agent and chief engineer to the East India Railway Company. His greatest achievement in India was the Hooghly Bridge (known as the Jubilee Bridge when it opened in 1887) for which he was appointed a Knight Commander Order of the Indian Empire. He also designed an unusual floating pontoon bridge which straddled the Hooghly in Calcutta for 70 years and the Gorai River railway bridge near Kushtia in Bangladesh. Later years While in India Leslie lost his wife, three daughters and a son-in-law all within three years and after repeated attacks of malaria Leslie returned home to England with two orphan granddaughters in 1887. The ship Tasmania was wrecked off Corsica and while carrying one of his granddaughters to safety he fell and injured his knee, it was to trouble him for the rest of his life. The injury was not helped by an accident when he was 84 when he was knocked down by a bicycle as he left his London home and broke a thigh. Despite the injuries he continued to work and in 1895 he became the chairman of the Southern Punjab Railway Company in London. In 1899 he went on a brief return visit to India to discuss a replacement for his floating bridge which was now inadequate for the increased usage, in 1918 when he was 88 he submitted a new design.

Each lion is signed and dated P. Kupper. Eight Stone Lions is an outdoor sculpture, and therefore a public art piece. The lions are approximately 36 x 30 x 65 inches and their bases are approximately 54 x 36 x 70 inches. History Henry Clay Payne donated Eight Stone Lions to the city of Milwaukee. They were placed to guard each end of the two iron bridges in Lake Park. \\"The bridges were designed by local engineer Oscar Sanne to cross the two branches of the south ravine on either side of the lighthouse, carrying carriage and pedestrian traffic in and out of Lake Park, the original southern entrance to the park. The drive curned north from Park Avenue (now Wahl Avenue) along the bluff overlooking the lake.\\"Buck, Diane M. and Virginia A. Palmer (1995). Outdoor Sculpture in Milwaukee: A Cultural and Historical Guidebook, p. 129. The State Historical Society of Wisconsin, Madison On November 1, 1897 the sculptures were dedicated at Lake Park, Milwaukee's first planned public park, which was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted. A popular Sunday activity at this time was to take the streetcar to Lake Park, where families would stroll, picnic and listen to a band concert. Artist Paul Kupper designed two plaster lion casts, which Otto Lachmund, a stonecutter, then cast and carved under Kupper‚Äôs direction. Kupper was living in Milwaukee during the 1890s, but had moved to California after 1904. Kupper also created a 1,200 pound badger cast, which is now on display at the State Capitol in Madison, Wisconsin. Condition Eight Stones Lions was surveyed in April 1993 and found to need treatment. In 2014, a truck driver, supposedly following his GPS, mistook the pedestrian path for a road and attempted to drive across the two Lion Bridges. The truck became wedged into the second bridge, and parts of the bridges were damaged, but the lions were not harmed.

History and architecture  = First St. James Church = St. James was formed on June 6, 1725, and the first building, a wooden structure located on New London's Parade, was opened in 1732. An arrow was shot into the gilt wooden ball at the top of the steeple by the chief of a visiting Native American delegation. The arrow hung there until the church's destruction in 1781. During the American Revolution, a number of the Parish members were loyalists. Services stopped between mid-1775 and the fall of 1778 since tensions were apparently high regarding the use of prayers for the King and Royal Family, and in 1778, the Parish voted that no person be permitted to...act as a pastor...unless he openly prays for Congress.... The church was destroyed by a fire set in New London on September 6, 1781 during the Battle of Groton Heights. British forces in New London during that engagement were under the command of Brigadier General Benedict Arnold, a native of nearby Norwich. = Samuel Seabury (1729‚Äì1796) = Samuel Seabury, First Bishop of the Episcopal Church and Rector of St. James After his consecration in Aberdeen Scotland on November 14, 1784, as the first bishop of the Episcopal Church (United States), Bishop Samuel Seabury returned to New London in 1785 as rector of St. James. He died in New London on February 25, 1796, and is now buried in Hallam Chapel located in the undercroft of St. James. A cenotaph designed by architect Richard Upjohn is located on the north side of the sanctuary, and his original grave slab is located outdoors on the north side of the church, now covered by a duplicate. = Second St. James Church = A new church was consecrated on September 20, 1787, near the current site of the Salvation Army building in New London. This was the building that served Bishop Seabury. As the Parish began to grow during the mid-1800s, it was clear that a larger building was needed. = Third St. James Church = This building was designed by English-born architect Richard Upjohn in the Gothic Revival style. The cornerstone was laid November 3, 1847, and the church was consecrated on June 11, 1850. It was built in a cruciform style with north and south transepts. There is a very prominent bell tower on the northwest corner. St. James is an excellent example of Upjohn's architectural style. It is notable that St. James was started the year after Upjohn completed Trinity Church (Manhattan). The New York Ecclesiological Society criticized Upjohn for the \\"moorish\\" design of the roof bracing in St. James, however, it was well received locally. = Rectory = The rectory is located on Huntington St. in one of four Greek Revival houses built between 1835 and 1845 known as Whale Oil Row. This row of buildings is unique in Connecticut, and possibly the United States, and documents the lifestyle of their wealthy owners who worked in the whaling industry of that time. Lawrence Memorial Window by Tiffany Studios, New York  Stained glass windows  = Henry E. Sharp windows = The original stained glass windows (including the Altar window) were installed in 1850 and are believed to have been designed by the Henry E. Sharp Studio in New York. Many of them have been replaced over the years, but several grisaille style windows remain. = Louis Comfort Tiffany windows = Starting in 1910, six of the original windows were replaced with memorial windows made by Tiffany Studio in New York. The large Tiffany windows in the north and south transepts are magnificent examples of the art form. The south transept window depicts three saints; Sebastian, Joseph (holding the infant Jesus), and Francis. It commemorates three members of the Lawrence family: father Joseph and his two sons, Francis and Sabastian. The north transept window shows the Holy Family and was donated in memory of Lyman Allyn. The wealth that made these and the other Tiffany windows possible was derived largely from the whaling trade. Mansfield Memorial Window by J&R; Lamb Studios = J&R; Lamb Studios window = The Mansfield Memorial Window was installed in 1922 by J&R; Lamb Studios and commemorates two friends who died during World War I. Nineteen-year-old Jack Morris Wright was killed while flying in France January 24, 1918. His friend, Richard Mansfield 2nd, also nineteen, enlisted after hearing of Jack's death, and died in an Army training camp a little over three months later on April 3, 1918. Richard was the son of famed actors Richard and Beatrice Mansfield. The window depicts the Archangel Michael unsheathing his sword behind two aviators. The lower window is inscribed with a quote from Isaiah 40.31: \\"They shall mount up with wings as eagles.\\" Jack Morris Wright's letters from France were published by his mother in \\"Poet of the Air\\". In Jack's letter to Richard on September 17, 1917, he said: Therefore, in urging you, I also am warning you; but once in the game, you'll find that usually death serves as a stimulant to the vitality of life and daring of flying. = Bishop Seabury window = Installed in 1962, this window depicts scenes from the life of the Rt. Rev. Samuel Seabury. The top panel contains seals of the Episcopal Church, the Diocese of Connecticut, and the two Scottish Diocese of Aberdeen, and Moray that provided Seabury's consecrators. Medallions picture Seabury's election at Glebe House in Woodbury, CT; his consecration as bishop by Scottish Bishops Robert Kilgour, John Skinner and Arthur Petrie in Aberdeen, Scotland, his first confirmation, a typical sailing vessel of the time, and the second St. James Church, in which he served as rector.  Organ  The church has an Ernest M. Skinner Organ, Opus 220, made in 1913.http://aeolian-skinner.110mb.com/ It was donated to the Parish by philanthropist and railroad magnate, Commodore Morton Plant, son of Henry B. Plant, in memory of his wife Nellie. The instrument has 43 ranks of pipes with four divisions and pedals, and contains 2680 pipes. Major tonal changes were made in 1952 and it was reconditioned in 2002. The modern console is mobile and is placed at the center of the choir for organ concerts. Silent film showings featuring live accompaniment on this organ are an annual event at St. James.  Mission and services  St. James is called to serve God, Christ, and the community of greater New London. Prayer and Eucharist services are offered throughout the week and pastoral services are available for occasions such as weddings and baptisms. Additionally, St. James provides Christian fellowship and outreach to its urban community, including a homeless shelter, a free community meal in rotation with other local churches, and The Jumble Shoppe which offers low cost clothing and household goods to its neighbors. St. James' music program is one of its core ministries. Artists in residence include The Anglican Singers and the Eastern Connecticut Children's Choir. St. James has a companion Parish relationship with St. Margaret's of Scotland, Aberdeen in the Diocese of Aberdeen and Orkney.

In order to assure a high level of pureness, the grains are sorted by hand and toasted. Subsequently, garlic, annatto and cumin are added to the assorted grains and eventually the mixture is ground. Eventually, the flour is sieved another time and packed. Application According to tradition, Uchu Jacu is exclusively being used to make a very nutritive soup; although the full traditional recipe requires adding potatoes, onion, hominy, eggs, cream cheese and guinea pig,. this version can be altered at will.

It was published by HarperCollins in 1990 and written by David Callahan.  Synopsis  Dangerous Capabilities offers a critical account of Nitze's role in debates within the United States government on policy toward the Soviet Union, nuclear weapons, and other national security issues. Nitze held a variety of high-level positions under eight different presidents, including Director of the State Department's Policy Planning Staff, Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, Secretary of the Navy, and Deputy Secretary of Defense. He also was a U.S. negotiator on the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) and Intermediate-Range Nuclear Force (INF) talks. Callahan faults Nitze for using his influence to accelerate the nuclear arms race and worsen relations with the Soviet Union. Callahan is particularly critical of Nitze's role in drafting NSC 68, an influential strategy document that Callahan says offered an inflated view of the Soviet threat unsupported by expert analysis of Soviet intentions. Callahan also faults Nitze for his central role in the 1958 Gaither Committee, which helped fuel erroneous fears of a \\"missile gap\\" that favored the Soviet Union. As well, Callahan provides a critical account of Nitze's role in Team-B, a competitive intelligence analysis to analyze threats posed by the Soviet Union, and his leadership in the Committee on the Present Danger, which warned of a Soviet edge in the Cold War competition. Callahan offers a more positive account of Nitze's years as an arms control negotiator, where he worked hard to reach agreements with the Soviet Union to regulate and stabilize the nuclear arms race. In addition, Callahan notes Nitze's positive role in enacting the Marshall Plan to aid Western Europe after World War II.  Reception  Dangerous Capabilities was published in September 1990 and widely reviewed. Larry Tool, writing in the San Francisco Chronicle said that \\"Dangerous Capabilities is not only the best book on Nitze, it is also one of the most searching and accessible accounts of American Cold War planning...The strength of Callahan's book is in its critical stance. He gives Nitze his due as a virtuoso bureaucrat, but confronts him at each stage of his career with the hard questions of his numerous critics.\\" Former Pentagon official Lawrence Korb, writing in the Naval War College Review, said \\"Judged by even the most rigorous standards, Callahan has produced a remarkable book. In Dangerous Capabilities, he has given us a sweeping, authoritative, and readable history of the men, the ideas, and politics which formed American national security policy for the last fifty years.\\" Joseph Nye, writing in the New York Times Book Review, called Dangerous Capabilities \\"An immensely readable account of a critical figure in the history of American foreign policy over the past 40 years.\\"  References   External links  * Dangerous Capabilities American biographies 1990 non-fiction books HarperCollins books ","title":"Dangerous Capabilities"},{"id":"30131157","text":"Singampatti is traditionally recognized as one of the 72 palaiyams of Tamil Nadu, India.

That same year, General Donald Campbell began a systematic campaign, taking the forts of the major confederates one by one, including Singampati. Anxious over Hyder Ali‚Äôs activities, however, Campbell settled the polegars‚Äô revenue accounts and restored them to their possessions in 1767. Post 1799 At the end of the First Polygar War in 1799, the polygar of Singampati surrendered one fort and 105 armed men to Major J. Bannerman. The palaiyam, which had been under the Company‚Äôs administration since 1798 , was restored to its former chief, Polygar Nellakotti Thevar(Nallakutti Thevar), in 1801, at the conclusion of the Second Polegar War; it survived into the 19th century as a zamindari.

VentureWell's early stage funding and training opportunities supported the creation of more than 180 new businesses across an array of industries, which have leveraged more than $620 million in additional funding. Origins In 1995, a group of higher education faculty and administrators gathered at Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts to discuss how universities might provide students with the tools they need to transform their ideas into viable businesses.Catherine Williams, Lemelson awards $16M to nonprofit inventors alliance, Mass High Tech, September 3, 2007. Jerome Lemelson, one of the U.S.‚Äôs most prolific inventors, convened the meeting.

The rift was formed by the same forces that created the rift system in South Sudan, and connects those rifts to the Lamu embayment further to the south. The separation of the other two arms of the junction allowed India-Madagascar to separate from Africa. The trough is now hidden by a cover of Quaternary sediments and volcanic rocks.

Centered on the junction of Connecticut Routes 66 and 85, it has served as the rural community's civic center since its incorporation in 1708. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Description and history The town of Hebron was incorporated in 1708, and has historically been agricultural for much of its history. Its town green, also the site of a colonial meeting house, was the only civic focal point of consequence in its early years, later augmented by a tavern, shop, and gristmill. The town green now survives only in fragmented portions on either side of Main Street (Route 66), owing to 20th-century highway widening and alignment. A series of fires in the 19th century wiped out virtually all of the village's 18th-century buildings, and only a handful of early 19th-century houses survive. and The historic district is centered at the junction of Routes 66 and 85, the former an early main road. It extends for a short distances in most directions, and a slightly longer distance eastward along Route 66, and includes a few houses on two side streets, Marjorie Circle and Wall Street. The district included 60 contributing buildings, the Hebron Green (Veterans Memorial Park), the remains of the site of the Hebron Town Pound, and the cemetery of St. Peter's Episcopal Church. Also included are 19 non-contributing buildings and six war memorials (non- contributing objects) on the surviving elements of the Hebron Green. In addition to many 19th-century houses, several churches and the town public library (Douglas Library) are also included in the district.

CCTS was established in 2007 by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, Canada's telecommunications and broadcasting regulator. All telecommunications service providers and all licensed television service providers must participate in the CCTS' complaint resolution process. In 2017‚Äì2018, the CCTS handled 14,272 complaints from consumers and resolved 92 per cent of these complaints. During this period, 41.5 per cent of complaints were related to wireless service, 29.2 for internet service, and 10.6 per cent for television service. The CCTS is accused of unfairness and there are many conflict of interest issues: 1- CCTS gets its direct funding by telecommunication companies and pays CCTS salaries, 2- CCTS has many employees that work also for the telecommunication companies and 3-Many of CCTS Board members are employees of these telecommunication companies References Telecommunications in Canada Media complaints authorities Consumer organizations in Canada Regulation in Canada ","title":"Commission for Complaints for Telecom-television Services"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:M}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},I={class:"card-container"};function H(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your bitcoinü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",I,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(t(),w(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const R=d(B,[["render",H]]),D=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/48.md","filePath":"sponsor/48.md"}'),L={name:"sponsor/48.md"},F=Object.assign(L,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{D as __pageData,F as default};
