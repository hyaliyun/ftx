Precordial impulses are visible or palpable pulsations of the chest wall, which originate on the heart or the great vessels.  Technique  A parasternal impulse may be felt when the heel of the hand is rested just to the left of the sternum with the fingers lifted slightly off the chest. Normally no impulse or a slight inward impulse is felt. The heel of the hand is lifted off the chest wall with each systole. Palpation with the fingers over the pulmonary area may reveal the palpable tap of pulmonary valve closure (palpable P2) in cases of pulmonary hypertension.  Interpretation  Parasternal heave occurs during right ventricular hypertrophy (i.e. enlargement) or very rarely severe left atrial enlargement.Clinical Examination: A Systematic Guide to Physical Diagnosis 5th Edition Nicholas Talley Simmon O' Connor This is due to the position of the heart within the chest: the right ventricle is most anterior (closest to the chest wall). Hypertrophy of the right side of the heart will occur when the right side of the heart chronically contracts against higher pressure. This occurs in the setting of valvular disease i.e. pulmonary valve, and in the setting of respiratory disease whereby the pressure in the pulmonary artery becomes elevated (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). An example of a condition where parasternal heave can be felt is cor pulmonale. This impulse may also be felt in dilated right ventricular myopathy. The palpation of dilated myopathy differs in that the impulse tends to be vigorous and brief. This is in contrast with the sustained impulse of the hypertrophied right ventricle. A parasternal heave may also be felt in mitral stenosis. A left ventricular heave (or lift) suggests the possibility of aortic stenosis.

Hodge and in favor of restoration of power to the people's committees that made up the People's Republic of Korea. The uprising also called as Daegu Riot or Daegu Resistance Movement. Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Korea chooses the neutral name of the Daegu October Incident. The uprising started on September 1946 in Busan and eventually spread to Seoul, Daegu, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Gyeongsangnam-do, Chungcheongnam-do, and Jeollanam-do and ended in mid-November. Further demands expressed during the uprising were for better working conditions, higher wages, the right to organize, and the release of political prisoners. On October 1, 1946, thousands of workers gathered the Daegu Station in order to protest against the U.S. They stoned the police and yelled out ‚ÄúKill the police!‚Äù In response to the raid, police shot and killed Hwang Mal-yong, a factory worker. On October 2, the leftists brought the four corpses of patients who had died from Cholera from Daegu medical university hospital, then they yelled the dead bodies were victimized by policemen at the Daegu station. The leftists quickly assembled laborers. Korean Communist Party rioters broke into 22 police stations and civil offices located in North Gyeongsang Province. According to the conditions the United States Military Government responded in different ways, including mobilizing strikebreakers, the police, right-wing youth groups, sending in U.S. troops and tanks, and declaring martial law, and succeeded in putting down the uprising. The uprising resulted in killing of 38 policemen, 163 civil workers, and 73 civilians. Some analysts say that the uprising, which was in part a reaction to the October elections for the South Korean Interim Legislative Assembly, organized by the United States Military Government, is a better indicator of public opinion than the election itself. The defeat of the uprising is considered to be a turning point in establishing political control over Korea as the people's committees and the National Council of Korean Labor Unions were weakened in the suppression. To the Americans, the Autumn Harvest Rebellion added new urgency to the effort to find some formula for unifying the two occupation zones of Korea under an elected government. In 2010, Truth and Reconciliation Commission presented its findings, there were 60 victims to whose families it suggested the government should provide compensation, and there were around 7,500 other people who suffered at the incident. Some victims were arrested and tortured, then police and extreme right wing groups damaged or confiscated their homes and property. The families of the victims had to endure the shame of being viewed as criminals.

On the evening of 30 December 1978, the freezer trawler Ben Asdale was off-loading fish into the hold of the Russian factory ship Antarktika (–ê–Ω—Ç–∞—Ä–∫—Ç–∏–∫–∞), which was anchored in Falmouth Bay. A force eight gale was blowing and heavy snow was falling. When the Ben Asdale had finished discharging her cargo of mackerel, she cast off her stern rope in preparation to move away from the anchored Antarktika. The rope fouled her rudder and she would not respond to her helm. The skipper, Barty (Albert) Coe from North Shields - latterly Chief Fishery Officer at Northumberland Sea Fisheries Committee to evolve into Northumberland Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority until his retirement on grounds of \\"ill health\\"), tried to get the Russians to re-secure the stern of his vessel but by now the fierce gale was dragging both boats. The Russians sent over two officers to assist in getting the steering working and shortly after the bow rope parted and the Ben Asdale was adrift. The skipper let go an anchor but it failed to hold, and as they were swept towards Maenporth beach, a Mayday was sent. With the wind now gusting force ten and the waves breaking over the trawler, she was out of control, and soon piled onto the rocks at the bottom of Newporth Head. As the boat struck the rocks, one of the crew jumped over the side, gravely injuring himself, and others threw out anything to act as life rafts. By now, word of the trawler's troubles had spread, and the three Billcliffe brothers, who had a hotel by the beach, rushed to the scene and waded into the surf and during that night dragged three of the crew to safety. Up on Newporth head, the Coastguard had arrived and was setting up a breeches buoy. With visibility almost at zero due to the blizzard, searchlights were rigged. As the breeches buoy was connected to the stricken trawler, she lurched and rolled onto her side, jamming all the gear. By now the rescue helicopter had arrived from RNAS Culdrose (HMS Seahawk) but could not see what was going on down on the hulk of the trawler because of the swirling blizzard. The Coastguard set up a radio link with the pilot, to guide the helicopter, which had to fly backwards over the wreck because of the winds and the nearness of the Headland. Over a period of about one and a half hours the helicopter lowered its winch eight times and successfully lifted off eight crewmen. Whilst all this was happening, three of the crew despaired and tried to swim to a shore that looked temptingly near. In the end eleven people were saved, but in spite of all the efforts of the emergency services and the Billicliffe brothers, three men (two Britons and a Russian) were drowned, their bodies washed up the next day on Maenporth Beach. The crew of the helicopter were awarded two Air Force Crosses and three Queen's Commendations for one of the most dangerous rescues of modern times.Sources for the Ben Asdale story: submerged.co.uk has many points in common with the text in this article but date of wreck given as 1979, not 1978. and Smallholder, Thursday 11 Dec 2003 an account by one of the coastguards, correcting the date.Google Earth Aerial view of wreck.

In order to find out more about Locke's paralysis, Jack visits dentist Dr. Bernard Nadler (Sam Anderson) and asks for the dental records from an emergency oral surgery performed on Locke about three years previously. Bernard refuses to breach confidentiality, but tells him that a man named Anthony Cooper (Kevin Tighe) was brought in along with Locke three years ago. Jack goes to a nursing home and visits Anthony Cooper, who is Locke's father in a vegetative state. Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) arrives at the hospital to see Jack. She shows Jack a music box that their father (John Terry) said he especially wanted her to have. Jack then invites Claire to come and stay at his house, stating to Claire that they are not strangers, but rather family. As Locke is preparing to leave the hospital, Jack approaches him and tells him that he went to see Locke's father so that he could find out why he doesn't want the surgery. Locke reveals to Jack that the accident that made him paralyzed was a plane crash; he had just qualified for his pilot's license and his father was his first passenger. Jack tells Locke his father is \\"gone\\" and that punishing himself won't bring him back. Locke still refuses Jack's offer and leaves. =2007 (original timeline)= Following the events of \\"The Last Recruit\\", Jack awakens on Hydra Island with Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) by his side. The Man in Black arrives and tells them that James \\"Sawyer\\" Ford (Josh Holloway), Claire Littleton, Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey), Hugo Reyes (Jorge Garcia), Sun Kwon (Yunjin Kim) and Jin Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) have been taken prisoner by Charles Widmore (Alan Dale). The Man in Black plans to help them escape, run for the Ajira plane and leave the island before Widmore knows what is happening. While Jack agrees to help, he insists that he himself will not leave the island. At Hydra Station, Widmore has Sawyer's group thrown inside the animal cages. Sayid turns off the camp's generator, bringing down the sonar fences which had been keeping the Man in Black at bay. The Man in Black then attacks as the Smoke monster, allowing Jack to free Sawyer's group. After reuniting with Sayid, they head into the jungle to find the Ajira plane. The Man in Black arrives at the plane site before the group, and inspects the interior of the plane after killing Widmore's guards. The Man in Black reveals to the group that Widmore has rigged the plane with C4. Unable to take the risk of using the plane, the Man in Black decides to escape using Widmore's submarine. As they head to the docks, Sawyer asks Jack to stop the Man in Black from getting on board the sub. At the docks, the survivors manage to board the submarine while Widmore's men attack from the jungle. Kate is shot during the ensuing gun fight, but Jack manages to get her on board after pushing the Man in Black into the water. He gets back out of the water and begins to shoot down the last of Widmore's men. In order to prevent the Man in Black from entering, Sawyer has the sub take off without Claire. On the sub, Jack discovers the Man in Black has planted the C4 in his bag and has set a timer to detonate. Unable to reach the surface in time, Sayid attempts to defuse the bomb. However, Jack tells Sawyer to let the timer reach zero, believing that nothing will happen to them because the Man in Black is unable to kill them himself. Jack theorizes that the Man in Black united the candidates because he needed them all dead in order to leave the island, and has come up with a plan that will trick them into killing one another by mistrusting each other. Sawyer is unconvinced and pulls the bomb's wires, causing the speed of the bomb's countdown to accelerate. Sayid tells Jack where to find Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) and runs to the back of the sub with the bomb. The bomb detonates, killing Sayid and causing a massive explosion that proceeds to flood the sub. Frank is knocked out by a door as it gives way to the water. Sun is pinned down by fragments of the submarine. Hurley exits the sub with a wounded Kate, while Jin, Sawyer, and Jack try to help Sun. After Sawyer is knocked unconscious, Jin convinces Jack to leave with Sawyer. Jin continues to try to free Sun despite her pleas for him to go, but to no avail. He tells Sun that he won't leave her. They then embrace as water floods the submarine, drowning them while holding hands. Jack, Sawyer, Kate, and Hurley regroup at a nearby beach, and mourn those who died. Meanwhile, at the docks, the Man in Black tells Claire that the sub has sunk and there are survivors. He then departs to \\"finish what [he] started.\\" Production The episode features the deaths of at least 3 main cast members,The episode leaves it unclear whether or not a fourth main cast member, Frank, is also dead. the highest of any episode in the series. Showrunners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse described the episode as \\"brutal\\". Regarding the mass deaths of the characters, Lindelof stated \\"now you know this show is willing and capable of killing anyone.\\" Cuse also added \\"There is no ambiguity. [The Man In Black] is evil and he has to be stopped... When we watched the death scenes ourselves, it was brutal. [But] the story always comes first.\\" Reception The episode received critical acclaim. Review aggregate website Metacritic gave the episode a score of 92 out of 100, indicating \\"Universal Acclaim\\". The score was up on the previous episode's score of 73. Maureen Ryan of Chicago Tribune gave a perfect score, stating \\"Not only were the island events compelling, they neatly tied into the Sideways themes of trust and penance.\\"Ryan, Maureen (May 5, 2010), \\"Let's Talk Lost: 'The Candidate'\\", Chicago Tribune.

IGN's Chris Carbot praised the episode as well, saying \\"the story continues to deliver thrilling moments.\\" However, he criticized the pacing of the flash-sideways storyline, describing it as \\"moving at a snails pace when compared to events occurring on the island.\\" Overall, he gave the episode a score of 9.2. Emily VanDerWerff of Los Angeles Times deemed the episode as \\"one of the greatest episodes of the show ever for pure adrenaline rush, right up there with Through the Looking Glass and Exodus, Parts 1 and 2.\\" Many critics expressed shock regarding the deaths of the characters. Alan Sepinwall of Star Ledger thought the episode \\"drastically accelerated the pace of the unhappy endings.\\" Chris Carbot stated \\"Sayid's death was a fitting end to his story. He had been on course to redeem himself ever since switching over to Team Smokie and was thankfully given the opportunity to go out in grand fashion ... Jin and Sun's demise came as a total shock.

A stationary field is one that is in a steady state, but the masses causing that field may be non-static ‚Å†‚Äî rotating, for instance. More generally, the subject that deals with the effects caused by mass‚Äìenergy currents is known as gravitomagnetism, which is analogous to the magnetism of classical electromagnetism. The first frame-dragging effect was derived in 1918, in the framework of general relativity, by the Austrian physicists Josef Lense and Hans Thirring, and is also known as the Lense‚ÄìThirring effect. [On the Effect of Rotating Distant Masses in Einstein's Theory of Gravitation] [Correction to my paper \\"On the Effect of Rotating Distant Masses in Einstein's Theory of Gravitation\\"] [On the Influence of the Proper Rotation of Central Bodies on the Motions of Planets and Moons According to Einstein's Theory of Gravitation] They predicted that the rotation of a massive object would distort the spacetime metric, making the orbit of a nearby test particle precess. This does not happen in Newtonian mechanics for which the gravitational field of a body depends only on its mass, not on its rotation. The Lense‚ÄìThirring effect is very small ‚Äì about one part in a few trillion. To detect it, it is necessary to examine a very massive object, or build an instrument that is very sensitive. In 2015, new general-relativistic extensions of Newtonian rotation laws were formulated to describe geometric dragging of frames which incorporates a newly discovered antidragging effect. Effects Rotational frame-dragging (the Lense‚ÄìThirring effect) appears in the general principle of relativity and similar theories in the vicinity of rotating massive objects. Under the Lense‚ÄìThirring effect, the frame of reference in which a clock ticks the fastest is one which is revolving around the object as viewed by a distant observer. This also means that light traveling in the direction of rotation of the object will move past the massive object faster than light moving against the rotation, as seen by a distant observer. It is now the best known frame-dragging effect, partly thanks to the Gravity Probe B experiment. Qualitatively, frame-dragging can be viewed as the gravitational analog of electromagnetic induction. Also, an inner region is dragged more than an outer region. This produces interesting locally rotating frames. For example, imagine that a north‚Äìsouth-oriented ice skater, in orbit over the equator of a rotating black hole and rotationally at rest with respect to the stars, extends her arms. The arm extended toward the black hole will be \\"torqued\\" spinward due to gravitomagnetic induction (\\"torqued\\" is in quotes because gravitational effects are not considered \\"forces\\" under GR). Likewise the arm extended away from the black hole will be torqued anti-spinward. She will therefore be rotationally sped up, in a counter-rotating sense to the black hole. This is the opposite of what happens in everyday experience. There exists a particular rotation rate that, should she be initially rotating at that rate when she extends her arms, inertial effects and frame-dragging effects will balance and her rate of rotation will not change. Due to the equivalence principle, gravitational effects are locally indistinguishable from inertial effects, so this rotation rate, at which when she extends her arms nothing happens, is her local reference for non-rotation. This frame is rotating with respect to the fixed stars and counter-rotating with respect to the black hole. This effect is analogous to the hyperfine structure in atomic spectra due to nuclear spin. A useful metaphor is a planetary gear system with the black hole being the sun gear, the ice skater being a planetary gear and the outside universe being the ring gear. See Mach's principle. Another interesting consequence is that, for an object constrained in an equatorial orbit, but not in freefall, it weighs more if orbiting anti-spinward, and less if orbiting spinward. For example, in a suspended equatorial bowling alley, a bowling ball rolled anti-spinward would weigh more than the same ball rolled in a spinward direction. Note, frame dragging will neither accelerate nor slow down the bowling ball in either direction. It is not a \\"viscosity\\". Similarly, a stationary plumb-bob suspended over the rotating object will not list. It will hang vertically. If it starts to fall, induction will push it in the spinward direction. Linear frame dragging is the similarly inevitable result of the general principle of relativity, applied to linear momentum. Although it arguably has equal theoretical legitimacy to the \\"rotational\\" effect, the difficulty of obtaining an experimental verification of the effect means that it receives much less discussion and is often omitted from articles on frame-dragging (but see Einstein, 1921).Einstein, A The Meaning of Relativity (contains transcripts of his 1921 Princeton lectures). Static mass increase is a third effect noted by Einstein in the same paper. The effect is an increase in inertia of a body when other masses are placed nearby. While not strictly a frame dragging effect (the term frame dragging is not used by Einstein), it is demonstrated by Einstein that it derives from the same equation of general relativity. It is also a tiny effect that is difficult to confirm experimentally. Experimental tests In 1976 Van Patten and Everitt proposed to implement a dedicated mission aimed to measure the Lense‚ÄìThirring node precession of a pair of counter-orbiting spacecraft to be placed in terrestrial polar orbits with drag-free apparatus. A somewhat equivalent, cheaper version of such an idea was put forth in 1986 by Ciufolini who proposed to launch a passive, geodetic satellite in an orbit identical to that of the LAGEOS satellite, launched in 1976, apart from the orbital planes which should have been displaced by 180 deg apart: the so-called butterfly configuration. The measurable quantity was, in this case, the sum of the nodes of LAGEOS and of the new spacecraft, later named LAGEOS III, LARES, WEBER-SAT. Limiting the scope to the scenarios involving existing orbiting bodies, the first proposal to use the LAGEOS satellite and the Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) technique to measure the Lense‚ÄìThirring effect dates back to 1977‚Äì1978. Tests have started to be effectively performed by using the LAGEOS and LAGEOS II satellites in 1996, according to a strategy involving the use of a suitable combination of the nodes of both satellites and the perigee of LAGEOS II. The latest tests with the LAGEOS satellites have been performed in 2004‚Äì2006 by discarding the perigee of LAGEOS II and using a linear combination. Recently, a comprehensive overview of the attempts to measure the Lense-Thirring effect with artificial satellites was published in the literature. The overall accuracy reached in the tests with the LAGEOS satellites is subject to some controversy. The Gravity Probe B experimentEveritt, C. W. F, The Gyroscope Experiment I.

In 2008 the Senior Review Report of the NASA Astrophysics Division Operating Missions stated that it was unlikely that Gravity Probe B team will be able to reduce the errors to the level necessary to produce a convincing test of currently untested aspects of General Relativity (including frame- dragging). Report of the 2008 Senior Review of the Astrophysics Division Operating Missions, NASAGravity Probe B scores 'F' in NASA review, Jeff Hecht, New Scientist ‚Äì Space, May 20, 2008 On May 4, 2011, the Stanford-based analysis group and NASA announced the final report, and in it the data from GP-B demonstrated the frame-dragging effect with an error of about 19 percent, and Einstein's predicted value was at the center of the confidence interval. NASA published claims of success in verification of frame dragging for the two programs Grace (LAGEOS) and Gravity Probe B, both of which claims are still in public view. A research group in Italy, USA, and UK also claimed success in verification of frame dragging with the Grace gravity model, published in a peer reviewed journal. All the claims include recommendations for further research at greater accuracy and other gravity models. In the case of stars orbiting close to a spinning, supermassive black hole, frame dragging should cause the star's orbital plane to precess about the black hole spin axis. This effect should be detectable within the next few years via astrometric monitoring of stars at the center of the Milky Way galaxy. By comparing the rate of orbital precession of two stars on different orbits, it is possible in principle to test the no-hair theorems of general relativity, in addition to measuring the spin of the black hole. Astronomical evidence AGN where the relativistic plasma is collimated into jets which escape along the pole of the supermassive black hole Relativistic jets may provide evidence for the reality of frame-dragging. Gravitomagnetic forces produced by the Lense‚ÄìThirring effect (frame dragging) within the ergosphere of rotating black holes combined with the energy extraction mechanism by Penrose have been used to explain the observed properties of relativistic jets. The gravitomagnetic model developed by Reva Kay Williams predicts the observed high energy particles (~GeV) emitted by quasars and active galactic nuclei; the extraction of X-rays, Œ≥-rays, and relativistic e‚àí‚Äìe+ pairs; the collimated jets about the polar axis; and the asymmetrical formation of jets (relative to the orbital plane). The Lense‚ÄìThirring effect has been observed in a binary system that consists of a massive white dwarf and a pulsar. Mathematical derivation Frame-dragging may be illustrated most readily using the Kerr metric, which describes the geometry of spacetime in the vicinity of a mass M rotating with angular momentum J, and Boyer‚ÄìLindquist coordinates (see the link for the transformation): :\\\\begin{align} c^{2} d\\\\tau^{2} =& \\\\left( 1 - \\\\frac{r_{s} r}{\\\\rho^{2}} \\\\right) c^{2} dt^{2} \\\\- \\\\frac{\\\\rho^{2}}{\\\\Lambda^{2}} dr^{2} \\\\- \\\\rho^{2} d\\\\theta^{2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ & {} - \\\\left( r^{2} + \\\\alpha^{2} + \\\\frac{r_{s} r \\\\alpha^{2}}{\\\\rho^{2}} \\\\sin^{2} \\\\theta \\\\right) \\\\sin^{2} \\\\theta \\\\ d\\\\phi^{2} \\\\+ \\\\frac{2r_{s} r\\\\alpha c \\\\sin^{2} \\\\theta }{\\\\rho^{2}} d\\\\phi dt \\\\end{align} where rs is the Schwarzschild radius : r_{s} = \\\\frac{2GM}{c^{2}} and where the following shorthand variables have been introduced for brevity : \\\\alpha = \\\\frac{J}{Mc} : \\\\rho^{2} = r^{2} + \\\\alpha^{2} \\\\cos^{2} \\\\theta\\\\,\\\\\\\\! : \\\\Lambda^{2} = r^{2} - r_{s} r + \\\\alpha^{2}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! In the non-relativistic limit where M (or, equivalently, rs) goes to zero, the Kerr metric becomes the orthogonal metric for the oblate spheroidal coordinates : c^{2} d\\\\tau^{2} = c^{2} dt^{2} \\\\- \\\\frac{\\\\rho^{2}}{r^{2} + \\\\alpha^{2}} dr^{2} \\\\- \\\\rho^{2} d\\\\theta^{2} \\\\- \\\\left( r^{2} + \\\\alpha^{2} \\\\right) \\\\sin^{2}\\\\theta d\\\\phi^{2} We may rewrite the Kerr metric in the following form : c^{2} d\\\\tau^{2} = \\\\left( g_{tt} - \\\\frac{g_{t\\\\phi}^{2}}{g_{\\\\phi\\\\phi}} \\\\right) dt^{2} \\\\+ g_{rr} dr^{2} + g_{\\\\theta\\\\theta} d\\\\theta^{2} + g_{\\\\phi\\\\phi} \\\\left( d\\\\phi + \\\\frac{g_{t\\\\phi}}{g_{\\\\phi\\\\phi}} dt \\\\right)^{2} This metric is equivalent to a co-rotating reference frame that is rotating with angular speed Œ© that depends on both the radius r and the colatitude Œ∏ : \\\\Omega = -\\\\frac{g_{t\\\\phi}}{g_{\\\\phi\\\\phi}} = \\\\frac{r_{s} \\\\alpha r c}{\\\\rho^{2} \\\\left( r^{2} + \\\\alpha^{2} \\\\right) + r_{s} \\\\alpha^{2} r \\\\sin^{2}\\\\theta} In the plane of the equator this simplifies to: : \\\\Omega = \\\\frac{r_{s} \\\\alpha c}{r^{3} + \\\\alpha^{2} r + r_{s} \\\\alpha^{2}} Thus, an inertial reference frame is entrained by the rotating central mass to participate in the latter's rotation; this is frame-dragging. The two surfaces on which the Kerr metric appears to have singularities; the inner surface is the oblate spheroid-shaped event horizon, whereas the outer surface is pumpkin-shaped.Blundell, Katherine Black Holes: A Very Short Introduction Google books, page 31 The ergosphere lies between these two surfaces; within this volume, the purely temporal component gtt is negative, i.e., acts like a purely spatial metric component. Consequently, particles within this ergosphere must co-rotate with the inner mass, if they are to retain their time-like character. An extreme version of frame dragging occurs within the ergosphere of a rotating black hole. The Kerr metric has two surfaces on which it appears to be singular. The inner surface corresponds to a spherical event horizon similar to that observed in the Schwarzschild metric; this occurs at : r_\\\\text{inner} = \\\\frac{r_{s} + \\\\sqrt{r_{s}^{2} - 4\\\\alpha^{2}}}{2} where the purely radial component grr of the metric goes to infinity. The outer surface can be approximated by an oblate spheroid with lower spin parameters, and resembles a pumpkin-shape with higher spin parameters. It touches the inner surface at the poles of the rotation axis, where the colatitude Œ∏ equals 0 or œÄ; its radius in Boyer- Lindquist coordinates is defined by the formula : r_\\\\text{outer} = \\\\frac{r_{s} + \\\\sqrt{r_{s}^{2} - 4\\\\alpha^{2} \\\\cos^{2}\\\\theta}}{2} where the purely temporal component gtt of the metric changes sign from positive to negative. The space between these two surfaces is called the ergosphere. A moving particle experiences a positive proper time along its worldline, its path through spacetime. However, this is impossible within the ergosphere, where gtt is negative, unless the particle is co-rotating with the interior mass M with an angular speed at least of Œ©. However, as seen above, frame-dragging occurs about every rotating mass and at every radius r and colatitude Œ∏, not only within the ergosphere. =Lense‚ÄìThirring effect inside a rotating shell= The Lense‚ÄìThirring effect inside a rotating shell was taken by Albert Einstein as not just support for, but a vindication of Mach's principle, in a letter he wrote to Ernst Mach in 1913 (five years before Lense and Thirring's work, and two years before he had attained the final form of general relativity). A reproduction of the letter can be found in Misner, Thorne, Wheeler.Misner, Thorne, Wheeler, Gravitation, Figure 21.5, page 544 The general effect scaled up to cosmological distances, is still used as a support for Mach's principle. Inside a rotating spherical shell the acceleration due to the Lense‚ÄìThirring effect would be : \\\\bar{a} = -2d_1 \\\\left( \\\\bar{ \\\\omega} \\\\times \\\\bar v \\\\right) - d_2 \\\\left[ \\\\bar{ \\\\omega} \\\\times \\\\left( \\\\bar{ \\\\omega} \\\\times \\\\bar{r} \\\\right) + 2\\\\left( \\\\bar{ \\\\omega}\\\\bar{r} \\\\right) \\\\bar{ \\\\omega} \\\\right] where the coefficients are :\\\\begin{align} d_1 &= \\\\frac{4MG}{3Rc^2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ d_2 &= \\\\frac{4MG}{15Rc^2} \\\\end{align} for MG ‚â™ Rc2 or more precisely, : d_1 = \\\\frac{4 \\\\alpha(2 - \\\\alpha)}{(1 + \\\\alpha)(3- \\\\alpha)}, \\\\qquad \\\\alpha=\\\\frac{MG}{2Rc^2} The spacetime inside the rotating spherical shell will not be flat. A flat spacetime inside a rotating mass shell is possible if the shell is allowed to deviate from a precisely spherical shape and the mass density inside the shell is allowed to vary.

He appeared in concerts and recitals throughout Canada and performed numerous times on Canadian television and radio. He wrote music for a number of programs for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and worked as a composer, arranger, and music director for numerous recordings by a variety of Canadian artists. Starting in 1987 he performed regularly in concerts and recitals as the accompanist for opera singer Joseph Rouleau. Life and career Brabant was born in Montreal, Quebec, he began his studies in piano as a child and gave his first public recital while a teenager. In 1942 he appeared on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation program Young Artists of Tomorrow. The following year he was awarded first prize in the CBC radio competition Les Talents de chez-nous. From 1942-1943 he was a piano student of Raymond David and Joseph-√âlie Savaria. In 1947-1948 Brabant took a sojourn in Paris, after which he embarked on a Canadian recital tour; giving a total of 78 recitals. He notably included some of his own compositions in his recital program, including Sonatine en do, Caprice laurentien, Cinq Cantil√®nes and Cinq √âglogues. In his review of Brabant's 1948 recital at Plateau Hall in Montreal Jean Vallerand wrote, \\"Pierre Brabant is a splendid pianist and a fine artist. He also is a very intelligent, sensitive composer, with a solid technique and something to say.\\"Jean Vallerand. Le Devoir, 20 Nov 1952. In 1949 Brabant studied the organ with Marcel Dupr√© in Paris. That same year his ballet La Gasp√©sienne, which was choreographed by Ruth Sorel, premiered in Montreal. The ballet was given performances in Toronto, New York City, and at the Great Theatre, Warsaw in 1950. He entered the Conservatoire de musique du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al in 1951 where he studied for two years. In 1954 he appeared as a soloist on several CBC Television programs, including L'Heure du concert. In 1957 he pursued studies in the organ with Eug√®ne Lapierre. In the early 1960s Brabant developed an interest in expanding his compositional repertoire into the pop music genre. One of his earliest forays into this area was the music for Jean-Pierre Ferland's program Feuilles de gui, which was awarded prizes in 1962 from the CBC and in Brussels. Several soundtracks for CBC children's programs followed, including Tour de terre, Au clair de soleil, and Soleil et jours de pluie. He also composed music for a number of albums for children, including 20 Contes pour enfants par Tante Lucille for RCA. He also recorded the theme song and played the background music for the popular TV series Rue des Pignons from 1967‚Äì1978, and composed music for the TV show La Semaine verte. Brabant served as music director and arranger for several recordings during the 1960s through the 1980s, including ones by Jean-Paul Filion, Herv√© Brousseau, Georges Dor and F√©lix Leclerc. In 1987 he began working regularly with bass Joseph Rouleau as an accompanist. Many of their recitals together have been devoted to Leclerc's music.

By 1950 indigenous forms of British popular music, including folk music, brass and silver bands, music hall and dance bands, were already giving way to the influence of American forms of music including jazz, swing and traditional pop, mediated through film and records. The significant change of the mid-1950s was the impact of American rock and roll, which provided a new model for performance and recording, based on a youth market. Initially this was dominated by American acts, or re-creations of American forms of music, but soon distinctly British forms began to appear, first in the uniquely British take on American folk music in the skiffle craze of the 1950s with artists such as Lonnie Donegan, then in the beginnings of a folk revival that came to place an emphasis on national traditions and then in early attempts to produce British rock and roll such as Cliff Richard & the Shadows' Move It, often cited at the first British rock and roll record. Jazz John Dankworth on stage in 2002 Jazz reached Britain from America through recordings and performers who visited the country while it was a relatively new genre, soon after the end of the First World War. Jazz began to be played by British musicians from the 1930s and on a widespread basis in the 1940s, often within dance bands. From the late 1950s British \\"modern jazz\\", highly influenced by American bebop, began to emerge, led by figures such as John Dankworth and Ronnie Scott, while Ken Colyer, George Webb and Humphrey Lyttelton emphasised New Orleans, trad jazz.W. Kaufman, H. Slettedahl Macpherson, Britain and the Americas: culture, politics and history (ABC-CLIO, 2005), pp. 504‚Äì5. Scott's Soho club became a focal point of British jazz, seeing the best of British and international acts. From the 1960s British Jazz began to develop more individual characteristics, absorbing a variety of influences, including free jazz, British blues, as well as European and world music. Traditional pop In the early 1950s sales of American records dominated British popular music. In the first full year of the charts in 1953 major artists were Perry Como, Guy Mitchell and Frankie Laine largely with orchestrated sentimental ballads, beside novelty records such as \\"(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?\\" re-recorded by British artist Lita Roza.P. Gambaccini, T. Rice and J. Rice, British Hit Singles (6th edn., 1985), pp. 331‚Äì2. Some established British wartime stars such as Vera Lynn were still able to chart into the mid-1950s, but successful new British acts such as Jimmy Young who had two number one hits in 1955, did so with re-recorded versions of American songs \\"Unchained Melody\\" and \\"The Man from Laramie\\" or Alma Cogan with \\"Dreamboat\\". Many successful songs were the product of films, including number ones for Doris Day in 1954 with \\"Secret Love\\" from Calamity Jane and for Frank Sinatra with the title song from Three Coins in the Fountain, underlining the dominance of American culture in both film and music at this time, and arguably providing a mechanism for the transference of rock and roll. Skiffle Skiffle is a type of folk music with jazz, blues and country influences, usually using homemade or improvised instruments, which had originated as a term in the United States in the first half of the 20th century. It became popular again in Britain in the 1950s, where it was associated with musician Lonnie Donegan, whose high-tempo version of Leadbelly's \\"Rock Island Line\\" was a major hit in 1956, spending eight months in the Top 20, peaking at No. 6 (and No. 8 in the U.S.). It was the first d√©but record to go gold in Britain, selling over a million copies worldwide.M. Brocken, The British Folk Revival, 1944‚Äì2002 (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2003), pp. 69‚Äì80. The resulting short-lived skiffle craze led to a profusion of British performers and played a major part in beginning the careers of later eminent jazz, pop, blues, folk and rock musicians, including early British rock performers Tommy Steele, the Shadows and the Beatles.J. Roberts, The Beatles (Lerner Publications, 2001), p. 13. Folk music and roots revival Bert Jansch performing in 2006 The second British folk revival followed a similar American folk music revival, to which it was connected by individuals such as Alan Lomax, who had moved to Britain in the era of McCarthyism and who worked in England and Scotland.M. Brocken, The British Folk Revival, 1944‚Äì2002 (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2003), pp. 103, 112‚Äì4 and 132. Like the American revival, it was often overtly left wing in its politics and the leading figures, Ewan MacColl and A. L. Lloyd, were both involved in trade unionism and socialist politics. In Scotland the key figures were Hamish Henderson and Calum McLean who collected songs and popularised acts including Jeannie Robertson, John Strachan, Flora Macneill and Jimmy MacBeath.C. MacDougall, Scots: The Language of the People (Black & White, 2006), p. 246. In Wales the key figure was Dafydd Iwan, who founded the Sain record label in 1969.S. Hill, Blerwytirhwng?: the Place of Welsh Pop Music (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007), pp. 59‚Äì60. The revival began to gain momentum in the 1950s with the establishment of a network of folk clubs, such as the Blues and Ballads Club in London in 1953 and a number of festivals, such as that at Sidmouth from 1955. British rock and roll The emergence of American rock and roll as a major international force in popular music in the mid-1950s led to its emulation in Britain, which shared a common language and many cultural connections.R. Unterberger, \\"British Rock & Roll Before the Beatles\\", All Music Guides, retrieved 24 June 2009. The British product has generally been considered inferior to the American version of the genre, and made very little international or lasting impact. However, it was important in establishing British youth and popular music culture and was a key factor in subsequent developments that led to the 'British Invasion' of the mid-1960s. Since the 1960s some stars of the genre, most notably Cliff Richard, have managed to sustain very successful careers and there have been periodic revivals of this form of music.

It hangs in the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, Merseyside, England. Rossetti had a lifelong interest in the Italian poet Dante Alighieri. The painting was inspired by Dante's poem La Vita Nuova. In this poem Dante dreams that he is led to the death-bed of Beatrice Portinari, who was the object of his unfulfilled love. Dante, in black, stands looking towards the dying Beatrice who is lying on a bed. Two female figures in green hold a canopy over her. An angel in red holds Dante's hand and leans forward to kiss Beatrice. In the painting, Rossetti creates a visionary world with complex symbols. The symbols include the green clothes of Beatrice's attendants, signifying hope; spring flowers in the foreground symbolising purity; and red doves for love. It is Rossetti's largest painting. The model for Beatrice was Jane Morris, the wife of William Morris. Annie Miller, who is thought to have been one of Rossetti's mistresses, posed as a grieving hand maiden. The Walker Art Gallery bought the painting directly from the artist in 1881 for ¬£1575 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). The acquisition was negotiated by Victorian novelist Hall Caine. In 1897 it was sent to Berlin to be photographed, but was then noted to be \\"in a dirty condition\\". Again in 1904 the painting was noted to be in \\"a bad condition\\" and it was considered that its condition had been worsened by its journey to and from Berlin. The painting was sent in 1908 to the National Gallery in London to be relined, that is, for a new canvas to be glued to the original. It was then returned to Liverpool. During the Second World War, it was removed from its stretcher, rolled and stored in the basement of the gallery. In 1941 the painting was moved, together with other large paintings from the gallery, to Ellesmere College in Shropshire. It was noted at this time that it had sustained some damage. Conservation work was carried out on the painting in 1960 and in 1985. Dante's Dream is a painting in oil on canvas, measuring by . It was examined in 2003 and found to be in good condition, with no evidence of any recurrence of the former problems.

In the remaining one third of the mine, the frass becomes sparse and is arranged in a line, which is narrower than the preceding in most mines. In a few mines, the frass is very thin and linear throughout its length.

By the early 1960s the British had developed a viable national music industry and began to produce adapted forms of American music in Beat music and British blues which would be re-exported to America by bands such as The Beatles, The Animals and Rolling Stones. This helped to make the dominant forms of popular music something of a shared Anglo-American creation, and led to the growing distinction between pop and rock music, which began to develop into diverse and creative subgenres that would characterise the form throughout the rest of the twentieth century. Rock music =Beat music= The arrival of The Beatles in the U.S., and subsequent appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, marked the start of the British Invasion. They had 20 #1 Billboard Hot 100 hits. In the late 1950s, a flourishing culture of groups began to emerge, often out of the declining skiffle scene, in major urban centres in the UK like Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham and London. This was particularly true in Liverpool, where it has been estimated that there were around 350 different bands active, often playing ballrooms, concert halls and clubs.Mersey Beat ‚Äì the founders' story. Beat bands were heavily influenced by American bands of the era, such as Buddy Holly and the Crickets (from which group The Beatles derived their name), as well as earlier British groups such as The Shadows.W. Everett, The Beatles as musicians: the Quarry Men through Rubber Soul (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), pp. 37‚Äì8. After the national success of the Beatles in Britain from 1962, a number of Liverpool performers were able to follow them into the charts, including Gerry & The Pacemakers, The Searchers, and Cilla Black. Among the most successful beat acts from Birmingham were The Spencer Davis Group and The Moody Blues. From London, the term Tottenham Sound was largely based around The Dave Clark Five, but other London bands that benefited from the beat boom of this era included the Rolling Stones and The Yardbirds. The first non-Liverpool, non-Brian Epstein-managed band to break through in the UK were Freddie and the Dreamers, who were based in Manchester,Daily Telegraph \\"'Dreamers' star Freddie Garrity dies\\", 20 May 2006, accessed August 2007. as were Herman's Hermits and The Hollies.V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra, and S. T. Erlewine, All music guide to rock: the definitive guide to rock, pop, and soul (Backbeat Books, 2002), p. 532. The beat movement provided most of the bands responsible for the British Invasion of the American pop charts in the period after 1964, and furnished the model for many important developments in pop and rock music. =British Invasion= The Rolling Stones in 1975 The British Invasion is a term used mainly in the United States to describe the large number of rock and roll, beat and pop performers from the United Kingdom who became popular in the U.S. from 1964 to 1966. Show 27. After first running a story on 10 December 1963, CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite on 7 February 1964 ran a story about The Beatles' United States arrival in which the correspondent said \\"The British Invasion this time goes by the code name Beatlemania\\".http://kiss951.cbslocal.com/2013/06/03/a-timeline-of-the-british- invasion-waves/ A few days later they appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show. Seventy five percent of Americans watching television that night viewed their appearance thus \\"launching\\" the invasion with a massive wave of chart success that would continue until they broke up in 1970. On 4 April 1964, the Beatles held the top five positions on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, the only time to date that any act has accomplished this feat.UK acts disappear from US charts BBC 23 April 2002 The Dave Clark 5 followed the Beatles the very next week on the Ed Sullivan show, and appeared on the Sullivan show more than any other British band, 18 times. During the next two years, The Dave Clark 5, The Animals, Petula Clark, Manfred Mann, Peter and Gordon, Freddie and the Dreamers, Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders, Herman's Hermits, The Rolling Stones (had 8 #1 Billboard Hot 100 hits in the 60s and 70s), The Troggs, and Donovan would have one or more number one singles.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Article Other acts that were part of the invasion included The Who, and The Kinks.When the Beatles hit America CNN 10 February 2004. British Invasion acts influenced fashion, haircuts and manners of the 1960s of what was to be known as The Counterculture. In particular the Beatles movie A Hard Day's Night and fashions from Carnaby Street led American media to proclaim England as the centre of the music and fashion world. The success of British acts of the time caused American garage rock bands subsequently to change their sound and style. The influence continued on subsequent groups such as Big Star, Sparks and Todd Rundgren amongst others.Todd Rundgren Bio, Musicianguide.com, retrieved 5 November 2007 The emergence of relatively homogeneous worldwide rock music styles about 1967 marked the end of the \\"invasion\\". =British blues boom= Eric Clapton in 1974 In parallel with Beat music, in the late 1950s and early 1960s a British blues scene was developing recreating the sounds of American R&B; and later particularly the sounds of bluesmen Robert Johnson, Howling Wolf and Muddy Waters. It reached its height of mainstream popularity in the 1960s, when it developed a distinctive and influential style dominated by electric guitar and made international stars of several proponents of the genre including the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Cream (featuring Eric Clapton), the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds, Fleetwood Mac and Led Zeppelin. A number of these moved through blues-rock to different forms of rock music and as a result British blues helped to form many of the subgenres of rock, including psychedelic rock and heavy metal music. Since then direct interest in the blues in Britain has declined, but many of the key performers have returned to it in recent years, new acts have emerged and there have been a renewed interest in the genre.V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra, S. T. Erlewine, eds, All Music Guide to the Blues: The Definitive Guide to the Blues (Backbeat, 3rd edn., 2003), p. 700. =Folk rock= British folk musicians of the early 60s were heavily influenced by American revival artists like Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger and later Bob Dylan and Joan Baez. This led indirectly to the subgenre of British progressive folk music, pioneered by performers like the Scottish Incredible String Band from 1967 and the distinctive folk baroque guitar style of players like Davy Graham, Martin Carthy, John Renbourn and Bert Jansch.B. Sweers, Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), pp. 40‚Äì53. Many progressive folk performers continued to retain a traditional element in their music, including Jansch and Renbourn, who with Jacqui McShee, Danny Thompson, and Terry Cox, formed Pentangle in 1967. Others totally abandoned the traditional element and in this area particularly important were the Scottish artists Donovan (who was most influenced by emerging progressive folk musicians in America like Bob Dylan) and the Incredible String Band, who from 1967 incorporated a range of influences including medieval and eastern music into their compositions. Some of this, particularly the Incredible String Band, has been seen as developing into the further subgenre of psych or psychedelic folk and had a considerable impact on progressive and psychedelic rock.J. DeRogatis, Turn on Your Mind: Four Decades of Great Psychedelic Rock (Milwaukie MI, Hal Leonard, 2003), p. 120. There was a brief flowering of British progressive folk in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with groups like the Third Ear Band and Quintessence following the eastern Indian musical and more abstract work by group such as Comus, Dando Shaft, Trees, Spirogyra, Forest, and Jan Dukes De Grey, but commercial success was elusive for these bands and most had broken off, or moved in very different directions, by about 1973. From about 1967 there were also a number British bands, like Fairport Convention, who were directly influenced by American acts like the Byrds to play folk music on electric instruments. =British psychedelia= Psychedelic music is inspired or influenced by psychedelic culture and attempts to replicate and enhance the mind-altering experiences of hallucinogenic drugs.Head Sounds It particularly grew out of blues-rock and progressive folk music and drew on non-Western sources such as Indian music's ragas and sitars as well as studio effects and long instrumental passages and surreal lyrics. It emerged during the mid-1960s among progressive folk bands in Britain and the United States and rapidly moved into rock and pop music being taken up by acts including the Beatles, The Yardbirds, Cream and Pink Floyd. Psychedelic rock bridged the transition from early blues-rock to progressive rock, art rock, experimental rock, hard rock and eventually heavy metal that would become major genres in the 1970s.E. Macan, Rocking the classics: English progressive rock and the counterculture (Oxford: Oxford University Press US, 1997), p. 68. Pop music Around 1967, in the aftermath of the British Invasion, as blues-rock, emerging folk rock and some beat bands, including the Beatles, veered towards a more serious forms of music, with an emphasis on meaning, virtuosity and orientated towards the albums market, the term pop music began to be applied to rock and roll based music with more commercial aims, often with inconsequential lyrics, particularly simple love songs, and orientated towards the singles chart, continuing the tradition of traditional pop.T. Warner, Pop music: technology and creativity: Trevor Horn and the digital revolution (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2003), pp. 3‚Äì4. Although some bands occupied territory that crossed the emerging rock/pop divide and were able to produce successes in both camps, including the Beatles and Rolling Stones, the British pop genre in the late 1960s would be dominated by individual singers like Sandie Shaw.

Speaking in 2008 about the game, Glover said \\"Mate I'm at a prosecutors conference today and the dropped ball thing has already been mentioned twice, I wouldn't say it gets brought up daily but certainly once a week it gets a mention\\". Glover dropped the pass which could have given the Eels the match-winning try.

As a pianist he performed with orchestras in the Quebec region in his early career and was the longtime accompanist and arranger for Trio lyrique. He had a long and fruitful relationship with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, serving as a music director, composer, arranger, conductor, and pianist for nearly four decades. Early life, education, and career Born in Thetford Mines, McIver grew up in Sherbrooke. In his youth he studied the violin and the flute and was a piano student of Alfred Whitehead. He later studied harmony with Oscar O'Brien. He started his performance career playing for silent films in Montreal in 1926. He began performing on Canadian radio programs as a pianist and singer (baritone) around 1930. In the early 1930s he started appearing as a concert pianist with orchestras like the Ottawa Philharmonic Orchestra. Trio lyrique In 1932 McIver was enlisted to work as an accompanist and arranger for Trio lyrique (TL), a newly formed vocal trio in Montreal that consisted of baritone Lionel Daunais, contralto Anna Malenfant, and tenor Ludovic Huot. Jules Jacob replaced Huot in the early 1940s. In 1933 the ensemble was engaged by CRBC for its network series One Hour with You, on which the group performed for 87 weeks. In 1934 the TL released the LP album Chansons de Lionel Daunais for Radio Canada International. In 1936 the group performed for the CBS radio network in New York where McIver was also engaged as a staff arranger. The TL continued to perform actively in public concerts and on CBC Radio programs like The Play of the Week, Light Up and Listen. and Serenade for Strings up until the mid-1960s when it disbanded. The group re-united briefly in the autumn of 1971 for CBC broadcasts honoring Daunais and his work. In 1984 the album Le Trio lyrique chante Lionel Daunais was released; containing music from the ensemble's many radio broadcasts. All of the arrangements performed during the TL's performance history were by McIver. Composer, arranger, and conductor During the 1930s McIVer began composing background music for many of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's radio dramas. During World War II he wrote and conducted music for the shows sponsored by the Canada Savings Bond and other radio broadcasts in Montreal. He also served as a conductor for entertainments given at army bases throughout Canada by Jack Benny. During the 1950s and 1960s, McIVer worked actively as a music director of variety programs for both CBC Television and CBC Radio. He notably directed the music for the 5 September 1952 opening telecast of CBC (Montreal) TV. Among the programs he directed were Silhouettes, Paillettes, Northern Electric Concert, Le Trio lyrique, and Sunday Night Shows. He also composed the film score for the feature picture Le Rossignol et les cloches and wrote a number of orchestral works. Having never retired, McIver died in Montreal in 1969 at the age of 65.

Today there are no memorials of any kind on the site of the camp, which is just to the south of St Teresa's Hospital.

It is a small shrub with lemon-scented leaves and small, pale pink or white flowers which appear from late winter to summer. Description Zieria citriodora is a low or rounded shrub which grows to high and wide and which often grows from rhizomes. Its branches are dotted with oil glands and covered with short, soft hairs, often becoming glabrous with age. The leaves are composed of three leaflets with the central one linear or lance-shaped, long and wide with a petiole long. Each leaflet is dotted with oil glands, has a covering of short, soft hairs and has its edges more or less rolled under. The leaves are strongly lemon-scented when crushed. The flowers are arranged singly or in groups of up to three in leaf axils, the groups usually much longer than the leaves. The sepals are triangular, about long and hairy. The four petals are white to pale pink, long, overlap at their edges and are covered with tiny, soft hairs. Flowering occurs from late winter to summer and the fruits which follow are hairy and dotted with oil glands. Taxonomy and naming Lemon- scented zieria was first formally described in 2002 by James Armstrong from a specimen collected near the village of Numeralla and the description was published in Australian Systematic Botany. The specific epithet (citriodora) is derived from the Latin words citrus meaning \\"citron-tree\\" and odora meaning \\"having a fragrant smell.\\" Distribution and habitat Zieria citriodora mostly grows in shallow gravelly or sandy soils on moderately steep slopes in low eucalypt woodland. It is found in scattered populations in New South Wales and Victoria. In New South Wales, there are two populations which are restricted to the Kybeyan Range east of Cooma and in Victoria to four populations in East Gippsland. These populations are all within the South Eastern Highlands biogeographic region. Conservation The total population of Z. citriodora in New South Wales is estimated to be less than 600 individual plants including about 150 plants on crown land near Numerella and another of 32 plants on private land near Kybeyan. A count in 2004 of the species in Victoria estimated a population size of about 260 plants, all in the Alpine National Park near Omeo. The main threats to the species are browsing by both native hervibores and domestic stock, pressure from rural residential development and altered fire regines. The species is listed as vulnerable under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Use in horticulture Lemon-scented zieria is most easily propagated from cuttings and grows best in well-drained, acidic soil. It requires little fertilizer and is usually not affected by pests or disease if grown in well- drained soil. It is frost resistant and tolerates exposed and partly shaded positions.

Double fasciae are rare in Nepticulidae, but occur frequently in the Asiatic species of Enteucha and in most Ectoedemia subgenus Etainia species. However, S. kurilensis does not share important apomorphic characters with these. The abdominal tufts are also remarkable.

Janota began his career with Benfica. He played twice for their B team in the Segunda Divis√£o, the third tier of Portuguese football, before moving on to third-tier clubs Estrela de Vendas Novas, Atl√©tico CP and Estrela da Amadora. He spent the 2010‚Äì11 season with Liga de Honra (second-tier) Trofense, but never played for the first team. After a season back in the third tier with Mafra, Janota returned to Atl√©tico CP, where he finally made his first appearance in the newly renamed Segunda Liga. He continued his Segunda Liga career with Acad√©mico Viseu and Oriental, before returning to Viseu in 2015. He signed for Tondela ahead of the 2016‚Äì17 season, and made his Primeira Liga debut in April 2017. That was his last top-flight appearance, and after half a season with Mafra he rejoined Acad√©mico Viseu in January 2019. In international football, Janota played for his country from under-16 to under-19 level, and was part of Portugal's squad for the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup without taking the field. Club career Janota was born in Pero Pinheiro, Sintra, in the Greater Lisbon area. He began his football career in the youth system of Primeira Liga club Benfica, and made his senior debut for Benfica's B team as a 17-year-old, on 16 October 2005 in a 2‚Äì0 defeat of Pinhalnovense in the Segunda Divis√£o, the third tier of Portuguese football. A few days later, with the club's two main goalkeepers Jos√© Moreira out for six months and Quim receiving treatment for a recent injury, Janota received an unexpected call-up to train with the first-team squad ahead of the match with Estrela da Amadora; Quim recovered in time to start the match. Janota played once more for Benfica B, and was once an unused substitute for the first team, before being released at the end of the 2005‚Äì06 season. After reported interest from Belgian club Standard Li√®ge and a trial in Spain with Espanyol, he remained in Portugal. He played five Segunda Divis√£o matches for Estrela de Vendas Novas in late 2006, then moved on to Atl√©tico CP. Ahead of the 2007‚Äì08 season, he had a trial with Spanish third-tier club Le√≥n, and in October spent a week with Dutch Eredivisie side FC Utrecht to gain experience. Janota made his senior debut for Atl√©tico in February 2008, as a first-half substitute when goalkeeper Filipe Le√£o was sent off against Carregado, and kept a clean sheet the following week against Lusit√¢nia. After Le√£o's return from suspension, he and Janota shared the goalkeeping duties for the remainder of the season. Atl√©tico's need to reduce spending meant Janota was one of only five players retained for 2008‚Äì09. He was undisputed first-choice goalkeeper during the regular season, but shared the promotion group duties with Rui Santos. Atl√©tico were not promoted, and Janota left the club at the end of the season. He spent the 2009‚Äì10 season as Estrela da Amadora's main goalkeeper, before moving up to the Liga de Honra (second tier) as one of eleven new signings for Trofense. He was an unused substitute in 12 matches but played no competitive first-team football as Trofense came close to promotion to the Primeira Liga. Janota returned to the Segunda Divis√£o for 2011‚Äì12 as Mafra's regular goalkeeper. He was ever-present until being sent off on 5 February 2012; Mafra had already used all three substitutes, so forward Nuno Sousa had to go in goal for the last few minutes of the match and was unable to prevent Caldas equalising. He then signed a two-year contract with former club Atl√©tico CP, newly promoted to the Segunda Liga. He began the season as understudy to Filipe Le√£o, playing only in one League Cup match and the Portuguese Cup second-round defeat to Naval before replacing Le√£o in the starting eleven on matchday 32 to make his first appearance in the second tier. He kept a clean sheet as Atl√©tico beat Porto B 1‚Äì0 to secure only their second win of the season; he was beaten only once, by a shot that hit the post, and, in what Record correspondent described as a great display, made several good interventions to contribute to the victory for his tiring team. He kept his place for the last 11 matches of the campaign, before becoming the first signing for Segunda Liga newcomers Acad√©mico Viseu in June 2013. Viseu used Janota sparingly at the start of the season, but he then established himself at first choice, and played in 30 consecutive league matches. He then left the club for Oriental, themselves newly promoted to the Segunda Liga, where he found himself used as backup to Tiago Mota and selected only for cup matches. He came into the side in the second half of the season, making 13 league appearances, before rejoining Acad√©mico Viseu for 2015‚Äì16. Janota was ever-present in league matches in his second spell with Viseu, and was voted best goalkeeper in the Segunda Liga. On 1 July 2016, Janota signed a two-year contact with Primeira Liga club Tondela. With Cl√°udio Ramos established as first choice, Janota began the season on the bench. He made his first appearance on 9 October, against Feirense in the League Cup: after 75 minutes, with Tondela already 2‚Äì0 down and playing with ten men, he rushed out of his area, brought down an opponent, and was sent off. With no substitutes available, centre-half Jo√£o Pica had to go in goal; he conceded once, to an own goal. His next appearance was six months later. After Ramos was sent off very late in the previous match, Janota made his Primeira Liga debut at the age of 30, away to Vit√≥ria de Guimar√£es on 9 April 2017; Tondela lost 2‚Äì1. In the second year of his contract, he made only one first-team appearance, in the third round of the Portuguese Cup: Tondela let slip a two-goal lead away to second-tier Leix√µes and lost 3‚Äì2 in extra time. Janota returned to Mafra in 2018, but was restricted to the cup competitions while Jo√£o Godinho played the league matches. In January 2019, he rejoined Acad√©mico Viseu for a third time, signing a contract until the end of the season. International career While a youngster with Benfica, he represented his country at under-16 level, and was first-choice goalkeeper at the European under-17 championship finals, at which Portugal's under-17s beat England 3‚Äì2 on penalties to win the third-place play-off; Janota saved the decisive penalty. He appeared for the under-18s in 2005, and was in the squad for the European under-19 championship finals, but as second choice behind Porto's Igor Ara√∫jo. The sixth-place finish achieved in this competition guaranteed qualification for the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup; Janota, by this time an Atl√©tico CP player, was again selected for the squad, but made no appearances.

In 1862, Maharaja Khanderao Gaekwad, the Maharaja of Baroda, inaugurated of a railway line from Dabhoi to Miyagam. Oxen were used to haul the train, although in 1863, Nielson & Co. built a locomotive to be operated on the line from Dabhoi to Miyagram, as the 6.5 km/m rails were not suited for the regular use of an engine. Later, during the rule of Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III, the railway's network was further expanded. In 1873, the Dabhoi-Miyagam line (the first line) was re- laid with stronger rails to allow locomotives to be used, rather than oxen. However, locomotives were not regularly used on the line until 1880. During the Maharaja's reign, railway network extended to Goyagate, Chandod, Bodeli and Samalaya Jn with Dabhoi as its focal point. In 1949, the Gaikwad Baroda State Railway was merged with the Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway which was subsequently merged in 1951 with other adjacent zones to form Western Railway.

The conflict raged from 1985-1991 in Reggio Calabria. Practically all the 'ndrine in the city of Reggio Calabria grouped into either one of two opposing factions: the Condello, Imerti, Serraino and Rosmini clans on one side, and the De Stefano, Tegano, Libri and Latella clans on the other. Background The background of the war was a struggle over public contracts in relation with the announced construction of a bridge linking Calabria and Sicily over the Strait of Messina between Reggio Calabria and Messina. An additional motive was the attempt of the De Stefano clan to encroach on the territory of the Imertis in Villa San Giovanni, a town facing the city of Messina across the narrow strait. Gratteri & Nicaso, Fratelli di Sangue, pp. 65-68 Start of the conflict The war was triggered by the marriage between Giuseppina Condello ‚Äì the sister of the Condello brothers, underbosses of De Stefano ‚Äì and Antonio Imerti, the leader of a neighbouring 'ndrina in Villa San Giovanni. The boss Paolo De Stefano became fearful of the new alliance that might challenge his power base. The conflict exploded in 1985, two years after the marriage and saw practically all the 'ndrine in the city of Reggio Calabria grouped into either one of two opposing factions.Paoli, Mafia Brotherhoods, pp. 88-89 The De Stefano clan prepared itself for the fight through another marriage, between Orazio De Stefano, Paolo's younger brother, and Antonietta Benestare, niece of the boss Giovanni Tegano. Celebrated on December 2, 1985, the wedding sealed the alliance between the de Stefanos and the powerful Tegano clan. The war started with a failed bomb attack on Antonio Imerti on October 11, 1985, which left three of his bodyguards dead. Si e' salvato soltanto il boss, La Repubblica, October 13, 1985 Two days later Imerti reacted and killed Paolo De Stefano on October 13, 1985. Ucciso il 're delle cosche' e ora lotta per la successione, La Repubblica, October 15, 1985 The brothers Paolo and Domenico Condello were arrested in January 1988 for killing De Stefano. Catturati a Reggio Calabria i killer del boss De Stefano, La Repubblica, January 7, 1988 Domenico Libri succeeded De Stefano as the leader of the alliance with Giovanni Tegano. Preso il numero uno della 'ndrangheta, La Repubblica, September 17, 1992 Libri became one of the principal targets of the opposing clans. While in prison a sniper killed his son Pasquale Rocco Libri in September 1988, as he was strolling in the prison yard. Six months later, in March 1989, a sniper just missed Libri, surrounded by Carabinieri, when he was leaving the court in Reggio Calabria where he had to appear in a trial against the 'Ndrangheta. Stavolta il 'cecchino' ha fallito, La Repubblica, March 18, 1989 Peace After nearly six years the war had neither winners nor losers. A peace for the bloody feud was brokered in September 1991 on the instigation of Domenico Libri and the Teganos. The conflict was settled with the help of other 'Ndrangheta bosses. Antonio Nirta, head of the San Luca locale vouched for the De Stefano-Tegano and Libri, while Antonio Mammoliti vouched for the Condello-Imerti clan. Another mediator for the 'pax mafiosa' was Domenico Alvaro, head of the locale of Sinopoli. Sentenza procedimento penale Olimpia, Tribunale di Reggio Calabria, January 19, 1999 According to several turncoats (pentiti) the Sicilian Mafia was also involved in the peace process as well as 'Ndrangheta bosses from Canada, such as Joe Imerti from Toronto, a cousin of Antonio Imerti, and one of the Zito clan in Canada. According to the pentito Pasquale Barreca, a former member of the De Stefano clan, \\"the role of Cosa Nostra was decisive for the conclusion of the war.\\"Paoli, Mafia Brotherhoods, pp. 61-62 According to the pentito Francesco Fonti it was Leoluca Bagarella who represented the interests of Cosa Nostra. =Casualties= The fatalities of the war varies between 500 and more than 1,000.

The Greek operations culminated with the capture of the strategically important Klisura Pass on January 1941. Background After its successful counter-attack and the Battle of Morava‚ÄìIvan, the Hellenic Army penetrated deep into Italian-held Albanian territory, taking control of the local urban centers of Gjirokast√´r and Kor√ß√´ by December 1940. In a war council on 5 December, General Alexander Papagos, worried about the possibility of German intervention in support of the Italians, attempted to hasten the advance. Moreover, Generals Pitsikas and Tsolakoglou suggested the immediate capture of the Klisura Pass so as to secure the Greek positions. Aerial view of the battlefield During the period of the Greek counter- offensive, the Greek forces had much greater distances to contend with and their logistics and road network were substantially inferior compared to the Italians. The Klisura Pass was a particularly strategic location near the town of Berat and the topography of the terrain in addition to bad weather made the operation extremely difficult. Battle Greek army advance to Klisura The attack was led by the II Army Corps, and especially by the 1st and 11th divisions.Army History Directorate (Greece). An abridged history of the Greek- Italian and Greek-German war, 1940‚Äì1941. Hellenic Army General Staff, 1997. , p. 128 During the battle, the Italians used for the first time the new M13 medium tanks of the Centauro Armored Division. They were used in frontal attacks, but were decimated by Greek artillery fire. On 10 January, after four days of fierce battles, the Greek infantry divisions finally captured the pass. The final assault that resulted in the location's capture was led by the recently arrived 5th Division, which consisted mainly of Cretans. Penetration of the Greek forces (13 November 1940 ‚Äì 7 April 1941) and deployment of major units The Italian headquarters immediately launched counterattacks to recapture the sector. Italian Supreme Commander Ugo Cavallero ordered the newly arrived Lupi di Toscana Division to support the Julia Alpine Division, but the operation was ill-prepared. Although they faced only four Greek battalions, they rapidly lost one battalion of their own due to encirclement. By 11 January, the Italian attack had been pushed back and over the next days, the Lupi di Toscana were almost annihilated. This failure secured Greek possession of the pass. Aftermath The capture of the strategic pass by the Greek army was considered a major success by the Allied forces, with the Commander of the British forces in the Middle East, Archibald Wavell, sending a congratulatory message to Alexander Papagos. In the following weeks, the front lines stabilized, with the Greek forces facing a bad logistical situation and the Italians managing to gain numerical superiority in order to stop their retreat. Both sides kept their positions until the German intervention in April 1941. On January 22 2018, following an agreement between the Greek and Albanian foreign ministers, a systematic effort to recover the bodies of fallen Greek soldiers from the battle was undertaken between the two countries. The remains of the Greek soldiers will be buried in the Greek military cemetery located within the pass.

Most times it is harmless, made for basic ordinary opportunistic advantages, as gatecrashing a party just to get free food and beverage. But sometimes it is used for questionable, serious violations, where an individual can use emotional resources, blackmail, family ties, promises, rewards or money to obtain (sometimes illegal) favors or to get advantage. Some people see it as a typically Brazilian method of social navigation, but people forget to mention that this expression also comes from the necessity associated with a lack of resources and help. Most Brazilians have to be creative and invent new simpler ways to do things they need, as living.\\"Popular cinema in Brazil, 1930-2001\\", by Stephanie Dennison, Lisa Shaw, 2004, , section \\"Malandragem and jeitinho\\" The word \\"jeitinho\\" is the diminutive form of jeito, meaning 'way', which comes from the Latin 'jactum'https://michaelis.uol.com.br/moderno- portugues/busca/portugues-brasileiro/jeito/. The usage of 'jeitinho' is derived from the expression dar um jeito, meaning \\"to find a way\\". It implies the use of resources at hand, as well as personal connections, and creativity. Como √© que ele conseguiu os bilhetes? How did he get the tickets? Ele deu um jeito. He found a way. One way to understand jeitinho is as a recurso de esperteza, which means a resource used by espertos‚Äîsavvy, cunning, or sly individuals who use common sense and prior knowledge, as well as naturally gifted intelligence in their thought processes. It implies that a person is \\"street-smart\\", but not necessarily \\"book-smart.\\" It typically also connotes opportunism, pragmatism, and using one's networks, with little regard for the law, the state or for persons outside of one's own circle or family. Scholarly discussion Brazilian scholar and historian S√©rgio Buarque de Hollanda connects the concept of jeitinho to Brazil's mixed heritage and Iberian ancestry in his book \\"Roots of Brazil\\" (Ra√≠zes do Brasil). In this work, jeitinho is tied to the idea that a typical Brazilian is a friendly, cordial man, prone to making initial decisions based on his emotions instead of his reason, and that this feature can be found everywhere in the country, from the highest offices of government to the most common situations of everyday life. Jeitinho is also observed in Rio de Janeiro's carnival industry by the scholar Roberto DaMatta in his book \\"Carnavais, Malandros e Her√≥is\\" (Carnival, Rogues and Heroes. Notre Dame Press). Da Matta sees jeitinho in the creative culture of carnival. Similarity to other terms The terms \\"malandro\\" and \\"malandragem\\", which can be roughly translated as \\"rogue\\" and \\"roguishness\\", are very similar to the \\"jeitinho\\", but these terms imply a greater degree of breaking the rules, as opposed to bending the rules. Elsewhere in Latin America, similar concepts include viveza criolla in Argentina and Uruguay, juega vivo in Panama and malicia ind√≠gena in Colombia.

It was discovered on 26 August 1989, by Scottish-Australian astronomer Robert McNaught at the Siding Spring Observatory in Canberra, Australia. It is named after Hans Kennedy, a Dutch-Australian astronomer known for his work with photographing binary stars.  Description  Hans Kennedy was born in 1924 in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. After five years in India and New Zealand as an engineer, he left Christchurch in 1962 for Sydney. Initially working at the division of Astronomy and Physics at the CSIRO, he developed a multi-exposure technique to observe potential flare stars, using a scanning densitometer. He selected contact binaries as his primary area of research and recorded period changes of 24 contact binaries. He investigated the effect of using an incorrect ephemeris to determine times of minimum light and analysed the nature of abrupt period changes, concluding that they are non-existent. He indicated that periods of broken contact must be of limited duration due to the formation of a gas stream between the binary components and demonstrated that asymmetric minima are caused by dark magnetic spots. Despite criticism, he predicted the existence of large equal-mass binaries which were discovered in 2007. He developed a technique to observe the light from faint binaries during minimum light when they become invisible at visible wavelengths, using an integrator. Hans Kennedy was also instrumental in the discovery of the atmosphere of Pluto and was requested by NASA to photographically track several Apollo missions. He participated in photo- electric observations of the asteroid Kleopatra and found that it is an elongated metallic object consisting of an alloy of iron and nickel. Kennedy was a close associate of Gerald Kron (US Naval Observatory)and Bart Bok (University of Arizona). He produced over 32 papers and publications. Although retired, he is analysing Schmidt plates and involved in research of binaries.

He effectively acted as chief minister during her regency for her young son, Emperor Constantine VI (r. 780‚Äì797) in 780‚Äì790, until overthrown and exiled by a military revolt in favour of the young emperor in 790. Restored to power by Constantine along with Irene in 792, Staurakios aided her in the eventual removal, blinding, and possible murder of her son in 797. His own position thereafter was threatened by the rise of another powerful eunuch, Aetios. Their increasing rivalry, and Staurakios's own imperial ambitions, were only resolved by Staurakios's death. Biography =First minister under Irene's regency= 15th-century fresco showing Empress Irene and Emperor Constantine VI presiding over the final session of the Seventh Ecumenical Council (Second Council of Nicaea), which first overturned Iconoclasm. Staurakios emerged into prominence in 781, when Irene, as regent for her infant son Constantine VI, appointed him to the post of logothetes tou dromou, the Byzantine Empire's foreign minister. Already holding the high court rank of patrikios, through this appointment Staurakios became, in the words of the chronicler Theophanes the Confessor, \\"the foremost man of his day and in charge of everything\\" for most of Irene's subsequent reign... This appointment was part of Irene's consistent policy to rely on eunuch officials as ministers and generals, in large part the result of her distrust towards the established generals of her late husband, Leo IV (r. 775‚Äì780) and his father Constantine V (r. 741‚Äì775). The generals, intensely loyal to the Isaurian dynasty and its vehemently iconoclastic policies, could threaten her own position: already a few weeks after Leo IV's death, Irene had foiled a palace plot to put his surviving brother, the Caesar Nikephoros, on the throne.; . This reliance on eunuchs caused some hostility in the military; resentment at Staurakios's appointment to this powerful post is given by the Byzantine chroniclers as the reason for the (initially secret) defection of the prominent Armenian strategos of the Bucellarian Theme, Tatzates, to the Arabs in 782. This was a critical blow to the Byzantines, who at that time had almost succeeded in encircling the invading army of the future Caliph Harun al-Rashid (r. 786‚Äì809). On Tatzates's suggestion, Harun asked for negotiations, but when the imperial envoys, including Staurakios, arrived, they were seized and held as hostages. At this point, Tatzates and his men publicly went over to the Caliph. Staurakios and the other envoys were released only when Empress Irene accepted the Caliph's harsh terms for a three-year truce, including the annual payment of an enormous tribute of 70,000 or 90,000 gold dinars and the handing over of 10,000 silk garments... In the next year, Staurakios led an imperial expedition against the Slavic communities (Sclaviniae) of Greece. Setting out from Constantinople, the imperial army followed the Thracian coast into Macedonia, and then south into Thessaly, Central Greece and the Peloponnese. This expedition restored a measure of Byzantine imperial authority over these areas, and collected booty and tribute from the locals. Empress Irene rewarded her loyal minister by allowing him to celebrate a triumph in the Hippodrome of Constantinople in January 784.. Buoyed by this success, which was followed by a restoration of imperial control in much of Thrace as far as Philippopolis, Irene moved towards the restoration of the veneration of icons, which had been prohibited by Emperor Constantine V. A new ecumenical council was convened. Initially, in 786, it was held in the Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople, but the soldiers of the tagmata, founded by Constantine V and loyal to his iconoclastic policies, gathered outside in protest and forced the assembly to be broken up.; . In order to neutralize their reaction, Irene sent the tagmata to the army base of Malagina in Bithynia, allegedly in preparation for a campaign against the Arabs. There, some 1,500 of the soldiers were dismissed while Staurakios brought loyal thematic troops from Thrace to guard the capital. Irene then reconvened the council at Nicaea, after dismissing the most recalcitrant iconoclast bishops. Predictably, iconoclasm was overturned as a heresy, and the veneration of images was restored.; ; . =Clash with Constantine VI= In 788, Staurakios is recorded as attending as a judge in the bride show for the 17-year-old Constantine VI, along with Irene and the young Byzantine emperor himself. Maria of Amnia was chosen, although Constantine was unhappy about the breaking up of his earlier betrothal with Rotrude, Charlemagne's daughter. From this point on, he began to resent his mother's control over state affairs and the power of her eunuch officials... Along with a few trusted conspirators, Constantine planned to arrest Staurakios and exile him to Sicily, while he would assume his position as effective co-ruler of the Byzantine Empire. Their plans were preempted by Staurakios, however: he persuaded Irene to arrest, torture, exile or imprison Constantine's associates, while Constantine himself was placed under house arrest. Next, Irene demanded of the army an oath of loyalty, whose wording placed her before her son in precedence. This demand provoked a mutiny by the soldiers of the Armeniac Theme, which then spread throughout the Anatolian armies, which assembled in Bithynia and demanded Emperor Constantine's release. Bowing to their pressure, Irene capitulated and Constantine was installed as sole ruler in December 790. Among Constantine's first acts was to have Staurakios flogged, tonsured, and exiled to the Armeniac Theme, while all other eunuch officials were likewise exiled.. Irene remained confined in a palace at the Harbour of Eleutherios in the capital and retained her formal title as empress. Then, on 15 January 792, for reasons not clear, she was recalled to the imperial palace with her title as empress and co-ruler confirmed and her name restored in the imperial acclamations.. Staurakios too seems to have been recalled and, along with Irene, again took an active role in the governance of the state. This turn of events drove the Armeniacs once again to mutiny, but their commander, Alexios Mosele, was in Constantinople. Despite guarantees of safety, Mosele was imprisoned and later blinded at the instigation of Irene and Staurakios, both eager to take revenge for his role in their overthrow in 790... This alienated the army, especially the Armeniacs, who had provided a firm support base for Constantine VI against his mother. In 795, Constantine also strained relations with the Church in the so- called \\"Moechian Controversy\\", when he divorced Maria and married his mistress Theodote.. As a result, Empress Irene's own position with the capital's bureaucracy became stronger and she began plotting against her son. While Irene bribed the tagmata, Staurakios and other agents of Irene foiled an expedition headed by Constantine against the Arabs, afraid that a victory would boost the emperor's standing with the people and the army. As he returned to the capital, Constantine was seized and blinded. Although it was officially stated that he survived and remained imprisoned, he likely died of his wounds sometime after.. =Irene's sole rule and Staurakios's rivalry with Aetios= solidus of Empress Irene during her sole rule (r. 797‚Äì802). With the removal of Constantine VI, Irene henceforth reigned alone, the first Byzantine empress to do so. Staurakios, however, found his own position increasingly challenged by another powerful eunuch and trusted servant of the empress, Aetios. Both were engaged in an intense rivalry to place their relatives in positions of power so as to secure control of the Empire after Irene's death.; . This rivalry intensified when Irene fell seriously ill in May 799. With the backing of the Domestic of the Schools, Niketas Triphyllios, Aetios accused Staurakios to Irene of planning to usurp the throne. Irene held a council at the Palace of Hieria, where her powerful minister was rebuked but got off with an apology. Staurakios now began preparing his own counter stroke, bribing members of the tagmata, although he seems to have lacked supporters among the higher command echelons. Although a eunuch was legally barred from the imperial throne, Staurakios nevertheless seems to have aspired to seize it for himself.... Warned by Aetios, Empress Irene issued orders in February 800 that no one from the military should have any contact with Staurakios. This measure curbed the latter's designs, and introduced a precarious balance between Staurakios and Aetios, the latter still supported by Niketas Triphyllios. Soon after, Staurakios fell fatally ill, reportedly coughing up blood. Nevertheless, persuaded by doctors, monks and soothsayers that he would live and become Byzantine emperor, he instigated a revolt in Cappadocia against his adversary Aetios, who had by then secured the post of strategos of the Anatolic Theme (the highest-ranked military position in the Byzantine Empire). However, even before news of the revolt, which was swiftly suppressed, reached the capital, Staurakios died on 3 June 800..

It is often said that her reply was that she would marry him if he built her a castle. Whether or not that was said, the couple married in 1857 and in due course a castle was built.

After his death, the Castle stayed in the Fielden family but was used infrequently and was eventually sold for ¬£10,000.

After a 3-month closure in 1979 the castle reopened as the privately run Castle School. 20 boys with emotional and behavioural problems were educated there. Following the school's closure in 1989 the castle lay empty for a period of 6 years. The Castle was acquired by Buddhists of the New Kadampa Tradition in 1995. They bought the castle for ¬£320,000 and the building became the Losang Dragpa Centre, named after a famous teacher of Tibetan Buddhism. In 2007 it was announced that the Buddhists were leaving the CastleCastle Mystery as Monks Quit, Todmorden News, 30 August 2007. and there was concern locally for the future of the Castle, especially in light of the fact that the roof was in a state of disrepair and the work required to renovate it was going to cost in the region of ¬£200,000. The Buddhists had secured a grant for ¬£127,000 from English Heritage and the Heritage Lottery Fund but this would not necessarily be transferable to the new owners. Robinwood Activity Centre Ltd. acquired the castle and grounds for ¬£2.2 million in 2008 and by March 2009 had transformed the Castle into an activity centre. The Building The Fireplace and Marble Pillars of the Saloon Area Fielden commissioned John Gibson to design the Castle. It was to \\"Immortalise the name of Fielden\\" and to be \\"the most commanding object in the neighbourhood\\". The total cost of the building came to a total of ¬£71,589 making it more expensive than either Todmorden Town Hall or Todmorden's Unitarian Church, both prestigious and architecturally significant buildings designed by Gibson. The 2 storey building has 4 turrets on its corners, several bay windows and a substantial 4 storey tower. The vast majority of the top of the building is castellated with battlements although of course this is for aesthetic rather than defensive reasons. Inside the castle are large columns of Devonshire Marble, a Rose Pink Marble fireplace, and an imposing Spinkwell Stone staircase. The Saloon (or 'Salon') area is topped by two large glass domes. The building contains four stone Tympana carved from Caen stone. The four carvings depict different images associated with the cotton industry. The Fieldens were a force for change in the conditions of workers in the very industry that made their own fortunes. This has certainly led some to believe that the carvings are intended to communicate these humanitarian beliefs. The 66-room building is Grade II* listed.\\"Trade and Industry\\", English Heritage File:Slaves picking cotton (tympanum at Dobroyd Castle).jpgalt=Carved stone tympanum showing enslaved African cotton pickers overseen by ominously depicted slave masterThe first carving of enslaved African people picking cotton in America.

He left compositions for chamber orchestra and orchestra, vocal and one electronic composition. Escher was also a poet, painter and writer.  Biography  = Youth = Escher was born the son of the geologist and mineralogist Berend George Escher and the Swiss Emma Brosy. His father was a son of the engineer George Arnold Escher and half-brother of the graphic artist Maurits Cornelis Escher. At the age of four, Escher moved with his family to Batavia, Dutch East Indies, where his father worked as a geologist for the Batavian Petroleum Company. His father was a good pianist and he gave the young Escher piano lessons.Samama, Leo. 'Vermeulen, Pijper en Escher ‚Äì Drie erflaters in de muziek van de twintigste eeuw: drie vrienden.‚Äô Erflaters van de twintigste eeuw . Amsterdam: Querido, 1991: 264‚Äì289. = Study = In 1922, five years later, they were back in the Netherlands, now in Leiden. Escher went to the Stedelijk Gymnasium Leiden and continued his piano lessons, now with B√© Hartz. He also played the violin and got harmony lessons.Leo Samama. \\"Escher, Rudolf.\\" Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. 19 januari 2011. After four years he quit school. At first he could not choose between music, visual arts and letters but in 1929 he decided to become a composer. Next he wanted to go to the conservatoire in Cologne. The Dutch composer Peter van Anrooy advised him to study piano. On second thoughts Escher went to the Toonkunst Conservatoire in Rotterdam in 1931. Until 1937 he studied the piano as major with the cello as minor. From 1934 to 1937 he also studied composition with Willem Pijper as his teacher. Escher's debut was in 1935 with his First piano sonata. He also attracted attention in 1938 with an important essay: Toscanini and Debussy, magic of reality. In this essay his views towards composing are evident. He also wrote a few poems, which were published in Forum. = Work = When the Second World War expanded into the Netherlands, many of Escher's compositions from his study period were destroyed in the bombing of Rotterdam on 14 May 1940. He also lost his house and all his possessions. During the war Escher composed Musique pour l'esprit en deuil (1941‚Äì43). This work quickly elevated him to be the most important composer in the Netherlands. About the compositions from the war, he wrote: 'My work from this period has got a sort of gravity, a doggedness here and there, which makes it clearly to realize as grown amid disasters. For me, personally, that is the ethical significance of it: they are constructions of the mind, in a time that 'mind' (if you can still call it that way) is used almost exclusively for destructive purposes.‚ÄôBrief van Rudolf Escher aan Piet Damst√©, d.d. 17 februari 1952. Soon after the war Escher was a contributor about visual arts and music for the weekly Groene Amsterdammer. He turned out to be a talented poet, publishing poetry in literary magazines into the 1950s. Socially he had little to complain about; he was offered several administrative functions, his compositions were successfully performed, and his publications were followed with interest. After 1946 Escher befriended the Dutch composer Matthijs Vermeulen. They shared the same social and literary interests and communist ideals. They had enough trust in each other so that they could write critically about the others' compositions. Escher's communist ideals were expressed in his membership of the Communist Party (from 1934 to 1940). He wrote a few critiques for the monthly communist periodical Politics and Culture, using the pseudonym A. Leuvens. During the 1950s he became critical of Russian communism, which he considered a failure. What remained was his leftist political orientation. In 1958 Escher was present at the 32nd ISCM festival in Strasbourg. About this he wrote reviews to his friend and composer-colleague Peter Schat. In 1960 he was present at the ISCM festival in Cologne. Here he got excited about Pli selon pli of Pierre Boulez.Groot, Rokus de. 'Review.' Tijdschrift van de Vereniging voor Nederlandse Muziekgeschiedenis 43(2), 1993: 131‚Äì134. Thus Escher began experimenting with electronic music and serialism in the 1960s. He took lessons in the technique of electronic music with lectures in elementary sound mechanics, electro- physics and sound technology in Delft. Afterwards he experimented in the Studio for Electronic Music in Delft and then at the Institute of Sonology in Utrecht. He decided to ask for analysis classes with Boulez, with reference to the piece he heard in Cologne. From 3 to 7 November 1960 he visited Boulez in Baden-Baden. Those days were spent on analyzing Improvisations sur Mallarm√© I & II of Boulez. At last Escher concluded that the techniques did not feel right for him. Nevertheless, in his Wind Quintet from 1967 serial music can be found. He uses structure formulas that remind a listener of Boulez. His visit led a few weeks later to a purification of his works: He wrote a request to the director of the publisher Donemus to remove four works unconditionally and three with some restrictions.Beer, Ronald de. Zonder restrictie de nek omgedraaid. Volkskrant 30 April 1999. In 1960‚Äì61 Escher gave lessons at the Conservatoire of Amsterdam. He used his experience with Boulez to give a lecture on \\"the meaning of structure and form by Debussy with reference to recent serial composition techniques by Boulez.\\" He became Scientific Senior Lecturer at the Institute for Musicology at the University of Utrecht from 1964 to 1977. His specialization was 'Aspects of the twentieth century'. He gave a lecture \\"characteristic structure- and form criteria in the music of the twentieth century.\\" Besides music theory he also explored the world of music as a semantic sign system and Audiology. = Legacy = Escher died at the age of 68 in De Koog on the Frisian Island Texel. In 1980 his friends and experts united to create the Escher Committee. Among others involved were Willem Boogman, Elmer Sch√∂nberger and Dirk Jacob Hamoen. With the help of the committee the widow of the composer compiled a catalog with comments of Escher's works. In 1992 the Centrum Nederlandse Muziek published correspondence between Escher and the composer Peter Schat, 33 letters and postcards written between 13 May 1958 and 5 August 1961. In the letters they talked about compositions of others as well as their own, and they discussed issues in aesthetics and music theory. The letters give insight to Dutch history, aesthetics, and theory of the 20th-century music, from the inception to the reception of serialism.Voermans, Erik, ed. Brieven, 1958‚Äì1961. Zutphen, 1992. [briefwisseling tussen Escher en P. Schat] In the year of the publication of the correspondence Peter Schat published a letter to the dead Escher. In the letter Schat described the process of change that was happening in that time. He also notified Escher about the existing state of affairs in the Netherlands.Schat, Peter. Requiem over het Hollands Diep: een nagezonden brief aan Rudolf Escher. Zutphen: Walburg, 1993. In 1999 David Moore wrote that Escher is one of the most prominent Dutch composers of the previous generation.Moore, David W. ‚ÄòGuide to records: Escher.‚Äô American Record Guide Vol. 62(4), 1999: 102. Leo Samama was also laudatory when we mentioned Escher's work: \\"Together with the 'Sinfonia per dieci strumenti' (1973/75), the 'Flute sonata' (1976/79) and the 'Trio for clarinet, viola and piano' (1978/79), the 'Wind Quintet' belongs to the works of a master ‚Äì one of the few our country has known - of an artist that has developed such a personal language, a personal grammar, a personal sound, that every statement about French or German influences, about old or new music, about place and time are futile and meaningless.\\" There is a foundation named after Escher for young composers. Since 2006 the foundation is in the management at the Prins Bernard Culture Foundation. The Rudolf Escher Composers Foundation supports young composers financially to follow a study in the Netherlands or abroad. It also supports projects where the work of a young (Dutch) composers is being performed and of concerts where works of Escher are being performed. The foundation is funded by the board of the Rudolf Escher Committee and the inheritance of Escher.Waltmans, Astrid. Nieuw fonds voor jonge componisten . Prins Bernard Cultuurfonds persbericht. Amsterdam, 13 maart 2006 = Prizes = Escher received several prizes for his compositions during his live. In 1946 he got the Music prize of the city of Amsterdam for his orchestral work Musique pour l'esprit en deuil, yet before the first performance sounded. One year later he received the Dutch Government Prize for the suite for piano Arcana. He also received the Music price of the city of Amsterdam for Le vrai visage de la paix for choir a cappella. For Le tombeau de Ravel he got the Prof. Van der Leeuw Prize in 1959. Twice he could receive the Visser- Neerlandia Prize, for Nostalgies (1961) and the Wind Quintet (1968). Between these prizes he got the Willem Pijper Prize in 1966 for the Sonata concertante for cello and piano. Eventually Escher received the Johan Wagenaar Prize in 1977 for all his works.Samama, Leo.

It was carried out by Balli Komb√´tar during the Albanian Resistance of World War II. Two hundred local Balli Komb√´tar militants, commanded by Qemal Burimi and David Smiley, ambushed a German convoy and a troop carrier, inflicting heavy losses on the German troops. Background After the Italian occupation of Albania in 1939, several resistance groups gradually formed. One of the most important of these groups was Balli Komb√´tar, a nationalist organization led by Mit'hat Frash√´ri and Ali K√´lcyra. In mid-1943 the Special Operations Executive (SOE), a British clandestine organisation, sent several agents to Albania to cooperate with Balli Komb√´tar and the Albanian National Liberation Front. David Smiley, one of the SOE agents, contacted a unit of two hundred Balli Komb√´tar soldiers under the command of Qemal Burimi. After assembling at the village of Kurt√´s they decided to carry out an ambush against German troops on the main road near Kurt√´s connecting Kor√ß√´ to Ioannina. Ambush The Albanian troops were positioned along the road and Smiley laid sixteen mines in two groups of eight on either side of the road about apart. Shortly afterwards a large German troop-carrier towing an 88 mm gun approached and was blown up on one of the two groups of mines. The German soldiers that were not killed by the explosion were shot by the Ballists while they were trying to escape by running back along the road. Eighteen German soldiers were killed, twelve of them while in the troop-carrier. The captured gun was pushed into the river-bed below the road. About a half-hour later, a German convoy of twenty-three trucks approached the ambuscade from the direction of Leskovik. The first truck blew up on the second group of mines, while Smiley fired a 20 mm Breda gun on the following trucks, resulting in two of them bursting into flames. The Ballists shot down five German soldiers who tried to escape. The Albanian troops suffered no casualties during the attack. The German troops were from the 1st Alpine Division.

She recorded four albums in the 1970s and co-wrote the Helen Reddy hit \\"Emotion\\". Career One of five children, Dahlstrom was born in Houston, Texas. She began writing songs before her teen years and dreamed of becoming a songwriter while reading the credits on album sleeves. In 1967, she moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in music. After three years she signed a contract with Jobete Music, a division of Motown, and was mentored by Berry Gordy. She began a songwriting relationship with Severin Browne, the brother of Jackson Browne. Her first album was released by Uni Records, while the next three were released by 20th Century Records. She wrote \\"Sending My Good Thoughts to You\\" with Artie Wayne and dedicated it to her friend Jim Croce, who died in a plane crash in 1973. Her songs were recorded by Anne Murray (\\"Ain't No Way to Rise Above\\"), Cilla Black (\\"Running Out of World\\"), Helen Reddy (\\"Emotion\\"), Thelma Houston (\\"What If\\", \\"I'm Letting Go\\", and \\"I Never Did\\"), Michael Johnson (\\"Dialogue\\"), Captain & Tennille (\\"Feels Like More Than Dancing\\") Johnny Rivers (\\"Over the Line\\"), and Riders in the Sky (\\"Even Texas Isn't Big Enough Now\\"). Reddy's version of \\"Emotion\\" reached No. 22 on the pop music chart. The song was a translation of \\"Amoureuse\\" by V√©ronique Sanson. Dahlstrom stopped recording music in the 1970s, citing exhaustion as the reason. Years later in an interview, Russ Regan said he was surprised that her albums hadn't been more popular. During the 1980s, she continued to write songs and learn photography. Returning to Texas in 1990, she taught songwriting at the Art Institute in Houston and became director of the department. In 2008 she moved to London to pursue a master's degree in writing. Three years later she moved to San Jos√© del Cabo, Mexico. A compilation of her music from the 1970s was released in 2010.

Bob Hope, a comedian, was an investor in the original Arena Theatre. The towers, colored black, were developed in the early 1980s by Melvin Lane Powers. Powers built a personal penthouse on top of one of the towers and received a lot of attention for this. The penthouse, located in Arena Tower I, had a helicopter pad and a private swimming pool on the rooftop. Robert Williamson of the firm Holliday Fenoglio Fowler said that the Powers case was \\"pretty celebrated\\" and that the complex was \\"very storied.\\" Williamson described Powers as a \\"very flamboyant developer.\\" The complex was the most well-known development established by Powers.\\"Mossler case was sensational story of murder, intrigue.\\" Houston Chronicle. September 7, 2001. Retrieved on April 24, 2010. \\"Powers embarked on a career as a real estate developer. His most notable project was the twin 20-story Arena Towers office buildings and adjacent 2,800-seat Arena Theater.\\" Powers filed for bankruptcy. Afterwards, in 1986, Powers attempted to claim Arena Tower I, the north side tower, as his personal residence to prevent foreclosure. Bank of America repossessed the building and evicted Powers. Lawrence Wong, a real estate developer, acquired tower one from Bank of America in 1989. In 1990 he acquired the second tower from the Midland Bank of England. Laura A. Stromberg of the Houston Business Journal said that when Wong purchased the buildings, they were \\"substantially vacant.\\" At the time a block of space in tower one was vacant. In 1997 Arena Tower I was 88% leased and Arena Tower II was 73% leased. During that year Houston Cellular was the main tenant in Arena Tower I, and the building was named after the company. Other tenants in the Arena Towers included Houston Allstate, LTD Financial Services, and Prudential. During that year Logan Brown, a senior vice president of Grubb & Ellis, a real estate firm, said that the buildings were worth $30 million. Brown also said that they were \\"in poor condition\\" and needed updating. In 1997 Stromberg said that, according to real estate sources, the towers were reportedly under a contract of sale to Texas Commercial Properties Inc. Stromberg said that the sale would be the largest transaction of Class B office space in 13 years. For many years the Arena Theatre was operated by H'Town Arena, a tenant. In December 2004 the Arena Group and two limited partners bought the entire Arena Place complex from Lennar Partners for about $24.5 million. At the same time Transwestern Commercial Services replaced PM Realty Group as the agency that manages and provides leases for the property. H'Town Arena had stopped leasing in the theater days before the sale occurred, and as a result the theater stopped operating. As of 2004 the Class B office space in the complex was about 70% occupied, and the tenants included several large call centers. In September 2006 the limited partners sold their stake, which was 50 percent, to Boxer Property. Since the acquisition occurred, all of the buildings underwent renovations. As of 2007 the office towers had an occupancy rate of around 70 percent. As of that year most of its tenants were professional groups and included 25 law firms, medical users, radio stations, and television stations. As of the same year Westwood College occupied several floors in the complex. By that year $5 million in capital investments had been made to the towers. A total of $6 million was invested into the renovation of the towers. As part of a $1 million renovation, the Arena Theater was scheduled to re-open on November 9, 2007. Arena Theatre Inc. became the new tenant of the theater. As part of the renovation the theater received new carpeting, new lighting and sound systems, repaired seats, modernized toilet facilities, and a video system. The ceiling was altered absorb sound instead of reflecting sound. The operators also planned to hold events in the office tower penthouse.

In 2010, it was included in the SF Masterworks collection. In the novel, an entire city and its residents travel slowly across a supposedly alien planet on railway tracks (it is left unclear to the reader whether it truly is not planet Earth). The city's engineers must work to lay fresh track for the city, and pick up the old track as it moves. Many people are unaware that the city is even moving. A crisis ensues as its population decreases, the people grow unruly, and an obstacle looms ahead.  Plot  The book consists of a prologue and five parts. The first, third and fifth sections are narrated in the first person by the protagonist, Helward Mann; the second follows Helward, but is written in the third person; while the prologue and fourth part center on Elizabeth Khan, also from the third person perspective. Helward lives in a city called \\"Earth\\", which is slowly being winched along at an average speed of 0.1 miles per day (0.16 km per day) on four railroad tracks northward toward an ever- moving, mysterious \\"optimum\\". The city, which Helward estimates is long and no more than high, is not on the planet Earth; the sun is disc shaped, with two spikes extending above and below its center. The city's inhabitants live in the hope of rescue from their lost home world. Upon reaching adulthood at the age of \\"650 miles\\", Helward leaves the cr√®che in which he has been raised and becomes an apprentice Future Surveyor. His guild surveys the land ahead, choosing the best route. The Track Guild tears up the track south of the city to re-lay in the north. Traction is responsible for moving the city, while the Bridge-Builders overcome terrain obstacles. The Barter Guild recruits labourers (\\"tooks\\") from the primitive, poverty-stricken nearby villages they pass, as well as women brought temporarily into the city to help combat the puzzling shortfall of female babies. The Militia provides protection, armed with crossbows, against tooks resentful of the city's hard bargaining and the taking of their women. Only guildsmen (all male) have access to the outside world and are oath-bound to keep what they know a secret; in fact, most people do not even know the city moves. Helward's wife Victoria becomes somewhat resentful when he is reluctant to answer questions about his work. The purpose and organisation of the city is laid out in a document written by the founder: Destaine's Directive, with entries dating from 1987 to 2023. Helward reads it, but it does not satisfy his curiosity as to what the optimum is or why the city continually tries to reach it. When Helward is assigned to escort three women back south to their village, he is astonished by what he learns about the alien nature of the world. As they go further south, the women's bodies become shorter and wider, and they begin to speak faster and in a higher pitch. The terrain itself becomes similarly squashed; mountains now look like hills to Helward. One woman has a male baby who, like Helward, does not change shape. Most frightening of all, the guildsman feels an ever-growing force pulling him southward. The inverted world map, a tractricoid. Abandoning the women, with whom he now cannot even communicate, he returns to the city. There he finds that time runs at a different rate in the south. In the city, several years have passed, during which the tooks have attacked and killed many children, including Helward's son. Victoria had given him up for lost and remarried. When Helward goes to survey the land ahead, he discovers that time passes more quickly in the north. While returning from a negotiation at a settlement, he is followed by Elizabeth Khan, herself a relative newcomer to the village. They talk for a while. When they meet again, she mentions she came from England several months before. He becomes excited, thinking that rescue is finally at hand. She is unable to convince him that they are on Earth. Intrigued, she replaces one of the village women and enters the city, which to her looks like no more than a misshapen office block. Once again, she encounters Helward. Having learned about the city, she leaves to apprise her superiors and to do some research. Two crises strike. After the took attack, it was decided to educate the residents about their situation. This, however, had an unintended effect. Dissidents called the Terminators want to stop moving the city, and are willing to resort to sabotage to achieve their goal. Victoria is one of their leaders. A more imminent problem is a large, unavoidable body of water ahead with no opposite bank visible. Both dilemmas are resolved at a meeting. Elizabeth explains to the citizens their true situation. A global energy crisis (the \\"Crash\\") had devastated civilisation, a disaster from which the world is only gradually emerging. Destaine was a British particle physicist who had discovered a new way to generate power, but nobody took him seriously. The process required a natural component to work. Destaine found one such in China: the optimum. He went there to set up a test generator and was never heard of again. His invention has serious permanent and hereditary side effects, distorting people's perceptions (for example the shape of the Sun) and damaging their DNA so that fewer females are born. After nearly two centuries, the city has reached the coast of Portugal, with only the Atlantic Ocean ahead. Most of the residents are convinced, but to Elizabeth's disappointment, Helward refuses to give up his beliefs.  Critical response  The opening sentence of this novel is \\"I had reached the age of six hundred and fifty miles,\\" which has gathered comment by many readers. Critic Paul Kincaid writes that \\"it has justly become one of the most famous in science fiction.\\" James Timarco says similarly, \\"From the first sentence, 'I had reached the age of 650 miles,' readers are aware that something is deeply wrong about this world. We know it has something to do with the relationship between space and time, but beyond this we can only guess.\\" Nick Owchar, in the Los Angeles Times, writes that a \\"reason for the story's appeal is the way in which Priest, with the novel's very first sentence, immerses us within a strange new reality... Mann's proud declaration about his maturity is a jarring revelation‚Äîtime in this world is measured best by distances.\\" Kincaid, calling the novel \\"one of the key works of postwar British science fiction,\\" writes, \\"The inverted world is one of the few truly original ideas to have been developed in contemporary science fiction. ... In a devastatingly effective coup de th√©√¢tre, Priest produces a final revelation that twists everything that has gone before.\\" Peter Nicholls and John Clute, in The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, write that the novel \\"marked the climax of his career as a writer whose work resembled Genre SF, and remains one of the two or three most impressive pure-sf novels produced in the United Kingdom since World War II; the tractricoid world on which the action takes place is perhaps the strangest planet invented since Mesklin\\" in Hal Clement's 1954 novel Mission of Gravity. They write that the story, dealing with paradoxes of perception and \\"conceptual breakthrough\\" (a key term in science fiction), \\"is a striking addition to that branch of sf which deals with the old theme of appearance-versus-reality.\\" Timarco's review discusses the psychology of the characters and the impact on the reader: Owchar, comparing the setting with other bizarre creations by authors such as Alan Campbell and China Mi√©ville, wonders, Kirkus Reviews wrote, \\"The unwinding of this SF mystery is highly satisfactory, but the clever resolution is slightly deus ex futuristic machina.\\" Awards In 1974 The Inverted World was the winner of the British Science Fiction Association (BSFA), and in 1975 it was nominated for the Hugo Award.  Miscellany  The Making of The Lesbian Horse is a short chapbook (1979) written by Priest as a parody continuation of the book. The cover art for the 1974 Harper & Row edition () was by Andrew M. Stephenson; for the 1975 Popular Library edition by Jack Faragasso.

The City Committee of the Party, the People's Council, and the Vietnamese Fatherland Front chose the date of December 19 as the annual memorial day to recall and be grateful to the dead. Construction of the temple was started on May 19, 1993 on the 103rd birthday of President Ho Chi Minh. It is located on a 7-hectare plot in the historical heritage compound around the C·ªß Chi tunnels. Architecture The Ben Duoc Memorial Temple includes the following items: =Three-door temple gate= Three-door temple gate has the architecture of the traditional style of the country with a line of round pillars, with the yin and yang tile. The gate has the curved designs and patterns of a village entrance but made with new materials. In the middle of three-door temple gate is the signboard \\"Ben Duoc Memorial Temple\\" and on the body of the pillars are the parallel sentences of the poet Bao Dinh Giang: To spread the heart for the whole country, To bring the current of red blood for protecting the country Having the mind to know the merit, sweet-smelling incense is burned one stick, There is always the image in life; the stars are twinkling a thousand years. =The inscription house= The inscription house is a square house with double tile. In the middle is a stone tablet 3m high, 1.7m wide, and 0.25m thick and weighing 3.07 tons. This stone tablet is taken from one block of 18 ton stone from Ngu Hanh Son (Da Nang) and is carved by artisans with all kinds of unique patterns of the country The writing carved on the stone tablet is titled \\"Eternally remember\\" of the poet Vien Phuong, which was chosen from a contest of 217 writings of 29 provinces and cities. =The main temple= The architecture has the solemn and serene air of ancient temples of Vietnam. The worship temple is organized in a U shape: the center is the altar of country, in the middle is the statue of Ho Chi Minh, on the top written: \\"For the country, forger ourselves. Eternally remember.\\" On the left and right are two incense-tables to remember our ancestors, people and unknown soldiers. Along the left wall is the name of dead soldiers of the Party, and the right wall is the name of dead soldiers of the armed forces. The names of dead soldiers are carved into a granite stone tablet with gilded letters. There are 44,520 \\"revolutionary martyrs'\\" names carved in the temple including Vietnamese mothers, \\"heroes\\", and \\"revolutionary martyrs\\", including 9,322 \\"revolutionary martyrs\\" from other provinces and cities. There are three monumental pictures made of china outside the main temple wall, which were made by the University of Fine Arts, expressing the content: People reclaim waste land to establish the country; To give strength to resist against the invaders; Oppressed people rise up to fight to achieve victory. Individuals frequently come to the monument to look for the names of relatives and comrades. The temple management board is able to inform them about places of burial and other details of dead soldiers. =The tower= The tower symbolizes the rise up to the pinnacle of future fame. The tower has 9 floors and is 39m high. On the wall of the tower are many designs to express the life and struggle of the Cu Chi people - \\"an iron bulwark land of revolution\\". On the highest floor of the tower, we can see part of the revolution base from which some places have entered into the history of the Iron Triangle (Tam Gi√°c S·∫Øt) region. =Flower garden= From a region of full of craters stunted and devastated by war, now the Temple has a smooth, nice flower garden year-round with many kinds of precious trees sent as souvenirs by craftsmen and organizations. Notably, the Central, City and Provincial leaders have planted many kinds of precious trees in the flower garden in front of the Temple. The flower garden behind the Temple has the symbol of the spirit of the country. It is made of granite 16m high and weighs 243 tons. The symbol is in the center of the flower garden with its face to the Saigon River. It is expressed by an image of a teardrop, symbolizing the loss and grief of many generations of Vietnamese people who fought to maintain their country. The whole symbol features a lotus flower caressed by a hand, making the visitors remember the lines of two folk songs: Tap Moue the most beautiful thing is lotus flower Vietnam the most beautiful thing is named Uncle Ho On the body of the symbol there are some carvings of Vietnamese historical events from the time of the country's establishment by H√πng V∆∞∆°ng to independence day on April 30, 1975. =Basement= The basement of the temple has nine spaces on the theme of Saigon Cho Lon, resilient and indomitable, presenting the prominent war events of our people and soldiers in the Iron Triangle (Tam Gi√°c S·∫Øt) region in particular and Vietnam in general. They were to protest against the wars of the empire and its supporters. Those events come back to life by some imposing pictures, statues, sand tables, stage models, and sculptures. Each space presents a different historical period. * In the first space: French invader, forget to protect our country. * In the second space: General armed uprising of August 1945 in Saigon-Cho Lon- Gia ƒê·ªãnh. * In the third space: the people and soldiers of Saigon - Cho Lon - Gia ƒê·ªãnh fired the first gun, starting the resistance against the French invasion and determined to protect our independence. * In the fifth space: guerrilla war of rural people in C·ªß Chi, an iron bulwark land of revolution. * In the sixth space: our people and soldiers take to the street, rising up in arms to attack during the Mau Than New Year. * In the seventh space: People and soldiers of Saigon-Cho Lon-Gia ƒê·ªãnh contribute to the victory of Ho Chi Minh's campaign in the spring of 1975. * In the eighth space: for the great signification, take his own body to make a live torch. * In the ninth space: the southern people went first but returned last, for the thirst of peace, unification, independence and freedom. Purpose The B·∫øn D∆∞·ª£c Memorial Temple was made by architects, scientists, historians, politicians, construction engineers and anonymous people, making it a harmony of architecture, people, and the community. It precisely captures the national characteristic of Vietnam while showing its gentle spirit.

She made her first on-screen appearance on 23 April 2010. Character creation and casting In February 2010, former Emmerdale actress Murphy had been cast in the role of Eva, the long-lost biological mother of Anita Roy (Saira Choudhry). Of her casting, a Hollyoaks source said: \\"Bosses have been trying to sign her up for a while now - but she's always put her family first. But after years out of acting, she wants to give it another go. Sheree has started filming scenes and was very nervous being on set again, but she's a professional and has taken to Hollyoaks like a duck to water. She's loving it - and everyone loves having her on the team.\\" Murphy was the first major signing of series producer Paul Marquess, who told entertainment website Digital Spy that Murphy was not cast because of her high-profile. He stated, \\"Casting Sheree Murphy, it was day one and they said: 'We have to cast this today'. They showed me a DVD of six perfectly good actresses, one of whom was Sheree Murphy who I recognised and said, 'Let's have her'. It's as simple as that - I've watched Emmerdale and I know what Sheree can do.\\" In August 2010 it was announced that Murphy had decided not to renew her contract with the serial because she planned to move abroad with her family. An exit storyline was devised for Eva. Her plans later changed and she decided to stay in the UK, Marquess decided to bring Eva back after a short on-screen hiatus, with Murphy agreeing to reprise the role. Of the situation Marquess stated: \\"Sheree will be taking a little break on screen because of her family commitments, but we're already thinking about how we'll bring her back.\\" Storylines Eva arrives in Hollyoaks village and goes to Relish diner. She meets Ravi Roy (Stephen Uppal) and introduces herself as Kate Simpson. She asks Ravi about Hollyoaks High School and he tells her that he has a sister at the school, and Eva realises that Ravi is Anita Roy's adoptive brother. Eva then gives Ravi her phone number. A few weeks later, Eva returned to have a date with Ravi where she met Anita for the first time. However, the date did not go well and Eva decided to run off, with Ravi annoyed thinking he had done something wrong. But her secret did not last when Anita decides to start to look for her birth mother, in which she learns her mother has a market stall in Manchester. Eva is worried, but eventually gets caught out when Anita spots her at her stall. Anita is devastated and Eva tries to explain the situation, but Anita was too hurt to listen to what she had to say and runs off, horrified to learn that her brother's girlfriend is actually her mother and that all that time she did not say anything about it. However, though Eva decided to see Anita again and visited her at work, but Anita is utterly furious to the fact that she never mentioned that she was her mother. After a heart to heart with Dominic Reilly (John Pickard) Anita decided to give Eva another chance. However, Eva was less interested in Anita and telling her that Anita's father was a holiday fling. Eva then meets Jem Costello (Helen Russell-Clarke) and went on a fashion advice with her instead. Anita is deeply frustrated and further upset by this until and to make matters worse, they were interrupted by Anita's best friend Theresa McQueen (Jorgie Porter), who has just avoided a termination of her baby and embraced Anita for comfort. This made Eva feel uncomfortable because to the fact that she gave her baby up for adoption and decided to leave the flat. Eva returned to the village to see Anita once again and they went shopping together after Ravi gave her some money. Anita and Eva eventually struck up a bond. However, Eva always jeopardized things, such as sleeping with Ravi. She and Ravi did this several occasions, much to the annoyance of Anita, who although disgusted at first, soon seemed to accept it. She also kissed Duncan Button, much to the humiliation of Anita; however, Eva could not figure out what she did wrong. Eva got a job as design artist at Hollyoaks High; however, she was fired when headmaster Rob, caught her and Ravi messing around in the art room during her free period. However, after finding out a secret of Rob's, that his wife had taken a baby from the hospital, she helped him cover it up, and then blackmailed him for a better job at the school. She was promoted to personal assistant. In November she catches Anita kissing Bart McQueen in a utility room in the school. She tries to talk to Anita about what she saw, but Anita is embarrassed, so she refuses to talk about it. It was discovered that Eva stole Amber Sharpe's diary, which contained Amber making up fantasies about her and Rob, including pretending that Rob is Amber's unborn child's father. Eva revealed right before her departure that Anita is not her only child. Reception Holy Soap refer to Eva's most memorable moment as when Anita found out that she was her mum.

History The SUMD first sent missionaries to Africa in 1913 with the pioneers being Niels Br√∏nnum, his wife Margaret C. Young, and Dagmar Rose. Br√∏nnum's wife died shortly after arriving and Rose brought back the Br√∏nnum's infant son to Europe. Br√∏nnum continued his work and established a mission in Numan. The mission eventually expanded and in 1948, the first five indigenous Nigerian pastors were ordained. By 1955, it was known as the Lutheran Church of Christ in the Sudan and in 1956 became independent as the Lutheran Church of Christ in Nigeria with Pilgaard Pedersen as its first President (). In 1960, Akila Todi was elected the first indigenous Nigerian president of the Church. He was made bishop in 1973 when the church adopted a modified episcopal polity. Structure The LCCN is led by an archbishop and is further divided into nine dioceses, each led by a bishop. The headquarters of the LCCN is in Numan.

She was the body double for Janet Leigh in the shower scene of the 1960 film Psycho. Early career Renfro, described as a free spirit with a lifelong commitment to nudism, appeared in many men's magazines including Ace, Adam, Beau, Dude, Escapade, Follies, Gala and Modern Man. She also appeared on the cover of the September 1960 edition of Playboy. Renfro spent some time working as a showgirl in Las Vegas, and also worked as a Playboy Bunny. Film career Unperturbed by working nude, Renfro was hired as the body double for the actress Janet Leigh in Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho. She was paid $500. The shower scene in Psycho is considered one of the most famous scenes in cinema history. It features more than 50 camera cuts in three minutes and took six days to film. Although nudity is implied in the rapid cuts, none is seen. Hitchcock and Leigh initially maintained that only Leigh appeared in the shower. Only later did Hitchcock acknowledge that when Leigh's face is seen it is her, otherwise it is Renfro. Although Leigh‚Äôs account of the shower scene says all the actual shower footage in the film was of her and the only time Renfro was used was in an overhead shot that was eventually cut due to censors concerns Renfro subsequently appeared in Francis Ford Coppola's 1962 film Tonight for Sure. Decades later, Renfro was interviewed and featured in 78/52, director Alexandre O. Philippe's 2017 documentary film that examines Psycho and the shower scene. Confusion regarding death During the filming of Psycho, Janet Leigh also had a stand-in to check lighting. Her name was Myra Davis, also known as Myra Jones. In 1988 Davis was raped and murdered by her neighbor and handyman Kenneth Dean Hunt. Possibly due to fascination with the shower scene, sections of the media confused Davis's role and published that she had been Leigh's body double. The BBC went further and not only asserted that Davis was Leigh's body double, but also that Davis was the voice of Norman Bates' mother, although this character had been voiced by Virginia Gregg and Jeanette Nolan. In his 2002 book Body Double, author Don Lasseter compounded the confusion and wrote that Davis and Renfro were the same person, meaning that Renfro was dead. Author Robert Graysmith, who had a lifelong fascination with Renfro, noted a comment by Davis's granddaughter that Davis would never have done nude work. He set out to find Renfro and discovered that she was living in California. He subsequently wrote a book, The Girl in Alfred Hitchcock's Shower (2010), about Renfro's role in Psycho and the confusion over Davis's death. Personal life Renfro married and is known as Marli Renfro Peterson. She has lived in the Mojave Desert since 1970.

All 25 passengers and crew on board the two aircraft were killed. It remains the deadliest accident involving a helicopter on United States soil, surpassing the crash of Los Angeles Airways Flight 841 in 1968, which killed 23 people.  Collision  On the morning of the accident Grand Canyon Airlines Canyon 6 took off from Grand Canyon National Park Airport at 8:55am for a sightseeing flight over Grand Canyon National Park with two pilots and 18 passengers on board; the pilots were operating their second scenic flight for the day. At 9:13am a Bell 206 call sign Tech 2 operated by Helitech took off from the company's heliport in Tusayan, Arizona for a 30-minute sightseeing flight. At approximately 9:33 at an altitude of approximately the Bell 206 and DHC-6 collided, with the helicopter on the left of the Twin Otter and the two aircraft traveling at approximately right angles to each other. The helicopter's main rotor struck the nose landing gear and tail of the Twin Otter. The Bell 206's main rotor was torn off and disintegrated; and the Twin Otter's tail separated; causing both aircraft to crash. All 20 passengers and crew on Canyon 6, and the pilot and four passengers on the Bell 206, were killed in the accident.  Cause  The National Transportation Safety Board found that the crews of the two aircraft failed to 'see and avoid' each other, but could not determine why this occurred due to the lack of recorded flight data (there being no requirement for such recording for the scenic flights that were being operated). The accident investigation also found that the limited number of scenic points of interest in the Grand Canyon concentrated flights over these points, increasing the risk of collision; and recommended that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulate the separation of flight routes of fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. Following the accident the FAA imposed changes to the operation of scenic flights over the Grand Canyon.National Transportation Safety Board report of investigation into mid-air collision over Grand Canyon National Park  See also  * 1956 Grand Canyon mid-air collision  References   External links  * Aviation Safety Network accident synopsis Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in the United States in 1986 Category:Airliner accidents and incidents in Arizona Category:Accidents and incidents involving the de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Bell 206 Category:Mid-air collisions Category:Grand Canyon Airlines accidents and incidents Category:Grand Canyon National Park Category:History of Coconino County, Arizona Category:1986 in Arizona Category:Airliner accidents and incidents involving mid-air collisions Category:June 1986 events in the United States ","title":"Grand Canyon Airlines Flight 6"},{"id":"27087869","text":"Carl Frank Stokes is an American politician who represented the 12th district on the Baltimore City Council.

He grew up in Baltimore's Latrobe housing project and attended parochial schools. He graduated from the Loyola Blakefield high school in 1968 and attended Loyola College. He managed and then owned a retail clothing store before being elected to represent the then second district on the Baltimore City Council in 1987.

A Republican had not won the mayoralty since Theodore McKeldin's second tour as Mayor (1963-1967). Thus the focus in Baltimore was on the Democratic primary. Of the 15, three were considered coequal front runners: Stokes, City Council president Lawrence Bell and then Councilman Martin O'Malley. At one point Stokes enjoyed a slight lead in the polls, but O'Malley, the only white candidate of the three front runners, emerged triumphant. O'Malley garnered 62,711 votes, Stokes finished second with 32,609 votes and Bell placed third with 20,034 votes. =2016= In September 2015, Stokes announced that he would seek the 2016 Democratic nomination for Mayor of Baltimore City.

His work has been seen in avant-garde and mainstream media.  Background and early life  Losey is the son of the film producer Gavrik Losey and the former British ballerina Sally Chesterton, and the grandson of the film director Joseph Losey and the fashion designer Elizabeth Hawes. He is the nephew of the actor, Joshua Losey, and the brother of Marek Losey, who is also a film director. He grew up in Paddington, London, where he attended Hallfield Infants and Junior School in Royal Oak. He then attended Hampstead comprehensive in Camden, North London. Suffering from dyslexia, he left school without qualifications.  Early career  As a child he was obsessed with science fiction. In 1975 a chance viewing of Kubrick's 2001 and the gift of a Brownie camera led to him becoming obsessed with capturing images. After leaving school in 1984 he worked as a runner on film sets and for production companies. He worked on Derek Jarman's film Caravaggio as the floor runner. He spent much of the late 1980s working as an art department runner/assistant on films, music videos and ads. Involvement in the early rave and squatting scene in north London led to him getting involved in lighting and film projection. In the early 1990s he met the electronic band Orbital. With video artist Giles Thacker he created the visual elements of Orbital's live show, a fusion of carefully prepared visuals and lighting that flew in the face of the staid fractal influenced imagery of the day, with wry observations on everyday life. In 1998, Losey co-directed a music video for Orbital's single The Box, which starred Tilda Swinton and was inspired by time-lapse animation. The promo won a silver spire for the Best Short Film at the San Francisco film festival, and was nominated for the best video award at the 1998 MTV awards. It also closed the Edinburgh film festival, opened the London film festival, screened at Sundance and was seen at almost every festival that year. In 1999 Losey created a second music video for Orbital called Style, with Jonathan Charles as director of animation. Style also uses stop motion animation throughout and is a surreal take on Kafka's The Metamorphosis, influenced by the work of Jan ≈†vankmajer. Both The Box and Style continue to be widely shown.Sunday Herald  Later work  Luke directed many music videos in the late 1990s and 2000s, including work for William Orbit (directing the video for his 1999 version of Adagio for Strings) and Mercury Rev. After a period directing TV adverts, Losey moved with his young family to Australia, where he continued to direct and pursue photography. However, he periodically returned to the UK to design live shows for bands, including The Libertines, Turin Brakes, The Verve, and more recently Magazine and Mott the Hoople. In 2009 he shot the video for the cover of Gang of Four's Damaged Goods by Gaz Coombes and Danny Goffey's side project The Hotrats. Luke joined Bare films in May 2013 His most recent commercial work has included a number of internet viral campaigns, a return to photography and advertising work and several short films, most notably i in 2010, a two-minute short of an eyeball featuring industrial sounds, which won the Best Sound Design award at the Hamburg Film Festival and was shown at the Rushes Short Film Festival and the Ann Arbor Film Festival, and The Promise in 2011, also shown at the Ann Arbor Film festival. The Promise garnered critical acclaim but its dark subject matter ‚Äì a slow-motion depiction of a woman being executed ‚Äì limited its distribution. Losey, who is now UK based, exhibited work at the Latitude Contemporary Art Exhibition in 2010. Recently he directed a major 3D advertisement for Ralph Lauren and viral/cinema ads for Mulberry and Nokia. In late 2013 he directed a short teaser film of Jessica Albarn's fairy tale book The Boy in the Oak. The film was narrated by Jude Law with music by Damon Albarn. A script is in development from an idea by Losey called the 'Boy who loved dinosaurs', written by Klaus Fried. Part ghost story, part road-movie, this is the redemptive tale of a metaphysical connection between two men a continent apart and the tragedy that bonds them. Losey is currently researching a drama called Subject 8Subject 8 with producer Liam Garvo and Coral Bark Productions, penned by Justin Villiers.Coral Bark Productions This short film will be set in 1975 and explores the rise and fall of the Institute for Neurological Research, Leningrad. In the 1950s the institute was the world's leading research facility for ESP and parapsychology, but in the mid 1970s, after years of insupportable claims, the institute was discredited and fell into decline.

Retrieved 28 August 2014 Dampier was born in Horsham, Sussex, England, the son of John Dampier, a builder, and his wife Mary, n√©e Daly. Dampier had a stage career in Manchester before moving to Melbourne, Australia in 1873, under contract to the Harwood syndicate, consisting of H. R. Harwood, George Coppin, Richard Stuart (father of Nellie Stuart), and John Hennings, managers of Melbourne's Theatre Royal. His first role was as Mephistopheles in his own adaptation of Goethe's Faust, followed by leading roles in Shakespearean dramas. After three years he undertook his own management and toured major towns in Australia and New Zealand, followed by America and England. On his return to Australia, Dampier formed his own company, often producing plays with an Australian theme. He staged five plays by F. R. C. Hopkins between 1876 and 1882, and adapted For the Term of His Natural Life (1886), Robbery Under Arms (1890), and The Miner's Right (1891). The two roles with which Dampier was most associated were Jean Valjean in Valjean, an adaptation of Les Mis√©rables, and Captain Starlight in Robbery Under Arms.Richard Fotheringham, \\"Introduction\\", Robbery Under Arms by Alfred Dampier and Garnet Walch, Currency Press 1985 p14 Dampier died at his resident in Paddington, Sydney on 23 May 1908. Family Dampier was survived by his wife, one son and two daughters. His daughter Lily Dampier was a noted actor in her own right, and married actor and director Alfred Rolfe, who adapted several of Dampier's plays to the screen. Lily Dampier died in 1915. Dampier's wife died shortly afterwards from a stroke while touring America with her other daughter Rose and son Fred. Rose Dampier died while on tour in Nebraska in 1919. Dampier's son Fred was also an actor although he was never as successful as his father, sisters or brother in law. Fred had a secret marriage to another actor, Vera in 1905.

Jose of Yokereth (, read as Yossi deman Yoqart) was a Jewish Amora sage of the Land of Israel, of the third generation of the Amora era. His surname ◊ô◊ï◊ß◊®◊™ (Yoqart or Yokereth) is of an unknown source, and most likely has been bastardized over the years, although many attribute it to the now and then Iqrit village, known in Hebrew as ◊ô◊ï◊ß◊®◊™ (Yokereth or Yoqart).◊ò◊ô◊ï◊ú ◊ú◊ó◊ï◊®◊ë◊™ ◊ì◊ï◊®, ◊ô◊ì◊ô◊¢◊ï◊™ ◊ê◊ó◊®◊ï◊†◊ï◊™, ◊ò◊ô◊ï◊ú◊ô◊ù ◊ë◊ê◊®◊• Biography He was the Rabbi of R. Jose ben Abin. In the Talmud there are two stories concerning his piousness that reached to such an extent that he was cruel to his own children over it. One story concerns his son, who miraculously caused a tree to produce fruit out of season to feed his laborers. When his father learned of it, he was furious, and said to him: \\"My son, you have troubled your Creator to cause the fig tree to bring forth its fruits before its time, may you too be taken hence before your time!\\".Babylonian Talmud, Taanit 24a The other story concerns his beautiful daughter. Once R. Yokereth caught a man trying to glance at his daughter from a hiding place. Replying to the questioning of Yokereth, he said: \\"Master, if I am not worthy enough to marry her, may I not at least be worthy to catch a glimpse of her?\\"; then R. Yokereth exclaimed: \\"My daughter, you are a source of trouble to mankind; return to the dust so that men may not sin because of you\\". This zealotry led his own student R. Jose ben Abin to abandon him, and go acquire education from Rav Ashi. An additional miraculous story concerning R. Yokereth is recorded. He used to rent his donkey to people, and at the end of each working day it would return by itself, with its salary laid on its back. One day, the renters forgot two of their sandals on its back. The donkey, not wanting to steal, did not move until the sandals were retrieved.

It was released in 1977 and includes the single \\"Flammende Herzen\\" b/w \\"Karussell\\". The music was used the following year to soundtrack Flaming Hearts. It was Rother's first solo venture after having recorded five albums prior as a member of Neu! with Klaus Dinger and Harmonia with Hans-Joachim Roedelius and Dieter Moebius. The album was recorded between June and September 1976 in Germany at Conny's Studio. Receiving positive reviews the album was released as an LP in March 1977 before it was re-released by Polydor in 1982. The album was reissued on CD in 1990, before being re-issued again in 1993 with bonus tracks and having been remastered. The artwork for the album was designed by Rike with photography by Christian Rabe and Ann. Recording and music Following the disbandment of Neu! having released their third studio album Neu! '75 in 1975, Rother worked again with Neu! and Harmonia producer Conny Plank on his first solo album. Jaki Liebezeit from Can augmented Rother on drums. Aside from Liebezeit, the entirety of the album was written and performed by Rother utilising guitar, bass guitar, electric piano, organ, synthesizer and electronic percussion. In contrast to Rother's work with his former groups, the album was completely instrumental and instead he performs the majority of the melodies using his guitar. On completion of the sessions Rother re-united with Cluster members Hans-Joachim Roedelius and Dieter Moebius and former-Roxy Music member and solo artist Brian Eno to record a third Harmonia album in Forst in 1976. The studio sessions were productive but the recordings were left unreleased until November 1997 when they were released as Tracks and Traces and credited to 'Harmonia 76'. Releases Flammende Herzen was first released on Sky Records as an LP in 1977. The album has been re-released several times, again as an LP on Polydor after Rother joined the label in 1982, then as a CD on Polygram in 1990. In 1993, Rother secured the rights to his back catalogue and re-issued all of his solo albums with bonus tracks and remastered sound on his own label, Random Records. In 2000, Rother re-issued all of the albums again in partnership between Random Records and BSC Music. Expanded editions include two versions of the title track recorded in the 1990s, \\"Vorbei (Flammende Herzen - Chill Remix 1993)\\" and \\"Flammende Herzen - Film Remix 1993\\" with Joachim Rudolph on drums, bass, and co-remixing. The album has since been released in the US on Water Records and as a heavyweight 180 gram LP on the 4 Men With Beards imprint.

A progressive activist, Bucholz is a member of Marx21, a network of revolutionary socialists within the Die Linke broadly aligned with the International Socialist Tendency. Education and early career From 1991 to 1998, Buchholz studied education and social sciences with a focus on politics and religion at the University of Hamburg. After the state examination she took up a supplementary study of science history. Since 1995 she has also worked in Hamburg and Berlin as an assistant for people with disabilities. From 1997 to 2001 she was a member of the works council in a Hamburg nursing company. She was certified as √∂tv - Vertrauensfrau (trusted woman) and is a member of the union ver.di. From 2002 she worked as a freelance editor and from 2005 to 2009 as a research assistant to a member of the left parliamentary group Linksfraktion. Political career Since the early 1990s she has been active in the antifascist scene. In 1994 she became a member of the Trotskyist organization Linksruck. From 1994 to 1999 she was a member of the SPD. She was active early in the anti-globalization movement and became a member of Attac. She was one of the organizers of the European Social Forum, the Social Forum in Germany and the protests against the G8 summit in Heiligendamm (2007). She participated in the organization and implementation of the Blockupy protests against \\"banking power and the austerity of the EU troika\\". In the Bundestag she spoke against austerity, the European Stability Mechanism and the European Fiscal Compact. Buchholz proposed in early 2013 that politicians of the other two (former) opposition parties SPD and Greens should seek political compromises. With a view to the federal election in 2013 (and apparently on the subject of a red-red-green coalition), she said that there is no substantive basis for a government participation because of the support of foreign operations of the Bundeswehr and the approval of Angela Merkel's EU austerity. Through her membership in Linksruck (dissolved in 2007) she joined the WASG, whose extended federal board she belonged from spring 2005. In March 2007, she was elected to the executive WASG board. Since the Unification Party Convention on 16 June 2007 she is a member of the executive party executive committee of the left, where she is responsible for peace and disarmament. Buchholz is (as of 2008) a supporter of the Trotskyist organization Marx21 within Die Linke and was the author of the magazine of the same name. Buchholz is considered a protagonist of the left party wing within the party Die Linke. In 2011, she criticized the attempt by reformers such as Stefan Liebich to change the foreign policy foundations of the party.

They announced that Decade would be 'the best of' the performances. On May 5, 2010, the album was made available for pre-order with a T-shirt, poster, and signed laminate. They also announced that it would be over 2 hours long, contain 22 tracks, unseen backstage footage, and every music video including the upcoming video for \\"American Dream\\". Decade Singles was released on June 1 and contained \\"Smile in Your Sleep\\" and \\"Born Dead\\" (featuring Scott Wade). The album was mixed by Cameron Webb. This was their last release on Victory Records before signing with Hopeless Records later that year.

After the election, the composition of the council was *Conservative 17 *Liberal Democrat 10 *Community Campaign (Hart) 6 *Independent 2 Campaign 12 seats were being contested in the election with the Conservatives defending 6 seats, the Liberal Democrats 5 and the Community Campaign (Hart) 1 seat. In total there were 30 candidates standing in the election with the Conservatives the only party to stand in all of the seats. Other candidates included 10 from the Liberal Democrats, 5 from Labour, 2 Community Campaign (Hart) and 1 from the British National Party. Before the election a coalition of the Liberal Democrats, Community Campaign (Hart) and the 2 independents ran the council with the Conservatives forming the opposition. Issues in the election included facilities for teenagers, cleaner streets, recycling and reducing crime. The Conservatives wanted to improve the value for money the council produced, develop the infrastructure for new housing and to keep roads in good condition. However the Liberal Democrats pledged to improve recycling, get more affordable housing and keep crime levels low. During the campaign the national Conservative leader, David Cameron, visited the area to campaign for the party. Election result The results saw the council remain with no party having a majority, but with the Conservatives gaining 2 seats to hold 17 of the 35 seats. Both Conservative gains came from the Liberal Democrats, taking Fleet Courtmoor by 391 votes and Fleet Pondtail by 493 votes. The Conservatives won 60% of the vote and claimed a mandate to take control of the council. However the 2 independents held the balance of power between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrat/Community Campaign (Hart) alliance. Overall turnout in the election was 36.9%. At the annual council meeting after the election the Conservatives took control of the council. Their leader Ken Crookes won 18 votes compared to 17 for Liberal Democrat leader David Neighbour, with 1 of the 2 independents, Susan Band, backing the Conservatives. The other independent, Denis Gotel, and the Community Campaign (Hart) backed the Liberal Democrat leader. As a result, the council cabinet was made up of all Conservatives, except for independent Susan Band who would continue to be responsible for housing and health.

All 157 people onboard flight 1103 were killed, while the crew of the MiG-23 ejected and survived. It was the deadliest aviation disaster to occur in Libya at the time. Crash On 22 December 1992 Flight 1103 took off from Benina International Airport near Benghazi on a domestic flight to Tripoli International Airport. At an altitude of during the Boeing 727's approach to Tripoli airport, the aircraft collided with an Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 and disintegrated, resulting in the death of all 157 passengers and crew. The two crew members of the MiG-23 ejected before impact and survived. Investigation and aftermath The official explanation and air accident investigation report both blamed a collision with a Libyan Air Force MiG-23; the pilot and instructor of the MiG were imprisoned. After the crash, a spokesman for the Libyan Civil Authority stated he had been forbidden from releasing any information about the crash, including which planes had been involved. A mass grave was prepared for the victims outside of Tripoli with poor international relations denying the bodies of international victims being returned to their families. Twenty years later, after the fall of Muammar Gaddafi, Abdel Majid Tayari, the instructor in the MiG-23 aircraft, challenged the official version of events, claiming that Flight 1103 was deliberately destroyed, because he saw its tail falling before his aircraft suffered a strong impact (from either the shock wave of the explosion that destroyed the Boeing 727 or a piece of wreckage) and he was forced to eject from his aircraft along with his trainee. In a statement Majid Tayari claims there was no air collision, but conceded that the planes were too close to one another. Ali Aujali, who served as a Libyan diplomat both under Gaddafi and under the National Transitional Council, claims that Gaddafi ordered that the Boeing 727, whose flight was assigned the number 1103, be shot down exactly four years to the day after the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in order to demonstrate the negative effects of international sanctions imposed on Libya. According to Aujali, the dictator originally ordered a bomb with a timer to be in the aircraft, but when this failed to explode, he \\"ordered the [aircraft] to be knocked out of the sky\\". The widow of one British victim has claimed Libyan families of victims had asked if she had tested her husband's passports for explosive residue. Numerous theories follow the idea that Gaddafi had a hand in the crash, with claims that Gaddafi exploited the accident and used it as propaganda against sanctions from the Pan Am Flight 103 crash.  Memorials  The first memorial for the crash was held near Tripoli, Libya in 2012. The ceremony was attended by families and friends of the victims, and politicians.

Listed at 5' 8\\", 138 lb., Weaver batted and threw right-handed. She was born in Metropolis, Illinois. Her sisters Betty and Joanne also played in the league.The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League: A Biographical Dictionary - W. C. Madden. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2005. Format: Paperback, 295pp. Language: English. Jean was one of the famous Weaver sisters of the Fort Wayne Daisies during the last years of the All- American Girls Professional Baseball League. Her older sister Betty won the batting title in both 1950 and 1951, and earned the Most Valuable Player award in 1952. Younger sister Joanne took three consecutive batting titles from 1952 to 1954, the last with a season-record .429 average which gave her MVP honors. Jean was a dependable utility with good instincts for the game. She played three years for the Daisies, appearing as a backup at third base and in outfield and occasionally coming out for pitching. Her most productive season came in 1953, when she posted a 7‚Äì1 record in 20 games and hit a solid .313 average. The Daisies reached the playoffs in the years in which she played for them, but were beaten in the last round. After the league disbanded in 1954, Jean Weaver lived in Chicago, Illinois, for over forty years. In November 1988, the three sisters received recognition when the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York dedicated a permanent display to the entire league rather than any individual player. In 1995 Jean moved back to her hometown of Metropolis, Illinois, to be with her parents, former inor league ballplayer Lloyd Weaver and Elsie (Dummeier) Weaver.Jeanne Weaver obituary (Paducah Sun) Joanne returned in 1990, while Betty came back in 1994. The three sisters were able to see each other every day. Betty died in 1998, following complications related to Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease), and Joanne died in 2000 of the same disease that claimed her sister. Eight years later, Jean died in her hometown at the age of 74.

T. MacCargo (though not all of the latter's books were by him). Rabe was the author of over 30 books, mostly of crime fiction, published between 1955 and 1975. Origins Born Peter Rabinowitsch on November 3, 1921, to Michael Rabinovitch (a Russian Jew; the spelling is the Russian version) and Elisabeth Margarete Beer, in Halle, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. Shortly after his birth the family moved to Hanover, Germany, where Peter's father worked as a doctor and surgeon. When the Nazis came to power and summoned Michael Rabinovitch to a Gestapo office and confronted him with transcripts of political conversations between him and his patients, he decided it best to emigrate to the United States before Peter turned 15 and face possible internment. Michael also had his doctor's license revoked by the Nazis. Michael and Peter left a few months before Kristallnacht in October, 1938, sponsored by Michael's brother Robert Rubin, and they lived with the Rubin family in Detroit, Michigan. At Rubin's suggestion, Michael changed the family name to \\"Rabe,\\" by combining his name (the \\"Ra\\" from Rabinovitch) and his wife's maiden name (the \\"Be\\" from Beer). He took over the practice of a retiring obstetrician in New Bremen, Ohio, a German American town. Margarete, a Lutheran, brought her other two sons, Valentin and Andreas, on the last ship of refugees before World War II broke out in 1940. Education Peter earned his bachelor's degree from Ohio State University, then served a stint in the Army. He attended Western Reserve University in Cleveland and was awarded a master's degree and a Ph.D. in psychology. Early career While at Western Reserve, Rabe met Claire Frederickson, also a psychology student and member of a family who had left Europe ahead of the Nazis. Claire introduced Peter to fellow student Max Gartenberg, who would eventually become Peter's literary agent. Claire and Peter married and moved to Bar Harbor, Maine, where Peter worked as a researcher for Claire's brother, Emil Frederickson. Peter was uncomfortable experimenting on animals and after the project ended the couple moved to Los Angeles to try to establish Peter as a therapist. It was hard to break in and after a short time the couple returned to Cleveland. Peter did blue-collar work in a factory but was soon asked to work on the company's advertising layouts. This work served him well as Peter used these skills to write and illustrate his first book, From Here to Maternity (Vanguard Press, 1955; originally appeared in McCall's Magazine, September 1954, as \\"Who's Having This Baby?\\"), a humorous look at the birth of his and Claire's first son, Jonathan, born April 5, 1953. Crime fiction After his first book, Rabe wrote almost exclusively crime fiction, the exceptions being three soft core books for Beacon in the early sixties, and a novelization of the war movie Tobruk for Bantam in 1967. In an essay included in the book Murder off the Rack, edited by Jon L. Breen,Murder Off the Rack by Jon L. Breen, Scarecrow Press, 1989 Donald E. Westlake opens with the line, \\"Peter Rabe wrote the best books with the worst titles of anybody I can think of.\\" When Gold Medal changed the titles of Rabe's first two books from The Ticker and The Hook to Stop This Man! and Benny Muscles In, a pattern was set that would last throughout his career. Stop This Man! appeared in August, 1955 (Gold Medal 506), followed closely by Benny Muscles In (Gold Medal 520, September, 1955), and A Shroud for Jesso (Gold Medal 528, October, 1955). Clearly capable of writing books quickly, Rabe published eighteen books by 1961. In 1962 came one of his best books, The Box (one of only two Rabe books to use his own titles, the other being A House in Naples). Then there were the three soft core books for Beacon, the last two under the pseudonym of Marco Malaponte. After this came the three books about his second series character, Manny DeWitt, the novelization of Tobruk, and then the final books to appear under his own name. These were a pair of Mafia related books, again for Gold Medal (War of the Dons (Gold Medal M2592, 1972), and Black Mafia (Gold Medal M2939). The last books Rabe published before he backed off from his writing career were novelizations of episodes of the television series \\"Mannix\\" using the pseudonym \\"J. T. MacCargo.\\" This was apparently a house name for Belmont, with an unknown author penning the first and third books of the series. Rabe wrote the second and fourth books, A Fine Day for Dying and Round Trip to Nowhere, both appearing in 1975. They were the last of his books to be published in his lifetime. Non-writing life In the late '50s, Rabe had gastro-intestinal problems that led to a mis-diagnosis of terminal cancer. He moved to Europe for treatment where his marriage eventually ended and he moved back to the United States. He had met Lorenzo Semple, Jr. in Spain and later, after Semple began work for the Batman television series, Rabe wrote two episodes: \\"The Joker's Last Laugh\\" and \\"The Joker's Epitaph.\\" He went on to two other marriages, neither of which lasted, and left the writing life to become a teacher of psychology at California Polytechnic State University. His only other children were also with Claire, who published some fiction of her own in the 1960s, later collected in 1989's Sicily Enough and More. Also in the 1980s Black Lizard began reprinting some of Rabe's earlier classics. Beginning in 2003, Stark House Press has been reprinting Rabe works in two for one trade paperback editions. Rabe settled down in Atascadero, California until his death from lung cancer on May 20, 1990. Other work Although Rabe left the writing life for his teaching career, he didn‚Äôt stop writing. This led to two unpublished novels probably written between 1987 and 1990, The Return of Marvin Palaver and The Silent Wall. Shortly before his death, Rabe had sent these to writer Ed Gorman in an effort to see them published and in 2010, both works will appear in a single volume from Stark House Press. Rabe may only have written two short stories in his career. One, ‚ÄúHard Case Redhead,‚Äù is an excellent story with a debatable ending, hard core and noirish up to its final paragraph, which gives us an almost Hitchcockian twist ending. The other, \\"A Matter of Balance,\\" is a perfectly titled story of two soldiers, each a cipher to the other, pushed together in what for one is an impossible situation. The emotional buttons Rabe pushes, the real contrast between the characters, and the morally and thematically ambiguous ending make it a nearly pitch perfect telling. He also contributed two scripts to the \\"Batman\\" television series (see above). Writing style Rabe had a clear and lucid style, and other than his series books, never wrote to formula or wrote the same book over and over. He wrote straight Gold Medal-type books such as Stop This Man!, Journey Into Terror, and Mission for Vengeance, as well as books that showed a lighter touch (Murder Me for Nickels, The Return of Marvin Palaver), dark and almost brooding (A House in Naples, The Silent Wall), and brilliant character studies of underworld figures (The Box, Benny Muscles In, Anatomy of a Killer). He was a subtle writer, and the dialogue and choices made by his characters show them off in unusual ways, often with seemingly unpredictable behavior that turns out to be entirely consistent with who they are as well as the plot of the book. He zigs when most writers would zag which makes even his stock characters interesting.

Overview It is the first signing of pet law since the Protection of Animals Act 1911, which it largely replaced. It also superseded and consolidated more than 20 other pieces of legislation, such as the Protection of Animals Act 1934 and the Abandonment of Animals Act 1960. The Act introduced the new welfare offence. This means that animal owners have a positive duty It outlaws tail docking of dogs for cosmetic reasons, with an exemption for \\"working\\" dogs, such as those used by the police, the armed forces or as service dogs. The corresponding Act for Scotland is the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006. Sections The Act is divided into several topics. Section 1 defines an \\"animal\\" as a vertebrate (other than a human) from the sub-phylum vertebrata of the phylum chordata. A \\"protected\\" animal is defined in s2 as one that is either commonly domesticated or one that is, at the time being, under the control of a person. The act also defines the five \\"welfare needs\\" *need for a suitable environment *need for a suitable diet *need to be able to exhibit normal behaviour patterns (such as exercise) *need to be housed with, or apart, from other animals *need to be protected from pain, suffering, injury and disease. =Prevention of Harm= Offences include: * causing a protected animal to suffer unnecessarily knowing it would suffer ‚Äì s4(1) * unreasonably allowing an animal in that person's care to suffer from somebody else ‚Äì s4(2) * mutilating an animal (except where destroying an animal in an appropriate and humane manner) ‚Äì s5 * docking a dog's tail where prohibited ‚Äì s6(1), s6(2), s6(3) * shows a dog with an illegally docked tail at a dog show with fee-paying patrons ‚Äì s6(9) * administers a poison to an animal (or permits to be administered) ‚Äì s7(1), s7(2) * animal fighting ‚Äì s8 ** causes an animal to fight ** receives money from admission to or publicises an animal fight ** provides information about an animal fight to another to enable or encourage attendance ** makes a bet as to the outcome of an animal fight ** takes part in an animal fight ** trains an animal to take part in a fight ** keeps any animal fighting premises ** attends an animal fight (without lawful excuse) ** possesses a recording of an animal fight that took place in the UK (without lawful excuse) with intent to supply ** shows another person a recording of an animal fight that took place in the UK (without lawful excuse) =Promotion of Welfare= A person has a duty of care towards animals that person is responsible for ‚Äì s9(1). Needs include suitable environment, diet, being housed with or apart from other animals, protection from pain, suffering, injury and disease. Animals cannot be sold to children under 16 years outside a family context ‚Äì s11(1), s11(6). Animals cannot be given as prizes to children under 16 years ‚Äì s11(3)(b). =Licensing and Registration= An appropriate national authority can make regulations regarding the licence and registration of animals. =Codes of Practice= An appropriate national authority may issue and revise codes of practice for providing practical guidance in respect to any provision in this Act ‚Äì s14(1). Failing to comply with a code of practice's provision will not, of itself, render that person liable to proceedings of any kind. However such failure to comply may sway proceedings under other provisions in the Act ‚Äì s14(3), s14(4). Where the Secretary of State proposes to issue or revise a code of practice he must submit it to Parliament and if the draft is rejected by one House within 40 days the Secretary of State must take no further action ‚Äì s15(3). If both Houses reject the draft then the Secretary of State may amend the draft and re-submit ‚Äì s15(4). =Animals in Distress= An inspector may take steps felt to be immediately necessary to alleviate an animal that is suffering ‚Äì s18(1) but this does not include destroying the animal ‚Äì s18(2). An inspector or constable may destroy a protected animal if: * a veterinary surgeon certifies it is in its own interests ‚Äì s18(3) * there is no reasonable alternative to destroying it and it is not reasonably practical to wait for a veterinary surgeon ‚Äì s18(4) An inspector or constable may take into possession a protected animal if: * a veterinary surgeon certifies it is suffering or likely to suffer ‚Äì s18(5) * the animal appears to be suffering (or is likely to) and the need for action is such it is not practical to wait for a veterinary surgeon ‚Äì 18(6) If an animal is destroyed or taken into possession and the owner doesn't know ‚Äì then steps should be reasonably taken to notify the owner ‚Äì s18(11). Deliberately obstructing somebody in performance of this section of the Act is an offence ‚Äì s18(12). An inspector or constable may enter premises (other than areas of private dwelling) for the purpose of searching for a protected animal and reasonably believes that a protected animal is on the premises and the animal is suffering or likely to suffer ‚Äì s19(1), s19(2). This entry may take place without a warrant using force if the entry appears required before a warrant could be obtained ‚Äì s19(3). A court has the following powers to make orders in relation to possessed animals ‚Äì s20(1): * specified treatment be administered to the animal * possession should be given to a specified person * the animal should be sold * the destruction of the animal The court will not make such orders until it has given the owner of the animal an opportunity to be heard or is satisfied that it is not practical to communicate with the owner ‚Äì s20(4). If the court requires a person to reimburse the expenses of carrying out an order that person may appeal to the Crown Court against that expense order ‚Äì s21(6). =Enforcement Powers= A constable may seize an animal in relation to an animal fighting offence ‚Äì s22(1). A constable may enter and search premises (except for private dwelling areas) for the seizure of an animal related to a fighting offence if he reasonably believes there is an animal on the premises ‚Äì s22(2). Suspicion of other offences in this Act may lead to a warrant being issued authorising an inspector or constable to search for evidence of such an offence ‚Äì s23(1). An inspector may require the holder of a licence to produce any records which are required to be kept ‚Äì s25(1).

The Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act (introduced as Arizona Senate Bill 1070 and thus often referred to simply as Arizona SB 1070) is a 2010 legislative Act in the U.S. state of Arizona that at the time of passage in 2010 was the broadest and strictest anti‚Äìillegal immigration measure passed in the United States. It has received international attention and has spurred considerable controversy. U.S. Federal law requires aliens older than 18 to possess any certificate of alien registration issued to him or her at all times; violation of this requirement is a federal misdemeanor crime. The Arizona act additionally made it a state misdemeanor crime for an alien to be in Arizona without carrying the required documents, and required that state law enforcement officers attempt to determine an individual's immigration status during a \\"lawful stop, detention or arrest\\" when there is reasonable suspicion that the individual is an illegal immigrant.Police may \\"transport\\" said alien to a federal facility \\"in this state or any other point\\" where such a facility exists. Arizona HB 2162, ¬ß3. The law barred state or local officials or agencies from restricting enforcement of federal immigration laws, and imposed penalties on those sheltering, hiring and transporting unregistered aliens. The paragraph on intent in the legislation says it embodies an \\"attrition through enforcement\\" doctrine.Arizona SB 1070, ¬ß1. Critics of the legislation say it encourages racial profiling, while supporters say the law prohibits the use of race as the sole basis for investigating immigration status. The law was modified by Arizona House Bill 2162 within a week of its signing with the goal of addressing some of these concerns. There have been protests in opposition to the law in over 70 U.S. cities, including boycotts and calls for boycotts of Arizona. The Act was signed into law by Governor Jan Brewer on April 23, 2010. It was scheduled to go into effect on July 29, 2010, ninety days after the end of the legislative session. Legal challenges over its constitutionality and compliance with civil rights law were filed, including one by the United States Department of Justice, that also asked for an injunction against enforcement of the law. The day before the law was to take effect, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction that blocked the law's most controversial provisions. In June 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on the case Arizona v. United States, upholding the provision requiring immigration status checks during law enforcement stops but striking down three other provisions as violations of the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.  Provisions  U.S. federal law requires aliens 14 years old or older who are in the country for longer than 30 days to register with the U.S. government and have registration documents in their possession at all times. The Act makes it a state misdemeanor crime for an illegal alien to be in Arizona without carrying the required documentsArizona SB 1070, ¬ß3. and obligates police to make an attempt, when practicable during a \\"lawful stop, detention or arrest\\", to determine a person's immigration status if there is reasonable suspicion that the person is an illegal alien.Arizona SB 1070, ¬ß2. Any person arrested cannot be released without confirmation of the person's legal immigration status by the federal government pursuant to ¬ß 1373(c) of Title 8 of the United States Code. A first offense carries a fine of up to $100, plus court costs, and up to 20 days in jail; subsequent offenses can result in up to 30 days in jailArizona HB 2162, ¬ß4. (SB 1070 required a minimum fine of $500 for a first violation, and for a second violation a minimum $1,000 fine and a maximum jail sentence of 6 months).Arizona SB 1070, ¬ß5. A person is \\"presumed to not be an immigrant who is unlawfully present in the United States\\" if he or she presents any of the following four forms of identification: a valid Arizona driver license; a valid Arizona nonoperating identification license; a valid tribal enrollment card or other tribal identification; or any valid federal, state, or local government-issued identification, if the issuer requires proof of legal presence in the United States as a condition of issuance. The Act also prohibits state, county, and local officials from limiting or restricting \\"the enforcement of federal immigration laws to less than the full extent permitted by federal law\\" and provides that any legal Arizona resident can sue the agencies or officials in question to compel such full enforcement. If the person who brings suit prevails, that person may be entitled to reimbursement of court costs and reasonable attorney fees. In addition, the Act makes it a crime for anyone, regardless of citizenship or immigration status, to hire or to be hired from a vehicle which \\"blocks or impedes the normal movement of traffic.\\" Vehicles used in such manner are subject to mandatory immobilization or impoundment. Moreover, for a person in violation of a criminal law, it is an additional offense to transport an illegal alien \\"in furtherance\\" of the illegal alien's unauthorized presence in the U.S., to \\"conceal, harbor or shield\\" an illegal alien, or to encourage or induce an illegal alien to immigrate to the state, if the person \\"knows or recklessly disregards the fact\\" that the alien is in the U.S. without authorization or that immigration would be illegal. Violation is a class 1 misdemeanor if fewer than ten illegal aliens are involved, and a class 6 felony if ten or more are involved. The offender is subject to a fine of at least $1,000 for each illegal alien involved. The transportation provision includes exceptions for child protective services workers, and ambulance attendants and emergency medical technicians. =Arizona HB 2162= On April 30, 2010, the Arizona legislature passed and Governor Brewer signed, House Bill 2162, which modified the Act that had been signed a week earlier, with the amended text stating that \\"prosecutors would not investigate complaints based on race, color or national origin.\\" The new text also states that police may only investigate immigration status incident to a \\"lawful stop, detention, or arrest\\", lowers the original fine from a minimum of $500(?) to a maximum of $100, and changes incarceration limits for first-time offenders from 6 months to 20 days. Background and passage Arizona is the first state to enact such far-reaching legislation. Prior law in Arizona, like the law in most other states, does not mandate that law enforcement personnel ask about the immigration status of those they encounter. Many police departments discourage such inquiries to avoid deterring immigrants from reporting crimes and cooperating in other investigations. Arizona had an estimated 460,000 illegal aliens in April 2010, a figure that had increased fivefold since 1990. As the state with the most illegal crossings of the Mexico ‚Äì United States border, its remote and dangerous deserts are the unlawful entry point for thousands of illegal Mexicans and Central Americans. By the late 1990s, Tucson Border Patrol Sector had become the location for the most number of arrests by the United States Border Patrol. Whether illegal aliens commit a disproportionate number of crimes is uncertain, with different authorities and academics claiming that the rate for this group was the same, greater, or less than that of the overall population. The decreased rate in property crimes was noted in a correction on June 27, 2010. There was also anxiety that the Mexican Drug War, which had caused thousands of deaths, would spill over into the U.S. Moreover, by the late 2000s (decade) Phoenix was seeing an average of one kidnapping per day, earning it the reputation as America's worst city in that regard. Arizona has a history of passing restrictions on illegal immigration, including legislation in 2007 that imposed heavy sanctions on employers hiring illegal aliens. Measures similar to SB 1070 had been passed by the legislature in 2006 and 2008, only to be vetoed by Democratic Governor Janet Napolitano. She was subsequently appointed as Secretary of Homeland Security in the Obama administration and was replaced by Republican Secretary of State of Arizona Jan Brewer. There is a similar history of referenda, such as the Arizona Proposition 200 (2004) that have sought to restrict illegal aliens' use of social services. The 'attrition through enforcement' doctrine is one that think tanks such as the Center for Immigration Studies have been supporting for several years. State Senator Russell Pearce, sponsor of the bill Impetus for SB 1070 is attributed to shifting demographics leading to a larger Hispanic population, increased drugs- and human smuggling-related violence in Mexico and Arizona, and a struggling state economy and economic anxiety during the late-2000s recession. State residents were also frustrated by the lack of federal progress on immigration, which they viewed as even more disappointing given that Napolitano was in the administration. The major sponsor of, and legislative force behind, the bill was State Senator Russell Pearce, who had long been one of Arizona's most vocal opponents of illegal aliens and who had successfully pushed through several prior pieces of tough legislation against those he termed \\"invaders on the American sovereignty\\". Much of the drafting of the bill was done by Kris Kobach, a professor at the University of Missouri‚ÄìKansas City School of Law and a figure long associated with the Federation for American Immigration Reform who had written immigration-related bills in many other parts of the country. Pearce and Kobach had worked together on past legislative efforts regarding immigration, and Pearce contacted Kobach when he was ready to pursue the idea of the state enforcing federal immigration laws. A December 2009 meeting of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) in Washington, D.C., resulted in that body drafting model legislation that embodied the ideas that Pearce presented. (One theory explaining the impetus behind the bill was that ALEC is largely funded by contributions of corporate members and among those members are several companies in the private prisons industry, such as the Corrections Corporation of America, Management and Training Corporation, and GEO Group, and that these companies stood to benefit by a large increase in the number of illegal aliens being sent to jail. Pearce later denied that he created the bill for any reason other than stopping illegal immigration and denied that he submitted the idea to ALEC for any reason other than helping it pass in Arizona and, potentially, in other states.) The proposed bill reached the Arizona legislature in January 2010 and gained 36 cosponsors. The Arizona State Senate approved an early version of the bill in February 2010. Saying, \\"Enough is enough,\\" Pearce stated figuratively that this new bill would remove handcuffs from law enforcement and place them on violent offenders. On March 27, 2010, 58-year-old Robert Krentz and his dog were shot and killed while Krentz was doing fence work on his large ranch roughly from the Mexican border. This incident gave a tangible public face to fears about immigration-related crime. Arizona police were not able to name a murder suspect but traced a set of footprints from the crime scene south towards the border. The resulting speculation that the killer was an illegal alien increased support among the public for the measure. For a while there was talk of naming the law after Krentz. Some state legislators (both for and against the law) believe, however, that the impact of the Krentz killing has been overstated as a factor in the bill's passing. The bill, with a number of changes made to it, passed the Arizona House of Representatives on April 13 by a 35‚Äì21 party-line vote. The revised measure then passed the State Senate on April 19 by a 17‚Äì11 vote that also closely followed party lines, with all but one Republican voting for the bill, ten Democrats voting against the bill, and two Democrats not voting. Once a bill passes, the governor has five days to make a decision to sign, veto, or let it pass unsigned. The question then became whether or not Governor Brewer would sign the bill into law, as she had remained silent on the measure while weighing the consequences. Immigration had not been a prime focus of her political career up to this point, although as secretary of state she had supported Arizona Proposition 200 (2004). As governor, she had made another push for Arizona Proposition 100 (2010), a one percent increase in the state sales tax to prevent cuts in education, health and human services, and public safety, despite opposition from within her own party. These preceding political moves, along with an upcoming tough Republican Party primary in the 2010 Arizona gubernatorial election from other conservative opponents supporting the bill, were all considered major factors in her decision. During the bill's development, her staff had gone over its language line by line with State Senator Pearce, but she had also said she had concerns about several of its provisions. The Mexican Senate urged the governor to veto the measure and the Mexican Embassy to the U.S. raised concerns about potential racial profiling that may result. Citizen messages to Brewer, however, were 3‚Äì1 in favor of the law. A Rasmussen Reports poll taken between the House and Senate votes showed wide support for the bill among likely voters in the state, with 70 percent in favor and 23 percent opposed. Of those same voters, 53 percent were at least somewhat concerned that actions taken due to the measures in the bill would violate the civil rights of some American citizens. Brewer's staff said that she was considering the legal issues, the impact on the state's business, and the feelings of the citizens in coming to her decision. They added that \\"she agonizes over these things,\\" and the governor also prayed over the matter. Brewer's political allies said her decision would cause her political trouble no matter which way she decided. Most observers expected that in the end, she would sign the bill, and on April 23 she did. State Representative Kyrsten Sinema, opponent of the bill, attending a protest at the Arizona State Capitol on the day of the bill's signing During the time of the signing, there were over a thousand people at the Arizona State Capitol both in support of and opposition to the bill, and some minor civil unrest occurred. Against concerns that the measure would promote racial profiling, Brewer stated that no such behavior would be tolerated: \\"We must enforce the law evenly, and without regard to skin color, accent or social status.\\" She vowed to ensure that police forces had proper training relative to the law and civil rights, and on the same day as the signing issued an executive order requiring additional training for all officers on how to implement SB 1070 without engaging in racial profiling. Ultimately, she said, \\"We have to trust our law enforcement.\\" (The training materials developed by the Arizona Peace Officer Standards and Training Board were released in June 2010.) Sponsor Pearce called the bill's signing \\"a good day for America.\\" News of the law and the debate around immigration gained national attention, especially on cable news television channels, where topics that attract strong opinions are often given extra airtime. Nevertheless, those voting on the bill were later surprised by the reaction it gained. State Representative Michele Reagan reflected three months later: \\"The majority of us who voted yes on that bill, myself included, did not expect or encourage an outcry from the public. The majority of us just voted for it because we thought we could try to fix the problem. Nobody envisioned boycotts. Nobody anticipated the emotion, the prayer vigils. The attitude was: These are the laws, let's start following them.\\" State Representative Kyrsten Sinema, the assistant House minority leader who tried to stop the bill and voted against it, similarly reflected: \\"I knew it would be bad, but no one thought it would be this big. No one.\\" The immigration issue also gained center stage in the re-election campaign of Republican U.S. Senator from Arizona John McCain, who had been a past champion of federal immigration reform measures such as the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007. Also faced with a primary battle ‚Äì against the more conservative J. D. Hayworth, who had made measures against illegal immigration a central point of his candidacy ‚Äì McCain supported SB 1070 only hours before its passage in the State Senate. McCain subsequently became a vocal defender of the law, saying that the state had been forced to take action given the federal government's inability to control the border. In September 2014, U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton ordered the primary sponsor of Arizona's 2010 immigration law to comply with a subpoena calling for him to turn over his emails and documents about the contentious statute. Challengers of the bill want to determine from these whether there was a discriminatory intent in composing the statute. Reaction =Opinion polls= A Rasmussen Reports poll done nationally around the time of the signing indicated that 60 percent of Americans were in favor of and 31 percent opposed to legislation that allows local police to \\"stop and verify the immigration status of anyone they suspect of being an illegal immigrant.\\" The same poll also indicated that 58 percent are at least somewhat concerned that \\"efforts to identify and deport illegal immigrants will also end up violating the civil rights of some U.S. citizens.\\" A national Gallup Poll found that more than three-quarters of Americans had heard about the law, and of those who had, 51 percent were in favor of it against 39 percent opposed. An Angus Reid Public Opinion poll indicated that 71 percent of Americans said they supported the notion of requiring their own police to determine people's status if there was \\"reasonable suspicion\\" the people were illegal immigrants, and arresting those people if they could not prove they were legally in the United States. A nationwide The New York Times/CBS News poll found similar results to the others, with 51 percent of respondents saying the Arizona law was \\"about right\\" in its approach to the problem of illegal immigration, 36 percent saying it went too far, and 9 percent saying it did not go far enough. Another CBS News poll, conducted a month after the signing, showed 52 percent seeing the law as about right, 28 percent thinking it goes too far, and 17 percent thinking it does not go far enough. A 57 percent majority thought that the federal government should be responsible for determining immigration law. A national Fox News poll found that 61 percent of respondents thought Arizona was right to take action itself rather than wait for federal action, and 64 percent thought the Obama administration should wait and see how the law works in practice rather than trying to stop it right away. Experts caution that in general, polling has difficulty reflecting complex immigration issues and law. Another Rasmussen poll, done statewide after several days of heavy news coverage about the controversial law and its signing, found a large majority of Arizonans still supported it, by a 64 percent to 30 percent margin. Rasmussen also found that Brewer's approval ratings as governor had shot up, going from 40 percent of likely voters before the signing to 56 percent after, and that her margin over prospective Democratic gubernatorial opponent, State Attorney General Terry Goddard (who opposes the law) had widened. A poll done by Arizona State University researchers found that 81 percent of registered Latino voters in the state opposed SB 1070. =Public officials= United States In the United States, supporters and opponents of the bill have roughly followed party lines, with most Democrats opposing the bill and most Republicans supporting it. The bill was criticized by President Barack Obama who called it \\"misguided\\" and said it would \\"undermine basic notions of fairness that we cherish as Americans, as well as the trust between police and our communities that is so crucial to keeping us safe.\\" Obama did later note that the HB 2162 modification had stipulated that the law not be applied in a discriminatory fashion, but the president said there was still the possibility of suspected illegal immigrants \\"being harassed and arrested\\". He repeatedly called for federal immigration reform legislation to forestall such actions among the states and as the only long-term solution to the problem of illegal immigration. Governor Brewer and President Obama met at the White House in early June 2010 to discuss immigration and border security issues in the wake of SB 1070; the meeting was termed pleasant, but brought about little change in the participants' stances. A sign at a rally against the law in Washington, DC Secretary of Homeland Security and former Arizona governor Janet Napolitano testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she had \\"deep concerns\\" about the law and that it would divert necessary law enforcement resources from combating violent criminals. (As governor, Napolitano had consistently vetoed similar legislation throughout her term.) U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said the federal government was considering several options, including a court challenge based on the law leading to possible civil rights violations. Michael Posner, the Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, brought up the law in discussions with a Chinese delegation to illustrate human rights areas the U.S. needed to improve on. This led McCain and fellow senator from Arizona Jon Kyl to strongly object to any possibly implied comparison of the law to human rights abuses in China. Senior Democratic U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg have criticized the law, with Bloomberg stating that it sends exactly the wrong message to international companies and travelers. In testimony before the Senate Homeland Security Committee, McCain drew out that Napolitano had made her remarks before having actually read the law. Holder also acknowledged that he had not read the statute. The admissions by the two cabinet secretaries that they had not yet read SB 1070 became an enduring criticism of the reaction against the law. Former Alaska governor and vice- presidential candidate Sarah Palin accused the party in power of being willing to \\"criticize bills (and divide the country with ensuing rhetoric) without actually reading them.\\" Governor Brewer's election campaign issued a video featuring a frog hand puppet that sang \\"reading helps you know what you're talkin' 'bout\\" and urged viewers to fully read the law. In reaction to the question, President Obama told a group of Republican senators that he had in fact read the law. Democrat Linda S√°nchez, U.S. Representative from California's 39th congressional district, has claimed that white supremacy groups are in part to blame for the law's passage, saying, \\"There's a concerted effort behind promoting these kinds of laws on a state-by-state basis by people who have ties to white supremacy groups. It's been documented. It's not mainstream politics.\\" Republican Representative Gary Miller, from California's 42nd congressional district, called her remarks \\"an outrageous accusation [and a] red herring. [She's] trying to change the debate from what the law says.\\" S√°nchez' district is in Los Angeles County and Miller's district is in both Los Angeles County and neighboring Orange County. The law has been popular among the Republican Party base electorate; however, several Republicans have opposed aspects of the measure, mostly from those who have represented heavily Hispanic states. These include former Governor of Florida Jeb Bush, former Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives and campaigning U.S. Senate candidate Marco Rubio, and former George W. Bush chief political strategist Karl Rove. Some analysts have stated that Republican support for the law gives short-term political benefits by energizing their base and independents, but longer term carries the potential of alienating the growing Hispanic population from the party. The issue played a role in several Republican primary contests during the 2010 congressional election season. One Arizona Democrat who defended some of the motivation behind the bill was Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who said her constituents were \\"sick and tired\\" of the federal government failing to protect the border, that the current situation was \\"completely unacceptable\\", and that the legislation was a \\"clear calling that the federal government needs to do a better job\\". However, she stopped short of supporting the law itself, saying it \\"does nothing to secure our border\\" and that it \\"stands in direct contradiction to our past and, as a result, threatens our future.\\" Her opposition to the law became one of the issues in her 2010 re-election campaign, in which she narrowly prevailed over her Republican opponent, who supported it. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton included the dispute over SB 1070 in an August 2010 report to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, as an example to other countries of how fractious issues can be resolved under the rule of law. Governor Brewer demanded that the reference to the law be removed from the report, seeing its inclusion as implying that the law was a violation of human rights and saying that any notion of submitting U.S. laws to U.N. review was \\"internationalism run amok\\". Mexico Mexican President Felipe Calder√≥n's office said that \\"the Mexican government condemns the approval of the law [and] the criminalization of migration.\\" President Calder√≥n also characterized the new law as a \\"violation of human rights\\". Calder√≥n repeated his criticism during a subsequent state visit to the White House. The measure was also strongly criticized by Mexican health minister Jos√© √Ångel C√≥rdova, former education minister Josefina V√°zquez Mota, and Governor of Baja California Jos√© Guadalupe Osuna Mill√°n, with Osuna saying it \\"could disrupt the indispensable economic, political and cultural exchanges of the entire border region.\\" The Mexican Foreign Ministry issued a travel advisory for its citizens visiting Arizona, saying \\"It must be assumed that every Mexican citizen may be harassed and questioned without further cause at any time.\\" In response to these comments, Chris Hawley of USA Today said that \\"Mexico has a law that is no different from Arizona's\\", referring to legislation which gives local police forces the power to check documents of people suspected of being in the country illegally. Immigration and human rights activists have also noted that Mexican authorities frequently engage in racial profiling, harassment, and shakedowns against migrants from Central America. The law imperiled the 28th annual, binational Border Governors Conference, scheduled to be held in Phoenix in September 2010 and to be hosted by Governor Brewer. The governors of the six Mexican states belonging to the conference vowed to boycott it in protest of the law, saying SB 1070 is \\"based on ethnic and cultural prejudice contrary to fundamental rights,\\" and Brewer said in response that she was canceling the gathering. Governors Bill Richardson of New Mexico and Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, U.S. border governors who oppose the law, supported moving the conference to another state and going forward with it, and it was subsequently held in Santa Fe, New Mexico without Brewer attending. =Arizona law enforcement= Arizona's law enforcement groups have been split on the bill, with statewide rank-and-file police officer groups generally supporting it and police chief associations opposing it. The Arizona Association of Chiefs of Police criticized the legislation, calling the provisions of the bill \\"problematic\\" and expressing that it will negatively affect the ability of law enforcement agencies across the state to fulfill their many responsibilities in a timely manner. Additionally, some officers have repeated the past concern that illegal immigrants may come to fear the police and not contact them in situations of emergency or in instances where they have valuable knowledge of a crime. However, the Phoenix Law Enforcement Association, which represents the city's police officers, has supported the legislation and lobbied aggressively for its passage. Officers supporting the measure say they have many indicators other than race they can use to determine whether someone may be an illegal immigrant, such as absent identification or conflicting statements made. The measure was hailed by Joe Arpaio, Sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona ‚Äì known for his tough crackdowns on illegal immigration within his own jurisdiction ‚Äì who hoped the measure would cause the federal action to seal the border. Arpaio said, \\"I think they'll be afraid that other states will follow this new law that's now been passed.\\" =Religious organizations and perspectives= Activists within the church were present on both sides of the immigration debate, and both proponents and opponents of the law appealed to religious arguments for support. A protest against SB 1070 by a coalition of community organizations in Minneapolis State Senator Pearce, a devout member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which has a substantial population in Arizona, frequently said that his efforts to push forward this legislation was based on that church's 13 Articles of Faith, one of which instructs in obeying the law. This association caused a backlash against The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and threatened its proselytizing efforts among the area's Hispanic population. The church emphasized that it took no position on the law or immigration in general and that Pearce did not speak for it. It later endorsed the Utah Compact on immigration and in the following year, took an official position on the issue which opposed Pearce's approach to immigration, saying, \\"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is concerned that any state legislation that only contains enforcement provisions is likely to fall short of the high moral standard of treating each other as children of God. The Church supports an approach where illegal immigrants are allowed to square themselves with the law and continue to work without this necessarily leading to citizenship.\\" The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops denounced the law, characterizing it as draconian and saying it \\"could lead to the wrongful questioning and arrest of U.S. citizens.\\" The National Council of Churches also criticized the law, saying that it ran counter to centuries of biblical teachings regarding justice and neighborliness. Other members of the Christian clergy differed on the law. United Methodist Church Bishop Minerva G. Carca√±o of Arizona's Desert Southwest Conference opposed it as \\"unwise, short sighted and mean spirited\\" and led a mission of prominent religious figures to Washington to lobby for comprehensive immigration reform. But others stressed the Biblical command to follow laws. While there was a perception that most Christian groups opposed the law, Mark Tooley of the Institute on Religion and Democracy said that immigration was a political issue that \\"Christians across the spectrum can disagree about\\" and that liberal churches were simply more outspoken on this matter. =Concerns over potential civil rights violations= The National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials said the legislation was \\"an unconstitutional and costly measure that will violate the civil rights of all Arizonans.\\" Mayor Chris Coleman of Saint Paul, Minnesota, labeled it as \\"draconian\\" as did Democratic Texas House of Representatives member Garnet Coleman. Edwin Kneedler, the U.S. Deputy Solicitor General, also criticized the legislation for its potential infringement on the civil liberties of Arizona's citizens and lawful permanent residents.\\"Arizona's SB 1070: the Battle for Immigrant's Rights\\" Making Contact, produced by National Radio Project. November 16, 2010. Proponents with the law have rejected such criticism, and argued that the law was reasonable, limited, and carefully crafted. Stewart Baker, a former Homeland Security official in the George W. Bush administration, said, \\"The coverage of this law and the text of the law are a little hard to square. There's nothing in the law that requires cities to stop people without cause, or encourages racial or ethnic profiling by itself.\\" Republican member with the Arizona House of Representatives Steve Montenegro supported the law, saying that \\"This bill has nothing to do with race or profiling. It has to do with the law. We are seeing a lot of crime here in Arizona because of the open borders that we have.\\" Montenegro, who legally immigrated to the U.S. from El Salvador with his family when he was four, stated, \\"I am saying if you here illegally, get in line, come in the right way.\\" As one of the main drafters of the law, Kobach has stated that the way the law has been written makes any form of racial profiling illegal. In particular, Kobach references the phrase in the law that directly states that officers \\"may not solely consider race, color, or national origin.\\" Kobach also disagrees that the \\"reasonable suspicion\\" clause of the bill specifically allows for racial profiling, replying that the term \\"reasonable suspicion\\" has been used in other laws prior and therefore has \\"legal precedent\\". However, there are ongoing arguments in legal journal articles that racial profiling does exist and threatens human security, particularly community security of the Mexicans living in the United States. India Williams argues that the Border Patrol is very likely to stop anyone if a suspect resembles \\"Mexican appearance\\" and states that such generalization of unchangeable physical features threatens the culture and the heritage of the ethnic group. Andrea Nill argues that it is only a small portion of Mexicans and Latinos that are illegal immigrants, but there is a demonization and illogical discrimination of Latino community by giving less respect, rights, and freedoms, whereas white American citizens will never have to worry about being stopped by the police due to their skin color. Some Latino leaders compared the law to Apartheid in South Africa or the Japanese American internment during World War II. The law's aspect that officers may question the immigration status of those they suspect are in the country illegally became characterized in some quarters as the \\"show me your papers\\" or \\"your papers, please\\" provision. This echoed a common trope regarding Germans in World War II films. Such an association was explicitly made by Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky of Illinois. Congressman Jared Polis of Colorado and Los Angeles Councilwoman Janice Hahn also said the law's requirement to carry papers all the time was reminiscent of the anti-Jewish legislation in prewar Nazi Germany and feared that Arizona was headed towards becoming a police state. Cardinal Roger Mahony of Los Angeles said, \\"I can't imagine Arizonans now reverting to German Nazi and Russian Communist techniques whereby people are required to turn one another in to the authorities on any suspicion of documentation.\\" The Anti-Defamation League called for an end to the comparisons with Nazi Germany, saying that no matter how odious or unconstitutional the Arizona law might be, it did not compare to the role that Nazi identity cards played in what eventually became the extermination of European Jews. In its final form, HB 2162 limits the use of race. It states: \\"A law enforcement official or agency of this state or a county, city, town or other political subdivision of this state may not consider race, color or national origin in implementing the requirements of this subsection except to the extent permitted by the United States or Arizona Constitution.\\" The U.S. and Arizona supreme courts have held that race may be considered in enforcing immigration law. In United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, the U.S. Supreme Court found: \\"The likelihood that any given person of Mexican ancestry is an alien is high enough to make Mexican appearance a relevant factor.\\"United States v. Brignoni-Ponce,, 422 U.S. 873, 886‚Äì87 (1975). The Arizona Supreme Court agrees that \\"enforcement of immigration laws often involves a relevant consideration of ethnic factors.\\"State v. Graciano,, 653 P.2d 683, 687 n.7 (Ariz. 1982). Both decisions say that race alone, however, is an insufficient basis to stop or arrest. =Protests= Thousands of people staged protests in state capital Phoenix over the law around the time of its signing, and a pro-immigrant activist called the measure \\"racist\\". Passage of the HB 2162 modifications to the law, although intended to address some of the criticisms of it, did little to change the minds of the law's opponents. Protesters being arrested as part of the May 1, 2010, civil disobedience display in front of the White House Tens of thousands of people demonstrated against the law in over 70 U.S. cities on May 1, 2010, a day traditionally used around the world to assert workers' rights. A rally in Los Angeles, attended by Cardinal Mahoney, attracted between 50,000 and 60,000 people, with protesters waving Mexican flags and chanting \\"S√≠ se puede\\". The city had become the national epicenter of protests against the Arizona law. Around 25,000 people were at a protest in Dallas, and more than 5,000 were in Chicago and Milwaukee, while rallies in other cities generally attracted around a thousand people or so. Democratic U.S. Congressman from Illinois Luis Guti√©rrez was part of a 35-person group arrested in front of the White House in a planned act of civil disobedience that was also urging President Obama to push for comprehensive immigration reform. There and in some other locations, demonstrators expressed frustration with what they saw as the administration's lack of action on immigration reform, with signs holding messages such as \\"Hey Obama! Don't deport my mama.\\" Protests both for and against the Act took place over Memorial Day Weekend in Phoenix and commanded thousands of people. Those opposing it, mostly consisting of Latinos, marched five miles to the State Capitol in high heat, while those supporting it met in a stadium in an event arranged by elements of the Tea Party movement. Protests against the law extended to the arts and sports world as well. Colombian pop singer Shakira came to Phoenix and gave a joint press conference against the bill with Mayor of Phoenix Phil Gordon. Linda Ronstadt, of part Mexican descent and raised in Arizona, also appeared in Phoenix and said, \\"Mexican-Americans are not going to take this lying down.\\" A concert of May 16 in Mexico City's Z√≥calo, called Prepa Si Youth For Dignity: We Are All Arizona, drew some 85,000 people to hear Molotov, Jaguares, and Maldita Vecindad headline a seven-hour show in protest against the law. The Major League Baseball Players Association, of whose members one quarter are born outside the U.S., said that the law \\"could have a negative impact on hundreds of major league players,\\" especially since many teams come to Arizona for spring training, and called for it to be \\"repealed or modified promptly.\\" A Major League Baseball game at Wrigley Field where the Arizona Diamondbacks were visiting the Chicago Cubs saw demonstrators protesting the law. Protesters focused on the Diamondbacks because owner Ken Kendrick had been a prominent fundraiser in Republican causes, but he in fact opposed the law. The Phoenix Suns of the National Basketball Association wore their \\"Los Suns\\" uniforms normally used for the league's \\"Noche Latina\\" program for their May 5, 2010 (Cinco de Mayo) playoff game against the San Antonio Spurs to show their support for Arizona's Latino community and to voice disapproval of the immigration law. The Suns' political action, rare in American team sports, created a firestorm and drew opposition from many of the teams' fans; President Obama highlighted it, while conservative radio commentator Rush Limbaugh called the move \\"cowardice, pure and simple.\\" =Boycotts= Boycotts of Arizona were organized in response to SB 1070, with resolutions by city governments being among the first to materialize. The government of San Francisco, the Los Angeles City Council, and city officials in Oakland, Minneapolis, Saint Paul, Denver, and Seattle all took specific action, usually by banning some of their employees from work-related travel to Arizona or by limiting city business done with companies headquartered in Arizona. In an attempt to push back against the Los Angeles City Council's action, which was valued at $56 million, Arizona Corporation Commissioner Gary Pierce sent a letter to Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, suggesting that he'd \\"be happy to encourage Arizona utilities to renegotiate your power agreements so that Los Angeles no longer receives any power from Arizona-based generation.\\" Such a move was infeasible for reasons of ownership and governance, and Pierce later stated that he was not making a literal threat to cut power to the city. Arizona's convention business, such as here at the Phoenix Convention Center, was a prime target of boycott efforts. U.S. Congressman Ra√∫l Grijalva, from Arizona's 7th congressional district, had been the first prominent officeholder to call for an economic boycott of his state, by industries from manufacturing to tourism, in response to SB 1070. His call was echoed by La Opini√≥n, the nation's largest Spanish-language newspaper. Calls for various kinds of boycotts were also spread through social media sites, and there were reports of individuals or groups changing their plans or activities in protest of the law. The prospect of an adverse economic impact made Arizonan business leaders and groups nervous, and Phoenix officials estimated that the city could lose up to $90 million in hotel and convention business over the next five years due to the controversy over the law. Phoenix Mayor Gordon urged people not to punish the entire state as a consequence. Major organizations opposing the law, such as the National Council of La Raza, refrained from initially supporting a boycott, knowing that such actions are difficult to execute successfully and even if done cause broad economic suffering, including among the people they are supporting. Arizona did have a past case of a large-scale boycott during the late 1980s and early 1990s, when it lost many conventions and several hundred million dollars in revenues after Governor Evan Mecham's cancellation of a Martin Luther King, Jr. Day state holiday and a subsequent failed initial referendum to restore it. La Raza subsequently switched its position regarding SB 1070 and became one of the leaders of the boycott effort. The Arizona Hispanic Chamber of Commerce opposed both the law and the idea of boycotting, saying the latter would only hurt small businesses and the state's economy, which was already badly damaged by the collapse of real estate prices and the late-2000s recession. Other state business groups opposed a boycott for the same reasons. Religious groups opposed to the law split on whether a boycott was advisable, with Bishop Carca√±o saying one \\"would only extend our recession by three to five years and hit those who are poorest among us.\\" Representative Grijalva said he wanted to keep a boycott restricted to conferences and conventions and only for a limited time: \\"The idea is to send a message, not grind down the state economy.\\" Governor Brewer said that she was disappointed and surprised at the proposed boycotts ‚Äì \\"How could further punishing families and businesses, large and small, be a solution viewed as constructive?\\" ‚Äì but said that the state would not back away from the law. President Obama took no position on the matter, saying, \\"I'm the president of the United States, I don't endorse boycotts or not endorse boycotts. That's something that private citizens can make a decision about.\\" Calls to boycott the 2011 Major League Baseball All-Star Game were ineffective. Sports-related boycotts were proposed as well. U.S. Congressman from New York Jos√© Serrano asked baseball commissioner Bud Selig to move the 2011 Major League Baseball All-Star Game from Chase Field in Phoenix. The manager of the Chicago White Sox, Ozzie Guill√©n, stated that he would boycott that game \\"as a Latin American\\" and several players indicated they might as well. Selig refused to move the game and it took place as scheduled a year later, with no players or coaches staying away. Two groups protesting outside the stadium drew little interest from fans eager to get into the game. The World Boxing Council, based in Mexico City, said it would not schedule Mexican boxers to fight in the state. A boycott by musicians saying they would not stage performances in Arizona was co-founded by Marco Amador, a Chicano activist and independent media advocate and Zack de la Rocha, the lead singer of Rage Against the Machine and the son of Beto de la Rocha of Chicano art group Los Four, who said, \\"Some of us grew up dealing with racial profiling, but this law (SB 1070) takes it to a whole new low.\\" Called the Sound Strike, artists signing on with the effort included Kanye West, Cypress Hill, Massive Attack, Conor Oberst, Sonic Youth, Joe Satriani, Rise Against, Tenacious D, The Coup, Gogol Bordello, and Los Tigres del Norte. Some other Spanish-language artists did not join this effort but avoided playing in Arizona on their tours anyway; these included Pitbull, Wisin & Yandel, and Conjunto Primavera. The Sound Strike boycott failed to gain support from many area- or stadium-level acts, and no country music acts signed on. Elton John very publicly opposed such efforts, saying at a concert performance in Tucson: \\"We are all very pleased to be playing in Arizona. I have read that some of the artists won't come here. They are fuckwits! Let's face it: I still play in California, and as a gay man I have no legal rights whatsoever. So what's the fuck up with these people?\\" By November 2010, Pitbull had announced a change of heart, playing a show in Phoenix because large parts of the law had been stopped by the judicial action. My Chemical Romance, an original Sound Strike participant, supposedly dropped out and scheduled a show in the state as well (however, the following day the show was cancelled and the band apologized, explaining that it was an error with tour scheduling and it should not have been booked in the first place due to \\"the band's affiliation with The Sound Strike\\" ). De la Rocha said Sound Strike would continue despite the injunction against large parts of SB 1070 in order to battle Arizona's \\"racist and fear mongering state government\\" and until the Obama administration stopped participating in federal actions such as the 287(g) program, Secure Communities, and other U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement policies. In reaction to the boycott talk, proponents of the law advocated making a special effort to buy products and services from Arizona in order to indicate support for the law. These efforts, sometimes termed a \\"buycott\\", were spread by social media and talk radio as well as by elements of the Tea Party movement. Some supporters of the law and legal scholars have also suggested that the city government boycotts of Arizona represent an unconstitutional violation of the Interstate Commerce Clause. By early May, the state had lost a projected $6‚Äì10 million in business revenue, according to the Arizona Hotel & Lodging Association. However, an increase in leisure travel and an overall economic recovery more than compensated for the business travel loss; by July, overall hotel occupancy rates and revenues were up from the same period in 2009. The president of the Greater Phoenix Economic Council said, \\"Fundamentally, the boycotts have been unsuccessful.\\" A November 2010 study by the progressive-oriented Center for American Progress stated that the boycott had so far cost the state economy as much as $141 million in lost revenues, including $45 million in the lodging industry. However, an examination at the same time by the Associated Press found that while the boycott had been disruptive in some areas, it had had nowhere near the effect some had originally imagined. Visitors at Grand Canyon National Park were up from the year before, several well-known Arizona-based companies that were targeted said they had seen no effect from it, and the actions by the San Francisco and Los Angeles city governments had resulted in few practical consequences. Sports-related boycotts, such as of the Fiesta Bowl, sponsor Frito-Lay and beer distributor Hensley & Co., had also had no effect. In September 2011 La Raza and two associated groups called off their boycott, saying that the action had been successful in discouraging some other states from passing SB 1070-like laws and that continuing the boycott would only punish businesses and workers. Effects =Arizona= Some Christian churches in Arizona with large immigrant congregations reported a 30 percent drop in their attendance figures. Schools, businesses, and health care facilities in certain areas also reported sizable drops in their numbers. That and the prevalence of yard sales suggested illegal immigrants were leaving Arizona, with some returning to Mexico and others moving to other U.S. states. A November 2010 study by BBVA Bancomer based upon Current Population Survey figures stated that there were 100,000 fewer Hispanics in Arizona than before the debate about the law began; it said Arizona's poor economic climate could also be contributing to the decline. The government of Mexico reported that over 23,000 of its citizens returned to the country from Arizona between June and September 2010. A report by Seminario Ni√±ez Migrante found that about 8,000 students entered into Sonora public schools in 2009‚Äì2011 with families quoting the American economy and SB 1070 as the main causes. The weeks after the bill's signing saw a sharp increase in the number of Hispanics in the state registering their party affiliations as Democrats. Some immigration experts said the law might make workers with H-1B visas vulnerable to being caught in public without their hard-to-replace paperwork, which they are ordinarily reluctant to carry with them on a daily basis, and that as a consequence universities and technology companies in the state might find it harder to recruit students and employees. Some college and university administrators shared this fear, and President Robert N. Shelton of the University of Arizona expressed concern regarding the withdrawal of a number of honor roll students from the university in reaction to this bill. Some women with questionable immigration status avoided domestic abuse hotlines and shelters for fear of deportation. Some critics of SB 1070 feared that it will serve as a roadblock to victims getting needed support, while supporters said such concerns were unfounded and that the Act was directed towards criminals, not victims. While a few provisions of the law were left standing following the July 2010 blockage of the most controversial parts, authorities often kept following existing local ordinances in those areas in preference to using the new SB 1070 ones. One county sheriff said, \\"The whole thing is still on the shelf until the Supreme Court hears it.\\" By mid-2012, those provisions had still rarely been made use of. The training that police forces had gone through to avoid racial profiling and understand federal immigration policies still had a beneficial effect overall. A 2016 study found that the legislation \\"significantly reduced the flow of illegal workers into Arizona from Mexico by 30 to 70 percent.\\" In April 2020, plans were announced to build a new mural at the Arizona Capitol Museum honoring those harmed by the law. =Other states= The Arizona legislation was one of several reasons pushing Democratic congressional leaders to introduce a proposal addressing immigration. Senator Schumer sent a letter to Governor Brewer asking her to delay the law while Congress works on comprehensive immigration reform, but Brewer quickly rejected the proposal. Bills similar to SB 1070 were introduced in Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Michigan, Minnesota, and South Carolina. None of them went to final votes in 2010; politicians in nearly twenty states had proposed introducing similar legislation during their 2011 legislative calendars. Such proposals drew strong reaction both for and against, and some states may have waited to see how the Arizona law fares in the courts before moving forward. The other states along the Mexican border ‚Äì Texas, New Mexico, and California ‚Äì generally showed little interest in following Arizona's path. This was due to their having established, powerful Hispanic communities, deep cultural ties to Mexico, past experience with bruising political battles over the issue (such as with California Proposition 187 in the 1990s), and the perception among their populations that illegal immigration was less severe a problem. By March 2011, Arizona-like bills had been defeated or had failed to progress in at least six states and momentum had shifted against such imitative efforts. Reasons ranged from opposition from business leaders to fear among legislators of the legal costs of defending any adopted measure. One state that did pass a law based partly on SB 1070, Utah, combined it with a guest worker program that went in the other direction (and fit into the spirit of the Utah Compact). Even in Arizona itself, additional tough measures against illegal immigration were having a difficult time gaining passage in the Arizona Senate. Other states were still waiting to see what the outcome of the legal battles would be. By September 2011, Indiana, Georgia, and South Carolina had passed somewhat similar measures and were facing legal action. Another anti-illegal immigration measure, Alabama HB 56, was considered tougher even than SB 1070; it was signed into law in June 2011. However, federal courts subsequently blocked many of the key provisions of these laws in those states, and other provisions were dropped following settlements of lawsuits. =Political careers= State Senator Pearce rose to become President of the Arizona Senate in January 2011. But he then suffered a startling defeat when he lost a November 2011 recall election. Among the reasons given for his loss were the desire for greater civility in politics and a lessening of the tension over immigration policy, and a loss of support for Pearce among LDS Church members based on character issues. Other reasons for the defeat, such as concerns over Pearce's ethics in taking free trips or the involvement of a third candidacy in the recall election, had little to do with SB 1070. In August 2012, Pearce lost a comeback bid in the Republican primary for the nomination for a state senate seat to businessman Bob Worsley. Pearce was given another government job by the Maricopa County Treasurer. Drafter of the law Kris Kobach won election as Secretary of State of Kansas, first defeating two other candidates in a Republican primary, then winning the general election against Democratic incumbent Chris Biggs by a wide margin. Sheriff Joe Arpaio was among those who campaigned for Kobach. State Attorney General Goddard did get the Democratic nomination in the 2010 Arizona gubernatorial election. Governor Jan Brewer went on to defeat him by a 54 to 42 percent margin in the November 2010 general election. A 2016 study found that the up-tick in Brewer's approval ratings due to the legislation \\"proved enduring enough to turn a losing race for re-election into a victory\\".  Legal challenges  = Supremacy Clause vs. concurrent enforcement = The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) criticized the statute as a violation of the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, which states that federal law, so long as it is constitutional, is paramount over state laws. Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional scholar and dean of the University of California, Irvine School of Law said, \\"The law is clearly pre-empted by federal law under Supreme Court precedents.\\" According to Kobach, the law embodies the doctrine of \\"concurrent enforcement\\" (the state law parallels applicable federal law without any conflict), and Kobach stated that he believed that it would thus survive any challenge: \\"There are some things that states can do and some that states can't do, but this law threads the needle perfectly.... Arizona only penalizes what is already a crime under federal law.\\" State Senator Pearce noted that some past state laws on immigration enforcement had been upheld in federal courts. In Gonzales v. City of Peoria (9th Cir. 1983),Gonzales v. City of Peoria, 722 F.2d 468 (9th Cir. 1983). a court held that the Immigration and Naturalization Act precludes local enforcement of the Act's civil provisions but not the Act's criminal provisions. The US Attorney General may enter a written agreement with a state or local government agency under which that agency's employees perform the function of an immigration officer in relation to the investigation, apprehension, or detention of aliens in the United States;. however, such an agreement is not required for the agency's employees to perform those functions. . On the other hand, various legal experts were divided on whether the law would survive a court challenge, with one law professor saying it \\"sits right on that thin line of pure state criminal law and federally controlled immigration law.\\" Past lower court decisions in the area were not always consistent, and a decision on the bill's legality from the US Supreme Court was one possible outcome. =Initial court actions= On April 27, 2010, Roberto Javier Frisancho, a natural born citizen and resident of Washington, D.C., who planned on visiting Arizona, filed the first lawsuit against S.B. 1070. On April 29, 2010, the National Coalition of Latino Clergy and Christian Leaders and a Tucson police officer, Martin Escobar, filed suit against SB 1070, both doing so separately in federal court. The National Coalition's filing claimed that the law usurped federal responsibilities under the Supremacy Clause that it led to racial profiling by imposing a \\"reasonable suspicion\\" requirement upon police officers to check the immigration status of those they come in official conduct with, which would, in turn, be subject to too much personal interpretation by each officer. Escobar's suit argued that there was no race-neutral criteria available to him to suspect that a person was an illegal immigrant and that implementation of the law would hinder police investigations in areas that were predominantly Hispanic. The suit also claimed the Act violated federal law because the police and the city have no authority to perform immigration-related duties. The Tucson police department insisted that Escobar was not acting on its behalf and that it had received many calls from citizens complaining about his suit. A Phoenix police officer, David Salgado, quickly followed with his own federal suit, claiming that to enforce the law would require him to violate the rights of Hispanics. He also said that he would be forced to spend his own time and resources studying the law's requirements and that he was liable to being sued whether he enforced the law or not. On May 5, Tucson and Flagstaff became the first two cities to authorize legal action against the state over the Act. San Luis later joined them. However, as of mid-late May, none of them had actually filed a suit. In late May, however, the city of Tucson filed a cross-claim and joined Officer Escobar in his suit. On May 17, a joint class action lawsuit, Friendly House et al. v. Whiting, was filed in U.S. District Court on behalf of ten individuals and fourteen labor, religious, and civil rights organizations. The legal counsel filing the action, the largest of those filed, was a collaboration of the ACLU, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the National Immigration Law Center, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National Day Laborer Organizing Network, and the Asian Pacific American Legal Center. The suit seeks to prevent SB 1070 from going into effect by charging: *It violates the federal Supremacy Clause by attempting to bypass federal immigration law; *It violates the Fourteenth Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause rights of racial and national origin minorities by subjecting them to stops, detentions, and arrests based on their race or origin; *It violates the First Amendment rights of freedom of speech by exposing speakers to scrutiny based on their language or accent; *it violates the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures because it allows for warrantless searches in absence of probable cause; *It violates the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause by being impermissibly vague; *It infringes on constitutional provisions that protect the right to travel without being stopped, questioned, or detained. This suit named County's Attorney and Sheriffs as defendants, rather than the State of Arizona or Governor Brewer, as the earlier suits had. On June 4, the ACLU and others filed a request for an injunction, arguing that the Act's scheduled start date of July 29 should be postponed until the underlying legal challenges against it were resolved. Arizona Attorneys for Criminal Justice, the state affiliate of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, alleged in an amicus curiae brief for the ACLU et al. case that the prolonged detentions mandated by the law if reasonable suspicion that someone subject to a lawful stop was an illegal alien are not justifiable except under the probable cause standard and so the law requires violations of Fourth Amendment rights. The Anti-Defamation League also filed an amicus curiae brief in support of the case. The Government of Mexico said that the law was unconstitutional and would lead to unlawful discrimination against Mexican citizens and damage to relations between the two nations. Indeed, so many amicus curiae briefs have been filed regarding the law that size limits were imposed upon them. Kobach remained optimistic that the suits would fail: \\"I think it will be difficult for the plaintiffs challenging this. They are heavy on political rhetoric but light on legal arguments.\\" In late May 2010, Governor Brewer issued an executive order to create the Governor's Border Security and Immigration Legal Defense Fund to handle suits over the law. Brewer got into a dispute with Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard over whether he would defend the law against legal challenges, as a state attorney general normally would. Brewer accused Goddard, who opposed the law personally and was one of Brewer's possible rivals in the gubernatorial election, of colluding with the US Justice Department as it deliberated whether to challenge the law in court. Goddard subsequently agreed to withdraw from the state's defense. =Department of Justice lawsuit= The United States Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the state of Arizona in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona on July 6, 2010, asking for the law to be declared invalid since it interferes with the immigration regulations \\"exclusively vested in the federal government.\\" In a brief to the press, the department's lawyers referenced the notion of federal preemption and stated, \\"The Constitution and the federal immigration laws do not permit the development of a patchwork of state and local immigration policies throughout the country.... The immigration framework set forth by Congress and administered by federal agencies reflects a careful and considered balance of national law enforcement, foreign relations, and humanitarian concerns ‚Äì concerns that belong to the nation as a whole, not a single state.\\" That pointed to an additional practical argument: the law would result in federal authorities losing focus on their broader priorities to deal with an influx of deportations from Arizona. The Justice Department requested for the federal courts to enjoin enforcement of the law before it could go into effect. The suit did not argue that the law will lead to racial profiling, but department officials said they would continue to monitor that aspect if the measure went into effect. A direct suit of a state by the federal government is rare, and the action held possible political consequences for the 2010 U.S. midterm elections as well. It was also seen as a pre-emptive measure to discourage other states considering similar laws from moving forward with them. Immediate reaction to the Justice Department's decision was highly split, with liberal groups hailing it but with Governor Brewer calling it \\"nothing more than a massive waste of taxpayer funds.\\" Senators Kyl and McCain released a joint statement noting that \\"the American people must wonder whether the Obama Administration is really committed to securing the border when it sues a state that is simply trying to protect its people by enforcing immigration law.\\" Representative Darrell Issa, one of 19 Republicans to sign a letter criticizing the suit on the day that it was announced, said, \\"For President Obama to stand in the way of a state which has taken action to stand up for its citizens against the daily threat of violence and fear is disgraceful and a betrayal of his Constitutional obligation to protect our citizens.\\" The federal action also led to a surge in contributions to the governor's defense fund for the law. By July 8, total donations were over $500,000, with the large majority of them being for $100 or less and coming from around the nation. The Arizona Latino Republican Association became the first Latino organization to come out in support of SB 1070 and filed a motion to intervene against the Justice Department's lawsuit challenging it. An attempt in the US Senate to block funding for the Justice Department's lawsuit lost by a 55‚Äì43 vote that was mostly along party lines. =Initial hearings and rulings= Hearings on three of the seven lawsuits were held on July 15 and 22, 2010, before U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton. Bolton asked pointed questions of each side during both hearings but gave no indication of how or when she would rule. On July 28, 2010, Bolton issued a ruling on the Justice Department suit, United States of America v. Arizona, granting a preliminary injunction that blocked the most key and controversial portions of SB 1070 from going into effect. United States v. Arizona, et al. Order on Preliminary Injunction They included requiring police to check the immigration status of those arrested or stopped, which the judge ruled would overwhelm the federal government handling of immigration cases and could mean that legal immigrants would be wrongly arrested. She wrote, \\"Federal resources will be taxed and diverted from federal enforcement priorities as a result of the increase in requests for immigration status determination that will flow from Arizona.\\" Her ruling was not a final decision but was based on the belief that the Justice Department was likely to win a full later trial in federal court on these aspects. Bolton made no rulings in the other six lawsuits. Governor Brewer said that the injunction would be appealed, and on July 29, that was done in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco. Documents related to the appeal in USA v. State of Arizona, No. 10-16645, are available on the web site for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals: Judge Bolton's Order granting the preliminary injunction, the Motion to Expedite Briefing and Hearing Schedule by the State of Arizona, and the Response to Motion to Expedite by the United States. State Senator Pearce predicted that the legal battle would eventually end up in the Supreme Court and likely be upheld by a 5‚Äì4 margin. Judge Bolton's ruling let a number of other aspects of the law take effect on July 29, including the ability to prevent state officials from maintaining \\"sanctuary city\\" policies and allowing civil suits against those policies, the mandating that state officials work with federal officials on matters related to illegal immigration, and the prohibition of stopping a vehicle in traffic to pick up day laborers. Those parts of the law were challenged not by the Justice Department but by some of the other suits. Recording of oral arguments in the appeal to the Ninth Circuit. A three-judge panel from the Ninth Circuit heard arguments in the appeal case on November 1, 2010, and it gave indications that it might reinstate but weaken parts of the law. In February 2011, Arizona filed a countersuit against the federal government in the United States v. Arizona case, accusing it of failing to secure the Mexican border against large numbers of illegal immigrants. Arizona Attorney General Tom Horne acknowledged that precedent surrounding sovereign immunity in the United States made the state's case difficult, but he said, \\"We're asking the 9th Circuit to take a second look.\\" On April 11, 2011, the Ninth Circuit panel upheld the district court's ban on parts of the law taking effect, thus ruling in favor of the Obama administration and against Arizona. Judge Richard Paez gave the majority opinion in which Judge John T. Noonan, Jr. joined; Judge Carlos Bea dissented in part. Paez agreed with the administration's view that the state had intruded upon federal prerogatives. Noonan wrote in his concurrence: \\"The Arizona statute before us has become a symbol. For those sympathetic to immigrants to the United States, it is a challenge and a chilling foretaste of what other states might attempt.\\" On May 9, 2011, Governor Brewer announced that Arizona would appeal directly to the US Supreme Court, rather than request a hearing en banc before the Ninth Circuit. That appeal was filed on August 10, 2011. In response, the Justice Department requested for the Supreme Court to stay out of the case and said that the lower courts' actions were appropriate. Observers thought it likely that the Supreme Court would take up the matter, but if it declined to step in, the case most likely would be returned to the trial judge in the District Court to review the case on its merits and determine whether the temporary injunction that blocked the law's most controversial provisions should become permanent. The Supreme Court announced in December 2011 that it had granted a petition for writ of certiorari, and oral arguments took place on April 25, 2012. Bolton's court continued to oversee the other lawsuits; by early 2012 three of the seven were still active. On February 29, 2012, Bolton ruled in favor of an action led by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and blocked provisions of the law that allowed for the arrest of day workers who block traffic in an effort to gain employment. =US Supreme Court ruling= On June 25, 2012, the US Supreme Court issued a ruling in the case Arizona v. United States. It determined, by a 5‚Äì3 majority, with Justice Anthony Kennedy writing the opinion, that Sections 3, 5(C), and 6 of SB 1070 were pre-empted by federal law.Arizona v. United States, No. 11-182. Those sections make it a state misdemeanor for an immigrant not to be carrying documentation of lawful presence in the country, allow state police to arrest without a warrant in some situations, and make it unlawful under state law for an individual to apply for employment without federal work authorization. All of the justices agreed to uphold the portion of the law allowing Arizona state police to investigate the immigration status of an individual stopped, detained, or arrested if there is reasonable suspicion that individual is in the country illegally. However, Justice Kennedy specified in the majority opinion that state police may not detain the individual for a prolonged amount of time for not carrying immigration documents and that cases based upon allegations of racial profiling may proceed through the courts if such cases happen later. Justice Scalia dissented and said that he would have upheld the entire law. Justice Thomas likewise stated that he would have upheld the entire law and that it was not pre-empted by federal law. Justice Alito agreed with Justices Scalia and Thomas on Sections 5(C) and 6 but joined with the majority in finding Section 3 pre-empted. =Further rulings and challenges= On September 5, 2012, Judge Bolton cleared the way for police to carry out the 2010 law's requirement that officers, while enforcing other laws, may question the immigration status of those they suspect are in the country illegally. She said that the Supreme Court had clearly stated that the provision \\"cannot be challenged further on its face before the law takes effect,\\" but that constitutionality challenges on other grounds could take place in the future. Later that month, the first arrest received some news attention. In November 2013, the ACLU filed the first legal challenge to this provision.

It is native to California (as far north as Fort Ord along the Monterey Bay), Baja California, New Mexico, and in Arizona through the transition zone to the eastern Mogollon Rim, where it grows in canyons, mountain slopes, washes, and other dry habitats.SEINet, Southwestern Biodiversity, Arizona chapter Quercus dunnii Kellogg 1879, common name Dunn oak, is synonymous with Palmer oak. Description Quercus palmeri is a shrub or small tree growing up to 3 meters (10 feet) tall, but known to reach 6 meters (20 feet) at times. It branches into angular twigs and is reddish brown. The leaves are 1 to 3 centimeters (0.4-1.2 inches) in length. They are stiff, leathery, and brittle, their edges wavy with sharp spine-teeth. The upper surface is shiny, waxy, and olive green in color, the lower gray-green and coated with glandular hairs. The fruit is an acorn with a hairy cap up to 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) wide and a blunt-ended nut 2 to 3 centimeters (0.8-1.2 inches) long. Cluster of clonal individuals Quercus palmeri usually grows in small populations, some of which are actually cloned growths of a single plant. One such clone in the Jurupa Mountains in Riverside County, California, named the Jurupa Oak, was determined to be over 13,000 years old, a single individual living as a relict from the Pleistocene.May, M.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1997. The monument is a 35-foot obelisk of North Carolina granite. It is located at the town square of Portsmouth, on Court Street at the corner of High Street. Also facing on the town square are the Trinity Episcopal Church dating from 1828 and the Portsmouth Courthouse dating from 1846, which are also NRHP-listed. and Accompanying photo at Virginia Historic Landmarks Commission It was erected by the Ladies Memorial Aid Association of Portsmouth, Virginia, which was founded in 1866 with one purpose \\"being the erection of a monument to the Confederate dead of Portsmouth and Norfolk County.\\" The design was by topographical engineer Charles E. Cassell. The cornerstone was laid in 1876.The monument's capstone was not placed until 1881, and the monument as a whole was not completed until 1893. The monument was placed in Olde Towne where a slave whipping post used to stand. The sheriff's office was responsible for whipping slaves 15 to 20 times as punishment. The four cast white bronze figures that surround the obelisk, including their heads and facial features, are largely generic. The sailor figure, for example, also appears outside the G.A.R. Memorial Hall in Wabash, Indiana. The city of Portsmouth \\"gave 1,242 men to the Confederacy of whom 199 were killed or died; Norfolk County gave 1,018 men to the cause of whom 280 were killed or died; and the City of Norfolk gave 1,119 of whom 176 were killed or died.\\"  Calls for removal and relocation  In August 2017, in the wake of the \\"Unite the Right\\" rally in Charlottesville Virginia where many white supremacist groups protested the removal of Confederate monuments, mayor of Portsmouth John Rowe called for the movement of the monument from its current location. Mayor Rowe's proposed new site for the monument is nearby Cedar Grove Cemetery where many Confederate soldiers are buried. Shortly after the mayor's announcement, a Change.org petition amassing over 30,000 signatures went viral started by a local Virginia man named Nathan Coflin to have the current monument replaced by a statue of Portsmouth native rap artist and businesswoman, Missy \\"Misdemeanor\\" Elliott. This petition received national attention in many publications such as Newsweek, CNN, People and Time magazine. On June 10, 2020 the Confederate soldier statues were beheaded by sledgehammer and one was toppled by Black Lives Matter protesters as the Police Department watched. A brass band played. One protester, Chris Green, was hit by the falling statue and sustained life-threatening injuries while standing near other people below it.

It currently has 21 congregations nationwide with a total of 3,650 members.LWF Statistics 2009 The current bishop of the ELCM is Solomon Rajah. History =Early history= The history of the ELCM can be traced back to the large scale immigration of Indians from the Tamil speaking areas of India from the 19th to 20th century to British Malaya as cheap labourers in plantations. Among the many migrants were Tamil Lutheran Christians from churches started by the work of the Danish-Halle Mission and Bartholom√§us Ziegenbalg. By 1900, missionaries from the India-based Leipzig Evangelical Lutheran Mission who visited Penang had found 315 Tamil Lutherans and by 1907, the first congregation was organised in Brickfields, Kuala Lumpur through the effort of Rev T.Joseph, a pastor from the church that was later organised as the Tamil Evangelical Lutheran Church (TELC). 1901‚Äì357 Lutherans who migrated to Malaya were found by Rev.T. Joseph of TELC who later came to reside in Kuala Lumpur in November 1906. 1902‚ÄîGerching of Leipzig Evangelical Lutheran Mission came to Singapore in 1902 to take survey of the Tamil Lutherans in Malaya . 1903‚Äì1905‚ÄîDuring these years as there had been no organised Lutheran congregations, many Tamil Lutherans attended worship in other churches and a considerable number joined other denominations. There were a number, however, remained strong in their loyalty to the Lutheran Church. The Lutherans were willing to support and attend the new church, but not to become full members. For a time, Lutherans in Kuala Lumpur attended the Anglican Church and later the Methodist Tamil Church on Malacca Street . Vedavanam (Anglican) and S.Abraham (Methodist) cared for their spiritual needs. As the years passed, they grew, and by the time they had reached 70 in number they thought of establishing a Church of their own. Reports of missionary visits and request from Malaya no doubt generated interest back in India. 1906‚ÄîOn 11 November, Pamperrien of the Leipzig Lutheran Mission visited Malaya to survey and assess the possibility of establishing a Lutheran ministry. 1907‚ÄîOn receiving positive feedback, Rev.T. Joseph immediately set about organising the Tamil Lutherans for regular divine services, the first of which was held on 30 January 1907 in a shop house at Scott Road off Brickfields in Kuala Lumpur . This day marked the beginning of a consolidated effort to establish Lutheran work in Malaysia . Simultaneously, the Leipzig Mission also assigned Ratnam, a school teacher turned catechist, to assist the work in the Penang area. 1908 ‚ÄîFollowing K.Pamperrien's visit, the Leipzig Mission in India showed greater interest in Malaysia and launched a constructive programme of development for the spread of Lutheranism. The immediate problem was identified in the lack of personnel to consolidate the work. Therefore, both the TELC in India and Leipzig Mission deployed missionaries for the work in Malaysia . The first Leipzig Lutheran missionary, Hermann Matthes arrived in 1908; the Lutheran population during this period was about 516 persons. Hermann Matthes helped to meet the spiritual needs of the Lutheran community in Penang area. By 1912, the Lutheran population had increased to 645 but was scattered in some 77 places in Malaysia and Singapore. This increase was due to the establishment of new contacts. The initial work among the Lutherans in Malaysia was not evangelistic in character but it sought to meet the sacramental needs of the members. Concerted evangelistic work among people of other faiths began after 1963. 1909‚ÄîOn 2 June a piece of land was purchased for construction of Zion church with money contributed by Leipzig Mission. The land was purchased for RM 2,900.00. 1910‚Äì1925‚Äî Matthes apparently left Penang . During the next fifteen years, the attention and work in Kuala Lumpur was directed to towards the building of the church. Matthews was replaced by Traugott Ruger, another German missionary from India. The outbreak of World War 1 resulted in T. Ruger being called back after a brief ministry in Malaysia. The enormous task of providing pastoral care for the Tamil Lutherans nationwide became the responsibility of Rev.T. Josephwho was based in Kuala Lumpur . Rev.T. Joseph to India and was replaced by Swamimuthu Muthusami on 11 November 1921. On 11 November 1922, the Foundation stone for Zion Church was laid by E. Heuman (First Bishop of Tranquebar). On 30 November 1924, J.Sandegren dedicated the Zion Church building (President of the CSM in South India, later 3rd Bishop of Tranquebar) Early efforts to organise and build up the pastoral care of the Tamil Lutherans in Malaya were spearheaded by missionaries from the TELC and the Leipzig Evangelical Lutheran Mission. By 1922, the organised congregations were divided into two regional circles of the TELC; the Northern Malaya District and the Southern Malaya District; centred in Penang and Kuala Lumpur respectively. =Attempts to establish a national church= After the Second World War, missionary work among the Tamil Lutherans in Malaya was supplemented by workers from the Church of Sweden Mission (CSM) and with the impending independence of Malaya in 1957, effort was made towards establishing a national church.ed. Hunt, Robert, Lee, Kam Hing, Roxborogh, John: \\"Christianity in Malaysia: A denominational history\\", Pelanduk Publications, 1992, In 1962, at the initiative of Bertil Envall of the Swedish Mission, representatives of the CSM and the Administrative Council of the American Lutheran mission to Chinese Lutherans in Malaya met for negotiations in a Joint Constitution Committee to set up a national Lutheran Church for Malaya. Representatives from the Batak Lutheran community supported by the Huria Kristen Batak Protestant were also invited but declined to participate.Vierow, Duain William. A comparison of Tamil and Chinese Lutheran Churches in Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore, DMiss thesis, Fuller Theological Seminary, 1976, 268pp. Despite agreeing on organisation and stewardship in general, disagreements arose upon the form of church government for the proposed national church. While the Swedish mission and the TELC order was partial to an episcopal polity, it was not accepted by the American missionaries who felt that the local Chinese Lutherans would not be familiar with that form of government. There were also disagreements on the nature of apostolic succession as well as the significant differences in the culture, language and origins between the Tamils and Chinese who were ministered by the respective missions, the former consisting mainly of established Tamil Lutheran families while the latter consisted mainly of congregations of young individual Chinese who were first generation Christians. =Establishment of the ELCM= As a result, two Lutheran church bodies were established in Malaya; the TELC districts in Malaya were reconstituted as the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Malaysia and Singapore (ELCMS) on 13 August 1962 whereas the mainly Chinese congregations of the American Mission was organised the Lutheran Church in Malaysia a year later on 3 August 1963 In 1966, Bertil Envall was consecrated as the first Bishop of the ELCMS. On 31 October 1976, E.B. Muthusami was consecrated as the first local Bishop. In 1994, due to the changes in legislation, congregations of the ELCMS in Singapore were separated and joined the Southern District of the Lutheran Church in Malaysia and Singapore to form the Lutheran Church in Singapore. The ELCMS was then renamed the ELCM. =Missions and social work= The ELCM actively supports local mission work as well as overseas mission work in Bangladesh, Myanmar, Indonesia and India. The ELCM pioneered work among people suffering from epilepsy when it set up a training centre for epileptic children in Hutan Melintang, Perak known as Bethany Home in the 1966. Beliefs and practices The ELCM is a member church of the Lutheran World Federation, a communion of Lutheran Churches throughout the world. As a Church in the Lutheran tradition, it accepts and confesses the teachings found in the unaltered Augsburg Confession, Luther's Small Catechism and the other confessional articles and symbols of the Book of Concord. =Languages in use= Due to the historical heritage of the ELCM, Tamil and English remains the primary language of ministry and liturgy in the church, but the use of Malay has been increased over the last decade. Structure and organisation =Overview= The polity of the ELCM is episcopal in structure. A Bishop is elected for life by the Diocesan Assembly which meets annually to decide on policy matters and elect a Diocesan Council chaired by the Bishop. The ELCM is further divided into 3 geographical districts for administrative purposes. =Districts of the ELCM= * Northern District :Congregations in the states of Penang and Perak * Central District :Congregations in the state of Selangor and the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur * Southern District :Congregations in the states of Negeri Sembilan and Johor =Bishops of the ELCM= The current Bishop, Solomon Rajah, is the fourth bishop of the ELCM and is responsible for the day-to-day administration, doctrinal, ministerial, pastoral, liturgical, ecclesiological, legislative and administrative matters of the church. * 1966-1976 : Bertil Envall * 1976-1988 : E.
