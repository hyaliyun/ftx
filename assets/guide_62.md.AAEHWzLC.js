Its mission is to \\"research, mediate, and convey the use of Catholic social teaching in practice\\" and it does this mainly through social analysis, political adult education, and organizational development.  History  = Mariazell Manifesto = In May 1952, a student day was held in the Austrian place of pilgrimage Mariazell to prepare for Catholic Day 1952, under the slogan A free church in a free society. In doing so, the principle was established of independence of the Catholic Church from partisan politics in Austria. The student day also called for a Catholic social program and training centre. The paper was later named the Mariazeller Manifesto. In 1954 a Social and Economic Policy Unit was created in the Archdiocese of Vienna. As a result, the Austrian Bishops' Conference decided in the spring conference of March 1958 to establish the Catholic Social Academy. The archbishop in Vienna Franz Kardinalk√∂nig drew up a statute and made it a church entity. On 1 October 1958, Jesuit Fr. Walter Riener was placed in charge of the Social Academy, as half-day lecturer and full-time secretary. In 1959 the premises were located in the Schottengasse. With this founding of the Catholic Social Academy of Austria, the training institution called for by the Mariazeller Manifesto was implemented as a part of the social program of the Austrian Catholics. = Social justice education = The creation of the social and economic policy unit of the Archdiocese of Vienna came earlier in 1954, with the mission of \\"research and dissemination of the Catholic social doctrine as well as promoting its application.\\" A differentiated program developed on the pillars of social policy, political adult education, and organizational development. From a three-month internship course for men, and later also for women, a course in \\"Social Responsibility\\" was developed, which confers the title \\"Academic Practitioners of Social Responsibility.\\" In addition to the two- and three-week social seminars for women, the Women's Academy was founded in the early 2000s. The two-year vocational course was awarded the \\"Innovation Award for Adult Education\\" and became the inspiration for a women's platform in 2007. In the mid-1970s, the Catholic Social Academy initiated talks between the Church and political parties as well as the Chamber of Labor and the trade unions, and intensified cooperation with their political academies. The political education work of the Social Academy led to projects in inner- and extra-church enterprises and focused on the humanization of the working world. The Academy's political education for adults assists in the development of persons and organizations, in innovation and finding alternatives, and in accompanying change. Organizational development happens through the introduction of ideas and skills, through participation in initiatives, and through the assumption of responsibility. = Issues = Guaranteed minimum income became a central theme of social policy in the mid-1980s, through the publications of the Academy. Starting with a study day entitled From quantity to quality of life, a book of the same name arose, and from it the fictional series Social Foci. At the end of the 1980s, the Academy played a decisive role in preparing the first Austrian poverty conference, which was held in Salzburg at the end of 1995. The creeping erosion of Sunday was countered by the Sunday Alliance, which was broadly based and included churches, trade unions, and economic and civil society organizations. The Academy won a prize for its International Fotoworkshop \\"In the focus: Sunday work.\\" Since the 2000s, the migration of families and their integration into society has been the subject of several studies and advocacy. Also during this time, the Academy coordinated the creation of an ecumenical social document in which fourteen Christian churches participated. Social Word (Sozialwort) of the World Council of Churches in Austria is a compass for social thinking and action. From 2004, the ethics of financial investment was discussed. In 2008, a fund was set up to subsidize resources for new programs which the current budget doesn't cover.  Organization  The Board of Trustees of the Social Academy, in addition to the Unit Bureau, includes representatives from all the dioceses of the Austrian Bishops' Conferences, the Social Science Institutes at the Austrian Universities, Catholic Action of Austria, the social partners, and the management of the Academy. In addition, a program committee is provided for in the Articles of Incorporation. The Academy is an active member of the Forum of Catholic Adult Education in Austria.

This entity is legally constituted by the Professional Code of Quebec.Professional Code of Quebec, article 17 The head office of the \\"Conseil interprofessionnel du Qu√©bec\\" (CIQ) is located at 550, rue Sherbrooke Ouest in Montreal.  History  The Quebec Interprofessional Council, established in 1965 under the 3rd part of the Quebec Companies Act, is a non-profit organization (legal person).Professional Code of Quebec, article 18. The CIQ was initially the voluntary grouping of 15 professional corporations, referred to as \\"professional orders\\" since 1994. When the Professional Code of Quebec was adopted in 1973, which came into force in 1974, the Council's existence and role were recognized by specific legislative provisions. In addition to regrouping the professional orders, he was entrusted, in parallel with the newly created Office des professions du Qu√©bec, as an advisory body to the public authority. In this regard, the Professional Code of Quebec may be consulted under the Professional Legislation section of the Commission's home page. In 1990, the CIQ instituted a system of recognition and honour for the entire Quebec professional system. This program includes a prestigious \\"Prix\\" awarded annually to a person and a \\"Merit\\" prize awarded annually by the CIQ to a professional of each of the orders. This award is bestowed by the CIQ to highlight the exceptional career of distinguished professionals as well as their contribution to the influence of their profession and the development of Qu√©bec's professional system. The work that symbolizes the \\"Prix du CIQ\\" is a solid silver medal. The first CIQ website was launched on May 24, 2002.  Members of the Council  The Council brings together the 46 professional orders in Quebec, which collectively have more than 385,000 members (see list of orders below).  Mission  The Conseil is a grouping of professional bodies to which the Professional Code of Quebec recognizes an existence and grants an advisory body to the governmental authority. As a grouping of \\"professional orders\\", the Council: * Provides opportunities for exchange and mutual assistance to professional orders; * Intervenes, when appropriate, as a place of mobilization and collective voice of professional orders on matters of common interest; * Acts as a service unit to the professional orders, according to the mandates and budgets adopted; * Acts as a reference to the public concerned, using an information approach on the value of the professional status and system and the promotion of the public interest that results from it. As an advisory body to the public authority, the Council is consulted, inter alia, on: * General and particular orientations of the professional system, * Bills or regulations affecting the system, * The appointment of certain officers and members of the Office des professions du Qu√©bec, * The appointment of non-member directors, * The contribution to the funding of the Office des professions du Qu√©bec, * The budget estimates of the Office des professions du Qu√©bec, * The constitution of a new Order or the integration of a professional order. Some of the Council's interventions are required by law. It may be a request from the government or the minister to which the law requires a response or a consultation step under the act. The Council may also, on its own initiative and after consulting its members, carry out other interventions. The Council therefore issues opinions on various projects relating to governmental and legislative actions that affect the purpose, coherence and effectiveness of the professional system. Finally, the Conseil contributes to debates on issues important to Qu√©bec society, in a broad public interest perspective.  Order to protect  In 2013, the Conseil interprofessionnel du Qu√©bec and the 45 professional colleges jointly launched an information campaign that aims to reinforce public confidence in professionals and professional orders: * The role of professional bodies and the means available to them; * The social and economic contribution of professional orders and their members. Under the theme \\"Order to Protect\\", this campaign is based on a blogging typeMicrosite of the 2013 campaign \\"Order to Protect\\" and takes place primarily in social media.  Recognition of internationally trained individuals  Recognition of the skills of internationally trained individuals has been a hot topic for many years, and the Quebec Professional Orders are doing well on this. For example, there are \\"mutual recognition agreements\\" (MRAs) for graduate professionals in some countries. This is notably the case for France. The Quebec-France Accord, signed in 2008, ensures that graduates from 25 professionsEntente France-Qu√©bec sur la reconnaissance mutuelle des comp√©tences have their diploma recognized as equivalent in both jurisdictions. At the end of 2012, 624 professionals graduated in France and 119 professionals graduated in Quebec had received an MRA. When a person is a graduate of a country that does not have an MRA with Quebec, the candidate must then follow the process of recognition of an equivalence, described in detail on the website of the \\"Conseil Interprofessionnel du Qu√©bec\\".Web site of CIQ The number of applications for recognition of foreign diplomas has increased by more than 600% in 15 years. The 45 professional orders in Quebec shared more than 5,000 applications in 2011-2012. The College of Engineers and the Nurses are most in demand, accounting for more than 40% of the total number of applications received. Of the applications received in 2011-2012, almost 95% were accepted in full or partially. This means that only 5% of the files were refused, which corresponds to the reality of the last 5 years. The overall picture of the recognition of equivalences in the Quebec system is positive. This demonstrates the importance that professional bodies place on efforts to improve their processes for recognizing the skills of internationally trained individuals.  Annual prices of the CIQ  The CIQ awards the \\"CIQ Award\\" generally to one member per year of each professional order for its contribution to the advancement of its profession.

The Centre tries to meet the major social and legal needs of native and foreign workers in the greater Taipei area, while also responding to emergencies and to the needs of the aboriginal peoples of Northern Taiwan.  History  = Social Service Centre = Since the 1950s the Society of Jesus in Taiwan has pastored parishes among the Atayal tribe in north-central Taiwan and Jesuits in the cities have advocated for the rights of workers and of the disabled. In the 1960s, the American Jesuit E. Dowd founded in Hsinchu a vocational school and dormitory for young workers. This work has evolved into the Catholic Social Service Centre in Hsinchu. = Rerum Novarum Centre = In 1971 Jesuits responded to the increasing influx of workers into Taipei by opening a centre that gathered information on problems facing workers, that trained union leaders, and that monitored the government's labour policies. The centre was named after Rerum Novarum (\\"Of New Things\\"), the 1891 encyclical of Pope Leo XIII which was the first in a series of social encyclicals in the Catholic church. By the 1980s Rerum Novarum Centre was offering legal advice along with health and safety services for workers and was publishing books on worker issues. These issues grew to include advocacy for workers' rights, anti- nuclear power and the environment. By the 1990s the Center's work had grown in assisting foreign workers and in tending to occupational injuries. Then after the Jiji earthquake in 1999 services were increased on behalf of the aboriginal communities of Nantou and Hsinchu counties.

She was born in Kenya and worked as an accountant before entering politics. Following a special recount ordered by the Court of Disputed Returns, in April 2017 she was declared to have been elected at the 2016 election for the Family First Party. This followed the court's decision that Bob Day had not been eligible to stand for election. Gichuhi originally sat in the Senate as an independent, after refusing to join the Family First Party in merging into the Australian Conservatives. She joined the Liberal Party in February 2018, but failed to win re-election at the 2019 federal election. Before politics Gichuhi grew up in the rural village of Hiriga, Nyeri County, Kenya Colony (present day Hiraga, Nyeri County, Kenya). Between school, she worked to gather food from the garden or help milk the family's cows. Gichuhi is the first of her father Justus Weru Munyiri's ten children. Her father and brother still live in her ancestral home in Hiriga village in Mathira East sub-county Nyeri. She moved to Nairobi where she trained as an accountant at the University of Nairobi. She was an accountant with various auditing firms before moving to South Australia in 1999 with her husband William and three children. She worked at Ernst and Young and the South Australian Auditor-General's department developing programs for migrants and international students. She completed a Bachelor of Law from the University of South Australia in 2015. Prior to her appointment to the Senate, she was volunteering as a lawyer for the Women's Legal Service. Election Family First leader Bob Day had been his party's lead Senate candidate in South Australia at the election on 2 July 2016, with Gichuhi the second and only other (a ticketwith its advantage of attracting votes above the line, which is how most electors voterequires a minimum of two candidates). The party received 24,817 votes above the line; below the line, Day received 5,495 votes and Gichuhi 152. Day resigned on 1 November 2016 after the collapse of his homebuilding business, and was retroactively disqualified on 5 April 2017 for having an indirect interest in a building where the Commonwealth was paying rent for his Commonwealth-funded electorate office. At the High Court's direction, the Australian Electoral Commission performed a special recount of Senate votes in South Australia. The Court envisaged that this would result in Gichuhi replacing Day. With Day excluded, all Family First votes above the line flowed to Gichuhi, and she was elected in the recount.. Her election and term were dated from 1 July 2016, in common with all Senators elected in 2016. In this profile, as of 28 April 2017, her term was deemed have begun on 1 July 2016 (in common with Senators elected on 2 July 2016); as of 21 May 2017, the term is dated to 19 April 2017. She was elected to serve the balance of Day's term, which was set at three years rather than the usual six owing to the 2016 election being a double dissolution; as a result, her term was due to end on 30 June 2019. =Citizenship= Senator Gichuhi was born in Kenya and is the first person of Black African descent to be elected to the Australian Parliament. Before her election, a question was raised in the court about Gichuhi's eligibility on citizenship grounds. However this was not an issue as Kenya did not allow dual citizenship and she became an Australian citizen in July 2001, two years after her arrival in 1999. The Constitution of Kenya that was current at the time meant that any person who voluntarily applied for the citizenship elsewhere lost his or her Kenyan citizenship. Since 2010, Kenya has allowed dual citizenship; however, people who had lost their citizenship under the old law are required to apply if they wish to regain it. The High Court rejected the Australian Labor Party's challenge to her eligibility. Later, Parliament changed the retroactive date of her term to 19 April 2017, when her eligibility was finally decided. =Party status= On 25 April 2017, Family First announced it was merging with the Australian Conservatives party founded by Cory Bernardi. Gichuhi told the leaders of both parties that she had no intention of joining the Conservatives, and would sit as an Independent when Family First was disbanded. The Senate counted her as part of the Family First Party up to 3 May 2017 and as an Independent from that date up to 1 February 2018. On 2 February 2018, Gichuhi joined the Liberals, with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull personally welcoming her to the party in a video posted to his Twitter account. Gichuhi said that she realised \\"how Liberal I am at the core\\" when she gave her maiden speech a year earlier. She had already been voting with the Coalition fairly often since taking her Senate seat. In July 2018, Gichuhi was demoted to an unwinnable fourth position on the Liberal Party's South Australian Senate ticket for the next federal election. Endorsements from Turnbull, former Prime Minister John Howard and state Liberal president John Olsen were not enough to prevent her from being bypassed in favour of City of Adelaide councillor Alex Antic for the third slot on the ticket. Although she is an ardent social conservative, she never won favour among the SA Liberals' conservative faction, even though Olsen‚Äìa former premier and himself a conservative‚Äìplayed a key role in wooing her to the Liberals.https://www.sbs.com.au/news/lucy-gichuhi-faces-senate-dumping In September, Gichuhi revealed that she was asked during her preselection process if she thought Turnbull was the right person to lead the Liberal Party. At the 2019 election, Gichuhi only garnered 2,500 votes, and the Liberal vote was nowhere near enough for her to retain her seat. As a result, her Senate term ended on 30 June 2019.http://psephos.adam- carr.net/countries/a/australia/2019/2019senatesa.txt Political views Despite having grown up in rural Kenya, Gichuhi says that the concept of poverty never entered her mind, and she is firmly against government handouts as she believes \\"they create victims and nobody wins\\". She said her Christian faith was the backbone of her political beliefs, but strongly supports freedom of religion. She is a public opponent of same sex marriage, and stated that she would vote against any proposed bill, regardless of the results of the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey. On 29 November 2017 when the bill was voted in the Senate, Gichuhi was one of twelve senators who voted against it. In January 2018, Gichuhi visited Kenya and was the guest on television talk show Jeff Koinange Live hosted by Jeff Koinange on Citizen TV., In June 2018, a clip from this interview was widely reported in Australia quoting that she had said that her $200,000 salary in Australia is \\"not a lot of money\\".

USIs were introduced in late 2012 in the U.S. in the context of Dodd‚ÄìFrank regulation, where reporting of transactions to Trade Repositories first became mandatory. European financial market regulations followed suit, with reporting to Trade Repositories under EMIR requiring UTIs from February 2014 on. The use of the UTI is also mandatory for regulatory reporting under REMIT. Strictly speaking, the term USI is specific to the U.S. regulation, while UTI is specific to EU regulations. In practice, both terms are used interchangeable, in particular within large trading firms reporting under both regimes.  Structure  A UTI/USI is an alphanumeric code of fixed length, with the maximum length defined as either 42 (U.S.) or 52 (EU) characters. The UTI typically consists of a prefix followed by the concatenated code value. Taken together, prefix and value form the UTI, and should be globally unique. The prefix portion of the UTI code should be a unique code for the code issueing authority. Ideally, the prefix would have reused the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) of the entity issueing the UTI. LEI codes are used across the financial reporting regimes in the U.S. (Dodd-Frank) and Europe (EMIR / MiFID). However, the LEI code length of 20 characters represented a problem for many systems, which in practice limited the usable prefix length to 10 characters. In June 2013, ISDA working groups suggested that the characters 7 through 16 of the 20 character global LEI number should be used as the UTI prefix. This would have led to clashes between UTIs generated for different organisations having the same characters 7 through 16 in their LEIs. The current recommendation by the BIS, based on the CPMI/IOSCO Harmonization Group consultations regarding the prefix (the mint component of the UTI), is: \\"With regard to what code should constitute the mint component, the CPMI and IOSCO have applied the preference for using existing international standards and have selected the LEI code\\".https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d158.pdf The second component of the UTI is the code value, sometimes called the Transaction Identifier part. The CFTC defines the transaction identifier part as an alphanumeric code of variable length, up to a maximum of 32 characters. In addition to alphanumeric characters, certain special characters are permissible as internal delimiters: colon, hyphen, period, and underscore. These special characters may not start or end the code, nor may they be used consecutively. The ESMA recommend that the Trade ID should be formed by the concatenation (without separators) of the three elements; the characters 'E02', the LEI of the generating entity and a unique Trade ID generated by the generating entity. The prefixes 'E00' through 'E99' are reserved by the ESMA. Check digits are not a prescribed part of the UTI, but some issueing systems have them as part of the code value.

He has received numerous nominations and awards. He is married to the visual artist and jewellery designer Petra Hartman.https://www.petrahartman.nl Career Ruud-Jan Kokke studied at the Sociale Academie (College for Social Studies) and at the Academy of Fine Arts in Arnhem. He is considered a designer in the tradition of Gerrit Rietveld developing his first chairs in his workshop. In 1986 he started his own label, Ruud-Jan Kokke Product & Design. Since then his furniture has been produced by companies such as Metaform, Leolux, Spectrum Design Eindhoven, Kembo, Auping and Ahrend. His first interior designs date from the early nineties. In close cooperation with his partner, Petra Hartman, he has also designed various school interiors. Objects The Kokke chair designed in 1984, was first produced in series by Metaform in 1988 and can now be found in the permanent collection of the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam. It is made of flexible slats and has a transparent and strong structure. The notorious TC museum stool from 1990 was made for Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam and is named after Trees Coenders, who was looking for a lightweight stool that was easy to carry and also easy to stack.http://www.dutchbydesign.com/tc-stool It is now serving in several other museums and is collected by the MoMa New York under the title ‚ÄúWander‚Äù Stacking Stool. Four years later, in 1992, Kokke designed the Kokkestok, a walking stick which is easy to use because of the long curl, the stiff end and the rubber strip on the side. Several other furniture designs followed, often in commission, such as the chairs for the restaurant of the Province House in Groningen in 1991, the Next bed for Auping (1996) and the Ahrend Run sofa (2009).

Interior design and design for public space In the mid-1990s, interior and public space became increasingly important. Often this concerned the upgrading of squares and parks or the renovation of existing buildings, such as the City Hall Arnhem (2007/2008) and several local Rabobank buildings.https://www.helldorferlasbedrijf.nl/stadhuis.html With the new millennium Kokke started a series of interior designs for schools, such as Moza√Øek College Arnhem (2001/2002), Het Stedelijk Zutphen (2010) and Canisius College Nijmegen (2016), and sports facilities, such as Olympiaplein Amsterdam (2008).

A Phase II/III clinical trial in 607 people, comparing it to the established vitamin K antagonist warfarin, found no difference in quality of anticoagulation or side effects between the two drugs in the overall population. Among patients taking CYP2C9 interacting drugs however, the tecarfarin patients‚Äô TTR was 72.2% (n=92) vs 69.9% (n=87) for warfarin patients (pint=0.16); among patients who had both a CYP2C9 variant allele and taking a CYP2C9 interacting drug, TTR was 76.5% and 69.5% for the tecarfarin (n=24) and warfarin (n=31) groups, respectively (pint=0.24). This study included in 84 (14%) patients with a mechanical heart valve as an indication for anticoagulation therapy. No thrombotic or embolic events were observed in the tecarfarin treated subjects. In contrast to warfarin, tecarfarin is not affected by the cytochrome P450 inhibiting drug fluconazole, indicating a lower potential for interactions with other drugs. A randomized, pharmacokinetic study in which healthy volunteer subjects and patients with severe chronic kidney disease received single-dose warfarin or tecarfarin in a crossover design was performed. This showed that mean plasma concentrations of (S)-warfarin and (R,S)-warfarin were higher (44 and 27%, respectively) in the subjects with CKD than in the healthy subjects. Both of these values fell outside of the 90% confidence interval of equivalence. For tecarfarin, the difference was less than 15% higher. Elimination half-life (t1/2) increased by 20% for (S)-warfarin and by 8% for (R,S)-warfarin and decreased by 8% for tecarfarin.

In contrast to the uniqueness of this translation-invariant uniformity, in general, many different norms (e.g. equivalent norms) and metrics may be used to determine completeness of such space. translation-invariant uniformity that induces the topology on . This notion of \\"TVS-completeness\\" depends only on vector subtraction and the topology of the TVS and so can be applied to all TVSs, including those whose topologies can not be defined in terms metrics (or pseudometrics). The notions of completeness for normed spaces and metrizable TVSs, which are commonly defined in terms of completeness of a particular norm or metric, can both be reduced down to this notion of TVS-completeness; a notion that is independent of any particular norm or metric. A metrizable topological vector space with a translation invariant metric is complete as a TVS if and only if is a complete metric space, meaning that every Cauchy sequence converges to some point. All topological vector spaces, even those that are not metrizable or Hausdorff, have a completion. Completeness is an extremely important property that a topological vector space can have and prominent examples of complete metrizable topological vector spaces are Fr√©chet spaces, Banach spaces, and Hilbert spaces. Prominent examples of complete TVS that are (typically) non-metrizable include strict LF-spaces and nuclear spaces like the Schwartz space of smooth functions and the spaces of distributions and test functions.  Definitions  We now summarize the definition of a complete topological vector space (TVS) in terms of both nets and prefilters. Information about convergence of nets and filters, such as definitions and properties, can be found in the article about filters in topology. Every topological vector spaces (TVS) is a commutative topological group with identity under addition and the canonical uniformity of a TVS is defined entirely in terms of subtraction (and thus addition); scalar multiplication is not involved and no additional structure is needed. = Cauchy net definition of a complete TVS = = Canonical uniformity and complete subsets =  Preliminaries: Uniform spaces  Assume that , , and are subsets of and . * if and only if . Moreover, and is symmetric. * If and then . * Associativity: . * . If is endowed with this topology, then: * A subset is open in this topology if and only if for every , there exists some such that . * For any , .  Canonical uniformity definition  Remarks: * The canonical uniformity on any TVS is translation-invariant. * The same canonical uniformity would result by using a neighborhood basis of the origin rather the filter of all neighborhoods of the origin. * If then contains the diagonal } * For any and , :: and . * If is symmetric (i.e. ) then is symmetric (that is, ) and ::. * The above set equalities show that the topology induced on by the canonical uniformity is the same as the topology that started with (i.e. it is ). = Uniqueness =  Cauchy prefilters  The general theory of uniform spaces has its own definition of a \\"Cauchy prefilter.\\" For the canonical uniformity on , it reduces down to the definition described below. Similarly, the more general definition of a Cauchy net for uniform spaces reduces down to the definition Cauchy net that was given above. Remark: * Suppose is a prefilter on a TVS and . Then in if and only if and is Cauchy.  Complete TVSs and complete subsets  :Remark: Recall that for any , a prefilter on is necessarily a subset of ; that is, . * Remark (Convergence outside of is allowed): If is not Hausdorff and if every Cauchy prefilter on converges to some point of , then will be complete even if some or all Cauchy prefilters on also converge to points(s) in . In short, there is no requirement that these Cauchy prefilters on converge only to points in . The same can be said of the convergence of Cauchy nets in . ** As a consequence, if a TVS is not Hausdorff, then every subset of the closure of }, say }, is complete (since it is clearly compact and every compact set is necessarily complete). So in particular, if (e.g. if a is singleton set such as }) then would be complete even though every Cauchy net in (and every Cauchy prefilter on ), converges to every point in } (include those points in } that are not in ). ** This example also shows that complete subsets (indeed, even compact subsets) of a non-Hausdorff space may fail to be closed. (e.g. if } then is closed if and only if }). Remark: * Neighborhood basis: Suppose is a completion of a TVS with and that is a neighborhood base of the origin in . Then the set ::} is a neighborhood basis at the origin in . ;Uniform continuity  TVS completeness vs completeness of (pseudo)metrics  = Preliminaries: Complete pseudometric spaces = We review the basic notions related to the general theory of complete pseudometric spaces. Recall that every metric is a pseudometric and that a pseudometric is a metric if and only if implies . Thus every metric space is a pseudometric space and a pseudometric space is a metric space if and only if is a metric. Every pseudometric on a set induces the usual canonical topology on , which we'll denote by ; it also induces a canonical uniformity on , which we'll denote by . The topology on induced by the uniformity is equal to . A net in is Cauchy with respect to if and only if it is Cauchy with respect to the uniformity . The pseudometric space is a complete (resp. a sequentially complete) pseudometric space if and only if is a complete (resp. a sequentially complete) uniform space. Moreover, the pseudometric space (resp. the uniform space ) is complete if and only if it is sequentially complete. = Complete pseudometrics and complete TVSs = Every F-space, and thus also every Fr√©chet space, Banach space, and Hilbert space is a complete TVS. Note that every F-space is a Baire space but there are normed spaces that are Baire but not Banach. Suppose is pseudometrizable TVS (e.g. a metrizable TVS) and that is any pseudometric on such that the topology on induced by is equal to . If is translation-invariant, then is a complete TVS if and only if is a complete pseudometric space. If is not translation-invariant, then may be possible for to be a complete TVS but to not be a complete pseudometric space (see this footnoteRecall that is a Banach space where the absolute value is a norm that induces the usual Euclidean topology on . Define a metric on {{math‚Ñù} by for all , where one may show that induces the usual Euclidean topology on . However, is not a complete metric since the sequence defined by is a -Cauchy sequence that does not converge in to any point of . Note also that this -Cauchy sequence is not a Cauchy sequence in (i.e. it is not a Cauchy sequence with respect to the norm ). for an example). = Complete norms and equivalent norms = Two norms on a vector space are called equivalent if and only if they induce the same topology. If and are two equivalent norms on a vector space then the normed space is a Banach space if and only if is a Banach space. See this footnote for an example of a continuous norm on a Banach space that is not is not equivalent to that Banach space's given norm.Let denotes the Banach space of continuous functions with the supremum norm, let where is given the topology induced by , and denote the restriction of the L1-norm to by . Then one may show that so that the norm is a continuous function. However, is not equivalent to the norm and so in particular, is not a Banach space. All norms on a finite-dimensional vector space are equivalent and every finite-dimensional normed space is a Banach space.see Corollary 1.4.18, p. 32 in .  Completions  = Non-uniqueness of all completions = As the example below shows, regardless of whether or not a space is Hausdorff or already complete, every topological vector space (TVS) has infinitely many non-isomorphic completions. However, every Hausdorff TVS has a Hausdorff completion that is unique up to TVS-isomorphism. But nevertheless, every Hausdorff TVS still has infinitely many non-isomorphic non-Hausdorff completions. = Hausdorff completions = Every Hausdorff TVS has a Hausdorff completion that is unique up to TVS-isomorphism. But nevertheless, as shown above, every Hausdorff TVS still has infinitely many non-isomorphic non- Hausdorff completions. ;Existence of Hausdorff completions If is a Cauchy filter on then the filter generated by the following prefilter: ::} is the unique minimal Cauchy filter on that is contained as a subset of . In particular, for any , the neighborhood filter at is a minimal Cauchy filter. Let be the set of all minimal Cauchy filters on and let be the map defined by sending to the neighborhood filter of in . We endow with the following vector space structure. Given and a scalar , let (resp. ) denote the unique minimal Cauchy filter contained in the filter generated by } (resp. }). For every balanced neighborhood of in , let ::}. If is Hausdorff then the collection of all sets , as ranges over all balanced neighborhoods of in , forms a vector topology on making into a complete Hausdorff TVS. Moreover, the map is a TVS- embedding onto a dense vector subspace of . If is a metrizable TVS then a Hausdorff completion of can be constructed using equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences instead of minimal Cauchy filters. = Non-Hausdorff completions = We now show how every non-Hausdorff TVS can be TVS-embedded onto a dense vector subspace of a complete TVS. The proof that every Hausdorff TVS has a Hausdorff completion is widely available so we use its conclusion to prove that every non-Hausdorff TVS also has a completion. These details are sometimes useful for extending results from Hausdorff TVSs to non-Hausdorff TVSs. Let us write } for the closure of the origin in , where is endowed with its subspace topology induced by (so that has the indiscrete topology). Since has the trivial topology, it is easily shown that every vector subspace of that is an algebraic complement of in is necessarily a topological complement of in . Let denote any topological complement of in , which is necessarily a Hausdorff TVS (since it is TVS-isomorphic to the quotient TVS This particular quotient map is in fact also a closed map.). Since is the topological direct sum of and (which means that in the category of TVSs), the canonical map ::, given by is a TVS-isomorphism. Let denote the inverse of this canonical map. (As a side note, it follows that every open and every closed subset of satisfies .Let be a neighborhood of in . Since is a neighborhood of in we can pick an open (resp. closed) neighborhood of in such that is a neighborhood of the origin. Clearly, is open (resp. closed) if and only if is open (resp. closed). Let so that where is open (resp. closed) if and only if is open (resp. closed).) The Hausdorff TVS can be TVS-embedded, say via the map , onto a dense vector subspace of its completion . Since and are complete, so is their product . Let denote the identity map and observe that the product map is a TVS-embedding whose image is dense in . Define the mapExplicitly, this map is defined as follows: for each , if we let then . Thus for all and , we have . :: by which is a TVS-embedding of onto a dense vector subspace of the complete TVS . Moreover, observe that the closure of the origin in is equal to }, and that } and are topological complements in . = Topology of a completion = = Properties preserved by completions = If a TVS has any of the following properties then so does its completion: * Hausdorff * Locally convex * Pseudometrizable * Metrizable * Seminormable * Normable * Moreover, if is a normed space, then the completion can be chosen to be a Banach space such that the TVS-embedding of into is an isometry. * Hausdorff pre-Hilbert. That is, a TVS induced by an inner product. * Every inner product space has a completion that is a Hilbert space, where the inner product is the unique continuous extension to of the original inner product . The norm induced by is also the unique continuous extension to of the norm induced by . * Nuclear * Barrelled * Mackey * DF-space ;Other preserved properties * If is a Hausdorff TVS, then the continuous dual space of is identical to the continuous dual space of the completion of . * The completion of the projective tensor product of two nuclear spaces is nuclear. * The completion of a nuclear space is TVS-isomorphic with a projective limit of Hilbert spaces. * The completion of a locally convex bornological space is a barrelled space. * Suppose that and are DF-spaces. Then the projective tensor product, as well as its completion, of these spaces is a DF-space. * = Properties of maps preserved by extensions to a completion = * Let and be two Hausdorff TVSs with complete. Let be a completion of . Let denote the vector space of continuous linear operators and let denote the map that sends every to its unique continuous linear extension on . Then is a (surjective) vector space isomorphism. Moreover, maps families of equicontinuous subsets onto each other. Suppose that is endowed with a ùí¢-topology and that denotes the closures in of sets in ùí¢. Then the map is also a TVS-isomorphism. The completion of the projective tensor product of two nuclear spaces is nuclear. * The completion of a nuclear space is TVS-isomorphic with a projective limit of Hilbert spaces. * Let be a nuclear linear operator between two locally convex spaces and let be a completion of . Then has a unique continuous linear extension to a nuclear linear operator .  Sufficient conditions for a complete TVS  * Any TVS endowed with the trivial topology is complete and every one of its subsets is complete. * Moreover, every TVS with the trivial topology is compact and hence locally compact. Thus a complete seminormable locally convex and locally compact TVS need not be finite-dimensional if it is not Hausdorff. * An arbitrary product of complete (resp. sequentially complete, quasi-complete) TVSs has that same property. If all spaces are Hausdorff, then the converses are also true. * A product of Hausdorff completions of a family of (Hausdorff) TVSs is a Hausdorff completion of their product TVS. * More generally, an arbitrary product of complete subsets of a family of TVSs is a complete subset of the product TVS. * The projective limit of a projective system of Hausdorff complete (resp. sequentially complete, quasi-complete) TVSs has that same property. * A projective limit of Hausdorff completions of an inverse system of (Hausdorff) TVSs is a Hausdorff completion of their projective limit. * If is a closed vector subspace of a complete pseudometrizable TVS , then the quotient space is complete. * Suppose is a complete vector subspace of a metrizable TVS . If the quotient space is complete then so is . * There exists a complete TVS having a closed vector subspace such that the quotient TVS is not complete. * Every F-space, Fr√©chet space, Banach space, and Hilbert space is a complete TVS. * Strict LF-spaces and strict LB-spaces are complete. * Suppose that is a dense subset of a TVS . If every Cauchy filter on converges to some point in then is complete. * The Schwartz space of smooth functions is complete. * The spaces of distributions and test functions is complete. * Suppose that and are locally convex TVSs and that the space of continuous linear maps is endowed with the topology of uniform convergence on bounded subsets of . If is a bornological space and if is complete then is a complete TVS. * In particular, the strong dual of a bornological space is complete. However, it need not be bornological. * Every quasi-complete DF-space is complete. * Let and be Hausdorff TVS topologies on a vector space such that . If there exists a prefilter such that is a neighborhood basis at for and such that every is a complete subset of , then is a complete TVS.  Properties  = Complete TVSs = * Every TVS has a completion and every Hausdorff TVS has a Hausdorff completion. * Every complete TVS is quasi-complete space and sequentially complete. * However, the converses of the above implications are generally false. * If a TVS has a complete neighborhood of the origin then it is complete. * Every complete pseudometrizable TVS is a barrelled space and a Baire space (and thus non-meager). * The dimension of a complete metrizable TVS is either finite or uncountable. * There exists a sequentially complete locally convex TVS that is not quasi-complete. = Cauchy nets and prefilters = * Every convergent net (resp. prefilter) in a TVS is necessarily a Cauchy net (resp. a Cauchy prefilter). * Any prefilter that is subordinate to (i.e. finer than) a Cauchy prefilter is necessarily also a Cauchy prefilter. * Suppose is a TVS and . If is a cluster point of a Cauchy net (resp. Cauchy prefilter), then that Cauchy net (resp. that Cauchy prefilter) converges to in . * If a Cauchy filter in a TVS has an accumulation point then it converges to . * Uniformly continuous maps send Cauchy nets to Cauchy nets. * The filter associated with a sequence in a TVS is Cauchy if and only if the sequence is a Cauchy sequence. * A Cauchy sequence in a Hausdorff TVS is not necessarily relatively compact (i.e. its closure in is not necessarily compact). * Every convergent prefilter is a Cauchy prefilter. * Any neighborhood basis of any point in a TVS is a Cauchy prefilter. * Any prefilter finer than a Cauchy prefilter is also a Cauchy prefilter. * Suppose that is a family of TVSs and that denotes the product of these TVSs. Suppose that for every index , is a prefilter on . Then the product of this family of prefilters is a Cauchy filter on if and only if each is a Cauchy filter on . = Maps = * If is any TVS then the quotient map is a closed map. * Thus * Suppose that is a uniformly continuous map from a dense subset of a TVS into a complete Hausdorff TVS . Then has a unique uniformly continuous extension to all of . * If in addition is a homomorphism then its unique uniformly continuous extension is also a homomorphism. * This remains true if \\"TVS\\" is replaced by \\"commutative topological group.\\" * Note that is not required to be a linear map and that is not required to be a vector subspace of . * Suppose be a continuous linear operator between two Hausdorff TVSs. If is a dense vector subspace of and if the restriction to is a topological homomorphism then is also a topological homomorphism. * So if and are Hausdorff completions of and , respectively, and if is a topological homomorphism, then 's unique continuous linear extension is a topological homomorphism. (Note that it's possible for to be surjective but for to not be injective.) * Suppose and are Hausdorff TVSs, is a dense vector subspace of , and is a dense vector subspaces of . If are and are topologically isomorphic additive subgroups via a topological homomorphism then the same is true of and via the unique uniformly continuous extension of (which is also a homeomorphism). * Suppose that is an injective topological homomorphism from a complete TVS into a Hausdorff TVS. Then the range of (i.e. is a closed subspace of . * Suppose that is a topological homomorphism from a complete metrizable TVS into a Hausdorff TVS. Then the range of is a closed subspace of . * The image of a totally bounded subset under a uniformly continuous map between two Hausdorff TVSs is again totally bounded. * If is a uniformly continuous map between two Hausdorff TVSs then the image under of a precompact subset of is a precompact subset of . = Subsets = ;Complete subsets * Every complete subset of a TVS is sequentially complete. * A complete subset of a Hausdorff TVS is a closed subset of . * Suppose that is a complete subset of a TVS (the TVS is not necessarily Hausdorff or complete). Then any subset of that is closed in is complete. * Every compact subset of a TVS is complete (even if the TVS is not Hausdorff or not complete). * Closed subsets of a complete TVS are complete. * Note that if a TVS is not complete then is a closed subset of that is not complete. * The empty set is complete subset of every TVS. ;Relation to compact subsets * A subset of a TVSThe TVS is not assumed to be Hausdorff or complete. is compact if and only if it is complete and totally bounded.Proof: Suppose is compact in and let be a Cauchy filter on . Let so that is a Cauchy filter of closed sets. Since has the finite intersection property, there exists some such that for all so (i.e. is an accumulation point of ). Since is Cauchy, in . Thus is complete. That is also totally bounded follows immediately from the compactness of . * Thus a closed and totally bounded subset of a complete TVS is compact. * Every complete totally bounded set is relatively compact. * A subset of a TVS is totally bounded if and only if its image under the canonical quotient map (which is a closed map) is totally bounded. Thus is totally bounded if and only if is totally bounded. * for every subset .Since if then . Since , if is closed then equality holds. Clearly, the complement of any set satisfying the equality must also satisfy this equality. * So if is open or closed in then (so is a \\"tube\\" with vertical side }). * The quotient map is a closed map onto a Hausdorff TVS. * If is compact, then and this set is compact. Thus the closure of a compact set is compactIn general topology, the closure of a compact subset of a non-Hausdorff space may fail to be compact (e.g. the particular point topology on an infinite set). This result shows that this does not happen in non-Hausdorff TVSs. The proof uses and that fact that is compact (but possibly not closed) and is both closed and compact so that , which is the image of the compact set under the continuous addition map , is also compact. Recall also that the sum of a compact set (i.e. ) and a closed set is closed so is closed in . (i.e. all compact sets are relatively compact). Thus the closure of a compact set is compact. * In any TVS, the closure of a totally bounded subset is again totally bounded. * In a complete locally convex space, the convex hull and the disked hull of a compact set are both compact. * More generally, if is a compact subset of a locally convex space, then the convex hull (resp. the disked hull ) is compact if and only if it is complete. * In a locally convex space, the convex hull and the disked hull of a totally bounded set is totally bounded. * Every subset of is compact and thus complete (see footnote for proof).Given any open cover of , pick any open set from that cover that contains the origin. Since is a neighborhood of the origin, contains and thus contains . In particular, if is not Hausdorff then there exist compact complete sets that are not closed. * If is a subset of a TVS such that every sequence in has a cluster point in then is totally bounded. * A subset of a Hausdorff TVS is totally bounded if and only if every ultrafilter on is Cauchy, which happens if and only if it is pre-compact (i.e. its closure in the completion of is compact). * Every relatively compact subset of a Hausdorff TVS is totally bounded. ;Topological complements * Let be a non-normable Fr√©chet space on which there exists a continuous norm.

Woodside of Belfast in 1887, and carried cargo to India and New Brunswick under the command of Captain James Arthurs. On 13 February 1889 while on a passage from Cardiff to Rosario, Argentina loaded with railway track and fishplates, she ran into a gale off Lundy Island and the captain decided to run before the wind. As the ship rolled in the tremendous seas the cargo began moving about in the hold as a solid mass and in the early hours of the 14th broke through the hull. As the ship began to sink a lifeboat was deployed under difficult conditions and all but one of the crew was saved, being picked up by the schooner Spray and carried to Swansea by the steam trawler Flying Scotchman after drifting for twelve hours.

She was wrecked on the English coast in February 1876. History Coonatto was built by Thomas Bilbe and William Perry at the Nelson Dock, Rotherhithe, South London in 1863 for Anderson, Thompson & Co., previously James Thompson & Co.Variously spelled Thompson or Thomson; by some references both in the same sentence. and later Anderson, Anderson & Co.; from 1861 trading as \\"The Orient Line of Packets\\", commonly referred to as the \\"Orient Line\\" of London.The \\"Orient Line\\" became the \\"Peninsula and Orient Steam Navigation Company\\", which eventually became the familiar \\"P.& O.\\". Their relationship with the builder began with Celestial, an all-timber ship constructed on their patented system of framing, followed by the clipper Orient, from which the line gained its name. Other ships built by Bilbe for the company were Argonaut, Borealis and Yatala, the last-named also on the Adelaide route. Coonatto was named for the once famous sheep station of Grant and Stokes. She was a vessel of 633 tons, long with a beam and designed to carry both passengers and cargo swiftly to the antipodes; the cargo on the return voyage being chiefly wool, but also copper. She was an early example of composite construction: with an iron frame and timber cladding, giving more open space for cargo. Her master for the first four voyages was Captain William Begg, previously of the Sebastian. He was a hard-driving skipper who made some very quick passages to Adelaide; her fastest time was 66 days to the Semaphore lightship and 70 from dock to dock, even after losing both her helmsman and the wheel overboard during a manoeuvre off St Paul's Island. Begg was succeeded 1869‚Äì1872 by James Norval Smart, previously master of The Murray. John Eilbeck Hillman succeeded Captain Smart.

There were no injuries, and much of the cargo was saved, but the ship broke up and was lost. The Board of Trade enquiry found Captain Hillman negligent in not sounding for depth when his position was in doubt, and his certificate was suspended for three months. These circumstances closely mirrored the loss of the Yatala under John Legoe of the same company just four years earlier. A year later Hillman was appointed master of the Inch Kenneth (1866) of 1,120 tons, which on 23 September 1877 capsized and sank in the South Atlantic, the cause being attributed to the load, bags of wheat and linseed, shifting in heavy seas. 18 of her complement of 26 perished, Hillman included; the eight who survived had been at sea for three days in the lifeboat before being picked up by the Liverpool.

History Orient was a clipper ship of 1,032 tons, built in 1853 by Thomas Bilbe at Nelson Dock, Cuckold's Point, for Anderson, Thompson and Co. (formerly James Thompson and Co).References spell his name variously as Thompson and Thomson, even in the same sentence. :Shipbroker James Thomson or Thompson in 1797 founded his fleet of sailing ships, which was carried on for several generations. James Anderson joined the company in 1897 and eventually became senior partner. His nephew, also named James Anderson, joined the company in 1828. The company was renamed Anderson, Thompson and Co. in 1854, and in 1869 became Anderson, Anderson and Co. :Orient had a registered tonnage of 1,032 tons, and was long, with a beam of and a depth of . Her hull was a composite of wood on an iron frame, and she had three masts. Beneath a poop she was fitted with cabin space, not designed into any earlier Bilbe design. She was launched in London, December, 1853, and first served as \\"troopship 78\\" in 1854, conveying military equipment and personnel of the 88th Foot to the Crimea. She was fortunate to survive a storm that wrecked some 30 ships at Balaklava with the loss of over a thousand lives. She served as a hospital ship 1855‚Äì1856. She had been built as a \\"packet\\" to carry prospectors to the Australian goldfields, but her first voyage to the antipodes was not until 1856, when she sailed under Captain A. Lawrence to Sydney; in 1857 she sailed direct from Portsmouth to Adelaide and made similar trips every year until 1877. It was at the inauguration of a liner service to Australia in 1861 that the company began trading as \\"The Orient Line of Packets\\", commonly referred to as the \\"Orient Line\\". She was nearly destroyed by fire in January 1862 during the return voyage from Adelaide. A Dutch ship was standing by to rescue those on board, and the captain and crew could have left the ship, but resolutely over the course of a day brought the fire under control, and she was able to limp into Ascension for temporary repairs. Captain Lawrence, his officers and crew were handsomely rewarded by the insurance underwriters for their efforts. Her second commander was Captain Harris, under whom she made some of her fastest passages from Plymouth to Port Adelaide, notably 72 days in 1866. Subsequent skippers were Roland De Steiger 1868‚Äì1871, W. H. Mitchell 1873‚Äì1876, and Martin Haffner 1876‚Äì1878. In 1879 she was sold to Cox Brothers of Waterford, Ireland, and made many trips for them across the Atlantic before she was sold and converted into a coal hulk off Gibraltar. She was broken up in 1925.

It was intended to be set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and acknowledge the continuity of the franchise's films and other television series. The episode was produced by ABC Signature Studios and Marvel Television, and written by Kevin Biegel. The pilot stars Milana Vayntrub as Doreen Green / Squirrel Girl and Derek Theler as Craig Hollis / Mister Immortal, who make up the New Warriors with Jeremy Tardy, Calum Worthy, Matthew Moy, and Kate Comer. The young group learn to cope with their new abilities in a terrifying world. By August 2016, Marvel Television had developed a series centered on the New Warriors and began offering it to cable networks and streaming outlets. In April 2017, New Warriors received a series order of 10 episodes from Freeform, with Biegel joining as showrunner and writing the first script. The pilot had been produced by November 2017. New Warriors was planned to premiere in 2018 on Freeform, and had the potential to launch multiple spinoff series based on each of the New Warriors characters. However, by November 2018 the network no longer had room in its schedule to begin airing the series that year, and returned it to Marvel Television so the studio could shop the series to other Disney-owned networks. These efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, and the series was officially considered dead by the end of September 2019. Premise Six superpowered young people with abilities very different from the Avengers want to make a positive impact in the world, even if they are not quite ready to be heroes. Cast and characters =Main= * Milana Vayntrub as Doreen Green / Squirrel Girl: A tough, optimistic fangirl, who is also a natural leader with acrobat skills and superhuman strength, and can move and fight like a squirrel. She has a squirrel sidekick named Tippy-Toe that she can communicate with. * Derek Theler as Craig Hollis / Mister Immortal: The New Warrior's \\"resident troublemaker and lothario\\" who claims that he cannot die, and has a cocky and grumpy personality. * Jeremy Tardy as Dwayne Taylor / Night Thrasher: A local celebrity with no superpowers, who has his own YouTube channel. Taylor's parents died when he was younger, leaving him with his family's fortune. * Calum Worthy as Robbie Baldwin / Speedball: An immature and impulsive person, who can toss kinetic balls of energy, though he lacks good aim. * Matthew Moy as Zach Smith / Microbe: A shy hypochondriac who can communicate with germs, and is looking for a group of people to hang out with. * Kate Comer as Deborah Fields / Debrii: A low-level telekinetic trickster who is a lesbian and has suffered personal loss due to the actions of other superheroes. =Guest= * Keith David as Ernest Vigman: A municipal employee. Production =Development= By the end of August 2016, Marvel Television and ABC Studios were developing a half-hour comedy series based on the New Warriors featuring Squirrel Girl, with the series being offered to cable networks and streaming outlets. In April 2017, Freeform ordered Marvel's New Warriors straight-to-series for 10 episodes, marking Marvel's first foray into single-camera live-action comedy, and their first half-hour series. Kevin Biegel was nearing a deal to write a script and serve as showrunner for the series, after Marvel had attached him to the project before Freeform's involvement. Jeph Loeb, the head of Marvel Television, and Jim Chory were set to executive produce the series alongside Biegel. Karey Burke, Executive Vice President of Programming and Development at Freeform, said the network had interest in a Squirrel Girl series before Marvel was moving forward with the project, and before Freeform ordered their other Marvel series, Marvel's Cloak & Dagger. Burke also felt Freeform was the best network for New Warriors, believing that Marvel had \\"started to see our strength with young adults\\" following the success of Cloak & Dagger, and both companies wanted to \\"find the right characters that felt like they would speak directly to Freeform's audience. The Avengers wouldn't work here but the about-to-be-Avengers works here.\\" On whether the network would consider spinoff series for each of the characters on the New Warriors team, in a similar fashion to Marvel's Netflix television series, Burke felt they \\"absolutely\\" could given the characters Marvel chose \\"are all really singular and could each carry the show that they're on. They're bound together ... for as long as we choose with this show but it's conceptually tailor-made for spinoffs.\\" Biegel was confirmed as showrunner in July 2017, and production on the pilot episode had taken place by that November. Demi Adejuyigbe was part of the series' writing team. =Casting= Casting was expected to begin \\"shortly\\" after the series was announced in April 2017. Burke noted that actresses Anna Kendrick and Shannon Purser, who had both publicly expressed interest in portraying Squirrel Girl, had been discussed for that role. She added that the network had historically \\"made a lot of stars\\", but noted that the character put them in a unique position, saying \\"The character is such a calling card. I'm interested to see if name actresses feel right for it.\\" Kendrick later admitted that she thought she had given \\"one of those answers that just goes away\\" and had no real interest in the role. By July 2017, Purser and Mae Whitman, who had also publicly expressed interest in the role, were among those that had been seriously considered for the part, with the character having been written with Whitman in mind. Discussions of Whitman were cut short due to her commitments to the series Good Girls. In early July, the series cast was announced, with Milana Vayntrub as Doreen Green / Squirrel Girl, and Derek Theler as the series' co-lead Craig Hollis / Mister Immortal. Also announced were Jeremy Tardy as Dwayne Taylor / Night Thrasher, Calum Worthy as Robbie Baldwin / Speedball, Matthew Moy as Zach Smith / Microbe, and Kate Comer as Deborah Fields / Debrii. In late July 2017, Keith David was cast in the recurring role of Ernest Vigman for the series. In June 2020, Biegel revealed he had a \\"seasons-long plan\\" for David to become the character M.O.D.O.K. =Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins= Discussing the potential for New Warriors to connect to Cloak & Dagger in April 2017, Burke said that the two properties were \\"not particularly connected\\" given \\"their tones are so wildly different\\", adding, \\"There are many degrees of separation with where they fall in the Marvel universe. But anything is possible with Marvel.\\" That July, Loeb said there were no plans to crossover the two series, nor to crossover them across networks with the similarly youth-oriented Marvel's Runaways on Hulu. He added that Marvel wanted New Warriors to find its footing before further connecting with other elements of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, saying \\"You'll see things that comment on each other; we try to touch base wherever we can... It's being aware of it and trying to find a way for it to be able to discuss in a way that makes sense.\\" Cancellation In November 2017, New Warriors was no longer set to air on Freeform. The completed pilot was said to have \\"tested through the roof\\", with high-level executives at Disney taking interest in the project. Marvel wanted the series to air in 2018, but Freeform found that it did not have room in its schedule for the series, and agreed to give the project back to Marvel; the studio would shop the series to new partners who could release the series in 2018, potentially only looking at companies that are Disney-owned, and hoping to secure a two-season pick-up from the new network. The series was still considered to be likely to produce multiple spinoffs in a similar model to Marvel's Netflix shows. Production on the remainder of New Warriors was scheduled to resume in January 2018, pending the series being picked up by a new network. Loeb stated in June 2018 that Marvel Television was still looking for a network to air the series. The studio discussed moving the series to Disney's streaming services Disney+ and Hulu, but neither broadcaster was interested in picking-up the series. By the end of September 2019, New Warriors was officially considered to be dead.

The team played in the Sheffield and District Football League and Alliance. Formed as Hemsworth Association Football Club in 1890 the club were later to become affiliated with the colliery and changed their name to Hemsworth Colliery. Foundation In April 1878 Mr J. Broughton, secretary of the Hemsworth Athletic Festival, advertised for two football clubs to play a friendly at the festival. At the town annual feast and sports event, in May 1880, a team known simply as Hemsworth played in a fixture versus a team known only as Normanton. The prizes at the festival were handed out by Mr W. H. Leatham Esq, the local Member of Parliament. The annual feast of 1881 saw Hemsworth take on Leeds Rovers and in the 1882 feast the Hemsworth team played Newmillerdam. However, it is clear this football game was played under a rugby football code. It is clear that the association football code began to gain popularity in the town by the late 1880s, regardless of the long standing of the Hemsworth football club playing a rugby code of the game. In November 1887 the secretary of a football club known as St. Helen's placed an advert in the Sheffield Daily Telegraph for association football teams to come forward to play them in friendlies. In September 1890 a Hemsworth Association Football Club appealed in the Sheffield Daily Telegraph for football clubs from neighbouring towns and villages to contact their secretary, Mr F. G. Leatham of Hemsworth Hall, to arrange games for the following season. Founder members of the Sheffield and District Alliance It appears that by 1892 an association football club known as Hemsworth were founder members of the Sheffield and District Football League and Alliance (competing in the Sheffield and District Alliance league), with opponents including Barnsley St. Peter's. This club also competed in the Barnsley Senior Cup for the first time in the 1891/92 season. It appears that by 1894 association football had gained a dedicated following in the town, with the Yorkshire Post forced to reply to a letter from a reader demanding to know where the newspaper printed association football results from the town. It is not known for certain where the Hemsworth team played but it seems logical that the team playing association football would have utilised the same pitch as the Hemsworth team playing rugby football. It would also make sense for the team to have close ties to the local colliery sports facilities and in 1896 the Fitzwilliam Hemsworth Colliery Company advertised an athletic festival to be held at their Kinsley Recreation Ground. The colliery clearly placed some importance in the promotion of sports locally, as proven by their use of Fattorini and Sons of Bradford (makers of the FA Cup trophy) to supply prizes for their athletic festival. At the turn of the century the club was competing in the Sheffield Association League, as well as in a number of Barnsley Association cup and league competitions including the Minor Cup and the Beckett Hospital Cup. The standing of the club had sufficiently raised that by the 1902-03 season they were competing in the FA Cup. A turbulent end In February 1903 fans of the club brought the wrath of the Sheffield and Hallamshire Football Association, due to their \\"misconduct\\". The 1902-03 season was a disaster for the club, as they finished bottom of the Sheffield Association League and subsequently left the competition at the end of the season. The club carried on for two more seasons in the Barnsley Association Minor Cup League Division One but seemingly disappeared from existence at the end of the end of the 1904-05 season. The odd thing regarding the disappearance of the club is the coincidence of the timing of the formation of the Hemsworth and District Football League and its associated cup competitions, which the club did not enter. One probable major contributor to the downfall of the football club at this point is the part of the Kinsley Evictions. Fitzwilliam Hemsworth Colliery Company owned many of the houses in Hemsworth and outlying villages such as Kinsley and disputes between the colliery company and its workforce were common. The Kinsley Evictions saw many families who found themselves in dispute with the colliery company and living in houses owned by them evicted and homeless. Few can blame the men working at the colliery for turning their back on the colliery football team when the disputes had reached such an incredibly bitter conclusion. Rebirths As early as 1913 a colliery sports club known as the Hemsworth Collieries Athletic Club was in existence, though primarily focussed on athletics, cycling, cricket, billiards and bowls. The club was based at Fitzwilliam Cricket Ground and it seems that no football results or league memberships for this club are known, yet in 1919 Joe Marsh, of this club, was given a trial by Hull City. Marsh, an inside forward from South Kirkby, signed for Hull in December. By the 1920s Hemsworth West End had risen to prominence as the senior football club in the town, reaching the FA Cup fourth qualifying round in the 1925/26 season. Yet in 1926, whilst the West End club were at their peak, a new colliery club was established. Hemsworth Main Colliery Club were formed in the 1925/26 season and in January 1926 the club agreed to step into the position of Harwood Main, who had withdrawn from the Doncaster Senior League. In 1981, following the folding of the then existing colliery club in 1980, a new club known as Hemsworth Miners Welfare were formed. Football ground The Kinsley Recreation Ground was described in 1894 as being \\"a very fair one\\" and included an athletics running track which was four miles to lap.

He is best known for producing several notable Nigerian television soap operas, including the successful Tinsel, which was the first multi-camera studio based television daily soap to be produced by a Nigerian producer in all of East, West or North Africa and more recently Hush.  Early life  Ofime was born in Lagos, Nigeria. In May 1985 he graduated from St. Paul's Primary School in Lagos, Nigeria and then went on to Iponri Grammar School in Lagos in June 1991 for his secondary school education. After his secondary education, in May 1994 he obtained a Certificate in Drama from the Obafemi Awolowo University in Osun State, southwest Nigeria and another Certificate in Music from the same university in May 1996. In July 2000 Ofime graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (2nd Class Lower) BA Dramatic Arts from the Obafemi Awolowo University, Osun state, Nigeria. In October 2004 he obtained a Masters of Arts (PhD Grade) MA Theatre Arts from the University of Ibadan, Oyo state, Nigeria. In 2016, he graduated from Robertson College in Canada with a certificate in Business Administration. He then enrolled for a PHD at the Lagos State University, Lagos State, Nigeria. Growing up, Ofime looked up to mentors such as Erika Klopper, Desiree Markgraaf, Tade Ogidan, Richard Mofe Damijo, and would grow to become a fan of Steven Spielberg and Tyler Perry. He had his first opportunity given to him by Tade Ogidan, a foremost Nigerian director. But the opportunity that led to his breakthrough in the television and film industry was given to him by Erika Klopper. According to Ofime, \\"She believed in me when everyone doubted my ability to deliver a studio based multi-cam daily series.\\"  Career  In 2001, Ofime began producing movies, television series and commercials as a television production manager in Lagos, Nigeria and by 2005, Ofime took a job with South Africa-based Film Company, Sky Sweeper Films. In his time there, Ofime produced his first set of television commercial projects, which enjoyed notable success. In 2007, Ofime was head hunted by top South African media company M-net and was commissioned to produce a daily soap opera Tinsel on the M-net/Africa Magic platform. While working on Tinsel, he worked with a 120-member film crew, 15 recurring actors and 500 supporting actors. The show went on to become one of the most viewed television series in Africa, viewed by millions and syndicated across 48 African countries on satellite and local television stations. It also made him the first Nigerian producer to produce a multi-camera, studio-based daily television soap opera in West, North and East Africa. In 2013, Ofime was mandated by M-net to develop a Tele-film initiative by putting together a team of 120 film-makers to produce at least 80 tele-films in 2013, 60 films in 2014 and 40 in 2015. The movie project initiative, which was successful is called the Africa Magic Original Films (AMOF) project. Ofime relocated to Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada and set up his own production company, Theatron Media Incorporated and has worked alongside several notable film producers and directors including Tade Ogidan, Erika Klopper, Juliette Hagopian, Robert Peters, Curtis Graham, Steve Morrisson and Titus Orpen.  Personal life  Ofime is married to Olabimpe Ofime. They met in the university, and have been married since 2002. They have two children.  Awards and recognition  At the 2017 Africa Magic Viewers Choice Award (AMVCA), a movie he produced, Oloibiri, was named Best Movie West Africa.

History Naruto stable was established on 1 April 2017 by the Bulgarian-born former ≈çzeki Koto≈çsh≈´ Katsunori, who branched out from Sadogatake stable. It is based in Sumida, Tokyo. One of the stable's early recruits was also a Bulgarian ‚Äì former junior wrestling champion Ventsislav Katsarov (Torakio Daiki) who retired in April 2019 and returned to Bulgaria. The opening ceremony of the stable was attended by one hundred people including Koto≈çsh≈´'s former stablemate Kotosh≈çgiku. Koto≈çsh≈´ commented, \\"I want to nurture a wrestler who will eclipse me.\\" As of April 2020 it has 14 wrestlers. Koto≈çsh≈´ became a naturalized Japanese citizen two months after his retirement in March 2014. His official name is And≈ç Karoyan. He is the first European-born stablemaster. He is also only the third foreign-born wrestler to open his own stable after Takamiyama and Musashimaru.Tomozuna Oyakata (the Mongolian born Kyokutenho) is also a stablemaster, but inherited an existing stable rather than building a new one. According to a report in May 2018, some wrestlers said that they chose Naruto stable because they had the most information when they searched the internet.„Éç„ÉÉ„ÉàÊÉÖÂ†±Áô∫‰ø°Èáè„ÅåÂ§ö„ÅÑ„Åã„Çâ„ÄåÈ≥¥Êà∏ÈÉ®Â±ã„Äç Êó•Âàä„Çπ„Éù„Éº„ÉÑ 2018Âπ¥5Êúà22Êó•10ÊôÇ0ÂàÜÔºàÊó•Âàä„Çπ„Éù„Éº„ÉÑÊñ∞ËÅûÁ§æ„ÄÅ2019Âπ¥2Êúà18Êó•Èñ≤Ë¶ßÔºâ Naruto stable is not related to Tagonoura stable which had the same name until 2013.

This is the first time the Compliance Committee and the Anti-Violence Provisions, which were established in December 2018, were applied. On February 19, 2019, an apology statement was posted on the official Twitter of Naruto stable \\"To all of you who always support us.

Flying Pages Europe SARL, 2015. The company was founded in about 2013 and seems to have gone out of business in 2016. History Kenneth Garland holds the rights to the Sadler Vampire SV-2 design and had also acquired many of the drawings, tooling and parts for the design through his company Aero.V.Australia. Aero.V.Australia was an aircraft maintenance and repair company, that seems to have been formed in 2006 and gone out of business in 2013. Garland Aerospace was formed to develop the 1980s vintage Sadler Vampire design into the Garland Vampire. Three versions were produced, the GA-1 for the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles category, the GA-2 an updated version for the homebuilt market and the GA-3 with more power and a higher gross weight. Garland Aerospace was also engaged in developing a whole range of new aircraft designs. These included the GA-5 Warlang, a UAV version of the Vampire; the GA-6 Torana, a two seat design based on the Goair Trainer; the GA-7 Winjeel, a two-seat aircraft with conventional landing gear; the GA-8 Woomera, a new Vampire-based design for the US ultralight category, to be powered by a Compact Radial Engines MZ202 two stroke engine and the GA-9 Starship, a new design based on the Vampire with a Rotax 914 turbocharged powerplant and retractable landing gear. There is no evidence that any of these aircraft were ever taken beyond the concept stage. The company also provided aircraft construction technique classes to prospective aircraft builders in subjects including sheet metal, woodworking, aircraft fabric covering, welding, fibreglass construction and aircraft painting and finishing.

Biography After taking a degree at Lisbon Theatre and Film School she took on another degree course in Painting at Lisbon Fine Arts School where she graduated in 1991. In 2005 she received a M. Phil in Aesthetics and Philosophy of Art with a dissertation on Cinema, Archive and Memory that accompanied the making of her first long feature essay documentary film Natureza Morta (Still Life). In 2014 she received a PhD in Fine-Arts Video from the University of Lisbon, with a thesis on Archive footage and Decelerated Movement, a theoretical work that accompanied the making her second long feature essay documentary 48. She is co-founder of the film production company Kintop. From 2010-2012 she was a member of the board of the Portuguese Documentary Association APORDOC and in 2012 she formed a women collective who directed for two consecutive years the Lisbon International Documentary Festival Doclisboa. She engaged particularly in the creation of new sections of the festival such as \\"Cinema of Urgency\\" and \\"Passages\\" (Documentary and Contemporary Art). One of most notorious aspects of her work is the artistic integration of archival footage dating from the Portuguese dictatorship (1926-1974). Filmography and awards A turning point in Susana de Sousa Dias' cinematographic work war her contact with the material gathered in archives of the Portuguese political police (Arquivo Pide/DGS) while preparing her documentary Processo-Crime 141-53 (Criminal-Case 141-53). The film was, at the same time, the starting point for questioning the role and the usage of archival footage in documentaries and history writing. The first film she made that can be considered as a direct reflection of the experience was Natureza Morta /Still Life (2005, 72\\", b/w), a Portuguese French co- production, only consisting of archive footage and sound, that deliberately renounced on the usage of spoken discourse. The film was awarded with the Merit Award at Taiwan Documentary Film Festival in 2006 and the Atalanta Films Award at Doclisboa 2006. 48 (2010) is her best known feature. On the film, Scott MacDonald writes: \\"Nearly all the images in De Sousa Dias‚Äôs remarkable third feature, 48, are extended close-ups of the mugshots of political prisoners during which we hear the political prisoners‚Äô memories of the humiliations they endured. The visual challenge in 48 was how make a moving film from still photographs.\\" Scott MacDonald, \\"Susana De Sousa Dias\\" in Avant-Doc: Intersections of Documentary and Avant-Garde Cinema, NY, Oxford University Press, 2015.

Despite its relative youth and a 15-year hiatus from 2000‚Äì2014, the rivalry remains one of the fiercest and most competitive in the state of Alabama.  History  = Formation and early games = Auburn and UAB first played in 1982, just four seasons after the creation of the UAB men's basketball program. The matchup originated as a supplementary event at the Birmingham‚ÄìJefferson Civic Center (BJCC) for Auburn fans in Birmingham on the night before the Iron Bowl football game was played at Legion Field. However, UAB's quick rise to national prominence led to the Auburn‚ÄìUAB game gaining significance in its own right. Three of those first five games in the BJCC saw one of the two teams come in ranked in the top 25, and the 1984 game remains the third-largest home crowd in UAB basketball history. Following a one-year break, Auburn and UAB played each other for 12 consecutive seasons. UAB was dominant during this period, winning eight out of ten games from 1989‚Äì1997. The 1997 and 1998 editions of the rivalry were played in the Holiday Hardwood Classic at the BJCC as part of a doubleheader with Alabama. =Hiatus= Following their 1999 matchup, Auburn head coach Cliff Ellis wanted the series to be played at Auburn until the number of games played in Auburn was equal to those played in Birmingham. UAB athletic director Gene Bartow and UAB head coach Murry Bartow refused to play the game exclusively in Auburn, so the series came to a halt. Despite pleas from both the media and the fans to continue the rivalry, no games were scheduled between the two programs for 15 seasons. = Rivalry renewal = In May 2015, following UAB's NCAA Tournament upset over 3-seed Iowa State and Bruce Pearl's first season at Auburn, UAB announced that they had reached an agreement to play Auburn in a four-game series. The first game would be played at Auburn, the second at UAB, then back at Auburn, then finally at Legacy Arena. (formerly the BJCC) Auburn won the first game of the series renewal in front of a sold out Auburn Arena, 75‚Äì74, on a 3-pointer in the final seconds of the game. In 2016, Auburn defeated UAB in the first game played at Bartow Arena in the series since 1996, 74‚Äì70.

On August 27, 2016, the Boeing 737-7H4, with 99 passengers and five crew, 12 minutes after departure from New Orleans, was climbing through 31,000 feet and heading east over the Gulf of Mexico when the aircraft's number one CFM International CFM56-7 engine suffered an uncontained engine failure. Debris from the engine punctured the left side of the fuselage causing a loss of cabin pressure and damaged the wing and empennage. Oxygen masks were deployed to passengers while the crew initiated an emergency descent to 10,000 feet. The aircraft then diverted to Pensacola International Airport for a safe landing about 20 minutes later without further incident. While the aircraft sustained substantial damage, there were no injuries.  Aircraft  The aircraft involved was a 16-year-old Boeing 737-7H4 (registration number N766SW), delivered to Southwest in May 2000. The jet was subsequently returned to service and later retired by Southwest in November 2019 to Greenwood‚ÄìLeflore Airport, Mississippi.  Investigation  The accident was investigated by the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). On September 12, 2016, the NTSB reported their initial findings. Initial findings from the examination of the airplane include: * The left engine inlet separated from the engine during the flight. Debris from the engine inlet damaged the airplane fuselage, wing and empennage. * A 5-inch by 16-inch hole was found in the left fuselage just above the left wing. * No fan blade or inlet material was found in the hole and the passenger interior compartment was not penetrated. * During the accident sequence, the airplane experienced a cabin de-pressurization. * The aircraft maintenance records are being reviewed. Initial findings from the engine examination include: * One fan blade separated from the fan disk during the accident flight. * The root of the separated fan blade remained in the fan hub; however, the remainder of the blade was not recovered. Initial findings from the metallurgical examination conducted in the NTSB Materials Laboratory include: * The fracture surface of the missing blade showed curving crack arrest lines consistent with fatigue crack growth. The fatigue crack region was 29 mm (1.14‚Ä≥) long and 5.5 mm (0.217‚Ä≥) deep. * The center of the fatigue origin area was about 53 mm (2.1‚Ä≥) aft of the forward face of the blade root. No surface or material anomalies were noted during an examination of the fatigue crack origin using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. * The blades are manufactured of a titanium alloy and the root contact face is coated with a copper-nickel-indium alloy. Future investigative work by the NTSB will include 3-D measurements of the contact areas of all the blades, a non-destructive examination of the blade surfaces for cracks, and a review of the engine maintenance records. Parties to the investigation include the Federal Aviation Administration, Southwest Airlines, the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, and CFM International, which is a joint venture between GE Aviation (US) and Safran Aircraft Engines (France). The French Bureau of Investigation and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety has also appointed an accredited representative who is supported by a technical advisor from Safran Aircraft Engines. On March 30, 2020, the NTSB determined the probable cause of the accident as follows: \\"A low-cycle fatigue crack in the dovetail of fan blade No. 23, which resulted in the fan blade separating in flight and impacting the fan case. This impact caused the fan blade to fracture into fragments that traveled farther than expected into the inlet, which compromised the structural integrity of the inlet and led to the in-flight separation of inlet components. A portion of the inlet struck the fuselage and created a hole, causing the cabin to depressurize.\\"  See also  * Southwest Airlines Flight 1380, a 2018 accident involving the same airline with an engine failure with a similar aircraft and engine causing one fatality.

It was built about 1890 for the locally prominent Allyn family; its architect is unknown. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The apartment building at 49-51 Spring Street is one of two residential apartment blocks standing on the west side of Spring Street between Garden and Myrtle Streets. The setting is now one of urban renewal, the buildings surrounded by parking lots on three sides, and Interstate 84 passing not far to the east, separating the buildings from Downtown Hartford. This building is three stories in height, built out of brick with brownstone trim. It is five bays wide, with the entrance at the center, recessed under a Syrian arch. The outer bays and center bay are topped visually by large round-arch panels, with polygonal bay windows on the first and second floors of the outer bays, and on the second floor above the entrance in the center. The building's cornice has brick corbelling, with built-out bracket-like brickwork articulating the arched panels. The building was constructed about 1890, on land belonging to Robert Allyn, a local real estate developer whose own house stood on the same lot to the north. Of the two six-unit apartment blocks built by Allyn (the other is at 39-41 Spring Street, built about five years earlier), it is the more architecturally interesting, probably drawing inspiration from the 1875‚Äì76 Cheney Building in Downtown Hartford, which is an H.H.

It operates as a specialized second-line service. It is not a first response service like the fire departments, but is only called upon when specialized assistance is needed. Its main tasks revolve around CBRN incidents, search and rescue operations and heavy technical assistance. Some Civil Protection units however also partake in the regular emergency response in their area, for example for firefighting or emergency medical assistance. The minister of the Interior can also order agents of the Civil Protection to partake in foreign missions of B-FAST, the Belgian foreign emergency relief team. The Civil Protection consists of a central direction in Brussels and six operational units spread across the Belgian territory. Each operational unit is responsible for the interventions in their area. Some operational units are specialized in certain areas, mostly dependent on their location (for example underground search and rescue). As of 2016, the Belgian Civil Protection employs about 1,100 people, of which 450 professionals and 650 volunteers, and operates almost 670 vehicles. In 2016, it also undertook about 5,500 interventions. In April 2017, minister of the Interior Jan Jambon announced the closure of four of the six operational units of the Civil Protection. The goal was to reform the Civil Protection to be a purely second line service, and to transfer any first response tasks to the local fire departments. The plans drew criticism from unions and local municipalities, who feared increased response times during disasters. There was also concern about the location of one of the two remaining units, which would lie in the exclusion zone in case of a nuclear accident in the Doel nuclear power plant.

Geography and geomorphology  The volcanic field lies in the Quiangtang plateau, in northern Tibet and the Kunlun mountains. The high altitude, bad terrain and weather make geologic investigations in the region difficult. The volcanic field partly covers the Kangtuo formation. = Local = The Bamaoqiongzong (), Yongbohu and Qiangbaqian () fields featured Hawaiian eruptions that have formed lava flows. Later erosion has reduced these to flat topped conical hills and table mountains. Other volcanic centres are the cones of Heiguotou (), Kushuihuan-Beishan () and Yuyiehu (). In addition, the Kekexili () caldera is considered part of the field. This caldera has a diameter of . A volcano named \\"Debussey\\" is supposedly also located there. Bamaoqiongzong covers a surface area of . It forms a peak with column-jointed rocks at its top. Two craters lie on this peak, one wide and deep on the northeastern side with a breach southeast and another less well preserved one on the southeastern side. It is surrounded by lava domes and lava sheets. Originally likely over thick, now they reach only several . Yongbohu features five vents, the principal one has a height of . One has the shape of a dragon and another one is conical. Quiangbaqian covers a surface of and features lava tube and fissure fed lava flows as well as one volcano. These volcanics are also known as Yulinshan formation. Sometimes, the chronologically, petrologically and geographically distinct Hoh Xil volcanics are grouped with these fields. = Composition = Bamaoqiongzong, Yongbohu and Qiangbaqian have erupted vitrophyric rocks. Minerals encountered in the vulcanites include andesite, trachyandesite and dacite containing augite, and are subalkaline. Bamaoqiongzong is potassic, it also contains phonolite and its minerals include aegyrite, alkali feldspar, analcite, foidite, leucite, noselite and titanaugite. This differences may be caused by the position of the centres with respect to the north Tibet block; the last two centres are located on its margin and the first one inside the block.  Eruptive history  The Bamaoqiongzong, Yongbohu and Qiangbaqian volcanoes appear to be of Quaternary age, seeing as their deposits lie above Pliocene-Pleistocene rocks. Lava flows from Bamaoqiongzong lie on Quaternary lake deposits. Argon-argon dating has yielded ages of 30-26, 18 and 15-14 million years ago for the fields respectively however. Potassium-argon dating of Bamaoqiongzong has yielded ages ranging from 20 to 28.6 million years ago. There is no evidence for Holocene eruptions.

The mangroves provide an important habitat for migrating birds that winter in the area. Large areas are intact, although they are threatened by destruction of the trees for timber and to make way for agriculture, and from upstream agricultural and industrial pollution. Location The Guianan mangroves ecoregion extends along the Atlantic coasts of southeastern Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana. It covers an area of about between the deltas of the Orinoco and Oyapock rivers. It includes the Gulf of Paria and the delta of the San Juan River. The largest part is in Venezuela in and around the Orinoco delta. The mangroves lie between the sea and areas of Orinoco Delta swamp forests, Guianan moist forests and Guianan freshwater swamp forests. The Guianan mangroves ecoregion is part of the Guianan-Amazon Mangroves global ecoregion, which also contains the Amapa mangroves, Par√° mangroves and Maranh√£o mangroves ecoregions. Physical Elevations in the flat, narrow strip of coastal land covered by the mangroves range from sea level to about above sea level. Sand and shell ridges and elevated mud flats are formed by accumulated sediments, carried steadily westward from the mouth of the Amazon by strong ocean currents. The mud flats evolve into clay flats occupied by some species of mangrove. The coastlines suffer periodically from extensive erosion after large number of mangroves die at the same time. Other habitats are brackish or salt lagoons, brackish herbaceous swamps, swamp woods and swamp forests. The swamps are a source of fresh water to the mangroves. The alluvial plains in the northwest have different characteristics. The San Juan delta has swamps with marine- fluvial sediment deposits, the Gulf of Paria has marine sediments and the Orinoco delta has mainly fluvial sediments. The tides are no more than in the Orinoco delta. The Oronoco river has an average flow of per second, and deposits 200,000 tons of sediment each year, resulting in a very unstable landscape. Climate There are considerable differences in climate along the length of the ecoregion. Annual rainfall varies from in Venezuela to the east of the Gulf of Paria to in parts of Suriname. Some areas have a four-month dry season while others have none. In the Orinoco Delta the mean monthly temperature ranges from . Flora The composition of the mangrove forests depend on the soil and the salinity of the water. Mixed stands of Rhizophora and Avicennia species are found in areas of higher salinity, particularly in the extreme northwest. Rhizophora and Laguncularia species grow in channels with more fresh water, and Rhizophora, Avicennia and Laguncularia grow where the soil contains more organic matter. The higher zones hold forests dominated by Avicennia species while herbaceous vegetation grows in the more saline swamps. There are diverse habitats in the Orinoco delta. The most saline parts have formations of Rhizophora mangle, Rhizophora harrisonii and Rhizophora racemosa. In less saline areas further inland Rhizophora species and the palm Mauritia flexuosa grow together in peat bogs. In other parts of the delta the Rhizophora species mingle with swamp forest species such as Pterocarpus officinalis, Symphonia globulifera, a√ßa√≠ palm (Euterpe oleracea) and Roystonea species. There are wide belts of Rhizophora in the inner estuary, with Avicennia on higher ground, sometimes mixed with Pterocarpus officinalis, Symphonia globulifera and Vitex species. Beach in Kourou, French Guiana, where it starts to turn into a mangrove Along the coast from eastern Venezuela to the Guyanas the mangroves form belts a few meters wide associated with deciduous forests, muddy meadows and muddy forests in flooded areas. Dominant species include Costus arabicus, Cyperus giganteus, Eichhornia crassipes, Heliconia psittacorum, Roystonea regia and Mauritia flexuosa. Muddy forests on ground that is almost always flooded have a single dense stratum of trees with heights from such as Pterocarpus officinalis, Symphonia globulifera, Tabebuia aquatilis, a√ßa√≠ palm (Euterpe oleracea), Manicaria species and Mauritia flexuosa. The mangrove belts hold Laguncularia racemosa on the seaward side, mixed with Spartina species of salt marsh grass, in front of stands of Avicennia germinans. Fauna scarlet ibis (Eudocimus ruber) The ecoregion has diverse fauna. It is the largest area in South America where migrating shorebirds from the Nearctic realm spend the winter, with up to 5 million birds visiting in one year. Over 118 species of birds have been recorded in Suriname and Venezuela, of which more than 70 are waterbirds. Bird species include scarlet ibis (Eudocimus ruber), black skimmer (Rynchops niger), gull- billed tern (Gelochelidon nilotica), short-billed dowitcher (Limnodromus griseus), lesser yellowlegs (Tringa flavipes), greater yellowlegs (Tringa melanoleuca), black-bellied whistling duck (Dendrocygna autumnalis) and tricolored heron (Egretta tricolor). More than 50 species of mammals have been recorded, including opossums, bats, tufted capuchin (Sapajus apella), common squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus), Venezuelan red howler (Alouatta seniculus), white-faced saki (Pithecia pithecia), giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), jaguar (Panthera onca), cougar (Puma concolor), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) and capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris). The paradoxal frog (Pseudis paradoxa) and the common Suriname toad (Pipa pipa) have adapted to the saline conditions. Reptiles include olive ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea), which nests on the beaches, green iguana (Iguana iguana), spectacled caiman (Caiman crocodilus) and green anaconda (Eunectes murinus). Status The World Wildlife Fund gives the ecoregion the status of \\"Relatively Stable/Intact\\". There are many protected areas, and large sections of mangroves are intact. Suriname has at least seven protected areas, most with a degree of connectivity, including the Coppename Monding wetland and the Wia-Wia nature reserve. Venezuela has the Mariusa National Park and the Orinoco Delta Biosphere Reserve. The Guarapiche Forest Reserve in the San Juan delta holds a patch of mangroves, palms and swamp forests. Agriculture such as rice cultivation has caused some fragmentation, but most fragmentation is natural. The main threats come from logging to obtain building material, fuel, tannin and medicinal products. Upstream agriculture releases fertilizers and pesticides, and adds sediments due to erosion.

El Surar is the southernmost cork oak forest in Valencia. It consists of a series of open copses that are the remains of more extensive, older forests. Unlike the cork forests located further to the north of the Valencian Community, it has the singularity of inhabiting soils evolved from calcareous subsoils. Cork oak forests usually occur in siliceous soils,Soil Properties Constraining Cork Oak Distribution, Isabel Serrasolses, Marian P√©rez-Devesa, Alberto Vilagrosa, Juli G. Pausas, Teresa Sauras, Jordi Cortina, and V. Ramon Vallejo and as such its presence in El Surar is explained by the intense rainfall recorded in the area, which washes away the soil and results in high levels of decarbonisation and acidification. El Surar was declared Municipal Natural Park by Generalitat Valenciana on March 4, 2005. The Municipal Natural Park of Parpall√≥-BorrellPNM Parpall√≥ - Borrell, Gandia (in Spanish) is to be found in the adjacent municipality of Barx. Etymology The name \\"El Surar\\" is derived from the Valencian term suro, meaning ‚Äúcork‚Äù.\\"Suro\\" Catalan - English Climate The area enjoys a typically Mediterranean climate, characterised by hot summers and relatively cold winters, with an average of two snowfalls per year. Precipitation averages from 500 to 800 mm Geography The park, which occupies an area of some 837.81 hectares,El Surar is located at the head of a series of gullies that flow into the River Piner in the area of Sierra de Marchuquera, within the municipalities of Pinet and Llutxent. At an altitude of around 600 meters above sea level, it provides panoramic views of the surrounding mountains, deep ravines and the coast at nearby towns of Gandia and Xeraco. Flora and fauna Typical underbrush in El Surar The area is host to two flora micro-reserves, called \\"Pla de Junquera\\" and \\"Els Miradors\\". The flora found in El Surar is somewhat different to that found in other Valencian cork oak forests: there is an absence of silicic species, such as tree heath, whilst others more commonly found in holm oak forests are present: daphne, kermes oak, rosemary, etc. The forest is also host to a wide range of Mediterranean shrubland fauna, including wild boar and rabbit, as well as golden eagle, falcon, owl, hare, common quail, partridge and lizard, among other speciesEuroresidents - Paraje Natural Protegido de Surar-Pinet (in Spanish)  Route of the Monasteries of Valencia  Signpost indicating Route of the Monasteries of Valencia in El Surar El Surar lies on a variant of the Route of the Monasteries of Valencia (GR-236), a monumental and cultural route that connects five monasteries located in the south of the Province of Valencia.

Founded in 1882, in 1928 the exchange purchased and began using the name San Francisco Stock Exchange, while the old San Francisco Stock Exchange was renamed the San Francisco Mining Exchange. The San Francisco Curb Exchange was absorbed by the San Francisco Stock Exchange in 1938. In 1956 the San Francisco Stock Exchange merged with the Los Angeles Oil Exchange to create the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange. History =Formation= The San Francisco Stock and Bond Exchange was founded in 1882 on September 18, in a basement in San Francisco. The exchange was founded as the San Francisco Stock Exchange. On September 18, twenty-five brokers met in the basement of Wohl & Rollitz, which was at 403 California Street in the old Fireman's Fund Insurance Building. Of that number, 19 signed the charter and deposited $50 to purchase memberships. The first president was John Perry Jr. It had nineteen charter members, who called it \\"the Local Security Board.\\" The first year of business, transactions totaled $9,490,621. After the World War I stock market shutdown that started in July 1914, the San Francisco Stock and Bond Exchange reopened on December 1, 1914 for trading for bonds under restrictions, three days after the NYSE reopened. =Negotiations with SF Stock Exchange= By April 23, 1927, the San Francisco Stock and Bond Exchanges and the San Francisco Stock Exchange, mining, were negotiating over the establishment of the former as purely listed market, and the latter as a curb exchange. To prevent naming confusion, there were talks to have the SF Stock Exchange be named the San Francisco Curb Exchange or Association, with the name 'San Francisco Stock Exchange' to become the property of the Stock and Bond Exchange. Upon the ratification of the agreement, there would be ninety days for corporations with stocks \\"on the unlisted board [of the San Francisco Stock and Bond Exchange] to meet listing requirements or to be transferred to the Curb board, where \\"another probationary period will ensue in which Curb requirements may be met.\\" It was said these curb requirements would be \\"substantially\\" those of the New York Curb. =1927-1928: Restructuring= In August 1927, the exchange adopted new regulations for its listed securities. The following month, the San Francisco exchange broke a business record for itself, when it had weekly trading total $16,936,019. In December 1927, the exchange's monthly business surpassed $100 million for the first time. Also that month, the exchange voted for reorganization and division of business in the exchange, with the exchange expanding. On December 9, 1927, it was reported that the agreement to re- organize with the San Francisco Stock Exchange had been authorized, with changes to take place immediately. Also, the old building occupied by the San Francisco Stock Exchange was put for sale, with the exchange to be renamed the San Francisco Mining Exchange. In the agreement, the San Francisco Mining Exchange agreed to deal solely in mining securities, with the name San Francisco Stock Exchange sold to the Stock and Bond Exchange. The new San Francisco Curb Exchange was expected to begin operation soon after the start of 1928, and would be the third security markets in the city. According to the agreement, all members of the SF Stock and Bond Exchange would hold memberships in both the new Stock Exchange and the new curb exchange. The Curb would have an authorized 100 charter members, 67 from the Stock and Bond Exchange, and the remaining available for sale. The new Curb Exchange was created to take over the \\"splendid plant on Bush Street of the old Mining Exchange.\\" The Curb Exchange started activities on January 2, 1928, using the unlisted securities formerly on the SF Stock and Bond Exchange. =As Pacific Coast division= As of late 1928, Sidney L. Schwartz was president of the San Francisco Stock Exchange, which was the renamed San Francisco Stock and Bond Exchange. The San Francisco Curb Exchange was absorbed by the San Francisco Stock Exchange in 1938. In 1957, the Los Angeles Oil Exchange (formed in 1899) and the San Francisco Stock and Bond Exchange merged to create the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange, with trading floors maintained in both cities. As of September 15, 1957, the former San Francisco Stock and Bond Exchange was operational as the San Francisco division of the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange.

Ashley is a postmodernist scholar of International relations. He is an associate professor at the Arizona State University's School of Politics and Global Studies. Ashley studied at the University of California, Santa Barbara and at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He was research assistant to Hayward Alker. Initially, Ashley's research was on the balance of power in international relations, particularly in his The Political Economy of War and Peace (1980). He soon began to shift his approach to metatheoretical questions and Critical Theory. By the mid-1980s, Ashley had adopted a postmodernist and subversive approach to international relations theory, exemplified by his influences: Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak. Ashley was one of the first to challenge the position of mainstream realism and liberalism. In \\"The Poverty of Neorealism\\" (1984), he coined the term \\"neorealism\\" to describe the work of Kenneth Waltz. Early life Ashley received his Bachelor of Arts degree from University of California, Santa Barbara in 1970, after which he entered graduate school in Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) studying political science. He received his Doctorate of Philosophy from MIT in 1977, with a dissertation titled Growth, Rivalry, and Balance: The Sino-Soviet-American Triangle of Conflict (1976), supervised by Nazli Choucri. Career Ashley studied under Hayward Alker and served as his research assistant. This relationship influenced Ashley's approach to international relations. Other influences include Jacques Derrida, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Foucauldian discourse analysis, and J√ºrgen Habermas. For some time in the 1970s, Ashley was assistant professor of international relations at the University of Southern California. Early in his career, with The Political Economy of War and Peace (1980), Ashley focused on conventional analysis of balance of power. He soon began to focus on metatheoretical issues instead. Before turning to postmodernist international relations, Ashley's early work moved to the direction of Critical Theory. He became the first scholar to introduce the thought of Habermas to international relations. All Ashley's major writings from this phase of the first half of the 1980s can be characterized as a critique of technical rationality in the study of international relations and advocacy of emancipatory ways of knowing. This approach is evident in his debates concerning Habermas with John H. Herz. Since the mid 1980s, his critique has become a self-confessed subversive dissidence of the discipline. Ashley has since distanced himself from his early work, considering it too ideological in its epistemology. Ashley become one of the first to challenge the predominance of mainstream realism and liberalism in the 1980s. Ashley retired in 2018. Prior he taught at Arizona State University's Department of Political Science (now School of Politics and Global Studies) since 1981, as an associate professor. Some of Ashley's influential work includes \\"The Poverty of Neorealism\\" (1984) where he coined the term \\"neorealism\\" to describe the work of Kenneth Waltz and others. Indeed, Ashley's critique of microeconomic analogies employed by neorealists made him a key figure in the inter-paradigm debate in international relations theory. \\"Untying the Sovereign State: A Double Reading of the Anarchy Problematique\\" (1988) is a Derridan double reading of the concept of international anarchy in traditional international relations literature. \\"Living on Border Lines: Man, Poststructuralism, and War\\" (1989) is influential, too. In 1989, he contributed to the seminal volume International/Intertextual Relations edited by fellow postmodernists James Der Derian and Michael J. Shapiro. In addition, Ashley has contributed many academic articles to journals such as International Organization, Millennium, Alternatives, and International Studies Quarterly. Ashley is an editor of International Studies Quarterly. According to Darryl S. L. Jarvis, \\"the undiminished allure of postmodernism is plainly attributable to ... Richard Ashley, and to a lesser extent, Walker\\", with whom Ashley has also written. He received the Karl Deutsch Award of the International Studies Association in 1985. Works    * =With R. B. J.

The bill would give a tax credit to organizations that create new antibiotics and \\"rapid diagnostic tests\\" that treat serious or life-threatening infections. According to Politico, \\"To encourage research and development, the bill would provide a new 50 percent tax credit for the clinical testing expenses of new antibiotics that treat serious or life-threatening infections and rapid infectious disease diagnostic tests.\\" According to the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the legislation's tax credit is modeled after the credit offered under the Orphan Drug Act for treatments of rare diseases. Paulsen is co-chair of the Congressional Medical Technology Caucus.  Background  Reports published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports have shown that approximately two million people in the United States suffered from antibiotic-resistant bacteria every year. Around 23,000 people die from it each year in the U.S. According to Paulsen, more people are getting infections that existing drugs cannot treat. As a result, patients often stay in the hospital for a long time and need expensive treatments.  Legislative history  H.R. 1840 was introduced on March, 30, 2017 and referred to the House Ways and Means Committee. It is possible that Paulsen and Thompson could try to attach the legislation to the FDA's user fee reauthorization bill, or to a larger tax reform bill.  Support and opposition  The Infectious Disease Society of America and the chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at San Francisco General Hospital support the bill.

Its only product was the patented pointe shoe that Eliza, a devoted amateur dancer, had designed and developed over the preceding eight years ‚Äî the first pointe shoe to successfully utilize modern materials in its construction. In 1993, Gaynor Minden opened a boutique in the parlor of a nineteenth century brownstone in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, where customers are fitted for pointe shoes by a staff of specially trained dancers and former dancers. Gaynor Minden also sold shoes by mail order using detailed questionnaires and foot tracings and established a wholesale business serving specialty dance wear stores. In 1996 John Minden secured the domain dancer.com, making Gaynor Minden the first pointe shoe available on the internet. The original line of pointe shoes grew widely, and now includes an extensive range of size, shape, stiffness, and satin options for stock shoes. Further customizations are available by special order. All pointe shoes are handmade in Lawrence, Massachusetts. Distribution extends to over 80 countries and to over 200 major ballet companies.  Products  Gaynor Minden specializes in shoes and clothing specifically for ballet dancers, but over the years it has expanded its offerings to include technique slippers, leotards, tights, warm ups, accessories, tutus, and training aids suitable for other types of dance as well as ballet.  Pointe Shoe Manufacturing  Gaynor Minden's unique manufacturing system employs injection molded, thermoplastic elastomeric shanks and toe boxes, in a choice of stiffness. Impact and noise absorbing cellular urethane cushioning is located throughout the shoe. The exterior is traditional satin and a suede outer sole; the linings are treated with silver ion and combined directly to the satin. An elastic drawstring opens at the side.

It was one of several boards that existed during the early years of the United States Department of Defense. The board existed from 1951 to 1956. Background In March and April 1948, the Key West Agreement outlining the division of air assets between the Army, Navy, and Air Force, was drafted by the Secretary of Defense James V. Forrestal and approved by President Harry S Truman. By April 1950, the Army airborne community was expressing an interest in transport helicopters. A panel chaired by Major General William M. Miley reported that troop parachutes were unsatisfactory in part because of the problems encountered in assembling scattered troops after an airdrop. The panel recommended the adoption of convertiplanes and heavy lift helicopters. On 26 April 1951, the Joint Chiefs of Staff approved the first two chapters of Joint Action Armed Forces. On 19 September 1951, the United States Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force jointly published the Joint Action Armed Forces Manual (Army: FM 110‚Äì5, Navy: FAAF, Air Force: AFM 1-1). That manual tasked the United States Army with operating a joint airborne troop board. Army members *Major General William M. Miley, U.S. Army *Major General Albert Pierson, U.S. Army *Lieutenant General Robert Sink, U.S. Army Activities The board was located at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. It first sat in 1951, its establishment with Major General Miley as director pre-dating the formal publication of FM 110‚Äì5; the board was a successor to the Army Airborne Center. It last sat in 1956. George Marvin Johnson, Jr. (later a major general in the U.S. Air Force) opined that the efforts of the Joint Airborne Troop Board led to the replacement of the C-47 transport by the C-130 transport. Major General John DeForest Barker, U.S. Air Force, opined that the failure of the Joint Airborne Troop Board and the other joint boards was not remarkable because they had been tasked to resolve at a lower organizational level problems which could not be resolved at as higher level.

She is believed to be the only female to have been sentenced and executed in the aftermath of the East German uprising of 1953. According to records she claimed to have worked in the political department at Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp and to have been responsible for the deaths of between eighty and ninety inmates. She was sentenced to death on 22 June 1953 by the district court at Halle, found guilty of war mongering and boycott incitement against the German Democratic Republic: she was executed by guillotine two months later. On 22 March 1994 the conviction and sentence were posthumously revoked. There is much that remains unclear about Erna Dorn. Although she was executed as Erna Dorn, no records have surfaced identifying her by that name from before 1945. Surviving sources depend heavily on court files containing records of investigations and researches created during the four years prior to her execution, between 1949 and 1953. Her testimony during this period appears to have become ever more outlandish. There are also suggestions that some of what appears in these East German official records is uncorroborated and might be based on statements inaccurately attributed to Dorn by interrogators. Two alternative birth names that appeared were Erna Kaminski and Erna Br√ºser. Towards the end she came up with more (apparently fictitious) identities for herself. There is an alternative birth date of 28 August 1913. Also, between 1945 and 1949 she was married, and may be identified in sources by her married name as Erna Gewald. (An earlier marriage, between 1935 and 1943, to a Communist activist called Erich Br√ºser, seems to have been another fiction.)  Life  Erna Dorn was born in East Prussia which at that time was part of Germany. (Since 1945 the part of East Prussia in which she was born has been redesignated as the Kaliningrad Oblast and has now become a - physically separated - part of Russia.) She was either born in 1911 in Tilsit or else in 1913 in K√∂nigsberg. Her father, Arthur Kaminsky, was a clerical worker who later, according to research published in 1994, may have worked for the Gestapo during the 1930s, possibly towards the end of that decade as a senior Gestapo officer in K√∂nigsberg. Erna attended an all-girls' secondary school and then embarked on an apprenticeship with the Chamber of Commerce in K√∂nigsberg. From 1932 she was working with the K√∂nigsberg police department where, in one submission, she states she was employed as a typist and in another submission that she was employed as an assistant police officer. According to later statements recorded during the 1950s, from the end of 1934 or early in 1935 she was working for the Gestapo after which, in 1941, she was sent to work in the political department at Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp. An earlier statement, that she herself was arrested by the Gestapo, along with her father and her husband, Erich Br√ºser, in June 1940 and thereafter been held in a succession of concentration camps, had disappeared in later reports. She also stated, according to interrogation records, that between 1934 and 1935 she was a Nazi Party member, but there is no independent confirmation of this. She turned up in Halle in 1945, apparently arriving from the direction of Czechoslovakia, in the context of the massive ethnic cleansing of 1944/45. A forged release document purportedly from the concentration camp at Hertine is dated 12 May 1945 and identifies her as Erna Br√ºser, born Erna Scheffler, the daughter of a railway inspector called Artur Scheffler. For the next six years she lived in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany (after October 1949 relaunched as the German Democratic Republic / East Germany), not as a former Nazi supporter or official, but as a surviving victim of Nazi persecution. She joined the Communist Party in 1945. Following the contentious merger in April 1946 that created what would become the ruling party in a new kind of German one-party dictatorship, she was one of many thousands who lost no time in signing their party membership over to the new Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED). She must have been convincing as a concentration camp survivor. She convinced a veteran of the Spanish Civil War and \\"fighter against Fascism\\", Max Gewald whom she married in December 1945. Shortly afterwards the couple moved into their own two room apartment in which, from March 1946, she is recorded as having lived as a \\"housewife\\". Things began to unravel in August 1948 when the trial opened in Halle of Gertrud Rabestein, notorious as a Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp guard and dog handler. Dorn was called upon to testify. She was probably concerned that her carefully crafted false identity, as a Ravensbr√ºck survivor, might be uncovered if she were to appear in court. She therefore asked to be excused from testifying on the grounds that she was pregnant. The pregnancy lasted two years. In addition to enabling her to avoid the trial of Gertrud Rabestein, it entitled her to various special allowances in a land that, following the slaughter of war, was desperately short of people of working and child bearing age. However, the duration of her pregnancy was eventually noticed. The Union of Persecutees of the Nazi Regime (\\"Vereinigung der Verfolgten des Naziregimes\\" / VVN) produced a report stating that \\"[Dorn] excused herself from the duty [to testify] and for two years presented herself, in writing and through acting, stuffed up with pillows, as a pregnant and thereby silenced woman\\".\\"\\"Sie [Dorn] entzog sich dieser Pflicht und spielte, sage und schreibe 2 Jahre lang mit Kissen ausgestopft, die schwangere, nicht vernehmbare Frau\\"\\" The VVN seems to have played a lead role in building a case against her following the two-year pregnancy. In January 1950 she was sentenced to eleven months in jail for \\"fraud and economic crimes\\". She was expelled from the party. Max Gewald had already divorced her in October or December 1949, and taken the further rather unusual step of obtaining an injunction to prevent her from continuing to use her married name - his name. From this point till her execution Erna Dorn was held in state detention almost permanently. She was released at the end of her initial sentence in December 1950, but after a few weeks at liberty she was arrested in January 1951 and sentenced to eighteen months in jail for theft. Unemployed and homeless she had, it was determined, colluded with accomplices to steal the suitcases of travellers at the city's main railway station. There had been other instances of theft cited, but she was released in November 1951 as part of an amnesty. She was back in prison in December 1951. By this time the accounts of herself that she provided were becoming increasingly fantastical and implausible, possibly in order to impress fellow prisoners and possibly in order to avenge herself against people by whom she felt she had been betrayed. She provided investigators with ever more far-fetched stories about alleged espionage for western powers and her Nazi past. She named Max Gewald, her former husband, as a closet American agent and, later, as Max Baer, a former commanding officer at Ravensbr√ºck. All her allegations were passed on to the newly founded and rapidly developing Ministry for State Security (Stasi) and investigated with excruciating care, causing intense distress to Gewald. Finally she created an elaborate past for herself involving work for the Gestapo and the police during the Nazi years. At one stage she was released, presumably when interrogators concluded that there was no substance to her self-accusations, but elsewhere in the state hierarchy people evidently took a different view. After two weeks she was arrested on suspicion of crimes against humanity and then, on 21 May 1953, sentenced to a fifteen-year jail term by the district court at Halle. She had at one stage claimed to be a dog handler at Ravensbr√ºck who had set dogs to tear apart camp inmates. It was apparently in this context that she said she had been responsible for the deaths of between eighty and ninety concentration camp inmates. However, she was convicted solely on the basis of her own submissions, and the court records consist almost exclusively of notes taken during her interrogation sessions, from which it is apparent that her interrogator, a Leutnant Bischoff, had reacted to her \\"confessions\\" with sustained unbelief. Had the evidence been persuasive and appropriately corroborated it seems likely that her sentence, having regard to the crimes against humanity for which she was convicted, should have been much harsher than a mere custodial one. Intensive follow-up investigation by the VVN and other investigating bodies failed to find any evidence of a Nazi past for either Dorn or Gewald. Meanwhile, the real Max Baer was already facing trial in a West German court while Gertrud Rabestein, the Ravensbr√ºck dog handler, with whose case Erna Dorn had apparently conflated her own self-incrimination, had already been in prison, following her own trial, for two years. Not for the first time, events now intervened to change the course of Erna Dorn's life. Three weeks after her trial, on 17 June 1953, she found herself in the Penal Detention Centre II (\\"Strafvollzugsanstalt II\\") in Halle's \\"Klein Stein Strasse\\" (loosely: \\"Small stone-surfaced street\\"). It remains unclear why she was in the detention facility: there is speculation that she may have still been awaiting transfer to a more permanent prison elsewhere in the country. 17 June 1953 was the high point of the short-lived East German uprising of 1953. There were stoppages and protests across the country, some of them violent. In Halle, around tea time, Penal Detention Centre II was stormed by protesters. Erna Dorn was one of 254 inmates who unexpectedly found themselves free to leave the institution. There are no police or other official reports of what she did next, but according to her own testimony her first destination was the city's evangelical mission in order to obtain civilian clothes, something to eat, and the possibility of a place to sleep. It is not clear whether she was able to stay at the mission overnight, but by Midday on 18 June 1953 she had been recaptured and taken back to prison. On 20 June 1953, two days after her re- capture, an article appeared in the party newspaper, \\"Freiheit\\" (\\"Freedom\\") which named Erna Dorn as an SS commander (\\"SS-Kommandeuse\\"). It appears that the authorities were keen to use the \\"Dorn case\\" as evidence for the fascist character of the 17 June uprising and she was shortly afterwards identified as a leader of the insurrection in Halle. In fact, no independent witness was ever found to testify that she had been present among the 60,000 people who had gathered in the Hallmarkt (central square) on the night of 17 June in order to protest against wage cuts and the Soviet occupation. Nevertheless, following her recapture on 18 June a letter had been \\"found on her\\" including the following text: \\"Dear Dad, Since yesterday I've been at liberty. .... May it be that the hour has now arrived when our beloved F√ºhrer will return and the flags of the Nazi Party will fly again and I will be able to re-apply for my work in the police department or our Gestapo ...\\"\\"Lieber Vati! Seit gestern befinde ich mich in Freiheit. [‚Ä¶] M√∂ge doch nun auch die Stunde kommen, wo unser geliebter F√ºhrer wieder funktioniert und die Fahnen der nationalsozialistischen Partei wehen werden und ich wieder meinen Dienst in der pol. Abtlg. oder bei unserer Gestapo versuchen kann [‚Ä¶].\\" By the time she was identified as an SS commander in \\"Freiheit\\", she had evidently been subjected to interrogation and, to the extent that interrogation evidence presented to the court a few days later is to be taken at face value, she had taken the opportunity to incriminate herself. She asserted that she had addressed the crowd in the Hallmarkt on the night of 17 June and, further, told interrogators that \\"knowing that the government of the German Democratic Republic had been overthrown, I said that the day of liberation had come ... Long live Freedom, Long live Revolution, Down with the Government of the German Democratic Republic\\".\\"Weiterhin sagte ich, da ich in Erfahrung gebracht hatte, dass die Regierung der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik gest√ºrzt ist, dass nun endlich der Tag der Befreiung gekommen ist. [‚Ä¶] es lebe die Freiheit, es lebe die Revolution, nieder mit der Regierung der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik.\\" There is no evidence concerning her alleged speech to the crowd from any of the 60,000 protesters who were present at the time, and there is indeed no information in the court records concerning Erna Dorn's actions and whereabouts between 16.00 and 19.00 during 17 June 1953 from any source other than her own statements as they were recorded by her Stasi interrogators.  Death  An evening session of the Halle district court, lasting three and a half hours, took place on 22 June 1953. Based on the \\"proofs\\" presented to the court, Erna Dorn was condemned to death. An appeal presented by her official defence solicitor and a letter to President Pieck requesting a pardon were both rejected because the accused party was allegedly a ringleader of the recent disruption in Halle. On 28 September 1953 Erna Dorn was transferred to a detention facility in Dresden. On 1 October 1953 she was guillotined at the nearby national execution centre. Her corpse was taken for cremation to Dresden Tolkewitz, in the city's eastern edge. Here the causes of her death were recorded in the crematorium register as \\"Bronchopneumonia 431\\" and \\"acute cardiac and circulatory weaknesses\\".Spiegel TV Magazin: Hinrichtungen in der DDR (Executions in the German Democratic Republic), YouTube-Video, uploaded 31 March 2010. This is almost always the cause of death in the register in respect of the 62 political dissidents from across the country who were executed and cremated in Dresden during the early 1950s.  Trial, conviction and reconsideration  Even after 1990 and the opening up of the Stasi archives, the case of Erna Dorn remains a puzzle, because almost everything that is known about the woman comes from the interrogation records of the Ministry for State Security (usually known more colloquially as \\"the Stasi\\"). At least as regards any of these records created after the events of 17 June 1953, they are subject to the suspicion of modification or worse, since they were produced at a time when the government was consciously trying to find corroboration to support the characterisation of the 1953 uprising as a fascist manifestation. The idea of a trial for \\"crimes against humanity\\" and the concomitant consideration of a death sentence appear only in records dating from after the June uprising. It is also noteworthy that one month earlier, the sentence given to Dorn was uncharacteristically mild under the circumstances. This in turn gives rise to serious doubts over whether, at the trial which is reported to have taken place on 21 May 1953, she really was convicted of the Nazi crimes imputed to her in records which may have been prepared only after 17 June 1953. There indeed remains some doubt over whether the trial of 21 May 1953 ever took place at all. Penal Detention Centre II (\\"Strafvollzugsanstalt II\\"), from which Dorn was unexpectedly released by protesters on 17 June 1953, was a detention facility used for those under investigation. Someone who had been sentenced as a former SS commander four weeks earlier would not normally still be held in this type of facility. By 21 June 1953 the uprising had already been effectively crushed by fraternal Soviet tanks and the newly appointed Justice Minister, Hilde Benjamin was demanding exemplary death sentences in order to provide proof of the fascist origins of the insurrection.Ilko-Sascha Kowalczuk: 17. Juni 1953 - Volksaufstand in der DDR. Edition Temmen, 2003, , pp. 248‚Äì250 Therefore, the interrogators knew before she opened her mouth what Erna Dorn was required to say. And the language she uses in the records of her final interrogation sessions self-evidently employs party jargon and not the somewhat disjointed language of her many earlier submissions. On 22 March 1994 the Halle district court declared Erna Dorn's death sentence unlawful and posthumously revoked it.  The many names of Erna Dorn  Erna Dorn is the name under which her execution in 1953 was recorded, and it is the name by which she has most frequently been identified subsequently. It seems not to have been one of the names by which she was known before 1951, however. When she was re-arrested in November 1951 she had recently received a court injunction in the aftermath of her divorce, preventing her from using her real former married name of Erna Gewald. She now admitted that the identity with which she had arrived in Halle in 1945 was a fiction, and proceeded to create a new (fictitious) identity and autobiographical context which she provided to her interrogators. She said she had worked in the Gestapo and in the concentration camps. Over time she had come into contact with a western espionage ring which was headed up by a former Gestapo man from K√∂nigsberg called Kaminski (or Kaminsky). Her first husband, Erich Dorn, was an SS junior officer had worked as a courier for the espionage ring. Investigators from the Stasi and the VVN brought their resources into play to investigate the story. Enthusiastic VVN investigators reported that they had identified an Erna Dorn, born Erna Kaminski on 17 July 1911 in Tilsit, who had been present at Ravensbr√ºck and at its sub- concentration camp at Zwotka, and that there had been an SS junior officer called Erich Dorn working at Ravensbr√ºck. However, subsequent investigations determined that there had never been a Ravensbr√ºck guard called Dorn, and attempts to match Erna Dorn's narrative to any other couple at the camp failed. Stasi investigators ended up concluding that the entire wartime identity and biography of Erna and Erich Dorn which their subject had created from 1951 was lies from beginning to end. Erna Kaminski was the maiden name imputed to Erna Dorn according to the identity which she created for herself and for the authorities during and after 1951. Whether or not Kaminski was nevertheless her true birth name is unclear. Erna K√∂hler (born Erna Kecker) was the name she offered her interrogators in June 1952. Unlike Erna Dorn, Erna K√∂hler had not been at Ravensbr√ºck but at Auschwitz. Evidently exasperated, her Stasi interrogator Leutnant Lutze noted in his record for 1 August 1953, \\"It turns out that everything from Dorn is a fabrication, with zero correlation to truth\\".\\"Es stellte sich heraus, dass alles von der Dorn wie bisher erschwindelt ist und nicht der Wahrheit entspricht.\\" However, the planned execution having by this time been scheduled and signed off by the Politburo, the writing down of Leutnant Lutze's insight was no reason to set the sentence aside. Erna Scheffler is the most plausible \\"real\\" birth name for the woman identified as Erna Dorn, according to the author and writer Ilko- Sascha Kowalczuk, an experienced and respected scholar and researcher of the single-party dictatorship that was East Germany. Scheffler is the maiden name included in the identity she produced in 1945, and according to which, following her marriage in 1935, she became Erna Br√ºser. Erna Br√ºser is the name used in the forged release document purportedly from the concentration camp at Hertine, dated 12 May 1945 which Erna Dorn used to build her identity after she arrived in Halle in May 1945. It was the name used when she married in December 1945. According to this version of Erna, she was the widow of Erich Br√ºser a member of the (at the time illegal) Communist Party whom she had married in 1935 and who had died in 1943 at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. She said that she and he (along with her father) had been arrested in June 1940, at which time she had lost contact with their two children. Erna Gewald was Erna Dorn's (genuine) married name during her marriage to Max Gewald, between 1945 and their divorce in 1949.

It is written by Steven Moffat and was broadcast on 15 April 2017 on BBC One. \\"The Pilot\\" received mostly positive reviews, with praise on the introduction of Pearl Mackie, and how the episode served both as a soft reboot and as a series premiere. It is the first episode to feature Mackie as the new companion Bill Potts, after the departure of Jenna Coleman at the end of the previous series. The episode also sees the brief return of the Daleks, their last major appearance being that of the previous series' premiere, \\"The Magician's Apprentice\\" / \\"The Witch's Familiar\\". Minisode: \\"Friend from the Future\\" A three-minute sequence billed as an exclusive scene from a future episode was released on 23 April 2016, under the title \\"Friend from the Future\\". The sequence was originally written as an audition scene for casting the role of Bill, but the production team included some of the footage in the final edit of \\"The Pilot\\". From a hidden corner of a corridor inside a spaceship, the Doctor attempts to answer Bill's questions about their enemies. Bill finds them amusing at first, but the Doctor persists and she realises they are in real danger. Plot The Twelfth Doctor and Nardole are living under the guises of a university professor and his assistant. Bill Potts, who works at the university's canteen, is called to the Doctor's office, where he notes she attends all his lectures, and Bill eventually becomes the Doctor's student. Months pass, and Bill develops a mutual attraction to a student named Heather, who has a defect that makes it look like there is a star in her eye. Heather asks her to inspect a mysterious puddle, asking her if she can see what's wrong with her reflection, but Bill does not notice anything except that her face seems wrong somehow. Bill turns around and Heather has left. Within the puddle, a voice proclaims that a search for a pilot has begun. Bill meets Heather again, who encourages her to look into the puddle once more, then apparently vanishes. The Doctor investigates, and notes that the reflection is not a reflection, but something mimicking them and that the puddle is not made of water. Bill returns to her flat, and is chased by a moving body of fluid, which takes Heather's form. She runs to the Doctor's office, where fluid-Heather materialises, forcing him and Bill into the TARDIS. The Doctor moves the TARDIS elsewhere in the university, where he and Nardole check on a vault they have been guarding. They conclude that fluid-Heather is only interested in Bill just as the creature appears, causing the trio to flee in the TARDIS. The TARDIS lands again on a boat in Sydney Harbour facing the Sydney Opera House, where the Doctor admits that he is an alien. The fluid-Heather arrives again, having travelled the planet in just a minute. The Doctor takes them to another planet, millions of years into the future, but she finds them again. The Doctor speculates that the substance is a living fluid from an alien ship, and that it made Heather its \\"pilot\\" because she wanted to run away. He decides to have it chase them through a battle between the Daleks and the Movellans. The fluid-Heather assumes a Dalek's likeness after taking a shot meant for the Doctor and Bill. Bill convinces \\"Heather\\" ‚Äì who wants to make her a passenger ‚Äì to let her go, and it departs. The Doctor and Bill return to his university office, where he attempts to wipe Bill's memories of the day's events, but she stops him. He says that he has promises to keep, that he is in disguise and no-one should know who he is. He changes his mind, however, and as Bill leaves the grounds she finds him waiting for her with the TARDIS. She agrees to travel with the Doctor. =Continuity= The Doctor keeps framed pictures of his wife, River Song, and granddaughter, Susan Foreman, on his desk, along with a collection of his sonic screwdrivers from both the classic and revival series. Some of the items on the Doctor's desk in the episode, on display at a Doctor Who exhibition While being chased by the sentient oil through time, the TARDIS crew journeys to a battle in the war between the Daleks and Movellans, first mentioned in the Fourth Doctor story Destiny of the Daleks (1979). The Doctor prepares to wipe Bill's memories of her experiences with him in the same way he wiped Donna Noble's memories in \\"Journey's End\\" (2008). When Bill asks The Doctor how he would feel having his memory wiped, Clara's theme plays in the background, referencing events of the Series 9 finale \\"Hell Bent\\".  Production  The read-through for this episode and the next episode, \\"Smile\\", took place on 14 June 2016. Filming for these episodes began on 20 June 2016 and concluded on 28 July 2016. The episode was originally titled \\"A Star in Her Eye\\"; it was announced a month before its broadcast in March 2017 that the title had been changed to \\"The Pilot\\", to reflect the \\"rebooting\\" of the programme with the new series. = Cast notes = This is the first episode to feature Pearl Mackie as companion Bill Potts. It also marks the second appearance of Jennifer Hennessy in Doctor Who, who last appeared as Valerie in the third-series episode \\"Gridlock\\" (2007).  Broadcast and reception  The episode was watched by 4.64 million viewers overnight, a slight increase on the opener for the last series, and came third in the ratings behind All Round to Mrs. Brown's and Britain's Got Talent. The episode received 6.68 million views overall and received an Appreciation Index score of 83. = Cinemas = The episode had a cinema screening in the U.S. on 17 and 19 April 2017, two and four days respectively after the episode's initial broadcast. The screening of \\"The Pilot\\" was followed by a screening of \\"For Tonight We Might Die\\", the premiere episode of the spin-off series Class, and behind-the-scenes footage of Pearl Mackie and her journey through the series. The episode was screened in Australian cinemas on 16 April 2017. The screening included a bonus feature \\"Becoming The Companion\\". = Critical reception = \\"The Pilot\\" received positive reviews. Many critics praised the introduction of Pearl Mackie's Bill and noted how the episode's structure allowed for the episode to serve as a reboot as well as a season premiere. It holds an approval score of 95% on Rotten Tomatoes, with the critical consensus stating \\"'The Pilot' successfully reboots the final season of Capaldi's Doctor Who and deftly introduces Pearl Mackie with fresh character development.\\" Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club awarded \\"The Pilot\\" a 'B', calling the episode \\"a solid introduction to Bill as the new companion, with Pearl Mackie bringing an energy distinct from any previous new series companion\\". He closed his review by saying \\"With a promising TARDIS season and two very strong seasons in the show‚Äôs immediate past, there‚Äôs plenty of reason to be optimistic that ‚ÄúThe Pilot‚Äù is the lightweight but necessary table-setting before the real fun begins\\". Nivea Serrao of Entertainment Weekly also gave the episode a rating of \\"A-\\", describing the episode as a \\"fresh start\\" for both the show and Capaldi's Doctor, who she said was criticised for \\"being too dark, and his Doctor not as fun\\" in the previous series. Zoe Delahunty-Light of Games Radar, while claiming that the introduction of Bill was taken too quickly and the alien \\"left a bit to be desired\\", otherwise praised the episode, saying \\"The Pilot\\" \\"lays enough groundwork for some decent stories in season 10\\" and praised the character of Bill. TV Fanaticss Kathleen Wiedel described Mackie as \\"brilliant\\" and also praised the episode's pace, Nardole's comedy and the villain. She also praised the emotional resonance of the scene in which the Doctor went back in time to take photos of Bill's deceased mother. Hanh Nguyen of IndieWire gave the episode a rating of B+, saying the episode \\"felt familiar and comfortable\\", despite the introduction of Bill Potts in the episode. IGNs Scott Collura gave the episode the rating of 8.3, describing the episode as a \\"amicable and fun introduction\\" and said the episode \\"hits some standard Who checkpoints\\". He also described the episode as \\"a fun if mostly lightweight excursion for the Doctor\\". Collura also said he \\"instantly fell\\" for the character of Bill. Ross Ruediger of New York Magazine gave the episode 4 of 5 stars, describing Bill as \\"a wonderful change of pace\\" compared to previous companions, and also praised the mystery in the episode. Before the episode was broadcast, Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times gave a positive review of the episode, describing Pearl Mackie as \\"instantly winning as fledgling companion Bill\\", and also praising Nardole's \\"impeccable comic timing, spinning sarky asides, peculiar squeals and amusing lines\\" and described the episode as a \\"complete reboot\\". He also gave the episode a positive review after the episode was broadcast, praising how Bill and Heather's romance fitted into the plot of the episode. Ben Lawrence of The Telegraph said Mackie gave her character \\"a humanity and a warmth\\", saying it was missing from the character of Clara Oswald, and said Bill being \\"sweet and vulnerable\\" made her fit with Capaldi's character. He gave the episode 4 of 5 stars, saying it did not \\"[push] all the buttons\\" but overall gave the episode a good review. Catherine Gee of The Telegraph gave a mixed to negative review, saying the episode was \\"a clunky introduction\\" to the series, that it was \\"let down by a flimsy storyline, clunky special effects and an underdeveloped foe\\". Gee said Mackie was \\"doing a good job\\" but she \\"lacked the charismatic spark of Jenna Coleman\\", whilst acknowledging this was Mackie's first role in television. Gee found the character of Bill a \\"muddle\\", but praised the show for presenting a character whose background is not middle-class. She then went on to criticise Murray Gold's score. Den of Geeks Simon Brew also gave a positive review of the episode, saying despite this series premiere not being as energetic as previous series premieres, it was \\"good fun\\" praising the humour in the episode and Mackie's performance. Digital Spy's Morgan Jeffery gave the episode a mainly positive review and considered the episode to be a \\"soft reboot\\" which was enjoyable for both established viewers and those new to the show. Jeffery found Mackie to be \\"immediately engaging\\" and a good match with Capaldi's Doctor. He also praised the visual presentation and \\"taut direction\\" but felt the show lost its way to some extent in the last 10 minutes and that Nardole was somewhat superfluous to the story.

She has pioneered the use of Internet and Communications Technologies (ICTs) to promote social justice in South Africa and throughout the world, focusing on affordable internet access. She has been the Executive Director of the Association for Progressive Communications since 2000 until April 2017, when she became APC's Director of Policy and Strategy.  Education and work  Esterhuysen holds a BA in Social Science, a Post Graduate Diploma in Library and Information Science and a BA in Musicology from the University of the Witwatersrand. During her university years, she was campus coordinator for the South African Student Press Union. In 1994, Anriette became the inaugural Executive Director of SANGONeT, a South African communications NGO, which itself was a merger of Worknet (a communications NGO and member of the Association for Progressive Communications) and the Development Resources Center's Handsnet initiative. SANGONeT provided Internet connectivity, technical training, and website hosting to civil society organisations, trade unions, and others engaged in the mass democratic movement. In 1992-1993 she was Director of Information Services at South Africa's Development Resources Centre, where she set up a library and online news service for the NGO sector in South and Southern Africa, while mobilising information technologies to facilitate information and communication exchange in the broader development sector. Prior to that, she was Chief Librarian and consultant for the South African Council of Churches (SACC), where she facilitated training in documentation techniques and information management. From 1980 onwards, Esterhuysen was active in the struggle against Apartheid. Through her work at the SACC, and with the Church becoming an important civil society space at the height of the anti-apartheid struggle, she saw the increasing importance of technology in accessing and sharing information. ‚ÄúIn the late ‚Äò80s, anti-apartheid groups, labour federations, environmental organisations and members of the green movement began using emerging communications technology to further their work in social justice and activism. It was out of this development that APC was formed in 1990.‚Äù During the transition to democracy, Esterhuysen worked in promoting the use of ICTs to the emerging community of local NGOs. Esterhuysen is currently a member of the Multistakeholder Advisory Group of the Internet Governance Forum. She is a founder of Women's Net in South Africa and has served on the Technical Advisory Committee of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa and on the boards of the Global e-Schools and Communities Initiative and Ungana- Afrika. Prior to joining APC Esterhuysen was executive director of South African Internet service provider member SANGONeT. Between 2002 and 2005, she was a member of the United Nations Information and Communication Technologies Task Force. In November 2019, Esterhuysen was appointed by the Secretary- General of the United Nations to serve as the Chair of the Multistakeholder Advisory Group, the coordination body for the Internet Governance Forum  Awards and achievements  She was one of five finalists for IT Personality of the Year in South Africa in 2012. She was inducted to the Internet Hall of Fame in 2013 as a \\"Global Connector\\". In 2015, she was the winner of the Electronic Frontier Foundation' s Pioneer Awards.

Life He was born in Paris and was educated at the Coll√®ge Sainte-Barbe and the Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand. Having demonstrated from childhood a talent for technology, his father decided to let him study at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris. He later moved to Britain to continue his studies in Manchester. On his return to France his intention was to build steam engines but he was prevented from doing so by lack of funds. Instead he opened a Paris workshop in 1844 where, among other things, he worked on a telegraph with written and keyboard signals, improved Gaetan Bonelli's electric loom and helped William Hughes improve his early typewriter. He also worked on the gyroscope with L√©on Foucault, for whom he also made the pendulum for his famous demonstration in 1851. In 1854 he built a simpler and improved version of Charles Shepherd's electromechanical clock. He is best known for designing early electric motors for industrial use, for which he was awarded the valuable Volta Prize in 1857. In his design electromagnets were energized to attract iron rods attached to a rotating flywheel. At the moment that an iron rod reached the electromagnet, the power to the solenoid was interrupted until the next iron rod approached the electromagnet. On his death in 1865 he was buried in the P√®re-Lachaise cemetery in Paris.

It was a parasol wing aircraft, seating two in tandem. Design and development The parasol winged Hanriot H.34 was intended to complement the very successful biplane HD.14. It was designed to be easy to fly and, with a low wing loading, to have low stalling and landing speeds. Both types placed instructor and pupil in tandem, with dual controls. The wing of the H.34 was in three parts. The two outer sections had parallel, straight and unswept leading and trailing edges and straight, angled tips. They were also cut away at their inner ends, where they met a rectangular, reduced chord centre section, producing a cut-out out over the rear seat. Narrow chord ailerons filled most of the trailing edge. The wings were of mixed construction with pairs of duralumin spars and wooden ribs but the ailerons were all-metal. Pairs of parallel, rearward-leaning struts linked the lower fuselage and the outer wing spars and four vertical struts from the upper fuselage to the centre section formed a cabane. The H.34 was powered initially by a Le Rh√¥ne 9C rotary engine, but could also be powered by Anzani 10C or Salmson 9Ac radial engines. Its neat cowling merged into the circular section, aluminium-covered front fuselage which extended back to the forward cockpit. The cockpit section and rear fuselage had a rectangular section defined by four spruce longerons and was fabric covered. The instructor sat in the forward seat, with the pupil behind in a cockpit wide enough to accept two sitting side-by-side if necessary. Aft, the fuselage tapered in plan to a conventional empennage. Its tailplane, with a similar plan to the wing, was mounted on top of the fuselage at an angle of incidence that could be adjusted in flight. It was braced by parallel pairs of struts from the lower longerons and carried angular elevators. The fin was rounded, bearing a full, curved rudder which reached down to the keel and operated in an elevator cut-out. The H.34 had fixed, tailskid landing gear, with its mainwheels apart on an axle articulated in the centre. The outer ends of the axle were rubber sprung on V-struts from the lower longerons and its centre supported from a false axle. The first flight was made in 1924; though the date is unknown, it was flying by mid-September, taking part in the Auvergne aero-club national rally. By November it was under test at Villacoublay. The H.34 was developed into the Hanriot H.35 advanced trainer which had the same layout and appearance and a wing of the same construction and dimensions, but with a much more powerful Hispano-Suiza 8Ab and an dural-framed fuselage. It was longer, heavier and faster. Variants ;H.34:The basic original aircraft powered by a Le Rh√¥ne 9C. ;H.34bis:Powered by an Anzani 10C of .

Early life and education  Morton was born in 1963 in Toronto, Ontario and raised in Burlington, Ontario. She is based in Guelph. She trained as a sculptor, earning a Bachelor of Fine Art Degree from York University in 1990. In 1980, Morton learned to knit in Denmark.  Artistic practice  The artist began incorporating wool and yarn into her laborious textile-based work in 1992. Morton states; \\" Since 1992 I have used knitting and sewing symbolically and subversively in my work, as blatant low-tech metaphors. By employing these stereotypically domestic techniques and materials, I shift the axis from private to public, mundane to monumental, and attempt to address the confounding and complex ways that \\"value\\" is assigned to both objects and time investment.\\" She also uses recycled materials and materials from nature, and additionally works in video, performance, and public sculpture. Occasionally, Morton works collaboratively. An example of Morton‚Äôs work is Cozy (1999-2000), which was affiliated with the Textile Museum of Canada (Toronto, Ontario). Morton constructed the work using over 800 reclaimed off-white sweaters, hand knit architectural details, custom made buttons and industrial velcro. It covered a small home on Ward's Island (Toronto, Ontario) for eighteen days in November 1999 and a metal scaffold structure at Trinity Square Park (Toronto, Ontario) for three days in April 2000. In the thesis The Strength of a Knitted Home: Retrieving Histories through Janet Morton‚Äôs Wool Installations, author Emily Jane Rothwell explores a socio-economic interpretation of Cozy; for example, she observes media bias in favor of the Ward Island installation, which was associated more with ideals of nature and the middle class, whereas the urban installation was linked more to the lower class, as homeless people lived (at the time and thereafter) in the park. In Morton‚Äôs own words, \\"The concept [for Cozy] came from my thinking about the idea of home. Homelessness is inextricably connected to our feelings, thoughts and experience of home. I did not need to discuss \\"homelessness\\", it was implicit in the project. It was essential to me that Cozy was installed in both contexts. \\" Morton describes herself as a feminist, but states that her art is not intended to be \\"overtly political.\\"  Exhibition history, collections and awards  A retrospective of twenty years of her work, entitled The Ravelled Sleeve, was held in 2012 at the McDonald Stewart Art Centre at the University of Guelph (Guelph, Ontario). Morton‚Äôs work is in the collections of Cambridge Galleries, Museum London, and the National Gallery of Canada, as well as corporate and private collections. Morton has received funding from the Toronto Arts Council, Ontario Arts Council, and the Canada Council for the Arts. In 2001, she was the recipient of the Paris Studio Award (France) from the latter funding agency.

Working as an ethnographer, lecturer and professional photographer, Plickov√° documented and researched folk culture and crafts. She received the Gold Medal of ƒΩudov√≠ta ≈†t√∫ra in 1988 for her work to preserve and conserve Slovak folk culture. Early life Ester Plickov√° was born on 2 July 1928 in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia to the historian, Vladim√≠r Plicka. From childhood, Plickov√° and her sister were active in sports and involved in cultural activities. In addition to being an expert of Bratislava's history, her father wrote children's stories and her uncle, Karel Plicka was a noted photographer. As a child, Plickov√° often accompanied her uncle on photographic expeditions to unusual places and served him by carrying his equipment and observing his work. She attended high school at the , before beginning her higher education at the Comenius University in the philosophy faculty. Simultaneously, she completed a two-year course at the School of Photography Arts in Bratislava and spent a year studying in Prague, taking courses on art history and ethnography, before graduating in 1952. Career In 1952, Plickov√° was hired as the first ethnographer at the Slovak National Museum and left there in 1955, when she began working at the Institute of Ethnology. In 1961, she defended her thesis for her PhD with a study of Slavic Pottery. Early in her career she recognized that social change was replacing traditional culture and photography was a means to preserve artistic expression, rites, rituals, and traditions. Criss-crossing the country, she took photographs of folk festivals and craft shows, architectural monuments, industrial works, and nature. Some of the images she made in the early part of her career depict items which are no longer extant, such as the bombed Apollo refinery, a mining shaft in Kremnica, or the ruins of the Bratislava Castle, before its restoration. As part of her duties at the Institute of Ethnology, Plickov√° organized numerous conferences and exhibitions in addition to her lectures. In a 1966 collaboration with , she co-authored the program for a nationwide exhibition of Czechoslovakian folk pottery with examples spanning from the 16th century to the 1960s. In 1978, she worked on an exhibition in Faenza, Italy featuring Slovak ceramics. Plickov√° also processed multiple collections, such as ≈†tefan Cyril Parr√°k's Trnava ceramics grouping. Linking her ethnographic work to her photography, Plickov√° worked as a professional photographer and exhibited her photographs in numerous domestic and international venues, such as one held in Baghdad in 1967. Between 1961 and 1986 Plickov√° was a member of the international council of the European magazine, Demos, which was published in Germany until 2002. She published numerous scientific studies and photographic collections. Among her most known works were Pozd√≠≈°ovsk√© hrnƒçiarstvo (Late Slavic Pottery, 1959), Dunaj v ƒåeskoslovensku (photography: The Danube in Czechoslovakia, 1965), Jadran (photography: The Adriatic, 1976 and 1980), Maƒæovan√© sala≈°e (Painted huts, 1982) and (The Beauty of Clay, 1996). Also well known are her pictorial collections published in the book Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica (1957, 1973, 1982). In 1988, Plickov√° was awarded the Gold Medal ƒΩudov√≠ta ≈†t√∫ra from the Slovak Academy of Sciences (SAS) for her contributions to preserving the folk culture of Slovakia. She retired from the Institute of Ethnology in 1989 and though she had problems with her vision in her retirement, she worked with the Centre for Folk Art Production () in their development and continued her research and publishing. In 2005, the SAS recognized her contributions again by honoring her as the Personality of the Year. Death and legacy Plickov√° died on 1 December 2011 in Bratislava, Slovakia. Shortly before her death, a solo exhibition of her photographic works was presented.

Predominantly based in the Ghanaian capital, Accra, the Clerks were traditionally Protestant Christian and affiliated to the Presbyterian Church. The Clerk family is primarily a member of the Ga coastal people of Accra and in addition, has Euro-Afro- Caribbean heritage, descending from Jamaican, German and Danish ancestry.  History  The Clerk family was founded by Alexander Worthy Clerk (1820 ‚Äì 1906), a Jamaican Moravian missionary who arrived in the Danish Protectorate of Christiansborg ‚Äì the suburb of Osu in Accra, Gold Coast, now Ghana, on either Easter Sunday, 16 April or Easter Monday, 17 April 1843 as per differing historical accounts. Clerk was part of the first group of 24 West Indian settler missionaries who worked under the auspices of the Basel Evangelical Missionary Society of Basel, Switzerland. A. W. Clerk's hometown was Fairfield, a town located in Manchester Parish, Jamaica. In 1848, he married Pauline Hesse (1831‚Äì1909), a trader from the notable Euro-Ga Hesse family of Osu Amantra. Alexander Clerk was also a pioneer of the precursor to the Presbyterian Church of Ghana and a leader in education in colonial Ghana, co-establishing a boarding middle school for boys, the Salem School, Osu in 1843. Furthermore, Clerk and the other West Indian missionary emigrants introduced new seedlings such as breadfruit, guava and pear to the Gold Coast food economy and their progeny was instrumental in the expansion of the science and practice of agricultural education in the country. During the colonial era, the Clerks were among an illustrious group of thinkers, often from the coastal areas of Ghana, who flourished in the arts and sciences, spanning multiple familial generations. Outside academia, the family was also active in the upper echelons of government, including diplomacy. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, several prominent members of the Clerk family dominated various spheres of public life in Gold Coast society and later, modern Ghana, making significant and pioneering social and scientific contributions to the domestic and regional knowledge economy through the growth of architecture, church development, civil service, education, journalism, medicine, natural sciences, public administration, public health, public policy and urban planning. The Clerk family is related through marriage to several distinguished indigenous Ga families of Accra like the Adom, Nikoi, Odamtten, Ollennu, Quao and Sai families among others. Some historically renowned Gold Coast families, mainly from southern Ghana, of Akyem, Anlo Ewe, Fante and Ga ethnicities that thrived in various intellectual pursuits within this period include the Ba√´ta, Bartels, Brew, Casely-Hayford, Easmon, Gbeho and Ofori-Atta families. In the broader context, this era of creative ferment, marked by an outpouring of educational achievement, was a catalyst for the eventual push for the country's independence by the Gold Coast intelligentsia. Other learned persons were the Accra literati, linked by intermarriage, as well as trade and commerce along the Gold Coast, such as the Bannerman, Bruce, Hutton-Mills, Meyer, Quist, Reindorf and Vanderpuije families. Other educators such as Hall and Miller were based in the peri-urban Akan hinterland.

The line is also an important freight railway, it is 24 kilometres (15 miles) long.  History  On 17 August 1891, the first section between Schiedam Centrum and Maassluis was opened as a heavy-rail line. The section between Maassluis and Hoek van Holland Strand followed on 1 June 1893. In 1935, the entire route was electrified. The Stena Line provides a ferry service to Harwich International Port in Harwich, England, from the Hoek van Holland Haven station. Formerly, other international train services used the line, as far as Moscow or Berlin; travellers can easily change at Hoek van Holland to the ferry. Since the opening of the Channel Tunnel in 1994, the importance of this line has decreased sharply. On 31 March 2017, the final passenger trains of the Nederlandse Spoorwegen ran on the line and they have been replaced by a temporary bus service until the line reopened in 2019 as part of the Rotterdam Metro. The overhead electrification system has been converted to 750 V DC and the railway stations to metro standards. Also, in Maassluis, a new station, Steendijkpolder, is built, but plans for additional intermediate stations in Schiedam and Hoek van Holland have not been specified. The Hoek van Holland Strand station will also be moved closer to the beach, as the name suggests.  Services  Until 2017, there were five Sprinter trains per hour from Rotterdam Centraal station to Maassluis West and half-hourly services to Hoek van Holland Haven. In the peak season, all trains usually terminating at Maassluis West were extended to Hoek van Holland Haven, and the service between Rotterdam Centraal and Vlaardingen Centrum was increased to every 7.5 minutes. Service to Hoek van Holland Strand was only provided every hour during the summer months. Between April 2017 and February 2018, four rail-replacement bus lines (711, 712, 156 and 713) run alongside the regular bus lines (56, 57 and 126). These services were being operated by RET. Rail-replacement services were originally scheduled to run only until September 2017; however, unforeseen events caused a delay in re-opening the track until October 2019. These include more soil contamination and asbestos than anticipated as well as finding cables which had not been documented during preliminary investigations and which had to be removed or, for the ones which were still active, moved. Metro line B from Nesselande runs with 10-minute intervals from Schiedam to Hoek van Holland Haven, half of which will terminate at Maassluis Steendijkpolder. Furthermore, metro line A provides a service from Binnenhof to Vlaardingen West during peak hours. The line will remain open to freight trains, retaining a connection to the national rail network at Schiedam. The line was reopened on 30 September 2019 for a test period of four weeks. On 1 November 2019 it was officially reopened.

He attained the rank of major general, and is best known for his World War I command of Camp Wadsworth (near Spartanburg, South Carolina) and the 96th Division. Carleton was an 1881 graduate of the United States Military Academy; assigned to the Cavalry, he served throughout the west during the last of the American Indian Wars. He was a veteran of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, and the Veracruz Expedition. During World War I, he commanded Camp Zachary Taylor, Kentucky and the 159th Depot Brigade, followed by Camp Wadsworth, South Carolina and the 96th Division, and then Camp Kearny, California and the 16th Division. After the war, Carleton commanded Camp Lewis, Washington and the 166th Depot Brigade. After serving with the Inspector General's Department in San Francisco, Carleton retired in 1921. He died in San Antonio, Texas in 1946, and was buried at Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery. Early life and education Guy Edward Carleton was born in Austin, Texas on September 9, 1857, the son of William Carleton (1812-1865) and Elizabeth (Coxhead) Carleton, natives of England who had immigrated to the United States in 1834. William Carleton was a participant in the Texas Revolution on the side of the Texans, including the Battle of Goliad. William and Elizabeth Carleton subsequently moved to New Orleans, where William Carleton worked as a journalist. He returned to Texas in the 1850s and settled in Austin; awarded bounty lands in recognition of his military service, Carleton sold his grants to finance the start of a newspaper. He served as publisher and editor of the weekly Austin Rambler until his death. Guy Carleton was his parents' ninth child; he attended Austin's J. B. Smith School and Texas Military Academy, after which he began to study law in the office of his older brother Frederick. In addition, Carleton worked as treasurer and bookkeeper for the Austin Street Railway Company. In 1877, Carleton won appointment to the United States Military Academy; he graduated in 1881, ranked number 17 of 53. Start of career =Indian Wars= Carleton requested service in the Cavalry branch, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 2nd Cavalry Regiment. Carleton served on the frontier during the last of the American Indian Wars, including postings to Fort Assinniboine, Fort McGinnis, and Fort Custer in Montana, as well as Fort Coeur d' Alene, Idaho from 1881 to 1886. From 1886 to 1889, he was Corps Commandant and professor of military science at the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas. After completing his assignment at Texas A&M;, Carleton rejoined the 2nd Cavalry, and served briefly at Fort Walla Walla, Washington and in Arizona before moving on to Fort Wingate, New Mexico, where he remained until 1895. Carleton performed recruiting duty in Saint Paul, Minnesota from 1895 to 1897, after which he rejoined the 2nd Cavalry at Fort Riley, Kansas. From April to July, 1898 he commanded Troop L, 2nd Cavalry. =Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War= On July 1, 1898, Carleton received promotion to captain, and was assigned to the 10th Cavalry in Huntsville, Alabama. After moving to Fort Sam Houston, Texas to complete training, in the spring of 1899 the 10th Cavalry proceeded to Cuba. Carleton was assigned to a troop that patrolled the Province of Santiago, after which he commanded the District of Campechuela, before the troop moved to Manzanillo. After returning to the United States in early 1900, the 10th Cavalry performed patrol duty along the Texas-Mexico Border. As commander of the garrison based at Fort Ringgold near Rio Grande City, Texas, Carleton was commended for his work to improve civilian goodwill towards the soldiers in the area, which had been in decline during the war. =Philippine-American War= After returning to Fort Sam Houston for training and garrison duty from September 1900 to April 1901, in April the 10th Cavalry departed for the Philippines. The 10th Cavalry served in the Gandara Valley on the Island of Samar, and were credited with destroying an insurgent camp at Blanca Aurora, which enabled them to end the insurgency in the Gandara Valley (now Gandara, Samar). Carleton commanded 2nd Squadron, 10th Cavalry, after which he was detailed to serve in the Paymaster's Department in Manila, after which he continued to serve as a paymaster at Fort Sam Houston. Later career =Captain to lieutenant colonel= In late 1905, Carleton was assigned to the 13th Cavalry Regiment at Fort Riley, Kansas. He was promoted to major in the 13th Cavalry in 1906, and then returned to the Philippines with the 4th Cavalry Regiment, serving this time on the Island of Jolo. He returned to the United States with the 4th Cavalry, and served at Fort Meade in South Dakota as commander of 3rd Squadron, 4th Cavalry until he was assigned as a student at Fort Leavenworth's School of the Line. Upon completing the 10-week course, Carleton became a student at the United States Army War College; after his graduation, he was retained there as an instructor. In 1912, Carleton was promoted to lieutenant colonel and assigned to the 3rd Cavalry Regiment, after which he performed patrol duty with his regiment on the Texas-Mexico border. He subsequently commanded the post at Eagle Pass, Texas, and then the Brownsville District. =Lieutenant colonel to colonel= In 1914, Carleton was assigned to the Port of Galveston, Texas as embarkation officer, and was responsible for arranging transportation for troops, animals and equipment taking part in the Veracruz Expedition. In 1916, Carleton was promoted to colonel and assigned to the Inspector General's Department in San Francisco. From October 1916 to early 1917, Carleton served with the Inspector General's Department in the Philippines. World War I At the start of World War I, Carleton was promoted to temporary brigadier general, and assigned to command Camp Zachary Taylor, Kentucky and the 159th Depot Brigade. In the late 1918, Carleton was promoted to temporary major general; the War Department gave Carleton the option of departing for France, potentially to assume command of the 4th Division, or taking command of Camp Wadsworth, South Carolina and the 96th Division. Carleton opted for Camp Wadsworth, with the assumption that he would organize and train the 96th Division and then lead it in combat in France. The Armistice in November ended the need for new soldiers in France, and the 96th Division was demobilized. Post-World War I In 1919, Carleton took command of the 16th Division at Camp Kearny, California in order to prepare it for possible service as part of American Expeditionary Force Siberia; the 16th Division's services were not needed in Siberia, and Carleton demobilized it. He then commanded Camp Lewis and the 166th Depot Brigade, where he oversaw demobilization and discharge of soldiers returning from France. After completing his demobilization duties, Carleton reverted to his permanent rank of colonel, and commanded the 10th Cavalry Regiment in Arizona; he served again with the Inspector General's Department in San Francisco until he retired on September 9, 1921. Awards Carleton received the Army Distinguished Service Medal for his service as commander of Camp Wadsworth and the 96th Division during World War I. His other awards included the Indian Campaign Medal, Spanish Campaign Medal, Army of Cuban Occupation Medal, Philippine Campaign Medal, Mexican Border Service Medal, and World War I Victory Medal. Retirement and death In retirement, Carleton was a resident of San Antonio, Texas. In 1930, Congress passed a law allowing World War I generals to retire at the highest rank they had held, and Carleton was promoted to major general on the retired list. He died in San Antonio on January 8, 1946, and was buried at Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery, Section E, Site 383. Family Carleton married Cora Belle Arthur in Austin on June 20, 1883.

During a time when women were denied admittance to formal art academies, the Bauhaus provided them with an unprecedented level of opportunity for both education and artistic development, though generally only in weaving and other fields considered at the time to be appropriate for women.https://www.artspace.com/magazine/art_101/in_depth/the-other-art- history-the-forgotten-women-of-bauhaus-55526 The Bauhaus was founded by the architect Walter Gropius in 1919 and operated until 1933. The school's main objective was the unification of the arts. The Bauhaus taught a combination of fine arts, craft and industrial arts, and design theory in order to produce artists that were equipped to create both practical and aesthetically pleasing works to cater to an increasingly industrialized world. The school had a significant impact on the development of art, architecture, graphic design, interior design, industrial design and typography. Brief history of the Bauhaus At the Bauhaus's inception, the school was located in Weimar. In its inaugural year, more female students applied than male students. The accepted students came from varied socio-economic and educational backgrounds. The curriculum began with a technical introduction to the arts through a study of materials, colour theory, and formal relationships meant to prepare the students for their later studies in specialized programs. Initially, most female students specialized in the disciplines of weaving or ceramics. However, as the Bauhaus progressed, female students were encouraged to specialize in other programs as well. This shift was predominantly facilitated by the radical Hungarian artist, L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy, who became a part of the Bauhaus's administration in 1923. In 1925, the Bauhaus moved to Dessau, where Gropius designed a new building for the school that embodied the fundamental design theory of the Bauhaus. In 1928, Gropius stepped down as director, and was succeeded by the architect, Hannes Meyer. A few years later, the increasingly conservative municipal government forced Meyer to resign and replaced him with Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. In 1932, the school moved once again to Berlin. Due to the changes in location and leadership, the Bauhaus school's artistic and political objectives continuously shifted, which contributed to the school's financial instability. Due to the increasing political pressure of the anti-modernist Nazi government, the Bauhaus shut its doors in 1933. Some key female artists Anni Albers was born in Berlin on June 12, 1899. She grew up in an affluent family, and became interested in the visual arts at an early age. She produced many of her own drawings and paintings, while studying under impressionist artist, Martin Brandenburg. Despite the traditional views of her family, she left the domestic life to pursue a career in art. Albers attended the Bauhaus as a young student in 1922, where she specialized in weaving. In her career, she successfully merged textile crafts with industrial production and abstract modernist design, which brought unity to the three areas. Albers died May 9, 1994. Portrait of Marianne Brandt Marianne Brandt was born in Chemnitz on October 1, 1893. Initially, Brandt was trained as a painter, but became the first woman admitted into the metalworking program at the Bauhaus. Brandt studied under Moholy-Nagy, and was eventually appointed workshop assistant. Brandt ended up succeeding Moholy-Nagy as the workshop's studio director in 1928. Her industrial designs for household objects have been recognized as iconic expressions of the Bauhaus aesthetic. Brandt died on June 18, 1983. Alma Siedhoff-Buscher was born on January 4, 1899. She attended the Bauhaus from 1922 to 1925, where she studied sculpture and colour theory under Josef Hartwig and Paul Klee. Eventually, Buscher became a successful toy designer. Her most successful works included a line of dolls. Buscher died on September 25, 1944, in a bombing near Frankfurt. Friedl Dicker was born in Vienna on July 30, 1898. She attended the Bauhaus from 1919 to 1923, where she was involved in the textile design, printmaking, bookbinding and typography workshops. Dicker excelled at the school, as well as in her professional career. She was particularly successful in the fields of painting, jewelry and costume design, as well as interior design. Dicker died on October 9, 1944, in the Auschwitz concentration camp. Ilse Fehling was born on April 25, 1896. She began attending the Bauhaus in 1920, where she studied in the sculpting, painting and theatre workshops. Fehling was the only female sculptor at the school. Although she never graduated from the Bauhaus, she had a successful career, as she gained fame from her stage and costume designs for theatres and films. She developed a circular stage design, which was patented in 1922. Fehling died on February 25, 1982. Marguerite Friedlaender-Wildenhain was born on October 11, 1896. Wildenhain was the first German female pottery master to complete her apprenticeship exam. She established a successful workshop in Amsterdam before leaving for the United States in the 1940s. She then achieved a successful career in California. Wildenhain died on February 24, 1985. Gertrud Grunow was born on July 8, 1870. She developed theories concerning the relationship between sound, colour and movement. Grunow taught at the Bauhaus from 1919 to 1923, where she taught classes in dance, music and \\"practical harmonizing.\\" She was initially employed as an assistant teacher, but eventually became the only female form master at the school. Grunow died on June 11, 1944. D√∂rte Helm was born on December 3, 1898 in Berlin. Helm studied at the Kunsthochschule Kassel, the Grand-Ducal Saxon Art School, Weimar and attended 1919 the Bauhaus, where she was an apprentice in the mural and textile workshop. In 1922 she passed the journeyman's examination as a decorative painter in front of the Weimar Chamber of Crafts. In 1921 she was involved in the project de:Haus Sommerfeld from Gropius, she made an application curtain and worked as a consultant in the interior design. 1922/1923 she worked in the weaving workshop and in 1923 in the exhibition commission for the Bauhaus exhibition and was represented on this with a wall hanging and a wall shield. She works from 1924 in Rostock and since 1932 in Hamburg. From 1933 she was occupied by the Reich Chamber of Culture Act as a \\"Half-Jewish\\" with a professional ban, she could now only be literary. She died on February 24 , 1941 in Hamburg. Florence Henri was born on June 28, 1893 in New York City. Initially, Henri attended the Bauhaus, where she studied in the painting workshop. However, she enrolled in a summer photography course that was taught by Moholy-Nagy. By 1928, Henri had ceased painting and left the school. She eventually established a successful photography studio in Paris. In her career, Henri focused mainly on avant- garde photography. She died on July 24, 1982. Grete Heymann-Loebenstein was born on August 10, 1899. She was a ceramicist who came to the Bauhaus with a prior education in the arts and eventually found professional success. In 1923, she established the Hael Workshops for Art Ceramics, which was a very lucrative business, until its forced closure and sale in 1933. Eventually, she moved to England, where she continued to produce ceramics and paintings, which were praised in post-war London. Heymann died on November 11, 1990. Lucia Moholy was born on January 18, 1894 in Prague. She attended the Bauhaus, where was trained as a photographer. Moholy captured many images that are essential to the documented history of the Bauhaus. She was also the wife of the master, L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy. During her career, she and her husband experiment with different processes in the darkroom, like photogram. Moholy died on May 17, 1989. Lilly Reich was born on June 16, 1885 in Berlin. Reich had prior experience working with embroidery, and designed a variety of clothing and furniture. In 1932, she was asked to teach at the Bauhaus, and direct the interior design workshop. Although the Bauhaus was closed shortly after, Reich continued to have a successful career as an interior designer. She died on December 14, 1947. Gunta St√∂lzl Lou Scheper was born on May 15, 1901. Schemer was a skilled painter, who attended the Bauhaus in 1920. She studied mural painting at the school and developed a long career as a painter, children's book illustrator, and architectural designer. She also continued in the fields of theatre design, illustration and colour theory after she left the school in 1922. Scheper died on April 11, 1976 in Berlin. Grete Stern was born on May 9, 1904. Stern attended the Bauhaus from 1930 to 1933, where she studied, and later taught, photography. Later in her career, she established a photography practice with fellow Bauhaus photographer, Ellen Rosenberg. Due to the political climate of Nazi Germany, Stern emigrated to Argentina, where she died on December 24, 1999. Gunta St√∂lzl was born on March 5, 1897. She attended the Bauhaus, where she studied weaving and textiles. After graduating from her program, St√∂lzl returned to the Bauhaus to lead the weaving workshop in 1926. She became the first official female department head, and was the only female master at the school. St√∂lzl played a crucial role in the development of the school's weaving workshop, as she focused on designing and weaving abstract textiles for commercial and industrial use. Controversies Although the school was praised for its more progressive approach to gender equality, some criticize the schools reputation, claiming that many of its female members went unnoticed both during and after the school's short existence. Others claim that although the school fronted progressive ideas of gender equality, its administration was rooted in ideals of the past and in misogyny. In the case of Gertrud Arndt, she aspired to study architecture, but was instead redirected into the more domestic or \\"feminine\\" subject of weaving, after the administration claimed that there were no available architecture classes for her. Similarly, the school also attempted to redirect Benita Koch-Otte into more domestic subjects, but she persevered with her original studies and became an influential figure in both textile design and art education. However, during her studies, she was often encouraged to give up some of her classes in order to spend more time gardening. Another source of criticism surrounds the belief that Gropius's proclamation of gender equality \\"remained theoretical in the teaching field.\\" This refers to the gender ratio in the faculty, in which only six of forty-five faculty members were female at the Weimer location. The ratio of female to male faculty members did not improve much as the school progressed. Additionally, the decreasing number of female faculty members paralleled the decrease in female enrolment. The decline in female enrolment also corresponded to Gropius's alterations to the acceptance policy for women. Because of the initially high influx of female students, Gropius stated that \\"for the foreseeable future, only women of extraordinary talents would be accepted into the school.\\" Some argue that this allowed Gropius to accept less female students on the pretence of talent recognition, which also contributed to the decrease in female students. Furthermore, there was also criticism concerning the apprenticeship programs offered at the school. As previously discussed, the majority of female students at the Bauhaus specialized in weaving. However, the school did not offer apprenticeship certificates in weaving, which meant that it was impossible for women to register their trade with the Chamber of Trade. This prevented them from acquiring master's diplomas, which placed limits on the future possibilities of their careers. Exhibitions Bauhaus Archive In recent years, the Bauhaus Archive in Berlin has tried to make amends to the women of the Bauhaus who felt marginalized at the school, by hosting a series of exhibitions, titled \\"Female Bauhaus.\\" Within these exhibitions, the work produced by the female members of the Bauhaus is presented and celebrated. The latest of these shows was devoted to Gertrud Arndt. The exhibition features work from her days as a textile student at the Bauhaus, but also includes the photographic experiments she began at the Bauhaus and continued in her later career. Other female artists that have been featured in the exhibition include fellow textile designer, Benita Koch-Otte, as well as theatre designer, Lou Scheper. The Bauhaus Archive plans to continue with the series and present more shows in the future. Recent academic interest and publications In recent years, more attention has been given to the women of the Bauhaus, as academics have continued to recognize their contributions to the visual arts and visual culture. Major newspapers, like The Guardian and The New York Times, have recently published articles concerning the controversies of the Bauhaus, with particular critique of its reputation as an institution that promoted gender equality. Phaidon Press recently released an article which praised the female pioneers of the Bauhaus and included photographs taken by Gertrud Arndt. In 2009, Ulrike M√ºller published the book, Bauhaus Women: Art, Handcraft, Design, which coincided with the Bauhaus exhibition that was occurring at The Museum of Modern Art. M√ºller's book celebrates twenty female members of the Bauhaus, and discusses their lives, works and legacies within the Bauhaus, as well as within the greater context of art history.

House of Representatives  In 2015 Scott is reported to have cut wires which were part of the fire-suppression system in her office. Scott believed at the time that the wires were in fact listening devices planted to spy on her. The wire-cutting incident was witnessed by other Idaho House members. In August 2017, Scott defended white nationalism on her Facebook page. She reportedly said, \\"The way the media has set this up, the mention of white nationalist, which is no more than a Caucasian who (sic) for the Constitution and making America great again, and confusing it with term, 'white supremacist' which is extreme racism. Therefore, if one is 'guilty' of being white, one is clearly racist.\\" At the start of the 2017 legislative session, Scott reportedly made a remark to fellow state representative Judy Boyle, upon learning of her appointment to the state legislature's agriculture committee. The reported comment was that female lawmakers obtain ranking committee appointments and other leadership positions only if they \\"spread their legs.\\" The alleged comment received widespread rebuke from other state lawmakers. In the 2019 legislative session, Scott sponsored a bill that would have required Idaho's Child Protective Services to mirandize parents before assessing them or their children. After passing the House, the bill was held in committee in the Senate. Scott received consistently high ratings for her voting record in the legislature from the Idaho Freedom Foundation, whose stated purpose is the advancement of conservative principles, limited government, free markets and self-reliance. In 2019, it was reported that Scott was a member of the Coalition of Western States (COWS), a group founded by Washington state representative Matt Shea that has been accused of involvement in domestic terrorism.https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2019/dec/19/rep-matt-shea-engaged- in-domestic-terrorism-during/ In 2020, she dismissed the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, claiming the virus was trying to kill the U.S. Constitutionhttps://www.spokesman.com/stories/2020/apr/03/heather-scott-north- idaho-leaders-push-back-agains/ and \\"The lying, Trump-hating media who continues to push global and socialist agendas has told us that there is an emergency.\\"https://www.npr.org/2020/04/13/832961674/in-idaho-far-right- republicans-defy-coronavirus-health-restrictions By then, the pandemic had killed at least 118,000 people worldwide and at least 23,000 people in the United States.https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus#covid-19-deaths-by- country She also argued that stay-at-home measures meant to combat the pandemic were \\"no different\\" than when Nazi Germany sent Jews to extermination camps, earning a rebuke from the Anti-Defamation League.https://twitter.com/JGreenblattADL/status/1251978801938120704 Elections In 2018, Scott defeated Mike Boeck in the Republican primary.

The Lands Commissioners, who constitute the Commission, have functions relating to land in Scotland, so that they address issues which relate to ownership of land, land rights, management of land, and use of land. The Tenant Farming Commissioner has the aim of improving the relationship between tenant farmers and land owners, and can create codes of practice, provide practical guidance, and must consult on such matters. The Tenant Farming Commissioner cannot be an agricultural landlord or agricultural tenant, and will develop codes of practice which are in addition to the law and the jurisdiction of the Scottish Land Court. The Scottish Land Commission is a body concerned with looking at the concentration of land ownership, land taxation, and effective use of land for the common good. The Commission will also provide some scrutiny of those laws and policies that relate to land within Scotland. History In 2013 Richard Lochhead , then Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment, announced the launch of the Agricultural Holdings Review, which would examine the situation of land ownership and use, tenant-owner relationships, and all of the relevant legislation. The Review published its final report in January 2015, and the recommendations were put out to consultation. In the final report Richard Lochead noted the importance of the relationships between landowners and tenants for the future of agriculture in Scotland, stating, Following the responses to the consultation the Scottish Government presented the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill to the Scottish Parliament on 22 June 2015. The Bill was passed by the Scottish Parliament on 16 March 2016, and received Royal Assent on 22 March 2016 becoming Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2016. The Land Reform (Scotland) Bill was criticised during its passage by the Delegated Powers and Law Reform Committee of the Scottish Parliament on the basis that it granted a significant power to Scottish Minister to implement much of the details of the Act through secondary legislation and delegated powers. Turcan Connell identified concerns around the implementation of the Act and the amount of scrutiny the detailed law would receive. On 1 March 2016 concerns were also raised by Scottish Land and Estates about the passage of the Land Reform Bill, the body that represents Scotland's rural landowners, who felt that the good that landowners did was ignored in favour of \\"being radical\\". Scottish Land and Estates, further asserted that how land is used is as important as who owns that land. Aileen McLeod , as Minister for Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform addressed the members of Scottish Land and Estates, who recognised the expertise of land owners in managing land, affirming that the intention is bring about balance in the tenant/land owner relationship, and to ensure everyone who has stake in land ownership and management is involved. She stated the Bill was about spreading good practice around Scotland, Libby Brooks, writing in The Guardian newspaper on 17 March 2016, reported dissatisfaction with the new law from the Scottish Green Party for not being radical enough. Andy Wightman , land reform spokesperson for the Scottish Green Party, was disappointed that the Land Reform (Scotland) Act did not outlaw the ownership of Scottish land by offshore companies in tax havens. Brooks also reported dissatisfaction that the Act does not restrict the amount of land that can be owned by any one individual. The Commission was established by the Scottish Government on 1 April 2017 by The Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2016 (Commencement No. 4, Transitional and Saving Provisions) Regulations 2016 made under the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2016. Headquarters It is headquartered at Longman House in Inverness. There is a staff of around twenty: five Land Commissioners, the Tenant Farming Commissioner and support staff. The interim chief executive officer was announced as Hilary Pearce, a civil servant in the Scottish government seconded to the post. Commissioners =Nomination= The first commissioners were proposed in November 2016: Andrew Thin, Professor David Adams, Lorne MacLeod, Sally Reynolds, Megan MacInnes and Bob McIntosh as the Tenant Farming Commissioner. The nominated Commissioners were considered by the Environment, Climate Change, and Land Reform Committee of Scottish Parliament, which reported on 8 December 2016, recommending that the Scottish Parliament approve the appointment of the Commissioners. Nonetheless, the Committee did recommend that Bob McIntosh, proposed Tenant Farming Commissioner, should resign from membership of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors to maintain the perception of impartiality; the Committee believed McIntosh was in good a position for building relationships with both landowners and tenants. The Committee also recommended that Lorne MacLeod stand down as Chairman of Community Land Scotland and as a director of community owned land on Eriskay, and asked the Scottish Government to provide a date for when appointments to the Commission would be regulated by the Commissioner for Ethical Standards in Public Life in Scotland. The Report of the Environment, Climate Change, and Land Reform Committee was noted by the Scottish Parliament on 13 December 2016, and approved the appointment of the Land Commissioners (including the Tenant Farming Commissioner). =Chairman= The first chairman, Andrew Thin, was previously the Scottish Government's Independent Advisor on Tenant Farming, and was involved in the establishment of the Cairngorms National Park Authority and had previously worked for Scottish Natural Heritage. =Tenant Farming Commissioner= The Tenant Farming Commissioner cannot be an agricultural landlord or agricultural tenant, and will develop codes of practice which are in addition to the law and the jurisdiction of the Scottish Land Court. The Tenant Farming Commissioner has the power to investigate breaches of the codes of practice. As reported in The Herald newspaper on 11 August 2016, Christopher Nicholson of the Scottish Tenant Farming Association stated that the creation of a Tenant Farming Commissioner had the support of both landowners and tenants. The Agriculture Holdings Review had identified examples of dysfunctional relationships between landlords and tenants, with Bob McIntosh stating, The Press and Journal newspaper, reported on 8 April 2017 that Bob McIntosh, the first Tenant Farming Commissioner, was hoping that the Codes of Practice he would develop would help tenants and landowners to resolve disputes without recourse to the Scottish Land Court. He stated that he would be able to investigate instances where a landlord or tenant had not complied with the Codes of Practice, following the lodging of a formal complaint.

It premiered on Adult Swim on March 17, 2014. The episode was written by Tom Kauffman and Justin Roiland, and directed by Bryan Newton. In the episode, Rick and Morty watch cable from other dimensions, while Jerry, Beth, and Summer watch alternate reality versions of themselves using a pair of interdimensional goggles. The episode was well received and watched by about 1.48 million viewers in the United States. Plot Rick expresses his disgust for the quality of modern television, and replaces the Smith family's normal cable box with a device that allows them to watch shows from infinite realities. Rick flips through the channels to show the endless possibilities, including a reality where Jerry is a famous actor. Jerry, Beth and Summer, excited, beg Rick to show them their alternate lives. He pulls out a pair of Inter-Dimensional Goggles that will allow them to see through the eyes of their alternate selves. Morty stays with Rick and the two continue to watch various commercials and clips from alternate realities. Jerry, Beth and Summer take turns using the goggles. Jerry's alternate self lives a life of drugs and debauchery, while Beth sees herself operating on a person instead of a horse. Summer, however, finds that all realities in which she exists are largely unchanged. Jerry and Beth confess to Summer that she was an unwanted pregnancy, and that her birth prevented them from achieving their goals. This greatly upsets Summer, and she announces her plans to run away. While Summer begins to pack her bags, Morty attempts to console her. He shows Summer the graves that he and Rick dug in their backyard in the episode \\"Rick Potion No. 9\\", confessing that the Morty from her reality is dead, and he is her brother from another reality. He then concludes by saying \\"Nobody exists on purpose, nobody belongs anywhere, everybody's gonna die... Come watch TV?\\" Summer agrees to stay, and the two of them go back downstairs to watch TV with Rick. Jerry returns to the living room and tells Morty that he and Beth have decided to spend some time apart. The television suddenly shows the alternate reality Jerry having a nervous breakdown, driving a mobility scooter on a freeway while pursued by police. They watch as alternate Jerry arrives at the doorstep of alternate Beth, telling her that he hates his life and regrets not continuing their relationship. Having seen how important their relationship is to each other, Beth and Jerry rush back into each other's arms. In the post- credit sequence, the Smith family is watching the news from a \\"Hamster-in-Butt World\\". They ask Rick a wide variety of questions about the world until he begrudgingly creates a portal to it so they can find the answers for themselves. The family then spends a pleasant vacation in Hamster-In-Butt World.  Reception  \\"Rixty Minutes\\" has received high praise since its release, and it has since been referred to as one of the best episodes of the entire series. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode an 8.8 out of 10, saying, \\"It's been a while since an animated series truly entertained like this one has - not sacrificing humor for strangeness, but integrating them together perfectly.\\" Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A, and says \\"In case my review did not make it clear, this episode pretty much blew me away.\\" Stacy Taylor of Geek Syndicate gave the episode a 5/5, and said that \\"‚ÄòRixty Minutes‚Äô is, without a shadow of a doubt, as close to a perfect 20 minutes of television as I think we may ever get.\\" Den of Geek gave the episode a 3.5/5, with Joe Matar saying much of the episode \\"is effectively the same kind of stuff, turning a lot of the episode into a weird sketch show.

She is known for her studies on the relationship between indoor pollution, dietary factors, and lung cancer in China. These studies included some examining the link between passive smoking and lung cancer, and which found no association between the two. She has been criticized for her ties to the tobacco industry, which attempted to recruit her as a consultant because she had said she thought that lung cancer was mainly caused by dietary factors. Her critics have also argued that she has acted as a consultant to the tobacco industry, which often cited her research on confounding factors to argue that passive smoking might not cause lung cancer. In a confidential 1989 industry memo, Covington & Burling lawyer John Rupp wrote that \\"‚Äò‚Äòwe have reestablished a productive ongoing working relationship with Dr. Linda Koo, who is the single most prominent ETS scientist in all of Asia. Although Dr. Koo...cannot afford formally to join our group, the ability we have developed to consult with her should pay substantial dividends.\\" Both Koo and the tobacco industry have responded that she has never acted as a paid tobacco industry consultant. In 1992, Koo's University of Hong Kong colleague Lam Tai-hing was found guilty of plagiarizing Koo's questionnaire, which she had devised with her colleague John Ho to study lung cancer among nonsmoking Chinese women. This guilty verdict was upheld by the Court of Appeal the following year, whereupon the University subsequently announced that Tai-Hing would be investigated by a university committee. In 1995, this committee found Tai-Hing not guilty of \\"disgraceful or dishonorable\\" conduct, a decision which Koo and Ho appealed to a judicial review later that year. On October 24, 1995, the university rejected Koo and Ho's appeal.

William Cassady Cattell D.D., LL.D (August 30, 1827 ‚Äì February 11, 1898) was a Presbyterian divine and educator of the United States, serving as the 7th president of Lafayette College. Early life Cattell was born in Salem, New Jersey in 1827 to Thomas and Keziah Cattell, a merchant and banker respectively. He had five brothers and two sisters, one of his brothers, Alexander G. Cattell, later served as a New Jersey state senator. Cattell started his schooling in his native town of Salem before studying for two years in Virginia under the care of his older brother, Thomas (who would later become a professor at Lincoln University). He returned to New Jersey, attending The College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), graduating with high honors in 1848. He returned to Princeton the following year to attend the Princeton Theological Seminary where he graduated in 1852. Following his graduation he spent an extra year at the seminary to take further part in Oriental Studies under professor Joseph Addison Alexander. Career Cattell's first job was as the associate principal at the Edgehill Preparatory School located in Princeton, New Jersey. He stayed there for two years before accepting a position teaching Latin and Greek at nearby Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania. Here, Cattell taught for five years before resigning to become a pastor at the Pine Street Presbyterian Church in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. =Lafayette College= With the onset of the American Civil War, Lafayette College saw a drastic reduction in its student population, and therefore struggled financially to stay afloat. In 1863, nearing bankruptcy, the college's board of trustees reached out to Cattell, then practicing in Harrisburg, asking him to return to the school in an effort to save it from economic ruin. Cattell accepted the call later that year and was officially inaugurated as the college's seventh president in July, 1864. Cattell's main role as president was to secure an endowment and find monies to keep the college solvent. In 1864, less than a year after his inauguration, Cattell secured a $20,000 gift (equivalent to $ in dollars), from coal magnate Ario Pardee, which lead the charge for more donations to bring the college's assets from $40,000 to almost $900,000. Cattell later took a sabbatical with Pardee's son, Ario Pardee Jr. in Europe to learn the practices of their institutions and bring back some of their knowledge to implement at Lafayette. During his time as president, Cattell also taught courses in Mental and Moral Philosophy, and instituted a series of courses centered around the Bible. He also took on responsibility for the campus's literary and social clubs, as well as its religious obligations. These extra tasks, alongside the presidency, took a toll on Cattell, who retired in 1883 having served as the president for twenty years. =Retirement= During Cattell's retirement, he continued to travel to Europe, familiarizing himself with the Presbyterian Church in Europe. In 1884 he became the Secretary of the Board of Ministerial Relief of the Presbyterian Church, which led him to travel the country raising money for widows, orphans, and other suffering individuals. In his time on this board he helped raise over three million dollars. Personal life Cattell married Elizabeth McKeen, the daughter of Lafayette College board of trustees member James McKeen. Together they had two sons, Henry Ware Cattell, and James McKeen Cattell, the first professor of psychology and the University of Pennsylvania, and later a professor at Columbia University. In 1864, Cattell received the honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity from both Hanover College and Princeton University. In 1878 he received the honorary degree of Legum Doctor from Wooster University. He was also made a director of the Princeton Theological Seminary in 1864, and the president of the Presbyterian History Society in 1890. Cattell Street, located in Easton, Pennsylvania, was named after him as well. Cattell died on February 11, 1898, due to complications stemming from his heart conditions.

He befriends the warden who helps him secure the sub inspector job. Sathya remembers what his warden taught him and stays honest in his profession. Unlike the other policemen at his station, he refuses to be involved in bribes and is made an outcast. One day, Sathya helps a writer who is beaten by his corrupt inspector, Gunasekaran. Thinking that Sathya is trying to become a hero by making him look bad, the inspector plans to shame Sathya. The inspector then arranges for Sathya to shadow a dangerous gangster. While shadowing the gangster, he loses his gun fully loaded with 8 bullets. The inspector gives him one day to find his lost gun or face disciplinary action. With the help of a reporter friend, Meera, Sathya nabs the boy who pickpocketed his gun but the boy has sold the gun. The guy who bought the gun attempts a robbery and in the process he accidentally shoots and kills a little girl. Meera, in danger of losing her job tells her superiors about the case, it goes viral, and Sathya is suspended from duty. Sathya hides from police as he will be arrested, and is tracked down by Pandian, the new handler of the case, Pandian says that if Sathya was a real policeman he should never stop searching, which causes Sathya to join him. Meanwhile, one of the robbers tries to buy his girlfriend a necklace for her birthday and takes all the fresh notes available, despite the boss's opposition. In the jewelry shop, he is exposed as the police kept track of the serial number of the fresh notes. He escapes the arrest and goes to get his share. After a confrontation with the boss he tries to steal all the money and the leader shoots and kills him. The remaining two dispose the body. The second robber fearing he also will be shot dead by the boss, contacts police. When the police attempt to arrest the boss with a ploy the boss shoots and kills the second robber and made sure there is no one left to connect him with the robber. Sathya meets an old police man, Krishnamurthy, who got suspended for letting a terrorist slip away as a constable. It turns out that Gunasekaran accepted a bribe from the terrorist and let her go, but this has already ruined Murthys profession. Sathya talks to Murthy about life and how things have changed. After this, Murthy sees the man who sold him the gun and leaves. Murthy kills him with the same gun when he follows Murthy to a restroom. However we learn that Murthy is actually the leader of the robbery and he kills the officer who didn't sanction his Provident Fund. Sathya, now looking for clues in the murder, finds Murthy's application sanctioned and goes to his house to give it to him. However, Murthy's son tells him that the application got sanctioned earlier and Murthy gave the money to the family, by connecting the murder of the guy who sold the gun and Murthy's son's statement he figures out that Murthy is the robber and the boss. Meanwhile, Murthy follows Gunasekaran to a bank and attempts another robbery and kills him, after which he throws the money on the street. When Murthy returns home he finds out that the police have surrounded him. Pandian takes Murthy's grandson hostage and there is a confrontation in which Sathya walks out with his gun . He later tells the investigation board that Murthy shot Pandian dead and Sathya had killed Murthy in self-defense. Sathya is given his job back. As Sathya drives with Meera, she tells him that he should not feel bad for Murthy, as he was a bad person. And we are shown what actually happens in that room. Pandian with his gun on Murthy's grandsons head slips, and a shot is fired. Murthy in shock, shoots and kills Pandian, but it turns out that Pandian missed and did not hit Murthy's grandson. Sathya grabs Murthy and fights him, but cannot hurt him as he feels sorry for him. Murthy stands up and grabs the gun and tells Sathya to shoot him. He then explains that he did not tell his family about his cancer because he heard the family speaking why god didn't take him instead of his wife. He then says he robbed the bank for them and that he wanted to live his last days as a king. Murthy also says he did not mean to shoot the child and breaks down. Murthy grabs Sathya's hands, puts the gun to his forehead and says he doesn't want to put the family in shame by going to prison then shoots himself dead with the last bullet when Sathya hesitates. After this flashback, at a stop light, Sathya sees the employer that framed him, on the side of the street, and the movie ends.  Cast  * Vetri as Sathya * Aparna Balamurali as Meera Vasudevan * M. S.

Ganesh attributed parts of the film to real-life incidents and literature, citing he was interested by the mystery series of Inspector Martin Beck. For the film, he also spent time speaking to the cop who was part of the 2012 Velachery encounters, where five men suspected of robbing banks in the city were shot dead, with Nassar's character in his story being partly based on this policeman.http://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/director-sai-ganesh-on- making-8-thottakal/article17843611.ece The production began in August 2016 and ended in November 2016, with the film shot almost entirely in Chennai, over a period of 47 days.http://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/kollywood/040816/8-thottakkal- a-crime-thriller-in-the-house.html Newcomer Vettri was selected to play the lead role of a sub-inspector in the film, with his family producing the film.http://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/kollywood/030417/a-promising- entrant-in-ktown.html Actress Aparna Balamurali was signed on as the lead actress soon after the release of her debut Malayalam film Maheshinte Prathikaaram (2016), and revealed that she would play the character of a scribe.http://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/malayalam/2017/apr/04/aparna- balamurali-is-a-scribe-in-her-tamil-debut-1589873.html Actress Meera Mithun also worked on the film, which became he first film release.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movies/news/Model- Meera-Mitun-plays-one-of-the-leads-in-8-Thottakal/articleshow/53682311.cms Other members of the cast included Nassar and M.

The reviewer added that \\"8 Thottakkal has plenty of positive aspects to discuss but two things have certainly reduced the quality of the film, one is the wooden hero who just can't act and the other one is unnecessary song sequences, which comes as speed-breakers\\", while stating \\"another issue is the length of the film is a bit of a downer as the long drawn out scene composition tests your patience ‚Äî but despite these flaws, the film is worth a look and hits the target with the heart touching performance of MS Baskar, who has given his career best\\".http://www.sify.com/movies/8-thottakal-review-a-satisfying-watch-review --reft5Caibbcga.html A reviewer from The Times of India noted \\"Taking the set- up of Akira Kurosawa's Stray Dog, Sri Ganesh gives us a slow-burning cop thriller which changes track halfway and becomes a contemplation on life. It is a risky move because the film starts to empathise more with its antagonist and wants us to do the same as well, but surprisingly, Sri Ganesh manages this feat\\". The critic added \\"the director gives us songs that break the mood and momentum of the film\\" and that \\"you really are baffled that a director who displays such confidence in letting his film unfurl at a meditative pace would settle for such compromises\\".http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/tamil/movie- reviews/8-thotakkal/movie-review/58041421.cms A vapid film with a sleepwalking hero cannot recreate the magic of Stray Dog- Kollywood Kapsa.

Most of the women ≈†leziƒá met during her time in Afghanistan had encountered a basic lack of freedom. ≈†leziƒá felt very na√Øve at her assumption that this problem had been dramatically improved, and set out to inform others of the reality of the situation.Glauser, Wendy. \\"Forsaken.\\" This Magazine, November‚ÄìDecember 2007. p55 ≈†leziƒá's work calls for global attention to ideas of patriarchy, freedom, and control within Afghanistan. = Forsaken: Afghan Women = ≈†leziƒá created a photo book entitled, Forsaken: Afghan Women, that was curated from thousands of photos that she took during her time in Afghanistan. Forsaken has been published in five countries. It is a compilation of 60 images of women who have been negatively impacted by Afghanistan's social and political state. The photos in Forsaken are interspersed with texts about the oppression that these women face.James, Geoffrey. \\"Seduced and Forsaken.\\" The Globe and Mail, November 03, 2007. https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/seduced-and- forsaken/article726075/. The images and text in Forsaken are emotional and powerful. To take these photos, ≈†leziƒá shot in colour and used a Nikon D100 and a Nikon D2X. ≈†leziƒá was accompanied by a translator and was able to unobtrusively speak with, and photograph, the women she encountered.Bourrier- La Croix, Barbara. \\"Forsaken\\". Network, Spring-Summer 2008. p. 36. She was warmly welcomed by the Afghan women she met. They enjoyed having their photos taken and being able to share their stories with other women. Through Forsaken, ≈†leziƒá attempts to reveal the shocking truth that Afghanistan is very far from being free of patriarchal oppression. The disparity between the media's presentation of Afghanistan and the reality of daily life motivated ≈†leziƒá to create Forsaken. ≈†leziƒá aims to convey that conditions for Afghan women have not drastically improved, and these women need help. She intends to create an honest and explicit depiction of these conditions. Within Forsaken, ≈†leziƒá highlights the stories of women who lit themselves on fire to escape their devastating situations. This is not an uncommon occurrence, and demonstrates the desperation that these women feel as well as their desire to be free. The images displayed in Forsaken are an artful depiction of defiant femininity within an oppressive and devastating war zone. ≈†leziƒá does not believe the conditions for Afghan women will change soon, but calls for attention to this issue through Forsaken. = The Voice = In 2015, ≈†leziƒá created a short documentary entitled, \\"The Voice\\".Off, Carol and Jeff Douglas. \\"New Documentary Maps Andy Barrie‚Äôs Life with Parkinson‚Äôs.\\" CBC Radio, April 15, 2015. http://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-wednesday- edition-1.3034412/new-documentary-maps-andy-barrie-s-life-with- parkinson-s-1.3034512.

Barrie underwent this treatment for two and a half years. It is only successful in 20 percent of people, and fortunately was successful for Barrie. ≈†leziƒá documented Barrie's improvement with this treatment and noted that the difference she saw was incredible. Creating this film was both a professional and personal experience for ≈†leziƒá. She notes that it was difficult to separate her emotions from the filmmaking process, but ultimately she had to put emotions aside and continue filming.  Exhibitions  ≈†leziƒá's photography has been shown internationally in Croatia, Turkey, North America, and Europe. Below is a selection of ≈†leziƒá's documented exhibitions. * Perception, Toronto, Ontario 2006 * Afghan Women \\"Never Conquered,\\" Montr√©al, Qu√©bec 2005 * Time Stands Still, Toronto, Ontario 2004 * Kites, Guns and Dreams Exhibition, Vancouver, British Columbia 2004 * Landmine Victims, Toronto, Ontario 2003 * Homeless, Toronto, Ontario 2002 * Mennonites, Toronto, Ontario 2001  Feminism  ≈†leziƒá's work related to feminism because it aims to enlighten outsiders of the oppression that certain populations, particularly Afghan women, face. Through her work, ≈†leziƒá aims to educate individuals about the devastation and injustices of a war-torn country such as Afghanistan. Her work recognizes the pain that others face, and calls attention to this issue. ≈†leziƒá's primary goal is to educate people and spread the truth about this injustice. This is because the oppressive conditions Afghan women endure creates a much larger issue than it is widely believed to be and it has not considerably improved. ≈†leziƒá advocates for the liberty of Afghan women, noting that their oppression is rooted in tradition and religion. She intends to bring awareness to this issue, and calls for action through her work. She creates a discourse noting that Afghan women are extremely knowledgeable about their oppressive situations, but they need help to be liberated from oppression. ≈†leziƒá places an emphasis on revealing that Afghan women feel angry and defiant in their current situation, rather than hopeless. She aims to point out the lack of freedom and control that Afghan women have. They need help, but do not need to be saved, and ≈†leziƒá aims to bring attention to this. She provides oppressed Afghan women with a voice and calls for liberty for these women. Awards and recognition In 2005, ≈†leziƒá came in first place in the Photojournalism and Photo Essay category at the National Magazine Awards.

The club was founded in 1915 as Puebla FC, by mostly Mexican natives and the Spaniard community. The club was one of the most successful of the amateur era in Puebla. The club would dissolve in the early 1940s when it merged with Asturias de Puebla, a few years before professional football was established in Mexico. History would have it that the club would return and form part of Puebla F.C., the same name the club was founded with in 1915. History Puebla FC in 1915 . The club was founded in 1915 under the name Puebla FC just 8 years after Puebla A.C., the first football club in the state, dissolved in 1907. To the contrary of Puebla A.C., Puebla FC was founded by the Mexican Spanish community of the city of Puebla. In 1916 the club changed its name to Espana De Puebla aster the clubs associated itself with Real Club Espa√±a of Mexico City. During its first years of existence the club struggled to find opponents in the state of Puebla, finding few in San Martin, which forced the club to travel east to the state of Veracruz where football was more developed. In Orizaba, Veracruz, a town in Mexico where football clubs rivaled in experience and numbers to the ones in the capital, the club had its first real matches against experienced clubs such as Uni√≥n Deportiva R√≠o Blanco and Club Cervantes. =First rivalry= The club's first rivalry was born in 1918 when Club Reforma de Puebla was founded by French Mexican Enrique Lederman. This became strong during its first years, being that both clubs shared the Estadio Velodromo. The rivalry came to an en in 1921 when Club Reforma folded due to economic problems. From this two more clubs were born ‚Äì Club Universal and Club Mexico, who were no real rivals to Espana. =Golden years= 1926 Copa Gallegos Champion. After its main rival club Reforma disappeared in 1921, the club felt the effect and had three years of mediocre play. It was in 1925 when Laureno R Alvarez took over the presidency of the club which lifted the club back up. During these years the club started traveling to states like Veracruz, Mexico City, and Hidalgo to play against top-tier opposition such as Club America, C.F. Aurrer√°, Germania F.V., C.F. Pachuca, and Albinegros de Orizaba ‚Äì clubs who played in the semi professional Primera Fuerza league. In 1926 the club managed to win the Copa Excelsior which they won for a second time in 1928. In 1927 the club won the Copa Gallegos against Club Pachuca (the cup was donated by a wealthy man of the city pf Pachuca). The club's success was noticed in Mexico City in particular; Real Club Espa√±a would buy some of the club's players. One of the most successful players and a fan favorite was Joaqu√≠n Colubi Rodr√≠guez. In 1930 Antonio Guerra took over in a time where the club was just about to start the biggest rivalry in its history. =Dissolution and fusion= By the early 1940s the club was still in a heated competition against arch rival Club Asturias, with Asturias winning the league in 1939 for the second consecutive year. This all came to an abrupt end in 1942/1943 when the club was forced to join forces with Club Asturias, in most part due to economic problems. Club Asturias had a better economic force backing the club with its owner Manuel Hill. The fusion did not last long, being that in Mexico City and around the country club owners and donors were already in plans to form a professional football league in Mexico, which came to be in 1943. During this time former presidents, donors, ex-players of both Club Espana and Club Asturias joined forces and brought to life the new club Puebla F.C., which they both rallied around.

He taught school at a single-room schoolhouse in Columbia County, New York. Biography Jesse Merwin, a 19th-century schoolmaster in Kinderhook, New York, was described in a well-known longhand script letter by President Martin Van Buren as the \\"pattern\\" for author Washington Irving's character of Ichabod Crane in his story The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.‚ÄúYankee Visits Sleepy Hollow‚Äù, Yankee Magazine July 1953 p. 32, 33, 40, 41. According to a notation by Irving and a certification written in longhand by Martin Van Buren‚Äîwho was friends with both the author and the schoolteacher‚Äîthe 'pattern' (Van Buren's words) for the character of Ichabod Crane was based on a Kinderhook schoolmaster named Jesse Merwin, whom Irving became friends with in Kinderhook, New York, in 1809. The two friends continued a pen-pal correspondence for thirty years. The Columbia County Historical Society (New York) owns the original Kinderhook Schoolhouse named after the Irving character based on Jesse Merwin, the town's first schoolteacher.‚ÄúOriginal of Washington Irving‚Äôs Characters‚Äù, Four-Track News, July 1906, p. 429, vol. 1. The Kinderhook town school district (Ichabod Crane Central School District) is also named for the Irving character. Because a member of the Van Tassel family was a lieutenant alongside another man in Tarrytown, Samuel Youngs, according to an 1894 article in The New York Times, \\"it [was] claimed by many in that town (Tarrytown) that Samuel Youngs was the original from whom Irving drew his character of Ichabod Crane\\". Author Gary Denis asserts that while the character of Ichabod Crane is loosely based on Kinderhook Schoolmaster, Jesse Merwin, it may possibly... include elements from Samuel Youngs' life. Stanley Thomas Williams, Professor of English at Yale University, an early Irving biographer best known for his interpretation of Herman Melville as well as his two-volume biography on Irving, also refers to Martin Van Buren's certificate, stating in his two-volume work on Irving, \\"...Ichabod Crane, Irving drew from the schoolmaster whom he knew in 1809.\\" Early years By 1809 Merwin was teaching at a District School in Kinderhook, where he boarded at the home of Judge William Peter Van Ness. There he met another boarder, a twenty-six year old tutor and aspiring author named Washington Irving. Irving and Merwin went fishing and hunting together during that period and became lifelong friends. Personal life Merwin married Jane Van Dyke, the daughter of a wealthy Kinderhook farmer in 1808, and together they had eight sons and three daughters. In 1834, Merwin named one of his sons Washington Irving Merwin after his friend the author. Merwin died in Kinderhook on November 8, 1852.

Their territory corresponds to the barony of Granard in modern county Longford in Ireland.  Etymology Cairpre Gabra is a corruption of and is best translated as ‚Äúthe descendants of Coirpre‚Äù. Coirpre mac N√©ill (Modern ) was eldest son of the Niall of the Nine Hostages the supposed ancestor of the southern U√≠ N√©ill. Tradition claims Coirpre married a Fir Bolg princess named Mulreany and ruled all of North Longford from the Moat of Granard. Coirpre also owned tracts near Lough Erne and the Carbury barony in Sligo. The first U√≠ N√©ill successes in Leinster were probably due to this Coirpre, supposedly a high king of Ireland. √ì Du√≠geann√°in stated Cairbre Gabhra is identical to the ancient place \\"\\" disagreeing with O'Donovan's identification as Carbury (County Kildare barony)\\". Tuath Glasraige & Brecraighi The territory was presumably a frontier colony of the Kingdom of Meath before the seventh century. An ancient folklore called \\"\\" named \\"the ‚Äù as ruling the territory around Granard and Lough Sheelin (\\"\\") but nothing further is known about the tribe. Bracan mac M√°ine M√≥r probably resided at Rathbracken townland to the north of Granard. His descendants, the \\"\\", were defeated by the Cen√©l Coirpri in AD 751. Cairpre Gabra Between the fifth and seventh centuries, a branch of the U√≠ N√©ill called the Cairpre Gabhra ( - descendants of Coirpre mac N√©ill) settled around Granard and Lough Sheelin in North Tethbae (approximately county Longford). Three distinct sub- septs of the Cenel Coirpri listed in the genealogies were powerful circa 700AD, namely the \\"Cairpri Laigin\\", the \\"Cairpri Gabra\\", and \\"Cairpri Dromma Cliab\\" though current thinking now believes \\"Cairpri Laigin\\" was a later construct.Byrne, Francis John \\"Irish kings and High Kings\\" (Dublin : Four Courts, 2001; 2nd ed.), p xvi. (Note to p.84). Furthermore, various related septs under the designations of Cenel Cairpre, Cairpre Mor, and Cairpre Gabra, figure in the annals of Ulster from the seventh, eighth, and ninth century. Cairpre Gabra is first mentioned in the Irish Annals for the year AD731. It is generally believed a larger Cairpre grouping stretched from Sligo to Longford at an early date taking in Leitrim and parts of Fermanagh (Tuatha Ratha or Magheraboy) and it was divided in two by the expansion of the Kingdom of Breifne under the U√≠ Bri√∫in. Cairpre Gabra lay between the tuaths of Luigne- Gailenga to the east, and Conmaicne Maigh Rein to the north-west. Centred on Granard, Cairpre Gabra lay along the northern border of the ancient Kingdom of Meath, and comprised the barony of Granard, and at least part of the barony of Longford. Cairbre may have extended as far east as C√∫l (Coole) in county Westmeath). The north-western frontier ran from Cluain Cusa (Clooncoose) through Crott (between Slieve Carbry and Lake Naback) over as far as Lough Gowna, but excluded the most northern portion of the modern barony of Granard. The Cairpre territory was probably of limited extent by the 8th century. The principal churches were at Granard and Clonbroney, supposedly given to Saint Patrick when he visited \\"Coirpre\\" and instructed Guasacht mac Milchu to found a church at Granard, and two sisters, Emers, to found a church at Cluain Br√≥naigh (ClonBroney). Cairbre Gabra was therefore among the first Christianity centres in Ireland. Cairpre Gabra was not a strong tuath and in the 11th century the O'Cairbres were conquered by the √ì Cuinns, √ì Fearghails, and other Conmha√≠cne tribes. Caipre Gabra was absorbed into the larger Annaly kingdom, so named after \\"\\" the great-grandfather of Fearghail O'Farrell. Annaly became Longphoirt, now Longford, after O'Farrell's fortress of this name. It is believed a section of the dynasty were introduced as lords of Carbury in Kildare in a 12th-century intrusion following this pressure on their original territory in north-east Longford.Byrne, Francis John \\"Irish kings and High Kings\\" (Dublin : Four Courts, 2001; 2nd ed.), p xvi. (Note to p.84). √ì Ciardha (O'Keary or O'Carey) were established as lords of Carbury from this group about the time of the Norman invasion of Ireland. Events Dobbs (1938, 1941) summarizes many events connected to the ancient Granard (barony) and Cairbre Gabra as follows- * A Prehistoric Battle of Cluain Cuas (Clooncose) was won by Tigernmas. * AD 236 Cormac mac Airt defeated the Ulstermen at Granard. * AD 581 Aed mac Brenann mac Briun mac M√°ine M√≥r, king of Tethba, helped Saint Columcille and the northern U√≠ Neill decisively defeat the Meath U√≠ Neill at the battle of C√∫l Uinnsin, at the south end of Lough Gowna in Coirpre Gabra. The Geas on the Kings of Tara \\"\\" might originate from this defeat. * AD 751 The \\"\\" descendants of Eogan mac Bracan mac M√°ine M√≥r and \\"kings of the Brecraighi\\" were annihilated by the Cen√©l Coirpri at \\"Kilfintan\\" (5 km south of Granard). * AD 927 Ua Ruairc raided Cairbre and Taebata killing Ua Ciarrdha, the lord of Cairbre Gabhra. * AD 983 Brian Boru raided the western Kingdom of Meath and likely attacked Cairbre Gabra. * AD 992 Maelruanaidh Ua Ciardha, king of Cairbre, was killed by the men of Tethba. * AD 1012 Cairbre Gabhra were involved in a raid on the Gailenga in Cavan and the Kingdom of Meath. Pursued home, Ualgharg Ua Ciardha, lord of Cairbre, and many others were killed. * AD 1046 Ua Ciardha, lord of Cairbre Gabhra, was killed by the lord of Tethba (Ua Flannagain of Comar). * AD 1066 Many of the Cairbre Gabhra were slaughtered probably in revenge for plundering Scrin Choluimchille (Skreen in County Meath). * AD 1069 Cairpre Gabhra and the church of Granard were burnt by the lord of Fine-gall, possibly in revenge for the burnings of Lusk and Swords churches the previous year. * AD 1070 The men of Tethba were defeated by Ua Ruairc of Breifne. * AD 1184 Cairpre Gabra disappear as an individual principality following the Norman invasion.

The band consists of Edie Brickell, drummer Steve Gadd, guitarist Andy Fairweather Low and bass player Pino Palladino.  Development  The group built on a foundation of demo sessions performed by Brickell and Gadd in 2000. When they continued with further sessions, they recruited Fairweather Low and Palladino. The musicians developed a groove, but due to conflicting touring schedules and family commitments, they shelved the project at the time. When the four musicians got back together in 2010, they used several of the songs they composed during the previous decade, and others they wrote and recorded during the current sessions. Brickell wrote some of the songs on the same day they were recorded, on the train ride into New York City. One of the songs, \\"Mad Dog\\", was recorded in one take live, which captured an energy that Brickell feels is missing in songs that take over 15 takes to capture.

History Begg was born in Montrose, Scotland, was apprenticed as ship's carpenter and served as a seaman for several years before around 1840 being put in charge of a cargo boat shipping timber from the Baltic. In 1855 he was appointed captain of the Sebastian (426 tons) on the India route, calling in at Adelaide and Mauritius on the return voyage. His next appointment was as captain of the Orient Line clipper Coonatto trading between England and Adelaide from 1863 to 1866, when he was put in charge of The Murray, on which he served until 1872, making very good voyages, and impressing his passengers with his urbanity and sailor-like qualities, an asset to the reputation and no doubt profitability of the Orient Line. He settled in Adelaide and was made manager of the Tug Company, then was appointed ship's surveyor for Lloyd's of London. In 1877 he and John Legoe had a part in formation of the Port Stevedoring Company, and he served with that company until a few weeks before his death. Recognition Begg was awarded a silver medal by the Italian government for his part in rescuing sailors from a burning vessel. This was the Mannin Barabino, which caught fire while sailing from Genoa to Puerto Rico in May 1870. Begg and the crew of The Murray went to her aid and did what they could to rescue survivors, but 120 perished either in the inferno, the barque's cargo being largely spirits, or in the sea after her overloaded boat capsized. Family Begg was married twice; by his first wife he had three children: *Robert Caithness Begg (c. 1851 ‚Äì 21 September 1922), master of the barque Pakwan 1875‚Äì1878 married Eliza Allsop, youngest daughter of Captain Allsop on 19 November 1873. *Elizabeth Begg ( ‚Äì ) married John Fletcher ( ‚Äì ) on 23 December 1875.
