LERW consists of a random walk, whose loops, which form when it intersects itself, are removed. This was introduced to the study of self-avoiding random walk by Gregory Lawler in 1980, but is an independent model in another universality class. In the two- dimensional case, conformal invariance was proved by Lawler, Oded Schramm and Wendelin Werner (with Schramm-Loewner Evolution, SLE) in 2004. The cases of four and more dimensions were treated by Lawler, the scale limiting value is Brownian motion, in four dimensions. Kozma treated the two-dimensional case in 2002 with a new method.

History  = First Generation = Postcard of the Kindred Hotel in Valley City, North Dakota, with the awning of the Sternberg Clothing Store, operated by Adolph Sternberg in that building from 1882 until his death in 1908. The Straus/Stern family entered the clothing business in North Dakota in 1879 when brothers Adolph and Isaac Sternberg opened a clothing store in Sanborn, North Dakota. In 1882, after Valley City was chosen as the seat of Barnes County, they relocated the business 13 miles away to Valley City, opening a \\"New York One Price Clothing House\\" on the first floor of the new Kindred Hotel. Isaac retired a few years later, and Adolph died in 1908. Meanwhile, Adolph Sternberg's wife Anna encouraged her niece Frederecka (Rickie)'s husband Morris G. Straus to open a clothing business in Casselton, 40 miles away, in 1897. This was also a \\"one-price\\" store, with prices posted for each item. In 1903, M. G. Straus recruited his cousin Herman Stern from Germany to come to Casselton and assist with the running of the Straus clothing store (although he was likely also looking for a suitable bachelor to marry his wife's much younger sister, Adeline Roth). After purchasing the larger Sternberg store in Valley City following Adolph's death in 1908, Straus left Stern in charge of the Casselton store until 1910, when he sent Stern to work in the Valley City store and returned to Casselton. Morris Straus retired to San Diego in 1920, selling Straus Clothing to Stern. = Second Generation = Postcard of the interior of Straus Clothing between 1937 and 1945 Around the time Straus purchased the Valley City store, he recruited another cousin, Leo Straus, to help manage this store. Leo Straus married Adolph and Anna Sternberg's daughter Elsie in 1912, the same year that Herman Stern married Adeline Roth. However, in 1916, Leo Straus left to work in the silk industry in Paterson, New Jersey, selling his interest in Straus Clothing to M. G. Straus and Herman Stern, and making Stern the manager of the Valley City store. (Leo Straus's daughter would marry Joseph Weber; his younger son would marry Kathleen N. Straus) Herman Stern's business prospered in the 1920s. He enlarged the Valley City store in 1926, and opened new stores in Lamoure in 1927 and in Carrington in 1929. However, poor economic conditions during the Great Depression led to the closure of the Lamoure store and the sale of the Carrington store to the Carrington store manager in 1933. The Straus stores sold workers' overalls at a loss and tried adding groceries to the Straus inventory to bring in customers and keep the remaining stores alive. As the depression ebbed, business conditions improved. The Valley City store was completely remodeled in 1937. In 1939, Herman Stern purchased The Esquire Shop in Fargo for $1200, which was managed by his younger son Ed. At the time, the other menswear store in Fargo was the \\"Alex Stern Company,\\" and so Herman and Ed Stern continued to maintain the Straus name to avoid confusion. Ed moved the Fargo store to Broadway in 1941, but then left to serve in the U.S. Army for the next four years. In 1945, Stern purchased the Kindred hotel building which housed the original Valley City store in 1945, and in 1949-50 he had it demolished and replaced by a modern building. The celebration for the new store opening was attended by more than 2,000 people, including the state's governor. This was the first store in North Dakota with air conditioning. = Third Generation = Fire at the Straus store in Fargo, April 14, 1963 Herman's son Edward Stern began work with Straus Clothing as a salesman in 1932. His parents sent him to attend the Wharton School of Business in Philadelphia, but he returned to North Dakota in 1936 to work for Straus Clothing and be near his high school sweetheart, Louise McCutcheon. Ed Stern oversaw a major expansion in the Straus business during the prosperous post- war period. In 1955, Straus purchased the former Havig store in Grand Forks, and opened a location there, with a second Grand Fork's location opening in 1966. In 1957, Straus bought the former Globe store in Fargo, and opened a second Fargo branch in that location. In 1970, Straus bought the former Beck‚Äôs store in Jamestown, opening a branch there. A fire destroyed the downtown Fargo store in 1963 (intentionally set by the manager of the business next door, in an attempt to hide the embezzlement of funds from auditors), but Straus rebuilt and reopened in the same location. Before Fargo's first shopping mall opened in 1972, Straus Clothing was the first to negotiate a contract for a store in that space. In the mid-1970s, the Stern family opened their own multi-level small shopping mall in Valley City, with Straus Clothing as the anchor store. = Fourth Generation = Ed Stern turned over the Straus Clothing business to two of his sons, John and Rick Stern, in the 1980s, although he remained president of the Straus company until 1997. By this time, Straus Clothing was the best-selling men's retailer in the region, with 10 stores. However, the next decade and a half were difficult for independent menswear retailers. Four of the Straus stores were located in downtown shopping districts in North Dakota, which saw less business as shoppers departed for malls. Discount chains, such as Wall-Mart were expanding rapidly, offering unbeatable prices. Meanwhile, men were dressing more casually for work, reducing demand for suits. Straus shifted the mix of menswear offered and reduced prices, but by 1997, only two Straus stores remained open, in Fargo and Jamestown. In late 2015, with none of their children interested in taking over the business, Rick and John Stern announced the closure of Straus Clothing in January, 2016. = Fifth Generation = Straus Clothing did not stay closed for long. A few months later, John Stern's step-son Chad Herring announced plans to re-open the store with his wife Dorene. Chad had worked at the Straus store in Fargo's West Acres mall in his 20s, before leaving the area to work in other businesses. Twenty five years later, he decided that he had really enjoyed working for Straus Clothing, and returned to Fargo to re- open the store, now called \\"Straus for Men\\" in November, 2016. However, Herring announced the closure of the new store in March 2018, citing poor sales.  Tradition of Civic Engagement  For generations, the leaders of Straus Clothing were not only businesspeople, but civic leaders. Adoph Sternberg was a director of the First National Bank, a trustee of the State Normal School at Valley City, which later became Valley City State University, and a Mason. His wife Anna was the first president of the Valley City Tuesday Club, the second oldest women's club in North Dakota, and the force behind the establishment of a Carnegie library in Valley City. Herman Stern was posthumously awarded the North Dakota Rough Rider Award in 2014 for his many contributions to the state. He founded the Greater North Dakota Association in 1924, now known as the Greater North Dakota Chamber, and served as that organization‚Äôs first president. He founded the North Dakota Winter Show, an winter agriculture show that is still in existence. He founded the Community Chest, which became the United Way of Barnes County, and was active in Rotary and the Masonic Order. He was a champion of the Boy Scouts of America, helping to establish boy scout councils in Fargo, Valley City, Wahpeton and Grand Forks, and raising money to build boy scout Camp Wilderness in nearby Minnesota, and was awarded the Silver Buffalo Award in 1974 for his efforts on behalf of the boy scouts. Between about 1934 and 1941, Herman Stern worked tirelessly to rescue more than 140 German Jews from the Holocaust by bringing them to the United States, beginning with members of his own family, and eventually helping more distant relatives, friends, and acquaintances. Edward Stern was a WWII veteran, founder of the Fargo-Moorhead Area Foundation, two- term President of the Fargo school board, leader of the Fargo Chamber of Commerce, and president of the Menswear Retailers of America. He was also a Fargo-Moorhead Symphony Orchestra board member, fundraiser, and violist. He was awarded the North Dakota Governor's Award for the Arts and the Fargo Chamber of Commerce Legacy Award.

She is regarded as one of the most remarkable female religious leaders associated with independent churches in the 1920s.  Life prior to 1918  Nontetha Nkwenkwe was born in 1875 in King William's Town in what is now the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. She was of Xhosa descent, and settled in Khulile village, near Debe Nek, now part of Raymond Mhlaba Local Municipality. She served her community as an herbalist (ixhwele). She had ten children, five of whom lived to adulthood. Her husband, Bungu Nkwenkwe, died while searching for work.Edgar & Sapire (1999), African Apocalypse, pg. 2 She never joined a Christian church, but baptized her children and was influenced by the Ethiopian church of Dwane as well as the American Methodist Episcopal Church.  Prophet  Following the outbreak of the influenza epidemic in 1918 which devastated her area, Nkwenkwe believed that she was spared for a divine purpose. And in undertaking her work as first a seer, then a diviner, and ultimately a prophet, her life was changed dramatically. She began having visions and telling locals that God had told her the epidemic was punishment for people's sins and that her mission was to reform society. She also \\"read\\" messages from God by looking at her hands. At first Nkwenkwe's activities were welcomed by the authorities, unlike some of her contemporary male counterparts like Enoch Mgijima. Authorities welcomed her as they understood her sermons to be encouraging her congregation to abstain from alcohol consumption, immorality, dances, and other traditional customs. Nontetha‚Äôs movement grew rapidly in rural Ciskei, East London, Middledrift and King William's Town. However, in the wake of the Bulhoek massacre where a 183 African Israelites were killed at Bulhoek in 1921, white attitudes to any large-scale black gatherings became increasingly paranoid. Officials reported that farm workers around Fort Beaufort (near Fort Hare) had been ‚Äòenraptured by her message and were reluctant to return to work‚Äô. The government became suspicious of any independent black thinkers. Nkwenkwe's great-grandson Mzimkhulu Bungu believes that some established mission churches, worried about her growing following, had also complained about her activities. Nkwenkwe's sermons also encouraged unity among educated and \\"red\\" Xhosa people, something that was in conflict with the colonial system's divide and conquer mechanism. According to Edgar, R and Sapire, H, she was further accused of ‚Äòencouraging Africans to boycott white churches'. She was now seen as subversive, [was] arrested, and jailed in 1922.  Incarceration  Nkwenkwe continued to preach despite the terms of her release, and she was re-arrested in April 1923. The arrest of Nkwenkwe enraged her supporters. In a show of solidarity, hundreds of her supporters gathered, ready to engage the authorities in the event that she was charged. Mindful of the disorder that could be unleashed by a possible court appearance, the authorities committed Nontetha to Fort Beaufort Mental Hospital. Her followers would walk as far as 80 km to the town to consult with her. In 1924, Nkwenkwe was transferred to the Weskoppies Mental Hospital in Pretoria, the government's prime psychiatric observation institution. After two years of no correspondence about her condition, Nkwenkwe's supporters decided to visit their leader in Pretoria. On November 23 1926, her followers began a 1000 km walk which lasted for 55 days, walking from Eastern Cape to Pretoria. When they met her on January 18 1927, the movement had grown as some people joined them along the way. A second pilgrimage was cut short and the marchers loaded back onto trains after crossing the Orange River at Aliwal North without passes in 1930. Nkwenkwe died on May 20, 1935 of liver and stomach cancer. Her family was notified by telegram, but by the time they were able to respond, she had been buried in an unmarked grave.Edgar & Sapire, pg. 87 Her followers expressed their hope that one day Nontetha's remains would be returned. In 1997, Robert Edgar and Hilary Sapire began to assist in locating Nontetha's grave, and her remains were reburied at her home in Khulile village in 1998.Edgar & Sapire, pg. 105 Legacy Nkwenkwe did not only establish the Church of the Prophetess Nontetha, which has 30,000 members today, but also enhanced the role women held within the church in the 1920s.

Early life and education Butterworth was raised in Manchester and educated at Wright Robinson High School in Gorton and Shena Simon Sixth Form College. He studied Physics at the University of Oxford, gaining a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1989 followed by a Doctor of Philosophy in particle physics in 1992. His PhD research used the ZEUS particle detector to investigate R-parity violating supersymmetry at the Hadron-Electron Ring Accelerator (HERA) at the Deutsches Elektronen- Synchrotron (DESY) in Hamburg, and was supervised by Doug Gingrich and Herbert K. Dreiner. Research and career Butterworth works on particle physics, particularly the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. His research investigates what nature is like at the smallest distances and the highest energies - the fundamental physical laws. This tells us about the physics which was most important in the first few moments after the Big Bang. His research collaborators include Brian CoxAnon (2015) published by the Royal Institution, London and Jeff Forshaw and he has supervised or co-supervised several successful PhD students to completion on the ATLAS experiment, ZEUS and HERA. Butterworth frequently discusses physics in public, including talks at the Royal Institution and the Wellcome Trust and appearances on Newsnight, Horizon, Channel 4 News, Al Jazeera, and BBC Radio 4's Today Programme and The Infinite Monkey Cage.

Karl Reinisch (21 August 1921 ‚Äì 24 January 2007) was a German electrical engineer and professor for control engineering in Ilmenau. Under his lead, a solid foundation for automation and system technology for cybernetics was developed at the Technische Universit√§t Ilmenau. For many years, he was active at the International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC).  Life  Karl Reinisch received his Abitur in 1940, and for the next five years served in World War II. Between 1946 and 1950 he studied electrical engineering with a focus on extra-low voltage at the Technische Universit√§t Dresden, working with Heinrich Barkhausen and Georg Mierdel. The latter convinced Reinisch to move into the area of control engineering. Immediately after he finished studying, he became a scientific assistant, later \\"Oberassistent\\" (head assistant) for general electrical engineering, and between 1951 and 1953 received a university teaching position for theoretical electrical engineering.Lebenslauf Karl Reinisch. In: Frank Dittmann und Rudolf Seising: Kybernetik steckt den Osten an - Aufstieg und Schwierigkeiten einer interdisziplin√§ren Wissenschaft in der DDR. Trafo Verlag, Berlin. 2007. He gained further teaching experience in the subject of control engineering in Magdeburg, where an institute for control engineering was being formed (Sponsor: Heinrich Wilhelmi). Reinisch's dissertation from 1957 on the subject of optimization of control cycles is considered the first thesis on control engineering in the GDR. In the same year, the German Academy of Sciences at Berlin created a position for control engineering in Dresden (Led by: Heinrich Kindler). Karl Reinisch accepted the position to develop and lead the department \\"Elektrische Regelungssysteme\\" (electrical control systems). Other departments were \\"Nichtelektrische Regelungssysteme\\" (non-electrical control systems) and \\"Schaltsysteme\\" (combinational / sequential circuits) (Led by: Siegfried Pilz). In 1960 he was appointed to the Hochschule f√ºr Elektrotechnik Ilmenau, later TH Ilmenau, and today TU Ilmenau where he developed the new field of control engineering at the faculty for extra-low voltage. In 1965 he finished his Habilitation at the TU Dresden, and in the same year was designated Professor at the TH Ilmenau. In the year 1968 Siegfried Pilz from the academy in Dresden followed him to Ilmenau, department of \\"Informationstechnik\\" (information technology), Hans- Joachim Zander became his successor. As part of the reform of the higher education institutions in 1968, Karl Reinisch initiated the merger of four institutes into the newly created department for technical and biomedical cybernetics.Der Dekan der heutigen Fakult√§t f√ºr Informatik und Automatisierung sagte √ºber Karl Reinisch, den Gr√ºnder dieser Sektion ‚Äûals Vorl√§ufer unserer Fakult√§t‚Äú, er habe ‚Äû von Beginn an die Vision der Technischen Kybernetik als einer interdisziplin√§ren Systemwissenschaft aus Ingenieurwissenschaft, Informatik und nicht-technischen Wissenschaften‚Äú gehabt (Prof. Dr.-Ing. Kai- Uwe Sattler anl√§sslich der Namensgebung ‚ÄûZuse-Bau‚Äú f√ºr das neue Fakult√§tsgeb√§ude an der TU Ilmenau im August 2011). He led the Institute for Control Engineering that he establishedEntwicklungsstationen des heutigen Instituts f√ºr Automatisierungs- und Systemtechnik, and the Faculty for Automatic Control that emerged from it in 1968 until his retirement from his academic career in 1986. His work extended to non-technical systems as well. In the 1970s he began to teach and research the Dynamics and Simulation of ecological Systems, the basis for a field of TU Dresden that was established later, and that belongs to the Faculty of Environmental Sciences. In 1987, TU Dresden awarded him with the Doctor honoris causa for his achievements. Even after his retirement, Reinisch remained active as a scientist. In 1995, he became a full member of the \\"Akademie gemeinn√ºtziger Wissenschaften zu Erfurt\\" (Academy of charitable sciences in Erfurt).Akademie gemeinn√ºtziger Wissenschaften: Pressemitteilung 02/07 . Abgerufen am 10. Mai 2007. Until 1996 he continued to give lectures for the Institute of Automation and System Technology at the Technical University of Ilmenau. Several professors emerged from the occupational sphere of Karl Reinisch: Ulrich Engmann, Manfred G√ºnther, Tatjana Lange, Jan Lunze, G. Otto, H. Puta, Michael Roth, Josef Sponer, and others. Karl Reinisch's impact went far beyond his professional work. For example, he organized ecumenic events on philosophical and religious questions. At the time of the GDR those took place in the rooms of his church congregation and brought together the representatives of very different directions. During the peaceful revolution of 1989 and afterwards, his advice and engagement were in demand in a larger setting. On January 24, 2007, following a long and serious illness, Karl Reinisch died at the age of 85.  Achievements  Karl Reinisch established a system-technologically characterized Control engineering school (in the sense of the Cybernetics of Norbert Wiener). His work focused on the optimal execution of complex processes in decentral, and especially hierarchical structures, applying this to water resource management (control of reservoirs) and agriculture. For more than 15 years he was active as a representative of the \\"Wissenschaftlich- Technische Gesellschaft Mess- und Automatisierungstechnik (WGMA)\\" (Scientific- technological society of measurement and automation engineering) of the Chamber of Technology (\\"Kammer der Technik\\", KdT, the organization of engineers, technicians and researchers of the GDR) in responsible positions at the International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC). With his retirement in 1986, Reinisch was awarded \\"Hervorragender Hochschullehrer\\" (exceptional university professor). Starting in 1989, Karl Reinisch took part in evaluating and structurally transforming the former Technische Hochschule Ilmenau into the Technical University of Ilmenau.

It is centered around the Broad Street Green, a public park extending on the east side of Broad Street (Connecticut Route 159) between Union and Batchelder Streets, and includes a diversity of architecture spanning much of the town's long history. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. Description and history The town of Windsor was one of the Connecticut's early settlements, dating to 1633. It has historically been centered around the mouth of the Farmington River where it enters the Connecticut River north of Hartford, with its earliest settlement area on the north side. The area to the south of the Farmington River was also a civically important area, serving as later secondary village center. The Broad Street Green was laid out as a common area in the 18th century, and was given its present park-like atmosphere in the late 19th century. The village grew in economic importance during the 19th century, and supplanted the original town center (the Palisado Green area) in civic importance as well. It is now where the town hall and other municipal buildings are located. The historic district is about in size, and includes all of the two dozen or so buildings facing the green between Batchelder and Union Streets. It also includes a few buildings on Union and Central Streets, just east of the green, extending down to the railroad tracks, where the historic station is included. Important civic buildings include the town hall, fire station, post office, and library. The library is partially housed in the Oliver Mather House, the district's oldest surviving building (1777). There are several two and three-story brick commercial blocks lining part of the green's west side.

In 2018, the company's cargo turnover reached 25.7 million tons. TIS operates its own cargo terminals in Small Adzhalyk Estuary, which is in the Port of Yuzhny water area 22 km north- east of Odessa. TIS Group owns five modern terminals: TIS Grain, TIS Mineral Fertilizers, TIS Ore, TIS Coal and TIS Container Terminal. TransInvestService owns and manages all service infrastructure facilities, including an in-house railway station. TIS Group is the biggest taxpayer in Odessa Oblast: the company paid over UAH 1.03 billion in taxes in 2018. It employs more than 4,000 people and continues to develop rapidly. Total investment in assets exceeds $770 million. TIS was the first in the port sector to develop and test a public-private partnership arrangement for areas that had no regulations or relevant precedents. Between 2006 and 2010, the company invested $40 million in bottom dredging near its berths. This investment has generated over $210 million in national budget revenues from port charges over the past five years. A law regulating the status of private investors in ports was adopted in 2012 only, and the Ministry of Infrastructure issued an order, which elaborated regulations to compensate for the money channeled by private investors into improvement works and bottom dredging, in 2015 only. Another project in which TIS tested the public-private partnership for the first time was the construction of a 5 km railway line near Port of Yuznhy. The initiative boosted the section capacity to handle up to 52 pairs of trains daily and increased the cargo traffic by 10 million tons a year. As the government had a budget deficit to implement such projects, the company and its partners invested their own money to build the line and transferred it into the government ownership.  Company history  Alexey Stavintser and Oleg Kutateladze founded the company on an abandoned construction site of Liman state-owned company in 1994. The owners bought out the government's stake in the course of the company's development. In 1994, they invested into abandoned facilities for rock phosphate imports at berth No.17. The raw materials were meant for a chemical plant under construction in Berezovka, Odessa Oblast. The construction which started in 1987 was never finished. However, an inter-governmental expert commission stopped the project. Involving environmental activists of Odessa region, the commission was set up by USSR Communist Party General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev in response to protests of Novye Bilyary residents. The project was mothballed to be further converted to handle other bulk cargoes. Between 1987 and 1994, the facilities were neglected and handled cargoes very rarely because of the overall economic downturn and their remoteness from state Commercial Port Yuzhny. When Alexey Stavintser and Oleg Kutateladze bought the stake, they started converting the facilities from imports into exports. Later they began offering fertilizer transshipment services. This was the start of the TIS Group development. Since September 1994, the company invested heavily to build six in-house berths with a total length of over 1,300 m and depth of 15 m, dredge 50 ha of the estuary bottom by 6.5 million cu m and excavate over 7 million cu m of onshore soil.  Berths and Terminals  Berth 15 ‚Äî TIS has built it as an auxiliary facility of the grain terminal for small vessels. Berth 16 ‚Äî TIS Grain is the Black Sea's biggest grain terminal with the annual capacity of 5.5-6 million tons. Completed in 1999, the facility is now 250 m long and 14 m deep. The storage capacity is 370,000 tons. Berth 17 ‚Äî TIS Mineral Fertilizers is Ukraine's second biggest terminal for fertilizer exports after Odessa Port Plant. It is 283 long and 14 m deep. The terminal's annual capacity is 3.5 million tons. Berth 18 ‚Äî TIS Ore terminal is a joint venture of TIS and Ferrexpo (Poltava GOK) to transship iron ore and pellets. Built in 2004, the facility has the annual capacity of five to six million tons. It is 250 long and 15 m deep. Berths 19 and 20 ‚Äî TIS Coal is the CIS biggest coal and ore terminal with the annual capacity of 12 million tons. Built in 2008, the berths are 500 long and 15 m deep. The storage capacity is 1 million cubic meters. In April 2012, the terminal accommodated Maxi Brazil, a 259,000 DWT bulker and the biggest vessel that ever docked in Ukraine. Berths 21 and 22 ‚Äî TIS Container Terminal is the Black Sea's newest terminal built in 2009. It is 600 m long and 15 m deep. The Phase 1 capacity is 400,000 TEU, while the maximum capacity is up to 2M TEU. Since November 2011, the facility has been serving ECUMED, a weekly liner service of Maersk Line. As of November 2011, the terminal has been servicing Maersk Line's ECUMED, a weekly liner service connecting Ecuador and the Black Sea, and, starting April 2018 ‚Äî Maersk Line's ME-3 service.  Infrastructure  Panorama of TIS, January 2010 TransInvestService owns and manages all service infrastructure facilities in the terminals, including an in-house railway station. In 2018, TIS handled over 335 053 railway cars. Since 2012, TIS Container Terminal has been operating Vizirka site for motor vehicle arrivals. This helps streamline and simplify all cargo processing and manifesting procedures for cargo owners. Vizirka operates a one-stop office with a customs unit, information desk and offices of other regulatory bodies. TIS invests heavily in the development of regular containerized rail transportation. In September 2017 the company was the first among Ukrainian ports to launch the container train from the TIS port to Dnipro. Throughout 2018, trains were launched in three new directions: Kyiv in January 2018, Ternopil and Kharkiv in the 3rd quarter of 2018. Last year, TIS container trains transported 27,683 TEU or 33.4% of Ukraine's total containerized rail cargo turnover.  Corporate Social Responsibility  TIS Group is the region's biggest taxpayer. It continues to develop and create jobs and is a key employer for residents of Limansky District (former Kominternovo District). Many Odessa residents work at TIS as well. TransInvestService is a founder and partner of Alexey Stavintser Foundation. The Foundation supports Odessa schools and many local initiatives. In 2011, the charity opened a children's arts and crafts center in Vizirka village. Since 2014, TIS has been regularly making donations to support internally displaced persons, servicemen and their families, as well as Odessa Military Hospital. The company organizes special events and celebrations for internally displaced children from the eastern Ukraine. TIS has invested to build a modern secondary school and renovated a kindergarten in Vizirka village, which is home to the terminals. Every year the company organizes special events for Limansky District schools and hosts school excursions. On its foundation day on 3 September, TIS organizes a festival for employees' children.  Industrial Prizes, Awards and Records  1\\\\.

TIS CEO Andrey Stavintser was recognized the Person of the Year in Water Transport in 2014. 3\\\\. In 2008, 2018 TransInvestService was called the best employer of the year. 4\\\\. In 2011, TIS Coal hit an absolute record in terms of the cargo loading rate in Ukrainian ports ‚Äî 70,701 tons a day (coal loading, Katsuragi-Maru) 5\\\\. In 2011, TIS Container Terminal cracked an absolute record in bulk cargo unloading in Ukrainian ports ‚Äî 41,150 tons a day (coal unloading, Navios Prosperity bulk carrier) 6\\\\. In 2015, TIS Group ranked as follows among other Black Sea ports: * 1st place by dry cargo transshipment among all Ukrainian public and private ports * 1st place by transshipment of all cargoes among all Ukrainian public and private ports * 1st place by railway car handling * 3rd place by transshipment of all cargoes in the Black Sea area (10th in the previous year) 7\\\\. In August 2016, TIS Coal loaded 103,000 tons of iron ore products a day onto Yue Shan capesize bulker. The loading rate was 100,000 tons/day, thrice as much as the average loading rate in Yuzhny Port. In total, TransInvestService loaded 120,000 tons onto the vessel. Experts believe investments into terminal modernization helped achieve the high performance.  Legal actions  In 1994, the company was set to cooperate with Norsk Hydro. However, the cooperation failed, as the Norwegian party defaulted on its commitments.Kyiv Post. Independence. Community. Trust - Ukraine - Norsk- Hydro Ukraine JV breaks down Nonetheless, Norsk Hydro initiated lengthy judicial proceedings that ended in the Stockholm Court in 2008. The court ruled that Norsk Hydro's claims were legally baseless.Ukraine wins case versus Norsk Hydro at Swedish Supreme Court - Justice Ministry In summer and spring 2009, TIS was involved into a public conflict with the management of the neighboring Yuzhny Port. The management had accused TIS of raider attacks and intentions to drive Yuzhny Port to bankruptcy. TransInvestService rebutted the allegations, stating that the port's management acted deliberately to derail TIS's investment plans. The conflict resulted in a two weeks downtime in outer roads for Scan Oceanic, a British vessel that had a coal loader on board, and put Zhen Hua 11 berthing at threat.

It was first exhibited at the Tate Modern art gallery in London from October 2010 to May 2011. It is a commentary on the mass production techniques that China caters to Western countries. Viewers were originally able to interact and walk across the sunflower seeds, but after the Tate Modern Museum recognized that the dust emitting from the installation was harmful to viewers' lungs, they fenced it off. The piece has been exhibited in twelve exhibitions from 2009-2013 in museums and galleries across the world.  Background  Ai Weiwei is a conceptual artist in China. Towards the later 20th century, he led societal movements challenging the Chinese Communist Party. Ai has felt the presence and pressures of the society that the Chinese government has imposed on the peoples, and that is generated into his artwork. \\"From a very young age I started to sense that an individual has to set an example in society\\", he has said. \\"Your own acts and behavior tell the world who you are and at the same time what kind of society you think it should be.\\"  Process  This massive art installation includes over 100 million porcelain sunflower seeds that cover a 1,000 square metre floor with a depth of 10cm in the Tate Modern's Turbine Hall. The entire artwork weighs around 150 tons. Each seed went through a 30 step procedure, hand painted and fired at 1,300 degrees. This process required more than 1,600 workers over a span of two and a half years in Jingdezhen, a town known as the \\"Porcelain Capital\\", and has produced the imperial porcelain for over a thousand years. Ai began the process two-and-a-half years before its exhibition at the Tate Modern.\\"About Ai Weiwei's Sunflower Seeds.\\" Ai Weiwei. Faurschou Foundation, n.d. Web. 29 Mar. 2017.  Influence/Context  Close up of Ai Weiwei's Sunflower Seeds Sunflower seeds were a common theme in the Chinese Communist Party's political propaganda during Ai's childhood. Leader Mao Zedong would often represent himself as the sun, and the people of China as seeds on sunflowers in artworks. Ai also explains that when he was growing up, even the poorest families in China could share the seeds as a treat. The seeds represent optimism during difficult times.  Interpretation  When looking at the seeds up close in Tate Modern's Turbine Hall, picking out each unique seed proves to be an easy task. However, when standing farther back once each of the 100 million seeds is deposited in a neat and orderly fashion, altogether a sense of expanse and immenseness is felt by the viewers. The millions of individually created seeds spread across such a wide space are meant to symbolize the vastness of China, and its uniform and precise order. An individual seed is instantly lost among the millions, symbolizing the conformity and censorship of the Communist Party of China. The combination of all the seeds represent that together, the people of China can stand up and overthrow the Communist Party of China. Most of Ai's artworks and projects carry this theme of making the Chinese Government's faults transparent to the rest of the world, as well as encouraging freedom of expression and strength to act. Along with this, the seeds represent China's growing mass production stemming from the consumerist culture, particularly that in the Western world, upon which Chinese exporters rely. The sculpture directly challenges the \\"Made in China\\" mantra that China is known for, considering the labor-intensive and traditional method used to create the work.\\"About Ai Weiwei's Sunflower Seeds.\\" Ai Weiwei. Faurschou Foundation, n.d. Web. 29 Mar. 2017. The work triggered inquiries from the viewers of the piece about their society and the effects of consumerism.

She was born Sage J. Clarke in around 1870 at Garey Hollin in Ronague, in the parish of Arbory, Isle of Man, following in the line of three generations of her family who had been born and raised there. She married John Kinvig (c. 1860‚Äì1953), who was at times fisherman, mason and Common Lands Inspector. After initially training in Castletown to become a dressmaker, Sage Kinvig eventually came to dedicate her time to maintaining the croft and raising their family of ten children.Skeealyn Vannin / Stories of Mann: The complete collection of Manx Language archive recordings made by the Irish Folklore Commission in 1948, Douglas: Manx National Heritage, 2003, pp.11‚Äì12 Sage Kinvig and her husband were fluent native speakers of Manx, as was the norm for residents of Ronague in their youth. However, they witnessed the neglect of the language, and indeed took part in it, deciding not to teach the language to their children. At the time of her death in 1962, Sage Kinvig was believed to be one of only two living native Manx speakers,'Keep the Faith' by Adrian Cain, on the Ynsee Gaelg website (accessed 9/03/2017) the other being Ned Maddrell, who died in 1974. During her lifetime, she and others recognised her importance as a native Manx speaker. In April and May 1948, Kinvig was one of the Manx speakers recorded by the Irish Folklore Commission. This was instigated by √âamon de Valera, in order to preserve the speech of the remaining native speakers - a task neglected since it had been attempted by the Manx Language Society under the stewardship of Sophia Morrison in the 1900s'The Manx Language Society Phonograph: The First Recording Sessions of 1905.

Al- Shaykh was a proponent of the doctrine of Takfir and publicly challenged the leadership of al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya calling Omar Abdel Rahman an apostate and demanding that Hosni Mubarak pay him the Jizya.Ahmad al-Drayni; \\"The Shawqiyun: A dress rehearsal for ISIS in Fayoum,\\" Al-Masry Al-Youm, 25 February 2017 Egyptian security forces killed Al-Shaykh in the village of Kahk in the governorate of Fayoum in April 1990. Life Shawqi al-Shaykh's path to radicalization began in the early 1980s when he was imprisoned on charges of belonging to the Al-Jama'a Al-Islamiyya. While in prison the former engineer became acquainted with Naguib Abdel Fattah Ismail, the son of the deceased Muslim Brotherhood member Abdel Fattah Ismail. While in prison Shaykh adopted radical views that would lead him to become too extreme even for Al- Gama'a Al-Islamiyya. After being released from prison he developed a reputation for being a determined and capable militant. Some time in the late 1980s al-Shaykh broke ties with Al-Gama'a Islamiyya and formed his own group in [Faiyum] called al-Shawqiyun. Al-Shawqiyun won support from the impoverished Egyptians in the Faiyum oasis south of Cairo. Al-Shaykh used their support to seize control of the village of Kahk. Al-Shawqiyun established a small emirate in Kahk and imposed an austere brand of Islam on the villagers there. His organization enriched itself through theft and extortion targeting Christians in particular. Al-Shaykh determined that all who were not active in his organization were unbelievers. Al-Shaykh even went so far as to send a telegram to then president Hosni Mubarak demanding that Mubarak convert or pay him the Jizya tax. The stunt earned the ire of Mubarak who ordered military action against Al-Shaykh. In April 1990, Al-Shaykh was killed by a security forces raid on Kahk. Even after Al-Shaykh's death, his followers refused to submit to the Egyptian government's authority and demanding the establishment of an Islamic state in Egypt.Fisk, Robert. \\"Radicals March to their own Tune: In the first of four reports on growing Islamic fundamentalism in Egypt, Robert Fisk finds bedlam in a Cairo military court\\", Independent. 28 June 1993 Influence Ahmad al-Drayni believed that Shawqi al-Shaykh helped inspire the brand of Islamic radicalism that would influence the rise of ISIS.

CS can be used as a way to taste food viewed as ‚Äúforbidden‚Äù or unhealthy. Individuals who partake in CS typically have an increased desire for thinness, increased lack of control (LOC) and body dissatisfaction. CS can serve different functions such as replacing vomiting and/or binging or as an additional behavior to many eating disorders. CS and like behaviors has been found in several different eating disorders, making it difficult to find a treatment that works as a cure-all. There has been no defined treatment of CS as of now; however, Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to reduce negative behaviors involved in eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa, anorexia nervosa and many others. A recent systematic review on the topic, revealed seven themes identified in scholarly articles. These themes include having potential markers of eating disorder severity (regardless of length of illness contributing to age discrimination. Individuals suffering from CS also showed increased Loss of Control (LOC), Pathological eating, negative emotions and feelings, and Body image distortion. CS sufferers may also be trans-diagnostic (i.e. appears in individuals who have been diagnosed with all or any type of clinical or sub-clinical eating disorder) Consequences and treatments Chew and Spit is often associated with and may be a potential gateway to more severe dieting behaviors. Individuals who use CS as a compensatory behavior are more likely to be diagnosed or develop eating disorders. The likelihood is dependent upon the severity of food obsession present. Treatments to eliminate the behavior of chewing and spitting have not yet been developed. However, given the correlation with eating disorders, research suggest treatments that are used for eating disorders such as, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, may also be effective for eliminating Chewing and Spitting behaviors. Frequency and tendency Throughout studies relating to Chew and Spit, it was seen that 34% of individuals with eating disorders partake in CS. This includes all eating disorders such as bulimia, anorexia nervosa, and more. It has also been found that younger individuals are more likely to participate in CS. While younger individuals are more likely to develop CS, this does not determine personality or activity outside of eating behaviors. Overall, CS contributes to body dissatisfaction while body dissatisfaction contributes to CS. CS has also been seen to occur in episodes, rather than consistently. These episodes have been seen to be days to weeks long. Research Chew and Spit has not received much attention in the research industry regarding treatment, long term effects of chewing and spitting, and its associations with other behaviors and eating disorders.

Eccles specialises in homotopy theory and its applications to different topology. Eccles taught a wide variety of pure mathematics throughout his career, and published the book Introduction to mathematical reasoning in 1997. In addition to his mathematical publications, Eccles has been active in the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) nationally and internationally throughout his adult life and was invited to give the 2009 Swarthmore Lecture, which was published as The presence in the midst: reflections on discernment.  Early life  Peter Eccles grew up in Blackpool, attending Blackpool Grammar School. He studied at Clare College, Cambridge and then later at the Victoria University of Manchester. Eccles grew up attending Blackpool Quaker Meeting and during his teenage years developed a passionate interest in classical music, playing the piano, violin and viola as a child.  Career  From 1971 until 2015, Eccles taught in various roles at the University of Manchester, moving from Lecturer, through to Senior Lecturer, Professor and finally Emeritus Professor. In 1971, Peter was appointed Lecturer in Mathematics at the Victoria University of Manchester, where he worked until his retirement as Professor of Mathematics in 2015. Also from 1977, through to 1978, he spent a year as Visiting Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Northwestern University, Illinois. Whilst teaching at the University of Manchester, Eccles specialised in topology and homotopy theory, publishing numerous papers and journals on the area of study. Peter's studies specialise in areas such as multiple points of immersions of manifolds in Euclidean space. He has also taught the history of mathematics and probability theory. In 1997 Cambridge University Press published his book 'Introduction to mathematical reasoning: numbers, sets and functions‚Äô. As a research mathematician, Eccles specialised in topology and homotopy theory, publishing numerous journal papers in this area of study[4]. Eccles's most significant contributions are concerned with the multiple points of immersions of manifolds in Euclidean space and their relationship with classical problems in the homotopy groups of spheres. His interest in this area began when he clarified the relationship between multiple points and the Hopf invariant (disproving a conjecture by Michael Freedman) and the Kervaire invariant. His teaching ranged over most areas of pure mathematics as well as the history of mathematics, relativity theory and probability theory. He became particularly interested in the transition from school to university mathematics and this led in 1967 to the publication by Cambridge University Press of his book 'Introduction to mathematical reasoning: numbers, sets and functions‚Äô.[5] which continues to be used at universities in Britain and North America.  Quakerism  Peter Eccles has been a Quaker since birth, having been brought up with the faith, and started to become involved nationally and internationally in his early twenties, following his attendance at the Fourth World Conference of Friends in Greensboro, North Carolina in 1967 as one of the British representatives. He became treasurer of the Friends World Committee for Consultation from 1982 until 1995. In addition to this, Eccles was Clerk (Presiding Officer) for the national Quaker meeting, Meeting For Sufferings, from 1986 until 1991, as well as later being clerk of Britain Yearly Meeting (the annual national gathering of Quakers in Britain) from 2002 to 2005. By then a significant contributor to the Quaker movement, Eccles was offered the opportunity to present the annual Swarthmore Lecture at the University of York on 28 July 2009. The Book The Presence in The Midst: Reflections on Discernment, which was written by Eccles, is an accompaniment to his 2009 Swarthmore lecture. Described as taking \\"a scientific approach to Quakerism.\\" By Stephen Ward in the Oxford Handbook of Quaker Studies, Eccles‚Äôs Mathematical outlook has, in some respects, intertwined with his thoughts on Quakerism.  Music  Having a lifelong interest in music, Eccles plays the piano, violin and viola, as well as teaching a musical appreciation class at the Wilmslow Guild since 2015. Eccles took his musicianship and passion for music and arts to the Quaker society, as he chaired the trustees of The Leaveners, the Quaker performing arts organisation, from 1996 to 1999. It was here that Eccles took part in performances at the Royal Festival Hall in London in 1989 and in Symphony Hall Birmingham in 1995 under encouragement from musician Taylor Giacoma, who Peter met through a local Quaker Meeting. = Semitone Studios = Peter Eccles is also co-owner at Semitone Studios in Marple, along with folk singer/songwriter, Taylor Giacoma.  Personal life  Eccles married Pamela Goldsbury, a Quaker from New Zealand, in 1970 and they had two sons, Michael (born 1972) and Mark (born 1974) and three granddaughters. Pamela died in 2011.

He is best known for performing the first open-heart surgery in Kosovo, and for his pro bono work for patients from Kosovo, Albania and North Macedonia. He spent the biggest part of his professional career in Germany, beginning in 1989.  Biography  = Early career = Fatmir Dalladaku was born on December 5, 1953, in then Yugoslavia (now Republic of Kosovo). After graduating from high school, he enrolled in the Medical Faculty of the University of Prishtina, where he completed his studies in 1979. He continued and finished his postgraduate studies at the Medical Faculty of the University of Zagreb in Croatia, under the tutelage of Prof. Dr. Ivo Despot. Between 1979 and 1982, Dalladaku worked in numerous primary health care centers throughout Kosovo, and at the emergency center in Prishtina. Under the tutelage of Prof. Dr. V.Moracic and Prof. Dr. Gazmend Shaqiri, in 1985 he was a resident at the Surgical Clinic at the Medical Faculty of the University of Prishtina. Between 1985 and 1986, he specialized in general surgery, at the Ozren Novosel and KBC Rebro clinics in Zagreb, under the mentorship of Prof. Dr. Mladen Stulhoffer and Prof. J. Sokolic. = Time in Germany = In 1989, Dalladaku received a scholarship to do a sub-specialization on cardiovascular surgery at the Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin under the mentorship of Prof. Dr. Roland Hetzer. His initial plan was to go back to Kosovo after the 18-month period and together with his colleagues from the Department of Vascular Surgery to set up the much-needed cardiac surgery clinic at the Medical Faculty of the University of Prishtina. However, the original plan was never carried out as the abolition of Kosovo's autonomy in 1989 set in motion a chain of events that made its political future uncertain. As the political situation in Kosovo grew increasingly tense, by 1991, the majority of Kosovo Albanian professors and doctors, were fired from the University of Prishtina. With the permission of the newly created Kosovo's parallel structures of the Medical Faculty of the University of Prishtina, Dalladaku accepted the offer extended by the Deutsches Herzzentrum Berlin to remain in Berlin as a specialist physician. He performed his first open heart surgery in 1990 while in Berlin and has since performed over 4,000 such surgeries. In 1994, together with a group of colleagues from Berlin and Heidelberg, Dalladaku co-founded the MediClin Herzzentrum clinic in Lahr-Schwarzwald, Germany, where he is currently senior cardiovascular surgeon. He returned to Pristina in 2003 to perform the first open-heart surgery in Kosovo. From 2004 to 2008, he was also engaged as a lecturer at the Medical Faculty of the University of Prishtina. He has written and co-authored numerous papers and has participated in many national and international medical symposiums.  First open heart surgery in Kosovo  Dalladaku and his team during the first open heart surgery in Kosovo At Dalladaku‚Äôs initiative, in May 2003 a team of medical professionals from Germany arrived in Kosovo with the mission to perform the first two bypass open-heart surgeries there. In addition to the free of charge diagnostics of the two patients at the Cardiology Clinic of the Medical Faculty in Tirana, Albania, a few days before surgery, Dalladaku also arranged the transportation of the necessary medical equipment from Germany to Kosovo, including heart lung machines and intra-aortic balloon pumps. After four days of traveling and numerous bureaucratic complications on the way, the technical equipment which was being accompanied by Dalladaku's colleague, Michael Rothe, arrived in Pristina on May 23. The next day, on May 24, two patients aged 67 and 51 underwent heart surgery which was carried out at the newly renovated operation room of the Clinic of Gynecology and Obstetrics of the University Clinical Center of Kosovo. Surgery was provided free of charge, as all costs were borne by the Herzzentrum Lahr/Schwarzwald clinic, and FD Company, Dalladaku‚Äôs family business at that time. Although no complications occurred, the German KFOR troops stationed in Kosovo were ready to provide, if needed, transportation from Kosovo to Germany for the two patients. The medical team of Dr. Andre Gille (anesthesiologist), Ass. Dr. Petra Gehle (assistant), Michael Rothe (cardio technician) and Jens Kubsdella (instrumentalist), as well as Dr. Armin Lehmann, Gabrielle Herrmann, Katja Vogel, Christoph Wehler and Michael Fellhauer of the intensive care unit, flew back to Germany a week after the successful completion of the surgery. While the medical equipment was shipped back to Germany, Dalladaku remained in Kosovo for a few weeks longer to oversee the post-surgery treatment of patients by his Kosovo colleagues. He also was responsible for overseeing the process of donating all unused medications brought from Germany (a total of 18 large aluminum bags) to different clinics of the University Clinical Center of Kosovo.  Personal life  Dalladaku is married to the painter and art professor Bukurije Oseku- Dalladaku, and has two children. He currently lives in Lahr, Germany, and works at the MediClin Herzzentrum Lahr/Baden.

Following the 1993-1994 feud with the Latin Kings, the President of the Puerto Rican street gang, Jorge Rivera, was given 13 concurrent life sentences for four murders, drug trafficking, and other offenses which subsequently severely disrupted gang activities and operations. Then in the early 2000s the gang began regrouping, reforming and in 2008 was featured on an episode of Gangland. In January 2008, high-ranking member Trevis \\"Bones\\" Dailey was arrested for the murder of a rival gang member while on parole for the homicide of a Latin Kings member in 1994.

To accomplish this Seligman disguised Greek fishing ca√Øques while outfitting them with military equipment. Ca√Øques were operated by crews of 5-6 and were armed with 20mm cannons, Browning machine guns and Vickers aircraft machine guns.Allied Special Forces History: Levant Schooner Flotilla . The vessels often operated under cover of darkness, landing or picking up commandos, rescuing partisans, and intercepting or raiding small German forces. Many ships were powered by Matilda tank engines and used long-range radios taken from Kittyhawk (P-40) fighter aircraft.

Tom Dodd was born in Douglas, where he attended Douglas Grammar School. He spent his whole professional career with the Isle of Man Bank, eventually as the manager of the Peel branch. Tom Dodd was a founding member of the Peel Players, who performed from 1912 until the death of Sophia Morrison in 1917. During that time, Dodd performed in at least three plays by Christopher R. Shimmin: The Charm, Illiam Kodhere‚Äôs Will, and Dooinney Moyllee. It was through these performances that the Peel Players came to be regarded today as possibly the most significant Manx dialect theatre company in Manx history. Dodd was said to be interested in 'anything Manx', and he came to be an eager learner of the Manx language by the time he went to live in Peel. He became an influential member of the language community, particularly through his work to expand the written materials available to learners, which were limited at that time to the Manx Bible and Edmund Goodwin's First Lessons in Manx. In April and May 1948, Dodd was one of the Manx people recorded by the Irish Folklore Commission. This was instigated by √âamon de Valera, in order to preserve a record of the Manx language, dialect and accent as it was spoken at that time. Dodd's inclusion in their recordings can be seen as a recognition of his significance to Manx culture.

Scribbly Jibbet is a semi-autobiographical character, presenting the adventures of a young man starting out in the cartooning business, working for the Morning Dispatch newspaper. His stories were told around the Golden Age era where American Comic Books were primarily anthologies telling more than one story in a magazine issue. Scribbly first appeared in the Popular Comics series and then appeared in All-American Comics from 1939 to 1944, and was then revived in his own series, Scribbly, from 1948 to 1952. All-American was one of the two companies that merged to form DC Comics in the 1940s, and, like all of DC's Golden Age characters, Scribbly was later considered part of the \\"Earth-Two\\" continuity. In 2015, Scribbly was briefly revived in DC Comics continuity by Paul Levitz, in the miniseries Convergence: World's Finest Comics. Dell Comics Sheldon Mayer began his career in cartooning at age fifteen, and he created Scribbly when he was nineteen. Mayer later explained, \\"Scribbly was a thing I dreamed up during my lunch hour one day in the cafeteria... I followed the old rule of writing only what you know about. What was more natural than writing about the adventures of a boy cartoonist?\\" In 1936, Mayer worked for Max Gaines, one of the pioneers of modern comic books, and the teenager's job was to cut and paste comic strips from the Sunday comics pages into a comic book layout, which Gaines would sell to Dell Comics, to publish in one of their anthology books. Along with the recut strips, Mayer included a one-page strip of his own, Scribbly the Boy Cartoonist, and this was published in Dell's Popular Comics #6 (July 1936), alongside established strips like Smokey Stover, Winnie Winkle and Harold Teen. Jean-Paul Gabilliet says, \\"[Mayer] presented all the pages as Sunday panels because, at the time, the fact that a strip had previously appeared in a newspaper was perceived as an indicator of quality.\\" Scribbly strips also appeared in Dell's The Funnies later in 1936. Andrew J. Kunka describes the way that the strip began: \\"In the earliest Dell-published strips, Mayer's series begins with Scribbly as a kid known in his neighborhood for drawing cartoons on any surface he can find, including walls and fences (something Mayer did in his youth, as well). These drawings are discovered by a famous cartoonist, Ving Parker, who happens to be Scribbly's hero. Ving takes on Scribbly as an apprentice and even introduces him to real-life cartoonists like Lank Leonard (Mickey Finn) and Milt Gross. Scribbly's strip quickly catches on, and while he tries to work from home, his brother, Dinky, inadvertently gives him even more material. This early iteration of the series, before Mayer moves to All-American, eventually shifts to pure slapstick and less about Scribbly's cartooning experiences.\\" A remarkable aspect of the comic is that Scribbly is creating his own autobiographical comic: \\"Why Big Brothers Leave Home,\\" about his relationship with the pesky Dinky (himself based on Mayer's little brother, Monte). In most of the Scribbly comics, a \\"Why Big Brothers Leave Home\\" strip appeared as a topper strip, either at the top or the bottom of the page, drawn in cruder form to indicate that it was a cartoon-within-a-cartoon. Readers were encouraged to send in ideas for \\"Why Big Brothers Leave Home\\", collaborating with Scribbly on his autobiography. At one point in the strip, \\"Why Big Brothers Leave Home\\" becomes so popular that Scribbly's principal creates his own autobiographical strip, \\"Scene in P.S. 83 as Seen by the Principal.\\" A teacher in the school is unhappy with the way that she's portrayed in the principal's strip, and starts a cartoon of her own. All-American Publications Scribbly featured on the left of the cover photo in All- American Comics #1 (April 1939) alongside original comic strip characters. In 1938, Gaines struck out on his own, founding All-American Publications. Mayer remained at the company as cartoonist and editor, and Scribbly appeared in All American Comics, beginning with the first issue (April 1939) and continuing until issue #59 (July 1944). Scribbly appeared on the All-American cover only three times, including issue #2. Scribbly worked for the Morning Dispatch newspaper, although most of the action in the strip took place in his New York neighborhood. In issue #3 of All-American Comics, Mayer introduced Ma Hunkel, the owner of a local grocery store. In another autobiographical touch, Ma Hunkel was inspired by the owner of a boarding house where Mayer lived, Mrs. Lindenbaum. With the skyrocketing popularity of the Superman comic in 1938, comic book publishers began featuring their own superhero characters. All- American Comics responded in 1939 with Gary Concord, the Ultra-Man, and followed in 1940 with Green Lantern and the Atom. The superhero trend was so powerful that in the Scribbly story in issue #20 (Nov 1940), Ma Hunkel became a superhero herself. In the story, Scribbly's little brother and Ma Hunkel's daughter Sisty are kidnapped, and the police are unable to locate them. Scribbly tells Ma about the Green Lantern, and she's inspired to don a costume and fight crime, calling herself the Red Tornado. By issue #23, the Red Tornado was sharing billing with Scribbly, and in #24, Ma's two kids joined the fight against crime, calling themselves \\"the Cyclone Twins\\". The kids scared criminals more than the Tornado herself. The series continued for three more years as \\"Scribbly & the Red Tornado\\". Ron Goulart writes: \\"Anticipating Wonder Woman, that monumental creation of William Moulton Marston, possibly even influencing it, Mayer chose a woman to be his costumed avenger, remaking the formidable Ma Hunkel into the even more formidable Red Tornado. Actually the people in the strip never knew the true sex of the Tornado. They only knew that this bulky figure in the red flannels, bedroom slippers, cape, and inverted stew pot could be counted on to tackle all sorts of criminals from the biggest to the smallest.\\" In fact, Ma Hunkel had a one-page cameo in the first JSA story, in All-Star Comics #3. The story, \\"The First Meeting of the Justice Society of America\\", has the heroes get together and swap stories about their heroics, and after hearing tales from the Flash, Hawkman, the Spectre and the Hour Man, the group notices that the Red Tornado is in the room. She explains that she wasn't invited to the meeting, but she came up on the fire escape. She gets a warm greeting from the group, but when they invite her to take her cape off and relax, she suddenly announces that she has to leave. The Flash laughs when he discovers that she tore her pants when she climbed in through the window. Later Justice Society stories established that Ma is an honorary member of the team, and in 2007, she returned to DC in Justice Society of America vol. 3 as the curator of the JSA's museum. In All- American Comics #45 (Dec 1942), Mayer himself entered the comic strip. In \\"Sheldon Mayer Meets the Red Tornado,\\" Scribbly, Ma Hunkel and the neighborhood kids are complaining that their stories are boring and repetitive, so Mayer enters the comic panels to respond to their complaints. Disheartened by their criticism, Mayer tries to commit suicide by jumping from the top panel, but the Red Tornado rushes to catch him before he hits the bottom panel. Outside of usually appearing in All-American Comics, Scribbly also appeared occasionally in Comic Cavalcade and also in the humor series, Buzzy. By issue #59 (July 1944), Mayer had grown tired of the characters, and openly admitted it in the introduction to that issue's story: \\"This goes on every issue ‚Äî sometimes it's funny ‚Äî sometimes it isn't ‚Äî anyhow ‚Äî I'm getting a little tired of it ‚Äî just this once I'm gonna have some FUN! F'rinstance let's see what would happen if instead of people we draw these characters as animals...\\" Mayer then explained that Scribbly would be a horse in this issue ‚Äî \\"maybe it's because I always know where to find a horse, but I go nuts finding an idea for Scribbly\\" ‚Äî while Ma Hunkel would be a big fat chicken, Sisty as a chick and Dinky as a pony.All-American Comics #59, \\"Falsely Accused\\", July 1944. This \\"funny animal\\" story was the last \\"Scribbly\\" story in All-American, with Mayer presumably tired of the strip altogether. Mayer's next project was a funny-animal humor book, Funny Stuff, which launched with a Summer 1944 issue, with new stars the Three Mouseketeers and McSnurtle the Turtle, the Terrific Whatzit. One final \\"Scribbly\\" chapter was published in the one-shot giant The Big All-American Comic Book, dated December 1944. Solo comic When Archie made teen humor comics popular, Scribbly was given his own bimonthly title, Scribbly, which ran for 15 issues, starting in September 1948. Mayer continued to write and draw the title, which is a romantic comedy about Scribbly trying to find a steady job and win his girlfriend's affection. The Red Tornado didn't appear in this reboot of the strip. Scribbly's sales were unimpressive, and Mayer was more interested in his new comic, Leave It to Binky, so the Scribbly comic was dropped in January 1952. Scribbly did appear as a backup feature in Leave it to Binky, as well as Buzzy, another DC teen comic. Convergence In 2015, Scribbly was briefly revived in DC Comics continuity by Paul Levitz, in the miniseries Convergence: World's Finest Comics. In the series, he's depicted as transcribing the events of the Seven Soldiers of Victory by Paul Levitz, Jim Fern, Joe Rubenstein and Shannon Wheeler. In an interview by Comic Book Resources, Paul Levitz explained his revival of the character: Reception Cartoonist and satirist Jules Feiffer wrote in The Great Comic Book Heroes (1965) that \\"the single unique stroke in the pre Detective Comics days was the creation, by Sheldon Mayer, of the humor strip Scribbly ‚Äî an underrated, often brilliantly wild cartoon about a boy cartoonist with whom, needless to say, I identified like mad. I regret that it is not within the province of this book to give Mayer or Scribbly the space both of them deserve.\\" The revival of Scribbly in Convergence got a negative review by Greg McElhatton in Comic Book Resources, opining that it would have been better if the comic \\"focused more on what it's like to be a cartoonist in a superhero world\\". He also felt that some of the art for Scribbly was off. In the 2013 book Comics About Cartoonists: Tales of the World's Oddest Profession, comics historian Craig Yoe described Scribbly as \\"the greatest out-of-the-inkwell cartoonist of all.\\" The book reprints six pages of Scribbly comics. Other versions In DC Comics satire childrens comic book, DC Super Friends #29, he is referenced by a young Batman as a famous artist who draws his feet too small.

It was initially released to Game Jolt on February 10, 2017, as the first of five chapters, with a full release on October 27, 2018. A console port published by Rooster Teeth Games was released on November 20, 2018. On December 21, 2018, a mobile port was released for iOS and Android. The game follows Henry Stein, a retired animator who returns to his old animation studio Joey Drew Studios from the 1930s after an invitation from his old employer Joey Drew, and discovers a nightmare of cartoon characters seemingly brought to life by the titular Ink Machine. Bendy and the Ink Machine was well-received upon its initial release, with praise centering on its vintage aesthetic and story. In the months following its release, it quickly gained a massive following from exposure on platforms like YouTube and Twitch, and eventually was approved through Steam Greenlight in mid-2017. Merchandise, as well as a mobile spin-off, was later introduced to further promote the game. Mike Mood, the game's programmer and co-creator, described the game as an \\"accidental success\\". Gameplay Bendy and the Ink Machine is a survival horror game that features a mixture of puzzle solving, environment exploration and combat to aid Henry on his journey through the darkened halls of Joey Drew Studios. Players explore through a first-person view and have limited physical actions such as running and jumping. Different items can be collected, some of which are required to perform various tasks before proceeding. Cans of bacon soup, a reference to the game's creator theMeatly and his partner Mike Mood, can also be collected for achievements and to restore Henry's health if he is injured. Combat is primarily focused around a variety of different melee-based weapons, such as an axe, pipe, plunger, or scythe. There are also long-range weapons such as a tommy gun or bacon soup cans. In-game enemies all have different strength levels and resilience to damage, forcing players to be tactical about keeping out of reach and striking when necessary. Failure to do so will result in a death. Henry can retreat inside Little Miracle Stations whenever enemies are nearby in order to recover or remain out of sight. If he takes too much damage, he can escape from the ink that consumes him and respawn at one of the numerous statues of Bendy that act as checkpoints. In addition, players can find numerous audio logs throughout the studio that give more details about the game's story, particularly concerning the fate of the studio and its employees, similar to the systems used in games such as BioShock. Some of these logs can be missed and require further exploration to uncover the secret areas they often reside In. Plot = Chapter 1: Moving Pictures = In August 1966, retired animator, Henry Stein receives a letter from his former friend and employer, Joey Drew, asking him to return to their animation studio and see something important. He visits the now abandoned studio, but discovers an \\"ink machine\\", installed sometime after Henry's departure 30 years earlier. He finds a tape recording by janitor Wally Franks that suggests Joey engaged in bizarre occult practices while making the machine, as well as a mutilated real-life analogue of Boris the Wolf, one of the studio's cartoon characters. Once Henry fixes and starts the machine, he is attacked by a creature known as \\"Ink Bendy\\" that looks like an evil version of studio mascot Bendy. As the studio begins to fill with ink, Henry flees toward the exit, only for the floor to collapse and drop him into the studio's lower levels. Draining the ink from this area, he finds a chamber whose floor is marked with strange diagrams. He hallucinates seeing the ink machine, a wheelchair, and then Ink Bendy before passing out. = Chapter 2: The Old Song = Henry wakes up and begins to search for a way out, eventually reaching the music department. Henry finds a stairwell leading to the exit, but the entrance is flooded with ink. While looking for a way to drain it, he is attacked by ink creatures known as the Searchers; once they are defeated, Henry enters the office of Sammy Lawrence, the studio's musical director. After completing several tasks to drain the ink, Henry hurries toward the exit but is attacked by Sammy, whose body has been transformed into ink. Sammy intends to sacrifice Henry to Ink Bendy in order to become a human again, but before he can do so, he is dragged away by Ink Bendy and presumably killed. Henry frees himself and flees through the studio, pursued by Ink Bendy. Barricading himself behind a door, he waits until Ink Bendy has left and then meets a living, intact Boris, called Buddy Boris. = Chapter 3: Rise and Fall = Henry befriends Buddy Boris, and the two leave the latter's safehouse to continue searching for an exit. In the toy department, they find another ink creature called Twisted Alice, who is a distorted version of actress Susie Campbell and the good character Alice Angel. Twisted Alice leads them to her lair and reveals that she has been harvesting the ink of other characters in order to make herself beautiful. Henry must perform several tasks for Twisted Alice in order for her to let him and Buddy Boris go free, learning from tape recordings that Susie Campbell became bitter when Joey suddenly hired a replacement for her, called Allison Pendle. Because of Joey not telling Susie that he replaced her with Allison Pendle, the ink transformed an angry Susie Campbell into Twisted Alice. As Henry carries out Twisted Alice's tasks, he must hide from both Ink Bendy and the Projectionist, an entity of projector operator Norman Polk. Henry completes the tasks and boards a lift to escape with Buddy Boris, but Twisted Alice forces it to crash to the bottom of its shaft and suddenly pulls Buddy Boris into the darkness. = Chapter 4: Colossal Wonders = Climbing out of the crashed lift, Henry ventures deeper into the studio in search of Buddy Boris and finds a lounge filled with the Lost Ones, ink creatures who show no hostility. He also discovers that Joey had been planning to open a Bendy-themed amusement park called Bendy Land with the help of famed ride designer Bertrum Piedmont. Henry enters a large warehouse filled with rides, games, and props from the planned park. In order to reach Buddy Boris, Henry must restore power to the haunted house attraction by finding and flipping a series of switches, which requires Henry to do a series of challenges. Upon restoring the power, Henry meets Buddy Boris, but as a twisted version of him called Brute Boris. Twisted Alice orders Boris to kill Henry. Henry kills Boris instead, and when he does, it frees Buddy Boris' ghost. Twisted Alice then tries to kill Henry herself but is killed with a sword from behind by Allison Angel, a physically intact and sane duplicate of Alice Angel and reincarnation of Susie's replacement, Allison Pendle. She is accompanied by Tom, a reincarnation of worker Thomas Connor as a wolf character similar to Boris. = Chapter 5: The Last Reel = Allison and Tom hold Henry captive, but he eventually gains Allison's trust and she gives him a \\"seeing tool\\" that allows him to see hidden messages on the walls. After Tom inadvertently reveals the location of their hideout to Ink Bendy, he and Allison abandon Henry and flee. Henry escapes on his own and crosses a river of ink on a paddleboat, reaching a shantytown built by the Lost Ones. There, Henry is attacked by Sammy, shown to still be alive and blinded by rage, thinking Henry is Ink Bendy. Unmasked by Henry, Sammy tries to kill him, only for Tom to kill Sammy instead. After Tom gains Henry's trust, Tom and Allison aid Henry in fighting off the Searchers and Lost Ones, who had been kept at bay by Sammy, and Henry falls into the administrative offices. After completing a puzzle, Henry finds Tom and Allison. Henry learns that Ink Bendy has stolen something important from the film vault and enters his lair ‚Äî a much vaster version of the ink machine ‚Äî to retrieve it. Allison and Tom remain behind, fearing that the ink will absorb and corrupt them. Inside, Henry finds one last tape recording by Joey, expressing his regret for everything that has happened and asking Henry to destroy Bendy. Henry finds the stolen item, a film reel marked \\"The End.\\" Ink Bendy chases him throughout the machine while transforming into a giant beast, called Beast Bendy. Henry eventually plays the reel, projecting a \\"The End\\" title card on every available screen and causing Beast Bendy to disintegrate when he sees it. The game suddenly changes to a flashback in the inside of Joey's home, with a bulletin board covered with letters from Allison Pendle, now married to Thomas Connor, and Wally Franks as well as sketches such as Bendy Land. Entering the kitchen, Henry finds Joey waiting to talk to him about the paths they took in their lives. After Joey tells to Henry visit the studio, Henry exits the house and finds himself immediately entering it, repeating his opening lines from Chapter 1. It is presumed that Henry and all of the studio's employees, now ink monsters and ink characters are trapped in a time loop of unknown origin. In a post-credits scene, the camera focuses on a framed portrait of Bendy, Boris and Alice, which was a gift from Henry to congratulate Joey for his success (alongside a rusty ink machine sitting in one corner of the room). Just then, a little girl's voice asks \\"Uncle Joey\\" to tell her another story, implying that the entire game was merely a story Joey was telling his niece. Development The idea for Bendy and the Ink Machine came from theMeatly pondering the idea of a world that resembled a cartoon sketch. As he started developing the idea, he realized that it felt \\"creepy\\" and needed a monster that inhabited it. Bendy was created to be that monster, but did not have a name. When the character finally received a 3D model, the name was chosen from a typo while saving it in a 3D modeling program, Blender. theMeatly was not a programmer and thus Mike Mood joined the production as he saw potential in the game. Bendy and the Ink Machine was inspired by the BioShock series.\\"Creaing a Monster: Bendy and the Ink Machine\\" - Gamereactor A special edition titled Bendy and the Ink Machine: Jacksepticeye Edition, was given to YouTuber Jacksepticeye before the fifth chapter released to the public. It included all five chapters.

The navies of Austria-Hungary, China, Denmark, Japan, The Netherlands, The Ottoman Empire, Romania and Spain all used this gun. History In 1880 Krupp designed the 15 cm SK L/35 and started production in 1883 to arm protected cruisers, turret ships and coastal defense ships then under construction. It was also used to rearmed a number of earlier iron clad warships. Originally designed to use one piece ammunition long and weighing the gun was redesigned to use two part quick loading cased charges and projectiles due to complaints about the size and weight of the ammunition. By breaking the ammunition down into two pieces the rate of fire was improved and crew workload was eased.

Land use In addition to its naval artillery role the 15 cm SK L/35 was also used as coastal artillery in either armored gun turrets or on garrison mounts. The garrison mount consisted of a rectangular steel firing platform which sat on a concrete slab behind a parapet with a pivot at the front and two wheels at the rear to give a limited amount of traverse. The recoil system consisted of a U shaped gun cradle which held the trunnioned barrel and a slightly inclined firing platform with a hydro-gravity recoil system. When the gun fired the hydraulic buffers under the front slowed the recoil of the cradle which slid up a set of inclined rails on the firing platform and then returned the gun to position by the combined action of the buffers and gravity.

Career In 1859, he arrived in London and took up a position at Hofmann's laboratory, where he met the Belgian diplomat Sylvain Van de Weyer. He subsequently became Van de Weyer's private secretary, hoping that it would allow him to pursue scientific studies in his free time; but, through his position, he became acquainted with Queen Victoria's eldest son and heir apparent, Edward, Prince of Wales, and was appointed his German Secretary and Librarian in 1863. The queen later offered Holzmann the equivalent post in her household, but he refused and remained with the prince, serving in that capacity until Edward became king in 1901. He was also appointed Private Secretary to the Princess of Wales in 1870, and served in that capacity until he was given the post of Secretary and Clerk of the Council of the Duchy of Cornwall, an office he held between 1886 and 1908, having been on the Prince's Council from 1882 to his accession as King. After the Prince became King in 1901, Holzmann was made one of his extra grooms-in-waiting.Sir Maurice Holzmann, K.C.B., K.C.V.O., I.S.O.\\", The Alpine Journal, vol. 25 (1911), pp. 347‚Äì348.\\"Holzmann, Sir Maurice\\", Who Was Who (online edition), Oxford University Press, 2014.

Outside of the court, he was a keen mountaineer; he climbed in the Eastern Alps before exploring the Cortina and Auronzo area; his notes and connections allowed him to join the Apline Club in 1874 and he subsequently contributed to The Alpine Journal. He followed this up with trips to Seewies and Cortina in 1877‚Äì81 and then the Chamonix, Zermatt and Bernese Oberland districts. Between 1884 and 1886, he sat on the Alpine Club's committee and was its Vice- President in 1887.

The film is now lost, except for an excerpt of approximately 10 minutes. Ozu's friend and coworker Hiroshi Shimizu, who co-wrote the script, was originally slated to direct the film. Shimizu's wife Kinuyo Tanaka starred in the film. The plot involved a young man (Minoru Takada) who turns down a receptionist job after graduating college because he feels it isn't good enough for him, but needs to fool his mother (Utako Suzuki) and fiancee (Tanaka) into thinking he has a job. After he marries the fiancee he has to admit to her that he is unemployed so she takes a job in a bar. After an argument with her he apologizes for being irresponsible. He goes back to the company he turned down to accept the receptionist job, but they give him a salaried position instead. A poster from Harold Lloyd's silent comedy Speedy is used as a prop in the film. One visual gag in the film occurs when the man is apologizing to his wife and suddenly slaps her head, but it is then revealed that he was killing a mosquito. According to Donald Richie, Ozu's 1930 film I Flunked, But... was based in part on this film. To David Bordwell I Was Flunked, But... presents the opposite situation to this film, in that the protagonist does not graduate and so does not have to face unemployment. Both films reflect a theme that runs through several of Ozu's films of the period, that of youth unemployment in Japan at the time. Akira Iwasaki described Ozu's films in the period starting with this film and extending to I Was Born, But... as having \\"more directly depicted the psychological depression of the 'dark period' than any other films.\\" A Kinema Jumpo critic complained that the film's playfulness was \\"jarring\\" and that the happy ending detracted from the social message. Bordwell commented on the symmetry in the construction of the film, including how it begins and ends with scenes at the company office with opposite results, and how at first the man pretends to have a job when he does not but later his fiancee pretends not to have one when she does.

Description of the Cape Verde Rise at DSDP 368 area Geography The rise are bounded by the Canary Basin to the north and the Cape Verde Basin to the south. Numerous seamounts are located in the rise including the Cape Verde (or Cabo Verde) (Latin: sometimes as Extracapitis being off the cape), Cadamosto, Boa Vista, Nola and Senghor. The third and fourth are named after explorers of Cape Verde, the other, the founding father of Senegal. The highest point is 2,220 meters below sea level and the deepest is in the range of over 3,000 meters deep. In the east end of the rise is the Dakar Canyon. It ranges between the 14 and the 22¬∞ parallels north and is 900 km long. Near the rise is the westernmost point in Africa, Cap-Vert, northwest of the rise is the Santo Ant√£o Ridge. In the waters above the Cape Verde Rise is the Canary (or Canarian) Current to the north and the Equatorial Atlantic Current around the south of the rise. Nola Seamount may be the tallest seamount within Cape Verde with its elevation ranging from 60-70 meters deep, and probably the Cape Verde Rise. Fracture zones Over 1,500 km west of the rise are two fracture zones located at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the Kane , the Fifteen-Twenty and Jacksonville. In the rise there are 13 smaller fracture zones, three extends as far as the Cape Verde Basin and another extends north into the Canary Basin and within the Canary Islands. Deep sea exploration In the course of the Deep Sea Drilling Project and the Ocean Drilling Program, two research drillings were done so far, the DSDP 368 and the ODP 659. At the DSDP 368 location which was drilled 985 meters deep, it is divided into three units, the first unit composes of marls and oozes, the second composes of turbidites and the third composes of black shales, they lie above pelagic limestones and the oceanic crust. In that area are five basaltic sills. DSDP 368 is east of the island of Boa Vista. Geology The oldest rocks dates back to 155 million years ago during the Kimmeridgian era in the area what is now the east of the rise, around 131 to 128 million years ago, the seamounts of Maio and Santiago were formed, at the time they were closer to the Mid- Atlantic Ridge. The spreading rate was slow and moved a centimeter a year. Between 15 and 7 million years ago, they were volcanically active. Its only volcanic activities in the basin are in Fogo, Brava and the Cadamosto Seamount. Brava's last eruption was in the Holocene era. Fauna In the waters above the rise, eighteen species of whales and dolphins have been recorded in the waters of the Cape Verde archipelago. The area is cited as one of two known breeding grounds for the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) of the Northern Hemisphere. Humpback whales migrate annually from the North Sea to winter around Cape Verde from January to mid-May. The humpback whale population became limited due to severe overfishing during the 19th century and, although the total North Atlantic population of humpbacks had rebounded to more than 10,000 individuals by 1993, the Cape Verde population remained uncertain as of 2009. Molluscs (Mollusks) in the deep waters within the Cape Verde islands include Tiberia apicifusca at depths between 273 m and 970 m below sea level.

Before 1871, Prussia was the dominant factor in German affairs, but there were numerous smaller states. The question of excluding or including Austria's influence was settled by the Prussian victory in the Austro-Prussian War in 1866. The unification of Germany was made possible by the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì71, in which the smaller states joined behind Prussia in a smashing victory over France. The German Empire was put together in 1871 by Otto von Bismarck, who dominated German and indeed all of European diplomatic history until he was forced to resign in 1890. The new German Empire immediately became the dominant diplomatic, political, military and economic force in Europe, although it never had as large a population as Russia. Great Britain continued to dominate the world in naval affairs, international trade, and finance. The Germans tried to catch up in empire building but felt an inferiority complex. Bismarck felt a strong need to keep France isolated, lest its desire for revenge frustrate his goals, which after 1871 were European peace and stability. When Kaiser Wilhelm removed Bismarck in 1890, German foreign policy became erratic and increasingly isolated, with only Austria-Hungary as a serious ally and partner. During the July Crisis, Germany played a major role in starting World War I in 1914. The Allies defeated Germany in 1918. The Versailles Peace Treaty was punishing for Germany. By the mid-1920s, Germany had largely recovered its role as a great power thanks to astute diplomacy on its own part, the willingness of the British and Americans compromise, and financial aid from New York. Internal German politics became frenzied after 1929 and the impact of the Great Depression, leading to a takeover by Adolf Hitler and the Nazis in 1933. They introduced a highly aggressive foreign policy in alliance with Italy and Japan. The British and French tried to appease in 1938, which only whetted Hitler's appetite for more territory, especially in the East. Nazi Germany had by far the most decisive role in starting World War II in 1939. Since 1945, Germany has recovered from massive wartime destruction to become again the richest and most powerful country in Europe, this time it is fully integrated into European affairs. Its major conflict was West Germany versus East Germany, with East Germany being a client state of the Soviet Union until the collapse of the Soviet Union. Since the 1970s, (West) Germany has also sought to play a more important role internationally again. 1871‚Äì1919 =Military role in the foreign policy = After the creation of the German Empire in 1871, diplomatic relations were handled by the Imperial government, rather than by lower-level governments such as the Prussian and Bavarian governments. Down to 1914, the Chancellor typically dominated foreign policy decisions, supported by his Foreign Minister. The powerful German Army reported separately to the Emperor, and increasingly played a major role in shaping foreign policy when military alliances or warfare was at issue.Gordon A. Craig, The politics of the Prussian army 1640-1945 (1955) 255-98. In diplomatic terms, Germany used the Prussian system of military attaches attached to diplomatic locations, with highly talented young officers assigned to evaluate the strengths, weaknesses, and military capabilities of their assigned nations. These officers used close observation, conversations, and paid agents to produce very high quality reports that gave a significant advantage to the military planners.James Stone, \\"Spies and diplomats in Bismarck‚Äôs Germany: collaboration between military intelligence and the Foreign Office, 1871‚Äì1881.\\" Journal of Intelligence History (2014) 13#1 pp: 22‚Äì40. The military staff grew increasingly powerful, reducing the role of the Minister of War and increasingly asserting itself in foreign policy decisions. Otto von Bismarck, the Imperial Chancellor from 1871 to 1890, was annoyed by military interference in foreign policy affairs‚Äìin 1887, for example, the military tried to convince the Emperor to declare war on Russia; they also encouraged Austria to attack Russia. Bismarck never controlled the army, but he did complain vehemently, and the military leaders drew back. In 1905, when the Morocco affair was roiling international politics, Chief of the German General Staff Alfred von Schlieffen called for a preventive war against France. At a critical point in the July crisis of 1914, Helmuth von Moltke, the Chief of Staff, without telling the Emperor or Chancellor, advised his counterpart in Austria to mobilize against Russia at once. During World War I, Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and General Erich Ludendorff increasingly set foreign policy, working directly with the Emperor‚Äìand indeed shaped his decision-making‚Äìleaving the chancellor and civilian officials in the dark. Historian Gordon A. Craig says that the crucial decisions in going to war in 1914, \\"were made by the soldiers and that, in making them, they displayed an almost complete disregard for political considerations.\\"Craig, pp 268-70, 283, 293. Quotation page 294. =Bismarck= The Triple Alliance (1913-configuration, shown in red) was constructed to isolate France. Bismarck's post-1871 foreign policy was peace-oriented. Germany was content‚Äîit had all it wanted so that its main goal was peace and stability. However, peaceful relations with France became impossible in 1871 when Germany annexed the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine. Public opinion demanded it to humiliate France, and the Army wanted its more defensible frontiers. Bismarck reluctantly gave in‚ÄîFrench would never forget or forgive, he calculated, so might as well take the provinces. (That was a mistaken assumption‚Äîafter about five years the French did calm down and considered it a minor issue.)) Germany's foreign policy fell into a trap with no exit. \\"In retrospect it is easy to see that the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine was a tragic mistake.\\"See also and Once the annexation took place the only policy that made sense was trying to isolate France so it had no strong allies. However France complicated Berlin's plans when it became friends with Russia. In 1905 a German plan for an alliance with Russia fell through because Russia was too close to France.John Keiger, France and the World since 1870 (2001) pp 111-117. The League of Three Emperors (Dreikaisersbund) was signed in 1872 by Russia, Austria, and Germany. It stated that republicanism and socialism were common enemies and that the three powers would discuss any matters concerning foreign policy. Bismarck needed good relations with Russia in order to keep France isolated. In 1877‚Äì1878, Russia fought a victorious war with the Ottoman Empire and attempted to impose the Treaty of San Stefano on it. This upset the British in particular, as they were long concerned with preserving the Ottoman Empire and preventing a Russian takeover of the Bosphorus Strait. Germany hosted the Congress of Berlin (1878), whereby a more moderate peace settlement was agreed to. Germany had no direct interest in the Balkans, however, which was largely an Austrian and Russian sphere of influence, although King Carol of Romania was a German prince. The Dual Alliance in 1914, Germany in blue and Austria-Hungary in red =Dual Alliance (1879) with Austria-Hungary= In 1879, Bismarck formed a Dual Alliance of Germany and Austria-Hungary, with the aim of mutual military assistance in the case of an attack from Russia, which was not satisfied with the agreement reached at the Congress of Berlin. The establishment of the Dual Alliance led Russia to take a more conciliatory stance, and in 1887, the so-called Reinsurance Treaty was signed between Germany and Russia: in it, the two powers agreed on mutual military support in the case that France attacked Germany, or in case of an Austrian attack on Russia. Russia turned its attention eastward to Asia and remained largely inactive in European politics for the next 25 years. In 1882, Italy joined the Dual Alliance to form a Triple Alliance. Italy wanted to defend its interests in North Africa against France's colonial policy. In return for German and Austrian support, Italy committed itself to assisting Germany in the case of a French military attack. German colonies and protectorates in 1914 =German colonial empire= For a long time, Bismarck had refused to give in widespread public and elite demands to give Germany \\"a place in the sun\\" through the acquisition of overseas colonies. In 1880 Bismarck gave way, and a number of colonies were established overseas building on private German business ventures. In Africa, these were Togo, the Cameroons, German South-West Africa, and German East Africa; in Oceania, they were German New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago, and the Marshall Islands. In fact, it was Bismarck himself who helped initiate the Berlin Conference of 1885. He did it to \\"establish international guidelines for the acquisition of African territory\\" (see Colonisation of Africa). This conference was an impetus for the \\"Scramble for Africa\\" and \\"New Imperialism\\".Hartmut Pogge Von Strandmann, \\"Domestic origins of Germany's colonial expansion under Bismarck.\\" Past & Present 42 (1969): 140-159. online Hans-Ulrich Wehler, \\"Bismarck's Imperialism 1862-1890.\\" Past & Present 48 (1970): 119-155 online. =Kaiser Wilhelm= After removing Bismarck in 1890 the young Kaiser Wilhelm sought aggressively to increase Germany's influence in the world (Weltpolitik).Brandenburg, From Bismarck to the World War: A History of German Foreign Policy 1870-1914 (1927) pp 20-52. Foreign policy was in the hands of an erratic Kaiser, who played an increasingly reckless hand,On the Kaiser's \\"histrionic personality disorder\\", see and the powerful foreign office under the leadership of Friedrich von Holstein. The foreign office argued that: first, a long-term coalition between France and Russia had to fall apart; secondly, Russia and Britain would never get together; and, finally, Britain would eventually seek an alliance with Germany. Germany refused to renew its treaties with Russia. But Russia did form a closer relationship with France in the Dual Alliance of 1894, since both were worried about the possibilities of German aggression. Furthermore, Anglo‚ÄìGerman relations cooled as Germany aggressively tried to build a new empire and engaged in a naval race with Britain; London refused to agree to the formal alliance that Germany sought. Berlin's analysis proved mistaken on every point, leading to Germany's increasing isolation and its dependence on the Triple Alliance, which brought together Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. The Triple Alliance was undermined by differences between Austria and Italy, and in 1915 Italy switched sides. Meanwhile, the German Navy under Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz had ambitions to rival the great British Navy, and dramatically expanded its fleet in the early 20th century to protect the colonies and exert power worldwide. Tirpitz started a programme of warship construction in 1898. In 1890, Germany had gained the island of Heligoland in the North Sea from Britain in exchange for the eastern African island of Zanzibar, and proceeded to construct a great naval base there. This posed a direct threat to British hegemony on the seas, with the result that negotiations for an alliance between Germany and Britain broke down. The British, however, kept well ahead in the naval race by the introduction of the highly advanced new Dreadnought battleship in 1907. Two crises in Morocco In the First Moroccan Crisis of 1905, Germany nearly came to blows with Britain and France when the latter attempted to establish a protectorate over Morocco. The Germans were upset at having not been informed about French intentions, and declared their support for Moroccan independence. William II made a highly provocative speech regarding this. The following year, a conference was held in which all of the European powers except Austria-Hungary (by now little more than a German satellite) sided with France. A compromise was brokered by the United States where the French relinquished some, but not all, control over Morocco. The Second Moroccan Crisis of 1911 saw another dispute over Morocco erupt when France tried to suppress a revolt there. Germany, still smarting from the previous quarrel, agreed to a settlement whereby the French ceded some territory in central Africa in exchange for Germany's renouncing any right to intervene in Moroccan affairs. It was a diplomatic triumph for France.Brandenburg, From Bismarck to the World War: A History of German Foreign Policy 1870-1914 (1927) pp 370-93. Historian Heather Jones argues that Germany's use of warlike rhetoric was a deliberate diplomatic ploy: :Another German strategy was to stage dramatic gestures, and dangerously play up the threat of war, in the belief that this would impress upon other European powers the importance of consultation with Germany on imperial issues: the fact that France had not considered it necessary to make a bilateral agreement with Germany over Morocco rankled, especially given Germany was deeply insecure about its newly acquired Great Power status. Hence Germany opted for an increase in belligerent rhetoric and, theatrically, Kaiser Wilhelm II dramatically interrupted a Mediterranean cruise to visit Tangier, where he declared Germany's support for the Sultan's independence and integrity of his kingdom, turning Morocco overnight into an international 'crisis.' Heather Jones, \\"Algeciras Revisited: European Crisis and Conference Diplomacy, 16 January-7 April 1906.\\" (EUI WorkingPaper MWP 2009/1, 2009), p 5 online The German adventure resulted in failure and frustration, as military cooperation and friendship between France and Britain was strengthened, and Germany was left more isolated. An even more momentous consequence was the heightened sense of frustration and readiness for war in Germany. It spread beyond the political elite to much of the press and most of the political parties except for the Liberals and Social Democrats on the left. The Pan- German element grew in strength and denounced their government's retreat as treason, stepping up chauvinistic support for war.Immanuel Geiss, German Foreign Policy 1871 ‚Äì 1914 (1976) 133-36. =First World War= Ethnic groups demanded their own nation states, threatening violence. This upset the stability of multinational empires (Germany, Russia, Austria-Hungary, Turkey/Ottoman). When ethnic Serbians assassinate the Austrian heir, Austria decided to heavily punish Serbia. Germany stood behind its ally Austria in a confrontation with Serbia, but Serbia was under the informal protection of Russia, which was allied to France. Germany was the leader of the Central Powers, which included Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and later Bulgaria; arrayed against them were the Allies, consisting chiefly of Russia, France, Britain, and in 1915 Italy.Ren√© Albrecht-Carri√©, A Diplomatic History of Europe Since the Congress of Vienna (1958), pp 299-332. In explaining why neutral Britain went to war with Germany, Kennedy (1980) recognized it was critical for war that Germany become economically more powerful than Britain, but he downplays the disputes over economic trade imperialism, the Baghdad Railway, confrontations in Central and Eastern Europe, high-charged political rhetoric and domestic pressure-groups. Germany's reliance time and again on sheer power, while Britain increasingly appealed to moral sensibilities, played a role, especially in seeing the invasion of Belgium as a profound moral and diplomatic crime. Kennedy argues that by far the main reason was London's fear that a repeat of 1870 ‚Äî when Prussia and the German states smashed France ‚Äî would mean that Germany, with a powerful army and navy, would control the English Channel and northwest France. British policy makers insisted that would be a catastrophe for British security. =German war goals= The Germans never finalized a set of war aims. However, in September 1914, Kurt Riezler, a senior staff aide to German Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg sketched out some possible ideas‚Äîdubbed by historians the \\"September Program.\\" It emphasized economic gains, turning all of Central and Western Europe into a common market controlled by and for the benefit of Germany Belgium would become a vassal state, there would be a series of naval bases threatening England, Germany would seize much of Eastern Europe from Russia ‚Äì as in fact it did in early 1918. There would be a crippling financial indemnity on France making it economically dependent on Germany. The Netherlands would become a dependent satellite, and British commerce would be excluded. Germany would rebuild a colonial empire in Africa. The ideas sketched by Riezler were not fully formulated, were not endorsed by Bethmann- Hollweg, and were not presented to or approved by any official body. The ideas were formulated on the run after the war began, and did not mean these ideas had been reflected a prewar plan, as historian Fritz Fischer fallaciously assumed. However they do indicate that if Germany had won it would have taken a very aggressive dominant position in Europe. Indeed, it took a very harsh position on occupied Belgian and France starting in 1914, and in the Treaty of Brest Litovsk imposed on Russia in 1918.Tombs, The English and their history (2014) p 611.Wayne C. Thompson, \\"The September Program: Reflections on the Evidence.\\" Central European History 11.4 (1978): 348-354. The stalemate by the end of 1914 forced serious consideration of long-term goals. Britain, France, Russia and Germany all separately concluded this was not a traditional war with limited goals. Britain, France and Russia became committed to the destruction of German military power, and Germany to the dominance of German military power in Europe. One month into the war, Britain, France and Russia agreed not to make a separate peace with Germany, and discussions began about enticing other countries to join in return for territorial gains. However, as Barbara Jelavich observes, \\"Throughout the war Russian actions were carried out without real coordination or joint planning with the Western powers.\\"Barbara Jelavich, St. Petersburg and Moscow: Tsarist and Soviet foreign policy, 1814-1974 (1974) pp. 281‚Äì84. There was no serious three-way coordination of strategy, nor was there much coordination between Britain and France before 1917. 1919‚Äì1933 =Weimar Republic= The humiliating peace terms in the Treaty of Versailles provoked bitter indignation throughout Germany, and seriously weakened the new democratic regime since Paul von Hindenburg the president of Weimar Republic used article 48 to gain emergency power hence undermining democracy. When Germany defaulted on its reparation payments, French and Belgian troops occupied the heavily industrialised Ruhr district (January 1923). The German government encouraged the population of the Ruhr to passive resistance: shops would not sell goods to the foreign soldiers, coal-mines would not dig for the foreign troops, trams in which members of the occupation army had taken seat would be left abandoned in the middle of the street. The passive resistance proved effective, insofar as the occupation became a loss-making deal for the French government. But the Ruhr fight also led to hyperinflation, and many who lost all their fortune would become bitter enemies of the Weimar Republic, and voters of the anti- democratic right. See 1920s German inflation. Germany was the first state to establish diplomatic relations with the new Soviet Union. Under the Treaty of Rapallo, Germany accorded the Soviet Union de jure recognition, and the two signatories mutually cancelled all pre-war debts and renounced war claims. In October 1925 the Treaty of Locarno was signed by Germany, France, Belgium, Britain and Italy; it recognised Germany's borders with France and Belgium. Moreover, Britain, Italy and Belgium undertook to assist France in the case that German troops marched into the demilitarised Rheinland. Locarno paved the way for Germany's admission to the League of Nations in 1926.Wolfgang Elz, \\"Foreign policy\\" in Anthony McElligott, ed., Weimar Germany (2009) pp 50-77 =Nazi era, 1933-39= Hitler came to power in January 1933, and inaugurated an aggressive power designed to give Germany economic and political domination across central Europe. He did not attempt to recover the lost colonies. Until August 1939, the Nazis denounced Communists and the Soviet Union as the greatest enemy, along with the Jews. Axis cooperation in 1938 Hitler's diplomatic strategy in the 1930s was to make seemingly reasonable demands, threatening war if they were not met. When opponents tried to appease him, he accepted the gains that were offered, then went to the next target. That aggressive strategy worked as Germany pulled out of the League of Nations (1933), rejected the Versailles Treaty and began to re-arm (1935), won back the Saar (1935), remilitarized the Rhineland (1936), formed an alliance (\\"axis\\") with Mussolini's Italy (1936), sent massive military aid to Franco in the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì39), seized Austria (1938), took over Czechoslovakia after the British and French appeasement of the Munich Agreement of 1938, formed a peace pact with Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union in August 1939, and finally invaded Poland in September 1939. Britain and France declared war and World War II began ‚Äì somewhat sooner than the Nazis expected or were ready for.Gerhard L. Weinberg, Hitler's foreign policy 1933-1939: The road to World War II. (2013), Originally published in two volumes. After establishing the \\"Rome-Berlin axis\\" with Benito Mussolini, and signing the Anti-Comintern Pact with Japan ‚Äì which was joined by Italy a year later in 1937 ‚Äì Hitler felt able to take the offensive in foreign policy. On 12 March 1938, German troops marched into Austria, where an attempted Nazi coup had been unsuccessful in 1934. When Austrian-born Hitler entered Vienna, he was greeted by loud cheers. Four weeks later, 99% of Austrians voted in favour of the annexation (Anschluss) of their country Austria to the German Reich. After Austria, Hitler turned to Czechoslovakia, where the 3.5 million-strong Sudeten German minority was demanding equal rights and self-government. At the Munich Conference of September 1938, Hitler, the Italian leader Benito Mussolini, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and French Prime Minister √âdouard Daladier agreed upon the cession of Sudeten territory to the German Reich by Czechoslovakia. Hitler thereupon declared that all of German Reich's territorial claims had been fulfilled. However, hardly six months after the Munich Agreement, in March 1939, Hitler used the smoldering quarrel between Slovaks and Czechs as a pretext for taking over the rest of Czechoslovakia as the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. In the same month, he secured the return of Memel from Lithuania to Germany. Chamberlain was forced to acknowledge that his policy of appeasement towards Hitler had failed. =World War II= Germany's foreign policy during the war involved the creation of allied governments under direct or indirect control from Berlin.Gerhard L. Weinberg, A world at arms: a global history of World War II (1995), provides a thorough diplomatic history. A main goal was obtaining soldiers from the senior allies, such as Italy and Hungary, and millions of workers and ample food supplies from subservient allies such as Vichy France.Mark Mazower, Hitler's Empire: How the Nazis Ruled Europe (2009) ch 9 By the fall of 1942, there were 24 divisions from Romania on the Eastern Front, 10 from Italy and 10 from Hungary.Gerhard L. Weinberg, A World at Arms: A Global History of World War II (2005) p 414 When a country was no longer dependable, Germany would assume full control, as it did with France in 1942, Italy in 1943, and Hungary in 1944. Full control allowed the Nazis to achieve their high priority of mass murdering all Jewish population. Although Japan was officially a powerful ally, the relationship was distant and there was little coordination or cooperation, such as Germany's refusal to share the secret formula for making synthetic oil from coal until late in the war. Hitler devoted most of his attention during the war to military and diplomatic affairs. DiNardo argues that in Europe Germany's foreign-policy was dysfunctional during the war, as Hitler treated each ally separately, and refused to create any sort of combined staff that would synchronize policies, armaments, and strategies. Italy, Finland, Romania, and Hungary each dealt with Berlin separately, and never coordinated their activities. Germany was reluctant to share its powerful weapons systems, or to train Axis officers. There were some exceptions, such as the close collaboration between the German and Italian forces in North Africa.Richard L. DiNardo, \\"The dysfunctional coalition: The axis powers and the eastern front in World War II,\\" Journal of Military History (1996) 60#4 pp 711‚Äì730Richard L. DiNardo, Germany and the Axis Powers: From Coalition to Collapse (2005) =Postwar= Since 1951, Germany has been at the heart of European integration. The reunification in 1990, which saw East Germany merged into West Germany, promoted peaceful integration with its neighbors. Strong ties with the United States remain central to German foreign policy. Within the framework of NATO and an integrated European Union Military Staff, the Federal Republic has resumed the deployment of military units to mediate in conflict regions worldwide. Germany is one of the world's strongest supporters for ecological awareness in response to climate change and global warming. =1945‚Äì1990= ;Westbindung \\"Bindung\\" is the German word for fixation or bond; \\"Westbindung\\" is Germany's implant into Europe and the Western World. In particular during the Cold War ‚Äì but continuous into the 21st century ‚Äì (West-) German foreign policy pursues the country's integration into NATO and a strong co-operation and collective security with its Western partners. As a free democracy and market economy, the world's largest exporting nation and the world's third-richest economy (nominal GDP) (behind the U.S. and Japan), Germany shares the interest and institutions of a free and secure world trade. ;Ostpolitik Under the Hallstein Doctrine, the FRG did not have any diplomatic relations with countries in Eastern Bloc until the early 1970s, when Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik led to increased dialogue and treaties like the Treaty of Warsaw, where West Germany accepted the Oder- Neisse line as German-Polish border, and the Basic Treaty, where West and East Germany accepted each other as sovereign entities. Both Germany states were admitted to the United Nations on 18 September 1973.  German Question and German Problem  Ever since the creation of the consolidated German nation state in 1871, the German Problem as to what interests, ambitions, and borders Germany would have and how it would fit into the international system, was a major concern not just for the neighbours but also for German policy-makers themselves. This Problem was temporarily suspended during the Cold War as with Germany being a divided nation, the question as to how to reunify the country (the German Question) would take precedence over other considerations. During the Cold War, both Germanys also lacked the power to challenge the system more generally. =1990‚Äìpresent= Leaders of the 33rd G8 summit in Heiligendamm, Germany After the Fall of the Berlin Wall and the Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany, German reunification took effect on 3 October 1990. On 14 November 1990, Germany and Poland signed a treaty confirming the Oder-Neisse line. They also concluded a cooperation treaty on 17 June 1991. Germany concluded four treaties with the Soviet Union covering the overall bilateral relationship, economic relations, the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the territory of the former German Democratic Republic, and German support for those troops. Russia accepted obligations under these treaties as successor to the Soviet Union.

Samsung DeX is a feature included on some high-end Samsung handheld devices that enables users to extend their device into a desktop-like experience by connecting a keyboard, mouse, and monitor. The name \\"DeX\\" is a contraction of \\"Desktop eXperience\\". Samsung first included the DeX feature on Samsung's Galaxy S8 and S8+ smartphones, and has continued to support the feature on all of its latest flagship smartphones, including the Galaxy S9, S10, S20, Note8, Note9 and Note10 series and Note20 series.The Galaxy A90 5G is the first Galaxy A phone with DeX support. It has also been introduced on several high-end tablets, including the Galaxy Tab S4, S5e, Tab S6, Tab 7 and S7+.  History  The original version of DeX required the use of a docking accessory called the DeX Station. This provided a USB-C port, ethernet, HDMI 2.0 output and two USB 2.0 ports. With the launch of the Note 9 in August 2018, Samsung introduced the DeX HDMI adapter, cable and multiport adapter, eliminating the need for the previous docking accessories. Whilst connected to a display, the device itself can function as a touchpad or continue being used in its usual fashion whilst DeX is operating. With the Note 10 and Galaxy Fold, DeX can now be launched via a direct cable connection to a physical computer using the existing charging cable, eliminating the need for any docking accessories. DeX has also been used in the public safety setting to replace in-vehicle laptops. Samsung also announced \\"Linux on Galaxy\\" (since renamed to \\"Linux on DeX\\") which allows use of a compatible Linux distribution rather than the default Android OS giving full personal computer capabilities. The DeX Desktop can also be accessed with a downloadable app for Windows and Mac OS or through third party accessories like the Melopow Dock. Users are able to connect to their mobile devices with a USB Cable. Samsung DeX devices can be managed by Samsung Knox (3.3 and higher) to allow or restrict access using the Knox platform for added control and security. In October 2019 Samsung announced that Linux on DeX will not be available for Android 10 and warned users that after upgrade to Android 10 they will not be able to downgrade back, permanently losing the ability to use full Linux applications.

Italy (2015), ECHR Case No. 39294/09 was a decision made by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) that specifically addressed anti-judicial speech. The case involved Piero Antonio Peruzzi, an Italian lawyer, who was initially sentenced to four years in prison by the Lucca District Court for defaming a judge. Peruzzi appealed this decision to the Appellate Court of Genoa and was instead fined and required to pay an additional sum to the judge subject to his criticism. On May 25, 2009, Peruzzi brought the case to the European Court of Human Rights, claiming that his conviction was a violation of Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights (freedom of expression). On June 30, 2015, the European Court of Human Rights made the decision that the conviction of Peruzzi by the Genoa Court was not disproportionate and that his Article 10 rights to freedom of expression were not violated. Background of the case In 2001, Mr. Peruzzi wrote a letter to the Supreme Council of the Judiciary criticizing the conduct of a specific Judge of the Lucca District Court, ‚ÄòJudge X‚Äô, who was involved in one of Peruzzi's litigations regarding the division of an estate. Following this, Peruzzi then wrote a circulatory letter allegedly criticizing the improper behaviour of judges in general. Peruzzi's first letter was essentially reproduced in his second, giving details about the decisions adopted by the Judge X, although Peruzzi did not specifically refer to Judge X in the second letter. While the first part of the circular letter gave details about the inheritance case, the second part was dedicated to denouncing judges in general, indicating concern that there are judges who commit errors willfully and maliciously through negligence or lack of commitment ‚Äú...non pu√≤ e non deve sbagliarsi volontariamente, con dolo o colpa grave o per imperizia...‚Äù. Although Peruzzi did not refer directly to Judge X in the circulatory letter, it was evident that the criticism was aimed at Judge X specifically. In 2005, Peruzzi was sentenced to four years of prison by the Lucca District Court for defamation and insult. The Court came to this decision after they determined that Peruzzi overstepped his right to criticize, as he threatened the honour of Judge X by claiming that the Judge made such errors intentionally. In 2007, Peruzzi appealed the Lucca District Court's decision to the Appellate Court of Genoa which concluded that since there was no punishment for insult, Peruzzi would instead be fined ‚Ç¨400. Additionally, Peruzzi was required to compensate Judge X ‚Ç¨15,000. In May 2009, Peruzzi brought the case to the European Court of Human Rights, declaring that his conviction was a violation of Article 10. Majority Opinion Judgment was given by seven ECHR judges, Hirvel√§, Raimondi (President), Nicolaou, Bianku, Mahoney, Krzysztof Wojtyczek, and Yonko Grozev. The Court considered whether or not Piero Antonio Peruzzi's rights under Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights were violated. The majority came down to a 5-2 decision holding that Peruzzi's conviction did not violate his freedom of speech rights. Mr. Peruzzi's argument that the criticisms expressed in his letter were not directed specifically at Judge X but rather at the Italian judicial system, in general, was rejected. The majority could not fail to interpret Peruzzi's letter as specific denunciation of Judge X's behaviour. The Court then had to determine whether or not Peruzzi's letter overstepped the limits of criticism in a democratic society. The majority determined that Peruzzi had overstepped his right to free expression with specific statements, aimed at Judge X, such as: :1. ‚Äúper partito preso, magari con l‚Äôuso dell‚Äôarroganza‚Ä¶decidere con totale disinteresse e disimpegno‚Äù ::‚ÄúBias with the use of arrogance‚Ä¶complete disinterest and disengagement‚Äù :2. ‚ÄúIl giudice √® un uomo e pu√≤ commettere errori‚Ä¶, ma non pu√≤ e non deve sbagliarsi volontariamente, con dolo o colpa grave o per imperizia‚Äù ::‚ÄúThe judge is a man and can therefore make errors‚Ä¶but it can not and should not be voluntarily mistaken with intent of gross negligence or incompetence‚Äù. The initial criticism of Judge X made by Peruzzi, that he adopted unjust decisions, was not deemed excessive. However, the second criticism stating that Judge X had willfully committed errors with malicious intent or even negligence implied that Judge X abandoned his ethical responsibilities as a judge, and was deemed excessive as the defendant provided no useful evidence demonstrating Judge X's malice. Mr. Peruzzi did not wait to hear the outcome of his case against Judge X from the Supreme Council of the Judiciary before circulating the letter. The majority noted that rather than presenting these claims at the hearing of the inheritance case, Peruzzi circulated his letter in a context that was unrelated to the proceedings, which was inevitably bound to undermine Judge X's credibility and reputation. Peruzzi's sentence was reduced from four years of prison to ‚Ç¨400. The ‚Ç¨400 fine and ‚Ç¨15,000 compensation fee for Judge X were not deemed excessive by the majority. The Court concluded that the penalty imposed on Peruzzi was not disproportionate to the case and that the Italian court had done a sufficient job in justifying their decision. The interference with Peruzzi's right to freedom of expression could be considered ‚Äúnecessary in a democratic society‚Äù in order to maintain impartiality in the judiciary. The Court stated that there was no violation of this right, Article 10&2 ‚Äú2. L‚Äôesercizio di queste libert√†... pu√≤ essere sottoposto alle formalit√†, condizioni, restrizioni o sanzioni che sono previste dalla legge e che costituiscono misure necessarie, in una societ√† democratica... per garantire l‚Äôautorit√† e l‚Äôimparzialit√† del potere giudiziario‚Äù. Dissenting Opinion There were 2 dissenting opinions in this case. Judges Wojtyczek and Grozev wrote dissenting opinions on the same grounds. Neither judge could adhere to the view expressed by the majority according to which Article 10 of the Convention has not been violated in this case, ‚ÄúNon possiamo aderire al punto di vista espresso dalla maggioranza secondo il quale l‚Äôarticolo 10 della Convenzione non √® stato violato nella presente causa‚Äù. The applicant submitted a plea claiming that his freedom of expression had been infringed upon, and while it is important to justify the protection of others reputations in certain cases, it is crucial to find a balance between both rights in question. Interfering with either must be justified by appropriate and serious reasons. The Court identified in its case a number of factors that must be examined in order to determine whether a restriction on the freedom of expression is justified, (see, Vonn Hannover v. Germany, Nos. 40660/08 and 60641/08, and Axel Springer AG v. Germany no. 39954/08). The Italian court took these different factors into account but as interpreted by Wojtyczek and Grozev, the reasons given by the national court were not satisfactory with regards to Article 10, as they did not provide relevant or compelling reasons to justify interference in freedom of expression. Wojtyczek and Grozev further stated that the majority failed to consider elements such as the content of the disputed claims, and whether or not the person subject to criticism has been cited by name, having been clearly accused of facts that could be damaging to their reputation. The fact that the name of Judge X was not explicitly mentioned may lessen the scope of the claims made by Peruzzi. Likewise, the probable consequences of the accusations must be also considered. According to Wojtyczek and Grozev, neither the national courts nor the majority examined these elements to the necessary extent. Since Peruzzi did not specifically refer to Judge X by name, he left room for ambiguity regarding the identity of Judge X. The claims were addressed to a group of judges accustomed to receiving various forms of complaints and criticisms by unhappy individuals or lawyers, rather than the public, which was not aware of the content of the statements circulated to the judges. Typically these complaints have no effect on the reputation of the judge in question. Wojtyczek and Grozev support that the letter circulated by Peruzzi likely had no real impact on the image of Judge X. Overall, Judges Wojtyczek and Grozev concluded that the penalty imposed was manifestly disproportionate due to the nature of the claims made and the very small group of persons to whom they were addressed. The majority claimed that it was necessary to convict Peruzzi in order to uphold integrity and authority in the Italian judiciary, however, the dissenting judges viewed Peruzzi's conviction as a decision that would produce the opposite of the intended effect. Subsequent Developments The decision made by the European Court of Human Rights regarding the case of Peruzzi v. Italy is among several similar ECHR decisions regarding anti- judicial speech (e.g. Karpetas v. Greece). Many constitutional courts in the world have yet to determine where the line should be drawn between acceptable criticism of judicial performance and unlawful threats to judicial independence. Previously, the ECHR was inconsistent in its responses to this issue, but started to err on the side of speech protection following the cases of Barfod v. Denmark and Prager v. Austria. The ECHR continues to work on developing a strategy for distinguishing anti-judicial speech that is acceptable under Article 10 from anti-judicial speech that is threatening or harmful in a way that exceeds the limits of one's freedom of speech.

According to a 2013 retrospective article, in the Vancouver Sun, this was Vancouver's worst disaster, at the time it occurred. The ship was owned by the Park Steamship Company, which was owned by Canada's Federal government. The government had built 400 vessels during World War II. She was named after an actual park in Nova Scotia. Built as a merchant steamship constructed for Canada‚Äôs Merchant Navy in 1943 during the Second World War as part of Canada's Park ship program. She was operated for the Government by Canada Shipping Company. Explosion at Vancouver The ship's cargo included 85 or 95 tons of sodium chlorate, commonly used as a fertilizer, but one of the fertilizers that, under certain conditions, can be a powerful high explosive. Observers saw three explosions, and, initially, it was believed that portions of the ship's cargo of sodium chlorate exploded. Her cargo also included six tons of flares, and barrels of overproof whiskey. The ship was being loaded at a Canadian Pacific Railway pier, and six longshoremen, and two seamen, lost their lives. Windows were broken all over Vancouver's downtown. Vancouver firefighters could not extinguish the blaze, so they beached her, near Siwash Rock, in Stanley Park, to prevent her drifting into other vessels, and setting them on fire. The Vancouver Sun reported that, eventually, some longshoremen confessed that they had clandestinely tapped the whisky barrels, and it was the spilled whisky that was accidentally ignited, and started the fire. John Stanton, reporting in the Northern Mariner, wrote that the whisky was 60 percent alcohol -- fifty percent more alcohol than normal whisky. He wrote that those unfamiliar with it may not have understood that the fumes from overproof alcohol are far more volatile, and explosive, than regular whisky. Reconstruction and renaming A typical cargo Park ship. Launch of SS Ashby Park at the Pictou Shipyard in 1944 Green Hill Park was severely damaged, but she was repaired, sold off, and operated again under Panamaian ownership as Phaeax II.

Both nations are members of the Francophonie and the United Nations. History =French Colonialism= General Charles de Gaulle in Bangui, 1940. During the Partition of Africa in the 1880s, Belgium, Germany and France each competed against each other in order to control territory north of the Ubangi River. In 1903, France named its new colony 'Ubangi-Shari' and in 1910, France incorporated the territory along with four other colonies (French Congo, Gabon, Chad and French Cameroon) into one colonial federation known as the French Equatorial Africa.Encyclopedia Britannica: Central African Republic - The Colonial Era Initially, the French government leased large parts of land for European companies and forced the local population to gather wild rubber, hunt for ivory and animal skins, and work on plantations. Due to forced exploitation by the French colonial empire, Central African locals began to rebel in the early 20th century which led to the Kongo-Wara rebellion (1928-1931). The rebellion was soon suppressed by the French government. During World War II, Central African soldiers formed part of the grand French colonial army (Troupes coloniales) and fought for Free France and partook in the Liberation of Paris. In October 1940, General Charles de Gaulle arrived to Bangui to visit Governor Pierre Marie de Saint-Mart and review the troops.Historical Dictionary of the Central African Republic: Saint-Mart, Pierre Marie de =Independence= Soon after the second World War, France adopted a new constitution in 1946 and granted full French citizenship to residents of the Ubangi-Shari and allowed for the establishment of local assemblies within the new French Union. In December 1958, former Catholic Priest Barth√©lemy Boganda became head of government of the Ubangi-Shari Territory. In March 1959, Boganda's was killed when his airplane exploded and he was replaced by his cousin, David Dacko. On 13 August 1960, Ubangi-Shari obtained its independence from France and changed its name to the Central African Republic (CAR) and David Dacko became the country's first President. =Post Independence= In December 1965, a coup d'√©tat was launched against President Dacko known as the Saint-Sylvestre coup d'√©tat (with the assistance of France) and Army Commander Jean-B√©del Bokassa declared himself President of CAR. In 1975, French President Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing attended the France-Africa Summit held in Bangui.Les 24 sommets France-Afrique (1973-1981) (in French) President Giscard was known to visit the country several times and partook in hunting expeditions with Bokassa.Jean-Bedel Bokassa, Self-Crowned Emperor Of the Central African Republic, Dies at 75 In December 1976, President Bokassa declared himself Emperor of the Central African Republic and his coronation amounted to approx. $20 million USD, which was equivalent to the GDP of the nation for an entire year. The French government paid for the Emperors coronation.Children of Monsters: An Inquiry into the Sons and Daughters of Dictators Due to widespread repression, human rights abuse and allegations of cannibalism in CAR by Emperor Bokassa, France removed Bokassa from power known as Operation Barracuda when the Emperor was on an official trip in Libya. David Dacko was re-instated as President of CAR and Bokassa was later offered asylum in France. In October 1979, French Newspaper, Le Canard encha√Æn√© ran a piece stating that President Giscard had accepted two diamonds while Minister of Finance in 1973 by Bokassa. The scandal became known as the Diamonds Affair (Affaire des diamants).France's President Says He Sold Bokassa Jewels For the next 19 years, France would intervene in Central African politics by supporting and removing Central African Presidents. In 1997, Central African President Ange-F√©lix Patass√© negotiated the Bangui Agreements to bring an end to the 1990s conflict between government and rebel forces.

His grandson Bhimsen Thapa went on to become the Mukhtiyar of Nepal and founder of Thapa dynasty. Career When King Prithvi Narayan Shah annexed Nuwakot in 1744, he was one of the influential Bharadars. After the conquest of Naldum area, he along with Commander Shivaram Singh Basnyat conquered Sanga, Panauti, Sankhu and adjacent areas. The Gorkhali chronicle states that he was the commander of the Gorkhali forces. He commanded the Gorkhali troops during the capture of Kavre and Palanchowk with fellow commanders Chautariya Daljit Shah and Kaji Harka (Harsh) Pantha. He was deployed to Kaski allowing two Brahmins from there to reside in Kathmandu as a part of friendly diplomacy with the Kaski Kingdom. He commanded troops near the hill in Sindhuli against the English advance of Major Kinloch. Personal life He belonged to Bagale Thapa clan that migrated eastwards from Jumla. The Thapa genealogy states that Birabhadra was a grandson of Vikrama ThƒÅpƒÅ and son of Vijai ThƒÅpƒÅ. However, the Sardari annual reinstatement letter of his youngest son Amar Singh Thapa (sanu) on Chaitra 1855 B.S. mentioned him to be a son of Bikram Thapa of Bagale clan of Gorkha. Thus, Historian Baburam Acharya contends that Vijai ThƒÅpƒÅ could be an imaginary figure. Similarly, the Sundhara Inscription of his grandson Bhimsen Thapa, states that he was the son of Vikrama Thapa. He was the patron of leading Thapa Chhetri group (i.e. Thapa dynasty) in the Royal Court. He had three sons; Jeevan Thapa, Bangsha Raj Thapa and Amar Singh Thapa (sanu). His eldest son died in the Battle of Kantipur with powerful Kaji Kalu Pande. The seven sons of Amar Singh Thapa (sanu) - Bhimsen Thapa, Nain Singh Thapa, Bakhtawar Singh Thapa, Amrit Singh Thapa and Ranabir Singh Thapa, all participated and contributed in the expansion and unification of Nepal.

Royen came to prominence in the spring of 2017 for a relatively simple proof for the Gaussian Correlation Inequality (GCI), a conjecture that originated in the 1950s, which he had published three years earlier without much recognition., Royen's proof of the Gaussian correlation inequality, arXiv:1512.08776 A proof of this conjecture, which lies at the intersection of geometry, probability theory and statistics, had eluded top experts for decades. Life =Youth, studies and private life= Royen was born in 1947 to Paul Royen, a professor with the institute for inorganic chemistry at the Goethe University Frankfurt and Elisabeth Royen, also a chemist. From 1966 to 1971, he studied mathematics and physics at his father's university and the University of Freiburg. After graduating, he worked as a tutor at the University of Freiburg, before transferring to the Technical University of Dortmund for his doctoral thesis. After attaining his PhD in 1975 with a thesis called √úber die Konvergenz gegen stabile Gesetze (On Convergence Against Stable Laws), he worked as a wissenschaftlicher Assistent at Dortmund University's institute for statistics. Married with children, Royen lives in Schwalbach am Taunus. =Career= In 1977, Royen started working as a statistician for the pharmaceutical company Hoechst AG. From 1979 to 1985, he worked at the company's own educational facility teaching mathematics and statistics. Starting in 1985 until becoming an emeritus in 2010, he taught statistics and mathematics at the University of Applied Sciences Bingen in Rhineland-Palatinate. Royen worked mainly on probability distributions, in particular multivariate chi-squares and gamma distributions, to improve some frequently used statistical test procedures. Nearly half of his circa 30 publications were written when he was aged over sixty. Because he was annoyed over some contradictory reviews and in a few cases also over the incompetence of a referee, he decided in his later years, when his actions had no influence anymore on his further career, to publish his papers on the online platform arXiv.org and sometimes in a less renowned Indian journal to fulfill, at least formally, the condition of a peer review. =Proof of the Gaussian correlation inequality= On July 17, 2014, a few years after his retirement, when brushing his teeth, Royen had a flash of insight: how to use the Laplace transform of the multivariate gamma distribution to achieve a relatively simple proof for the Gaussian correlation inequality, a conjecture on the intersection of geometry, probability theory and statistics, formulated after work by Dunnett and Sobel (1955) and the American statistician Olive Jean Dunn (1958), that had remained unsolved since then. He sent a copy of his proof to Donald Richards, an acquainted American mathematician, who worked on a proof of the GCI for 30 years. Richards immediately saw the validity of Royen's proof and subsequently helped him to transform the mathematical formulas into LaTeX. When Royen contacted other reputed mathematicians, though, they didn't bother to investigate his proof, because Royen was relatively unknown, and these mathematicians therefore estimated the chance that Royen's proof would be false as very high. Royen published this proof in an article with the title A simple proof of the Gaussian correlation conjecture extended to multivariate gamma distributions on arXiv Supplemented by and subsequently in the Far East Journal of Theoretical Statistics,Thomas Royen: A simple proof of the Gaussian correlation conjecture extended to some multivariate gamma distributions, in: Far East Journal of Theoretical Statistics, Part 48 Nr. 2, Pushpa Publishing House, Allahabad 2014, p.139‚Äì145 a relatively unknown periodical based in Allahabad, India, for which Royen was at the time voluntarily working as a referee himself. Due to this, his proof went at first largely unnoticed by the scientific community,In the Quanta magazine article for instance Tilmann Gneiting, a statistician at the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies, just 65 miles from Bingen, said he was shocked to learn in July 2016, two years after the fact, that the GCI had been proved. until in late 2015 two Polish mathematicians, Rafa≈Ç Lata≈Ça and Dariusz Matlak, wrote a paper in which they reorganized Royen's proof in a way that was intended to be easier to follow. In July 2015, Royen supplemented his proof with a further paper in arXiv Some probability inequalities for multivariate gamma and normal distributions. On March 28, 2017 Natalie Wolchover of Quanta Magazine published a story about Royen's proof, after which he gained more academic and public recognition for his achievement.

His debut work, a science fiction horror novel titled Plane Walker, was released in April 2016. Dunphey is also a film reviewer, and founder of the small press Gehenna & Hinnom Books. Dunphey holds a bachelor's in English from the University of Southern Mississippi.  Early life  C. P. Dunphey was born in Staten Island, New York before moving to Brooklyn, New York. After his father received a job offer in Mississippi, Dunphey and his family moved to Meridian, Mississippi before settling in Picayune, Mississippi. From a very young age, Dunphey was fascinated with science fiction and horror, often filling composition notebooks front to back with space operas and horror stories. After graduating from Picayune Memorial High School, Dunphey would attend Pearl River Community College in Poplarville, Mississippi where he would receive his Associate's in Arts. Then he moved to Hattiesburg, Mississippi and received his Bachelor's in English from the University of Southern Mississippi.  Writing career  C. P. Dunphey's first credited publication was in December 2012 when he was 19 years old. The novel titled Lazarus, which would evolve into Plane Walker four years later, was released independently. From 2012-2016, Dunphey worked on the manuscript he originally self-published and ended up adding over a hundred pages of content while also having the manuscript undergo extensive professional edits and reconstruction. The publication of Plane Walker and the formation of Gehenna Publishing House followed a difficult period in Dunphey's life. In April 2016, the finished product of Plane Walker was released on Amazon. The novel received primarily positive reviews, Dunphey's writing being compared to that of Thomas Ligotti, H.P. Lovecraft, Philip K. Dick, and John Carpenter, among others. Dunphey's philosophical and often poetic language has been the center of most discussion. On the contrary, veteran science fiction magazine Amazing Stories felt the novel was \\"slow to start\\" and that it \\"focuses too much on minutia\\" even if the work itself was \\"well-written.\\" Plane Walker became a Five Star Reader's Favorite, a Pitch Perfect Pick winner on Underground Book Reviews, became a bestseller on Amazon in the genre of Hard Science fiction in May 2016.  Influences  C. P. Dunphey has cited several authors of being inspirations to him as an author. Most notably, he has called H. P. Lovecraft his favorite author while stating Frank Herbert's Dune as his favorite novel. Other inspirations that have been mentioned are H.P. Lovecraft, Thomas Ligotti, Stephen King, J.R.R. Tolkien, and others. Readers and reviewers have described Dunphey's style as poetic and lyrical while maintaining a horror and science fiction scope. Dunphey is also a self-proclaimed science fiction and horror nut, finding inspiration for his writing in such films as Event Horizon, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Jacob's Ladder, The Alien Franchise, The Terminator Franchise, and video game series such as Dead Space.

It has a single erect, hairy leaf and one or two cream-coloured flowers with red stripes. It is common but only in a restricted area of the state.  Description  Caladenia wanosa is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, hairy leaf, 30‚Äì60 mm long and about 3 mm wide. One or two cream-coloured flowers with red stripes, and 30‚Äì50 mm long, 30‚Äì40 mm wide are borne on a stalk 120‚Äì200 mm high. The sepals have thick, brownish, club-like glandular tips 3‚Äì6 mm long. The dorsal sepal is erect, 12‚Äì30 mm long and about 1 mm wide but curves forward. The lateral sepals are 12‚Äì30 mm long, about 1 mm wide and curve downwards. The petals are 20‚Äì22 mm long, about 1 mm wide and arranged like the lateral sepals. The labellum is 12‚Äì13 mm long, 8‚Äì10 mm wide and cream-coloured with wide red lines. The tip of the labellum is red, curls downward and there are two rows of club-shaped calli along the labellum mid-line. Flowering occurs from August to mid- September.  Taxonomy and naming  Caladenia wanosa was first formally described in 2001 by Alex George from a speciment collected north of the Murchison River and the description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (wanosa) is derived from the name of the Western Australian Native Orchid Study and Conservation Group.  Distribution and habitat  The Kalbarri spider orchid is found between the Murchison River and Eurardy Reserve growing in shrubland and mallee woodland. There are also small populations near Mullewa and Yuna in the Geraldton Sandplains biogeographic region. Conservation Caladenia wanosa is classified as \\"Threatened Flora (Declared Rare Flora ‚Äî Extant)\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife and as \\"vulnerable\\" by the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The main threats to the species are weed invasion and grazing by feral pigs (Sus scrofa), goats (Capra hircus), rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and sheep.

(2007) Sensory processing disorder (SPD; also known as sensory integration dysfunction) is a condition where multisensory integration is not adequately processed in order to provide appropriate responses to the demands of the environment. Sensory processing disorder is present in almost all people with autism spectrum disorders. Sensory integration was defined by occupational therapist Anna Jean Ayres in 1972 as \\"the neurological process that organizes sensation from one's own body and from the environment and makes it possible to use the body effectively within the environment\\". Sensory processing disorder has been characterized as the source of significant problems in organizing sensation coming from the body and the environment and is manifested by difficulties in the performance in one or more of the main areas of life: productivity, leisure and play or activities of daily living. Sources debate whether SPD is an independent disorder or represents the observed symptoms of various other, more well- established, disorders.Walbam, K. (2014). The Relevance of Sensory Processing Disorder to Social Work Practice: An Interdisciplinary Approach. Child & Adolescent Social Work Journal, 31(1), 61-70. doi:10.1007/s10560-013-0308-2 SPD is not included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association, and the American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended that pediatricians not use SPD as a stand-alone diagnosis.  Signs and symptoms  Sensory processing disorder (SPD) is characterized by persistent challenges with neurological processing of sensory stimuli. Such challenges can appear in one or several sensory systems: Somatosensory system, Vestibular system, Propioceptive system, Interoceptive system, Auditory system, Visual system, Olfactory system, and Gustatory system. While many people can present one or two symptoms, sensory processing disorder has to have a clear functional impact on the person's life: Signs of over- responsivity, including, for example, dislike of textures such as those found in fabrics, foods, grooming products or other materials found in daily living, to which most people would not react, and serious discomfort, sickness or threat induced by normal sounds, lights, ambient temperature, movements, smells, tastes, or even inner sensations such as heartbeat. Signs of under- responsivity, including sluggishness and lack of responsiveness; and Sensory cravings, including, for example, fidgeting, impulsiveness, and/or seeking or making loud, disturbing noises; Sensorimotor-based problems, including slow and uncoordinated movements or poor handwriting. Sensory discrimination problems, that might manifest themselves in behaviors such as things constantly dropped. Symptoms may vary according to the disorder's type and subtype present. = Relationship to other disorders = Sensory processing issues represent a feature of a number of disorders, including anxiety problems, ADHD, food intolerances, behavioral disorders, and particularly, autism spectrum disorders. This pattern of comorbidities poses a significant challenge to those who claim that SPD is an identifiably specific disorder, rather than simply a term given to a set of symptoms common to other disorders. Two studies have provided preliminary evidence suggesting that there may be measurable neurological differences between children diagnosed with SPD and control children classified as neurotypical or children diagnosed with autism. Despite this evidence, the fact that SPD researchers have yet to agree on a proven, standardized diagnostic tool undermines researchers' ability to define the boundaries of the disease and makes correlational studies, like those on structural brain abnormalities, less convincing.  Causes  The exact cause of SPD is not known. However, it is known that the midbrain and brainstem regions of the central nervous system are early centers in the processing pathway for multisensory integration; these brain regions are involved in processes including coordination, attention, arousal, and autonomic function. After sensory information passes through these centers, it is then routed to brain regions responsible for emotions, memory, and higher level cognitive functions. Damage in any part of the brain involved in multisensory processing can cause difficulties in adequately processing stimuli in a functional way. = Mechanism = Current research in sensory processing is focused on finding the genetic and neurological causes of SPD. EEG, measuring event-related potential (ERP) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are traditionally used to explore the causes behind the behaviors observed in SPD . Differences in tactile and auditory overresponsivity show moderate genetic influences, with tactile overresponsivity demonstrating greater heritability. Differences in auditory latency (the time between the input is received and when reaction is observed in the brain), hypersensitivity to vibration in the Pacinian corpuscles receptor pathways and other alterations in unimodal and multisensory processing have been detected in autism populations. People with sensory processing deficits appear to have less sensory gating than typical subjects, and atypical neural integration of sensory input. In people with sensory over responsivity different neural generators activation, causing the automatic association of causally related sensory inputs that occurs at this early sensory-perceptual stage to not function properly. People suffering from sensory over-responsivity might have increased D2 receptor in the striatum, related to aversion to tactile stimuli and reduced habituation. In animal models, prenatal stress significantly increased tactile avoidance. Recent research has also found an abnormal white matter microstructure in children with SPD, compared with typical children and those with other developmental disorders such as autism and ADHD. One hypothesis is that multisensory stimulation may activate a higher-level system in the frontal cortex that involves attention and cognitive processing, rather than the automatic integration of multisensory stimuli observed in typically developing adults in the auditory cortex.  Diagnosis  Sensory processing disorder is accepted in the Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC:0-3R). It is not recognized as a mental disorder in medical manuals such as the ICD-10ICD 10 or the DSM-5. Diagnosis is primarily arrived at by the use of standardized tests, standardized questionnaires, expert observational scales, and free-play observation at an occupational therapy gym. Observation of functional activities might be carried at school and home as well. Though diagnosis in most of the world is done by an occupational therapist, in some countries diagnosis is made by certified professionals, such as psychologists, learning specialists, physiotherapists and/or speech and language therapists. Some countries recommend to have a full psychological and neurological evaluation if symptoms are too severe. = Standardized tests= * Sensory Integration and Praxis Test (SIPT) * DeGangi-Berk Test of Sensory Integration (TSI) * Test of Sensory Functions in Infants (TSFI) =Standardized questionnaires= * Sensory Profile, (SP) * Infant/Toddler Sensory Profile * Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile * Sensory Profile School Companion * Indicators of Developmental Risk Signals (INDIPCD-R) * Sensory Processing Measure (SPM) * Sensory Processing Measure Preeschool (SPM-P)  Classification Sensory processing disorders have been classified by proponents into three categories: sensory modulation disorder, sensory-based motor disorders and sensory discrimination disorders (as defined in the Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders in Infancy and Early Childhood). =Sensory modulation disorder (SMD)= Sensory modulation refers to a complex central nervous system process by which neural messages that convey information about the intensity, frequency, duration, complexity, and novelty of sensory stimuli are adjusted. SMD consists of three subtypes: # Sensory over-responsivity. # Sensory under-responsivity # Sensory craving/seeking. =Sensory-based motor disorder (SBMD)= According to proponents, sensory- based motor disorder shows motor output that is disorganized as a result of incorrect processing of sensory information affecting postural control challenges, resulting in postural disorder, or developmental coordination disorder. The SBMD subtypes are: # Dyspraxia # Postural disorder =Sensory discrimination disorder (SDD)= Sensory discrimination disorder involves the incorrect processing of sensory information. The SDD subtypes are: 1\\\\. Visual 2. Auditory 3. Tactile 4. Gustatory (taste) 5. Olfactory (smell) 6. Vestibular (balance, head position and movement in space) 7. Proprioceptive (feeling of where parts of the body are located in space, muscle sensation) 8.Interoception (inner body sensations). Treatment =Sensory integration therapy= Vestibular system is stimulated through hanging equipment such as tire swings A type of occupational therapy that places a child in a room specifically designed to stimulate and challenge all of the senses while demanding functional behavior. Sensory integration therapy is driven by four main principles: * Just right challenge (the child must be able to successfully meet the challenges that are presented through playful activities) * Adaptive response (the child adapts his behavior with new and useful strategies in response to the challenges presented) * Active engagement (the child will want to participate because the activities are fun) * Child directed (the child's preferences are used to initiate therapeutic experiences within the session) =Sensory processing therapy= This therapy retains all of the above-mentioned four principles and adds: * Intensity (person attends therapy daily for a prolonged period of time) * Developmental approach (therapist adapts to the developmental age of the person, against actual age) * Test-retest systematic evaluation (all clients are evaluated before and after) * Process driven vs. activity driven (therapist focuses on the \\"Just right\\" emotional connection and the process that reinforces the relationship) * Parent education (parent education sessions are scheduled into the therapy process) * \\"joie de vivre\\" (happiness of life is therapy's main goal, attained through social participation, self-regulation, and self-esteem) * Combination of best practice interventions (is often accompanied by integrated listening system therapy, floor time, and electronic media such as Xbox Kinect, Nintendo Wii, Makoto II machine training and others) While occupational therapists using a sensory integration frame of reference work on increasing a child's ability to adequately process sensory input, other OTs may focus on environmental accommodations that parents and school staff can use to enhance the child's function at home, school, and in the community. These may include selecting soft, tag-free clothing, avoiding fluorescent lighting, and providing ear plugs for \\"emergency\\" use (such as for fire drills). =Evaluation of treatment effectiveness= A 2019 review found sensory integration therapy to be effective for autism spectrum disorder. Another study from 2018 backs up the intervention for children with special needs, Additionally, the American Occupational Therapy Association supports the intervention. In its overall review of the treatment effectiveness literature, Aetna concluded that \\"The effectiveness of these therapies is unproven.\\", while the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded that \\"parents should be informed that the amount of research regarding the effectiveness of sensory integration therapy is limited and inconclusive.\\" A 2015 review concluded that SIT techniques exist \\"outside the bounds of established evidence-based practice\\" and that SIT is \\"quite possibly a misuse of limited resources.\\" Epidemiology It has been estimated by proponents that up to 16.5% of elementary school aged children present elevated SOR behaviors in the tactile or auditory modalities. This figure is larger than what previous studies with smaller samples had shown: an estimate of 5‚Äì13% of elementary school aged children. Critics have noted that such a high incidence for just one of the subtypes of SPD raises questions about the degree to which SPD is a specific and clearly identifiable disorder. Proponents have also claimed that adults may also show signs of sensory processing difficulties and would benefit for sensory processing therapies, although this work has yet to distinguish between those with SPD symptoms alone vs adults whose processing abnormalities are associated with other disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder.  Society  The American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA) supports the use of a variety of methods of sensory integration for those with sensory processing disorder. The organization has supported the need for further research to increase insurance coverage for related therapies. They have also made efforts to educate the public about sensory integration therapy. The AOTA's practice guidelines currently support the use of sensory integration therapy and interprofessional education and collaboration in order to optimize treatment for those with sensory processing disorder. The AOTA provides several resources pertaining to sensory integration therapy, some of which includes a fact sheet, new research, and continuing education opportunities. = Controversy = There are concerns regarding the validity of the diagnosis. SPD is not included in the DSM-5 or ICD-10, the most widely used diagnostic sources in healthcare. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in 2012 stated that there is no universally accepted framework for diagnosis and recommends caution against using any \\"sensory\\" type therapies unless as a part of a comprehensive treatment plan. The APP has plans to review its policy, though those efforts are still in the early stages. A 2015 review of research on Sensory Integration Therapy (SIT) concluded that SIT is \\"ineffective and that its theoretical underpinnings and assessment practices are unvalidated\\", that SIT techniques exist \\"outside the bounds of established evidence-based practice\\", and that SIT is \\"quite possibly a misuse of limited resources\\". Some sources point that sensory issues are an important concern, but not a diagnosis in themselvesCenter for Autism and the Developing Brain Critics have noted that what proponents claim are symptoms of SPD are both broad and, in some cases, represent very common, and not necessarily abnormal or atypical, childhood characteristics. Where these traits become grounds for a diagnosis is generally in combination with other more specific symptoms or when the child gets old enough to explain that the reasons behind their behavior are specifically sensory. Manuals SPD is in Stanley Greenspan's Diagnostic Manual for Infancy and Early Childhood and as Regulation Disorders of Sensory Processing part of The Zero to Three's Diagnostic Classification. Is not recognized as a stand alone diagnosis in the manuals ICD-10 or in the recently updated DSM-5 but, unusual reactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects is included as a possible but not necessary criterion for the diagnosis of autism. History Sensory processing disorder as a specific form of atypical functioning was first described by occupational therapist Anna Jean Ayres (1920‚Äì1989). Original model Ayres's theoretical framework for what she called Sensory Integration Dysfunction was developed after six factor analytic studies of populations of children with learning disabilities, perceptual motor disabilities and normal developing children. Ayres created the following nosology based on the patterns that appeared on her factor analysis: *Dyspraxia: poor motor planning (more related to the vestibular system and proprioception) *Poor bilateral integration: inadequate use of both sides of the body simultaneously *Tactile defensiveness: negative reaction to tactile stimuli *Visual perceptual deficits: poor form and space perception and visual motor functions *Somatodyspraxia: poor motor planning (related to poor information coming from the tactile and proprioceptive systems) *Auditory-language problems Both visual perceptual and auditory language deficits were thought to possess a strong cognitive component and a weak relationship to underlying sensory processing deficits, so they are not considered central deficits in many models of sensory processing. In 1998, Mulligan found a similar pattern of deficits in a confirmatory factor analytic study. Quadrant model Dunn's nosology uses two criteria: response type (passive vs active) and sensory threshold to the stimuli (low or high) creating 4 subtypes or quadrants: * High neurological thresholds #Low registration: high threshold with passive response. Individuals who do not pick up on sensations and therefore partake in passive behavior. #Sensation seeking: high threshold and active response. Those who actively seek out a rich sensory filled environment. * Low neurological threshold #Sensitivity to stimuli: low threshold with passive response. Individuals who become distracted and uncomfortable when exposed to sensation but do not actively limit or avoid exposure to the sensation. #Sensation avoiding: low threshold and active response. Individuals actively limit their exposure to sensations and are therefore high self regulators. Sensory processing model In Miller's nosology \\"sensory integration dysfunction\\" was renamed into \\"Sensory processing disorder\\" to facilitate coordinated research work with other fields such as neurology since \\"the use of the term sensory integration often applies to a neurophysiologic cellular process rather than a behavioral response to sensory input as connoted by Ayres.\\" The sensory processing model's nosology divides SPD in 3 subtypes: modulation, motor based and discrimination problems.

Warren (born 1933) is the president emeritus of LECO Corporation, a pioneer in the development of carbon determination instrumentation for use in the iron and steel industry, and other types of analytic instrumentation for use in organic and metallographic analysis and separation science. He is the recipient of the 2017 Pittcon Heritage Award for his contributions to scientific instrumentation. Career In 1968, Robert J. Warren joined the family-owned Laboratory Equipment Corporation (LECO). LECO was founded in 1936 by Carl E. Schultz, Charles Schullz, George J. Krasl and Joseph Sauer. Carl E. Schultz's sister was Olga S. Krasl, George Krasl's wife. Robert Warren was also part of the family: his wife Elizabeth was Carl Schultz's daughter. LECO was already recognized as a leader in materials analysis. The company's first product was a carbon analyzer, a rapid carbon determinator designed to analyze the amount of carbon in steel or iron automatically in minutes. They expanded into die casting, ceramics, glass blowing, plating, and electronics. They developed a wide range of products for laboratory analysis, including induction furnaces for the analysis of carbon and sulphur, metallurgical apparatus for rapid field analysis, and zircon porcelain and glassware for laboratory use. In 1967, LECO had opened its first international office in Germany. Warren was instrumental in the company's ongoing expansion into Europe and Asia. In 1971, the company received an ‚ÄúE‚Äù Award for Exports from President Richard Nixon (authorized on his behalf by Secretary of Commerce Maurice Stans.) The company reported an increase of overseas sales from 17 to 50 percent of its production, over the previous five years. It had expanded its production facilities as a result of the demand. As executive vice president and general manager of the firm, Robert Warren was chosen to receive the award on behalf of LECO. The company attributed its success in part to the establishment of high customer service standards, including careful handling of equipment, selection and training of distributors, and support for staff and customers in their local languages. In 1976, Warren was named president and general manager of LECO. His wife Elizabeth became vice-president. By 1977, LECO had established international subsidiaries in Brazil, Canada, England, France, West Germany, Sweden and South Africa, in addition to its offices and manufacturing plants in the United States. On June 8, 1977, the Warrens bought the company's outstanding stock from the George J. Krasl Trust, represented by his widow Olga S. Krasl. Under Warren's direction, LECO's research and development expanded, from manufacturing analytical instruments for metals and inorganics, to add manufacturing analytical instruments for organics. Analysis of organics brought LECO into the coal, oil, agricultural, and food industries. Warren also encouraged the incorporation of computing and data management capabilities into LECO's instruments. By the 1980s, LECO was developing multi-element analytical instruments for inductively coupled plasma, glow discharge, atomic emission spectroscopy, and time-of-flight mass spectrometry. In 1997, LECO introduced a 500-spectra-per-second time-of-flight mass spectrometer, suitable for use in separation science. LECO also developed instruments for comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography. In 2012, LECO opened the Elizabeth S. Warren Technical Centre for Separation Science, for research and development into separation science instrumentation. Warren retired as president of LECO in 2016. In 2017, LECO announced construction of a new building to be named in Robert Warren's honor. Philanthropy In 2004, the Warrens and others arranged for the sale of LECO land in the Silver Beach area, to be transferred to the city of St. Joseph, Michigan for educational and recreational use. The Warrens have supported the Silver Beach Carousel Society, which has built a new carousel in the area, to replace one previously located in the Silver Beach Amusement Park.

They differ from conventional sails in that they are flown from kite control lines, not supported by masts. Vehicles driven by kites include boats, buggies, and vehicles with snow and ice runners. They may be as simple as a person flying a kite while standing on a specialized skateboard, or be large, complex systems fixed to the vehicle, with powered and automated controls. They have recreational and commercial uses. Structure Points of sail with a kite buggy. Current kite rigs can be sailed within 50 degrees of the wind.Skysails, Captain John Konrad, Mariner's Weather Log, April 2009, Volume 53, No. 1, National Weather Service This allows them to sail upwind by tacking. A power kite is held at an angle to the wind using control lines. Like any other sail, the kite develops lift and drag, pulling the vessel. The vector of the kite's pull is added to the forces produced by the vessel (water resistance against the hull, force of wheels against the ground, etc.) to move the vessel in the desired direction. Windspeed increases with height, allowing kites to develop substantially more thrust per unit area than a conventional sail. Winds are also steadier and less turbulent higher up. Kites may be adjusted with respect to the wind, manually or by an automated system. A kite cannot stay aloft when there is no wind, and must be re-launched. Applications =Solo sports= A kitesurfer off Long Beach, California, USA Kite rigs power a variety of recreational conveyances on water and land. On water, kites are used to power surf-board-like boards in the sport of kitesurfing. Kiteboating is done in boats with kite rigs. On land, kite landboarding derives the same mode of power for skate-board-like boards. Over snow, kites power snowboards or skis in the sport of snowkiting. Traction kites for solosports generally have an area of 1-16 square meters, with anything over ~5 square meters being a big kite that requires expertise.http://www.coastalwindsports.com/ChoosingAKite.html =Ships= Ship-pulling kites run to hundreds of square meters of area and require a special attachment points, a launch and recovery system, and fly-by-wire controls. The SkySails propulsion system consists of a large foil kite, an electronic control system for the kite, and an automatic system to retract the kite. The kite, while 1‚Äì2 orders of magnitude larger, bears similarities to the arc kites used in kitesurfing. However, the kite is an inflatable rather than a ram-air kite. Additionally, a control pod is used rather than direct tension on multiple kite control lines; only one line runs the full distance from kite to ship, with the bridle lines running from kite to control pod. Power to the pod is provided by cables embedded in the line; the same line also carries commands to the control pod from the ship.Airborne Wind Energy Systems, a review of the technologies, A. cherubini, A. Papini, R. Vertechy, M.Fontana, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 2015 The kite is launched and recovered by an animated mast or arm, which grips the kite by its leading edge. The mast also inflates and deflates the kite. When not in use, mast and deflated kite fold away. Use A commercial cargo ship, the MS Beluga Skysails, was built, and launched in 2007, with a kite rig supplementing conventional propulsion. A European Union-funded four-year study of wind propulsion, using the MS Beluga Skysails, reported that the ship attained 5% fuel savings overall, which translated into of CO2 for a typical year and itinerary. The study concluded that 25,000 similarly equipped ships could reduce fuel consumption by and save of CO2, of NOx. The return on investment for installing a kite sail was estimated to be about two-three years. On her maiden voyage, MS Beluga Skysails saved an estimated 10‚Äì15% fuel, $1,000 to $1,500 per day, while the kite was in use. Maartje Theadora, a large fishing trawler, was retrofitted with a kite rig in 2010. Companies Skysails and KiteShip both made kite rigs.

At some point during his reign, Paerisades possibly married his cousin Komosarye, a daughter of his uncle Gorgippos, and she bore him four sons: Satyros II, likely named after his grandfather Satyros I, Eumelos, Gorgippos II, also perhaps named after Komosarye's father and Paerisades' uncle, and Prytanis. Through this marriage, he became king of the Sindians. Paerisades may have had the epithet \\"Epiphanes\\", which means \\"god-manifest\\", or perhaps \\"Theos\\", meaning \\"god\\", due to his people often praising him as divine and honouring him as a god. In combat, Paerisades wore three outfits for three occasions. He wore one outfit when reviewing his troops, another when he was in battle, and lastly, he wore one when he was forced to flee from battle. He did this so that when he was reviewing his troops, he'd be known by everyone; when he was in combat, he wouldn't be known by the enemy; and when he was forced to flee, nobody would know it was him. He was also an active military leader, possibly taking Tanais and subjugating many tribes around the Maeotic Swamp and expanding the kingdom more than his father did in the Bosporan Expansion Wars, as well as waging war against the Scythians at some point during his reign. Death Paerisades died in 310/09 BC, having ruled around 38 years as Bosporan king. Upon his death, Satyros II, Prytanis, and Eumelos engaged in the Bosporan Civil War because Eumelos had a claim to throne and was allied to Aripharnes while Satyros would not stand for it and waged war against his brother. The victor, Eumelos, greatly expanded the kingdom during his short five-year reign.
