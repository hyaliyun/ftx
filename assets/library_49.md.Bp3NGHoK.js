In November 2013, she lost one of her propellers in Cook Strait.Aratere out of action for six months . 3 News NZ. 14 November 2013. History Diesel Electric Vessel (DEV) Aratere was built for Tranz Rail, now KiwiRail, in 1998 to replace the ageing MV Aratika. The name \\"Aratere\\" is a MƒÅori-language word meaning \\"Quick Path\\". In 2011, Aratere underwent a $52 million refit at the Sembawang shipyard in Singapore, increasing her capacity from 360 to 600 passengers. The refit included a new bow and stern. The ship was lengthened by cutting it in half to insert a new midsection. =Incidents= Aratere has been involved in several technical problems and engine failures over her years in service. There is no official relationship between these incidents, though the media have stoked speculation that the ferry may be jinxed and she has earned the nickname \\"El Lemon\\". Notable incidents have included: * 25 February 1999 - An engine failure. * 18 December 2000 - An engine malfunction. * 1 October 2004 - \\"30 seconds of potential disaster\\" after Aratere has a steering fault in the Marlborough Sounds. * 10 February 2005 - Aratere was detained after a \\"crisis of confidence\\" with inspectors noting that she had arrived from Spain six years earlier in a shocking state. They could no longer allow her to operate as she was She was eventually allowed to sail again on 15 March. * After the extensive refit carried out in Singapore in 2011, she has once again experienced numerous incidents, including engine failures. On 2 November 2011 Maritime NZ ordered the ship to stop operating until proven safe. * On 5 November 2013 Aratere snapped a drive shaft losing a propeller in Cook Strait. This initially forced the ship out of service, causing disruption to Interislander schedules. Subsequently, the ship was allowed to make freight only crossings with only one propeller for propulsion. Layout Aratere has both rail and vehicle decks. These can be loaded simultaneously through the stern via a double linkspan. A lower hold has additional space for cars, though access to this hold was blocked off after the refit in Singapore. Aratere has six decks. * Deck 1 - Engine and propulsion rooms * Deck 2 - Rail deck * Deck 3 - Road vehicle deck * Deck 4 - Bar, Foodcourt, Shop, Lounge, Deck Access * Deck 5 - Premium Lounge, Drivers Accommodation, Deck Access including outdoor seating. * Deck 6 - Bridge and sun deck Service Aratere operates six crossings of the Cook Strait each day (three passenger, three freight). In late 2009, Aratere celebrated her 20,000th crossing, having travelled around 2 million kilometres.

It is based principally in Reims, the main city in France's Champagne region and is one of the famous Champagne houses that formed part of the Grande Marques. Today the house is majority owned by the multinational conglomerate LVMH Mo√´t Hennessy ‚Äì Louis Vuitton S.E. whose portfolio includes other well known wine brands such as Mo√´t & Chandon, Veuve Clicquot, Ch√¢teau d'Yquem and Ruinart. Despite LVMH's majority ownership, the Krug family is still actively involved in all the key decisions of the house but does not manage the day-to-day operations. History Entrance to Krug's facilities in Reims Joseph Krug founded the House of Krug in 1843.Jancis Robinson: Oxford Companion to Wine Third Edition, 2006 He was born Johann-Joseph Krug, a butcher's son, in Mainz, on the Rhine, in 1800, at a time when the city was part of the Napoleonic Empire. Having dispensed with the name Johann, he left Mainz in 1824 and by 1834 he was in Paris. Germans were then much in demand in France as accountants and book-keepers and, as such, Joseph joined Champagne Jacquesson in Ch√¢lons-sur-Marne. He spent eight years with Jacquesson, with his work taking him beyond accountancy as he went on the road around Europe testing the market and assessing criticism from wine sellers and customers. He learned about composition and taste so that by 1840 he already seems to have been blending Champagne for at least one other house.Jane MacQuitty, Sunday Times, 21 January 2001 In 1841 he married Emma-Anne Jaunay, the daughter of a French hotelier based in London's Leicester Square, and an English mother. The following year their son, Paul Krug, was born.Krug for LVMH; The Times, 22 January 1999 In 1842 came the move to Reims and, following a year of negotiations, Krug et Cie. was founded in 1843 with sleeping partner Hyppolite de Viv√®s. Joseph was also fluent in French, English and German and spoke some Russian, putting the company in position to exploit key overseas markets.John Arlott, Krug: House of Champagne Davis-Poynter, London 1976 Joseph died in 1866 and was succeeded by his son Paul Krug, who had been trained by his father for the business in France and abroad. Joseph had laid the foundations and under the supervision of Paul the House was established as a grande marque. By the 1880s the prestige of Krug was acknowledged in the United Kingdom, then the primary overseas market for Champagne. In 1866 the House moved into the premises in Rue Coquebert, in Reims, that it still occupies. After Paul's death in 1910, he was succeeded by his son, Joseph Krug II. However, during World War I Joseph II was taken prisoner and his wife Jeanne played a key role in the House, at a time when the Western Front divided the region between the Allies and the Germans. After the war, Joseph II's slow recovery led to his nephew Jean Seydoux becoming joint manager in 1924. In that decade, too, the Krug 1926 and 1928 vintages were created, which have been considered by critics to be amongst the greatest Champagnes. The lawyer and wine writer Maurice Healey observed in 1940 that \\"Krug holds my allegiance as the king of them all; my recollection does not go beyond the Krug 1919, but that was truly an excellent wine. And Krug 1928 must be the best wine made in the present century.\\" By the mid-1930s, Paul Krug II, the son of Joseph II, was active in the business and would go on to become head of the House from 1959 to 1977. His father died in 1967, by which time he was, according to Patrick Forbes, \\"one of the most popular and respected figures in the Champagne district\\".Patrick Forbes, Champagne: The Wine, the Land and the People, p. 468, London: Victor Gollancz, 1967. In 1962 Henri Krug, the son of Paul II, joined the management, as did his brother Remi three years later. Their arrival was followed by a series of innovations, including extensions in the range of Champagnes. In 1979, for the first time, a graduate winemaker joined the House. In January 1999 the House became part of LVMH and by 2007, the brothers, while remaining on the tasting committee, had stepped down from day-to-day responsibilities. In 2009 Olivier Krug, the son of Henri, became House director. Champagnes Display bottle of Grande Cuv√©e, Krug's non- vintage brut Krug produces mainly Krug Grande Cuv√©e, supplemented by a non- vintage ros√©, a vintage blanc, a vintage blanc de blancs from the Clos du Mesnil in the Cotes de Blancs, a vintage blanc de noirs from the Clos d'Ambonnay and older vintages released as Krug Collection series. On the nose, Krug is characterized by toasted, grilled, pastry or almond notes born from at least 6 years of ageing sur lies. On the palate, Krug is characterized by notes of fresh fruit, particularly citrus, and a freshness linked to grape selection. Krug does not suppress malolactic fermentation nor does it provoke it, with the majority of its wines not undergoing the process. Its wines are almost invariably dry (never more than 6.5g/l residual sugar).A. Domine (ed) Wine pg 157‚Äì167 Ullmann Publishing 2008 The Krug line-up of Champagnes currently includes: * Krug Grande Cuv√©e * Krug Ros√© * Krug Vintage 2000, Krug Vintage 2003 and Krug Vintage 2004 * Krug Collection 1989 * Krug Clos du Mesnil 2000 and Krug Clos du Mesnil 2003 * Krug Clos d'Ambonnay 1998 and Krug Clos d'Ambonnay 2000 Krug Grande Cuv√©e (non-vintage) A blend of over 120 wines coming from ten or more different vintages ‚Äì some up to fifteen years in age ‚Äì and three grape varieties (Pinot noir, Chardonnay and Pinot Meunier) from numerous vineyards. It is re-created on a yearly basis. It is distinguished by its deep golden color and fine bubbles. In total, about twenty years are required to create a bottle of Krug Grande Cuv√©e, including at least six years during which the bottle sits in the Krug cellars. Krug Ros√© is described by the House as a gastronomic Champagne. The fruit of an experiment carried out by Henri and R√©mi Krug in the 1970s, the first bottles of Krug Ros√© were presented for tasting in 1983, 140 years after the company's founding. Krug Ros√© is a blend of three grape varieties, several different vintages from Krug's library of 150 reserve wines and a skin-fermented Pinot noir wine which gives it its color and unique flavor. Krug Ros√© spends at least five years in the House's cellars. It is re-created on a yearly basis. Krug Vintage is, according to the House, \\"not the selection of the best wines of a particular year, but rather the expression of that year according to Krug.\\" Composed only of wines from a single year, Krug Vintage sits in Krug's cellars for at least a decade before release. The 2000 vintage was born of the House's desire to create a vintage for the last year of the millennium. In the early 1980s, Krug introduced Krug Collection, an extension of Krug Vintage, consisting of bottles that have been kept in the House's cellars in Reims for at least ten additional years to allow the development of second-life aromas and flavours. The current offering is Krug Collection 1989. It is the first vintage from the trilogy of 1988, 1989 and 1990 to be released as part of Krug Collection, preceding 1988 upon the House's decision. Krug Clos du Mesnil comes from a single plot (known as a clos in French) of Chardonnay: a 1.84-hectare vineyard protected by walls since 1698 in the centre of Mesnil-sur-Oger, a village in the Champagne region of France. It comes from a single year and is kept in Krug's cellars for over a decade. Krug Clos d'Ambonnay also comes from a single year, and its grapes from a single 0.68-hectare walled plot of Pinot noir in the heart of Ambonnay, another village in France's Champagne region that plays a key role in Champagne making. Bottles are aged for over twelve years in Krug's cellars and are rare due to the small size of the vineyard. Winemaking Barrels stored in Krug's courtyard waiting to be used Krug utilizes all three Champagne varieties in their wines, Chardonnay, Pinot noir, and Pinot Meunier. For their two single vineyard vintages, Krug Clos du Mesnil is made in the Blanc de blancs style, completely from Chardonnay, while Krug Clos d'Ambonnay is made exclusively from Pinot noir. The winemaking process at Krug begins with the individual selection of each plot of vines and continues with the initial vinification of the grapes from each plot in wooden casks, which ‚Äì unlike tanks ‚Äì are small enough to give the House the flexibility to hold a single plot's wine and therefore avoid pre-mature blending. In the event that a plot's wine is not up to the required level, it will leave the house as a bulk, never again to be labelled a Krug base wine. =Pressing and initial fermentation= Immediately following the harvest, the grapes are pressed close to Krug's plots, with this first grape juice kept for 24 hours in a vat in preparation for the fermentation stage. The pressing from each plot is vinified separately. A pressing contains 4,000 kg of grapes and yields 20.5 hectolitres of first juice (the \\"cuv√©e\\"), which is poured into twelve oak casks chosen at random. Once fermentation is complete, the eleventh and twelfth casks are used to top up the other ten casks to protect the new wines from oxidation. For fifteen days, each cask is topped up with wine from the same plot. Krug uses small 205-litre oak casks tailor-made from trees that are more than two centuries old in the forests of Hautes Futaies in Central France. Krug never use these casks immediately; during the first two or three years, they receive only second and third grape juices, with the goal of \\"tanning\\" the casks through the fermentation process, ridding them naturally of their woody aromas, making them well-seasoned and organoleptically inert. The average age of Krug oak casks is 20 years. They are retired after approximately 40 years of use. During the summer preceding the harvest, casks are regularly watered to humidify the wood, a process Krug deems essential as its wines are not wood-aged and its casks therefore empty for eight to nine months of the year. The wines remain in the casks for several weeks. During this period, clarification occurs naturally from the cool temperature of the cellar given the coming winter, as does a micro-oxygenation process from the use of natural containers, making the wine more resistant to oxygen over time. Finally, between December and January, the wine is drawn off into small stainless-steel vats. From here, depending on the decisions of Krug's tasting committee, the wines will either contribute to that year's assemblage or be stored in steel vats in the House's library of 150 reserve wines to be used in the blend of a future Krug Grande Cuv√©e and Krug Ros√©. =The tasting committee and the assemblage= Over a period of five months in autumn and winter, the base wines and the reserve wines are tasted by the members of the tasting committee, composed of five permanent members (Olivier Krug, representing the sixth generation of the Krug family; Eric Lebel, Krug cellar master and winemaker; Julie Cavil and Raphaele Leon-Grillon, who make up the Krug winemaking team; and Laurent Halbin, head of winemaking operations) and two members present according to their availability (R√©mi and Maggie Henriquez, President and CEO of Krug). At each session, between 15 and 18 samples are blind tasted, commented on and scored. During the tasting period, wine from each plot is carefully referenced, tasted at least two or three times and given a mark out of 20. By the end of December, the tasting committee establishes what Krug calls a \\"character sketch\\" of the year and begins tasting the 150 reserve wines from which it will draw the missing elements needed to re-create the character of Krug Grande Cuv√©e year after year. In the spring, a second tasting session of wines from the year reveals how the wines have evolved over the winter period. Eric Lebel then proposes up to three blends for the Champagnes of that year, with each member of the committee having one vote. Once the blend has been decided, the House prepares for bottling which takes place once a year between April and May.Krug's Savoir-Faire / Vineyard / Winemaking =The cellars= All Krug Champagnes are bottled during a single session, thirty weeks after the harvest. Once bottled, they are kept in the House's cellars in Reims. Krug characterizes this final stage of its winemaking process by very extended aging on the lees. Indeed, Krug's main champagne, Krug Grande Cuv√©e stays in the cellars for at least six years, Krug Ros√© for five years, and Krug Vintage, Krug Clos du Mesnil and Krug Clos d'Ambonnay for at least ten years. Vineyards The House owns 30% of the vineyards that produce its wines ‚Äì a relatively high percentage in Champagne-making ‚Äì with 20 hectares of vines in Ambonnay, A√ø, Le Mesnil and Tr√©pail. It obtains the rest of its grapes from long-term contract growers for a total of 250 plots selected from the 270,000 listed in France's Champagne region. Seventy to one hundred winegrowers currently work with Krug, providing 65% to 70% of the company's grapes. Additionally, because Krug preserves the individual character of each wine, winegrowers are able to taste each of the wines selected from their plots and follow their evolution over time in the event that their wines are selected as Krug reserve wines. =Clos du Mesnil= Clos du Mesnil In 1971, R√©mi and Henri Krug purchased six hectares of vines around the renowned Chardonnay village of Mesnil-sur-Oger. Upon their initial visit, they discovered that their purchase included a walled vineyard of a mere 1.85 acres located in the heart of the village and bearing an inscription: \\"In the year 1698, this wall was built by Claude Jannin and Pierre Deh√©e Metoen and in the same year the vines were planted by Gaspard Jannin, son of Claude.\\" Krug stresses that the wall and unusual location in the center of the village create a micro-climate that accords a unique character to its grapes. It was for this reason that the House was inspired to devote a Champagne to a single plot for the first time in its history, resulting in Krug Clos du Mesnil 1979, presented in 1986.Krug, A Journey Through History, House of Krug, 2012 =Clos d'Ambonnay= Following Krug Clos du Mesnil, R√©mi and Henri Krug turned their attention to Pinot noir grapes, in particular those from Ambonnay, a grand cru known for its Pinot noir that had been a main source of supply for Krug since its founding. In 1991, after seven years of searching, they found a walled plot of just 0.68 hectares on the edge the village, on the south-eastern slope of the Montagne de Reims. Like the Clos du Mesnil, the plot was also surrounded by protective walls, which date back to the year 1766, although in this case the vineyard itself was not planted until the 20th century. Krug purchased the land in 1994 and released its first vintage ‚Äì Krug Clos d'Ambonnay 1995 ‚Äì in 2007.  Marketing  LVMH, Paris, selected ceft and company new york, to create a global communications campaign for Krug Champagne. The campaign featured Jean Nouvel, Anjelica Huston, Buzz Aldrin, and David Lynch. The campaign won a gold award at the World Luxury Awards in Monaco. =Krug Lovers= In 2011, Krug launched a community of Krug aficionados who share a love for Krug.Krug.com. Retrieved 26 October 2012 The House-created program offers a platform for stories, inspirations and favorite getaways and is open to the public via registration on the Krug.com website. The program features member profiles and their collaborations with Krug, such as a drawing created by Italian illustrator Gianluca Biscalchin following Krug's Grand Mus√©e de Beaux-Arts event, the Krug Room at the Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong from chef Uwe Opocensky, or a series of photographs by Dutch artist Scarlett Hooft Graafland, commissioned by Krug. =Krug ID= Since summer 2011, all bottles of Krug Champagne feature a KRUG ID located on the left-hand side of the back label. This six-digit number ‚Äì with the first digit indicating the quarter in which the bottle left Krug's cellars and the following two digits indicating the year ‚Äì serves as a reference for wine collectors and a portal to further information about that particular bottle. For Krug Grande Cuv√©es, the KRUG ID reveals the oldest and youngest wines that went into the making of the bottle, as well as the details and challenges of that particular season. For other Krug cuvees, the KRUG ID recounts the story of the year, the objectives behind the creation of the specific bottle or the behavior of the plots.  Burning Man controversy  In 2011, Krug, with the Silkstone events agency, shot a marketing campaign at the Burning Man festival in Nevada. Festival-goers were told they were attending a birthday party, but were filmed and photographed as part of this campaign. The Burning Man organization posted an expos√© on their blog, rebuking Krug for breaking many rules of the festival both in letter and spirit, including product placement, photography for commercial gain and leaving behind a mess. Members of the Burning Man community denounced the campaign and Krug in various social media. See also * List of Champagne houses  References  Further reading * Arlott, John.

Their seven children are Matt (Barry Watson), Mary (Jessica Biel), Lucy (Beverley Mitchell), Simon (David Gallagher), Ruthie (Mackenzie Rosman) and twins Sam and David (Nikolas and Lorenzo Brino). 7th Heaven debuted on August 26, 1996, on The WB, a network which had launched only a year earlier. In November 2005, Variety Magazine announced The WB's decision to cancel the series at the end of the tenth season due to rising production costs. The final episode was intended to air on May 8, 2006, in the final year of The WB's operation before it merged with UPN to form The CW in the fall; however, the episode achieved 7 million viewers, and The CW revived the show, bringing it back to the schedules for its eleventh season on September 25, 2006. The return did not last long; due to flagging viewing figures, The CW made a schedule change midway through the eleventh season, switching 7th Heaven from the Monday 8:00 p.m. timeslot it had occupied since the first episode with Everybody Hates Chris in the Sunday 8:00 p.m. timeslot, and on April 2, 2007, The CW announced its decision to end the series, airing the final episode on May 13, 2007.

Wolf, was released in August 2018. James Jolley, Editor-in-Chief of Gramophone Magazine stated, \\"The American composer Kenneth Fuchs now has quite a sizeable discography of his music on Naxos, invariably played by the LSO who have played a major role in inspiring him to write for the orchestra with impressive authority and imagination.\\" The album won the 2018 Grammy Award Award in the category Best Classical Compendium (JoAnn Falletta, conductor; Tim Handley, producer), announced by the Recording Academy at the 61st annual awards ceremony in Los Angeles, February 10, 2019. Fuchs's seventh album for Naxos, released in August 2020, includes seven works for symphonic winds recorded by the United States Coast Guard Band. The album debuted at #9 on the Amazon Hot 100 Classical Releases and remained in the Top 20 for four consecutive weeks, an unprecedented achievement for an album of wind band music. Fuchs's album of chamber music was released by Naxos in April 2013 and includes Falling Canons (Christopher O'Riley, piano), Falling Trio (Trio21), and String Quartet No. 5 \\"American\\" (Delray String Quartet). The album received outstanding reviews in print and at on-line sources, including Fanfare Magazine, Gramophone Magazine, and MusicWeb-International. Fuchs's recent orchestral commissions include Piano Concerto 'Spiritualist' (After Three Paintings by Helen Frankenthaler, Poems of Life (After Twelve Poems by Judith G. Wolf for Countertenor, violoncello, and Orchestra), Glacier (Concerto for Electric Guitar), Bass Trombone Concerto (scored for both orchestra and band), and Rush (Concerto for Alto Saxophone (scored for both orchestra and band). In 2013, the Wheeling Symphony Orchestra invited Fuchs to compose a fanfare-overture, Forever Free, to celebrate the Sesquicentennial of the State of West Virginia. Fuchs created a version of the work for band, which was performed by ensembles throughout the State to celebrate the occasion. In 2012, the United States Air Force Band of Flight (Wright- Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio) commissioned Fuchs's celebration fanfare for brass and percussion From the Field to the Sky. The work, dedicated to the National Museum of the United States Air Force, was premiered under the baton of Lieutenant Daniel W. Boothe on November 3, 2012. In 2008, the United States Air Force Academy Band (Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado) commissioned Fuchs's work for band United Artists. Following performances on tour throughout the U.S., the band recorded the work under the baton of Colonel Larry H. Lang for inclusion on the disc Windscapes, which was released in December 2009. The work was simultaneously published and released by the Hal Leonard Corporation, the world's largest music print publisher. Since its release the work has been played by high school and college bands throughout the United States and in China. Subsequently, Hal Leonard published two other works scored for band, Discover the Wild and Forever Free. The Adrian Symphony Orchestra in Michigan appointed Fuchs as composer in residence for the 2009‚Äì10 seasons. In collaboration with music director John Thomas Dodson, the residency included world premiere performances of five works. The residency concluded with the premiere of Divinum Mysterium (concerto for viola and orchestra) on April 10, 2010. The concerto was composed especially for London Symphony Orchestra principal Paul Silverthorne, who performed the premiere in Adrian. Silverthorne recorded the work with the LSO for Fuchs's third Naxos disc on August 19, 2011. Marin Alsop selected Fuchs as one of ten composers in residence for the Cabrillo Festival of Contemporary Music in August 2007. Alsop conducted the world premiere of the original orchestral version of Fuchs's work United Artists, following which critic Jason Victor Serinus wrote in the American Record Guide, \\"the work's dramatic, resounding chords and gloriously ringing flourishes constitute a modern fanfare of sorts.\\" The highly successful album Kenneth Fuchs: String Quartets 2, 3, 4 performed by the American String Quartet was released by Albany Records in 2001. Following the release of this disc, the American Record Guide stated quite simply, \\"String quartet recordings don't get much better than this.\\" Fuchs received his Bachelor of Music degree (1979) in composition from the University of Miami where he graduated Omicron Delta Kappa. He earned a Master of Music (1983) and Doctor of Musical Arts (1988) degrees from the Juilliard School in New York City. His teachers included Milton Babbitt, David Diamond, Vincent Persichetti, David Del Tredici, Alfred Reed and Stanley Wolfe. The University of Miami Frost School of Music named him Distinguished Alumnus for the Year 2000. The University of Miami Band of the Hour Association inducted him into their Hall of Fame in 2008. Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, the national music fraternity, named Fuchs a Signature Sinfonian in 2009. The designation \\"recognizes alumni members who have achieved a high standard of accomplishment in their field or profession, thereby bringing honor to Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia Fraternity.\\" Fuchs has also been deeply committed to arts administration. He served as Head of the Department of Music at the University of Connecticut from 2005 to 2008. Prior to this, he served as Director of the School of Music at the University of Oklahoma from 1998 to 2005. Previous administrative positions include Dean of Students and Academics at the Manhattan School of Music (1990‚Äì1998), Assistant Dean of the School of Music at the North Carolina School of the Arts (1988‚Äì1989), and Assistant to the Associate Dean at the Juilliard School (1985‚Äì1988). Fuchs served as a member of the Commission on Accreditation for the National Association of Schools of Music (2003‚Äì2009), evaluating music curricula at collegiate institutions throughout the United States. He served as an on-site evaluator to such institutions as the Cleveland Institute of Music, Curtis Institute of Music, Peabody Institute of the Johns Hopkins University, Arizona State University, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and the University of Washington. Kenneth Fuchs has composed scores for orchestra, band, solo instruments, voice, chorus, standard and mixed chamber ensembles, and musical theater. His music is published by Edward B. Marks Music Company (an imprint of Round Hill Music), Hal Leonard Corporation, Theodore Presser Company, and Yelton Rhodes Music. Kenneth Fuchs Fuchs has been awarded artist residencies at the Atlantic Center for the Arts (New Smyrna Beach, Florida); The Hermitage (Manisota Key, Florida); The MacDowell Colony (Peterborough, New Hampshire); The Helene Wurlitzer Foundation of New Mexico (Taos); and Yaddo (Saratoga Springs, New York). His professional memberships include ASCAP (American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers); American Composers Forum; College Music Society; Dramatists Guild; National Association of Schools of Music, and The Recording Academy. In April 2008, Steve Schwartz wrote on the Moderated Classical Music List, \\"Kenneth Fuchs studied with, among others, Babbitt, Diamond, and Persichetti. In sound, the bustling Persichetti exercises the dominating influence, but Babbitt probably wields more in Fuchs's habits of construction. Most immediately, the sound of Fuchs's music grabs your attention in ways similar to Copland's. Bright, lean sonorities ‚Äì high strings, widely spaced chords, big-shoulder brass, and so on ‚Äì prevail. Yet, also like Copland, Fuchs has more to offer than orchestration ‚Äì namely, real matter and argument. Fuchs builds almost all the scores here out of limited sets of intervals or even specific pitches.... It's all tonal, even mainly diatonic, although not really minimalist, if you care. However, the means allow Fuchs to take an individual approach to tonality. Key-change means less than rhythmic and textural change. The piece takes shape as we hear the basic building blocks ‚Äì like individual tiles in a mosaic ‚Äì slipping into place.\\" Robert R. Reilly, in his book chapter on the music of Kenneth Fuchs, wrote in Surprised by Beauty: A Listener's Guide to the Recovery of Modern Music (Ignatius Press; New edition, April 1, 2016): \\"Fuchs is an exemplar of the recovery of modern music.\\" \\"There is little in contemporary music that is as directly expressive as the music of Kenneth Fuchs. It goes right to the heart and stays there. If you think America's song has already been sung, you need to listen to him.\\" \\" \\"He is endowed with a major melodic gift.\\" \\"Like Aaron Copland, Fuchs has a way of capturing the stirrings of the human heart and the yearnings of the soul in highly spirited, soaring music. His works carry within themselves an inimitably American sense of expectancy, of horizons glimpsed and striven for, and, finally, of boldly announced arrivals.\\"  Discography  Recordings of Fuchs's music include: * Point of Tranquility (Seven Works for Symphonic Winds).

Daniel. Journal of World History Fall 1993: 336-38. Print. Upon its release, the Kimiya-yi sa'ƒÅdat allowed al-Ghazali to considerably cut the tensions between the scholars and mystics. Kimiya-yi sa'ƒÅdat emphasized importance of observing the ritual requirements of Islam, the actions that would lead to salvation, and avoidance of sin. The factor that set the Kimiya-yi sa'ƒÅdat apart from other theological works at the time was its mystical emphasis on self-discipline and asceticism. Structure The Kimiya-yi Sa'ƒÅdat and its subsequent translations begin with citing some councils of the Prophet. Overall, the Kimiya-yi sa'ƒÅdat has four principle parts of ten chapters each: #EbƒÅdƒÅt (religious duties) #Monjƒ´ƒÅt (salvation) #Mu'amalat (human relations aspect of Islam) #MohlekƒÅt (damnation) Sa'ƒÅda Sa'ƒÅda (happiness) is a central concept in Islamic philosophy used to describe the highest aim of human striving.Daiber, H. \\"Sa øƒÅda.\\" Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition.

Only when a human being has liberated his/her soul completely from its corporal existence, and arrives at what is called \\"active intellect\\". Al-Ghazali believed in practical-ethical perfection and that by exercising his God-given capacity for reason man must be drawn to the spiritual alchemy that transforms the soul from worldliness to complete devotion to God. This alone, he believed, could produce ultimate happiness. GhazƒÅlƒ´'s teachings were to help man to live a life in accordance with the sacred law, and by doing so gain a deeper understanding of its meaning on the day of Judgement.Schimmel, Annemarie. \\"The Period of Cinsolidation: From Shibli to Ghazali.\\" Mystical Dimensions of Islam. North Carolina: Chapel Hill, 1975. 94-97. Print. Kimiya Kimiya or KimiƒÅ (Alchemy) is an applied and mystical science that has been studied for centuries. In its essence, KimiƒÅ represents a complete conception of the universe and relations between earthly beings and the cosmos. Religious philosophers emphasized its importance as a religious discipline. Due to its spiritual dimensions KimiƒÅ is considered the noblest of all occult sciences (i.e. astrology and various kinds of magic). Ghazali was himself a believer that everything on Earth is a manifestation of God‚Äôs spirit, thus everything belongs to kimiƒÅ. Ihya'e Ulum-ed'Deen It is a common misconception that the Kimiya-yi sa'ƒÅdat is a rewrite of the Ihya'e Ulum-ed'Deen. Ihya'e Ulum-ed'Deen was written by al-Ghazali after abandoning his duties as a professor due to a \\"spiritual crisis\\", which led him to live in seclusion for several years. It was composed in Arabic, and was an attempt to show ways in which the lives of a Sufi could be based on what is demanded by Islamic law.Watt, Montgomery. \\"Ghazali, /Abu /Hamed /Mohammad, ii, iii.\\" Encyclopedia Iranica. 1-12. Print. There are definite parallels between Ihya'e Ulum-ed'Deen and Kimiya-yi sa'ƒÅdat, however the four introductory chapters of the Kimiya-yi sa'ƒÅdat contain relevant theological discussions that set the two apart. The Kimiya-yi sa'ƒÅdat is noticeably shorter than the Ihya'e Ulum- ed'Deen, however in the original Persian introduction of the Kimiya-yi sa'ƒÅdat, GhazƒÅlƒ´ explicitly states he wrote Kimiya-yi sa'ƒÅdat to mirror the essence of Ihya'e Ulum-ed'Deen and a few of his other theological writings; he wrote it in Persian so that it could reach a broader, popular audience in his homeland.Netton, Ian R. \\"(Untitled).\\" Rev. of The Alchemy of Happiness Translated by Claud Field. Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society Apr. 1993: 117-18. Print. Translation and editing From its original Persian form the Kimiya-yi sa'ƒÅdat has been translated into Urdu, Turkish, Azerbaijani, and German. Husayn-Khadiv-i Jam edited the first half of the Persian text nearly two decades ago. This version is considered to be the most beneficial, as it improves upon the past editions by Ahmad Ahram and Muhammad Abbasi. In 1910, Claud Field published an abridged translation of the Kimiya-yi Sa'ƒÅdat utilizing the Urdu translation of the Persian text as well as an earlier English paraphrase of a Turkish translation by Muhammad Mustafa an-Nawali. Elton L. Daniel, a professor of Islamic history at the University of Hawaii, compared the texts given to him by Claud Field to the Persian edition and reorganized the sequence of the chapters and paragraph divisions in order to get them to correlate better with the original Kimiya-yi Sa'ƒÅdat. He also added annotations indicating the areas in which Field's translation varies from the original Kimiya-yi Sa'ƒÅdat, where certain texts were omitted/condensed, and identifies many of the individuals and Qur'anic citations found in the text. The most recent translation of Kimiya-yi sa'ƒÅdat was published in 2008 and was translated by Jay Crook. Most scholars agree that nothing can compare to a complete and fresh translation from the original Persian text. > ‚Ä≥God has sent on Earth a hundred and twenty-four thousand prophets to teach > men the prescription of this alchemy, and how to purify their hearts from > baser qualities in the crucible of abstinence.

Its design incorporates many new technologies never before used in helicopters, allowing for greater endurance and altitude than any helicopter currently in operation. The development of Hummingbird was begun for DARPA by Frontier Aircraft in 1998. From 2003 both the US Army and the US Navy also shared in funding the project. In May 2004, the company was acquired by Boeing and became integrated into Boeing Phantom Works and then into the Advanced Systems group of Boeing Integrated Defense Systems. Early A160s were powered by modified Subaru automotive engines, but newer versions use Pratt & Whitney PW207D turboshaft engines. The A160 continued with developmental flight tests in 2010, but test flights had already demonstrated greater endurance, higher altitudes, more extensive autonomy, and greater payload. The program had ambitious goals of a range, 24-hour endurance, and altitude. Flights were largely autonomous, with the aircraft making its own decisions about how to fly itself so as to meet certain objectives, rather than relying on real-time human control. The A160 achieved maximum speeds of over 140 knots, though endurance and altitude were its goals, not speed. The aircraft measures from nose to tail and has a rotor diameter of . The project was abandoned by the US Army in December 2012. Design and development =Maverick and Renegade UAVs= During the initial development of the A160 airframe and rotor system in 1999-2000, Frontier Systems simultaneously designed the Maverick vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) UAV as a testbed for avionics, software and flight control systems. The Maverick was a highly modified version of the Robinson R22 light civilian helicopter. By using a proven helicopter airframe, engineers were able to focus on developing systems that could be later transferred to the A160. The Maverick program began in 1998, with the first flight taking place less than a year later in 1999. Although the R22 was a two-seat manned helicopter in its original configuration, the Maverick was significant for never having used a \\"safety pilot\\" (a human pilot riding on board and capable of recovering the aircraft in the event of a failure of the unmanned flight control system). Since much of the software and avionics systems were shared between Maverick and A160, Maverick remained in service long after A160 began flight operations. After acquiring Frontier Systems in 2004, Boeing halted most development of Maverick but it continued flying as a training asset and for reducing risk in technology development for the A160. Four Mavericks were flown by the US Navy, carrying Wescam Electro-Optical/Infrared sensor system, possibly among other sensors. Since being acquired by the military, most Maverick operations are unpublicized. March 2006 saw the completion of the Software Enabled Control program sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(DARPA). With the help of researchers from UC Berkeley, MIT, and Georgia Tech, Boeing developed a variant of its Maverick UAV platform which became known as the Renegade UAV. This aircraft successfully performed various maneuvers and flew routes without real-time human input. =A160= The A160 during ground runs at the Southern California Logistics Airport at Victorville, California The development program for the A160 began when DARPA awarded a 30-month technology demonstration contract to San Diego-based Frontier Systems in March 1998, owned by UAV pioneer Abe Karem. In June 1999, Frontier tested the autonomous flight control system with the Maverick-A, a modified Robinson R22. This test bed was lost during a crash in 2000, after having flown for 215 hours. The first prototype, a three-blade A160, demonstrated a brief hover on December 7, 2001 and performed its first forward flight on January 29, 2002. A four-blade version of the A160 flew in November 2002 using a Subaru four-cylinder engine, and later a six-cylinder piston engine. Frontier Systems was awarded a contract for four more A160s in October 2003. A total of three vehicles were produced by Frontier Systems. Vehicles 1 and 3 were lost in crashes. Frontier began a planned KW600 Diesel engine for the vehicle, but never completed it. A Diesel engine would have nearly doubled the vehicle endurance due to lower fuel consumption.Colucci, Frank. \\"Hummingbird Hunts For a Home\\". Vertiflite, Fall 2008. Frontier Aircraft, and later Boeing, carried out the A160 program as part of a series of contracts with Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the United States Army, and the United States Navy from 2003. In September 2003, DARPA awarded Frontier a $75 million contract for the design, development and testing of four A160s.

Flight International, 12‚Äì18 November 2002. On September 20, 2004, the Hummingbird made its first flight since Boeing took over the program the previous May. The test program operated from the Southern California Logistics Airport near Victorville, California.\\"Test flight program advances for Boeing A160 Hummingbird unmanned aircraft\\", Aerotech News and Review, November 23, 2006.A160 Hummingbird . Boeing. In August 2005, the Hummingbird was flown around Victorville in a 1,200-mile course at 60 knots and 4000 feet, one of the longest helicopter flights ever. A mechanical failure caused the helicopter to crash near the end of the flight and flight testing continued some months later after the crash investigation was concluded. On November 30, 2005, the aircraft successfully completed its first flight with a new 290 kW (390 hp) 6-cylinder gasoline-powered piston engine, hovering about the airfield for about half an hour. A follow-up turboshaft-powered version, the A160T, was first flown on June 15, 2007. It was flown for 8 hours on September 27, 2007 while carrying a 1,000-pound payload. On October 12 it flew for 12 hours while carrying a 500-pound payload, simulating a multi-sensor military reconnaissance mission. This latter flight used up less than 60% of the Hummingbird's maximum fuel load. On December 10, 2007, one of the A160T prototypes crashed during a flight test at Boeing Advanced Systems' test facility in Victorville. A Boeing investigation determined the incident was caused when sensor data stopped being updated to the flight computer: with the feedback loop for the control system effectively cut, the helicopter \\"departed controlled flight and impacted the ground at a near-vertical angle.\\" Much of the forensic evidence was burned in the post-crash fire. A number of potential areas that could have caused the software feedback update thread to stop were found, and those known problem areas were addressed and flight testing resumed on March 26, 2008. On May 9, 2008, at Yuma Proving Ground in Arizona, the A160T demonstrated its ability to hover out of ground effect (HOGE) at 15,000 feet to meet its DARPA milestone. It then surpassed the milestone during the same flight by repeating the HOGE at 20,000 feet altitude. A week later, starting the night of May 14, the A160T demonstrated its un-refueled endurance capabilities with an 18.7-hour flight, landing with over 90 minutes of fuel still on board. This was recognized as the longest un-refueled flight of any rotorcraft, and the F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale (FAI) awarded Boeing the official endurance record in the 500 kg to 2,500 kg autonomously controlled UAV class for the flight. Earlier, in May 2004, the U.S. Army Communications-Electronics Command awarded Syracuse Research Corp. a $13.3 million contract for the ultra high frequency, foliage penetrating, real-time moving target indicator/synthetic aperture radar for use in the A160. In August 2008, the A160T began flight testing what came to be known as the DARPA FORESTER radar system. In August 2009, the A160T was chosen by the US Marine Corps along with the Kaman K-MAX to demonstrate the ability to move 6,000 lb (2,722 kg) of cargo in less than 6 hours for three consecutive days.Trimble, Stephen. \\"US forces plot new role for unmanned cargo resupply\\" .

Rhodesia. Page 139 Ian Smith described him as \\"one of the most able politicians this country has produced, and although our political philosophies did not coincide, we always respected one another and maintained friendly relations.\\"Bitter Harvest, Ian Smith, Blake, 2001, page 47 Background Palley was born in Cape Town, South Africa and was Jewish.Legum, Colin. Africa; a Handbook to the Continent. Page 177.Our First One Hundred Years, Harare Hebrew Congregation, 1996, page 42 He was educated at the University of London where he trained in paediatrics, and went into practice in his native city. In the early 1950s he decided on a change of career and country, retraining as a lawyer and emigrating to Southern Rhodesia. Palley proved an effective advocate and a good legal brain. He was offered the chance to become a Judge in both Rhodesia and South Africa but refused because of the existence of capital punishment to which he had a principled objection. Entry into politics In the 1958 general election he was elected for the opposition Dominion Party in the Greendale District, which consisted of white suburbs of the capital city Salisbury. The Dominion Party sought the break-up of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland and the re- establishment of Southern Rhodesia as a separate Dominion within the Commonwealth, and Palley supported these aims. However, he grew out of sympathy with the majority of the party which sought to delay moves to majority rule. Political stances Palley split with the Dominion Party early in 1959 and sat instead as an independent member (he briefly formed his own party which he called the Southern Rhodesia Party). He supported moves towards increasing African involvement in government, and making an issue of opposing attempts to increase police powers. In 1960, Palley attracted headlines by making an all-night filibuster against the United Federal Party government's Law and Order Maintenance Act. Although the UFP was publicly committed to increasing African involvement in public affairs, Palley was not in the least tempted to support them. According to James Barber, author of Rhodesia: The Road to Rebellion, Palley believed that the UFP lacked any real commitment to giving Africans political power. On 22 July 1960 he also spoke against the UFP's attempts to pursue support from Africans for its attempts which he considered desultory to increase their political power. Palley took the view that it was wholly unrealistic for the UFP to think that the two races could be united in the same party. He also opposed the UFP's decision to use tribal chiefs as a way of involving Africans in government, describing it as a way to bypass Parliament. Re-election in 1962 Palley joined Garfield Todd's \\"New Africa Party\\" in 1961, although he did not remain a member for long. His support for increasing African involvement in government attracted widescale opposition among the white electorate. Accordingly, in the 1962 general election Palley fought the Highfield Electoral District to the south- west of Salisbury. Despite a widespread boycott of the election, he defeated three other candidates to retain his seat and become the only Independent candidate returned. The election devastated the UFP which splintered, and Palley became the most effective voice speaking out against the governments of Winston Field and Ian Smith when they demanded independence on the basis of the 1962 constitution. Palley's district included some African townships and the government's crackdown on the nationalist groups in 1964 led to an outbreak of violence there and the declaration of a state of emergency. Palley disagreed with the suggestion of detaining troublemakers in camps; he agreed that the excess residents living in the overcrowded townships should be moved, but urged that they be provided with areas fit to live in. He said of the Rhodesian Front government that they had \\"certain philosophies for community development, but they have in fact no plans at all.\\" UDI Palley was re- elected in the 1965 general election, described as \\"a remarkable demonstration of political survival\\" as the Rhodesian Front won a landslide victory and Palley was the only white opposition member. On 25 November 1965 the Legislative Assembly met following the Unilateral Declaration of Independence.Rhodesia and the United Nations: UN Imposition of Mandatory Sanctions, 1966, Sanctions, Actions and Reactions, Avrahm G. Mezerik, International Review Service, 1966, page 42 He raised an immediate Point of Order in protest at the government's declaration, saying, \\"Certain Honourable Members in collusion have torn up the constitution under which this House meets. The proceedings have no legal validity whatsoever.\\"The Shortened Fuse, TIME Magazine, 3 December 1965 After the Speaker, Rubidge Stumbles, declared his support, Palley kept rising to raise points of order and eventually was ordered to leave the Chamber, which he refused to do and had to be forcibly removed by the Sergeant-at-Arms, while shouting \\"This is an illegal assembly! God save the Queen!\\"Southern African Encounter, Volume 3, Badger Publications, 1996, page 19 Throughout the Parliament Palley kept up his opposition to the government's stance on both security and the constitution. Ian Smith described him as \\"a one man opposition party\\". When given the opportunity in 1966 to instigate his own debate, he put down a motion opposing the idea of Rhodesia becoming a republic, at intervals refusing to recognise the authority of Clifford Dupont who had been appointed as \\"Officer Administering the Government\\" to replace the Governor.Africa Report, Volumes 11-12, African- American Institute, 1966, page 44 He urged acceptance of British terms under which it would recognise Rhodesia as independent in 1968 by describing them as the best deal Rhodesia could hope for. Later career In 1969 the Rhodesian government decided to hold a referendum on a new constitution which declared Rhodesia a republic. Palley attacked the government for letting a small faction outside Parliament decide its policy. However, the referendum was successful in 1970 and the new constitution changed the basis for the electoral system, depriving Palley of the chance of re-election in the general election that followed. In the 1974 election Palley challenged the Rhodesian Front in the Salisbury City constituency which contained the most non-European voters. He came in only three votes behind, the nearest the RF came to losing any of the upper roll constituencies during the period of UDI. During the Lancaster House talks in 1979, Palley acted as legal adviser to Abel Muzorewa's United African National Council. In Zimbabwe After Rhodesia gained recognised independence under majority rule as Zimbabwe in 1980, Palley argued that meaningful land reform would not be as expensive as some were suggesting because the government had previously been subsidising farmers, and therefore ordinary commercial procedures would make land available to Africans. In 1981 he urged Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front party to fight the seats reserved for European voters, arguing that there was considerable support for him there. Palley remained at work both in medicine and law until his sudden death (of a heart attack). He had never been in good health through his political career, and had a colostomy at the age of 24. Palley married his wife Claire in 1952; they separated in the early 1960s and divorced in 1985. Claire Palley is a leading South African academic specialising in foreign affairs who was United Kingdom representative to the United Nations Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities from 1988 to 1998 and Constitutional Consultant to the President of Cyprus from 1980 to 2004. They had five sons.

Notably, he was an outfielder for the Detroit Tigers and Philadelphia Athletics as well as the manager of the Chicago Cubs and Kansas City Royals of Major League Baseball. Metro was born and grew up in Nanty Glo, Pennsylvania, graduating from Nanty Glo High School in 1937, and also worked in the coal mines there during breaks from school. In baseball, he took his last name from his father, Metro Moreskonich, a Ukrainian immigrant. Metro threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed . Career =Player= At age 18, Metro attended a tryout camp for the St. Louis Browns, then bounced around in the minor leagues. In 1940, he joined the Texarkana Liners, then an independent baseball team but which became affiliated with the Detroit Tigers. Due to his light hitting ability, he was never able to become a full-time starter, although he did make the Tigers club out of spring training in 1943. He was released by the Tigers in 1944, partly because of his attempts to organize a players union. The Philadelphia Athletics picked him up, and, under Connie Mack, Metro won \\"a shot\\" at starting center fielder, although his inability to hit consistently cost him this job. In 171 major league games played, Metro was credited with 69 hits, with ten doubles, two triples and three home runs. Two of those blows came on consecutive days, June 23‚Äì24, 1945, against the New York Yankees' Jim \\"Milkman\\" Turner and Hank Borowy.Retrosheet: 1945 PHI A batting log for Charlie Metro Overall, though, Metro hit a lowly .193 and collected 23 runs batted in. In the closing weeks of 1945, Metro joined the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League, where in 1946, his last season as a full-time outfielder, he played under another Baseball Hall of Fame manager, Casey Stengel. =Manager, coach and scout= In 1947, he was hired as a player-manager by the Yankees' organization, and in the mid-1950s through 1961 he helmed Triple-A clubs for the Tigers and Baltimore Orioles. In , he got his first big-league managing job with the Chicago Cubs as a member of their \\"College of Coaches.\\" Metro succeeded Lou Klein as \\"head coach\\" on June 12. The head coach job was designed to rotate among several members of the College, but Metro stayed in the role for 112 games and the rest of the 1962 campaign. The Cubs won 43 and lost 69 (.384) under him, and finished ninth in the ten-team National League. Metro was fired after the season; then he joined the crosstown Chicago White Sox as a scout (1963‚Äì64) and coach (1965). In 1966 he returned to managing in the PCL with the St. Louis Cardinals' top affiliate, the Tulsa Oilers. After one season, Metro resumed his scouting career. Bob Howsam, who owned the Triple-A Denver Bears when Metro managed them as a Tigers' affiliate in 1960‚Äì61, had hired Metro for the Cardinals' system at Tulsa in 1966. When Howsam took over as general manager of the Cincinnati Reds in 1967, he brought Metro with him as a top special assignments scout. Then, in 1968, Metro joined the front office of the expansion Kansas City Royals, where he had an active hand in the expansion draft. He took over as manager when Joe Gordon resigned after only one season at the helm. However, his stint there as manager was shorter than his Cubs tenure, lasting only 52 games (19‚Äì33, .365), being replaced by Bob Lemon on June 7. Metro went back to scouting for the Tigers and the Los Angeles Dodgers. Then followed a coaching assignment with the Oakland Athletics, and in 1984 he returned to the Dodgers as a scout. After being dismissed by Los Angeles, Metro retired to his Denver ranch. He died in Buckingham, Virginia where he lived, on March 18, 2011 from mesothelioma, a type of lung cancer.

Its heyday was in the mid‚Äë20th century.Geoffrey Self, Light Music in Britain Since 1870: A Survey (Ashgate, 2001)Lamb, Andrew (2002). British light music: sound good, feel good, Gramophone November 2002, pp.34‚Äì38, accessed 12 September 2011. The style is through-composed, usually shorter orchestral pieces and suites designed to appeal to a wider context and audience than more sophisticated forms such as the concerto, the symphony and the opera. Light music was especially popular during the formative years of radio broadcasting, with stations such as the BBC Light Programme (1945‚Äì1967) playing almost exclusively \\"light\\" compositions. Occasionally also known as mood music and concert music, light music is often grouped with the easy listening genre. Light music was popular in the United Kingdom, the United States and in continental Europe, and many compositions in the genre remain familiar through their use as themes in film, radio and television series. Origins Before Late Romantic orchestral trends of length and scope separated the trajectory of lighter orchestral works from the Western Classical canon, classical composers such as Mozart and Haydn won as much fame for writing lighter pieces such as Eine Kleine Nachtmusik as for their symphonies and operas. Later examples of early European light music include the operettas of composers such as Franz von Supp√© or Sir Arthur Sullivan; the Continental salon and parlour music genres; and the waltzes and marches of Johann Strauss II and his family.H. E. Jacob, Johann Strauss - Father and Son - A Century of Light Music, 1977, The Straussian waltz became a common light music composition (note for example Charles Ancliffe's \\"Nights of Gladness\\" or Felix Godin's \\"Valse Septembre\\"). These influenced the foundation of a \\"lighter\\" tradition of classical music in the 19th and early 20th centuries. In the UK, the light- music genre has its origin in the seaside and theatrical orchestras that flourished in Britain during the 19th and early 20th century.Lyndon Jenkin's CD notes to \\"British Light Music\\" (EMI) These played a wide repertoire of music, from classical music to arrangements of popular songs and ballads of the time. From this tradition came many specially written shorter orchestral pieces designed to appeal to a wider audience. Composers such as Sir Edward Elgar wrote a number of popular works in this medium, such as the \\"Salut d'Amour\\", the Nursery Suite, and Chanson de Matin. The conductor Sir Thomas Beecham became famous for concluding his otherwise serious orchestral concerts with what he termed \\"lollipops\\", meaning less serious, short or amusing works chosen as a crowd-pleasing encore.EMI CD CDM 7 63412 2, published in 1991. Influenced by the earlier \\"promenade concerts\\" held in London pleasure gardens, a similar spirit embued many of Henry Wood's early Queen's Hall Proms concerts, especially the \\"Last Night\\".Proms 2010: Last Night of the Proms 1910 Style, accessed 18 November 2010 With the introduction of radio broadcasting by the BBC in the 1920s the style found an ideal outlet. This increased after the launch of the BBC Light Programme in 1945, featuring programmes such as Friday Night is Music Night and Music While You Work.Brian Kay: \\"Music Everywhere\\" (2005 BBC Television programme) In the United States, \\"pops orchestra\\" such as the famous Boston Pops Orchestra began to emerge in the 19th century. The Boston Pops was founded in 1885 as a second, popular identity of the Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO), founded four years earlier. They commissioned light pieces by composers such as Leroy Anderson, Ferde Grof√© and George Gershwin to write original works, along with theatre music, film music and arrangements of popular music and show tunes. Style The cover of Eric Coates's autobiography, featuring a facsimile of a motif in his Knightsbridge March. Coates is often considered the \\"King of Light Music\\"Eric Coates: The King of Light Music, BBC Radio 4, 23 February 2008 The British light music composer Ernest Tomlinson stated that the main distinction of light music is its emphasis on melody.\\"Brian Kay in conversation with Ernest Tomlinson\\", on Brian Kay's Light Programme, 17 February 2005 This is certainly a major feature of the genre, although the creation of distinctive musical textures in scoring is another aim, for example the close harmony of Robert Farnon or Ronald Binge's \\"cascading string\\" effect, which later became associated with the \\"sustained hum of Mantovani's reverberated violins\\". Lyndon Jenkins describes the genre as \\"original orchestral pieces, often descriptive but in many cases simply three or four minutes of music with an arresting main theme and a contrasting middle section.\\" David Ades suggests that \\"it is generally agreed that it occupies a position between classical and popular music, yet its boundaries are often blurred\\".David Ades, notes to The Great British Light Experience, EMI, 1997 (724356667624), p.4 He goes on to cite broadcaster Denis Norden who said that light music was \\"not just tuneful round the outside, but tuneful right through.\\" The genre is often associated with the easy listening orchestral arrangements of Mantovani, Percy Faith and Henry Mancini, although with the exception of Mancini these composers are better known for their arrangements rather than through-composed original compositions. As a result of this association, the music is sometimes linked to the lounge music, Exotica or beautiful music genres, but light music generally does not feature vocals, synthesisers or popular music instruments.What is Light Music?, Classic Themes, accessed 15 November 2010 Often, the pieces represent a mood, place, person or object, for example Farnon's \\"Portrait of a Flirt\\", Albert Ket√®lbey's In a Monastery Garden or Edward White's \\"Runaway Rocking Horse\\".\\"Edward White: The Runaway Rocking Horse\\", Land of Lost Content, accessed 15 November 2010 The genre's other popular title \\"mood music\\" is a reference to pieces such as Charles Williams' A Quiet Stroll, which is written at an andante pace and has a jaunty, cheery feel.Charles Williams , Robert Farnon Society, accessed 15 November 2010 Light music pieces are usually presented individually or as movements within a suite, and are often given individual descriptive titles. These titles can sometimes be unusual or idiosyncratic, such as Frederic Curzon's \\"Dance of the Ostracised Imp\\".Dance of the Ostracized Imp , Classical Midi, accessed 15 November 2010 In keeping with this tradition of levity, pieces can also feature musical jokes at the expense of more \\"serious\\" works, such as Eric Fenby's overture Rossini on Ilkla MoorFenby: Rossini on Ilkla Moor, http://thompsonian.info/fenby.html, accessed 15 November 2010 or Arthur Wilkinson's Beatlecracker Suite, which arranges songs by The Beatles in the style of Tchaikovsky's ballet The Nutcracker.Beatlecracker Suite, Music Makes Me, accessed 15 November 2010 As film, radio and television themes In the 1950s and '60s many light composers wrote Production Library music for use in film, radio and television, and as a result, many light music compositions are familiar as theme music, an example being Trevor Duncan's March from a Little Suite, used by the BBC as the theme to Dr. Finlay's Casebook in the 1960s, or Edward White's \\"Puffin' Billy\\" being the theme to both the BBC radio series Children's Favourites and the CBS children's programme Captain Kangaroo. Eric Coates' marches in particular were popular choices as theme music. The \\"Dambusters March\\", possibly his most famous work, was used as the title theme to the 1954 film and has become synonymous with the film and the mission itself. Other Coates works used as theme music include \\"Calling All Workers\\" for Music While You Work, \\"Knightsbridge\\" for In Town Tonight and \\"Halcyon Days\\" as the theme to The Forsyte Saga. Coates was also commissioned to write original marches for television stations including the \\"BBC Television March\\", ATV's \\"Sound and Vision March\\" and Associated Rediffusion's \\"Music Everywhere\\". Other noteworthy television startup themes include William Walton's Granada Preludes, Call Signs and End Music for Granada Television, Robert Farnon's Derby Day for Radiotelevis√£o Portuguesa, Richard Addinsell's Southern Rhapsody for Southern Television, Ron Goodwin's Westward Ho! for Westward Television and John Dankworth's Widespread World for Rediffusion London.Roddy Buxton, \\"Tiptoe through the Startups \\", Transdiffusion Several pieces of light music are used on BBC Radio 4 to the present day, with Eric Coates's \\"By the Sleepy Lagoon\\" being the theme of Desert Island Discs, Arthur Wood's \\"Barwick Green\\" the theme of The Archers and Ronald Binge's \\"Sailing By\\" preceding the late-night shipping forecast. Decline and resurgence During the 1960s, the style began to fall out of fashion on radio and television, forcing many light composers to refocus their energy on writing more serious works or music for film. Robert Farnon completed several symphonies in the later part of his life, as well as composing for television, for example Colditz. The light composers' skills of classical orchestration and arrangement were appreciated by composers such as John Williams, with both Angela Morley and Gordon Langford asked to help orchestrate his film scores for Star Wars (1977) and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) amongst others.Angela Morley obituary, Independent.co.uk Many orchestras specialising in playing light music were disbanded. Small palm court orchestras, once common in hotels, seaside resorts and theatres were gradually lost in favour of recorded music. The BBC began to discard its archive of light music, much of which was saved by composer Ernest Tomlinson and is now kept at his Library of Light Orchestral Music.The Library of Light‚ÄìOrchestral Music However, the genre was kept in the public consciousness by its use in advertisements and television programmes, often used as a nostalgic evocation of the 1940s and 1950s. During the 1990s, the genre began to be re-discovered and original remastered recordings by orchestras such as the Queen's Hall Light Orchestra were issued on compact disc for the first time.Queen's Hall Light Orchestra , Robert Farnon Society, accessed 16 November 2010 This was followed by new recordings of light music by orchestras such as the Royal Ballet Sinfonia, the New London Orchestra and the BBC Concert Orchestra, as well as continued public concerts by orchestras such as the Cambridge Concert Orchestra, the Scarborough Spa Orchestra and Vancouver Island's Palm Court Light Orchestra. The style also found a new home on BBC Radio 3 on Brian Kay's Light Programme, although this programme was discontinued in February 2007.Brian Kay's Light Programme website, a former light music programme on BBC Radio 3. In 2007, BBC Four broadcast an evening of light music as part of a themed evening celebrating British culture between 1945 and 1955, which included Brian Kay's documentary Music for Everybody and a televised version of Friday Night is Music Night. In the UK, U.S. and Canada, light music can still be heard on some of the radio channels that specialise in classical music, for example Classic FMWednesday 16 June - A Light Music Spectacular, Classic FM, accessed 20 November 2010 and XLNC1.XLNC1 programming philosophy A nationwide participatory festival of light music called \\"Light Fantastic\\" was organised by BBC Radio 3 in June 2011 as part of the 60th anniversary celebrations of the 1951 Festival of Britain. This included events in London, Manchester, Cardiff and Glasgow, from both professional and amateur ensembles, including a live revival of Music While You Work from a factory in Irlam near Manchester, several light music concerts from the Southbank Centre and a number of documentaries about the genre. Light music is also frequently used as incidental music in radio and television programmes, for example Charles Williams' \\"Devil's Galop\\" (once famous as the theme to Dick Barton: Special Agent) is now often used in spoofs of 1950s action programmes, such as Mitchell and Webb's The Surprising Adventures of Sir Digby Chicken-Caesar sketches.Sir Digby Chicken Caesar Tune, accessed 20 November 2010 Mitchell and Webb also use Acker Bilk's \\"Stranger on the Shore\\" as the theme music of their radio sketch show.British Comedy Guide, URL accessed 9 January 2014 One place that has, however, famously weathered the vagaries of fashion and kept the \\"Palm Court\\" tradition alive is the Pump Room in Bath. First opened in 1704 and then rebuilt in the 1790s, it has been famous both as a social meeting place and for public concerts throughout much of its existence. The Pump Room Orchestra was disbanded in the 1940s but, soon after World War II ended, a piano trio became a daily feature of life in the Pump Room and has been ever since to this very day, performing once or twice daily every day of the year bar Christmas Day and Boxing Day. Notable composers There are hundreds of composers who can be considered to have written \\"light music\\", although composers whose oeuvre focussed primarily on lighter works include Charles Ancliffe, Ronald Binge, Eric Coates, Frederic Curzon, Trevor Duncan, Robert Farnon, Adalgiso Ferraris, Ron Goodwin, Heinz Kiessling, Albert Ket√®lbey, Billy Mayerl, Angela Morley, Ernest Tomlinson, Sidney Torch, Edward White, Charles Williams, Alberto Semprini and Haydn Wood.

He had some knowledge of the Piscataway language and was consulted by the Algonquian linguist, Ives Goddard, as well as Julian Granberry. Career Proctor was a Native American activist who had served during World War I and also worked for the Internal Revenue Service.U.S. Social Security Death Index, Washington, D.C., December 1978. His activism spanned many decades. Background A combination of factors had influenced the descendants of the Piscataway and other tribes in the Southeast. The tribe had been decimated by the early 18th century by infectious disease, and warfare with other tribes and the colonists. They had lost their land through colonial encroachment. Their last mention in historical records was at a 1793 conference in Detroit. Remaining Piscataway in Maryland merged with other tribes; others intermarried with both white and black neighbors and assimilated to various degrees. The legacy of slavery and the post-Reconstruction environment had led to 19th-century legislation across the South creating racial segregation and more rigid binary classifications of society into \\"white\\" and \\"black\\"‚Äîthe latter essentially meaning all other. With states' enforcement of the \\"one-drop rule\\" (carried to extremes in Virginia), anyone with discernible African ancestry was classified as \\"negro,\\" \\"mulatto,\\" or \\"black,\\" thereby discounting any other ancestry. Although a few families identified as Piscataway Indians into the early 20th century, prevailing racist attitudes tended to classify mixed-race people as black. Throughout most of the 19th century, the US census had no provision for classification of Indians. Census takers might classify them as free people of color, or mulatto, or black. The loss of information about Native American individuals added to the perception that the tribes and people had faded away. Maryland dissolved the Native American reservations it had assigned in the 18th century. State and federal census records classified the Piscataway and any mixed-race people as \\"free negro\\" or \\"mulatto\\", adding to the breakdown of identity. While the Piscataway were enumerated as \\"mulattoes\\" in state and federal census records, Catholic parish records and ethnographic reports continued to identify certain families as Indian. In the 20th century, social scientists studied the \\"We-sorts\\" (also known as Wesorts) to see if there were remnants of Native American culture. They were so distinct as a group that they sat together in the local Catholic Church, between the whites and the blacks, in a time of public segregation. Recognizing their unique heritage and the fact that some communities had married within to maintain cultural identity, sociologists called such groups \\"tri-racial isolates\\", identifying numerous such communities across the South. Rise to leadership Turkey Tayac fought in World War I in France as a part of the Rainbow Division, originally made up of National Guard units to mobilize quickly. He was nearly killed by mustard gas. In 1911, in an article on the Piscataway tribe, the Catholic Encyclopedia noted that the few contemporary people who claimed to be Piscataway were \\"negro mongrels\\". This was an indication of how prominently the society used race to define identity; under racial segregation and application of the \\"one-drop rule\\", the states defined being of African descent as overriding other ancestry in the binary system. Turkey Tayac was a notable figure in the early and mid-20th century cultural revitalization movements among remnant Southeastern Native American communities, including the Lumbee, Nanticoke, and Powhatan Indians of the Atlantic coastal plain. Their efforts were curtailed by the Great Depression and World War II. Under the federal Indian Reorganization Act, persons wanting to register as one of the Native American tribes had to prove a certain amount of descent, related to individuals on the Dawes Rolls - a requirement known as blood quantum. (Since then, many recognized tribes have established their blood quantum and other requirements for membership. They frequently relate to proving direct descent from individuals identified as Indian in certain official records.) Turkey Tayac started using a new name as he organized a movement for Native American peoples that privileged self-ascriptive forms of identification. In one of their projects in the 1960s, the Piscataway issued identification cards to Native Americans, rather than have tribes apply to and rely on state and federal bureaucracies to issue them on their behalf. =Cultural reclamation= Along with his tribal responsibilities, Turkey Tayac was also an active participant in the Bonus Army, part of his dedication to seeking social justice. Turkey Tayac was a Roman Catholic throughout his life, and was active in the Catholic Veterans of America. Turkey Tayac was interviewed by ethnographers, including T. Dale Stewart, John Harrington, Frank G. Speck, William H. Gilbert, and Lucille St. Hoyme‚Äîwho studied evidence for Native American survival in regions where it was thought that Native Americans had long since vanished. Turkey Tayac was particularly concerned with Moyaone, also called the Accokeek Creek Site. The archeological site shows indigenous human habitation from about 1300 CE to 1630 CE, including the time of the historic Piscataway. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966 and is located within Piscataway Park, part of the National Park system administered by the National Park Service. Some of the land had been purchased in 1928 by Alice and Henry G. Ferguson from Philip Proctor's mother and her second husband, after his father had died.Alice Ferguson Foundation - A Historical Account, online, printout dated 22 February 2001.

After Alice died in 1951, Henry established the Alice Ferguson Foundation to protect the environment.Ann Cameron Siegal, \\"Quietly Tucked In Near the Potomac: Moyaone Residents Keep Close to Nature\\", The Washington Post, 23 July 2010 In the 1960s, the Foundation made plans to donate much of the property to the National Park Service for protection. It is across the Potomac River from Mt. Vernon. Other property, known as the Hard Bargain Farm, is run by the Alice Ferguson Foundation. Tayac supported the formation in the 1960s of Piscataway National Park.Alice Ferguson Foundation - A Historical Account The rise of the American Indian Movement in the 1970s increased interest in Turkey Tayac's attempts to reorganize the tribe. Along with his son Billy Redwing Tayac and Avery Lewis, a Pima supporter, in 1974 Turkey Tayac incorporated a non-profit organization, the \\"Piscataway-Conoy Indians.\\" Eventually, the Piscataway-Conoy Indians, Inc. opened the Piscataway Indian Center. They wanted to use it as a place to revitalize American Indian identity for people of Piscataway heritage, and for others of Native American descent in the region. In 1978, Turkey Tayac was diagnosed with leukemia. His family worked with Congressional and Senate representatives to gain permission for Proctor to be buried at the park. Senator Paul Sarbanes attached an amendment to unrelated legislation to achieve this.\\"Chief Turkey Tayac, burial in Oxon Hill, Md.\\" Title III; October 12, 1979 It was opposed by the Alice Ferguson Foundation, which had donated land for the park. In 1979, Turkey Tayac was buried in the ossuary site at Moyaone. Since 1978, the Piscataway have divided into three organized groups, strong enough to take different directions. On Monday, January 9, 2012, all three groups were granted recognition by the state of Maryland. None has yet been recognized officially by the federal government.

It is divided into five groups of 100 short stanzas of 3 to 6 lines, each hundred subdivided into 10s, or pattu. The five groups are based on tinai (landscapes): riverine, sea coast, mountain, arid and pastoral. According to Martha Selby, the love poems in Ainkurunuru are generally dated from about the late-2nd-to-3rd-century-CE (Sangam period).Selby, Martha Ann. Tamil Love Poetry: The Five Hundred Short Poems of the Ai·πÖku·πüun≈´·πüu, an Early Third-Century Anthology. Columbia University Press, 2011. . pp. 1-6 According to Takanobu Takahashi ‚Äì a Tamil literature scholar, these poems were likely composed between 300 and 350 CE based on the linguistic evidence, while Kamil Zvelebil ‚Äì another Tamil literature scholar ‚Äì suggests the Ainkurunuru poems were composed by 210 CE, with some of the poems dated to 100 BCE. The Ainkurunuru anthology manuscript includes a colophon which states it to be a Chera (Kerala) text, rather than the more common Pandyan kingdom-based. The poems in this book were written by five authors and were compiled by Kudalur Kilar at the behest of Chera King Yanaikkatcey Mantaran Ceral Irumporai. Style and contents This book comes under the Akam (love and emotions) category of the Sangam literature. The poems of this anthology are in the Akaval meter. These poems deal with the various aspects of the courtship between the hero and the heroine. The poems are set in various landscapes (Tinai - ‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ£‡Øà). Each poem is subdivided and formatted into pattu or tens, a style found in much of Tamil literature such as Tirukkural, Bhakti movement poetry and elsewhere. This may have been, according to Zvelebil, a Sanskrit literature (sataka style) influence on this work. However, the poetry shows relatively few loan words from Sanskrit. The Ainkurunuru has allusions to 17 historical events and offers some window into early Tamil society. For example, it mentions the kutumi, or the \\"pigtail of Brahmin boys\\". Sections and authors The work is divided into five sections by different authors:Selby, Martha Ann.

As a startup, the company behind Wallop was backed by $13 million from Microsoft and venture capitalists including Norwest Venture Partners, Bay Partners and Consor Capital. The company was later spun off of Microsoft. While the Wallop team was working on launching their website, however, the expansion to platforms of other social networks and their opening up of APIs led to Wallop's changing directions. Instead of trying to compete with these already established social networking providers, the company scrapped their Beta application and, as stated in their website, \\"Wallop retooled their product and focused on developing cutting-edge applications for leading social networking platforms like Facebook, and Bebo\\". As of 2008, the company left its social networking service model and went into creating applications for other social networking sites instead. Wallop products Currently, Wallop has two products they call Cool Cards and Party On!. These applications are hosted by Wallop, and are built using Facebook and Bebo APIs, thus supporting those two social networking platforms by default, but can also be posted to other sites by using the regular method of embedding Adobe Flash applications into HTML. Cool Cards is simple Adobe Flash-based application to display card-like graphics that users can customize before posting in someone's social networking site profile. Party On!, on the other hand, is also an Adobe Flash-based application which can also be posted in the user's profile, and allows users to create a customized invitation that will keep track of guest lists, therefore making a place for people to plan parties inside such a profile. History as a social network As a social networking provider in its beta release, Wallop, with its application accessible through the domain name wallop.com, provided users with the basic features a social networking site provides, such as creation of personalized profiles where users can put the personal information, establishing links with other users as \\"friends\\", and being able to react to other users' profiles by being able to leave comments. Additional features such as ability to upload and show image files, creation of blogs, and a fully functional music player where users can upload audio files within their accounts and put restrictions as to who can play these files, were also built into the application. Aside from being supposedly a social networking application, Wallop was originally designed also as an online market place for mods that are to be made and sold by its users. It was stated that these mods, as they used to call the software members will develop and sell to the community, will allow users to add characters, graphics, games, backgrounds, and more to put on their profiles, with price ranging from $0.99 to $4.00. The concept gave a lot of possibilities for users on what applications, such as a calendar or a flash game, to put on their account profiles. The beta release already had a sandbox and a developer API established, before Wallop suddenly changed course to instead becoming a company providing users of then competitors the ability to add Wallop's applications to their profiles. =Public reception= With the site's front-end functionality generally depending in Adobe Flash technology, it was at that aspect different from prevailing social networks, such as Friendster and MySpace, which by that time at 2003, was mostly rendered as traditional HTML pages. Using Adobe Flash gave the site aesthetics unique to its contemporaries, but making it not functional with browsers having no Adobe Flash installed. One aspect of Wallop's beta release that most people react about, is its continued usage of the invite-only account creation strategy, wherein users will only be able to sign up for the site if an existing member invites them. It may be argued that it might have been only intended to be so in the beta release and that signups would have been open to all visitors afterward, nevertheless some felt that the approach long abandoned by other social networks, such as Facebook in October 2006, somehow contributed to its failure to get as much user-base possible. Being started as a Microsoft Research project, the beta release of Wallop social networking site was moderately covered among tech savvies, with several articles written about it in technology related news websites. Several of such articles and some blogs speculated that Wallop would be Microsoft's answer to then growing demand in the social networking arena. Some entities, such as the internet-based community behind stonerocket.net who created the now defunct wallopmodding.com, even made sites dedicated to making Wallop mods with the aim of making business out of Wallop users. Nonetheless, time has proved these speculations false as Microsoft unveiled Windows Live services and with Wallop eventually leaving its goal as a main player in the social networking scene.

Josephus recorded that Herod the Great planted a renowned date-palm (Nicolaitan) plantation near the city.B.J. 2.59 Pliny commented on how the dates of Livias were of high quality both juicy and sweet. Pliny Nat. 13.44 Theodosius also praised the dates of Livias stating ‚Äúit has there some great Nicolas dates‚Äù (ibi habet dactalum Nicolaum maiorem). Theodosius Top. 19. The Madaba Map also depicts the date palms still growing in the area of Livias-Betharamtha in the sixth cent. AD. Date palms still grow at the edge of the archaeological site of Tall el-Hammam that is identified as Livias not far from Abila. Date Palms at the south west edge of Tall el-Hammam, Jordan.

HM Chief Inspector of Prisons is appointed by the Justice Secretary from outside the prison service for a period of five years. The post was created by royal sign-manual on 1 January 1981 and established by the Criminal Justice Act 1982 on the recommendation of a committee of inquiry into the UK prison service under Mr Justice May. The chief inspector provides independent scrutiny of detention in England and Wales through carrying out announced and unannounced inspections of detention facilities. Their remit includes prisons, young offenders institutions, police cells and immigration service detention centres. They are also called upon to inspect prison facilities in Commonwealth dependencies and to assist with the monitoring of Northern Ireland prison facilities. The chief inspector is not operationally part of HM Prison Service or the Ministry of Justice (United Kingdom), and both have been criticised at times in the reports issued by the chief inspector after prison visits, or in their annual report, delivered to the Justice Secretary and presented to Parliament. The inspectorate's independence has been interpreted differently by the different holders of the post. From the inspectorate of Stephen Tumim onwards, HM Chief Inspector of Prisons has been more willing to speak critically in public of government penal policy.

He was the eighth overall pick in the 1979 Major League Baseball Draft. He later served as a coach for the Kansas City Royals and Philadelphia Phillies. He is currently the hitting coach for the Clearwater Threshers. Houston Astros The Houston Astros drafted eighteen-year-old Mizerock straight out of Punxsutawney High School in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. He was the second of five catchers selected in the first round of the June draft. After four seasons in their farm system, in which he batted .228 with eighteen home runs (twelve of which were hit in ) and 143 runs batted in, Mizerock made the Astros out of Spring training as Alan Ashby's back-up. He allowed three passed balls in a game against the Cincinnati Reds on April 19 to not only lose the back-up catcher job, but to also get himself sent back down to the minors. In fairness to Mizerock, knuckleballer Joe Niekro was pitching. After Ashby was lost for a month of the season with a viral infection in his ear, Mizerock was called back up. However, he only appeared in four games during that span, and was optioned back down to the triple A Tucson Toros upon Ashby's return. He was brought back up for a third time in mid-August, and remained on the major league roster through the end of the season. He had a second game with Niekro on the mound on August 31 in which he had two passed balls. In all, Mizerock had eleven passed balls for the season; eight of which occurred with Niekro pitching. After spending all of the season with the double A Columbus Astros, he returned to Houston late in the season to fill in for an injured Ashby. He was with the Astros on and off throughout their division winning season, and was on their post-season roster, but did not make an appearance in the 1986 National League Championship Series against the New York Mets. He was released after the season. Atlanta Braves Mizerock spent Spring training with the Montreal Expos, but failed to make the club. Just as the season was set to begin, he signed with the Atlanta Braves. He batted .240 with eight home runs and 94 RBIs in three seasons with the Richmond Braves to earn a September call-up to Atlanta in . He batted .222 with two RBIs in eleven games. After one more season in the Braves' minor league system, Mizerock retired. Coaching Since retiring as a player, he has served as a minor league manager, a coach and interim manager with the Kansas City Royals. He is a two time winner of the Dick Howser Award, awarded for outstanding contributions to the Royals organization ( & ).

After leading the team to a 40-36 record, he was promoted to the Class A Rockford Royals in , where he earned Midwest League Manager of the Year honors. He moved to the Carolina League's Wilmington Blue Rocks in , where he was again named his league's manager of the year. In 1996, Wilmington won the league championship with Mizerock at the helm. He remained with Wilmington through before moving on to the Wichita Wranglers in . He won the Texas League title and was Minor League Manager of the Year with Wichita in . He spent the & seasons with the Omaha Golden Spikes before getting his first major league coaching gig with the major league club in . He compiled 646 wins and 554 losses in his minor league managerial career. He was promoted from bullpen coach to interim manager of the Royals 23 games into the season when Tony Muser was fired. His first game managing was against the Detroit Tigers, who were being managed by Luis Pujols on an interim basis. Pujols and Mizerock were teammates on the 1983 Houston Astros competing for the back-up catcher job. After losing their first six games under Mizerock, the Royals won five of their next seven before he was replaced by Tony Pe√±a. In all, he led his team to a 5‚Äì8 record in thirteen games. 2002 was the first time in franchise history that Kansas City had lost 100 games. He stayed on as third base coach for the Royals until the end of , when he was assigned to be a roving instructor for the organization. He accepted a position to once again manage the high level Class A Wilmington Blue Rocks minor league team for the 2007 season.

Logstown and other Native American villages, most circa 1750s 1751 map depicting \\"Log's Town\\" The riverside village of Logstown (1725?, 1727-1758, also Logg's Town, French: Chiningue pronounced Shenango), near modern-day Baden, Pennsylvania, was a significant Native American settlement in Western Pennsylvania, and the site of the 1752 signing of the treaty of friendship between the Ohio Company and the First Nations occupying the region in the years leading up to the French and Indian Warduring which Logstown became nearly depopulated and abandoned. Being an unusually large settlement, and because of its strategic location, Logstown was an important factor of all parties developing the Ohio and tributary rivers. Logstown is located in Harmony Township, northwest of the Forks of the Ohio (now in downtown Pittsburgh) in an area on the east bank of the Ohio River opposite Aliquippa. The site is also due north of the Pittsburgh International Airport. History Located directly on the right bank of the Ohio River, the original village was settled by Shawnees, possibly as early as 1725, on low-lying land on the north bank of the Ohio, less than a mile north of present-day Ambridge in Beaver County, Pennsylvania.\\"Logstown, on the Ohio : a historical sketch\\", Agnew, Daniel, originally published by Myers, Shinkle & Co., Pittsburgh, PA, 1894, available at Historic Pittsburgh. Weiser's census of warriors at Logstown, pg. 7. In the rich soil by the riverside, the Shawnees cultivated maize. In 1744 the town's population increased significantly when Kakowatchiky arrived with his band of 200 Shawnee warriors and their families from Wyoming, Pennsylvania.Paul A. W. Wallace, Indians in Pennsylvania, DIANE Publishing Inc., 2007, p. 127. As part of their effort to claim the Ohio Valley, around 1747 the French built about 30 log cabins, some with stone chimneys, on a plateau above the original Logstown village. The French turned over these cabins to the Natives. Only 18 miles downriver from present-day Pittsburgh, Logstown predated the French fort at Pittsburgh, Fort Duquesne, by at least seven years. Logstown therefore became an important trade and council site for both the French and the Natives, and ironically, the British also. In 1747, the Six Nations Confederacy Haudenosaunee sent two headmen: Tanacharison, a Seneca, and Scarouady, an Oneida, as emissaries to live in Logstown. Tanacharison sided with the British in the coming war.\\"The Indian Wars of Pennsylvania,\\" Sipe, C. Hale, 1931, fourth reprint, 1999, Wennawoods Publishing. In 1748, the colony of Pennsylvania sent Conrad Weiser, Pennsylvania's ambassador to the Six Nations, to Logstown. He held council with a gathering of chiefs, who complied with his request for a count of their warriors in the Ohio Valley region: * Iroquois, or Six Nations: ** Senecas: 163 ** Onondagas: 35 ** Oneidas: 15 ** Cayugas: 20 ** Mohawks: 74 * Allies of Iroquois: ** Wyandots: 100 * Others: ** Shawnees: 162 ** Tisagechroamis: 40 ** Mohicans: 15 ** Lenape (Delaware): 165 ** Total : 789 In 1749, the French marked their claim of the watersheds of the Allegheny River and the Ohio River. The governor of New France sent a force of 300 men, led by C√©loron de Blainville, down the Allegheny and Ohio. Along the way, C√©loron nailed copper plates bearing royal arms to trees, and buried inscribed leaden plates at the mouths of principal tributaries. When C√©loron arrived at Logstown, he discovered some British traders there. Incensed, he evicted the traders and wrote a scolding note to the governor of Pennsylvania.\\"History of Washington County, Pennsylvania,\\" Crumrine, Boyd, L.H. Everts and Co., 1882. Account of C√©loron at Logstown, pg. 26. He then browbeat the Natives about French dominance of the region. The expulsion of the British traders and the browbeating offended the Iroquois, some of whom returned to their homeland, tearing down the French copper plates as they went. On May 28, 1752, the British held a council at Logstown with representatives of the Six Nations, and the Lenape and Shawnee who had been tributary to them. Colonel Joshua Fry and two other commissioners represented the colony of Virginia, and Christopher Gist represented the Ohio Company. The Iroquois \\"half-King\\" or sachem, Tanacharison, declared that his people did not consider that the 1744 Anglo-Iroquois Treaty of Lancaster had ceded the colonists any land beyond the Allegheny Mountains, but he promised the Iroquois would not molest any British settlements southeast of the Ohio River. He also formally requested that a British fort be built at the mouth of the Monongahela River, the site of present-day Pittsburgh. This fort, Fort Prince George, was still in construction in January 1754 when it was razed by a much larger French force, which then built Fort Duquesne in the same spot. In late 1753, Virginia Governor Dinwiddie sent an eight-man mission headed by a young (21) George Washington to warn the French away from the Ohio Valley, and assert the claim of the Ohio Company. From November 24 to 30, Washington held council with Tanacharison and Scarouady at Logstown. Returning to Virginia, Washington was made major and second-in-command of the Virginia Regiment, whilst Captain William Trent was sent with about 40 men along the Nemacolin Trail to the Monongahela River crossing ford at Redstone Old Fortsthe earliest point at which a freight wagon road could reach the Ohio River basinfor the Virginian plan was to seal control of the area by cutting and widening the trail from the Patomac River to build a blockhouse (later called Fort Hangard) they stocked with advanced supplies on the shore at Redstone Creek, On May 28, 1754, in Battle of Jumonville Glen, Tanacharison killed Ensign Joseph Coulon de Jumonville, an act that helped to precipitate the French and Indian War(New research suggests that it was Washington himself who fired the shot that killed Jumonville.David Preston. \\"The Trigger\\" in SmithsonianOctober 2019. pp30 - 78.) . Following Washington's surrender at Fort Necessity, Scarouady burned down Logstown, on or about June 24, 1754. French forces under Louis Coulon de Villiers rebuilt the village. In 1754, New France built Fort Presque Isle on Lake Erie, Fort Le Boeuf on French Creek, Pennsylvania, Fort Machault near the junction of French Creek with the Allegheny River, and finally Fort Duquesne, at the forks of the Ohio. When the army of General John Forbes occupied Fort Duquesne on November 24, 1758, the Natives abandoned many of their neighboring villages. With the construction of Fort Pitt, Logstown lost its prominence. When Major George Washington again visited the site of Logstown on October 21, 1770, none of the residents were Native American. In 1792, an area on or near the settlement was taken over as a military base for the newly formed Legion of the United States. Legionville became the first basic training facility for the United States Military. The site was vacated in 1793 after the troops left to fight in the Northwest Indian War.

The movie was filmed outside St. George, Utah. The film was released to theatres and home video in 2005. Despite poor reviews and poor box office results, the film gained success on home video, giving it a slight cult following. Plot As a child, Phil Davis (Greg Germann) was able to outrun, outjump and outhit anyone in his class, until a kid from California, Ace Montana (Marc Raymond), moved into town. Ever since then, Ace has been number one and Phil number two. Even in the cul-de- sac where the four childhood friends and rivals (Montana, Davis, Blaine Moosman (Ross Brockley) and \\"Big Jimmy\\" Scaldoni (Perry Anzilotti) live, the Montana's mailbox is #1, and the Davis' mailbox is #2. After a basketball game where Phil's son's team loses to Ace's son's team, Phil realizes that the Davis family's second-place status has passed on to the next generation. Phil's wife Kim (Lauren Holly), the den mother of the local Cub Scout pack, gives a pinewood derby kit to each of the Cub Scouts. Although the boys are supposed to make their own cars from the kits, with appropriate adult supervision, the four dads obsessively take over the project, totally excluding the boys. As each man becomes more and more obsessed with building the fastest car, their wives eventually become so annoyed that they leave the house, taking their sons with them. Soon, \\"Big Jimmy\\" is the first to break secrecy to talk to Blaine, and the two of them then talk to Phil, showing him on the title page of the Pinewood Derby Bible that Ace Montana is the author. Not only that, but the car Ace built as an eight-year-old boy in California still holds the record for the fastest pinewood derby car on record. The three men decide to collaborate to build one car that will beat Montana's. To this end, they steal Ace's record holding car to reverse-engineer it, finding out that Ace's real name is Stacy Lynn, but are nearly caught in the act of returning it. The three men then succeed in building a fast car that will break the record, and Blaine and Jimmy decide that Phil should have the honor of having his son enter the car in the competition. At the Derby, the men and their wives are re-united. Kim tells Phil that their son Brady (Adam Hicks) has built his own car while staying with his grandfather, with advice from grandpa's neighbor, and she challenges him to \\"do the right thing\\". After some soul-searching, Phil passes up the car the three men built, and allows Brady to register his car for the race - but \\"Big Jimmy\\" still wants to beat Ace, and takes the car for his son to enter. After several races, the competition comes down to five finalists, including Ace's, Brady's, and the car the three men built. In the final race their car is leading the pack but loses a wheel. Ace's car then takes the lead, but on the flat part of the track, Brady's car takes the lead and finishes first, setting a new pinewood derby record. Ace is shocked, but makes a gesture of congratulating the Davises; still, the minute he leaves the room, he throws a temper tantrum.

Formally Recognizes 2 American Indian Groups\\". NBC Washington. 9 Jan 2011. Retrieved 10 Jan 2011. that is descended from the historic Piscataway people.\\"Contact Page\\". Piscataway Indian Nation and Tayac Territory. (retrieved 4 Jan 2010) At the time of European encounter, the Piscataway was one of the most populous and powerful Native polities of the Chesapeake Bay region, with a territory on the north side of the Potomac River. By the early seventeenth century, the Piscataway had come to exercise hegemony over other Algonquian-speaking Native American groups on the north bank of the river. The Piscataway nation declined dramatically before the nineteenth century, under the influence of colonization, infectious disease, and intertribal and colonial warfare. The Piscataway Indian Nation organized out of a 20th-century revival of its people and culture. Its peoples are committed to indigenous and human rights. It is one of three contemporary organized groups of the Piscataway people. On January 12, 2012, Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley issued an Executive Order recognizing both the Piscataway Indian Nation and the Piscataway Conoy Tribe as Indian groups under a process established by the General Assembly. Geography The Piscataway Indian Nation inhabits traditional homelands in the areas of Charles County, Prince George's County, and St. Mary's County; all in Maryland. Its people now mostly live in these three southern Maryland counties and in the two nearby major metropolitan areas, Baltimore and Washington, D.C. Government The current hereditary chief of the Piscataway Indian Nation and Tayac Territory is Billy Redwing Tayac, prominent in the movement for indigenous and human rights. He is the son of the late Chief Turkey Tayac, a leader in the Native American revitalization movements of the twentieth century. Since Turkey Tayac's death in 1978, two other organized tribal groups have emerged that represent Piscataway people: these are the Piscataway Conoy Tribe, led by Mrs. Mervin Savoy; and the Cedarville Band of Piscataways, led by Natalie Proctor. The different tribes have varying perspectives on tribal membership, development, and other issues. History While indigenous peoples inhabited areas along the waterways of Maryland for thousands of years, the historic Piscataway coalesced as a tribe comprising numerous settlements sometime in the fourteenth or fifteenth century. The women were developed agriculturalists, growing varieties of maize, beans and squash that supported population and a hierarchical society. The men also hunted and fished. A hierarchy of places and rulers emerged: hamlets without hereditary rulers paid tribute to a nearby village. Its chief, or werowance, appointed a \\"lesser king\\" to each dependent settlement. With political change came changes in social structure and religious development that exalted the hierarchy. By the end of the sixteenth century, each werowance on the north bank of the Potomac was subject to a single paramount chief: the ruler of the Piscataway, known as the Tayac. =English colonization= The English explorer Captain John Smith first visited the upper Potomac River in 1608. When the English began to colonize what is now Maryland, the Tayac made allies of the newcomers. He granted the English a former Indian settlement, which they renamed St. Mary's City, after their own monarch. The Tayac intended the new colonial outpost to serve as a buffer against Susquehannock incursions from the north. In 1634 Tayac Chitimachen or Kittamaquund converted to Christianity under the guidance of Jesuit Rev. Andrew White. His young daughter Mary, who also had converted and taken a Christian name, married the colonist Giles Brent of Maryland. Soon, the tribe was caught in English religious wars, as the Virginia Protestant trader William Claiborne and his ally Captain Ingalls, invaded Maryland and destroyed St. Mary's City as well as the rival trading post at Kent Island. Moreover, both Gov. Calvert and Kittamaquund soon died. Since neither the tribe nor the rival Maryland governments recognized Brent's claim to Piscataway lands, the couple crossed the Potomac to establish a trading post and live at Aquia Creek, Virginia. Any benefits to having the English as allies and buffers proved short-lived. The Maryland Colony was initially too weak to pose a significant threat. But the Seneca continued to occasionally invade southward. Moreover, as the English persisted and eventually developed a more successful colony after resolving their own religious disputes, they turned against the Piscataway, competing for land and resources. Furthermore, some Piscataway had settled across the Potomac river, and became known as the Mattaponi. They became embroiled in the Anglo-Powhatan Wars. By a 1668 treaty, western shore Algonquians agreed to be confined to two reservations: one on the Wicomico River; the other, on those settlements that comprised a portion of the Piscataway homeland. However, those reservations had not been laid out when Susquehannocks retreating from the Virginia Colony established a fort in Maryland, and the war they had been waging against English colonists flared into Bacon's Rebellion. The respite from the Treaty of Middle Plantation proved brief. Refugees from dispossessed Algonquian nations, including the Mattaponi (who had their own small reservation in Virginia), joined with the Piscataway, who by 1690 had retreated into Zekiah Swamp. In 1697, many Piscataway relocated across the Potomac and camped near what is now Plains, Virginia in Fauquier County. This alarmed Virginia settlers, who tried to persuade the Piscataway to return to Maryland. Finally in 1699, the tribe moved on its own accord to what is now called Conoy Island in the Potomac River near Point of Rocks, Maryland. They settled there until after 1722. In the eighteenth century, some Piscataway, as well as Lenape and other fleeing Algonquian groups, migrated northwest toward the Susquehanna River seeking relief from the European settlers. Then known as the \\"Conoy\\", they sought the protection of the powerful Haudenosaunee, their former enemies, as well as German Christians including Conrad Weiser. They were allowed to establish settlements, including at Conoy Creek near Conestoga Town in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania and Shamokin in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania. However, by the American Revolutionary War, the Pennsylvania Colony also proved unsafe, for while the Tuscarora and Oneida sided with the Americans, other Iroquois tribes sided with the British. American Colonel Thomas Hartley in 1778 and Sullivan's Expedition in 1779-1780 devastated Native American towns. Some Conoy continued to migrate north, along the Great Indian Warpath, Great Shamokin Path, Sheshequin Path and other trails, finally settling in New France. Today, their descendants live with the Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation, in Ontario, Canada. Others may have moved south toward North Carolina Colony with the Tuscarora (despite their Iroquoian language) or Occaneechi (despite their Siouian language), and possibly merged with the Meherrin or Pamunkey. =Present day= According to some historians and archaeologists, a small group of Piscataway families continued to live in their homeland. Though destroyed as an independent, sovereign polity, the Piscataway survived, and resettled into rural farm life. In those times, they were classified as free people of color, over time marrying members of other ethnic groups, but incorporating them into some Piscataway traditions. In the late nineteenth century, archaeologists, journalists, and anthropologists interviewed a number of Piscataway who claimed descent from tribes associated with the old Piscataway chiefdom. Unlike other institutions, the Catholic Church continued to identify a core group of families as Indian in its parish records. Anthropologists and sociologists classified many as a tri-racial folk community, who were commonly called \\"Wesorts\\". Phillip Sheridan Proctor, later known as Turkey Tayac, was born in 1895 in Charles County, Maryland. Proctor revived the use of the title, tayac, a hereditary office he claimed had been handed down through his family. Turkey Tayac was instrumental in the revival of American Indian cultures in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast. By the early twentieth century, few families identified themselves as Piscataway Indians, with dramatic decreases in population due to disease, as well as the Maryland Colony's dissolution of reservations in the eighteenth century. Furthermore, the prevailing racial attitudes during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, became Jim Crow policies of the twentieth century‚Äîbased on a binary society. With the early 20th-century pseudoscience of Walter Plecker and others came laws enforcing the \\"one-drop rule\\". Thus, anyone with a discernible amount of African ancestry was commonly classified as \\"negro\\", \\"mulatto\\", or \\"black\\", regardless of their self-identification. The Piscataway were reclassified as \\"free people of color\\", \\"Free Negro\\" or \\"mulatto\\" on state and federal census records even in the nineteenth century, and under Plecker's lobbying, the mulatto category was eliminated by the mid-20th century. This detribalization made standing American Indian treaty rights that much easier to abrogate for multi-racial people, even though Catholic, Baptist or other parish records and ethnographic reports continued to identify Piscataway individuals and families as Indians. =Piscataway revival= Chief Turkey Tayac was a prominent figure in the early and mid-twentieth century cultural revitalization movements. He influenced the Piscataway, but also other remnant southeastern American Indian communities, such as the Lumbee of North Carolina, and the Nanticoke, and Powhatan of Virginia and Maryland. With a third-grade formal education, Chief Turkey Tayac began the process of cultural revitalization and self-determination. He emphasized a movement based on American Indians choosing self-identification, during an era when the United States Indian Reorganization Act required individuals to prove blood quantum to claim their ancestry. Today, the Piscataway Indian Nation is an emergent sovereign indigenous presence in its Chesapeake homeland. The Piscataway Indian tribal nation is enjoying a renaissance. The Piscataway Indian Nation members are among the 25,000 self-identified Native Americans in Maryland. References Sources *Barbour, Philip L. The Three Worlds of Captain John Smith.

He was born near Reykjav√≠k, son of a merchant of an old and well- known Icelandic family. He graduated from the College of Reykjav√≠k, where he received honoris causa in literature and language. While still at college, he was made assistant editor of the best known newspaper in Iceland, edited by Bj√∂rn J√≥nsson. In 1906 his psychic abilities were also investigated by the Experimental Society founded by Einar Hj√∂rleifsson Kvaran: as a clairvoyant, he succeeded in divining the contents of closed books, and as an automatic writer he penned works supposedly by Hans Christian Andersen, J√≥nas Hallgr√≠msson, and Snorri Sturluson. But he lost his mediumistic abilities after a serious illness.William H. Swatos and Loftur Reimar Gissurarson, Icelandic Spiritualism: Mediumship and Modernity in Iceland, New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction, 1997, , p. 93. In 1908 he adopted the family name Kamban in place of his birth name (Gu√∞mundur J√≥nsson) and advocated a change in Icelandic naming conventions. In 1910, he proceeded to the University of Copenhagen, where he specialized in literature and received his master's degree. In 1914 he published his first play, Hadda Padda which was endorsed by Georg Brandes and shown in the Danish Royal Theatre with Kamban as assistant director. He later married an actress from the play, Agnete Egeberg, and they had a daughter in 1921. In 1915 Kamban moved to New York, intending to establish himself as an English language writer. He was not successful and moved back to Copenhagen with his wife in 1917. In 1920 he achieved success at Dagmarteatret with We Murderers and was employed as a director at the theatre. He is also the author of spirited and erudite historical novels based on the Icelandic sagas, including Skalholt (4 vols., 1930‚Äì32; tr. of Vol. I and II, The Virgin of Skalholt, 1935) and I See a Wondrous Land (1936, tr. 1938). Kamban directed plays, wrote novels and produced motion pictures in Copenhagen until 1934, when he moved to London. Not finding success there, he relocated to Berlin in 1935 and lived there until 1938, when he moved back to Copenhagen. During the German occupation of Denmark, Kamban received German research funding and came to be seen as a collaborator. On 5 May 1945, as the German forces surrendered, Kamban was murdered at a Copenhagen restaurant while his wife and daughter watched in horror, by Danish partisans. His body was returned to Iceland and he was buried with honors in Reykjavik. On the 100th anniversary of his birth, his play Marmari, or Marble, was produced by the National Theatre in Iceland.

The island is long, wide at the most, and covers an area of 97 km2.\\"Astypalaia\\" in The New Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Chicago: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc., 15th edn., 1992, Vol. 1, p. 651.

Name  Astypalea was believed to be named after Astypalaea, an ancient Greek mythological figure.

Pliny the Elder records that Rome accorded Astypalaia the status of a free state.Gary Reger, \\"The Aegean\\" in Hansen and Nielsen eds., An Inventory of Archaic and Classical Poleis (Oxford 2004), 737. It was assigned to the Aegean Roman province of Insulae. During the Middle Ages it belonged to the Byzantines until 1207, when - in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade - it became a fief of the Querini, a noble Venetian family, until 1522. The Querini built a castle that is still in place and added the name of the island to their family name, which became Querini Stampalia. Astypalaia was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1522, and remained under Ottoman control until 1912, with two interruptions: from 1648 until 1668, during the Cretan War, it was occupied by Venice, and from 1821 to 1828 during the Greek War of Independence. On April 12, 1912, during the Italo-Turkish War, a detachment of the Regia Marina landed on Astypalaia, which thus became the first island of the Dodecanese to be occupied by Italy. From there the Italians, on the night between the 3rd and 4 May, landed on Rhodes.Bertarelli, 161 The island remained under Italian governance until World War II. In a September 1943 naval battle near Astypalea, the Greek destroyer Vasilissa Olga together with the British destroyers and sank a German convoy, consisting of the transports Pluto (2,000 tons) and Paolo (4,000 tons). In 1947, through the Treaty of Paris, it became part of Greece along with the rest of the Dodecanese island group. = Archaeology = The religious and political center of the classical city-state of Astypalaia was the hill crowned by the Querini castle. The modern town of Chora occupies the same site, and worked stones from ancient monuments are reused in older houses as well as the castle. A one-room museum at Pera Gialos, on the shore near the old port, displays inscriptions, grave monuments, and other artifacts from the island (open May‚ÄìSeptember, free entry, no photographs permitted). The earliest material on display is fragments of neolithic pottery. One case contains intact pottery, bronze weapons, and stone tools from a pair of richly furnished Mycenaean chamber tombs excavated at Armenochori (approximately west of the chapel of Agios Panteleimonas). At Kylindra, on the west flank of the castle hill, a unique graveyard has been excavated by the Greek archaeological service. At least 2700 newborns and small children, below the age of two, were buried in ceramic pots between approximately 750 B.C. and Roman times. Since 2000, a team from University College London has undertaken systematic study of these remains and those of a contemporary cemetery for adults and older children excavated at Katsalos nearby. Kylindra was first excavated in 1996 by the 22nd Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities, who dated Kylindra from the Late Archaic to the Early Classical periods, and is also the largest child and infant cemetery in the world. They dated the nearby adult cemetery, Katsalos, from the Geometric to the Roman Period. Skeletal remains of infants are rare amongst most cemetery excavations; Ancient Greeks buried their infants in trade pots, such as amphorae, which contributed to the preservation of the remains from Kylindra. The collection of child and infant remains is currently housed at University College London, where the growth and development of the children and infants through development of tissues, bones, teeth structures are studied.Hillson, Simon, \\"The World's Largest Infant Cemetery and Its Potential for Studying Growth and Development,\\" Hesperia Supplements Vol. 43, New Directions in the Skeletal Biology of Greece (2009), pp. 137-154. The well-preserved mosaic floor of an early Christian basilica, decorated with geometric designs, lies underneath the chapel of Agia Varvara about 700 meters north of the small port of Analipsi (Maltezana). Its monolithic columns and marble column bases were evidently reused from a Hellenistic or Roman-period religious building nearby. A few meters east of the harbor of Analipsi, at a site known as Tallaras, are the remains of a late Roman-era bath. Its mosaic floors, including a Helios surrounded by the signs of the Zodiac, have been reburied by the Greek Archaeological Service (as of 9/2013), but photographs are on display at the museum. Mosaic floor fragments remain in situ at the ruined early Christian basilicas of Karekli (Schoinountas) and Agios Vasilios (south of Livadi). Road signs lead to the inconspicuous, inaccessible remains of a pre-Venetian fortification on Mt. Patelos opposite the monastery of Agios Ioannis at the western extreme of Astypalaia.Astypalaia: Lady of the Aegean (Municipality of Astypalea 2011). = Treaty with Rome = Astypalaia's treaty with Rome, made in 105 B.C., has survived in an inscription found on the island.Greek text at IGXII,3 173. The text appears in Robert Kenneth, \\"Rome and the Greek East to the death of Augustus\\", p. 57-58 A noteworthy feature of this treaty is its formal assumption of sovereign equality between Rome and Astypalaia: the Astypalaians would not aid the enemies of the Romans or allow such enemies passage through their territory, and likewise the Romans would not aid the enemies of the Astypalaians or allow such enemies passage through their territory; in case of an attack on Astypalaia, the Romans would come to its aid, in case of an attack on Rome the Astypalaians would come to its aid; etc. Rome at the end of the second century BC still maintained the forms - if not the substance - of reciprocity in its dealings with Greek city-states. Since there was no reason for the Romans to single out Astypalaia for such formal courtesy, it is assumed that this treaty followed a standard formula used in treaties with other Greek city states, whose texts did not survive.  Ecclesiastical history  Astypalaea became a Christian bishopric and is mentioned as such in a 10th-century Notitia Episcopatuum.Gustav Parthey, Hieroclis Synecdemus et notitiae graecae episcopatuum (Berlin 1866), p. 123 (n¬∫ 568) It was a suffragan of the Metropolitan Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Rhodes, the capital of the Aegean Insulae province. = Titular Latin Catholic see = As a diocese that is no longer residential, it is listed in the Annuario Pontificio among titular sees.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ), p. 841 In 1933 it was nominally restored Titular bishopric under the name of Astypal√¶a.

The Common Core Booster utilizes the Russian made RD-180 burning RP-1 fuel with liquid oxygen producing a thrust of 3.8 MN. The liquid propellant tanks use an isogrid design for strength, replacing previous Atlas tank designs which were pressure stabilized.Launch Vehicles , Lockheed Martin The length of the common core booster is , and has a diameter of .Lockheed Martin Names New Rocket Atlas V , Lockheed Martin = Delta IV = The Delta IV launcher family uses the liquid fuel Common Booster Core as the first stage of the various rocket configurations. One or three modules can be used as the first stage. In most configurations a single CBC is used with or without strap-on SRBs. Three CBCs together form the first stage of the Heavy configuration. The CBC uses the Rocketdyne RS-68 engine and burns liquid hydrogen with liquid oxygen producing a thrust of . = Angara = The Universal Rocket Module (URM) is the modular liquid fueled first stage of the Angara expendable launch system. Depending on the configuration, the first stage can consist of 1, 3, 5 or 7 URMs. Each URM uses a Russian-made RD-191 engine burning RP-1 fuel with liquid oxygen producing a thrust of 1.92 MN.Rocket family ¬´Angara¬ª, Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center = Falcon Heavy = The Falcon Heavy launch vehicle consists of a strengthened Falcon 9 Block 5 center core with two regular Falcon 9 Block 5 core stages acting as liquid-fuel strap-on boosters. Each core is powered by nine Merlin 1D engines burning rocket-grade kerosene fuel with liquid oxygen producing almost of thrust, and all three cores together producing over 22MN of thrust. A first design of the Falcon Heavy included a unique propellant crossfeed capability, where fuel and oxidizer to power most of the engines on the center core would be fed from the two side cores, up until the side cores would be near empty and ready for the first separation event. However, due to its extreme complexity this feature was cancelled in 2015 leaving each of the three cores to burn its own fuel. Later evaluations revealed that the propellant needed for each side booster to land (reuse) are already close to the margins so there is really no advantage to crossfeed. Like the single stick Falcon 9, each Falcon Heavy booster core is reusable. The Falcon Heavy Test Flight demonstrated the two side boosters landing simultaneously near their launch site, while the central booster attempted a landing on SpaceX's Autonomous spaceport drone ship, which resulted in a hard landing near the ship. During the second mission all three boosters landed softly. A Falcon Heavy launch that succeeds in recovering all three core boosters has the same material expenditure as the Falcon 9, i.e. the upper stage and potentially the payload fairing. As such, the difference in cost between a Falcon 9 and a Falcon Heavy launch is limited, mainly to the extra fuel and refurbishing three as opposed to one booster core.

In 1932, it was modified again and the entire structure was raised to a height of by placing the older tower on a new steel base in diameter, that increased the focal height to forty-two feet. The station was automated in 1973. It is listed as number 20975 in the USCG light lists.  History  The lighthouse was first established in 1893 as a set of range lights. In 1895, a fifth-order lens replaced the original lantern; increasing the effective range of the light to 11 miles. In 1907, with the keeper's accommodations still unbuilt, the wooden tower was in a significant state of distress and the decision was made to replace the tower. It was rebuilt in 1908. It stood high. The original lens has been replaced by a plastic lens.  Keepers  The Light has had several keepers throughout its long history even prior to the construction of the tower. Ole Hansen was the first to man the light from 1893 ‚Äì 1895. Charles E. Young followed in 1895 and remained until 1899. The third keeper was Nelson Knudsen who manned it from 1899 to 1901. In 1901, Gustavus Umberham transferred to Algoma from the Cedar River Lighthouse; bringing his five children with him. Umberham drowned on February 3, 1913, during a boat trip with three acquaintances, he was swept overboard by a large wave. Eugene Kimball, a close friend of Umberham was transferred to the station in April 1913. Kimball was manned the light until 1923 when he was transferred. After Kimball left, Carl J. Graan manned the lighthouse from 1923 to 1944.

They are close to the town of North Berwick and the village of Whitekirk, and are approximately east of Edinburgh.  Saint Baldred's legacy  Auldhame Castle It is said that the 8th-century Christian missionary Saint Baldred had one of his bases at Auldhame, and through his influence the parish of Auldhame had significant influence in the development of Christianity in Scotland. His name also lives on in St Baldred's Church and St Baldred's Road in North Berwick. Following his death there was a dispute between the parishes of Auldhame, Tyninghame, and Prestonkirk, as to which should have his body. The story goes that by the advice of a Holy Man, they spent the night in prayer. In the morning three bodies were found, in all respects alike, each in its winding sheet, prepared for burial. To this day all three churches maintain Saint Baldred was buried within their walls. In 2005 skeletal and archaeological remains, thought to be a church, were discovered in a field at Auldhame. Initial estimates that the church dated from the Medieval period were later proved wrong, and it was established that the find may even date from the time of Saint Baldred himself. History In the 16th century Auldhame belonged to the Otterburn family: Scoughall belonged to the Auchmoutie family. In 1618 the poet John Taylor visited the Auchmouties and ate solan goose from the Bass from a buffet.Hume Brown, P., ed., Early Travellers in Scotland, (1891/1978), 113, 126-127. Sands at Scoughall were a hazard to shipping. In 1581 Margaret Hay, Lady Tyninghame, acquired two iron cannon from an English ship that had perished on the sands.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1880), pp. 367-8. Gin Head is the site of a former Admiralty signals base constructed in 1943. Today Today there is little in the area except farming. The houses at Auldhame and Scoughall are given little thought by those driving to North Berwick or visiting nearby Seacliff or Tantallon Castle. Indeed, such visitors are likely to be gazing towards the Bass Rock rather than considering the scattered houses and cottages at the roadside. Link to Robert Louis Stevenson In 1919, John Robert Dale bought the estate of Seacliff, Scoughall and Auldhame after being tenant farmer of Scoughall since 1848, and Auldhame since 1834. The three estates remain to this day in the ownership of the Dale family. The novelist Robert Louis Stevenson was related to John Robert Dale and spent several boyhood holidays at Scoughall. It was here in front of the farmhouse fire that the young Stevenson first heard the story of how folks in these parts on dark stormy nights, when winds used to lash the coast, lured sailing ships onto the rocks by displaying misleading lantern lights. The 'Pagans of Scoughall' had the worst of reputations. They were said to tie a horse's neck to its knee and attach a lantern to the rope, then drive the horse slowly along the cliffs, so that a vessel out at sea would think it a ship riding at anchor, and come in, only to be wrecked on the rocky reef known as the Great Car and be plundered by the ghoulish people. These tales gave Stevenson the idea for his story 'The Wreckers'. Stevenson also wrote in his novel 'Catriona' (sequel to Kidnapped) of the 'lights of Scoughall' and purposely put 'Tam Dale' in charge of the prisoners on the Bass Rock.

The falciform ligament, , is a broad and thin fold of peritoneum, its base being directed downward and backward and its apex upward and forward. The falciform ligament droops down from the hilum of the liver. Structure The falciform ligament stretches obliquely from the front to the back of the abdomen, with one surface in contact with the peritoneum behind the right rectus abdominis muscle and the diaphragm, and the other in contact with the left lobe of the liver. The ligament stretches from the underside of the diaphragm to the posterior surface of the sheath of the right rectus abdominis muscle, as low down as the umbilicus; by its right margin it extends from the notch on the anterior margin of the liver, as far back as the posterior surface. It is composed of two layers of peritoneum closely united together. Its base or free edge contains, between its layers, the round ligament and the paraumbilical veins. =Development= It is a remnant of the embryonic ventral mesentery. The umbilical vein of the fetus gives rise to the round ligament of liver in the adult, which is found in the free border of the falciform ligament. Clinical significance The falciform ligament can become canalised if an individual is suffering from portal hypertension. Due to the increase in venous congestion, blood is pushed down from the liver towards the anterior abdominal wall and if blood pools here, will result in dilatation of veins around the umbilicus. If these veins radiate out from the umbilicus, they can give the appearance of a head (the umbilicus) with hair of snakes (the veins) - this is referred to as caput medusae.Misdraji J, Embryology, anatomy, histology, and developmental anomalies of the liver.

Chaffee, Lake, Park, Teller, Douglas, El Paso, Elbert, Lincoln, Kit Carson and Cheyenne. History Pope John Paul II created the Diocese of Colorado Springs from territory separated from the Archdiocese of Denver and Diocese of Pueblo in 1983. The territory includes 39 parishes with approximately 173,321 Catholics in a total population of 1,083,259. Bishop Richard Hanifen created the diocesan arms which features a snow-capped purple mountain on a blue (azure) field that represents Pikes Peak. Below the mountain are green hills, and a blue and silver representing the spring for which the area and diocese are named. In the waters of the lower portion of the shield are three gold interlocked rings which represent the Holy Trinity. On October 16, 2020, it was revealed that all three of Colorado's Catholic Dioceses, including the Diocese of Colorado Springs, had paid $6.6 million in compensation to 81 victims of clergy sex abuse within the past year, regardless of how long ago the abuse happened. Coat of arms Bishop Robert C. Hannifen, the first bishop of the diocese, designed its coat of arms, shown in the right sidebar at the top of this article, upon its erection in 1984,Right sidebar on \\"About\\" Page of diocesan web site. The coat of arms features a shield divided vertically into three regions. * The purple mountain, snowcapped in argent (silver or white), on a blue and green background in the upper region represents Pike's Peak, a focal point of the physical topography of the diocese. Spiritually, it represents the \\"mountain of the Lord\\" of the prophet Isaiah signifying the presence of a faithful, loving God as a rock of refuge and strength. * The blue and argent ripples spanning the middle region are the heraldic representation of water, signifying the springs that gave their name to the diocesan see. Spiritually, these ripples signify the saving waters of baptism through which people of diverse cultures profess belief in \\"one body, one spirit, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father of all who is over all and works through all and is in all.\\" (Ephesians 4:4-5). * Three interlocking circles of or (gold or yellow) on a blue background in the lower region reflect the concepts of mutuality, community, and prophecy calling the People of God to be a sign and sacrament of the reign of God growing within them and to announce the good news of Christ's presences.

It is also the closest domestic airport with scheduled flights to the town of Greymouth 40 km further north, the largest settlement on the coast. The airport handles aircraft up to ATR 72-500 size that are operated by the national airline, Air New Zealand. The airport has a single terminal and 2 tarmac gates. History Air Travel (NZ) Ltd was the first airline in New Zealand to fly scheduled air services. Founded by Bert Mercer in 1934, its first scheduled flight took place on 18 December 1934, from Hokitika to Haast in South Westland. During the Second World War they also flew north from Hokitika to Greymouth, Westport and Nelson. Hokitika originally had an aerodrome on the south side of town just over the Hokitika River. The grass surfaces and susceptibility to flooding of Hokitika's Southside airfield were always problematic. On 9 August 1948 the Southside airfield at Hokitika was closed. Plans were well underway for a new airport at Hokitika. The new Seaview airport opened on 17 December 1951. The opening also marked the extension of the Lodestar service to Westport and onto Wellington southward to Hokitika and the introduction of the larger Lodestar marked the end of NAC services to Greymouth. From this point on a road link between Greymouth town centre and Hokitika Airport was established to connect with NAC's scheduled flights. Hokitika received its first true airliner service on 2 March 1953 when NAC introduced its 24-seater Douglas DC-3 service from Paraparaumu (Wellington being closed for the construction of the new airport), Nelson and Westport. NAC inaugurated its Christchurch-Hokitika Friendship service on 20 December 1968. Fokker Friendship ZK-BXI flew the first flight. By 1974 16,945 people were flying through Hokitika each year and from 14 September 1974 NAC introduced Saturday flights from Hokitika to Christchurch. This was the first time Hokitika had a daily air service. ATR 72 (ZK-MCC) Prepares to return to Christchurch. Taken at Hokitika airport. Airlines and destinations Operational information The aerodrome is operated by Hokitika Airport Ltd. The airport company is owned by the Westland District Council. The main runway has a landing distance of 1,314 metres, but for take off is considered to have a distance of 1,374m. This will be extended with un- paved gravel in 2013 by 240m to allow limited trans-tasman charter flights. New lighting will be installed. The airport has a number of car rental firms represented, and a small snack bar.

Description The Carp River is formed by the outflow of Trout Lake (also known as Carp Lake) in southern Trout Lake Township in Chippewa County at in the eastern Upper Peninsula. The river flows generally south and east into Mackinac County. The Carp River flows for much of its length through the eastern region of the Hiawatha National Forest. A central portion of the river, near M-123, flows through the Mackinac Wilderness, jointly preserved by the U.S. Forest Service and the Great Lakes Indian Fish & Wildlife Commission of the Ojibwa Indians. In contrast to much of the Upper Peninsula, the Carp River's watershed is relatively flat, and there are only a few small rapids on the river. It is often used by canoeists. Fishermen can find brook trout, brown trout, and rainbow trout in the river in summer, with some salmon in fall. Close to its mouth, the Carp River is spanned by the Mackinac Trail ‚Äì Carp River Bridge, a 1920 spandrel arch bridge that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in December 1999.

He was a deep lying playmaker, well-known for his wide range of passing. He started his professional career at Sochaux, and played there from 1999 to 2004. Following brief stints with Marseille and Lyon where he spent one season each he joined Auxerre in 2006. In 2011 he left the club for Lille before moving to Ajaccio in 2013. He last stint was at Nancy, from 2015 to 2018. At international level, Pedretti gained 22 caps for the France's national team between 2002 and 2005. Club career =Sochaux= Pedretti began his career at FC Sochaux-Montb√©liard in 1999, in the club's youth system, and in the same year, he played his first professional match. Sochaux finished the season in fourth place in the Division 2 missing out on promotion to the Ligue 1. The following season, Pedretti, despite his inexperience, became a mainstay of the team taking part in all matches and thereby contributing to Sochaux's championship in the Division 2 in 2001. He became a regular first team player in the 2002‚Äì2003 Ligue 1 season making 35 league appearances and scoring 3 goals. The team also had a strong cup run that year, reaching the final of the Coupe de la Ligue, but losing 4‚Äì1 to Monaco. Pedretti featured in the UEFA Cup with Sochaux the following year as they qualified for European football. However they struggled to make any significant impact on the competition. =Marseille= Pedretti then moved to Olympique de Marseille for a transfer fee of ‚Ç¨4.5 million in 2004. At Marseille, he found it difficult to cement his place in the starting line-up in a season marked by instability at the club with many players coming and going and coach Jos√© Anigo being replaced by Philippe Troussier during the season. =Lyon= He made 31 appearances in all competitions before moving to Olympique Lyonnais in 2005 for ‚Ç¨7 million after one season at Marseille. Pedretti was again used sparingly at the club which at the time had fierce competition for midfield places. Pedretti only amassed 21 appearances in all competitions and was often denied a place by the likes of Florent Malouda and Juninho Pernambucano spending much time on the bench. He made his Champions League debut but was involved in only 21 league games in his only season for Lyon. =Auxerre= Pedretti again moved, this time to AJ Auxerre for a ‚Ç¨6 million fee in 2006 after he decided to make a fresh start. This move gave Pedretti the first team action he had desired with him being a mainstay in their midfield for several years. During his time at the club he featured in the UEFA Cup and the Champions League. During the subsequent 2007‚Äì08 season, he became captain of the \\"AJA\\", following the departure of Beno√Æt Cheyrou to Marseille. He continued to show good performances, especially during the quarterfinals of the League Cup where he scored a decisive goal in stoppage time against his former team Marseille. With multiple injuries keeping the Auxerre captain sidelined for several months during the 2010‚Äì2011 season, Pedretti participated in twenty league games. After the end of the season, Pedretti stated his desire to leave Auxerre with league title holders Lille OSC being his preferred club. Pedretti amassed 170 appearances during his five-year stay. He was a highly influential member of the squad and featured for the national team, increasing his total to 22 caps. =Lille= Pedretti was signed by Lille for an undisclosed fee on the opening day of the summer 2011 transfer window as a replacement for Newcastle United F.C.-bound Yohan Cabaye. Pedretti said, ‚ÄúIt [Lille] is a very good club with great, interesting challenges. [‚Ä¶] My choice is to come to Lille.\\" =Ajaccio= On 4 August 2013, Pedretti agreed a two-year deal with AC Ajaccio. Pedretti scored a wonder goal for Ajaccio in his second game for the club, netting from twenty yards out, in a 1‚Äì1 draw with reigning champions PSG on 18 August. Ajaccio decided not to renew his contract in 2015. Thus, he became a free agent. =Nancy= On 1 August 2015, Pedretti signed a one-year contract with AS Nancy, with an option for a second year. In January 2018, having struggled with injuries at the end of the 2016‚Äì17 and the beginning of the 2017‚Äì18 season, he announced his retirement from professional football. He took up the role of assistant coach to Patrick Gabriel. International career On 20 November 2002, Pedretti made his debut for the France national football team that year, coming on as a late substitution for Lilian Thuram in a 3‚Äì0 win over Serbia and Montenegro. He was part of the French squad that won the Confederations Cup in 2003 and reached the quarter-finals at Euro 2004 when France were knocked out by the eventual champions Greece in the quarter finals by the score 1‚Äì0. He played 22 internationals for France the last of which was against Hungary in a 2‚Äì1 win. Personal life Pedretti is married and has one child, a daughter, Lena born on 29 August 2005.

It is a collection of 400 love poems with invocatory poem dedicated to Shiva. The collected poems were composed by 144 poets, except 3 poems which are by anonymous author(s). The poems range between 13 and 31 lines, and are long enough to include more details of the subject, episode and its context. According to Kamil Zvelebil ‚Äì a Tamil literature and history scholar, they are \\"one of the most valuable collections\\" from ancient Tamil history perspective. The Akananuru anthology is notable for its mathematical arrangement: the odd number poems are dedicated to palai (arid landscape); poem number ten and its multiples (10, 20, 30, etc., up to 400) are neytal (coastal landscape); poems bearing number 2 and then in increments of 6 followed by 4 (that is number 8, 12, 18, 22, 28, etc.) belong to the ku·πüi√±ci (mountainous landscape); poems bearing number 4 and then in increments of 10 (14, 24, 34, 44, etc.) are mullai (pastoral forests); poems with number 6 and then in increments of 10 (16, 26, 36, etc.) are marutam (riverine farmlands). The anthology was compiled by Uruttiracanman, the son of Maturai Uppurikuti Kilan under the patronage of the Pandyan king Ukkiraperuvaluti. The Akananuru poems offer many valuable cultural insights as well as historically significant evidence and allusions. For example, poem 69, 281 and 375 mention the Maurya Empire, poems 251 and 265 allude to the Nandas, the poem 148 mentions Greek-Romans (Yavanas) as trading gold for pepper through Muziris ‚Äì an ancient Kerala port near Kochi, and a number of poems echo the Hindu puranic legends about Parasurama, Rama, Krishna and others. According to Alf Hiltebeitel ‚Äì an Indian Religions and Sanskrit Epics scholar, the Akana·πâ≈´·πüu has the earliest known mentions of some stories such as \\"Krishna stealing sarees of Gopis\\" which is found later in north Indian literature, making it probable that some of the ideas from Tamil Hindu scholars inspired the Sanskrit scholars in the north and the Bhagavata Purana, rather than vice versa. According to Kamil Zvelebil ‚Äì a scholar of Tamil literature and history, a few poems in the Akananuru were probably composed sometime between 1st century BCE and 2nd century CE, the middle layer between 2nd and 4th century CE, while the last layers were completed sometime between 3rd and 5th century CE. Other names for Akananuru include Ahappattu, Ahananuru, and Agananuru. Authors As many as 145 poets are said to have contributed to Akananuru collection. Perunthevanaar, who translated the Mahabharatham into Tamil, is one of the authors. Rudrasarman compiled this anthologyReddy 2003, p. A-240 at the behest of the Pandya king Ukkiraperuvazhuthi. Date The Akananuru poems were likely composed later in the Sangam period than other akam poetry based on the linguistic evidence, the introduction of mathematical arrangement, and given the mention of overseas trade and north Indian dynasties. According to Takanobu Takahashi, the Akananuru poems were composed over several centuries, likely from 1st to 3rd century CE. Other scholars such as Vaiyapuri Pillai chronologically place the Akana·πâ≈´·πüu after the Narrinai and Ku·πüuntokai anthologies. According to Kamil Zvelebil, except for a few Akananuru poems such as 10, 35, 140 which were probably completed between 1st century BCE and 2nd century CE, while few poems are believed to be composed around the late 2nd century BCE based on the mentions of the Maurya and the Nanda empire. Most of the Akananuru was likely composed sometime between the 2nd and 5th century CE. Poetic characteristics Agana·πâ≈´·πüu book comes under the Agam category in its subject matter. The poems of this anthology are of the Akaval meter. Akananuru contains 401 stanzas and is divided into three sections # Kalintruyanainirai (‡Æï‡Æ≥‡Æø‡Æ±‡Øç‡Æ±‡ØÅ‡ÆØ‡Ææ‡Æ©‡Øà‡Æ®‡Æø‡Æ±‡Øà), 121 stanzas # Manimidaipavalam (‡ÆÆ‡Æ£‡Æø‡ÆÆ‡Æø‡Æü‡Øà‡Æ™‡Æµ‡Æ≥‡ÆÆ‡Øç), 180 stanzas # Nittilakkovai (‡Æ®‡Æø‡Æ§‡Øç‡Æ§‡Æø‡Æ≤‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡Øã‡Æµ‡Øà), 100 stanzas English Translations Bharathidasan University has published a full translation of all the 400 songs by A. Dakshinamurthy in 3 volumes in 1999: Ramayana Reference Akana·πâ≈´·πüu has a reference to the Ramayana in poem 70. The poem places a triumphant Rama at Dhanushkodi, sitting under a Banyan tree, involved in some secret discussions, when the birds are chirping away. This seems to indicate that the story of the Ramayana was familiar in the Tamil lands before the Kamba Ramayanam of the 12th century.

Horr's Island (now called Key Marco, not to be confused with the archaeological site Key Marco) is on the south side of Marco Island in Collier County, Florida. The site includes four mounds and a shell ring. It has one of the oldest known mound burials in the eastern United States, dating to about 3400 radiocarbon years Before Present (BP). One of the mounds has been dated to as early as 6700 BP. It was the largest known community in the southeastern United States to have been permanently occupied during the Archaic period (8000 BCE-1000 BCE). The island is named for Capt. John Foley Horr, who raised pineapples on the island in the late 19th century. The Capt. John Foley Horr House was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on October 8, 1997. In the late 1980s, a development company planned to build a bridge to Horr's Island and develop it. In response to state law requiring an archaeological assessment of the island before it could be developed, the development company funded a research project. The research team carried out excavations for three months.Brown:31‚Äì32  Mounds  Four mounds were identified on Horr's Island, but Mounds B and C were found to be simple middens, and were not investigated in depth. A flexed burial was found in Mound B. The other two mounds were complex and appeared to be purposely constructed. Mound A, the largest at 20 feet in height, had a large pile of shells at its core. There was no evidence of prior habitation on the ground surface where the shells had been piled. Several layers of sand had been added over the shells. One layer of sand had charcoal added. The additions of sand by individual baskets could be distinguished by the variations in the amount of charcoal in the sand. The final layer of sand had shells mixed in it, and the mound was topped by another layer of shells.Brown:36Milanich:102-04 Two burials were found in Mound A. The graves had been dug into the top of the mound after it was completed. Radiocarbon testing for one of the burials yielded a date of about 3,400 years Before Present. This is the oldest known mound burial in the eastern United States. As the center of Mound A was not excavated, it is unknown whether there were other burials in the mound.Brown:36 Various samples from Mound A have been dated to 3620‚Äì4760 BP. Mound D, the other purpose-built mound, has been dated to 4450 BP. Mound C has been dated to 4870‚Äì4860 BP. Samples from Mound B yielded dates between 6730 and 4030 BP.Russo:13‚Äì14  Shell ring  The Horr's Island site includes a shell ring, in which shell middens surround a central open space. A large number of shell rings from the Late Archaic period are found along the southern South Carolina and Georgia coasts, with a few scattered along the coast of the Florida peninsula and along the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico as far west as the Pearl River. Shell rings were associated with the earliest known sedentary settlements along the coasts of the Southeastern United States.Russo:27 The shell ring at Horr's Island was an elongated horseshoe shape. It is one of the few sites where a shell ring is definitely associated with ceremonial mounds. The shell ring was 160 by 100 meters, and the central area, or plaza, was 125 meters at its widest. The middens making up the ring were up to three meters high. The shell ring has been dated to between 4800 and 4200 Before Present.Russo:26, 27, 94  Tools and dwellings  No evidence of pottery was found at Horr's Island. Wood, fiber and hide products were not preserved in the sandy soil, but bones were preserved very well. The only tools that survived were made from stone and shell. As there is no local supply of stones that will take and keep an edge, the people made many tools from shells. A single point of chert was found in the excavations, and probably was a trade item from elsewhere. Grooved slabs of sandy limestone, and small round stones that fit in the grooves, may have been used to sharpen shell tools and grind seeds or dried fish. Shells were used as hammers, awls, celts and digging tools, and as bowls, dippers and spoons.Brown:34‚Äì35Milanich:103 More than 600 postholes were found in the excavations. Their arrangement indicated that small circular structures were built using saplings as uprights. It was assumed that the tops of the poles were bent over to meet in the middle, and covered with palm leaf thatching.Brown:35  Food  Bones recovered in the excavation included 74 species of fish and shellfish, but only eight species of land animals. Oysters were the most common food consumed. Other shellfish included quahogs, surf clams, scallops, whelks and conchs. The large number of fish bones recovered allowed for a detailed analysis. Almost all of the fish were small and of the same size. The archaeologists theorize that the fish were caught in nets with a mesh size of about 1/4 inch. As the nets would have had to be pulled by hand, bigger fish would have been able to escape by leaping over the net or swimming away before the net was closed. Carbonized plant seeds were found in hearths and living areas. These included the tiny seeds of a panicoid grass, and sea grape, cocoplum, prickly pear and wild grape.Brown:34‚Äì36Milanich:103-04  Permanent occupation  Some of the fish and shellfish caught and eaten by the inhabitants of Horr's Island gave clues as to what time in the year they were caught. The three most common kinds of fish in the Horr's Island diet, catfish, threadfin herring and pinfish, were caught while immature. The time of year when they were caught is indicated by the average size of a group of harvested fish. Bay scallops disappear from the area each winter, and new scallops start growing in the spring, so the size of the scallop shells also indicates the time of year when they were gathered. Finally, quahogs have seasonal bands in their shells, which can be used to determine what season, or even what month, the quahog was gathered.Brown:36‚Äì38 Analysis of the bones and shells found at the site indicate that quahogs were gathered in the winter and spring, scallops were gathered in the summer, and the fish were caught mainly in the fall, but also in winter and summer. The archaeologists concluded that Horr's Island was occupied year-round during the late Archaic period. Horr's Island is the largest known community in the southeastern United States to be permanently occupied during the Archaic period.Brown:37‚Äì38 See also *Mound builder (people) *Earthwork (archaeology)  Notes  References  Geography of Collier County, Florida Archaeological sites on the National Register of Historic Places in Florida Shell rings Mounds in Florida 7th-millennium BC establishments National Register of Historic Places in Collier County, Florida ","title":"Horr's Island"},{"id":"4349101","text":"Erika Ostrovsky (born May 30, 1926) wrote C√©line and his Vision (1967).

In the 19th century the placing of spectacular antiquities in the new museums brought unusual interest from the general public to Oriental studies. Oriental studies is the academic field of study that embraces Near Eastern and Far Eastern societies and cultures, languages, peoples, history and archaeology; in recent years the subject has often been turned into the newer terms of Middle Eastern studies and Asian studies. Traditional Oriental studies in Europe is today generally focused on the discipline of Islamic studies, while the study of China, especially traditional China, is often called Sinology. The study of East Asia in general, especially in the United States, is often called East Asian studies. European study of the region formerly known as \\"the Orient\\" had primarily religious origins, which has remained an important motivation until recent times. This is partly due to how the Abrahamic religions in Europe (Christianity, Judaism and Islam) originated in the Middle East, as well as the rise of Islam in the 7th century, and consequently there was much interest in the origin of these faiths, and Western culture in general. Learning from Arabic medicine and philosophy, and the Greek translations from Arabic, was an important factor in the Middle Ages. Linguistic knowledge preceded a wider study of cultures and history, and as Europe began to encroach upon the region, political and economic factors encouraged growth in academic study. From the late 18th century, archaeology became a link from the discipline to a wide European public, as treasures pillaged during colonial contacts filled new European museums. The modern study was influenced both by imperialist attitudes and interests, and also the sometimes naive fascination of the exotic East for Mediterranean and European writers and thinkers, captured in images by artists, that is embodied in a repeatedly-surfacing theme in the history of ideas in the West, called \\"Orientalism\\". In the last century, scholars from the region itself have participated on equal terms in the discipline.  History  = Pre-Islam = The original distinction between the \\"West\\" and the \\"East\\" was crystallized in the Greco-Persian Wars of the 5th century BC, when Athenian historians made a distinction between their \\"Athenian democracy\\" and the Persian monarchy. An institutional distinction between East and West did not exist as a defined polarity before the Oriens- and Occidens-divided administration of the Emperor Diocletian's Roman Empire at the end of the 3rd century AD, and the division of the Empire into Latin and Greek-speaking portions. The classical world had intimate knowledge of their Ancient Persian neighbours (and usually enemies), but very imprecise knowledge of most of the world further East, including the \\"Seres\\" (Chinese). However, there was substantial direct Roman trade with India (unlike with China) in the Imperial period. = Middle Ages = Hayton of Corycus remitting his report on the Mongols, to Pope Clement V, in 1307 The rise of Islam and Muslim conquests in the 7th century established a sharp opposition, or even a sense of polarity, between medieval European Christendom and the medieval Islamic world (which stretched from the Middle East and Central Asia to North Africa and Andalusia). Popular medieval European knowledge of cultures farther to the East was poor, dependent on the wildly fictionalised travels of Sir John Mandeville and legends of Prester John, although the equally famous, and much longer, account by Marco Polo were more accurate. Scholarly work was initially largely linguistic in nature, with primarily a religious focus on understanding both Biblical Hebrew and languages like Syriac with early Christian literature, but also from a wish to understand Arabic works on medicine, philosophy and science. This effort, also called the Studia Linguarum existed sporadically throughout the Middle Ages, and the \\"Renaissance of the 12th century\\" witnessed a particular growth in translations of Arabic texts into Latin, with figures like Constantine the African, who translated 37 books, mostly medical texts, from Arabic to Latin, and Herman of Carinthia, one of the translators of the Qur'an. The earliest translation of the Qur'an into Latin was completed in 1143, although little use was made of it until it was printed in 1543, after which it was translated into other European languages. Gerard of Cremona and others based themselves in Al-Andaluz to take advantage of the Arabic libraries and scholars there. However, as the Christian Reconquista in the Iberian peninsula accelerated in the 11th century and subsequent centuries, such contacts became rarer in Spain. Chairs of Hebrew, Arabic and Aramaic were briefly established at Oxford, and four other universities following the Council of Vienne (1312).Hebrew to Latin, Latin to Hebrew: the mirroring of two cultures 2006 Page 75 Giulio Busi, Freie Universit√§t Berlin. Institut f√ºr Judaistik - 2006 \\"According to the famous decision of the council of Vienne (1311‚Äì1312), Oxford was chosen as one of four universities (with Paris, Bologna and Salamanca) where Hebrew, Arabic, Greek and Aramaic were to be taught.\\" There was a vague but increasing knowledge of the complex civilisations in China and India, from which luxury goods (notably cotton and silk textiles as well as ceramics) were imported. Although the Crusades produced relatively little in the way of scholarly interchange, the eruption of the Mongol Empire had strategic implications for both the Crusader kingdoms and Europe itself, and led to extended diplomatic contacts. From the Age of Exploration, European interest in mapping Asia, and especially the sea-routes, became intense, though mostly pursued outside the universities. = Renaissance to 1800 = Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (ÂæêÂÖâÂïü) (right) in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements (Âπæ‰ΩïÂéüÊú¨) published in 1607 University Oriental studies became systematic during the Renaissance, with the linguistic and religious aspects initially continuing to dominate. There was also a political dimension, as translations for diplomatic purposes were needed, even before the West engaged actively with the East beyond the Ottoman Empire. A landmark was the publication in Spain in 1514 of the first Polyglot Bible, containing the complete existing texts in Hebrew and Aramaic, in addition to Greek and Latin. At Cambridge University there has been a Regius Professor of Hebrew since 1540 (the fifth oldest regular chair there), and the chair in Arabic was founded in about 1643. Oxford followed for Hebrew in 1546 (both chairs were established by Henry VIII). Distinguished scholars included Edmund Castell, who published his Lexicon Heptaglotton Hebraicum, Chaldaicum, Syriacum, Samaritanum, Aethiopicum, Arabicum, et Persicum in 1669, whilst some scholars like Edward Pococke had travelled to the East and wrote also on the modern history and society of Eastern peoples. The University of Salamanca had Professors of Oriental Languages from at least the 1570s. In France, Colbert initiated a training programme for \\"Les Jeunes de langues\\", young linguists with the diplomatic service, like Fran√ßois P√©tis de la Croix, who like his father and his son served as Arabic interpreter to the King. Study of the Far East was pioneered by missionaries, especially Matteo Ricci and others in the Jesuit China missions, and missionary motives were to remain important, at least in linguistic studies. During the 18th century, Western scholars reached a reasonable basic level of understanding of the geography and most of the history of the region, though knowledge of the areas least accessible to Western travelers, like Japan and Tibet, and their languages, remained limited. Enlightenment thinkers characterized aspects of the pagan East as superior to the Christian West, in Montesquieu's Lettres Persanes or Voltaire's ironic promotion of Zoroastrianism; others, like Edward Gibbon, praised the relative religious tolerance of the Middle East as opposed to the intolerant Christian West, and many, including Diderot and Voltaire, the high social status of scholarship in Mandarin China. The Universit√† degli Studi di Napoli \\"L'Orientale\\" (English: University of Naples \\"L'Orientale\\"), founded in Naples, Italy, in 1732, is the oldest school of Sinology and Oriental Studies of the European continent. The end of the 18th century saw the beginnings in the great increase in study of the archaeology of the period, which was to be an ever-more important aspect of the field through the next century. Egyptology led the way, and as with many other ancient cultures, provided the linguists with new material for decipherment and study. = Nineteenth century = The old building of the Asiatic Society in Calcutta, founded by William Jones in 1784 With a great increase in knowledge of Asia among Western specialists, increasing political and economic involvement in the region, and in particular the realization of the existence of close relations between Indian and European languages, by William Jones, there emerged more complex intellectual connections between the early history of Eastern and Western cultures. Some of these developments occurred in the context of Franco‚ÄìBritish rivalry for control of India. Liberal economists, such as James Mill, denigrated Eastern civilizations as static and corrupt. Karl Marx, himself of Jewish origin, characterized the Asiatic mode of production as unchanging, because of the economic narrowness of village economies and the State's role in production. Oriental despotism was generally regarded in Europe as a major factor in the relative failure of progress of Eastern societies. The study of Islam in particular was central to the field since the majority of people living in the geographical area termed 'the Orient' were Muslims. Interest in understanding Islam was partly fueled by economic considerations of growing trade in the Mediterranean region and the changing cultural and intellectual climate of the time.Zachary Lockman, Contending Visions of the Middle East, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004:44 In the course of the century Western archaeology spread across the Middle East and Asia, with spectacular results. In the 1850s, for example, the French Government was determined to mount large-scale operations in Assyria and Mesopotamia to showcase its dominance in the region. An archaeological team led by Victor Place excavated the palace of the Assyrian King Sargon II in Khorsabad (formerly Nineveh), would become the first systematic excavation of the site.Potts, D.T.

The first serious European studies of Buddhism and Hinduism were by the scholars Eugene Burnouf and Max M√ºller. In that time, the academic study of Islam also developed, and, by the mid-19th century, Oriental Studies was a well-established academic discipline in most European countries, especially those with imperial interests in the region. Yet, while scholastic study expanded, so did racist attitudes and stereotypes of Asian peoples and cultures. This frequently extended to local Jewish and Romani communities, who were also of Oriental origin and widely recognized as such. Scholarship often was intertwined with prejudicial racist and religious presumptions,J. Go, \\"'Racism' and Colonialism: Meanings of Difference and Ruling Practice in America's Pacific Empire\\" in Qualitative Sociology' 27.1 (March 2004). to which the new biological sciences tended to contribute until the end of the Second World War. = Twentieth century = Experts inspecting the Rosetta Stone during the Second International Congress of Orientalists in London, 1874 The participation in academic studies by scholars from the newly independent nations of the region itself inevitably changed the nature of studies considerably, with the emergence of post-colonial studies and Subaltern Studies. The influence of Orientalism (in the sense used by Edward Said in his book of the same name) in scholarship on the Middle East was seen to have re- emerged and risen in prevalence again after the end of the Cold War. It is contended that this was partly a response to \\"a lacuna\\" in identity politics in international relations generally, and within the 'West' particularly, which was brought about by the absence of Soviet communism as a global adversary.Jochen Hippler and Andrea Lueg (eds.), The Next Threat: Western Perceptions of Islam (Pluto Press/The Transnational Institute, London, 1995), p. 1. The post‚ÄìCold War era has been marked by discussions of Islamist terrorism framing views on the extent to which the culture of the Arab world and Islam is a threat to that of the West. The essence of this debate reflects a presupposition for which Orientalism has been criticized - that the 'Orient' is defined exclusively by Islam. Such considerations as these were seen to have occurred in the wider context of the way in which many Western scholars responded to international politics in the post‚ÄìCold War world; and they were arguably heightened following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.Zachary Lockman, Contending Visions of the Middle East: The History and Politics of Orientalism (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2004), pp. 223‚Äì233. Symbolic of this type of response to the end of the Cold War was the popularization of the 'clash of civilizations' thesis. This particular idea of a fundamental conflict between East and West was first advanced by Bernard Lewis in an article entitled \\"The Roots of Muslim Rage\\", written in 1990. Again, this was seen as a way of accounting for new forms and lines of division in post‚ÄìCold War international society. The 'clash of civilizations' approach involved another characteristic of Orientalist thought; namely, the tendency to see the region as being one, homogenous 'civilization', rather than as comprising various different and diverse cultures and strands. It was an idea that was taken on more famously by Samuel Huntington in his 1993 article in Foreign Affairs, called \\"The Clash of Civilizations?\\".Zachary Lockman, p. 233. Orientology postal stamp published in India  \\"Orientalism\\" and Oriental studies  The Women of Algiers, 1834, by Eug√®ne Delacroix is one of the earliest paintings from Western painters in the \\"Eastern world\\". The term Orientalism has come to acquire negative connotations in some quarters and is interpreted to refer to the study of the East by Westerners shaped by the attitudes of the era of European imperialism in the 18th and 19th centuries. When used in this sense, it often implies prejudiced, outsider- caricatured interpretations of Eastern cultures and peoples. This viewpoint was most famously articulated and propagated by Edward Said in Orientalism (1978), a critical history of this scholarly tradition. In contrast, the term has also been used by some modern scholars to refer to writers of the Imperialist era who had pro-Eastern attitudes, as opposed to those who saw nothing of value in non-Western cultures.For example Thomas R. Trautmann in Aryans and British India, 1997,  From \\"Oriental Studies\\" to \\"Asian Studies\\"  Like the term Orient, Orientalism derives from the Latin word oriens (rising) and, equally likely, from the Greek word ('he'oros', the direction of the rising sun). \\"Orient\\" is the opposite of Occident, a term for the Western world. In terms of the Old World, Europe was considered the Occident (the west), and its farthest-known extreme the Orient (the east). Dating from the Roman Empire until the Middle Ages, what is now, in the West, considered 'the Middle East' was then considered 'the Orient'. However, use of the various terms and senses derived from \\"Orient\\" has greatly declined in the 20th century, not least as trans-Pacific links between Asia and America have grown; nowadays, Asia usually arrives at the USA from the West. In most North American and Australian universities, Oriental Studies has now been replaced by Asian Studies. In many cases the field has been localised to specific regions, such as Middle Eastern or Near Eastern Studies, South Asian studies, and East Asian Studies. This reflects the fact that the Orient is not a single, monolithic region but rather a broad area encompassing multiple civilizations. The generic concept of Oriental Studies, to its opponents, has lost any use it may have once had and is perceived as obstructing changes in departmental structures to reflect actual patterns of modern scholarship. In many universities, like Chicago, the faculties and institutions have divided; the Biblical languages may be linked with theological institutes, and the study of ancient civilizations in the region may come under a different faculty to studies of modern periods. In 1970, the Faculty of Oriental Studies at the Australian National University was re-named the Faculty of Asian Studies. In 2007 the Faculty of Oriental Studies at Cambridge University was renamed the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies, but Oxford still has its Faculty of Oriental Studies, as do Chicago, Rome, London (covering African studies also), and other universities. Various explanations for the change to \\"Asian studies\\" are offered; a growing number of professional scholars and students of Asian Studies are themselves Asian or from groups of Asian origin (like Asian Americans). This change of labeling may be correlated in some cases to the fact that sensitivity to the term \\"Oriental\\" has been heightened in a more politically correct atmosphere, although it began earlier: Bernard Lewis' own department at Princeton University was renamed a decade before Said wrote his book, a detail that Said gets wrong.Princeton University, Near Eastern Studies department By some, the term \\"Oriental\\" has come to be thought offensive to non-Westerners. Area studies that incorporate not only philological pursuits but identity politics may also account for the hesitation to use the term \\"Oriental\\". Supporters of \\"Oriental Studies\\" counter that the term \\"Asian\\" is just as encompassing as \\"Oriental,\\" and may well have originally had the same meaning, were it derived from an Akkadian word for \\"East\\" (a more common derivation is from one or both of two Anatolian proper names). Replacing one word with another is to confuse historically objectionable opinions about the East with the concept of \\"the East\\" itself. The terms Oriental/Eastern and Occidental/Western are both inclusive concepts that usefully identify large-scale cultural differences. Such general concepts do not preclude or deny more specific ones.

It is the southernmost controlled airport in the Commonwealth. Formed on land reclaimed from the Waihopai/New River Estuary in 1938, the airport was prone to flooding, notably in 1984 when it was inoperable for two months. The Invercargill City Council considered moving the airport back to Dawson Farm, Myross Bush, the original site up to 1942. Instead, a large flood protection scheme was built, but during its construction heavy rain and an unusually high tidal surge flooded it again in 1987. There have been no problems since. The airport has a main secured terminal, a backup international secured terminal and 5 tarmac gates. Invercargill is the twelfth-busiest airport in New Zealand by passenger traffic. Netball sculpture, Invercargill Airport, Southland, New Zealand, 22 July 2005 Flight to Stewart Island, Invercargill Airport History Today's airport is located on what was a tidal estuary lake. The site was chosen as it is closer to the city than the original aerodrome, Dawson Farm, located a then considerable 10 km away northeast of Invercargill . The draining and stabilising of land began in 1936. The continual draining of the surrounding land was (and still is) achieved with the use of a large canal and tidal pumping system. It took until 1939 before a rudimentary landing strip was considered acceptable for light aircraft to land. By then World War Two had begun and the RNZAF used it as an auxiliary field while Dawson Farm remained the air force's aerodrome of choice as heavier patrol bombers could land there. The city council built two hangars and the air force a larger facility. Pre-fabricated office blocks provided basic administration facilities. The airport's first scheduled service was in 1944 by Union Airways ' Lockheed 10 Electra flying from Dunedin . The terminal facilities were little more than two small sheds at the time; and a Union Airways limousine bus service provided passengers a direct link to the downtown terminal located on The Crescent. When the Government nationalized all airlines to create NAC in 1947, the Electra service was replaced by de Havilland DH.89 s. Once the new paved runway was created in 1956 along with a new substantial but temporary terminal, Douglas DC-3 s began operating. Meanwhile, a local airline, Amphibian Airways had started the Stewart Island route in the early 1950s, using Grumman Widgeons. The amphibians also serviced isolated coastal lighthouses and their settlements. Stewart Island Air Services took over in the late 1970s, and was then taken over by Southern Air in 1981, which still provides the air service to Stewart Island as Stewart Island Flights. Growth The runway was lengthened periodically over the years to cater for larger aircraft in time, such as NAC Fokker F27s (1961), NAC Vickers Viscount (1969), culminating with NAC's Boeing 737-200 type in 1975. Other aircraft such as RNZAF Boeing 727-100 and Ansett New Zealand BAe 146 s have used the runway with ease. Currently the runway length is 2210 meters. =Terminal facilities= The passenger terminal facilities originally developed around a striking \\"Festival of Britain\\" styled two-level structure built in 1963, which featured a distinctive lozenge-shaped roof and fully glazed airside walls giving great views of the runway from the upper deck. A ground-level outdoor viewing gallery allowed passengers and well wishers to mingle; this area was in 2002, closed to all but passengers. It was built against the original small 1956-built \\"temporary\\" terminal which was turned into the freight and baggage area. The small control tower in the original structure became a convenient skylight upon the completion of a standard NZCAA five-storey \\"flowerpot\\" control tower in 1962. A jetway was added by Air New Zealand in 1988 to ease passenger comfort during inclement weather. Airlines also provided premium club passenger lounges for their member patrons. As frequency of air services increased, the ground floor space became cramped while the upstairs space was usually empty. After Air New Zealand removed its jetway in 2012, it was decided to look at refurbishing the ground floor and extending it, or replace the structure which had to be brought up to new Earthquake safety codes. New Terminal Building, 2016 In 2013 the airport announced a new terminal building was to be constructed at a cost of $13.3 million, with construction funded by Invercargill City Holdings Ltd (Holdco); the then current terminal was over 50 years old and had major seismic issues that needed to be brought up to new safety codes. It was deemed more economical to demolish and rebuild a new terminal. Construction of the new single-storey structure began in 2014 and gradually built over the site of the old terminal in three stages over approximately 20 months. Opened in 2016, it has an area of 2,900 m2, only slightly bigger than the existing terminal of 2,600 m2 but makes better use of the floor area. Air New Zealand installed a new premium passenger lounge for its frequent flyers. Fitted out in local materials to enhance the region's tourist attractions, the terminal is designed for further expansion. In 2019 a new secured passenger and baggage handling facilities were added for domestic (and occasional international) air services. =Small is more= Regular jet services operated into the airport from 1975 until 1995, when Air New Zealand restructured all its secondary provincial routes after subsidiary Mount Cook Airline introduced the 68-seat ATR 72 -200 into service. Though a turboprop aircraft similar in size to the Viscount, it allowed a higher frequency of departure choices up to eight every weekday including late evenings. The larger-capacity 737s were restricted to three departures a day (including a short morning flight to Dunedin and onto Wellington) with the last flight out at 1630hrs. Air New Zealand resisted local pressure not to remove the jets, convincing Southlanders that the smaller ATR (and later, Q300 ) aircraft would allow for a higher frequency of service with minimal time difference. When fellow subsidiary Air Nelson joined the Invercargill route with the 50-seat Q300 (an aircraft the size of a Fokker F27 -500), this allowed a new non-stop route to Wellington , giving Southlanders direct access to the nation's capital city. =Return of jet services= In December 2018 Air New Zealand announced it would introduce a direct service from and to Auckland , using the Airbus A320 . This service commenced from 25 August 2019 with the arrival of the first Airbus A320 from Auckland, departing Invercargill the next day at 0600. Scheduled morning departures 0600 Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and 0930 Saturday, and returning at 2130 on Monday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Sunday. It is the airline's longest domestic flight. Air New Zealand said the new service is due to increasing demand for flights to Auckland, and it had worked with locals to achieve this. =Made \\"Secured\\"= With the return of domestic jet services in 2019, the airport had to comply with international regulations. This has involved completely fencing in the airport perimeter, upgrading the rescue truck fleet, installing a screening area for departing passengers using jet services as well as x-ray machines for baggage. It also means the airport now has 24-hour security patrols. Being declared Secured also allowed the removal of restrictions to the occasional international flights that have to use the airport. Passengers can now be cleared through the backup terminal located in Hangar 2 by Gate 5 as well as using the new main terminal facilities. Today In 2005, the runway was extended to 2,210 m at a cost of NZ$5 million, it is the third-longest civilian runway in New Zealand, capable of handling aircraft of Boeing 737/Airbus A320, and weight restricted Boeing 777-200/787-9 type sized aircraft. The airport has adopted a masterplan to cater for diversions. The terminal apron and gates can permanently sustain aircraft to the size of Airbus A321. Baggage container handling equipment and airstairs were installed in 2016 after the new single level passenger terminal was opened. Regular types using the airport now are the Airbus A320, ATR 72 and the Dash 8 Q-300. The apron parking gates were refurbished in 2019 with repositioned Gates 1 and 2 given concrete hardstands allowing aircraft up to the heavier Airbus A321 to park nose in to the terminal. Air New Zealand aircraft are pushed back with push-back tractors. Gates 3, 4 and 5 are still turn in, turn out marked.Invercargill Airport Ltdwebsite Runway resurfacing with a fresh top of asphalt over its older sections in 2011 has helped to increase weight limits for aircraft usage. =Commercial operators= Air New Zealand is the major carrier operating from the airport, operating Bombardier Q300 and ATR-72 types for flights to and from Christchurch and Wellington, Airbus A320 to and from Auckland. Air New Zealand has a small maintenance base for servicing as up to three aircraft are stabled overnight.Invercargill Airport Limited Stewart Island Flights operate inter-island services to Oban, the main settlement on Stewart Island up to three times per day. Also on demand for pre-booked groups. Mainland Air operate flights to and from Dunedin on behalf of the Southern District Health Board. This service is used to transfer medical staff on a daily basis and have seats when available for purchase by the general public via their web site. =International technical stopover= Invercargill is, since August 2019, designated a Fully Secured international airport. Before then it was classed as unsecured and required special clearances to operate occasional flights. Invercargill Airport has had aspirations from the 1980s through to the 2000s as an international destination with proposals that have failed to get off the ground with nearby Queenstown being developed as a more direct route for jet aircraft. Nonetheless, Invercargill is now used as a fill-up point for international services as well as designated weather diversion airport for flights to and from Queenstown thanks to its longer runway. A rudimentary standby international terminal facility is located in Hangar 2 but is seldom used. Since July 2012, Air New Zealand had used Invercargill as a technical stop when conditions in Queenstown restrict aircraft from taking off with sufficient fuel to fly directly to Australia due to inclement weather or operational reasons (e.g. high payload). In the past such flights have been routed through Christchurch, adding two hours to the journey, but by comparison going via Invercargill saves one hour. Passengers usually do not leave the aircraft when refuelling is taking place. Invercargill now has appropriate fully secured border control measures to service international flights for Chartered services or diverted flights if Queenstown airport closes due to adverse weather conditions. The airport's security services as well as Customs Officers from the nearby Port of Bluff provide official immigration clearance services. On 3 March 2013, Invercargill handled over 400 passengers on international flights that were diverted from Queenstown due to low cloud. =Minor military and Antarctic operations role= Although only ever a backup airport during the Second World War, military operations have remained rare due to Christchurch being chosen as the main Operation Deep Freeze Base in 1949 and what was then Dunedin's Taieri Aerodrome acting as a departure point for shorter range aircraft heading south. The occasional Antarctic flight did land at Invercargill if Taieri was closed. JATO power was needed to assist heavily laden aircraft off the ground. After the runway was lengthened and paved, larger aircraft such as the C-124 Globemaster, and C-121 Constellation used the airport for emergency and technical stopovers.Southern DC3 Oddisey, 1996  Christchurch Antarctic Centre  Southland Museum Today the airport is visited by aircraft of the United States ANG, Australian RAAF, Italy's Aeronautica Militare and RNZAF as part of Antarctic flight diversion training. The RNZAF has used the airfield area for their Wise Owl week-long exercises at least twice a decade. The largest aircraft to land at Invercargill is the Boeing C-17 Globemaster, although the runway has been \\"buzzed\\" by USAF KC-10 Extenders, Lockheed C-141 Starlifters and C-5 Galaxy for emergency diversion practise.Invercargill City Council/Library Archives  Airlines and destinations  Late afternoon, Invercargill Airport =Passenger= See also * List of airports in New Zealand * List of airlines of New Zealand * Transport in New Zealand * List of busiest airports in New Zealand References External links * Official site * Airports in New Zealand Transport in Southland, New Zealand Government-owned companies of New Zealand Airports established in 1938 1938 establishments in New Zealand Invercargill ","title":"Invercargill Airport"},{"id":"4349121","text":"Seleucia at the Zeugma (, transliterated Seleucia epi tou Zeugmatos or Seleukeia epi tou Zeugmatos) was a Hellenistic city or fortified town in the present Republic of Turkey, on the left, or south, bank of the Euphrates, across from ancient Samosata and not far from it. It is mentioned in isolated incidents: Antiochus III the Great married a Pontic princess there in 221 BC; the Oxford Classical Dictionary ascribed this to Zeugma. Tigranes let Cleopatra Selene, the widow of Antiochus X Eusebes, be killed there. Pompey gave the city and its surroundings to Antiochus I Theos of Commagene; Pliny the Elder nonetheless ascribes it to Coele Syria. The bishop Eusebius of Samosata ruled a day's journey from his see, even to Zeugma. The name of the city is confirmed by an inscription from Rhodes, which refers to a man \\"of Seleucia, of those on the Euphrates\\". The location of Selucia at the Zeugma is currently uncertain. It had a bridge of boats, like the well-known (and now submerged) city of Zeugma, in Osrohene further downstream; which is too far downstream, and on the wrong side of the river to be the boundary of Eusebius' see. By the same reasoning, it cannot be either of the places called el Qantara (\\"bridge\\") which were just above, and 2 km below, modern Samsat, Turkey, before its old site was also flooded, by the Atat√ºrk Dam. The Barrington Atlas conjectures that it was at Killik, ≈ûanlƒ±urfa Province, Turkey ), on the basis of T.A. Sinclair's Eastern Turkey : an architectural and archaeological survey, which is some 40 km downstream from Samosata, and below the dam. The reasoning here is unclear.

It was transferred in 1970 by the Archbishop of Vienna Franz Cardinal K√∂nig to the priests of the Opus Dei. The first church The oldest church building (of which nothing remains today) dates back to the Early Middle Ages, and there is speculation that it could be the oldest church in Vienna (See Ruprechtskirche). That Roman church was built on the site of a Roman encampment. View of the Graben with the mediaeval church (Jacob Hoefnagel, 1609) This church was replaced with a Romanesque church with a nave and two aisles. It is believed to have been established by Charlemagne around 800, although there is no evidence supporting this view. At the outside of the church, there is a relief sculpture by R. Weyr consecrated to the founding of the church by Charlemagne. In any case, a church of Saint Peter in Vienna is first mentioned in 1137. Around the end of the 12th century, the church became part of the Schottenstift. The mediaeval church had three altars, with an apse in the south instead of the normal eastern orientation. This unusual feature has triggered many discussions among experts, and it is suspected that the church was adapted from a previously secular building. The church was surrounded by shops, and a nearby building housed the Stadtguardia, a forerunner of the modern police. The old church burned down in 1661 and was given only makeshift repairs. The decision to build a new church was taken up with the arrival of the Fraternity of the Holy Trinity of which the emperor Leopold I was a member. He had taken a vow to rebuild this church when Vienna was ravaged by the plague in 1679-1680. The new building The construction of the new Baroque church was begun around 1701 under Gabriele Montani, who was replaced by Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt in 1703. The design was inspired by the St. Peter's Basilica of the Vatican in Rome. Francesco Martinelli was the main architect. By 1722, most of the building was finished, and in 1733 the Peterskirche was finally consecrated to the Holy Trinity. The new church was the first domed structure in baroque Vienna. Due to the confinement of available space, it was built in a very compact form, with its oval interior housing an astonishing amount of space and rectangular attachments. The church makes an overwhelming impression on the visitor with its surprisingly rich interior filled with golden stucco. View of the dome and altar The turreted dome was mainly designed by Matthias Steinl, who was also responsible for the interior decoration and the pews with their fabulous cherubic heads. The frescoes were originally painted by the famous Italian Andrea Pozzo, whose paintings were removed after his death. As a result, in 1713, Johann Michael Rottmayr was able to start a completely new set. The fresco in the cupola represents the Coronation of Our Lady. On the triumphal arch one can see the coat of arms of emperor Leopold I. In the spandrels around the dome are portrayals of the four Evangelists and four Fathers of the Church, painted by the Viennese artist J.G. Schmidt. The same artist also painted the altarpiece in the side chapel of St. Michael. The Baroque high altar was created by Antonio Galli Bibiena and his Bolognese workshop (construction) and Martino Altomonte (1657‚Äì1745) (altarpiece). The altarpiece portrays the Healing of the Lame by St. Peter and St. John in Jerusalem. The same artist also painted the altarpiece in the side chapel of the Holy Family. The small painting of the Immaculate Conception above the high altar is by the 19th century artist Kupelwieser. The shrines in the side chapels of the Holy Family and St. Michael contain martyrs from Roman catacombs, donated by Cardinal Kollonitz in 1733. They were clothed in this period and placed in the glass coffins. The gilded, ornate pulpit is a magnificent sculpture by Matthias Steinl (1726) with on top of the canopy a representation of the Holy Trinity. Opposite the pulpit there is a dramatic gold-and-silver representation of the Martyrdom of St. John of Nepomuk, sculpted by Lorenzo Mattielli. On top of it is the beautiful statue of The Mother of God. Over the years, the paintings had become darker, and the interior began to take on a grey appearance. From 1998 to 2004, the church underwent a renovation, which returned the paintings to their original rich colouring and brightness.  Access  The Peterskirche is located on Petersplatz, right next to Graben and just west of the Pests√§ule. The street Jungferngasse cuts through the pedestrian zone and leads directly to the church.

Similar in style to the preceding 1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?), the album is a fusion of hip hop, drum machines and samples of a diversity of musical works, although in general the samples are more covertly integrated here than they are in 1987. Background Early in 1987, Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty formed The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu and released their debut single, \\"All You Need Is Love\\". This was followed in June 1987 by their debut album, 1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?), an \\"energetic ... [and] loopy dance album\\" but with \\"too few ideas being spread too thin\\". In October 1987, The JAMs destroyed most remaining copies of the album following a copyright complaint from ABBA and the Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society. The JAMs released several other singles that year and made regular appearances in the British music press. In a December 1987 interview, Rockman Rock claimed that The JAMs' second album would be heavy metal... \\"We're gonna do heavy metal covers. We thought we'd do the whole of In Rock.\\" King Boy D continued: \\"Before we ever did the '1987' LP, we were gonna do one called 'The Justified Ancients Of Mu Mu In Rock' and do all Deep Purple songs.

Upon release, the album was interpreted by sections of the music press to be The JAMs' last album,Who Killed The JAMs? Review (February 1988), Melody Maker. and, excepting the compilation Shag Times, it was. Most subsequent releases by Drummond and Cauty would be under their new moniker, The KLF. Drummond: \\"After all the notoriety we seemed to get on the rock papers news pages over the last year (something we began to feel more and more uncomfortable with) we are going to attempt to keep a low profile in 1988.... [although] we might put out a couple of 12\\" records under the name The K.L.F..... As far as sampling is concerned, I'm sure we will continue doing it and from time to time get into trouble because of it, but it has always been only a part of the process of how we put our records together and not the reason for them existing. We will carry on doing what we want to do, when we want to do it, our motivation, everything we see and hear.\\" Reception Melody Maker declared Who Killed The JAMs to be \\"divine nihilism\\", \\"an outward show of self-deception, irrationality and bankruptcy that worries and rejoices itself to death\\". Sounds thought the album \\"a masterpiece of pathos\\", referring to \\"hopeless bravado in the face of massed corporate opposition\\", and awarded the maximum five stars. Track listing The track listing was not actually printed on the album sleeve because, according to Drummond, \\"to get the record out as fast as possible after we had finished recording it, we had to deliver the art work to the printers before Christmas at which time we didn't know what the tracks were to be called.\\" =Side one= #\\"The Candystore\\" ‚Äì 3:07 #\\"The Candyman\\" ‚Äì 3:29 #\\"Disaster Fund Collection\\" ‚Äì 5:38 #\\"King Boy's Dream\\" ‚Äì 0:58 =Side two= #\\"The Porpoise Song\\" ‚Äì 5:43 #\\"Prestwich Prophet's Grin\\" ‚Äì 5:01 #\\"Burn the Bastards\\" ‚Äì 5:58 References Notes * The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu albums KLF Communications albums 1988 albums Hip hop albums by British artists House music albums by British artists Albums produced by The KLF ","title":"Who Killed The JAMs?"},{"id":"4349209","text":"The West Trenton Railroad Bridge is a concrete arch bridge carrying CSX's Trenton Subdivision and SEPTA's West Trenton Line across the Delaware River between Lower Makefield Township in Bucks County, Pennsylvania and the West Trenton section of Ewing Township in Mercer County, New Jersey.

It primarily features jazz and blues music programming aimed toward African-American residents of the northern counties of Alabama and several counties in southern middle Tennessee. WJAB's signal travels in about a 120-mile radius. The station is licensed to Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University (known as \\"Alabama A&M;\\" for short) in Normal, Alabama, which is actually located within the city of Huntsville. The Telecommunications Center of the University operates the station partly as a laboratory for student announcers, producers, and journalists. History Beginning in the late 1970s, Alabama A&M; made numerous attempts to obtain funding from the state of Alabama and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting in order to establish a radio station of its own. The FCC originally allocated the callsign WAED for the station. The call sign was previously owned by The Big JAB, an AM station in Westbrook, Maine. The Telecommunications Center under the direction of the late Dr. Hayward O. Handy and Elizabeth Sloan- Ragland was best known during the 1970s and 1980s for producing several weekly public affairs and features shows seen on Alabama Public Television, including Montage and Upstate. The Center also produced The Alabama A&M; Football Review with announcer Ike Rooks, which aired on Huntsville-area commercial television stations. After years of bureaucratic wrangling and waiting for governments to afford the needed appropriations, AAMU realized its goal in 1991. Since that time, the station has consistently placed the concerns of its listeners in very high regard with programming such as interview shows, music of all varieties throughout the Pan-African world, and live broadcasts of AAMU football and men's basketball games. The station was assigned the WJAB call letters by the Federal Communications Commission on January 23, 1990.

The venture, financed by John Quiller Rowett, is sometimes referred to as the Quest Expedition after its ship Quest, a converted Norwegian sealer. Shackleton had originally intended to go to the Arctic and explore the Beaufort Sea, but this plan was abandoned when the Canadian government withheld financial support; Shackleton thereupon switched his attention to the Antarctic. Quest, smaller than any recent Antarctic exploration vessel, soon proved inadequate for its task, and progress south was delayed by its poor sailing performance and by frequent engine problems. Before the expedition's work could properly begin, Shackleton died on board the ship, just after its arrival at the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia. The major part of the subsequent attenuated expedition was a three-month cruise to the eastern Antarctic, under the leadership of the party's second-in-command, Frank Wild. The shortcomings of Quest were soon in evidence: slow speed, heavy fuel consumption, a tendency to roll in heavy seas, and a steady leak. The ship was unable to proceed further than longitude 20¬∞E, well short of its easterly target, and its engine's low power coupled with its unsuitable bows was insufficient for it to penetrate southward through the pack ice. Following several fruitless attempts, Wild returned the ship to South Georgia, on the way visiting Elephant Island where he and 21 others had been stranded after the sinking of the ship Endurance, during Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition six years earlier. Wild had thoughts of a second, more productive season in the ice, and took the ship to Cape Town for a refit. Here, in June 1922, he received a message from Rowett ordering the ship home to England, so the expedition ended quietly. The Quest voyage is not greatly regarded in the histories of polar exploration, due to the event that defines it in public memory, overshadowing its other activities: Shackleton's untimely death. Background =Shackleton after the Endurance= Shackleton returned to Britain from the Endurance expedition in late May 1917, while World War I was under way. Many of his men enlisted promptly upon their return. Too old to enlist, Shackleton nevertheless sought an active role in the war effort,Huntford, p. 649 and eventually departed for Murmansk with the temporary army rank of major, as part of a military mission to North Russia. Shackleton expressed his dissatisfaction with this role in letters home: \\"I feel I am no use to anyone unless I am outfacing the storm in wild lands.\\"Fisher, p. 435 He returned to England in February 1919 and began plans to set up a company that would, with the cooperation of the North Russian Government, develop the natural resources of the region.Fisher, p. 437 This scheme came to nothing, as the Red Army took control of that part of Russia during the Russian Civil War; to provide himself with an income, Shackleton had to rely on the lecture circuit. During the winter of 1919‚Äì20 he lectured twice a day, six days a week, for five months.Fisher, p. 441 = Canadian proposal = Dense pack ice in the Beaufort Sea Despite the large debts still outstanding from the Endurance expedition, Shackleton's mind turned towards another exploration venture. He decided to turn away from the Antarctic, go northwards and, as he put it, \\"fill in this great blank now called the Beaufort Sea\\".Fisher, pp. 442‚Äì445. This area of the Arctic Ocean, to the north of Alaska and west of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, was largely unexplored; Shackleton believed, on the basis of tidal records, that it contained large undiscovered land masses that \\"would be of the greatest scientific interest to the world, apart from the possible economic value\\". Shackleton also hoped to reach the northern pole of inaccessibility, the most remote point in the Arctic regions.Wild, p. 2. In March 1920, his plans received the general approval of the Royal Geographical Society and were supported by the Canadian government. On this basis Shackleton set about acquiring the necessary funding, which he estimated at ¬£50,000.Over ¬£2 million at 2016 values. Later that year, Shackleton met by chance an old school- friend, John Quiller Rowett, who agreed to put up a nucleus of cash to get Shackleton started. With this money, in January 1921, Shackleton purchased the wooden Norwegian whaler Foca I together with other equipment, and began the process of hiring of a crew. In May 1921, the policy of the Canadian government towards Arctic expeditions changed with the advent of a new prime minister, Arthur Meighen, who withdrew support from Shackleton's proposal.Huntford, pp. 680‚Äì682. Shackleton was required to rethink his plans, and decided to sail for the Antarctic instead. A varied programme of exploration, coastal mapping, mineral prospecting and oceanographic research in the Southern Ocean would replace the abandoned Beaufort Sea venture. Antarctic preparation =Objectives= Sir Ernest Shackleton, the expedition's leader Even before his problems with the Canadian government, Shackleton had been considering a southern expedition as a possible alternative to the Beaufort Sea. According to the RGS librarian Hugh Robert Mill, as early as March 1920 Shackleton had talked about two possible schemes‚Äîthe Beaufort Sea exploration, and \\"an oceanographical expedition with the object of visiting all the little-known islands of the South Atlantic and South Pacific\\".Mills, p. 287 By June 1921, the latter plan had expanded to include a circumnavigation of the Antarctic continent and the mapping of around 2,000 miles (3,200 km) of uncharted coastline. It would also encompass a search for \\"lost\\" or wrongly charted sub-Antarctic islands (including Dougherty Island, Tuanaki, and the Nimrod Islands),Harrington, p. 1 and would investigate possible mineral resources to be exploited in these rediscovered lands. A scientific research program would include a visit to Gough Island, and an investigation of a possible \\"underwater continental connection between Africa and America.\\" Shackleton's biographer Margery Fisher calls the plan \\"diffuse\\", and \\"far too comprehensive for one small body of men to tackle within two years\\",Fisher, pp. 446‚Äì49 while according to Roland Huntford, the expedition had no obvious goal and was \\"only too clearly a piece of improvisation, a pretext [for Shackleton] to get away\\". Fisher describes the expedition as representing \\"the dividing line between what has become known as the Heroic Age of Antarctic exploration and the Mechanical Age\\". Shackleton called the voyage \\"pioneering\\", referring specifically to the aeroplane that was taken (but ultimately not used) on the expedition. In fact this was only one of the technological \\"firsts\\" that marked the venture; there were gadgets in profusion. The ship's crow's nest was electrically heated; there were heated overalls for the lookouts, a wireless set, and a device called an odograph which could trace and chart the ship's route automatically. Photography was to figure prominently, and \\"a large and expensive outfit of cameras, cinematographical machines and general photographic appliances [was] acquired\\".Frank Wild, quoted in Leif Mills, p. 289 Among the oceanographical research equipment was a Lucas deep-sea sounding machine.Wild, p. 13 This ample provision arose from the sponsorship of Rowett, who had extended his original gift of seed money to an undertaking to cover the costs of the entire expedition.Mills, pp. 287‚Äì88 The extent of Rowett's contribution is not recorded; in an (undated) prospectus for the southern expedition Shackleton had estimated the total cost as \\"about ¬£100,000\\". Whatever the total, Rowett appears to have funded the lion's share, enabling Frank Wild to record later that, unique among Antarctic expeditions of the era, this one returned home without any outstanding debt.Wild (Preface)Huntford (p. 693) records that Rowett estimated that the expedition had cost him ¬£70,000 According to Wild, without Rowett's actions the expedition would have been impossible: \\"His generous attitude is the more remarkable in that he knew there was no prospect of financial return, and what he did was in the interest of scientific research and from friendship with Shackleton.\\" His only recognition was the attachment of his name to the title of the expedition. Rowett was, according to Huntford, \\"a stodgy, prosaic looking\\" businessman,Huntford, p. 682 who was, in 1920, a co-founder and principal contributor to an animal nutrition research institute in Aberdeen known as the Rowett Research Institute (now part of the University of Aberdeen). He had also endowed dental research work at the Middlesex Hospital. =Quest= Quest passing through Tower Bridge, London In March 1921, Shackleton renamed his expedition vessel Quest.Huntford, pp. 684‚Äì85 She was a small ship, 125 tons according to Huntford, with sail and auxiliary engine power purportedly capable of making eight knots, but in fact rarely making more than five-and-a-half.Fisher, pp. 459‚Äì61Eight knots = 9.2 miles per hour, 14.8 km/h. 5¬Ω knots = 6.3 mph, 10.2 mph Huntford describes her as \\"straight-stemmed\\", with an awkward square rig, and a tendency to wallow in heavy seas. Fisher reports that she was built in 1917, weighed 204 tons, and had a large and spacious deck.The difference in the figures provided by Huntford and Fisher may represent the distinction between tonnage, a measure of volume, and displacement, a measure of weight. Although she had some modern facilities, such as electric lights in the cabins,Huntford (The Shackleton Voyages), p. 259 she was unsuited to long oceanic voyages; Shackleton, on the first day out, observed that \\"in no way are we shipshape or fitted to ignore even the mildest storm\\".Mills, pp. 287‚Äì90 Leif Mills, in his biography of Frank Wild, says that had the ship been taken to the Beaufort Sea in accordance with Shackleton's original plans, she would probably have been crushed in the Arctic pack ice. On her voyage south she suffered frequent damage and breakdowns, requiring repairs at every port of call. = Personnel = The Times had reported that Shackleton planned to take a dozen men to the Arctic, \\"chiefly those who had accompanied him on earlier expeditions\\". In fact, Quest left London for the south with 20 men, of whom eight were old Endurance comrades; another, James Dell, was a veteran from the Discovery, 20 years previously.Fisher, p. 464. Some of the Endurance hands had not been fully paid from the earlier expedition, but were prepared to join Shackleton again out of personal loyalty. Another Shackleton loyalist, Ernest Joyce, had fallen out with Shackleton over the money he claimed was owed to him, and was not invited to join the expedition.Tyler-Lewis, pp. 256‚Äì257. Frank Wild, on his fourth trip with Shackleton, filled the second-in-command post as he had on the Endurance expedition. Frank Worsley, Endurances former captain, became captain of Quest. Other old comrades included surgeons Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy, meteorologist Leonard Hussey, engineer Alexander Kerr, seaman Tom McLeod and cook Charles Green. Shackleton had assumed that Tom Crean would sign up, and had assigned him duties \\"in charge of boats\\", but Crean had retired from the navy to start a family back home in County Kerry, and declined Shackleton's invitation.Smith, p. 308. Frank Wild Of the newcomers, Roderick Carr, a New Zealand-born Royal Air Force pilot, was hired to fly the expedition's aeroplane, an Avro Baby modified as a seaplane with an 80-horsepower engine.Riffenburgh, p. 892.Verdon-Roe, p. 258. He had met Shackleton in north Russia, and had recently been serving as chief of staff to the Lithuanian Air Force. Due to some missing parts, the aeroplane was not used during the expedition and Carr assisted with the general scientific work.Fisher, pp. 451‚Äì453. Scientific staff included Australian biologist Hubert Wilkins, who had Arctic experience, and Canadian geologist Vibert Douglas, who had initially signed for the aborted Beaufort Sea expedition. The recruits who caught the most public attention were two members of The Boy Scouts Association, Norman Mooney and James Marr. As the result of publicity organised by the Daily Mail newspaper, these two had been selected to join the expedition out of around 1,700 Scouts who had applied to go.Fisher, p. 454. Mooney, who was from the Orkney Islands, dropped out during the voyage south, leaving the ship at Madeira after suffering chronic seasickness.Wild, p. 32. Marr, an 18-year-old from Aberdeen, remained throughout, winning plaudits from Shackleton and Wild for his application to the tasks at hand. After being put to work in the ship's coal bunkers, according to Wild, Marr \\"came out of the trial very well, showing an amount of hardihood and endurance that was remarkable\\". Expedition =Voyage south= South Georgia, the expedition's first sub-Antarctic port of call. Grytviken Harbour is indicated on the northern shore. Quest sailed from St Katharine Docks, London, on 17 September 1921, after inspection by King George V.Huntford, p. 683 Large crowds gathered on the banks of the river and on the bridges, to witness the event. Marr wrote in his diary that it was as though \\"all London had conspired together to bid us a heartening farewell\\". Shackleton's original intention was to sail down to Cape Town, visiting the main South Atlantic islands on the way. From Cape Town, Quest would head for the Enderby Land coast of Antarctica where, once in the ice, it would explore the coastline towards Coats Land in the Weddell Sea. At the end of the summer season the ship would visit South Georgia before returning to Cape Town for refitting and preparation for the second year's work. The ship's performance in the early stages of the voyage disrupted this schedule. Serious problems with the engine necessitated a week's stay in Lisbon, and further stops in Madeira and the Cape Verde Islands.Mills, pp. 292‚Äì93 These delays and the slow speed of the ship led Shackleton to decide that it would be necessary to sacrifice entirely the visits to the South Atlantic islands, and instead he turned the ship towards Rio de Janeiro, where the engine could receive a thorough overhaul. Quest reached Rio on 22 November 1921. The engine overhaul, and the replacement of a damaged topmast,Wild, p. 44 delayed the party in Rio for four weeks. This meant that it was no longer practical to proceed to Cape Town and then on to the ice. Shackleton decided to sail directly to Grytviken harbour in South Georgia.Fisher, pp. 466‚Äì67 Equipment and stores that had been sent on to Cape Town would have to be sacrificed, but Shackleton hoped that this shortfall could be made up in South Georgia. He was vague about the direction the expedition should take after South Georgia; Macklin wrote in his diary, \\"The Boss says...quite frankly that he does not know what he will do.\\"Fisher, pp. 471‚Äì73Huntford, p. 688 = Death of Shackleton = Shackleton's grave On 17 December 1921, the day before Quest was due to leave Rio, Shackleton fell ill. He may have suffered a heart attack;Huntford, p. 687. Macklin was called, but Shackleton refused to be examined and declared himself \\"better\\" the next morning.Mills, p. 294, On the ensuing voyage to South Georgia he was, from the accounts of his shipmates, unusually subdued and listless. He also began drinking champagne each morning, \\"to deaden the pain\\", contrary to his normal rule of not allowing liquor at sea. A severe storm ruined the expedition's proposed Christmas celebrations, and a new problem with the engine's steam furnace slowed progress and caused Shackleton further stress.Fisher, pp. 473‚Äì476. By 1 January 1922, the weather had abated: \\"Rest and calm after the storm ‚Äì the year has begun kindly for us\\", wrote Shackleton in his diary. On 4 January, South Georgia was sighted, and late that morning Quest anchored at Grytviken. After visiting the whaling establishment ashore, Shackleton returned to the ship apparently refreshed. He told Frank Wild that they would celebrate their deferred Christmas the next day, and retired to his cabin to write his diary.Fisher, pp. 476‚Äì477. \\"The old smell of dead whale permeates everything\\", he wrote. \\"It is a strange and curious place ... A wonderful evening. In the darkening twilight I saw a lone star hover, gem like above the bay.\\" Later he slept and was heard snoring by the surgeon McIlroy, who had just finished his watch-keeping duty. Shortly after 02:00 on the morning of 5 January, Macklin, who had taken over the watch, was summoned to Shackleton's cabin. He found Shackleton complaining of back pains and severe facial neuralgia, and asking for a painkilling drug. In a brief discussion, Macklin told his leader that he had been overdoing things, and needed to lead a more regular life. Macklin records Shackleton as saying: \\"You're always wanting me to give up things, what is it I ought to give up?\\" Macklin replied, \\"Chiefly alcohol, Boss, I don't think it agrees with you.\\" Immediately afterwards Shackleton \\"had a very severe paroxysm, during which he died\\".Macklin diary, quoted by Fisher, p. 477.Huntford, p. 690. The death certificate, signed by Macklin, gave the cause as \\"Atheroma of the Coronary arteries and Heart failure\\"‚Äîin modern terms, coronary thrombosis. Later that morning, Wild, now in command, gave the news to the shocked crew, and told them that the expedition would carry on.Wild, p. 66. The body was brought ashore for embalming before its return to England. On 19 January, Leonard Hussey accompanied the body on board a steamer bound for Montevideo, but on arrival there he found a message from Emily Shackleton, requesting that the body be returned to South Georgia for burial. Hussey brought the body back to Grytviken,Fisher, pp. 478‚Äì481. where Shackleton was buried on 5 March in the Norwegian cemetery. Quest had meantime sailed, so only Hussey of Shackleton's former comrades was present at the interment.Wild, p. 69. A rough cross marked the burial site, until it was replaced by a tall granite column six years later.Fisher, pp. 480‚Äì481. = Voyage to the ice = Quests route from 3 to 24 February 1922 shows their repeated attempts to penetrate the pack iceBased on Wild, pp. 98‚Äì137. As leader, Wild had to arrange where the expedition should now go. Kerr reported that a longstanding problem with the ship's furnace was manageable and, after supplementing stores and equipment, Wild decided to proceed generally in accordance with Shackleton's original intentions. He would take the ship eastward towards Bouvet Island and then beyond, before turning south to enter the ice as close as possible to Enderby Land, and begin coastal survey work there. The expedition would also investigate an appearance of land in the mouth of the Weddell Sea, reported by James Clark Ross in 1842, but not seen since. Ultimately, progress would depend on weather, ice conditions, and the capabilities of the ship.Wild, pp. 73‚Äì75, 78‚Äì79. Quest left South Georgia on 18 January, heading south-east towards the South Sandwich Islands. There was a heavy swell, such that the overladen ship frequently dipped its gunwales below the waves, filling the waist with water.Wild, pp. 82‚Äì87. As they proceeded, Wild wrote that Quest rolled like a log, leaked and required regular pumping, was heavy on coal consumption, and was slow. All these factors led him to change his plan at the end of January. Bouvet Island was abandoned in favour of a more southerly course that brought them to the edge of the pack ice on 4 February.Wild, pp. 88‚Äì91, 98. \\"Now the little Quest can really try her mettle\\", wrote Wild, as the ship entered the loose pack.Wild, pp. 98‚Äì99. He noted that Quest was the smallest ship ever to attempt to penetrate the heavy Antarctic ice, and pondered on the fate of others. \\"Shall we escape, or will the Quest join the ships in Davy Jones's Locker?\\" During the days that followed, as they moved southward in falling temperatures, the ice thickened. On 12 February, they reached the most southerly latitude they would attain, 69¬∞17'S, and their most easterly longitude, 17¬∞9'E, well short of Enderby Land. Noting the state of the sea ice and fearing being frozen in, Wild retreated to the north and west.Wild, pp. 115‚Äì121. He still hoped to tackle the heavy ice, and if possible, break through to the hidden land beyond. On 18 February, he turned the ship south again for another try, but was no more successful than before.Wild, p. 132. On 24 February, after a series of further efforts had failed, Wild set a course westward across the mouth of the Weddell Sea towards Elephant Island, where Wild and 21 others had been stranded during Shackleton's Imperial Trans- Antarctic Expedition six years earlier. They would then return to South Georgia before the onset of winter.Wild, p. 136. For the most part, the long passage across the Weddell Sea proceeded uneventfully. There was a growing level of unrest among the crew, perhaps provoked by disappointment with the apparent aimlessness of the voyage; Worsley in particular was critical of Wild's leadership.Mills, pp. 302‚Äì303. Wild, in his own account, dealt with this discontent by the threat of \\"the most drastic treatment\\".Wild, pp. 137‚Äì139. On 12 March, they reached 64¬∞11'S, 46¬∞4'W, which was the area where Ross had recorded an appearance of land in 1842, but there was no sign of it, and a depth sounding of over indicated no likelihood of land nearby.Wild, p. 144. From 15 to 21 March, Quest was frozen into the ice, and the shortage of coal became a major concern. Wild hoped that the diminished fuel supply could be supplemented by blubber from the seals at Elephant Island.Mills, p. 304. On 25 March, the island was sighted. Wild wanted if possible to revisit Cape Wild, the site of the old Endurance expedition camp, but bad weather prevented this. They viewed the site through binoculars, picking out the old landmarks, before landing on the western coast to hunt for elephant seals.Mills, p. 305. They were able to obtain sufficient blubber to mix with the coal so that, aided by a favourable wind, they reached South Georgia on 6 April. = Return = Tristan da Cunha, Inaccessible Island, and Gough Island Quest remained in South Georgia for a month, during which time Shackleton's old comrades erected a memorial cairn to their former leader, on a headland overlooking the entrance to Grytviken harbour.Fisher, pp. 482‚Äì483. On 8 May 1922, Quest sailed for Cape Town, where Wild hoped to arrange a refit in preparation for a more productive second season in the ice. The first port of call was Tristan da Cunha, a remote inhabited island to the west and south of Cape Town. After a rough crossing of the \\"Roaring Forties\\", Quest arrived there on 20 May. Following orders from Robert Baden-Powell, Marr presented a flag to the local Scout Troop. During the five-day stay, with the help of some of the islanders, the expedition made brief landings on the small Inaccessible Island, south- west of Tristan, and visited the even smaller Nightingale Island, collecting specimens.Wild, pp. 206‚Äì214. Wild's impressions of the stay at Tristan were not altogether favourable. He noted the appalling squalor and poverty, and said of the population: \\"They are ignorant, shut off almost completely from the world, horribly limited in outlook.\\"Wild, p. 207. After the Scout parade and flag presentation, Quest sailed on to Gough Island, to the east,Wild, p. 232. where members of the expedition took geological and botanical samples.Mills, pp. 306‚Äì308. They arrived at Cape Town on 18 June, to be greeted by enthusiastic crowds. South African Prime Minister Jan Smuts gave an official reception, and they were honoured at dinners and lunches by local organisations. They were also met by Rowett's agent, with the message that they should return to England.Fisher, p. 483 Wild wrote: \\"I should have liked one more season in the Enderby Quadrant ... much might be accomplished by making Cape Town our starting point and setting out early in the season.\\"Wild, p. 287. On 19 July, they left Cape Town and sailed north. Their final visits were to Saint Helena, Ascension Island and S√£o Vicente. On 16 September, one year after departure, they arrived at Plymouth harbour.  Aftermath  = Assessment = Quests interior According to Wild, the expedition ended quietly, although his biographer Leif Mills writes of enthusiastic crowds in Plymouth Sound.Wild, pp. 312‚Äì313.Mills, p. 308. At the end of his account, Wild expressed the hope that the information they had brought back might \\"prove of value in helping to solve the great natural problems that still beset us\\". These results were summarised in five brief appendices to Wild's book.Wild, pp. 321‚Äì349. The summaries reflected the efforts of the scientific staff to collect data and specimens at each port of call,Mills, p. 307. and the geological and survey work carried out by Carr and Douglas on South Georgia, before the southern voyage.Wild, p. 80. Eventually a few scientific papers and articles were developed from this material,Fisher, pp. 516‚Äì517. but it was, in Leif Mills's words, \\"little enough to show for a year's work\\". The lack of a clear, defined expedition objectiveHuntford, p. 464.Mills, p. 330. was aggravated by the failure to call at Cape Town on the way south, which meant that important equipment was not picked up. On South Georgia, Wild found little that could make up for this loss ‚Äì there were no dogs on the island, so no sledging work could be carried out, which eliminated Wild's preferred choice of a revised expedition goal, an exploration of Graham Land on the Antarctic Peninsula.Wild, pp. 74‚Äì75. The death of Shackleton before the beginning of serious work was a heavy blow, and questions were raised about the adequacy of Wild as his replacement. Some reports imply that Wild drank heavily ‚Äì \\"practically an alcoholic\\", according to Huntford.Huntford, p. 693.Mills, p. 297. Mills suggests that even if Shackleton had lived to complete the expedition, it is arguable whether under the circumstances it could have achieved more than it did under Wild's command. The non-use of the aeroplane was a disappointment; Shackleton had hoped to pioneer the use of air transport in Antarctic waters, and had discussed this issue with the British Air Ministry.Fisher, pp. 447‚Äì448. According to Fisher's account, essential aeroplane parts had been sent on to Cape Town, but remained uncollected.Fisher, p. 452. The long-range, 220-volt wireless equipment did not work properly, and was abandoned early on. The smaller, 110-volt equipment worked only within a range of . During the Tristan visit, Wild attempted to install a new wireless apparatus with the help of a local missionary, but this was also unsuccessful.Wild, p. 214. = End of an era = An Antarctic hiatus followed the return of Quest, with no significant expeditions to the region for seven years. The expeditions that then followed were of a different character from their predecessors, belonging to the \\"mechanical age\\" that succeeded the Heroic Age.Fisher, p. 449. At the end of his narrative of the Quest expedition, Wild wrote of the Antarctic: \\"I think that my work there is done\\"; he never returned, closing a career which, like Shackleton's, had bracketed the entire Heroic Age.Wild, p. 313. In 1923, he emigrated to the Union of South Africa, where, after a series of business failures and dogged by ill health, he was employed in a succession of low-paid jobs.Mills, pp. 314‚Äì317. In March 1939, British authorities awarded him an annual pension of ¬£170; Wild commented: \\"I don't want to grumble, but I think it might have been made big enough for the poor old hero and his wife to live on\\".Mills, p. 318.The pension equates to approximately ¬£9,500 in 2016. Wild died on 19 August 1939, aged 66. The cause of death recorded was pneumonia and diabetes mellitus.Mills. p. 319. None of the other Endurance veterans returned to the Antarctic, although Worsley made one voyage to the Arctic in 1925.Fisher, p. 494. Of the other crew and staff of Quest, Australian naturalist Hubert Wilkins became a pioneer aviator in both the Arctic and Antarctic, and flew from Point Barrow, Alaska, to Spitsbergen in 1928. He also made several unsuccessful attempts during the 1930s, in collaboration with American adventurer Lincoln Ellsworth, to fly to the South Pole. James Marr also became an Antarctic regular after qualifying as a marine biologist, and joined several Australian expeditions in the late 1920s and 1930s.Fisher, p. 492. Roderick Carr became an Air Marshal in the Royal Air Force and deputy chief of staff to the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force in 1945.Fisher, p. 489.

It is similar in reserve layout to Odd and Even but with different game play. Rules First, one king and one ace are removed from the deck and placed in two columns: one with all aces and the other with all kings. In between these two columns is a space for the reserve, which is composed of nine cards arranged in three rows of three cards each. Ace and King columns are the foundations. The ace foundations are built up to Kings while the king foundations are built down to aces, all by suit. When the top cards of the ace and king foundations of the same suit are in sequence, a reversal can be done, i.e. cards can be moved one at a time from one foundation to the other, except the base aces and kings. The nine reserve cards are available for play on the foundations (not on each other). When a card leaves the reserve, the space it leaves behind is filled with the top card of the waste pile (or the stock if there is no waste pile yet). If play comes to a standstill in the reserve, the stock is dealt one card at a time, and if a card is unplayable, it is placed on the waste pile, the top card of which is available for building on the foundations or filling a space on the reserve. Only one redeal is allowed; to do this the unused cards in the waste pile is picked up and turned face down to be used as the new stock. The game is won when all cards end up in the foundations. Variations Picture Patience is a solitaire game which is played exactly like Patriarchs except for the following: *At the onset, no card is placed in the foundations; aces and kings needed are mixed in the deck. *Reversals are not allowed. Odd and Even involves building by 2s, but is in essence much the same game as Patriarchs. Both Odd and Even and Patriarchs are closely related to Royal Cotillion, which has very similar game-play but has a reserve of sixteen cards. This in turn is closely related to Contradance (Cotillion) and the single-deck game Captured Queens (Quadrille), both of which have no reserve and are entirely luck-based.

Founded as a small magazine on newsprint in 1977 by publisher Alan Leveritt, it later became a glossy monthly magazine with paid circulation, and in May 1992 became a weekly tabloid-format publication on newsprint with free distribution. As of 2019, the Times is once again a glossy monthly magazine. Its current format stems from reaction to the Arkansas Democrat buyout of assets from Gannett's closure of the Arkansas Gazette in 1991, which had resulted in the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. The Arkansas Timess senior editor Max Brantley is among those former Gazette staffers who lost their jobs as a result of the merger. Brantley was the first editor of the weekly edition in May 1992. The Gazette's editorial cartoonist George Fisher became the Times cartoonist until his death. Billed on its nameplate as Arkansas's weekly newspaper of politics and culture (similarly styled as other regional publications like The Memphis Flyer), Arkansas Times is noted for its opinion columnists and feature articles that take a decidedly liberal stance in comparison to the larger, daily Democrat-Gazette. Over the years since its founding, the publication's parent company ‚Äî Arkansas Times Limited Partnership ‚Äî has gone on to produce a number of special inserts and associated publications. Among these are the weekly El Latino, a Spanish- language weekly. The company also publishes Savvy Kids, a family magazine; the quarterly Arkansas Wild about outdoor pursuits and Arkansas Food and Farm, a periodical that reports on small farm agriculture and locally sourced foods. Annually, the first Times issue of the new year is the 'Native's Guide to Pulaski County' ‚Äî a comprehensive guide to communities and services in Little Rock and throughout Arkansas's most populous county. The Times was an early innovator in Arkansas as a source of online news. Its Arkansas Blog began as a source of breaking news and analysis about Arkansas in October 2004. It records some 300,000 unique visitors monthly and also attracts readers through Facebook and Twitter posts. Unlimited access to the Arkansas Blog in 2013 became a subscription offering. Lindsey Millar became editor of the Times in 2011. He introduced a number of digital features, including a weekly public affairs podcast and a daily video headline program. He has expanded the newspaper's reporting reach by privately underwritten reporting projects on a major oil pipeline spill and an ongoing project on education in Arkansas. In 2018, the Times refused to sign a pledge not to boycott Israel as required by the State's anti-BDS law, Act 710. Consequently one of its advertisers, University of Arkansas ‚Äì Pulaski Technical College, refused to renew its contract with the magazine. The Times in response sued the State in a case known as Arkansas Times LP v. Mark Waldrip claiming that its First Amendment rights had been violated. The case which is at the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is seen as principally important as it could set a precedent for the application of other anti-BDS laws. Logo The icon used at the close of most articles and columns throughout the publication is the stylized face of a catfish. A larger version appears with a top hat and monocle at the top of the \\"Observer\\" column, typically found on Page 5 each week. The catfish is also seen in the newspaper's sign outside its building at Markham and Scott Streets in downtown Little Rock.

Guyferd borrows aspects from Bio Booster Armor Guyver and Fist of the North Star. Plot After the mysterious disappearance of his older brother Masato, Gou Kazama returned to Japan from his travels, determined to find him. He soon discovered that Masato had been abducted by the Criminal Global Syndicate ‚ÄúCrown‚Äù, who had hopes to create the ‚Äòultimate fighter‚Äô, kidnapping the world‚Äôs strongest and most skilled martial artists to use in their inhuman experiments. Gou was eventually abducted by Crown and modified into a Guyborg, and during an escape he became a new entity via unknown means known as Guyferd.

Gou's transformation into Guyferd is the result of being converted into a Guyborg by Crown, no one aware at the time that Gou ended up in a symbiosis with a Fallah during his travels in Peru prior to the series. This results in Gou possessing the body of a Guyborg with the parasitic Fallah empowering him, Crown attempting to capture him before learning to replicate his physiology in their Metalferds. While he intended to find his brother, Gou resolves to fight Crown to stop their agenda. As the Ken'nou-ryu style utilizes the five elemental ‚Äúenergies‚Äù (Fire, Water, Earth, Nature and Metal) and the two ethereal energies (Air and Star) which he uses to draw strength for his transformation, Guyferd uses seven unique attacks known as the . **: Utilizing Star energy, Guyferd can deliver this powerful move as his final attack. **: Utilizing Fire energy, Guyferd rapidly punches his opponent before using a smashing blow with his right fist. **: Utilizing Earth energy, Guyferd deliver a crushing kick upside the head at blinding speed. **: Utilizing Natural energy, Guyferd repeatedly execute a drop kick attack on his opponent. **: Utilizing Metal energy, Guyferd uses the air currents to deliver a flying drop kick against his opponents. **: Utilizing Water energy, Guyferd uses a drop kick to severely wound an opponent. **: Utilizing Aerial energy, Guyferd delivers a destructive ‚Äòcross‚Äô karate chop attack. **: Used in the final episode of the series.

It is operated by the Icelandic Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is primarily designated for peacekeeping operations and was established in the 1990s to participate in operations and peacekeeping projects, including in support of NATO peacekeeping operations. That role later evolved into providing an appropriate forum for deploying personnel within other organizations such as with OSCE field missions as well as with UN DPKO, and organizations such as UNIFEM, UNRWA and UNICEF. The ICRU personnel has been deployed to the former territories of Yugoslavia, Kosovo and Afghanistan through NATO missions and UNIFEM and to the Middle East and North Africa with UNICEF, UNRWA and UNHCR. It had a civilian observer mission in Sri Lanka in co-operation with Norway (previously a Nordic mission) and has explosive ordnance disposal personnel from the Icelandic Coast Guard to Lebanon and Iraq. Iceland deployed its first peacekeepers in 1950, when two Icelandic police officers were sent to Palestine as a part of an UN peacekeeping operation. Though many Icelandic specialists have taken part in various peacekeeping operations since, mostly within the UN and its organizations but also within NATO, it was not until the 1990s that organized participation in peacekeeping operations was initiated, formalized with the establishment of the ICRU in 2001. In 2008, a portion of uniformed ICRU deployed personnel still armed for self-defense returned their weapons and changed to civilian clothing. The policy since 2008, is that, unless under special circumstances, ICRU personnel do not wear uniforms or carry weapons. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Iceland oversees the roster and deployment of personnel, Personnel The deployed personnel of the ICRU were experts, including Icelandic policemen, Coast Guardsmen and others that had relative training for the concerned institutions. in addition to those mentioned above, these backgrounds range from logistical backgrounds, medical or engineering backgrounds, social sciences and so on. But now, after a law was passed in 2007 the \\"peacekeepers\\" need a college degree. In 2014, it's much more of an aid squad rather than peacekeepers. The previously deployed doctors, nurses, those deployed as Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRT) as well as those working at Kabul International Airport (KAIA) were trained by the Norwegian Defence Force (previously the United Kingdom Armed Forces as well) as they were expected to merge into a military environment and the PRT's as well as those working at Kabul airport would be armed. Interview with Erlingur Erlingsson, ICRU on amongst other PRT withdrawal The ICRU roster members receive training and exercise in line with their deployment, but no military training from 2009. The legal basis for the ICRU is set in Icelandic law on ICRU, No. 73/2007 Operations The ICRU classifies its operations in the following manner: * Peacekeeping and Crisis management * Observer missions * Reconstruction * Humanitarian and Emergency assistance Intelligence gathering The National Commissioner of Iceland is charged with intelligence gathering for national security purposes as well as expeditionary peacekeeping operations. The Defence Department of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs oversees military related intelligence and cooperation in that field. Controversy It is often claimed that Iceland has a tradition of non- militarisation and should therefore practice pacifism. The ICRU's existence, among other things, has thus generated much controversy amongst Icelandic socialists, Social Democrats, Left-green and other people on the left-wing in Icelandic politics, with the main focus on ICRU deployments with NATO in Iraq, finalized in 2007, and in Afghanistan, ongoing, as not adhering to these principles.Krist√≠n Loftsd√≥ttir and Helga Bj√∂rnsd√≥ttir, 'The 'Jeep-Gangsters' from Iceland: Local Development Assistance in a Global Perspective', Critique of Anthropology, 30 (2010), 23--39.

This criticism was particularly fierce when Icelandic peacekeepers were injured in a suicide bombing in Kabul in 2004. In 2008, some of these concerns were addressed when a portion of ICRU deployed personnel still wearing a uniform and carrying weapons for self-defense, changed to civilian clothing and returned their weapons. According to the then Foreign Minister Ingibj√∂rg S√≥lr√∫n G√≠slad√≥ttir, ICRU personnel do not wear uniforms or carry weapons unless under special circumstances and then only those that have had the appropriate training.http://www.utanrikisraduneyti.is/frettaefni/frettatilkynningar/nr/4431 Press release on ICRU personnel status Equipment =Vehicles= * & Nissan Patrol armored and modified by Arctic Trucks for driving in mountainous terrain (PRT teams previously deployed in Afghanistan and Syria) * Santana Anibal * Iveco Trakker =Small arms= PRT teams previously deployed in Afghanistan as well as those previously working in Kabul International Airport were supplied with the weaponry and ammunition the military forces they are cooperating with use.

He wrote mostly in Pashto, but also in Persian, Hindustani, and Arabic, while he also spoke Ormuri. He is known for founding the Roshani movement, which gained many followers in the Pashtunistan region and produced numerous Pashto poets and writers. Pir Roshan created a Pashto alphabet, derived from the Arabic script with 13 new letters. A modified version of this alphabet continues to be used to write Pashto. Pir Roshan wrote Khayr al-BayƒÅn, one of the earliest known books containing Pashto prose. Pir Roshan assembled Pashtun armies to fight against the Mughal emperor Akbar in response to Akbar's continuous military agitations, and to counter Akbar's Din-i Ilahi. The Mughals referred to Pir Roshan as Pƒ´r-e TƒÅrƒ´k (). Due to Pir Roshan's spiritual and religious hold over a large portion of Pashtuns, Akbar enlisted religious figures into the struggle, most notably Pir Baba (Sayyid Ali Tirmizi) and Akhund Darweza. The Mughals persecuted Pir Roshan's followers and executed many of them. A Mughal army eventually killed Pir Roshan and most of his sons. Only his youngest son, Pir Jalala, survived the attack, and later took up arms against the Mughals and became the new leader of the Roshani movement. Roshani followers in Waziristan, Kurram, Tirah, Loya Paktia, Loy Kandahar (including Kasi tribesmen), and Nangarhar continued their struggle against the Mughals for about a hundred years after Pir Roshan's death. Biography Bayazid was born in 1525 just outside Jalandhar in Punjab (present-day India), but early in his childhood, he moved with his family to their ancestral homeland of Kaniguram in South Waziristan (present-day Pakistan). His family was one of the many Pashtun families who fled back to Pashtunistan after the Turkic ruler Babur overthrew the Pashtun Lodi dynasty in India in 1526. His father, Abdullah, was an Islamic Qadi (judge). However, his father and relatives, and later Bayazid himself, also traded between Afghanistan and India. Bayazid was against many of the customs which prevailed in the area and the benefits which his family received due to being perceived as scholarly and devout. He was known for being stubborn, strong-willed and outspoken. Bayazid began teaching at the age of 40. His message was well received by the Mohmand and Shinwari tribesmen. He then went to the Peshawar valley and spread his message to the Khalils and Muhammadzais. He sent missionaries (khalifas) to various parts of South and Central Asia. He sent one of his disciples, Dawlat Khan, along with his book Sirat at-Tawhid to Mughal Emperor Akbar. Khalifa Yusuf was sent along with his book Fakhr at-Talibin to the ruler of Badakhshan, Mirza Sulayman. Mawdud Tareen was sent to propagate his message to Kandahar, Balochistan, and Sindh. Arzani Khweshki was sent to India to convey the message to common people there. Besides, he also sent his deputies to Kabul, Balkh, Bukhara, and Samarkand. However, when he and his followers started spreading their movement amongst the Yousafzais, Bayazid came into direct confrontation with the orthodox followers of Pir Baba in Buner. He established a base in the Tirah valley where he rallied other tribes. In Oxford History of India, Vincent Smith describes this as the first \\"Pashtun renaissance\\" against Mughal rule.Vincent Smith; Oxford History of India volume Vol: VI; P- 325-40 When Mughal Emperor Akbar proclaimed Din-i Ilahi, Bayazid raised the flag of open rebellion. He led his army in several successful skirmishes and battles against Mughal forces, but they were routed in a major battle in Nangarhar by Mughal General Muhsin Khan. During the 1580s, many Yusufzais and Mandanrs rebelled against the Mughals and joined the Roshani movement of Pir Roshan. In late 1585, Mughal Emperor Akbar sent military forces under Zain Khan Koka and Birbal to crush the Roshani rebellion. In February 1586, about 8,000 Mughal soldiers, including Birbal, were killed near the Karakar Pass between Buner and Swat while fighting against the Yusufzai lashkar led by Kalu Khan. This was the greatest disaster faced by the Mughal army during Akbar's reign. However, during the attack, Pir Roshan was himself killed by the Mughal army near Topi. In 1987, Mughal general Man Singh I defeated 20,000 strong Roshani soldiers and 5,000 horsemen. Pir Roshan's five sons, however, continued fighting against the Mughals until about 1640. Successors Bayazid's sons were put to death with the exception of his youngest, Jalala, who was pardoned by Akbar as he was only 14 years old when he was captured. He later took up arms as Pir Jalala Khan and successfully engaged the Mughal armies. It is believed by some that the city of Jalalabad is named for him. After his death in battle, Jalala's nephew Ahdad Khan (also spelled Ihdad) took charge of the struggle. As part of a concerted campaign to destroy the Roshanis around 1619 or 1620, Mahabat Khan, under the Emperor Jahangir, massacred 300 Daulatzai Orakzai in the Tirah. Ghairat Khan was sent to the Tirah region to engage the Roshani forces with a large military force via Kohat.Tƒ´rƒÅh ‚Äì Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 23, p. 389. The Mughal forces were repulsed, but six years later Muzaffar Khan marched against Ahdad Khan. After several months of intense fighting, Ahdad Khan was killed. The death of Jahangir in 1627 led to a general uprising of the Pashtuns against Mughal forces. Ahdad's son Abdul Qadir returned to Tirah to seek vengeance. Under his command, the Roshani defeated Muzaffar Khan's forces en route from Peshawar to Kabul, killing Muzaffar. Abdul Qadir plundered Peshawar and invested the citadel. It was not until the time of Mughal Emperor Shah Jehan (1628‚Äì1658) that a truce was brokered ‚Äì between Akbar's grandson and Bayazid's great grandson. Bayazid Khan's descendants moved to Jullundhar and purchased lands to establish Basti Danishmandan, Basti Sheikh Derveish and later Basti Baba Khel. The Baba Khel branch of the Baraki lived in fortress-like compounds fighting the Sikhs who surrounded their lands until the early 20th century. Roshani movement  Bayazid became known for his philosophical thinking with its strong Sufi influences, radical for the times and unusual for the region. He became widely known as Pir Roshan, which in Pashto means \\"the radiant or luminous Sufi master\\". He formed the Roshani movement, which had one central tenet: the equality of every man and woman. This advocated that religious and political leaders should be chosen by merit instead of birthright, and that women should receive education and equal treatment. During the 19th century, orientalist scholars translating texts from Pashto and other regional texts termed his movement a \\"sect\\" which believed in the transmigration of souls and in the representation of God through individuals. Conspiracy theorists have likened it to remnants of the hassassin or having influenced the creation of the Illuminati in Bavaria. Many European researchers continue to hold this view, though others believe Mughal historians proliferated this as propaganda to dilute the major focus of the movement of fighting against Akbar and his Din- i-Ilahi. Writings Bayazid invented Pushto script to ensure the emergence of Pashto literature and writing. As Arabic script did not correspond to all of the sounds in spoken Pushto, he invented 13 characters to represent these additional sounds. Some of these characters indicated differences between hard and soft dialects of Pashto. Bayazid is credited with writing the first book in Pashto language, Khair-ul-Bayan, beginning Pashto literature. It was written in Pashto, Persian, Arabic, and Hindi, and is considered the first book of Pashto prose. The book was thought to be lost until an original handwritten Persian manuscript was found in the University of T√ºbingen, Germany. Maulana Abdul Qadir of Pashto Academy - Peshawar, obtained and translated it, publishing a Pashto edition in 1987. Bayazid wrote nearly a dozen books, although less than half of these have survived, mostly in private and family libraries. His works include Khayr al-Bayan, Maksud al- Muminin, Surat-i Tawhid, Fakhr, Hal-Nama Maksud al- Muminin, Surat-i Tawhid, Fakhr, and Hal-Nama Khilwat. Bayazid's contribution to Pashto nationalism and language has been neglected, possibly because he was from the tribe of Baraki, whose mother tongue was Ormuri (a different East Iranic language) and whose lineage was attributed to the Kurdistan region rather than the Pashtun confederations, although some suggest that the Barakzai (sons of Barak) are originally \\"Baraki\\". Although his ideas spread beyond the Pashtunistan region, some scholars believe that he and his movement were demonized by the Mughals. Recent books and research The invading armies in Afghanistan seem to have paid significant attention from a historical perspective. During the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan, Saint Petersburg State University Institute of Oriental Studies seemed to have been the institution tasked to study the Roshani movement in order to understand their foe. Waziristan was the focal point for some of the toughest fighters against the Soviets. Aminullah Khan Gandapur, in his book Taikh-i-Sar Zamin-i-Gomal (History of the Gomal Land; National Book Foundation-2008), ascribed a chapter to the Rochani movement and to their strife and achievement with the sword and the pen. Following the 2002 invasion, Western scholars were again sent into the field to study and understand the movement. Dr. Sergei Andreyev, was sent on UN assignment to Afghanistan, while simultaneously funded by the Institute of Ismaili Studies to research and write a book on the movement. There have been multiple editions of this book; however its sale and distribution remains restricted in 2011.

It aired on ABC in 1999 and was hosted by Brad Sherwood. John Cramer served as announcer. The show was based on a Japanese show of the same concept, Happy Family Plan. It was originally an hour-long series, but due to low ratings, was cut to a half-hour after its second episode. The show's premise centered on one member of a family (or group of people) who was given one week to practice a certain task before the episode's taping. A video camera was provided to record the rehearsal process at home. At the end of the week, the contestant (and his/her family and other supporters) came to the studio to perform the task. The contestant was given only one attempt; if successful, he/she won a pre-selected prize package worth $25,000. If unsuccessful, he/she received a $2,000 consolation prize. Two contestants appeared each episode. Some of the stunts presented: * Memorizing pi to the 100th decimal * Playing Beethoven's F√ºr Elise on a piano, without missing a note * Answering ten questions on the film Ghost * Riding around three cones on a unicycle and returning to a starting line * Pulling a tablecloth out from a fully set table without any items hitting the floor or glasses being knocked over (this stunt was featured at least twice) * Identifying 12 random flavors of Baskin-Robbins ice cream while blindfolded * Teaching a puppy 5 new tricks On later episodes, Sherwood went into the audience after the first contestant's stunt and randomly selected someone to perform a task at the end of the show (after some time to train for the task). Tasks included memorizing other audience members' names and birth months, spontaneously crying within 30 seconds, and breaking into a car on stage within 90 seconds. If successful, he/she won $5,000.

The site was in use throughout the High Middle Ages, and the castle itself dates to the fourteenth century. The High Middle Ages of Scotland encompass Scotland in the era between the death of Domnall II in 900 AD and the death of King Alexander III in 1286, which was an indirect cause of the Wars of Scottish Independence. At the close of the ninth century, various competing kingdoms occupied the territory of modern Scotland. Scandinavian influence was dominant in the northern and western islands, Brythonic culture in the southwest, the Anglo-Saxon or English Kingdom of Northumbria in the southeast and the Pictish and Gaelic Kingdom of Alba in the east, north of the River Forth. By the tenth and eleventh centuries, northern Great Britain was increasingly dominated by Gaelic culture, and by the Gaelic regal lordship of Alba, known in Latin as either Albania or Scotia, and in English as \\"Scotland\\". From its base in the east, this kingdom acquired control of the lands lying to the south and ultimately the west and much of the north. It had a flourishing culture, comprising part of the larger Gaelic-speaking world and an economy dominated by agriculture and trade. After the twelfth-century reign of King David I, the Scottish monarchs are better described as Scoto-Norman than Gaelic, preferring French culture to native Scottish culture. A consequence was the spread of French institutions and social values including Canon law. The first towns, called burghs, appeared in the same era, and as they spread, so did the Middle English language. These developments were offset by the acquisition of the Norse-Gaelic west and the Gaelicisation of many of the noble families of French and Anglo-French origin. National cohesion was fostered with the creation of various unique religious and cultural practices. By the end of the period, Scotland experienced a \\"Gaelic revival\\", which created an integrated Scottish national identity. By 1286, these economic, institutional, cultural, religious and legal developments had brought Scotland closer to its neighbours in England and the Continent, although outsiders continued to view Scotland as a provincial, even savage place. By this date, the Kingdom of Scotland had political boundaries that closely resembled those of the modern nation. Historiography Scotland in the High Middle Ages is a relatively well-studied topic and Scottish medievalists have produced a wide variety of publications. Some, such as David Dumville, Thomas Owen Clancy and Dauvit Broun, are primarily interested in the native cultures of the country, and often have linguistic training in the Celtic languages.\\"Professor David Dumville\\" . University of Aberdeen. Retrieved 11 February 2012.\\"Prof Thomas Clancy\\". University of Glasgow. Retrieved 11 February 2012. Normanists, such as G.W.S. Barrow, are concerned with the Norman and Scoto-Norman cultures introduced to Scotland after the eleventh century. For much of the twentieth century, historians tended to stress the cultural change that took place in Scotland during this time.\\"The Paradox of Medieval Scotland: 1093-1286\\" . University of Glasgow and partners. Retrieved 11 February 2012. However, scholars such as Cynthia Neville and Richard Oram, while not ignoring cultural changes, argue that continuity with the Gaelic past was just as, if not more, important.e.g. Oram, The Lordship of Galloway (2000); Boardman & Ross (eds.) The Exercise of Power in Medieval Scotland (2003); Neville, Native Lordship (2005). Since the publication of Scandinavian Scotland by Barbara E. Crawford in 1987, there has been a growing volume of work dedicated to the understanding of Norse influence in this period. However, from 849 on, when Columba's relics were removed from Iona in the face of Viking incursions, written evidence from local sources in the areas under Scandinavian influence all but vanishes for three hundred years.Woolf (2006b) p. 94. The sources for information about the Hebrides and indeed much of northern Scotland from the eighth to the eleventh century, are thus almost exclusively Irish, English or Norse. The main Norse texts were written in the early thirteenth century and should be treated with care. The English and Irish sources are more contemporary, but according to historian Alex Woolf, may have \\"led to a southern bias in the story\\", especially as much of the Hebridean archipelago became Norse-speaking during this period.Woolf (2007) p. 275. There are various traditional clan histories dating from the nineteenth century such as the \\"monumental\\" The Clan DonaldMarsden (2008) p. 33 referring to MacDonald A. and MacDonald A.

Inverness. and a significant corpus of material from the Gaelic oral tradition that relates to this period, although their value is questionable.Graham- Campbell and Batey (1998) pp. 37‚Äì46. Origins of the Kingdom of Alba Sueno's Stone Located in Forres, in the old kingdom of Fortriu, this gigantic probably post-Pictish monument marks some kind of military triumph At the close of the ninth century various polities occupied Scotland. The Pictish and Gaelic Kingdom of Alba had just been united in the east; the Scandinavian- influenced Kingdom of the Isles emerged in the west. Ragnall ua √çmair was a key figure at this time although the extent to which he ruled territory in western and northern Scotland including the Hebrides and Northern Isles is unknown as contemporary sources are silent on this matter.Woolf (2007) p. 148. Dumbarton, the capital of the Kingdom of Strathclyde had been sacked by the U√≠ √çmair in 870.Woolf (2007) p. 109. This was clearly a major assault, which may have brought the whole of mainland Scotland under temporary U√≠ Imair control.Woolf (2007) p. 115. The south-east had been absorbed by the English Kingdom of Bernicia/Northumbria in the seventh century. Galloway in the south west was a Lordship with some regality. In a Galwegian charter dated to the reign of Fergus, the Galwegian ruler styled himself rex Galwitensium, King of Galloway.Oram (2000) p. 62. In the north east the ruler of Moray was called not only \\"king\\" in both Scandinavian and Irish sources, but before M√°el Snechtai, \\"King of Alba\\".For Findl√°ech, ri Alban, Annals of Ulster, s.a. 1020; Anderson (1922) vol. i, p. 551. For M√°el Coluim, Annals of Tigernach, s.a. 1029; Anderson (1922) vol. i, p. 571. The Annals of Tigernach though styles Findl√°ech merely Mormaer. However, when Domnall mac Causant√≠n died at Dunnottar in 900, he was the first man to be recorded as r√≠ AlbanAnderson (1922) vol. i, p. 395. and his kingdom was the nucleus that would expand as Viking and other influences waned. In the tenth century the Alban elite had begun to develop a conquest myth to explain their increasing Gaelicisation at the expense of Pictish culture. Known as MacAlpin's Treason, it describes how Cin√°ed mac Ailp√≠n is supposed to have annihilated the Picts in one fell takeover. However, modern historians are now beginning to reject this conceptualization of Scottish origins.e.g. Broun (1997); Broun (2001) p. 359; Woolf (2001) p. 604; Forsyth (2005) pp. 28‚Äì31. Compare older accounts, such as Smyth (1984) pp. 175‚Äì189. No contemporary sources mention this conquest. Moreover, the Gaelicisation of Pictland was a long process predating Cin√°ed, and is evidenced by Gaelic-speaking Pictish rulers,See Clancy (2004) pp. 125‚Äì149. Pictish royal patronage of Gaelic poets,Clancy (1998) pp. 15‚Äì16, 115. and Gaelic inscriptionsWoolf (2007) pp. 62‚Äì63. and placenames.Nicolaisen (1976/2001) pp. 165‚Äì191; Taylor (1996), pp. 93‚Äì103. The change of identity can perhaps be explained by the death of the Pictish language, but also important may be Causant√≠n II's alleged Scoticisation of the \\"Pictish\\" ChurchChronicle of the Kings of Alba; Anderson (1922) vol. i, p. 445. and the trauma caused by Viking invasions, most strenuously felt in the Pictish kingdom's heartland of Fortriu.Woolf (2006) pp. 182‚Äì201. Scandinavian-influenced territories =Kingdom of the Isles= The Kingdom of the Isles comprised the Hebrides, the islands of the Firth of Clyde and the Isle of Man from the 9th to the 13th centuries AD. The islands were known to the Norse as the Su√∞reyjar, or \\"Southern Isles\\" as distinct from the Nor√∞reyjar or \\"Northern Isles\\" of Orkney and Shetland, which were held by the Earls of Orkney as vassals of the Norwegian crown throughout the High Middle Ages. The various kingdoms that comprised Scotland circa 1100 After Ragnall ua √çmair, Amla√≠b Cuar√°n, who fought at the Battle of Brunanburh in 937 and who also became King of Northumbria, is the next King of the Isles on record.Gregory (1881) pp. 4‚Äì6.Woolf (2007) pp. 45‚Äì46. In the succeeding years Norse sources also list various rulers such as Gilli, Sigurd the Stout, H√•kon EirikssonWoolf (2007) p. 246. and Thorfinn Sigurdsson as rulers over the Hebrides as vassals of the Kings of Norway or Denmark. Godred Crovan became the ruler of Dublin and Mann from 1079Gregory (1881) p. 5.The Chronicle of Man and the Sudreys (1874) p. 51. and from the early years of the twelfth century the Crovan dynasty asserted themselves and ruled as \\"Kings of Mann and the Isles\\" for the next half century. The kingdom was then sundered due to the actions of Somerled whose sons inherited the southern Hebrides while the Manx rulers held on to the \\"north isles\\" for another century.Sellar (2000) p. 193. =The North= The Scandinavian influence in Scotland was probably at its height in the mid eleventh centuryCrawford (1987) p. 221. during the time of Thorfinn Sigurdsson, who attempted to create a single political and ecclesiastical domain stretching from Shetland to Man.Crawford (1987) p. 79. The permanent Scandinavian holdings in Scotland at that time must therefore have been at least a quarter of the land area of modern Scotland. By the end of the eleventh century the Norwegian crown had come to accept that Caithness was held by the Earls of Orkney as a fiefdom from the Kings of Scotland although its Norse character was retained throughout the thirteenth century.Imsen (2007) pp. 11‚Äì12. Raghnall mac Gofraidh was granted Caithness after assisting the Scots king in a conflict with Harald Maddadson, an earl of Orkney in the early thirteenth century. In the ninth century Orcadian control stretched into Moray, which was a semi-independent kingdom for much of this early period.Mackie (1964) p. 38. The Moray rulers Macbeth (1040‚Äì1057) and his successor Lulach (1057‚Äì1058) became rulers of the entire Scottish kingdom for a time.Mackie (1964) p. 43. However, Moray was subjugated by the Scottish kings after 1130, when the native ruler, √ìengus of Moray was killed leading a rebellion. Another revolt in 1187 was equally unsuccessful.Mackie (1964) p. 52. =South west Scotland= A coin showing Magnus Barefoot, King of Norway (1093‚Äì1103) By the mid tenth century Amla√≠b Cuar√°n controlled The RhinnsWoolf (2007) p. 254. and the region gets the modern name of Galloway from the mixture of Viking and Gaelic Irish settlement that produced the Gall- Gaidel.Logan (1992) p. 49. Magnus Barelegs is said to have \\"subdued the people of Galloway\\" in the eleventh century and Whithorn seems to have been a centre of Hiberno-Norse artisans who traded around the Irish Sea by the end of the first millennium.Graham-Campbell and Batey (1998) p. 203. However, the place name, written and archaeological evidence of extensive Norse (as opposed to Norse-Gael) settlement in the area is not convincing.Graham-Campbell and Batey (1998) pp. 106‚Äì108. The ounceland system seems to have become widespread down the west coast including much of Argyll, and most of the south west apart from a region near the inner Solway Firth. In Dumfries and Galloway the place name evidence is complex and of mixed Gaelic, Norse and Danish influence, the last most likely stemming from contact with the extensive Danish holdings in northern England.Crawford (1987) pp. 87, 93, 98. Although the Scots obtained greater control after the death of Gilla Brigte and the accession of Lochlann in 1185, Galloway was not fully absorbed by Scotland until 1235, after the rebellion of the Galwegians was crushed.Oram (2000) pp. 141‚Äì146. Strathclyde The main language of Strathclyde and elsewhere in the Hen Ogledd in the opening years of the High Middle Ages was Cumbric, a variety of the British language akin to Old Welsh.Koch John T.

Some time after 1018 and before 1054, the kingdom appears to have been conquered by the Scots, most probably during the reign of M√°el Coluim mac Cin√°eda who died in 1034. At this time the territory of Strathclyde extended as far south as the River Derwent.Price (2000) p. 121. In 1054, the English king Edward the Confessor dispatched Earl Siward of Northumbria against the Scots, then ruled by Macbeth.Duncan (2002) pp. 40‚Äì41. By the 1070s, if not earlier in the reign of M√°el Coluim mac Donnchada, it appears that the Scots again controlled Strathclyde, although William Rufus annexed the southern portion in 1092. The territory was granted by Alexander I to his brother David, later King David I, in 1107.Oram (2004) pp. 60‚Äì63.

Domnall mac Causant√≠n's nickname was d√°sachtach. This simply meant a madman, or, in early Irish law, a man not in control of his functions and hence without legal culpability.Kelly (1998) p. 92. The following long reign (900‚Äì942/3) of his successor Causant√≠n is more often regarded as the key to formation of the Kingdom of Alba.Woolf (2007) p. 128. The period between the accession of M√°el Coluim I and M√°el Coluim mac Cin√°eda was marked by good relations with the Wessex rulers of England, intense internal dynastic disunity and, despite this, relatively successful expansionary policies. In 945, king M√°el Coluim I received Strathclyde as part of a deal with King Edmund of England, an event offset somewhat by M√°el Coluim's loss of control in Moray.Anderson (1922) vol. i, p. 452. Sometime in the reign of king Idulb (954‚Äì962), the Scots captured the fortress called oppidum Eden, i.e. Edinburgh.Hudson (1994) p. 89. Scottish control of Lothian was strengthened with M√°el Coluim II's victory over the Northumbrians at the Battle of Carham (1018). The Scots had probably some authority in Strathclyde since the later part of the ninth century, but the kingdom kept its own rulers, and it is not clear that the Scots were always strong enough to enforce their authority.Hudson (1994) pp. 95‚Äì96. The reign of King Donnchad I from 1034 was marred by failed military adventures, and he was killed in a battle with the men of Moray, led by Macbeth who became king in 1040.Hudson (1994) p. 124. Macbeth ruled for seventeen years, peaceful enough that he was able to leave to go on pilgrimage to Rome; however, he was overthrown by M√°el Coluim, the son of Donnchad, who some months later defeated Macbeth's stepson and successor Lulach to become king M√°el Coluim III. In subsequent medieval propaganda, Donnchad's reign was portrayed positively while Macbeth was vilified; William Shakespeare followed this distorted history with his portrayal of both the king and his queen consort, Gruoch, in his play Macbeth. St Margaret of Scotland, wife of M√°el Coluim III, from a later genealogy It was M√°el Coluim III, not his father Donnchad, who did more to create the dynasty that ruled Scotland for the following two centuries. Part of the resource was the large number of children he had, perhaps as many as a dozen, through marriage to the widow or daughter of Thorfinn Sigurdsson and afterwards to the Anglo-Hungarian princess Margaret, granddaughter of Edmund Ironside. However, despite having a royal Anglo-Saxon wife, M√°el Coluim spent much of his reign conducting slave raids against the English, adding to the woes of that people in the aftermath of the Norman Conquest of England and the Harrying of the North. Marianus Scotus narrates that \\"the Gaels and French devastated the English; and [the English] were dispersed and died of hunger; and were compelled to eat human flesh\\".Anderson (1922) vol. ii, p. 23, & n. 1. M√°el Coluim's Queen Margaret was the sister of the native claimant to the English throne, Edgar √Ütheling.Duncan (1989) p. 119. This marriage, and M√°el Coluim's raids on northern England, prompted interference by the Norman rulers of England in the Scottish kingdom.Duncan (1989) pp. 118‚Äì120. King William the Conqueror invaded and M√°el Coluim submitted to his authority, giving his oldest son Donnchad as a hostage.Duncan (1989) p. 120. From 1079 onwards there were various cross border raids by both parties and M√°el Coluim himself and Edward, his eldest son by Margaret, died in one of them in the Battle of Alnwick, in 1093.Duncan (1989) pp. 120‚Äì121. Tradition would have made his brother Domnall B√°n M√°el Coluim's successor, but it seems that Edward, his eldest son by Margaret, was his chosen heir. With M√°el Coluim and Edward dead in the same battle, and his other sons in Scotland still young, Domnall was made king. However, Donnchad II, M√°el Coluim's eldest son by his first wife, obtained some support from William Rufus and took the throne. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle his English and French followers were massacred,Anglo- Saxon Chronicle, MS. E, s.a. 1093; A. O. Anderson (1908), p. 118. and Donnchad II himself was killed later in the same year (1094) by Domnall's ally M√°el Petair of Mearns. In 1097, William Rufus sent another of M√°el Coluim's sons, Edgar, to take the kingship. The ensuing death of Domnall B√°n secured the kingship for Edgar, and there followed a period of relative peace. The reigns of both Edgar and his successor Alexander are obscure by comparison with their successors. The former's most notable act was to send a camel (or perhaps an elephant) to his fellow Gael Muircheartach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland.Annals of Inisfallen, s.a. 1105‚Äì1107/7. When Edgar died, Alexander took the kingship, while his youngest brother David became Prince of Cumbria. =Scoto-Norman kings: David I to Alexander III= David I, a pious and revolutionary Scoto-Norman king The period between the accession of David I and the death of Alexander III was marked by dependency upon and relatively good relations with the Kings of England. The period can be regarded as one of great historical transformation, part of a more general phenomenon, which has been called \\"Europeanisation\\".Schmale, Wolfgang (2011): Processes of Europeanization, European History Online, Mainz: Institute of European History. Retrieved 11 February 2012. The period also witnessed the successful imposition of royal authority across most of the modern country. After David I, and especially in the reign of William I, Scotland's Kings became ambivalent about the culture of most of their subjects.William I was known as Uilleam Garbh (i.e. \\"William the Rough\\") in the contemporary Irish annals e.g. Annals of Ulster, s.a. 1214.6; Annals of Loch C√©, s.a. 1213.10. As Walter of Coventry tells us, \\"The modern kings of Scotland count themselves as Frenchmen, in race, manners, language and culture; they keep only Frenchmen in their household and following, and have reduced the Gaels to utter servitude.\\"Memoriale Fratris Walteri de Coventria, ed. W. Stubbs, (Rolls Series, no. 58), ii. 206. This situation was not without consequence. In the aftermath of William's capture at Alnwick in 1174, the Scots turned on the small number of Middle English-speakers and French-speakers among them. William of Newburgh related that the Scots first attacked the Scoto-English in their own army, and Newburgh reported a repetition of these events in Scotland itself.William of Newburgh, \\"Historia Rerum Anglicarum\\", in R. Howlett (ed.) Chronicles of Stephen, Henry II and Richard I, (Rolls Series, no. 82), Vol. I, pp. 186‚Äì187. Walter Bower, writing a few centuries later about the same events confirms that \\"there took place a most wretched and widespread persecution of the English both in Scotland and Galloway\\".Walter Bower, Scotichronicon, VIII. 22., 30‚Äì40. The seal of William I, known as Guillaume le Lion. His title among the native Scots was probably Uilleam Garbh (i.e. \\"William the Rough\\"). The first instance of strong opposition to the Scottish kings was perhaps the revolt of √ìengus, the Mormaer of Moray. Other important resistors to the expansionary Scottish kings were Somerled, Fergus of Galloway, Gille Brigte, Lord of Galloway and Harald Maddadsson, along with two kin-groups known today as the MacHeths and the MacWilliams.Normanists tend not to emphasise opposition among the native Scots to Canmore authority, but much work has been done on the topic recently, especially R. Andrew McDonald, Outlaws of Medieval Scotland: Challenges to the Canmore Kings, 1058‚Äì1266, (East Linton, 2003). The threat from the latter was so grave that, after their defeat in 1230, the Scottish crown ordered the public execution of the infant girl who happened to be the last of the MacWilliam line. According to the Lanercost Chronicle: Many of these resistors collaborated, and drew support not just in the peripheral Gaelic regions of Galloway, Moray, Ross and Argyll, but also from eastern \\"Scotland-proper\\", and elsewhere in the Gaelic world. However, by the end of the twelfth century, the Scottish kings had acquired the authority and ability to draw in native Gaelic lords outside their previous zone of control in order to do their work, the most famous examples being Lochlann, Lord of Galloway and Ferchar mac in tSagairt. By the reign of Alexander III, the Scots were in a strong position to annex the remainder of the western seaboard, which they did following Haakon Haakonarson's ill-fated invasion and the stalemate of the Battle of Largs with the Treaty of Perth in 1266.Barrett (2008) p. 411.Hunter (2000) pp. 106‚Äì111. The conquest of the west, the creation of the Mormaerdom of Carrick in 1186 and the absorption of the Lordship of Galloway after the Galwegian revolt of Gille Ruadh in 1235Oram (2000), pp. 141‚Äì146. meant that Gaelic speakers under the rule of the Scottish king formed a majority of the population during the so-called Norman period. The integration of Gaelic, Norman and Saxon culture that began to occurMcClure \\"English in Scotland\\" in Burchfield (1994) p. 30. may have been the platform that enabled King Robert I to emerge victorious during the Wars of Independence, which followed soon after the death of Alexander III. Geography comital and other Lordships in Medieval Scotland, c. 1230 At the beginning of this period the boundaries of Alba contained only a small proportion of modern Scotland. Even when these lands were added to in the tenth and eleventh centuries, the term Scotia was applied in sources only to the region between the River Forth, the central Grampians and the River Spey and only began to be used to describe all of the lands under the authority of the Scottish crown from the second half of the twelfth century.Wyatt (2009) p. 85. By the late thirteenth century when the Treaty of York (1237) and Treaty of Perth (1266) had fixed the boundaries with the Kingdom of the Scots with England and Norway respectively, its borders were close to the modern boundaries. After this time both Berwick and the Isle of Man were lost to England, and Orkney and Shetland were gained from Norway in the fifteenth century.Thomson (2008) p. 204. The area that became Scotland in this period is divided by geology into five major regions: the Southern Uplands, Central Lowlands, the Highlands, the North-east coastal plain and the Islands. Some of these were further divided by mountains, major rivers and marshes. Most of these regions had strong cultural and economic ties elsewhere: to England, Ireland, Scandinavian and mainland Europe. Internal communications were difficult and the country lacked an obvious geographical centre.Webster (1997) pp. 9-20. Dunfermline emerged as a major royal centre in the reign of Malcolm III and Edinburgh began to be used to house royal records in the reign of David I, but, perhaps because of its proximity and vulnerability to England, it did not become a formal capital in this period.Turnock (2005) pp. 16-17. The expansion of Alba into the wider Kingdom of Scotland was a gradual process combining external conquest and the suppression of occasional rebellions with the extension of seigniorial power through the placement of effective agents of the crown. Neighbouring independent kings became subject to Alba and eventually disappeared from the records. In the ninth century the term mormaer, meaning \\"great steward\\", began to appear in the records to describe the rulers of Moray, Strathearn, Buchan, Angus and Mearns, who may have acted as \\"marcher lords\\" for the kingdom to counter the Viking threat.Webster (1997) p. 22. Later the process of consolidation is associated with the feudalism introduced by David I, which, particularly in the east and south where the crown's authority was greatest, saw the placement of lordships, often based on castles, and the creation of administrative sheriffdoms, which overlay the pattern of local thegns. It also saw the English earl and Latin comes begin to replace the mormaers in the records. The result has been seen as a \\"hybrid kingdom, in which Gaelic, Anglo-Saxon, Flemish and Norman elements all coalesced under its 'Normanised', but nevertheless native lines of kings\\".Grant (1997) p. 97. Economy and society =Economy= M√°el Coluim, essentially Scotland-proper's first towns The Scottish economy of this period was dominated by agriculture and by short-distance, local trade. There was an increasing amount of foreign trade in the period, as well as exchange gained by means of military plunder. By the end of this period, coins were replacing barter goods, but for most of this period most exchange was done without the use of metal currency.Stringer (2005) pp. 66‚Äì69. Most of Scotland's agricultural wealth in this period came from pastoralism, rather than arable farming. Arable farming grew significantly in the \\"Norman period\\", but with geographical differences, low- lying areas being subject to more arable farming than high-lying areas such as the Highlands, Galloway and the Southern Uplands. Galloway, in the words of G. W. S. Barrow, \\"already famous for its cattle, was so overwhelmingly pastoral, that there is little evidence in that region of land under any permanent cultivation, save along the Solway coast\\".Barrow (1981) p. 12. The average amount of land used by a husbandman in Scotland might have been around 26 acres.Barrow (1981) p. 18. The native Scots favoured pastoralism, in that Gaelic lords were happier to give away more land to French and Middle English- speaking settlers, while holding on tenaciously to upland regions, perhaps contributing to the Highland/Galloway-Lowland division that emerged in Scotland in the later Middle Ages.e.g. for Galloway, Oram (2000) pp. 212‚Äì213; for Strathearn and Lennox, see Neville (2005) pp. 79‚Äì130. The main unit of land measurement in Scotland was the davoch (i.e. \\"vat\\"), called the arachor in Lennox and also known as the \\"Scottish ploughgate\\". In English-speaking Lothian, it was simply ploughgate.Barrow (1981) pp. 12‚Äì15. It may have measured about ,Barrow (1981) p. 15. divided into 4 raths.Neville (2005) p. 96. Cattle, pigs and cheeses were among the chief foodstuffs,Driscoll (2002) p. 53. from a wide range of produce including sheep, fish, rye, barley, bee wax and honey. David I established the first chartered burghs in Scotland, copying the burgher charters and Leges Burgorum (rules governing virtually every aspect of life and work) almost verbatim from the English customs of Newcastle-Upon-Tyne.Barrow (1981) p. 98. Early burgesses were usually Flemish, English, French and German, rather than Gaelic Scots. The burgh's vocabulary was composed totally of either Germanic and French terms.Murison (1974) p. 74. The councils that ran individual burghs were individually known as lie doussane, meaning the dozen.Murison (1974) p. 102. =Demography and language= The population of Scotland in this period is unknown. The first reliable information in 1755 shows the inhabitants of Scotland as 1,265,380. Best estimates put the Scottish population for earlier periods in the High Middle Ages between 500,000 and 1,000,000 people, growing from a low point to a high point.Tyson (2001) p. 487‚Äì488. Linguistically, the majority of people within Scotland throughout this period spoke the Gaelic language, then simply called Scottish, or in Latin, lingua Scotica.Barrow (1981) p. 14; Barron (1934), pp. 212‚Äì213. Other languages spoken throughout this period were Old Norse and English, with the Cumbric language disappearing somewhere between 900 and 1100. Pictish may have survived into this period, but the evidence is weak. After the accession of David I, or perhaps before, Gaelic ceased to be the main language of the royal court. From his reign until the end of the period, the Scottish monarchs probably favoured the French language, as evidenced by reports from contemporary chronicles, literature and translations of administrative documents into the French language. English, with French and Flemish, became the main language of Scottish burghs. However, they were, in Barrow's words, \\"scarcely more than villages ... numbered in hundreds rather than thousands\\".Barrow (1981) pp. 93‚Äì94. =Society= The legal tract known as Laws of the Brets and Scots, probably compiled in the reign of David I, underlines the importance of the kin group as entitled to compensation for the killing of individual members. It also lists five grades of man: King, mormaer, to√≠sech, √≥cthigern and neyfs.Grant (1993) p. 42. The highest rank below the king, the mormaer (\\"great officer\\"), were probably about a dozen provincial rulers, later replaced by the English term earl. Below them the to√≠sech (leader), appear to have managed areas of the royal demesne, or that of a mormaer or abbot, within which they would have held substantial estates, sometimes described as shires and the title was probably equivalent to the later thane.Barrow (1989) pp. 15-18. The lowest free rank mentioned by the Laws of the Brets and Scots, the √≥cthigern (literally, little or young lord), is a term the text does not translate into French. There were probably relatively large numbers of free peasant farmers, called husbandmen or bondmen, in the south and north of the country, but fewer in the lands between the Forth and Sutherland until the twelfth century, when landlords began to encourage the formation of such a class through paying better wages and deliberate immigration. Below the husbandmen a class of free farmers with smaller parcels of land developed, with cottars and grazing tenants (gresemen).Barrow (1995) p. 586. The non-free naviti, neyfs or serfs existed in various forms of service, with terms with their origins in Irish practice, including cumelache, cumherba and scoloc who were tied to a lord's estate and unable to leave it without permission, but who records indicate often absconded for better wages or work in other regions or in the developing burghs. The introduction of feudalism from the time of David I, not only introduced sheriffdoms that overlay the pattern of local thanes, but also meant that new tenures were held from the king, or a superior lord, in exchange for loyalty and forms of service that were usually military.Barrel (2000) pp. 16-19. However, the imposition of feudalism continued to sit beside existing system of landholding and tenure and it is not clear how this change impacted on the lives of the ordinary free and unfree workers. In places, feudalism may have tied workers more closely to the land, but the predominantly pastoral nature of Scottish agriculture may have made the imposition of a manorial system on the English model impracticable. Obligations appear to have been limited to occasional labour service, seasonal renders of food, hospitality and money rents. Law and government Early Gaelic law tracts, first written down in the ninth century, reveal a society highly concerned with kinship, status, honour and the regulation of blood feuds. Scottish common law began to take shape at the end of the period, assimilating Gaelic and Celtic law with practices from Anglo-Norman England and the Continent.Sellar (2001) pp. 381‚Äì382. In the twelfth century, and certainly in the thirteenth, strong continental legal influences began to have more effect, such as Canon law and various Anglo-Norman practices. Pre- fourteenth century law among the native Scots is not always well attested, but extensive knowledge of early Gaelic Law gives some basis for its reconstruction. In the earliest extant Scottish legal manuscript, there is a document called Leges inter Brettos et Scottos. The document survives in Old French, and is almost certainly a French translation of an earlier Gaelic document. It retained a vast number of untranslated Gaelic legal terms.MacQueen (2002). Later medieval legal documents, written both in Latin and Middle English, contain more Gaelic legal terms, examples including slains (Old Irish sl√°n or sl√°inte; exemption) and cumherba (Old Irish comarba; ecclesiastic heir).Kelly (1988) esp. pp. 324‚Äì325. A Judex (pl. judices) represents a post-Norman continuity with the ancient Gaelic orders of lawmen called in English today Brehons. Bearers of the office almost always have Gaelic names north of the Forth or in the south-west. Judices were often royal officials who supervised baronial, abbatial and other lower-ranking \\"courts\\".Barrow (2003) pp. 69‚Äì82. However, the main official of law in the post-Davidian Kingdom of the Scots was the Justiciar who held courts and reported to the king personally. Normally, there were two Justiciarships, organised by linguistic boundaries: the Justiciar of Scotia and the Justiciar of Lothian. Sometimes Galloway had its own Justiciar too.Barrow (2003) \\"The Justiciar\\" pp. 68‚Äì109. Coronation of King Alexander on Moot Hill, Scone, beside him are the Mormaers of Strathearn and Fife. The office of Justiciar and Judex were just two ways that Scottish society was governed. In the earlier period, the king \\"delegated\\" power to hereditary native \\"officers\\" such as the Mormaers/Earls and To√≠sechs/Thanes. It was a government of gift- giving and bardic lawmen. There were also popular courts, the comhdhail, testament to which are dozens of placenames throughout eastern Scotland.McNeill & MacQueen (1996) p. 191. In the Norman period, sheriffdoms and sheriffs and, to a lesser extent, bishops (see below) became increasingly important. The former enabled the King to effectively administer royal demesne land. During David I's reign, royal sheriffs had been established in the king's core personal territories; namely, in rough chronological order, at Roxburgh, Scone, Berwick-upon-Tweed, Stirling and Perth.McNeill & MacQueen (1996) p. 193. By the reign of William I, there may have been about 30 royal sheriffdoms, including ones at Ayr and Dumfries, key locations on the borders of Galloway-Carrick. As the distribution and number of sheriffdoms expanded, so did royal control. By the end of the thirteenth century, sheriffdoms had been established in westerly locations as far-flung as Wigtown, Kintyre, Skye and Lorne.McNeill & MacQueen (1996) pp. 192‚Äì194. Through these, the thirteenth-century Scottish king exercised more control over Scotland than any of his later medieval successors. The king himself was itinerant and had no \\"capital\\" as such although Scone performed a key function. By ritual tradition, all Scottish kings in this period had to be crowned there by the Mormaers of Strathearn and Fife.Bannerman (1993) pp. 22‚Äì23. Although King David I tried to build up Roxburgh as a capital, in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, more charters were issued at Scone than any other location. Other popular locations were nearby Perth, Stirling, Dunfermline and Edinburgh.McNeill & MacQueen (1996) pp. 159‚Äì163. In the earliest part of this era, Forres and Dunkeld seem to have been the chief royal residences.See locations mentioned in the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba. Records from the Scandinavian-held lands are much-less well documented by comparison. Udal law formed the basis of the legal system and it is known that the Hebrides were taxed using the Ounceland measure.Sharples and Smith (2007) pp. 104, 109, 124. Althings were open-air governmental assemblies that met in the presence of the jarl and the meetings were open to virtually all free men.

Retrieved 3 August 2010. Warfare =Land warfare= David I knighting a squire By the twelfth century the ability of lords and the king to call on wider bodies of men beyond their household troops for major campaigns had become the \\"common\\" (communis exertcitus) or \\"Scottish army\\" (exercitus Scoticanus), the result of a universal obligation based on the holding of variously named units of land.Barrow (1992) p. 59. Later decrees indicated that the common army was a levy of all able-bodied freemen aged between 16 and 60, with 8-days warning.Brown (2004) p. 58. It produced relatively large numbers of men serving for a limited period, usually as unarmoured or poorly armoured bowmen and spearmen.Stringer (1993) pp. 30-31. In this period it continued to be mustered by the earls and they often led their men in battle, as was the case in the Battle of the Standard in 1138. It would continue to provide the vast majority of Scottish national armies, potentially producing tens of thousands of men for short periods of conflict, into the early modern era.Barrell (2000) p. 23. There also developed obligations that produced smaller numbers of feudal troops. The Davidian Revolution of the twelfth century was seen by Geoffrey Barrow as bringing \\"fundamental innovations in military organization\\". These included the knight's fee, homage and fealty, as well as castle-building and the regular use of professional cavalry,Barrow (1992b) pp. 9-11. as knights held castles and estates in exchange for service, providing troops on a 40-day basis. David's Norman followers and their retinues were able to provide a force of perhaps 200 mounted and armoured knights, but the vast majority of his forces were the \\"common army\\" of poorly armed infantry, capable of performing well in raiding and guerrilla warfare. Although such troops were only infrequently able to stand up to the English in the field, nonetheless they did manage to do so critically in the wars of independence at Stirling Bridge in 1297 and Bannockburn in 1314. =Marine warfare= The preserved remains of the Oseberg ship in the Viking Ship Museum in Oslo The Viking onslaught of the British Isles was based on superior sea- power, which enabled the creation of the thalassocracies of the north and west.

The long-ship, the key to their success, was a graceful, long, narrow, light, wooden boat with a shallow draft hull designed for speed. This shallow draft allowed navigation in waters only one metre deep and permitted beach landings, while its light weight enabled it to be carried over portages. Longships were also double-ended, the symmetrical bow and stern allowing the ship to reverse direction quickly without having to turn around.\\"Skuldelev 2 ‚Äì The great longship\\".

Forces of ships were raised through obligations of a ship-levy through the system of ouncelands and pennylands, which have been argued to date back to the muster system of D√°l Riata, but were probably introduced by Scandinavian settlers.Williams (2004) pp. 66-68. Later evidence suggests that the supply of ships for war became linked to military feudal obligations.Barrow (1988) p. 375. Viking naval power was disrupted by conflicts between the Scandinavian kingdoms, but entered a period of resurgence in the 13th century when Norwegian kings began to build some of the largest ships seen in Northern European waters, until Haakon Haakonson's ill- fated expedition in 1263 left the Scottish crown the most significant power in the region.MacQuarrie (2004) p. 153.

National Museum of Scotland. Retrieved 13 February 2012. By the tenth century all of northern Britain was Christianised, except the Scandinavian north and west, which had been lost to the church in the face of Norse settlement. =Saints= Like every other Christian country, one of the main features of medieval Scottish Christianity was the Cult of Saints. Saints of Irish origin who were particularly revered included various figures called St Faelan and St. Colman, and saints Findbar and Finan.Barrow (1989) p. 64. The most important missionary saint was Columba, who emerged as a national figure in the combined Scottish and Pictish kingdom,Duncan (1989) p. 283. with a new centre established in the east at Dunkeld by Kenneth I for part of his relics. He remained a major figure into the fourteenth century and a new foundation was endowed by William I at Arbroath Abbey and the relics in the Monymusk Reliquary handed over to the Abbot's care.Lynch (2005) p. 11.Webster (1997) pp. 52-53. Regional saints remained important to local identities. In Strathclyde the most important saint was St Kentigern, in Lothian, St CuthbertLawrence-Mathers (2003), p. 137. and after this martyrdom around 1115 a cult emerged in Orkney, Shetland and northern Scotland around Magnus Erlendsson, Earl of Orkney.Antonsson (2007). The cult of St Andrew in Scotland was established on the Eastern coast by the Pictish kings as early as the eighth century.Barrow (1988) p. 11. The shrine, which from the twelfth century was said to have contained the relics of the saint, brought to Scotland by Saint Regulus,Webster (1997) p. 55. began to attract pilgrims from Scotland, but also from England and further away. By the twelfth century the site at Kilrymont, had become known simply as St. Andrews and it became increasingly associated with Scottish national identity and the royal family. It was renewed as a focus for devotion with the patronage of Queen Margaret,Lynch (2011) p. 76. who also became important after her canonisation in 1250 and the ceremonial transfer of her remains to Dunfermline Abbey, as one of the most revered national saints. =Organisation= King Olav Tryggvason of Norway, who forcibly Christianised Orkney. Painting by Peter Nicolai Arbo There is some evidence that Christianity made inroads into the Viking controlled Highlands and Islands before the official conversion at the end of the tenth century. There are a relatively large number of isles called Pabbay or Papa in the Western and Northern Isles, which may indicate a \\"hermit's\\" or \\"priest's isle\\" from this period. Changes in patterns of grave goods and the use of Viking place names using -kirk also suggest that the Christianity had begun to spread before the official conversion.Macquarrie (2004) pp. 67-68. According to the Orkneyinga Saga the Northern Isles were Christianised by Olav Tryggvasson in 995 when he stopped at South Walls on his way from Ireland to Norway. The King summoned the jarl Sigurd the Stout and said \\"I order you and all your subjects to be baptised. If you refuse, I'll have you killed on the spot and I swear I will ravage every island with fire and steel.\\" Unsurprisingly, Sigurd agreed and the islands became Christian at a stroke,Thomson (2008) p. 69. quoting the Orkneyinga Saga chapter 12. receiving their own bishop in the early eleventh century. Elsewhere in Scandinavian Scotland the record is less clear. There was a Bishop of Iona until the late tenth century and there is then a gap of more than a century, possibly filled by the Bishops of Orkney, before the appointment of the first Bishop of Mann in 1079.Crawford (1987) p. 82. Abernethy round tower, which dates from c. 1100\\"Abernethy round tower\\" Historic Scotland. Retrieved 17 March 2012. At the beginning of the period Scottish monasticism was dominated by monks called C√©li D√© (lit. \\"vassals of God\\"), anglicised as culdees. At St Andrews and elsewhere, C√©li D√© abbeys are recorded and the round towers at Brechin and Abernethy are evidence of Irish influence.Duncan (1989) pp. 104-105. Gaelic monasticism was vibrant and expansionary for much of the period and dozens of monasteries, often called Schottenkl√∂ster, were founded by Gaelic monks on the continent.\\"Schottenkl√∂ster\\" Catholic Encyclopedia. Retrieved 17 March 2012. The introduction of the continental type of monasticism to Scotland is associated with Queen Margaret, the wife of M√°el Coluim III, although her exact role is unclear. She was in communication with Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury, and he provided a few monks for a new Benedictine abbey at Dunfermline (c. 1070).MacQuarrie (2004) pp. 117-128. Subsequent foundations under Margaret's sons, the kings Edgar, Alexander I and particularly David I, tended to be of the reformed type that followed the lead set by Cluny. These stressed the original Benedictine virtues of poverty, chastity and obedience, but also contemplation and service of the Mass and were followed in various forms by large numbers of reformed Benedictine, Augustinian and Cistercian houses. Before the twelfth century most Scottish churches had collegiate bodies of clergy who served over a wide area, often tied together by devotion to a particular missionary saint.Webster (1997) pp. 50-51. From this period local lay landholders, perhaps following the example of David I, began to adopt the continental practice of building churches on their land for the local population and endowing them with land and a priest, beginning in the south, spreading to the north-east and then the west, being almost universal by the first survey of the Scottish Church for papal taxation in 1274. The administration of these parishes was often given over to local monastic institutions in a process known as appropriation. Scotland had little clear diocesan structure before the Norman period. There were bishoprics based on various ancient churches, but some are very obscure in the records and there appear to be long vacancies.MacQuarrie (2004) pp. 109-117. From around 1070, in the reign of Malcolm III, there was a \\"Bishop of Alba\\" resident at St. Andrews, but it is not clear what authority he had over the other bishops. After the Norman Conquest of England, the Archbishops of both Canterbury and York each claimed superiority over the Scottish church. The church in Scotland attained independent status after the Papal Bull of Celestine III (Cum universi, 1192) by which all Scottish bishoprics except Galloway were formally independent of York and Canterbury. However, unlike Ireland, which had been granted four Archbishoprics in the same century, Scotland received no Archbishop and the whole Ecclesia Scoticana, with individual Scottish bishoprics (except Whithorn/Galloway), became the \\"special daughter of the see of Rome\\". It was in practice run by special councils made up of all its bishops, with the bishop of St Andrews emerging as the most important player.Bawcutt and Williams (2006) pp. 26-29. Culture Book of Deer, Folio 5r contains the text of the Gospel of Matthew from 1:18 through 1:21. Note the Chi Rho monogram in the upper left corner. The margins contain Gaelic text. As a predominantly Gaelic society, most Scottish cultural practices throughout this period mirrored closely those of Ireland, or at least those of Ireland with some Pictish borrowings. After David I, the French-speaking kings introduced cultural practices popular in Anglo-Norman England, France and elsewhere. As in all pre-modern societies, storytelling was popular. The English scholar D. D. R. Owen, who specialises in the literature of this era, writes that \\"Professional storytellers would ply their trade from court to court. Some of them would have been native Scots, no doubt offering legends from the ancient Celtic past performed ... in Gaelic when appropriate, but in French for most of the new nobility\\".Owen (1997) p. 21. Almost all of these stories are lost, although some have come down in the Gaelic or Scots oral tradition. One form of oral culture extremely well accounted for in this period is genealogy. There are dozens of Scottish genealogies surviving from this era, covering everyone from the Mormaers of Lennox and Moray to the Scottish king himself. Scotland's kings maintained an ollamh righe, a royal high poet who had a permanent place in all medieval Gaelic lordships, and whose purpose was to recite genealogies when needed, for occasions such as coronations.Bannerman (1989) pp. 120‚Äì149. Before the reign of David I, the Scots possessed a flourishing literary elite who regularly produced texts in both Gaelic and Latin that were frequently transmitted to Ireland and elsewhere. Dauvit Broun has shown that a Gaelic literary elite survived in the eastern Scottish lowlands, in places such as Loch Leven and Brechin into the thirteenth century,Broun (1998) pp. 183‚Äì201. However, surviving records are predominantly written in Latin, and their authors would usually translate vernacular terms into Latin, so that historians are faced with researching a Gaelic society clothed in Latin terminology. Even names were translated into more common continental forms; for instance, Gilla Brigte became Gilbert, √Åed became Hugh, etc.Broun (1995). As far as written literature is concerned, there may be more medieval Scottish Gaelic literature than is often thought. Almost all medieval Gaelic literature has survived because it was sustained in Ireland, not in Scotland. Thomas Owen Clancy has recently all but proven that the Lebor Bretnach, the so-called \\"Irish Nennius\\", was written in Scotland, and probably at the monastery in Abernethy. Yet this text survives only from manuscripts preserved in Ireland.Clancy (2000) pp. 87‚Äì107. Other literary work that has survived include that of the prolific poet Gille Brighde Albanach. About 1218, Gille Brighde wrote a poem ‚Äî Heading for Damietta ‚Äî on his experiences of the Fifth Crusade.For the works of (Muireadhach Albanach and) Gille Brighde Albanach, see Clancy (1998) pp. 247‚Äì283. In the thirteenth century, French flourished as a literary language, and produced the Roman de Fergus, one of the earliest pieces of non-Celtic vernacular literature to survive from Scotland. There is no extant literature in the English language in this era. There is some Norse literature from Scandinavian parts such as Darra√∞arlj√≥√∞, which is located in Caithness, the story being a \\"powerful mixture of Celtic and Old Norse imagery\\".Crawford (1987) p. 213. The famous Orkneyinga Saga, which pertains to the early history of the Earldom of Orkney, was written down in Iceland. One of only three surviving medieval Gaelic harps (Museum of Scotland) In the Middle Ages, Scotland was renowned for its musical skill. Gerald of Wales, a medieval clergyman and chronicler, explains the relation between Scottish and Irish music: Playing the harp (clarsach) was especially popular with medieval Scots ‚Äì half a century after Gerald's writing, King Alexander III kept a royal harpist at his court. Of the three medieval harps that survive, two come from Scotland (Perthshire), and one from Ireland. Singers also had a royal function. For instance, when the king of Scotland passed through the territory of Strathearn, it was the custom that he be greeted by seven female singers, who would sing to him. When Edward I approached the borders of Strathearn in the summer of 1296, he was met by these seven women, \\"who accompanied the King on the road between Gask and Ogilvie, singing to him, as was the custom in the time of the late Alexander kings of Scots\\".Calendar of documents relating to Scotland preserved in Her Majesty's Public Record Office, ed. J. Bain (4 vols, Edinburgh, 1881), vol. iv, p. 475; in Neville (2005) p. 79; and Barrow (1988) p. 5. Outsiders' views Scottish atrocities depicted in the fourteenth century Luttrell Psalter The Irish thought of Scotland as a provincial place. Others thought of it as an outlandish or barbaric place. \\"Who would deny that the Scots are barbarians?\\" was a rhetorical question posed by the author of the De expugnatione Lyxbonensi (i.e. \\"On the Conquest of Lisbon\\").MacQuarrie, \\"Crusades\\" (2001), p. 115. A century later Louis IX of France was reported to have said to his son \\"I would prefer that a Scot should come from Scotland and govern the people well and faithfully, than that you, my son, should be seen to govern badly.\\" This characterisation of the Scots was often politically motivated, and many of the most hostile writers were based in areas frequently subjected to Scottish raids. English and French accounts of the Battle of the Standard contain many accounts of Scottish atrocities. For instance, Henry of Huntingdon notes that the Scots: \\"cleft open pregnant women, and took out the unborn babes; they tossed children upon the spear-points, and beheaded priests on altars: they cut the head of crucifixes, and placed them on the trunks of the slain; and placed the heads of the dead upon the crucifixes. Thus wherever the Scots arrived, all was full of horror and full of savagery.\\"Henry of Huntingdon, Historia Anglorum, in Anderson (1908) p. 179. A less hostile view was given by Guibert of Nogent in the First Crusade, who encountered Scots and wrote that: \\"You might have seen a crowd of Scots, a people savage at home but unwarlike elsewhere, descend from their marshy lands, with bare legs, shaggy cloaks, their purse hanging from their shoulders; their copious arms seemed ridiculous to us, but they offered their faith and devotion as aid.\\" There was also a general belief that Scotland-proper was an island, or at least a peninsula, known as Scotia, Alba or Albania. Matthew Paris, a Benedictine monk and cartographer, drew a map in this manner in the mid-thirteenth century and called the \\"island\\" Scotia ultra marina.see \\"Matthew Paris' map of Great Britain. St Albans, c. 1250\\". The British Library. Retrieved 11 February 2012. A later medieval Italian map applies this geographical conceptualization to all of Scotland.see \\"portolan chart, Vesconte Maggiolo, 1512\\". Henry Davis Consulting. Retrieved 11 February 2012. The Arab geographer al-Idrisi, shared this view: \\"Scotland adjoins the island of England and is a long peninsula to the north of the larger island. It is uninhabited and has neither town nor village. Its length is 150 miles.\\"al-Idrisi, Opus Geographicum, quoted in Bernard Lewis, The Muslim Discovery of Europe (New York, 1982), p. 147. National identity The Royal Standard of Scotland, first adopted by king William I, (1143‚Äì1214) In this period, the word \\"Scot\\" was not the word used by vast majority of Scots to describe themselves, except to foreigners, among whom it was the most common word. The Scots called themselves Albanach or simply Gaidel. Both \\"Scot\\" and Gaidel were ethnic terms that connected them to the majority of the inhabitants of Ireland. As the author of De Situ Albanie notes at the beginning of the thirteenth century: \\"The name Arregathel [Argyll] means margin of the Scots or Irish, because all Scots and Irish are generally called 'Gattheli'.\\"De Situ Albanie, quoted by Anderson (1922) vol. i. p. cxviii. Likewise, the inhabitants of English and Norse-speaking parts were ethnically linked with other regions of Europe. At Melrose, people could recite religious literature in the English language.Bartlett (2000) p. 77. In the later part of the twelfth century, the Lothian writer Adam of Dryburgh describes Lothian as \\"the Land of the English in the Kingdom of the Scots\\".Stringer (2000) p. 133. In the Northern Isles the Norse language evolved into the local Norn, which lingered until the end of the eighteenth century, when it finally died outLamb (2003) p. 250. and Norse may also have survived as a spoken language until the sixteenth century in the Outer Hebrides.Jennings and Kruse (2007) p. 97. Scotland came to possess a unity that transcended Gaelic, English, Norman and Norse ethnic differences and by the end of the period, the Latin, Norman-French and English word \\"Scot\\" could be used for any subject of the Scottish king. Scotland's multilingual Scoto- Norman monarchs and mixed Gaelic and Scoto-Norman aristocracy all became part of the \\"Community of the Realm\\", in which ethnic differences were less divisive than in Ireland and Wales.Barrow (1981) pp. 122‚Äì143; Davies (2000) p. 188.

Over the next nearly seven years, Rejewski and fellow mathematician-cryptologists Jerzy R√≥≈ºycki and Henryk Zygalski developed and used techniques and equipment to decrypt the German machine ciphers, even as the Germans introduced modifications to their equipment and encryption procedures. Five weeks before the outbreak of World War II the Poles, at a conference in Warsaw, shared their achievements with the French and British, thus enabling Britain to begin reading German Enigma-encrypted messages, seven years after Rejewski's original reconstruction of the machine. The intelligence that was gained by the British from Enigma decrypts formed part of what was code-named Ultra and contributed‚Äîperhaps decisively‚Äîto the defeat of Germany. In 1929, while studying mathematics at Pozna≈Ñ University, Rejewski attended a secret cryptology course conducted by the Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau (Biuro Szyfr√≥w), which he joined in September 1932. The Bureau had had no success in reading Enigma-enciphered messages and set Rejewski to work on the problem in late 1932; he deduced the machine's secret internal wiring after only a few weeks. Rejewski and his two colleagues then developed successive techniques for the regular decryption of Enigma messages. His own contributions included the cryptologic card catalog, derived using the cyclometer that he had invented, and the cryptologic bomb. Five weeks before the German invasion of Poland in 1939, Rejewski and colleagues presented their achievements to French and British intelligence representatives summoned to Warsaw. Shortly after the outbreak of war, the Polish cryptologists were evacuated to France, where they continued breaking Enigma-enciphered messages. They and their support staff were again compelled to evacuate after the fall of France in June 1940, and they resumed work undercover a few months later in Vichy France. After the French \\"Free Zone\\" was occupied by Germany in November 1942, Rejewski and Zygalski fled via Spain, Portugal, and Gibraltar to Britain. There they enlisted in the Polish Armed Forces and were put to work solving low-grade German ciphers. After the war, Rejewski reunited with his family in Poland and worked as an accountant. For two decades, he remained silent about his prewar and wartime cryptologic work to avoid adverse attention from the country's Soviet-dominated government; he broke his silence in 1967 when he provided to the Polish Military Historical Institute his memoirs of his work in the Cipher Bureau. He died at age 74 of a heart attack and was interred with military honors at Warsaw's PowƒÖzki Military Cemetery. Early life Rejewski's birthplace Pozna≈Ñ Castle. Gauss' grave (G√∂ttingen). Marian Rejewski was born 16 August 1905 in Bromberg in the Prussian Province of Posen (now Bydgoszcz, Poland) to J√≥zef and Matylda, n√©e Thoms.Information on Marian Rejewski's military service record, reproduced in After completing secondary school, he studied mathematics at Pozna≈Ñ University's Mathematics Institute, housed in Pozna≈Ñ Castle. In 1929, shortly before graduating from university, Rejewski began attending a secret cryptology course which opened on 15 January,The exact opening date is pinpointed in a 29 January 1929 letter of appreciation to Professor Krygowski from the Chief of the Polish General Staff, Gen. Tadeusz Piskor. . organized for select German-speaking mathematics students by the Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau with the help of the Mathematics Institute's Professor Zdzis≈Çaw Krygowski. The course was conducted off-campus at a military facility and, as Rejewski would discover in France in 1939, \\"was entirely and literally based\\" on French Colonel Marcel Givierge's 1925 book, Cours de cryptographie (Cryptography Course). Rejewski and fellow students Henryk Zygalski and Jerzy R√≥≈ºycki were among the few who could keep up with the course while balancing the demands of their normal studies. On 1 March 1929 Rejewski graduated with a Master of Philosophy degree in mathematics.Information on Marian Rejewski's Master of Philosophy diploma, 1 March 1929, reproduced in A few weeks after graduating, and without having completed the Cipher Bureau's cryptology course, he began the first year of a two-year actuarial statistics course at G√∂ttingen, Germany. He did not complete the statistics course, because while home for the summer of 1930, he accepted an offer, from Professor Krygowski, of a mathematics teaching assistantship at Pozna≈Ñ University. He also began working part-time for the Cipher Bureau, which by then had set up an outpost at Pozna≈Ñ to decrypt intercepted German radio messages. Rejewski worked some twelve hours a week near the Mathematics Institute in an underground vault referred to puckishly as the \\"Black Chamber\\". The Pozna≈Ñ branch of the Cipher Bureau was disbanded in the summer of 1932. In Warsaw, on 1 September 1932, Rejewski, Zygalski, and R√≥≈ºycki joined the Cipher Bureau as civilian employees working at the General Staff building (the Saxon Palace). Their first assignment was to solve a four-letter code used by the ' (German Navy). Progress was initially slow, but sped up after a test exchange‚Äîconsisting of a six-group signal, followed by a four-group response‚Äîwas intercepted. The cryptologists guessed correctly that the first signal was the question, \\"When was Frederick the Great born?\\" followed by the response, \\"1712.\\" On 20 June 1934 Rejewski married Irena Maria Lewandowska, daughter of a prosperous dentist. The couple eventually had two children: a son, Andrzej (Andrew), born in 1936; and a daughter, Janina (Joan), born in 1939. Janina would later become a mathematician like her father. Enigma machine Enigma machine, solved by Rejewski in 1932 The Enigma machine was an electromechanical device, equipped with a 26-letter keyboard and 26 lamps, corresponding to the letters of the alphabet. Inside was a set of wired drums (rotors and a reflector) that scrambled the input. The machine used a plugboard to swap pairs of letters, and the encipherment varied from one key press to the next. For two operators to communicate, both Enigma machines had to be set up in the same way. The large number of possibilities for setting the rotors and the plugboard combined to form an astronomical number of configurations, and the settings were changed daily, so the machine code had to be \\"broken\\" anew each day. Before 1932, the Cipher Bureau had succeeded in solving an earlier Enigma machine that functioned without a plugboard, but had been unsuccessful with the Enigma I, a new standard German cipher machine that was coming into widespread use. In late October or early November 1932, the head of the Cipher Bureau's German section, Captain Maksymilian Ciƒô≈ºki, tasked Rejewski to work alone on the German Enigma I machine for a couple of hours per day; Rejewski was not to tell his colleagues what he was doing. Solving the wiring To decrypt Enigma messages, three pieces of information were needed: (1) a general understanding of how Enigma functioned; (2) the wiring of the rotors; and (3) the daily settings (the sequence and orientations of the rotors, and the plug connections on the plugboard). Rejewski had only the first at his disposal, based on information already acquired by the Cipher Bureau. cycle formed by the first and fourth letters of a set of indicators. Rejewski exploited these cycles to deduce the Enigma rotor wiring in 1932, and to solve the daily message settings. First Rejewski tackled the problem of discovering the wiring of the rotors. To do this, according to historian David Kahn, he pioneered the use of pure mathematics in cryptanalysis. Previous methods had largely exploited linguistic patterns and the statistics of natural-language texts‚Äîletter-frequency analysis. Rejewski applied techniques from group theory‚Äîtheorems about permutations‚Äîin his attack on Enigma. These mathematical techniques, combined with material supplied by Gustave Bertrand, chief of French radio intelligence, enabled him to reconstruct the internal wirings of the machine's rotors and nonrotating reflector. \\"The solution\\", writes Kahn, \\"was Rejewski's own stunning achievement, one that elevates him to the pantheon of the greatest cryptanalysts of all time.\\" Rejewski used a mathematical theorem‚Äîthat two permutations are conjugate if and only if they have the same cycle structure‚Äîthat mathematics professor and Cryptologia co- editor Cipher A. Deavours describes as \\"the theorem that won World War II\\".Cipher A. Deavours, in an afterword to . Before receiving the French intelligence material, Rejewski had made a careful study of Enigma messages, particularly of the first six letters of messages intercepted on a single day. For security, each message was encrypted using different starting positions of the rotors, as selected by the operator. This message setting was three letters long. To convey it to the receiving operator, the sending operator began the message by sending the message setting in a disguised form‚Äîa six- letter indicator. The indicator was formed using the Enigma with its rotors set to a common global setting for that day, termed the ground setting, which was shared by all operators. The particular way that the indicator was constructed introduced a weakness into the cipher. For example, suppose the operator chose the message setting \`KYG\` for a message. The operator would first set the Enigma's rotors to the ground setting, which might be \`GBL\` on that particular day, and then encrypt the message setting on the Enigma twice; that is, the operator would enter \`KYGKYG\` (which might come out to something like \`QZKBLX\`). The operator would then reposition the rotors at \`KYG\`, and encrypt the actual message. A receiving operator could reverse the process to recover first the message setting, then the message itself. The repetition of the message setting was apparently meant as an error check to detect garbles, but it had the unforeseen effect of greatly weakening the cipher. Due to the indicator's repetition of the message setting, Rejewski knew that, in the plaintext of the indicator, the first and fourth letters were the same, the second and fifth were the same, and the third and sixth were the same. These relations could be exploited to break into the cipher. Rejewski studied these related pairs of letters. For example, if there were four messages that had the following indicators on the same day: \`BJGTDN\`, \`LIFBAB\`, \`ETULZR\`, \`TFREII\`, then by looking at the first and fourth letters of each set, he knew that certain pairs of letters were related. \`B\` was related to \`T\`, \`L\` was related to \`B\`, \`E\` was related to \`L\`, and \`T\` was related to \`E\`: (\`B\`,\`T\`), (\`L\`,\`B\`), (\`E\`,\`L\`), and (\`T\`,\`E\`). If he had enough different messages to work with, he could build entire sequences of relationships: the letter \`B\` was related to \`T\`, which was related to \`E\`, which was related to \`L\`, which was related to \`B\` (see diagram). This was a \\"cycle of 4\\", since it took four jumps until it got back to the start letter. Another cycle on the same day might be \`A\`rightarrow\`F\`rightarrow\`W\`rightarrow\`A\`, or a \\"cycle of 3\\". If there were enough messages on a given day, all the letters of the alphabet might be covered by a number of different cycles of various sizes. The cycles would be consistent for one day, and then would change to a different set of cycles the next day. Similar analysis could be done on the 2nd and 5th letters, and the 3rd and 6th, identifying the cycles in each case and the number of steps in each cycle. Enigma operators also had a tendency to choose predictable letter combinations as indicators, such as girlfriends' initials or a pattern of keys that they saw on the Enigma keyboard. These became known to the allies as \\"Cillies\\" (\\"Sillies\\" misspelled). Using the data thus gained from the study of cycles and the use of predictable indicators, Rejewski was able to deduce six permutations corresponding to the encipherment at six consecutive positions of the Enigma machine. These permutations could be described by six equations with various unknowns, representing the wiring within the entry drum, rotors, reflector, and plugboard. =French help= At this point, Rejewski ran into difficulties due to the large number of unknowns in the set of equations that he had developed. He would later comment in 1980 that it was still not known whether such a set of six equations was soluble without further data. But he was assisted by cryptographic documents that Section D of French military intelligence (the Deuxi√®me Bureau), under future General Gustave Bertrand, had obtained and passed on to the Polish Cipher Bureau. The documents, procured from a spy in the German Cryptographic Service, Hans-Thilo Schmidt, included the Enigma settings for the months of September and October 1932. About 9 or 10 December 1932, the documents were given to Rejewski. They enabled him to reduce the number of unknowns and solve the wirings of the rotors and reflector. There was another obstacle to overcome, however. The military Enigma had been modified from the commercial Enigma, of which Rejewski had had an actual example to study. In the commercial machine, the keys were connected to the entry drum in German keyboard order (\\"QWERTZU...\\"). However, in the military Enigma, the connections had instead been wired in alphabetical order: \\"ABCDEF...\\" This new wiring sequence foiled British cryptologists working on Enigma, who dismissed the \\"ABCDEF...\\" wiring as too obvious. Rejewski, perhaps guided by an intuition about a German fondness for order, simply guessed that the wiring was the normal alphabetic ordering. He later recalled that, after he had made this assumption, \\"from my pencil, as by magic, began to issue numbers designating the connections in rotor N. Thus the connections in one rotor, the right-hand rotor, were finally known.\\" The settings provided by French Intelligence covered two months that straddled a changeover period for the rotor ordering. A different rotor happened to be in the right-hand position for the second month, and so the wirings of two rotors could be recovered by the same method. Rejewski later recalled: \\"Finding the [wiring] in the third [rotor], and especially... in the [reflector], now presented no great difficulties. Likewise there were no difficulties with determining the correct torsion of the [rotors'] side walls with respect to each other, or the moments when the left and middle drums turned.\\" By year's end 1932, the wirings of all three rotors and the reflector had been recovered. A sample message in an Enigma instruction manual, providing a plaintext and its corresponding ciphertext produced using a stated daily key and message key, helped clarify some remaining details. There has been speculation as to whether the rotor wirings could have been solved without the documents supplied by French Intelligence. Rejewski recalled in 1980 that another way had been found that could have been used to solve the wirings, but that the method was \\"imperfect and tedious\\" and relied on chance. In 2005, mathematician John Lawrence claimed that it would have taken four years for this method to have had a reasonable likelihood of success.; Rejewski had earlier written that \\"the conclusion is that the intelligence material furnished to us should be regarded as having been decisive to solution of the machine.\\" Solving daily settings After Rejewski had determined the wiring in the remaining rotors, he was joined in early 1933 by R√≥≈ºycki and Zygalski in devising methods and equipment to break Enigma ciphers routinely. Rejewski later recalled: > Now we had the machine, but we didn't have the keys and we couldn't very > well require Bertrand to keep on supplying us with the keys every month ... > The situation had reversed itself: before, we'd had the keys but we hadn't > had the machine‚Äîwe solved the machine; now we had the machine but we didn't > have the keys. We had to work out methods to find the daily keys. =Early methods= Cyclometer, devised in the mid-1930s by Rejewski to catalog the cycle structure of Enigma permutations. A number of methods and devices had to be invented in response to continual improvements in German operating procedure and to the Enigma machine itself. The earliest method for reconstructing daily keys was the \\"grill\\", based on the fact that the plugboard's connections exchanged only six pairs of letters, leaving fourteen letters unchanged. Next was R√≥≈ºycki's \\"clock\\" method, which sometimes made it possible to determine which rotor was at the right-hand side of the Enigma machine on a given day. After 1 October 1936, German procedure changed, and the number of plugboard connections became variable, ranging between five and eight. As a result, the grill method became considerably less effective. However, a method using a card catalog had been devised around 1934 or 1935, and was independent of the number of plug connections. The catalog was constructed using Rejewski's \\"cyclometer\\", a special-purpose device for creating a catalog of permutations. Once the catalog was complete, the permutation could be looked up in the catalog, yielding the Enigma rotor settings for that day. The cyclometer comprised two sets of Enigma rotors, and was used to determine the length and number of cycles of the permutations that could be generated by the Enigma machine. Even with the cyclometer, preparing the catalog was a long and difficult task. Each position of the Enigma machine (there were 17,576 positions) had to be examined for each possible sequence of rotors (there were 6 possible sequences); therefore, the catalog comprised 105,456 entries. Preparation of the catalog took over a year, but when it was ready about 1935, it made obtaining daily keys a matter of 12‚Äì20 minutes. However, on 1 or 2 November 1937, the Germans replaced the reflector in their Enigma machines, which meant that the entire catalog had to be recalculated from scratch. Nonetheless, by January 1938 the Cipher Bureau's German section was reading a remarkable 75% of Enigma intercepts, and according to Rejewski, with a minimal increase in personnel this could have been increased to 90%. =Bomba and sheets= Zygalski sheet In 1937 Rejewski, along with the German section of the Cipher Bureau, transferred to a secret facility near Pyry in the Kabaty Woods south of Warsaw. On 15 September 1938, the Germans introduced new rules for enciphering message keys (a new \\"indicator procedure\\"), making the Poles' earlier techniques obsolete. The Polish cryptanalysts rapidly responded with new techniques. One was Rejewski's ', an electrically powered aggregate of six Enigmas, which solved the daily keys within about two hours. Six bombas were built and were ready for use by mid- November 1938. The bomba exploited the fact that the plugboard connections did not affect all the letters; therefore, when another change to German operating procedure occurred on 1 January 1939, increasing the number of plugboard connections, the usefulness of the bombas was greatly reduced. The British bombe, the main tool that would be used to break Enigma messages during World War II, would be named after, and likely inspired by, the Polish bomba, though the cryptologic methods embodied in the two machines were different. Around the same time as Rejewski's bomba, a manual method was invented by Henryk Zygalski, that of \\"perforated sheets\\" (\\"Zygalski sheets\\"), which was independent of the number of plugboard connections. Rejewski describes the construction of the Zygalski mechanism and its manipulation: However, application of both the bomba and Zygalski sheets was complicated by yet another change to the Enigma machine on 15 December 1938. The Germans had supplied Enigma operators with an additional two rotors to supplement the original three, and this increased the complexity of decryption tenfold. Building ten times as many bombas (60 would now be needed) was beyond the Cipher Bureau's ability‚Äîthat many bombas would have cost fifteen times its entire annual equipment budget. Two and a half weeks later, effective 1 January 1939, the Germans increased the number of plug connections to 7‚Äì10, which, writes Rejewski, \\"to a great degree, decreased the usefulness of the bombs.\\" Zygalski's perforated (\\"Zygalski\\") sheets, writes Rejewski, \\"like the card-catalog method, was independent of the number of plug connections. But the manufacture of these sheets, [...] in our [...] circumstances, was very time-consuming, so that by 15 December 1938, only one-third of the whole job had been done. [T]he Germans' [introduction of rotors] IV and V [...] increased the labor of making the sheets tenfold [since 60, or ten times as many, sets of sheets were now needed], considerably exceeding our [...] capacities.\\" =Allies informed= 2002 plaque, Bletchley Park, \\"commemorat[ing] the work of Marian Rejewski, Jerzy R√≥≈ºycki, and Henryk Zygalski, mathematicians of the Polish intelligence service, in first breaking the Enigma code [sic: it was a cipher]. Their work greatly assisted the Bletchley Park code breakers and contributed to the Allied victory in World War II.\\" As it became clear that war was imminent and that Polish financial resources were insufficient to keep pace with the evolution of Enigma encryption (e.g., due to the prohibitive expense of an additional 54 bombas and due to the Poles' difficulty in producing in timely fashion the full 60 series of 26 \\"Zygalski sheets\\", cited in .), the Polish General Staff and government decided to initiate their Western allies into the secrets of Enigma decryption. The Polish methods were revealed to French and British intelligence representatives in a meeting at Pyry, south of Warsaw, on 25 July 1939. France was represented by Gustave Bertrand and Air Force cryptologist Captain Henri Braqueni√©; Britain, by Government Code and Cypher School chief Alastair Denniston, veteran cryptologist Alfred Dillwyn Knox, and Commander Humphrey Sandwith, head of the section that had developed and controlled the Royal Navy's intercept and direction-finding stations. The Polish hosts included Cipher Bureau chief Gwido Langer, the Bureau's German-Section chief Maksymilian Ciƒô≈ºki, the Bureau's General-Staff-Intelligence supervisor Stefan Mayer, and the three cryptologists Rejewski, R√≥≈ºycki and Zygalski.; ; The Poles' gift of Enigma decryption to their Western allies, five weeks before the outbreak of World War II, came not a moment too soon. Knowledge that the cipher was crackable was a morale boost to Allied cryptologists. The British were able to manufacture at least two complete sets of perforated sheets‚Äîthey sent one to PC Bruno, outside Paris, in mid-December 1939‚Äîand began reading Enigma within months of the outbreak of war. Without the Polish assistance, British cryptologists would, at the very least, have been considerably delayed in reading Enigma. Hugh Sebag-Montefiore concludes that substantial breaks into German Army and Air Force Enigma ciphers by the British would have occurred only after November 1941 at the earliest, after an Enigma machine and key lists had been captured, and similarly into Naval Enigma only after late 1942. Intelligence gained from solving high-level German ciphers‚Äîintelligence codenamed Ultra by the British and Americans‚Äîcame chiefly from Enigma decrypts. While the exact contribution of Ultra intelligence to Allied victory is disputed, Kozaczuk and Straszak note that \\"it is widely believed that Ultra saved the world at least two years of war and possibly prevented Hitler from winning.\\" The English historian Sir Harry Hinsley, who worked at Bletchley Park, similarly assessed it as having \\"shortened the war by not less than two years and probably by four years\\". The availability of Ultra was due to the earlier Polish breaking of Enigma; Gordon Welchman, head of Bletchley Park's Hut 6 (which solved German Army and Air Force Enigma ciphers), writes: \\"Hut 6 Ultra would never have gotten off the ground if we had not learned from the Poles, in the nick of time, the details both of the German military version of the commercial Enigma machine, and of the operating procedures that were in use.\\" In France and Britain =PC Bruno= On 5 September 1939 the Cipher Bureau began preparations to evacuate key personnel and equipment from Warsaw. Soon a special evacuation train, the Echelon F, transported them eastward, then south. By the time the Cipher Bureau was ordered to cross the border into allied Romania on 17 September, they had destroyed all sensitive documents and equipment and were down to a single very crowded truck. The vehicle was confiscated at the border by a Romanian officer, who separated the military from the civilian personnel. Taking advantage of the confusion, the three mathematicians ignored the Romanian's instructions. They anticipated that in an internment camp they might be identified by the Romanian security police, in which the German Abwehr and SD had informers. The mathematicians went to the nearest railroad station, exchanged money, bought tickets, and boarded the first train headed south. After a dozen or so hours, they reached Bucharest, at the other end of Romania. There they went to the British embassy. Told by the British to \\"come back in a few days\\", they next tried the French embassy, introducing themselves as \\"friends of Bolek\\" (Bertrand's Polish code name) and asking to speak with a French military officer. A French Army colonel telephoned Paris and then issued instructions for the three Poles to be assisted in evacuating to Paris. On 20 October 1939 the three Polish cryptologists resumed work on German ciphers at a joint French‚ÄìPolish‚ÄìSpanish radio-intelligence unit stationed at Gretz-Armainvilliers, forty kilometers northeast of Paris, and housed in the Ch√¢teau de Vignolles (code-named PC Bruno). As late as 3‚Äì7 December 1939, when Lt. Col. Langer and French Air Force Capt. Henri Braqueni√© visited London and Bletchley Park, the British asked that the Polish cryptologists be made available to them in Britain. Langer, however, took the position that they must remain where the Polish Army in exile was forming‚Äîon French soil. On 17 January 1940 the Poles found the first Enigma key to be solved in France, one for 28 October 1939. The PC Bruno staff collaborated by teleprinter with counterparts at Bletchley Park in England. For their mutual communications security, the Polish, French, and British cryptologic agencies used the Enigma machine itself. Bruno closed its Enigma-encrypted messages to Britain with an ironic \\"Heil Hitler!\\" In the first months of 1940, Alan Turing‚Äîprincipal designer of the British cryptological Bombe, elaborated from the Polish bomba‚Äîwould visit Bruno to confer about Enigma decryption with the three Polish cryptologists. On 24 June 1940, after Germany's victory in the Battle of France, Gustave Bertrand flew Bruno's international personnel‚Äîincluding fifteen Poles, and seven Spaniards who worked on Italian ciphers‚Äîin three planes to Algeria. =Cadix= Some three months later, in September 1940, they returned to work covertly in unoccupied southern, Vichy France. Rejewski's cover was as Pierre Ranaud, a lyc√©e professor from Nantes. A radio-intelligence station was set up at the Ch√¢teau des Fouzes, code-named Cadix, near Uz√®s. Cadix began operations on 1 October. Rejewski and his colleagues solved German telegraph ciphers, and also the Swiss version of the Enigma machine (which had no plugboard). Rejewski may have had little or no involvement in working on German Enigma at Cadix. In early July 1941, Rejewski and Zygalski were asked to try solving messages enciphered on the secret Polish Lacida cipher machine, which was used for secure communications between Cadix and the Polish General Staff in London. Lacida was a rotor machine based on the same cryptographic principle as Enigma, yet had never been subjected to rigorous security analysis. The two cryptologists created consternation by breaking the first message within a couple of hours; further messages were solved in a similar way. The youngest of the three Polish mathematicians who had worked together since 1929‚ÄîJerzy R√≥≈ºycki‚Äîdied in the sinking of a French passenger ship on 9 January 1942, as he was returning to Cadix from a stint in Algeria. By summer 1942 work at Cadix was becoming dangerous, and plans for evacuation were drawn up. Vichy France was liable to be occupied by German troops, and Cadix's radio transmissions were increasingly at risk of detection by the German Funkabwehr, a unit tasked with locating enemy radio transmitters. Indeed, on 6 November a pickup truck equipped with a circular antenna arrived at the gate of the Ch√¢teau des Fouzes where the cryptologists were operating. The visitors, however, did not enter, and merely investigated nearby farms, badly frightening their occupants. Nonetheless, at Bertrand's suggestion French intelligence ordered the evacuation of Cadix. The order was carried out on 9 November, the day after the Allied \\"Operation Torch\\" landings in North Africa. Three days later, on 12 November, the Germans occupied the chateau. =Escaping France= The Poles were split into groups of two and three. On 11 November 1942 Rejewski and Zygalski were sent to Nice, in the Italian-occupied zone. After coming under suspicion there, they had to flee again, moving or hiding constantly. Their trek took them to Cannes, Antibes, back to Nice, then on to Marseilles, Toulouse, Narbonne, Perpignan, and Ax-les-Thermes, near the Spanish border. On 29 January 1943, accompanied by a local guide, Rejewski, and Zygalski, bound for Spain, began a climb over the Pyrenees, avoiding German and Vichy patrols. Near midnight, close to the Spanish border, the guide pulled out a pistol and demanded that they hand over their remaining money. After being robbed, Rejewski and Zygalski succeeded in reaching the Spanish side of the border, only to be arrested within hours by security police. They were sent first to a prison in La Seu d'Urgell, then on 24 March transferred to a prison at Lerida. On 4 May 1943, after having spent over three months in Spanish prisons, on intervention by the Polish Red Cross the pair were released and sent to Madrid. Leaving there on 21 July, they made it to Portugal; from there, aboard HMS Scottish, to Gibraltar; and then by air to RAF Hendon in north London, arriving on 3 August 1943. =Britain= Marian Rejewski, second lieutenant (signals), Polish Army in Britain, in late 1943 or in 1944, 11 or 12 years after he first broke Enigma Rejewski and Zygalski were inducted as privates into the Polish Armed Forces on 16 August 1943 and were posted to a Polish Army facility in Boxmoor, cracking German SS and SD hand ciphers. The ciphers were usually based on the Doppelkassettenverfahren (\\"double Playfair\\") system, which the two cryptologists had already worked on in France. British cryptologist Alan Stripp suggests that \\"Setting them to work on the Doppelkassetten system was like using racehorses to pull wagons.\\" On 10 October 1943, Rejewski and Zygalski were commissioned second lieutenants; on 1 January 1945 Rejewski, and presumably also Zygalski, were promoted to lieutenant. When Gustave Bertrand fled to England in June 1944, he and his wife were provided with a house in Boxmoor, a short walk from the Polish radio station and cryptology office, where it seems likely that his collaboration with Rejewski and Zygalski continued. Enigma decryption, however, had become an exclusively British and American domain; the Polish mathematicians who had laid the foundations for Allied Enigma decryption were now excluded from making further contributions in this area. By that time, at Bletchley Park, \\"very few even knew about the Polish contribution\\" because of the strict secrecy and the \\"need-to-know\\" principle. Back in Poland After the Germans suppressed the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, they sent Rejewski's wife and children west, along with other Warsaw survivors; the family eventually found refuge with her parents in Bydgoszcz. Rejewski was discharged from the Polish Army in Britain on 15 November 1946. Six days later, he returned to Poland to be reunited with his wife and family. On his return, he was urged by his old Pozna≈Ñ University professor, Zdzis≈Çaw Krygowski, to take a university mathematics post at Pozna≈Ñ or Szczecin, in western Poland. Rejewski could have looked forward to rapid advancement because of personnel shortages as a result of the war. However, he was still recovering from rheumatism, which he had contracted in the Spanish prisons. Soon after his return to Poland, in the summer of 1947, his 11-year-old son Andrzej died of polio after only five days' illness. After his son's death, Rejewski did not want to part, even briefly, with his wife and daughter, so they lived in Bydgoszcz with his in- laws. Rejewski took a position in Bydgoszcz as director of the sales department at a cable-manufacturing company, Kabel Polski (Polish Cable). 2005 Bydgoszcz memorial unveiled on the centennial of Rejewski's birth. It resembles the Alan Turing Memorial in Manchester. 2005 Polish prepaid postcard, on centennial of Rejewski's birth Between 1949 and 1958 Rejewski was repeatedly investigated by the Polish Office of Public Security, who suspected he was a former member of the Polish Armed Forces in the West. He retired in 1967, and moved with his family back to Warsaw in 1969, to an apartment he had acquired 30 years earlier with financial help from his father-in-law. Rejewski had written a \\"Report of Cryptologic Work on the German Enigma Machine Cipher\\" in 1942. Before his 1967 retirement, he began writing his \\"Memoirs of My Work in the Cipher Bureau of Section II of the [Polish] General Staff\\", which were purchased by the Polish Military Historical Institute, in Warsaw. Rejewski had often wondered what use Alan Turing (who in early 1940 had visited the Polish cryptologists at PC Bruno outside Paris) and the British at Bletchley Park had ultimately made of the Polish discoveries and inventions. For nearly three decades after the war, little was publicly known due to a ban imposed in 1945 by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. In a 1967 book W≈Çadys≈Çaw Kozaczuk, associated with the Military Historical Institute, disclosed Poland's breaking of the German Enigma ciphers. Until 1974, the scant information published concerning Enigma decryption attracted little attention. Ladislas Farago's 1971 best-seller The Game of the Foxes presented a garbled account of Ultra's origins: \\"Commander Denniston went clandestinely to a secluded Polish castle [sic] on the eve of the war [to pick up an Enigma, 'the Wehrmacht's top system' during World War II]. Dilly Knox later solved its keying [sic]...\\" Still, this was marginally closer to the truth than many British and American best-seller accounts that would follow after 1974. Their authors were at a disadvantage: they did not know that the founder of Enigma decryption, Rejewski, was still alive and alert, and that it was reckless to fabricate stories out of whole cloth. Rejewski's grave in PowƒÖzki Military Cemetery, Warsaw With Gustave Bertrand's 1973 publication of his Enigma, substantial information about the origins of Ultra began to seep out; and with F. W. Winterbotham's 1974 best-seller, The Ultra Secret, the dam began to burst. Still, many aspiring authors were not averse to filling gaps in their information with whole-cloth fabrications. Rejewski fought a gallant (if, into the 21st century, not entirely successful) fight to get the truth before the public. He published a number of papers on his cryptologic work and contributed generously to articles, books, and television programs. He was interviewed by scholars, journalists, and television crews from Poland, East Germany, the United States, Britain, Sweden, Belgium, the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and Brazil. Rejewski maintained a lively correspondence with his wartime French host, General Gustave Bertrand, and at the General's bidding he began translating Bertrand's Enigma into Polish. In 1976, at the request of the J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski Institute of America, Rejewski broke enciphered correspondence of J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski and his fellow Polish Socialist conspirators from 1904. On 12 August 1978 he received from a grateful Polish people the Officer's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta. Rejewski, who had been suffering from heart disease, died of a heart attack on 13 February 1980, aged 74, after returning home from a shopping trip. He was buried with military honors at Warsaw's PowƒÖzki Military Cemetery. Recognition R√≥≈ºycki, and Zygalski in front of Pozna≈Ñ Castle On 21 July 2000, Poland's President Aleksander Kwa≈õniewski posthumously awarded Poland's second-highest civilian decoration, the Grand Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta, to Marian Rejewski and Henryk Zygalski. In July 2005 Rejewski's daughter, Janina Sylwestrzak, received on his behalf the War Medal 1939‚Äì1945 from the British Chief of the Defence Staff. On 1 August 2012 Marian Rejewski posthumously received the Knowlton Award of the U.S. Military Intelligence Corps Association; his daughter Janina accepted the award at his home town, Bydgoszcz, on 4 September 2012. Rejewski had been nominated for the Award by NATO Allied Command Counterintelligence. In 2009, the Polish Post issued a series of four commemorative stamps, one of which pictured Rejewski and fellow mathematician-cryptologists Jerzy R√≥≈ºycki and Henryk Zygalski. On 5 August 2014 the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) honored Rejewski, R√≥≈ºycki, and Zygalski with its prestigious Milestone Award, which recognizes achievements that have changed the world. A three-sided bronze monument was dedicated in 2007 in front of the Imperial Castle in Pozna≈Ñ. Each side bears the name of one of the three Polish mathematicians who broke the Enigma cipher. Rejewski and colleagues were the heroes of Sekret Enigmy (The Enigma Secret), a thriller movie about the Poles' solution of the German Enigma cipher. Late 1980 also saw a Polish TV series with a similar theme, Tajemnice Enigmy (\\"The Secrets of Enigma\\").

Its headquarters were in Eschborn near Frankfurt. It is one of the few telecommunications companies in Germany to operate an ISDN network that is independent of the incumbent provider Deutsche Telekom. In 2008 Vodafone Germany had 2.1 million ADSL customers and 1.1 million ISDN customers. Arcor was the first German telecommunications provider to offer a flat rate tariff for ISDN phone lines.

It was created by the Sydney office of the London advertising agency M&C; Saatchi. The advertisements feature Australians preparing for visitors to their country. It begins in an Outback pub with the barkeeper saying, \\"We've poured you a beer\\". Further imagery to a similar effect is then shown, including a young boy on the beach saying, \\"We've got the sharks out of the pool,\\" and partygoers watching Sydney harbour fireworks saying, \\"We've turned on the lights\\". The commercial ends with bikini-clad model Lara Bingle at Fingal Spit stepping out of the ocean and asking, \\"So where the bloody hell are you?\\" The campaign received extensive press coverage both in Australia and overseas, particularly after it was banned in the United Kingdom. It enjoyed a mixed reception, being praised for its provocativeness and memorability but also being criticised as inappropriate for a tourism campaign. It was pulled in 2008, and brought Tourism in Australia down in key markets. Bans due to controversial language The advertising campaign caused controversy in March 2007 when it was banned by the Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre in the United Kingdom, which would not allow the word \\"bloody\\" in television versions of the commercial. Following lobbying by Tourism Australia, including a visit to the UK by Australia's tourism minister Fran Bailey and Lara Bingle, the ban was lifted, although a 9pm \\"watershed\\" was imposed on television commercials in May. In March 2007, the Advertising Standards Authority in the UK ordered the removal of roadside billboards bearing the slogan. The ASA stated that it had received 32 complaints and warned Tourism Australia to refrain from using profanity in future billboards. Tourism minister Fran Bailey responded: > \\"What an absolutely, incredibly ludicrous stance and a greater example of > double standards you'd never find. Everyone is shaking their heads, > especially as it's in a country where they allow the FCUK billboards. ... I > mean what is it about our campaign that they find offensive? I just don't > understand it.\\" The advertisement has also been banned by regulators in Canada, owing to the implication of \\"unbranded alcohol consumption\\" by the opening line, \\"We've poured you a beer\\". There was also concern in Canada at the word 'hell' being used as an expletive. It has been allowed to run with no adverse action in countries such as the United States and New Zealand. In Singapore, the advertisement campaign is presented as \\"So Where Are You?\\", with the words \\"bloody hell\\" removed. Parodies and influences Tony Blair, delivering a keynote speech during a visit to Canberra, said his first thought on arrival in Australia was \\"Where the bloody hell am I?\\" Australian comedy writer Dan Ilic produced and released a parody of the ad towards the end of March 2006. The parody uses the structure of the Tourism Australia ad to make satirical reference to current political controversies that might concern potential tourists. The parody was the subject of controversy when Ilic removed the ad from his company's web-site because Tourism Australia's lawyers had threatened legal action claiming the music \\"was infringing their copyright.\\" According to Ilic, however, Downwind Media \\"commissioned [their] own song that is different in tune and tempo.\\" As of 28 March 2006 four \\"new special edition versions\\" of the parody were made available for download. The Chaser's War on Everything released a similar version in their third episode with the slogan \\"So get your fucking arse over here!\\" to parody a perceived Australian propensity for vulgarity, and later took to the streets to see what tourists thought of similar campaigns which made extensive use of swearing. In New Zealand, the TVNZ series Facelift parodied Australia's treatment of Arabs (\\"we've kicked out all the dirty towelheads\\") and Aborigines (\\"we've sent the cops up north to steal their grog and porn mags\\") ending with the question \\"so if you're not a wog or a chink or some other dirty towelhead, where the bloody hell are you?\\" The Coromandel region also released a parody with the words, \\"We're bloody well in the Coromandel.\\" In the aftermath of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, British tabloid newspaper The Sun advertised posters aimed at Australians and asking \\"Where the bloody hell were you?\\" in reference to the number of gold medals Great Britain won in comparison to Australia. =Ashes version= An advertisement was produced to promote the Nine Network's television coverage of the 2006‚Äì07 Ashes series, in the style of this ad but on a cricketing theme (e.g., 'We've rolled the ground, we've put in the stumps'). The next sentence parodied the beer quote from the original ad but this time referencing the supposed English predilection for warm beer (\\"we've warmed up the beer\\"), then \\"we've hidden the sunscreen, and we've brought you some soap\\", and finally Australian captain Ricky Ponting descending the steps of a cricket ground stating, \\"And we've been waiting all year\\". This ad also culminates in a bikini-clad Bingle asking \\"So where the bloody hell are you?\\" on the Sydney Cricket Ground, holding a cricket bat and wearing nothing but a green and gold bikini, white shoes, and leg pads. A coda is then provided by Richie Benaud saying \\"Marvellous\\". Effectiveness of the campaign On 6 December 2006, News Limited newspapers around Australia drew attention to the campaign's shortcomings. The A$180 million campaign had hoped to attract visitors to Australia from Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom, but tourist figures show that during October 2006 the number of Japanese tourists visiting Australia fell by 5.7% in comparison with the same period in 2005. German tourists were down 4.7% and UK visitors dropped 2.3%, although there was a slight increase in tourists from the United States and also the People's Republic of China (where the advertisement was not screened). Critics argue that the expensive campaign failed to deliver the promised increase in tourist numbers, with then opposition tourism spokesperson Martin Ferguson saying \\"We've been told it was a huge success and generated all these hits on a website but the latest tourism figures show the numbers are down.\\" After calling the ads \\"great\\" at the time of their launch when he was in Opposition, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd subsequently stated: \\"That campaign, every place I have visited in the world, has been basically described as an absolute rolled gold disaster.\\"Sydney Morning Herald, 24 June 2008.

It was formed on 1 November 1956, following the passage of the States Reorganisation Act, by combining Malayalam-speaking regions of the erstwhile states of Travancore- Cochin and Madras. Spread over , Kerala is the twenty-first largest Indian state by area. It is bordered by Karnataka to the north and northeast, Tamil Nadu to the east and south, and the Lakshadweep Sea to the west. With 33,387,677 inhabitants as per the 2011 Census, Kerala is the thirteenth- largest Indian state by population. It is divided into 14 districts with the capital being Thiruvananthapuram. Malayalam is the most widely spoken language and is also the official language of the state. The Chera Dynasty was the first prominent kingdom based in Kerala. The Ay kingdom in the deep south and the Ezhimala kingdom in the north formed the other kingdoms in the early years of the Common Era (CE or AD). The region had been a prominent spice exporter since 3000 BCE. The region's prominence in trade was noted in the works of Pliny as well as the Periplus around 100 CE. In the 15th century, the spice trade attracted Portuguese traders to Kerala, and paved the way for European colonisation of India. At the time of Indian independence movement in the early 20th century, there were two major princely states in Kerala-Travancore State and the Kingdom of Cochin. They united to form the state of Thiru-Kochi in 1949. The Malabar region, in the northern part of Kerala, had been a part of the Madras province of British India, which later became a part of the Madras State post-independence. After the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, the modern-day state of Kerala was formed by merging the Malabar district of Madras State (excluding Gudalur taluk of Nilgiris district, Topslip, the Attappadi Forest east of Anakatti), the state of Thiru-Kochi (excluding four southern taluks of Kanyakumari district, Shenkottai and Tenkasi taluks), and the taluk of Kasaragod (now Kasaragod District) in South Canara (Tulunad) which was a part of Madras State. The economy of Kerala is the 10th-largest in India with in gross state domestic product (GSDP) and a per capita GSDP of . Kerala has the lowest positive population growth rate in India, 3.44%; the highest Human Development Index (HDI), 0.784 in 2018 (0.712 in 2015); the highest literacy rate, 96.2% in the 2018 literacy survey conducted by the National Statistical Office, India; the highest life expectancy, 77 years; and the highest sex ratio, 1,084 women per 1,000 men. The state has witnessed significant emigration, especially to the Arab states of the Persian Gulf during the Gulf Boom of the 1970s and early 1980s, and its economy depends significantly on remittances from a large Malayali expatriate community. Hinduism is practised by more than half of the population, followed by Islam and Christianity. The culture is a synthesis of Aryan, Dravidian, Arab, and European cultures, developed over millennia, under influences from other parts of India and abroad. The production of pepper and natural rubber contributes significantly to the total national output. In the agricultural sector, coconut, tea, coffee, cashew and spices are important. The state's coastline extends for , and around 1.1 million people in the state are dependent on the fishery industry which contributes 3% to the state's income. The state has the highest media exposure in India with newspapers publishing in nine languages, mainly English and Malayalam. Kerala is one of the prominent tourist destinations of India, with backwaters, hill stations, beaches, Ayurvedic tourism and tropical greenery as its major attractions. Etymology The name Kerala has an uncertain etymology. One folk etymology derives Kerala from the Malayalam word 'coconut tree' and 'land'; thus, 'land of coconuts', which is a nickname for the state used by locals due to the abundance of coconut trees. The word Kerala is first recorded as Ketalaputo ('son of Chera[s]') in a 3rd- century BCE rock inscription left by the Maurya emperor Ashoka (274‚Äì237 BCE), one of his edicts pertaining to welfare. This contradicts the theory that is from 'coconut tree'. At that time, one of three states in the region was called in Classical Tamil: and are variants of the same word. The word refers to the oldest known dynasty of Kerala kings and is derived from the Proto- Tamil-Malayalam word for 'lake'. The earliest Sanskrit text to mention Kerala as Cherapadha is the late Vedic text Aitareya Aranyaka. Kerala is also mentioned in the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the two Hindu epics. The Skanda Purana mentions the ecclesiastical office of the Thachudaya Kaimal who is referred to as , synonymous with the deity of the Koodalmanikyam temple.See Sahyadri Kanda Chapter 7 in Skanda Purana. Rocher, Ludo (1986). The Puranas. Otto Harrassowitz Verlag. .Who's Who in Madras 1934 may stem from the Classical Tamil 'declivity of a hill or a mountain slope' or 'land of the Cheras'. The Greco-Roman trade map Periplus Maris Erythraei refers to Kerala as Celobotra. History =Mythology= Portrait of Parashurama by Raja Ravi Varma relating to Keralolpathi. According to the Sangam classic Purananuru, the Chera king Senkuttuvan conquered the lands between Kanyakumari and the Himalayas. Lacking worthy enemies, he besieged the sea by throwing his spear into it.P. 204 Ancient Indian History By Madhavan Arjunan Pillai According to the 17th century Malayalam work Keralolpathi, the lands of Kerala were recovered from the sea by the axe-wielding warrior sage Parasurama, the sixth avatar of Vishnu (hence, Kerala is also called Parasurama Kshetram 'The Land of Parasurama'S.C. Bhatt, Gopal K. Bhargava (2006) \\"Land and People of Indian States and Union Territories: Volume 14.\\", p.18). Parasurama threw his axe across the sea, and the water receded as far as it reached. According to legend, this new area of land extended from Gokarna to Kanyakumari. The land which rose from sea was filled with salt and unsuitable for habitation; so Parasurama invoked the Snake King Vasuki, who spat holy poison and converted the soil into fertile lush green land. Out of respect, Vasuki and all snakes were appointed as protectors and guardians of the land. P. T. Srinivasa Iyengar theorised, that Senguttuvan may have been inspired by the Parasurama legend, which was brought by early Aryan settlers. Another much earlier Puranic character associated with Kerala is Mahabali, an Asura and a prototypical just king, who ruled the earth from Kerala. He won the war against the Devas, driving them into exile. The Devas pleaded before Lord Vishnu, who took his fifth incarnation as Vamana and pushed Mahabali down to netherworld to placate the Devas. There is a belief that, once a year during the Onam festival, Mahabali returns to Kerala. The Matsya Purana, among the oldest of the 18 Puranas, uses the Malaya Mountains of Kerala (and Tamil Nadu) as the setting for the story of Matsya, the first incarnation of Vishnu, and Manu, the first man and the king of the region. =Pre-history= A substantial portion of Kerala may have been under the sea in ancient times. Marine fossils have been found in an area near Changanacherry, thus supporting the hypothesis. Pre-historical archaeological findings include dolmens of the Neolithic era in the Marayur area of the Idukki district. They are locally known as \\"muniyara\\", derived from muni (hermit or sage) and ara (dolmen). Rock engravings in the Edakkal Caves, in Wayanad date back to the Neolithic era around 6000 BCE. Archaeological studies have identified Mesolithic, Neolithic and Megalithic sites in Kerala. The studies point to the development of ancient Kerala society and its culture beginning from the Paleolithic Age, through the Mesolithic, Neolithic and Megalithic Ages. Foreign cultural contacts have assisted this cultural formation; historians suggest a possible relationship with Indus Valley Civilization during the late Bronze Age and early Iron Age. =Ancient period= Ancient right Kerala has been a major spice exporter since 3000 BCE, according to Sumerian records and it is still referred to as the \\"Garden of Spices\\" or as the \\"Spice Garden of India\\". Kerala's spices attracted ancient Babylonians, Assyrians and Egyptians to the Malabar Coast in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BCE. Phoenicians established trade with Kerala during this period. The Land of Keralaputra was one of the four independent kingdoms in southern India during Ashoka's time, the others being Chola, Pandya, and Satiyaputra. Scholars hold that Keralaputra is an alternate name of the Cheras, the first dominant dynasty based in Kerala. These territories once shared a common language and culture, within an area known as Tamilakam. Along with the Ay kingdom in the south and the Ezhimala kingdom in the north, the Cheras formed the ruling kingdoms of Kerala in the early years of the Common Era (CE). It is noted in Sangam literature that the Chera king Uthiyan Cheralathan ruled most of modern Kerala from his capital in Kuttanad, and controlled the port of Muziris, but its southern tip was in the kingdom of Pandyas, which had a trading port sometimes identified in ancient Western sources as Nelcynda (or Neacyndi) in Quilon. The lesser known Ays and Mushikas kingdoms lay to the south and north of the Chera regions respectively. In the last centuries BCE the coast became important to the Greeks and Romans for its spices, especially black pepper. The Cheras had trading links with China, West Asia, Egypt, Greece, and the Roman Empire.Cyclopaedia of India and of Eastern and Southern Asia. Ed. by Edward Balfour (1871), Second Edition. Volume 2. p. 584. In foreign-trade circles the region was known as Male or Malabar. Muziris, Berkarai, and Nelcynda were among the principal ports at that time. The value of Rome's annual trade with the region was estimated at around 50,000,000 sesterces;According to Pliny the Elder, goods from India were sold in the Empire at 100 times their original purchase price. See contemporary Sangam literature describes Roman ships coming to Muziris in Kerala, laden with gold to exchange for pepper. One of the earliest western traders to use the monsoon winds to reach Kerala was Eudoxus of Cyzicus, around 118 or 166 BCE, under the patronage of Ptolemy VIII, king of the Hellenistic Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt. Roman establishments in the port cities of the region, such as a temple of Augustus and barracks for garrisoned Roman soldiers, are marked in the Tabula Peutingeriana, the only surviving map of the Roman cursus publicus. Merchants from West Asia and Southern Europe established coastal posts and settlements in Kerala. The Israeli (Jewish) connection with Kerala started in 573 BCE.The Israelis (Jews) of India: A Story of Three Communities by Orpa Slapak. The Israel Museum, Jerusalem. 2003. p. 27. . Arabs also had trade links with Kerala, starting before the 4th century BCE, as Herodotus (484‚Äì413 BCE) noted that goods brought by Arabs from Kerala were sold to the Israelis [Hebrew (Jews)] at Eden. In the 4th century, the Knanaya or Southist Christians also migrated from Persia and lived alongside the early Syriac Christian community known as the St. Thomas Christians who trace their origins to the evangelistic activity of Thomas the Apostle in the 1st century.The Encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 5 by Erwin Fahlbusch. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing ‚Äì 2008. p. 285. . Mappila was an honorific title that had been assigned to respected visitors from abroad; Israelite (Jewish), Syrian Christian, and Muslim immigration account for later names of the respective communities: Juda Mappilas, Nasrani Mappilas and Muslim Mappilas.* Bindu Malieckal (2005) Muslims, Matriliny, and A Midsummer Night's Dream: European Encounters with the Mappilas of Malabar, India; The Muslim World Volume 95 Issue 2 The earliest Saint Thomas Christian Churches, Cheraman Jumu'ah Masjid (traditionally dated to \\"629 CE\\" by the Mappilas)‚Äîregarded as \\"the first mosque of India\\"‚Äîand Paradesi Synagogue (1568 CE)‚Äîthe oldest active synagogue in the Commonwealth of Nations‚Äîwere built in Kerala. =Early medieval period= Tharisapalli plates granted to Saint Thomas Christians by Chera ruler Sthanu Ravi Varma, testified about merchant guilds and trade corporations during the Kulasekhara period. Namboothiri Brahmins migrated to Kerala during the early Middle Ages. Apart from introducing the caste system, they also changed the socio-economic life of the people by commissioning new religious centres. A second Chera Kingdom (c. 800‚Äì1102), also known as Kulasekhara dynasty of Mahodayapuram (present-day Kodungallur), was established by Kulasekhara Varman, which ruled over a territory comprising the whole of modern Kerala and a smaller part of modern Tamil Nadu. During the early part of the Kulasekara period, the southern region from Nagercoil to Thiruvalla was ruled by Ay kings, who lost their power in the 10th century, making the region a part of the Kulasekara empire. Under Kulasekhara rule, Kerala witnessed a developing period of art, literature, trade and the Bhakti movement of Hinduism. A Keralite identity, distinct from the Tamils, became linguistically separate during this period around the seventh century. For local administration, the empire was divided into provinces under the rule of Naduvazhis, with each province comprising a number of Desams under the control of chieftains, called as Desavazhis. The inhibitions, caused by a series of Chera-Chola wars in the 11th century, resulted in the decline of foreign trade in Kerala ports. In addition, Portuguese invasions in the 15th century caused two major religions, Buddhism and Jainism, to disappear from the land. It is known that the Menons in the Malabar region of Kerala were originally strong believers of Jainism. The social system became fractured with divisions on caste lines. Finally, the Kulasekhara dynasty was subjugated in 1102 by the combined attack of Later Pandyas and Later Cholas. However, in the 14th century, Ravi Varma Kulashekhara (1299‚Äì1314) of the southern Venad kingdom was able to establish a short-lived supremacy over southern India. After his death, in the absence of a strong central power, the state was divided into thirty small warring principalities; the most powerful of them were the kingdom of Samuthiri in the north, Venad in the south and Kochi in the middle. In the 18th Century, Travancore King Sree Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma annexed all the kingdoms up to Northern Kerala through military conquests, resulting in the rise of Travancore to pre-eminence in Kerala.The Kochi ruler sued for peace with Anizham Thirunal and Malabar came under direct British rule until India became independent. =Colonial era= Vasco da Gama's arrival in Calicut in 1498 ushered in six centuries of rule of the Portuguese Empire in India (Portuguese India), lasting until 1961. British Residency in Asramam, Kollam The maritime spice trade monopoly in the Indian Ocean (Indu Maha Samundr) stayed with the Arabs during the High and Late Middle Ages. However, the dominance of Middle East traders was challenged in the European Age of Discovery. After Vasco Da Gama's arrival in Kappad Kozhikode in 1498, the Portuguese began to dominate eastern shipping, and the spice-trade in particular. They established a trading center at Tangasseri in Quilon during 1502 as per the invitation of the then Queen of Quilon to start spices trade from there. The Zamorin of Kozhikode permitted the new visitors to trade with his subjects such that Portuguese trade in Kozhikode prospered with the establishment of a factory and a fort. However, Portuguese attacks on Arab properties in his jurisdiction provoked the Zamorin and led to conflicts between them. The Portuguese took advantage of the rivalry between the Zamorin and the King of Kochi allied with Kochi. When Francisco de Almeida was appointed as Viceroy of Portuguese India in 1505, his headquarters was established at Fort Kochi (Fort Emmanuel) rather than in Kozhikode. During his reign, the Portuguese managed to dominate relations with Kochi and established a few fortresses on the Malabar Coast. Fort St Angelo or St. Angelo Fort was built at Kannur in 1505 and Fort St Thomas was built at Kollam(Quilon) in 1518 by the Portuguese. However, the Portuguese suffered setbacks from attacks by Zamorin forces in Malabar region; especially from naval attacks under the leadership of Kozhikode admirals known as Kunjali Marakkars, which compelled them to seek a treaty. An insurrection at the Port of Quilon between the Arabs and the Portuguese led to the end of the Portuguese era in Quilon. In 1571, the Portuguese were defeated by the Zamorin forces in the battle at Chaliyam Fort. The Portuguese were ousted by the Dutch East India Company, who during the conflicts between the Kozhikode and the Kochi, gained control of the trade. They lost to Dutch at Quilon after 1661 and later, the Portuguese left south-western coast. The Dutch in turn were weakened by constant battles with Marthanda Varma of the Travancore Royal Family, and were defeated at the Battle of Colachel in 1741. An agreement, known as \\"Treaty of Mavelikkara\\", was signed by the Dutch and Travancore in 1753, according to which the Dutch were compelled to detach from all political involvement in the region. Marthanda Varma annexed northern kingdoms through military conquests, resulting in the rise of Travancore to a position of preeminence in Kerala. Kowdiar Palace, Trivandrum In 1766, Hyder Ali, the ruler of Mysore invaded northern Kerala. His son and successor, Tipu Sultan, launched campaigns against the expanding British East India Company, resulting in two of the four Anglo-Mysore Wars. Tipu ultimately ceded the Malabar District and South Kanara to the company in the 1790s; both were annexed to the Madras Presidency of British India in 1792. The company forged tributary alliances with Kochi in 1791 and Travancore in 1795. By the end of 18th century, the whole of Kerala fell under the control of the British, either administered directly or under suzerainty. There were major revolts in Kerala during the independence movement in the 20th century; most notable among them is the 1921 Malabar Rebellion and the social struggles in Travancore. In the Malabar Rebellion, Mappila Muslims of Malabar rioted against Hindu zamindars and the British Raj. Some social struggles against caste inequalities also erupted in the early decades of 20th century, leading to the 1936 Temple Entry Proclamation that opened Hindu temples in Travancore to all castes. =Post-colonial period= After India was partitioned in 1947 into India and Pakistan, Travancore and Kochi, part of the Union of India were merged on 1 July 1949 to form Travancore-Cochin. On 1 November 1956, the taluk of Kasargod in the South Kanara district of Madras, the Malabar district of Madras, and Travancore- Cochin, without four southern taluks (which joined Tamil Nadu), merged to form the state of Kerala under the States Reorganisation Act. A Communist-led government under E. M. S. Namboodiripad resulted from the first elections for the new Kerala Legislative Assembly in 1957. It was one of the earliest elected Communist governments, after Communist success in the 1945 elections in the Republic of San Marino. His government helped distribute land and implement educational reforms. Geography The state is wedged between the Lakshadweep Sea and the Western Ghats. Lying between northern latitudes 8¬∞18' and 12¬∞48' and eastern longitudes 74¬∞52' and 77¬∞22', Kerala experiences humid tropical rainforest climate with some cyclones. The state has a coast of and the width of the state varies between . Geographically, Kerala can be divided into three climatically distinct regions: the eastern highlands; rugged and cool mountainous terrain, the central mid-lands; rolling hills, and the western lowlands; coastal plains. Pre-Cambrian and Pleistocene geological formations compose the bulk of Kerala's terrain. A catastrophic flood in Kerala in 1341 CE drastically modified its terrain and consequently affected its history; it also created a natural harbour for spice transport. The eastern region of Kerala consists of high mountains, gorges and deep-cut valleys immediately west of the Western Ghats' rain shadow. 41 of Kerala's west-flowing rivers, and 3 of its east-flowing ones originate in this region. The Western Ghats form a wall of mountains interrupted only near Palakkad; hence also known Palghat, where the Palakkad Gap breaks. The Western Ghats rise on average to above sea level, while the highest peaks reach around . Anamudi in the Idukki district is the highest peak in south India, is at an elevation of . The Western Ghats mountain chain is recognised as one of the world's eight \\"hottest hotspots\\" of biological diversity and is listed among UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The chain's forests are considered to be older than the Himalaya mountains. Kerala's western coastal belt is relatively flat compared to the eastern region, and is criss-crossed by a network of interconnected brackish canals, lakes, estuaries, and rivers known as the Kerala Backwaters. The state's largest lake Vembanad, dominates the backwaters; it lies between Alappuzha and Kochi and is about in area. Around eight percent of India's waterways are found in Kerala. Kerala's 44 rivers include the Periyar; , Bharathapuzha; , Pamba; , Chaliyar; , Kadalundipuzha; , Chalakudipuzha; , Valapattanam; and the Achankovil River; . The average length of the rivers is . Many of the rivers are small and entirely fed by monsoon rain. As Kerala's rivers are small and lacking in delta, they are more prone to environmental effects. The rivers face problems such as sand mining and pollution.Padmalal D, Maya K, Sreebha S & Sreeja R, 2007, Environmental effects of river sand mining: a case from the river catchments of Vembanad lake, Southwest coast of India, Environmental Geology 54(4), 879‚Äì889. springerlink.com. Retrieved 17 July 2009. The state experiences several natural hazards like landslides, floods and droughts. The state was also affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, and in 2018 received the worst flooding in nearly a century. =Climate= With around 120‚Äì140 rainy days per year, Kerala has a wet and maritime tropical climate influenced by the seasonal heavy rains of the southwest summer monsoon and northeast winter monsoon. Around 65% of the rainfall occurs from June to August corresponding to the Southwest monsoon, and the rest from September to December corresponding to Northeast monsoon. The moisture-laden winds of the Southwest monsoon, on reaching the southernmost point of the Indian Peninsula, because of its topography, divides into two branches; the \\"Arabian Sea Branch\\" and the \\"Bay of Bengal Branch\\". The \\"Arabian Sea Branch\\" of the Southwest monsoon first hits the Western Ghats, making Kerala the first state in India to receive rain from the Southwest monsoon. The distribution of pressure patterns is reversed in the Northeast monsoon, during this season the cold winds from North India pick up moisture from the Bay of Bengal and precipitate it on the east coast of peninsular India. In Kerala, the influence of the Northeast monsoon is seen in southern districts only. Kerala's rainfall averages 2,923 mm (115 in) annually. Some of Kerala's drier lowland regions average only 1,250 mm (49 in); the mountains of the eastern Idukki district receive more than 5,000 mm (197 in) of orographic precipitation: the highest in the state. In eastern Kerala, a drier tropical wet and dry climate prevails. During the summer, the state is prone to gale-force winds, storm surges, cyclone-related torrential downpours, occasional droughts, and rises in sea level. The mean daily temperature ranges from 19.8 ¬∞C to 36.7 ¬∞C. Mean annual temperatures range from 25.0‚Äì27.5 ¬∞C in the coastal lowlands to 20.0‚Äì22.5 ¬∞C in the eastern highlands. Flora and fauna Most of the biodiversity is concentrated and protected in the Western Ghats. Three quarters of the land area of Kerala was under thick forest up to 18th century. , over 25% of India's 15,000 plant species are in Kerala. Out of the 4,000 flowering plant species; 1,272 of which are endemic to Kerala, 900 are medicinal, and 159 are threatened. Its 9,400 km2 of forests include tropical wet evergreen and semi-evergreen forests (lower and middle elevations‚Äî3,470 km2), tropical moist and dry deciduous forests (mid-elevations‚Äî4,100 km2 and 100 km2, respectively), and montane subtropical and temperate (shola) forests (highest elevations‚Äî100 km2). Altogether, 24% of Kerala is forested. Three of the world's Ramsar Convention listed wetlands‚ÄîLake Sasthamkotta, Ashtamudi Lake and the Vembanad-Kol wetlands‚Äîare in Kerala, as well as 1455.4 km2 of the vast Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. Subjected to extensive clearing for cultivation in the 20th century, much of the remaining forest cover is now protected from clearfelling. Eastern Kerala's windward mountains shelter tropical moist forests and tropical dry forests, which are common in the Western Ghats. The world's oldest teak plantation 'Conolly's Plot' is in Nilambur.World's oldest teak trees dying in Kerala Kerala's fauna are notable for their diversity and high rates of endemism: it includes 118 species of mammals (1 endemic), 500 species of birds, 189 species of freshwater fish, 173 species of reptiles (10 of them endemic), and 151 species of amphibians (36 endemic).A checklist of the vertebrates of Kerala State, India  Nameer  Journal of Threatened Taxa These are threatened by extensive habitat destruction, including soil erosion, landslides, salinisation, and resource extraction. In the forests, sonokeling, Dalbergia latifolia, anjili, mullumurikku, Erythrina, and Cassia number among the more than 1,000 species of trees in Kerala. Other plants include bamboo, wild black pepper, wild cardamom, the calamus rattan palm, and aromatic vetiver grass, Vetiveria zizanioides. Indian elephant, Bengal tiger, Indian leopard, Nilgiri tahr, common palm civet, and grizzled giant squirrels are also found in the forests. Reptiles include the king cobra, viper, python, and mugger crocodile. Kerala's birds include the Malabar trogon, the great hornbill, Kerala laughingthrush, darter and southern hill myna. In the lakes, wetlands, and waterways, fish such as Kadu, Red Line Torpedo Barb and choottachi; orange chromide‚ÄîEtroplus maculatus are found. Subdivisions Administrative Subdivisions The state's 14 districts are distributed among six regions: North Malabar (far-north Kerala), South Malabar (north-central Kerala), Kochi (central Kerala), Northern Travancore, Central Travancore (southern Kerala) and Southern Travancore (far-south Kerala). The districts which serve as administrative regions for taxation purposes are further subdivided into 27 revenue subdivisions and 77 taluks, which have fiscal and administrative powers over settlements within their borders, including maintenance of local land records. Kerala's taluks are further sub-divided into 1,674 revenue villages. https://ildm.kerala.gov.in/wp- content/uploads/2018/01/Revenue-Guide-2018.pdf Since the 73rd and 74th amendments to the Constitution of India, the local government institutions function as the third tier of government, which constitutes 14 District Panchayats, 152 Block Panchayats, 941 Grama Panchayats, 87 Municipalities, six Municipal Corporations and one Township. Mah√©, a part of the Indian union territory of Puducherry, though away from it, is a coastal exclave surrounded by Kerala on all of its landward approaches. The Kannur District surrounds Mah√© on three sides with the Kozhikode District on the fourth. There are six Municipal corporations in Kerala that govern Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Kochi, Thrissur, Kozhikode and Kannur. The Thiruvananthapuram Municipal Corporation is the largest corporation in Kerala while Kochi metropolitan area named Kochi UA is the largest urban agglomeration. According to a survey by economics research firm Indicus Analytics in 2007, Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Kozhikode, Thrissur, Kochi are among the \\"best cities in India to live\\"; the survey used parameters such as health, education, environment, safety, public facilities and entertainment to rank the cities. Government and administration Kerala hosts two major political alliances: the United Democratic Front (UDF), led by the Indian National Congress; and the Left Democratic Front (LDF), led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)). , the LDF is the ruling coalition; Pinarayi Vijayan of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) is the Chief Minister, while Ramesh Chennithala of the UDF is the Leader of Opposition. According to the Constitution of India, Kerala has a parliamentary system of representative democracy; universal suffrage is granted to residents. The government is organised into the three branches: # Legislature: The unicameral legislature, the Kerala Legislative Assembly popularly known as Niyamasabha, comprises elected members and special office bearers; the Speaker and Deputy Speaker elected by the members from among themselves. Assembly meetings are presided over by the Speaker and in the Speaker's absence, by the Deputy Speaker. The state has 140 assembly constituencies. The state elects 20 and 9 members for representation in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha respectively. # Executive: The Governor of Kerala is the constitutional head of state, and is appointed by the President of India. Arif Mohammad Khan is the Governor of Kerala. The executive authority is headed by the Chief Minister of Kerala, who is the head of government and is vested with extensive executive powers; the head of the majority party in the Legislative Assembly is appointed to the post by the Governor. The Council of Ministers has its members appointed by the Governor, taking the advice of the Chief Minister. The executive administration is based in Thiruvananthapuram at State Secretariat complex. Each district has a district administrator appointed by government called District collector for executive administration. Auxiliary authorities known as panchayats, for which local body elections are regularly held, govern local affairs. # Judiciary: The judiciary consists of the Kerala High Court and a system of lower courts. The High Court, located in Kochi, has a Chief Justice along with 23 permanent and seven additional pro tempore justices . The high court also hears cases from the Union Territory of Lakshadweep. The local government bodies; Panchayat, Municipalities and Corporations have existed in Kerala since 1959, however, the major initiative to decentralise the governance was started in 1993, conforming to the constitutional amendments of central government in this direction. With the enactment of Kerala Panchayati Raj Act and Kerala Municipality Act in 1994, the state implemented reforms in local self- governance. The Kerala Panchayati Raj Act envisages a 3-tier system of local government with Gram panchayat, Block panchayat and District Panchayat forming a hierarchy. The acts ensure a clear demarcation of power among these institutions. However, the Kerala Municipality Act envisages a single-tier system for urban areas, with the institution of municipality designed to par with the Gram panchayat of the former system. Substantial administrative, legal and financial powers are delegated to these bodies to ensure efficient decentralisation. As per the present norms, the state government devolves about 40 per cent of the state plan outlay to the local government. Economy After independence, the state was managed as a democratic socialist welfare economy. From the 1990s, liberalisation of the mixed economy allowed Licence Raj restrictions against capitalism and foreign direct investment to be lightened, leading to economic expansion and an increase in employment. In the fiscal year 2007‚Äì2008, the nominal gross state domestic product (GSDP) was . GSDP growth; 9.2% in 2004‚Äì2005 and 7.4% in 2003‚Äì2004 had been high compared to an average of 2.3% annually in the 1980s and between 5.1% and 5.99% in the 1990s. The state recorded 8.93% growth in enterprises from 1998 to 2005, higher than the national rate of 4.80%. The \\"Kerala phenomenon\\" or \\"Kerala model of development\\" of very high human development and in comparison low economic development has resulted from a strong service sector. Kerala's economy depends on emigrants working in foreign countries, mainly in Arab states of the Persian Gulf, and the remittances annually contribute more than a fifth of GSDP. The state witnessed significant emigration during the Gulf Boom of the 1970s and early 1980s. In 2008, the Persian Gulf countries together had a Keralite population of more than 2.5 million, who sent home annually a sum of 6.81 billion, which is the highest among Indian states and more than 15.13% of remittances to India in 2008. In 2012, Kerala still received the highest remittances of all states: US$11.3 billion, which was nearly 16% of the US$71 billion remittances to the country. In 2015, NRI deposits in Kerala have soared to over , amounting to one-sixth of all the money deposited in NRI accounts, which comes to about . However, a study commissioned by the Kerala State Planning Board, suggested that the state look for other reliable sources of income, instead of relying on remittances to finance its expenditure. According to a study done in 2013, was the total amount paid to migrant labourers in the state every year. The tertiary sector comprises services such as transport, storage, communications, tourism, banking, insurance and real estate. In 2011‚Äì2012, it contributed 63.22% of the state's GDP, agriculture and allied sectors contributed 15.73%, while manufacturing, construction and utilities contributed 21.05%. Nearly half of Kerala's people depend on agriculture alone for income. Around 600 varieties of rice, which is Kerala's most used staple and cereal crop, are harvested from 3105.21 km2; a decline from 5883.4 km2 in 1990. 688,859 tonnes of rice are produced per year. Other key crops include coconut; 899,198 ha, tea, coffee; 23% of Indian production, or 57,000 tonnes, rubber, cashews, and spices‚Äîincluding pepper, cardamom, vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Traditional industries manufacturing items; coir, handlooms, and handicrafts employ around one million people. Kerala supplies 60% of the total global produce of white coir fibre. India's first coir factory was set up in Alleppey in 1859‚Äì60. The Central Coir Research Institute was established there in 1959. As per the 2006‚Äì2007 census by SIDBI, there are 1,468,104 micro, small and medium enterprises in Kerala employing 3,031,272 people. The KSIDC has promoted more than 650 medium and large manufacturing firms in Kerala, creating employment for 72,500 people. A mining sector of 0.3% of GSDP involves extraction of ilmenite, kaolin, bauxite, silica, quartz, rutile, zircon, and sillimanite. Other major sectors are tourism, manufacturing, home gardens, animal husbandry and business process outsourcing. As of March 2002, Kerala's banking sector comprised 3341 local branches: each branch served 10,000 people, lower than the national average of 16,000; the state has the third-highest bank penetration among Indian states. On 1 October 2011, Kerala became the first state in the country to have at least one banking facility in every village. Unemployment in 2007 was estimated at 9.4%; chronic issues are underemployment, low employability of youth, and a low female labour participation rate of only 13.5%, as was the practice of Nokku kooli, \\"wages for looking on\\". (On 30 April 2018, the Kerala state government issued an order to abolish nokku kooli, to take effect on 1 May.) By 1999‚Äì2000, the rural and urban poverty rates dropped to 10.0% and 9.6% respectively. Kerala has focused more attention towards growth of Information Technology sector with formation of Technopark, Thiruvananthapuram which is one of the largest IT employer in Kerala. It was the first technology park in India and with the inauguration of the Thejaswini complex on 22 February 2007, Technopark became the largest IT Park in India. Software giants like Infosys, Oracle, Tata Consultancy Services, Capgemini, HCL, UST Global, NeST and Suntec have offices in the state. The state has a second major IT hub, the Infopark centred in Kochi with \\"spokes\\"(it acts as the \\"hub\\") in Thrissur and Alleppy. , Infopark generates one-third of total IT Revenues of the state with key offices of IT majors like Tata Consultancy Services, Cognizant, Wipro, UST Global, IBS Software Services etc. and Multinational corporations like KPMG, Ernst & Young, EXL Service, Etisalat DB Telecom, Nielsen Audio, Xerox ACS, Tata ELXSI etc. Kochi also has another major project SmartCity under construction, built in partnership with Dubai Government. A third major IT Hub is under construction centred around Kozhikode known as Cyberpark. The Grand Kerala Shopping Festival (GKSF) was started in 2007, covering more than 3000 outlets across the nine cities of Kerala with huge tax discounts, VAT refunds and huge array of prizes. Coconuts are an important regional cash crop. The state's budget of 2012‚Äì2013 was . The state government's tax revenues (excluding the shares from Union tax pool) amounted to in 2010‚Äì2011; up from in 2009‚Äì2010. Its non-tax revenues (excluding the shares from Union tax pool) of the Government of Kerala reached in 2010‚Äì2011. However, Kerala's high ratio of taxation to GSDP has not alleviated chronic budget deficits and unsustainable levels of government debt, which have impacted social services. A record total of 223 hartals were observed in 2006, resulting in a revenue loss of over .Kerala: Hartals Own Country? 6 July 2008 Kerala's 10% rise in GDP is 3% more than the national GDP. In 2013, capital expenditure rose 30% compared to the national average of 5%, owners of two-wheelers rose by 35% compared to the national rate of 15%, and the teacher-pupil ratio rose 50% from 2:100 to 4:100. In November 2015, the Ministry of Urban Development selected seven cities of Kerala for a comprehensive development program known as the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT). A package of was declared for each of the cities to develop service level improvement plan (SLIP), a plan for better functioning of the local urban bodies in the cities of Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Alappuzha, Kochi, Thrissur, Kozhikode, and Palakkad. =Agriculture= Jackfruits are the state fruit, and are a cultural icon of Kerala. The major change in agriculture in Kerala occurred in the 1970s when production of rice fell due to increased availability of rice all over India and decreased availability of labour. Consequently, investment in rice production decreased and a major portion of the land shifted to the cultivation of perennial tree crops and seasonal crops. Profitability of crops fell due to a shortage of farm labour, the high price of land, and the uneconomic size of operational holdings. Kerala produces 97% of the national output of black pepper and accounts for 85% of the natural rubber in the country. Coconut, tea, coffee, cashew, and spices‚Äîincluding cardamom, vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg are the main agricultural products. 80% of India's export quality cashew kernels are prepared in Kollam. The key agricultural staple is rice, with varieties grown in extensive paddy fields. Home gardens made up a significant portion of the agricultural sector. Related animal husbandry is touted by proponents as a means of alleviating rural poverty and unemployment among women, the marginalised, and the landless. The state government promotes these activities via educational campaigns and the development of new cattle breeds such as the Sunandini. Though the contribution of agricultural sector to the state economy was on the decline in 2012‚Äì13, through the strength of the allied livestock sector, it has picked up from 7.03% (2011‚Äì12) to 7.2%. In the 2013‚Äì14 fiscal period, the contribution has been estimated at a high of 7.75%. The total growth of the farm sector has recorded a 4.39% increase in 2012‚Äì13, over a paltry 1.3% growth in the previous fiscal year. The agricultural sector has a share of 9.34% in the sectoral distribution of Gross State Domestic Product at Constant Price, while the secondary and tertiary sectors has contributed 23.94% and 66.72% respectively. There is a preference for organic products and home farming compared to synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. =Fisheries= Cheena vala (Chinese fishing net) With of coastal belt, 400,000 hectares of inland water resources and approximately 220,000 active fishermen, Kerala is one of the leading producers of fish in India. According to 2003‚Äì04 reports, about 1.1 million people earn their livelihood from fishing and allied activities such as drying, processing, packaging, exporting and transporting fisheries. The annual yield of the sector was estimated as 608,000 tons in 2003‚Äì04. This contributes to about 3% of the total economy of the state. In 2006, around 22% of the total Indian marine fishery yield was from Kerala. During the southwest monsoon, a suspended mud bank develops along the shore, which in turn leads to calm ocean water, peaking the output of the fishing industry. This phenomenon is locally called chakara. The waters provide a large variety of fish: pelagic species; 59%, demersal species; 23%, crustaceans, molluscs and others for 18%. Around 1.050 million fishermen haul an annual catch of 668,000 tonnes as of a 1999‚Äì2000 estimate; 222 fishing villages are strung along the coast. Another 113 fishing villages dot the hinterland. Kerala's coastal belt of Karunagappally is known for high background radiation from thorium-containing monazite sand. In some coastal panchayats, median outdoor radiation levels are more than 4 mGy/yr and, in certain locations on the coast, it is as high as 70 mGy/yr. Transportation =Roads= NH 544 Six lane Thrissur ‚Äì Vadakkencherry Kerala has of roads, which accounts for 4.2% of India's total. This translates to about of road per thousand people, compared to an average of in the country. Roads in Kerala include of national highway; 2.6% of the nation's total, of state highway and of district roads. Most of Kerala's west coast is accessible through the NH 66 (previously NH 17 and 47); and the eastern side is accessible through state highways. New projects for hill and coastal highways were recently announced under KIIFB. National Highway 66, with the longest stretch of road () connects Kanyakumari to Mumbai; it enters Kerala via Talapady in Kasargod and passes through Kannur, Kozhikode, Malappuram, Guruvayur, Kochi, Alappuzha, Kollam, Thiruvananthapuram before entering Tamil Nadu. Palakkad district is generally referred to as the Gateway of Kerala, due to the presence of the Palakkad Gap in the Western Ghats, through which the northern (Malabar) and southern (Travancore) parts of Kerala are connected to the rest of India via road and rail. The state's largest checkpoint, Walayar, is on NH 544, in the border town between Kerala and Tamil Nadu, through which a large amount of public and commercial transportation reaches the northern and central districts of Kerala. A panoramic view of Vyttila Mobility Hub integrated transit terminal in the city of Kochi The Department of Public Works is responsible for maintaining and expanding the state highways system and major district roads. The Kerala State Transport Project (KSTP), which includes the GIS-based Road Information and Management Project (RIMS), is responsible for maintaining and expanding the state highways in Kerala. It also oversees a few major district roads. Traffic in Kerala has been growing at a rate of 10‚Äì11% every year, resulting in high traffic and pressure on the roads. Traffic density is nearly four times the national average, reflecting the state's high population. Kerala's annual total of road accidents is among the nation's highest. The accidents are mainly the result of the narrow roads and irresponsible driving. National Highways in Kerala are among the narrowest in the country and will remain so for the foreseeable future, as the state government has received an exemption that allows narrow national highways. In Kerala, highways are wide. In other states, national highways are grade separated, wide with a minimum of four lanes, as well as 6 or 8-lane access- controlled expressways. The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has threatened the Kerala state government that it will give higher priority to other states in highway development since political commitment to better highways in Kerala has been lacking. , Kerala had the highest road accident rate in the country, with most fatal accidents taking place along the state's national highways. KSRTC Volvo bus at Kochi. Kerala State Road Transport Corporation Kerala State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) is a state- owned road transport corporation. It is one of the country's oldest state-run public bus transport services. Its origins can be traced back to Travancore State Road Transport Department, when the Travancore government headed by Sri.Chithra Thirunnal decided to set up a public road transportation system in 1937. The corporation is divided into three zones (North, Central and South), with the headquarters in Thiruvananthapuram (Kerala's capital city). Daily scheduled service has increased from to , using 6,241 buses on 6,389 routes.At present the corporation has 5373 buses running on 4795 schedules. =Railways= The main Portico of the Thiruvananthapuram Central Railway Station Southern Railway zone of Indian Railways operates all railway lines in the state connecting most major towns and cities except those in the highland districts of Idukki and Wayanad. The railway network in the state is controlled by two out of six divisions of the Southern Railway; Thiruvananthapuram Railway division and Palakkad Railway Division. Thiruvananthapuram Central (TVC) is the busiest railway station in the state. Kerala's major railway stations are: Major railway transport between Beypore‚ÄìTirur began on 12 March 1861, from Shoranur‚ÄìCochin Harbour section in 1902, from Kollam‚ÄìSengottai on 1 July 1904, Kollam‚ÄìThiruvananthapuram on 4 January 1918, from Nilambur-Shoranur in 1927, from Ernakulam‚ÄìKottayam in 1956, from Kottayam‚ÄìKollam in 1958, from Thiruvananthapuram‚ÄìKanyakumari in 1979 and from the Thrissur-Guruvayur Section in 1994. Kochi Metro Kochi Metro train at Palarivattom Metro station Kochi Metro is the metro rail system in the city of Kochi. It is the only metro rail system in Kerala. Construction began in 2012, with the first phase being set up at an estimated cost of . The Kochi Metro uses 65-metre long Metropolis train sets built and designed by Alstom. It is the first metro system in India to use a communication-based train control (CBTC) system for signalling and telecommunication. In October 2017, Kochi Metro was named the \\"Best Urban Mobility Project\\" in India by the Urban Development Ministry, as part of the Urban Mobility India (UMI) International Conference hosted by the ministry every year. =Airports= Cochin International Airport Kerala has four international airports: Kollam Airport, established under the Madras Presidency, but since closed, was the first airport in Kerala. Trivandrum International Airport, managed by the Airport Authority of India, is among the oldest existing airports in South India. Cochin International Airport is the busiest in the state and the seventh busiest in the country. It is also the first airport in the world to be fully powered by solar energy and has won the coveted Champion of the Earth award, the highest environmental honour instituted by the United Nations. Cochin International Airport is also the first Indian airport to be incorporated as a public limited company; it was funded by nearly 10,000 non- resident Indians from 30 countries. Other than civilian airports, Kochi has a naval airport named INS Garuda. Thiruvananthapuram airport shares civilian facilities with the Southern Air Command of the Indian Air Force. These facilities are used mostly by central government VIPs visiting Kerala. =Water transport= Cranes at the International Container Transshipment Terminal, Kochi. Kerala has one major port, 17 minor ports and a few mini ports. The state has numerous backwaters, which are used for commercial inland navigation. Transport services are mainly provided by country craft and passenger vessels. There are 67 navigable rivers in the state while the total length of inland waterways is . The main constraints to the expansion of inland navigation are; lack of depth in waterways caused by silting, lack of maintenance of navigation systems and bank protection, accelerated growth of the water hyacinth, lack of modern inland craft terminals, and lack of a cargo handling system. A canal long, National Waterway 3, runs between Kottapuram and Kollam, which is included in the East-Coast Canal. Demographics Kerala is home to 2.76% of India's population; with a density of 859 persons per km2, its land is nearly three times as densely settled as the national average of 370 persons per km2. , Thiruvananthapuram is the most populous city in Kerala. In the state, the rate of population growth is India's lowest, and the decadal growth of 4.9% in 2011 is less than one third of the all-India average of 17.64%. Kerala's population more than doubled between 1951 and 1991 by adding 15.6 million people to reach 29.1 million residents in 1991; the population stood at 33.3 million by 2011. Kerala's coastal regions are the most densely settled with population of 2022 persons per km2, 2.5 times the overall population density of the state, 859 persons per km2, leaving the eastern hills and mountains comparatively sparsely populated. Around 31.8 million Keralites are predominantly Malayali. The state's 321,000 indigenous tribal Adivasis, 1.10% of the population, are concentrated in the east. =Gender= There is a tradition of matrilineal inheritance in Kerala, where the mother is the head of the household. As a result, women in Kerala have had a much higher standing and influence in the society. This was common among certain influential castes and is a factor in the value placed on daughters. Christian missionaries also influenced Malayali women in that they started schools for girls from poor families. Opportunities for women such as education and gainful employment often translate into a lower birth rate, which in turn, make education and employment more likely to be accessible and more beneficial for women. This creates an upward spiral for both the women and children of the community that is passed on to future generations. According to the Human Development Report of 1996, Kerala's Gender Development Index was 597; higher than any other state of India. Factors, such as high rates of female literacy, education, work participation and life expectancy, along with favourable sex ratio, contributed to it. Kerala's sex ratio of 1.084 (females to males) is higher than that of the rest of India and is the only state where women outnumber men. While having the opportunities that education affords them, such as political participation, keeping up to date with current events, reading religious texts etc., these tools have still not translated into full, equal rights for the women of Kerala. There is a general attitude that women must be restricted for their own benefit. In the state, despite the social progress, gender still influences social mobility.Brenda Maddox mentions in: Maddox, Brenda. \\"A Marxist Paradise For Women?\\" New Statesman. (London, England: 1996) 128 no4440 30 January 14, 1999.Antherjanam, Lalithambika. Cast Me Out If You Will. New York: The Feminist Press, 1997. LGBT rights Participants at a pride parade in Thrissur in October 2018 Kerala has been at the forefront of LGBT issues in India. Kerala is one of the first states in India to form a welfare policy for the transgender community. In 2016, the Kerala government introduced free sex reassignment surgery through government hospitals. Queerala is one of the major LGBT organisation in Kerala. It campaigns for increased awareness of LGBT people and sensitisation concerning healthcare services, workplace policies and educational curriculum. Since 2010, Kerala Queer Pride has been held annually across various cities in Kerala In June 2019, the Kerala government passed a new order that members of the transgender community should not be referred to as the \\"third gender\\" or \\"other gender\\" in government communications. Instead, the term \\"transgender\\" should be used. Previously, the gender preferences provided in government forms and documents included male, female, and other/third gender. =Human Development Index= , Kerala has a Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.770, which is in the \\"high\\" category, ranking it first in the country. It was 0.790 in 2007‚Äì08 and it had a consumption-based HDI of 0.920, which is better than that of many developed countries. Comparatively higher spending by the government on primary level education, health care and the elimination of poverty from the 19th century onwards has helped the state maintain an exceptionally high HDI; the report was prepared by the central government's Institute of Applied Manpower Research. However, the Human Development Report 2005, prepared by Centre for Development Studies envisages a virtuous phase of inclusive development for the state since the advancement in human development had already started aiding the economic development of the state. Kerala is also widely regarded as the cleanest and healthiest state in India. According to the 2011 census, Kerala has the highest literacy rate (94%) among Indian states. In 2018, the literacy rate was calculated to be 96%. In the Kottayam district, the literacy rate was 97%. The life expectancy in Kerala is 74 years, among the highest in India . Kerala's rural poverty rate fell from 59% (1973‚Äì1974) to 12% (1999‚Äì2010); the overall (urban and rural) rate fell 47% between the 1970s and 2000s against the 29% fall in overall poverty rate in India. By 1999‚Äì2000, the rural and urban poverty rates dropped to 10.0% and 9.6% respectively. The 2013 Tendulkar Committee Report on poverty estimated that the percentages of the population living below the poverty line in rural and urban Kerala are 9.14% and 4.97%, respectively. These changes stem largely from efforts begun in the late 19th century by the kingdoms of Cochin and Travancore to boost social welfare. This focus was maintained by Kerala's post-independence government. Kerala has undergone a \\"demographic transition\\" characteristic of such developed nations as Canada, Japan, and Norway;. as 11.2% of people are over the age of 60, and due to the low birthrate of 18 per 1,000. In 1991, Kerala's total fertility rate (TFR) was the lowest in India. Hindus had a TFR of 1.66, Christians; 1.78, and Muslims; 2.97. The state also is regarded as the \\"least corrupt Indian state\\" according to the surveys conducted by CMS Indian Corruption Study (CMS- ICS)https://english.manoramaonline.com/news/nation/2017/04/28/kerala-least- corrupt-states-india-karnatak-highest-petty-corruptionkerala-least-corrupt- states-india-karnatak-highest-petty-corruption.html Transparency International (2005) and India Today (1997). Kerala has the lowest homicide rate among Indian states, with 1.1 per 100,000 in 2011. In respect of female empowerment, some negative factors such as higher suicide rate, lower share of earned income, child marriage, complaints of sexual harassment and limited freedom are reported. The child marriage is lower in Kerala.The Malappuram district has the highest number of child marriage and the number of such cases are increasing in Malappuram. The child marriages are particularly higher among the Muslim community.https://english.manoramaonline.com/news/kerala/2018/10/26/child- marriages-shoot-up-in-the-most-unlikely-places-in-kerala.html In 2019, Kerala recorded the highest child sex abuse complaints in India. In 2015, Kerala had the highest conviction rate of any state, over 77%. Kerala has the lowest proportion of homeless people in rural India ‚Äì 0.04%, and the state is attempting to reach the goal of becoming the first \\"Zero Homeless State\\", in addition to its acclaimed \\"Zero landless project\\", with private organisations and the expatriate Malayali community funding projects for building homes for the homeless. The state was also among the lowest in the India State Hunger Index next only to Punjab. In 2015 Kerala became the first \\"complete digital state\\" by implementing e-governance initiatives. =Healthcare= Regional Cancer Centre, Trivandrum Kerala is a pioneer in implementing the universal health care program. The sub-replacement fertility level and infant mortality rate are lower compared to those of other states, estimated from 12 to 14 deaths per 1,000 live births; as per the National Family Health Survey 2015‚Äì16, it has dropped to 6. According to a study commissioned by Lien Foundation, a Singapore-based philanthropic organisation, Kerala is considered to be the best place to die in India based on the state's provision of palliative care for patients with serious illnesses. However, Kerala's morbidity rate is higher than that of any other Indian state‚Äî118 (rural) and 88 (urban) per 1,000 people. The corresponding figures for all India were 55 and 54 per 1,000 respectively . Kerala's 13.3% prevalence of low birth weight is higher than that of many first world nations. Outbreaks of water-borne diseases such as diarrhoea, dysentery, hepatitis, and typhoid among the more than 50% of people who rely on 3 million water wells is an issue worsened by the lack of sewers. As of 2017, the state has the highest number of diabetes patients and also the highest prevalence rate of the disease in India. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization designated Kerala the world's first \\"baby-friendly state\\" because of its effective promotion of breast-feeding over formulas. Over 95% of Keralite births are hospital delivered and the state also has the lowest Infant mortality rate in the country. The third National Family Health Survey ranks Kerala first in \\"Institutional Delivery\\" with 100% births in medical facilities. Ayurveda, siddha, and endangered and endemic modes of traditional medicine, including kalari, marmachikitsa and vishavaidyam, are practised. Some occupational communities such as Kaniyar were known as native medicine men in relation to the practice of such streams of medical systems, apart from their traditional vocation.Angus Stewart, woodburn The Religious attitude: A psychological study of its differentiation, 1927 These propagate via gurukula discipleship, and comprise a fusion of both medicinal and alternative treatments. In 2014, Kerala became the first state in India to offer free cancer treatment to the poor, via a program called Sukrutham. People in Kerala experience elevated incidence of cancers, liver and kidney diseases. In April 2016, the Economic Times reported that 250,000 residents undergo treatment for cancer. It also reported that approximately 150 to 200 liver transplants are conducted in the region's hospitals annually. Approximately 42,000 cancer cases are reported in the region annually. This is believed to be an underestimate as private hospitals may not be reporting their figures. Long waiting lists for kidney donations has stimulated illegal trade in human kidneys, and prompted the establishment of the Kidney Federation of India which aims to support financially disadvantaged patients. =Language= Malayalam is the most widely spoken language in Kerala, where its teaching in schools is mandatory. There is a significant Tamil population in Palakkad and Idukki districts. Tulu and Kannada are spoken mainly in Kasargod district. =Religion= Hinduism is the most widely professed faith in Kerala, with significant Muslim and Christian minorities. In comparison with the rest of India, Kerala experiences relatively little sectarianism. According to 2011 Census of India figures, 54.73% of Kerala's residents were Hindus, 26.56% are Muslims, 18.38% are Christians, and the remaining 0.32% follow another religion or have no religious affiliation. Hindus represent the biggest religious group in all districts except Malappuram, where they are outnumbered by Muslims. Kerala has the largest population of Christians in India. As of 2016, Hindus, Muslims, Christians and others account for 41.88%, 42.55%, 15.35% and 0.22% of the total child births in the state, respectively. The mythological legends regarding the origin of Kerala are Hindu in nature. Kerala produced several saints and movements. Adi Shankara was a religious philosopher who contributed to Hinduism and propagated the philosophy of Advaita. He was instrumental in establishing four mathas at Sringeri, Dwarka, Puri and Jyotirmath. Melpathur Narayana Bhattathiri was another religious figure who composed Narayaniyam, a collection of verses in praise of the Hindu God Krishna. Historians do not rule out the possibility of Islam being introduced to Kerala as early as the seventh century CE.Katz 2000; Koder 1973; Thomas Puthiakunnel 1973; David de Beth Hillel, 1832; Lord, James Henry 1977. Notable has been the occurrence of Cheraman Perumal Tajuddin, the Hindu King that moved to Arabia to meet the Islamic Prophet Muhammad and converted to Islam.Minu Ittyipe; Solomon to Cheraman; Outlook Indian Magazine; 2012 Kerala Muslims are generally referred to as the Mappilas. Mappilas are but one among the many communities that forms the Muslim population of Kerala.Kunhali, V. \\"Muslim Communities in Kerala to 1798\\" PhD Dissertation Aligarh Muslim University (1986) According to some scholars, the Mappilas are the oldest settled Muslim community in South Asia.Miller, E.

Brill 1988 p. 458-66 Most of the Muslims in Kerala follow the ShƒÅfi øƒ´ school of religious law while a large minority follow movements that developed within Sunni Islam. The latter section consists of majority Salafists (the Mujahids). There is a large Keralan diaspora in the Middle East.Miller, Roland. E., \\"Mappila\\" in \\"The Encyclopedia of Islam\\". Volume VI. E. J. Brill, Leiden. 1987 pp. 458‚Äì56. Ancient Christian tradition says that Christianity reached the shores of Kerala in AD 52 with the arrival of Thomas the Apostle, one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus Christ.Menachery G; 1973, 1998; Mundalan, A. M; 1984; Podipara, Placid J. 1970; Leslie Brown, 1956 Saint Thomas Christians include Syro-Malabar Catholic, Syro-Malankara Catholic, Jacobite Syrian, Malankara Marthoma Syrian, Malankara Orthodox Syrian, the Syrian Anglicans of the CSI and several Pentecostal and evangelical denominations. The origin of the Latin Catholic Christians in Kerala is the result of the missionary endeavours of the Portuguese Padroado in the 16th century. As a consequence of centuries of mixing with colonial immigrants, beginning with the Portuguese, Dutch, French, British and other Europeans, there is a community of Anglo-Indians in Kerala of mixed European and Indian parentage or ancestry. Kerala has the highest population of Christians among all the states of India.Singh, Anjana. \\"Fort Cochin in Kerala 1750‚Äì1830 The Social Condition of a Dutch Community in an Indian Milieu.\\" Brill, Leiden Boston: 2010, 3: 92.

Encyclopedia of the Jewish Diaspora, Santa Barbara, USA: ABC CLIO. 2008, 3: 1204‚Äì1212. They are called Cochin Jews or Malabar Jews and are the oldest group of Jews in India.Weil, Shalva. India's Jewish Heritage: Ritual, Art and Life-Cycle, Mumbai: Marg Publications, 2009. [first published in 2002; 3rd edn.]. Katz 200/* Religion */ 0; Koder 1973; Menachery 1998 There was a significant Jewish community which existed in Kerala until the 20th century, when most of them migrated to Israel. The Paradesi Synagogue at Kochi is the oldest synagogue in the Commonwealth.Jainism has a considerable following in the Wayanad district. Buddhism was popular in the time of Ashoka but vanished by the 12th century CE. Certain Hindu communities such as the Samantan Kshatriyas, Ambalavasis, Nairs, Thiyyas and some Muslims around North Malabar used to follow a traditional matrilineal system known as marumakkathayam, although this practice ended in the years after Indian independence. Other Muslims, Christians, and some Hindu castes such as the Namboothiris, most of the Ambalavasi castes and the Ezhavas followed makkathayam, a patrilineal system. Owing to the former matrilineal system, women in Kerala enjoy a high social status.\\"Kerala.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2008. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. 8 June 2008 However, gender inequality among low caste men and women is reportedly higher compared to that in other castes. Education The University of Kerala in Thiruvananthapuram The Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics flourished between the 14th and 16th centuries. In attempting to solve astronomical problems, the Kerala school independently created a number of important mathematics concepts, including series expansion for trigonometric functions. In the early decades of the 19th century, the modern educational transformation of Kerala was triggered by the efforts of the Church Mission Society missionaries to promote mass education. Following the recommendations of the Wood's despatch of 1854, the princely states of Travancore and Cochin launched mass education drives mainly based on castes and communities, and introduced a system of grant-in-aid to attract more private initiatives. The efforts by leaders such as Vaikunda Swami, Narayana Guru, Ayyankali, and Kuriakose Elias Chavara in aiding the socially discriminated castes in the state‚Äîwith the help of community-based organisations like Nair Service Society, SNDP, Muslim Mahajana Sabha, Yoga Kshema Sabha (of Nambudiris) and congregations of Christian churches‚Äîled to the further development of mass education in Kerala. According to the first economic census, conducted in 1977, 99.7% of the villages in Kerala had a primary school within , 98.6% had a middle school within and 96.7% had a high school or higher secondary school within . In 1991, Kerala became the first state in India to be recognised as completely literate, although the effective literacy rate at that time was only 90%. In 2006‚Äì2007, the state topped the Education Development Index (EDI) of the 21 major states in India. , enrolment in elementary education was almost 100%; and, unlike other states in India, educational opportunity was almost equally distributed among sexes, social groups, and regions. According to the 2011 census, Kerala has a 93.91% literacy, compared to the national literacy rate of 74.04%. In January 2016, Kerala became the first Indian state to achieve 100% primary education through its Athulyam literacy programme. The educational system prevailing in the state's schools specifies an initial 10-year course of study, which is divided three stages‚Äîlower primary, upper primary, and secondary school‚Äîknown as 4+3+3, which signifies the number of years for each stage. After the first 10 years of schooling, students typically enroll in Higher Secondary Schooling in one of the three major streams‚Äîliberal arts, commerce, or science. Upon completing the required coursework, students can enroll in general or professional undergraduate (UG) degree-college programmes. The majority of public schools are affiliated with the Kerala State Education Board. Other educational boards are the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE), the Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE), and the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS). English is the language of instruction in most self- financing schools, while government and government-aided schools offer instruction in English or Malayalam. Though the cost of education is generally considered low in Kerala,Najith Kumar, K.K. George, \\"Kerala's education system: from inclusion to exclusion\\", Economic and Political Weekly, 10 October 2009, VOL XLIV, NO 41, page 55 according to the 61st round of the National Sample Survey (2004‚Äì2005), per capita spending on education by the rural households was reported to be for Kerala, more than twice the national average. The survey also revealed that the rural-urban difference in household expenditure on education was much less in Kerala than in the rest of India.Najith Kumar, K.K. George, \\"Kerala's education system: from inclusion to exclusion\\", Economic and Political Weekly, 10 October 2009, VOL XLIV, NO 41, page 56 CMS College, Kottayam, established in 1817, is the first western-style college, and one of the oldest colleges, in India. Government Brennen College, Thalassery, founded by philanthropist Edward Brennen in 1862, is one of the oldest educational institutions in India. The Indian Naval Academy, located at Ezhimala, is Asia's largest, and the world's third-largest, naval academy. Culture The culture of Kerala is composite and cosmopolitan in nature and it is an integral part of Indian culture. It is synthesis of Aryan and Dravidian cultures, defined by its antiquity and the organic continuity sustained by the Malayali people. It was elaborated through centuries of contact with neighbouring and overseas cultures. However, the geographical insularity of Kerala from the rest of the country has resulted in the development of a distinctive lifestyle, art, architecture, language, literature and social institutions. Over 10,000 festivals are celebrated in the state every year. The Malayalam calendar, a solar sidereal calendar started from 825 CE in Kerala, finds common usage in planning agricultural and religious activities. Malayalam, one of the classical languages in India, is Kerala's official language. Over a dozen other scheduled and unscheduled languages are also spoken. Kerala has the greatest consumption of alcohol in India.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-51372583 =Festivals= Many of the temples in Kerala hold festivals on specific days of the year. A common characteristic of these festivals is the hoisting of a holy flag which is brought down on the final day of the festival after immersing the deity. Some festivals include Poorams, the best known of these being the Thrissur Pooram. \\"Elephants, firework displays and huge crowds\\" are the major attractions of Thrissur Pooram. Other known festivals are Makaravilakku, Chinakkathoor Pooram, Attukal Pongala and Nenmara Vallangi Vela Other than these, festivals locally known as utsavams are conducted by many temples mostly on annual basis. Temples that can afford it will usually involve at least one richly caparisoned elephant as part of the festivities. The idol in the temple is taken out on a procession around the countryside atop this elephant. When the procession visits homes around the temple, people will usually present rice, coconuts, and other offerings to it. Processions often include traditional music such as Panchari melam or Panchavadyam. Onam Onam is a harvest festival celebrated by the people of Kerala and is reminiscent of the state's agrarian past. It is a local festival of Kerala consisting of a four-day public holidays; from Onam Eve (Uthradam) to the fourth Onam Day. Onam falls in the Malayalam month of Chingam (August‚ÄìSeptember) and marks the commemoration of the homecoming of King Mahabali. The total duration of Onam is 10 days and it is celebrated all across Kerala. It is one of the festivals celebrated with cultural elements such as Vallam Kali, Pulikali, Pookkalam, Thumbi Thullal and Onavillu. =Dance= Kerala is home to a number of performance arts. These include five classical dance forms: Kathakali, Mohiniyattam, Koodiyattom, Thullal and Krishnanattam, which originated and developed in the temple theatres during the classical period under the patronage of royal houses. Kerala natanam, Thirayattam,\\"Thirayattam\\" (Folklore Text-Malayalam), State Institute of language, Kerala Kaliyattam, Theyyam, Koothu and Padayani are other dance forms associated with the temple culture of the region. Some traditional dance forms such as Margamkali and Parichamuttukali are popular among the Syrian Christians and Chavittu nadakom is popular among the Latin Christians, while Oppana and Duffmuttu were popular among the Muslims of the state. =Music= The development of classical music in Kerala is attributed to the contributions it received from the traditional performance arts associated with the temple culture of Kerala. The development of the indigenous classical music form, Sopana Sangeetham, illustrates the rich contribution that temple culture has made to the arts of Kerala. Carnatic music dominates Keralite traditional music. This was the result of Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma's popularisation of the genre in the 19th century. Raga-based renditions known as sopanam accompany kathakali performances. Melam; including the paandi and panchari variants, is a more percussive style of music: it is performed at Kshetram-centered festivals using the chenda. Panchavadyam is a form of percussion ensemble, in which artists use five types of percussion instrument. Kerala's visual arts range from traditional murals to the works of Raja Ravi Varma, the state's most renowned painter. Most of the castes and communities in Kerala have rich collections of folk songs and ballads associated with a variety of themes; Vadakkan Pattukal (Northern Ballads), Thekkan pattukal (Southern Ballads), Vanchi pattukal (Boat Songs), Mappila Pattukal (Muslim songs) and Pallipattukal (Church songs) are a few of them. =Cinema= Malayalam films carved a niche for themselves in the Indian film industry with the presentation of social themes. Directors from Kerala, like Adoor Gopalakrishnan, G. Aravindan, Bharathan, P. Padmarajan, M.T.Vasudevan Nair, K.G. George, Priyadarshan, John Abraham, Ramu Karyat, K S Sethumadhavan, A. Vincent and Shaji N Karun have made a considerable contribution to the Indian parallel cinema. Kerala has also given birth to numerous actors, such as Mohanlal, Satyan, Prem Nazir, Madhu, Sheela, Sharada, Miss Kumari, Jayan, Adoor Bhasi, Seema, Bharath Gopi, Thilakan, Mammootty, Vijaya Raghavan, Kalabhavan Mani, Indrans, Shobana, Nivin Pauly, Sreenivasan, Urvashi, Manju Warrier, Suresh Gopi, Jayaram, Murali, Shankaradi, Kavya Madhavan, Bhavana Menon, Prithviraj, Parvathy (actress), Jayasurya, Dulquer Salmaan, Oduvil Unnikrishnan, Jagathy Sreekumar, Nedumudi Venu, KPAC Lalitha, Innocent and Fahad Fazil. Late Malayalam actor Prem Nazir holds the world record for having acted as the protagonist of over 720 movies. Since the 1980s, actors Mohanlal and Mammootty have dominated the movie industry; Mohanlal has won five National Film Awards (four for acting), while Mammootty has three National Film Awards for acting. Malayalam Cinema has produced a few more notable personalities such as K.J. Yesudas, K.S. Chitra, M.G. Sreekumar, Vayalar Rama Varma, V. Madhusoodanan Nair, M.T. Vasudevan Nair and O.N.V. Kurup, the last two mentioned being recipients of Jnanpith award, the highest literary award in India. Resul Pookutty, who is from Kerala, is only the second Indian to win an academy award for sound design, for the breakthrough film Slumdog Millionaire. =Literature= Malayalam literature starts from the late medieval period and includes such notable writers as the 14th-century Niranam poets (Madhava Panikkar, Sankara Panikkar and Rama Panikkar), and the 17th- century poet Thunchaththu Ezhuthachan, whose works mark the dawn of both the modern Malayalam language and its poetry. Paremmakkal Thoma Kathanar and Kerala Varma Valiakoi Thampuran are noted for their contribution to Malayalam prose. The \\"triumvirate of poets\\" (Kavithrayam): Kumaran Asan, Vallathol Narayana Menon, and Ulloor S. Parameswara Iyer, are recognised for moving Keralite poetry away from archaic sophistry and metaphysics, and towards a more lyrical mode. In the second half of the 20th century, Jnanpith winning poets and writers like G. Sankara Kurup, S. K. Pottekkatt, Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai, M. T. Vasudevan Nair and O. N. V. Kurup had made valuable contributions to the modern Malayalam literature. Later, writers like O. V. Vijayan, Kamaladas, M. Mukundan, Arundhati Roy, Vaikom Muhammed Basheer, have gained international recognition. =Cuisine= Kerala cuisine includes a wide variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes prepared using fish, poultry, and meat. Culinary spices have been cultivated in Kerala for millennia and they are characteristic of its cuisine. Rice is a dominant staple that is eaten at all times of day. A majority of the breakfast foods in Kerala are made out of rice, in one form or the other (idli, dosa, puttu, appam, or idiyappam), tapioca preparations, or pulse-based vada. These may be accompanied by chutney, kadala, payasam, payar pappadam, appam, chicken curry, beef fry, egg masala and fish curry. Porotta and Biryani are also often found in restaurants in Kerala. Thalassery biryani is popular as an ethnic brand. Lunch dishes include rice and curry along with rasam, pulisherry and sambar. Sadhya is a vegetarian meal, which is served on a banana leaf and followed with a cup of payasam. Popular snacks include banana chips, yam crisps, tapioca chips, Achappam, Unni appam and kuzhalappam. Seafood specialties include karimeen, prawns, shrimp and other crustacean dishes. Thalassery Cuisine is varied and is a blend of many influences. =Elephants= Elephants have been an integral part of the culture of the state. Almost all of the local festivals in kerala include at least one richly caparisoned elephant. Kerala is home to the largest domesticated population of elephants in India‚Äîabout 700 Indian elephants, owned by temples as well as individuals. These elephants are mainly employed for the processions and displays associated with festivals celebrated all around the state. More than 10,000 festivals are celebrated in the state annually and some animal lovers have sometimes raised concerns regarding the overwork of domesticated elephants during them. In Malayalam literature, elephants are referred to as the \\"sons of the sahya\\". The elephant is the state animal of Kerala and is featured on the emblem of the Government of Kerala.

Cricket and football became popular in the state; both were introduced in Malabar during the British colonial period in the 19th century. Cricketers, like Tinu Yohannan, Abey Kuruvilla, Sreesanth, Sanju Samson and Basil Thampi found places in the national cricket team. A cricket club from Kerala, the Kochi Tuskers, played in the Indian Premier League's fourth season. However, the team was disbanded after the season because of conflicts of interest among its franchises. Kerala has only performed well recently in the Ranji Trophy cricket competition, in 2017‚Äì18 reaching the quarterfinals for the first time in history.

Tourism Kerala's culture and traditions, coupled with its varied demographics, have made the state one of the most popular tourist destinations in India. In 2012, National Geographic's Traveller magazine named Kerala as one of the \\"ten paradises of the world\\" and \\"50 must see destinations of a lifetime\\". Travel and Leisure also described Kerala as \\"One of the 100 great trips for the 21st century\\". In 2012, it overtook the Taj Mahal to be the number one travel destination in Google's search trends for India. CNN Travel listed Kerala amongst its '19 best places to visit in 2019'. Kerala's beaches, backwaters, lakes, mountain ranges, waterfalls, ancient ports, palaces, religious institutions and wildlife sanctuaries are major attractions for both domestic and international tourists. The city of Kochi ranks first in the total number of international and domestic tourists in Kerala. Until the early 1980s, Kerala was a relatively unknown destination compared to other states in the country. In 1986 the government of Kerala declared tourism an important industry and it was the first state in India to do so. Marketing campaigns launched by the Kerala Tourism Development Corporation, the government agency that oversees the tourism prospects of the state, resulted in the growth of the tourism industry. Many advertisements branded Kerala with the tagline Kerala, God's Own Country. Kerala tourism is a global brand and regarded as one of the destinations with highest recall. In 2006, Kerala attracted 8.5 million tourists, an increase of 23.68% over the previous year, making the state one of the fastest-growing popular destinations in the world. In 2011, tourist inflow to Kerala crossed the 10-million mark. Ayurvedic tourism has become very popular since the 1990s, and private agencies have played a notable role in tandem with the initiatives of the Tourism Department. Kerala is known for its ecotourism initiatives which include mountaineering, trekking and bird- watching programmes in the Western Ghats as the major activities. The state's tourism industry is a major contributor to the state's economy, growing at the rate of 13.31%. The revenue from tourism increased five-fold between 2001 and 2011 and crossed the 190 billion mark in 2011. According to the Economic Times Kerala netted a record revenue of INR 36,528.01 crore from the tourism sector in 2018, clocking an increase of Rs 2,874.33 crore from the previous year. Over 16.7 million tourists visited Kerala in 2018 as against 15.76 million the previous year, recording an increase of 5.93 per cent. The industry provides employment to approximately 1.2 million people. The state's only drive-in beach, Muzhappilangad in Kannur, which stretches across five kilometres of sand, was chosen by the BBC as one of the top six drive-in beaches in the world in 2016. Idukki Dam, the world's second arch dam, and Asia's first is at Idukki. The major beaches are at Kovalam, Varkala, Kozhikode, Fort Kochi, Cherai, Alappuzha, Payyambalam, Kappad, Muzhappilangad and Bekal. Popular hill stations are at Ponmudi, Wayanad, Wagamon, Munnar, Peermade, Ramakkalmedu, Paithalmala of Kannur district and Nelliampathi. Munnar is 4,500 feet above sea level and is known for tea plantations, and a variety of flora and fauna.

He named the station after his mother, and the community around the station and around the intersection of Welsh Rd and Huntingdon Pike became known as Bethayres. Bethayres and its northern neighbor, Huntingdon Valley had separate post offices until they became one post office. Until the name was changed to solely Huntingdon Valley Post Office, Huntingdon Valley-Bethayres was the longest postal name in the United States. On January 3, 1989, the community made headlines when Bucks County resident Glen Alton Barhight stole a SEPTA bus, and began a series of events which resulted in the injury of 15 people, the damage or destruction of 15 cars, and a police chase through five municipalities which ended when the bus crashed into a tree in Bethayres.McGovern, Bob. \\"30 years ago, man stole a SEPTA bus and took it on a wild ride.\\" Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: Philly Voice, January 3, 2019.

The 13 stars represent the original 13 US states, and indicate a United States Department of Defense organization (see seal). Counter-Guerrilla () is the Turkish branch of Operation Gladio, a clandestine stay-behind anti-communist initiative backed by the United States as an expression of the Truman Doctrine. The founding goal of the operation was to erect a stay-behind guerrilla force to undermine a possible Soviet occupation. The goal was soon expanded to subverting communism in Turkey. The Counter-Guerrilla initially operated out of the Turkish Armed Forces' Tactical Mobilization Group (, or STK). In 1967, the STK was renamed to the Special Warfare Department (, √ñHD). In 1994, the √ñHD became the Special Forces Command (, √ñKK). In Turkey there is a popular belief that the Counter-Guerrilla are responsible for numerous unsolved acts of violence, and have exerted great influence over the country's Cold War history, most notably for engendering the military coups of 1971 and 1980. The military accepts that the √ñKK is tasked with subverting a possible occupation, though it denies that the unit is Gladio's \\"Counter-Guerrilla\\", i.e., that it has engaged in black operations. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Counter-Guerrilla were used to fight the militant Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) (cf. Susurluk scandal), which has since its inception been regarded as a major threat by the deep state in Turkey. Mehmet Ali Agca was part of the group in the late 1970s. Counter-Guerilla's existence was revealed in 1971 by survivors of the Ziverbey incident, and officially on 26 September 1973 by Prime Minister B√ºlent Ecevit. The subject has been broached by parliament at least 27 times since 1990, however no successful investigation has taken place. Deputies of the incumbent party in any given administration always voted in dissent. Background Anatolia's geostrategic value has long attracted players of the New Great Game. After the Yalta and Potsdam Conferences in 1945, Joseph Stalin sent naval ships and troops to the region with his sights set on the Dardanelles. In 1946, the Soviet Union sent two diplomatic notes concerning the Montreux Convention Regarding the Regime of the Turkish Straits, arguing that its terms were unfavorable to the Soviets. Ankara dismissed the notes, and the US also expressed its dissatisfaction with Soviet demands, stating that \\"Should the Straits become the object of attack or threat of attack by an aggressor, the resulting situation would constitute a threat to international security and would clearly be a matter for action on the party of the Security Council of the United Nations.\\" Development of US- Turkish military cooperation After the British government declared on 21 February 1947 its inability to provide financial aid (though she would establish the Central Treaty Organization a decade later), Turkey turned towards the United States, who drew up the Truman Doctrine, pledging to \\"support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures\\". $100 million was appropriated two months after the US Congress ratified the Truman Doctrine on 12 March 1947. This figure was raised to $233 million by 1950, after Turkey contributed a brigade of about 5000 men to the United Nations forces in the Korean War. In August 1947, the Joint American Military Mission for Aid to Turkey (JAMMAT) was established in Ankara under the authority of the US ambassador. On 5 October 1947, a delegation of senior Turkish military officials traveled to the United States to establish the military framework of the co-operation agreement. In December 1947, United States National Security Council (NSC) Directive 4-A \\"secretly authorised the CIA to conduct these officially non-existent programs and to administer them\\" in such a way that \\"removed the U.S. Congress and public from any debate over whether to undertake psychological warfare abroad\\". A few months later, the NSC replaced directive 4-A with directive 10/2, creating the Office of Policy Coordination (OPC, initially euphemistically called the \\"Office for Special Projects\\"), the covert action arm of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The OPC's charter unambiguously called for \\"propaganda, economic warfare; preventative direct action, including sabotage, anti-sabotage, demolition and evacuation measures; subversion against hostile states, including assistance to underground resistance movements, guerrillas and refugee liberations groups, and support of indigenous anti-communist elements in threatened countries of the free world.\\" In the words of career intelligence officer William Corson, \\"no holds were barred‚Ä¶ all the guys on the top had said to put on the brass knuckles and go to work.\\" After joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) on February 18, 1952, Turkey signed a Military Facilities Agreement on 23 June 1954, paving the way for a large scale US military presence. With a staff of 1200 by 1959, JAMMAT was the largest of the United States European Commands (USEUCOM), and also the world's largest military assistance and advisory group by 1951. (original PDF . 3.1MB) JAMMAT was renamed to Joint United States Military Mission for Aid to Turkey (JUSMMAT) in 1958, and the Office of Defense Cooperation Turkey (ODC-T) () on 1 May 1994.Defunct ODC Turkey Web site (2002) Tactical Mobilization Group (1952‚Äì1965) The command structure of the Counter-Guerrilla, as suggested in Field Manual 31-15: Operations Against Irregular Forces. The Host Country in this case is Turkey. With the consent of the National Defense Supreme Council (), brigadier general Dani≈ü Karabelen founded the Tactical Mobilization Group (, or STK) on 27 September 1952. Karabelen was one of sixteen soldiers (including Turgut Sunalp, Ahmet Yƒ±ldƒ±z, Alparslan T√ºrke≈ü, Suphi Karaman, and Fikret Ate≈üdaƒülƒ±) who had been sent to the United States in 1948 for training in special warfare. These people were to form the core of the Special Warfare Department (, or √ñHD). It has been said that the training also entailed an element of CIA recruitment. Some full generals that later ran the department were Adnan Doƒüu, Aydƒ±n ƒ∞lter, Sabri Yirmibe≈üoƒülu, ƒ∞brahim T√ºrkgenci, Doƒüan Bayazƒ±t, and Fevzi T√ºrkeri. Karabelen picked Ismail Tansu as his right-hand man, and they expanded the STK in a cellular fashion. They filled the ranks, mostly with reserve officers, inducted them with an oath, and educated them before allowing them to return to civilian life. The officers were given no weapons, funding, or immediate task. The recruitment was more concentrated in the east, where an invasion was most likely to occur. Books used to educate the officers included: * David Galula's famous Counterinsurgency Warfare: Theory and Practice. Translated in Turkish as Ayaklanmalarƒ± Bastƒ±rma Harek√¢tƒ±: Teori ve Pratik per orders from then chief of the √ñHD, major general M. Cihat Akyol. * U.S. Army Field Manual 31-15: Operations Against Irregular Forces. Translated into Turkish as Sahra Talimnamesi 31-15: Gayri Nizami Kuvvetlere Kar≈üƒ± Harekat, and put into practice on 25 May 1964 per orders from general Ali Keskiner. * Senior infantry colonel Cahit Vural's Gerillaya Giri≈ü (1972). Later, the generals formed the Turkish Resistance Organization to counter the Greek Cypriot EOKA. Operating under the authority of the Chief of the General Staff, the STK was quartered in the JUSMMAT () building in Bah√ßelievler, Ankara. quoting B√ºlent Ecevit from Ismail Tansu says that the American headquarters were facing the old G√ºlhane building, and that the STK's headquarters were in a villa near Kolej, Kƒ±zƒ±lay.Picture of the JUSMMAT building, some newspaper headlines, and other information: He also said that he used to meet soldiers from the J3 Operations Directorate a few times a week, alternating between their bases. Some of his associates were colonel Latent, captain Berger, and major Hill.

These formed the core of future ultra-nationalist militants, used by the Counter- Guerrilla in destabilizing events. The CIA employed people from the far right, such as Pan-Turkist SS-member Ruzi Nazar (father of Sylvia Nasar), to train the Grey Wolves (), the youth wing of the MHP. Nazar was an Uzbek born near Tashkent who had deserted the Red Army to join the Nazis during World War II in order to fight on the Eastern Front for the creation of a Turkistan. After Germany lost the war, some of its spies found haven in the U.S. intelligence community. Nazar was such a person, and he became the CIA's station chief to Turkey.) See also The STK became the Special Warfare Department (, √ñHD) in 1967. Special Warfare Department (1965‚Äì1992) = Search for funding = During the 1970s, the Special Warfare Department () was run by General Kemal Yamak. In his memoirs he stated that the United States had set aside around $1m worth of support; part munitions, part money. This arrangement continued until 1973-4, when Yamak decided the munitions did not meet the department's needs. The Americans allegedly retorted that they were footing the bill, and had right of decision. Yamak left the meeting and expressed his concerns to the Chief of General Staff, Semih Sancar, and the agreement was subsequently annulled. It was only when Yamak asked prime minister B√ºlent Ecevit for an alternative means of funding did Ecevit became aware of the operation's existence; the other members of the cabinet remained in the dark. Ecevit suggested that the organization seek support from Europe. Yamak contacted generals from the United Kingdom, followed by France. The commander of the Turkish army at the time, General Semih Sancar, informed him the U.S. had financed the unit as well as the National Intelligence Organization since the immediate post-war years. Special Forces Command (1992‚Äìpresent) =Post- USSR= In the early 1990s, Turkey and America were at loggerheads over the Kurdish issue. In order to reduce U.S. influence over the Turkish military, chief of staff Doƒüan G√ºre≈ü restructured the √ñHD and renamed it to the Special Forces Command (, or √ñKK) in 1992. For a quote in English see The √ñKK, whose 7000+ recruits are nicknamed the \\"Maroon Berets\\" (), combats terrorism and protects the chiefs of staff and the president on trips abroad. Similarly, civilian counter-guerrillas are collectively named the White Forces (). In 1993, the parliament formed a commission () to investigate the numerous unsolved murders believed to be perpetrated by the Counter-Guerrilla. Their report enumerated 1797 such deaths; 316 in 1992 and 314 in 1993 alone. General G√ºre≈ü contacted the Speaker of Parliament, H√ºsamettin Cindoruk, to stop the investigation in order to prevent the outing of his men. Meanwhile, State Security Court prosecutor Nusret Demiral ordered the police force not to co- operate with the parliamentary commission in solving the crimes. Turkey maintains strong military ties with the U.S., through the Office of Defense Cooperation Turkey (ODC-T), whose leader is \\"the single point of contact with the Turkish General Staff regarding all United States military organizations and activities in Turkey\\". , this position is held by major general Eric J. Rosborg. Since 1993, the chiefs of the ODC-T have been U.S. Air Force generals. The offices of the ODC-T are located at Kirazlƒ±dere Mevkii, ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º Bulvarƒ± No. 94, Balgat, 06100 Ankara. Incidents = Istanbul pogrom = In 1955, members of the √ñHD participated in planning the Istanbul Pogrom, which promoted both the state's secret policy of Turkification, and the subversion of Communism. =Coups of 1971 and 1980= After the military coup in 1960, yet another plot was exposed by National Intelligence Organization (Mƒ∞T) agent Mahir Kaynak, who in early 1971 informed both Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Memduh Taƒüma√ß and also the fiercely anti-communist Commander of the First Army based in ƒ∞stanbul, General Faik T√ºr√ºn, who was a veteran of Korean War and was decorated personally by General Douglas MacArthur there. The information conveyed to them was that a number of high-ranking Turkish officers, including the Army Chief of Staff and the Air Force Chief of Staff were planning to execute a military coup on 9 March 1971 with the media support of pro-Soviet leftist intellectuals in a number of Turkish newspapers. On 10 March 1971, the CIA sent the State and Defense departments a cable stating that the Turkish high command had convened that day resolving to carry out a counter-coup. (originally from the National Archives, Nixon Presidential Materials, NSC Files, Box 632, Country Files‚ÄîMiddle East, Turkey, Vol. II, 1 Jan 1970-31 Dec 1971.) The 1971 coup on 12 March was executed to forestall a Soviet supported left-wing coup originally planned to take place on 9 March 1971. Immediately after the coup, Soviet leaning intellectuals, civilian and non-ranking participants in the 9 March plot were interrogated in a building allegedly belonging to the Mƒ∞T (see the next section). One 9 March plotter, colonel Talat Turhan, was interrogated by the chief of the Mƒ∞T, Ey√ºp Ozalkus. Turhan expended much effort on exposing the Counter-Guerrilla after his release. It has been alleged that the groups of plotters were in fact two facets of the same organization. The counter-guerrilla engaged in sporadic acts of domestic terror throughout the 1970s , serving as a pretext for yet another coup in 1980. By the time it took place, this third military coup in the short history of Turkish democracy (1950‚Äì1980) was seen as necessary by the unwitting public to restoring peace. It was also encouraged by members of Parliament, many of whom had joined the Counter-Guerrilla in their youth. With this coup firm steps were taken to bring the country under the military's heel. A stifling constitution was drafted, a Supreme Education Council was established to bring intellectuals into line, and the National Security Council was beefed up to do the same for politicians. After having served his role in instigating the 1980 coup, Alparslan T√ºrke≈ü was jailed by the high command. In fact, General Madanoƒülu intended to execute him by a firing squad, but his friend Ruzi Nazar (of the CIA) intervened. =Ziverbey villa= After the 1971 coup d'√©tat, the Ziverbey villa in Erenk√∂y, Istanbul was used to interrogate Turkish communists. The mastermind behind Ziverbey interrogations was brigadier general Memduh √únl√ºt√ºrk, working under Lieutenant General Turgut Sunalp, who was reporting to the Commander of the First Army, General Faik T√ºr√ºn. The latter two generals were Korean War veterans who had served in the Operations Department (). The interrogation techniques they used in Ziverbey were inspired by what they had seen done to Korean and Chinese POWs during the Korean War. Prisoners were bound and blindfolded. Intellectuals such as ƒ∞lhan Sel√ßuk (one of the 9 March conspirators) and Uƒüur Mumcu were tortured there. Several Ziverbey victims confirmed that the interrogators introduced themselves as \\"Counter-Guerrillas\\" and claimed to be above the law and entitled to kill.Lucy Komisar, Turkey's terrorists: a CIA legacy lives on, The Progressive, April 1997.ƒ∞lhan Sel√ßuk, Ziverbey K√∂≈ük√º (quoted in Mercan, 2006). His interrogators reputedly said: \\"ƒ∞lhan Sel√ßuk, Genelkurmay Ba≈ükanlƒ±ƒüƒ±na baƒülƒ± kontrgerilla √∂rg√ºt√ºn√ºn kar≈üƒ±sƒ±nda bulunuyorsun. Sen bizim tutsaƒüƒ±mƒ±zsƒ±n. Burada anayasa babayasa yoktur. √ñrg√ºt seni √∂l√ºme mahkum etmi≈ütir. Sana istediƒüimizi yapmaya yetkiliyiz. Buraya getirilmen √∂rg√ºt kararƒ±yladƒ±r. Seni Marksist, Leninist, Kom√ºnist biliyoruz. Eƒüer konu≈üur ve b√∂yle olduƒüunu itiraf edersen hakkƒ±nda hayƒ±rlƒ± olur.\\" Under duress to write an apologetic statement, Sel√ßuk famously revealed his plight using a modified acrostic which decrypted to \\"I am under torture\\". The key letter was the first of the penultimate word of each sentence in his statement. Another prisoner, outspoken liberal Murat Belge, says that he was tortured there by Veli K√º√ß√ºk, who later founded JITEM and Hezbollah (Turkey) to counter the Kurdistan Workers' Party. K√º√ß√ºk says he could not be responsible since he was stationed in ≈ûƒ±rnak and has been charged with colluding with another Ziverbey victim, ƒ∞lhan Sel√ßuk (see Ergenekon). The activist film director Yƒ±lmaz G√ºney was also present. A friend of his in the Mƒ∞T had tried to prevent him from being captured by telling his superiors that G√ºney was also a spy, but the ruse failed. A Mƒ∞T officer who was present, Mehmet Eym√ºr, said G√ºney was treated well in return for his co-operation. General Yamak denied that the √ñHD was involved, and dismissed any notion of a \\"counter-guerrilla\\". Ziverbey is notable for: * being the first time the term \\"Counter-Guerrilla\\" was mentioned to anyone who was not already a member. * revealing the fact that the counter-guerrilla co-operated with the Mƒ∞T. =Kƒ±zƒ±ldere Operation= On 30 March 1972 special forces raided Kƒ±zƒ±ldere village in Niksar district, Tokat province and killed the 10 young men who had kidnapped three foreign hostages and kept them in Kƒ±zƒ±ldere. The victims included Mahir √áayan (THKP-C), H√ºdai Arƒ±kan (Dev-Gen√ß), Cihan Alptekin (THKO), taxi driver Nihat Yƒ±lmaz, teacher Ertan Saruhan, farmer Ahmet Atasoy, Sinan Kazƒ±m √ñz√ºdoƒüru (Dev-Gen√ß), student Sabahattin Kurt, √ñmer Ayna (THKO) and lieutenant Saffet Alp. The three hostages (two British and one Canadian citizen) where part of GCHQ and were held in an attempt to prevent the execution of three student leaders (Deniz Gezmi≈ü, H√ºseyin ƒ∞nan and Yusuf Aslan) were also killed. Although General Yamak denied it, an active participant, hitman Metin Kaplan said that the √ñHD was responsible. He mentioned talking to general Memduh √únl√ºt√ºrk (himself a Counter-Guerrilla, and infamous participant of the Ziverbey villa incident) about what to do with the Communist inmates of Maltepe prison, who were planning to escape. On the advice of two U.S. generals, they let the prisoners escape, and then take hostage three NATO officers at √únye. This created the pretext for their assassination. =Taksim Square massacre= On 1 May 1977 the trade union confederation Dƒ∞SK held a rally on Taksim Square, Istanbul with half a million participants. Unidentified people shot at the crowd and killed 36 people. The perpetrators were never caught. Prime Minister B√ºlent Ecevit, and member of the leftist Republican People's Party, declared to then President Fahri Korut√ºrk that he suspected the Counter-Guerrilla's involvement in the massacre.Ganser, Daniele. NATO's Secret Armies. Operation Gladio and Terrorism in Western Europe, Franck Cass, London, 2005, p.237 According to Ecevit, the shooting lasted for twenty minutes, yet several thousand policemen on the scene did not intervene. This mode of operation recalls the June 20, 1973 Ezeiza massacre in Buenos Aires, when the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance (a.k.a. \\"Triple A\\"), founded by Jos√© L√≥pez Rega (a P2 member), opened fire on the left-wing Peronists. Moreover, Ecevit himself barely survived an assassination attempt twenty days after he publicly mentioned the possibility of a secret organization being behind the massacre. Ankara's Deputy State Attorney Doƒüan √ñz then investigated on relationship between Alparslan T√ºrke≈ü's Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) the Special Warfare Department and violent incidents of the 1970s. Doƒüan √ñz's report stated that \\"Military and civilian security forces are behind all this work.\\" It also stated that the National Intelligence Organization was complicit, and that \\"all these activities [were] guided by MHP members and cadres.\\" The attorney Doƒüan √ñz was assassinated on March 24, 1978. ƒ∞brahim √áift√ßi, a member of the Grey Wolves, confessed to the crime, but his conviction was overturned by the military judicial system. =16 March massacre= Seven students (Hatice √ñzen, Cemil S√∂nmez, Baki Ekiz, Turan √ñren, Abdullah ≈ûim≈üek, Hamit Akƒ±l and Murat Kurt) were killed and 41 were injured at Istanbul University's Faculty of Pharmacy on 16 March 1978. The assailants were members of the Grey Wolves. The lawsuit was canceled in 2008 due to the statute of limitation. =Bah√ßelievler massacre= A group of nationalists under the leadership of Abdullah √áatlƒ± killed seven leftist students on 9 October 1978. √áatlƒ± was convicted in absentia. =Kahramanmara≈ü massacre= On 23‚Äì24 December 1978, 111 Alevi people were killed. Unofficial figures are much higher. Martial law was declared afterwards, and the 1980 coup followed.

He was former Director of the Office of Political Reform of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Policy Secretary of Zhao Ziyang, Chinese Premier from 1980 to 1987 and CPC General Secretary from 1987 to 1989. He was also Director of the Drafting Committee for the CPC 13th Party Congresses, known for its strong support for market reform and opening up under Deng Xiaoping. Prior to this, he was a committee member and then Deputy Director of the Chinese State Commission for Economic Reform.  Biography  = Early Life = Bao was born in Haining, Zhejiang Province, but grew up in Shanghai. He currently lives in Beijing with his wife Jiang Zongcao, his daughter Bao Jian, and granddaughter Bao Yangyang. His son, Bao Pu, lives abroad. = Career = Bao was Director of the Office of Political Reform of the CPC Central Committee and the Policy Secretary of Zhao Ziyang, Chinese Premier from 1980 to 1987 and CPC General Secretary from 1987 to 1989. He was Director of the Drafting Committee for the CPC 13th Party Congresses, prior to which he was a committee member and then Deputy Director of the Chinese State Commission for Economic Reform. Bao was the political secretary of the Politburo Standing Committee between November 1987 and May 1989. = End of Government Career = On May 28, 1989, he was arrested in Beijing just before the suppression of the democracy movement in Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989. Zhao Ziyang had resigned as General Secretary of the Communist Party of China in protest when Deng Xiaoping made the decision to crack down on the students. Bao Tong was a close associate of Zhao and the writer of his speeches and editorials supporting a democratic and legal approach to the student movement. Zhao was held under house arrest for the rest of his life, while Bao Tong was officially charged with \\"revealing state secrets and counter-revolutionary propagandizing\\", the highest government official to be charged in relation to the 1989 movement. He was publicly convicted in 1992 in a brief show trial and sentenced to 7 seven years' imprisonment with 2 years deprivation of political rights. He served his full sentence in isolation at Qincheng Prison. On May 27, 1996, when he was due to be released upon completing his prison sentence, he was instead held at a government compound in Xishan (outside Beijing) for an additional year, until his family agreed to move out of their apartment in town to one allocated for them by the authorities, where a 24-hour guarded gate and surveillance cameras were installed. Visitors were screened, the phone was tapped or cut off entirely, and Bao Tong was followed by an entourage of men the moment he stepped out of his home. Though he has moved to another apartment in Beijing, the system of surveillance and curtailing his phone calls, visitors and movements has followed him to his new home. = Later Life = Bao Tong appealed for the restoration of civil and political rights of Zhao Ziyang from 1998 until Zhao's death. He was instrumental to the publication in May 2009 of Zhao Ziyang's memoir, based on audiotapes that Zhao made secretly while under house arrest and discovered after his death in 2005. Bao Tong's son Bao Pu, and daughter-in-law Renee Chiang, published the book Journey of Reform (ÊîπÈù©Ê≠∑Á®ã) in Hong Kong and translated and edited (along with Adi Ignatius) an English version of this book entitled Prisoner of the State: The Secret Journal of Premier Zhao Ziyang. Bao Tong wrote an introduction for the Chinese version. Bao Tong continues to write articles openly critical of the government and its policies. He supports further democratic development in Hong Kong and continues to voice the need for political reform in China. He was a signer of the Charter 08 manifesto and calls for the release of Liu Xiaobo, an organiser of the charter who was arrested in December 2008. On January 19, 2005, the Washington Post reported that Bao Tong and his wife were injured in attacks by more than 20 plainclothes security agents as they attempted to leave their home to pay their respect to the family of Zhao Ziyang, who died on January 17. The authorities would only allow him access to a doctor if he removed a white flower pinned to his vest. He refused. (Note that the white flower is a traditional symbol of mourning) His wife, pushed to the ground by a policeman, fractured a bone in her spine that had her hospitalized for 3 months. On January 1, 2007, Reuters tested a new government relaxing of regulations on foreign reporters by visiting Bao Tong at his home, purportedly to conduct an interview about the Beijing Olympics. Since then, several foreign reporters have done the same. The guards sometimes attempt to intimidate or deny visitation, but are apparently allowing most foreign reporters to enter, if prior arrangements are made. Local Chinese reporters are not included in this new relaxation of regulations. Sky News reporter Peter Sharp describes his visit to Bao Tong in his blog. Their home telephone continues to be tapped and periodically cut off, especially when overseas callers ask to speak to Bao Tong. He is followed everywhere he goes, and is occasionally blocked from ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù events or places, for example, the home of Zhao Ziyang while he was alive, and his funeral after his death in 2005. Bao has been allowed to leave Beijing on three occasions since his arrest in 1989, the last time in 2009 for a holiday by invitation and escort of the Public Security from May 22 to June 7, neatly avoiding the 20th anniversary of the Tiananmen Massacre. Visits from his son, Bao Pu, a resident of Hong Kong, are permitted by special arrangements only; under normal circumstances of application, he is unable to obtain a visa.

He played 12 seasons from 1959 to 1971, 11 with the Green Bay Packers and one with the Washington Redskins. Born in Rock Springs, Wyoming, Dowler grew up in Cheyenne, where his father Walter was a high school history teacher, who was also a former football coach who had played college football at Wyoming. Boyd was a three- sport athlete at Cheyenne High School. He played college football at the University of Colorado as a single-wing quarterback under head coach Dal Ward. Dowler led the Big Seven conference in receiving as a junior in 1957, but spent more time as a passer and runner during his senior season. While at Colorado, he was a member of Delta Tau Delta fraternity. The 25th overall pick in the 1959 NFL Draft, Dowler was the NFL rookie of the year in 1959, Vince Lombardi's first season as head coach. Dowler was a two-time Pro Bowler in 1965 and 1967, and a key contributor on the Packers dynasty in the 1960s, assisting the team to five NFL championship wins and victories in Super Bowls I and II. A late hit by Dallas Cowboys defensive back Mike Gaechter in the end zone following a third quarter touchdown catch resulted in a shoulder injury in the 1966 NFL Championship Game. Dowler aggravated the shoulder early in the first quarter of the first Super Bowl two weeks later, allowing seldom-used Max McGee to be a significant contributor in the game with two touchdown catches. Dowler made a big impact the following year in Super Bowl II with a 62-yard touchdown reception from quarterback Bart Starr in the first half. He finished the game as the top receiver for the Packers, with two receptions for 71 yards and a touchdown. Dowler is a member of the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame and the NFL 1960s All-Decade Team. After eleven seasons with the Packers ending in 1969, Dowler played one year for the Washington Redskins in 1971. Dowler retired with a career record of 474 receptions for 7,270 yards and 40 touchdowns. He led the Packers in receptions for seven seasons. Dowler is currently a scout for the Atlanta Falcons.

It has extensive panoramic views of Auckland from its location in the southeastern portion of the city's urban area. It is also known as Te Pane o Mataaho. The volcano features two large craters. It has a wide crater with a lava dome near its centre, a feature shared by no other volcano in Auckland. It last erupted approximately 70,000 years ago. The mountain is one of the largest and best preserved of Auckland's volcanic cones. Many archaeological features remain, including kumara pits, garden terraces, walled garden mounds and stone boundary walls. Near the mountain to the southwest is Mangere Lagoon, filling another volcanic crater. File:Mangere Mountain Central Crater Cone II.jpgThe central lava dome, or tholoid.

She was born in Kyoto, Japan, and is the younger sister of singer Koda Kumi.  Career  In 2000, Misono participated in the summer vacation audition organized by Japanese label Avex, and was subsequently chosen by the label to become one of their artists. In 2002, she debuted as the vocalist of Day After Tomorrow (dat), a J-pop band formed by the Avex Trax label under the production of Mitsuru Igarashi. Only five months after their debut, they received the Newcomer of the Year award at the Japan Record Awards. In August 2015, after the release of their first greatest hits album, dat went on a indefinite hiatus. In 2006, Misono debuted as a solo artist with the release of her first single, \\"VS\\", which was used as theme song for Nintendo DS videogame Tales of the Tempest, following previous songs by day after tomorrow that were used in this videogame franchise. The single debuted at number 4 on the Oricon charts. During this period, misono used classical Western fairy tales as inspiration for her visuals in music videos and promotional photographs, using themes such as Snow White (\\"VS\\"), Cinderella (\\"Kojin Jugy≈ç\\"), The Ugly Duckling (\\"Speedrive\\"), and Peter Pan for her first studio album, Never+Land, released on February 2, 2007. After the release of her first album, misono's music style switch into more punk rock- oriented pop songs. Three singles, produced by Straightener's Hidekazu Hinata, GO!GO!7188, and Onsoku Line, respectively, were released between September 2007 and January 2008. These songs were subsequently part of misono's second studio album, Say, which was released on July 16, 2008. In November 2007, misono became a recurrent guest in Fuji TV variety show Quiz! Hexagon II, and during these period she participated in said show's comedic units \\"Misono & Hiroshi\\" with Hiroshi Shinagawa, and \\"Satoda Mai with G≈çda Ky≈çdai\\" with Mai Satoda and Toshifumi Fujimoto. On March 31, 2009, misono collaborated with her sister Kumi Koda for \\"It's All Love!\\", which became her single to top the Oricon charts and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan. Between 2009 and 2013, Misono released two cover albums, on which she covered several anisongs and popular songs by artists such as Avril Lavigne, Mayo Okamoto, Sayuri Ishikawa, as well as self-covers of day after tomorrow. She also released two mini compilations of her songs used for the Tales saga, and her third studio album, Me, on June 30, 2010. Misono released her forth studio album, Uchi, on her 30th birthday, on October 13, 2014. The album became a topic on social media due to an official note added to the album title which said \\"If the album doesn't sell 10k copies, misono won't be able to release another CD.\\" The album failed to sell over 10k copies and questions were raised about Misono's possible retirement. However, she stated that that was not the case; she would just stop releasing albums, but she would not retire from the entertainment business. Her contract with Avex Management ended on October 31, 2018.  Personal life  On July 16, 2017, Misono married Shinnosuke Nakamura, who is the drummer for Japanese rock band HighsidE.

The Common Booster Core is long, has a diameter of and is powered by a single RS-68 engine burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. The first static test firing of a Common Booster Core was conducted on 17 March 2001, and the final test of the initial programme was conducted on 6 May. Testing was conducted using Test Stand B-2 of the Stennis Space Center, a facility originally constructed for testing of the first stages of Saturn V rockets during the 1960s. The first launch of a Common Booster Core was the maiden flight of the Delta IV, which was launched from Space Launch Complex 37B at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on 20 November 2002. The first flight of the Delta IV Heavy, featuring three Common Booster Cores, was conducted on 21 December 2004. On this flight all three CBCs malfunctioned, cutting off prematurely due to cavitation in their oxidizer lines, and resulting in the rocket reaching a lower orbit than that which had been planned. In response to the failure, additional pressure valves were installed on future launches. As of December 2014, the Delta IV has made 28 flights; twenty in Medium and Medium+ configurations, and eight in the Heavy configuration, resulting in a total of 44 Common Booster Cores being launched.

In the UK, the term refers to a method of testing anvils. Black powder was poured onto the top of the anvil and ignited. If the anvil did not shatter it was deemed safe to use.  Method  A prepared anvil. Gun powder is in a chamber between the anvils and visco fuse Typically, two anvils are used: one as a base (placed upside down), and another one (also known as the \\"flier\\") as the projectile (placed right-side up, atop the base). An alternative method is to place the bottom anvil upright, and fill the hardy hole with black powder. A torus or washer, often made from a playing card, is placed over the hole, with a space for a fuse or powder trail. The top anvil is placed upside down, face to face with the bottom anvil. A technique for firing a single anvil uses a stone base. The space formed by the anvil's concave base is filled with black powder. Modern double-base powders have much higher energy densities, making them unsuitable. A fuse is made to project out, then lit, and the resulting deflagration sends the projectile anvil several feet into the air. Anvils were traditionally fired on St. Clement's Day, honoring Pope Clement I, the patron saint of blacksmiths and metalworkers. Although its practice has lessened in recent years, enthusiasts still participate in anvil launching events and competitions. On September 5, 2011, The Science Channel premiered Flying Anvils, a reality television series about anvil firing. Dangers Individuals may be crushed by a falling anvil. The black powder can also prematurely ignite when the top anvil is placed. As in any case where an explosive is confined on all sides by metal, shrapnel presents a hazard. If a damaged or structurally weak anvil is used, the anvil base may shatter upon ignition. Physics and chemistry The technique depends on the fact that black powder is a low explosive, which burns more rapidly when under pressure. Historical uses A 21 anvil salute replaced the traditional 21 gun salute on Victoria Day 1860 in New Westminster, British Columbia, after the town's cannon and status as capital of British Columbia was taken away. On November 7, 1864 during the American Civil War, the commander of the Iowa Home Guard militia in Davis County, Iowa, having no artillery piece at his disposal, ordered a local citizen to fire an anvil in the county seat at Bloomfield to alert militiamen in outlying townships in response to intelligence received of the presence of Confederate bushwhackers in Davis County. This was in response to a report of two suspected Confederate guerrillas at a residence in the neighborhood where they had demanded money and food and had terrorized the occupants, Mr. and Mrs. Gore. The private citizen who carried out the order to fire the anvil was seriously injured.Report of Lieutenant Colonel S.A. Moore, Iowa Home Guard, January 1, 1865 in A History of Davis County Iowa, 1886, pp 556‚Äì566. One noteworthy celebration was held on the day the state of Texas voted to secede from the Union.

It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Wielbark. It lies approximately south of Szczytno and south-east of the regional capital Olsztyn. It is part of historic Masuria.  History  The official site of the county of Wielbark gmina states that the first signs of human settlement date before the arrival of the Teutonic Knights, and that the first named settlement mentioned in the area is called Bartniki. This location along with the settlement located near castle-called Karczmarska Wioska, gave birth to Wielbark according to the county's site.Wielbark official site history section The German name of the settlement, ‚ÄúWildhaus‚Äù (\\"wild game house\\"), is first mentioned in 1361 of the Teutonic Order at the southern border of the Teutonic Order State Willenberg (Wildenberg) consisted only of a few buildings when it was founded by komtur Frederic von Willenberg. It remained within the Teutonic Order state after the Second Peace of Thorn (1466), although as a fief of Poland. Later on, it became a part of the Crown of Poland fief of Ducal Prussia with the adoption of the Lutheran faith by Albert of Prussia in 1525. A Protestant church was mentioned in 1557 and the settlement was called a small town in 1647. In 1656, throughout the Second Northern War, Willenberg, like many towns in Masuria, was destroyed by Crimean Tatars. In the 18th century the town was a center of cloth manufacturing and benefited from its location at the main road from Warsaw to K√∂nigsberg (Kr√≥lewiec), with the main trade focused on Russian held Poland, according to the webpage of the Wielbark gmina. The settlement was granted town rights on 21 July 1723. Fires destroyed the town in 1743 and 1763. =19th century= In January 1807 70,000 Napoleonic soldiers traversed the town and had to be supplied. Napoleon headquartered here from 21 January to 2 February prior to the Battle of Eylau. The French troops caused a fire which damaged the town furthermore. In 1813 Tsar Alexander I of Russia received the official message of the Prussian accession to the struggle against Napoleon by General von Kleist at Willenberg. The Prussian administration reform of 1818 made the town part of Landkreis Ortelsburg (Szczytno). On 23 September 1819 and on 9 June 1834 the town was again damaged by fire and in 1831 and 1852 cholera caused many casualties. The gmina‚Äôs webpage states that in 1823 a crisis happened when the authorities of Congress Poland introduced high custom tariffs on imports, reaching 60% to 80%, which brought large losses to the population in the town, mainly engaged in cloths trade. Despite this, the local fairs attracted large attendance of merchants from Masuria and Russian-controlled Poland, said to be the largest fairs at the time in the Masuria region. A new Protestant Church was built in 1827, based on plans of Karl Friedrich Schinkel. The area played a role in Polish preparations for uprising against Russian Empire. Hoping to gain assistance from the population of Warmia, uprising plans from 1845-1846 hoped to establish seven main camps on border between Prussia and Russia, with one of them located near Willenberg, to which two Polish units, including one from Allenstein (Olsztyn) and one from Ortelsburg, would be directed, to attack Myszniec later on.≈öwiadomo≈õƒá narodowa na Warmii w XIX wieku:narodziny i rozw√≥j Janusz Jasi≈Ñski Pojezierze, 1983 page 202 During the January Uprising Polish units operated in the area, and in January 1864 a unit of Olsza≈Ñski- Ostrorog numbering 300 soldiers established a camp near the town.Dzieje Warmii i Mazur w zarysie Jerzy Sikorski 1981 Pa≈Ñstwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe pages 300, 356, 362 Local population itself engaged in smuggling of weapons to Polish resistance across the border.Historia Warmii i Mazur: od pradziej√≥w do 1945 roku Stanis≈Çaw Achremczyk O≈õrodek Bada≈Ñ Nauk. im.

On August 30, 1914, 16,100 Russian soldiers were captured in a battle near Willenberg. The commander of the Russian Second Army, General Samsonov, committed suicide in a forest just south of Willenberg. During the Polish-Soviet war, a plebiscite was organized to determine if the town should remain in Germany or be attached to Poland. On July 11, 1920, 1,581 citizens voted to remain in Weimar Germany‚Äôs East Prussia and 24 to join the Second Polish Republic in the East Prussian plebiscite.

After World War II the remaining German populace was expelled and the area was assigned to Poland. The Polish Commission for the Determination of Place Names gave it the name of Wielbark, the name by which it had been known in Polish before the war.

It is part of the municipality of Anzio. History The name is derived from ancient Latin settlement of Lavinium, now from the sea, and part of the nearby municipality of Pomezia. The foundation of Lavinium is mentioned prominently in the great Roman epic, the Aeneid by the Mantuan poet Publius Vergilius Maro (Virgil). Lavinio adjoins the regional park of Tor Caldara, which features a medieval watch tower that was built in the Middle Ages to defend the area from the frequent incursions of Saracens and later from the Arabic pirates. In 1565 the tower was restored by Marcantonio Colonna, of the powerful noble family and large fief holders in Lazio and the Papal States. Sulfur was also mined there in the 16th century. In 1999 the ruins of an ancient Roman villa were discovered adjacent to the tower. The park features evergreen oak trees and Mediterranean vegetation that before commercial development extended along the whole coastline of the region. Characteristic springs and water courses can be found in the area.Tor Caldara, Monte Cassino Battlefield Tour, www.montecassinotour.com, Retrieved July 19, 2010. During World War II, Allied soldiers fought and died on the beach and in the surrounding countryside of this town. On January 22, 1944 it was the approximate location of the British beachhead landing during the Battle of Anzio, part of the Allied advance to Rome. A greater number of American forces landed in Anzio and Nettuno, south. A total of 110,000 troops landed. As a perennial memory, a marble stele, elevated and in front of the sea, remembers this sacrifice.

Methodological naturalism is a philosophical basis for science, for which metaphysical naturalism provides only one possible ontological foundation. Broadly, the corresponding theological perspective is religious naturalism or spiritual naturalism. More specifically, metaphysical naturalism rejects the supernatural concepts and explanations that are part of many religions. Definition According to Steven Schafersman, geologist and president of Texas Citizens for Science, metaphysical naturalism is a philosophy that maintains that: 1. Nature encompasses all that exists throughout space and time; 2. Nature (the universe or cosmos) consists only of natural elements, that is, of spatiotemporal physical substance‚Äîmass‚Äìenergy. Non-physical or quasi-physical substance, such as information, ideas, values, logic, mathematics, intellect, and other emergent phenomena, either supervene upon the physical or can be reduced to a physical account; 3. Nature operates by the laws of physics and in principle, can be explained and understood by science and philosophy; and 4. the supernatural does not exist, i.e., only nature is real. Naturalism is therefore a metaphysical philosophy opposed primarily by Biblical creationism. Carl Sagan put it succinctly: \\"The Cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be.\\" According to Arthur C. Danto, naturalism, in recent usage, is a species of philosophical monism according to which whatever exists or happens is natural in the sense of being susceptible to explanation through methods which, although paradigmatically exemplified in the natural sciences, are continuous from domain to domain of objects and events. Hence, naturalism is polemically defined as repudiating the view that there exists or could exist any entities which lie, in principle, beyond the scope of scientific explanation. Editor \\"Personally, I place great emphasis on the phrase \\"in principle,\\" since there are many things that science does not now explain. And perhaps we need some natural piety concerning the ontological limit question as to why there is anything at all. But the idea that naturalism is a polemical notion is important.\\" Regarding the vagueness of the general term \\"naturalism,\\" David Papineau traces the current usage to philosophers in early 20th century America such as John Dewey, Ernest Nagel, Sidney Hook, and Roy Wood Sellars: \\"So understood, 'naturalism' is not a particularly informative term as applied to contemporary philosophers. The great majority of contemporary philosophers would happily accept naturalism as just characterized‚Äîthat is, they would both reject 'supernatural' entities, and allow that science is a possible route (if not necessarily the only one) to important truths about the 'human spirit.'\\" Papineau remarks that philosophers widely regard naturalism as a \\"positive\\" term, and \\"few active philosophers nowadays are happy to announce themselves as 'non-naturalists,'\\" while noting that \\"philosophers concerned with religion tend to be less enthusiastic about 'naturalism'\\" and that despite an \\"inevitable\\" divergence due to its popularity, if more narrowly construed, (to the chagrin of John McDowell, David Chalmers and Jennifer Hornsby, for example), those not so disqualified remain nonetheless content \\"to set the bar for 'naturalism' higher.\\" Philosopher and theologian Alvin Plantinga, a well-known critic of naturalism in general, comments: \\"Naturalism is presumably not a religion. In one very important respect, however, it resembles religion: it can be said to perform the cognitive function of a religion. There is that range of deep human questions to which a religion typically provides an answer ... Like a typical religion, naturalism gives a set of answers to these and similar questions\\". =Methodological naturalism= Metaphysical naturalism is an approach to metaphysics or ontology, which deals with existence per se. It should not be confused with methodological naturalism, which sees empiricism as the basis for the scientific method. Regarding science and evolution, Eugenie C. Scott, a notable opponent of teaching creationism or intelligent design in US public schools, stresses the importance of separating metaphysical from methodological naturalism: Science and naturalism Metaphysical naturalism is the philosophical basis of science as described by Kate and Vitaly (2000). \\"There are certain philosophical assumptions made at the base of the scientific method ‚Äì namely, 1) that reality is objective and consistent, 2) that humans have the capacity to perceive reality accurately, and that 3) rational explanations exist for elements of the real world. These assumptions are the basis of naturalism, the philosophy on which science is grounded. Philosophy is at least implicitly at the core of every decision we make or position we take, it is obvious that correct philosophy is a necessity for scientific inquiry to take place.\\" Steven Schafersman, agrees that methodological naturalism is \\"the adoption or assumption of philosophical naturalism within scientific method with or without fully accepting or believing it ... science is not metaphysical and does not depend on the ultimate truth of any metaphysics for its success, but methodological naturalism must be adopted as a strategy or working hypothesis for science to succeed. We may therefore be agnostic about the ultimate truth of naturalism, but must nevertheless adopt it and investigate nature as if nature is all that there is.\\" Contrary to other notable opponents of teaching Creationism or Intelligent Design in US public schools such as Eugenie Scott, Schafersman asserts that \\"while science as a process only requires methodological naturalism, I think that the assumption of methodological naturalism by scientists and others logically and morally entails ontological naturalism\\". as well as the similarly controversial assertion: \\"I maintain that the practice or adoption of methodological naturalism entails a logical and moral belief in ontological naturalism, so they are not logically decoupled.\\" On the other hand, Scott argues: However, there are other controversies, Arthur Newell Strahler embeds peculiar anthropic distinctions in the name of naturalism: \\"The naturalistic view is that the particular universe we observe came into existence and has operated through all time and in all its parts without the impetus or guidance of any supernatural agency. The naturalistic view is espoused by science as its fundamental assumption.\\" Variously known as background independence, the cosmological principle, the principle of universality, the principle of uniformity, or uniformitarianism, there are important philosophical assumptions that cannot be derived from nature. According to Stephen Jay Gould, \\"You cannot go to a rocky outcrop and observe either the constancy of nature's laws or the working of unknown processes. It works the other way around. You first assume these propositions and \\"then you go to the outcrop of rock.\\" \\"The assumption of spatial and temporal invariance of natural laws is by no means unique to geology since it amounts to a warrant for inductive inference which, as Bacon showed nearly four hundred years ago, is the basic mode of reasoning in empirical science. Without assuming this spatial and temporal invariance, we have no basis for extrapolating from the known to the unknown and, therefore, no way of reaching general conclusions from a finite number of observations. (Since the assumption is itself vindicated by induction, it can in no way \\"prove\\" the validity of induction‚Äîan endeavor virtually abandoned after Hume demonstrated its futility two centuries ago).\\" Gould also notes that natural processes such as Lyell's \\"uniformity of process\\" are an assumption: \\"As such, it is another a priori assumption shared by all scientists and not a statement about the empirical world.\\" Such assumptions across time and space are needed for scientists to extrapolate into the unobservable past, according to G.G. Simpson: \\"Uniformity is an unprovable postulate justified, or indeed required, on two grounds. First, nothing in our incomplete but extensive knowledge of history disagrees with it. Second, only with this postulate is a rational interpretation of history possible, and we are justified in seeking‚Äîas scientists we must seek‚Äîsuch a rational interpretation.\\" and according to R. Hooykaas: \\"The principle of uniformity is not a law, not a rule established after comparison of facts, but a principle, preceding the observation of facts ... It is the logical principle of parsimony of causes and of economy of scientific notions. By explaining past changes by analogy with present phenomena, a limit is set to conjecture, for there is only one way in which two things are equal, but there are an infinity of ways in which they could be supposed different.\\" Various associated beliefs Contemporary naturalists possess a wide diversity of beliefs within metaphysical naturalism. Most metaphysical naturalists have adopted some form of materialism or physicalism. =Origin of the Universe, Solar System formation, Earth's geological history, abiogenesis, and evolution= According to metaphysical naturalism, if nature is all there is, just as natural cosmological processes, e.g. quantum fluctuations from a multiverse, lead to the Big Bang, and stellar nucleosynthesis brought upon the earliest chemical elements, the formation of the Solar System and the processes involved in abiogenesis arose from natural causes.Richard Carrier, [The Argument from Biogenesis: Probabilities Against a Natural Origin of Life], Biology and Philosophy 19.5 (November 2004), pp. 739-64. Naturalists reason about how, not if evolution happened. They maintain that humanity's existence is not by intelligent design but rather a natural process of emergence. With the protoplanetary disk creating planetary bodies, including the Sun and moon, conditions for life to arise billions of years ago, along with the natural formation of plate tectonics, the atmosphere, land masses, and the origin of oceans would also contribute to the kickstarting of biological evolution to occur after the arrival of the earliest organisms, as evidenced through the geological time scale. =The mind is a natural phenomenon= Metaphysical naturalists do not believe in a soul or spirit, nor in ghosts, and when explaining what constitutes the mind they rarely appeal to substance dualism. If one's mind, or rather one's identity and existence as a person, is entirely the product of natural processes, three conclusions follow according to W.T. Stace. Evolutionary psychology and neurobiology would be able to provide accounts of how cultural and psychological phenomena, such as religion, morality, emotions, politics, art, and more, evolved through natural processes. Consciousness itself would also be susceptible to the same evolutionary principles that select other traits.Stace, W.T, Mysticism and Philosophy. N.Y.: Macmillan, 1960; reprinted, Los Angeles: Jeremy P. Tarcher, 1987. =Utility of intelligence and reason= Metaphysical naturalists hold that intelligence is the refinement and improvement of naturally evolved faculties. The certitude of deductive logic remains unexplained by this essentially probabilistic view. Nevertheless, naturalists believe anyone who wishes to have more beliefs that are true than are false should seek to perfect and consistently employ their reason in testing and forming beliefs. Empirical methods (especially those of proven use in the sciences) are unsurpassed for discovering the facts of reality, while methods of pure reason alone can securely discover logical errors. History =Ancient and medieval philosophy= Naturalism was the foundation of two (Vaisheshika, Nyaya) of the six orthodox schools and one (Carvaka) heterodox school of Hinduism.A Chatterjee (2012), Naturalism in Classical Indian Philosophy, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)Dale Riepe (1996), Naturalistic Tradition in Indian Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, , pp. 227‚Äì246 The Carvaka, Nyaya, Vaisheshika schools originated in the 7th, 6th, and 2nd century BCE, respectively.Oliver Leaman (1999), Key Concepts in Eastern Philosophy. Routledge, , page 269 Western metaphysical naturalism originated in ancient Greek philosophy. The earliest pre-Socratic philosophers, especially the Milesians (Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes) and the atomists (Leucippus and Democritus), were labeled by their peers and successors \\"the physikoi\\" (from the Greek œÜœÖœÉŒπŒ∫œåœÇ or physikos, meaning \\"natural philosopher,\\" borrowing on the word œÜœçœÉŒπœÇ or physis, meaning \\"nature\\") because they investigated natural causes, often excluding any role for gods in the creation or operation of the world. This eventually led to fully developed systems such as Epicureanism, which sought to explain everything that exists as the product of atoms falling and swerving in a void. Aristotle surveyed the thought of his predecessors and conceived of nature in a way that charted a middle course between their excesses.See especially Physics, books I and II. With the rise and dominance of Christianity in the West and the later spread of Islam, metaphysical naturalism was generally abandoned by intellectuals. Thus, there is little evidence for it in medieval philosophy. The reintroduction of Aristotle's empirical epistemology as well as previously lost treatises by Greco-Roman natural philosophers which was begun by the medieval Scholastics without resulting in any noticeable increase in commitment to naturalism. =Modern philosophy= It was not until the early modern era of philosophy and the Age of Enlightenment that naturalists like Benedict Spinoza (who put forward a theory of psychophysical parallelism), David Hume,William Edward Morris, \\"David Hume\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (21 May 2014), Edward N. Zalta (ed.) and the proponents of French materialism (notably Denis Diderot, Julien La Mettrie, and Baron d'Holbach) started to emerge again in the 17th and 18th centuries. In this period, some metaphysical naturalists adhered to a distinct doctrine, materialism, which became the dominant category of metaphysical naturalism widely defended until the end of the 19th century. Immanuel Kant rejected (reductionist) materialist positions in metaphysics, but he was not hostile to naturalism. His transcendental philosophy is considered to be a form of liberal naturalism.Hanna, Robert, Kant, Science, and Human Nature. Clarendon Press, 2006, p. 16. In late modern philosophy, Naturphilosophie, a form of natural philosophy, was developed by Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von SchellingFrederick C. Beiser(2002), German Idealism: The Struggle Against Subjectivism 1781-1801, Harvard university Press, p. 506. and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel as an attempt to comprehend nature in its totality and to outline its general theoretical structure. A version of naturalism that arose after Hegel was Ludwig Feuerbach's anthropological materialism,Axel Honneth, Hans Joas, Social Action and Human Nature, Cambridge University Press, 1988, p. 18. which influenced Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels's historical materialism, Engels's \\"materialist dialectic\\" philosophy of nature (Dialectics of Nature), and their follower Georgi Plekhanov's dialectical materialism.See Georgi Plekhanov, \\"For the Sixtieth Anniversary of Hegel's Death\\" (1891). See also Plekhanov, Essays on the History of Materialism (1893) and Plekhanov, The Development of the Monist View of History (1895). Another notable school of late modern philosophy advocating naturalism was German materialism: members included Ludwig B√ºchner, Jacob Moleschott, and Carl Vogt.Owen Chadwick, The Secularization of the European Mind in the Nineteenth Century, Cambridge University Press, 1990, p. 165: \\"During the 1850s German ... scientists conducted a controversy known ... as the materialistic controversy. It was specially associated with the names of Vogt, Moleschott and B√ºchner\\" and p. 173: \\"Frenchmen were surprised to see B√ºchner and Vogt. ... [T]he French were surprised at German materialism\\".The Nineteenth Century and After, Vol. 151, 1952, p. 227: \\"the Continental materialism of Moleschott and Buchner\\". =Contemporary philosophy= In the early 20th century, matter was found to be a form of energy and therefore not fundamental as materialists had assumed. (See History of physics.) In contemporary analytic philosophy, renewed attention to the problem of universals, philosophy of mathematics, the development of mathematical logic, and the post-positivist revival of metaphysics and the philosophy of religion, initially by way of Wittgensteinian linguistic philosophy, further called the naturalistic paradigm into question. Developments such as these, along with those within science and the philosophy of science brought new advancements and revisions of naturalistic doctrines by naturalistic philosophers into metaphysics, ethics, the philosophy of language, the philosophy of mind, epistemology, etc., the products of which include physicalism and eliminative materialism, supervenience, causal theories of reference, anomalous monism, naturalized epistemology (e.g. reliabilism), internalism and externalism, ethical naturalism, and property dualism, for example. A politicized version of naturalism that has arisen in contemporary philosophy is Ayn Rand's Objectivism. Objectivism is an expression of capitalist ethical idealism within a naturalistic framework. The current usage of the term naturalism \\"derives from debates in America in the first half of the last century. The self-proclaimed 'naturalists' from that period included John Dewey, Ernest Nagel, Sidney Hook and Roy Wood Sellars.\\"Papineau, David \\"Naturalism\\", in \\"The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\\" Currently, metaphysical naturalism is more widely embraced than in previous centuries, especially but not exclusively in the natural sciences and the Anglo-American, analytic philosophical communities. While the vast majority of the population of the world remains firmly committed to non-naturalistic worldviews, prominent contemporary defenders of naturalism and/or naturalistic theses and doctrines today include J. J. C. Smart, David Malet Armstrong, David Papineau, Paul Kurtz, Brian Leiter, Daniel Dennett, Michael Devitt, Fred Dretske, Paul and Patricia Churchland, Mario Bunge, Jonathan Schaffer, Hilary Kornblith, Quentin Smith, Paul Draper and Michael Martin, among many other academic philosophers. According to David Papineau, contemporary naturalism is a consequence of the build-up of scientific evidence during the twentieth century for the \\"causal closure of the physical\\", the doctrine that all physical effects can be accounted for by physical causes.David Papineau, \\"The Rise of Physicalism\\" in Physicalism and its Discontents, Cambridge (2011). According to Steven Schafersman, president of Texas Citizens for Science, an advocacy group opposing creationism in public schools, the progressive adoption of methodological naturalism‚Äîand later of metaphysical naturalism‚Äîfollowed the advances of science and the increase of its explanatory power. These advances also caused the diffusion of positions associated with metaphysical naturalism, such as existentialism. In contemporary continental philosophy, Quentin Meillassoux proposed speculative materialism, a post-Kantian return to David Hume which can strengthen classical materialist ideas.Quentin Meillassoux (2008), After Finitude, Bloomsbury, p. 90. Arguments for metaphysical naturalism =Argument from physical minds= In the context of creation and evolution debates, Internet Infidels co-founder Jeffery Jay Lowder argues against what he calls \\"the argument from bias\\", that a priori, the supernatural is merely ruled out due to an unexamined stipulation. Lowder believes \\"there are good empirical reasons for believing that metaphysical naturalism is true, and therefore a denial of the supernatural need not be based upon an a priori assumption\\". Several metaphysical naturalists have used the trends in scientific discoveries about minds to argue that no supernatural minds exist. Jeffery Jay Lowder says, \\"Since all known mental activity has a physical basis, there are probably no disembodied minds. But God is conceived of as a disembodied mind. Therefore, God probably does not exist.\\" Lowder argues the correlation between mind and brain implies that supernatural souls do not exist because the theist position, according to Lowder, is that the mind depends upon this soul instead of the brain. =Argument from cognitive biases= In contrast with the argument from reason or evolutionary argument against naturalism, it can be argued that cognitive biases are better explained by natural causes than as the work of God. Arguments against Arguments against metaphysical naturalism include the following examples. =Argument from reason= Philosophers and scientists such as Victor Reppert, William Hasker, and Alvin Plantinga have developed an argument for dualism dubbed the \\"argument from reason.\\" They credit C.S. Lewis with first bringing the argument to light in his book Miracles; Lewis called the argument \\"The Cardinal Difficulty of Naturalism,\\" which was the title of chapter three of Miracles.Victor Reppert C.S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea. Downers Grove, Illinois: InterVarsity Press, 2003. The argument postulates that if, as naturalism entails, all of our thoughts are the effect of a physical cause, then we have no reason for assuming that they are also the consequent of a reasonable ground. However, knowledge is apprehended by reasoning from ground to consequent. Therefore, if naturalism were true, there would be no way of knowing it (or anything else), except by a fluke. Through this logic, the statement \\"I have reason to believe naturalism is valid\\" is inconsistent in the same manner as \\"I never tell the truth.\\" That is, to conclude its truth would eliminate the grounds from which it reaches it. To summarize the argument in the book, Lewis quotes J. B. S. Haldane, who appeals to a similar line of reasoning: In his essay \\"Is Theology Poetry?,\\" Lewis himself summarises the argument in a similar fashion when he writes: But Lewis later agreed with Elizabeth Anscombe's response to his Miracles argument. She showed that an argument could be valid and ground-consequent even if its propositions were generated via physical cause and effect by non-rational factors.The Socratic Digest, No. 4 (1948) Similar to Anscombe, Richard Carrier and John Beversluis have written extensive objections to the argument from reason on the untenability of its first postulate. =Evolutionary argument against naturalism= Notre Dame philosophy of religion professor and Christian apologist Alvin Plantinga argues, in his evolutionary argument against naturalism, that the probability that evolution has produced humans with reliable true beliefs, is low or inscrutable, unless their evolution was guided, for example, by God. According to David Kahan of the University of Glasgow, in order to understand how beliefs are warranted, a justification must be found in the context of supernatural theism, as in Plantinga's epistemology. (See also supernormal stimuli). Plantinga argues that together, naturalism and evolution provide an insurmountable \\"defeater for the belief that our cognitive faculties are reliable\\", i.e., a skeptical argument along the lines of Descartes' evil demon or brain in a vat. Branden Fitelson of the University of California, Berkeley and Elliott Sober of the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison argue that Plantinga must show that the combination of evolution and naturalism also defeats the more modest claim that \\"at least a non-negligible minority of our beliefs are true\\", and that defects such as cognitive bias are nonetheless consistent with being made in the image of a rational God. Whereas evolutionary science already acknowledges that cognitive processes are unreliable, including the fallibility of the scientific enterprise itself, Plantinga's hyperbolic doubt is no more a defeater for naturalism than it is for theistic metaphysics founded upon a non-deceiving God who designed the human mind: \\"[neither] can construct a non-question- begging argument that refutes global skepticism.\\" Plantinga's argument has also been criticized by philosopher Daniel Dennett and independent scholar Richard Carrier who argue that a cognitive apparatus for truth-finding can result from natural selection. =Antinominalist argument against naturalism= Edward Feser, in his 2008 book The Last Superstition: A Refutation of the New Atheism, lays a plenary case against naturalism by re- examining pre-Modern philosophy. Beginning in the second chapter, Feser cites the PlatonicFeser 2008, pp. 31-49 and AristotelianFeser 2008, pp. 53-72 answers to the problem of universals‚Äîthat is, realism. Feser also offers arguments against nominalism.Feser 2008, pp. 44-46 And by defending realism and rejecting nominalism, he rejects eliminative materialism‚Äîand thus naturalism. In the third chapter, Feser summarizes three of Thomas Aquinas's arguments for the existence of God.Feser 2008, pp. 90-119 These include arguments for an unmoved mover,Feser 2008, pp. 91-102 first, uncaused causeFeser 2008, pp. 102-110 and (supernatural) supreme intelligence,Feser 2008, pp. 110-118 concluding that these must exist not as a matter of probability‚Äîas in the intelligent design view, particularly of irreducible complexityFeser 2008, pp. 110-114‚Äîbut as a necessary consequence of \\"obvious, though empirical, starting points\\".Feser 2008, pp. 83 See also * Atheism * Daoism * Dysteleology * Ethical naturalism * Hylomorphism * Liberal naturalism * Naturalist computationalism * Naturalistic fallacy * Naturalistic pantheism * Platonized naturalism * Poetic naturalism * Reductive materialism * Religious naturalism * Revisionary materialism * School of Naturalists * Scientism * Scientistic materialism * Spiritual naturalism * Supernaturalism * Transcendental naturalism Notes References ;Books    ;Journals * ;Web  Further reading =Historical overview= * Edward B.

Early years Neely attended Farmington High School (New Mexico), where he was an All-State tackle for two years in football, and a standout center for the basketball team. He was recruited by the University of Oklahoma, where he played college football under coaches Bud Wilkinson and Gomer Jones. He was a 261-pound tackle who played both ways, as a dominant performer on defense and an excellent blocker on offense. He was named the Big Eight sophomore lineman of the year and was a two-time All-American and an all-conference selection in both 1963 and '64. Neely was one of three Sooners stars who missed the 1965 Gator Bowl game against Florida State University. Neely, fullback Jim Grisham and halfback Lance Rentzel signed with professional teams before the game, and were ruled ineligible for the contest, which Florida State University won 36‚Äì19 on the strength of four touchdown catches by Fred Biletnikoff. Professional career In 1965, he was drafted in the second round of both the 1965 NFL Draft (by the Baltimore Colts) and the 1965 AFL Draft (by the Houston Oilers).

He studied under Dudley Buck in Hartford, Connecticut, counterpoint under Carl August Haupt, and piano under Carl Albert Loeschhorn in Berlin. In 1874-76 he was organist of the First Congregational Church, Chicago; afterward organist and choirmaster of the First Presbyterian Church for 17 years and from 1875 to 1908 was director of the Hershey School of Musical Art. In 1877-79 he gave a series of 100 organ recitals, with entirely different programs, a memorable achievement in American musical annals. He played at several expositions in America and abroad, and gave recitals in the principal American and European cities. He composed several works for the organ, including one method book for instruction.  Studies in Europe  In the summer of 1871, Eddy went to Berlin to study for a period of more than two years. He studied organ and theory with Carl August Haupt, and piano with Carl Albert L√∂schorn. En route to Berlin, Eddy visited England and France, making important connections with distinguished organists such as Alexandre Guilmant, Chalres-Marie Widor, Camille Saint-Sa√´ns, C√©sar Franck, W.T. Best, and others. Reportedly practicing from six to ten hours a day, he had lessons weekly, and also participated in chamber music activities, in addition to concertizing. One 1873 review spoke highly of Eddy‚Äôs performance, stating that ‚Äúall the excellent qualities of the master showed themselves in the playing of the pupil. Massive technique, clearness and certainty, energy in taking the tones and a wonderfully lovely legato.‚Äù Further concerts allowed Eddy to secure the funds necessary to repay the loan which was taken out to enable his European trip. Finally, in the spring of 1874, he returned to the United States after an extensive trip through Holland, Belgium, France, and London.  Return to the United States  Returning to the United States with a letter of recommendation from Haupt, Eddy presided as organist at the First Congregational Church in Chicago. He received praise for his playing of the music he had learned in Europe. In 1879, he took the position of organist at First Presbyterian Church, staying there for 17 years. In 1876, Eddy spent one week in Philadelphia playing recitals three times a day at the Centennial Exposition. During his time in Chicago, he became involved with the Hershey School of Music as general director. It was founded in 1875 by Sara Hershey, and in 1876 the Hershey Music Hall was completed, giving the school the facilities it needed. A three-manual Johnson organ (built to Eddy‚Äôs specifications) was installed for teaching and concert purposes. Inaugural concerts were performed on January 23 and 25 of 1877. Continuing to tour and perform extensively, Eddy remained part of the Chicago music scene, including designing and dedicating the Roosevelt organ in the Auditorium Theatre. Eddy left Chicago in 1895, spending the rest of his life touring, teaching, and concertizing, dedicating over 1000 organs in his career. He later wrote organ method books, and teaching remained part of his career after leaving the Hershey school.  The 100 Recitals  Between 1877 and 1879, Eddy gave over 100 recitals, all with different programs on Sunday afternoons at the Hershey Music Hall. Each recital featured a piece by Bach and a variety of contemporary organ works, including transcriptions. Each recital also had two pieces of non-organ music, typically a vocalist, or chamber music.

They produce several labels of Champagne under the Bollinger name, including the vintage Vieilles Vignes Fran√ßaises, Grande Ann√©e and R.D. as well as the non-vintage Special Cuv√©e. Founded in 1829 in A√ø by Hennequin de Villermont, Paul Renaudin and Jacques Bollinger the house continues to be run by members of the Bollinger family. In Britain Bollinger Champagnes are affectionately known as \\"Bolly\\". History Bollinger has roots in the Champagne region dating back to 1585 when the Hennequins, one of the Bollinger founding families, owned land in Cramant. Before the Bollinger house was founded, in the 18th century the Villermont family practised wine making, though not under their family name. In 1750, Villermont settled in the location 16 rue Jules Lobet, which would eventually become the head office for Bollinger. In 1803 Jacques Joseph Placide Bollinger was born in Ellwangen, in the kingdom of W√ºrttemberg. In 1822, he moved to the Champagne region and began work at the Champagne house of Muller Ruinart, which no longer exists. Many other German nationals came to settle in the Champagne region, including Johann-Josef Krug and the Heidsiecks, who founded a house that would become Charles Heidsieck, Piper Heidsieck, Heidsieck & Co Monopole, Veuve Clicquot and others. The Champagne house Renaudin Bollinger was founded on 6 February 1829 in A√ø by Hennequin de Villermont, Paul Levieux Renaudin and Jacques Bollinger. The partners agreed that the Villermont name would not be used on the labels, hence the house name Renaudin Bollinger. Starting when Jacques Bollinger married Charlotte de Villermont, the house has been managed by the Bollinger family. Even though Paul Renaudin passed without an heir to his name, the label did not become solely Bollinger until the 1960s. Founder Jacques Joseph Bollinger married Charlotte de Villermont. The couple had a daughter, Marie, who had two sons Joseph and Georges. These sons took over the company in 1885 and began expanding the family estate by purchasing vineyards in nearby villages. The sons also developed the image of the brand, such as when Bollinger received a Royal Warrant in 1884 from Queen Victoria. =Expansion under Lily Bollinger= A notice showing Lily Bollinger's saying about champagne (St Peter Port, Guernsey) In 1918 Jacques Bollinger, the son of Georges, took over the company. Jacques married Emily Law de Lauriston Boubers, known as \\"Lily\\". Jacques further expanded the facilities by building new cellars, purchasing the Tauxi√®res vineyards, and acquiring the assets of another Champagne house on Boulevard du Mar√©chal de Lattre de Tassigny‚Äîwhere Bollinger's offices are presently located. When Jacques Bollinger died in 1941, Lily Bollinger took over. Lily expanded production through the purchase of more vineyards, but is better known for traveling the world to promote the brand. Lily was well-publicized in the Champagne region, leaving several noteworthy quotes. > I drink it when I‚Äôm happy and when I‚Äôm sad. Sometimes I drink it when I‚Äôm > alone. When I have company I consider it obligatory. I trifle with it if I‚Äôm > not hungry and drink it when I am. Otherwise, I never touch it‚Äîunless I‚Äôm > thirsty. Lily managed Bollinger until 1971, when her nephews Claude d'Hautefeuille and Christian Bizot succeeded her. =Modern day= Bollinger Champagne house in Ay. Bollinger was modernized under the direction of Claude d'Hautefeuille, who acquired additional vineyards and developed the brand internationally. Following Claude, his cousin Christian Bizot took over the Bollinger house. In addition to expanding the world distribution of Bollinger, Bizot developed a Charter of Ethics and Quality in 1992. Since 1994, Ghislain de Mongolfier has managed Bollinger. A great-grandson of the founder, Mongolfier has also served as president of the Association Viticole Champenoise since 2004, after leading the Commission of Champagne for 10 years. The winemaker has also used the James Bond film series as a marketing device. Wines Bollinger's Special Cuvee Bollinger is one of the fewremaining independent Champagne houses. Family-managed since 1889, Bollinger maintains more than 150 hectares of vineyards. It currently produces the following sparkling wines: *Special Cuv√©e (non-vintage): The Bollinger house style. This Champagne blend uses grapes from a given year, with the addition of reserve wines. Champagne author Tom Stevenson describes the house style as \\"classic, Pinot-dominated Champagnes of great potential longevity and complexity\\" which \\"tends to go toasty.\\" The blend includes up to 10% reserve wines, which may be up to fifteen years old. Special Cuv√©e are aged in the lees for at least 5 years before release. (Composition: 60% Pinot noir, 25% Chardonnay, 15% Pinot Meunier.) *Grande Ann√©e (vintage): this Champagne is also available as a ros√©. The wine spends five years on its lees and is aged in bottle under cork, instead of crown seal. (Composition: 65% Pinot noir, 35% Chardonnay.) *R.D. (vintage): it spends at least eight years on its lees, and like the Grand Ann√©e, is aged under cork, not crown seal. R.D. is a registered trademark of Bollinger which stands for r√©cemment d√©gorg√© (\\"recently disgorged\\"). In the mid-1990s, Bollinger sold Ann√©e Rare, which was an R.D. that had undergone longer aging on the lees. *Vieille Vignes Fran√ßaises (vintage): a blanc de noirs is made in small quantity with wine from two small plots of ungrafted rootstock planted in low density. The English wine writer Cyril Ray suggested the idea of using the ungrafted vines to produce a separate wine to Madame Bollinger in the 1960s.Cyril Ray, Bollinger, tradition of a Champagne family, 2nd ed. 1982 Heinemann The first vintage was 1969. Vieille Vignes refers to how the vines are trained rather than the age of the rootstock. The low-density vineyards, Clos St-Jacques in A√ø and Chaudes Terres in A√ø, are severely pruned, and produce 35% less juice per vine, creating a \\"super rich wine.\\" In 2005, phylloxera destroyed the third vineyard used for this wine, Croix Rouge in Bouzy.. *Coteaux Champenois La C√¥te aux Enfants (vintage): This still red wine is produced from grapes grown on the south-facing slope of the 100% echelle vineyard, the C√¥te aux Enfants in A√ø.Tom Stevenson, Champagne, Sotheby's Publications, 1988 at p. 201. =Reserve wines= Every harvest, Bollinger saves some wines from the grand crus and premier crus for reserve wines. The reserves are bottled in magnums with cork, under light pressure and aged for five to fifteen years. Production Marker for one of Bollinger's estate vineyards. Bollinger is fermented in oak barrels, and at harvest, usually only the first pressing is used, the cuv√©e. Bollinger does sells some second pressings, the tailles. It utilizes two pressing houses, Louvois and Mareuil sur A√ø. The first fermentation is done cru by cru, variety by variety. Wines that will not hold up to first fermentation in wood are vinified in vats. Bollinger Champagnes usually undergo malolactic fermentation, with traditional yeast. Vintage wine, including all wine to be used in a Grande Ann√©e, is fermented in small oak barrels, sorted according to origin and variety. Both oak and stainless steel are used for non-vintage wine. The wines are only lightly filtered. Bollinger ages their non-vintage wines three years, and the vintage wines five to eight years. The Grande Ann√©e and R.D. Champagnes are riddled by hand. At disgorgement, Bollinger wines are given a low dosage. The company uses 6‚Äì9 grams of sugar per liter for the Special Cuv√©e and La Grande Ann√©e. The extra-brut R.D. is dosed between 4 and 5 grams. After dosage, the wines are aged an additional several months, resting for a minimum of three months before shipping. The champagnes are shipped ready to be consumed. =Grape supply= Bollinger owns nearly 160 hectares of vines, producing more than 60% of its supply. The vines are predominantly Pinot noir, specifically clone 386. The vineyards also include some ungrafted French vines from before the phylloxera epidemic. Bollinger owns vines in the heart of the Champagne region, including the crus of A√ø, Bouzy and Verzenay.

He was the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Spain during the Spanish Civil War. Trade unionism Born in Sevilla and a baker by trade since age eleven, at 18 joined La Aurora, the Union of Seville bakers, who soon after joined the anarchist Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo. he became known as the leader of a strike in 1917 and in 1920 participated in the general strike called by the leadership of the CNT, which ended in failure. After the start of Miguel Primo de Rivera's dictatorship, D√≠az continued his labor activism in clandestinity being arrested in Madrid in 1925. In 1927, already out of jail, he joined the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) with much of the leaders of Seville anarchism. He was able to attract the more radical workers, who were disenchanted with the traditional unions, as well as helping the PCE profit from rivalry between the moderate socialist Uni√≥n General de Trabajadores and the anarchist Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo. Leadership in Spain In 1932 the Spanish Communist Party made a major change in direction when it abandoned the Comintern slogan \\"Workers' and Peasants' Government\\" and adopted \\"Defense of the Republic\\". D√≠az was among the new leaders of the party who succeeded Jos√© Bullejos. The others were Vicente Uribe, Antonio Mije, Juan Astigarrab√≠a and Jes√∫s Hern√°ndez Tom√°s. The 4th PCE Congress in Sevilla (March 1932) elected him a member of the Central Committee; in September of the same year, he joined the Politburo, and soon after was appointed general secretary. In this capacity, D√≠az was replacing Jos√© Bullejos, who had been expelled for opposing the official party line during a \\"campaign of Bolshevisation\\" that enforced Stalinism as the official Marxism-Leninism. In 1935, he and Dolores Ib√°rruri led the PCE delegation to the 7th Comintern Congress, where Georgi Dimitrov introduced the politic of \\"united front against Fascism\\", which signaled world communists to seek an alliance with movements previously considered bourgeois. With PCE participation in the Spanish Popular Front government and the Civil War, D√≠az dedicated himself to inner party politics, without occupying official positions in the administration of the Second Spanish Republic. His focus was on contributing to the military victory of the Republican forces over Francisco Franco's troops, and was a noted critic of Juan Domingo Astigarrabia and his Communist Party of Euskadi (the PCE wing in the Basque Country), whom he saw as too sympathetic to Basque nationalism. His sister Carmen D√≠az and the mother of his daughter, Teresa Santos, were killed in Seville at the orders of General Gonzalo Queipo de Llano, in the early days of the war. In the Soviet Union Diaz's health deteriorated due to stomach cancer, and he left Spain for the Soviet Union in January 1939, being operated on in Leningrad. He remained in Moscow after the Republican defeat and the start of World War II, being active as a cadre in the Comintern Secretariat (an overseer of communists in Spain, South America, and British India). D√≠az also wrote an essay containing self-criticism, one prompted by the ideological demands of the Great Purge and Stalin's personality cult, entitled Las ense√±anzas de Stalin, gu√≠a luminoso para los comunistas espa√±oles (\\"The Teachings of Stalin, a Luminous Guide for the Spanish Communists\\"). The articles he wrote in the period were collected as Tres a√±os de lucha (\\"Three Years of Combat\\"). When the German forces invaded the Soviet state in June 1941, Jos√© D√≠az was forced to take refuge in Pushkin. In autumn, he settled in Tbilisi (Georgian SSR) but his ailment and the immense pain it caused him made him take his own life that spring. The circumstances of his death have been disputed ever since, with many believing that he had actually been murdered on Stalin's orders. Notably, the stance D√≠az had taken in 1939, when he asked for the PCE to be given full control over the Republican government, went clearly (albeit perhaps unwittingly) against the Stalinist strategy. The KGB file concerning him was declassified in the 1990s (after the fall of the Soviet Union): it failed to provide any evidence incriminating Stalin's government. D√≠az was replaced as general secretary by Dolores Ib√°rruri. In April 2005, his remains were reburied in Seville, and the PCE honored his memory with a ceremonial; the city's Ayuntamiento unanimously voted to designate him Hijo predilecto (\\"Favorite son\\").

Conflict with Mohammed VI government On 23 July 1999, Hassan II died, and his son Mohammed VI succeeded him to the throne, raising hopes for democratic reform. Le Journal soon became critical of Mohamed's reign, however, particularly his slowness in transforming Morocco into a constitutional democracy. As a result of the critical editorials printed by the paper, Moroccan printers soon refused to do business with it, forcing Jama√Ø to print in France and pay enormous transportation costs. In April 2000, Le Journal \\"crossed a political redline\\" by printing an interview with Muhammad Abdelaziz, leader of the Saharawi separatist movement Polisario Front that was fighting for the independence of Western Sahara from Morocco. The Moroccan Ministry of Communications responded by banning both Le Journal and Assahifa Al Ousbouia, though the latter had not run the interview in question. A Ministry spokesperson stated that the reasons for the papers' banning were \\"excesses in [their] editorial line concerning the question of Morocco‚Äôs territorial integrity\\" and \\"collusion with foreign interests\\". However, following an outcry from foreign governments and NGOs, the papers were allowed to re-open. The conflict with the government won Jama√Ø's papers publicity and popular credibility, and advertising revenues increased substantially for the following months. In November, however, the paper reprinted a letter implicating that a number of socialist politicians, including then-Prime Minister Abderrahmane Youssoufi, had participated in a 1972 plot to assassinate Hassan II. The papers were again banned. At the January 2001 Congress of the International Federation for Human Rights in Casablanca, Jama√Ø took the podium to announce to the applause of the delegates that he would go on a hunger strike until his papers were unbanned. Following another round of international protest‚Äîincluding a question about the banning from German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on the occasion of Youssoufi's state visit to Germany‚Äîthe government relented, and the papers were once more allowed to print. In 2006, in its reporting on the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy‚Äîin which a Danish newspaper published several cartoons depicting the Islamic prophet Muhammad, triggering widespread anger in the Muslim world --Le Journal published a blacked-out version of one of the cartoons. The newspaper's offices were then the target of a series of protests, which Jama√Ø alleges were orchestrated by the national government. Binaissa defamation suit At the time of the papers' first banning in April 2000, Foreign Minister Mohamed Benaissa filed a defamation lawsuit against Jama√Ø and Ali Amar, another editor of Le Journal, for a 1999 series of articles alleging that the minister had profited from the sale of an official residence during his tenure as Ambassador to the United States. Jama√Ø later speculated that Benaissa \\"was waiting for a signal\\" to attack the papers and that he saw his opportunity following the announcement of the ban. In 2001, the pair were found guilty, and sentenced to pay damages of 2 million dirhams (US$200,000). In addition, Jama√Ø was sentenced to three months' imprisonment, and Amar to two months. Reporters Without Borders immediately called for the Moroccan Justice Minister to overturn the verdict, asserting that \\"Fines should not be used by the authorities with the aim of halting the appearance or publication of a media\\". Other lawsuits followed, and by 2006, Jama√Ø's debts amounted to more than US$1.5 million in fines, damages, and back taxes. In 2002, Le Journal's staff was told by a number of companies that had formerly advertised in the paper that they had been pressured by the government no longer to do so. Jama√Ø speculated to an interviewer that having realized that they could not shut the paper down directly without international pressure, the government was now seeking to bankrupt it. In 2006, Jama√Ø lost another libel suit, this time to Claude Moniquet, director of the Brussels think-tank, the European Strategic Intelligence and Security Center; Jama√Ø had described a report of his on the Polisario Front as \\"tele-guided by the royal palace\\", and was ordered to pay a US$360,000 fine. The press freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) described the trial as \\"politically motivated and unfair\\", and said that it could prove a \\"fatal blow\\" to the weekly magazine.Mise √† mort du Journal Hebdomadaire : une semaine pour payer trois millions de dirhams de dommages et int√©r√™ts , Reporters sans fronti√®res, 23 December 2006 A cousin of Mohammad's, Prince Moulay Hicham Ben Abdallah, offered to settle Jama√Ø's legal debts, but Jama√Ø refused, saying that he would \\"prefer to force the regime to let the press alone or be exposed for silencing it\\". Jama√Ø then resigned from his papers and traveled to the US, working as a professor at the University of San Diego for three years. He returned to Morocco in 2009. Faced with growing debts and an advertising boycott, Le Journal went out of business in 2010. On 16 February 2010, bailiffs arrived with a court order that the paper must cease publication. Jama√Ø announced to a crowd outside the office that he was leaving journalism, because \\"serious journalism has become impossible in Morocco today\\". The following year, however, he would go on to found the news website Lakome.com. Awards and recognition In 2003, The Committee to Protect Journalists presented Jama√Ø its International Press Freedom Award, \\"an annual recognition of courageous journalism\\", for his work with Le Journal. In 2010, the World Association of Newspapers awarded him its Gebran Tueni Prize, established in honor of the assassinated Lebanese editor and press freedom advocate of the same name.

The steep drop of the eastern end of the southern Ottawa escarpment can be seen here as the road approaches the Ottawa River. Merivale Road is an arterial road in the western part of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It starts at Island Park Drive just north of Highway 417 and continues south until it ends at Prince of Wales Drive in Rideau Glen. South of Clyde Avenue, Merivale is known as Ottawa Road #17, while north of Clyde it is Ottawa Road #63. From Island Park Drive to Carling Avenue the road is as a small collector route, passing the Westgate Shopping Centre. South of Carling Avenue it is a minor arterial road that goes through the Carlington residential neighborhood. It passes just west of the Central Experimental Farm, land owned by the federal Government of Canada. South of Baseline Road, Merivale Road turns (it is actually the continuation of Clyde Avenue and Maitland Avenue) and becomes a major arterial route through a commercial district that contains several major malls, dozens of restaurants and radio and former CTV broadcast facilities (CJOH-TV, building structure was badly damaged by fire in 2010 and the building was demolished in 2011). During the 1950s through the 1990s prior to the City of Nepean's amalgamation with the city of Ottawa, this area of Merivale Road formed the largest commercial shopping district within the city of Nepean and a major shopping area for the National Capital region. During the 1950s and 1960s several major department stores, such as Towers, Miracle Mart, Pascals, and Kmart, were located along Merivale Road along with major Canadian grocery chains such as Steinberg's and Dominion. The late 1970s saw the building of Merivale Mall at the intersection of Merivale and Viewmount Drive on the site of a former farm house and farm lands. It was home to a Woolco at the south end of the mall, one of its anchor stores. The building of the Meadowlands Mall at the intersection of Merivale Road and Meadowlands Road took place around this time, before it contained large box stores. This area of Merivale Road also leads to the City of Nepean's first experiment in promoting industrial development through the creation of industrial parks. The Colonnade Road Industrial Park at the intersection of Merivale and Colonnade lies just to the south of Viewmount Road and is/was the location for branches, production facilities and headquarters of many large high tech companies such as Gandalf Technologies, and Mitel as well as OC Transpo's south west garage facilities. Through the 1980s it was also home to Ottawa's largest Flea Market at the time, the Colonnade Flea Market (the Flea Market has since been renamed to the Bentley Flea Market and relocated further south on Merivale to 7 Cleopatra Drive). During the 1990s another major commercial area was developed further south on Merivale road located at the intersection of Hunt Club Road. This was precipitated by the extension of the Hunt Club Road west across the Rideau River creating a new intersection with Merivale Road in what used to be a rural farming field. This area includes various national retailers such as Canadian Tire, Petsmart, Rona, Costco and the Brick as well as various restaurant chains such as Boston Pizza and Eastside Mario's, fast food places such as Burger King and A&W;, car dealerships, workout gyms and smaller specialty stores. South of Hunt Club Road, Merivale runs through an industrial district with many small businesses which during the 1970s and 1980s was the second location for intense industrial development led by the City of Nepean. This area also contains extensive petroleum storage facilities, and brownfield sites where such facilities once stood. South of the intersection of Merivale and Slack Road, Merivale passes the neighbourhoods of Pineglen and Country Place and then crosses the greenbelt; an area protected from further urban development. South of this Merivale, passes through Rideau Glen, part of the growing subdivision of Barrhaven. Speed limits Speed limits vary throughout this long stretch: * Between Island Park Drive and the Central Experimental Farm, the speed limit is 50 km/h. * Between the Central Experimental Farm and MacFarlane Road in the industrial district the speed limit is 60 km/h. * A small section afterwards has a speed limit of 50 km/h while the rest of the road from north of Fallowfield Road to Prince of Wales Drive the speed limit is 80 km/h. Bus routes Merivale Road is well served by OC Transpo bus service as follows: * Route 53 travels between Summerville Avenue and Kirkwood Avenue during Westbound trips, and between Caldwell Avenue and Summerville Avenue during Eastbound trips. * Route 80 travels between Carling Avenue and Leiken Drive, though some Monday-Friday trips do not travel between MacFarlane Road and Leiken Drive. * Route 81 travels between Caldwell Avenue and Central Park Drive, and again between Central Park Drive and Clyde Avenue. * Route 83 travels between Viewmount Drive and Woodfield Drive. * Route 89 travels between Viewmount Drive and Colonnade Road. * Route 96 travels between Viewmount Drive and MacFarlane Road, though some Saturday/Sunday trips do not travel between Hunt Club Road and MacFarlane Road. * Route 186 travels between Meadowlands Drive and Slack Road during peak hours Monday-Friday only. * Route 187 travels between Slack Road and Amberwood Crescent during peak hours Monday-Friday only. * Route 199 travels between Hunt Club Road and Leiken Drive during peak hours Monday-Friday only.

Ye was a strong supporter of Deng Xiaoping's reform and opening policy. Under his leadership, Guangdong grew economically prosperous and gained significant autonomy from Beijing. Concerned about his power, the national government manoeuvred to relieve him of the governorship, but allowed him to maintain his power base in Guangdong. He subsequently served as Vice-Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference from 1991 to 2003. Ye was the eldest son of Ye Jianying, one of the founding Ten Marshals of the People's Republic of China, who was instrumental in overthrowing the Gang of Four and ending the Cultural Revolution. After the death of his father, he became the patriarch of their powerful family, dubbed the \\"Ye Dynasty\\".  Early life  Ye Xuanping was born in November 1924 in Meixian, Guangdong, Republic of China. He was the eldest son of Ye Jianying, who later became one of the founding Ten Marshals of the People's Republic of China. When Xuanping was born, his father was serving as county magistrate of Xiangshan, and he was raised by his mother Feng Hua (). During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Ye lived in Yan'an, the headquarters of the Communist Party of China, and did not reunite with his father until 1941. He studied mechanics at the Yan'an Institute of Natural Sciences from 1941 to 1945, and joined the Communist Party in 1945. After graduation he worked at Yan'an Arsenal and other factories.  Career  After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Ye briefly studied at Harbin Institute of Technology and Tsinghua University from 1949 to 1950, and then worked at Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory. In 1952 he was sent to the Soviet Union to receive training at a machine tool factory, and was appointed Chief Engineer of Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory after returning to China in 1954. He was transferred to Beijing in 1962 and served as Chief Engineer of Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Factory until 1973. From 1973 to 1977 he was deputy head of the Beijing Machinery Bureau. In 1976, Marshal Ye Jianying played a key role in a coup overthrowing the Gang of Four and ending the Cultural Revolution. In 1977, Xuanping was sent to study at the Central Party School of the Communist Party of China, and subsequently served as Director of the Third Bureau of the State Science and Technology Commission from 1978 to 1980. = Guangdong Province = In 1980, Ye was appointed Mayor of Guangzhou and concurrently Vice Governor of Guangdong province. He was promoted to Governor of Guangdong in the summer of 1985, replacing Liang Lingguang. A follower of Deng Xiaoping, Ye was a stalwart supporter of economic liberalization and more reform-minded than the Party Secretary Lin Ruo. He promoted Guangdong's special economic zones, Shenzhen and Hainan, while paying lip service to macroeconomic control. Moreover, his wife Wu Xiaolan served as Vice Mayor of Shenzhen until she was dismissed by Li Hao in 1986. Ye cultivated strong ties with business magnates of Hong Kong and Macau, including Stanley Ho and Ann Tse-kai. As a member of the Central Committee, Ye, together with Shanghai mayor Zhu Rongji, was a major regional leader who supported the reformist General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, and resisted Premier Li Peng's policy of retrenchment. Following the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and the fall of Zhao Ziyang, the Ye family's power was believed to have weakened due to its sympathy with Zhao. Under Ye's leadership, Guangdong grew economically prosperous while gaining significant autonomy from the national government in Beijing, and Hong Kong media dubbed him the \\"Emperor of the South\\". The central government, increasingly concerned about his power, manoeuvred to relieve him of the governorship. In April 1991, Ye agreed to leave his post and accepted the appointment as Vice Chairman of the 7th Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), a nominally higher ranking position. In return, Beijing agreed to appoint Zhu Senlin, his designated candidate, as his successor, and allowed Ye to continue to reside in Guangdong. Ye had reportedly threatened to withhold Guangdong's remittance to Beijing if his conditions were not met, and effectively maintained his power base in the province. He served two more terms (8th and 9th CPPCC) as Vice Chairman, until 2003. Ye was an alternate member of the 12th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and a full member of the 13th and 14th Central Committees. He was also a delegate to the 5th and 6th National People's Congresses. On 17 September 2019, Ye died in Guangzhou, aged 94.  Family  After the death of Marshal Ye Jianying, Ye Xuanping became the patriarch of the powerful family dubbed the \\"Ye Dynasty\\". His younger half brother, Ye Xuanning, served as China's military spy chief. He died in 2016. Another brother, Ye Xuanlian, was a manager of the People's Liberation Army's China Poly Group. His sister, Ye Chumei, is married to Zou Jiahua, a former Vice Premier of China. Ye Xuanping's son, Ye Xinfu, is a businessman in Hong Kong who founded the conglomerate P W Asia and served as a director of at least 11 companies, including Tse Sui Luen, one of the largest jewellery chains. His grandson, Ye Zhonghao, was appointed head of Guangdong's Yunfu Hi- Tech Industry Development Zone in 2017.

It later shifted its focus to promote biodiversity conservation in Hong Kong and south China, and greater environmental awareness. It is located near Pak Ngau Shek, encompassing Kwun Yum Shan in the central New Territories; The Farm was built in a valley with streams, woodlands and terraces in 1956 by the Kadoorie Agricultural Aid Association. Now it is managed to integrate nature conservation, including a rescue and rehabilitation programme for native animals, along with holistic education and practices in support of a transition to sustainable living. The farm attracts about 3000 to 5000 visitors per week. History Kadoorie Agriculture The Kadoorie brothers, Lord Lawrence Kadoorie and Sir Horace Kadoorie, planted the seeds for Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden when they founded the Kadoorie Agricultural Aid Association in 1951. The aim of the association was to encourage the right mental outlook by helping people to help themselves through training, supply of agricultural inputs and interest-free loans. In 1956, the association established an experimental and extension farm at Pak Ngau Shek on the present site as a centre for demonstrating crop production and animal husbandry, improving livestock breeds and training local farmers and Hong Kong based Gurkha soldiers. Special breeds of pigs and chickens were developed which could cope with the local conditions. On 20 January 1995, the Legislative Council passed an ordinance that established the Kadoorie Farm and Botanic Garden Corporation. This opened the door for a new era of flora and fauna conservation, organic agriculture, creative education and a focus on sustainability in Hong Kong. Its mission is to harmonise our relationship with the environment. The chairman is Andrew McAulay (son of Ronald McAulay and nephew of Sir Michael Kadoorie); the executive director is Andy Brown. Programmes Programmes run by KFBG's Education Department include tree planting, improving wildlife habitat, art and environment workshops, as well as outreach programmes for schools and the local community. Increasingly there is an emphasis on holistic education, encouraging visitors to explore their relationship with nature by artistic means, internal inquiry, mindfulness and compassion. Meanwhile, through its Sustainable Living & Agriculture Department KFBG works to support community transition by developing new and economically workable opportunities for all parties in the food system. KFBG is actively trying to reduce the ecological footprint of its own operations. KFBG has a range of biodiversity conservation programmes. Its Ecological Advisory Programme, launched in 1998, advises government, environmental NGOs, villagers, ecological consultants, academics and private developers, seeking to influence policy and practice in support of conservation. The Fauna and Flora Conservation Departments contribute through wildlife rescue work, ex- situ breeding and propagation programmes, and educational projects. KFBG seeks to integrate its multiple management objectives, for biodiversity, ecosystem services and holistic education, on its own 150-hectare estate. Conservation work has been extended to Mainland China since 1998. Following some pilot surveys in Guangdong and Guangxi in 1997, the KFBG China Programme launched a series of collaborative rapid biodiversity assessments in the nature reserves of Hainan, Guangxi and Guangdong, leading to a series of reports highlighting the distribution, status and threats of the region's wildlife, focusing on vertebrates, plants, dragonflies, ants and some other groups. At the same time the Programme provided a communication platform among those involved in forest conservation in south China through its Living Forests magazine and website. Since 2000 the Programme's attention has gradually shifted to helping protected-areas authorities and communities with the conservation of key sites and species, especially in Hainan and Guangxi . A particular focus has been the great tropical forest of Yinggeling, central Hainan, which is now a provincial Nature Reserve called the Yinggeling National Nature Reserve. Since 2003 KFBG has been involved with conserving the Hainan gibbon (Nomascus hainanus), thought to be the rarest ape in the world, at its last refuge at Hainan Bawangling National Nature Reserve. In 2011 the KFBG China Programme was renamed Kadoorie Conservation China. Facilities *T.S.

With a history spanning more than 20 years and operating under several different names, Calibre Sports is now based in Broadford, Victoria on part of the Victorian State Motorcycle Complex. About Calibre Sports Incorporated was founded in 1994. Now based at our range in Broadford, Victoria, It is organised as a Member-directed club, structured by a constitution. The club is affiliated with the worldwide shooting organisations IPSC and ICORE. It is also affiliated with the Victoria-based VAPA. In addition to in-house competitions, the club provides a successful stream of competitors in disciplines specified by the aforementioned organisations. Calibre Sports members regularly participate in National and International shooting events. In the beginning Calibre Sports had its beginnings at the Victoria Ranges Indoor Rock Climbing Centre in Mt. Alexander Rd, Flemington. Back then in 1994, the club was known as Victoria Ranges Pistol Club. Membership fees were minimal and paid directly to the Victoria Ranges Complex and did not include lane hire. Whilst there was a committee, the club was run as part of the \\"Victoria Ranges\\" business and any final decisions were always made by the owners there. Victoria Ranges pistol club boasted a membership of over 800, but as is normally the case only a small percentage were actually active competitively. A small group of members worked in conjunction with Victoria Ranges and held weekly competitions. At the end of each term prizes were awarded to the top shooters and these were usually handguns for 1st, 2nd and 3rd place. Flemington Indoor Pistol Club As more members became interested in the day-to-day running of the club, they realised that the club needed to stand on its own if it was to continue successfully. And so, in 1995 \\"Flemington Indoor Pistol Club\\" (FIPC) was formed. Now an Incorporated Association the club had its own identity, separate from any business or shooting body. However, it was difficult for the club to function independently as it was still under the administration of \\"Victoria Ranges\\" and as such unable to collect or have access to any club funds. It wasn't until 198, when members decided that they wanted the club to be run as a club that the first AGM was held and as a result, the club was to be managed solely by a member elected committee. Independence The club came to an agreement with Victoria Ranges. FIPC would lease a small office upstairs, members would renew via the club and pay a separate fee for a lane hire package directly to Victoria Ranges. A turbulent 12 months followed with several clashes between committee members and Victoria Ranges staff. It was becoming obvious that Victoria Ranges wanted to regain control of the club. in 1999 a group headed by some FIPC committee members together with Victoria Ranges management formed \\"Melbourne Indoor Pistol Club\\" (MIPC). MIPC was also based at the Victoria Ranges Centre and this created great confusion for FIPC members as MIPC's logo was a direct copy of the FIPC logo with only the name changed, even the renewal forms were the same. As a result, many members paid their renewal fees via the Victoria Ranges staff, they were not informed that this fee was not going to their club and that the staff were signing them up to MIPC. This was to have a devastating effect on club membership and many members had no idea what was going on or which club they actually belonged to. Time for a change It was clear that something needed to be done and in late 1999 FIPC opted for a name change, a competition was conducted to select the new name and logo. Many entries were received of which Calibre Sports was the most popular and so \\"Calibre Sports Inc\\" was formed. Whilst Calibre Sports was easily distinguishable, attracting new members was difficult and membership was slowly dropping. In mid 2000 Ivan Rehlicki of Relic Custom, approached Calibre Sports with a proposal for the club to relocate to a new Indoor Range under construction in Thomastown. Calibre Sports would be the primary club and any new members would be signed up by Calibre Sports. The proposal was put to the membership in September 2000 and they voted in favour of the move. The Relic Custom Indoor Shooting Complex opened in early 2002. Approximately 200 members made the move to Thomastown. Over the next 2 years membership increased to over 500, making Calibre Sports one of the largest pistol clubs in Australia. The club affiliated with IPSC and ICORE and together with Relic Custom implemented a significant sponsorship program which helped to promote both entities. In 2003 handgun owners were hit hard by the government buyback, a result of the Monash shootings. The National Handgun Buyback Act 2003 was signed into law on 30 June 2003. New restrictions were put in place on maximum calibre and number of shots for handguns and minimum barrel lengths for handguns. Victoria began its handgun buyback scheme in August 2003. This impacted severely on both the club and the range. Whilst owners were compensated for their surrendered handguns, many chose not to remain in the sport and as a result of a lengthy period of uncertainty dealers sold very few guns over the following month with many forced to close their doors. Calibre Sports lost a significant number of members during this time. Changes to the laws made handgun ownership more complex and competitions were made compulsory. Those dealers that remained had the option of filing a claim for compensation and Relic Custom exercised that option. It was a long drawn out process which finally saw a conclusion on 16 October 2007 when the Victorian government settled the claim by Relic Custom and advised that the range would close two weeks late on 30 October.  A club in limbo  After the closure of the Relic Custom complex in Thomastown the club was without a home range for several years. With thanks to the generous support of the Oakleigh Pistol Club, Calibre Sports was able to continue running a monthly competition for its members, therefore allowing it to survive as a club. All forms of venues were investigated as a possible new home range for the club until an advertisement was placed in the local paper of the Mitchell Shire seeking expressions of interest for the lease of land to build an outdoor range.  A new future for the club.  There were a number of responses to the advertisement and a lot of inspections were conducted by the committee. Finally a suitable site was found and after a lengthy process of lease negotiations with Motorcycle Victoria an agreement was reached subject to getting approval from Victoria Police. After further delays for planning applications with the Mitchell Shire Council, work finally began on creating a pistol range and on December 2014 Calibre Sports hosted its first club match at its new home range in Broadford. The club has continued to make improvements to the range over the years. In 2017 there was the addition of dividing walls on the top and bottom ranges increasing the amount of stages that could be run simultaneously. The increase in stages also increased attendances at the monthly club competitions and necessitated improvements and expansion of the car park. New club rooms were built in mid 2020 as well as shade structures on all the ranges. Calibre Sports's Broadford range is now one of the best ranges in the state and is capable of hosting state and national level matches in various disciplines.

While only an approximation, the model is widely used in a number of applications such as speech synthesis and speech analysis because of its relative simplicity. It is also related to linear prediction. The development of the model is due, in large part, to the early work of Gunnar Fant, although others, notably Ken Stevens, have also contributed substantially to the models underlying acoustic analysis of speech and speech synthesis. Fant built off the work of Tsutomu Chiba and Masato Kajiyama, who first showed the relationship between a vowel's acoustic properties and the shape of the vocal tract. . An important assumption that is often made in the use of the source‚Äìfilter model is the independence of source and filter. In such cases, the model should more accurately be referred to as the \\"independent source‚Äìfilter model\\". History In 1942, Chiba and Kajiyama published their research on vowel acoustics and the vocal tract in their book, The Vowel: Its nature and structure. By creating models of the vocal tract using X-ray photography, they were able to predict the formant frequencies of different vowels, establishing a relationship between the two. Gunnar Fant, a pioneering speech scientist, used Chiba and Kajiyama's research involving X-ray photography of the vocal tract to interpret his own data of Russian speech sounds in Acoustic Theory of Speech Production, which established the source‚Äìfilter model. Applications To varying degrees, different phonemes can be distinguished by the properties of their source(s) and their spectral shape. Voiced sounds (e.g., vowels) have at least one source due to mostly periodic glottal excitation, which can be approximated by an impulse train in the time domain and by harmonics in the frequency domain, and a filter that depends on, for example, tongue position and lip protrusion. On the other hand, fricatives, such as and , have at least one source due to turbulent noise produced at a constriction in the oral cavity or pharynx. So-called voiced fricatives, such as and , have two sources - one at the glottis and one at the supra-glottal constriction. =Speech synthesis= In implementation of the source‚Äìfilter model of speech production, the sound source, or excitation signal, is often modelled as a periodic impulse train, for voiced speech, or white noise for unvoiced speech. The vocal tract filter is, in the simplest case, approximated by an all-pole filter, where the coefficients are obtained by performing linear prediction to minimize the mean-squared error in the speech signal to be reproduced. Convolution of the excitation signal with the filter response then produces the synthesised speech. =Modeling human speech production= One possible combination of source and filter in the human vocal tract. In human speech production, the sound source is the vocal folds, which can produce a periodic sound when constricted or an aperiodic (white noise) sound when relaxed. The filter is the rest of the vocal tract, which can change shape through manipulation of the pharynx, mouth, and nasal cavity. Fant roughly compares the source and filter to phonation and articulation, respectively. The source produces a number of harmonics of varying amplitudes, which travel through the vocal tract and are either amplified or attenuated to produce a speech sound.

Although it was one of the first songs developed in early 1984, neither the band nor the producers who came and went (Jim Steinman, Nigel Green, & Mutt Lange) were able to produce the desired sound until two and a half painstaking years later. Due to its early beginnings, it was the only Hysteria track demoed by Rick Allen on an acoustic drum kit prior to his car accident, Allen having recorded a drum beat for the song onto a four track tape during early sessions.DVD - Classic Albums: Def Leppards Hysteria. Bonus Features. A later studio demo version, tracked to a drum machine, remained largely the same as the earlier demo, which the band felt was starting to sound dated, until after Joe Elliot recorded a lead vocal over it in Paris in July 1985. Lange and the band were so impressed with the lead vocal that they consequently re-wrote and re-recorded the backing track around the vocal. The effort paid off when \\"Animal\\" was released as the lead single off the album in July 1987. In the UK, where the band was all but ignored during the Pyromania era, the song hit #6 on the singles chart and broke Def Leppard into the pop mainstream across Europe. Over in America, the lead single \\"Women\\" performed poorly on the pop charts, which did not give the band much momentum when \\"Animal\\" was released afterwards in October 1987. It did reach a respectable #19, though, starting their run of ten consecutive U. S. Billboard Top 40 singles, and is still one of the most popular numbers at Def Leppard concerts today. The line in the song, \\"Like the restless rust, I never sleep\\", is a reference to Neil Young's album Rust Never Sleeps. The single's UK B-side, \\"Tear It Down\\", was written during a recording session following the completion of the Hysteria album, where the band laid down several tracks intended as B-sides for the Hysteria singles.

It is popular in upstate New York. The Northern Spy was one of four apples honored by the United States Postal Service in a 2013 set of four 33¬¢ stamps commemorating historic strains, joined by Baldwin, Golden Delicious, and Granny Smith. Description Northern Spy produces fairly late in the season (late October and beyond). Skin color is a green ground, flushed with red stripes where not shaded. The white flesh is juicy, crisp and mildly sweet with a rich, aromatic subacid flavor, noted for high vitamin C content. Its characteristic flavor is tarter than most popular varieties, and its flesh is harder/crunchier than most, with a thin skin. Uses Northern Spy is commonly used for desserts and pies, as well as juice and cider. It is an excellent apple for storage, tending to last long due to late maturation. Cultivation The Northern Spy was discovered around 1800 in East Bloomfield, New York, south of Rochester, New York, as surviving sprouts of a seedling cultivated from stock brought in from Connecticut that had failed. The Wagener apple is believed to be one of its forebearers. It fell somewhat out of favor due to its dull coloration, irregular shape, tendency of the thin skin to allow bruising, and lack of disease resistance, specifically to bitter pit and blossom fireblight, but resistant to woolly aphid and somewhat to scab. It is not widely available at retail outside its growing regions but still serves as an important processing apple in those areas. The Northern Spy is known for taking as much as a decade to bear fruit, unless grafted to a non-standard rootstock. In spite of this, it makes an excellent root stock for grafting other varieties to become standard-size trees. A Northern Spy apple tree figures in the poem \\"Conrad Siever\\" in Edgar Lee Masters' Spoon River Anthology, and in the poetry of Chase Twichell, whose first book Northern Spy was published by the University of Pittsburgh Press in 1981. A box of Northern Spies was sent to Senator Joseph McCarthy by the news staff of the Toronto Globe and Mail in 1953 as a joke.

History Memorial on the Bramberg for the Battle of Laupen The Battle of Neuenegg, 1798. Neuenegg is first mentioned in 1228 as Nuneca. In 1235 it was mentioned as Nuwenegge. During the Middle Ages, Neuenegg was part of the Herrschaft of Laupen. In 1324, the entire Herrschaft was acquired by Bern. Neuenegg was one of the six courts of the new Bernese bailiwick of Laupen. Initially the court was held in the church yard, then it moved to the village pub. In 1339, during the Battle of Laupen, the Bernese and Swiss Confederation forces deployed on the Bramberg hill near Neuenegg. Fribourg, Burgundian and Habsburg forces attacked the hill and after heavy fighting were driven away with heavy losses. The Swiss and Bernese victory on the Bramberg brought Bern into closer association with the Swiss Confederacy, becoming one of the Eight Cantons in 1353. The village parish church of St. John was first mentioned in 1227 when Emperor Frederick II granted it to the Teutonic Knights. The current aisle was built in the 13th or 14th century, the choir is from 1452 and the church tower was built in 1512-16. The first village school was built in the 17th century. During the French invasion of 1798 a major battle was fought near Neuenegg. Under the command of Johann Rudolf von Graffenried the Bernese triumphed over numerically superior French troops under Brigadier General Pigeon on 5 March 1798. However, after the Bernese defeat that same day at the Battle of Grauholz, the collapse of the Ancien R√©gime could no longer be avoided. Neuenegg was located near the Bern-Fribourg trade road. In 1470 Fribourg built a bridge across the Sense river at Neuenegg and brought the road directly through the town. It remained on the main road for several centuries. However, in the 19th century, the new, main cantonal road bypassed Neuenegg. In 1860 a railroad line was built which also bypassed the village. It wasn't until 1903 that the Flamatt-G√ºmmenen rail line was built through the town. In the same year, Nestl√© opened a milk processing factory in Neuenegg. In 1927 the Bernese company Wander AG acquired the factory to produce Ovaltine. In 1967 the factory was acquired by Sandoz AG and Novartis AG when they acquired Wander. In 2002 Associated British Foods acquired the company and the factory, which is still one of the largest employers in the municipality.

Understanding protein‚Äìprotein interactions is important for the investigation of intracellular signaling pathways, modelling of protein complex structures and for gaining insights into various biochemical processes. Experimentally, physical interactions between pairs of proteins can be inferred from a variety of techniques, including yeast two-hybrid systems, protein-fragment complementation assays (PCA), affinity purification/mass spectrometry, protein microarrays, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), and Microscale Thermophoresis (MST). Efforts to experimentally determine the interactome of numerous species are ongoing. Experimentally determined interactions usually provide the basis for computational methods to predict interactions, e.g. using homologous protein sequences across species. However, there are also methods that predict interactions de novo, without prior knowledge of existing interactions.  Methods  Proteins that interact are more likely to co-evolve, therefore, it is possible to make inferences about interactions between pairs of proteins based on their phylogenetic distances. It has also been observed in some cases that pairs of interacting proteins have fused orthologues in other organisms. In addition, a number of bound protein complexes have been structurally solved and can be used to identify the residues that mediate the interaction so that similar motifs can be located in other organisms. = Phylogenetic profiling = Figure A.The phylogenetic profiles of four genes (A, B, C and D) are shown on the right. A '1' denotes presence of the gene in the genome and a '0' denotes absence. The two identical profiles of genes A and B are highlighted in yellow. The phylogenetic profile method is based on the hypothesis that if two or more proteins are concurrently present or absent across several genomes, then they are likely functionally related. Figure A illustrates a hypothetical situation in which proteins A and B are identified as functionally linked due to their identical phylogenetic profiles across 5 different genomes. The Joint Genome Institute provides an Integrated Microbial Genomes and Microbiomes database (JGI IMG) that has a phylogenetic profiling tool for single genes and gene cassettes. = Prediction of co-evolved protein pairs based on similar phylogenetic trees= It was observed that the phylogenetic trees of ligands and receptors were often more similar than due to random chance. This is likely because they faced similar selection pressures and co-evolved. This method uses the phylogenetic trees of protein pairs to determine if interactions exist. To do this, homologs of the proteins of interest are found (using a sequence search tool such as BLAST) and multiple-sequence alignments are done (with alignment tools such as Clustal) to build distance matrices for each of the proteins of interest. The distance matrices should then be used to build phylogenetic trees. However, comparisons between phylogenetic trees are difficult, and current methods circumvent this by simply comparing distance matrices. The distance matrices of the proteins are used to calculate a correlation coefficient, in which a larger value corresponds to co-evolution. The benefit of comparing distance matrices instead of phylogenetic trees is that the results do not depend on the method of tree building that was used. The downside is that difference matrices are not perfect representations of phylogenetic trees, and inaccuracies may result from using such a shortcut. Another factor worthy of note is that there are background similarities between the phylogenetic trees of any protein, even ones that do not interact. If left unaccounted for, this could lead to a high false-positive rate. For this reason, certain methods construct a background tree using 16S rRNA sequences which they use as the canonical tree of life. The distance matrix constructed from this tree of life is then subtracted from the distance matrices of the proteins of interest. However, because RNA distance matrices and DNA distance matrices have different scale, presumably because RNA and DNA have different mutation rates, the RNA matrix needs to be rescaled before it can be subtracted from the DNA matrices. By using molecular clock proteins, the scaling coefficient for protein distance/RNA distance can be calculated. This coefficient is used to rescale the RNA matrix. Figure B. The Human succinyl-CoA-Transferase enzyme is represented by the two joint blue and green bars at the top of the image. The alpha subunit of the Acetate-CoA- Transferase enzyme is homologous with the first half of the enzyme, represents by the blue bar. The beta subunit of the Acetate-CoA-Transferase enzyme is homologous with the second half of the enzyme, represents by the green bar. This mage was adapted from Uetz, P. & Pohl, E. (2018) Protein-Protein and Protein-DNA Interactions. In: Wink, M. (ed.), Introduction to Molecular Biotechnology, 3rd ed. Wiley-VCH, in press. = Rosetta stone (gene fusion) method = The Rosetta Stone or Domain Fusion method is based on the hypothesis that interacting proteins are sometimes fused into a single protein. For instance, two or more separate proteins in a genome may be identified as fused into one single protein in another genome. The separate proteins are likely to interact and thus are likely functionally related. An example of this is the Human Succinyl coA Transferase enzyme, which is found as one protein in humans but as two separate proteins, Acetate coA Transferase alpha and Acetate coA Transferase beta, in Escherichia coli. In order to identify these sequences, a sequence similarity algorithm such as the one used by BLAST is necessary. For example, if we had the amino acid sequences of proteins A and B and the amino acid sequences of all proteins in a certain genome, we could check each protein in that genome for non-overlapping regions of sequence similarity to both proteins A and B. Figure B depicts the BLAST sequence alignment of Succinyl coA Transferase with its two separate homologs in E. coli. The two subunits have non-overlapping regions of sequence similarity with the human protein, indicated by the pink regions, with the alpha subunit similar to the first half of the protein and the beta similar to the second half. One limit of this method is that not all proteins that interact can be found fused in another genome, and therefore cannot be identified by this method. On the other hand, the fusion of two proteins does not necessitate that they physically interact. For instance, the SH2 and SH3 domains in the src protein are known to interact. However, many proteins possess homologs of these domains and they do not all interact. FigureC. Organization of the trp operon in three different species of bacteria: Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacter pylori. Only the trpA and trpB genes are adjacent across all three organisms and are thus predicted to interact by the conserved gene neighborhood method. This image was adapted from Dandekar, T., Snel, B., Huynen, M., & Bork, P. (1998). Conservation of gene order: a fingerprint of proteins that physically interact. Trends in biochemical sciences, 23(9), 324-328. = Conserved gene neighborhood = The conserved neighborhood method is based on the hypothesis that if genes encoding two proteins are neighbors on a chromosome in many genomes, then they are likely functionally related. The method is based on an observation by Bork et al. of gene pair conservation across nine bacterial and archaeal genomes. The method is most effective in prokaryotes with operons as the organization of genes in an operon is generally related to function. For instance, the trpA and trpB genes in Escherichia coli encode the two subunits of the tryptophan synthase enzyme known to interact to catalyze a single reaction. The adjacency of these two genes was shown to be conserved across nine different bacterial and archaeal genomes. = Classification methods = Classification methods use data to train a program (classifier) to distinguish positive examples of interacting protein/domain pairs with negative examples of non-interacting pairs. Popular classifiers used are Random Forest Decision (RFD) and Support Vector Machines. RFD produces results based on the domain composition of interacting and non-interacting protein pairs. When given a protein pair to classify, RFD first creates a representation of the protein pair in a vector. The vector contains all the domain types used to train RFD, and for each domain type the vector also contains a value of 0, 1, or 2. If the protein pair does not contain a certain domain, then the value for that domain is 0. If one of the proteins of the pair contains the domain, then the value is 1. If both proteins contain the domain, then the value is 2. Using training data, RFD constructs a decision forest, consisting of many decision trees. Each decision tree evaluates several domains, and based on the presence or absence of interactions in these domains, makes a decision as to if the protein pair interacts. The vector representation of the protein pair is evaluated by each tree to determine if they are an interacting pair or a non-interacting pair. The forest tallies up all the input from the trees to come up with a final decision. The strength of this method is that it does not assume that domains interact independent of each other. This makes it so that multiple domains in proteins can be used in the prediction. This is a big step up from previous methods which could only predict based on a single domain pair. The limitation of this method is that it relies on the training dataset to produce results. Thus, usage of different training datasets could influence the results. = Inference of interactions from homologous structures= This group of methods makes use of known protein complex structures to predict and structurally model interactions between query protein sequences. The prediction process generally starts by employing a sequence based method (e.g. Interolog) to search for protein complex structures that are homologous to the query sequences. These known complex structures are then used as templates to structurally model the interaction between query sequences. This method has the advantage of not only inferring protein interactions but also suggests models of how proteins interact structurally, which can provide some insights into the atomic level mechanism of that interaction. On the other hand, the ability for these methods to make a prediction is constrained by a limited number of known protein complex structures. '' = Association methods = Association methods look for characteristic sequences or motifs that can help distinguish between interacting and non-interacting pairs. A classifier is trained by looking for sequence-signature pairs where one protein contains one sequence-signature, and its interacting partner contains another sequence- signature. They look specifically for sequence-signatures that are found together more often than by chance. This uses a log-odds score which is computed as log2(Pij/PiPj), where Pij is the observed frequency of domains i and j occurring in one protein pair; Pi and Pj are the background frequencies of domains i and j in the data. Predicted domain interactions are those with positive log-odds scores and also having several occurrences within the database. The downside with this method is that it looks at each pair of interacting domains separately, and it assumes that they interact independently of each other. = Identification of structural patterns = This method builds a library of known protein‚Äìprotein interfaces from the PDB, where the interfaces are defined as pairs of polypeptide fragments that are below a threshold slightly larger than the Van der Waals radius of the atoms involved. The sequences in the library are then clustered based on structural alignment and redundant sequences are eliminated. The residues that have a high (generally >50%) level of frequency for a given position are considered hotspots. This library is then used to identify potential interactions between pairs of targets, providing that they have a known structure (i.e. present in the PDB). = Bayesian network modelling = Bayesian methods integrate data from a wide variety of sources, including both experimental results and prior computational predictions, and use these features to assess the likelihood that a particular potential protein interaction is a true positive result. These methods are useful because experimental procedures, particularly the yeast two-hybrid experiments, are extremely noisy and produce many false positives, while the previously mentioned computational methods can only provide circumstantial evidence that a particular pair of proteins might interact. = Domain-pair exclusion analysis = The domain-pair exclusion analysis detects specific domain interactions that are hard to detect using Bayesian methods. Bayesian methods are good at detecting nonspecific promiscuous interactions and not very good at detecting rare specific interactions. The domain-pair exclusion analysis method calculates an E-score which measures if two domains interact. It is calculated as log(probability that the two proteins interact given that the domains interact/probability that the two proteins interact given that the domains don‚Äôt interact). The probabilities required in the formula are calculated using an Expectation Maximization procedure, which is a method for estimating parameters in statistical models. High E-scores indicate that the two domains are likely to interact, while low scores indicate that other domains form the protein pair are more likely to be responsible for the interaction. The drawback with this method is that it does not take into account false positives and false negatives in the experimental data. = Supervised learning problem = The problem of PPI prediction can be framed as a supervised learning problem. In this paradigm the known protein interactions supervise the estimation of a function that can predict whether an interaction exists or not between two proteins given data about the proteins (e.g., expression levels of each gene in different experimental conditions, location information, phylogenetic profile, etc.).  Relationship to docking methods  The field of protein‚Äìprotein interaction prediction is closely related to the field of protein‚Äìprotein docking, which attempts to use geometric and steric considerations to fit two proteins of known structure into a bound complex. This is a useful mode of inquiry in cases where both proteins in the pair have known structures and are known (or at least strongly suspected) to interact, but since so many proteins do not have experimentally determined structures, sequence-based interaction prediction methods are especially useful in conjunction with experimental studies of an organism's interactome.

Geography It is located on the country's northern Baltic coast of the Gulf of Finland. The town's name in Estonian and Russian means \\"Mouth of the Narva\\", the river which forms the border with Russia. Narva-J√µesuu has a population of 2,602 (as of 1 January 2010). As in the nearby city of Narva, most residents today are Russian or Russian- speaking, although the percentage of native Estonians is slightly higher in Narva-J√µesuu (13% compared to 4% in Narva). Narva-J√µesuu marks the northeastern terminus of the E9 European Coastal Path, which runs for 5000 km (3125 miles) from Cabo de S√£o Vicente in Portugal. History The settlement probably arose in the 14th century, then part of the Duchy of Estonia, a dominion of the Livonian Order within Terra Mariana from 1346. It was first documented in a 1503 deed issued by Master of the Order Wolter von Plettenberg, and was the site of an outer harbor of the City of Narva from the 16th century, containing several timber stockyards, sawmills, and a small shipbuilding industry. The German name Hungerburg allegedly goes back to the Russian emperor Peter the Great, who during the 1704 Battle of Narva noticed the great poverty of the rural population. The Narva-J√µesuu Lighthouse was erected in 1808. Tourism Beach life in Narva-J√µesuu Thanks to its -long white sand beach lined with pine trees ‚Äì considered one of the finest in Estonia ‚Äì Narva-J√µesuu has long been a popular summer destination. In the late 19th and early 20th century it was a spa town frequented by the nobility from Saint Petersburg, which is less than to the east, and from Moscow. During the Soviet period it was visited in large numbers by residents of the renamed Leningrad, particularly the Russian intelligentsia, many of whom have bought dachas (summer houses) in Narva-J√µesuu or on the outskirts. In the first ten to fifteen years after the restoration of Estonia's independence, Narva-J√µesuu saw few visitors; thus, a large number of hotels and guest houses closing their doors and going out of business. In the last few years its resort facilities have been renovated and the number of tourists is rising, however, the number of hotels is still considerably lower in comparison to the late 1980s. Near Narva-J√µesuu, southwest from the town border lies the Narva-J√µesuu nudist beach, the only official nudist beach in Estonia.

It was released as a single in 1988 and went to No. 3 in the United States, becoming their fourth top-ten hit. It also reached the top 10 in Canada and New Zealand and the top 20 in Ireland and the United Kingdom. The vocal style of the song is described as \\"T.Rex meets Eddie Cochran with backing vocals\\", according to lead singer Joe Elliott in the liner notes for Vault: Def Leppard Greatest Hits (1980-1995). There are two mixes of the song that appeared in the single: the \\"Atomic Mix\\", which is the album version, and the \\"Nuclear Mix\\", which is an extended version. Music video The video for the song was the second to feature Def Leppard in a live arena setting. On 12‚Äì13 February 1988, the band recorded two shows at the McNichols Arena in Denver, Colorado for a future live film release. However, a month later, \\"Armageddon It\\" was set to be released as the sixth single off the popular Hysteria album and a promo video clip was urgently needed. From the band's end, there was hesitation to film another concept video. Although they were happy with the results for \\"Hysteria\\" and \\"Animal\\", they were very unsatisfied with the way \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\\" had turned out for its concept. Therefore, an idea was pitched to quickly create a video edited from the Denver footage. It was another hit in the UK, reaching the Top 20.

It is known for the rich history and large number of historical monuments, such as 17th- and 18th-century churches and examples of Bulgarian National Revival architecture, which have turned it into a popular tourist destination. The name of the village is derived from the word Arbanas meaning \\"Albanian\\" in Bulgarian of the medieval period. During the Ottoman era, the Turkish term Arnavud meaning \\"Albanian\\" was also used as a name for the village. As of 2005, Arbanasi has a population of 291 and the mayor is Tosho Krastev. It lies at , 400 metres above sea level. History =Early history= The lack of other documentary material leaves different opinions and speculations about the settlement's origin, name and population. It is accepted by some scholars that the village was populated by Bulgarian boyars that came from the westernmost parts of the Second Bulgarian Empire after Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria's important victory over the Byzantines near Klokotnitsa on 9 March 1230, when the tsar conquered \\"the land of the Albanians\\" (–∑—î–º—ß –∞—Ä–±–∞–Ω–∞—Å–∫—´—´). This assumption is supported by 19th century notes from Georgi Rakovski and other scholars, but by no direct evidence or contemporary source. The Nativity of Christ church in Arbanasi, 16th - 17th century The earliest written document that marks the beginning of Arbanasi's history is a royal decree by the Ottoman sultan Suleiman the Magnificent from 1538, according to which the sultan offered the lands of the modern localities of Arbanasi, Lyaskovets, Gorna Oryahovitsa and Dolna Oryahovitsa to his son-in-law Grand Vizier Rustem Pasha as a gift. The four villages are united under the name Arnaud Kariyeleri (\\"the Albanian villages\\") in the document, and the first settlers may have been Albanians and Greeks from Epirus; although Albanian- sounding names could be found in the Ottoman tax registers, Orthodox and Slavic names already prevailed. The tax registers of 1541-1544 describe Arnavud k√∂y (also Darƒ± ova) as a village of 63 households and 72 unmarried men. In 1579-1580, it already numbered 271 households and 277 unmarried men, or a quadruple increase for forty years, indicating an influx of settlers. The village preserved its purely Christian character and prospered in the 17th century. Old house in Arbanasi Other sources that mention Arbanasi are the notes of Pavel ƒêorƒëiƒá from 10 January 1595 addressed to the Transylvanian Prince Sigismund B√°thory. The village is also mentioned by the Roman Catholic bishop of Sofia Petar Bogdan Bakshev, who visited Tarnovo in 1640. He remarked there was a village up in the mountains, from where the whole of Tarnovo could be seen, that had about 1,000 houses. Another Roman Catholic bishop, Anton Stefanov, refers to Arbanasi in 1685. According to his account, there were Arbanasi merchants trading in Italy, Hungary, Poland and particularly in Muscovy. =Heyday and decline= Greek from the Church of the Nativity of Christ, Arbanasi (the Bulgarian Orthodox population in the Ottoman Empire until 1870 was under the spiritual authority of the Greek Patriarchate of Constantinople) There is considerably richer documentary material, such as correspondence and chronicler's notes on religious books, preserved from the 17th and 18th century, that evidences that Arbanasi reached its economic blossoming between the second half of the 17th and the end of the 18th century. The settlement had over 1,000 houses at the time, its population consisting mostly of eminent merchant families who traded in Transylvania (mostly Sibiu and Bra≈üov), the Danubian Principalities, Russia and Poland. Handicrafts were well-developed, with copper- and goldsmithing, vine-growing and silk production playing an important part. The homes of the rich merchants, as well as the five churches built in the years of progress, bear record of the economic upsurge and prosperity. In the 18th century, Arbanasi was regularly donated by the Phanariote rulers of Wallachia, and a number of expelled Wallachian nobles settled temporarily in the village, e.g. Nicolae Br√¢ncoveanu, Ioan (Ianache) VƒÉcƒÉrescu, etc. In 1790, there were 17 Wallachian nobles with their families in Arbana»ôi. To this day, some of the houses in Arbanasi bear the names of their former Wallachian owners (Br√¢ncoveanu, Cantacuzino, Filipescu). As a result of well-organized brigand raids in 1792, 1798 ad 1810, the settlement was pillaged and burnt down. The plague and cholera epidemics further damaged the town's well-being. The richest merchants fled to Wallachia and Russia. A new settlement of Bulgarians began after 1810, when people came down from the Elena and Teteven parts of the Balkan Mountains, but Arbanasi could never again reach its former heyday. An Ottoman royal decree of 1839 deprived the town of its former privileges and the development of handicraftsmanship after the Crimean War almost ceased. Arbanasi experienced strong Greek cultural influence for centuries. There was a Greek school and divine services were in Greek (at that time Bulgarian Orthodox Church was banned by the Ottoman authorities and Bulgarian orthodox population officially had to be served by the Greek Orthodox Church). This, however, did not reflect the local population's national self-consciousness, as Arbanasi residents took part in the organized armed struggle of Bulgarians that ultimately led to the Liberation of Bulgaria from Ottoman rule as a consequence of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78.

Upland birds tend to be found on the ground in heavy cover, so hunters generally employ the use of gun dogs to locate and retrieve game. The average group consists of 2-4 hunters with 1-2 dogs. Normally, if there is one dog the owner usually handles the dog while the others focus on shooting. Depending upon their method of work, some dogs point game and some flush game. When flushed, either by the hunter or the dog, the hunter then attempts to shoot the birds on the wing. This is also known as wingshooting. Equipment Upland hunters use all types of shotguns from break-breach guns to semi-automatics, and .410 bore through 12 gauge. The quintessential shotgun for upland hunting is a double barrel shotgun in a smaller gauge such as a 16, 20 or 28 gauge. Upland guns can be extremely valuable, often commanding many thousands of dollars. In America (though not in the UK), some states, such as Alabama and Arkansas, require upland hunters to wear blaze orange clothing for safety. They often wear vests to carry game, though there is a recent trend toward more functional technical daypacks specifically designed for the demands of more rigorous upland hunting in remote areas. Dogs Upland hunters work specially trained gun dogs to find game. Spaniels and pointing breeds are used most often, though retrievers are worked with considerable success when hunting pheasant in many areas. alt=Upland Game hunting for quail in California. Upland hunters traditionally walk when finding game, though quail hunters in the Southern States often employ hunting buggies or vehicles due to the sparseness of game. Because of the large area that must be covered in order to find bobwhite quail many hunters employ specially designed hunting buggies to haul gear and kennels for fresh dogs. On the other hand, chukar and Hungarian partridge hunters of much of the western U.S. will hunt with one or two dogs on the ground for the duration of the hunt, hiking 8+ miles of steep mountain terrain in a single hunt with well conditioned dogs. An important component of upland hunting for hunters is their partnership with their canine hunting companion. The breed of dog chosen by a hunter should first and foremost fit the style of hunting of the hunter and then the primary type of upland bird being hunted for the relationship to be successful. A puppy's training may begin when the dog is around 4 months old. Training often involves reinforcement of canine hunting instinct, and some common training tools are: whistles, 6 & 20 ft choke leashes, and shock collars. A puppy can be brought into the field within a year, but dogs reach prime ability at closer to 3 or 4 years old. Location Pheasant hunting, the most popular form of upland hunting takes place primarily in open fields which provides cover for birds. Upland birds can be hunted in a wide variety of habitats from deserts to high mountain elevations. This variety of locations is part of what makes upland hunting so popular. Some states such as South Dakota derive a significant portion of their revenue from upland hunters who travel into the state to take advantage of the ideal settings. Numerous pheasant hunting lodges are prevalent throughout South Dakota. Most of them are in the eastern half of the state. Location is important when deciding the species of upland bird you want to hunt. Upland birds are found throughout the United States and much of the world. Although this sport is most popular, by number of participants, in the United States. There are two different ways that hunters can approach upland hunting. the more challenging way is hunting wild birds. This is done in less populated parts of the country especially the midwest. The second way is hunting farmed birds. Popular birds by region in the United States: *Eastern/Northeast: forest grouse *Southeast: bobwhite quail *South: bobwhite quail *Midwest/Prairie: pheasants, prairie grouse *North Central Tier: forest grouse *Intermountain West: partridge, sage-grouse, prairie grouse *West: partridge, quail See also *Upland game References Bird hunting Hunting in the United States PHEASANT HUNTING TIPS ","title":"Upland hunting"},{"id":"4350085","text":"Thirukonasala Vaipavam is an important literary work in Tamil on the history of historic Koneswaram Temple, Trincomalee, Sri Lanka.

Stars * Iota Aurigae * Alpha Aurigae * Beta Aurigae * Theta Aurigae * Gamma Aurigae\\" Characteristics The Five Chariots otherwise known as Auriga is a constellation that borders Taurus. The constellation is named as such due to the five main stars, representing the five celestial emperors. The constellation appears within the region of the sky dominated by the White Tiger of the West. Within the region of the White Tiger of the West there are seven mansions, the Five Chariots resides under the net mansion. Five Celestial Emperors The Five Celestial Emperors (Wu Ti) represent the five elements. Four of them represent the four seasons, but the fifth represents the center, otherwise known as the circumpolar region. The Eastern Emperor, T'ai Hao, represents wood. The Northern Emperor represents fire, and the Southern Emperor represents water. The one in the middle known as Shao Hao is associated with earth. Finally the Western Emperor, Huang Ti, represents the element metal. They can be recognized by the v-necked coats they wear, this is the case with most major divinities, as well as the regions they occupy. These emperors were in control of life and death, and as such people regularly made sacrifices, or gave offerings, to them. The Celestial Emperors are often depicted in mirrors. They also appear often in the sarcophagi of people that were important during this time period as they played a major role in funerals. This is due to the fact that the emperors are constantly controlling life and death. =Planets= All of the emperors can also be represented by certain planets, for example, the Southern Emperor is often associated with the \\"fire star\\" otherwise known as Mars. The Eastern emperor is associated with the \\"wood star\\" equivalent to Jupiter. Venus is associated with the Western Emperor as Venus was known as the \\"metal star\\". The \\"water star\\", known today as Mercury is associated with the Northern Emperor. Lastly the Emperor of the Center is represented by the \\"Earth star\\" also known as Saturn. =Colors= Another distinction that can be attributed to each of the emperors is a specific color. The emperor of the East is represented by green, the South red, the Center yellow, the West white, and the North black. Each of the colors that are associated with the Celestial emperors have their own meaning in Chinese culture. The color green is representative of spring, wood, and things that taste sour. White represents metal, as well as fall. It can also be associated with an acrid taste. Black can be seen to represent winter and the element of water, as well as the taste of salt. Yellow is seen as being related to earth and a sweet taste, there is no season as this is the Central Emperor. Summer, fire, and a bitter taste can be related to the color red. =Natures= Each divinity is often associated with a certain nature, regarding their characteristics as individual deities. The Black Emperor, also known as the Black Ruler is represented as a dark warrior. A green dragon is often associated with the Green Ruler. The Red Ruler is often regarded as a scarlet bird. The White Ruler is associated with a white tiger. Lastly the Yellow Ruler is represented by a unicorn. These distinctions directly correlate with the representation of areas of the celestial realm. There is The dark warrior of the North, The Azure Dragon of the East, The Vermillion Bird of the South, and the White Tiger of the West.

History During the 19th century and early 20th century it was a popular commercial apple due to the ruggedness and keeping qualities of the fruit, but as packing and transportation techniques improved the cultivar fell out of favor, replaced by others considered to have better flavor. It was known to fruit growers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a \\"mortgage lifter\\" because it was a reliable producer and the fruit would not drop from the trees until very late in the season. By mid- twentieth century it was mostly used as a process apple rather than a table apple, and orchards were replacing it with more popular varieties. The cultivar is now very rare to nonexistent in the commercial trade. It is still grown in parts of California, Maine, and Pennsylvania. Related apples The Ben Davis was crossbred with the 'McIntosh' to create the Cortland, which has been a very successful pie apple. Similar cultivars known as Gano or Black Ben Davis appeared in parts of the American South (notably Arkansas and Virginia) in the 1880s. They are said to be either seedlings of, or identical to the original Ben Davis, but the exact relationship is unknown.

It is located between the town of Torpoint and the village of Antony in the county of Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. It is a Grade I listed building. The house is faced in silvery-grey Pentewan stone, flanked by colonnaded wings of mellow brick and overlooks the River Lynher. It was built for Sir William Carew, 5th Baronet between 1718 and 1724, and ever since has continued as the primary residence of the Carew family, who have owned the estate since the mid-16th century. Sir John Carew Pole gave the house and formal gardens into the care of the National Trust in 1961, on the understanding that the family could continue to reside there. Currently Tremayne Carew Pole, lives there with his family. The house and gardens are open to viewing by the public between March and October. Collections and furnishings One of the portraits held at Antony House: Thomas Coventry, 1st Baron Coventry by Cornelis Janssens van Ceulen Antony House hosts a splendid collection of portraits, including a portrait of Charles I of England at his trial, (Charles I granted a baronetcy to the Poles in 1628). The collection contains some of Sir Joshua Reynolds' works, and a portrait of Rachel Carew, believed to have inspired Daphne du Maurier's novel My Cousin Rachel. Rooms are heavily panelled in Dutch Oak and contain fine collections of 18th-century furnishings and textiles. Gardens and estate The grounds were landscaped by Georgian garden designer Humphry Repton and include the formal garden with the \\"National Collection of Day Lilies\\". Anthony House National Trust In the early 19th century, yew hedges and topiary were added to the formal landscaping. Adorning the gardens are stone carvings from North West India, a Burmese temple bell brought to Antony by General Sir Reginald Pole Carew, statuary and more recently acquired modern sculptures, including the Antony Cone water sculpture by William Pye. This echoes the grand spectacle of the topiary yew cone nearby, which is almost as tall as the house itself. Other sculptures include Jupiter Stone by Peter Randall-Page and Hypercone by Simon Thomas. Other notable features include a black walnut tree, cork tree, a Japanese ornamental pond and knot garden. The dovecote dates from the 18th century, while a folly has been added recently in the estate grounds. The surrounding woodland garden (not National Trust, but owned by the Carew Pole Garden Trust) is noted for rhododendrons, azaleas, camellias and magnolias, and surrounding woods provide delightful walks, which extend down to the river Lynher. The Bath Pond House situated in the woodland walks was built in 1789. Film location Filming for the 2010 Disney film production of Alice in Wonderland, directed by Tim Burton, took place in the grounds of Antony House in September 2008. The estate was also used as a location for a Rosamunde Pilcher TV movie by German company ZDF with director Dieter Kehler.

It runs from Montee Paiement to the Gatineau River. It is named after French urban planner Jacques Gr√©ber. It was once part of Route 148 of the provincial network. The southern part of the route includes numerous stores, restaurants, gentlemen's clubs and motels. About 1 km north of Boulevard Maloney (or Maloney Boulevard) it travels through a residential area with apartment buildings on the west side and small houses on the east side. Most of the road has four lanes as the traffic flow is quite heavy particularly near the junction with Autoroute 50 and the commercial district. On the southern stretch between La Savane and the Lady Aberdeen Bridge there is a bus lane for STO routes, since most express routes and regular direct routes towards Ottawa travel via Greber. The STO has built three park-and-ride facilities in the vicinity so that passengers can take advantage of the transit priority measures. Express buses employ a closed-door policy in which they generally skip the stops in the designated lane section. The STO is looking at the possibility of extending the reserved lanes further north. North of Boulevard La Verendrye, it becomes a two-lane arterial road that runs beside Autoroute 50 for much of its length until it ends near the Terrasses Paiement/Ravin Boises residential neighbourhood at Montee Paiement just south of the Highway 50 interchange. It is also the site of the Gatineau sector's largest industrial sector (second behind the Richelieu Industrial Park in the Hull sector). The northern and eastern end of the road was formerly called Rue Scullion prior to the 2002 amalgamation that formed a new larger City of Gatineau. Les Promenades Gatineau, Ottawa-Gatineau's largest shopping centre is located on the east side of the road south of Boulevard Maloney. Costco built a new store right beside Gr√©ber in 2006, and moved their operations there from a location in the northern part of the city. Several other malls such as the Village Greber and Place de la Savane are located beside and across from Les Promenades, making the area the most important commercial zone in the old city of Gatineau. Near the Lady Aberdeen Bridges, is one of the most historical churches in the Outaouais region, the St-Francois de Salles church which was built in 1840.  Greber and Maloney intersection  The intersection with Maloney is considered one of the busiest and most congested across the city as motorists often form long lineups waiting to turn north or south onto Gr√©ber. It is also considered one of the most dangerous intersections, because the traffic flow is very high and train tracks are located just to the north of the intersection. Several serious incidents, some fatal, have occurred in the past several years. The intersection will also be the site of significant construction as the STO is planning to build its Rapibus transit roadway alongside the tracks, and a station called Gr√©ber is also part of the plans. The construction will likely affect travel in the area in a couple of years.

The school, founded in 1953, is affiliated to St. Gabriel's Primary School and Catholic Junior College and is one of 7 Gabrielite schools in Singapore. Classes are offered in the Express, Normal Academic and Normal Technical streams. The principal of St. Gabriel's Secondary School is Mr Stephen Chin and its vice- principals are Miss Jackie Cheng and Mr Anith Kumar S/O Nadesan. History St Gabriel's School opened its doors on 3 June 1953 (costing $175,000 with a government contribution of $71,000) and stood at the junction of Hillside Drive and Upper Serangoon Road. Under the supervision of Rev Bro Louis Gonzaga (Founder) and seven pioneer teachers, the school accepted 212 pupils for its first intake, consisting of only five classes: two of Primary 1, one each of Primary 2, Standard 1 and Standard 2. The school was officially declared open on 13 December that year by Michel Olcomendy, Bishop of the Diocese of Singapore and Malacca. In 1954, Brother Elzear became the school's first full- time Director (Principal). Brother Louis Gonzaga took over as director in 1955 and Brother Elzear left to take over management of the parish school in Johore Bahru, Malaysia. In 1958, under the supervision of Brother Camillus, the afternoon session began functioning on its own. Brother Raymond was made director. The year 1958 also marked the publication of the first St. Gabriel's School Annual (Magazine). In 1959, the school had its first Secondary Four class, thus attaining the status of a full school. Under the leadership of Brother Adolphus, the class sat for the Overseas School Certificate Examinations (Cambridge) and achieved a high passing rate of 90%. Brother Emmanuel took over the reins in 1961. Leo Remedios and Paul Lee became first two senior assistants of the school. 1961 also marked the formation of St. Gabriel's Old Boys' Association. Brother Noel became the director in 1963. By 1968, St. Gabriel's School had a total of 47 classes for both the morning and afternoon sessions, with an enrolment of 2,000 students. The school was reaching its available capacity. To solve this problem, the primary section of the school was relocated to a new building on Highland Road on 2 January 1969 and officially declared open on 12 July that year, hence the creation of two separate schools, namely St. Gabriel's Primary School and St. Gabriel's Secondary School. With the establishment of the Primary School, the Secondary School was reorganised, with a shift in emphasis towards technical education. Some premises were converted into machine and electrical workshops to cater to the needs of pupils of SGSS and three neighbouring schools. Brother Emmanuel took over the reins again in 1969 following the sudden death of Brother Noel. Leadership was passed on to Brother Edmund James in 1974 and Mr Peter Tan was appointed Senior Assistant of the school. The Brothers of St. Gabriel's were at the helm of the school for 30 years (1953‚Äì1983) before the leadership was passed on to lay principals in 1984. In line with Ministry of Education's guidelines, the school went single-session in 1986. The school had its first and only female principal, Mrs Ng Peng Hock, in 1990. In May 1992, St. Gabriel's moved to its current premises at Serangoon Avenue 1 and was officially opened in August 1993. At present, the school teaches the default GCE 'O' and 'N' Level syllabus as outlined by the Ministry of Education.St. Gabriel's Primary School . School History.

Academic achievements An early example of academic success for St Gabriel's came in 1970 when the school attained 71% passes in the Senior Cambridge examination results. St. Gabriel's School produced its first President's Scholar in 1978 (Dr. Ramani, graduated 1975). The school has its second President's Scholar, Francis Chong, in 1989. In the 2009 National Secondary School Rankings, St. Gabriel's Secondary School was ranked a Band 3 and 8 (Normal and Express respectively).

One example of such a collaboration is their biannual concert, SingOut, which is held together with Presbyterian High School and Holy Innocents High School. The choir is currently under the tutelage of conductors Ms Flora Yee and Ms Rose Loh. The guitar ensemble won gold and silver in SYF in 2009 and 2011 respectively Sports Although the school does not have an annual sports day, it states that sports facilities and equipment are readily available to students. Badminton nets are set up on the parade square, and the indoor sports hall is available for students wishing to play futsal. There is an inter-class soccer tournament for Secondary 3, and the possibility of expanding this idea to other levels and sports was under consideration at the end of 2011. At national level, St. Gabriel's won first in table tennis in 2009 and again in 2011. In past years it has won 2nd in golf and 3rd in judo. In 2009 it attracted attention because five of its table tennis team's seven members were from China. School Crest & Motto School Badge (1953-2007) School Crest (2007-Present) The school crest was formally introduced in 2007 to replace the school badge (1953‚Äì2007) and is now used by all Gabrielite institutions. This is in line with the St. Gabriel's Foundation's aim to forge a common identity for all Gabrielite institutions in the SE-Asia Region. Components of the School Crest are as follows: A.M. with the lily flower: \\"A.M.\\" is an abbreviation for \\"Ave Maria\\". It represents the greeting of the Angel Gabriel to Mary. It also shows the Patron Saint St. Louis de Monfort's strong devotion to Our Lady. D+S with a cross: D.S. comes from the French words \\"Dieu Seul\\", which can be translated as \\"God alone\\". God Alone is the all-motivating force in the life of St. Louis Marie de Montfort. Sailboat at sea: represents the hardships we experience through life. Just like the sailors at sea, if we are able to face hardship and overcome difficulties, we will come out being better people. Star and the man in the boat: symbolizes the Star of the sea, where seamen navigate to their destination in the vast ocean. If we are focused on the essential values of life, we shall reach our ultimate destiny in life. The Star of the sea shall be the guiding light that lights up the way in our life. Olive branches: symbolizes peace and prosperity. It is thus the duty of each one to promote peace in the world, a peace that will last. Coupled with peace is prosperity, which connotes not only the generation of wealth but also the integral development of human society. Labor Omnia Vincit: which stands for \\"Labour conquers all things\\". Hard work embodied in diligence and perseverance leads one to achieve greater things in life.Monfort Centre. School Crest.

School ties must be worn on Mondays. For significant breaches of school discipline, the standard consequence is corporal punishment. Students receive caning, preceded and followed by counselling; parents are informed. Students who are late to school for a sixth time in one term receive two strokes of the cane. The strokes are administered to the seat of the offender's trousers; in all but rare serious cases, the punishment is meted out privately in the school office. Brother Emmanuel, principal of St Gabriel's from 1961 to 1963 and again from 1969 to 1974, has been described by the Catholic News as \\"a disciplinarian whose cane has graced the backsides of many boys\\". He is quoted as saying that many of those he caned had told him of the need for the discipline they received from him. In his view, the punishment must be a careful, considered ceremony: \\"No one should ever cane a boy on impulse\\", he said. As of 2012, at age 78, Bro. Emmanuel is still on the school's Management Committee as Supervisor. In 1970, seven or eight boys were found to be smoking ganja (cannabis), but the problem was stamped out with counselling, guidance and warnings, according to the then principal. Exchange Programmes The school has annual exchange programmes with Kitago Junior High School in Miyazaki Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan. Affiliation The school is affiliated with St. Gabriel's Primary School (SGPS), giving SGPS students priority for admission. St. Gabriel's is also affiliated to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore and the Monfort Brothers of Christian Instruction of St Gabriel. Other Gabrielite Schools in Singapore include: Assumption English School, Montfort Secondary School, Montfort Junior School and Assumption Pathway School. Contrary to popular belief, St. Gabriel's is not affiliated with the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools or any of its schools. It does maintain friendly relationships with them, however. Past Principals * Brother Louis Gonzaga (1953‚Äì1954) (Founder) * Rev.

Instead, it takes its name from the nearby Talladega National Forest. History The track was originally built in 1985 by brothers David and Mike Upchurch, and Gerald Rhodes to provide a place for local road racing enthusiasts to race and practice. The track was also built with motorcycle racing in mind and the layout has no hard barriers anywhere that could injure a rider. For many years the track was used for car clubs events, motorcycle riding schools, and kart races, but the pavement of the track was notorious for being incredibly damaging to tires. It was common for those who drove their cars to the track to find themselves unable to drive home due to shredded tires. In 2000 the track was completely repaved with a much better surface, and the middle section of the track was lengthened. These improvements brought in many more events and now most weekends are booked by a variety of car clubs, schools, and track days. Layout the old track layout The track is run in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions. Generally during schools and track days the course will be run one way in the morning, and the other after a lunch or instruction break. Races may run the same way all weekend, or one way one day, the other the next. This has changed. The track is now only run in a counter clockwise direction. The track rewards handling over horsepower as its straights are very short, and the corners are reasonably long and fast. Little Tally is not a complex track, but it certainly has character, especially the first turns in either direction. Talladega Gran Prix Raceway was redesigned and repaved in 2007. The new layout is near the top of the page. Location The track is approximately 3 miles (4.8 km) southwest of Munford on State Route 21. The area is mostly pastures and farmland and the track is easy to miss for those unfamiliar with its location. Map Coordinates: Renting the track Little Talladega is open all year round and can be rented for several types of events.

The loop theorem was first proven by Christos Papakyriakopoulos in 1956, along with Dehn's lemma and the Sphere theorem. A simple and useful version of the loop theorem states that if for some 3-dimensional manifold M with boundary ‚àÇM there is a map :fcolon (D^2,partial D^2)to (M,partial M) with fpartial D^2 not nullhomotopic in partial M, then there is an embedding with the same property. The following version of the loop theorem, due to John Stallings, is given in the standard 3-manifold treatises (such as Hempel or Jaco): Let M be a 3-manifold and let S be a connected surface in partial M . Let Nsubset pi_1(S) be a normal subgroup such that mathop{mathrm{ker}}(pi_1(S) to pi_1(M)) - N eq emptyset. Let :f colon D^2to M be a continuous map such that :f(partial D^2)subset S and :[fpartial D^2] otin N. Then there exists an embedding :gcolon D^2to M such that :g(partial D^2)subset S and :[gpartial D^2] otin N. Furthermore if one starts with a map f in general position, then for any neighborhood U of the singularity set of f, we can find such a g with image lying inside the union of image of f and U. Stalling's proof utilizes an adaptation, due to Whitehead and Shapiro, of Papakyriakopoulos' \\"tower construction\\". The \\"tower\\" refers to a special sequence of coverings designed to simplify lifts of the given map. The same tower construction was used by Papakyriakopoulos to prove the sphere theorem (3-manifolds), which states that a nontrivial map of a sphere into a 3-manifold implies the existence of a nontrivial embedding of a sphere. There is also a version of Dehn's lemma for minimal discs due to Meeks and S.-T. Yau, which also crucially relies on the tower construction. A proof not utilizing the tower construction exists of the first version of the loop theorem. This was essentially done 30 years ago by Friedhelm Waldhausen as part of his solution to the word problem for Haken manifolds; although he recognized this gave a proof of the loop theorem, he did not write up a detailed proof. The essential ingredient of this proof is the concept of Haken hierarchy. Proofs were later written up, by Klaus Johannson, Marc Lackenby, and Iain Aitchison with Hyam Rubinstein. References *W.

Until July 2006, Wilkow had been on WGY in Schenectady, New York, (weekday mornings) and WABC in New York City (Sunday mornings). He calls himself the \\"next generation of great talk radio\\", a nickname given to him by Mark Levin. Wilkow is also a contributor to the website Conservative Punk. He has a television show on TheBlaze. Wilkow was raised in the Long Island town of Bellmore, New York, where he attended Hebrew school prior to his Bar mitzvah. Wilkow's interest in radio began during his freshman year of college at SUNY Delhi at that college's campus station, WDTU. After transferring from Delhi to a local community college where he obtained his associate degree, he finished his college education at the University of Florida, graduating in 1996 with a degree in Communications. While there, he held an airshift at that school's commercially run WRUF-FM and was a member of Sigma Alpha Mu fraternity. Before entering talk radio in 2002 he had stints as a disc jockey at WCLG-FM in Morgantown, West Virginia, (as \\"Andrew Steele\\") and at WMRQ in Hartford, Connecticut (as \\"Wilkow\\"). Wilkow became a regular Sunday morning host at WABC while keeping his air shift at WMRQ. When WMRQ switched format from alternative rock to hip hop, he moved into talk radio full-time when he filled the 5-7 p.m. shift on WGY in October 2003. After becoming a ratings success, Wilkow moved to the 9-11:40 a.m. slot in May 2005, replacing Glenn Beck, when WGY wanted to clear the third hour of Sean Hannity. At WGY, Wilkow became known for being a vocal rival of the Democratic party in Albany (which he refers to as the \\"entrenched Democratic Machine\\".) In June 2006, Wilkow announced his departure from both WGY and WABC in order to host a talk show on Sirius Satellite Radio; his last show on WGY was July 14, and his last show on WABC was on July 30. Since August 9, 2006, Wilkow has hosted his own program on the Sirius Patriot channel on Sirius Satellite radio, The Wilkow Majority. The advertising for the program claims it is rooted in \\"one thing and one thing only, and that is rational thought.\\" On August 23, 2006, Wilkow returned to the airwaves of WABC, where he filled in for regular weekday host Mark Levin. On July 14, 2007 Wilkow married Brittany, the daughter of WABC program director, Phil Boyce. He currently hosts a three-hour session beginning at 9 A.M. West/12 P.M. East Monday-Friday, with replays after Rusty Humphries in the evenings and on weekends. He frequently appeared as a panelist on TheBlaze internet program Real News from the Blaze. Wilkow joined TheBlaze in a new show called Wilkow!. On June 27, 2014, Wilkow announced through social media that he will no longer be hosting Wilkow! on The Blaze. On his radio program airing that same day, Wilkow cited the reason was related to his desire to spend more time with his children. Wilkow appears in Attack of Life: The Bang Tango Movie, a 2016 documentary film about 80s hard rock band Bang Tango; directed by Drew Fortier. On January 31, 2018 Andrew Wilkow started hosting a new version of Wilkow on CRTV, which would merge with TheBlaze to form BlazeTV later in 2018. The beginning of Wilkows show on CRTV follows the same tagline as his radio show of stating \\"Patriot First, Conservative Second, and Republican Third\\" Wilkow also makes it a point to close his Television show with tagline \\"The arguments on this television program will not be broken.\\" See also References External links *Andrew Wilkow: **Official Wilkow Majority Site **Made In the USA Shopping Guide **Myspace **Facebook **Conservative Punk - Andrew Wilkow was a founder and is a contributor. *Andrew Wilkow commentary: **Pelosi vs Lugosi 2010, by Andrew Wilkow, ParcBench, January 18, 2010. **Obama missing a beat - Why not sell America to the Americans?, by Andrew Wilkow and Nick Rizzuto, Washington Times, November 4, 2009. **Pelosi's Chickens Home to Roost; Her Attacks on the CIA's Credibility Have Damaged Her Own, by Andrew Wilkow and Nick Rizzuto, Washington Times, May 19, 2009. **GE a Corporate Sponsor, by Andrew Wilkow and Nick Rizzuto, Washington Times, May 11, 2009. *Andrew Wilkow fans: **Unofficial Fan Site **Tcunation.com Andrew Wilkow Fans *Andrew Wilkow videos: **Video: Wilkow rolling in mud at HIV/AIDS fundraising event **Video: Andrew Wilkow on Glenn Beck Show - May 12, 2009 - about GE and Obama healthcare tie. **Video: Save Jersey's Matt Rooney talks to Andrew Wilkow - May 17, 2009 **Video: Andrew on Lou Dobbs Show, CNN - July 24, 2009 **Video: Andrew on Joy Behar Show, CNN Headline News - 06 Oct 2009 1972 births Living people American adoptees American talk radio hosts State University of New York at Delhi alumni University of Florida alumni People from Hollywood, Florida People from Bellmore, New York TheBlaze people ","title":"Andrew Wilkow"},{"id":"4350158","text":"Johann Gottlob Leidenfrost Johann Gottlob Leidenfrost (27 November 1715 ‚Äì 2 December 1794) was a German doctor and theologian who first described the scientific phenomenon eponymously named the Leidenfrost effect. Personal life and career Johann Gottlob Leidenfrost was born in Rosperwenda in the County of Stolberg-Stolberg. His father, Johann Heinrich Leidenfrost, was a well-known minister. Little is known of Leidenfrost's life prior to the start of his academic career. Leidenfrost first attended the University of Gie√üen where he followed in his father's footsteps by studying theology. He soon switched his academic concentration to medicine, following that career path in his subsequent attendance at the University of Leipzig and the University of Halle. In 1741 he was awarded a doctorate in medicine largely based on a well- received treatise on the study of the movement of the human body, entitled On the Harmonious Relationship of Movements in the Human Body. After the conclusion of his academic studies, Leidenfrost spent some years traveling and took a post as a field physician in the first Silesian War. In 1743 Leidenfrost was offered and accepted a professorship at the University of Duisburg. In 1745 he married a local Duisburg woman, Anna Cornelia Kalckhoff. Johann and Anna had seven children together, including Johanna Ulricke (1752‚Äì1819), who was later the wife of the noted German theologian, Christian Krafft. In addition to teaching medicine, physics and chemistry at the University of Duisburg, Leidenfrost also functioned as the university's rector, all the while maintaining a private medical practice. In 1756, Leidenfrost became a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences. During his lifetime, Leidenfrost published more than seventy manuscripts, including De Aquae Communis Nonnullis Qualitatibus Tractatus (1756) (\\"A Tract About Some Qualities of Common Water\\") in which the Leidenfrost effect was first described (although the phenomenon had been previously observed by Herman Boerhaave in 1732). Leidenfrost died in Duisburg. Leidenfrost effect Leidenfrost droplet The effect Leidenfrost described is a phenomenon in which a liquid, in near contact with a mass significantly hotter than its boiling point, produces an insulating vapor layer which keeps that liquid from boiling rapidly. It is most commonly seen when cooking; one sprinkles drops of water in a skillet to gauge its temperature. If the skillet's temperature is at or above the Leidenfrost point, the water skitters across the metal and takes longer to evaporate than it would in a skillet that is hot, but at a temperature below the Leidenfrost point. It has also been used in some more risky demonstrations, such as dipping a wet finger in molten lead or blowing out a mouthful of liquid nitrogen, both enacted without injury to the demonstrator.

The 2,000-seat venue opened in 1928 as the Pantages Theater, after the name of its then owner, Alexander Pantages, and later, the Warner Theater in 1929 after it was purchased by Warner Brothers. The name was changed again in the 1960s to \\"Warnors\\" to avoid trademark issues. The theater was designed by B. Marcus Priteca, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Organ The theater features a unit orchestra (a pipe organ which includes numerous features and instruments, meant to be able to replicate sounds of a full orchestra with only one organist), which was manufactured by the Robert Morton Organ Company of Van Nuys, California and installed in 1928. The organ was to be used to accompany silent films. Around the same time the organ was to be installed, movies were beginning to include sound. The theater tried to cancel the order but the organ was installed anyway. The organ has 14 ranks built with 1,035 pipes and a four-manual console with 720 keys, pedals and combination pistons. The organ was used primarily for motion pictures until 1973. Because of the cost of paying orchestra members, most accompanying orchestras were replaced with unit orchestras. The Berlin Philharmonic gave a concert in the theater on November 15, 1956, under its new music director Herbert von Karajan.

It starts at Autoroute 50 via an incomplete interchange and ends at the boundary with the former city of Masson-Angers. It is also known as Route 148. However, one may notice a blue shield sign of the highway on the westbound lane at Boulevard Gr√©ber even if it is not the highway itself as the western portion previous terminated at Maloney before more extensions (as a by-pass for the Gatineau sector) towards Masson-Angers were made in 1986 (and eventually the connection with the eastern segment in Lachute in 2010). Route 148 continues further east towards Buckingham and further east to Laval. Prior to the construction of A-50, was the main roadway through the urban community towards Montreal, the Papineau region and the Laurentides. East/West arterial This Road has a Western Section called Boulevard Maloney Ouest and another called Boulevard Maloney Est. Rue Main is the dividing arterial of the Ouest-Est section. Addresses are climbing towards the west and towards the east of this street. Features Most of the road is filled with numerous big-box stores, strip malls or other commercial businesses. Near Boulevard Gr√©ber in the western end of this road, Les Promenades Gatineau, the National Capital Region's second largest shopping mall which is home to Simons, Librarie Renaud-Bray, Sports Experts, Costco, Hudson's Bay and many more stores. There are other small malls, big box stores, and strip plazas all along the road. Stores (not necessarily all on Maloney) includes SuperC, Walmart, Canadian Tire, Loblaws, Provigo, Metro, Jean Coutu, Simons, Winners, The Bay, Costco, Maxi, Uniprix, Toys \\"R\\" Us, Best Buy, Brault et Martineau, Linen Chest, The Home Depot & Bureau en Gros. The route is also home to several car dealerships such as Ford, Chevrolet, Toyota & Chrysler. It also has a cinema theater called Cinema 9 along with a Deli Chenoys restaurant. There is also an important Pulp and paper mill owned by Abitibi-Bowater located at the crossing of Boulevard Maloney and Rue Main. Speed Limits Speed limit on this road is mostly 70 km/h with 4 lanes of traffic. There are some sections which has a speed limit of 50 km/h while at its eastern end the speed limit jumps to 90 km/h as it enters a rural area between the former cities of Gatineau and Masson-Angers. However, especially in the Gatineau sector, the flow is much faster. Commuter Route The route itself is one of the most important commuter routes in the old city of Gatineau as it links one end of the sector to another. Communities located alongside the route includes : Les Promenades, Saint-Richard (near Montee Paiement), Saint-Maria Goretti (near Labrosse) and Cheval Blanc (near Lorrain). It also provides an easy access to Highway 50 towards downtown Gatineau and Ottawa. Often due to the importance of this route, traffic tie-ups and congestion can occur particularly near the access to the 50. Rapibus It is also expected that the Rapibus, STO's busway, will travel on beside of the railroad right of way that is located on the north side of this road. The project is expected to be completed by 2012 and will include nearby the road, La Cite, La Gappe, Greber and Gouin stations. Major construction may happen all around the area, which will likely cause major traffic issues closer to the access to Autoroute 50. Sports Complex Also, a new sports complex is expected to be built and completed by 2010 alongside nearby C√©gep de l'Outaouais Felix-Leclerc campus. The complex was planned several years before but various issues and delays pushed back the project which is expected to be opened before the start of the 2010 Quebec Games in which the city of Gatineau won the rights to host the event.

This topic has appeared in mythology and magical fiction.Naithani, Sadhana (2014). Folklore Theory in Postwar Germany. University Press of Mississippi. pp. 48‚Äì52. . In the 21st century there have been numerous reports from around the world of humans marrying their pets and other animals. Human‚Äìanimal marriage is often seen in accordance with zoophilia, although they are not necessarily linked. Although animal-human marriage is not mentioned specifically in national laws, the act of engaging in sexual acts with an animal is illegal in many countries under animal abuse laws.  Animal‚Äìhuman marriage in mythology  The practice of animal-human marriage has made appearances in several mythological stories and folklore, and is often understood to mean a deity-human marriage involving gods or heroes. The Chinese folktale \\"The Goddess of the Silkworm\\" is an example of a tale where a woman marries a horse. A similar Irish legend tells of a king who marries a horse, symbolizing a divine union between the king and the goddess of the land. Also the indigenous Cheyenne have a story of animal-human marriage in \\"The Girl who Married a Dog\\". In addition, there are many Native American stories about people who married animals. In these Native American myths, animal spirits frequently assume human form. They are not seen as literal animals, but representatives from the animal kingdom. According to Bernard Sergent, \\"human‚Äìanimal marriage is an union that is too remote as incest is a too close one. Compared to a balanced marriage, between humans but from another clan or another village, that is to say‚Äìdepending on the society‚Äìwithin the framework of a well measured endogamy or exogamy, incest transgresses the norm because it is an exaggerated endogamy, and animal marriage transgresses it because it is an exaggerated exogamy.\\"  Animal‚Äìhuman marriage in reality Although it is uncertain if there is a legal basis for marrying an animal, several individuals claim to have done so. The Sudanese goat marriage incident made big headlines in 2006 when a man was forced to marry a goat after being caught in a sexual interaction with the goat. Other reports of marriage include animals such as dogs, cats, frogs and a dolphin. Other incidents of human animal relations took place in 2010, when 18-year-old Balinese man Ngurah Alit was found having sexual intercourse with a cow butt, who he claimed flirted with him. As part of a Pecaruan ritual, the man was forced to marry the animal. The ceremony was thought to cleanse the village of the immoral act of bestiality. The cow was drowned in the ocean, while Alit was symbolically drowned as well.

Bentick played for two years in Victoria's top under-18s competition, the TAC Cup for the Calder Cannons. In that time, he established himself as a promising mid- fielder who was particularly good at roving the hit-outs and getting a quick kick out of the packs. Calder dominated the TAC Cup through these years, and under Bentick's captaincy won the 2003 premiership. Despite captaining the premiers and averaging 20 disposals per game in the TAC Cup, Bentick was passed over in the 2003 National Draft. He was eventually picked up as a rookie by Carlton in the rookie draft. Bentick played most of 2004 in Carlton's , the Northern Bullants. He made a strong impression in the VFL, and was elevated to the senior list late in the season. He played the final five games for 2004, debuting at Optus Oval against the Fremantle Dockers. Bentick began 2005 in the Bullants, and was re-elevated to the seniors in Round 8, playing for four weeks, including the Round 9 Optus Oval farewell game against Melbourne. He was dropped after Round 11. His recall to the seniors in Round 18 heralded his permanent position in the team. Given the midfield role he relished, he amassed a high number of possessions, as well as a strong tackling game which could not be ignored. In Round 20 against Collingwood, Bentick's twelfth game, he amassed 34 disposals and 5 tackles. This eye- catching performance earned him an AFL Rising Star award nomination, as well as three Brownlow Medal votes. Bentick was a regular in the team for the next three years. He played the first twenty games of the 2006 season, before missing the final two with a shoulder injury, and played another twenty games in 2007 and fourteen in 2008. He developed into one of the club's most important inside midfielders, adept at winning the hard ball and tackling, a style reminiscent of Brett Ratten, (who was both an assistant coach, and later the head coach, during Bentick's time at Carlton, and whose #7 guernsey Bentick adopted in 2007). Bentick's career-best disposal haul of 36 came in Round 21, 2007 against the Kangaroos, allowing Bentick to achieve the rare feat of earning a Brownlow Medal vote in an 82-point loss. At the time he was delisted, his career average of 5.0 tackles per game was amongst the highest in VFL/AFL history. Bentick was injured for most of the 2009 season. He played the latter part of the season with the Bullants, including their grand final loss against North Ballarat, but did not play a game for Carlton. Bentick was delisted by Carlton at the end of the 2009 season.Changes to the Carlton list for the 2010 season After being delisted, Bentick played three seasons (2010 ‚Äì 2012) with the Port Melbourne Football Club in the VFL, and then shifted to St Bernard's in the Victorian Amateur Football Association in 2013. Bentick captained the VAFA in representative football in 2014, and was joint-winner of the 2015 Woodrow Medal as the VAFA Premier Division Best and Fairest.

The company provided optimized system-level solutions to OEMs for a wide range of products including wireless routers, access points, VoIP gateways, streaming media devices, print servers and other network devices. Ubicom was a venture-backed, privately held company with corporate headquarters in San Jose, California.  History  Ubicom was founded as Scenix Semiconductor in 1996. The company operated under that name until 1999. In 2000, Scenix became \\"Ubicom,\\" a word derived from \\"ubiquitous communications\\". * April 1999: Mayfield Fund leads $10 million equity investment in Scenix. * November 2000: Scenix changes its name to Ubicom. * November 2002: Intersil and Ubicom demonstrate world's first 802.11g wireless access point. * March 2006: Ubicom secures $20 million in Series 3 funding, led by Investcorp Technology Ventures. * March 2012: Ubicom is taken over by Qualcomm.Ubicom Submits to Qualcomm  Products  Ubicom (and as Scenix) designed several families of microcontrollers, including: * The SX Series of 8-bit microcontrollers, a product line which was partially compatible with Arizona Microchip devices and ran at up to 100 MHz, single cycle. This product was eventually sold to Parallax, who continues its production. * The IP series of high performance media and Internet processors. These devices were designed to act as gateways for streaming media and data over wired and wireless links. The Scenix/Ubicom processors relied on very high speed and low latency processing to emulate hardware interfaces in software such as interrupt-polled soft-UARTS. This reduced the size of the silicon chip and therefore the cost, but increased the complexity of the software required on the chip. Ubicom developed its own architecture, the Ubicom32‚Ñ¢, and a real-time operating system (RTOS) for it. For example, the D-Link HD Media Router 3000 DIR-857 contains the Ubicom IP8000AU and the Western Digital WD N900 the Ubicom IP8260U CPU.

This was in 1913, when the Most Reverend Joseph Petrelli, Bishop of the Diocese, asked the help of the RGS Sisters working in Rangoon, Burma to come to Batangas to start the first educational mission of the Church in his Diocese. The challenge to undertake this new mission was enthusiastically taken up by Mother Mary of St. Ligouri and her companions. Within a short span of time, more Sisters from the Mother House in France arrived. There were many difficulties in the beginning but the Irish and American Sisters who pioneered the task surmounted all these through their untiring sacrifices and the generosity of the people in the community. The said sisters started the school with the name St. Bridget Academy. For 34 years the educational program of Saint Bridget was confined to grade school and high school. In 1953 the Boys High School Department was established in answer to the insistent demands of parents who wanted their growing sons to be provided with a Catholic education. His Excellency, the Most Reverend Alejandro Olalia, wholeheartedly endorsed this new department. In 1980 the students of the Boys and Girls High School Departments were integrated into co-educational classes. The undertaking turned out to be a learning process for the administration, the faculty, and the students themselves. It was an attempt to answer the students‚Äô felt need to relate in an atmosphere of friendship, participative discovery, and sharing of one's capabilities, abilities and talents. The integration of the boys and the girls in the academic classes, supplemented with co-curricular and extra curricular activities help them grow and lead wholesome lives. In 1998, sensitive to the rapid development of information technology, St. Bridget took up the challenge of integrating technology in the academic instructions familiarizing students from elementary to College with computers, computer know-how, software programs, the internet, websites, and presentation software. Facilities Elementary Department The Elementary Department is a three floor building which is divided into two buildings. Each classrooms of Grades 4-6 are provided with a built in projector and a mimio toolbar that enriches the education with technology of the school.

The park occupies 8.05 hectares (19.89 acres) of land, and is managed by Leisure and Cultural Services Department. The opening hours are from 6:30 am to 11:00 pm. History Most of the land that the park occupies was reclaimed from Tide Cove during the construction of the Sha Tin New Town, though some of the land existed beforehand and was previously occupied by the Sha Tin Airfield, a military air base. While the park was under construction, a \\"sneak preview\\" was provided to the public as it was temporarily opened from 14 to 17 March 1987 for the Hong Kong Flower Show. The park was opened on 24 August 1988. It was then named as Sha Tin Central Park. It was built and administered by the Regional Council. Shortly following the Tiananmen Square massacre, the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China erected a replica of the Goddess of Democracy statue in Sha Tin Central Park, on a temporary basis, with the approval of the council. Over 4,000 people attended its unveiling on 3 July 1989, with many laying wreathes at the foot of the statue.

The band consisted of Mark Griffiths and Dave Jenkins on guitars, Alan Greed on lead vocals and organ, Roger Swallow on drums, and Steve Miller on bass and backing vocals. They released a single for Philips Records in 1968 (\\"Tobacco Ash Sunday\\" / \\"How Do You Feel\\") before releasing their only album, Heaven and Hell, also on Philips in 1969. A final single followed soon after, before the band split in 1969. Their Heaven and Hell LP is now a highly sought-after rarity, selling for hundreds of pounds between eager collectors. For this reason, Harsh Reality is somewhat famous/infamous in collecting circles. Though seen as part of the proto- progressive rock era, their work represented a marriage between the sounds of Procol Harum, Traffic and early Deep Purple. Following the band's demise, Roger Swallow played with Principal Edwards Magic Theatre, Matthews Southern Comfort, Plainsong, Albion Country Band, and Al Stewart; before moving to California and establishing himself as an electronic musician, songwriter and entrepreneur. Alan Greed went on to work with Ray Russell on the Rock Workshop albums, and as a session singer. Greed later fronted the jazz/progressive outfit, The Running Man. A self-titled album was released in the UK on the Neon record label in 1972. Mark Griffiths has worked with Matthews Southern Comfort, Jonathan Kelly, Al Stewart, David Essex, The Everly Brothers, and Cliff Richard & The Shadows. The rest of the band also went into session work. The song \\"Tobacco Ash Sunday\\" was covered by Paul Weller for AOL Sessions.

It starts at the boundaries of the city of Gatineau and the suburban town of Cantley, Quebec and ends at Boulevard Maloney. On its northern end until Autoroute 50, it runs parallel to the Gatineau River, while it briefly runs parallel to the Ottawa River on its eastern end. Prior to the amalgamation of the city of Gatineau, Rue Saint-Louis was a relatively minor street in the Pointe-Gatineau/La Baie neighbourhood that ran from east of Boulevard Greber to Rue Jacques-Cartier where it became former Avenue Du Golf (Golf Avenue) for the remaining stretch on to Boulevard Maloney. Between Autoroute 50 and Boulevard Greber, it was formerly known as Boulevard Archambault, a small residential artery through the western portions of Pointe-Gatineau. Through most of the stretch between Autoroute 50 and Cantley, Rue Saint-Louis is also known as Route 307. That section was formerly known as Avenue Principale before the 2002 amalgamation - this street name is not to be confused with Rue Principale, which is for the former city of Aylmer's main commercial area. This street is the location of the Coll√®ge Saint-Alexandre, a private secondary school, one of two in the city, the other being the Coll√®ge Saint-Joseph de Hull institution for girls. A professional education centre is also located a few blocks away It is also home to La Baie Park which is the site of the city's annual Gatineau Hot Air Balloon Festival, and the Bowater plant. Alonzo Wright Bridge The bridge, circa 1920, looking east. The busiest section of the road is located near the Alonzo Wright Bridge at the corner of Boulevard La V√©rendrye. Traffic coming from Cantley, Touraine, Limbour, C√¥te d'Azur, Mont-Luc and other areas further east all meet up at that location, causing significant slowdowns during rush hours. It also serves as an alternative route to Autoroute 50 when it is either closed or completely congested in the morning and afternoon. The same situation occurs during the rush hour on Route 105 in Chelsea which connects the bridge. The situation had deteriorated when Boulevard La V√©rendrye was extended west to connect with the bridge in 1999 as well extensive housing developments in Limbour, Mont-Luc and Cantley. There are plans to widen the bridge, which was built in 1964, to possibly four lanes but they have not advanced past the preliminary stages. In addition, plans for Autoroute 550 would have seen an additional bridge further upstream. Since its opening, there haven't been any major changes to the bridge's structure despite the rapid traffic growth. A large piece of concrete fell into the Gatineau River leaving a hole in the eastbound lane and concerns about the structure of the bridge. The trailer of an automobile was also caught in the hole. Workers had patch the hole a few hours after the incident.

It was his act of excommunicating the Patriarch of Constantinople Michael I Cerularius in 1054 which is generally regarded as the precipitating event of the so-called Great Schism between the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Churches. Monastic life When Humbert was 15 years old, he was given by his parents to the Abbey of Moyenmoutier in Lorraine, as an oblate, intended for monastic life, in a practice in keeping with the Rule of St. Benedict.James R. Ginther, \\"Humbert of Silva Candida\\", The Westminster Handbook to Medieval Theology, (Westminster John Knox Press, 2009), 89-91. He entered the Order when he came of age, and was later elected as abbot of the monastery. He became friends with Bruno, the Bishop of Toul, who was later to be elected as Pope Leo IX in 1048 and who brought the monk to Rome to assist him after his election. Archbishop Pope Leo appointed Humbert the Archbishop of Sicily in 1050. The Norman rulers of the island, however, prevented his landing there. In place of that post, he was named Cardinal- bishop of Silva Candida the following year. It has been suggested that he was the first Frenchman to be named cardinal. Papal legate Under Leo, Humbert became the principal papal secretary and on a trip through Apulia in 1053, he received from John, Bishop of Trani, a letter written by Leo, Archbishop of Ochrid, criticising Western rites and practice.Brett Edward Whalen, Dominion of God: Christendom and Apocalypse in the Middle Ages, (Harvard University Press, 2009), 24. He translated the Greek letter into Latin and gave it to the pope, who ordered a response drawn up. This exchange led to Humbert being sent at the head of a legatine mission, along with Frederick of Lorraine (later Pope Stephen IX) and Peter, Archbishop of Amalfi, to Constantinople to confront Patriarch Michael Cerularius. Humbert was cordially welcomed by the Emperor Constantine IX, but spurned by the patriarch. Eventually, on 16 July 1054, during the celebration of the Divine Liturgy Humbert laid a papal bull of excommunication of the patriarch on the high altar of the Cathedral of Hagia Sophia, unaware that Pope Leo had died a few weeks earlier in April, which some historians have suggested meant the excommunication was invalid. This event crystallized in an official way the gradual estrangement of Eastern and Western Christianity which had taken place over the centuries, and is traditionally used to date the beginning of the Great Schism. Later life In his later years, Humbert was made librarian of the Roman Curia by Pope Stephen IX, his former legatine companion, and he penned the reform treatise Libri tres adversus Simoniacos ('Three Books Against the Simoniacs') (1057), criticising those who purchased or sold ecclesiastical office (simony), including kings for whom this had hitherto been normal practice. Humbert's argument that simoniac ordinations and sacraments were invalid was countered by Peter Damian. Humbert is also credited as the brains behind the electoral decree of 1059, which stated that popes would henceforth be elected by the College of Cardinals. He travelled frequently throughout Italy during the later years of his life, partly due to the election of the Antipope Benedict X in 1058. He attended the Lateran Synod of April 1059, however. Humbert died in Rome on 5 May 1061 and was buried in the Lateran Basilica. Notes References Sources * Norwich, John Julius (1967). The Normans in the South 1016‚Äì1130.

In 2002, the company relaunched as Jewelry Television and has since focused on selling gemstones, jewelry and jewelry-making kits. In 2006, Jewelry Television bought competitor Shop at Home and its assets from Scripps.. On June 21, 2006, Jewelry Television replaced Shop at Home on Shop at Home- affiliated stations owned by Scripps. In 2008 and 2009, Jewelry Television experienced multiple rounds of layoffs, due to the \\"great recession\\" and increasing prices of gold and silver. Jewelry Television has approximately 1,400 employees, as of May 2019. Overview Jewelry Television airs 24 hours a day, although programming hours vary between each region, based on the local TV provider. In October 2008 the network began broadcasting in high definition. The network also streams online through its website, like most home shopping networks. In April 2012, Jewelry Television launched the Titanic Jewelry Collection. Created in partnership with Titanic Museum Attractions, this proprietary collection offers pieces in the Art Nouveau and Edwardian styles typical of that era. Lawsuits On March 26, 2008, Jewelry Television filed suit in the U.S. District Court in Tennessee against Lloyd's of London, as a result of a criminal scheme that took place in 2006 and 2007. A person had used a bank account of the Office of the Comptroller of the City of New York to buy more than $3.5 million in jewelry. On May 23, 2008, a $5 million class action lawsuit was filed in California against Jewelry Television. The suit alleged that since 2003 the shopping network has sold a gemstone called andesine-labradorite without disclosing its treatment, while promising buyers that this stone was rare and untreated. On June 2, 2008, Jewelry Television said andesine-labradorite has been sold in the gem trade since 2002 as natural and untreated material. \\"Lab reports from major laboratories have consistently confirmed these gemstones as natural and untreated. Jewelry Television, like other major retailers, relied upon the lab reports and general industry information\\". On May 19, 2009, an age discrimination lawsuit was filed against Jewelry Television alleging an employee had been terminated as part of a company-wide reduction in workforce the previous May.

It was a small, long reptile, and the earliest known reptile with two temporal fenestrae (holes at the rear part of the skull). This means that it was at the base of Diapsida, the largest and most successful radiation of reptiles that would eventually include all modern reptile groups, as well as dinosaurs (which survive to the modern day as birds) and other famous extinct reptiles such as plesiosaurs, ichthyosaurs, and pterosaurs. However, Petrolacosaurus itself was part of Araeoscelida, a short-lived early branch of the diapsid family tree which went extinct in the mid-Permian.  Discovery  The first Petrolacosaurus fossil was found in 1932 in Garnett, Kansas by a field expedition from the University of Kansas Natural History Museum.Reisz, R. (1977). Petrolacosaurus, the Oldest Known Diapsid Reptile. Science, 196(4294), 1091-1093. Retrieved from http://www.jstor.org/stable/1744432. The party consisted of Henry H. Lane, Claude Hibbard, David Dunkle, Wallace Lane, Louis Coghill, and Curtis Hesse. Unfortunately, no field notes or documentation of their discovery are available. Petrolacosaurus fossils were found preserved within a layer of laminated shale that was also plant bearing. The strata that the remains were found in was of Upper Pennsylvanian age (approximately 323-298 ma). The fossil itself is estimated to be approximately 302 million years old.Falcon-Lang, H.J., Benton, M.J. & Stimson, M. (2007): Ecology of early reptiles inferred from Lower Pennsylvanian trackways. Journal of the Geological Society, London, 164; no. 6; pp 1113-1118.  Description  = Skull = Skull diagram Specimens reveal that Petrolacosaurus had a slightly elongated skull with two temporal fenestrae. The upper temporal fenestra is located posteriorly to an enlarged orbit. This is a distinctly diapsid character. The largest teeth in the jaw were at the front of the snout, erupting from the premaxilla bone. There were also a few larger-than average teeth further back on the maxilla, which were probably homologous with caniform teeth retained from the common ancestor between true sauropsid reptiles and synapsids (mammal ancestors). On the dentary, there are marginal teeth, displaying a primitive type of shallow implantation. The palatal arrangement bears close resemblance to Youngoides.Gardner, N. M., Holliday, C. M., & O‚ÄôKeefe, F. R. (2010). The braincase of Youngina capensis (Reptilia, Diapsida): new insights from high- resolution CT scanning of the holotype. = Axial skeleton = There are seven elongated cervical vertebrae, 2 sacrals, and 60 caudal vertebrae. The number and placement of the vertebrae show that Petrolacosaurus was a rather long- necked reptile with a shorter torso. The number and spool-like shape of the vertebrae, in addition to the poses that the reptiles died in, show that they were also very flexible creatures. The vertebral centra were amphicoelous (concave from the front and behind) and had large ventrolateral depressions. A similar depression can be seen on the massive neural arches, running from the prezygapophyses to the postzygapophysis. These depressions allowed the vertebral column to be lighter while still retaining a sturdy build. = Pectoral girdle = The pectoral girdle in Petrolacosaurus is light in comparison to the massive girdles found in taxa such as pelycosaurs. Petrolacosaurus specimens had a clavicle with an expanded ventral blade, yet shorter than that of Captorhinus or pelycosaurs. Also, there is a large cleithrum with a broad, rounded end. = Limbs = The limbs of Petrolacosaurus were long and slender in comparison to other primitive diapsids such as Araeoscelis. The radius and ulna in Petrolacosaurus are of relatively equal length. Unlike these two bones, the fibula is significantly shorter than the tibia, because the tibia has distal articulation with the astragalus. This length difference is further pronounced because the astragalus has a long-neck and buttressed, oblique platform providing an inflexible, concave articulation with the tibia. This articulation creates a virtually immobile joint between the two. Petrolacosaurus has a phalangeal formula for the manus of 2-3-4-5-3. For the pes, the formula is 2-3-4-5-4. The digits increase in length from digit I-digit V. Metatarsal IV is 3.5 times as long as metatarsal I. Many lines of post-Paleozoic reptiles have a reduction in digit IV in the manus and pes, indicating that Petrolacosaurus is more primitive than those reptiles.  Classification  Petrolacosaurus is a member of the basal diapsid order Araeoscelidia, along with the aquatic, late Pennsylvanian Spinoaequalis. The specific taxonomic placement of Petrolacosaurus is a highly debated topic. Because of the unusual osteological characters and how old the reptile is, scientists go back and forth between what position makes the most sense. Some paleontologists are skeptical of Petrolacosaurus' current placement because of large lapses in the fossil record, specifically between the earliest known neodiapsid fossils (appearing in the Lower PermianEvans, S. E. (1980). The skull of a new eosuchian reptile from the Lower Jurassic of South Wales. Zoological journal of the Linnean Society, 70(3), 203-264.) and their proliferation in the Late Permian.Ezcurra, M. D., Scheyer, T. M., & Butler, R. J. (2014). The origin and early evolution of Sauria: reassessing the Permian saurian fossil record and the timing of the crocodile-lizard divergence. PLoS One, 9(2), e89165. Current phylogenetic placement indicates that Petrolacosaurus is derived from a sister to Spinoaequalis, a second species of early diapsid. In contrast to Spinoaequalis, Petrolacosaurus exhibits many distinct cranial and post-cranial features, characteristic of the most primitive diapsids. The fact that Petrolacosaurus has features that are distinctly similar to other romeriidans and others which were very primitive, leads scientists to believe that the species is old enough to be an ancestor of neodiapsids. Because Petrolacosaurus does not have more developed features that the neodiapsids have, it has been placed in a group separate from Neodiapsida.  Phylogeny  Phylogenetic relationships based on De Braga & Reisz (1995) and Falconnet & Steyer (2007).  Paleobiology  = Diet = Petrolacosaurus teeth were of moderate length, slightly recurved, and possessed no lateral compression. Located on the premaxilla of the upper jaw are two teeth, reminiscent of fangs. On the dentary were around 25 smaller teeth, all of different lengths. Placement in the jaw reveals that the teeth on the upper and lower jaw do not interlock but rather meet along a medial plane. The haphazard tooth lengths is consistent with a primitive method of regular tooth replacement.Romer, A. S. (1949) The vertebrate body: W . B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, pp. i-viii, 1-643, figs. 1-363. The teeth located on the transverse flange of the pterygoid were significantly larger than the others, indicating that these teeth were specialized for grabbing smaller, hard shelled insects. The jaws of Petrolacosaurus were long and slender. Based on the skeletal muscle attachment points and the shortened temporal region, adductor muscles would have had limited amounts of leverage, resulting in a quick but weak bite. This is further support for the hypothesis that Petrolacosaurus was insectivorous. = Environment = The mud that the reptile was fossilized in is known to create well preserved insect and plant prints, allowing extrapolation about the surrounding environment. Because of fossil evidence of winged insects, the fruits of conifers, and other pteridosperms, Petrolacosaurus is thought to be a completely terrestrial reptile that lived in a conifer-fern forest.Peabody, F. (1952). Petrolacosaurus kansensis , a Pennsylvanian reptile from Kansas. University of Kansas Paleontological Contributions, Paper, 10(1), 1-41. The front limb is 135mm and the back limb is 165mm, giving the reptile a length ratio of almost 1x as long as the dorsal-sacral region. Petrolacosaurus also has a zeugopodium in both its front and hind limbs that is longer than the stylopodium. In aquatic reptile species, a shorter zeugopodium and longer stylopodium are characteristic in fins.Romer, A. S., & Price, L. W. (1940). Review of the Pelycosauria. Geological Society of America Special Papers, 28, 1-534. Both this length relationship and a wide sacral rib in Petrolacosaurus are indicative of a sprawled, quadrupedal posture.Romer, A. S. (1967). The Postcranial Skeleton of the Giant Permian Pelycosaur Cotylorhynchus romeri. Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, 135(1), 1-30. The elongation of limbs were also adaptations for faster locomotion. The terrestrial nature and coniferous habitat of Petrolacosaurus bring into question whether or not this genus could climb trees. In 1942, Robert Mertens published an analysis of reptiles that had the morphological traits that conferred with the ability to climb. Among other traits, the main synapomorphies are: # Long digits # Strongly decurved digits on the front and hind limbs.Mertens, R. (1950). Notes on some Indo-Australian monitors (Sauria, Varanidae). American Museum Novitates; no. 1456. The distal tips of the phalanges of Petrolacosaurus has very large and solidly developed lateral tuberosities. These processes on these bones served as attachments for ligaments. On the most distal phalanges, Petrolacosaurus had moderately decurved areas where moderate claws would have attached. The elongated digits and moderate decurved points with claws point to Petrolacosaurus being a moderate climber, perhaps only when being cornered by a predator.

Background In 1993, Bert Stone married Donna Stone and they lived together in the Okanagan Valley. He had previously been married two other times and had teenage children from his second marriage. Their relationship was a difficult one, where he was charged with physical abuse after previously trying to run Donna over in a parking lot in Winfield, BC. In 1994 he made arrangements to make a business trip to Vancouver and visit his son without telling his wife. When she found out what he planned to do, she insisted on going with him. According to Bert Stone, the visit to his son was cut short when Donna threatened to lean on the car horn until the police arrived. He made a comment about getting a divorce, which greatly upset her. Bert drove into an abandoned lot and stopped the car. She began to yell and scream, and belittle him. He testified that: :she just continued on and she just said that she couldn't stand to listen to me whistle, that every time I touched her, she felt sick, that I was a lousy fuck and that I had a little penis and that she's never going to fuck me again, and I'm just sitting there with my head down; and by this time, she's kneeling on the seat and she's yelling this in my face. At this point Bert claimed that her voice began to fade away and a \\"whooshing\\" sensation came over him. The next thing he remembers is looking down at her body slumped over the seat and a knife in his hand. He had stabbed her 47 times. He hid her body in his truck's tool chest, left a note for Donna's daughter, and took off to Mexico. After a few weeks in Mexico he decided to return to Canada and turn himself in. He was charged with murder. In his defence, Stone pleaded insane automatism, non-insane automatism, lack of intent, and in the alternative, provocation. The judge allowed for a defence of insane automatism. The jury convicted him of manslaughter and sentenced him to four years. The verdict was upheld by the Court of Appeal. The issue on appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was # whether the \\"defence\\" of sane automatism should have been left to the jury; # whether the defence psychiatric report was properly ordered disclosed to the Crown; and # whether the sentencing judge could consider provocation as a mitigating factor for manslaughter where the same provocation had already been considered in reducing the charge to manslaughter; and # whether the sentence was fit and properly reflected the gravity of the offence and the moral culpability of the offender. In a five to four decision, the Court upheld the conviction. Opinion of the Court Justice Bastarache wrote for the majority. He first distinguished between insane and non-insane automatism. The former was codified under section 16 of the Criminal Code and required that the involuntariness of the conduct to be the result of a \\"disease of the mind\\". A successful defence results in a verdict of not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder. The result of the latter is an acquittal. To apply a defence of automatism the defence has an evidentiary burden to show the judge that the accused's actions were involuntary. The judge will then allow the jury to choose which of the two types of automatism is most appropriate. The question is whether the automatism was the result of a mental disorder or not. Bastarache examined the meaning of a mental disorder. He identified two approaches under section 16. First is the \\"internal cause\\" theory in which the judge compares \\"the accused's automatistic reaction to the way one would expect a normal person to react in order to determine whether the condition the accused claims to have suffered from is a disease of the mind.\\" This takes into account the triggering event, and whether a normal person might have entered into an automatistic state. For example, an extremely shocking event would reasonably turn someone automatistic. The second approach is the \\"continuing danger\\" theory in which a condition that is likely to present a continuing danger to the public would constitute a mental disorder. These two theories, argued Bastarache, are not meant to be mutually exclusive and should both be considered in the application of the defence (Bastarache also mentioned the possibility of considering other policy concerns when \\"consideration of the internal cause and continuing danger factors alone [do] not permit a conclusive answer to the disease of the mind question\\" (at para 218). On the facts, the trial judge had found that only the mental disorder automatism defence applied; the triggering effect for Stone was not something that would reasonably be expected from a normal person. Consequently, his defence should fail.

The Blauer Hof (German for: blue court) or Neues Schloss (German for: new castle) was built around 1745 during the reign of empress Maria Theresa and has a Rococo interior. The church of Laxenburg, which was the first building north of the Alps containing swung facade components (characteristics of the high baroque), was built between 1693 and 1703 by Carlo Antonio Carlone and continued between 1703 and 1724 by Matthias Steinl. After 1780, the castle garden was rearranged as an English landscape garden. It contains several artificial ponds, and, on an island, the Franzensburg castle, named after emperor Franz I, can be found. Franzensburg In 1919, the city of Vienna took over the war-damaged castle and became the property owner of the park area of Laxenburg. After the Anschluss of Austria in 1938, the municipality of Laxenburg became part of the city Vienna. In 1954, the place became independent again and was returned to Lower Austria. In 1972, Schloss Laxenburg became the home to the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, (IIASA), and brought together the best scientists from either side of the iron curtain to study global problems. After the Cold War, the Institute broadened its mandate from the East and West to a truly global focus and, today, it brings together researchers from all over the world to provide science-based insights into critical policy issues in international and national debates on global change. Several members of the imperial family were born at Laxenburg: * Archduchess Gisela of Austria, (15 July 1856 in Laxenburg, 27 July 1932 in Munich), Archduchess of Austria- Hungary, daughter of Franz Joseph I of Austria and Elisabeth of Bavaria. * Crown Prince Rudolf (21 August 1858 in Laxenburg, 30 January 1889 in Mayerling) - son of Franz Joseph I and Elisabeth. * Archduchess Elisabeth Marie of Austria (2 September 1883 in Laxenburg, 16 March 1963 in Vienna), daughter of Crown Prince Rudolf. Archduke Maximilian married at Laxenburg in 1917.

Roubo was born and died in Paris, and was the son and grandson of master cabinetmakers. Roubo wrote several highly influential books on woodworking, an achievement which was especially notable given his relatively poor background and self- taught methods. His career peaked in 1774 when he published his masterwork treatise on woodworking, titled L'Art du Menuisier. This long-standing work covered practically all methods and trades associated with woodworking. Another of Roubo's legacies still used today is a design for a workbench, which has proven to be popular amongst modern woodworkers. A street in Paris, rue Roubo, was named after Roubo in 1850. It is located in the 11th Arrondissement, an area inhabited by furniture manufacturers. Personal life and career Andr√© Jacob Roubo was born in Paris in 1739, the son and grandson of fellow woodworkers. His father was a joiner, and Andr√© became his apprentice in 1750 at the age of 11. Despite having a relatively poor upbringing, Andr√© was literate and taught himself various topics including mathematics and design. His dedication for learning attracted the attention of several professionals, including the architect Jean-Fran√ßois Blondel. Roubo became a pupil of Blondel who waived his tuition fees, and spent five years studying whilst also working for his father during the day. He received the title of Master in 1770 upon publication of the first part of L'Art du Menuisier. He designed and supervised the construction of the great domes of the halls Wheat and Cloth, and a monumental staircase to the hotel of the Marquis de Marbeuf. In 1768, at the age of 29, Roubo started working on his treatise more intensively, having done practical woodwork for 18 years. This treatise was published in four volumes between 1769 and 1775. In 1777, he published the first part of a treatise of theater construction and theatrical machinery. The footnotes of these books show that Roubo had an interest in the social status of artisans. In 1789 most of his noble customers had left France; Roubo was nearly bankrupt and was forced to join the National Guard in 1790. Here he achieved the rank of Lieutenant before dying in 1791. He left a widow and four children who lived on his pension in Rue Saint-Jacques, Paris. Roubo died in Paris in 1791.Death certificate of Andr√© Jacob Roubo A biography of Roubo was written in 1836 by the architect and carpenter Louis-Auguste Boileau in the series Portraits et histoire des hommes utiles (Portraits and History of Useful Men) published by Franklin Montyon and Company. Works Elevation view of a garden pavilion and latticed gallery, from plate 365 of L'Art de Treillageur ou menuiserie des jardins (1775) Roubo's comprehensive four-part treatise L‚ÄôArt du Menuisier (The Art of the Carpenter) was published between 1769 and 1775 by the Acad√©mie des Sciences, with the supplementary work L'Art du layetier being published in 1782. L‚ÄôArt du Menuisier was reprinted in its original format in by L√©once Laget in 1977 and again in 1982. In 2002, the French publisher Biblioth√®que de l‚ÄôImage published an edition at a more affordable price, which also contains L'Art du layetier. L‚ÄôArt du Menuisier is divided into four volumes: * Premi√®re partie (building joinery part I)this part covers basic geometry, types of wood, profiles, assemblages, tools, mobile joinery, shutters and wickets, crosses, and doors. * Seconde partie (building joinery part II)this part covers flooring (including parquetry), panelling, interior decoration, liturgical furniture, installation and assembly of joinery, arches and curves, and stairs. * Troisi√®me partie (specialty woodwork)the third part consist of three discrete sections: coach construction, furniture, and cabinetmaking. * Quatrieme partie (garden woodwork)this part covers the fundamentals of outdoor woodwork and deals with trellis, pilasters & columns, vases & flowerpots. The original four-volume work consisted of 1066 pages in total and many hundreds of plates which were engraved by Roubo himself. Sometimes colloquially referred to as \\"The Roubo\\", it is considered even today as the best guide for traditional joinery. It develops and discusses in detail the technical knowledge of carpentry that was under Louis XV in its heyday. Roubo also had an interest in theatrical design, and published a treatise on the construction of theatres and theatrical mechanics in 1777, titled Trait√© de la construction des th√©√¢tres et des machines th√©√¢trales. This was reprinted by Slatkine Reprints in 1984 under the false name of Jacques-Andr√© (). However, Roubo only published the first part (the history and architecture of theaters), even though the second part (on theatrical machines) was declared ready to print in 1777. The original work contains 66 pages of text and 10 engravings.

He represented portions of Jefferson, Shelby, Bibb and Chilton counties.  Biography  Erwin was the son of Henry Eugene \\"Red\\" Erwin Sr., a U.S. Army Air Forces sergeant who earned the Medal of Honor in World War II. He was born in Birmingham, Alabama, and graduated from Ensley High School in 1967, before going on to earn degrees at Troy State University (1972), Southeastern Bible College (1974), and the Dallas Seminary (1981). Erwin broke into broadcasting in the 1970s and served radio and TV stations in Dallas, Texas, and Birmingham, Alabama, for almost 35 years. He was elected to the Alabama Senate in 2002 and re-elected in 2006. He was a member of the Southern Baptist Church. Erwin and his wife, Sheila, have two sons, Andrew and Jon Erwin. Before their sons could drive a car, they wanted to make movies. Erwin and wife, Sheila, bought those video cameras and Erwin Brothers Motion Pictures began. Erwin says his two sons, four years apart in age, were only in junior high school. As teenagers, Jon and Andy Erwin honed their skills by shooting short films for a youth camp in New York and operating video cameras for ESPN. In 2015, the brothers made the film \\"Woodlawn\\". The film begins with Erwin, a composite character based on the filmmakers' father, speaking at Woodlawn High School on a day of high racial tension. Birmingham was called \\"Bombingham\\" due to the 50 dynamite explosions that occurred in the city between 1947 and 1965. \\"Hank\\", an outsider, asks to speak to the Woodlawn football team and real change begins. Hank, who has been radically affected by the message of hope and love he experienced at a Billy Graham Christian revival meeting in Dallas, Texas, tells the players a \\"better way\\" is possible through following Jesus. More than 40 players, nearly the entire team, black and white, give their lives over to Jesus Christ and the spiritual change has a profound effect on the coach, the school and the community. \\"Woodlawn\\" is the true story of how faith in God saved a city torn apart by racism. 2010 Lt.

Boulevard Saint-Joseph is a commercial boulevard in the former city of Hull, Quebec (now Gatineau). It runs from Boulevard Alexandre-Tache to the boundaries of the city of Gatineau and the suburban town of Chelsea. Southern section Also known as Route 105 that travels all the way to Route 117 in Grand-Remous, north of Maniwaki, this road travels through a commercial district. Numerous types of businesses are located all along the road. Most of them are small independent companies by local entrepreneurs for the Association professionnelle des gens d'affaires de Hull. However, in the recent years the affluence dropped due to the development of the Plateau de la Capitale commercial district in which big-box stores were built in conjunction of the booming residential development in the area which drove away many customers from the Saint-Joseph commercial strip. At its southern end is the Salaberry Armoury in which has a militia from the Hull regiment and a park called \\"Parc des Chars de Combat\\". The Universit√© du Qu√©bec en Outaouais's two campuses are also just off the road. Two roundabouts were built in 2004 and 2005, one at rue Montcalm and the other at boulevard des Allumetti√®res (formerly boulevard Saint-Laurent) in which it serves as a direct link to the Aylmer sector and Le Plateau when Route 148 was made into a freeway in the fall of 2007. Central section There are also two shopping centres near Boulevard Saint-Raymond. At first there is Les Galeries de Hull, built in 1972 and owned by Ivanhoe Cambridge, which includes 75 stores. The Village Place Cartier is another mall. In the vicinity of these malls lies a Maxi superstore and a strip mall called Place Fleur de Lys. The hotel \\"auberge de la gare\\" is also located in the vicinity. A 21-story building called Place Vincent Massey is located in the same area as well. There are also some residential sections including three apartment towers called Le Blackburn, Place Versailles and Le 700 St- Joseph which all contains 16 floors. The intersection of Boulevard Saint- Joseph and Boulevard Saint-Raymond is one of the most congested intersections in Gatineau during afternoon peak hours and also during weekends, since it is loaded with heavy traffic going to Aylmer via Boulevard Saint-Raymond and to Ottawa and Gatineau via Autoroute 5 and drivers heading to Highway 5 often block the intersection, which results lengthy delays on Saint-Joseph heading north. The traffic jam is also caused by the configuration of the junction of southbound Highway 5 with eastbound Autoroute 50 where there is only one lane of traffic to access the 50 and traffic must change lanes immediately. Northern section North of the junction of Autoroute 5, Boulevard Saint- Joseph is also known as Boulevard de l'Automobile because of numerous car dealerships located through this stretch all the way towards Chelsea. Retailers from Honda, Toyota, Suzuki, Subaru, Nissan, Hyundai and Nissan are also on the road as well as an auction dealership, Mega Auto. Every spring, a portion of this road is closed to traffic on a particular Sunday for a sale involving most of the retailers. In that same area lies the southern terminus of Hull-Chelsea-Wakefield steam train line. Transportation Many of the city's Soci√©t√© de transport de l'Outaouais's routes travels on that stretch of road particularly near the shopping district near Saint-Raymond and Montclair as well as near a park and ride facility at corner with Chemin Freeman. The speed limit throughout all this stretch is 50 km/h. When it exits Gatineau it climbs to 70 km/h.

The ruined palace has now been converted into shops Palais Ephrussi, detail Palais Ephrussi, windows Palais Ephrussi is a former Ringstra√üenpalais in Vienna. It was built for the Ephrussi family of financiers by Theophil Freiherr von Hansen, the architect of the Austrian Parliament Building. It is on the Ringstrasse, specifically the Universit√§tsring (formerly Doctor-Karl-Lueger-Ring), opposite the Votivkirche. History Unlike traditional baroque noble palaces in Vienna, the Palais Ephrussi was built in the late 19th century and is therefore considered a Ringstra√üenpalais. It is five storeys high and built in the typical neo- renaissance style popular at the time of its construction. The history of the building and the family is described in great detail in \\"The Hare with Amber Eyes\\" by Edmund de Waal, whose grandmother - Elisabeth de Waal n√©e Ephrussi, born 1899 - spent her childhood and youth there; De Waal combined first-hand information from her with extensive research in available documents. =World War II= As noted by de Waal, shortly following Austria's annexation to Nazi Germany in the 1938 Anchluss, the building's then owner Viktor Ephrussi and his son Rudolf were arrested by the Gestapo and threatened with being sent to the Dachau Concentration Camp. Their release was conditioned upon the 78-year- old Viktor Ephrussi signing away his ownership of the building and its entire contents, including many valuable works of art and the library in which were many rare incunabula. Members of the family were restricted to two rooms at the back of their former home, and were allowed to leave Austria only after giving up the rest of their property, including the family's Ephrussi Bank. The house was then taken over by the new Nazi administration of Austria, and was used as such until 1945. For part of that time, it was used by the Nazi Party ideologue Alfred Rosenberg when he was in charge of introducing the Nazi racist doctrines in newly annexed Austria. The palace was heavily damaged during World War II. One whole wing was destroyed. Following the defeat of the Nazis, the palace was in the American sector of Vienna and its surviving part used by the American Headquarters to house its Legal Council Property Control. Elisabeth de Waal, who visited Vienna in December 1945 after relocating to England, found paintings of her mother and grandmother still hanging on a wall, having evidently been kept for decoration by the Nazis. She also met a former servant named Anna who had saved and loyally kept the family's collection of valuable Japanese netsuke. In 1950, after considerable litigation, surviving members of the Ephrussi family scattered throughout the world regained legal title to the building (as well as to some of the many books and works of art taken from it). But having no wish to go back to live in Vienna, which held painful and traumatic memories for them, the Ephrussis sold the building for the equivalent of $50,000 - a price lower than its true value, due to its damaged condition and to the still depressed economic situation in Vienna at the time. =Present day= From 1969 to 2009 the renovated palace served as the headquarters of Casinos Austria, whose management facilitated Edmund de Waal's research into the building's history. The destroyed wing has been replaced with a modern building, which housed the OPEC for a while.

It is up to five storeys high and built in the neo- renaissance style typical of its time. Following the (\\"Founders' Crash\\", the 9 May 1873 crash of the Vienna Stock Exchange), Epstein had to sell the palais to the Imperial Continental Gas Association, an English gas company, to avoid bankruptcy. In 1902 it was acquired by the State and used as domicile of the Administrative Court. After conversions, it became home to the Vienna School Authority in 1922. Following the Anschluss, it housed offices of the 's building authorities. From 1945 to 1955 (the Allied occupation of Austria), the palais was domicile of the Soviet headquarters. After that, it briefly served as a branch of the Academy of Music and Performing Arts and then again for the School Authority until 2002.

He was later president of the Marylebone Cricket Club from 1996 to 1998, during which time women were first permitted to join. Early life Ingleby-Mackenzie was born in Dartmouth, Devon. His father was a surgeon officer in the Royal Navy who ended his career as Vice- Admiral Sir Alexander Ingleby-Mackenzie. He was educated at Ludgrove and Eton, where he became keeper of fives, squash, rackets, and the Field Game. He also played in the Wall Game. He also played soccer, tennis, and cricket, playing three times in the annual cricket match against Harrow and for the public schools against the Combined Services. He was elected as President of Pop He played his first match for Hampshire in 1951, having been spotted at Eton by Desmond Eagar, although he was bowled for a duck by Alan Oakman in his debut innings. First-class cricket career He did National Service with the Royal Navy, during which time he played cricket for Combined Services and, on leave in the summer of 1952, for Hampshire. He played a full season for Hampshire in 1954, then declined a place at Trinity College, Oxford to work for Slazenger, who gave him copious leave to pursue a parallel cricket career with Hampshire. He toured the West Indies with a team led by E. W. Swanton in early 1956, and then headed the Hampshire batting averages in the 1956 County Championship season. After sharing the county captaincy with Desmond Eagar in 1957, he became sole captain in 1958, in which year he was also named as the Cricket Writer's Club Young Cricketer of the Year. His \\"day time\\" job also changed, accepting an invitation from Bryan Valentine of Kent to join the insurance brokers Holmwoods, Back and Manson. Nevertheless, he was often absent pursuing his sport in a swashbuckling fashion. Hampshire's victory in the 1961 County Championship was, in part, due to Ingleby-Mackenzie's bold captaincy: 10 of their 19 victories that season are attributable to bold declarations on the third (and last) day, in a summer when the opposing team could not be made to follow-on. The team included West Indian opening batsman Roy Marshall, veteran swing and seam bowler Derek Shackleton, and fast bowler David White. In his first-class career, he scored 12,421 first-class runs, including 11 hundreds, at a relatively low average of 24.35, this figure depressed at least in part because of his attacking instincts: in only one season (1956) when he played more than a handful of games did he average above 30. However, he passed 1,000 runs in a season five times. He was an occasional right-arm off-break bowler (he never took a wicket) and an equally occasional wicket-keeper, who gained his only first-class stumping (that of Gerry Alexander) for the Duke of Norfolk's XI against Jamaica in the 1956‚Äì1957 West Indian cricket season, deputising for Leo Harrison. He wrote his autobiography, Many a Slip, in 1962. John Arlott said the book \\"reflects a considerable capacity for the enjoyment of most pleasures ... [and] presents a picture of a young man engagingly carefree in a way that seems to belong to a different age from ours\\".John Arlott, \\"Cricket Books, 1962\\", Wisden 1963, pp. 1110‚Äì11. After cricket He retired from first-class cricket in 1965, and later became chairman of Holmwoods. He led the firm through a 33 million pound management buyout from Brown Shipley in 1992 and oversaw the sale of the business to HSBC in 1997, becoming Deputy Chairman of HSBC Insurance Services. He became cricket manager for Sir Paul Getty at his ground at Wormsley. He was reputedly one of the last to see Lord Lucan. He was a member of the Clermont Club and White's Club. He was also a life member of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club and he captained Sunningdale Golf Club in 2000. Ingleby-Mackenzie served as president of Marylebone Cricket Club from 1996 to 1998. He was in the post when the new media centre at Lord's was approved and building work began. He led a campaign in favour of women's membership, ultimately convincing members to vote in favour of the change in September 1998, after forcing two votes on the matter within seven months. He pronounced himself \\"absolutely delighted\\" at the decision.MCC's vote hails end of elitism (29 September 1998) and he is famously quoted as saying \\"Women are a very fine species.\\"MCC votes to allow women members He became president of Hampshire in 2002. Personal life He married Susan Marion Clifford-Turner in 1975; they had a daughter. He was awarded the OBE in the summer of 2005, just a few months before his death at the age of 72, following surgery for a brain tumour. The hearse carrying his coffin passed beneath and adjacent to the stands as it circled Lord's Cricket Ground before making its way to Kensal Rise Crematorium.

Research on fungal mating has focused on several model species with different behaviour. Not all fungi reproduce sexually and many that do are isogamous; thus, the terms \\"male\\" and \\"female\\" do not apply to many members of the fungal kingdom. Homothallic species are able to mate with themselves, while in heterothallic species only isolates of opposite mating types can mate. Mating between isogamous fungi may consist only of a transfer of nuclei from one cell to another. Vegetative incompatibility within species often prevent a fungal isolate from mating with another isolate. Isolates of the same incompatibility group do not mate or mating does not lead to successful offspring. High variation has been reported including same chemotype mating, sporophyte to gametophyte mating and biparental transfer of mitochondria. File:zygo2.pngFungi within Zygomycota form progametangia with suspensors during mating File:sacfungi.pngFungi within Ascomycota form ascogonium and antheridium with trichogyne bridge File:clubfungi2.pngTypical mating fusion of two compatible monokaryons in Basidiomycota Mating in Zygomycota A zygomycete hypha grows towards a compatible mate and they both form a bridge, called a progametangia, by joining at the hyphal tips via plasmogamy. A pair of septa forms around the merged tips, enclosing nuclei from both isolates. A second pair of septa forms two adjacent cells, one on each side. These adjacent cells, called suspensors provide structural support. The central cell is destined to become a spore. The nuclei join in a process called karyogamy to form a zygote. Mating in Ascomycota As it approaches a mate, a haploid sac fungus develops one of two complementary organs, a \\"female\\" ascogonium or a \\"male\\" antheridium. These organs resemble gametangia except that they contain only nuclei. A bridge, the trichogyne forms, that provides a passage for nuclei to travel from the antheridium to the ascogonium. A dikaryote grows from the ascogonium, and karyogamy occurs in the fruiting body. =Neurospora crassa= Neurospora crassa life cycle. The haploid mycelium reproduces asexually by two processes: (1) simple proliferation of existing mycelium, and (2) formation of conidia (macro- and micro-) which can be dispersed and then germinate to produce new mycelium. In the sexual cycle, mating can only occur between individual strains of different mating type, A and a. Fertilization occurs by the passage of nuclei of conidia or mycelium of one mating type into the protoperithecia of the opposite mating type through the trichogyne. Fusion of the nuclei of opposite mating types occurs within the protoperithecium to form a zygote (2N) nucleus. Neurospora crassa is a type of red bread mold of the phylum Ascomycota. N. crassa is used as a model organism because it is easy to grow and has a haploid life cycle: this makes genetic analysis simple, since recessive traits will show up in the offspring. Analysis of genetic recombination is facilitated by the ordered arrangement of the products of meiosis within a sac-like structure called an ascus (pl. asci). In its natural environment, N. crassa lives mainly in tropical and sub-tropical regions. It often can be found growing on dead plant matter after fires. Neurospora was used by Edward Tatum and George Wells Beadle in the experiments for which they won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1958. The results of these experiments led directly to the \\"one gene, one enzyme\\" hypothesis that specific genes code for specific proteins. This concept launched molecular biology. Sexual fruiting bodies (perithecia) can only be formed when two cells of different mating type come together (see Figure). Like other Ascomycetes, N. crassa has two mating types that, in this case, are symbolized by A and a. There is no evident morphological difference between the A and a mating type strains. Both can form abundant protoperithecia, the female reproductive structure (see Figure). Protoperithecia are formed most readily in the laboratory when growth occurs on solid (agar) synthetic medium with a relatively low source of nitrogen. Nitrogen starvation appears to be necessary for expression of genes involved in sexual development. The protoperithecium consists of an ascogonium, a coiled multicellular hypha that is enclosed in a knot-like aggregation of hyphae. A branched system of slender hyphae, called the trichogyne, extends from the tip of the ascogonium projecting beyond the sheathing hyphae into the air. The sexual cycle is initiated (i.e. fertilization occurs) when a cell, usually a conidium, of opposite mating type contacts a part of the trichogyne (see Figure). Such contact can be followed by cell fusion leading to one or more nuclei from the fertilizing cell migrating down the trichogyne into the ascogonium. Since both A and a strains have the same sexual structures, neither strain can be regarded as exclusively male or female. However, as a recipient, the protoperithecium of both the A and a strains can be thought of as the female structure, and the fertilizing conidium can be thought of as the male participant. The subsequent steps following fusion of A and a haploid cells have been outlined by Fincham and Day.Fincham J RS, Day PR (1963). Fungal Genetics. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford, UK. and Wagner and Mitchell.Wagner RP, Mitchell HK. (1964). Genetics and Metabolism. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York After fusion of the cells, the further fusion of their nuclei is delayed. Instead, a nucleus from the fertilizing cell and a nucleus from the ascogonium become associated and begin to divide synchronously. The products of these nuclear divisions (still in pairs of unlike mating type, i.e. A/a) migrate into numerous ascogenous hyphae, which then begin to grow out of the ascogonium. Each of these ascogenous hyphae bends to form a hook (or crozier) at its tip and the A and a pair of haploid nuclei within the crozier divide synchronously. Next, septa form to divide the crozier into three cells. The central cell in the curve of the hook contains one A and one a nucleus (see Figure). This binuclear cell initiates ascus formation and is called an ‚Äúascus-initial‚Äù cell. Next the two uninucleate cells on either side of the first ascus-forming cell fuse with each other to form a binucleate cell that can grow to form a further crozier that can then form its own ascus-initial cell. This process can then be repeated multiple times. After formation of the ascus-initial cell, the A and a nuclei fuse with each other to form a diploid nucleus (see Figure). This nucleus is the only diploid nucleus in the entire life cycle of N. crassa. The diploid nucleus has 14 chromosomes formed from the two fused haploid nuclei that had 7 chromosomes each. Formation of the diploid nucleus is immediately followed by meiosis. The two sequential divisions of meiosis lead to four haploid nuclei, two of the A mating type and two of the a mating type. One further mitotic division leads to four A and four a nucleus in each ascus. Meiosis is an essential part of the life cycle of all sexually reproducing organisms, and in its main features, meiosis in N. crassa seems typical of meiosis generally. As the above events are occurring, the mycelial sheath that had enveloped the ascogonium develops as the wall of the perithecium becomes impregnated with melanin, and blackens. The mature perithecium has a flask-shaped structure. A mature perithecium may contain as many as 300 asci, each derived from identical fusion diploid nuclei. Ordinarily, in nature, when the perithecia mature the ascospores are ejected rather violently into the air. These ascospores are heat resistant and, in the lab, require heating at 60 ¬∞C for 30 minutes to induce germination. For normal strains, the entire sexual cycle takes 10 to 15 days. In a mature ascus containing eight ascospores, pairs of adjacent spores are identical in genetic constitution, since the last division is mitotic, and since the ascospores are contained in the ascus sac that holds them in a definite order determined by the direction of nuclear segregations during meiosis. Since the four primary products are also arranged in sequence, a first division segregation pattern of genetic markers can be distinguished from a second division segregation pattern. =Benefit of mating type in N. crassa= That mating in N. crassa can only occur between strains of different mating type suggests that some degree of outcrossing is favored by natural selection. In haploid multicellular fungi, such as N. crassa, meiosis occurring in the brief diploid stage is one of their most complex processes. The haploid multicellular vegetative stage, although physically much larger than the diploid stage, characteristically has a simple modular construction with little differentiation. In N. crassa, recessive mutations affecting the diploid stage of the life cycle are quite frequent in natural populations. These mutations, when homozygous in the diploid stage, often cause spores to have maturation defects or to produce barren fruiting bodies with few ascospores (sexual spores). The majority of these homozygous mutations cause abnormal meiosis (e.g. disturbed chromosome pairing or disturbed pachytene or diplotene). The number of genes affecting the diploid stage was estimated to be at least 435 (about 4% of the total number of 9,730 genes). Thus, outcrossing, promoted by the necessity for union of opposite mating types, likely provides the benefit of masking recessive mutations that would otherwise be deleterious to sexual spore formation (see Complementation (genetics)). =Saccharomyces cerevisiae= The yeast cell's life cycle: Saccharomyces cerevisiae, brewer's and baker's yeast, is in the phylum Ascomycota. During vegetative growth that ordinarily occurs when nutrients are abundant, S. cerevisiae reproduces by mitosis as either haploid or diploid cells. However, when starved, diploid cells undergo meiosis to form haploid spores. Mating occurs when haploid cells of opposite mating type, MATa and MATŒ±, come into contact. Ruderfer et al. pointed out that such contacts are frequent between closely related yeast cells for two reasons. The first is that cells of opposite mating type are present together in the same ascus, the sac that contains the tetrad of cells directly produced by a single meiosis, and these cells can mate with each other. The second reason is that haploid cells of one mating type, upon cell division, often produce cells of the opposite mating type with which they may mate. Katz Ezov et al. presented evidence that in natural S. cerevisiae populations clonal reproduction and a type of ‚Äúself-fertilization‚Äù (in the form of intratetrad mating) predominate. Ruderfer et al. analyzed the ancestry of natural S. cerevisiae strains and concluded that outcrossing occurs only about once every 50,000 cell divisions. Thus, although S. cerevisiae is heterothallic, it appears that, in nature, mating is most often between closely related yeast cells. The relative rarity in nature of meiotic events that result from outcrossing suggests that the possible long-term benefits of outcrossing (e.g. generation of genetic diversity) are unlikely to be sufficient for generally maintaining sex from one generation to the next. Instead, a short term benefit, such as meiotic recombinational repair of DNA damages caused by stressful conditions such as starvation, may be the key to the maintenance of sex in S. cerevisiae.Birdsell JA, Wills C (2003). The evolutionary origin and maintenance of sexual recombination: A review of contemporary models. Evolutionary Biology Series >> Evolutionary Biology, Vol. 33 pp. 27‚Äì137. MacIntyre, Ross J.; Clegg, Michael, T (Eds.), Springer. Alternatively, recessive deleterious mutations accumulate during the diploid expansion phase, and are purged during selfing: this purging has been termed \\"genome renewal\\" and provides an advantage of sex that does not depend on outcrossing. =Candida albicans= Candida albicans is a diploid fungus that grows both as a yeast and as a filament. C. albicans is the most common fungal pathogen in humans. It causes both debilitating mucosal infections and potentially life-threatening systemic infections. C. albicans has maintained an elaborate, but largely hidden, mating apparatus. Johnson suggested that mating strategies may allow C. albicans to survive in the hostile environment of a mammalian host. In order to mate C. albicans needs to switch from white to opaque cells. The latter are more efficient in mating and referred to as the mating competent cells of C. albicans. Mating in C. albicans is termed a parasexual cycle since meiosis is still not observed in C. albicans. =Mating type= A picture of the mating type mechanism has begun to emerge from studies of particular fungi such as S. cerevisiae. The mating type genes are located in homeobox and encode enzymes for production of pheromones and pheromone receptors. Sexual reproduction thereby depends on pheromones produced from variant alleles of the same gene. Since sexual reproduction takes place in haploid organisms, it cannot proceed until complementary genes are provided by a suitable partner through cell or hyphal fusion. The number of mating types depends on the number of genes and the number of alleles for each. Depending of the species, sexual reproduction takes place through gametes or hyphal fusion. When a receptor on one haploid detects a pheromone from a complementary mating type, it approaches the source through chemotropic growth or chemotactic movement if it is a gamete. Mating in Basidiomycota Some of the species within Basidiomycota have the most complex systems of sexual reproduction known among Fungi. In general for Fungi there are two main types of sexual reproduction: homothallism, when mating occurs within a single individual, or in other words each individual is self-fertile; and heterothallism, when hyphae from a single individual are self-sterile and need to interact with another compatible individual for mating to take place. Additionally, mating compatibility in the Basidiomycota is further categorized into two types of mating systems: tetrapolar and bipolar. =Tetrapolar and bipolar mating system= Heterothallism is the most common mating system in Basidiomycota and in Agaricomycotina (the mushroom-forming Fungi) about 90% of the species are heterothallic. The tetrapolar type of mating system is ruled by two unlinked mating loci termed A and B (in Agaricomycotina) or b and a (in Ustilaginomycotina and Pucciniomycotina), both of which can be multiallelic. The combination of A and B (or b and a) alleles, termed mating type, determine the specificity or sexual identity of the individual harboring them. Only individuals with different specificities are compatible with each other and therefore able to start the mating event. A successful mating interaction begins with nuclear exchange and nuclear migration resulting in the formation of dikaryotic hyphae (containing separate haploid nuclei from both initial parents). Dikaryotic hyphae, under the appropriate environmental conditions will give rise to the fruiting body which contains the basidia ‚Äì specialized cells in which sexual recombination via karyogamy and meiosis occurs. This dikaryotic condition in Basidiomycota is often maintained by a specialized hyphal structure called a clamp connection. The formation of clamp connections is regulated by both mating loci. Examples of tetrapolar organisms are the smuts Ustilago maydis and U. longissima, and the mushrooms Coprinopsis cinerea, Schizophyllum commune, Pleurotus djamor and Laccaria bicolor. It is believed that multi-allelic systems favor outcrossing in Basidiomycota. For example, in the case of U. maydis, which bears more than 25 b but only 2 a specificities, an individual has an approximately 50% chance to encounter a compatible mate in nature. However, species such as C. cinerea, which has more than 240 A and B specificities each, and S. commune, which has more than 339 A specificities and 64 B specificities, approach close to 100% chance of encountering a compatible partner in nature due to the huge number of mating types generated by these systems. In contrast, bipolar mating systems are ruled by a single allelic mating locus, termed either A or b. In Agaricomycotina, bipolar organisms mostly have multiple alleles for their A mating locus; however, in Ustilaginomycotina and Pucciniomycotina, the b mating locus is predominantly diallelic, which reduces the occurrence of outcrossing within these species. Bipolarity likely arose via one of two potential routes: 1) during evolution the B or a locus lost functionality in determining specificity, as has occurred in the mushroom Coprinellus disseminatus; or 2) both mating loci have become physically linked such that they now act as a single locus; this has occurred in the smut plant pathogen U. hordei and in the human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. Virulence success in these two pathogens is highly associated with mating and their mating type locus. Other bipolar species include the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium and the edible mushroom Pholiota nameko. =The A and B or b and a mating loci= In the B or a locus there are linked genes that code for pheromones and pheromone receptors. The pheromones are short polypeptides with conserved residues and the pheromone receptors belong to the G protein-coupled family of receptors located in the cell membrane; they sense different molecules (in this case the pheromones) outside and activate a specific pathway inside of the cell. Pheromone-receptor interaction occurs in a way that the pheromone from one individual interacts with the receptor from the partner and vice versa. The functions of these genes are to regulate reciprocal nuclear exchange, nuclear migration in both mates and ultimately clamp cell fusion. The first mating pheromone-receptor genes characterized were for U. maydis. The A or b mating locus contains genes that code for two types of homeodomain transcription factor proteins, usually tightly linked, that are homologues to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mating proteins MATŒ±2 and MATa1. In Agaricomycotina the two types of homeodomain transcription factors are termed HD1 and HD2; so the HD1 and HD2 proteins from an individual interacts with the HD2 and HD1 proteins from the other partner, respectively, generating heterodimers able to activate the A transcriptional regulated pathway, which involves formation of clamp cells, coordinated nuclear division and septation. =Homothallism= Homothallic species may likely have evolved from heterothallic ancestors (Lin and Heitman 2007). In Basidiomycota homothallism is not very common and in Agaricomycotina it is estimated that only 10% of species have homothallic mating behavior. For example, one subspecies of the ectomycorrhizal Basidiomycete Sistotrema brinkmannii is homothallic, although other subspecies have maintained their ability to outcross. Also, a variety of the edible mushroom Agaricus bisporus, (A. bisporus var. eurotetrasporus) produces haploid self-fertile basidiospores. Additionally, in the human pathogen C. neoformans known to outcross under laboratory conditions, both mating types are not normally distributed in natural populations, with the Œ± mating type much more commonly found (>99%), suggesting homothallism is the most prevalent mode of sexual reproduction in ¬¥C. neoformans in nature. Finally, the fungus causing witches' broom in cacao, Moniliophthora perniciosa, has a primarily homothallic biology despite having A and B mating type-like genes in its genome. Among the 250 known species of aspergilli, about 36% have an identified sexual state Among those Aspergillus species that exhibit a sexual cycle the overwhelming majority in nature are homothallic (self-fertilizing). Selfing in the homothallic fungus Aspergillus nidulans involves activation of the same mating pathways characteristic of sex in outcrossing species, i.e. self-fertilization does not bypass required pathways for outcrossing sex but instead requires activation of these pathways within a single individual. Fusion of haploid nuclei occurs within reproductive structures termed cleistothecia, in which the diploid zygote undergoes meiotic divisions to yield haploid ascospores.

FMD has been found in nearly every arterial bed in the body although the most common arteries affected are the renal and carotid arteries. There are various types of FMD, with multi-focal fibroplasia being the most common. Further, less common, forms of the disease include focal (previously known as intimal) and adventitial fibroplasia. FMD predominantly affects middle-aged women, but has been found in men and people of all ages. Pediatric cases of FMD are vastly different from that of the adult population, and poorly studied. The prevalence of FMD is not known and, although the disease was initially thought to be rare, recent studies have suggested that it may be underdiagnosed. Signs and symptoms The symptoms expressed by FMD patients is largely dependent on the vascular bed(s) affected by the disease. Patients may also be entirely asymptomatic and have FMD discovered incidentally (e.g., when imaging studies are performed for other reasons). In a study from the United States Registry for Fibromuscular Dysplasia, the median age at first symptom was roughly 47 years. =Renal arteries= The main symptoms associated with renal FMD are secondary hypertension and bruits that can be heard with a stethoscope over the abdomen or flanks. Complications such as aneurysms, dissections, or occlusion of the renal artery have been associated with renal artery FMD. =Cerebrovascular regions= The carotid and vertebral arteries are most commonly affected. Middle and distal regions of the internal carotid arteries are frequently involved. Patients with FMD in the carotid arteries typically present around 50 years of age. Symptoms of craniocervical involvement include headaches (mostly migraine), pulsatile tinnitus, dizziness, and neck pain, although patients are often asymptomatic. On physical examination, one may detect neurological symptoms secondary to a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), a bruit over an affected artery, and diminished distal pulses. Complications of cerebrovascular FMD include TIA, ischemic stroke, Horner syndrome, or subarachnoid hemorrhage. =Other sites= Patients with mesenteric, or intestinal FMD, may experience abdominal pain after eating or weight loss. FMD within the extremities may cause claudication or may be detectable by bruits. If the lower limb arteries are affected, the patient may present with cold legs or evidence of distal embolic disease. FMD present in the subclavian artery may cause arm weakness, parenthesis, claudication, and subclavial steal syndrome. =Children= Children with FMD often report various non-specific symptoms or present with hypertension during routine physical examinations. Symptoms are commonly associated with the artery being affected. Symptoms may include headaches, insomnia, fatigue and chest or abdominal pain. FMD affecting the arteries of the head neck are commonly recognized as a cause of childhood strokes. Detection may stem from a bruit being present over the affected vascular bed during a physical assessment. Yet, absence of a bruit does not rule out significant vascular disease. In children, renovascular disease accounts for approximately 10% of all causes of secondary hypertension. Kidney failure is a common presentation in infants and children but is uncommon in adults, although it is occasionally the presenting problem in adults with focal disease. ‚ÄúThe presentation in infants and children younger than 4 years is especially likely to resemble vacuities.‚Äù =Related diseases= The vascular subtype of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (type IV) has been associated with multi- focal FMD. This syndrome should be suspected in patients with multiple aneurysms and/or tears (dissections) in arteries in addition to the typical angiographic findings of FMD. There have been isolated reports of FMD associated with other disorders, including Alport syndrome, pheochromocytoma, Marfan syndrome, Moyamoya disease, and Takayasu's arteritis.Mace, P., \\"FMDSA Fibromuscular Dysplasia Society of America.\\" Welcome to FMDSA. N.p., 2011. Web. 22 July 2013. Cause While the cause of FMD remains unclear, current theory suggest that there may be a genetic predisposition as case reports have identified clusters of the disease and prevalence among twins. In fact, according to the Cleveland Clinic approximately 10% of cases appear to be inherited and often coexists with other genetic abnormalities that affect the blood vessels. Approximately 10% of patients with FMD have an affected family member. A study conducted from the patient registry at Michigan Cardiovascular Outcomes Research and Reporting Program (MCORRP) at the University of Michigan Health System reported a high prevalence of a family history of stroke (53.5%), aneurysm (23.5%), and sudden death (19.8%). Even though FMD is a non- atherosclerotic disease family histories of hypertension and hyperlipidemia were also common among those diagnosed with FMD. It is believed that the cause of FMD is not a single identifier such as genetics but has multiple underlying factors. Theories of hormonal influence, mechanical stress from trauma and stress to the artery walls, and also the effect of loss of oxygen supply to the blood vessel wall caused by fibrous lesions. It has been suggested that environmental factors, such as smoking and estrogen, may play role in addition to genetic factors. Pathophysiology FMD can be found in almost every artery in the human body, but most often affects the carotid, vertebral, renal arteries and even those that supply the intestines, arms, and the legs. Patients may present with FMD in multiple vessels. FMD has been pathologically categorized into three types of classifications: Multi-focal, focal, and adventitial; referring to the particular layer of arterial wall being affected. =Focal= In pediatrics, the most prevalent form of FMD is focal fibroplasia. Focal fibroplasia is described as long, narrow, irregular or smooth focal stenosis and can occur in any arterial bed. Whilst it is the most common type amongst children, it only accounts for approximately 10% of FMD cases overall. It most often presents with ischemic symptoms, and frequently mistaken for Takayasu arteritis. (previously known as intimal) =Multi- focal= The second type, multi-focal fibroplasia, involves thickening of the media and collagen formation. It is typically reported as having the appearance of a ‚Äòstring of beads‚Äô on angiographic review. \\"The 'bead' component is often larger than the normal arterial lumen, and in a subset of patients with FMD, aneurysms are present that may require treatment.\\" The multi-focal subtype of FMD accounts for nearly 80% to 90% of all FMD cases. (previously known as medial) =Adventitial= The third classification is adventitial fibroplasia, in which collagen replaces the fibrous adventitia and extends beyond the artery. This form is considered rare but angiographic appearance may look similar to the focal subtype of FMD, making the distinction difficult. Diagnosis It is the lack of specific symptoms and its potential to appear anywhere that makes FMD a challenge to detect early on. The most accurate diagnosis comes from combining clinical presentation and angiographic imaging. According to the Michigan Outcomes Research and Reporting Program (MCORRP, 2013) the length of time from a patient‚Äôs first signs or symptoms to diagnosis is commonly 5 years. FMD is currently diagnosed through the use of both invasive and non-invasive tests. Non-invasive testing includes duplex ultrasonography, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and computed tomography angiography (CTA). Invasive testing through angiography is the gold standard. However, due to the higher risk of complications this is typically not done early on. Occasionally, FMD is diagnosed asymptomatically after an unrelated x-ray presents the classic ‚Äòstring of beads‚Äô appearance of the arteries, or when a practitioner investigates an unexpected bruit found during an exam. When a diagnosis of FMD is considered for a patient thorough medical history, family history as well as vascular examination should be completed. A definitive diagnosis of FMD can only be made with imaging studies. Catheter-based angiography (with contrast) has proven to be the most accurate imaging technique: this test involves a catheter is inserted into a large artery and advanced until it reaches the vessel of question. The catheter allows practitioners to view and measure the pressure of the artery aiding in the categorization and severity of the FMD diseased artery. According to Olin, ‚Äúcatheter-based angiography is the only imaging modality that can accurately identify the changes of FMD, aneurysm formation, and dissection in the branch vessels.‚Äù Practitioners believe it is important to utilize IVUS imaging because stenosis can sometimes only be detected through the methods of pressure gradient or IVUS imaging. In addition, computed tomography angiography and magnetic resonance angiography are commonly used to evaluate arteries in the brain. Doppler ultrasound may be used in both the diagnosis and follow-up of FMD. =Similar diseases= * In the visceral distribution, Segmental arterial mediolysis may mimic FMD. * In the visceral and cerebrovascular distribution, atherosclerosis must be considered. =Children= The differentiating presentations are suggestive of FMD being a unique syndrome in respect to the pediatric population. Experienced FMD clinicians warn against relying in the ‚Äústring of beads‚Äù angiography for a diagnosis. In fact, it is suggested that FMD may be both under and over- diagnosed in children with stroke. Treatment There is no known cure for FMD. However, treatment focuses on relieving associated symptoms. Medical management is the most common form of treatment. The best approach to medically managing these patients is constantly being reevaluated as more information is learned about the disease. =Kidney treatment= Blood pressure control is the primary concern when treating patients with renal FMD. In cases of renal artery stenosis and indications for intervention, percutaneous balloon angioplasty may be recommended. Many studies have assessed the success rate of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in these cases, and have found relief of hypertensive symptoms. Duplex ultrasonography should be performed soon after this procedure to ensure adequate renal velocities. Stents have a restenosis rate of 10-20%, and may make surgical revascularization more difficult. Surgical revascularization may be necessary if aneurysms develop within the affected artery or if PTA does not resolve the issue. Ex vivo renal artery reconstruction is sometimes used for complex diseases where branches of the renal artery are affected. =Cerebrovascular treatment= Patients with carotid or vertebral FMD should be medically managed to reduce the risk of a stroke. Aspirin 81 mg is typically prescribed for patients with carotid FMD. Antiplatelets and anticoagulants may be used to reduce the risk of blood clot formation. If a TIA or stroke are to occur, percutaneous angioplasty and antiplatelet therapy may be necessary. =Treatment for FMD in other regions= Little information is known regarding the best treatment for FMD outside of the renal and extracranial regions. If claudication or limb ischemia is consequent to FMD in the extremities, angioplasty may be implemented. =Children= Pediatric FMD medical and surgical treatments or interventions are available. Treatment is determined by factors such as age and disease location but routinely involve controlling hypertension, re-establishing vascular flow, clot prevention, and improving lifestyle such as diet, exercise and smoking cessation.Medical therapy for pediatric population may involve the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE inhibitors) and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers, multiple anti-hypertensive medications, diuretics, calcium channel blockers, and beta-blockers. Prevention of thrombosis of affected arteries may be taken through administration of an antiplatelet medication such as aspirin. Percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) remains the gold standard for renal-artery FMD. This treatment is useful when hypertension is difficult to control; patient is intolerant to the anti-hypertensive medications, non- complainant to medication regime and patient loss of renal volume due to ischemia. PTRA can also aide in preventing a lifelong dependency on a medication for such a young patient. According to Meyers, ‚Äúeffective PTRAs result in cured or controlled blood pressure, which is often signified by reductions in plasma renin activity and angiotensin II levels, and when compared with surgery, percutaneous balloon angioplasty is less costly, able to be performed on an outpatient basis, results in lower morbidity, and the use of stenting is not primarily necessary.‚Äù However, there is a subset of the pediatric population that are resistant to PTRA. Adverse events may include, ‚Äúrecurrent stenosis, arterial occlusion with renal loss, and arterial rupture with extravasations and pseudo aneurysm formation and may require surgical intervention. Prognosis Prognosis and outcome research is scant. In some cases if not managed properly FMD-related aneurysms can occur causing bleeding into the brain, resulting in stroke, permanent nerve damage, or death. Shedding light in the importance of detection and seeking appropriate care in reference to outcomes. What we do know is patients with multi-focal fibroplasia generally have a favorable prognosis. However, those who present with FMD in multiple vascular beds, or focal disease involving multiple branches of the renal arteries may develop renal artery dissection or progressive renal impairment. Therefore, having a more difficult and complex prognostic course. There are presently no specific studies or reports on the long-term prognosis and outcome of FMD in children.

The crater is between in diameter, making it the second-largest known crater in Brazil. Its age is estimated to be about 220 million years (Triassic period). The name means Pack-Saddle Mountains in Portuguese.  Description  The outer perimeter is a circular inward scarp about in diameter on the largely undisturbed Cretaceous and upper Silurian sediments of the Parna√≠ba basin, breached on the west, north, and south sides by drainage valleys. Within the perimeter there is a series of concentric circular valleys and a central basin, all at roughly the same elevation, separated by ring walls. Shuttle Radar Topography Mission imagery shows a faint ring about in diameter, a second ring of gentle hills about in diameter, and an inner ring of steeper hills, about in diameter and up to high, open to the northwest, surrounding a central basin about in diameter. The impact origin is attested by the presence of impact breccias, quartzite shatter cones and shocked quartz. The meteorite is believed to have struck the surface at a low oblique angle, 25 to 30 degrees on dry land. Radial faults are present inside the crater, and some extend up to 16 km from the center. Disturbed and steeply inclined sediments from the Carboniferous and Devonian periods occur within the crater. A magnetic survey of the structure indicates that deformation within the crater extends to a depth of about .  History and studies  The identification of the structure as an impact crater was first published in 1973 by R.S. Dietz and B.M. French. Shatter cones were reported by Beatty in 1980. Impact breccias, impact melting, and shocked quartz were reported by McHone in his 1986 thesis. A magnetic survey of the structure was published by A.A. Adepelumi and others in 2005.

An additional function on some flights is to maintain the cleanroom environment for precision instruments. Once outside the atmosphere the fairing is jettisoned, exposing the payload to outer space. The standard payload fairing is typically a cone-cylinder combination, due to aerodynamic considerations, although other specialized fairings are in use. The type of fairing which separates into two halves upon jettisoning is called a clamshell fairing by way of analogy to the bifurcating shell of a clam. In some cases the fairing may enclose both the payload and the upper stage of the rocket, such as on Atlas V and Proton M.A Conceptual Design for the Space Launch capability of the peacekeeper ICBM If the payload is attached both to the booster's core structures and to the fairing, the payload may still be affected by the fairing's bending loads, as well as inertia loads due to vibrations caused by gusts and buffeting.Thomas P.

Failure of the fairing to separate in these cases may cause the craft to fail to reach orbit, due to the extra mass. The Augmented Target Docking Adapter in orbit, with its payload fairing still attached The Augmented Target Docking Adapter, to be used for the Gemini 9A crewed mission, was successfully placed into orbit by an Atlas SLV-3 in June 1966. But when the Gemini crew rendezvoused with it, they discovered the fairing had failed to open and separate, making docking impossible. Two lanyards, which should have been removed before flight, were still in place. The cause was determined to be a launch crew error. In 1999, the launch of the IKONOS-1 Earth observation satellite failed after the payload fairing of the Athena II rocket did not open properly, preventing the satellite from reaching orbit.Athena Investigation Points to Payload Fairing On February 24, 2009, NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory satellite failed to reach orbit after liftoff; the agency concluded that the fairing on the Taurus XL launch vehicle failed to separate, causing the vehicle to retain too much mass and subsequently fall back to Earth and land in the Indian Ocean near Antarctica.\\"NASA Satellite Crashes Before Reaching Orbit\\" The same happened to the Naro-1, South Korea's first carrier rocket, launched on August 25, 2009. During the launch, half of the payload's fairing failed to separate, and as a result, the rocket was thrown off course. The satellite did not reach a stable orbit. On March 4, 2011, NASA's Glory satellite launch failed to reach orbit after liftoff due to a fairing separation failure on the Orbital Sciences Taurus XL launch vehicle, ending up in the Indian Ocean.Buck, Joshua (February 19, 2013). \\"NASA Releases Glory Taurus XL Launch Failure Report Summary\\".

NASA subsequently decided to switch the launch vehicle for the Orbiting Carbon Observatory's replacement, OCO-2, from a Taurus to a Delta II rocket. On August 31, 2017, ISRO's IRNSS-1H satellite failed to deploy after the payload fairing of the rocket PSLV-C39 failed to separate. As a result of extra mass, the rocket could not reach the desired orbit despite each stage's performance being nominal. The payload separated internally, but got stuck within the heat shield.

Bacteroides species are non endospore-forming bacilli, and may be either motile or nonmotile, depending on the species. The DNA base composition is 40‚Äì48% GC. Unusual in bacterial organisms, Bacteroides membranes contain sphingolipids. They also contain meso-diaminopimelic acid in their peptidoglycan layer. Bacteroides species are normally mutualistic, making up the most substantial portion of the mammalian gastrointestinal microbiota, where they play a fundamental role in processing of complex molecules to simpler ones in the host intestine. As many as 1010‚Äì1011 cells per gram of human feces have been reported. They can use simple sugars when available; however, the main sources of energy for Bacteroides species in the gut are complex host-derived and plant glycans. Studies indicate that long-term diet is strongly associated with the gut microbiome composition--those who eat plenty of protein and animal fats have predominantly Bacteroides bacteria, while for those who consume more carbohydrates the Prevotella species dominate. One of the most important clinically is Bacteroides fragilis. Bacteroides melaninogenicus has recently been reclassified and split into Prevotella melaninogenica and Prevotella intermedia. Pathogenesis Bacteroides species also benefit their host by excluding potential pathogens from colonizing the gut. Some species (B. fragilis, for example) are opportunistic human pathogens, causing infections of the peritoneal cavity, gastrointestinal surgery, and appendicitis via abscess formation, inhibiting phagocytosis, and inactivating beta-lactam antibiotics. Although Bacteroides species are anaerobic, they are transiently aerotolerant and thus can survive in the abdominal cavity. In general, Bacteroides are resistant to a wide variety of antibiotics--Œ≤-lactams, aminoglycosides, and recently many species have acquired resistance to erythromycin and tetracycline. This high level of antibiotic resistance has prompted concerns that Bacteroides species may become a reservoir for resistance in other, more highly pathogenic bacterial strains. It is susceptible to clindamycin. Microbiological applications An alternative fecal indicator organism, Bacteroides, has been suggested because they make up a significant portion of the fecal bacterial population, have a high degree of host specificity that reflects differences in the digestive system of the host animal Over the past decade, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods have been used to detect the presence of various microbial pathogens through the amplification of specific DNA sequences without culturing bacteria. One study has measured the amount of Bacteroides by using qPCR to quantify the host-specific 16S rRNA genetic marker. This technique allows quantification of genetic markers that are specific to the host of the bacteria Bacteroides and allow detection of recent contamination. A recent report found temperature plays a major role in the amount of time the bacteria will persist in the environment, the life span increases with colder temperatures (0‚Äì4 ¬∞C). Early research suggests that affects brain development. \\"A new study has found that there is a three-way relationship between a type of gut bacteria, cortisol, and brain metabolites. This relationship, the researchers hypothesize, may potentially lead to further insight into autism, but more in-depth studies are needed.\\" Human Bacteroides species' main source of energy is fermentation of a wide range of sugar derivatives from plant material. These compounds are common in the human colon and are potentially toxic. Bacteroides such as Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron converts these sugars to fermentation products which are beneficial to humans. Bacteroides also have the ability to remove side chains from bile acids, thus returning bile acids to the hepatic circulation. There is data suggesting that members of Bacteroides affect the lean or obese phenotype in humans. In this article, one human twin is obese while the other is lean. When their fecal microbiota is transplanted into germ-free mice, the phenotype in the mouse model corresponds to that in humans. * CrAssphage * Cytophaga * Flavobacterium  References   External links  * Bacteroides infections in E Medicine * Bacteroides in detail.

It is located between Broad Street and 11th Street, and extends from South Street to Washington Avenue. Background The most prominent landmark in the neighborhood was Martin Luther King Jr. Plaza, a public housing high-rise complex at 13th and Fitzwater Street, originally called Hawthorne Square. The four MLK towers were imploded on October 17, 1999, and have been slowly replaced with a mix of low-rise public housing, based on New Urbanism ideas, thanks to the HOPE VI program. Hawthorne is in transition, one of the few neighborhoods contiguous to Center City, Philadelphia that had been left relatively untouched by major upscale development. It is also sandwiched between gentrifying neighborhoods: Southwest Center City is to its west and Bella Vista is to its east. Much of Hawthorne is currently being renovated. Old homes are being renovated with only the exterior remaining. Other properties that were commercial are being (or have been) demolished and new town homes have replaced them. Approximately 10 new homes a year for the past 2 years, the current tax abatement and home with parking are what are attracting new residents. The Nathaniel Hawthorne elementary school was converted into condominiums in 2011. The High School for the Creative and Performing Arts is also located in Hawthorne, in the former Ridgway Library. The ornate building dates to 1878 and is modeled after the Parthenon, and is the former home of the Library Company of Philadelphia. History According to Sandra Robinson , Hawthorne Square was originally the name given to the area between roughly Lombard and Bainbridge. A popular African American nightlife spot for jazz musicians, vices, and rowdy bars, it was also a site of poverty and street crime.

It was based on John Steinbeck's 1939 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name. The screenplay was written by Nunnally Johnson and the executive producer was Darryl F. Zanuck.. The film tells the story of the Joads, an Oklahoma family, who, after losing their farm during the Great Depression in the 1930s, become migrant workers and end up in California. The motion picture details their arduous journey across the United States as they travel to California in search of work and opportunities for the family members, and features cinematography by Gregg Toland. The film is widely considered to be one of the greatest American films of all time. In 1989, it was one of the first 25 films selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Plot The film opens with Tom Joad (Henry Fonda), released from prison and hitchhiking his way back to his parents' family farm in Oklahoma. Tom finds an itinerant ex-preacher named Jim Casy (John Carradine) sitting under a tree by the side of the road. Casy was the preacher who baptized Tom, but now Casy has \\"lost the spirit\\" and his faith. Casy goes with Tom to the Joad property only to find it deserted. There, they meet Muley Graves (John Qualen) who is hiding out. In a flashback, he describes how farmers all over the area were forced from their farms by the deed holders of the land. A local boy (John Arledge), hired for the purpose, is shown knocking down Muley's house with a Caterpillar tractor. The large Joad family of twelve leaves at daybreak, along with Casy, who decides to accompany them. They pack everything into a dilapidated 1926 Hudson \\"Super Six\\" sedan adapted to serve as a truck in order to make the long journey to the promised land of California. The trip along Highway 66 is arduous, and it soon takes a toll on the Joad family. The elderly Grandpa (Charley Grapewin) dies along the way. Tom writes the circumstances surrounding the death on a page from the family Bible and places it on the body before they bury it so that if his remains were found, his death would not be investigated as a possible homicide. They park in a camp and meet a man, a migrant returning from California, who laughs at Pa's optimism about conditions in California. He speaks bitterly about his experiences in the West. Grandma (Zeffie Tilbury) dies when they reach California, the son Noah (Frank Sully) and son-in-law Connie (Eddie Quillan) also leave the family group. The family arrives at the first transient migrant campground for workers and finds the camp is crowded with other starving, jobless and desperate travelers. Their truck slowly makes its way through the dirt road between the shanty houses and around the camp's hungry-faced inhabitants. Tom says, \\"Sure don't look none too prosperous.\\" After some trouble with a so-called \\"agitator\\", the Joads leave the camp in a hurry. The Joads make their way to another migrant camp, the Keene Ranch. After doing some work in the fields, they discover the high food prices in the company store for meat and other products. The store is the only one in the area, by a long shot. Later they find a group of migrant workers are striking, and Tom wants to find out all about it. He goes to a secret meeting in the dark woods. When the meeting is discovered, Casy is killed by one of the camp guards. As Tom tries to defend Casy from the attack, he inadvertently kills the guard. Tom suffers a serious wound on his cheek, and the camp guards realize it will be easy to identify him. That evening the family hides Tom under the mattresses of the truck just as guards arrive to question them; they are searching for the man who killed the guard. Tom avoids being spotted and the family leaves the Keene Ranch without further incident. After driving for a while, they must stop at the crest of a hill when the engine overheats due to a broken fan belt; they have little gas, but decide to try coasting down the hill to some lights. The lights are from a third type of camp: Farmworkers' Wheat Patch Camp (Weedpatch in the book), a clean camp run by the Department of Agriculture, complete with indoor toilets and showers, which the Joad children had never seen before. Tom is moved to work for change by what he has witnessed in the various camps. He tells his family that he plans to carry on Casy's mission in the world by fighting for social reform. He leaves to seek a new world and to join the movement committed to social justice. Tom Joad says: > I'll be all around in the dark. I'll be everywhere. Wherever you can look, > wherever there's a fight, so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever > there's a cop beatin' up a guy, I'll be there. I'll be in the way guys yell > when they're mad. I'll be in the way kids laugh when they're hungry and they > know supper's ready, and when the people are eatin' the stuff they raise and > livin' in the houses they build, I'll be there, too. As the family moves on again, they discuss the fear and difficulties they have had. Ma Joad concludes the film, saying: > I ain't never gonna be scared no more. I was, though. For a while it looked > as though we was beat. Good and beat. Looked like we didn't have nobody in > the whole wide world but enemies. Like nobody was friendly no more. Made me > feel kinda bad and scared too, like we was lost and nobody cared.... Rich > fellas come up and they die, and their kids ain't no good and they die out, > but we keep a-coming.

In that month it won the National Book Award, favorite fiction book of 1939, voted by members of the American Booksellers Association. Soon it won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. \\"Novel\\" (Winners 1917‚Äì1947). The Pulitzer Prizes. Retrieved January 28, 2012. In 1962, the Nobel Prize committee said The Grapes of Wrath was \\"great work\\" and one of the committee's main reasons for granting Steinbeck the Nobel Prize for Literature. Time magazine included the novel in its \\"TIME 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005\\". In 2009, The Daily Telegraph also included the novel in its \\"100 novels everyone should read\\". In 1998, the Modern Library ranked The Grapes of Wrath tenth on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. Differences from the novel The first part of the film follows the book fairly closely. However, the second half and the ending in particular are significantly different from the book. While the book ends with the downfall and break-up of the Joad family, the film switches the order of sequences so that the family ends up in a \\"good\\" camp provided by the government, and events turn out relatively well. In the novel, Rose-of-Sharon (\\"Rosasharn\\") Rivers (played in the film by Dorris Bowdon) gives birth to a stillborn baby. Later she offers her milk- filled breasts to a starving man, dying in a barn. These scenes were not included in the film. While the film is somewhat stark, it has a more optimistic and hopeful view than the novel, especially when the Joads land at the Department of Agriculture camp ‚Äì the clean camp. Also, the producers decided to tone down Steinbeck's political references, such as eliminating a monologue using a land owner's description of \\"reds\\" as anybody \\"that wants thirty cents an hour when we're payin' twenty-five,\\" to show that under the prevalent conditions that definition applies to every migrant worker looking for better wages. The film emphasizes Ma Joad's pragmatic, forward-looking way of dealing with their situation despite Tom's departure, as it concludes with her spiritual \\"We're the people\\" speech.Steinbeck, John. The Grapes of Wrath, 1939. Penguin Classics; Reissue edition October 1, 1992. Ivy and Sairy Wilson, who attend to Grandpa's death and travel with the Joads until they reach California, are left out of the movie. Noah's departure from the family is passed over in the movie. Instead, he simply disappears without explanation. In the book, Floyd tells Tom about how the workers were being exploited, but in the movie he does not appear until after the deputy arrives in Hooverville. Sandry, the religious fanatic who scares Rose of Sharon, is left out of the movie. Vivian Sobchack argued that the film uses visual imagery to focus on the Joads as a family unit, whereas the novel focuses on their journey as a part of the \\"family of man\\". She points out that their farm is never shown in detail, and that the family members are never shown working in agriculture; not a single peach is shown in the entire film. This subtly serves to focus the film on the specific family, as opposed to the novel's focus on man and land together. In the film, most family members are either reduced, such as Al, Noah and Uncle John, to background characters or, like Rose of Sharon and Connie, to being the focus of only one or two relatively minor scenes. Instead, the film is largely concerned with Tom, Ma and, to a lesser extent, Jim Casy. Thus, despite the film's focus on the Joads as a specific family rather than a part of the \\"family of man\\", the movie explores very little of the members of the family itself.

Zanuck and director John Ford were odd choices to make this film because both were considered politically conservative. Zanuck was nervous about the left-wing political views of the novel, especially the ending. Due to the red- baiting common to the era, Darryl Zanuck sent private investigators to Oklahoma to help him legitimize the film. When Zanuck's investigators found that the \\"Okies'\\" predicament was indeed terrible, Zanuck was confident he could defend political attacks that the film was somehow pro-Communist. Ebert believes that World War II also helped sell the film's message, as Communism received a brief respite from American demonizing during that period.Ebert, Roger.

In a film review written for Time magazine by its editor Whittaker Chambers, he separated his views of Steinbeck's novel from Ford's film, which he liked.

A review in Variety reported, \\"Here is outstanding entertainment, projected against a heart-rending sector of the American scene,\\" concluding, \\"It possesses an adult viewpoint and its success may lead other producers to explore the rich field of contemporary life which films long have neglected and ignored.\\" John Mosher wrote in The New Yorker, \\"With a majesty never before so constantly sustained on any screen, the film never for an instant falters.

Gibbons made his first-class debut for Worcestershire against the touring New Zealanders at New Road in June 1927, making 19 and 17, and taking 2-27 in the first innings, which was to remain his best bowling. He retained his place for the rest of the season, but did not set the world alight. However, the next year was another matter, as he scored four hundreds, including an unbeaten 200 against the West Indians in July. In this year, he was capped by his county: the first cap Worcestershire had awarded. He continued to play a key role for his county up until the Second World War, forging a very useful opening partnership with Cyril Walters in the early 1930s. Most years Gibbons averaged in the thirties, and in 1933 he passed 2,000 runs in a season for the first time, but in 1934 he had the best summer of his career, scoring 2,654 runs at 52.03 with eight centuries; this remains the highest season's aggregate for the county. Indeed, a purple patch in late May and early June of that year produced successive scores of 93, 7, 88, 104, 157, 70*, 100 and 129. Never again did Gibbons quite reach the heights of 1934, although he did pass 2,000 runs once more, when averaging 43.26 in 1938. The following year he recorded his career-best innings when he hit 212 not out against Northamptonshire, but the Second World War intervened, and though he returned to play three matches for Worcestershire in 1946, he was not a success and his career came to an end. Gibbons scored first-class hundreds against all the other counties with the single exception of Somerset. Nevertheless, he was never capped by England, and had to content himself with appearances for the Players and the North of England, both in 1928, as well as a benefit season ten years later. He died in Worcester at the age of 68.

DART First State provides local and inter-county bus service throughout the state and also subsidizes commuter rail service along SEPTA Regional Rail's Wilmington/Newark Line serving the northern part of the state. The agency also operates statewide paratransit service for people with disabilities. DART First State is a subsidiary of the Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT). Although most of its bus routes run in and around Wilmington and Newark in New Castle County; DART operates bus route networks in the Dover area of Kent County; nine year-round bus routes serving Georgetown and Sussex County, plus additional seasonal routes connecting Rehoboth Beach and other beach towns in Sussex County and with Ocean City, Maryland. DART was awarded the prestigious Public Transportation System Outstanding Achievement Award by the American Public Transportation Association in 2003.http://www.deldot.gov/public.ejs?command=PublicNewsDisplay&id;=1456 History Former logo, still used on many buses DART First State traces its origins back to June 30, 1864, when the Wilmington City Railroad Company began trolley service powered by horses and mules along city streets in Wilmington. The Wilmington City Railroad Company introduced electric trolley service in 1888, the first such service in Delaware. Motor buses were first introduced in 1925. The electric trolleys were replaced with trackless electric trolleys in 1938. Bus service operated by Delaware Coach Company replaced the trackless electric trolleys in 1958 and would operate for over a decade. Delaware was also served by several private bus operators. Among these was Short Line, which provided seasonal service to Rehoboth Beach along with service to Oxford, Kennett Square, and West Chester in Pennsylvania. These private bus services were discontinued in the early 1960s. The Delaware General Assembly created the Delaware Authority for Regional Transit (DART) in 1969 to take over bus service in the Wilmington area from the Delaware Coach Company. DART bus service originally operated under the Greater Wilmington Transportation Authority, but in 1971 the Delaware Department of Transportation (DelDOT) became the governing agency of DART. The Delaware Transit Authority oversaw the Central Delaware Transit (CDT) bus service in the Dover area and the Resort Transit bus service at the Delaware Beaches, which both began in 1990. In 1994, the Delaware Transit Corporation (DTC) was created by the Delaware General Assembly to manage and operate DART, the Delaware Administration for Specialized Transportation, the Delaware Railroad Administration, and the Commuter Services Administration. DTC operates DART First State bus service throughout the state along with contracting with SEPTA Regional Rail to provide commuter rail service along the Wilmington/Newark Line in New Castle County. DART First State was named \\"Most Outstanding Public Transportation System\\" in 2003 by the American Public Transportation Association. In 2016, DART First State received a $2 million grant from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) for six battery electric buses to be used in the Dover area. In 2017, the agency received a $1 million grant from the FTA for ten battery electric buses, eight of which would be used in New Castle County while the other two would be used in Sussex County. The FTA gave DART First State a $2.6 million grant to purchase more electric buses in 2019. DART First State's fleet of battery electric buses are manufactured by Proterra, Inc. Fixed-route bus service =New Castle County= Wilmington station on the Route 2 line DART First State operates 39 fixed route bus routes throughout New Castle County, the majority of which hub in downtown Wilmington. Other major bus hubs in New Castle County include Newark Transit Hub in Newark and the Christiana Mall Park & Ride at the Christiana Mall. Most routes operate Monday through Saturday with some Sunday service. All except 3 of these routes are directly operated by DART First State; the remaining 3 routes (Rts. 61, 62 & 64) are operated by third-party contractors. =Kent County= DART First State operates 10 fixed route bus routes within the Dover area. These bus routes operate Monday through Friday with some Saturday service out of the Dover Transit Center in downtown Dover as a hub-and-spoke system. These routes are numbered in the 100-series. In addition to the fixed-route service, GoLink Flex bus service formerly provided service from points within the Dover area to a free transfer to a fixed route. This service was available on weekdays through advance reservations. GoLink Flex bus service was discontinued in May 2017 due to low usage. =Sussex County= DART First State operates a total of 11 bus routes within Sussex County. Nine of these routes offer year-round fixed route bus service within Sussex County. During summer months, DART operates 6 seasonal bus routes, including expanded service on 4 of the year- round routes, branded as \\"Beach Bus\\" which hub at the Rehoboth Beach Park and Ride and Lewes Transit Center park and ride lots and offer connecting service to coastal communities along the Delaware Beaches and to Ocean City, Maryland from May to September. These routes are numbered in the 200-series. Three of the year-round routes are \\"Flex Routes\\", where passengers can make reservations for the bus to pick them up within a mile off the fixed route and also flag the bus at any location in designated Flag Zones; these routes are numbered in the 900-series. =Intercounty Service= DART First State bus 914 at the Christiana Mall Park & Ride on the Route 301 line DART First State operates four intercounty bus routes which connect the three separate systems. Route 301 operates weekday and limited Saturday service between Downtown Wilmington, Christiana Mall, Middletown, Smyrna, and Dover and Route 302 operates weekday service between Newark and Dover via Glasgow, Middletown, Townsend, and Smyrna, connecting the New Castle and Kent Counties fixed route systems.

Four counselors were reassigned as an investigation into the falsifying of transcripts took place. It was reported that 34 students had been given credits they didn't deserve. Most were given credit for a \\"co-op\\" work experience program that the district had discontinued years earlier. Superintendent James Willis said in a letter to parents, \\"The Board of Education and I, along with my administrative team, are absolutely appalled by what we have discovered. This won't be tolerated. Moving forward, I am organizing an internal protocols team to assess the current transcript review processes and to make recommendations to ensure something like this can never happen again.\\" Some students might have to take summer classes or an extra semester in order to graduate on time.

It was founded in 1907 as the Alberta Amateur Hockey Association (AAHA) to be the governing body for Alberta intra- city ice hockey play. As of the 2018‚Äì19 hockeyL season, the Chair of the Board of Directors was Terry Engen, and the Chief Executive Officer for operations management was Rob Litwinski. History Hockey had been played for over 10 years before Alberta was proclaimed a province in 1905. Play took place on an exhibition or friendly basis. As teams developed, a need developed for a governing body to administer the game at a provincial level for intra-city games. At a November 29, 1907 meeting in Red Deer, the Alberta Amateur Hockey Association was founded, with R.N. Brown elected as the first president of the organization. In 1914, the AAHA would be one of the founding associations for the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association, formed at meetings held on December 4, 1914 in the Chateau Laurier at Ottawa. In 2007, the centennial of the association was celebrated with the hosting of the Allan Cup in Stony Plain. =Senior League history= Calgary Stampeders of the Alberta Senior Hockey League In 1907 senior amateur hockey was organized into two tiers; the \\"A\\" level saw associations from Edmonton, Strathcona and Battleford, Saskatchewan. This \\"A\\" level was only technically amateur. A second \\"B\\" level was formed that was \\"pure amateur.\\" In the 1907-08 season, the Edmonton Hockey Club would win the Alberta \\"A\\" championship and challenge the Montreal Wanderers for the Stanley Cup. While Calgary was larger than Edmonton at the time of the AAHA founding, the Calgary associations declined to participate until joining the Senior \\"A\\" league in 1910. The Calgary Shermans, named for their rink, were the first team from Calgary. In 1910, Edmonton would again challenge for the Stanley Cup, this time against the Ottawa Senators. This would be the last challenge for the Stanley Cup from AAHA teams. After the founding of the professional National Hockey Association, Canada's amateur senior teams would compete for the Allan Cup, which they do to this day. =Big Four League= For more information, see Big-4 League. In 1919, under the guidance of AAHA league president Allan McCaw, a new elite senior amateur league was established in Alberta with two teams each in Calgary and Edmonton. The league's intention was to compete for the Allan Cup, emblematic of Canada's national senior championship. The Tigers were created, along with the Canadians to represent Calgary, while the Edmonton Eskimos and Dominions represented Alberta's capital. The Calgary teams were hosted at the Victoria Arena, which had been converted into a hockey rink in 1918. While the Big Four League billed itself as an amateur circuit, it became known as a notorious example of a \\"shamateur\\" league, as amateur teams secretly employed professional players in an attempt to gain an upper hand on their competition. When the Big Four announced their intention to compete in the Allan Cup playdowns, the Pacific Coast Hockey Association sent a letter of protest to the Canadian Hockey Association, demanding that the league be declared professional, thus ineligible to compete for the Allan Cup. The CHA agreed, and stripped the league of its amateur standing after only one season. The controversy continued to haunt the Big Four in its second season. Repeated accusations were made by teams against their opponent's star players, accusing them of being pros. An accusation against the Eskimos' goaltender, Bill Tobin by the two Calgary teams led both to threaten to pull out of the league. While Tobin was vindicated, the threats led the league to suspend operations, formally canceling the championship. The Tigers and Eskimos, however, agreed to play their own playoff, known as the Intercity Championship. The Tigers defeated the Eskimos in a two-game, total goal series, but the Big Four League was finished. After the Big Four League disbanded and the Tigers and Eskimos formed the openly professional Western Canada Hockey League, the AAHA could concentrate on true amateur play. Various senior leagues have existed since 1921, and teams such as the Calgary Stampeders and Edmonton Flyers have played for and won the Allan Cup. =Junior League History= Alberta junior teams played against Saskatchewan Hockey Association teams to qualify for the Memorial Cup dating back to 1919. The first Alberta junior team to qualify for the Memorial Cup Finals was the Calgary Canadians in 1924. The Canadians would win the Memorial Cup in 1926. Like the rest of Canada, the junior leagues have developed into various tiers as the number of teams and popularity of ice hockey has grown. Today the CHL's Western Hockey League is the top junior level league operating in Alberta. Hockey Alberta operates the Alberta Junior Hockey League which was formed in 1963.

In 2006, the official name was State Farm NFL Matchup; it has also been known as the \\"Edge NFL Matchup\\" or other variations based on the current sponsor. As of 2017 it is known simply as the \\"ESPN NFL Matchup\\", and it is produced by NFL Films. During 2008-2009 NFL season, it aired every Sunday during the season on ESPN at 3:00am ET, then re-aired at 7:30am ET. Over the years the air-times have varied, typically with an initial showing on ESPN2 on Saturday morning, and the show being re- aired Sunday morning on ESPN. As of 2019, it is aired on ESPN2 sometime around 6:30 to 7:00AM ET on Saturday, depending on other programming, then re-aired on Sundays twice on ESPN, with the first showing, depending on other programming, at 3:00 to 4:00AM ET, and the second showing typically at 6:30AM ET. Additional special air-times take place during the playoffs and for other specially scheduled NFL games. Format Unlike Sunday NFL Countdown, NFL Primetime, Monday Night Countdown, NFL Insiders, and NFL Live, NFL Matchup gives fans an in-depth look at the NFL by breaking down the strategy and tactics‚Äîthe \\"X's and O's\\", after the symbols commonly used by coaches to diagram plays‚Äîof every pro football game. The program's analysts do this through the exclusive use of team-supplied coaching footage, the same video coaches and players use each week to prepare game plans and strategy. History The show started in 1984 as Monday Night Matchup with Chris Berman as host with Allie Sherman, former Giants coach, and Steve Sabol of NFL Films providing analysis. From 1993 to 2003, it was hosted by Mark Malone, SportsCenter anchor Stuart Scott and finally, ESPN sideline reporter Suzy Kolber, who became the first woman to host an NFL show. Since the 2004 season Sunday NFL Countdown and SportsCenter correspondent Sal Paolantonio has served as the host. Alongside him were Ron Jaworski and Merril Hoge. Jaworski, who also appeard on ESPN's Sunday NFL Countdown, joined ESPN in 1990 after a 17-year career as a quarterback, most notably with the Philadelphia Eagles. The show fits Jaworski style of breaking down the X's and O's of the football gridiron game. Hoge joined ESPN in 1996, where he serves as an analyst on NFL Live and ESPNews Football Friday, as well as NFL Matchup. He is a former fullback and an eight-year veteran, serving five of those years as a starter for the Pittsburgh Steelers. Television tape was used until 1994, when game film was used. The program converted to a high definition presentation for the 2011 season, though some game footage camera angles (which are mainly used internally by coaching staffs, and rarely by television networks during game broadcasts except in a few circumstances) remained provided to ESPN by the NFL in 480i standard definition for a short while after. With Jim Rome is Burning, which ended at the end of January 2012 never converting to HD, NFL Matchup was both the final ESPN program to convert to HD and the last still utilizing some SD presentation outside of rare SportsCenter highlights still in that format. After both Jaworski and Hoge were laid off by the network in April 2017, ESPN NFL insider Louis Riddick and Greg Cosell, the original co-creator of the show, were named the new co-hosts of the program. For the 2018 season, Riddick was replaced by Matt Bowen.

History Reset was formed in 1993 by Pierre Bouvier and Chuck Comeau when they were 13 years old. The original band members were Pierre Bouvier (vocals), Philippe Jolicoeur (guitar and vocals), Chuck Comeau (drums) and Jean-S√©bastien Boileau (bass). The original name for the band was Roach, but as another Canadian band was using this name, the band members decided to change theirs to Reset. The band's first full-length album, No Worries, released in 1997, was recorded at Le Studio Morin-Heights and produced by Rod Shearer. The band shot a video clip for the single \\"Why?\\". In 1998, the band lineup changed. Bouvier took Boileau's place in playing bass and a new member, Adrian White from Vancouver, replaced Comeau as drummer after a conflict between Bouvier and Comeau (see song \\"Friend\\" ‚Äì 1999). In 1999, the band released No Limits, which was co-written by Adrian White. This album was recorded in Vancouver, British Columbia, and was produced by Greg Reely. Three video clips were filmed for No Limits: \\"Pollution\\", \\"Pressure\\", and \\"My Dream and I\\". Shortly after the filming of \\"Pressure\\", Bouvier left Reset to reacquaint with Comeau and form Simple Plan. David Desrosiers replaced Bouvier in 2000 but only stayed with the band for six months, being recruited by Simple Plan members to fill their bass spot. In 2003, Reset released a third album, Radioactive. The album was produced, performed, mixed and mastered by Philippe Jolicoeur. This is the first album that Phil produced with his own record label, Indy Rekordz Inc. \\"Choke\\" and \\"Kyoto\\" are the singles and the new video clips for that album. On \\"Kyoto\\", Reset speaks about Kyoto Protocol. In March 2008, they released their fourth album No Intensity. This album is similar to their first album No Worries, with anti-government songs like \\"Corrupted To The Bone\\", \\"Redemption\\" and \\"Papillon\\". The latter song is based on the book Papillon by Henri Charri√®re, an autobiography relating Charri√®re's numerous imprisonments and escapes from French penal colonies. The single for this album is the song 'No Intensity'. The album is produced by Rod Shearer, who also produced No Worries and the band's demo CD Concerned. Over the years Reset participated in five Canadian tours and three American tours, the 1997, 2000 and 2006 Vans Warped Tour in North America. Reset has played with bands such as Green Day, MxPx, NOFX, Pennywise, Millencolin, Lagwagon, Face to Face, Strung Out, and Ten Foot Pole. In March 2009, the band performed a special show with their original line-up for Musique Plus's (French Much Music) punk rock show 1-2-3 Punk! 10th anniversary. They played with GrimSkunk, The Sainte Catherines, Vulgaires Machins, The Planet Smashers and Subb.Reset Will Play Special Show With Original Line-Up . Noise Press.

Each register in a circuit is replaced by a set of C registers (in series). This creates a circuit with C independent threads, as if the new circuit contained C copies of the original circuit. A single computation of the original circuit takes C times as many clock cycles to compute in the new circuit. C-slowing by itself increases latency, but throughput remains the same. Increasing the number of registers allows optimization of the circuit through retiming to reduce the clock period of the circuit. In the best case, the clock period can be reduced by a factor of C. Reducing the clock period of the circuit reduces latency and increases throughput. Thus, for computations that can be multi-threaded, combining C-slowing with retiming can increase the throughput of the circuit, with little, or in the best case, no increase in latency. Since registers are relatively plentiful in FPGAs, this technique is typically applied to circuits implemented with FPGAs.

The village has a smokery; the building burnt down on Christmas Eve 2008 and was rebuilt. At the start of Loch Awe, a great spot for a pike fishing or watching wildlife is An Lodan Bay, now more commonly referred to as Torran Bay, which has a hostel. Also to be built within the next year will be a new village shop, farm shop, bar restaurant and function room next to the hostel. There are historic paddocks along the side of the ford to Dalavich road. A hill known as Dun Dubh overlooks the village.  Prehistoric remains  Many prehistoric structures survive within the village boundary and are all easily accessible or can be seen from the public road. Opposite the guest house, in the village centre, stands a prehistoric burial mound known in Gaelic as Cnoc an Ath (hillock of the ford).

If the integers are the first q positive integers, where q is the number of edges, the graph and the labelling are called supermagic. A graph is vertex-magic if its vertices can be labelled so that the sum on any edge is the same. It is total magic if its edges and vertices can be labelled so that the vertex label plus the sum of labels on edges incident with that vertex is a constant. There are a great many variations on the concept of magic labelling of a graph. There is much variation in terminology as well. The definitions here are perhaps the most common. Comprehensive references for magic labellings and magic graphs are Gallian (1998), Wallis (2001), and Marr and Wallis (2013). Magic squares Euler diagram of requirements of some types of 4√ó4 magic squares. Cells of the same colour sum to the magic constant. * In 4√ó4 most- perfect magic squares, any 2 cells that are 2 cells diagonally apart (including wraparound) sum to half the magic constant, hence any 2 such pairs also sum to the magic constant. A semimagic square is an n √ó n square with the numbers 1 to n2 in its cells, in which the sum of each row and column is the same. A semimagic square is equivalent to a magic labelling of the complete bipartite graph Kn,n. The two vertex sets of Kn,n correspond to the rows and the columns of the square, respectively, and the label on an edge risj is the value in row i, column j of the semimagic square. The definition of semimagic squares differs from the definition of magic squares in the treatment of the diagonals of the square. Magic squares are required to have diagonals with the same sum as the row and column sums, but for semimagic squares this is not required. Thus, every magic square is semimagic, but not vice versa.

This was based on the fact that the decision in Huddart, Parker had relied on the now defunct theory of reserved state powers. This decision led to a significant revival in the use of the corporations power. =Corporations Law in Australia= Corporations law in Australia had historically mirrored developments in English law and was mostly the concern of each separate state legislature. Thus, despite the reliance on the English framework, significant differences emerged between each state's corporations legislation. After the Second World War it became increasingly clear that these legislative differences were creating unnecessary costs for companies operating nationally. Thus, the states and the Commonwealth co- operated in the formation of uniform national companies legislation which passed in each jurisdiction by 1962. The difficulty with this scheme was that it did not provide for uniformity in amendment of the legislation and with changes of government and policy each state's legislation once again developed on separate lines. A second co-operative scheme was agreed to in 1978 and implemented by 1982 to overcome the defects in the first system. All laws and amendments would be agreed to by a Ministerial Council and automatically applied in each jurisdiction. This second scheme led the creation of the National Companies and Securities Commission, the forerunner to the present day Australian Securities and Investment Commission. While an improvement on the first scheme, the 1982 scheme still presented significant difficulties mainly due to the NCSC delegating administrative functions to state commissions but retaining control of takeovers and policy. This led to funding difficulties and inefficient corporate regulation. Thus, the Commonwealth sought to take sole responsibility for corporations law in Australia. =Corporations Act 1989= Relying in the main on s51(xx) of the Constitution the Commonwealth enacted the Corporations Act 1989. Concerned with the constitutional validity of the legislation the states of New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia sought a declaration as to the validity of the aspects of the legislation dealing with the registration and incorporation of companies. The decision =The majority= The court split 6:1 in its decision. The majority (Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron & McHugh JJ) wrote a joint judgement in which they affirmed the view in Huddart, Parker that the corporations power was confined to making laws with respect to companies that had commenced trading and could not be interpreted so as to support laws providing for the formation of companies. The majority placed particular reliance on two arguments. The first being the presence of the past participle adjective \\"formed\\" which, in their Honours' opinion, restricted the section to companies which had already been formed. The second argument relied on were the speeches and notes of the Constitutional Convention debates. Successive drafts of the Constitution made it clear that the section was meant to apply to already formed companies. Moreover, the question of giving the Commonwealth the power to legislate for incorporation had been raised and had produced the following response from Sir Samuel Griffith: =The minority= Deane J wrote a vigorous dissenting judgment in which he said that the words of the constitution itself were authoritative, not the views expressed by the participants at the Constitutional Conventions. Deane J, in opposition to the majority of the court, considered that the wording of s51(xx) could be interpreted so as to give the Commonwealth a general power to incorporate trading and financial corporations. Consequences This decision had the practical effect of nullifying the intention of the Corporations Act 1989. However, not to be deterred, the Commonwealth sought the power it wanted through negotiation with the states. This process resulted in each state agreeing to pass identical registration legislation as amended from time to time and accepting the administrative control of ASIC. To fully achieve the aim of a national scheme the Commonwealth and states entered a cross-vesting of jurisdiction agreement in which the Federal Court was vested with state jurisdiction to hear company law matters. Although this system functioned effectively for several years it was eventually brought to its knees by the High Court in Re Wakim; Ex parte McNally,. Bond v The Queen,. and R v Hughes,. (2000) 171 ALR 155. These decisions precipitated further reform of the national corporation law scheme in 2001.

The first time it was recorded was in 1842, in the writings of Liudvikas Adomas Juceviƒçius. Since then it has been adapted many times for modern poems, ballets, and even rock operas. The authenticity of the entire story is questioned due to the possible influence of popular contemporary romantic tales. Synopsis The plot greatly varies between the different versions. However, the basic facts remain the same. The goddess (sometimes described as a mermaid or undine) J≈´ratƒó (from the noun j≈´ra meaning the sea) lived under the Baltic Sea in a beautiful amber castle. She ruled the sea and all of the sea-life. A young fisherman named Kastytis was disturbing the peace as he was catching a lot of fish. J≈´ratƒó decided to punish him and restore the peace, but she fell in love with the handsome young fisherman. They spent some happy times in the castle, but Perk≈´nas, the thunder god, found out that the immortal goddess had fallen in love with a mortal man. He became furious and struck the amber castle. It exploded into millions of pieces. Then J≈´ratƒó was chained to either the ruins or a rock on the seafloor by Perk≈´nas. According to legend, that is why pieces of amber come ashore after a storm on the Baltic Sea. J≈´ratƒó rescued Kastytis from drowning in a storm. According to other variations, Kastytis was killed by Perk≈´nas and J≈´ratƒó mourns him to this day. Her tear drops are amber pieces washed ashore and one could hear her sad voice in a stormy sea. Sometimes it is said that Kastytis is from ≈†ventoji, north of Palanga. Cultural significance Lithuanians have numerous legends and tales. Arguably, Eglƒó, the Queen of Serpents and J≈´ratƒó and Kastytis are the best known. Even though Eglƒó's story is much more complicated and elaborate, both legends are love stories that involve elements of Lithuanian mythology and try to explain origins of certain objects. Both Eglƒó and J≈´ratƒó are popular Lithuanian female names. Palanga, the main resort in Lithuania, has a monument dedicated to J≈´ratƒó and Kastytis. It is located in a square right next to the main tourist attraction--a bridge that leads to sunset. The Palanga coat of arms was designed having the legend in mind. The amber beads represent the ancient business of amber processing. The silver crown represents the goddess J≈´ratƒó. The legend has inspired a number of other artworks. In 1920, Maironis, one of the best known patriotic poets, wrote a ballad to honor the lovers. Much of legend's present popularity is attributed to this poet. Woodcut illustrations by Vaclovas Rataiskis-Ratas for the ballad won awards in an international exhibition in Paris in 1937. In 1933, a ballet was staged. In 1955, an opera (premiered in 1972 in Chicago) and a play were written. In 2002, a rock opera was performed in Klaipƒóda to celebrate its 750th anniversary. A number of celebrities appeared in the opera and it was a success. It continues where the actual legend left off: the castle is destroyed and the lovers are separated. The rock opera is noted for taking a modern twist on old story. Additionally, Jurata, a Polish sea side resort, popular especially among Varsovians and established during the interwar period is named after J≈´ratƒó, which is spelled Jurata in Polish. In a Latvian fairy tale, Bulbulis the Bird, three princes set out on a quest for the magical bird Bulbulis, but only the youngest succeeds. Seething with envy and jealousy, the older brothers cast the youngest into the sea and take the bird for themselves. However, the hero is saved by \\"the sea queen\\" and taken to her \\"amber castle\\".Zheleznova, Irina. Tales from the Amber Sea. Moscow: Progress Publishers. 1981 [1974]. pp. 282-290.

Within five years, the school received state funding and a new location in Olathe. In 1885 the thriving institution changed its name to Kansas Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb. Its emphasis, influenced by the work of Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, was on integrating deaf students into society, rather than housing them apart from it. From the beginning KSD emphasized vocational training. Leather working, baking, sewing, printmaking and other trades were incorporated into the curriculum. Vocational training continues to be an integral part of the KSD experience to this day.  Sports  Like many schools, KSD encourages students to participate in athletics.

He became the second prime minister of Siam in 1933 after ousting his predecessor in a coup d'√©tat. He retired in 1938 after serving five years as prime minister. Early life Phot Phahonyothin in Germany, 1905 Phot was born in Phra Nakhon Province (present-day Bangkok) to a Teochew Thai Chinese father, Colonel Kim Phahonyothin (), and a Thai Mon mother, Chap Phahonyothin (). After attending the Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy, in 1903 he was sent by royal scholarship to study at the Prussian Military Academy (Preu√üische Hauptkadettenanstalt) in the town of Lichterfelde, near Berlin, Germany, where he was apparently a classmate of Hermann G√∂ring and became acquainted with Hideki Tojo through sword duels. Phot was then sent to study at the Engineering College of Copenhagen in Denmark, he was however only able to complete one year as his scholarship funds had run out, he returned to Siam in 1912. In 1931 he was elevated to the title of Phraya Phahonphonphayuhasena by King Prajadhipok (or Rama VII) and received the rank of colonel. In 1932 he became Commander of the Royal Siamese Army. Revolutionary leader Phraya Phahon was an important member of a group of conspirators known as the \\"Four Musketeers\\" (). They were part of the Khana Ratsadon (or 'People's Party') who carried out the revolution of 1932. After 1932 coup, three factions formed among the political and military leaders of Khana Ratsadon. These were: first, the senior military faction led by Phraya Phahon; second, the junior army and navy faction led by Luang Phibunsongkhram; and third, the civilian faction led by Pridi Phanomyong. As the most senior Phraya Phahon was viewed as the de facto leader of the Khana Ratsadon and the revolution itself. It was Phraya Phahon who read the Declaration of the New Siamese State in the Royal Plaza that declared the end of absolute monarchy and the establishment of the constitutional Siamese state. Because of the key role he played in the revolution he was rewarded with a high position in the new government and was made a member of the new cabinet. In March 1933 a constitutional crisis developed in Siam over the \\"Yellow Cover Dossier\\" incident, precipitated by Pridi's draft economic plan, which contained socialist elements. Because of this, Phraya Manopakorn Nititada, the prime minister, expelled him from the cabinet and suspended the constitution. This action upset many in the People's Party who supported Pridi, including Phraya Phahon. On 15 June Phraya Phahon resigned from the cabinet citing health reasons. In truth, he and a couple of military officers planned to overthrow Phraya Mano's increasingly authoritarian government. On 20 June a bloodless coup was carried out, led by Phraya Phahon. The following day, Phraya Phahon appointed himself the second prime minister of Siam. He immediately sent a report to King Prajadhipok explaining the objectives of the coup and asked for the king's support. Reluctantly the king endorsed him. Phraya Mano was exiled to Malaysia. Premiership Phraya Phahon with old friend Hideki T≈çj≈ç in Tokyo in 1942, as Phibun's envoy. The next five years were a struggle to maintain power. In October 1933, a royalist revolt against Phraya Phahon's government, the Boworadet Rebellion, occurred only four months after his becoming prime minister. After weeks of fighting, government troops emerged victorious and Phraya Phahon was able to solidify his position. The cabinet was divided politically. The government was maintained only by the force of his personality. Luang Phibunsongkhram, a trusted confidant, became minister of defence under the new government and he began to acquire greater power and influence in preparation for his eventual ascension to the premiership. The beginning of the end for Phraya Phahon's time as prime minister began in 1937 when a scandal erupted involving the sale of crown real estate to high-ranking officials at below-market prices. After a near collapse that year, the first direct elections for the People's Assembly took place on 7 November 1937. Those in Phraya Phahon's cabinet found themselves an ideological and political minority. After budget issues in 1938, the cabinet was forced to resign in September 1938 followed by elections in December which resulted in Luang Phibunsongkhram becoming the prime minister of Thailand. Retirement and death After his term as prime minister, General Phraya Phahon retired from public life, though he served as Inspector-General of the Royal Thai Armed Forces during World War II. He died in February 1947 at the age of 59 of cerebral haemorrhage. It was said that when he died, despite the fact that he had held many positions in government, his family lacked the funds to pay for his funeral. Luang Phibunsongkhram, his protege and the incumbent prime minister, stepped in to defray the cost. Legacy left Phahonyothin Road, which runs from Bangkok to the border of Burma in the north, is named after Phraya Phahon. Formerly known as Prachathipatai Road, Field Marshal Plaek Phibunshongkhram renamed the road in his honour. A hospital in Kanchanaburi Province, Phahon Phon Phayuha Sena Hospital is also named in his honour. A Royal Thai Army artillery base in Lopburi Province bore the name of General Phraya Phahon until 2019 when, at the order of the king Vajiralongkorn, it was renamed King Bhumibol base. Long-standing statues of Phraya Phahon and Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram installed at the base are to be removed and replaced by a statue of King Bhumibol.

Trnovo is a town and municipality located in Sarajevo Canton of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, an entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. As of 2013, it has a population of 1,830 inhabitants. It is located a 30 kilometers southeast of the city of Sarajevo. As a result of the 1995 Dayton Accords, the municipality was divided between the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska (Trnovo). Settlements Aside from the town of Trnovo, the municipality include the following settlements: * Balba≈°iƒái * Bobovica * Brda * Brutusi * ƒåeru≈æiƒái * ƒåe≈°ina Strana * ƒåunƒçiƒái * Dejƒçiƒái * Delija≈° * Deseci * Dujmoviƒái * Durakoviƒái * Godinja * Gornja Presjenica * Hamziƒái * Jelaƒçiƒái * Karoviƒái * Kramari * Krsmaniƒái * Lediƒái * Lisoviƒái * Lukavac * Maƒëari * Mijanoviƒái * Obla Brda * Ostojiƒái * Pendiƒçiƒái * Pomenoviƒái * Preƒçani * Rakitnica * Rijeka * Sjeveroviƒái * ≈†abanci * ≈†abiƒái * ≈†i≈°iƒái * Trebeƒçaj * Tu≈°ila * Umƒçani * Umoljani * Zagor Demographics The pre-war municipality, with 63 settlements, had a total population of 6,991 people, of whom Muslims (or Bosniaks) were 68.81% and Serbs 29.45%. The Muslim-inhabited settlements became part of the Trnovo municipality of Federation B&H.; According to data from the municipality, it is the least populous municipality in the Sarajevo Canton, with a population of 1,747. It is also the least densely populated of the nine municipalities, and has the highest percentage of people over 65 years of age. Ethnically, 95.4% are Bosniaks and 4.6% are Serbs and this accounts for the entire population. Tourism Large sections of mountains of Igman, Bjela≈°nica, Visoƒçica, Treskavica and Jahorina, along with section of stunning Rakitnica canyon are located on the municipality territory, offering possibilities for sustainable tourism development. However, the main focus of growing criticism is rather this precise aspect of ignoring sustainable development. The problem of mismanagement and corruption in urban planning and decision making, with complete disregard of environmental standards and practices, followed with inherent lack of environmental consciousness and concerns for nature's balance and heritage within political sphere of influence, clears the way for commodification, which consequently lead to overdevelopment and intention to bring infrastructure, that might be unwarrantable and excessive in scale and scope, deep into preserved and undisturbed areals of high-valued nature with potential for statuary protection, which consequently results in environmental degradation. Whereas agriculture and especially traditional livestock, and husbandry and sheepherding had always been local trade of choice, and along with reasonable and sustainable tourism development, could still remain the main branch of the local economy.

It is currently branded as 104.5 The Zone, broadcasting a sports talk format. It is owned by Cumulus Media and operates out of studios in Nashville's Music Row district. Its transmitter is located just north of downtown Nashville. History The station signed on as WFMG-FM on December 1, 1960 in Gallatin, Tennessee, about 30 miles (47 km) northeast of Nashville, with a big band format. In 1971, Sumner Country Broadcasting Co., which owned WHIN in Gallatin, purchased WFMG and changed call letters to WHIN-FM. During the early years of WHIN-FM, the format was easy listening. In 1974, the station switched to an all oldies format. In July 1978, WHIN-FM switched formats to contemporary hit radio (CHR). Just over one month later, the call letters were changed to WWKX using the moniker KX 104 FM. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the station was very popular and featured morning DJ Coyote McCloud. Its 100,000 watt signal broadcasting from \\"Music Mountain\\", one of the highest points on the northern Highland Rim north of Gallatin and the site of several broadcasting facilities, boomed far into the rural areas of northern Tennessee and southern Kentucky. By the mid-1980s, KX 104 was faced with competition from two new area CHRs, \\"96 Kiss\\" (WZKS, now WCJK) and \\"Y107\\" (WYHY, now WRVW). Additionally, McCloud defected to WYHY in 1985 to host its morning show. To try to differentiate itself, WWKX segued into a rock-leaning Top 40 format calling itself Rock Hits 104, Kicks FM. This move proved unfruitful, and the station returned to mainstream CHR a year later in 1986. Faced with the success of Y107, this would not last. In the summer of 1987, WWKX moved its tower from Music Mountain into Nashville and downgraded power, noticeably affecting signal strength in rural areas north of the city. The call letters changed to WGFX on August 13, 1987 and the moniker became 104.5 The Fox with a classic rock format. In the late 1980s, Dick Broadcasting Company (DBC) took over operations of the station through a local marketing agreement, and paired it with its popular rock and roll station WKDF to form \\"Nashville's Rock Network\\". In the early 1990s, the station became known as \\"Arrow 104.5\\" (with Arrow originally standing for \\"All Rock n' Roll Oldies\\"). This format was somewhat successful and endured until the late 1990s. The station was purchased outright by Dick Broadcasting Company following the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which, in part, loosened broadcast ownership rules. Shortly after the acquisition, Dick Broadcasting entered into an agreement with SFX Broadcasting, the then-owner of WLAC-FM, to trade the intellectual property of the stations. The trade, to have taken place February 2, 1998, would have moved WLAC-FM's adult contemporary format to 104.5 FM, and moved WGFX's classic rock format to 105.9 under SFX ownership. However, when the agreement fell apart, SFX converted WLAC-FM to a classic rock format of its own, changed the call letters to WNRQ, and began to compete directly with WGFX. Responding to the early ratings success of WNRQ, WGFX reformatted to rhythmic oldies as \\"Jammin' Oldies 104.5\\", on December 11, 1998, but quickly changed its name to \\"Groovin' Hits 104.5\\" after a brief trademark dispute. In early 1999, WGFX was slated to convert to a country music outlet built around local air personality Carl P. Mayfield. Dick Broadcasting purchased advertising in other media promoting Mayfield's impending debut on 104.5 WGFX. However, the company ultimately succumbed to Mayfield's repeated demands that the format be installed on the stronger-signalled WKDF, leaving WGFX to continue broadcasting rhythmic oldies. In January 2000, the station reverted to a classic hits format, focusing mainly on 1970s music. First known as simply \\"The New 104 -- That '70s Station\\", it became \\"The New 104 -- The Core\\" a few months later, and was positioned as a lighter alternative to WNRQ. Citadel Broadcasting purchased the station (along with all of DBC's assets outside the Greenville, South Carolina market) in September 2000. In the summer of 2002, the station broadened its playlist to include music from 1980s, and changed its name to \\"Rockin' Hits 104.5 WGFX\\", marking the only time the station has used those call letters in its branding. =104.5 The Zone= Its current format, \\"104.5 The Zone\\" (sports talk), began its life on August 11, 2003 after hiring popular personalities George Plaster, Willy Daunic and Darren McFarland away from Cumulus Media station WWTN (99.7 FM). However, because of litigation surrounding a contract dispute, Plaster did not appear on the station until two months after its launch. In the early days of the Zone's existence, the station had a heavy focus on local news, and featured general-interest talk on weekdays from 6am-Noon, with sports in all other dayparts. For the first three weeks of the talk format, the station broadcast \\"The Rick and Bubba Show\\" (a holdover from the previous \\"Rockin' Hits\\" format). It then brought over Mayfield's \\"Carl P. & The P-Team\\" show from WKDF, where it had been replaced in morning drive. Following Mayfield's exit in December 2003, the station began broadcasting \\"The Wake-Up Zone\\" in early mornings, featuring Mayfield's supporting cast, but led by Nashville music industry executive Charlie Monk. Popular Knoxville morning talk personality Hallerin Hilton Hill also hosted a 2-hour version of his show for the Nashville market in the late morning slot. Over the course of 18 months, the station migrated to 24/7 sports talk. Hill's show was canceled, and \\"The Wake-Up Zone\\" was converted to a sports-focused show, replacing Charlie Monk & Mike Donegan with Kevin Ingram and retired Titans tight end Frank Wycheck. They joined Mark Howard, who continued with the show from its previous iteration. The trio of Ingram, Howard and Wycheck continued on the show until 2017, when Wycheck left the show and was replaced with another former Titans star, Blaine Bishop. WGFX was the flagship station for the Tennessee Oilers/Titans of the National Football League from 1997 until the completion of the 2001 season, when the rights were shifted to WGFX's sister station, WKDF. (WGFX returned as an \\"affiliate\\" station of the team's network for the 2004 season only). WGFX also aired the franchise's games in 1996, the final year the team was located in Houston, Texas. WGFX returned as the full-time flagship station of the Titans Radio Network in 2010. WGFX is the major Nashville-area affiliate for the University of Tennessee Volunteers football\\"Vol Network Football Affiliates\\". UTSports.com. and men's basketball,\\"Vol Network Basketball Affiliates\\". UTSports.com. and also broadcasts selected Belmont Bruins men's basketball games which do not conflict with the aforementioned teams.‚ÄúOn the Air - Belmont Bruins‚Äù. Belmont Bruins. Retrieved June 24, 2015. Coverage of NASCAR can now be heard on WGFX, from both Performance Racing Network and the Motor Racing Network. In the past, WGFX has served as the flagship station for the Nashville Predators (NHL, 2005-2010), Vanderbilt Commodores (SEC, 2004-2009), and Nashville Sounds (PCL, 2010-2011). WGFX has previously served as the Nashville affiliate for The Jim Rome Show, The Dan Patrick Show, Sporting News Radio and ESPN Radio, and is currently on its second stint as an affiliate of Fox Sports Radio. It was announced that in 2013 the station would once again drop its Fox affiliation to be an affiliate of the upstart CBS Sports Radio network, but never did actually did so. Shortly afterwards, the CBS Sports Radio affiliation went to a competitor, WNSR, as WGFX retained the Fox Sports Radio affiliation; however, WGFX also retains the hourly minute-long commentaries by CBSSR personalities such as Boomer Esiason and Doug Gottlieb. Following a bankruptcy, Citadel was acquired by Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011. Shortly after the merger, WGFX and WKDF moved their studios from Rutledge Hill to Cumulus' existing cluster at Music Row, where they broadcast alongside WWTN, WSM-FM, and WQQK. WRQQ and WNFN also briefly shared studio space with WGFX until they were each sold to separate buyers. Plaster, Daunic and McFarland left WGFX immediately after Cumulus acquired the station in September 2011, and the trio was instrumental in launching its primary competitor, WPRT-FM. In 2017, WGFX removed all network programming during its weekday prime dayparts, focusing entirely on locally-produced shows. Breaks in current format The station also broadcasts an hour block of public affairs programming on Sunday morning in accordance with FCC regulations.

It was delivered by Iqbal during the 25th annual session of the All-India Muslim League, on the afternoon of Monday, 29 December 1930, at Allahabad, British India. In this address Iqbal outlined a vision of an independent state for Muslim-majority provinces in northwestern India, thus becoming the first politician to articulate what would become known as the Two-nation theory‚Äîthat Muslims are a distinct nation and thus deserve political independence from other regions and communities of India. Allama Iqbal defined the Muslims of India as a nation and suggested that there could be no possibility of peace in the country unless and until they were recognized as a nation and under a federal system, the Muslim majority units were given the same privileges which were to be given to the Hindu majority units. It was the only way in which both the Muslims and the Hindus could prosper in accordance with their respective cultural values. In his speech, he emphasized that unlike Christianity, Islam came with \\"legal concepts\\" with \\"civic significance,\\" with its \\"religious ideals\\" considered as inseparable from social order: \\"therefore, the construction of a policy on national lines, if it means a displacement of the Islamic principle of solidarity, is simply unthinkable to a Muslim.\\" Iqbal thus stressed not only the need for the political unity of Muslim communities but the undesirability of blending the Muslim population into a wider society not based on Islamic principles. However, he would not elucidate or specify if his ideal Islamic state would construe a theocracy, even as he rejected secularism and nationalism. The latter part of Iqbal's life was concentrated on political activity. He would travel across Europe and West Asia to garner political and financial support for the League, and he reiterated his ideas in his 1932 address, and during the Third Round-Table Conference, he opposed the Congress and proposals for transfer of power without considerable autonomy or independence for Muslim provinces. History The Hindu-Muslim question had great importance and stood crucial to British Indian history after 1857, especially in the 20th century. But the key issue for Muslims remained \\"separate identity.\\" On several occasions and addresses, the issue gets highlighted that the Muslims are a separate nation with different culture and civilization, interests and rights. The Two-Nation Theory was not accepted by the Muslims, Hindus and the British peoples because they believed in \\"territorial nationalism\\". The Congress' perspective of Hindu Muslim relationship was that any perceived rift between the Hindus and Muslims was the product of the British divide and rule policy. According to the Congress, the British had consciously created splits and divisions, therefore it was an artificial issue which should not be emphasized. For Muslims it was the core issue, \\"I\\" was the central issue, it related to their culture, civilization, heritage and the type of arrangement that were to be done in the future political and constitutional arrangements of India. The Idea of separate Homeland based on many issues, the first was the decline and degeneration of the Muslims. Most of the Muslim states became the colonies of the European states. Then the industrial; revolution, development of science and technology became a preserve of the European nations. So, the question for Muslims was why the decline and degeneration have set in among the Muslims. The second issue was how to work for revival and regeneration of Muslims in general and how Muslims could overcome the decline and again assume their rightful place in the international system. The third issue was specific to the Muslims of South Asia who shared the problems of the Muslims as a whole, problem of decline and degeneration but in addition to this certain specific problems which pertain to British India and one important problem which Muslim faced was that that of minority, the majority were not Muslims and this makes the situation in British India different from the situation in the Middle Eastern Countries where Muslims were in majority. In British India the problem was that they could be overwhelmed by the other community, therefore they were emphasizing on their identity, value, culture and also heritage and civilization which they thought and emphasize time and again that it gave them a different, distinct and an exclusive identity. They were not simply a minority but a community and a nation. The reason was that they did not want to be absorbed into the majority community. =Phases of development= By 1930, this sentiment had developed very clearly which was very much demonstrated in the development of History of India or the question of the relationship between the Muslims and the other communities. It was in this context that Allama Iqbal delivered his presidential address. Iqbal, political thoughts developed in three phases. 1st Phase: Pre-1905 The 1st phase pertains to the pre-1905 period, before delivering the address Iqbal addresses the factors for the decline of the Muslims and he tries to focus on Indian nationality, nationhood or Indian unity. Iqbal explained about resolving differences in his book Bang-i-Dara and writes TarƒÅnah-i-Hindƒ´ and Naya shawala to reunite Muslims with Hindus.Pritchett, Frances. 2000. \\"Tarana-e- Hindi and Taranah-e-Milli: A Study in Contrasts.\\" Columbia University Department of South Asian Studies. 2nd Phase: The Stay in Europe 1905-08 The 2nd phase pertains the period from 1905 to 1908, Iqbal spent these years in Europe, during his higher education and in Germany at Monique University for PhD. His stay in England helps to crystallize his ideas. Iqbal appreciated certain things in the West, for example, the quest for knowledge, their efforts for innovation and change. Iqbal was critical of materialism, capitalism and competition an unrestricted and unlimited competition that was undermining the society and it is during this period that he began to think philosophically and scientifically about the Muslims and he emphasized on the importance of spiritualism in one's life. 3rd Phase: Return to India 1908 and onward The 3rd phase occurs when Iqbal comes back to India after his education. Here his exclusive attention and focus were on the Muslim. He talked about the centrality of Islam, the question of submission to God, Oneness of God, He emphasized in his writings pros as well as poetry and he talked about Muhammad as the ideal leader as the leader that the Muslims should try to follow. However, his focus was on primarily Muslims of this region when he dealt with the political or the constitutional issues of India. Iqbal got the title of SIR in 1922 in recognition of his intellectual work. In 1927 Iqbal was elected to the Punjab Legislative Council, so far next little over two years he served in the Punjab legislative council that is from 1927 to 1930, little over two years. =Revival of Islamic polity= Iqbal with Choudhary Rahmat Ali and other Muslim leaders Iqbal's six English lectures were published first from Lahore in 1930 and then by Oxford University press in 1934 in a book titled The Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam. Which were read at Madras, Hyderabad and Aligarh. These lectures dwell on the role of Islam as a religion as well as a political and legal philosophy in the modern age. In these lectures Iqbal firmly rejects the political attitudes and conduct of Muslim politicians, whom he saw as morally misguided, attached to power and without any standing with Muslim masses. Iqbal expressed fears that not only would secularism weaken the spiritual foundations of Islam and Muslim society, but that India's Hindu-majority population would crowd out Muslim heritage, culture and political influence. In his travels to Egypt, Afghanistan, Iran and Turkey, he promoted ideas of greater Islamic political co-operation and unity, calling for the shedding of nationalist differences. He also speculated on different political arrangements to guarantee Muslim political power; in a dialogue with Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, Iqbal expressed his desire to see Indian provinces as autonomous units under the direct control of the British government and with no central Indian government. He envisaged autonomous Muslim provinces in India. Under one Indian union, he feared for Muslims, who would suffer in many respects especially with regard to their existentially separate entity as Muslims. The Muslims of subcontinent were degraded both by British people and Hindus. After the advent of 1857,British people turn against Muslims thinking that they are only culprits and similarly Hindus want complete control over Muslims and they want to change constitution where Muslims should be suppressed and by not giving Muslims any importance. It was the cause due to which Iqbal presents his idea of uniting Muslims and Muslim majority areas such as Punjab, sindh, baluchistan and NWFP. Address 1930 Iqbal was elected president of the Muslim League in 1930 at its session in Allahabad, in the United Provinces as well as for the session in Lahore in 1932. In his presidential address on 30 December 1930, Iqbal outlined a vision of an independent state for Muslim-majority provinces in northwestern India. News clip reporting the landmark Allahabad session =The Address basis= In 1930 Iqbal delivered the Presidential Address the Allahabad Address, before address Iqbal also delivered landmark lectures on Islam in 1928 and 1929 in Aligarh, Hyderabad and Madras. Because Iqbal's address eye-plot was based on Islam. Iqbal's views on Islam and introversion with the modern conditions and modern situation helps him to generate the Allahabad Address. In 1932, Iqbal also presided over All India Conference that was held at Lahore and during that conference, he repeated some of the ideas and some of the thoughts which he had presented in his Address at 1930. =The Address outline= In his address, Iqbal called for the creation of \\"a Muslim India within India\\", especially in North-western India.Sir Muhammad Iqbal‚Äôs 1930 Presidential Address, from Columbia University site Iqbal demanded the right of self- government for the Muslims. as he said: Within his address, Iqbal also touched on his fear that Islam may have a similar fate as Christianity. \\"To Islam, matter is spirit realising itself in space and time\\" whereas Europe had \\"accepted the separation of Church and State and disliked the fact that their leaders were \\"indirectly forcing the world to accept it as unquestionable dogma [...] I do not know what will be the final fate of the national idea in the world of Islam. Whether Islam will assimilate and transform it as it has before assimilated and transformed many ideas expressive of a different spirit, or allow a radical transformation of its own structure by the force of this idea, is hard to predict. Professor Wensinck of Leiden (Holland) wrote to me the other day: \\"It seems to me that Islam is entering upon a crisis through which Christianity has been passing for more than a century. The great difficulty is how to save the foundations of religion when many antiquated notions have to be given up. Iqbal spoke of: In regards to the army, Iqbal stated: Iqbal also addresses how it was \\"painful to observe\\" the failed attempts to \\"discover such a principle of internal harmony\\". However, he still felt \\"hopeful\\". He expressed great concerns that the British politicians were \\"cleverly exploiting Hindu-Muslim differences regarding the ultimate form of Central Government\\" through Princes of the Princely States. He was also critical of the Simon Report that it did great \\"injustice to Muslims\\" to not be given a statutory majority for Punjab and Bengal. Furthermore, he demanded Sindh to be united with Baluchistan and turned into a separate province as it did not have anything in common with Bombay Presidency. Comparing the European democracy to Indian democracy, he justified the Muslim demand for a \\"Muslim India within India\\", saying: Commenting on the Hindu fears of religious rule in the Muslim autonomous states, Iqbal said: In his concluding remarks, Iqbal said: Importance Iqbal's address was known to have a forceful and logical presentation of the Muslim case in India. His address arises the awareness that Why should Muslims be treated as a political entity rather than a minority. His address highlights the following views that would prove highly beneficial in future. * Territorial adjustments will enable the Muslims to develop themselves in accordance with their ideas and serve the cause of Ummah. * Redistribution of territory developed later on the concept of a Muslim homeland. * He further expressed these ideas in letters to Jinnah from May 1936 to November 1937. He talked of a separate federation of Muslim provinces. The ( North Western India and Bengal can be considered as entitled to self-determination like other nations in India and outside. Shariah's development is impossible without a free Muslim state or states. He advised the Muslims to be above self-interest and devote themselves to Islam. * In difficult times, Islam has saved the Muslims. * Faith, culture and historical traditions are more important than patriotism.

Dutch Engineer Major General Henrik Ruse (1624-79) At the outbreak of the war with England, the Dutch engineer Major General Henrik Ruse (in service of Frederick III of Denmark) was sent to Norway together with Frederik Ahlefeldt where they remained until 1667 to upgrade fortifications. initiated the fortress construction, planned with three bastions and a half bastion on the land side and a wall on the side adjacent to the cliff. The fort was built between 1666 and 1667. It was built after and in many respects because of the Battle of V√•gen. It is named after King Fredrik III of Norway. The construction stalled and the fortifications decayed. A 1695 inspection of Bergen by Christian V of Denmark‚Äôs son, Christian Gyldenl√∏ve was the impetus which restarted work on the fortifications. By 1706 construction had been completed, albeit in a less complicated layout than originally planned. Fredriksberg served among other things as a place of execution. Katten, the bastion, was also built in 1666 in what today is the Nordnes Park. The Lavette houses were built in 1810 and 1843 as military storages. After the city fire in 1916 they were used as temporary housing. The grounds in front of the Lavette houses were used as a place of execution until the Swedish counterfeiter Jacob Wallin was executed in 1876. The Nordnes Park was built 1888-1898 partly on some of the old fortifications. The fortress has also been part of the Bergen Fire Fighting Service. It was a fire watch station from 1667 and a fire station from 1905 to 1926. Today part of the fort is rented by Nordn√¶s Bataillon‚Äîa social club/buekorps.

Early life and career Born into a noble but poor family, he was destined for a career in the Roman Catholic Church, but soon abandoned his studies in Granada and left for Madrid - where he took law courses. When the French invaded under Napoleon I, at the start of the Peninsular War (1808-1814), Burgos, as one of the afrancesados (supporters of King Joseph I), took up administrative duties in Andalusia. His willingness to collaborate had made him an enemy of the House of Bourbon, and made him leave for Paris in 1812. In France, Burgos completed his academic training by studying the works of the Classics, and started translating the works of Horace into Castilian (a version notably analysed by Andr√©s Bello, who deemed Burgos \\"a poor translator, but an excellent commentator\\"). Much later (1844), Burgos published a revised version, which, although still flawed, has remained a reference - for instance, it is appreciated for its use of the sapphic stanza with free verse. Prominence He returned to Madrid in 1819, and was appointed editor of El Imparcial in 1822 (the paper was a rallying point for moderate liberalism and the afrancesados). During the same period, Burgos showed himself to be a prolific author, writing a publishing a multiple volume work entitled Biograf√≠a universal. He was also integrated in the Bourbon administration of Ferdinand VII, being appointed undersecretary of State in Francisco Cea Berm√∫dez's Ministry. Under the regency of Maria Christina, as the driving force behind the 1833 territorial division of Spain, Burgos used his influence to turn Spain's previous administrative system into a provincial one, advocating for the need of a centralized government. However, his design overtly conflicted with the self-government status held by the Basque districts, especially with Navarre, heavily conditioned but still a free- standing Kingdom. The move was approved in November‚ÄìDecember 1833, the same year he became Home Minister. He was a senator of the Moderado liberals regime established during the reign of Isabella II, as well as a royal counsellor and Interior Minister for the first government of Ram√≥n Mar√≠a Narv√°ez y Campos, Duke of Valencia. His office as Minister was taken over by Narv√°ez's successor, Francisco Javier Ist√∫riz. He also wrote poems marking events such as the death of Mar√≠a Isabel de Braganza and the wedding of Ferdinand VII and Maria Christina, as well as the notable Oda a la Raz√≥n.

In cross- polarized light on left, plane-polarized light on right. In optical mineralogy and petrography, a thin section (or petrographic thin section) is a laboratory preparation of a rock, mineral, soil, pottery, bones, or even metal sample for use with a polarizing petrographic microscope, electron microscope and electron microprobe. A thin sliver of rock is cut from the sample with a diamond saw and ground optically flat. It is then mounted on a glass slide and then ground smooth using progressively finer abrasive grit until the sample is only 30 Œºm thick. The method involved using the Michel-L√©vy interference colour chart. Typically quartz is used as the gauge to determine thickness as it is one of the most abundant minerals. When placed between two polarizing filters set at right angles to each other, the optical properties of the minerals in the thin section alter the colour and intensity of the light as seen by the viewer. As different minerals have different optical properties, most rock forming minerals can be easily identified. Plagioclase for example can be seen in the photo on the right as a clear mineral with multiple parallel twinning planes. The large blue-green minerals are clinopyroxene with some exsolution of orthopyroxene. Thin sections are prepared in order to investigate the optical properties of the minerals in the rock. This work is a part of petrology and helps to reveal the origin and evolution of the parent rock. A photograph of a rock in thin section is often referred to as a photomicrograph. Quartz in thin section Photomicrograph of a thin section of gabbro Photomicrograph of a thin section of a limestone with ooids. The largest is approximately 1.2 mm in diameter. = Description = In thin section, when viewed in plane polarized light (PPL), quartz is colorless with low relief and no cleavage. Its habit is either fairly equant or anhedral if it infills around other minerals as a cement. Under cross polarized light (XPL) quartz displays low interference colors and is usually the defining mineral used to determine if the thin section is at standardized thickness of 30 microns as quartz will only display up to a very pale yellow interference color and no further at that thickness, and it is very common in most rocks so it will likely be available to judge the thickness. = Determining provenance = In thin section, quartz grain provenance in a sedimentary rock can be estimated. In crossed polarized light, the quartz grain can go extinct all at once, called monocrystalline quartz, or in waves, called polycrystalline quartz. The extinction in waves is called undulose extinction and indicates dislocation walls in mineral grains. Dislocation walls are where dislocations, intracrystalline deformation via movement of a dislocation front within a plane, organize themselves into planes of sufficient quantity. They change the crystallographic orientation across the walls, so for example in quartz, the two sides of the wall will have slightly different extinction angles and thus result in undulose extinction. Since undulose extinction requires dislocation walls to have developed, and these occur more easily at higher pressures and temperatures, quartz grains with undulose extinction indicate metamorphic rock provenance for that grain. Those grains that are monocrystalline quartz are more likely to have been formed by igneous processes. Differing sources suggest the extent to which this proxy for provenance can be used. Some note the trend for immature sandstones to have less polycrystalline quartz grains compared to mature sandstones, which have grains that have passed through many sedimentary cycles. Quartz grains derived from previous sedimentary sources are determined by looking for authigenic, or grown in place, overgrowths of silica cement over the grain. = Other distinguishing features = The above descriptions of quartz in thin section is usually enough to identify it. Minerals with similar appearance may include plagioclase, although it can be distinguished by the distinctive twinning in crossed polarized light and cleavage in plane polarized light, and cordierite, although it can be distinguished by twinning or inclusions in the grain. However, for certainty, other distinguishing features of quartz include the fact that it is uniaxial, it has a positive optic sign, length-slow sign of elongation, and zero degree extinction angle. A sigma clast as seen in an ultra thin section. The uneven coloring is an artifact from uneven polishing. Ultra-thin sections Fine- grained rocks, particularly those containing minerals of high birefringence, such as calcite, are sometimes prepared as ultra-thin sections. An ordinary 30 Œºm thin section is prepared as described above but the slice of rock is attached to the glass slide using a soluble cement such as Canada balsam (soluble in ethanol) to allow both sides to be worked on. The section is then polished on both sides using a fine diamond paste until it has a thickness in the range of 2-12 Œºm. This technique has been used to study the microstructure of fine-grained carbonates such as the Lochseitenkalk mylonite in which the matrix grains are less than 5 Œºm in size.Badertscher, N.P. & Burkhard, M. 2000. Brittle¬±ductile deformation in the Glarus thrust Lochseiten (LK) calc- mylonite, Terra Nova, 12, 281-288 This method is also sometimes used in the preparation of mineral and rock specimens for transmission electron microscopy and allows greater accuracy in comparing features using both optical and electron imaging.Barber, D.J. 1981.

The racing classes of this period imposed minimum weight requirements, so steel could be used in place of aluminium without a weight penalty.Ludvigsen, Colin Chapman, p. 178 The most notable feature of the new design was the extensive use of stressed steel panels in the bulkheads, welded steel around the footwell and the instrument panel, a welded sheet of steel surrounding the driver's shoulder, and a double-sided steel cradle surrounding the gearbox. Floors were also welded for additional stiffness. Another clever design feature of the Type 41 was the use of a rear bulkhead as an oil overflow collector. Even the front oil tank had its overflow routed through a labyrinthine path using chassis tubes all the way to the back.

History The club was founded in 1911 to patrol Manly Beach after a law banning daylight swimming was overturned. In 1912 Captain Arthur Holmes, known as \\"Skipper\\" was appointed president of the Manly Life-Saving Club, a position which he held with conspicuous ability for 26 years. During his long term the club rose under his able administration, built up into one of the finest surfing organisations in the State. As a carnival organiser he stood alone, his principal achievement in this direction being the great surfing gala at South Steyne on the occasion of the visit of the Duke of Gloucester. He was organiser and manager of the first surf life- saving team to visit Western Australia. His services were rewarded by being appointed one of the first life-members of the SLSA. He was similarly honoured by the old club, to whose members he had been for years a guide, philosopher and friend. For many years he was also one of the stalwarts of the Manly Amateur Swimming Club. A high proportion of the Surf Life Saving members were soldiers. Skipper had served in the Boer War and during the Great War of 1914-18, Captain Arthur Holmes threw himself enthusiastically into all patriotic efforts. Captain Arthur Holmes was the younger brother of Major General William Holmes (the most senior Australian officer to die in battle in WW1). He was secretary for years of the Voluntary Workers' Association, formed in 1916, to provide homes for disabled soldiers and sailors and their dependants. Arthur Holmes was born in Victoria Barracks, in 1867, one of 12 children, and died in 1943. His grandson, Bruce T M Holmes recalled many fond memories of swimming at Manly as a child. He also said that Bondi had the first Surf Life Saving club in Sydney. There are some lovely old photos in the Club rooms. Cited Louise M Holmes, Skipper's great grand daughter July 2019 The founding President of the club was James Bonner, also then Mayor of Manly. The current club President is actor Tony Bonner, grandson of James Bonner. Manly, Bondi Surf Bathers' Life Saving Club and Bronte Surf Lifesaving Club all have competing claims to be the first in Australia (and the world). Location on South Steyne, the Club operated the Manly Surf Life Saving Pavilion that was designed by Winsome Hall Andrew and completed in 1939; when it was awarded the 1939 Sulman Award for Architecture. The pavilion was demolished in 1990. Life Saving The primary role of the club is to provide surf rescue, first aid and promote water safety on Manly Beach. Since 1911, no lives have been lost on the beach while the club has been on patrol. Competition The club also participates in beach, surf, and ocean competitive sporting activities.

Anatomy D. jubilaei head Skulls of Deuterosaurus are well known from several finds. They were around 80 cm long (2 ft 6 in) with a long snout and conical teeth. Like all anteosaurs, the skull possessed long, dagger-like canine teeth. The skull was rather short for an anteosaur, with a broad cheek region, indicating a very strong bite. The eyes were partly slanted forward, giving it at least partial stereo vision. The pineal eye, though small, had a well formed opening right atop the brain case. Deuterosaurus was a very large animal, the size of a modern grizzly bear. T. H. Huxley mistakenly considered it to be a dinosaur.Huxley, T.H. (1869). \\"Triassic Dinosauria\\" Nature 1: 23-24. With its long tail, it had an adult length of 5‚Äì6 meters (15‚Äì18 ft) and weighted around half a ton. Judging from related therapsids, the short but massive legs were held splayed, much like a modern crocodile. When walking, the tail would have swung sideways, like in modern reptiles. Biology Deuterosaurus is found in what is now Siberia, which in the Permian was dominated by temperate lowlands. Deuterosaurus was among the largest animals of its day, and has variously been interpreted as a herbivore or carnivore. While the large canines may indicate the ability to kill prey, the short legs and massive body would have made it unsuited as a long distance runner, and better suited to eating plants. Then again, the possible stereoscopic vision again indicates an ambush style carnivore, and the rather blunt, cone-like post canine teeth can be interpreted both ways. Possibly Deuterosaurus was omnivorous, like a modern bear. Deuterosaurus, like all its therapsid cousins, probably laid eggs. A remarkable thickening of the skull above the eyes indicates it may have engaged in head-butting, possibly in connection with mating or territorial disputes.

New Brunswick first attempted to become a separate branch of the CAHA in 1953. A second attempt was made in 1967, and after a trial run of one year as its own association, the New Brunswick Amateur Hockey Association separated from the MAHA and became its own branch of the CAHA in 1968.

He was a member of the Roman School of composition, and probably was a pupil of Palestrina. He was active mainly at Rome but moved briefly to Krak√≥w, Poland at the end of his life. Life Records of his early life are inexact, but he was probably born in Naples, and was likely a boy singer at St. John Lateran in 1544 and 1545. An \\"Annibale contralto\\" is also listed at the same church in 1555 and 1556; since it is unlikely that a twenty-year-old would have been listed as a contralto, this may have been a different person; alternatively it has been proposed that Annibale was born in the mid-1540s. Stabile himself mentioned that he studied with Palestrina, who was maestro di cappella at St. John Lateran in 1555 and 1556. Stabile became maestro di cappella at St. John Lateran in 1575, and retained that position until 1578, at which time he moved on to a similar position at the Collegio Germanico. Since Giovanni Dragoni also held the position of maestro di cappella at St. John Lateran, beginning in 1576, the two must have shared the post for two years. In 1582 Stabile was ordained a priest; and in 1590 he changed jobs again, this time becoming maestro di cappella at Santa Maria Maggiore, where he was employed from 1591 to 1594. He went to Poland in early 1595, serving King Sigismund III Vasa, who frequently employed Italian musicians, but Stabile died after being in Krak√≥w only two months. The cause of his death is not indicated, but the journey to Poland was not without risk; the renowned madrigal composer Luca Marenzio also died after a trip to Poland (1599), which he claimed ruined his health. Music Stabile wrote masses, motets, litanies, hymns, and other sacred pieces, in nine separate publications. Two of his collections of masses were first published in Warsaw in 1979, as Msze kr√≥lewskie (Royal Masses), which he wrote for his employer Sigismund III. One of his masses ‚Äî the Missa cantantibus organis ‚Äî is for the unusual combination of 12 independent voices, and was a collaboration with Palestrina and others. Only the Kyrie, Credo and Crucifixus survive from this work. Stabile's style was similar to that of Palestrina, especially in his vocal music; although he normally wrote music somewhat less contrapuntally complex than that of his teacher, he occasionally indulged in canon, especially in his motets. His secular music, mainly madrigals, were often light in character, an unusual feature for a member of the Roman School, whose music was most often noted for its reverence, if not severity. He published three books of madrigals. The second of the three he wrote in collaboration with Giovanni Maria Nanino (1581). All three of these collections were published in Venice, a friendlier environment for publication of light secular music, and the most active center of music publishing in Italy in the late 16th century.

It was subtitled by its author \\"the secret history of Cuba.\\" The novels were written from the mid-1960s through the late 1980s, and indeed, as was recounted in Arenas' autobiography Before Night Falls, were rewritten many times as manuscripts were lost, destroyed and/or confiscated by Cuban authorities. Each of the novels is semi-autobiographical and indeed has Arenas as one, if not more than one, of the major characters. Book One The first volume, Singing from the Well, was originally published as Celestino antes del alba in 1967, the only Arenas novel to be published in Cuba. The book recounts the history of a young child, Celestino, growing up in the province of Oriente, Cuba. Celestino was a child ostracized by his family because of his literary talents. He would write on trees and in retaliation his grandfather denuded the forest. Book Two The second volume, Palace of the White Skunks, focuses on adolescent Fortunato who was raised in a house of frustrated aunts, a primal grandmother, and an emasculated grandfather. Set during the 1959 Cuban Revolution, the novel follows the main character as he clumsily joins the rebels. The acclaimed editor, Thomas Colchie, has written, that in this work, ‚ÄúArenas has created a haunting family portrait, combining the lyrical empathy of a Tennessee Williams toward his characters‚Äô troubled lives with a radically fractured narrative that pays dark tribute less to Faulkner than to the schizophrenia of life under any dictatorial extreme.‚Äù (Colchie 2001) Book Three The Third volume, Farewell to the Sea, is a divided novel, telling the story of a married couple on a six-day vacation on the Cuban coast. The first half is a prosaic stream of consciousness narrative of the troubled wife demonstrating her love and inability to understand her husband, Hector. The last half of the novel is composed of six poetic cantos sung in silence to the sea by Hector, a poet who is no longer allowed to write and who has been compelled to enter into a sham marriage to avoid the charge of homosexuality. It is a story of a marriage of two people who, while sharing genuine affection, are so different and incompatible that they not only cannot communicate, they fail to speak in the same terms, one in prose and the other in poetry. Book Four In the fourth volume, The Color of Summer, Arenas appears as three characters: Gabriel, the dutiful \\"straight\\" son; Reinaldo, the expatriate author; and Skunk in a Funk, the \\"picaro\\" ‚Äì faggot ‚Äì who seeks merely to live and work as an artist in Castro‚Äôs Cuba while engaging in anonymous sex. The novel is set in a carnival celebrating the 50th anniversary of the revolution and breaks many, if not all of the norms of narrative story telling (the \\"Foreword\\" appears on page 252). In that foreword, Arenas states that the novel is a \\"grotesque and satirical (and therefore realistic) portrait of an aging tyranny and the tyrant himself...\\" He adds that the novel ‚Äúis not a linear work, but circular, and therefore cyclonic, with a vortex or eye ‚Äì the Carnival ‚Äì towards which all vectors whirl.\\" Book Five The fifth and final volume, The Assault, is a dark and Kafkaesque vision of a future Cuba, where homosexuality is punishable by death, told by a repressed homosexual turned government agent for the \\"Bureau of Counterwhispering\\" as he searches to destroy all whispers, homosexuals, dissidents and most particularly his own mother. Overview Writing about the entire Pentagonia, Arenas wrote, in the foreword to The Color of Summer: > In all of these novels, the central character is an author, a witness, who > dies but in the next novel is reborn under a different name yet with the > same angry rebellious goal: to chant or recount the horror and the life of > the people, including his own. There thus remains, in the midst of a > terrible, tempestuous time, a life raft, a ship of hope, the intransigence > of man the creator, the poet, the rebel ‚Äìstanding firm before all those > repressive principals which, if they could, would destroy him utterly ‚Äì one > of those principals being the horror that he himself exudes.

It is located at the intersection of Massachusetts Avenue and Huntington Avenue. Symphony is the outermost underground station on the \\"E\\" branch; after leaving Symphony, outbound trolleys emerge onto the surface and continue down the median of Huntington Avenue. Symphony station is named after the nearby Symphony Hall. This station is not fully accessible; planned but currently unfunded renovations would make the station fully accessible. History An outbound train at the brand-new station in 1941 A 1960 plan of Symphony station showing the wide track separation, sub-passage, and the original stair configuration =Opening= The station opened February 16, 1941 as part of the Huntington Avenue tunnel, which was a Works Progress Administration project that eliminated streetcars from Boylston Street and Copley Square in order to ease congestion. The tunnel ran from just west of Copley to just east of Opera Place, with intermediate stations near the major performance halls at Mechanics and Symphony. =Modifications= Unusually for subway stations, the inbound and outbound tracks of the station are widely separated. The Huntington Avenue underpass was constructed at the same time as the station, with lanes for motor vehicles passing under Massachusetts Avenue at track level between the inbound and outbound platforms of the station. A sub-passage connected the two platforms; it was sealed off in the early 1960s when the MTA converted the station to no longer need employees present. Each platform had two entrance/exit stairways on opposite sides of Massachusetts Avenue, each of which split into a pair of stairways to street level. In August 1978, the MBTA board authorized $91,750 for new glass entrance shelters for the station. Around that time, as part of the construction of the Symphony Plaza Towers, the stairways serving the inbound side were realigned, with each stairway from the station connecting to a single angled surface stairway rather than the original two. From January 3, 1981 to June 1982, the station was closed due to budget cuts. (second page) Moderate renovations were performed to the station in the early 1990s which included new tiling and improved lighting. =Fare control= Since their construction, Symphony and Prudential were the only two underground stops on the Green Line where riders paid upon boarding the train rather than when entering the station. In May 2006, the MBTA installed the CharlieCard electronic fare collection system at the two stations, making them fare- controlled like the rest of the system. Passengers now pay with their CharlieCard or CharlieTicket at platform level when entering the station, and can board at any door to the train. =Planned renovations= Symphony is one of a small number of MBTA subway stations - along with , , and - which are not accessible. Renovations are planned as part of the Light Rail Accessibility Project which would make Symphony station fully accessible. The renovations will include two elevators to each platform, platform modifications, and changes to other station elements to meet Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 specifications. Planning proved difficult due to the number of historic structures in the area, as well as utility and code issues. Design reached 15% (conceptual) level in September 2011. Plans presented in July 2017 would involve the addition of emergency exits and restrooms as well as the accessibility renovations. The MBTA issued a $6 million design contract in August 2019. , design work is expected to be completed in early 2021, with construction beginning soon after.

This story introduces Uhtred Ragnarson, born a Saxon then kidnapped by raiding Danes who raise him from age 11,Uhtred of Bebbanburg teaching him how to be a warrior. Plot summary Nine-year-old Osbert is the second son of Ealdorman (Earl) Uhtred, Lord of Bebbanburg in Northumbria. Danes raid Bebbanburg, and Ealdorman Uhtred's first son, also called Uhtred, is killed while scouting the raiders. Ealdorman Uhtred renames Osbert Uhtred. Ealdorman Uhtred is killed during a disastrous attack on Danish-seized Eoferwic (York) and his son is captured by Danish Jarl Ragnar the Fearless. Ragnar, amused by the boy's bravery during the battle, keeps him as a thrall. Uhtred's uncle, √Ülfric, takes Bebbanburg and usurps the title of ealdorman from Uhtred, the rightful heir. Uhtred befriends Ragnar's youngest son, Rorik, and has many clashes with one boy in particular, Sven, son of Kjartan, one of Ragnar's shipmasters. One day, Sven kidnaps Ragnar's daughter, Thyra, and removes part of her clothing in an effort to sexually assault her. Uhtred charges Sven from hiding, taking Sven's sword and attacking him with it. Uhtred, Rorik, and Thyra escape back to Ragnar's hall. Ragnar dismisses Kjartan from his service when Kjartan makes light of his son's behaviour. He also crushes one of Sven's eyes with the hilt of his sword - adding darkly that he would have crushed both, had Sven stripped Thyra completely naked. Uhtred then goes viking across East Anglia, and participates in the conquests of Mercia and East Anglia, and the invasion of Wessex. He is kidnapped by a priest, Beocca, an old family friend. He then escapes from Wessex and rejoins Ragnar. Uhtred enjoys life with the Danes, but flees after Kjartan and his men set fire to Ragnar's hall and kill everyone who tries to flee. Ragnar remains inside, preferring to die on his terms rather than at Kjartan's hands. Kjartan abducts Thyra. Uhtred hopes to escape Kjartan's assassins by spreading the rumour that he too died in the hall-burning. Uhtred then joins King Alfred in Wessex. There he learns to read and write, and sails with Alfred's fleet of 12 ships against the Danes. After a battle with the Danes, he meets Ragnar the Younger, Earl Ragnar's eldest son, and tells him how his father died and that Thyra was kidnapped. They part friends, swearing that one day they will band together to take revenge on Kjartan and rescue Thyra. Seeking to take command of the fleet, Uhtred gains it on the condition that he marry the orphaned Wessex girl Mildrith. He is not told that, by marrying her, he will also assume her family's very large debt to the Church. Afterward, he takes part in a siege against Guthrum, and is among a group of hostages exchanged when the Danes and Saxons make peace. Staying with the Danes in the city over the winter, he again meets Ragnar, who saves him from death when Guthrum breaks the peace and murders the other Saxon hostages. Uhtred then escapes to find his wife. She was taken by Odda the Younger, another Wessex ealdorman, to the north. There he fights in the Battle of Cynwit, where Uhtred kills the renowned Danish leader, Ubba Lothbrokson, in single combat. The novel concludes with Uhtred riding with his men to Exanceaster to find his wife and newborn son, instead of going directly to inform Alfred of his victory.

Early life and education Harry Lord was born in Porter, Maine on March 8, 1882, and graduated from Bates College in 1908. Lord was 25 years old when he began to play professionally in September 25, 1907, with the Boston Americans. Harry Lord was a third baseman for eleven years (1906‚Äì1915), one in college (1905), nine in the majors (1907‚Äì1915) and two in the minors (1906‚Äì1907).Baseball Almanac His first professional engagement was at Kezar Falls, Maine. He attended Bates College, where he graduated in 1908 and pitched for the baseball team.  Professional baseball career  = Eastern league = He broke into Organized Baseball at age 24 in 1906, with Worcester in the New England League and the next year moved up to Providence in the Eastern League. His performance there caught the attention of the Boston Americans and, at 26 years of age, he began playing professionally on September 25, 1907, for Boston. He played for with the team for three years. On May 30, 1908, Washington Senators's Jerry Freeman's single was the only hit allowed by Boston's Cy Young. Lord had four hits to back Cy's pitching. On April 21, 1909, Lord stole home on the front end of a triple steal in the bottom of the seventh, with Tris Speaker taking third and Doc Gessler taking second. The Sox won the game, 6-2. On June 30, 1910, the Philadelphia Athletics held a benefit for the widow and children of Mike \\"Doc\\" Powers, who had died a few days after the team opened Shibe Park in 1909. Players from the Washington, New York and Boston AL teams took part in a six-inning game against the A's, and also in pre-game contests before 12,000 fans. In one of these contests Lord was timed from home to first in 3.4 seconds.  The Red Sox (July 10, 1910 ‚Äì August 9, 1910)  When on July 10, 1910, a Walter Johnson fastball broke Lord's finger, the stellar play of his substitute Clyde Engle made Lord expendable. In 1910, the Red Sox fielded ten men who had been or would become MLB managers ‚Äì no other team in history as ever had more. Lord was joined in this feat by Bill Carrigan, Gavvy Cravath, Doc Gessler, Deacon McGuire, Tris Speaker, Jake Stahl, Bob Unglaub, Heinie Wagner, and Cy Young.  Chicago White Sox (August 9, 1910 ‚Äì May 18, 1914)  He was traded to the Chicago White Sox on August 9, 1910, with Amby McConnell to the Chicago White Sox for Frank Smith, and Billy Purtell. In 1911, while playing in Major League Baseball, he had 180 Hits, 103 Runs, 18 Doubles, 18 Triples, 3 Home Runs, 61 RBI and 43 Stolen Bases at (.321/.364/.433) in 141 Games. On May 8, 1912, the White Sox beat the Washington Senators 7‚Äì6, ending Walter Johnson's five-game win streak; Johnson gave up two 2-run home runs, one to Lord in the first and another to Ping Bodie in the fifth. He played for the Pale Hose until 1914 but then got into a salary squabble with owner Charlie Comiskey. He held out on the Sox, returning for a few games only to demand his release, and disappeared again when Comiskey turned him down. = Federal League =  Buffalo Buffeds (1914‚Äì1915)  In 1915, the Buffalo Buffeds of the Federal League announced they had signed Lord. When he reported to Chicago in 1914, he was blacklisted by mutual consent of the American and National League owners. For the 1915 season, the Buffalo team changed its name from the Buffeds to the Blues. Manager Larry Schlafly, was fired form his position June 4. He was replaced temporarily by catcher Walter Blair and then by Lord, who had joined the Blues only eight days before. Buffalo star Hal Chase and Lord were business associates and close friends. Once the managerial change was made, Chase, who had been slumping under Schafly, suddenly came to life. He batted .328 for the remainder of the 1915 season and led the Federal League in home runs with 17. Lord and Chase took them from the cellar to sixth place with a (59-48) record. When the Federal League folded, Lord was still blacklisted in the remaining Major Leagues. Lord played his last MLB game on September 27, 1915 at age 33.  Life after baseball  He managed several minor league teams, ending his baseball career in 1925 at age 43. At times, Lord inspired his teammates with his hustle, earning him the White Sox captaincy; at other times, it seemed he didn't want to play. The two years he batted more than .310 (1909 and 1911), he followed with marks of .267. In 1913, he set single- season American League records for fewest chances accepted (364) and fewest assists (221) by a third baseman in 150 or more games. After managing in the minors, he entered a number of business ventures in Portland, Maine. His hobbies were \\"my son and my daughter\\".  Death and legacy  He died at age 66 on August 9, 1948 in Hospital in Westbrook, Maine, where he had been the last four months of his life and is buried at Riverside Cemetery in Kezar Falls. Surviving him were his wife, his daughter and his son. = Overall record = Overall in MLB, he had 1,024 Hits, 506 Runs, 107 Doubles, 70 Triples, 14 Home Runs, 294 RBI and 206 Stolen Bases at (.277/.326/.356) in 972 Games.

The genus Cypripedium is one of the five genera in the sub-family Cypripedioideae, commonly known as lady's slipper orchids. First described in 1789 by Scottish botanist William Aiton, C. acaule is commonly referred to as the pink lady's slipper, stemless lady's-slipper, or moccasin flower. The pink lady's slipper is the provincial flower of Prince Edward Island, Canada, and the state wildflower of New Hampshire, United States. Its close relative, Cypripedium reginae, is the state flower of Minnesota.  Description  Unlike most other species of Cypripedium, the pouch of C. acaule opens in a slit that runs down the front of the labellum rather than a round opening. The plant consists of two plicate leaves near the ground. From between those leaves sprouts a long, pubescent stalk that bears a single pink flower. The sepals and petals tend to be yellowish-brown to maroon with a large pouch that is usually some shade of pink but can be nearly magenta. The white pouched- green petaled forma alba can occasionally be found mixed in with normal populations.  Cultivation  Cypripedium acaule var. alba Seed germination labs have increased the commercial availability of C. acaule, although it still tends to be less commonly available than other Cypripedium species and hybrids. This is primarily due to the extra care that must be provided if the growing site is not naturally suitable for in-ground cultivation. This plant grows in soils below a pH of 5, often at 4‚Äì4.5. At this high acidity soil fungus is suppressed, and C. acaule can thrive. There is even evidence that it is partially myco-heterotrophic, parasitizing fungus that attempts to invade its roots. However, in soils above pH 5, soil microbes become more than C. acaule can manage, and the plants rot. Seedlings germinated in a sterile environment can grow and thrive in a much higher pH than 5, but must be grown below 5 if removed from the sterility. For artificial cultivation, container culture is a must, and the growing medium must be naturally acidic. Additionally, all other soil additives must be devoid of any calcium that could buffer the pH to above 5. High quality peat moss or pine duff work well, and pH neutral perlite can be added to improve porosity. Due to the risk of calcium bicarbonate, tap water is unsuitable. Rainwater or distilled water mixed with of vinegar per gallon will assure that a reliably high acidity is maintained in the growing medium. Give bright dappled shade or morning sun. Sink pots in winter or store in a cold frame for insulation. Given these conditions, C. acaule can thrive indefinitely, but it will always require much more maintenance than other species/hybrids that can be grown in a wider pH range. A drawing published in Curtis's Botanical Magazine in 1793 Range Cypripedium acaule can be found in the eastern third of the United States, particularly in the Great Lakes Region and the Northeast in New Hampshire and Maine, south along the Appalachians to Alabama. It is widespread in Canada, where it is found in every province except British Columbia. It also occurs in the Northwest Territories and in St. Pierre & Miquelon. Within its geographic range, it can be found in a wide variety of environments, from coastal plains, to pine barrens, to mountaintops. Habitat C. acaule requires highly acidic soil but tolerates a range of shade and moisture, though it prefers at least partial shade and well-drained slopes. It is usually found in pine forests, where it can be seen in large colonies, but it also grows in deciduous woods. It was long speculated that a fungus association was needed for growth, and that C. acaule could not be artificially cultivated outside of these associations. However, a greater understanding of orchids in general has shown that this association is only needed to germinate orchid seeds and is not required once plants begin making true leaves. Frequency This species is common in parts of the northern United States and adjoining provinces of Canada, but it is considered endangered in Illinois and Tennessee, Vulnerable in New York, and Unusual in Georgia.

He collected and catalogued numerous Australian plant species, and participated in a number of exploring expeditions. He was a member of the Stirling expedition of 1827, and his report on the quality of the soil was instrumental in the decision to establish the Swan River Colony. Early life and army career Charles Fraser was born in Blair Atholl, Perthshire, Scotland in 1788. He worked as a gardener, probably for the extensive estates of the landlord, the Duke of Atholl, and subsequently had connections with the botanic gardens of Edinburgh and Glasgow.Davies G (2002). \\"Fraser (Frazer or Frazier), Charles\\". In: Aitken R, Looker M (editors) (2002). Oxford Companion to Australian Gardens. South Melbourne: Oxford University Press. p. 234. He enlisted as a soldier in the 56th Regiment on 8 June 1815, and served in the East Indies before arriving in Sydney on board the convict ship Guildford on 8 April 1816. There, his skills as a horticulturalist were recognised, and he was appointed superintendent of the Royal Botanic Gardens, a position that he would hold until his death. In November 1816, Fraser was transferred to the 46th Regiment. He again transferred regiments in August 1817, this time to the 48th Regiment of Foot. On 6 January 1821, Fraser was discharged from the army and formally appointed Colonial Botanist, a position that he had been holding informally at least since 1819. Over the subsequent decade, he organised the development of Sydney Botanic Gardens from the governors‚Äô kitchen garden to a world-renowned botanic garden, receiving and sending plants and seeds to all the major horticultural centres as well as to penal settlements and major gardens in New South Wales. Explorations From 1817, Fraser travelled extensively as a field collector. He was a member of three of John Oxley's expeditions: his 1817 expedition to the Lachlan River and Bathurst, his 1818 expedition into north-eastern New South Wales, and his 1819 expedition in the areas of Port Macquarie and Hastings River. He visited Tasmania in 1820, and in 1826 visited Tasmania, New Zealand and Norfolk Island. =Swan River expedition= Early in 1827 Fraser was appointed to accompany Captain (later Admiral Sir) James Stirling on the Swan River expedition of 1827, an expedition to explore the Swan River on the west coast of Australia, and assess its suitability as a site for a new British settlement. The expedition arrived in the area on board on 4 March. After surveying the coastal waters off the Swan, Stirling and Fraser briefly reconnoitred the lower reaches of the River on the 7th. The following day, Stirling led a party of 18 men in two boats, in exploring up the Swan River. With Stirling and Frederick Garling, Fraser climbed Mount Eliza, becoming the first Europeans to do so. At the present-day site of Perth, Stirling named a feature near Heirisson Island Point Fraser in Fraser's honour, and about a mile upstream Fraser discovered a fresh water brook and lagoon that were named Clause's Brook and Clause's Lagoon respectively, in honour of fellow explorer Frederick Clause. The party camped at Clause's Brook, and the following morning three Noongars approached Fraser while he was alone in the camp, angrily gesturing for him to leave. By 14 March the party had traced the Swan River to its junction with Ellen Brook, where the boats could go no further. Stirling then split the party into three groups, each to explore in a different direction. Fraser's group was sent in an eastward direction, where they discovered \\"many curious and interesting Botanical specimens and a lump of granite from the ridge\\". Each group having returned to the junction of the Swan with Ellen Brook, the party returned down the Swan River, arriving back at the ship on the 18th. At the conclusion of the expedition, Fraser wrote a glowing report of the quality of the soil in the area. The report, which Statham-Drew has described as \\"euphoric\\", states: \\"In giving my opinion of the Land seen on the Banks of Swan River, I hesitate not in pronouncing it superior to any I ever saw in New South Wales east of the Blue Mountains....\\" Together with Stirling's effusive report on the naval, strategic and geological qualities of the area, the reports were instrumental in convincing the British Colonial Office to establish the Swan River Colony, and provided impetus to the period of excessively favorable publicity that has been labelled \\"Swan River mania\\". In reality the soils of the area are quite poor, and Fraser would later be heavily criticised for the inaccuracy of his report. Analyses of the expedition reports has shown that the party explored only within the narrow strip of rich alluvial soil that occurs near the Swan River, and thus they were unaware of the infertile grey sand that constitutes most of the sand plain. It has also been argued that Fraser's assessment of the fertility of the soil would have been influenced by the greenness and apparent health of the native plants, a method that would have had some validity in England, but has little validity in Australia where the vast majority of plants are adapted to dry, infertile soils. Finally, Appleyard (1979) speculates that \\"the question must be asked: had the persuasive Stirling unduly influenced - not maliciously but seductively by his boundless enthusiasm - Charles Fraser to pen words that did little credit to his professional and administrative standing?\\" Fraser was to bear most of the blame with the Swan River colonists for the misinformation that they received. In a thinly veiled attack on Fraser, Eliza Shaw wrote \\"that man who reported this land to be good deserves hanging nine times over\\". A naval officer stationed at the Swan River wrote that Fraser's report was so \\"highly coloured\\" that it was inevitable that people coming to the colony would be disappointed. John Morgan indirectly criticised Fraser with his comment that botanists are no more capable of assessing land for farming purposes than farmers are capable of discussing \\"the merits and character of an extraordinary shrub\\". Finally, in December 1832, Robert Lyon wrote of the \\"unpardonable sin of Fraser\\": that he did not state the extent of good land in the area. =Later expeditions= In 1828, Fraser accompanied Allan Cunningham on an expedition that connected the Moreton Bay settlement with the Darling Downs, via Cunninghams Gap. Later that year he was sent by the Governor to collect plants and establish a public garden at Brisbane. He also undertook many collecting trips to Van Diemen‚Äôs Land and Norfolk Island. Death and legacy Charles Fraser died on 22 December 1831. He had collected and catalogued hundreds of Australian plants. According to Hall (1978), more than thirty plant species were named after him, including species in the genera Acacia, Boronia, Allocasuarina, Dysoxylum, Dryandra, Ficus, Hakea, Lomatia, Marsdenia, Persoonia, Sophora and Swainsona. His specimens are now principally in the herbaria at Kew; the Natural History Museum, London; the Oxford University Druce-Fielding Collection; and some have returned to the Royal Botanic Garden Sydney Herbarium.Davies G, Carwardine C (1998). \\"Charles Fraser: plant collector and first colonial botanist\\".

History P4, number 17 is a P8 and the car a top left of the photo is a P6. A close up of the Bowin P6 suspension The car company was founded by John Vincent Joyce (1938‚Äì2002), a successful designer and builder of racing cars and in later years gas appliances incorporating Low NOx Technology. Joyce travelled to England and joined Team Lotus as a Project Engineer, later to become the company's Chief Development Engineer during the mid to late 1960s. While at Lotus Cars, his responsibilities included design and development of all aspects of formula racing, Indianapolis 500, sports, rally, and high performance road cars. His projects at Lotus included the Europa road car, as well as the Type 40 and Type 41 racers. On return to Australia in 1968, he started his own company, Bowin Designs Pty. Ltd., which designed and built racing cars for sale in Australia. Fifty-six cars were built in total between 1968 and 1976. During this period, he carried out several projects for Ford Motor Company and Leyland Motors on suspension design, to improve roadholding of Ford Falcon, Ford Escort and Leyland Marina cars. John Joyce talking to champion Australian racing driver John Leffler Approximately ten racing cars were sold for export to Canada, New Zealand and South East Asia. Bowin Cars have raced successfully in these countries as well as Europe. Bowin Cars are best remembered for dominating the Australian Formula Ford scene with 16 podium finishes from 1970 - 1983. It took the UK car maker, Van Diemen until 1993 to surpass Bowin's all-time Australian Formula Ford ranking. Bowin Cars still stand as the best Australian built Formula Ford, winning a total of four Australian Formula Ford \\"Driver to Europe\\" Series in 1972, 1974, 1976, 1978. The company also built and competed in the Formula 2 & Formula 5000 class, however, the cars were never able to achieve the same success as it had in Formula Ford. A number of these cars can still be seen racing successfully in Australia today. John Joyce designing his next racing car. Taken in the early 1970s In 1976, when the demand for racing cars declined in Australia, the company changed its core business, branching out into making a wide variety of home appliance products from a new type of industrial cookers called the set n forget cooker to railway lighting systems. In the early 1980s, the company concentrated its design, engineering and entrepreneurial expertise on developing a range of gas appliance products for domestic, institutional and light commercial markets world wide. In 1985 a modern gas appliance manufacturing facility was built replacing the old car factory site. During this time the company won a contract to supply gas- heating systems to government schools in Australia with a gas burner designed to reduce emission and improve air quality called the LO-NOx burner. Joyce died of a heart attack in June 2002 and is survived by his wife Pam and three sons.

The squadron was formed in 1940 and saw action as a bomber squadron during World War II serving in the Pacific theatre against the Japanese, and undertaking operations during the Battle of Rabaul, and the New Guinea, New Britain and Borneo campaigns. The squadron was disbanded in 1946 following the conclusion of hostilities, but was re-formed in 1951. From then until 2010 the squadron was an RAAF Reserve squadron located near Adelaide, South Australia; for part of this time, until 1960, the squadron continued to perform flying duties, before converting to a ground support role. In 2010, the squadron combined with Combat Support Unit Edinburgh to become a Permanent Air Force unit and it currently forms part of No. 96 Wing, Combat Support Group. History =World War II= No. 24 Squadron was formed as a general purpose squadron at RAAF Base Amberley on 17 June 1940. With an initial strength of four CAC Wirraway aircraft, it was subsequently re-equipped with Lockheed Hudsons in the second half of 1940. Tasked with patrolling Australia's northern approaches in search of German raiders and submarines, while it also undertook a range of training activities over the following months. The squadron moved to Townsville in October where it undertook coastal patrol and training flights operating a mix of Wirraway and Hudsons, as well as de Havilland Moth Minor trainers. In early December 1941, No. 24 Squadron moved to Rabaul under the command of Wing Commander John Lerew. Following the outbreak of war in the Pacific, Rabaul came under Japanese attack on a number of occasions, but flying operations continued until 20 February 1942 when over 100 Japanese aircraft attacked Rabaul, destroying five of No. 24 Squadron's eight obsolete Wirraways (all of which had taken off to intercept the raiding force). With the squadron reduced to just three aircraft orders to attack the approaching Japanese invasion force were cancelled and the squadron was withdrawn to Townsville. The heavily outnumbered Australian Army garrison at Rabaul was later overwhelmed in the Battle of Rabaul. A No. 24 Squadron B-24J during a combat mission No. 24 Squadron moved to Bankstown, New South Wales, in July 1942 where it performed training, anti-submarine and air defence patrols using a diverse assortment of aircraft. The squadron continued in this role until May 1943 when it began converting to a dive bomber squadron equipped with Vultee Vengeance aircraft. After completing its training on the Vengeance No. 24 Squadron deployed to New Guinea in August 1943 operating from Nadzab where it provided support to Australian Army and United States Marine Corps units in New Guinea and New Britain, supporting operations on the Huon Peninsula, around Shaggy Ridge and Cape Gloucester. The squadron continued in this role until March 1944, when the Vengeance was withdrawn from operational service. In March 1944, No. 24 Squadron was withdrawn to Australia to begin preparations to convert to the heavy bomber role equipped with Consolidated B-24 Liberator aircraft. The squadron was assigned to No. 82 Wing RAAF and flew its first combat sorties with these new aircraft in September 1944. Operating from bases in the Northern Territory the squadron continued to fly bombing and anti-shipping strikes against Japanese forces in the Netherlands East Indies. A detachment deployed to Palawan, in the Philippines, and later in the war, the squadron deployed to Morotai Island and then Balikpapan to support Operation Oboe. Following the Japanese surrender No. 24 Squadron was used to ferry liberated Australian prisoners of war home before being disbanded at RAAF Station Tocumwal on 15 May 1946. =Post-war= No. 24 Squadron was re-formed at Mallala, South Australia as a Citizens Air Force (reserve) fighter squadron on 30 April 1951. The squadron was allocated a fighter role, and was equipped with P-51 Mustang fighters and Wirraway training aircraft, being the only CAF squadron to operate Mustangs for the entire post-war period with all others operating jet aircraft. The squadron later received a number of Tiger Moths and Winjeels and undertook a range of training and exercises, often on weekends, as well as training cadet pilots. During this period the squadron lost two pilots killed in separate incidents in 1957. On 1 March 1960 the squadron became an RAAF (Auxiliary) unit, with the squadron moving to a temporary base in North Adelaide. Meanwhile, in May two Vampire jet aircraft became available to the unit. However, in June 1960 the squadron ceased operations as a flying squadron, following a reorganisation of the CAF. Since this date No. 24 Squadron has been a non- flying RAAF Reserve squadron based at RAAF Base Edinburgh near Adelaide. The squadron was affiliated with No. 1 Squadron based at Amberley, Queensland and trained on maintaining the Canberra bomber. Following the transfer of No. 11 Squadron to Edinburgh in 1968, the unit was affiliated with that unit, retraining on servicing the Lockheed P-3 Orion. In 1977 the Squadron change affiliation again, this time to No. 92 Wing and its personnel continued to work on the Orions. On 28 May 1979, the squadron received the Freedom of Entry to the City of Adelaide. The Freedom Scroll was presented at a ceremonial parade by the Lord Mayor, The Right Honourable Mr George Joseph. In 1981 No. 24 Squadron affiliated with RAAF Base Edinburgh, supporting the flying and base units posted there. In 2010, the squadron combined with Combat Support Unit Edinburgh to once again become a Permanent Air Force unit; it forms part of No. 96 Wing.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 5, 2006. In \\"Married to the Blob\\", Homer eats green extraterrestrial slime and morphs into a rampaging blob with an insatiable appetite; in \\"You Gotta Know When to Golem\\", Bart uses Krusty's golem to wreak havoc on his tormentors; and in \\"The Day the Earth Looked Stupid\\", the residents of an early-1930s Springfield refuse to believe news of an actual alien invasion after being duped by Orson Welles's War of the Worlds radio broadcast. It was written by Peter Gaffney and directed by David Silverman and Matthew C. Faughnan. Dr. Phil and Sir Mix-a-Lot guest star as themselves, Richard Lewis and Fran Drescher guest voice as the male and female Golems, respectively. In its original run, the episode received 10.43 million viewers.Ratings Plot The episode begins with a parody of Tales from the Crypt, with Mr. Burns as the Crypt Keeper. The scene begins in a dungeon room, where a crypt opens, and after several waves of rats, snakes, spiders and rabbits crawl out of a coffin, the Cryptkeeper sits up in it. He proclaims himself to be the master of \\"scare-amonies\\" to the delight of zombie Smithers. A bound Moe interrupts in protest and is killed in an iron maiden, his blood spilling onto the floor and spelling out \\"Treehouse of Horror XVII\\". Moe himself takes delight in this and proclaims \\"A Ho Ho! Look at that, my blood is a genius! Fancy Roman numerals and everything!\\" =Married to the Blob= In a parody of The Blob, as Homer and Marge make out in the backyard, a meteorite falls nearby, burning off the top of Marge's hair in the process. It cracks open to reveal a green gooey substance that resembles a burning marshmallow. Homer, despite his family's objections (and the goo's attempts to flee), puts it on a stick and devours it. Later that night, his stomach rumbles from hunger, and Homer eats all the available food. He also eats Snowball V and then he attempts to eat Bart, but is stopped by Marge. Homer then becomes obese, and eats a teenager in an attempt to \\"savor\\" him from the flames of a barbecue fire. Homer then slowly mutates into a giant blob monster, rampaging through Springfield while eating all the overweight people he can find. Homer snacks on bus passengers as if they were candies and decapitates Ned Flanders. Dr. Phil McGraw shows up with the Simpson family and tells Homer to stop for their sakes. Homer ends his rampaging for fear of losing Marge and vows to use his insatiable appetite for more constructive purposes (he eats Dr. Phil anyway; his last words are \\"Food does not equal love!\\" before he digests into nothingness). Mayor Quimby later dedicates a new homeless shelter. The homeless people enter the shelter, only to find themselves inside Homer's stomach. =You Gotta Know When to Golem= Fran Drescher guest stars as the female Golem In a parody of The Golem, at the end of an episode of Krusty's show, Bart goes backstage to complain about an acid- spraying Krusty brand alarm clock. There he finds the Golem of Prague, a creature from Jewish mythology. Krusty tells Bart that in the 17th century, the Golem was sculpted out of clay by a powerful rabbi and would obey any command written on a scroll and placed in his mouth. Although the golem was created ostensibly to protect Jewish villages, he would obey any scroll placed in his mouth, evil or good. He had been passed down through many generations and now works for Krusty (primarily to deal with hecklers). Bart steals the Golem by writing a command for him to come to his home at midnight. At midnight, the Golem shows up at the Simpsons' house. From then on, Bart uses him to carry out his commands: swinging Principal Skinner up and down like a yo-yo until he splits in half, and kicking Homer's walls (the result of a misunderstanding, as the Golem cannot read Bart's handwriting). Lisa thinks the Golem does not like doing the biddings of others and feeds him a scroll reading \\"Speak\\". The Golem (voiced by Richard Lewis) attempts to roar, then coughs, and reveals that he is a decent being who feels guilty about being used to commit heinous acts, and then he throws up excessive scrolls, one of which reads \\"Kill the Czar\\". To make him feel better, the Simpsons create a female Golem (voiced by Fran Drescher) out of Play-Doh. The two are married by Rabbi Hyman Krustofski and the female Golem convinces Chief Wiggum not to press charges on Skinner's murder with the promise of pan-fried latkes, a Jewish delicacy (though she only gets to the words \\"pan fried\\" before Wiggum agrees). =The Day the Earth Looked Stupid= The population of Springfield are fooled by Orson Welles' infamous The War of the Worlds 1938 radio broadcast and believe the world has been invaded. Mass panic breaks out, and the citizens begin rioting. Marge voices her belief that the Martians will only destroy humans, so Sideshow Mel suggests they foil the aliens by cavorting naked in the mud like animals. They do this until the following day, when Lisa tells the citizens that it was all a hoax. Angry at being fooled, the citizens of Springfield vow to never fall for such a trick again. Meanwhile, Kang and Kodos, observing the entire event from their orbiting spaceship, decide this is the perfect time for a real invasion, and begin destroying what is left of the town. True to their word, the town does not believe that it is a real invasion and ignores it. Orson Welles comes to Springfield and admits it is not a staged act, but is unable to rouse the disbelieving citizens. The segment ends by jumping forward to three years later, with Kang and Kodos looking over the ruins of occupied Springfield and mulling on what went wrong and why they were not greeted as liberators, as they planned the invasion to rid Earth of \\"weapons of mass disintegration\\" which they refer to as \\"Operation Enduring Occupation\\" (in a reference to the 2003 invasion of Iraq). The segment ends with the camera pulling away from the smoking ruins of what was once Springfield, as the song \\"I Don't Want to Set the World on Fire\\" by The Ink Spots plays. Production \\"The Day the Earth Looked Stupid\\" was originally supposed to end with Kang and Kodos making a direct reference to the Iraq War as they observe the ruined remains of 1938 Springfield. While the Fox censors had no objections over the line, the producers and writers felt the reference was too obvious and had it cut to make the joke more subtle (though the leaked Internet version has the line that ended up being cut). Once again Maurice LaMarche voiced Orson Welles, doing his impression of Welles used earlier for The Brain on Animaniacs and Pinky and the Brain. At the end of the episode Al Jean is credited as \\"Al July 27, 2007 Jean\\" predicting the release date for the then in production and upcoming Simpsons Movie. Reception \\"Treehouse of Horror XVII\\" received mixed to positive reviews from television critics. The episode was declared by Matt Zoller Seitz of New York magazine as being one of nine later Simpsons episodes that was as good as the show's classic era. Dan Iverson of IGN gave the episode a score of 7.6/10, commenting \\"...The dialogue was really quite good - even if the stories weren't the best (and in comparison, they were better than the past four years of Treehouse episodes)... And in typical Simpsons fashion the celebrity appearances were hysterical\\", concluding \\"We can totally overlook any other issues the episode had and recommend the episode to anybody who likes random comedy\\". In the article 'You said we'd be greeted as liberators!': 10 anxiety-reflecting Simpsons Halloween segments, The A.V. Club singled out The Day The Earth Looked Stupid, noting that while \\"the show was awfully quiet during the darkest days of the Bush presidency‚Äîwhich is even more surprising how blatantly left it had been in the past...the show nearly made up for it with its most political‚Äîand bleakest‚ÄîTreehouse segment ever\\", concluding \\"The Day The Earth Looked Stupid was The Simpsons at its most pointed\\". When listing the 66 segments of the first 22 Treehouse of Horror episodes in order from worst to best, Joshua Kurp of Splitsider gave this episode's segments (in order of appearance) rankings of #52, #47, and #59.

Previously he was a member of the Colorado House of Representatives from 2000 to 2007.Ballotpedia. David Schultheis. Viewed: 2017-01-29.  Biography  Schultheis has lived in Colorado Springs, Colorado since 1992, before which he lived in California. He is known for his conservative views, particularly regarding education and illegal immigration to the United States. He has been married to his wife, Sandra, for 42 years and has two daughters and five grandsons. Schultheis is an Eagle Scout.  Legislative career  Schultheis is a strong opponent of abortion and illegal immigration. He has sponsored numerous pieces of legislation that would crack down on illegal immigration. In 2009, he created controversy by stating he hoped babies born from mothers with HIV were born with severe cases of AIDS to punish the mothers. He voted against Senate Bill 179, which requires health care providers treating pregnant women to test those women for HIV unless they opt out.http://www.leg.state.co.us/clics/clics2009a/csl.nsf/fsbillcont3/7CE0E6A97FB09E298725754E008233D9?open&file;=179_ren.pdf This provision is intended to ensure that steps can be taken to prevent mother to child transmission of the disease if the mother is infected. Schultheis claimed that HIV infection was the result of \\"sexual promiscuity for the most part\\", and that the point of the proposed legislation was \\" . . . to remove the consequences of poor behavior, unacceptable behavior, quite frankly. I'm not convinced that part of the role of government should be to protect individuals from the negative consequences of their actions.\\"http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2009/feb/25/gop-lawmakers- comments-hiv-promiscuity-cause-uproa/ Again in 2009, Schultheis stirred up controversy by posting to his Twitter account, \\"[President Barack Obama is] flying the U.S. plane right into the ground.\\" He then ended his tweet with the phrase \\"Let's roll,\\" the signature sign-off of Flight 93 before reclaiming the hijacked plane during the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the U.S. Trade Towers in New York. The next day, Schultheis made clear his remarks were not intended to compare President Barack Obama to terrorist hijackers, but to express his rage against the president's fiscal policies. Evidence suggests the clarification was made in response to demands that he retract his statement by Colorado Senate President Brandon Shaffer and public admonishment by State Senate Minority Leader Josh Penry.

It lies almost on the 60th parallel north. Mail has two beaches, the Sands of Mail and the Beach of Mail, separated by the promontory of Bur Ness. Bur Ness contains the Mail churchyard, which has been the site of various archaeological finds. History Bur Ness was the site of Mail's chapel. The chapel was part of Cunningsburgh parish, now part of Dunrossness. Nothing is known of the chapel except that it was the recognised church of the area from a very early date. However, the churchyard still remains. =Archaeology= Several Pictish gravestones dating from the 7th century have been found in the churchyard, including the Mail Stone, with an incised Pictish figure, found in 1992. Gravestones have also been found with Norse runes, indicating Viking activity in the area, as well as inscriptions in Ogham. Evidence of earlier Iron Age archaeology is also present. Located on a tidal islet at Bur Ness is the site of the former Broch of Mail. The broch is now non-existent. However, a visit in 1934 indicated the circular foundation of a broch tower, although there are no visible traces, having been covered by turf.

Nash won the Miss California USA pageant in 2005, becoming only the third African American to hold the title. She went on to place first runner-up in the Miss USA 2006 pageant. Nash has previously been employed by The Recording Academy, known for the Grammy Awards and is currently working as an actress in the Los Angeles area. Nash was a model on the television series The Price Is Right from 2007 to 2008. Nash passed on her crown to Meagan Tandy in October 2006. In December it was reported that Tara Conner, who won the Miss USA pageant, might be dethroned due to inappropriate behavior. This never did occur. Conner was famously forgiven by Donald Trump and remained Miss USA 2006. Pageantry Nash won the Miss California USA 2006 title in the state pageant held in Palm Springs, California, in September 2005. She won the crown on her first attempt and was only the third African American to hold the title. Nash represented California in the Miss USA 2006 pageant broadcast live from Baltimore, Maryland, in April 2006. She placed first-runner up to Tara Conner of Kentucky, the second consecutive delegate from California to reach this position. Brittany Hogan, Miss California USA 2005, was first runner-up to Chelsea Cooley of North Carolina in 2005. Prior to the announcement of the winner, eventual winner Tara Conner and Nash shared a long embrace, whilst Conner whispered to Nash. It was later revealed on an E! special that Conner, believing Nash had won, was wishing her luck for her reign as Miss USA and her participation at Miss Universe. The traditional statement declaring that if, for any reason the new titleholder cannot fulfill her reign, the first runner- up will take over was then read. Following this, a shocked Conner was announced as the winner. Deal or No Deal taping. Tara Conner, who later won the Miss USA title, is on Nash's left; Leeann Tingley, who placed in the top ten, is on her right. This image distorts their true heights, as Nash is slightly taller than Conner. Nash was also one of twenty six Miss USA delegates who appeared on Deal or No Deal in April 2006. After the Miss USA pageant, she appeared as one of the feature delegates in an E! special: Hidden Lives of Miss USA. =Controversy surrounding Tara Conner= On December 14, 2006, controversy erupted when TMZ.com published an article stating that Tara Conner, Miss USA 2006, might be dethroned for unacceptable behavior in several New York City bars. According to a report, sources told TMZ.com that Conner is \\"out of control\\" and needs to go. If Conner was to be dethroned, Nash, as her first runner-up, would inherit the rest of her reign as Miss USA 2006. Executives from both the pageant, including Donald Trump, and its broadcaster, NBC, met Tuesday to discuss whether to release Conner from her duties. The Miss Universe Organization released a statement saying that Conner had not been dethroned and that they and Trump would be \\"evaluating her behavioral and personal issues\\" and would make an announcement within the week. On December 15, TMZ reported that Conner would be stripped of her crown, and that Nash would become Miss USA. However this was not the case. Trump forgave Conner and allowed her to retain the crown. Personal life Nash currently works as an actress and host in the Los Angeles area. She is president of The Shine Foundation, which is dedicated to empowering young women. She appeared wearing her \\"Miss California USA\\" sash on the Green Carpet at the Grammys, and has since made appearances at the Camden House of Beverly Hills Grand Opening, the NAACP Image Awards, and other red carpet events.

It consists of three equally sized vertical stripes, with the outer two painted blue and the centre painted red. The work was created as a special commission for Expo 67. In 1987 it was loaned to the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The purchase of Voice of Fire by the National Gallery of Canada for its permanent collection in 1989 at a cost of $1.8 million caused a storm of controversy. Some residents mocked the purchase with striped T-shirts and ties that mimicked the painting. The 1996 book Voices of Fire: Art Rage, Power, and the State, edited by Bruce Barber, Serge Guilbaut and John O'Brian, discusses the issues around the purchase of the painting. History of Voice of Fire Commissioned for Expo 67, the International and Universal Exposition that took place in Montreal during Canada's 1967 centennial, Voice of Fire was part of the US pavilion organized by art critic and historian Alan Solomon. The exhibition, American Painting Now featured the work of twenty-two artists installed in the US Pavilion, a geodesic dome designed by engineer Buckminster Fuller.O'Brian, 124 Explicitly oriented to Solomon's directions, Voice of Fire's 18 foot length was vertical to echo the size of the dome. This was the first time Newman worked on this scale in a vertical format.Smith, 177 The paintings were displayed along other symbols of American progress, an Apollo space capsule and red-and-white striped Apollo parachutes, photographs of the Moon and large-scale photographs of movie stars.O'Brian, 127 In the spring of 1987, Brydon Smith, then assistant director of the National Gallery of CanadaO'Brian, 130 contacted Newman's widow Annalee to ask if she would consider lending it to the gallery for a temporary exhibition the following year to coincide with the completion of a new building. Barnett Newman painting \\"Voice Of Fire,\\" National Art Gallery, 2015 In May 1988 Voice of Fire was installed in the newly constructed National Gallery of Canada with little media attention or controversy. It was displayed in a large, high-ceiling space, with only a few other works by American artists Milton Resnick, Jackson Pollock and Tony Smith. In this display of post-war US art, Voice of Fire \\"was given pride of place\\" as the centrepiece. In March 1990, the National Gallery announced its purchase of the painting for $1.8 million,O'Brian, 131 which ignited a \\"firestorm\\" of media attention and controversy in Ottawa mostly centred on the question of if the work was worthy of being called art. In 2014, it was reported that senior personnel at the National Gallery estimated that the current value of the painting is in excess of $40 million. A further controversy ensued in 1992 when it was discovered that the painting had been displayed upside-down following its acquisition. The work remains in the possession of the National Gallery of Canada.gallery.ca entry References Sources * O'Brian, John. \\"Who's Afraid of Barnett Newman?\\" Voices of Fire: Art Rage, Power, and the State.

The song is one of the best-known elements of the Australian folk repertoire. It has been recorded by many folk and popular artists and groups including Martin Carthy, The Bushwhackers, Gary Shearston, Niamh Parsons, June Tabor and Weddings Parties Anything. Paul Kelly made his public debut singing the Australian folk song 'Streets Of Forbes' to a Hobart audience in 1974. The Streets of Forbes is usually listed as traditional or anonymous, but Gary Shearston writes that \\"there are reasons for thinking John McGuire, (Ben Hall's brother in law), may well have been the original author\\". Lyrics :Come all of you Lachlan men :and a sorrowful tale I'll tell, :concerning of a hero bold :who through misfortune fell, :His name it was Ben Hall, a man of high renown, :Who was hunted from his station, and like a dog shot down. :Three years he roamed the roads, and he showed the traps some fun, :One thousand pounds was on his head, with Gilbert and John Dunn. :Ben parted from his comrades, the outlaws did agree, :To give away bushranging and to cross the briny sea. :Ben went to Goobang Creek, and that was his downfall :For riddled like a sieve was the valiant Ben Hall, :'Twas early in the morning upon the fifth of May :That the seven police surrounded him as fast asleep they lay. :Bill Dargin he was chosen to shoot the outlaw dead, :The troopers then fired madly and they filled him full of lead, :They rolled him in his blanket and strapped him to his prad, :And they led him through the streets of Forbes, to show the prize they had. Explanation The song recounts how Ben Hall left his station and became a bushranger for 3 years, and was then shot dead by police in 1865. The song paints Ben Hall in a sympathetic light, and portrays the police as corrupt, brutal and cowardly. =Cultural references= Forbes is a small town in New South Wales, a state of Australia. At the time of Ben Hall, Forbes was part of the Colony of New South Wales, in turn part of the British Empire. \\"Lachlan men\\" refers to people living near the Lachlan River, which runs through Forbes. A station is a large Australian livestock farm. \\"Traps\\" and \\"troopers\\" are old Australian terms for the police. Gilbert and John Dunn were two other bushrangers who were members of Ben Hall's gang. Bushrangers were rural outlaws in colonial Australia, who typically engaged in robbery and theft. Goobang Creek is a small tributary of the Lachlan River. The Bill Dargin (also known as Billy Dargin) mentioned in the song was an Australian aboriginal tracker employed by the police to find Ben Hall. \\"Prad\\" is old Australian slang for a horse. \\"One thousand pounds\\" refers to the British pound, the currency of Australia during colonial times. In 1910 it was replaced by the Australian pound. In 1966 the Australian dollar became the official currency.

The GX3 was first shown at the 2006 Greater Los Angeles Auto Show. It was considered an unusual concept, since it was three wheeled and sometimes considered more of a motorcycle concept than a concept car; but it did feature good performance for a projected cost of only about US$17,000. The GX3 used a transverse mounted 1.6 L I4 engine from the VW Lupo GTI. This engine gave the GX3 an output of 125 PS (92 kW) and 152 N¬∑m (112 ft¬∑lbf) of torque. The GX3 could go from 0‚Äì100 km/h in 5.7 seconds and had a top speed of 200 km/h (125 mph). It used a six speed manual transmission. The design of the GX3 was atypical, with a front double wishbone suspension, tubular steel spaceframe and laminated body panels. The concept was of a rare type - two seats, three wheels. The GX3 lacked a roof or windshield, and was intended mainly for fair weather environments, as a \\"weekend car\\". The design of the interior was minimalist and functional. There was considerable speculation as to possible production of the GX3; Volkswagen fueled this with the announcement that production would depend on the public reaction to the concept. However, in spite of the positive public response, and intensive chassis development by Lotus Cars for production, Volkswagen later concluded that it would not be able to sell the GX3 without costly, and complex redesigns that would alienate Volkswagen's target market and increase price above the proposed US$17,000 base price. The company cited possible safety issues that could lead to product liability lawsuits, and decided that the legal concerns made production as is impossible.

These aircraft were armed with two forward-firing machine guns and a further machine gun in the rear cockpit and could carry four 250-lb or two 500-lb bombs.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 39 The squadron began training on 6 January. It practiced formation flying, dive bombing and air-to- ground gunnery as well as conducting air defence exercises with other units based at Wagga Wagga. On 2 February No. 60 Squadron moved to Cootamundra but remained under the operational command of Wagga Wagga's operations room. From 3 to 5 February the squadron exercised with another squadron based at Wagga Wagga. It did not conduct any flight training after 6 February, but continued ground training. No. 60 Squadron was disbanded on 3 April 1942 as its aircraft and personnel were needed by the RAAF's training units. The squadron's aircraft and other equipment were transferred to RAAF units at Uranquinty and its personnel posted to units at Uranquinty and Deniliquin. The squadron's commander throughout its existence, Blake Pelly, was promoted to the rank of acting group captain in 1944 and represented the Electoral district of Wollondilly in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly between 1950 and 1957.

It was formed in May 1943 as an emergency measure and disbanded in January 1944. History During the first half of 1943 Japanese submarines operated off the Australian east coast, sinking 16 ships and damaging several more. In response to these losses the Australian Government expanded the military's anti-submarine warfare (ASW) forces. Three new RAAF maritime patrol units equipped with Avro Anson training aircraft, No. 66, No. 67 and No. 71 squadrons, were raised during this expansion. While it was recognised that the Ansons lacked sufficient range and payload to be effective in the ASW role, superior aircraft were not available.Wilson (1992), p. 48 No. 66 Squadron was formed at RAAF Station Bundaberg, Queensland, on 20 May 1943 from elements of No. 8 Service Flying Training School, and was the last of the three new Anson-equipped squadrons to be raised.Eather (1995), p. 81 It received its first Ansons on 2 July, began flight training on 26 July and conducted its first operational patrol the next day. Pilots from the squadron ferried more Ansons from RAAF Base Laverton to Bundaberg in early August, and it reached a strength of 18 aircraft on the 8th of that month.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 83 A flight of Beaufort aircraft from No. 32 Squadron was also attached to the unit.Wilson (1992), p. 49 From late July 1943 onwards the squadron escorted Allied shipping travelling off the east coast of Australia. These patrols were uneventful, and the squadron did not sight any Japanese submarines or ships. No. 66 Squadron aircraft also exercised with Royal Australian Navy ships east of Moreton Island on 29 and 30 August. While several of the squadron's Ansons were involved in accidents, only one was written off. In November 1943 the Government decided to reduce the military's ASW force as no Japanese submarines were known to have operated off Australia since June.Odgers (1968), pp. 155‚Äì156 Accordingly, No. 66 Squadron was disbanded on 8 January 1944 and its personnel were transferred to No. 8 Service Flying School, No. 1 Operational Training Unit and No. 71 Squadron.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 84 Notes References  * 66 Military units and formations established in 1943 Military units and formations disestablished in 1944 ","title":"No. 66 Squadron RAAF"},{"id":"4351882","text":"Mailand is a hamlet in the Shetland Islands.

It was devised by the programme's presenter at the time, Simon Mayo. Mayo, a history graduate from University of Warwick, used the day's date each morning to regurgitate historical anniversaries and events which had happened on that date in years passed. As a quirk, he would often add a mildly cynical punchline to each of the stories he recounted, and then would get his \\"crew\\" (female co-host, newsreader and producer) each to guess the age of living celebrities who were born on that day. A tie-in book of the same title was published in later years, with much advertisement by the BBC, initially just to give away on the show to a daily winner who rang in with the correct answer to a question posed by Mayo about a specific person or event of relevance to that date. Perhaps the most famous part of the feature was the music used to soundtrack it; a looped instrumental version of the George Michael hit I Want Your Sex; the full version of which had been banned from broadcast by Radio 1 when it was released in 1987. The feature ended when Mayo left the breakfast show, although when he switched to the mid-morning programme, he revived it in part with a spot called Dead Or Alive?, where he would ask listeners whether celebrities or known figures born on the date in question were still living or not. Mayo now works for BBC Radio 2 and BBC Radio Five Live and no longer does any features which show off his passion for history. However, the feature is a regular on Chris Evans's Radio 2 breakfast show, with a celebrity guest reading events that happened on that particular day in history. The last fact is nearly always music related and directly links into the next song played on the show. The feature is also often heard in one form or another on many commercial radio stations.

Early models, branded were chambered in .22 Long. Starting in the 1980s, under the slightly modified \\"LadySmith\\" moniker, S&W; manufactured several short- barreled revolvers and semi-automatic pistols. History Smith & Wesson has produced firearms over the years in several standard frame sizes. M-frame refers to the small early Ladysmith frame. Later LadySmith small revolvers were made on the somewhat larger J-frame, the standard S&W; small-frame revolver. The tiny M-frame .22\\" hand-ejector Ladysmith revolver was produced from 1902 through 1921, and later diminutive revolvers were termed LadySmith, capitalizing the \\"S\\". Models * Smith & Wesson Model 36 LadySmith (AKA: Chief's Special LadySmith): a blued steel, small frame, 5-shot, .38 Special revolver. * Smith & Wesson Model 60 LadySmith (AKA: Chief's Special LadySmith): a stainless steel, small frame, 5-shot, .38 Special or .357 Magnum, revolver. * Smith & Wesson Model 65 LadySmith: a stainless steel, medium frame, 6-shot, .357 Magnum revolver. * Smith & Wesson Model 631 LadySmith: a stainless steel, small frame, 6-shot, .32 H&R; Magnum revolver. * Smith & Wesson Model 642 LadySmith: a small frame, 5-shot, .38 Special, hammerless revolver with an aluminum frame and stainless steel cylinder. * Smith & Wesson Model 3913 LadySmith: a compact, 9-shot, 9mm Luger, semi- automatic pistol with an aluminum frame and stainless steel slide. Miscellaneous The LadySmith version of Smith's model 3913 is referred to as the 3913LS. It has a stainless steel slide with an aluminum alloy frame. The 3913LS had a different look to the slide and frame. It is chambered for 9mm only. It has a 3.5 inch barrel and the magazine holds eight rounds. It is one of their third generation semi-automatic pistols that S&W; refers to as a \\"traditional double action\\". This refers to a mode of operation wherein the first pull of the trigger is longer and heavier, and causes the hammer to rise from its resting position and then fall to strike the firing pin and fire the cartridge in the chamber. After the pistol fires that first time, the pistol is in what is called \\"single action\\", wherein the hammer stays cocked and subsequent trigger pulls are much shorter and lighter. The safety/decock lever on the side of the slide can be lowered which will (a) safely drop the cocked hammer, and (b) prevent the pistol from firing by disconnecting the trigger and by rotating a block between the hammer and firing pin. It is the firing pin block that makes dropping the hammer with the decocker safe, albeit somewhat unnerving. The original 3913 has been popular with law enforcement officers that need to carry their primary sidearm concealed. The Lady Smith is very flat because it has a single-stack magazine and only a single thumb safety on the left side compared to the two-sided ambidextrous safety on the 3913NL.

It was formed in January 1943, conducted patrols off the southern Australian coastline until the end of the war, and was disbanded in November 1945. History During the first half of 1943 Japanese submarines operated off the Australian east coast, sinking 16 ships and damaging several more. In response to these losses the Australian Government expanded the military's anti-submarine warfare (ASW) forces. Three new RAAF maritime patrol units equipped with Avro Anson training aircraft, No. 66, No. 67 and No. 71 squadrons, were raised during this expansion. While it was recognised that the Ansons lacked sufficient range and payload to be effective in the ASW role, superior aircraft were not available.Wilson (1992), p. 48 No. 67 Squadron was formed at RAAF Base Laverton on 6 January 1943 with a strength of 180 personnel and 14 Ansons. The squadron operated from Laverton and several other bases in Victoria to escort convoys and conduct anti-submarine patrols. It was later organised into two flights which operated alternately from Laverton and Mallacoota.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 85 In March 1944 the squadron reached a strength of 244 personnel and 17 Ansons. The squadron made a number of possible submarine sightings during the first months of 1943. Aircrew reported sighting submarines on 1, 11, 16 and 21 February but none of these boats were attacked. On 11 April a No. 67 Squadron aircraft was escorting Convoy OC86 when it was attacked by Japanese submarine I-26, but did not sight the attacker.Odgers (1968), p. 142 The next day two No. 67 Squadron Ansons protected the minesweeper by attacking a submarine which they believed they had sighted near the ship. No. 67 Squadron continued to conduct uneventful patrols off southern Australia until the end of the war. In addition to its main ASW task, it also conducted searches for missing aircraft and vessels and participated in naval and army co-operation exercises in Victoria and Tasmania.RAAF Historical Section (1995), p. 86Eather (1995), p. 81 An unusual task undertaken by the squadron was providing aircraft for a Council for Scientific and Industrial Research survey of pelagic fish between Sydney and Ceduna from 21 to 24 April 1945.

It was originally serialized in Weekly Sh≈çnen Magazine, then moved to Magazine Special in 2003. From chapter 50 and onwards, it is in monthly magazine format. It was published in the United States by Del Rey Manga. The story follows a similar plot to Kobayashi's earlier work Parallel. Plot 16-year- old Mugi Tadano tries to shake off his latest heartbreak by working at his friend's aunt's beach-side inn. One day he spies on a beautiful girl, Yuu Tsukisaki, changing clothes in an alley behind the inn. Instead of getting angry, Yuu charges him the price of a soda for watching her. The next day Mugi is set up on a blind date with Yuu, and they have a great time ‚Äî until Mugi walks in in the middle of her bath. Yuu decides to leave on the next ferry out, leaving Mugi heartbroken again. However, when he returns home, he is surprised to find that Yuu and her younger sister Tsukasa are going to be his housemates, as their parents were mutual friends. The series follows Mugi's adventures with his new roommates. In the first few days, Tsukasa leaves the two of them alone. Mugi's classmate and childhood friend Manami shows interest in Mugi but later supports their relationship. Yuu attracts several boys and even visits her home town over in Tokyo, making Mugi so jealous that he follows her, and ends up meeting his ex. Other girls visit their household, including Mugi's big sister-like childhood friend Sayuri who has become a model, and classmate Kiku Murakami, who tries unsuccessfully to smear Yuu's reputation. Mugi discovers he has a talent for cooking, and meets Tetsu Shiba, an owner of a small restaurant, and Aoi Sonobe, a young woman who likes Tetsu. Yuu and Tsukasa's mother visits and wants to take her back. Tsukasa senses that Mugi likes Yuu, so she tries to set him up as much as she can. Sayuri gets engaged. Kazumi tells Mugi that he likes Manami and wants to date her. A busty young woman, Mako Minamino, joins the household as Mugi's father's love interest. After numerous missed opportunities, Mugi finally confesses to Yuu that he likes her and they become a couple. Later stories involve more girls and relationships, including schoolmate Urara Haruno who has a reputation for dressing sexy, her sister Moe who enjoys reading romance novels, Tooko who is a Japanese idol in love with Mugi, and Tsukasa's friend Pepper from America who joins the household. While Mugi and Yuu still try to figure out how to advance their relationship they see their friends hooking up: Sayuri gets married, Tetsu and Aoi agree to sign a marriage certificate, and even Mako and Mugi's father sign one. Characters In the bonus comic \\"The Pastel Meeting\\", Kobayashi sketched a meeting with his editor where they ended up talking about the appeal of Japanese actresses/models Aoi Miyazaki , Y≈´ Aoi, and Leah Dizon, who became the inspirations for the stories in Pastel. =Main characters= ; :Mugi is a high school boy who has lived by himself most of his life because of his mother‚Äôs death and his father‚Äôs being away for work. His friends describe him as plain,Mugi's name is sometimes translated as yet responsible and dependable. He falls in love with Yuu at first sight, and has sexual fantasies about her after she begins living with him. In order to not compromise their living situation, he suppresses his thoughts, and holds back from expressing his feelings for her, preferring to just protect her. Despite often stumbling into compromising situations with girls, and having to go along with their demands for his time and attention, he refuses their confessions because he likes Yuu the most. After being encouraged multiple times by his friends, he finally confesses to Yuu and has his feelings reciprocated. ; :The cover girl of the series and Mugi's love interest, Yuu accepts Mugi's father's offer to live with Mugi after her father dies. She is good-natured, smart and responsible (lacking only some cooking skills and handiwork), described as being very cute with a developed body. She is popular in school and has an easy time making friends. Even though she returns to live with her mother, she later returns to Mugi's place the next summer to finish high school. Although at times she has denied having romantic interest in Mugi, she gets jealous when he receives affections from girls that are not his childhood friends. As of the end of volume 14, she stops denying her own feelings, and responds to Mugi's confession. Some of the later chapters are presented from her perspective. =Supporting characters= ; :Yuu‚Äôs younger sister, Tsukasa is a vibrant, mayhem-causing character who loves attention. She is more knowledgeable about relationships than her older sister, and often embarrasses Mugi by guessing his perverted thoughts, although she herself does not engage in such activity. She sometimes hatches elaborate plans for Yuu and Mugi to be together. She initially lives with Yuu and Mugi, but later moves to live with her mother, and lives in America. When she returns to Japan, her body has matured so that she can impersonate her sister by donning a wig. She also likes to hide in the walls to spy on Mugi and Yuu. ; :Mugi‚Äôs best friend since childhood. In the first chapter, Mugi remarks that he looks about 20 years old. Most girls that he flirts with flatly reject him; those who do not usually slap him because he is too forward. On his 18th birthday, he confesses to Manami, having liked her for over a decade but keeping silent beforehand because she liked Mugi. After they begin dating, he cleans up his act a little in order to feel that he is deserving of her. ; :She is one of Mugi‚Äôs childhood friends. She harbors a crush on Mugi, but holds back her confession because he was dating her friend Hinako. She later confesses to Mugi, but is turned down as he has fallen in love with Yuu. She is later shocked when Kazuki confesses she has liked her for ten years, but later realizes they care about each other, and agrees to date him. ; : Mugi‚Äôs next-door neighbor who acts like his big sister. After Mugi's mother died, Sayuri watched over him and even taught him how to cook. She is a Tokyo University student and a model. She occasionally visits Mugi where she binges on beer and plays Tekken with Tsukasa. She so values her relationship with Mugi that she introduces her fiance Takumi to him before she does to her parents. She and Takumi marry. ; : Kiku is a popular schoolmate that the main characters meet on a group date. She likes to tease guys and use them for her own entertainment, but is piqued when Mugi resists her advances. After seeing how popular and innocent Yuu is, she pretends to be her friend, but secretly tries to sully her reputation by taking scandalous pictures of herself dressed up like Yuu, and spreading them to their schoolmates. She returns in a later storyline at the beach-side inn. Although she no longer puts up an innocent act, she is still popular with guys and is quite flirtatious, but refuses to get into any relationships with them. She still likes Mugi, believing that his relationship with Yuu will not last, and ponders when they might break up. She later becomes friends with Urara, who has an opposite personality to her. ; : Mugi‚Äôs father is a photographer who is often away from home for long periods of time so that Mugi is never sure when he visits. He makes a promise with Yuu and Tsukasa's father that he would take care of his daughters. He briefly returns to check up on Mugi, Yuu and Mako; the latter tells him that she has fallen in love again, reminding him of a promise he had made to her when they first met that when she ever does, he would give her a reward. When she hints that it is him, he simply smiles and signs his half of the marriage certificate. ; :Tetsu is the owner of a small restaurant; he offers Mugi and Yuu refuge when they get caught in the rain. After tasting Mugi‚Äôs cooking, he offers him a part-time job and becomes his cooking mentor. He has an Imari plate collection that dwindles whenever Aoi visits and gets angry. Although Aoi likes him a lot, Tetsu tries not to return her affections because he wants her to be free. He and Aoi often argue., but eventually Tetsu accepts Aoi's feelings, and the two become a couple. When Tetsu was younger, he and Ken were rivals for Mugi's mother's affection. It is revealed that he and Aoi had filled out a marriage registration form, which they turn in to the courthouse later. ; : Aoi is a young traveling artist who frequents Tetsu‚Äôs restaurant. Although she likes to hug and kiss people, she has feelings for Tetsu, and gets jealous whenever he brushes her off or mentions liking older women. In the end, when Aoi finally gets tired of Tetsu after hearing from him that he was getting an omiai, she resolves to leave. Before she does, Tetsu catches up to her and asks her to come back to him, promising her that he would give her happiness. She and Tetsu fill out a marriage registration form, but she does not submit it until the end of the chapter when she thinks she is pregnant. ; :Mako is a busty woman who joins the Tadano household as Mugi's new mother. Ken met her in Alaska when he was taking pictures during the Aurora Borealis, where she was mourning the third anniversary of her high school sweetheart‚Äôs death. Being only five years older than Mugi, she enjoys suggesting activities with Mugi that Yuu deems inappropriate, and plays games that have a sexual twist, such as strip rock-paper-scissors, with uncanny good luck. She reveals that she and Ken have not married or planned a wedding yet, but later on reveals that she does love Ken. She becomes Mugi and Yuu's homeroom teacher, and Mugi's official stepmother after Ken signs his half of the marriage certificate. ; : Urara is introduced as a schoolmate in Mugi's after-school supplementary class. She has a reputation of being ero kawaii (a combination of being erotic but cute) because of her sexy dress and appearance, although she is unaware of her effects on others. Yuu is initially jealous of her when she sees her hanging around with Mugi, but she learns that Urara has a crush on a childhood friend who plays basketball and looks up to Yuu as a role model. ; : Urara's younger sister who wears glasses. She is described as shy and a bookworm, but well-endowed like her sister. She aspires to be a novelist and solicits Mugi's help to write a story on what it's like to live with Yuu, whom she idolizes. She is a bit airheaded and clumsy, often falling to the floor in a sexy position and losing her glasses. She is an otaku, and prefers falling in love with the guy character in the novels she reads, and has a fear of guys besides Mugi (who she thinks of more like a female friend) and his father (upon whom she gets a brief crush). ; : Tsukasa's schoolmate and buddy from America, Pepper is a blonde-haired girl who joins Tsukasa when she returns to Japan. She flirts with Mugi quite a bit when they initially meet. She has a black belt in karate, and also does other martial arts such as judo and aikido. She was born in Japan and adopted after birth. Her biological father proposed to her mother in Onomichi, and she was named after the seasoning when they ate at Tetsu's restaurant. Ken agrees to adopt her into the Tadano family. ; : Named after the Mandarin orange box she was found in, Mikan is a kitten that joins the Tadano household. She stars in a side story in Pastel as well as some of its chapters where she muses about Mugi and Yuu's slowly developing relationship. ; : Yuu's St. Bernard whom she got on her birthday when she was little. He was named after the snack. =Minor characters= ; : Manami‚Äôs best friend and Mugi's former girlfriend, having broken up with Mugi prior to the start of the series when she left for Tokyo for school. She is very accident prone, and compatible with Mugi and his supportive personality. During Mugi's trip to Tokyo, it is revealed that she still has feelings for him. In a return visit, it is revealed that her relationship with Mugi had progressed so slowly, that Kazuki and Manami forged love letters to get them together, and they technically had not broken up. Although she has dated many guys, she still has feelings for Mugi and confesses to him one more time, but is turned down when Mugi replies that he likes Yuu. In the afterword of volume 14, Kobayashi noted that he brought back Hinako Kayama because of her popularity with readers, giving her a story that spanned five chapters. ; :She divorced her husband when her daughters were still in elementary school because she could not handle the long period of time in which he was away. When she remarried, she let Yuu and Tsukasa live with the Tadanos so as to not cause conflict with her new family. After taking Yuu and Tsukasa back, she reconciles with her second husband as her stepson has moved out of the house; she and Tsukasa relocate with her husband to the United States. ;Yuu and Tsukasa's father :A former rival photographer and friend of Ken Tadano. Both were in members of the photography club in university. Because he was away for long periods of time from his family, he and his wife divorced when Yuu and Tsukasa were in elementary school. However, he later retires to take care of his daughters. His death at the start of the series places Yuu and Tsukasa under the care of the Tadanos. ; :A good-looking and popular schoolmate who asks Yuu out early in the series. Although Yuu agrees to go out with him, she only thinks of him as a friend. His father owns a restaurant that does French cuisine. He later helps Yuu make a cake. When Yuu refuses his confession, and he notices her with Mugi, he does not believe they are actually a couple. In a later chapter, he has a girlfriend. ; :A daughter of one of Tetsu‚Äôs friends who owns a restaurant. Mugi works for her for a week, after which Mugi discovers she is a year younger in his school. Yuu is jealous of her because Hana acts quite friendly with Mugi, walking with him to school and bringing him lunch. ; :He is introduced as Sayuri‚Äôs fianc√©. He works at a small second- hand furniture shop. The first time he sees her, he proposes to her, but after dating, she eventually accepts. He likes to repair people's stuff even when not asked. Unlike Sayuri, he does not drink alcohol, and prefers tomato juice. Although he loses their wedding rings, he is able to reconcile with Sayuri and presents her with a wood-carved ring that matches his. He also presents a pair for Mugi and Yuu. ; : Tooko is a young actress from the agency that Sayuri works with. She introduces herself as Mugi‚Äôs younger sister, and uses a wig to disguise herself. She takes breaks from her acting duties, and likes being affectionate with Mugi, declaring Yuu her rival, and occasionally bragging to Yuu about it with text messages. Manga volumes =Volumes 1-14= =Volumes 15-= Reception In Manga: The Complete Guide, Jason Thompson gave the series out of 4 stars. He wrote: \\"Pastel is less a story than a supplement to the swimsuit photos that often run in shonen manga magazines. The hero is passive and wimpy, and the girl is an inscrutable abstraction, occasionally sad or peeved, but mostly fawning over Mugi despite the fact that he's accidentally seen her naked umpteen times.\\" He also writes that the \\"art is slick, with curvy bodies and detailed, photorealistic backgrounds.\\" Works cited * \\"Ch.\\" and \\"Vol.\\" is shortened form for chapter and volume and refers to a chapter or volume number of the Pastel manga, written by Toshihiko Kobayashi.

Initially, Unit 9420 was under the command of Hareyama Yoshio, but in 1942, Lieutenant Colonel Naito Ryoichi, one of Ishii's most trusted colleagues, assumed control of the facility for several years. It was staffed with approximately 150 physicians and scientists, and produced huge quantities of pathogens annually. Naito and his staff worked primarily with typhus, plague, and pesticides. It is unknown whether Singapore was a BW research facility, or whether it was simply a laboratory employed to produce pathogens for use elsewhere.Sidu H.

However, there have been some success stories of bands that worked hard over the years to achieve commercial success such as Jimmie's Chicken Shack, Good Charlotte, SR-71, and Nothingface. Every year at the HFStival, the concert features a local music stage which was started and initially run by the influential, but now defunct, regional indie label Fowl Records. Many of the artists from the Mid-Atlantic Music Scene have showcased their talents on this stage. Clubs and venues As the Mid-Atlantic music scene is vast for the amount of land and genres of music covered, the venues that support the unsigned bands on their road to fame do their part by opening their doors and giving them the opportunity. All the while, the venues still make their quotas by bringing in the bigger names to pay the bills. Some of the more notable venues are the Bottle & Cork in Delaware, the recently revamped 8 by 10 in the Federal Hill area of Baltimore, and Fletchers in the Fells Point part of town; also Radio DJ Matt Davis of 98 Rock's (97.9 FM ‚Äì WIYY) hosts Noise in the Basement.98 Rock's Noise in the Basement ‚Äì DJ Matt Davis It is a night of networking for bands to perform and see others perform on Monday nights.

National, regional and local bands performed here, but generally the venue was for bands that have a larger fanbase. The Ottobar, located in the Charles Village neighborhood of Baltimore, is slightly smaller, but also showcases national, regional and local bands. A much newer member of the music venue family for this scene is the former warehouse space that is now Sonar Lounge, or just \\"Sonar\\" to the club goers. Most local acts perform on the small concert side stage which has hosted larger named talent, such as former members of the Wu-Tang Clan. =New Jersey= Asbury Park, New Jersey offers a variety of venues, including the Stone Pony, The Saint, and Asbury Lanes. =North Carolina= In North Carolina, there is an annual event that highlights the talent throughout the whole region usually held during the fall season, October / November entitled the Midatlantic Music Conference .
