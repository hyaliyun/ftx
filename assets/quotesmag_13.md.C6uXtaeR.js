History Built between 1945 and 1954, the church was designed by architect Leone Favini and is inspired by Roman Baroque architecture. The plan of the church is marked exteriorly and interiorly by its large dome. The interior is notable for a series of frescoes by the artist G.A. Santagata, depicting Marian images, among them a fresco showing the Virgin Mary seated among the Apostles as the Holy Spirit descends upon them. Cardinalatial Titular Church Pope Paul VI established the church as a cardinalatial Titular Church on 25 February 1965.

In April 1984 the Holy See granted the church the dignity of a minor basilica. The Pauline Family The church was founded by Father Giacomo Alberione, founder of the Society of St. Paul, of the Daughters of St. Paul, and other religious institutes which form the Pauline Family. The church is attached to the Mother House of the Society of St. Paul. In the church are the tombs of Blessed Giacomo Alberione, of Blessed Giuseppe Giaccardo (1896-1948), a priest of the Society of St. Paul, and that of Mother Thecla (Maria Teresa) Merlo (1894-1964), co-founder of the Daughters of St. Paul.

Function This gene encodes a protein that is involved as a negative regulator of GSK3-beta in the Wnt signaling pathway. The encoded protein may play a role in the retinoic acid signaling pathway by regulating the functional interactions between GSK3-beta, beta-catenin and cyclin D1, and it regulates the beta-catenin/N-cadherin pool. The encoded protein contains a GSK3-beta interacting domain (GID) in its C-terminus, which is similar to the GID of Axin. The protein also contains an evolutionarily conserved RII-binding domain, which facilitates binding with protein kinase-A and GSK3-beta, enabling its role as an A-kinase anchoring protein.

It was a French, single-engine, two-seat, low cantilever wing touring monoplane. At least six were built. Design and development Mauboussin M.12 with cockpit canopy from Annuaire de L'Aéronautique 1931 The low, cantilever wing of the M.112 was built in three parts, a tapered centre-section which was part of the fuselage and trapezoidal outer panels with elliptical tips. Its aspect ratio of 9.5 was high for the time. The outer panels carried mild dihedral and full-span, narrow-chord ailerons. The wings were completely wooden, with twin box spars and alder plywood skin. It was powered by an uncowled Salmson 9Ad nine- cylinder radial engine with its fuel tanks in the wing centre-section. Behind it, beyond a firewall, the wooden fuselage had a rectangular section defined by four longerons, though the upper decking was curved. It was covered in plywood. The M.112 had a pair of tandem seats over the wing, with the pilot at the rear. These seats could be open or enclosed by a removable cover. The fuselage tapered to the rear where the tail surfaces, also ply-covered, were straight-tapered and round tipped. Both horizontal and vertical surfaces had quite high aspect ratios and the vertical tail was tall; the horizontal tail was mounted on top of the fuselage. Both rudder and elevators were aerodynamically unbalanced. The M.112 had conventional, fixed landing gear. Its mainwheels, fitted with brakes, were on cranked axles and drag struts, both hinged from the lower fuselage longerons. There were short, vertical Messier oleo struts from the outer axles to the forward wing spars in the centre-section, giving it a track of . Its tailskid, which could be replaced with a wheel, castered and had twin small bungee shock absorbers. Operational history Built at the Zenith factory, the M.XII first flew in September 1931. In August 1932, flown by André Nicolle and registered as a Mauboussin M.112, it competed in the Challenge International de Tourisme 1932 (), which involved both technical tests and a circuit around Europe. It came last, but with its very low-powered engine, was the only aircraft in its class. It also appeared at the 1932 Paris Aero Salon. The French civil aircraft register included six M.112s, used by aero clubs and individuals. Aircraft in the Mauboussin M.120 Corsaire series which followed were similar to the M.112 but heavier and with more powerful engines.

The town of Torres is named after the \\"towers\\", or cliffs of volcanic origin, along the sea shore. There are three large rock formations: the Morro do Farol to the north, then the Morro das Furnas and the Morro da Guarita. The last two are in the state park. The rock formations are between 200 and 180 million years old, formed before South America split from Africa, and corresponding to Entedeka in Namibia. The lower layer is rosy sandstone of the Botucatu formation and the upper part is basalt blocks of the Serra Geral Formation. History The Guarita State Park was created in 1971 to protect a geological formation of great scenic and environmental value. It is also important economically, since it receives about 30,000 visitors annually. At first the park was administered by the state agency SETUR/RS. From 1996 it has been administered by the Municipal Secretariat for the Environment and Urbanism through a concession of use. The change in name to Parque Estadual José Lutzenberger was approved in January 2003, in recognition of the effort made by the environmentalist José Lutzenberger to have the park created, and to define and design the park.

Two of John's elder brothers, Albert and Rupert, both became bishops. His family backed John to succeed John II of Werdenberg as bishop of Augsburg and in 1486 sent a delegation to Augsburg to convince the cathedral chapter. However, on advice from Frederick III and other princes, the chapter instead chose Friedrich von Hohenzollern. Hurt and disappointed by this failure, John left Germany on pilgrimage to the Holy Land, accompanied only by his personal servants. He died there in 1486 and was buried in the Cenacle in Jerusalem. There is also a monument to him at Reichenbach Abbey showing a skeleton, in front of which is his father's gravestone.

MIRI is a camera and a spectrograph that observes mid to long infrared radiation from 5 microns to 28 microns. It also has coronagraphs, especially for observing exoplanets. Whereas most of the other instruments on Webb can see from the start of Near-infrared, or even as short as orange visible light, MIRI can see longer wavelength light where the other instruments leave off. MIRI uses silicon arrays doped with arsenic to make observations at these wavelengths. The imager is designed for wide views but the spectrograph has a smaller view. Because it views the longer wavelengths it needs to be cooler than the other instruments (see Infrared astronomy), and it has an additional cooling system. The cooling system for MIRI includes a Pulse Tube precooler and a Joule-Thomson Loop heat exchanger. This allows MIRI to be cooled down to a temperature of 7 kelvins during operations in space. Overview The spectrograph can observe wavelengths between 4.6 and 28.6 microns, and it has four separate channels, each with its own gratings and image slicers. The field of view of the spectrograph is 3.5 by 3.5 arcseconds. The imager has a plate scale of 0.11 arcseconds/pixel and a field of view of 74 by 113 arcseconds. Earlier in development the field of view was going to be 79 by 102 arcseconds (1.3 by 1.7 arcmin). The imaging channel has ten filters available and the detectors are made of arsenic-doped silicon (Si:As). The detectors have a resolution of 1024x1024 pixels, and they are called Focal Plane Modules or FPMs. During 2013 and finishing in January 2014, MIRI was integrated into the Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM). MIRI successfully passed Cryo Vac 1 and Cryo Vac 2 tests as part of ISIM in the 2010s. MIRI was developed by an international consortium. MIRI is attached to the ISIM by a carbon-fiber and plastic hexapod structure, which attaches it to the spacecraft but also helps thermally isolate it. (see also Carbon fiber reinforced plastic) Parts summary: *Spectrometer optics **Spectrometer Main Optics (SMO) **Spectrometer Pre Optics (SPO) *Focal Plane Arrays *Input-Optics Calibration Module (IOC) **Pick-off Mirror **Calibration source for Imager **Contamination Control Cover (CCC) *CFRP hexapod *Imager *Image slicers *Deck Most of MIRI is located in the main ISIM structure, however the cryocooler is in region 3 of ISIM which is located in the Spacecraft Bus (JWST).NASA JWST Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM - Accessed December 12, 2016] The Imager module of MIRI also includes the a Low Resolution Spectrometer that can perform long- slit and slitless spectroscopy from 5 to 12 μm light wavelength. The LRS uses Ge (Germanium metal) and ZnS (Zinc sulfide) prisms to cause spectroscopic dispersion. Cryocooler To allow mid-infrared observations within the JWST, the MIRI instrument has an additional cooling system. It works roughly similar to how most refrigerators or an air-conditioner works: a fluid is brought down to a cold temperature in the warm section, and sent back to the cold section where it absorbs heat, then it goes back to the condenser. One source of heat is the left-over heat of the spacecraft, but another is the spacecraft's own electronics, some of which are close to the actual instruments to process data from observations. Most of the electronics are in the much warmer spacecraft bus, but some of the electronics needed to be much closer, and great lengths were taken to reduce the heat they produce. By reducing how much heat the electronics make on the cold side, then less heat needs to be removed. In this case the JWST cryocooler resides in the Spacecraft Bus and it has lines of coolant the run to the MIRI instrument, chilling it. The cryocooler has a heat radiator on the spacecraft bus to emit the heat it collects. In this case the cooling system uses helium gas as the refrigerant. The JWST cryocooler is based originally on the TRW ACTDP cryocooler. However, the JWST has had to develop a version to handle higher thermal loads. It has a multi-stage pulse tube refrigerator that chills an even more powerful cooler. That is a linear- motion Oxford-style compressor that powers a J-T loop. Its target is to cool the MIRI instrument down to 6 kelvins (−448.87 °F, or −267.15 °C). The ISIM is at about 40 K (due to the sunshield) and there is a dedicated MIRI radiation shield beyond which the temperature is 20 K. The J-T loop is a Joule–Thomson loop heat exchanger.

West Sr. (1922–2014) was an American artist (painter). Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1922, West moved to Buffalo, New York in 1927. His art career spanned for about 70 years. Life and Family In his early life West was encouraged by his mother to pursue his artistic interests. He was the youngest of seven siblings, born in 1922. A year after his birth he was adopted by his Aunt and later they moved to Buffalo in 1926. He spent the majority of his life living in the East Side of Buffalo. When he returned from World War II in 1946, he attended art school and worked under many well-known artists including Charles E. Burtchfield and Robert Blair. The schools he attended during his studies were the Albright Art School and after that the Art Institute of Buffalo. He had two other jobs as a community organizer and a postal worker as well as his budding art career. West also had four children and a wife named Geraldine Summers. Artwork The subject matter of his art ranged from many different things including buildings under construction and demolished buildings, to a series inspired by the women in his life who were dressmakers. The most notable of his art were his landscapes that serve as tributes to the architectural past of the city of Buffalo. Mr. West never considered himself to be a professional artist, he simply did it because he loved to paint. In an interview he said,\\"...art continued to be something I pursued without an ambition to be a commercial artist or wanting to make money off of it. I just wanted to paint.\\" Death Mr. West died in 2014 of congestive heart failure. Though he is gone his art is still shown today, many buildings and an art gallery still have his work in their permanent collection; one of these places being the Burchfield Penney Art Center.

Located along South Willard Street between Pearl and Beech Streets, the architecturally heterogeneous area was in the 19th century home to major estates of the city's business leaders, and has since been infilled with a variety of late 19th and early 20th century architecture. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The city of Burlington was incorporated in 1789, and grew rapidly thereafter as a major transportation and industrial hub. Willard Street was laid out in the early 19th century, roughly midway up the sloping terrain between Lake Champlain and the hilltop on which the University of Vermont (UVM) campus is located. Located uphill from downtown Burlington, the area soon developed as a fashionable residential area for the city's upper classes, resulting in a series of widely spaced Federal and Greek Revival houses. In the third quarter of the 19th century, successful businessmen built high-quality Italianate and Second Empire houses, sometimes subdividing the previous estates. Development pressure in the late 19th and early 20th centuries resulted in additional infill construction for the area, which now serves as a melting pot of local workers and students attending UVM or Champlain College, whose campus is located near the center of the district. with The historic district extends along South Willard Street (now designated United States Route 7) from Pearl Street in the north to Beach Street in the south. It includes properties along some of the adjacent side streets, most prominently along Howard, Cliff, Spruce, and Maple Streets. It covers about , and includes 118 historically significant buildings. They are architecturally diverse, including nearly every architectural style popular in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Although most of these buildings were constructed as residences, some have been repurposed for institutional uses or converted into professional offices. Later buildings include multiunit apartment houses.

Ortiz, \\"The quest for a 100-mph fastball: Can MLB prospects safely develop velocity?\\" USA Today, June 8, 2016. is an American baseball pitching trainer and consultant. He is the founder and owner of baseball performance training system Driveline Baseball, which uses a sabermetric approach to increase pitching velocity and improve conditioning. He is also employed by the Cincinnati Reds of Major League Baseball. Early life and education Boddy was born and raised in Parma, Ohio.Hayden Grove, \\"Boddy, Bauer and a Brilliant Baseball Bond,\\" Scout.com, June 18, 2015. He attended Baldwin Wallace University in Berea, Ohio, where he studied computer science and economics before ultimately dropping out.Jeff Passan, \\"Excerpt: In 'The Arm,' a search for the new frontier of building healthy baseball pitchers,\\" Yahoo! Sports, May 27, 2016.Zach Buchanan, \\"A peek into baseball's future,\\" Cincinnati Enquirer, April 29, 2016.Mike Vorkunov, \\"Need for Speed: Has Baseball Reached Peak Velocity?\\" Vice Sports, May 6, 2016. Career =Data science and coaching= After college, Boddy worked exposing security flaws at PokerStars, an online poker site; at Microsoft for a year; and in various data science jobs. He also coached baseball at Roosevelt High School in Seattle for two years.Brendan Gawlowski, \\"Soft Toss,\\" Baseball Prospectus, December 23, 2015. Reading Michael Lewis' 2003 book Moneyball, about Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane's sabermetric approach to assembling his team, inspired Boddy to start researching and testing player development methods. =Driveline Baseball= In 2008, Boddy started a blog called Driveline Mechanics. It relied heavily on the theories of former Major League Baseball pitcher Mike Marshall. To test out his own theories, Boddy created his own biomechanics lab in Seattle, which included high-speed cameras, EMG sensors, force plates, inertial measurement units, and a device to measure elbow torque. Through research in his lab, and incorporating research from University of Hawaii professor Coop DeRenne, Boddy found that throwing with underweight and overweight baseballs would have a significant effect on velocity improvements, and that more throwing leads to healthier arms, as long as it's done with proper mechanics and sufficient recovery. Boddy founded Driveline Baseball in 2012. At its training facility in Kent, Washington, Boddy coaches amateur and pro pitchers from a variety of levels on ways to increase their velocity and improve their conditioning. Major League Baseball clients include Trevor Bauer, Dan Straily, Caleb Cotham, Chris Capuano, Joe Beimel and Matt Boyd. Boddy has worked as a consultant and pre-draft analyst for MLB teams including the Los Angeles Dodgers and Cleveland Indians, and as a consultant for college programs including Vanderbilt, Oregon State and Coastal Carolina, which won the 2016 College World Series.JP Hoornstra, \\"Dodgers turn to Driveline to boost minor leaguers' velocity,\\" Los Angeles Daily News, August 15, 2016. Driveline also works with high schools across the United States, and offers camps in Washington state for pitchers as young as 9 years-old. The first MLB player to work with Driveline was Cleveland Indians pitcher Trevor Bauer, who had achieved his own success in gaining velocity and was looking to improve his command. Bauer's fastball is considered to be among the hardest in baseball. Boddy and Bauer met in 2012, after Boddy presented his pitching research at the Texas Baseball Ranch in Montgomery, Texas. Bauer, who was in attendance, appreciated the science of Boddy's presentation. After struggling in Triple-A Columbus in 2013, Bauer began to train with Boddy at Driveline Baseball in Seattle prior to the 2014 season. Although Boddy's system was at first met with resistance from baseball insiders, it has since 2014 been steadily getting more recognition and approval. The training program aims to be a full pitching-development service, to \\"develop healthy, high velocity pitchers of any age.\\" It incorporates weighted baseballs and elements of recovery, mechanics and command, as well as the work of other pitching experts, such as Mike Marshall, Tom House, Ron Wolforth, Alan Jaeger and Coop DeRenne. The data-driven program emphasizes command, rehab from injury, pitch design and spin rate. It measures directly what is happening inside a pitcher's body as he throws the ball, breaking it down to help pitchers to best utilize their mechanics.Eno Sarris, \\"A New Way to Study Pitching Injury,\\" Fangraphs, March 10, 2016. Driveline uses Rapsodo's pitch-tracking cameraTom Taylor, \\"How one MLB player is using Rapsodo pitch analysis technology to revive his career,\\" Sports Illustrated, November 29, 2016. and TrackMan technology, which uses a military-grade 3D Doppler radar system to capture 20,000 measurements per second, to track a baseball's movement. With a focus on exactly how much torque and turning a pitcher needs to do, pitchers are regularly able to increase the speed of their fastball by 2 to 4 miles per hour.Hugh Bernreuter, \\"Loons, Andrew Istler profit from Driveline intensity,\\" Bay City Times, September 7, 2016. In June 2020, Boddy opened the second Driveline location in Arizona =Books= In 2013, Boddy published The Dynamic Pitcher, a training guide tailored to youth baseball pitchers. The following year, he published Hacking the Kinetic Chain, a guide to developing pitching velocity. =Cincinnati Reds= In October 2019, Boddy was hired by the Cincinnati Reds to be their Minor League Director of Pitching Initiatives/Pitching Coordinator. Other MLB teams had pursued him as well. Boddy continues to remain affiliated with Driveline.https://www.cincinnati.com/story/sports/mlb/reds/2019/10/01/cincinnati- reds-fire-hitting-coach-turner-ward-after-1-season/3830494002/ See also * Jeff Passan, The Arm: Inside the Billion-Dollar Mystery of the Most Valuable Commodity in Sports, Chapter 15: \\"The New Frontier\\" (Harper, 2016) References External links * Driveline Baseball website Living people 1983 births American strength and conditioning coaches Sportspeople from Greater Cleveland Sportspeople from Seattle People from Parma, Ohio Baldwin Wallace University alumni ","title":"Kyle Boddy"},{"id":"52482766","text":"The 13th Washington D.C.

During the migration from present-day Illinois/Kentucky and as far as Nebraska, they gradually split up in five groups. Each became an independent and historic tribe. They are the Omaha, Ponca, Kaw or Kansa, Osage and Quapaw. The term \\"Dhegiha\\" refers to all five Indian tribes, since they speak a Dhegiha Siouan language. Besides having related languages, they share an oral tradition about a common origin from an ancestral tribe. The timing of the separation for these tribes and history prior to their existence as separate groups is the subject of some debate. Before separation The migration story of the Quapaw, Omaha, Osage, Kansa (Kaw) and Ponca according to oral traditions The Quapaw, the Ponca, the Omaha, the Osage and the Kaw share a tradition, that back in time they were one people.Fletcher, Alice C. and F.

Plains Anthropologist, Vol. 38 (No.v 1993), No. 146, pp. 231-252. The claim is supported by similar tribal organization with kinship groups (clans) and closely related languages, although some of the tribes were widely scattered in historic time. (The Ponca and Omaha settled in Nebraska, the Kaw in Kansas, the Osage in Missouri, while Arkansas became the homeland of the Quapaw.) The people in the initial tribe called themselves the Hoga. It translates \\"leaders\\", meaning the preceding generations or \\"ancestors\\".Buffalohead, Eric: \\"Dhegihan History: A Personal Journey.\\" Plains Anthropologist, Vol. 49 (Nov. 2004), No. 192, pp. 327-343. They lived in villages of bark houses, made pottery, hunted and gathered and raised a small amount of corn. Ritter, Beth R. (2002): \\"Piecing Together the Ponca Past. Reconstructing Degiha Migrations to the Great Plains.\\" Great Plains Quarterly, Vol. 22 (Fall 2002), No. 4, pp. 271-284. According to tribal oral history collected by James Owen Dorsey, Alice Cunningham Fletcher, Omaha Indian Francis La Flesche and other interested people, the early Dhegiha people resided in the valley of the lower Ohio River. Dorsey, J. Owen (1884): Omaha Sociology. Smithsonian Institution. 3rd Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, 1881-'82. Washington. This shared tradition is \\"generally rejected by professional archeologists\\". According to one theory, the tribes were longtime residents in the areas west of Mississippi River, where the whites encountered them. The migration For some reason the tribe started on a journey down Ohio River prior to 1673. The migration may have been an answer to a breakdown of the old culture, climatic changes unfavorable for corn growing, epidemics and/or conflicts with Iroquoian and Algonquin Indians. While travelling, they lived in tents with the bottom of the cover secured with stones. Since the Hogas moved into new territory, the migration sometimes turned into an incursion. =The first separation= Reaching the mouth of the Ohio, the Hoga began crossing Mississippi River in skin boats. The first separation occurred here. A part of the people either followed the Mississippi southward on the eastern shore or they drifted away with the current. They became the Quapaw, which means Downstream People. Those who went against the current of the river on the western shore became the Omaha or Upstream People. The Quapaw tribe may have been encountered by Hernando De Soto near the Mississippi in 1541. However, the available evidence is contradictory. (In 1938, the De Soto Commission concluded it was some Tunica Indians he encountered). Most likely, the Quapaw Indians had recently settled in the Lower Mississippi area, when the French expedition of Jacques Marquette and Louis Jolliet encountered them in 1673 along the Mississippi River near the mouth of the Arkansas. House, John H.(2013): \\"Native American Material Culture from the Wallace Bottom Site, Southeastern Arkansas.\\" Southeastern Archaeology, Vol. 32 (Summer 2013), No. 1, pp. 54-69. The Iowa Indians may have joined the Hogas and crossed the Mississippi with them. Other accounts state that the Iowa first met and joined the Indian migrants on the Lower Missouri or at a place on Des Moines River. =Upstream= The main body of the Hoga followed the Mississippi north. They would in time separate and become the Osage, Kaw, Omaha and Ponca. One account says the large group reached the mouth of Missouri River and followed it. For a time, they lived in the area of present-day Gasconade and Osage county, Missouri. Eventually, the people continued the journey and reached Osage River. Again, the group experienced a division. Disagreements over the division of animal sinews (used as threads and strings) caused this split.La Flesche, Francis (2010): Traditions of the Osage: Stories Collected and Translated by Francis La Flesche. Mexico Press. Some decided to explore the unknown country by way of Osage River and became respectively the Osage Indians and the Kaw or Kansa Indians. The Kaws may have gathered in a group, turned back, and followed the Missouri north to Kansas River, where they settled.Wedel, Waldo R. (1946): \\"The Kansa Indians\\". Transactions of the Kansas Academy of Science. Vo. 49 (Jun. 1946), No. 1, pp. 1-35. Later, the Osage and the Quapaw in Arkansas turned enemies despite the common origin. Also the Omaha in Nebraska would in time be considered hostile by the Osage.Scherer, Johanna Cohan: \\"The 1852 Omaha Indian Delegation Daguerreotypes. A Preponderance of Evidence.\\" Nebraska History. Vol. 78 (Fall 1997), No. 3, pp. 116-121. The Omaha, walking away from the Osage/Kaw group in \\"an angry mood\\", kept travelling the southern banks of the Missouri. They crossed to the other shore at the mouth of Chariton River. Two different routes to the pipestone quarry in Minnesota are put forward. One account claims the people first followed Chariton River and later Des Moines River (green route on the map). The other version has the people travelling up the Missouri and apparently later the Big Sioux River (orange route on the map). A more different migration story has the people going up the Mississippi instead of the Missouri (yellow route on the map). Standing on the shore of Des Moines River, they made up their mind to follow this tributary to its source. From here, they moved on and found the catlinite quarry. The Omaha battled with different Dakotas for ownership to the pipestone quarry in present Minnesota =A settlement near the Pipestone Quarry= The people found the red, workable catlinite in the area. They made the head to a sacred pipe of a big piece, later to become a part of the Ponca's tribal pipe. (The Ponca finished the long migration to the northeastern Nebraska before they finally made the stem to the pipe). The people built a village near Big Sioux River, maybe at the Blood Run SiteThiessen, Thomas D. (2004): \\"Blood Run Site\\". Plains Anthropologist, Vol. 49 (Nov. 2004), No. 192, pp. 355-380. in the northwestern Iowa. They came under attack from different groups of Sioux (Dakota) and abandoned the settlement after a major battle. The John K. Bear winter count of the lower Yanktonai Sioux says for the year 1685, \\"The Santee Dakota fought with the Omaha tribe\\". Howard, James H.: \\"Yanktonai Ethnohistory and the John K. Bear Winter Count\\". Plains Anthropologist. Vol. 21 (Aug. 1976), No. 73. Memoir 11, part 2, pp. 1-78. The many dead were buried in a wide mound near the village. In 1879, Yankton Sioux chief Strikes-the-Ree ascribed the war to conflicting claims to the pipestone quarry. =On the move again= Detail of French cartographer De L'isle 1718 map with points of interest made light. Lower right: The villages of \\"Maha\\" (the Omaha Indians) extends up \\"R[iviere] du Rocher\\" or Rock River, assumed present-day Big Sioux River. On the east side of the river is an Iowa village. Upper left: \\"Les Omaha Nation errante\\" (The wandering Omaha Nation) moved around in present-day South Dakota. This may in fact be the separated Ponca, not yet recognized as a tribe in its own right The people went south. Then, they seem to have headed north by following the Missouri upstream. They cut the wood to a sacred pole at a lake. Some Omahas, but not all, identified it as Lake Andes in South Dakota. This may have been sometime in the last quarter of the 17th century. Probably, the people then moved back to a place near the mouth of the Big Sioux. Living east of the Missouri, they harassed the Arikara Indians residing on the western shores. In time, the Omaha settled in a new village on the Big Sioux and made peace here with the Arikara (and the Cheyenne and the Oto as well). The Arikara women taught the Omaha to build earth lodges. The Big Sioux River village came under Indian attack. The Omaha, still followed by the Iowa, left the hostile area for good. All travel was yet on foot. Information given by the Frenchman Pierre-Charles Le Sueur \\"strongly suggest\\" the presence of Omahas somewhere on the Upper Big Sioux at least before the end of the 17th century. After 1714, French sources locate the Omaha Indians other places. =The Ponca become a tribe= The Upstream People went north again and crossed the Missouri at the mouth of White River in South Dakota. Some evidence point to a temporary halt of the migration here.Johnson, Craig M. (2007): A Chronology of Middle Missouri Plains Village Sites. Smithsonian Contributions to Anthropology. Number 47. Washington. It seems, the Ponca clan of the Omaha became more independent in the new surroundings. While it explored the land westward, either as a clan or as a distinct tribe, the rest of the Omahas and the Iowa stayed in the White River belt. The Ponca made it to the Black Hills. They returned to the Omaha and the Iowa and the three groups started a joint travel down the Missouri. The Ponca settled near the city of Niobrara, Nebraska. The Omaha and the Iowa continued downstream, but remained in the future state of Nebraska. This final and lasting split may have taken place between 1714 and 1718. The Ponca would undertake long journeys from the villages to the Black Hills and even further west. On one trip to the Black Hills, they fought the \\"Padouca\\" - either Plains Apache or Comanche Indians. Later it came to a truce, and the Ponca received the first horses from the Padouca. The whites mention the Ponca tribe for the first time in 1785. A Spanish document gives the Ponca homeland accurately as the northeastern corner of Nebraska.

It stars Steve Carell, Bryan Cranston, and Laurence Fishburne as three Vietnam War veterans who reunite after one of their sons is killed in the Iraq War. Ponicsan's novel Last Flag Flying is a sequel to his 1970 novel The Last Detail, which covered the same characters earlier in their lives. For that reason, Last Flag Flying has been described as an unofficial sequel to the earlier novel's 1973 film adaptation, The Last Detail. Principal photography began in Pittsburgh in November 2016. The film had its world premiere at the New York Film Festival on September 28, 2017, and was released in the United States by Amazon Studios and Lionsgate on November 3, 2017. Plot In 2003, Larry \\"Doc\\" Shepherd visits the bar of Sal Nealon, a former Marine that he served with in Vietnam. Sal willingly joins Doc on an impromptu drive where Doc reveals that he's also tracked down another friend from Vietnam, now-Reverend Richard Mueller. Sal and Doc are invited to dinner with the Muellers, where Doc reveals he is recently widowed and just lost his only son in Iraq. He admits he tracked down Sal and Mueller in the hope that they would accompany him to collect his son Larry Jr's body and take him to his scheduled burial. Sal agrees, though Mueller is hesitant, claiming that Sal and Doc represent a dark period in his life. His wife urges him to do it, so he reluctantly agrees to accompany him. Along the way, Sal and Mueller clash over their differing philosophies and their mutual guilt over their past; both Sal and Mueller (nicknamed the Mauler) indulged in alcohol, drugs and prostitutes while on deployment, and on one occasion used up the entire supply of then-19 year old Doc's painkillers, which led to a needlessly painful death for one of their fellow Marines and a bad conduct discharge (BCD) for Doc. Sal, who has no social filter from a head injury from the war, continually gets under Mueller's skin for having found religion, whilst Mueller expresses frustration at Sal's lack of maturity. At Dover Air Force Base, Doc requests to view the maimed body of his son, against the advice of Mueller and LtCol Willits. During the viewing, LCpl Charlie Washington, Larry's close friend, reveals to Sal and Mueller that Larry Jr had been killed while shopping at an Iraqi market, contrary to the official story of dying while fighting heroically; Sal reveals the truth to a disillusioned Doc, who refuses the Arlington National Cemetery burial and insists on giving Larry Jr a civilian burial. Willits orders Washington to accompany the body and coerce Doc into changing his mind about having his deceased son buried in civilian clothing. Sal, Mueller and Doc begin a long road trip back home, waylaid by the Department of Homeland Security (alerted by their cash rental, vague destination and Mueller's praying) and a missed train in New York. Over the course of the journey, the clashing becomes more good natured and Doc begins to boost in the company of his friends. Sal asks Doc to move to his town to run the bar with him, and the three purchase their first cell phones to stay in contact. Their trip takes them to Boston where Sal insists that they meet the mother of Jimmy Hightower, the fellow Marine who died painfully without morphine. When they arrive, they realise that Mrs. Hightower was given the same story about her son's heroism that Doc was given about Larry Jr; Sal decides not to deny her the story and the trio pretend to have been the men that Hightower saved when he was killed in action. The group return to Portsmouth for Larry Jr's funeral, and where Washington persuades Doc that Larry's civilian suit will be too small and he should be buried in his dress blues. At the burial, Sal and Mueller wear their uniforms, and participate in the flag-folding ceremony. Back at Doc's house, Charlie gives Doc a letter from Larry, claiming not to have read it. Doc reads Larry's wishes; to be buried beside his mother wearing his uniform. Doc smiles as Larry thanks him for being a great father.

Language Yandruwandha is a generic term referring to a number of dialects, Yawarrawarrka, Nhirppi, Matja, Parlpamardramardra, Ngananhina, Ngapardajdhirri and Ngurawola. It belongs to the Karna group of Karnic languages The best known version is that recorded by Gavan Breen from informants in Innamincka. Country The Yandruwandha ranged over an estimated 10,900 sq. miles of their tribal lands, which extended, according to Norman Tindale, from an area south of Cooper Creek, namely from Innamincka to Carraweena. This area also included Strzelecki Creek. History The Yandruwandha played a significant role in key moments of the Burke and Wills expedition. Oral lore conserved among them, according to a descendant, Aaron Paterson, has it that William John Wills, who recorded some of their words, made a good impression on the elders, who provided him with shelter in a walpa shared with an as yet uninitiated youth. While Burke and Will died, the only man to survive, John King, did so because he found sanctuary with the Yandruwandha, among whom he was eventually found by Edwin Welch, a surveyor with Alfred William Howitt, who had been dispatched to find the missing explorers. Many fell victims to the 1919 flu pandemic. Customs They practiced male circumcision. Native title The Yandruwandha Yawarrawarrka filed a petition to have their land rights recognized in 1988. In 2015, their native title was determined by a Federal Court over some 40,000 square kilometres of the outback, covering pastoral leases, and including Coongie Lakes National Park, the Innamincka Regional Reserve and the Strzelecki Regional Reserve. Notable people * Murtee Johnny (born c.1888-died Adelaide 1979) was the last member of the Yandruwanda of the Strzelecki Track, many of whom died in the flu pandemic that spread through the area in 1919.

She was also an artist who created a series of cast-bronze sculptures of WASP pilots for various World War II memorial sites. Education and personal life Dorothy \\"Dot\\" Swain was born near Asheville, North Carolina, to Mozelle Stringfield Swain, a concert pianist, and John Edward Swain, a lawyer. Swain got her bachelor's degree from Randolph-Macon Woman's College (1936) and went on to study art at the New York Art Students League. In the 1950s, she got her master's degree in art from Scripps College. In the late 1940s, she married Albert Z. Lewis, with whom she had a son, Albert Z. Lewis, Jr. Aviation career Lewis got her airplane pilot's license in 1941 and then spent some months working for Piper Aircraft in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania. In 1942, she was one of 10 women chosen for a special flight instructor training program established by aviation pioneer Phoebe Omlie. After receiving her commercial pilot and ground instructor ratings, she went on to train four classes of naval aviators. She then joined the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) program, where she both taught trainee pilots and herself flew fighters and bombers on maintenance and training missions. Aircraft she flew included the Bell P-63 Kingcobra, Martin B-26 Marauder, and Curtiss P-40 Warhawk. She remained in the Air Force reserve until her discharge in 1957. After the war, Lewis worked as chief flight instructor at the airport in Daytona Beach, Florida. She also took part in air shows like the 1st All Women's Airshow in Tampa, Florida (1947). In 2010, Lewis was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal at a special ceremony commemorating the ground-breaking achievements of WASPs in World War II. She has also been designated one of Women in Aviation International's Pioneers of Aviation. Art career Lewis eventually moved to Arizona, where she taught for more than two decades at the Orme School, a college-preparatory high school situated on a cattle ranch near the town of Mayer. In addition to science, history, and art, she taught flying and horseback riding. She established a local Fine Arts Festival that is still active. Lewis worked in many media, including painting, drawing, printmaking, ceramics, and sculpture. She was commissioned to paint the official portrait of U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, which hangs in the U.S. Department of Justice. She also created a series of cast-bronze sculptures of \\"The WASP Trainee,\\" a young woman in a flight suit striding looking skyward with the inscription \\"We Live in the Wind and Sand and our Eyes are on the Stars\\" on the base, placed at various World War II memorial sites, including those in the U.S. Air Force Academy's Honor Court, at The High Ground in Neillsville, Wisconsin, at the National WASP Museum in Sweetwater, Texas, and at the College Park Aviation Museum in Maryland. The bronze statue on the Air Force Academy Honor Court in Colorado Springs stands near another statue that commemorates the African American Tuskegee airmen. She created a bust of aviator Jacqueline Cochran for the Jacqueline Cochran Regional Airport in Thermal, California, and an oil painting of Cochran for the 99s Museum of Women Pilots at the headquarters of the Ninety-Nines (the International Organization of Women Pilots) in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. She illustrated the book We Were WASPs by her fellow aviator Winifred Wood. Lewis later moved to California, where she taught at the Idyllwild School of Music and the Arts. She lived in Fern Valley near Idyllwild, where she died in 2013. References Further reading *Cooper, Ann L. How High She Flies: Dorothy Swain Lewis, WASP of WWII, Horsewoman, Artist, Teacher.

Characteristics  Eastern Biniac naveta has a circular layout with an es de planta circular, with the outer wall battering inwards. This wall has horizontal stone locks placed in a horizontal position, following the cyclopean masonry technique, which can be found in many other prehistoric buildings in Menorca. The building's entrance is located at the southern side.

The roof consists of a set of horizontal stone slabs. The building's dimensions are: external length 11,10 m; external width 10,70 m; interior length 3,90 m; interior width 2,30 m. It has been discussed whether this type of navetas, which are called \\"intermediate navetas\\", would be half-way between megalithic tombs and long layout navetas, the latter being more recent. In 1960's archaeologist María Luisa Serra Belabre carried out a brief excavation project on its upper part. No archaeological remains have been found in the chamber either, since it was reused as a cattle shelter for many years and, for this reason, all the sediment inside this building was removed. However, thanks to excavations carried out in other navetas, we know that these buildings were used to place the deceased members of a family or a small community. The bodies were accompanied with a set of objects or grave goods related to their beliefs about the afterlife. Chronological framework:1500-1000 BC. (Bronze Age).

As the municipal painter of his hometown Colmar and the creator of a major altarpiece for the prestigious St Martin's Church, he was an important representative of the Upper Rhenish school of painting of the mid-15th century and a probable master of Martin Schongauer. Life and work Isenmann's dates of birth and death are uncertain. He may have been born around 1410. The Unterlinden Museum of his hometown indicates that he was active around 1430 and died between 1484 and 1490; however the Bibliothèque nationale de France states that Isenmann died on 18 January 1472. Isenmann was first recorded as a painter in 1432. He decorated the municipal counting board in 1433 and became a burgher of Colmar in 1435 or 1436. Nothing is known about his teachers but it is assumed that he may have been apprenticed either to Hans Hirtz of Strasbourg or Konrad Witz of Basel; his art also shows the influence of Rogier van der Weyden and his school. After 1450, Isenmann is registered as an alderman (Schöffe) and in 1461, he is one of the main organizers of a Mystery play during Corpus Christi. In 1462, Isenmann received a commission to paint a set of panels (oil on fir wood) for the high altar of St Martin's Church, Colmar's main place of worship, and he delivered the finished altarpiece in 1465. Seven of these panels, some mutilated, have survived after the altarpiece was dismantled in 1720 and since 1853 have been housed at the Unterlinden Museum. The contract from 1462, detailing the commission of the altarpiece, survives and is kept in the municipal archive of Colmar. It was signed on 21 June 1462; the painter was guaranteed a payment of 500 guilder and requested to complete work in two years, i. e. in 1464. It is not known if the delay in the actual delivery did cost the painter anything. Between 1466 and 1469, Isenmann may have been the teacher of fellow Colmarian, Martin Schongauer, whom he acquainted with van der Weyden's paintings. He is also assumed to have taught Martin's brother Ludwig Schongauer. A house in 34, rue des Marchands in Colmar bears the inscription \\"Zum grienen hus, 1435. Ancienne demeure du maître-peintre Caspar Isenmann\\" (At the green house, 1435, former dwelling of the master painter Caspar Isenmann).

It is considered to be a major state-protected landmark despite being non-actively used nowadays.  Overview  \\"Carev most\\" means \\"Tsar's Bridge\\" and it had been named after Russian Emperor Alexander III, who financed construction of the object in the year 1894. It crosses Zeta river and its valley. It is remarkable for its significant length (270 m) and many spans (18)—the highest span measures 13 meters. The bridge is much wider than the modern river channel: this is because of presence of a large backwater pool there in the past, which was drained in the 20th century in times of Josip Broz Tito. Nowadays the river's channel is straightened and strengthened by concrete in this area, so only one span actually crosses the river. Under this (the highest) span nowadays a little pedestrian doubling bridge exists. A local road passes by the bridge, it connects Nikšić (to the north) and mountainous and rural areas to the south with places such as Pandurica castle and Ostrog Monastery. The road's general direction is similar to more modern European route E762 and Nikšić–Podgorica railway. They are situated slightly to the West and go through mountains via several tunnels. Northern end of the bridge's road is connected to the mound ~12 m high and ~600 m long, coming to Nikšić southern suburbs.  History  Rudolf Mosinger The bridge, made of hewn stones, was constructed in the area called Slivlje in 1894 under the ruling of Montenegrin prince Nikola Petrović-Njegoš (later the King), who was in good relations with Russian Romanov dynasty. In 1877 Niksic was liberated from Turks, and in 1878 Old Herzegovina was adjoined to Montenegro by demand of Russia according to Treaty of Berlin. Prince Nikola wanted to securely connect newly acquired Nikšić area to the rest of the country. He asked Russian Emperor Alexander III for help to build a road to Podgorica, and the bridge: the Emperor agreed and assigned necessary amount of grain for that. The project became the Montenegro's biggest at the time, and it was developed by famed architect Josip Slade from Trogir. The construction had begun on May 23, 1894 with participation of State Council head Bojo Petrović-Njegoš. The chief constructor was Miloš Lepetić, the works were accomplished by commercial builders and by the military. Prince Nikola ordered that each pillar of the bridge contained a gold coin within. The construction was completed in record 6-month period. The day of the opening, October 20, 1894, coincided with the day of the death of Alexander III. The bridge got the official name \\"The bridge of Tsar Alexander III\\". Initially there was a large backwater in the Zeta river valley, that's why the bridge became so long. In the 20th century the backwater was drained, the river channel was straightened, the banks were strengthened by concrete. Only one span crossed the river actually from then on; and a small pedestrian bridge was constructed there right under that span.

He specializes in free will and moral responsibility, philosophy of mind, philosophy of religion, and in the work of Immanuel Kant. Life and career Derk Pereboom was born in the village of Pesse, near Hoogeveen, the Netherlands, on February 6, 1957. He received his BA in philosophy at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 1978, where his teachers included Alvin Plantinga and Nicholas Wolterstorff. He earned his PhD at University of California, Los Angeles in 1985, with a dissertation on Immanuel Kant's theory of mental representation under the supervision of Robert Merrihew Adams and Tyler Burge. He was an assistant professor in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Vermont from 1985 to 1991, associate professor from 1991 to 1997, and professor from 1997 to 2007. he has been professor in the Sage School of Philosophy at Cornell University. he is the subject co-editor on topics in the philosophy of action for the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, and he has also written for the encyclopedia. Philosophical work =Free will= Pereboom's position in the free will debate is known as hard incompatibilism. He maintains that due to general facts about the nature of the universe, we lack the free will required for the aspect of moral responsibility at issue in the traditional debate. That is, whether our actions are deterministically or indeterministically caused, we will not have the control in action required for our deserving to be blamed or punished for immoral decisions, and to be praised or rewarded for those that are morally exemplary. Pereboom nevertheless proposes that forward-looking aspects of blaming and praising, those that aim, for instance, at improving character and reconciliation in relationships, are compatible with our lacking free will. He also contends that denying free will is likely to diminish anger and the desire to punish, and in this way can benefit human relationships, both personal and societal. In this respect his position is inspired by the view of Baruch Spinoza, who argues in his Ethics that denying free will would enhance the quality of human life.Spinoza, Baruch: Ethics, Part II, Prop. 49, Scholium. Trans: Edwin Curley. London: Penguin, 1996. =Philosophy of mind= The physicalist position Pereboom proposes in philosophy of mind develops two responses to the hard problem of consciousness, which is explicated by Frank Cameron Jackson's knowledge argument and David Chalmers' conceivability argument against physicalism. The first response invokes the possibility that introspective representations fail to represent mental properties as they are in themselves; specifically, that introspection represents phenomenally conscious properties as having certain characteristic qualitative natures which these properties actually lack. This position is related to the more general illusionism about consciousness advanced by Daniel Dennett and to an illusionist view set out by neuroscientist Michael Graziano. The second response draws on the Russellian monist proposal that currently unknown fundamental intrinsic properties provide categorical bases for known physical properties and also yield an account of consciousness. There are non- physicalist versions of this position, but some are amenable to physicalism, and Pereboom highlights such views in his treatment.Derk Pereboom, Consciousness and the Prospects of Physicalism, New York: Oxford University Press, 2011, Chapters 1-6. Pereboom defends a version of nonreductive physicalism, a view proposed by Hilary Putnam in the 1960s, according to which types of mental states are not identical to types of states at lower levels, such as the neural and the microphysical. The nonreductive position he defends departs from others in that it also rejects all token-identity (i.e., specific-instance-identity) claims for the relation between mental states and states at lower levels. The relation between the mental and the microphysical is material constitution, with the provision that this relation is not to be explicated by the notion of identity. But mental properties are nevertheless identical to higher-level compositional properties, properties that things have by virtue of the natures of their parts and relations among them. Pereboom contends that this view secures genuine mental causation, by contrast with the more commonly endorsed functionalist alternative. In this respect his position is perhaps a compromise with type-identity theory.Derk Pereboom, Consciousness and the Prospects of Physicalism, New York, Oxford University Press, 2011, Chapters 7-8. Still, his view is not a reductive identity theory, since he holds that mental compositional properties are multiply realizable at any level more fundamental than the mental (e.g., the neural).

The Second Decemvirate seemed to be made up just as much by plebeians, like Spurius Oppius, as it was of patricians. At the instigation of Crassus, the decemvirs illegally held on to power the following year, and refused to allow the election of consuls.Cicero, De Republica, II. 61 In 449 BC, a war escalated with the Sabines setting up in Eretum and with the Aequi fortified on Mount Algidus.

This caused her to be executed by her own father, Lucius Verginius. The soldiers in both armies mutinied and elected twenty military tribunes in order to command in the place of the decemvirs. The soldiers returned to Rome and set up on the Aventine then joined together on Monte Sacro. Under pressure by the soldiers and the plebeians, the decemvirs resigned.

He played football at LSU, and was signed by the Philadelphia Eagles as an undrafted free agent in 2016. College career Gordon began attending LSU in 2012 and played in 13 games as a freshman, starting none. As a freshman, he played on offense, as a blocking right end, and on special teams. The following year, as a sophomore, he started 12 games and played in all 13, leading all LSU tight ends with six catches for 88-yards. He returned in 2014 and started all 13 regular season contests, but was mainly used as a blocking tight end, paving the way for Leonard Fournette. He returned as the starting tight end for the third consecutive season and played until he injured his achilles in Week 3. He attempted to return in Week 7 against the Florida Gators, but injured his achilles again, this time ending his season. He applied to the NCAA for a hardship waiver to play a fifth-year but was ultimately denied. Professional career =Pre-draft= Gordon wasn't invited to the NFL combine and was unable to participate at LSU's Pro Day due to his Achilles injury. He was projected to go undrafted, as most blocking tight ends from run based collegiate offenses do. His original plan was to return to LSU, but after the NCAA denied his request for a fifth-year, he announced himself for the draft with just a few days notice. With only a few days to impress NFL teams, Gordon threw an impromptu workout for NFL scouts and team representatives. =Philadelphia Eagles= Gordon went undrafted during the 2016 NFL Draft and was signed immediately following it by the Philadelphia Eagles. He began his career with the Eagles as a tight end and was given number 83. After going through OTA's and training camp, it was reported that the Philadelphia Eagles were switching Gordon from tight end to offensive guard and changed his number to 69. On September 3, 2016, the Philadelphia Eagles announced that Gordon had made their 53-man roster as an offensive tackle after showing promise during training camp. He showed versatility throughout the preseason and played fullback, tight end, offensive tackle, and guard. Since arriving in Philadelphia, he has been mentored by All-Pro teammate Jason Peters, to whom he has drawn comparisons. Both players were used primarily as blocking tight ends in college, went undrafted, and were subsequently switched to offensive tackle in the pros. On September 2, 2017, Gordon was waived by the Eagles and was signed to the practice squad the next day. He was released by the Eagles on December 8, 2017. =Kansas City Chiefs= On December 12, 2017, Gordon was signed to the Kansas City Chiefs' practice squad. He signed a reserve/future contract with the Chiefs on January 10, 2018. During the first preseason game of 2018, Gordon suffered a shoulder injury which kept him out the entire season. He was placed on injured reserve on August 11, 2018. He was released on March 25, 2019. =Carolina Panthers= On March 26, 2019, Gordon was claimed off waivers by the Carolina Panthers. He was placed on injured reserve on August 10, 2019 with a shoulder injury. Personal life Gordon was raised by his parents, Rita and Bernard Jarrow. His cousin, Tyson Jackson, was a defensive end who plays for the Atlanta Falcons, and his other cousin, Quinn Johnson, was a fullback who played in the NFL for six years for the Green Bay Packers and Tennessee Titans. On March 30, 2019 Gordon married his long time girlfriend Mariah Davis.

It examines Kwanzaa from the perspective of toddler Susie Carmichael during a visit from her great-aunt. Susie, her friends—Tommy Pickles, Chuckie and Kimi Finster, and Phil and Lil DeVille—and family learn about the holiday from Aunt T., but Susie becomes depressed after thinking she is the only member of her family not to achieve greatness. Aunt T. consoles her by sharing her memories using a scrapbook. The episode concludes with Susie realizing she still has plenty of time in her life to discover what makes her great. Anthony Bell directed the episode from a script by Lisa D. Hall, Jill Gorey, and Barbara Herndon. It was produced as part of Nickelodeon's commitment to feature cultural diversity in its programming. Rugrats was one of the first mainstream television shows to feature Kwanzaa. Critics compared it to similar holiday episodes by As Told by Ginger and The Proud Family. \\"A Rugrats Kwanzaa\\" was first broadcast on December 11, 2001. A picture book entitled The Rugrats' First Kwanzaa was adapted from the script. The episode was released on VHS in 2001, and it was later included in other home media releases. \\"A Rugrats Kwanzaa\\" was praised by critics for its representation of the holiday and the voice acting; there was a mixed response to its commercialism. Cree Summer, who voices Susie, earned a nomination for an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Performance by a Youth at the 34th NAACP Image Awards for her role in the episode. Plot Toddler Susie Carmichael is visited by her great-aunt T. on Christmas. Aunt T. wants to celebrate Kwanzaa instead with Susie's family—her parents Lucy and Randy and older siblings Alisa, Buster, and Edwin. The Carmichaels do not normally observe the holiday, and Susie has never heard of it. Aunt T. describes it as honoring the legacy and greatness of their ancestors. Susie's friends—Tommy Pickles, Chuckie and Kimi Finster, and Phil and Lil DeVille—are invited to the Carmichaels' home as part of the festivities. Susie feels inferior to the rest of her family after Aunt T. congratulates them on their accolades. Aunt T. decides to hold the Karamu early to bring the family together. She gives Susie and her siblings presents, though Susie is disappointed to receive a scrapbook. Susie is not assigned a role in the family's preparations for Karamu, leading her to believe she is inferior to the rest of her family for never winning an award. Following the babies' encouragement, Susie tries to emulate her siblings, including acting as class president, conducting scientific experiments, and playing soccer. When Susie fails at these tasks, Tommy advises her to find something special for herself. Susie unsuccessfully attempts to create a clay sculpture of her head as a gift to Aunt T., though her great-aunt reminds Susie that greatness is not measured by prizes. During a power outage, Aunt T. uses the scrapbook to share her memories with the children. Aunt T. and her husband Charles had met Martin Luther King Jr. while driving to the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. On another occasion, Lucy performed \\"This Little Light of Mine\\" as her first solo in church despite nearly being too afraid to sing.

Production  alt=An image of a black man wearing a multi-colored dress shirt. The 23-minute episode was written by Lisa D. Hall, Jill Gorey, and Barbara Herndon and directed by Anthony Bell. It was also known as \\"A Rugrats Kwanzaa Special\\" and \\"Rugrats: The Kwanzaa Special\\".Meehan (2005): p. 87McCann (2009): p. 146 Nickelodeon's senior vice president for production Marjorie Cohn identified Rugrats as the \\"natural home\\" for a Kwanzaa episode; the series had previously shown holiday specials on Christmas and Hanukkah. Cohen explained the network included cultural diversity and representation in its programming to remain true to its \\"commitment to being there for all kids\\". Nickelodeon president Cyma Zarghami said that the network followed \\"the idea that the kids on our programs look like the kids who watch it\\", and further explained: \\"Diversity is something we celebrate every day, and we believe kids are everyday heroes\\". Irma P. Hall, who guest-starred as Aunt T., praised Rugrats for introducing Kwanzaa to a larger audience, and said she often talked about the holiday with her non-black friends. Discussing the importance of the episode, Hall said: \\"One thing that 9-11 taught us is that we really need to know as much as possible about other people's cultures. ... Getting to know about all these different holidays that people celebrate, it helps to reinforce the fact that we are more alike than different.\\" Other guest appearances in the episode included Kevin Michael Richardson as Martin Luther King Jr., Kimberly Brooks as the younger version of Lucy Carmichael, and Bill Cobbs as Uncle Charles. According to Mental Floss, Rugrats was one of the first shows to focus on Kwanzaa in mainstream television. Critics compared \\"A Rugrats Kwanzaa\\" to episodes from As Told by Ginger and The Proud Family, which aired the same year. An Associated Press contributor wrote that the Kwanzaa-centric storylines in Rugrats and The Proud Family helped to draw attention to the holiday. The Orlando Sentinels Tammy Carter felt Rugrats and As Told By Ginger had focused on Kwanzaa and Hanukkah, respectively, to expand holiday programming beyond Christmas. While also discussing the episode's educational value, The Christian Science Monitors M. S. Mason thought \\"A Rugrats Kwanzaa\\" was used to further develop Susie as a character.  Broadcast history and release  \\"A Rugrats Kwanzaa\\" was originally broadcast in the United States at 8:30 p.m. Eastern Time on December 11, 2001, on Nickelodeon, and repeated on December 15 and 26. The same year, author Stephanie Greene adapted the episode's script into the picture book The Rugrats' First Kwanzaa, published by Simon Spotlight and Nickelodeon. Greene used misspelled words, including \\"Kwonzo\\", \\"eggsackly\\", and \\"imbentor\\", to represent the babies' dialogue. Segundo Garcia drew the illustrations. The book is intended for children between the ages of four and eight.Blass (2005): pp. 185186 \\"A Rugrats Kwanzaa\\" has been included on Rugrats home media releases. In 2001, Paramount Pictures released the special on VHS;Craddock (2006): p. 2443 the tape also includes the episodes \\"And the Winner Is...\\" and \\"Cooking with Susie\\" as two \\"bonus cartoons\\". \\"A Rugrats Kwanzaa\\" was made available on the Rugrats, Holiday Collection! and the Turkey and Mistletoe DVDs. Although Viacom released the episode as part of Rugrats season seven DVD, the iTunes Store put it with the show's eighth season instead. The episode was included in the Rugrats, The Complete Series release. It was made available to stream on numerous video on demand services, including Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, and Google Play. In December 2003, Nickelodeon played \\"A Rugrats Kwanzaa\\" during its \\"Nickmas\\" television marathon. The network included two clips from the episode on NickRewind's YouTube account. The flashback of Lucy singing at church was uploaded on December 28, 2016; the segment involving Martin Luther King Jr. was uploaded on January 16, 2017 to commemorate his birthday. \\"A Rugrats Kwanzaa\\" was screened as part of the 14th annual Kwanzaa Observance Program in Chicago, Illinois, and at a separate event at the African Burial Ground National Monument in December 2017. The episode was also shown as at a 2019 event at the Paley Center for Media, along with \\"A Rugrats Chanukah\\"; the center has included the episode in its collection of African-American comedy.  Critical response  Critics praised Rugrats for introducing Kwanzaa to a wider audience. According to Den of Geek and Blavity, the series had become known and well-received for celebrating a diverse set of holidays. A writer for TheJournal.ie believed \\"A Rugrats Kwanzaa\\" might be some children's only experiences with the holiday; in a 2017 retrospective review of Rugrats, Bustle's Madeleine Aggeler commended its holiday specials for not talking down to these younger viewers. The Los Angeles Times Lee Margulies said \\"A Rugrats Kwanzaa\\" had a \\"special resonance for African American viewers\\" since it was rooted in broader concepts related to Kwanzaa, as shown through Susie's insecurities, rather than a lecture on African American history. In a similar sentiment, Ted Cox, writing for the Daily Herald, appreciated how Kwanzaa's seven core principles were represented by Aunt T.'s actions rather than dialogue. The Hollywood Reporters Deborah Holmes praised the episode's respect for the \\"legacy of blacks\\", noting that it encompasses Kwanzaa's message of every person, regardless of stature, being able to contribute to society. Children's literature scholar Cathlena Martin cited Rugrats' emphasis on family and friends as encouraging a more \\"positive awareness of race and culture\\". The Daily Telegraph's David Rennie wrote that Rugrats contributed to the commercialization of Kwanzaa; the holiday's creator Maulana Karenga was critical of \\"the corporate world's move to penetrate and dominate the Kwanzaa market\\". On the other hand, Kristen Lopez, writing for Livingly Media, believed the series' holiday programming had successfully \\"bridge[d] the gap between telling a heartfelt story and acting as a marketing tool\\". The voice acting was the subject of praise. Cree Summer, who voices Susie, received a nomination for a NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Performance by a Youth at the 34th NAACP Image Awards for her performance in the episode. Margulies praised Irma P. Hall for \\"energetically voic[ing]\\" her character, and Holmes wrote Hall and Summer were \\"great\\" and \\"delightful\\" in their roles, respectively.

It is situated in a hilly area of the same name on the bank of the river Zeta. It is a cultural monument of national significance.  History  The castle was originally built in 1367 by Stracimir Balšić, the Lord of Zeta principality. The area of Pandurica belonged then to Upper Zeta region of the principality, and in 1362 it was included in Balšić family possession. The Pandurica castle, which was named after the area, began to be used to control mountain trail and Zeta river ford. In 1473 Upper Zeta was granted by ruler Ivan Crnojević to his duke called Bodgan, who was the founder and leader of Pješivci tribe. The southern rim of Nikšić valley along Zeta served as border between land of tribe's Nikcevici family and Ottoman Empire, which occupied land around Nikšić (then-called Onogošt). Trade route was established between the lands, and Pandurica castle was then used to control this route. Turks were attacking the castle regularly, but it was re-built each time. There are suggestions that the area near castle was actively re-constructed between 1500 and 1600. In the 16th century the Ostrog Monastery was founded in south- eastern mountains along the trail; so Pandurica castle begun to serve as a security cordon for the monastery. In 1877 Niksic town was liberated from Turks by the forces of Prince Nikola Petrović-Njegoš (later the King). In 1878 Old Herzegovina was adjoined to Montenegro by demand of Russia. To connect new territories to mainland Montenegro and its capital Podgorica, it was decided to build a new road and construct a bridge over Zeta in about 1 km near Pandurica castle. The river was very wide there, so the bridge turned to be very lengthy. Prince Nikola asked Russian Emperor Alexander III for help: he agreed and assigned resources to build the road, that went near the castle, and to construct the massive 18-span monumental bridge, the Carev Most, now considered one of Montenegro's main landmarks. As of 2014, the castle and adjacent territories still belonged to Nikcevici family of Pješivci tribe. Nowadays archaeological and restoration works are underway in the castle. Year 2017 will mark Pandurica's 650th anniversary.

In Berlin, he served as a court painter and inspector of the Royal Art Gallery.  Biography  As early as 1803, he took drawing lessons at the Prussian Academy of Arts with Friedrich Georg Weitsch. After 1810, he received financial support from King Friedrich Wilhelm III and became the King's portrait painter. In the German Campaign of 1813, he was a volunteer army officer and was among the Prussian troops that entered Paris in 1814. On the recommendation of Karl August von Hardenberg, the King commissioned him to head the unit charged with recovering art treasures that had been looted from Germany during the French occupation. He was also part of the group authorized to acquire 158 paintings from the \\"Giustiniani Collection\\" at the Louvre. These, together with the recovered works, became the basis for the Royal Art Gallery (now part of the Gemäldegalerie). With the King's support, Ternite remained in Paris until 1823, continuing his artistic education in the workshops of Jacques-Louis David and Antoine-Jean Gros. He also produced illustrations for Mariä Krönung und die Wunder des heiligen Dominicus by August Wilhelm Schlegel and made several copies of works by Raphael. Upon returning to Germany, he made the acquaintance of Count , a collector of early Italian art, and accompanied him to Rome. There, he discovered some previously unknown frescoes by Andrea Mantegna. He later visited Naples and made drawings of the ruins at Herculaneum and Pompeii. These were published at the urging of the Archaeologist, Karl August Böttiger, although the interest in Greek and Roman art was diminishing at the time they appeared. In 1826, he went back to work as a portrait painter for the Royal Family and became a member of the Berlin Art Society. Shortly after, he was appointed \\"Master of the Royal Works of Art\\" (inspector of the Royal Collection); a position he held until his retirement in 1864. In 1860, he was awarded the Order of the Red Eagle. References  Further reading  * F. Furchheim: Bibliografia di Pompei; 2.

It is formed irreversibly from estrone in the liver and to a lesser extent in other tissues via 2-hydroxylation mediated by cytochrome P450 enzymes, mainly the CYP3A and CYP1A subfamilies. 2-OHE1 is the most abundant catechol estrogen in the body. 2-Hydroxyestrone is not significantly uterotrophic in bioassays, whereas other hydroxylated estrogen metabolites including 2-hydroxyestradiol, 16α-hydroxyestrone, estriol (16α-hydroxyestradiol), 4-hydroxyestradiol, and 4-hydroxyestrone all are. In addition, although not antiestrogenic in the uterus, 2-hydroxyestrone shows antiestrogenic effects on luteinizing hormone and prolactin levels. The lack of estrogenic or antiestrogenic activity of 2-hydroxyestrone in the uterus may be attributable to an extremely high metabolic clearance rate. When incubated at very high concentrations or in combination with a catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor to prevent its metabolism, 2-hydroxyestrone shows antiestrogenic effects in estrogen receptor-positive human breast cancer cells. 2-Hydroxyestrone dissociates from the estrogen receptors much more rapidly than does estradiol.

Early life and career Born in Piedmont in 1888, Antonio Legnani entered the Naval Academy in Leghorn in 1905.Dizionario Biografico Uomini della Marina 1861-1946. After graduating as an ensign in 1908, he served for a few years on battleships and cruisers, and in 1911-1912 he participated in the Italo-Turkish War as a sub-lieutenant aboard the hydrographic survey ship Staffetta, in Red Sea. During this war, Legnani was promoted to lieutenant and appointed executive officer of the gunboat Giuliana. In the first two years of World War I, Legnani served on several ships, mainly battleships, cruisers and auxiliary cruisers; he took part in the operations in Albania, obtaining a Silver Medal of Military Valor. In September 1917 he was given command of the submarine Argonauta, on board which he carried out 30 combat missions along the enemy coast, obtaining a second Silver Medal and two Bronze Medals of Military Valor. After the war, Legnani, who had become a lieutenant commander, interchange shore assignments in Aegean, first in the Castelrosso naval base and later in Lakki (Leros), and periods on submarines and destroyers. In 1926 he was promoted to commander and given command of the scout cruiser Venezia, after which in 1928 he became deputy chief of staff of the Northern Tyrrhenian Naval Department and in 1930 he was given command of the submarine Luciano Manara. In 1931 Legnani was assigned to the Office of chief of staff at the Ministry of the Navy, and in 1933 he was promoted to captain and given command of the light cruiser Alberico da Barbiano. He then became chief of staff of the 5th Naval Division and, in 1936, commanding officer of the heavy cruiser Pola. After another period at the Staff in the Ministry of the Navy, in 1937 Legnani was promoted to rear admiral and placed in command of the Regia Marina's submarine fleet, a position he held for two years; he also directed the clandestine submarine warfare during the Spanish Civil War, for which he was decorated with the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Savoy. In 1938, for reasons that would remain unknown, he suspended the development of the \\"ML\\" apparatus - an ancestor of the snorkel - on submarines of the Regia Marina, despite four years of trials having yielded positive results; Legnani also ordered the demolition of the \\"ML\\" apparatuses already produced up to that time.Giorgio Giorgerini, Uomini sul fondo. Storia del sommergibilismo italiano dalle origini a oggi, p. 128. The result was that Italian submarines were never equipped with snorkels until after the Second World War. In 1939 Legnani was promoted to the rank of vice admiral and given command of the 8th Naval Division (with flag on the light cruiser Luigi di Savoia Duca degli Abruzzi, which he still commanded when Italy entered World war II on 10 June 1940).  World War II  From June 1940 to June 1941 Legnani, as the commander of the 8th Naval Division, participated in the battles Calabria, Taranto and Cape Matapan, as well as in countering the British operations \\"Hats\\" (29 August-1 September 1940) and \\"MB 5\\" (29 September to 2 October 1940), aimed at supplying Malta. After leaving the command of the 8th Division, on 10 December 1941 he was appointed commander of the Italian submarine fleet (replacing Admiral Mario Falangola), a role that he kept after his promotion to admiral in 1942.Giorgio Giorgerini, Uomini sul fondo. Storia del sommergibilismo italiano dalle origini a oggi, p. 310. He directed Italian submarine operations in the Mediterranean until the 8 September 1943 armistice; in this period he was also decorated with the German Iron Cross second-class, as well as Officer's Cross of the Military Order of Savoy. An ardent supporter of the Fascist regime, after 8 September 1943 Legnani immediately decided to cooperate with the German forces, and adhered to the Italian Social Republic, being appointed its Secretary of State to the Navy on 23 September 1943 (the day of its foundation).Giorgio Giorgerini, Attacco dal mare. Storia dei mezzi d'assalto della Marina italiana, p. 297.

Written when the early 1990s banking crisis was deepest, the book argues for abandoning the general welfare state in Sweden, for sharp tax cuts, and for the rollback of the state's involvement in education, law, culture, and the media: > The Swedes are mentally handicapped and indoctrinated to believe that > politicians can create and guarantee welfare.Reinfeldt, F.: Det sovande > folket, Moderata ungdomsförbundet () (p. 52) In the first chapter the author presents a dystopian vision of the future. Later chapters detail the Moderates' plan of action, its implementation in daily life, and its moral basis. The last chapter presents examples from real life. After Reinfeldt became the leader of the Moderate Party in 2003, and Prime Minister in 2006, the book was often referred to by political opponents. Social Democratic leader Mona Sahlin at the 2009 party congress recommended reading the book, not as a book to be inspired by, but to understand the bourgeois ideology. In 2013 a theater group adapted Det sovande folket to the stage, which renewed discussion of the book.  Criticism  In 2014, Folkbladet published an article criticizing Reinfeldt for having denied authorship of the book. The book has been criticized for falsifying Swedish history. The extreme right-wing Nordfront criticized Reinfeldt for his \\"svenskfientlighet\\" (swede-phobia) in the book.

Based on a story by Georgi Gospodinov, the film tells the story of a girl who sees the past out of her left eye and the future from her right—and so is unable to live in the present. Montreal actress Caroline Dhavernas performed the narration for the film, in both its French and English language versions. The film incorporates music from Bulgarian musician and composer Kottarashky and is his and Ushev's fourth collaboration. Development Ushev has stated that the project began at Fontevraud Abbey in France, where he worked for a month on the story and was inspired by medieval drawing. He did fifty paintings during his stay in Maine- et-Loire, drawing inspiration from the Abbey's architecture and with the design of film's central character influenced by paintings of Eleanor of Aquitaine. Ushev was already working with a text by Gospodinov for an upcoming film when he and a group of friends had the idea of making \\"an omnibus out of some of his short stories.\\" While reading them, Ushev was captivated by the story of Blind Vaysha, which immediately struck him as being suited to his style of filmmaking. Production The film is animated on a Cintiq tablet in a linocut-style, a medium Ushev had worked with since the age of 12. Ushev sought to reproduce the visual artifacts of the linocut technique by never using the \\"Undo\\" command on his computer while drawing: \\"Because with linocut, once your hand carves it, it is gone. You cannot put the black back. This creates a natural feeling of the unpredictable, of mistakes and the holy imperfection of the image—which is the basis of every creation.\\" Ushev has estimated he did between 12,000 and 13,000 drawings for the film, which took him about six months to make. As with two of Ushev's earlier films, Drux Flux and Gloria Victoria, Blind Vaysha was produced as a 3D film. Reception Blind Vaysha had its world premiere at the 2016 Berlinale. It received both the Jury Award and Junior Jury Award at the 2016 Annecy International Animated Film Festival. In September 2016, the film received the Cartoon Network Award for Best Narrative Short Animation and the Canadian Film Institute Award for Best Canadian Animation at the Ottawa International Animation Festival. The film was also included in the list of Canada's Top Ten shorts of 2016, selected by a panel of filmmakers and industry professionals organized by TIFF and was part of The animation Showcase 2016. In March 2017, Blind Vaysha received the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television Award for Best Animated Short at 5th Canadian Screen Awards. It was also nominated for Best Animated Short at the 89th Academy Awards (lost to Pixar's Piper).2017Oscars.org Ushev stated that with 16 films to his credit to date, he had given up hope of ever being nominated for an Oscar because he worried that his films might be \\"too abstract, too avant garde, too elitist, too dark\\" for the Academy. He stated that upon hearing the news of his Oscar nomination, he had a strong emotional reaction: \\"When I heard the name of my film, I just stopped watching, because I fainted... I cried. At first I laughed and then I cried again. It's out of control.... It's all strange and exciting.\\" On February 26, upon the eve of the Oscars, public television in Ushev's native Bulgaria aired a dubbed version of the film, narrated by Teodora Duhovnikova. Virtual reality The 8-minute animated short will reportedly be adapted next into a virtual reality work by the NFB.

Since the MuDA is a small museum (but not only because of that), its administrators believe in the “less but better” maxim. Exhibitions shouldn’t be a clutter of things. They should instead display a carefully chosen selection of artworks, that will have space to unfold and be experienced. 2\\\\. Technology is at its very best when it is invisible. The MuDA doesn’t want to hold exhibitions where the art is only displayed on screens — visitors could just as well enjoy these contents at home. On the contrary, the MuDA encourages physical installations that appeal to multiple sensory organs. Building In 1959, the Migros Cooperative, Switzerland’s largest food retailer, bought about 50,000 m2 of land on which was erected, just two years later, one of Switzerland’s first high-rise building, the Herdern Hochhaus. The purpose of the 58-meter tall building was to provide logistics, distribution and storage space for their food delivery chain — including a ripening hall for all the bananas that were dispatched from there to all corners of Switzerland. Due to its industrial historical importance, the building was classified as a listed monument in 2012. That same year, after an internal reorganization, parts of the premises were left empty and a series of vacant spaces were made available for temporary usage.

From 1949 it was held at the Earl's Court Exhibition Centre in Earl's Court, London. The last show was held there in 2004; it was the last major livestock show in London.  History  The Smithfield Club Cattle Show was first held in December 1799, at Wootton's Livery Stables in Dolphin Yard, Smithfield, London. It was organised by the Smithfield Cattle and Sheep Society (later the Royal Smithfield Club), which had been founded at Smithfield in the previous year. By 1806 the show had moved to Sadler's Yard in Goswell Street, Islington. Sixty-one animals were shown. In 1839 it was moved to larger space, the Baker Street Horse Bazaar, where it lasted for four days and attracted some twenty or twenty-five thousand visitors. Attendance increased after members of the Royal Family began to attend. In 1862 the show moved to the new Agricultural Hall in Islington, London, which had been purpose-built for it by the Club. The 1862 show attracted almost 135,000 visitors, a record, and in later years there were regularly more than 100,000. During and immediately after the Second World War, from 1939 to 1948, the show was not held; the Royal Agricultural Hall was requisitioned for the GPO in 1943. Annual shows recommenced in 1949, at the Earl's Court Exhibition Centre in Earl's Court, London; the last show was held there in 2004. It was the last major livestock show in London.

He went to school at the Arung School of Education, obtaining a Higher English Certificate of Education. Soldier Rai served in the Gorkha Brigade during three years during World War II. He reached the rank of Colour Sergeant. In 1950 he was arrested in Malaya and deported, having been denounced as a 'communist agent' by John Cross, Chief Instructor of the new Army School of Education (Gurkhas). In politics and trade unionism Rai served as general secretary of the All India Gorkha League. In 1946 the Communist Party of India proposed the notion of creating a 'Gorkhasthan', merging Nepal, south Sikkim and the Darjeeling hills. The CPI tried to convince the Gorkha League to support the Gorkhasthan proposal, but Rai categorically opposed it. As a trade unionist, he was the founder of Darjeeling Chiya Kaman Shramik Sangha. He served as patron of the Darjeeling Cultural Institute. As an author, he wrote many poems and short stories in Nepali language. Legislator Rai represented the Darjeeling constituency seat in the West Bengal Legislative Assembly from 1957 until his death. Minister Rai was named Minister for Scheduled Castes and Tribes Welfare in the 1967 and 1969 United Front governments of West Bengal. He was again named as Minister in the 1971 state government, now in charge of Scheduled Castes Tribal Welfare and Tourism. For a quarter century, Rai was the dominant politician in the Darjeeling hills. He received criticism from within his own community, which accused him of having entered into a secret pact with the state government in Calcutta. While Raj served as Minister in three successive state cabinets, no progress on administrative autonomy for the Darjeeling hills was made. 1977 election At the time of the 1977 elections Rai was weakened by illness. Rai died in 1981. After his death, his party was weakened and more militant factions such as Pranta Parishad and the Gorkha National Liberation Front came to dominate the political field in the hills.

Symptoms typically appear at about 5 to 24 months of age. Without treatment there may be poor muscle tone, trouble with coordination, trouble talking, and seizures. One cause of cerebral folate deficiency is a mutation in a gene responsible for folate transport, specifically FOLR1. This is inherited from a person's parents in an autosomal recessive manner. Other causes appear to be Kearns–Sayre syndrome and autoantibodies to the folate receptor. For people with the FOLR1 mutation, even when the systemic deficiency is corrected by folate, the cerebral deficiency remains and must be treated with folinic acid. Success depends on early initiation of treatment and treatment for a long period of time. Fewer than 20 people with the FOLR1 defect have been described in the medical literature. Signs and symptoms Children with the FOLR1 mutation are born healthy. Symptoms typically appear at about 5 to 24 months of age. The symptoms get worse with time. Without treatment there may be poor muscle tone, trouble with coordination, trouble talking, and seizures. Causes One cause of cerebral folate deficiency is due to a genetic mutation in the FOLR1 gene. It is inherited from a person's parents in an autosomal recessive manner. Other causes appear to be Kearns–Sayre syndrome and autoantibodies to the folate receptor. Furthermore, secondary cerebral folate deficiency can develop in patients suffering from other conditions. For example, it can develop in AADC deficiency through the depletion of methyl donors, such as SAM and 5-MTHF, by O-methylation of the excessive amounts of L-dopa present in patients. Treatment For people with the FOLR1 mutation, even when the systemic deficiency is corrected by folate, the cerebral deficiency remains, and must be treated with folinic acid. Success depends on early initiation of treatment. Treatment requires taking folinic acid for a significant period of time. Fewer than 20 people with the FOLR1 defect have been described in the medical literature. Treatment with pharmacologic doses of folinic acid has also led to reversal of some symptoms in children diagnosed with cerebral folate deficiency and testing positive for autoantibodies to folate receptor alpha.

Prior to her marriage in 1909 to Monroe Bostelmann (1881-1920), she studied at the University of Leipzig and the Grand Ducal Academy in Weimar receiving a Gold Medal for drawing. In addition to the Königliche Akademie of Graphic Arts in Liepzig, Bostelmann studied with the well-known Russian artist Sascha Schneider (1870-1927) and German painter Ludwig von Hofmann (1861-1945). In America, she was a student of artists Howard Giles (1876-1955) and Bernard Klonis (1906-1957).Bostelmann Paints for Beebe, The Bermuda National Gallery, In cooperation with the Bermuda Aquarium, Museum & Zoo, October 18, 1996 - January 18, 1997Darien Review, Darien, Connecticut, Thursday, May 12, 1955 Bostelmann had her first one-man show in Liepzig, Germany at the age of 27.The Darien Review, Darien, Connecticut, December 28, 1961 In America, she soloed at the Argent Gallery, New York and the Biltmore Art Gallery in Palm Beach, Florida.

After her marriage in Germany (1909), Bostelmann immigrated to America. According to a statement she gave to the Darien Review in 1955, she discontinued painting for ten years to do research on natural history, \\"a choice which paved her way to the things she has done during the forty years she has been in the United States.\\"Darien Review, May 12, 1955 In 1910, the newly weds moved to Mexia, Texas where Mr. Bostelmann desired to become a cotton grower. Their daughter, Gertraud Hadumodt Bostelmann (Crumpton), was born the following year. Life proved to be very difficult for them. In 1920, Mr. Bostelmann was found alongside a Mexia road dying from exhaustion.Mexia, Texas, Tuesday, May 4, 1920 After his death, Else and Gertraud returned to New York, possibly staying with her sister-in-law Celeste (Monroe's sister) and her husband Truman Fassett, also an artist. She supported herself and Gertraud as a freelance merchandise illustrator and as an illustrator for sheet music covers.G. Schirmer (Incorporated) New York In 1929, Bostelmann contacted the New York Zoological Society at the Bronx Zoo and was hired to be the expedition artist for William Beebe in Bermuda. This was sponsored by the National Geographic Society. She rendered over 300 plates of deep-sea and shore fish including the giant squid (krakan) that has been verified by Dr. Edith Widder, a modern-day deep sea explorer, and Tsunemi Kubodera, a researcher with the Japan's National Science Museum (2012).Smithsonian.com, March 1013, Fantastic Light, pages 50-59 Bostelmann's marine life art was published in several National Geographic Magazines in the 1930s, 1940s and beyond. Her depiction of the bioluminescence of unknown ocean life caused a stir in the oceanographic world.New York Daily News, Sunday, August 10, 2014 Although she did not descend in the Bathysphere, her studies and final paintings were true to life at the time. Beebe described what he saw as he descended in the bathysphere through a direct telephone line to the ship above him. Detailed notes were taken by Gloria Hollister, a member of the research team. When Beebe exited the bathysphere, he immediately worked with Bostelmann as she put his descriptions to paper using watercolor, gouache and pencil. She did don a 16-pound copper helmet with an air hose attached to the ship above, sat on a chair on the ocean floor (20–35 feet down) with her canvas attached to an iron music stand weighted with lead and her brushes tied to the stand as she painted with oil the fish she saw around her. Due to the change in available light at that depth, the colors in her paintings were muted. The National Geographic featured full color plates (1936 and 1938) of her paintings for Dr. Roy W. Minor (1875-1955) of the New York Academy of Sciences, such as the Red-Plumed Worms and Brown Scale Worms living in the Sandy Mud Flats South of Cape Cod. She also illustrated and published 14 children's books, illustrated color plates of flora in additional National Geographic Magazines and had textiles (bathroom towels and rugs, and handbags) of her sea life produced by Oppenheim and Collins in New York City where they were also sold at Macy's Department Stores.The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Wednesday, May 11, 1938, page 5The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Friday May 13, 1938, page 5 Later in her life, Bostelmann exhibited her Undersea Life and Exotic Flowers at various venues (the Bridgeport Flower Show, Bridgeport, Connecticut, 1953; the Blomquist-Symonds Studio, Meridan, Connecticut, 1955; the New Canaan Outdoor Art Show, New Canaan, Connecticut, 1957; the Stamford Museum and Nature Center, Stamford, Connecticut, 1957; the Exhibit of Oils at Pen and Brush, Greenwich Village, New York, 1957; the Darien Public Library, Darien, Connecticut, 1959). Bostelmann died December, 1961. In May 1962, her daughter, Mrs. Gertraude Hadumodt Bostelmann Crumpton, held a showing of her mother's lifetime work.

He was unraced as a two-year-old but developed into a useful stayer as a three-year- old when he won the Chester Stakes, finished second in the March Stakes and ran prominently for a long way in the St Leger. In 1992 he failed to win but ran well to take second place in the Ormonde Stakes, Henry II Stakes and Ascot Gold Cup. His prospects however became compromised by his difficult and aggressive temperament as he attempted to attack other horses during his races. An attempt to curb his behaviour by fitting him with a muzzle was only partially successful and he was gelded before the end of the year. As a five- year-old in 1993 he was better-behaved but less successful although he did finish third in the Goodwood Cup. He reached his peak in 1994, his final season of racing when he defeated the Melbourne Cup winner Vintage Crop to win the Ascot Gold Cup at the third attempt. He was also placed in the Sagaro Stakes, Goodwood Cup and Prix Kergorlay before ending his racing career with a win in the Doncaster Cup. Arcadian Heights remained a difficult horse to manage in his retirement and special measures had to be taken to protect other horses and stable staff. Background Arcadian Heights was a bay horse bred in England by his owner John Pearce. He was trained throughout his racing career by Geoff Wragg at the Abington Place stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. Arcadian Heights was from the ninth crop of foals sired by Shirley Heights who won The Derby and the Irish Derby in 1978, before becoming a very successful breeding stallion who sired many good winners including Slip Anchor and Darshaan. Arcadian Heights' dam Miss Longchamp showed some ability as a racehorse, winning two races in England as a three-year-old in the summer of 1982. She was a half-sister of the Premio Vittorio di Capua winner Paris-Turf and, as a descendant of Polish Star, a relative of the leading Australian performers Stormy Rex (VRC Derby) and Sheraco (AJC Oaks). Racing career =1991: three-year-old season= Arcadian Heights did not race as a two-year- old and began his racing career in May 1991 when he finished seventh in a maiden race over one and a half miles at Newmarket Racecourse. In a similar event over fourteen furlongs at Yarmouth Racecourse on 4 June he finished third behind Sought Out and Jendali, horses who went on to win the Prix du Cadran and the Queen's Vase respectively. Later that month he started at odds of 8/1 in a four-runner maiden over fifteen furlongs at Newmarket and recorded his first success as he led from the start and won by three lengths from the Henry Cecil-trained Shelegai. After a break of almost two months Arcadian Heights was moved up in class for the Listed March Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse on 24 August. He raced in second place for most of the way and finished runner-up to the Dick Hern-trained Jahafil. Seven days later the colt was matched against older horses in the Chester Stakes over thirteen furlongs at Chester Racecourse and started the 5/2 joint-favourite alongside the Henry Cecil-trained four-year-old Bondstone. Ridden by Walter Swinburn (who became his regular jockey) he led from the start, accelerated clear of the field and won by three lengths from the filly Secret Waters. On 14 September Arcadian Heights was one of ten three-year-olds to contest the 215th running of the St Leger Stakes over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse. Starting at odds of 12/1 he was amongst the leaders from the start and went to the front approaching the final turn but faded in the straight to finish eighth behind Toulon. =1992: four-year-old season= On his first appearance of 1992 Arcadian Heights finished fourth to Luchiroverte in the Doncaster Shield over one and a half miles on 19 March after leading for most of the way. In this race he showed signs of his aggressive temperament as he bit Luchiroverte when he was overtaken a furlong from the finish. In his next two races he finished eighth behind Al Mutahm in the Sagaro Stakes at Ascot Racecourse in April and second, beaten ten lengths by Saddlers' Hall in the Ormonde Stakes at Chester on 7 May. In the Henry II Stakes at Sandown Park Racecourse sixteen days later he started a 25/1 outsider but recovered from being hampered half a mile from the finish to finish second of the eight runners behind Drum Taps. In the Ascot Gold Cup Arcadian Heights started the 11/2 fourth choice behind Drum Taps, Endoli and Turgeon in a six-runner field. After turning into the straight in fourth place he ran on in the closing stages to finish second behind Drum Taps. In what appeared to be a repeat of his antics at Doncaster, Arcaidian Heights lunged aggressively at Drum Taps early in the straight and was ordered to wear a muzzle in subsequent races. Geoff Wragg said \\"He is a bit yappy but he's not vicious. He just reacts like any other horse if you intimidate or annoy him\\". On his final appearance of the season Arcadian Heights finished fourth behind Further Flight in the Goodwood Cup on 30 July. Arcadian Heights became increasingly unhappy with his muzzle and it was decided to geld him to preserve his future as a racehorse. =1993: five-year-old season= After an absence of ten months, Arcadian Heights returned in the Henry II Stakes on 31 May 1993 and finished fifth behind the John Gosden-trained Brier Creek. On his second appearance in the Ascot Gold Cup on 17 June he finished fifth behind Drum Taps, Assessor, Turgeon and Sought Out. Frankie Dettori took over from Swinburn and partnered the gelding in his three subsequent races in 1993. In the Goodwood Cup he briefly led in the straight before finishing third behind Sonus and Assessor. Arcadian Heights finished forty lengths behind Further Flight when running seventh in the Lonsdale Stakes at York Racecourse in August. He ended his season in the Jockey Club Cup at Newmarket in October when he finished fifth of the six runners behind Further Flight. =1994: six-year-old season= Arcadian Heights began his 1994 campaign in the Sagaro Stakes at Ascot on 27 April in which he started a 20/1 outsider and finished third of the thirteen runners behind Safety In Numbers and the favoured Cairo Prince. The American jockey Cash Asmussen took the ride when the gelding contested the Henry II Stakes at Sandown on 30 May and finished sixth behind the John Dunlop-trained My Patriarch. Arcadian Heights was ridden by Michael Hills when he made his third appearance in the Gold Cup at Royal Ascot on 16 June and started a 20/1 outsider in a nine-runner field. The prize looked likely to go abroad as the great Irish stayer Vintage Crop, winner of the Melbourne Cup started favourite with the French-trained challenger Raintrap also strongly-fancied. The other six runners were My Patriarch, Safety In Numbers, Sonus and the leading National Hunt performers Morley Street, Oh So Risky (twice runner-up in the Champion Hurdle) and Corrouge (Scottish Champion Hurdle). Arcadian Heights took the lead from the start and set the pace before giving way to My Patriarch a mile from the finish but rallied to regain the advantage approaching the final turn. He held off a sustained challenge from Vintage Crop in the last quarter mile to win by three quarters of a length with a gap of seven lengths back to Sous in third place. On his third appearance in the Goodwood Cup Arcadian Heights carried top weight of 133 pounds and finished third in a close finish, beaten just over a length by the winner Tioman Island with My Patriarch and Further Flight unplaced. In August he was sent to France for the Prix Kengorlay over 3000 metres at Deauville Racecourse. Carrying 136 pounds he again finished a close third, beaten three quarters of a length and the same by Molesnes and Epaphos. Arcadian Heights ended his racing career in the Doncaster Cup in which he started the 7/2 favourite under top weight of 133. My Patriarch and Further Flight were again in opposition whilst the other fancied runners included Cuff Link (Queen Alexandra Stakes), Quick Ransom (Northumberland Plate) and Edbaysaan (third in the 1993 St Leger). Frankie Dettori sent the gelding into the lead from the start and Arcadian Heights ended his career with a victory as he quickened three furlongs out and stayed on well in the closing stages to win by one and a quarter lengths from Quick Ransom. Retirement At the end of his racing career, Arcadian Heights was sent to the Brick Kiln Farm, a retirement facility for former racehorses at Heveningham, Suffolk operated by Diane and Colin Cooper. In 2011 he was reported to be in good health but had lost none of his temper: Diane Cooper commented \\"Arcadian is fine with mares and he used to be brilliant at weaning time when we had foals, but put him in with another gelding and he'll bite, kick, both at the same time; he's very vicious\\". A veterinary surgeon who administered an injection to the gelding narrowly escaped injury when he was attacked by Arcadian Heights on returning to the yard: the safety of the farrier who shoed Arcadian Heights was preserved by distracting the horse with carrots during the procedure. Cooper added that \\"We know what he's like and never give him the chance to get us. We never take our eyes off him if we're near him\\". Assessment and awards In their book A Century of Champions, based on a modified version of the Timeform system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Arcadian Heights as a \\"poor\\" Gold Cup winner.

It came to an end when its capital city, the city of Kaifeng, was conquered by enemies from the north. Later, the provisional capital of the Northern Song Dynasty was founded in Ying Tian Fu (present-day Shangqiu of Henan). Historically, the Song Dynasty include both the Northern and the Southern Song. It is named \\"Northern\\" to distinguish from the \\"Southern\\", which resided mainly in Southern China. Emperor Taizu of Song elaborated a mutiny and usurped the throne of the Later Zhou (the last in a succession of five dynasties), which marked the beginning of the Dynasty. In 1127, its capital city Kaifeng fell into the hand of the state of Jin, during which time the ruling Emperor Qinzong and his family all fell captive in an event known as the Jingkang Incident. The Northern Song came to its end the next year. It was ruled by nine emperors, and lasted for 127 years. The ruled area of the Northern Song extended to the southeastern coast. Its Northern Border with the Liao state was the Hai River, Ba Zhou city, Hebei province, and Yanmen Pass, Shanxi (Jin) province, an essential pass of the Great wall. Its reign reached northwest to the Hengshan Mountain in Shaanxi (Shan/Qin), the east of Gansu province, and the Huangshui River of Qinghai, all the way to the border with the state of Liao. In the west, it shared the boundary line of Min Mountains and Dadu River (Sichuan) with Tibet and Dali Kingdom. It was also adjacent with Vietnam across Guangxi province. Still, the Northern Song Dynasty had been the smallest in terms of land area among all the united empires that were established on the vast Central Plains. As was recorded by Taiping Huanyu Ji, the population of the Northern Song Dynasty exploded from 32,500,000 in 980 C.E. to 100,001,200 in 1110 C.E..  History  = The founding = Zhao Kuang Yin, the first emperor (Taizu) of The Northern Song Taizu, the first emperor of Song, Zhao Kuang Yin was a professional soldier. He was a Lifeguard in charge of the troops in front of the emperor's palace in the Later Zhou. Zhao had become an essential military figure during the reign of emperor Shizong owing to his outstanding military exploits. After Shizong died, the young Gongdi emperor ascended the throne. Zhao later seized power through the Chenqiao Mutiny, and established the Song. He adopted an authoritarian centralized system to uproot the potential dictatorship and autocracy of senior officials, which had long been a threat ever since the mid-Tang Dynasty, and to solidify the authoritarian central government, a contributing factor to the stability and growth of the feudal social economy. On the other hand, the redundant bureaucracy and unnecessary official posts led to a terrible decline in efficiency and subsequently financial difficulties. In the field of military, the Northern Song expanded troops, weakened the military power of generals by separating the power to different persons, and shortened their service term at one official post so that they would not have the chance to accumulate that much power before it threatened the central. The constant change of the general, however, resulted in the decline of fighting capacity of the soldiers, and the Northern Song troops had suffered repeated defeats against minority groups like the Liao and Western Xia. The frontier defense thus became empty and feeble, which was detrimental to national security. Overall, the authoritarian centralized system had to some extents contributed to the unification and stability of the feudal state, preventing the local separatism and peasant revolts from happening, but it also foreshadowed the deepening impoverished and enfeebled from the mid Northern Song. During the spring festival in 960, Zhao's partisan fellows made up false intelligence that the Liao state was to invade. The prime minister (in feudal China) then immediately commanded Zhao to go to the frontier to defend. On the third day of the first lunar month, Zhao arrived at Chenqiao, and was draped with the imperial yellow robe by his supporters (a ritual of admitting someone as the emperor, kind of like coronation) that night. The officials of the later Zhou deemed it as irreversible and did nothing but accepted the reality. The Gondi of later Zhou was forced to leave the throne, and Zhao subsequently became the Taizu of the Song dynasty. In 961 and 969, during banquets, and while drunk (or pretending to be) Zhao threatened the generals twice not to rebel against the Song, just like he himself had done against the later Zhou, and deprived them of the power they used to have by assigning them to merely nominal positions while appointing civil officials as commanders of troops, to centralize the military power. The Northern Song dynasty was thus free from local military separatists, but at the same time the local resources were limited. It all led to its defeats in battles against the northern tribes.钱穆在《国史大纲》第六编《两宋之部》中说：“与秦、汉、隋、唐统一相随并来的，是中国的富强”，而宋朝“却始终摆脱不了贫弱的命运”。。 The national policy of the Northern Song Dynasty is principled on its \\"emphasis on the scholars and less on the military\\"(重文轻武). This has its advantages and disadvantages for the Song Dynasty; the advantage being stability would be brought upon the political and economic environments of the early Northern Song Dynasty, especially when there are no scourges such as eunuch's messing around or local governors seizing land. Even though most Song emperors performed mediocrely, the country remained prosperous and stable. The disadvantage, however, was that the Northern Song Dynasty had suffered military defeats successively. Alongside the Southern Song Dynasty, the 300 years of the Song Dynasty's history gravitated towards its military defeats and retreats. Another task Song Taizu faced was to unify his country. After discussing with Zhao Puxue, Zhao Kuangyin decided to unify the whole country starting with south then to north. Zhao Kuangyin first resorted to a counterfeit plan to destroy Nanping and Wuping. He also annihilated the three kingdoms, Shu, Nanhan, and Nantang. Taizu wholeheartedly wished for successful unification, and also set up a warehouse to save money and silk, hoping it would help redeem the sixteen states of Yanyun from the Liao in the future. In August of the 9th year of Kaibao (976), Taizu went northward again. However, Taizu died abruptly on October 19, so his brother Zhao Guangyi immediately took the throne. It was rumored that Guangyi had murdered his elder brother to usurp the throne. The task for unifying the North and the South was temporarily suspended as Zhao Guangyi ascended the throne as Song Taizong. After Emperor Taizong stabilized his rule, he continued the task of reunification. Chen Hongjin and self titled King Wuyue, Qian Hongling who seized the two provinces of Zhang and Quan in Fujian surrendered in 978, then the Northern Han was obliterated in 979. In May of the 4th year of Taiping Xingguo (979), Taizong disregarded his ministers' objections and took advantage of the demise of Northern Han to start a northern expedition from Taiyuan. At first, Yizhou and Zhuozhou were reclaimed. Taizong was complacent and ordered an attack on Yanjing, which resulted in a disastrous defeat in the Sorghum River outside Youzhou(now outside Xizhimen in Beijing). After this defeat, the Song Dynasty's military strategy turned passive. In the third year of Yongxi (986 years), Taizong headed north again, resulting in another defeat. The famous general Yang Ye was also killed in this battle. Later, Sichuan broke out with Wang Xiaobo and Li Shunmin's coups, leading to a shift in importance of Taizong's administration from focusing on external affairs to internal ones. Taizong was a vassal and elegant man who liked poetry and literature. His government attached great importance to cultural undertakings, with the Dynasty highly stressing the people's education. Taizong also liked calligraphy, and was able to write in six types of fonts: Cao, Li, Xing, Zhuan, Bafen, and Feibai, and preferred Feibai over the rest. The characters on the ingots of the Song's currency were also the works of Taizong. Song Taizu had a mature son, so his brother's ascension was quite suspicious, with folks claiming that Zhao Kuangyin was murdered by Zhao Guangyi. In order to ensure the legitimacy of the regime, Zhao Guangyi presented the will of his mother Empress Du, which is named the \\"Will of the Golden Cabinet\\"(金櫃之盟)(or 匱). This originated when Empress Du called Zhao Pu into the palace to record her last words, in which she ordered that after Zhao Kuangyin's death, the throne would first pass to Guangyi, then Guangmei (later renamed Tingmei), before De Zhao, Zhao Kuangyin's eldest son. This testament was hidden in a golden cabinet, explaining its name's origin. Although there was such a statement in the will, Taizong imposed the death penalty on his father's sons, Dezhao and Defang, then demoted Tingmei to Fangzhou. Two years later, Tingmei died in exile. Taizong's eldest son, Yuan Zuo, was also dismissed from prince to peasant because of his sympathy for Ting Mei. Another son, Yuan Xi, died to unknown causes. Ultimately, Xiang Prince Yuan Kan was established as the heir and renamed Heng. In the third year of Zhidao (997), after Taizong died, Queen Li and Eunuch Wang Jien attempted to establish Yuanzuo as the emperor. Fortunately, Prime Minister Lu Duan properly handled the situation, helping Zhao Heng to succeed the throne, and the Song Dynasty began to enter its prime. = Northern wars against Liu and Xia = After Taizong's death, Zhao Heng ascended as Emperor Song Zhenzong. He pursued Taizong's Huang Lao policies and ruled with inaction. Ever since the Northern Expedition of Yongxi, the Liao often robbed and looted the Song at its borders. By the first year of Jingde, these hostilities had evolved into a large-scale invasion. The prime minister Kou Zhun led the resistance. Zhenzong headed to the battlefield in person and greatly boosted the morale of the Song army. The Song and the Liao entered a deadlock in the city of Tanzhou. Coincidentally, the Liao general Xiao Tieling was shot down by a crossbow of the Song army, greatly weakening the morale of the Liao army and crushing any hope of a Liao victory. The Liao then sought to reconcile with the Northern Song Dynasty and after several negotiations, the two countries agreed to a peace treaty. The main content of the peace treaty was as follows: Song would pay 20 million silks and 100,000 silvers tribute to Liao annually, and the treaty was historically named \\"The Treaty of Chanyuan\\". Emperor Song Zhenzong Zhao Heng Afterwards, Kou Zhun gradually fell out of Zhenzong's favor and was eventually dismissed. Wang Chinro, an eminent minister who was good at ingratiating, knew that Zhenzong hoped to enkindle an atmosphere of peace and harmony, and so advocated Zhenzong to Feng Shan. He also colluded with another prime minister, Wang Dan, to fabricate \\"auspicious\\" facades all over the nation. As a result, Zhenzong had Feng Shan a total of three times in the first year of Dazhongxiang Fu, and Wang Chiru had became Zhenzong's most trusted ministers. Zhenzong and Queen Liu had no children. On one occasion, Zhenzong visited Li, a maid of Liu Concubine, and she gave birth to a son (Zhao Shouyi) in the third year of Yu Dazhong Xiangfu, who later became Renzong. Liu and another concubine, Yang raised the child. In the Mid-Autumn Festival of the second year of Tianxi, Zhenzong officially entitled Zhao as the heir and renamed him Zhao Zhen. On February 20, the first year of Qianxing, Zhenzong died. Crown Prince Zhao Zhen took the throne, and Queen Liu became the Queen Dowager ruling before Renzong became an adult. From then on began the sixteen years of Empress Liu's domination of the government. At the beginning of Renzong's rule, Renzong was not able to carry out his ambitions as he was always under the shadow of Liu's. Although Emperor Renzong's queen was from the Cao family, he had always been particularly fond of Concubine Zhang. But as Zhang came from a lowly background, she could never be queen. Zhang died on the eighth day of the first lunar month in the sixth year of Huangyou, and Renzong treated her funeral as if she was the queen, and even bestowed her the title Queen Wencheng. The result was unprecedented in history, with a living and a dead queen. The nation was relatively strong in the rule of Renzong with a prosperous economy, forming the peak of the Northern Song Dynasty. However, there were two major problems that had to be faced at the time: the expansion of the imperial court and the scaling number of soldiers, causing financial issues. At the same time, tributes and gifts were often needed to appease the Northern tribes, exhausting the nation's wealth. Party leader Li Yuanhao announced himself the emperor in the third year of Daqing (1038) and established Xixia, causing several years of war between Song and Xia. Song was defeated numerous times. Renzong appointed Fan Zhongyan, Lu Yijian, Fu Bi, Bao Zheng, Han Qi and other talented ministers to implement the Qingli New Code, which achieved excellent results. The Dynasty had entered its most prosperous stage, but some conservative figures accused the reformist officials of ganging up. Since Renzong had always hated cronyism, these reformist officials were later demoted to provincial officials. This marked the end of the brief execution Qingli New Code. On the frontier, Renzong appointed general Di Qing first to annihilate the rebellion of Southern Non Chicco then the provocation of Xixia. After Renzong's died, Song Yingzong, Zhao Shu succeeded him. He was the grandson of Zhao Yuanfen, the brother of Zhenzong, and was established as crown prince in the seventh year of Jiayou. Emperor Yingzong was frail, with Queen Cao handling all state affairs at first. Yingzong only began ruling after May of the first year of Zhiping. Half a month after he regained authority, a dispute broke out and lasted for 18 months. The cause of the incident was that Prime Minister Han Qi initiated a discussion on the status of Inzong's biological father. As a result, the government was divided into two factions; one faction believed that Yingzong's biological father, Monarch Pu, should be called Huang Bo(皇伯), the king's uncle, and the other faction believed that he should be called Huang Kao(皇伯). In the end, the empress dowager decided to call him Huang Kao, and only then did the argument subside. In general, Yingzong was still a propitious monarch. He continued to appoint talented former courtiers, also daring to unearth new talents. Yingzong also focused on the compilation of books; the creation of \\"Zizhi Tongjian\\" had been initiated by Yingzong. = New Policies = After Yingzong's death, his eldest son Shenzong ascended the throne. As he began his reign, he noticed the many malpractices that had arisen from the rules formulated in the early stages of the Song Dynasty, causing people's quality of lives to decline, and how Liao and Xia were ready to invade a weakened Song. Shenzong therefore was determined to reform, enabling Wang Anshi, a well-known reformist minister, to carry out political reforms, and appointed him as a politician. The new laws promoted by Wang Anshi included collective responsibility, the Green Sprouts program, exemption from military services, a trade management system, Baojia system, war horse breeding program, a new tax system and so on. However, the conservative party led by Sima Guang was strongly against the implementation of the new law. Coupled with the continuous occurrence of natural disasters in the country, Shenzong's determination to implement the reform had been shaken. In the seventh year of Xining, a drought occurred in North China, and an official named Zheng Xia presented an illustration of the suffering peasants to Shenzong. This shocked Shenzong and he ordered the suspension of all 18 laws from the reform the following day. Although these policies were restored soon, Shenzong had already begun to distrust Wang Anshi. In April of the seventh year of Xining, Wang Anshi was dismissed for the first time and sent out to Zhijiang Ningfu. Later, Lu Huiqing, a reformist official, acted recklessly, causing Wang Anshi to be reinstated in the capital, though still frustrated by the conservative party. In June of the ninth year of Xining, Wang Anshi's eldest son died. Wang Anshi took the opportunity to retire, so Shenzong dismissed Wang Anshi from his position again in October. After that, Wang Anshi did not engage in any stately affairs. Wang Anshi Although the opinions on Xining's New Policies were controversial, there was no doubt that Wang Anshi's intended effects from its implementation were never accomplished. Although the implementation of the new laws greatly increased the country's revenue and area of land cultivated, it also increased the burden on civilians. The military reforms were only a palliative effort, ultimately resulting in no advances in the military's effectiveness. Coupled with Wang Anshi's impatience, Wang Anshi hastily implemented the reforms, not allowing the necessary longer period of time for society to benefit the fruits of the New Policies. Moreover, after the new law had been implemented for a while, the differences between the clauses and the effect of the reform continued increasing, and some measures originally benefiting the people began to disturb them instead. Improper implementation of the new law was also a reason for its loss of support. Among the reformers, Lu Huiqing, Zeng Bu, Li Ding, and Cai Jing were quite contentious characters, some of them even being regarded as villains. For this reform, historian Huang Renyu commented on this reform: \\"As early as nine hundred years before us, China attempted to manipulate the state by means of fiscal policies. Its scope and depth have not been seen elsewhere in the world at the time. However, modern finance is an omnipresent and omnipotent organizational force. Its rule included everything, and it does not allow any other competitors to rival it.\\" After Wang Anshi was dismissed, Shenzong continued reforming; this was known as \\"Yuanfeng Reforms.\\" Although the reform of Yuanfeng was also called \\"Xinfeng New Policies\\" alongside Xining Reform, the reform efforts could not measure up to those in the Xining Reform. With an increasing national military force, Shenzong shifted his focus to the Northern tribes, determined to destroy Xixia. In the fifth years of Xining, Shenzong began to march westward in Xiaxia in May, and won great victories, boosting his confidence. In April of the fourth year of Yuanfeng, a coup occurred within Xixia, and Shenzong took this opportunity to strike Xixia again. However, the expedition ended up as a fiasco. Shenzong couldn't bear it and therefore became bedridden. At the beginning of the first month of the eighth year of Yuanfeng, Shenzong named his sixtg son Zhao Mai as the heir. Although the new law promulgated by Shenzong was briefly abolished by his mother Empress Dowager Gao, it soon was restored, its execution continuing even to the Southern Song Dynasty. After the death of Shenzong, the Empress Dowager Gao controlled the politics, strictly restraining Zhao Xu who had just assumed the throne as Zhezong. The Empress Dowager patronized the conservative party head, Sima Guang, and diminished Zhezong. This initiated a serious clash between the conservatives and the reformists, which was later known as the Yuanyou Conflicts. After Zhezong seized back authority, he denounced the conservative party and backed the reformist party, continuing employing the reforms. = Song Jiang, Fang La Civil Commotion = Zhezong did not leave any heirs so his brother Zhao Ji ascended the throne as Song Huizong after he died. Huizong was only interested in seeking enjoyment and had no interest in governing. In the beginning, the Empress Dowager helped rule the government, and tried to reharmonize the conservative and reformist party. This ended in absolute failure with the Empress Dowager's death. Huizong loved calligraphy, painting and horse riding since childhood. Huizong's reign was dissipated as he liked to visit the Qinglou. According to what the scholars said, he demanded massive construction projects like the Wansui Mountain built in the northeast corner of Kaifeng, which was then renamed Genyue. Genyue covered land with a radius more than ten miles, and had multiple sanctuaries like Hisbiscus Pond, \\"Furongchi\\"(芙蓉池) and Gentle Creek, \\"Cixi\\"(慈溪). It also housed pavilions, exotic birds and animals. Huizong also established the Yingfeng Bureau in Suzhou to plunder for peculiar gems, stones and minerals in the southeast, causing much social unrest. In the first year of Xuanhe (1119), Song Jiang gathered thirty-six people and started commotions in Shandong and Hebei. He was later recruited as an official to resume peace. In the second year of Xuanhe (1120), the leader of the Manichaeism Fang La led the public to start a commotion in Qixian Village of She County (some said that the incident took place in Bangyuandong, Wannian Township, Chun'an). They later captured Hangzhou, and established a regime across the four provinces, six states and fifty-two counties of Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi, but was suppressed by the Song General Han Shizhong the following year. = Jingkang Incident = Song Huizong was a brilliant artist but a poor ruler. Song Huizong ignored politics, and the government affairs were handed over to Cai Jing, head of the Six Thieves. Cai Jing encouraged polarization of parties by banning other party members and rejecting dissidents in the name of restoring law and justice. The day after Cai Jing took office, he issued an edict prohibiting the Yuanyou New Policy, which was later named the Yuanyou Liaison. Virtuous ministers were ostracized from the political center. Huizong enjoyed grandiose feats, and so, when he saw Liao being attacked by Jin, quickly sent an ambassador to Jin in spring of the first year of Zhonghe. The two sides agreed to join forces and attack Liao, Song being responsible for attacking Nanjing and Xijing. After Liao was defeated, the land of Yan Yun would be restored to Song. This was historically the \\"Alliance Conducted at Sea\\". However, the Song army was defeated. The Jin Army looted the population of Yanjing and detained the three states, Ying, Ping and Luan. Although the Song's Cefan san state defender Zhang Jue and took back eleven out of the sixteen states of Youyun, in the seventh years of Xuanhe, the Jin attacked Song and soon occupied the three states and the states of Youyun, even reaching the capital of Song. Huizong was so frightened he passed on his position to Qinzong, his son, and fled to Jiangnan. Qinzong was indecisive in the negotiations and was not persuasive at all. Later, in desperate circumstances, Li Gang was enabled to defend Dongjing. Although the defence was victorious, the Jin Dynasty did not give up and advanced south twice. In September of the first year of Jingkang, Taiyuan fell. In November, the Kaifeng city wall fell, and the Jin forced Qinzong to reconcile. On November 30, Qin Zong was forced to go to the Jin's Camp to discuss the treatise, returning three days later. The Jin demanded a large amounts of precious stones, causing Qinzong to ransack away his belongings and property. Kaifeng City was besieged by the Jin Army, epidemic diseases seethed through the city, alongside the innumerable people dying of starvation. The Jin forced Qinzong to negotiate again, holding him captive, then attempted to extort more wealth on the condition of his return, but the Song's wealth had already been emptied. The Jin never conquered Kaifeng's inner city, but Song General Fan Qiong delivered Huizong and members of the royal family to the Jin. On February 6, the second year of Jingkang, the two emperors of Huizhou and Qin were abolished by Jin Taizong and degraded to peasants.《宋史》:“金人以帝(按：宋徽宗、宋钦宗)及皇后、皇太子北归。凡法驾、卤簿，皇后以下车辂、卤簿，冠服、礼器、法物，大乐、教坊乐器，祭器、八宝、九鼎、圭璧，浑天仪、铜人、刻漏，古器、景灵宫供器，太清楼秘阁三馆书、天下州府图及官吏、内人、内侍、技艺、工匠、娼优，府库畜积，为之一空” After the Jin robbed almost all the royal treasures of the Northern Song Dynasty's Palace, a puppet regime, \\"Da Chu\\" was established, with Zhang Bangchang as the puppet emperor. Later, another puppet regime, Da Qi was established in 1130, with Liu Yu established as the emperor, which was known in history as \\"Liu Qi\\". The two emperors and their brothers were abducted by the Jin to the Five Kingdoms City, historically known as the \\"Jingkang Incidence\\". Only Qinzong's brother Kang Zhao Gou had been exempted this fate by being recruited abroad. Huizong was dubbed as Hunde Gong(muddle-headed duke)\\"昏德公\\", and Qinzong as Zhonghun Hou(fatuous lord)重昏候. In the end, both of them died in Jin. Although Huizong did not have any political achievements, he has no doubt accomplished much in calligraphy and painting. Huizong's calligraphy and painting have an unparalleled position in the history of Chinese art, having created the Shoujin characters, and valuing the development of calligraphy and painting. The status of the Hanlin Academy of Painting and Calligraphy was greatly improved, and Zhang Zeduan, a famous painter and the author of the Qingming Shanghetu was promoted due to Huizong. Even his son Zhao Gou was influenced, later becoming an outstanding calligrapher. Zhao Gou later reclaimed his position as emperor, establishing the Southern Song Dynasty, but compared to the Northern Song Dynasty, Hebei, Henan, and Shandong, had been lost, the territory greatly reduced.  Politics  Map of Northern Song = Centralization = In the Song Dynasty, centralization of the government was promoted, the policy being named \\"strong trunk weak branches\\"(強榦弱枝). Local officials were all dispatched by the central government and their positions often rotated. All local revenue was directly transferred to the central government with no safes (named \\"money valley\\",制钱谷). It therefore became impossibly difficult to help locals in need during disasters. The centralization drive in the Song Dynasty concentrated the military and financial power, while surrounding regions became impoverished increasingly. As most regions had weakened due to financial toils, when the Jin advanced south, the whole country would disintegrate as soon as the capital Bianjing (Kaifeng) had been captured with no chance of rebounding. In the Tang Dynasty's Anshi Rebellion, even though its military strength was not weaker than that of the Jin, two capitals(the capital Chang'an and the east capital Luoyang) were invaded, fortunately the prefectures and counties were wealthy with plentiful rations and armoury, so resistance could be enabled. In the Song Dynasty, its wealth and provisions were concentrated in the capital leaving none at the local regions, so as soon as the capital was invaded, the whole country collapsed.钱穆:《中国历代政治得失·第三讲宋代》，生活·读书·新知三联书店。 = Imperial Examination = The examination system in the Song Dynasty generally perused that of the Tang Dynasty, but the influence gained through the imperial examination system in the Song Dynasty was different from the Tang Dynasty. Firstly, the familial status(門第, Mendi) was at its peak in the Tang Dynasty. When the examination was carried out, many candidates writing it were students from great ancestry. As they had been greatly educated by the upbringing in their families, a lot of political anecdotes had already been ingrained in them. Entrenched in politics, they had more chances and opportunities to gain influence. In the late Tang Dynasty, the threshold gradually lowered, and most candidates where the poor who studied hard to increase their livelihoods. Other than self studying the subjects to be tested and devoting their attention to reciting anthology and poetry, the country had not established a formal education. As tutors vanished from family of great ancestry, the politicians became more ignorant. The phrase \\"Jinshi are frivolous\\"(進士輕薄) became a buzzword in the late Tang Dynasty. From the Song Dynasty, except for a few families including the Lu and the Han family, the Mendi traditions had disappeared. Rural schoolboys, poor scholars, and remote candidates were more frequently selected to enter their political careers. They were inevitably unfamiliar with politics as they could not afford private tutors, so their political ability was certainly out of question. Secondly, the examinations in the Tang Dynasty had a system for self nomination, which meant the candidates could send their poems and achievements prior to the examination to erudite ministers in the government for review. As these ministers were well-respected, their appraisals after reading some works led to the fame of many candidates before the examination, securing well-off positions. The admission results are published after the examination, with the results decided according to the consensus from superiors in the government, who usually selected these well- known candidates, not only relying on the performances on the examination day. An examiner even self-depreciated that he did not understand the purpose of the imperial examination as it was the popularity of the candidates which defines the ranking, These words turned out not to be regarded as fraud, but rather as quite chivalrous at the time. Originally, the exam's purpose was to sort out the geniuses in the country, and people believed after understanding the main spirit and original meaning of this system they should not bother about the details of its procurement. However, some had taken advantage of the leniency of the system, so the government had to model a stricter system to prevent fraud, which is generally true for all systems. However, as the system became gradually stricter, the original purpose was lost, and the focus transformed into preventing fraud instead. The examination system had become much stricter in the Song Dynasty. A practice to cover the candidates names when marking to obtain fairer examination results had emerged. However, if an examiner deliberately wanted to admit his favorite disciple, he could not find the disciple's paper due to the hidden names, so the disciple would not be admitted. Because of these stricter examination rules, sometimes, candidates with potential would not be admitted. The exam could only scout talents but could not cultivate any. There was the Taixue in the Han Dynasties and the Mendi in the Tang Dynasty, both involved in cultivating scholars. The Song people quite wanted to set up a formal education but these expectations had a bleak future. Secondly, the Song wanted to change the examination syllabus, testing the Jingyi(classics, \\"經義\\") instead of testing the poems and odes(詩賦). This intention was quite clear; poetry was too widespread and it was not proper to use this as a standard to identify brilliance for the government. But the New Policies did more harm than good, as the examination of the classics had not turned out as suitable as that of poetry and fu. Wang Jinggong lamented that the original intention of using scriptures to develop talented candidates, however, it had been turned on its heads. Moreover, tactless admissions and flattering officials with gifts had become major malpractices in the Song Dynasty; the imperial examination background despised candidates with such backgrounds, but there were not many talented individuals to be elected. The Song Dynasty also had too many officials causing great economical pressure.  Military  The Song Army was divided into two groups, one being the forbidden army and the other is the Xiang army. At the end of the Tang Dynasty during the Five Dynasties, the feudal states were arrogant and constantly lead their soldiers into conflicts. At the time, nearly everyone was a soldier with not many scholars around in the society. The army, at first still decent, later turned into a group of old and weak troops. The army couldn't fight in battle, so they were used in hard labor as if they were slaves. Everyone who served as a soldier had to be branded on the face to prevent him from running away; they were called the Pei troops. For example, Song Jiang, Wu Song and several others from the \\"Water Margin\\" had tattoos on their faces and were sent to military barracks as soldiers to perform laborious tasks. Folks condemned the government for being a thief of the army forces, and these circumstances continued until the Song Dynasty. However, Song didn't completely reform the system, and as such, their army had limited combat effectiveness. The Dynasty's army were more active in the Han Dynasty, and started turning into mediocrity in the Tang Dynasty, as the system for recruiting military services in the Song Dynasty was just a revision of that in the Han Dynasty. These soldiers were not needed for battles, only for miscellaneous tasks in local regions, doing whatever the local governments have ordered. It stands to reason that the first thing to be done after the founding of the Song Dynasty was to demobilize troops and dismiss old soldiers, but the Song Dynasty only ever did the first part. This is also the reason the Song Dynasty did not really unify the whole country. Their enemy, the Liao, had existed before the Song Dynasty for over 50 years. The Yanyun sixteen states were ceded to the Liao people by Shi Jingyuan. Liaoning, which was part of the territory of Shanxi and Hebei, was all in the hands of Liao. The northern barriers had pulled back, and the Song Dynasty built their capital in Kaifeng, which was a flat land exposed by the Yellow River banks. To the east of Taihang Mountain was a great plain, cavalry soldiers could reach the Yellow River banks in a few days if they descended from the north. Across the Yellow River, they would have reached the gate of Kaifeng. There was no well-established national defense during the founding of the Song Dynasty. If they built their capital in Luoyang, the enemy would still have to cross the Jingsuo Mountain in Zhengzhou area from the Longhai in the west, even if they had crossed the river from Beiping. Song could then still barely manage to guard against the invasion. If the Liao went south from the west of Shanxi, Yanmen Pass of Wutai Mountain had a natural defensive geography that could be counted as the second national defence. Liao could easily cross the Yellow River, so the capital should have been built in Luoyang. If we can restore the scale of the Han and Tang Dynasties and build the capital of Chang'an to the west, of course it is better. Song Taizu did not build the capital in Luoyang or Chang'an, but insisted on building it in Kaifeng as he had his difficulties. The early defense line was broken before, losing the Yan Yun states, so he had to raise more troops. As the soldiers had to be fed, the rations had to be entirely supported by the Yangtze River basin. The Great River Central Plains area had been dilapidated from the end of the Tang Dynasty to the Five Dynasties, so the economy relied entirely on the South. There was a canal from Yangzhou to the north, which differs from the canal in the Yuan Dynasty. This was the Tongji canal from Emperor Yang of Sui Dynasty, and started from Kaifeng to the north of Yangzhou along the Longhai line. If the rice grain were to be further transported to Luoyang from Kaifeng, it would not be possible as the Bian Canal was broken. As transport by land was difficult, a lot of manpower and resources would be wasted. The founding of the Song Dynasty undertook a chaotic and dilapidated society from the Five Dynasties, so had no resources lying around to transport the grains to Luoyang again, not to mention the desolation that remained of Changan. In order to save the freighting costs, Song Taizu moved the capital to Kaifeng, also professing that when the country is peaceful, it would then move west. At that time, there were two military strategies. The first one was to attack the northern bank of the Yellow River first, vanquishing the Northern Han and Liao. This was an aggressive and risky strategy. If the Song was defeated, there would be nowhere to hide from being disintegrated. The other was to first conquer the Yangtze River Basin, unifying the south, before advancing the north, which was a relatively stable strategy. Song Taizu decided on the second strategy, first unifying the south, leaving the formidable tasks for later generations. After he ascended the throne, and had led his army against Liao twice, and was defeated in both instances. The first time he fought on the banks of the Sorghum River that ran from Xizhi Gate in Peiping to Xishan Summer Palace and was defeated. He was injured by an arrow, and later suffered to death from the trauma . Back in the days, this had to be concealed from the public as it was a disgrace to the nation. As the Song Dynasty was not in good shape after its founding, it was not possible to lay off troops or dismiss the elderly; at the same time, they did not dare to fight against Liao as Song coul not afford to lose. If they lost, they would have to retreat to the Yellow River, shaking the country's foundations. And so the Song Dynasty had to raise and feed its soldier, even though they knew that they could not be used in battle. Strangely, after raising the army, the government did not paying them any heed, promoting scholars instead.The government advocated scholarly rule, emphasizing them in place of the military, as while they still wanted to retain troops for defending against foreign tribes they wanted to gradually reduce the power held by military generals, avoiding the mistakes of the late Tang and the Five Dynasties. As troops were not mobilized, the state had accumulated an increasing number of soldiers that had to be fed. In the \\"Water Margin, Lin Chong was the head of the 830,000 forbidden army. In reality, Taizu had only 200,000 troops when he founded the country; Taizong had 660,000, and Renzong had 1.25 million. Therefore, Wang Jinggong reformed the policies, he started from dismissing troops. The procedure for layoffs attempted to restore the ancient militia system from the mercenary troops in place at the time. However, the militia system was too hastily implemented, so another system was implemented; this was first tried out in the Yellow River Basin. The system, Baojia, was to train farmers into soldiers, hoping that during incidents they could be formed into an emergency force, lowering the cost for raising soldiers. The general military approach of the Song Dynasty was a defensive one, not daring to take the initiative to attack. However, to match the military recruiting program with the defensive approach was a miscalculation. The public were feared arrogant generals the most ever since late Tang and the Five Dynasties, but they were still arrogant in the Song dynasty. The country could do nothing but please them and constantly grant them merits, otherwise they might rebel. While the government reluctantly complied, they increased the influence of scholars and ministers to suppress the status of military generals. The generals had nothing to do, though every year in winter a few hundred catties of fuel would be sent to them. After raising soldiers the government raised scholars, gradually increasing the number of ministers, also having to elevate their merits. The situation spun out of hand, producing not only redundant soldiers and also redundant ministers, which added great burden to the nation's economy. The weakness drove Song into poverty, in turn driving a diminishing national power, until the situation was no longer reversible. Raising redundant soldiers was a major factor contribution to the downfall of the Song Dynasty. The problem of insufficient resources for national defenses was also one of the major shortcomings of the Song Dynasty. Horses were only produced in two places in the country; one in the northeast and one in the northwest. The first was raised among the thistles in the wild north in an area around Reza; the second in the Ganlianghe area. The horse had to be raised in a cold place with high altitude, and they could not be kept scattered away from one another. They had to be raised in grand mountains and valleys, with young grass, sweet springs, and open fields, and in groups to be used by the cavalry for long-distance pursuit. However, when the two places found in early Song Dynasty was captured by foreign tribes, one by Liao and the other by Xixia. However, the Shangyou iron and other fine iron ores associated with horse gears, were all found out of Song's territory in the northeast, also becoming a weakness for the Song Dynasty. It was not easy to raise horses in warm and humid areas, as they would easily get sick and die. Thus, the lack of horses had become another major obstacle the national defense of the Song Dynasty had to face. After the peace treatise between Song and Liao, the national defense of the Song Dynasty turned dire. The two countries never formally waged wars against each other nor established border defenses. The people were only encouraged to plant paddy fields, dig out more canals, and plant more poplars beside the canals. In case of war, they could obstruct the enemy and act as resistance against the cavalry of the Liao brigade.  Economy  = Agriculture = After the introduction of Zhancheng rice in the fifth year of Dazhong Xiangfu (1012) during Song Zhenzong's reign, the rice was vastly promoted, with 30,000 Hu(斛, a measuring unit) of Zhancheng rice taken from Fujian and distributed to Jianghuai and Liangzhe. This was the first large-scale introduction of rice crops in Chinese history. During the Xining period of Song Shenzong, large- scale dredging, siltation and farmland improvement were carried out, with 10,793 water conservancy sites constructed nationwide, resulting in more than 36 million mu(亩, a measuring unit) of irrigation fields.《宋会要辑稿》《江南社会经济研究·宋元卷》 In the lower part of the Yangtze River, rice and wheat were planted twice a year to increase farmland yield. The farm tools had also seen great improvements, with a tool for lifting sprouts being invented. It was discovered that powdered minerals such as lime, sulfur, and stalactite could be applied as fertilizers. Rapeseed became the main oil-producing crop in the Jiangnan region. Tea trees were widely planted throughout the South. Sichuan, Sichuan, Guangxi. Liangzhe and Fujian became popular sugarcane planting areas. Qin Guan's \\"Silkworm Book\\" was the earliest literature on sericulture in China. During the prime of the Northern Song Dynasty, the output of linen production was twice that of the Tang Dynasty. The percentage of cotton products in all textile products increased. The two regions of Zhejiang and Sichuan had become industrial centers for silk and weaving. Porcelain kilns were made all over the country. Dingzhou (now Hebei) produced Ding kilns, Ruzhou (now Henan Linru) produced Ru kilns, Yingchang Prefecture Yangzhai (now Henan Yuzhou) produced Jun Porcelain and Raozhou (now Jiangxi Boyang) produced Jingdezhen kilns, all with their own distinctive characteristics. With the development of the wood-block printing industry, the demand for paper surged, prompting rapid growth in the private paper industry, greatly improving the paper-making skills of Song Dynasty. In the Northern Song Dynasty, a large amount of coal has been mined for metallurgy and as fuel for the public. Oil was used in both military and medicine.

Today the park is managed by Rushmoor Borough Council.The Princes Gardens on the Rushmoor Borough Council website History Charging Horse sculpture in Princes Gardens The park is on the site of the former Royal Engineers Yard where a small party of NCOs and men of the Royal Engineers arrived in November 1853 making them the first soldiers to arrive in Aldershot, a fact commemorated on a modest plaque in the ground behind the sculpture of the horse and Bailey bridge. These engineers were responsible for surveying and making the preliminary arrangements for The Camp at Aldershot.Aldershot Military Cemetery on the English Heritage Listed Buildings site At this time the area was heathland with the only building in sight being the Union Poor House, the former home of the Tichborne family. As the Camp was established and grew, the Royal Engineers expanded their initial small collection of huts and this area became the Royal Engineers Yard. It continued to be used for this purpose until 1929 when the military huts were demolished.Howard N.

Over the next decade two cinemas were built at the lower end of the site, the Empire and Ritz cinemas, while the upper end was used as the Princes Gardens with a car park between it and the cinemas.Cole, pgs215-6 The Aldershot Gazette and Military News welcomed the new Princes Gardens which had turned land that had been “an almost desolate waste” into “a beauty spot” which would be “more restful to the eye than the old barren promontory” left after the removal of the Royal Engineers’ Yard. On 5 July 1945 troops of the Canadian Army Overseas gathered in the gardens before smashing the windows of local shops on the second evening of the Aldershot riot. An ornamental fountain was unveiled in the gardens in 1954 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Army in Aldershot. This was later removed.

He is best known as a close personal friend and trusted expositor (a person who explains complicated ideas) of Immanuel Kant. Johann Schultz was a Hofprediger (second court chaplain) and Professor of Mathematics at the University of Königsberg. Personal life Schultz studied theology and mathematics at the Collegium Fridericianum at Königsberg University, where Immanuel Kant lectured, and matriculated on 24 September 1756. Ludwig Borowski, one of Kant's early biographers stated that Schultz was one of the best students of Kant, and this is often repeated in the literature, but Schultz denied ever having attended a lecture.Rudolf Reicke Kantiana: Contributions to Immanuel Kant life and writings 1860, 42; page 31(anon.), Review of Kant’s Inaugural Dissertation, in the Königsbergsche Gelehrte und Politische Zeitungen (22–25 November 1771). Reprinted in Reinhard Brandt (op cit.), pp. 59-66. Transl. by James C. Morrison (op cit.), pp. 163-70. Schultz initially worked as a private tutor within Königsberg before undertaking employment as a pastor in Starkenberg between 1766 and 1769, taking similar employment at Löwenhagen between 1769 and 1775 before returning in 1775, to Königsberg to work as a Deacon at the Altroßgarten church. On 6 July 1775 he received his magister degree and on 2 August 1775, he took his examination for promotion of habilitation with a disputation on acoustics. He worked as a lecturer over the winter of 1775 and 1776. In 1777, he was made Hofprediger at Königsberg castle church. Schultz’s appointment as professor of mathematics to the government on 11 August 1786 was recommended by the Königsberg senate, at the same time that Kant was serving as rector at Königsberg. As a Professor of mathematics, he had a duty to provide lectures, which he did in arithmetic and geometry in the summer, and trigonometry and astronomy in the winter. Apart from a lecture series in metaphysics during the first half of his second year, and pedagogy that each professor took turns offering, Schultz offered mathematics lectures, focusing on pure and applied mathematics: Arithmetic, Geometry, Trigonometry, Algebra, finite and infinite analysis, Astronomy, Mechanics and Optics. Schultz used Christian Wolff's Treatise of Algebra and Leonhard Euler Elements of Algebra (French: Élémens ďalgebre) and his own text for arithmetic, geometry and trigonometry. Schultz first met the philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte between July to October 1791 when Schultz helped Fichte acquire a teaching position close to Danzig. Fichte described Schultz in correspondence as: :He has an angular Prussian face, but honesty and kindness shine forth from it They continued to write to each other to discuss ideas, even when Fichte left Danzig.Fichte also discusses Schulz at some length in the 2nd Introduction [1797] to his Wissenschaftslehre (Science Teaching) The relationship between Schultz and Fichte was more convoluted than it would otherwise be, as Johanna Eleonore, née Büttner (1751–1795), Schultz’s wife, was romantically linked to Fichte. Fichte left Königsberg sooner than he initially planned. Schultz became friends with Kant late in life. Literature Schultz published poetry in his early life, and several Latin texts on theology in 1787 and 1791. However, most of his literature was concerned with creation of mathematical texts, including the explanation of Immanuel Kant's new critical system (critical philosophy, transcendental idealism). Schultz wrote and successfully published several mathematical texts including Foundation of Pure Mathematics in 1790, a Brief System of Mathematics first published in 1797 with new editions in 1805 and 1806. However most of his interest was in the work concerning the Parallel Lines Postulate with papers published in 1780, 1784 and 1786. In 1788 he wrote Attempt at a precise theory of the infinite (German: Versuch einer genauen Theorie des Unendlichen) which was an entrant for the 1786 Berlin Academy prize essay question asking for a: :clear and precise theory of mathematical infinity Although Schultz was unsuccessful in this entry, the essay preceded certain features of Georg Cantor's theory of transfinite numbers. The work, although similar to work undertaken by the mathematicians Wenceslaus Johann Gustav Karsten, Georg Simon Klügel, and Johann Heinrich Lambert, would eventually result in the development of non-Euclidean geometry.

Education and early career  Scolnick earned a BA in 1961 from Harvard University and an MD in 1965 from Harvard Medical School. After medical school, he joined the Public Health Service to avoid being drafted into the Vietnam War. During his 15 years at the NIH's National Cancer Institute, Scolnick discovered the RAS oncogene that is involved in the critical signaling pathway that shifts an otherwise normal cell into the aggressive cells known as tumor cells. His work helped establish the concept of blocking signaling pathways as fundamental to cancer biology and drug discovery.  Merck  Scolnick joined Merck in 1982 as executive director of virus and cell biology, after being recruited from the National Institutes of Health. He was head of Research at Merck Research Laboratories from 1985 until he stepped down in 2002. While at Merck, he was involved in the development and introduction of 29 new medications and vaccines. He was a key figure in the development and marketing of Vioxx, which was pulled from the market after it was discovered that the drug caused a dangerously high risk of myocardial infarction. Legal claims resulting from this have cost Merck billions. During the five years it was available in the US, more than 38,000 deaths were related to Vioxx use, and up to 25 million Americans took the drug. In the subsequent investigations, it was revealed that it was likely that Merck knew about the adverse effects of the drug, and Scolnick had dismissed them in order to push the drug to market before Bayer's Celebrex.  Later career  Scolnick began as the founding director of the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at Broad Institute in 2007. In 2012, he stepped down as director and became the Stanley Center's chief scientist, being succeeded by Steven Hyman. He is an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences and its Institute of Medicine, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was also appointed to the Board of Visitors at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. MIT awards the Edward M. Scolnick Prize in Neuroscience in his honor.

It proved to be the remains of a large Roman ship from the third century AD, which had been wrecked at a depth of a little more than two metres, near the beach at Marausa, one of the frazioni (hamlets) of the comune (city council) of Trapani.

It was originally published by Nagata on the art website Pixiv; it was later published in a single print volume by East Press in June 2016 in Japanese, and by Seven Seas Entertainment in June 2017 in English, with this version winning the Harvey Award for Best Manga of 2018. It was well received by critics, one of whom called it a counterpoint to the \\"yuri fantasies\\" common to the genre, and was included on several lists of the best comics of the year, including the annual Kono Manga ga Sugoi! list. A sequel, My Solo Exchange Diary, was released in Japan in December 2016, and in English in June 2018. A third installment, My Solo Exchange Diary Volume 2, was released in English in February 2019. Another sequel, My Alcoholic Escape from Reality, was released in Japan in November 2019, and will be released in English in January 2021. Synopsis The manga is an autobiography following Kabi Nagata, a young woman, exploring subjects such as her mental health, her exploration of her sexuality, and her experience with growing up. Production and publication My Lesbian Experience With Loneliness was written and drawn by Kabi Nagata, with art colored in a two-tone palette. According to Nagata, she does not hesitate to expose her private life for the sake of creating interesting content for a manga, despite being more reserved when speaking to people in person. She decided to do this because of a lack of work after she had become a manga artist, thinking that the only way for her to create something interesting that could earn her a living was to base her creation on her own experiences. The writing process involved her writing down things that have happened to her, and her feelings, in the form of a bulleted list, and rearranging the items to form a narrative. When writing, she strove towards neither lowering or glorifying herself, to avoid spreading too negative feelings and making readers unable to relate to the stories. She said that there were some things she \\"couldn't touch on\\" in the manga, that she would like to use in a future work. Nagata originally published the manga on the Japanese art website Pixiv; it was later published by East Press in one print volume on June 17, 2016. For the printed volume, extra story material was added, and the art throughout the manga was revised. Seven Seas Entertainment announced in October 2016 that they had acquired the license for the manga, and released it on June 6, 2017 in North America, in a single volume, and digitally a day later through ComiXology. A sequel, My Solo Exchange Diary, was published by Shogakukan in Japan on December 10, 2016, and in English by Seven Seas Entertainment on June 5, 2018. Nagata's third work in this series, My Solo Exchange Diary Volume 2, was published in English by Seven Seas Entertainment on February 12, 2019. Her fourth work, My Alcoholic Escape from Reality, was published in Japan on November 7, 2019, and will be published in English by Seven Seas Entertainment on January 26, 2021. Reception The manga was well received by critics. The publishing company Takarajimasha listed My Lesbian Experience With Loneliness as the third best manga of the year for women in the 2017 incarnation of their yearly Kono Manga ga Sugoi! top-twenty list, after Kin no Kuni Mizu no Kuni and Haru no Noroi. It won The Anime Awards 2017 in the \\"Manga of the Year\\" category, both Publishers Weekly and Amazon listed it as one of the best comics of 2017, Teen Vogue included it on their list of the \\"best queer books to celebrate Pride 2017\\", and comic creator Tillie Walden included it in a Bookish article about \\"must-read\\" LGBTQ comics. It won a Harvey Award in the \\"Best Manga\\" category. The Japanese newspaper Fukui Shimbun liked the manga, and said that Nagata's thoughts remained with them after having finished reading it. The entertainment news site Natalie also enjoyed it, calling it a \\"breathtaking essay\\". Ana Valens of The Mary Sue cited it as a work that goes against the typical yuri fantasy themes in yuri works by exploring realistic emotional and mental dynamics in lesbian relationships, and said that the events leading up to Nagata's meeting with the sex worker \\"shed a new light on how we can think about yuri\\". Heidi MacDonald at The Beat called it \\"an irresistible memoir\\" and perfect for young readers also dealing with identity and acceptance issues. Judith Utz of Teen Vogue described it as \\"moving and honest\\", and relatable for everyone who has doubted themselves. Mey Valdivia Rude of Autostraddle hailed it as \\"the best book I’ve read all year\\", commending Nagata's rawness and honesty. My Lesbian Experience With Loneliness was the second best selling comic of its debut week in North America, according to the weekly Nielsen BookScan graphic novel sales charts, after Bitch Planet volume 2. It also appeared on the monthly BookScan chart for June 2017, in eleventh place.

Personal life Carolyn Evanson was born on 16 June 1930 in Richmond, Yorkshire, UK. She studied horticulture at Wye College, Kent (1949-1952). In 1952 she married Alan Hardy, and lived with him at Sandling Park in Kent. They had two daughters. She died 23 September 2016, after suffering from Alzheimer's disease in her last decade. Horticultural career The Sandling Park estate already had a reputation for rare trees and shrubs, and the Hardys developed it further as well as both becoming well- known in the horticultural world. She particularly introduced ground cover plants to contrast with trees. The gardens were seriously damaged in the Great Storm of 1987 with many trees destroyed, but the Hardys began clearance and replanting that continued for many years. They exhibited at Royal Horticultural Society shows and became involved in the organisation of the society. Carolyn Hardy was a member of the RHS Governing Council 1985 – 1997, member of many RHS committees and was Vice-Chair of the RHS for 10 years (2006 - 2016). She was a moderniser, involved in widening the range of people involved with the RHS. However, before her work for the Royal Horticultural Society, she had been involved with the UK charity National Gardens Scheme. She was the county organiser for Kent in 1971 (until 1979) and then in 1972 she joined its governing council, finally serving as the Chair from 1979 until 1986. She led the transformation of the National Gardens Scheme to an independent charity in 1980 from its origin as a fund-raising enterprise of the Queen's Nursing Institute supporting district nurses in 1927. Many more gardens joined the scheme, with the proceeds going to support additional nursing charities such as Macmillan Cancer Support and Marie Curie. She was made an Honorary Life Vice President on retiring as Chair of the National Gardens Scheme. Awards She was awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's most distinguished award, the Victoria Medal of Honour (VMH) in 1989 and the Order of the British Empire in 1998 for services to horticulture. Several plant varieties have been named after her including Dianthus 'Carolyn Hardy' and Deutzia hookeriana 'Carolyn Hardy'.

After allegedly being raped by a correctional officer in 1995 and having the authorities refuse to investigate her complaint she began coordinating local protests and calls for police accountability which she routinely organized until her arrest in 2006. During her career Reverend Powell ran local charitable events in the area and operated a youth homeless shelter out of a salon she owned. She also started organizing candlelight vigils for victims of neighborhood violence after her son was killed as a bystander in a gang shooting in 2000. After the shooting of a mentally ill man her activism led to the creation of an, \\"Emergency Response Team\\" to deal with mental health situations and forced officers in the Rochester Police Department to get additional training in dealing with the mentally ill. In 2006, Reverend Powell was arrested and charged with felony assault and burglary after a pawn shop broker gave police a description for one of the people who had sold him stolen property which matched Powell. Powell maintains the charges were not only false but politically motivated due to her attempting to have criminal charges filed with the Attorney General of New York against several deputies of the Rochester Police Department whom she alleges assaulted and then threatened her when she tried to file a complaint with internal affairs on behalf of a member of her congregation who was the victim of racially motivated harassment from the police. Several members of Reverend Powell's congregations testified at trial that during the alleged burglary and assault Powell was leading a Bible study class at her church. Despite the apparent lack of evidence presented by the prosecution Powell was found guilty by an all-white jury in 2006 and sentenced to 16 years in prison. In 2009, while serving her sentence for assault and burglary, Powell was arrested for the June 6, 1992, shooting death of James Rutledge after a Jailhouse informant who claimed to have witnessed the decades old homicide identified Powell as being involved in the killing. Coincidentally this identification occurred as support was mounting in the community to appeal Powell's burglary conviction. In 2011, she was convicted of second degree murder based on the informants testimony and received a sentence of 25 years to life, to begin upon the completion of her 16 year sentence for assault and burglary. Powell is currently being held at The Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women and will be eligible for parole in the year 2045 when she is 84 years old. Her case has been highlighted as a clear example of injustice by many social activists and black power groups.

It originates at the crest of the San Gabriel Mountains in the Angeles National Forest, at the confluence of the Prairie Fork and Vincent Gulch near Mount Baden-Powell. It then flows south and west for to San Gabriel Reservoir, where it joins with the West Fork San Gabriel River. Although the East Fork is colloquially considered a separate river (to distinguish it from the West Fork), the U.S. Geological Survey officially lists the East Fork as the upper part of the main stem San Gabriel River, a fact is shown by topographical maps of the area. The major tributaries of the East Fork, from upstream to downstream, are the Prairie Fork, the Fish Fork (which rises near Mount San Antonio/Mount Baldy, the highest summit in the range), the Iron Fork and Cattle Canyon. The \\"Narrows\\" of the San Gabriel River is the deepest river gorge in the San Gabriel Mountains, flowing as much as below the nearby peak of Iron Mountain. Much of the upper half of the river is within the Sheep Mountain Wilderness. A major point of interest on the East Fork is the Bridge to Nowhere, a high concrete arch bridge that was once part of the East Fork Road before the rest of the road was destroyed by flooding in 1938. The East Fork Road was originally intended to connect the Los Angeles Basin to the Angeles Crest Highway, but was never completed due to the high cost of cutting and tunneling through the rugged East Fork Canyon. A later attempt to build a road through the East Fork via Shoemaker Canyon, in the 1950s, was also aborted due to lack of funds. Today the East Fork Road provides access to the Heaton Flats trailhead, a popular jumping-off points for visitors to the San Gabriel Mountains. The stretch of the river along and above East Fork Road is one of the most heavily used parts of the Angeles National Forest, and is visited by hikers, campers and recreational gold miners alike – as many as 15,000 per day in the summer, which has had considerable environmental impacts on the East Fork.

LSS was founded in 1948. The party was the main political force in Purulia District from the independence of India until the fall of the second United Front cabinet. It is not to be confused with the Gandhian social movement by the same name. Background LSS had been set up as a local social movement in Manbhum, by leaders like Nibaranchandra Dasgupta and Bibhuti Dasgupta, who had been released from jail in the early 1930s. LSS was a Gandhian movement working for Swaraj and social reform. They challenged caste hierarchies, preaching to Adivasis and Dalits to participate in social and political life on equal terms with upper caste Hindus. The organization sought to fight against discrimination against lepers. Foundation LSS was constituted as a political party by former leaders of the Indian National Congress, who had played a leading role in the Quit India movement in Purulia District. Notable members of this group included Bibhuti Dasgupta and Arun Ghosh. Through forming LSS they wanted to promote use of Bengali language in Bengali-dominated areas in southern Bihar state.

His works have been inspired by and compared to international artists and fellow abstractionists such as William de Kooning, Jackson Pollock, Hans Hoffman, Joan Miró and Mark Rothko. The majority of his initial works in his career were black and white paintings but he worked more extensively in colour after being treated for schizophrenia in his late twenties. He describes his work as his “subconscious mind expressing itself on the canvas.” His work is present in several private collections both locally and internationally and also in the National Collection of The Bahamas.  Early life and education  Hanna was born on June 25, 1936 in Nassau, Bahamas.James 2011. p.9. He was the oldest child to Leonard “Jakes” Johnson James 2011. p.29. and Mable HannaJames 2011. p.17. His interests in art began as a child in primary school. While working at the Customs Department and attending St. John's College high school, he met famous American muralist John St. JohnJames 2011. p.13. and began his first formal drawing lessons. Through the encouragement and mentoring of St. John, Hanna's dream to become an artist started to develop. He spent three weeks in Florida with the invitation of St John, using each other as live models and produced his first series of self-portraits.James 2011. p.14. It also gave him the opportunity to visit his first museum, The Lowe Art Museum at the University of Miami in Gables, Florida. During that time, St. John shared with Hanna a small abstract painting in which he expressed an affinity to the work and the feeling and memory forever stuck with him. Though John St. John was not artist working in pure abstraction, Kendal Hanna cited him as one of the most influential artist on his life and also his career. He later studied Marine Biology for a time and then worked at the Nassau General Post Office as a postal clerk. There he met Davis Rawnsley, an artist and aspiring potter from London, who had convinced him to visit the famous Chelsea Pottery after learning about Hanna's dream to start an art career.James 2011. p.10. Kendal would visit the Pottery during his work breaks and ultimately left the establishment to become one of the first Bahamian artists to work at the famous Chelsea Pottery. However, after the decline of the Pottery and the death of his mother in 1959, Hanna eventually resigned and went to pursue a career as a painter. In his early stages, his works were mostly figurative but he always had an experimental mind that ultimately was explored through Abstract Expressionism. While attending the Chelsea Pottery, he encountered more abstract pieces in the early 1990s in the form of ceramics and when asked by Charles Huggins whether the events influenced him, he replied: \\"It could have had some influence and did have some impact on me…(but) a lot has to do with the type of person I am. I believe I have an experimental mentality. I try to discover. Experiment and create something from an idea…I was in my twenties when I made the break…I have worked at it to develop it to the state it is today…”James 2011. p.15. In his early adulthood, Hanna, along with his friend Ron Stenson, decided to travel to the United States to discover more opportunities for employment and art production.James 2011. p.21. They traveled to Florida and then New York City, where Hanna faced many hardships making it day to day being broke but also enjoying the freedom the new city had to offer.James 2011. p.22. He spent almost a year in New York, making new friends, both local people and artists, working in different establishments and visiting art museums. His experience in visiting museums such as The Museum of Modern Art, The Whitney Museum, The Metropolitan Museum, and the Guggenheim stayed with him throughout his career.James 2011. p.23. In the end, Hanna returned to The Bahamas, overstaying his visit and was deported after turning himself in to the police.James 2011. p.24.  Return to Nassau  It was in New York when Kendal Hanna noticed his mental health was being afflicted, but it was not until his return to Nassau that the signs of mental degeneration became evident to himself and his family. He was ultimately was diagnosed with schizophrenia.James 2011. p.25. As a result, he was institutionalized and prescribed a series of electric shock therapy treatments four times a week (a treatment that proved unsuccessful). Spending two years within the facility, he suffered physical and mental abuse. After his release, Hanna used art to recover his motor capabilities and mental acuity. In the 1970s, about ten years after his mother's death, Hanna began working at the McAlpine Company and eventually married Norma Samuels.James 2011. p. 28. After his wedding and honeymoon, Hanna took in a vacation to Eleuthera, Bahamas without his wife. In the end, he saw his marriage as unconventional, and the two later separated after some time.  First Show and Career  During the late 1980s, Kendal Hanna suffered an extreme lost when his home was destroyed in a fire and subsequently lost everything, including his artworks. He later lived with his friends Basil and Gloria Cooper and used that as an opportunity to start anew his artistic practice. This led him to have his first solo exhibition at The Bahamian Art Gallery (BAG) in 1992.James 2011. p. 31. Hanna rented multiple spaces and apartments around Nassau but it was not until 2007 where he found his permanent residence at PopopStudios, an independence artist run studio space and gallery. It was decidedly the best decision for him, a move Hanna called “perfect” that allowed him to produce and function comfortably being surrounded with fellow artists like himself. In 2009, Kendal Hanna received the E. Clement Bethel Award from the College of the Bahamas for his significant contributions to Bahamian art. On June 25, 2011, The National Art Gallery of The Bahamas honored Kendal Hanna with a retrospective titled ‘“Happy Birthday To Me’ Kendal Hanna: A Retrospective.” Formally known as the Villa Doyle, the 1860s colonial mansion was renovated in the 1990s and developed as a national museum and historical site where “history could be recognized, unpacked, and interpreted.\\" It was timed to coincide with his 75th birthday and featured work that spanned his almost sixty-year career. With over 150 pieces of work present, Hanna's pieces encompassed classic nude studies, compelling abstract expressionist pieces and psychologically intense portraits. During the time of his exhibition, Hanna reminisced on his memories of the historical Villa Doyle. He had never thought his paintings would be shown in the very building he would stroll past with his mother. “…it’s sort of unbelievable.” In 2015, Kendal Hanna was chosen to exhibit in New York City at the Volta Fair. A documentary featuring his life, career and work process entitled “Brigidy Bram” is in post-production. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2400382/  Work and Process  Art was Hanna's way of coping with personal misfortunes and his continuous battle with mental illness. He believes his pieces function as a visual biography, inferring himself, his life, struggles, and passion to his audience using deliberate mark makings to tell the purest story of his life experience. He insists that his identity lives within the work: his identity as a black man and as a Bahamian. Hanna's work is seen as personal and deeply psychological, portraying his fascination with representation and self-representation. In the catalog featuring his retrospective “Happy Birthday To Me,” he confessed the difficulty audiences have when engaging with his work and infers: “Everybody is more familiar with what is visible in an object, what the eye is focused on outwardly. When people express themselves like this, it does surprise them. It is my subconscious mind expressing itself on the canvas. People will be faced with the unknown…”James 2011. p. 32.James 2011. p. 33. Though he is mostly categorized as a painter, many of his works incorporate mixed media elements and materials such as oils, crayons, and found objects. Hanna sees his work and his canvas as an extension of his own life. His methods of conceptualizations are meticulous and his process can take him hours before the mark making process has begun. He is well known to spend long periods of time on a single piece. One piece in particular, a self-portrait of a well- known acquaintance Vincent D’Aguilar, was constantly reworked and eventually relinquish to the buyer, to the dismay of Hanna.James 2011. p. 30. He spent two years working on that painting, and admitted that, while he was able to visualize his completed image, “as an abstractionist, how I work, the experience of my work and the timing are unpredictable.” He also talked about the impact of Rorschach tests he took when he was in Sandilands and they became a part of his painting process when creating portraits: “For me using this form was about questioning…my doctor would have me do Rorschach tests, asking me what I saw and thought when each was presented. I became influenced by that process, held on to it and now incorporate it into my art…” As the Ying/Yang symbol was used as a defining marker of their works produced as Chelsea's pottery, Hanna adopted the same principles in his paintings. He follows the principles of dark and light (Ying and Yang respectively) that is seen in his usage of colors, compositions and contrasting tones in paintings, drawings and sculptures. Hanna at times also grids that he keeps visible onto the painting that also reflect his methods of balancing chaos with order.  Current life  Hanna still currently resides in Nassau, Bahamas and works from his studio at Popopstudios International Center of the Arts where he occupied since 2007. Kendal Hanna during his invitation to the VOLTA Art Fair in New York reflects on his outlooks and achievements of being a successful artist: “Real curiosity in ideas, material, form and the environment, be it through drawing, sculpture or painting, and channeling that effort into hard work is the awesome responsibility and joy of an artist.”  Solo exhibitions  * 2011: Happy Birthday to Me, Kendal Hanna A Retrospective.

Intuitive and instrumental grief describes two ends of a grieving scale. Individuals who exhibit more qualities of the intuitive grieving style are called intuitive grievers. Individuals who exhibit more qualities of the instrumental grieving style are called instrumental grievers. Common qualities of intuitive grieving are: an internal experience characterized by extreme sadness and pain as well as an outward experience characterized by emotional expression (ex: tears). Common qualities of instrumental grieving are: an internal experience characterized by mental separation from the loss as well as an outward experience characterized by lack of emotion. Identification of an individual's particular style of grieving is important because an individual's particular style of grieving helps in creating an adequate treatment plan to assist the individual in coping with his or her loss.  Intuitive grief  Individuals who experience more qualities related to the intuitive grieving style experience and express their grief primarily through affect. Intuitive grievers develop more extreme emotional symptoms and cope with their loss mainly by sharing their feelings with others. These individuals are more likely to seek and/or accept community support through events such as self- help groups or one-on-one grief therapy.  Instrumental grief  Individuals who experience more qualities related to the instrumental grieving style are less likely to express emotion and often desire to rather master their feelings developed from the loss as well as master their surrounding environment. These individuals are marked by a more cognitive, problem-solving approach and are more likely to direct their energy into activities. Though instrumental grievers perceive loss more as a challenge to overcome rather than a threat, anger is usually the most readily expressed feeling.  Blended grief  Intuitive and instrumental grieving are two extreme styles of grieving located on a continuum. Because of this, it is rare to find people who belong purely to one style of a grieving pattern. The middle area between extreme intuitive grieving and extreme instrumental grieving is called blended grieving. People who exhibit qualities of both the intuitive grieving style as well as the instrumental grieving style are identified as blended grievers. Through blended grieving, a person naturally expresses grief in both cognitive (instrumental) and affective (intuitive) ways, however one style of grief is usually more dominant than the other. Gender bias Martin and Doka's first work on intuitive and instrumental grieving in 1996 emphasized “masculine” and “feminine” grief. Many of Martin and Doka's readers began confusing the masculine and feminine identification of grieving styles with male and female gender association. Intuitive and instrumental grieving patterns have been found to be gender related, however are not gender determined therefore “masculine” grieving was renamed to “instrumental” while “feminine” grieving was renamed to “intuitive”. The assumption that males are supposed to grieve through instrumental ways and that females are supposed to grieve through intuitive ways is related to male and female sex roles that are taught and reinforced within a person's culture. Traditionally, men have been raised to be more decisive, strong, successful and inexpressive which tends to lead males to be more private, intellectual and introspective in their grief; certain qualities associated with the instrumental grieving style. In addition, women have traditionally been raised to be more passive, dependent and emotionally expressive than males which tends to lead women to act as such in times of grief; aspects associated with the intuitive grieving style. Though there is correlation between gender and style of grieving, no pairing of gender and styles of grieving is right or wrong just as no particular style of grieving in general is right or wrong for an individual.

Life Umayr was the son of a certain al-Hubab and belonged to the prominent Dhakwan section of the large Arab tribe of Banu Sulaym.Stetkevych 2002, p. 340. His mother was a black African woman.Al-Jahiz, ed. Colville 2002, p. 34. The family lived in the Balikh River area of the Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia) region.Crone 1980, p. 107. Umayr served in the army of Umayyad caliph Mu'awiyah I (r. 661–680). Fighting under the command of his fellow Sulaymi tribesman, Safwan ibn Mu'attal,Al-Baladhuri, ed. Hitti 1916, p. 288. Umayr played an instrumental role in the Umayyads' capture of an Armenian fortress known as \\"Ḥiṣn Kamkh\\" (Kamacha) in 678. He acquired fame during this operation, with 9th-century historian al-Baladhuri writing: > ... Umair ibn al-Hubab as-Sulami, who climbed the wall [of the fortress] and > kept struggling single-handed until the Greeks [Byzantines] gave way and the > Moslems climbed up. Thus the reduction of Kamkh was due to Umair ibn al- > Hubab and was the thing in which he boasted and others boasted for him. — > Al-Baladhuri According to historian Patricia Crone, Umayr is better known for his role in the Second Muslim Civil War. Despite being a member of the Qaysi tribal faction, he maintained his allegiance to the Umayyads under Marwan I (r. 684–685) and the latter's son Abd al-Malik (r. 685–705) following the devastating Qaysi defeat in the Battle of Marj Rahit at the hands of the Umayyads and their Yamani allies, particularly the Banu Kalb tribe. However, the battle still left him and his tribesmen bitter toward their Kalbi rivals and the Umayyads, and this became apparent during the Battle of Khazir in 686. During that engagement, Umayr commanded the left wing of the Umayyad army led by Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad against the pro-Alid forces led by Ibrahim ibn al- Ashtar; before the two sides met, Umayr secretly met with Ibn al-Ashtar and offered to defect with his Qaysi-dominated regiment in the middle of battle. The result was an Umayyad rout and Ubayd Allah's slaying. Umayr was rewarded by Ibn al-Ashtar, al-Mukhtar's governor over Mosul and the Jazira, with the local governorships of Tur Abdin and Kfartutha (Kafr Tuta).Dixon 1971, p. 67. =Leader of the Qays= In a display of tribal valor, Umayr opted to join his fellow Qaysi, Zufar ibn al-Harith al-Kilabi at al-Qarqisiya instead of joining the pro-Alids' leader, al-Mukhtar al-Thaqafi, following Khazir.Crone 1980, p. 108. From Qarqisiyah, Umayr led punishing raids against the Kalb led by their chief Humayd ibn Hurayth ibn Bahdal. He or Zufar led a Qaysi raid against the Kalb at Iklil in the Samawah desert between Syria and Iraq, killing between 500 and 1,000 Kalbi tribesmen.Wellhausen 1927, pp. 202–203. Umayr's energetic entry into the Qays–Kalb feud made him the more active leader of the Qays, as Zufar was often bogged down defending al-Qarqisiya from Umayyad advances.Wellhausen 1927, p. 203. He led further attacks against the Kalb in Samawah, and almost killed Humayd at the village of Ka'aba. The Kalb were ultimately driven out of the Samawah by Umayr's attacks, albeit temporarily. Meanwhile, Umayr entangled the Qays into a bloody tit-for-tat war with the previously neutral Taghlib tribe when he led Sulaymi encroachments into Taghlibi territory along the Khabur River. Zufar failed in his attempts to mediate the dispute and eventually fell in line with Umayr's militant approach.Wellhausen 1927, p. 204. Umayr obtained sanction from Mus'ab ibn al- Zubayr of Iraq to attack the Christian Taghlib, and massacred many of them at Maksin along the Khabur. Raids and counter-raids followed at places straddling the Khabur, Balikh, Tigris and Tharthar rivers, with the Taghlib typically being the beaten force. However, in 689, the Taghlib killed Umayr in a battle at al-Hashshak along the Tharthar, near Tikrit. They then decapitated his corpse and delivered his head to Abd al-Malik, who was pleased with the death of the rebel chieftain. His death was celebrated in verse by the Taghlibi poet al-Akhtal.Stetkevych 2002, p. 106. Umayr's exploits and battlefield performance in the tribal feuds earned him \\"a reputation as one of the mightiest men of his day\\", according to Crone. Legacy Umayr's brother and sons all served as generals in the Umayyad army, with Tamim ibn al-Hubab serving in Yazid II's (r. 720–724) campaigns against the Kharijites of Kufa, and Umayr's sons Dhufafa and Khalid taking part in Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik's (fl. 705–738) expeditions against Constantinople. Though no third-generation descendants of Umayr are noted in the sources, a Sulaymi chief in North Africa who rebelled against the Aghlabids (800–909) claimed descent from Umayr.

Early years R. A. Bullen was born in St. George's in Bermuda, the son of Robert Gaze Bullen, a convict keeper in the Bahamas from 1848 to 1859, and his wife Elizabeth Anne. His siblings Mary Elizabeth Bullen (born 1848) and Arthur Brackenbury Bullen (born 1852) were also born in the Bahamas. The family returned to England when Bullen was aged 6 years. However, Bermuda held a special place in his affections and he returned there later in life and published an account of its geology. Bullen settled with his parents on the south coast and attended a private school in Gosport where his interest in Natural History began. On leaving school it was planned that he should join the Civil Service but a change in his circumstances led him becoming a schoolmaster while at the same time attending the University of London where he took his BA in 1873. Bullen was ordained in 1875 and continued to teach until he became a curate in 1883. He married Anna Maria Lloyd (1853-1918) on 19 December 1885 and they had one son and two daughters.Biography of R. A.

Robert Ashington Bullen - Geological Magazine October 1912 pgs 525-527 Career and interests It was at Shoreham that he befriended Sir Joseph Prestwich, who persuaded Bullen to carry out a series of researches in locations where fossil land and freshwater mollusca could be found, and in particular those connected with the remains of early Man. These researches he continued until 1911. In 1896 Bullen became Rector of Little Stukeley in Cambridgeshire (1898-9)Robert Ashington Bullen B.A., Rector of Little Stukeley: patron, Alwyn Bishop of Ely - The National Archives and subsequently Rector and Vicar of Wisley and Pyrford in Surrey (1901-5). After resigning the living at Pyrford he made his home first at Hurstpierpoint in Sussex and later at Heathside near Woking. He devoted much time to the work of the various scientific societies to which he had become attached, and in travelling in France, Italy, Spain, and elsewhere leading to his papers on the fossil mollusca of Mallorca, Catalonia and Bermuda, which were of particular interest. The death of his second daughter Evelyn Margaret Bullen in February 1910 affected him deeply and as a result he moved to Hilden Manor, Tollbridge. In 1912 he and his wife made a voyage to Gran Canaria and he was considering a second voyage preparatory to publishing an account of the geology and fossil shells of those islands at the time of his death.

It is the first production of the filmmaker María José Cuevas. The film shows a glimpse of the glory, sunset and resurgence of five of the main showgirls (vedettes) that triumphed in Mexico in the decades of the 1970s and 1980s. Plot They were the Queens of the Night in Mexico in the 1970's and 1980's. The names of the great vedettes illuminated the streets of Mexico City from the canopies of the big nightclubs, cabarets and theaters. But time passed. Nightlife changed in Mexico. New types of entertainment replaced them and the vedettes seemed to have been forgotten. Today, more than forty years of its splendor in the country's nightlife, Beauties of the Night explores the lives of five of the top vedettes of the golden years: Olga Breeskin, Lyn May, Rossy Mendoza, Wanda Seux and Princesa Yamal. The film shows the viewer a deeper facet of the current life of these five vedettes. Women who, despite the years and have taken their lives to the extreme, are full of life and with an enviable physical condition. Not only have they managed to reinvent themselves and survive in the show business, but also in life itself. Between laughter and tears, the film reflects the passage of years, emotions and personal challenges for the life of each of these women.Gatopardo: Beauties of the Night, Ladies of the Mexican Pop Culture Cast * Olga Breeskin * Lyn May * Rossy Mendoza * Wanda Seux * Princesa Yamal Production The title of the documentary evokes the film Bellas de noche, the first film of the so-called Cine de ficheras, which dates back to 1975. The idea of Cuevas to pay homage to these women arises from her childhood. Cuevas, daughter of the prestigious Mexican artist José Luis Cuevas, had contact with several of these women, who were friends of her father. Years later, Cuevas had a meeting with Princesa Yamal, who performed an Arab dance in front of her, giving her the idea of producing this documentary, whose realization lasted for a decade.Beauties of the Night: Press conference in YouTube The film delivers an exercise in which the contrasts of time come to light and unveils what lies behind the stardom. You can appreciate an honest, dynamic and effective exercise in which remains the curiosity to know more details. Although the documentary came from the idea of paying homage to these women, the relationship between them and the filmmaker María José Cuevas, became so close that they became a family.Gatopardo: Beauties of the Night, Ladies of the Mexican Pop Culture The vedettes Thelma Tixou, Sasha Montenegro and Princesa Lea were also considered to participate in the documentary, refusing for various reasons. The last two appear in the final credits in the acknowledgments section. The film is also favored by an enriching archive material.

Attempting to fly an aircraft to the South Pole, the pair run into trouble, tumbling out of control, and crashing in the Antarctic wastelands. Donald's leg is broken, and is left to die by James, whose motives are suspect. He can now have Diane all to himself. Rescued by the crew of a whaler, Donald is injured but survives. When he recovers, he vows vengeance on the man who left him to die. Returning home, James has proposed and marries Diane, Donald's former fiancée. Now, scarred and crazed, Donald searches out Dianne and James. Donald persuades William Holden (Edmund Breese), Diane's father, the sponsor of the first flight, to finance another flight to Antarctica. The same crew is resurrected but again the two pilots crash, and this time James is injured, unable to move because of a broken leg. Donald cannot bring himself to leave him, and together they make their way to safety.

It was published in 2013, and nominated for an NAACP Image Award.The Penguin Press, November 22, 2016 The novel follows the Sai family as they come to terms with their father Kweku Sai's death, and as they work through family troubles. Multiple points of view give insight into the characters' emotions and the repercussions of Kweku’s choices. The Wall Street Journal praised it as \\"irresistible from the first line\\".Ghana Must Go page at Penguin Random House. Plot The death of Kweku Sai, a renowned surgeon, in Ghana launches a series of events in his family's life. Although he has left them behind, his wife Fola and their four children—Olu, Kehinde, Taiwo, and Sadie—are left to deal with the repercussions of his passing and reconcile the conflicts he created. In the moment of his death, Kweku takes the audience through the time he did share with his family. From his youngest daughter, Sadie's, birth to the doomed surgery that tanked his career, the first part of the book explores the events that pushed him to leave. Fola is in Ghana when she learns of Kweku’s death, and asks their eldest son Olu to reunite his scattered siblings. Olu lives in Boston, Sadie is in school at Yale, Taiwo lives in New York City and the last they heard Kehinde was living in London. In coming together for the first time in years, they are forced to deal with the pain and obstacles that their father's abrupt desertion brought to their lives. For twins Kehinde and Taiwo, it is evident that they are no longer as close as they were as children and not even Fola knows why. Back in Ghana and living under the same roof, the family is forced to confront the events that have divided their family, and begin to reconnect after years of misunderstanding and unspoken feelings. Olu overcomes his fear of commitment, Sadie finds herself, and Fola learns what happened to Taiwo and Kehinde. The novel ends with the family on the path to healing and forgiveness. Characters Kweku Sai: Leaves Ghana and becomes a renowned surgeon in the United States. He had dreams of returning to Ghana as the successful prodigal son, but his mother's untimely death and obstacles in his career made this dream unattainable. He is able to create what looks like the perfect life for his family. But when he is fired and blacklisted in the medical community, the shame is too much for him to handle and he leaves them behind. For the rest of his life Folasadé Savage: She gives up law school to be with Kweku, and is happy to be a wife, mother and florist. When Kweku leaves her with their four children, she has to make difficult decisions to save their family. Her arc in the novel sees her coming to terms with a past that was largely ignored throughout her marriage to Kweku. Olukayodé Sai: Kweku and Fola's son, who takes after his father in career and temperament, is wary of repeating his father's mistakes. His father's departure makes him deeply afraid of commitments, so although he has been in a serious relationship with Ling for years, he refuses to label it or even address his feelings head on. In Ghana with Ling, his siblings, and the looming memory of his father he has to come to terms with the fact that he needs to live his life fully, and without fear of becoming his father. Kehinde and Taiwo Sai: Fola and Kweku's middle children are twins, and were exceptionally close as children. There is a running theme of their twin telepathy, but that connection is severed as a result of Kweku’s decision to leave. Kehinde is the only one who knows why their father left, and is traumatized by the choices he has had to make to protect Taiwo, so he retreats into his art. Taiwo resents her mother for sending her and Kehinde away after their father’s departure. She is deeply affected by experiences with her mother's family and embarks on a path of self-destruction. Kweku's death is the catalyst to repairing the relationships between Taiwo, Kehinde, and their mother. Folasadé (Sadie) Sai: Accidentally named after her mother, and affectionately referred to as \\"the baby\\". Although her birth was a significant moment in Kweku's life, she feels the least connected to him because he left when she was a baby. She attempts to find a place for herself in relation to her siblings; the beautiful Taiwo, famous artist Kehinde, and perfect Olu. It is not until she returns to her father's village that she is able to feel as if she belongs in her family. Themes Family: The novel encompasses family at the center of the plot. Although the members of the Sai family move on and continue their lives without communicating with each other, they have an unspoken connection that keeps them tied together. At times the connections are so strong, familial ties are not enough to explain it. Fola’s connection to her children and the twins connection to each other suggest something mystical to their connection. While time and distance separates the family over the years since Kweku’s departure, his death transcends their estrangement and brings the family back together. Migration: The impact of movement and migration is set by Kweku and Fola. War and expulsion are the driving factors that bring Fola and Kweku to the United States where they put down roots and start their family. Part of their identity is their habitual movement throughout the world that becomes a pattern in their lives. When situations become too much for them to handle, they flee. Fola and Kweku both move back home to Ghana after or in avoidance of serious confrontation. Redemption: The family does a lot to hurt each other, like all families do. While some of the things they do and say to each other seem irredeemable, in the end they find the strength to overcome their pain and forgive each other. Kweku’s death allows the family to heal the wounds they inflicted on each other as they come together and confront their old scars.

Ghana Must Go was favourably reviewed in a diverse range of publications, including The New York Times, The Economist, Entertainment Weekly, and Elle. Publishers Weekly in a starred review commented that the author's \\"gorgeous debut is a thoughtful look at how the sacrifices we make for our family can be its very undoing.... Reminiscent of Jhumpa Lahiri but with even greater warmth and vibrancy, Selasi’s novel, driven by her eloquent prose, tells the powerful story of a family discovering that what once held them together could make them whole again.\\"\\"Ghana Must Go\\" (review), Publishers Weekly, January 7, 2013. The review in The Independent by Margaret Busby refers to it as a \\"stunning opening act\\",Busby, Margaret, \\"Ghana Must Go, By Taiye Selasi\\", The Independent, March 29, 2013. while Diana Evans writes in The Guardian: > Before you get to page one of this book there is a noisy overture.

Afropolitan identity is rooted in the idea of cosmopolitanism with African roots. It is meant to describe a new generation of African emigrants with global citizenship. The term is also relevant for those living within the continent of Africa as well as there are several cities with the same artistic and cosmopolitan ambiance as other major cities around the world. One of the key elements of Afropolitanism is the World Wide Web. Part of why Selasi’s term has become so widespread is because the internet has facilitated a form for cultural mobility. Mobility is another key element in this concept; mobility of both people and ideas. Afropolitanism is a concept in response to Afro-pessimism. Selasi notes that the term is used to complicate the idea of Africa as something other than just its problems; it is \\"the effort to understand what is ailing in Africa alongside the desire to honor what is wonderful, unique\\". =Criticisms of Afropolitanism= The term has also received criticism for its elitism, class bias, and commodification. The Afropolitan lifestyle of travel and pop culture and consumerism is not necessarily representative of Africans or African immigrants throughout the world. Critics compare the elitism of Afropolitanism with that of the women in the feminist movement who often failed to acknowledge their privilege as middle class white women speaking for all women. In one effect, Afropolitan contests the notion of Africa as the a priori, the already-known, that has dominated African literature in Western markets. While Afropolitanism attempts to combat the single story by providing a positive alternative through the narratives of the well-travelled few, it may still fall into the trap of becoming the dominant story. In this way, it only further overlooks the stories and complexities of those who are not as privileged as the Afropolitans of the world. The Afropolitan experience may be misrepresentative of the authentic African experience, as fictional literature simplifies the complexities of a globalized world. It is difficult to identify African identity in this literature because \\"different protagonists come from different countries and do not necessarily share common cultural or historical backgrounds\\". When this ideology becomes the dominant concept, it may conflict with the people who do not categorize under the \\"scattered tribe of pharmacists, physicists, physicians\\" that typically characterize being Afropolitan. =Afropolitanism in Ghana Must Go= The complexity of Afropolitanism is portrayed through Selasi’s characterization in Ghana Must Go, as each character explores his or her own identity through contemporary Afro-diasporic politics. The novel also carries the essential Afropolitanism component of mobility as a major theme. The title of the book is a reference to the expulsion of Ghanaian refugees from Nigeria. Migrant displacement within Africa is a form and a source of the Sai family’s mobility. Kweku and Fola’s move to the United States, the upbringing of their children in a country and culture different of their own, their rise in social class, the children’s ivy league educations and artistic talents, and finally, the return to the family’s origins in Ghana are all examples of the fundamental elements of Afropolitanism. Mobility is depicted through multiple aspects: class mobility is represented in the success that \\"characterizes the Sai’s lives in the US\\" as Kweku brilliantly excel in his surgical practice. Cultural mobility is also exemplified through the move to and from Africa and the US, the family Nigerian-Ghanaian-Scottish heritage, and Kehinde's movement from the US to Ghana to the US to London. The novel typifies the notions of Afropolitanism in its mobilities and connection to \\"African communities, nations and traditions\\" as well as its viability \\"across cultures, languages and states\\". =Other Afropolitan-related scholarly works= *Kwame Appiah's essay \\"Ethics in a World of Strangers\\" (2006) describes cosmopolitanism through its morality in a globalized context, and is roughly contemporary with Selasi's \\"Bye-Bye Babar\\". *Negotiating Afropolitan is a compilation of essays by various scholars in African studies analyzing borders and spaces in African literature.

The SC-8850 was the first sound module to incorporate the new General MIDI Level 2 standard. The SC-8850 uses a PCM sampling engine based on that of the SC-88 Pro, and supports 128-voice polyphony with 64-part multitimbrality. It came preloaded with the soundsets of all older Sound Canvas models, as well as the CM-32 and MT-32. Aimed at personal computer users, the SC-8850 features 1,703 instrument patches, including the GS sounds and additional GM2 sounds. The selection of effects includes reverb, chorus, and Roland's own Insertion EFX, which adds effects like vibrato, distortion, tremolo, etc. SC-8820 Alongside the SC-8850, Roland released the Roland ED SC-8820, an inexpensive cut-down version of the MIDI module, smaller than the 8850. Both sound canvases could be rackmounted alongside each other. The Roland SC-8820 model lacks the large LCD screen and extended controls of the SC-8850. Some sounds are different in comparison to the 8850, but has a map that is compatible with the 8850. Both models have external appearance similar to Roland's older models. Roland later released the SK-500 in 2000, a version of the SC-8820 with a 49 keys keyboard and no MIDI input, requiring users to use either the USB or RS-232C connections to send data. The Sound Canvas VA plugin emulates an SC-8820 with minor inaccuracies.  SC-D70  In 2001, Roland released the Roland ED SC-D70, which was a SC-8820 with a digital output, among other differences. It had a sampling rate of 44.1/48 kHz, instead of 32 kHz sounds the SC-8820 had. The sample rate could be selected between 44.1 and 48.

The creek originates in the Coast Ranges and flows east for about to join the Sacramento River, at a point about northeast of Corning in Tehama County. Thomes Creek is a highly seasonal stream and drains a mostly rural watershed of some . There are no permanent dams on the creek, although there are some small diversions for agriculture and domestic water supply, and the overall water quality is considered good. The upper of Thomes Creek are rated Class IV–V+ (\\"very difficult\\") for whitewater kayaking and rafting. Name origin Thomes Creek was named after Robert Hasty Thomes, a pioneer who arrived to the area in the 1840s. Thomes' name has been frequently mispronounced and misspelled, resulting in many officially-recorded variant names such as \\"Thomas Creek\\", \\"Thoms Creek\\" and \\"Toms Creek\\". Geography Thomes Creek begins at Kingsley Lake, a small pond at elevation in the Mendocino National Forest. The lake is in a saddle between Solomon Peak, and Sugarloaf Mountain, near the Tehama-Trinity County line. The creek flows south through a deep valley for about and turns east at the confluence with Willow Creek. It passes through the narrow Thomes Gorge, also known simply as \\"The Gorge\\", and emerges from the mountains near Paskenta. From there it flows east-northeast through the semi-arid foothills of the Coast Ranges past Henleyville, Richfield and Tehama to join the Sacramento River at river mile 226 (km 364). The upper watershed is rugged, mountainous and highly prone to flooding and landslides. The highest point in the watershed is the summit of Mount Linn (South Yolla Bolly Mountain) at in the Yolla Bolly-Middle Eel Wilderness. The lower part of the creek flows over a wide cobbled alluvial bed composed of coarse gravel and large boulders. Due to the seasonal nature of precipitation in this area, the lower part of Thomes Creek is often dry during the summer. The watershed receives most of its precipitation in the form of rain, though snow falls frequently at elevations above . The average precipitation in the lowlands is , while in the mountains it can be as high as . Water quality in Thomes Creek is considered good although it has been impacted by high rates of erosion, caused in part by the unstable sedimentary rock that makes up much of the Coast Ranges, but also from human activities such as ranching, logging, agriculture and mining. =Discharge= A U.S. Geological Survey stream gage at Paskenta measured the discharge of Thomes Creek between October 1920 and September 1996. The average annual flow was , with a monthly average ranging from in February to in October. The highest recorded flow was on December 22, 1964 during the Christmas flood of 1964. Ecology The creek provides habitat for as many as 22 fish species according to a 1982 study, including Sacramento pikeminnow, Sacramento sucker, hardhead, California roach and speckled dace. The creek is host to significant runs of steelhead trout, as well as resident populations of rainbow trout (landlocked steelhead) above the waterfalls in the Gorge which form partial barriers to fish passage. The creek is also home to spring-run chinook salmon.

The stores are partially automated, with customers able to purchase products without being checked out by a cashier or using a self-checkout station. As of 2020, there are 27 open and announced store locations in Seattle, Chicago, San Francisco and New York City. Amazon Go stores were conceptualized and tested by a team of Amazon executives, who constructed a 15,000-square-foot mock supermarket in a rented warehouse in Seattle, before revealing the work to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in 2015. The first store, located in the company's Day 1 building, opened to employees on December 5, 2016, and to the public on January 22, 2018. The flagship store sells products such as prepared foods, meal kits, limited groceries and liquor. A larger variant, Amazon Go Grocery, opened in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood on February 25, 2020. The following month Amazon began to offer its technology to other retailers so that their customers could make purchases without the involvement of cashiers or Amazon accounts. Technology and implementation Amazon uses several technologies to automate Go stores, including computer vision, deep learning algorithms, and sensor fusion for the purchase, checkout, and payment steps associated with a retail transaction. The store concept is seen as a revolutionary model that relies on the prevalence of smartphones and geofencing technology to streamline the customer experience, as well as supply chain and inventory management. However, public rollout of the Seattle Amazon Go prototype location was delayed due to issues with the sensors' ability to track multiple users or objects within the store, such as when children move items to other shelves or when more than one customer has a similar body habitus. The Amazon Go app for iOS and Android links to their Amazon account and is the primary method of paying for items at the store, alongside cash at certain locations. The app is required to enter the store, which has turnstiles that scan a QR code generated on the app. The app allows users to add others to their Amazon account, so a family's purchases can be charged to the same bill. The ceiling of the store has multiple cameras and store shelves have weight sensors, to detect which item(s) a customer took. If a customer takes an item off the shelf, it will be added to the customer's virtual cart. Similarly, if a customer places an item back on the shelf, it is removed from the customer's virtual cart. Amazon added a smart shopping cart called the Dash Cart to their new store in Los Angeles. The cart automatically detects the items put in it and calculates total cost using cameras, scale, weight sensors, and computer vision equipped on each shopping cart. Locations As of March 2020, there are 27 store locations (both established and announced) in the United States. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" - ! style=\\"width:30px;\\"  # ! City and state !

In October 2016, Business Insider reported that they had seen internal Amazon documents detailing plans to open as many as 2,000 stores over the next ten years. This was refuted by an Amazon spokesman, who insisted the company was still learning. Entrance and exit turnstiles at the first Amazon Go store The Verge reported that the first store was scheduled to open to the public in early January 2017, preceded by a December 2016 beta version for Amazon employees only. At it was only the size of a corner convenience store. By October 2017, the store had yet to open to the public due to issues with the technology tracking over 20 people at one time. The public opening finally took place on January 22, 2018. In addition to stocking name brands and local brands, the store sells many of Amazon's house brands, such as Wickedly Prime and 365. Food stamps and public assistance for low income people are not accepted, nor are customers without smartphones, or with smartphones that do not have the Amazon Go app downloaded. A second Downtown Seattle location at the Madison Centre opened on August 27, 2018. The third Amazon Go store, at the Troy Block complex in South Lake Union, is the second largest at and opened in September 2018. In May 2018, The Seattle Times reported that Amazon was planning to open Amazon Go stores in Chicago and San Francisco; and in September, it was confirmed that the company planned to open a store in New York City was confirmed. In September 2018, Amazon Go opened its first location outside of Seattle at the company's offices in the Chicago Loop. That same month, Bloomberg News reported Amazon was considering plans to open as many as 3,000 Amazon Go locations across the United States by 2021. An Amazon Go location was opened in San Francisco on October 23, 2018, at 98 Post Street. In response to potential discrimination against low-income people, San Francisco, Philadelphia, and New Jersey have passed legislation banning cashless stores and retailers. A new Amazon Go store in New York City opened on May 7, 2019, with cash acceptance in response to previous criticism over the use of app- only purchases and its effects on the poor. In response to the legislation, stores in San Francisco also accept cash, with an attendant at the front letting in and checking out customers if they do not have the app. On February 25, 2020, Amazon opened the first Amazon Go Grocery store in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood. The Go Grocery store is significantly larger than other Go stores, at , and offers 5,000 items, including fresh produce and baked goods. A second Go Grocery location opened in September 2020 in the Overlake neighborhood of Redmond, Washington.

As hooks states, white slave-owners would punish their slaves regularly simply for looking at them. Hooks' essay is a work of feminist film theory that criticizes both the male gaze through Michel Foucault's 'relations of power' and the prevalence of white feminism in feminist film theory. The oppositional gaze encompasses modes of looking that employ reflexive gazes such as: * The shared gaze * The repressed gaze * The phallocentric gaze * The black male gaze * The interrogating gaze  Background  The concept was first developed as a critique of film theory by bell hooks in her essay \\"The Oppositional Gaze: Black Female Spectators\\". hooks describes the gaze of a black body as repressed, denied, and ultimately interrogating. Through critical discussion around black women and cinema, the oppositional gaze enters as a way for black people to attain agency to combat white supremacy. As a result of the racist portrayals of black people in white-dominated cinema, independent black film arose. However, hooks notes that male black filmmakers represented black women in their films as objects of male gaze which inherently perpetuated white supremacy, as the black female body was presented only to enhance and maintain white womanhood as an object of the phallocentric gaze As a child, hook's first encounter with Sapphire from Amos 'n' Andy \\"...explored both the negation of black female representation in cinema and television and black women's rejection of these images. [Sapphire's] black female image was not the body of desire. There was nothing to see. She was not us\\". As hooks concludes on the black characterization of Sapphire, \\"How could we long to be there when our image, visually constructed, was so ugly\\".  Black female spectatorship  In \\"The Oppositional Gaze: Black Female Spectators\\", hooks gives the rubric that black woman are not only underrepresented in film, but they are also not allowed to 'look' either. Looking implores a sense of power that is removed from the black female body, to play the role of object in direct relation to white female existence. In 2015, Viola Davis was quoted by Entertainment Weekly saying, \\"Toni Morrison said that as soon as a character of color is introduced in a story imagination stops…I mean, I’m a black woman from Central Falls, Rhode Island. I’m dark-skinned. I’m quirky. I’m shy. I’m strong. I’m guarded. I’m weak at times. I’m sensual. I’m not overtly sexual. I am so many things in so many ways, and I will never see myself on screen”. It is beneath this very umbrella that hooks' concept of the oppositional gaze is present, as Davis, a decorated actress and producer, states the realities of what it means to be a black woman in film. This statement came after Davis was awarded as the first black woman to win the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series.  Male gaze  \\"‘The Oppositional Gaze’ by bell hooks is the rejection of Laura Mulvey’s paper, Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema (1975)\\". Mulvey's text analyses Lacan's mirror stage within film, concluding that subjectivity is \\"the birth of the long love affair/ despair between image and self-image which has found such intensity of expression in film and such joyous recognition in the cinema audience\\". She furthers this point by criticizing the \\"male movie star's glamorous characteristics\\" as not subject to an objectifying gaze, but rather a more powerful stance as the 'ideal ego' developed in the beginning stages of recognition in front of the mirror. Mulvey defines the \\"split between active/ male and passive/ female\\" as the pleasure in looking through which the determining male gaze stylizes the female figure. hooks rebuts this claim stating, \\"Black female spectators 'actively' chose not to identify with the film's imaginary subject because such identification was disenabling\\". The concept of seeing one's self in opposition to the 'ideal ego' must begin with recognition of one's body as comparably different. Black female representation in film exists primarily in opposition to the white woman's body. Thus, black women often remain in search of a mirror stage because they metaphorically have yet to see true representations of themselves. hooks gives an example of this rare recognition through two characters in the film \\"Passion of Remembrance\\". She writes, \\"Dressing to go to a party, Louise and Maggie claim the 'gaze'. Looking at one another, staring in mirrors, they appear completely focused on their encounter with black femaleness\\". Mulvey's criticisms present exclusionary perspectives which inundate the white female body as a totalizing categorization of all women. Not only is the representation of Black women significantly marginalized within film but they are further misrepresented as stereotyped objects to which the male gaze is rarely, if ever applied. This concept leads hooks to ask, \\"Are we really to imagine that feminist theorists writing only about images of white women... do not 'see' the whiteness of the image?\\". The oppositional gaze serves as \\"a gesture of resistance\\" to not only the male gaze but also toward the oppression of minorities through cinema by the all- inclusive gendering of woman. This gaze criticizes the doubling effect of objectification by \\"turning away [as] one way to protest, to reject negation\\".  Feminine gaze  Judith Butler theorizes the feminine gaze as \\"a pervasive heterosexism in feminist theory\\". In her essay \\"The Question of Social Transformation\\", Butler states, \\"Through performativity, dominant and nondominant gender norms are equalized. But some of those performative accomplishments claim the place of nature or claim the place of symbolic necessity...\\". These theories criticize the male gaze and its objectification of 'women' as it predominantly excludes more than just the Black oppositional gaze but further problematizes the subjectivity of gendering male verses female. Furthermore, 'woman' as heterogenous sex object functions for and within the patriarchy, reinforcing \\"white supremacist capitalist imperialist dominating 'gaze'\\"  Olympia's Maid  The surrounding controversy of Édouard Manet's Olympia (1863) highlights the confrontational gaze as defiant and critical within the context of its time. However, there is a second gaze within this painting that is \\"cooperating with the West's construction of not- white women as not-to-be-seen\\". Olympia, pegged as a prostitute, makes direct eye contact with viewers while her 'black servant' \\"looms in the shadows\\" as background. In her essay titled, \\"Olympia's Maid: Reclaiming Black Female Subjectivity\\", Lorraine O'Grady states, \\"...only the white body remains as the object of a voyeuristic, fetishizing male gaze. The not-white body has been made opaque by a blank stare...\\". This \\"blank stare\\" through a body of alterity reiterates bell hooks' definition of the oppositional gaze. The deliberate characterization of the 'black servant' is ideologically rooted in the constructs of black female identity as Mammy, Jezebel, and Sapphire. As O'Grady declares, \\"Forget euphemisms. Forget 'tonal contrast'. We know what she is meant for: she is Jezebel and Mammy, prostitute and female eunuch, the two-in-one\\". Olympia's maid serves not only as the maid but as the opposing body of difference to whiteness; both visually and sexually. Within Freudian theory, people of color are \\"symbolically and even theoretically excluded from sexual difference\\". Olympia, although defiant as gazing prostitute, remains as a unitary sign of the female body in the West. \\"It has an obverse and a reverse\\". As hooks says, \\"…[this] image functions solely to reaffirm and reinscribe patriarchy\\". These comparative power relations conjure up opposing forces that transfer agency from one side to the 'other'. Michel Foucault insists that there is the possibility of resistance to domination and therefore an oppositional gaze exists. While Olympia confronts the male gaze, her maid confronts the repressed gaze, the oppositional gaze, and the gaze of recognition.

She emerges from the general background for two notable events in her history, one in 1813 when the French Navy captured and released her, and then between 1826 and 1830 for a whaling voyage. Career On 27 August 1807, Captain John Carman received a letter of marque for Lusitania.Letter of Marque, - accessed 14 May 2011. =Capture and release= In 1813 Lusitanias owner was Buckle, and her master changed from Bennett to Johnston. On 27 November 1813 Lusitania and four other merchant vessels left Portsmouth in a convoy under escort by . The other four were: *Blendon Hall, 473 tons (bm), Barr, master, which had been sailing from London to Bermuda; *John O'Gaunt, 426 tons (bm), P. Inglis, master, which had been sailing from London to Martinique; *Aurora, Scheidt, master, which had been sailing to Amelia Island; and, *Superb, 130 tons (bm), R. Roberts, master, which had been sailing from Gibraltar to England. Due to a heavy storm, the five merchantmen lost contact with the convoy and its escort. On 6 December they were in the Atlantic Ocean when the French frigate Clorinde captured all five (). The French took off the crews of four vessels and scuttled three. They kept Lusitania as a cartel and put all their captives aboard her. In their haste, they failed to sink Blenden Hall. They then permitted Lusitania to sail to a British port. On 18 December brought Blenden Hall into Plymouth. There, Blenden Hall was reunited with her crew, which had arrived that same day on Lusitania.Lloyd's List №4831. Accessed 3 December 2016. =Voyages to Australia= The Register of Shipping (RS) for 1823 showed Lusitania with Langdon, master, Buckle, owner, and trade London-New South Wales.RS (1823), Seq.№637. She had departed London 6 July 1821 with general cargo and passengers. She had arrived in the River Derwent, Van Diemen's Land on 28/29 October 1821. Hobart Town Gazette and Van Diemen's Land Advertiser, 3 November 1821, p.2. Langdon made a second voyage that reached Sydney in May 1823. =Whaling= In 1825 Lusitania underwent a large repair. Thereafter she is described as a bark.Lloyd's Register (1826), Seq. №L668. Lusitania left Britain on 21 October 1826 for a whaling voyage to Timor. Her owner was Thomas Sturge & Co., and her master was Robert Ross. She was at St Iago, Cape Verde, on 5 December. She sighted the Australian coast near Shark Bay on 21 April 1827. By 20 May she was at Timor, where she landed five Dutch missionaries. A few days later, on 1 June, Lusitania was at Coupang. Between 21 and 25 November 1828 and 2 February 1829 she was whaling off New Guinea. In November 1828 she was at Saint George's Channel, where she encountered many \\"old friends\\" among the locals, suggesting that she had been that way before. On 2 February she spoke Cyrus. Nine days later Lusitania was at Carteret Bay, where she traded with islanders who had come some distance overland to trade a hog for an old whaling lance. Lusitania was again at Coupang on 27 April. By 1829 illness aboard Lusitania was so bad that she had to return home. She returned via Delagoa Bay and the Cape of Good Hope. She returned to Britain on 26 January 1830 with 500 casks and 36 tanks of whale oil. Fate Lusitanias entries in Lloyd's Register in the 1830s show her master as C.Brown, but are otherwise essentially blank. Lloyd's List did report on 16 September 1834 that Lusitania, Brown, master, had stranded on Fastbro Reef (possibly Falsterborev). Lusitania was last listed in Lloyd's Register in 1838, but the listing had been unchanged for several years and showed no owner or trade.

The facility takes up a whole city block along Denny Way and features a community center, interpretive exhibits, a dog park, and public art. The substation was proposed in the early 2000s, during redevelopment of South Lake Union into a high-tech hub. A former Greyhound bus garage was acquired by Seattle City Light and demolished in 2014. Construction on the Denny Substation, including a street vacation to close part of Pontius Avenue, began in 2016 and was completed in 2018, at a cost of $210 million. History Under construction in early 2017 Historically, the South Lake Union neighborhood of Seattle, located to the north of downtown and east of the Seattle Center, was a manufacturing district whose electrical power was supplied by the Broad Street Substation. After the failure of the Seattle Commons plan in the 1990s, which proposed a large city park over the neighborhood, the land was opened for development by Paul Allen's Vulcan Real Estate, which envisioned it as a hub for biotech and high tech firms. Vulcan and Seattle City Light began talks of collaborating to build a $160 million substation in Interbay or South Lake Union in 2003, expecting the additional high tech firms to put a strain on the Broad Street substation and neighborhood lines laid in the early 2000s. In 2005, Seattle City Light determined that adding capacity at the Broad Street substation through new transformer banks would be sufficient for the area's needs until the mid-2010s. Seattle City Light proposed demolishing the Greyhound bus garage on Denny Way for its new substation in 2006, with consultants recommending that the city acquire the site for $40 million as soon as possible. The site was purchased by Seattle City Light in October 2008 and vacated by Greyhound in 2010. From 2012 to 2014, Seattle City Light demolished the Greyhound facility and removed contaminated soils in preparation for construction. During the period between environmental cleanup and the start of construction, the vacant lot was used for a series of temporary public art installations collectively called All Rise. Final approval for the project was granted in August 2015 by the Seattle City Council, who also approved the substation's unconventional design incorporating public benefits in exchange for a street vacation. Walsh Construction was awarded the construction contract for the substation project, working alongside subcontractors Valley Electric, W.A. Chester and Transcon. Construction of the substation began in May 2016, and by the end of the year, the first outer walls were erected. The substation's three transformers, each weighing , were installed in 2017. The Denny Substation was energized in April 2018 and was formally opened in October, becoming the first new substation built by Seattle City Light in 30 years. Construction of the substation required long-term closures of a westbound lane on Denny Way and postponed the installation of a bus lane on the street. A formal opening ceremony was held on July 20, 2019, with remarks from city leaders and events sponsored by local businesses. The substation began supplying electricity later that year and is planned to be linked to another downtown substation after 2020. Design Opening day ceremonies at the Denny Substation on July 20, 2019 The Denny Substation features an unusual design that incorporates public spaces and community amenities into an otherwise utilitarian structure. The substation, designed by architectural firm NBBJ, is shaped in the form of an acute trapezoid, with its longest side facing Denny Way. The structure slopes inward, allowing for sunlight to reach the open spaces surrounding the substation. The outer walls use stainless steel panels ( above street level) with a elevated pedestrian ramp to provide views of the cityscape and the substation's interior. In exchange for a street vacation that eliminated a block of Pontius Avenue, the Denny Substation project is required to include public benefits. The substation has of open space located on its western side, including an off-leash area for dogs and public art. At the southeast corner of the facility is a community space with a gallery space, exhibit hall, a small theater, and an educational center known as the \\"Energy Inspiration Center\\". A King County Metro bus stop on Denny Way will be integrated into the substation, with enhanced shelters and real-time arrival information. A sound art installation was placed in a nearby alley, projecting the noise of rushing water in reference to the hydroelectric facilities located around the region. The substation has two major pieces of public art, as part of the municipal percent for art program. Transforest by Lead Pencil Studio is a sculpture that combines the forms of an old-growth tree and a modern transmission tower. On the exterior walls of the substation house Ned Khan's Switchwall, consisting of a strip of colored lights that change based on wind flows. Earlier design concepts featured a more standard substation with walls, or incorporating the facility into the base of a high-rise building. The chosen design was described as a \\"a celebration of the functionality\\" and called the \\"coolest electrical substation ever\\" by Slate. Lead designer John Savo of NBBJ stated that they \\"[didn't] want it to be your grandfather's substation\\", desiring a facility that would \\"engage [with] the community, to make it an amenity and not a distraction\\". Cost When first proposed in the 2000s, the substation project was estimated to cost up to $150 million because of space limits and mitigation. The price rose to $174 million by 2014 after integration of public benefits and open space, as well as the relocation of the Amazon headquarters to nearby Denny Triangle. After the completion of design work and environmental cleanup in 2015, the substation's cost was revised to $210 million because of unexpected soil contamination and the need for newer electrical equipment. The substation's construction costs are funded by Seattle City Light through regular rate increases for customers as part of their six-year Strategic Plan. Specifications The Denny Substation will have an initial capacity of 50 Megavolt-ampere (MVA), and could increase to 405 MVA with facilities expansions. An underground distribution network, scheduled to be completed in 2020, will direct electricity from the substation to the Denny Triangle and South Lake Union neighborhoods. The substation will be connected to the Massachusetts Substation in SoDo via a 115-kilovolt (kV) transmission line through Downtown Seattle. The use of a gas-insulated switchgear in the Denny Substation will allow for a smaller footprint; the facility will also use solar cells to produce its electricity and a heat recovery system. Outside consultants hired by the city government in 2018 later concluded that the overall demand in the Denny Triangle and South Lake Union area would rise to 60 megawatts by 2027, far below the 180-megawatt capacity that the substation was designed for.

It is the story of Gertie Nevels and her family's migration from their Kentucky homeland to industrial Detroit during World War II. First published in 1954, the novel earned a 1955 nomination for the National Book Award. Its New York Times book reviewer called it a superb novel, notable for its strength and the glowing richness of character and scene. In 1971, Joyce Carol Oates characterized this novel as \\"our most unpretentious American masterpiece\\". Plot As the book begins, Gertie Nevels, a Kentucky mountain woman, is struggling to take her sick child down the mountain to see a doctor. She is able to reach the road on the family mule and then to stop a passing car and convince its reluctant occupants to drive her to the doctors office. Because her son is in imminent danger of death from suffocation, Gertie performs an emergency tracheotomy . They go to the doctor's office. The boy recovers. During the next part of the book, we get a glimpse of Gertie's life in the mountains, where she is close to her husband Clovis, her five children, her parents, and the community. She is very much at home and fulfilled in this environment, surrounded by nature and connected with the people she loves. She is extremely competent in this mountain life. She thoroughly knows the Bible. Among her many talents is a particular gift for whittling, which she uses to make practical items like ax handles and creative work like dolls. She is gradually carving a sculpture out of a large block of cherry wood, although she does not know if the figure that will eventually emerge will be Christ or Judas. Her dream is to buy the old Tipton place for the family so they will have a better home and can farm for themselves rather than as sharecroppers, but the war is intruding on this peaceful life. Men from the community are fighting overseas, Gertie's brother has just been killed in the war, and Clovis's coal delivery business is suffering. Then Clovis is called into the military induction center. Not drafted, Clovis goes instead to Detroit to do war work in the factories. Unbeknownst to Clovis, after years of careful saving and with some money inherited from her brother, Gertie buys the Tipton place and begins to move the family into their new home. But word soon reaches her that Clovis is expecting them to join him in Detroit. Under pressure from her mother, Gertie is convinced to give up the Tipton place. She gets her money back and prepares to go with her children to Detroit to join Clovis, who knew nothing about the home purchase. Giving up her dream of the home is a heartbreaking loss for Gertie, but at least she expects life will be better for her children in Detroit. When they arrive in Detroit, however, they find that life is in many ways worse for them. The wartime housing project apartment is small and the neighborhood industrial. The schools are bad, and the winter is hard, the food poor. Money is short and the family must often borrow to buy necessities. There is not always enough food to feed the family. She begins to waiver in her Christian faith. Clovis's work can be unsteady. Gertie develops some new friends among the other women in the housing project, and she finds that she is able to sell her carvings which helps them get by. Later, Gertie reluctantly lets Clovis convince her to use an electric saw to make the dolls to increase her sales, even though these machine-made dolls are ugly compared to her beautiful hand-carved dolls. Although their new life is in many ways unpleasant, Gertie and Clovis do their best to adapt. They are completely out of place in this setting, though, and the family begins to suffer more and more serious problems. First, her oldest boy runs away to return to the mountains. Then, her beloved daughter Cassie, a sensitive child who simply cannot adapt to the new life, is killed by a train in an accident indirectly caused by Gertie's well-meaning but misguided efforts to try to help Cassie fit in. Then, her husband is increasingly drawn into union battles, Clovis first a victim and eventually a perpetrator of serious strike-related violence. At last, Gertie sacrifices the large wooden sculpture she has been working on throughout the book. At a moment of particular financial distress, she cuts up the sculpture for wood to make dolls for sale to help support her family. Style The style of this novel has been characterized as Social Realism for its realistic depictions of working class life. Background In a 1983 interview, Arnow said she got to know many back hills women while teaching in a one-room Kentucky school. Later, Arnow moved to a housing project in Detroit. This was during the Appalachian migration, which saw huge numbers of mountain people moving north to work in war-related, automobile manufacturing, and other industries. However, in this interview, Arnow stressed that The Dollmaker story was in no way autobiographical. Rather, she said the story was created in her imagination.

The U.S. Army Garrison - Daegu, headquartered at Camp Henry in Daegu, manages the installation and provides base operations services for the people who live and or work at Camp Carroll. Major tenant units on Camp Henry are the 19th Sustainment Command (Expeditionary) and the 403rd Army Field Support Brigade—Korea (Provisional). History Built by the Imperial Japanese Army in 1921, what became known as Camp Henry served as the headquarters for Jirō Minami, Governor-General of Korea between 1936 and 1942, as well as Japanese forces stationed in the Daegu area. When Korea was liberated from Japan in 1945, the camp was taken over by the Republic of Korea Army. During the Korean War, the camp saw little action because of its location inside the northern edge of the Pusan Perimeter. After the Korean War, the camp was used by the United States.

After the French and Indian War (1754-1763), Great Britain issued the Proclamation of 1763 that forced many English settlers out of the land west of the Appalachians in order to prevent future conflicts.

It is dimly visible to the naked eye under good viewing conditions, having an apparent visual magnitude of 5.89. Based upon an annual parallax shift of 24.71, it is located 132 light years away. The system is moving closer with a heliocentric radial velocity of −14 km/s. Radial velocity measurements taken at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria, British Columbia Canada in 1919 led to the determination by William Edmund Harper that HR 7484 is a double-lined spectroscopic binary. It is a detached eclipsing binary, which means the orbital plane is aligned close to the line- of-sight from the Earth, causing the components to eclipse twice per orbit. The system is undergoing apsidal motion, with a rate greater than that predicted by general relativity. Both components are ordinary F-type main- sequence stars with similar physical properties. The star normally has an apparent magnitude of 5.89, but every 7.64 days (7 days, 15 hours, and 22 minutes) its brightness decreases to magnitude 6.37, approximately two thirds as bright. Five days and 17 hours after each primary eclipse, there is a secondary eclipse when the brightness drops to magnitude 6.06, about 85% of the normal brightness. Each eclipse lasts for 220 minutes.

Largely in the Eastern United States and New York, in the span of ten years, over of plank road were built in New Yorkenough road to go from Manhattan to Californiaand more than of plank road were built countrywide. Background Plank roads were brought to the United States by Syracuse engineer George Geddes who brought them to New York from Canada. In turn, the concept is thought to have been brought to North America from Russia by the then Governor General Lord Sydenham. The first plank road in North America led out from Toronto, and was frequently cited by Geddes in his promotion of plank roads. The Toronto project was proposed by Darcy Boulton, and built under Sir Francis Bond. By 1861, the governments of Upper and Lower Canada had built between 127–162 miles of plank roads, and private companies 194–214 miles. Geddes enthusiastically reported that wooden roads lasted eight years, and cost much less than compacted crushed stone macadam roads. Geddes goes on to mention that, over the eight-year span the Toronto plank road lasted, the cost of maintaining one mile of the macadam road would be sufficient to re-plank the wooden road three times. Proponents of plank roads stated that plank roads would make it much easier to carry goods and travel in general. They were stated to be 1/3 as expensive as gravel roads. Plank roads were said to give a return on investment of 20% They also claimed that the roads will last for at least eight years, and if they don't, that will be because of more people travelling on the road, which would thus result in more tolls collected. Much of the plank road building occurred in places where lumber was comparatively affordable due to thriving timber industries, as wood was usually over sixty percent of a plank road's cost. Boom = America = National newspapers helped spread the plank road craze. In 1847, Hunts Merchants Magazine published an article titled “Plank Roads-New Improvement.\\" In 1849, Niles' Weekly Register said plank roads were \\"growing into universal favor.\\" In the 1850s, the New York Tribune praised their ease of construction. In March 1850, Scientific American said they viewed plank roads as a means of “completely reforming the interior or rural transit trade of our country.” In 1852, Hunts Merchants Magazine published an article titled \\"The First Plank Road Movement,\\" extolling plank roads. They also published an editorial saying \\"every section of the country should be lined with these roads.” Other written items included Observations on Plank Roads (1850) by George Geddes, History, Structure and Statistics of Plank Roads in the United States and Canada (1851) by William Kingsford, and A Manual of the Principles and Practice of Road-Making (1871) by William M. Gillespie. = Mid-Atlantic = Throughout the Mid-Atlantic region, some 700 companies, and about 7,000 miles of plank road were chartered by 1857. New York The first plank road in the United States was the Syracuse-Central Square road. A 16.5 mile road built for $23,000 out of eight foot wide, four inch thick hemlock planks, the Syracuse-Central road was a massive success. In its first two years 161,000 teams passing over it generated $12,900 in revenue. An 1847 report claimed that the road could generate 100 to 200 percent profit. Along the road, there were four toll booths. A vehicle that was drawn by two horses paid 1 and one-half cents per mile. One horse and rider paid half a cent. Pedestrians traveled on the road free. After the success of the first plank road, applications to form new plank road companies poured in. By 1847, a general incorporation law was passed by the state legislature. The law made it significantly easier to form a company. The law stated that at least five people could come together and form a company with the intent to build a plank road, as long as they circulated a message in at least one newspaper in the county where the plank road would be built saying where people could buy stock. The company than had to raise at least 500 dollars per mile that the road would be built. Next, the proposed company had to draw up articles of association, elect directors according to the articles, name the company, state how long the company will continue (at most 30 years), list the company's capital, and provide in-depth information about where the road will go. The company could than petition the New York Department of State's office, and presumably get approval to form a company. In 1848, 52 companies were organized, 80 in 1849, and in the 1850s, about 200. This was significantly easier than the process before, which involved petitioning the New York State Legislature. In New York state, under the general incorporation law, from 1847 to 1854 more than 340 plank road building companies were incorporated, building about 3,500 miles of plank roads. The New York Senate reported in 1870 that plank roads are more profitable than gravel or stone roadsEric Sloane, page 68, 1955, Our Vanishing Landscape, New York  New Jersey  Three plank roads, the Hackensack, the Paterson, and the Newark, were major arteries in northern New Jersey.

One such road was created to go from Freehold to Keyport. It followed roughly the path that is currently used by Route 79.

Newspapers such as the Chicago Democrat, and the Gem of the Prairie supported plank roads. In 1845, proponents of a Chicago-Rockford road, such as J. Young Scammon and Walter Newberry did receive a charter, but none of the proposed roads were ever built. Later on, in 1847, however; newspapers such as the Prairie Farmer carried articles praising plank roads, and one of the first plank roads in the Midwest (apart from Michigan) went from Milwaukee to Watertown. In Indiana, and throughout much of the Midwest, social reformer Robert Dale Owen was a prominent supporter of plank roads. In 1849, the New Harmony and Mount Vernon plank road company nominated Owen (who was already the director of the company) to go to New York, and find out how roads were constructed. After returning, he wrote a number of newspaper articles and a hugely popular pamphlet titled \\"A Brief Practical Treatise on the Construction and Management of Plank Roads\\" in 1850. So huge was the demand for plank roads, by 1850, Michigan, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Illinois-set up standardized procedures for the incorporation of plank road companies. Indiana passed its plank road legislation in September 1849  Ohio  The enthusiasm for plank roads was exceptionally strong in Northern Ohio. Nine companies were chartered during 1845, eight 1848, thirty-seven in 1849, and eighty-nine in 1850. A general incorporation law was passed in 1851, allowing for any five people to form a plank road company as long as the \\"width of the road will be 60 feet, with 16 feet covered with stone, gravel or wood, and with no ascent over five degrees.\\"  Michigan  While the first plank road was built in New York, the first company chartered with the intent to build a plank road was created in Michigan in 1837. That company was the Detroit, Plymouth and Ann Arbor Turnpike Company, chartered by Michigan state legislature on March 22, 1837 to build a \\"timber road made of good, well-hewn timber\\" from Detroit, in Wayne county to the village of Ann Arbor in the county of Washtenaw. Later on, in 1844, the state authorized the building of plank roads from Detroit to Port Huron and from near Sylvania, Ohio to Blissfield, Michigan. Then in 1846, Charters were given to the Corunna and Northampton and the Marshall and Union City Plank Road companies. Eventually, the interest in building plank roads became so high that in 1848, a general incorporation law was passed. The law stated that any company could operate a plank road so long as their road The law was subsequently amended in 1851 (shortening charters to sixty years, and making the greatest allowable grade one foot every twenty feet, as well as requiring the companies to make a report to the auditor general before the first Tuesday in January), 1855 (allowing the substitution of gravel covering nine feet wide, and ten inches thick for plank), 1859 (restoring the acceptable grade to one foot in ten) and 1867 (changing the gravel specification to nine feet wide, and seven inches thick. Tolls on the roads ranged from two cents per mile, (for two horse wagons, and every \\"neat score of cattle\\", with an additional 3/4 cents for every animal if there are more than two animals), to a maximum of one cent per mile (for one horse vehicles and every sled or sleigh) and went to as low as one-half cent per mile for every score of sheep or pigs. By 1869, plank road companies in the Bay, Clinton, Gratiot and Saginaw counties were allowed to double their tolls. During the 1800s, 202 plank road companies were established in Michigan, and 5,802 and 1/2 miles of plank roads were chartered, with roads as long as 220 miles (from Zilwaukee to Mackinaw City, and going through Traverse City) to as short as one mile (in Sault Ste. Marie). The man who signed the law was one of the major supporters of plank roads in Michigan, governor Epaphroditus Ransom. Ransom signed the general plank road incorporation act, and throughout his governorship viewed plank roads as the solution to increasing Michigan's economy. Plank roads were very popular in rural areas, because, even when it was wet and muddy, people could still travel on plank roads. Properly maintained plank roads were known to cut four to six day trips to as short as ten to fifteen hours. In 1854, the Farmer's Companion and Horticultural Gazette reported that \\" A farm adjacent to a plank road increases in value from 10-15 percent...and commands a sale from the fact that the produce never lacks a market, and has a more regular and higher net value.\\" The most plank roads (eight) went out of Detroit to various cities, with Grand Rapids (seven) following close behind. However, the craze did not last long. Of the 5,082 and 1/2 miles chartered, only 1,179 miles were built by 89 of the original 202 companies. When Mark Twain rode from Kalamazoo on the Grand Rapids plank road, asked how he liked his trip, he replied \\"It would have been good if some unconscionable scoundrel had not now and then dropped a plank across it.\\" =Southeast=  North Carolina  For a brief time, plank roads were very popular in North Carolina. The Greenville and Raleigh Plank Road and the Fayetteville and Western Plank Road were constructed. In 1852 there were thirty-nine bills for plank road charters, and in the 1854-55 legislative session, thirty-two charters were granted. The tolls allowable in North Carolina were .5 cents per mile for a horse and one rider, 2 cents per mile for a teamster with two horses, 3 cents for a teamster with three horses, and one with six horses, 4 cents. In the 1850s, about 500 miles of plank roads were built. =Brazil= Spurred on by the original success of plank roads in the United States, the Viscount of Barbacena and the Baron of Nova Friburgo, in the Rio de Janeiro province, began building a plank road. The road extended at least 14 miles, but eventually rotted.

It was founded by American- born musician and entrepreneur Roland Lamb in 2009. Its instruments have been used by musicians including Grimes, A. R. Rahman, and Hans Zimmer.  History  Pianist Roland Lamb founded ROLI in 2009 while a graduate student at London's Royal College of Art. His first prototype of the Seaboard was a response to the design limitations of the piano keyboard as a mechanical interface. As a jazz pianist, he wanted to create on a piano keyboard the effects of pitch and timbre that are often associated with string and brass instruments. His concept of the pliable, continuous \\"keywave surface\\" was the technological foundation of the Seaboard and the firm's related instruments. ROLI's Series A fundraising in 2014 raised $12.8 million, followed by a $27 million Series B fundraising in 2016. In April 2017 ROLI raised debt funding from Kreos Capital. The company is based in Dalston, London, with offices also in New York and Los Angeles. It sells its products in over 40 countries worldwide. It has acquired the following companies: JUCE, FXpansion, and Blend. The firm has named Pharrell Williams as Chief Creative Officer.

The lineup currently consists of two playing surfaces and three control blocks. The first playing surface, the Lightpad Block, was a square device that combined a Seaboard-like surface with a grid of LEDs, allowing the user to switch between various pad layouts. A revised version, the Lightpad M, was released in 2017 with improvements having been made to the device's pressure sensitivity. Alongside the Lightpad M, Roli also offers a Seaboard Block, which is a miniaturized 24 key version of the Rise.

It presents as urinary incontinence. Its impact on women is to reduce the \\"quality of life dramatically.\\"  Cause  A urerovaginal fistula is a result of trauma, infection, pelvic surgery, radiation treatment and therapy, malignancy, or inflammatory bowel disease. Symptoms can be troubling for women especially since some clinicians delay treatment until inflammation is reduced and stronger tissue has formed. The fistula may develop as a maternal birth injury from a long and protracted labor, long dilation time and expulsion period. Difficult deliveries can create pressure necrosis in the tissue that is being pushed between the head of the infant and the softer tissues of the vagina, ureters, and bladder. Radiographic imaging can assist clinicians in identifying the abnormality. A Ureterovaginal fistula is always indicative of an obstructed kidney necessitating emergency intervention followed later by an elective surgical repair of the fistula.  Treatment  Many women delay treatment for decades. Surgeons often will correct the fistula through major gynecological surgery. Newer treatments can include the placement of a stent and is usually successful. In 0.5-2.5% of major pelvic surgeries a ureterovaginal fistula will form, usually weeks later. If the fistula cannot be repaired, the clinician may create a permanent diversion of urine or urostomy. Risks associated with the repair of the fistula are also associated with most other surgical procedures and include the risk of adhesions, disorders of wound healing, infection, ileus, and immobilization. There is a recurrence rate of 5%–15% in the surgical operation done to correct the fistula.  Epidemiology  Birth injuries that result in the formation of fistulas and urinary and fecal incontinence have been found to be strongly associated with economic and cultural factors. Teenagers and women who sustain injuries that develop into ureterovaginal fistulas during childbirth suffer significant social stigma. Ureterovaginal fistulas related to prolonged, obstructed labor are rare in developed nations but are more common in countries where access to emergent obstetrical care is limited.

Subsequent novels were released on a yearly basis. La vie compliquée de Léa Olivier follows the central character of Léa Olivier, a young girl that is forced to move with her family to Greater Montreal, and is narrated through email, chat and SMS exchanges. Girard-Audet initially planned to have the series span nine volumes, but has since stated that while Léa Olivier will have a definite ending, she has no set number of books planned for the series. A spin-off series based on Lea's rival Maude Ménard-Bérubé, Mini-Maude, began publication in 2018. In the 2016 Gaspard Report on the Quebec book market the Lea Oliver series, along with the release of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child and popularity of the Pokemon franchise, was credited as being responsible for an increase in sales of children's books in 2015. For the series, Girard-Audet drew upon her own childhood experiences, such as moving to Montreal from her hometown.  Synopsis  Lea Oliver has been forced to leave her hometown in order to move with her family to Greater Montreal, which means leaving her friends, boyfriend, and school. She tries to adapt to her new life, only to be faced with new issues such as bullying, the difficulties of a long-distance relationship, and problems stemming from having a popular older brother.

The Occupied Palestine Resolution is the common name for Document 200 EX/25, passed on October 13, 2016, and formally ratified on October 26, 2016, as a decision of the Executive Board of UNESCO. The resolution is a formal condemnation of Israel, referred to throughout as \\"the occupying Power\\", for allowing alleged aggression against the Palestinian people, as well as past failures to protect exclusive Muslim use of the Abrahamic holy site the Temple Mount and infrastructure work in East Jerusalem. The resolution was intended to be put to vote in Turkey in June 2016, but the 2016 Atatürk Airport attack forced UNESCO to postpone the vote until their planned reconvening in Paris during October. The extended period of time allowed the release of the news that such a resolution was to be put into vote, and Israel expressed its outrage. The resolution was put forth by the countries of Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, and Sudan, and passed 24:6, with 28 abstentions. Ultimately the final count was 23:7, still guaranteeing ratification. The resolution garnered brief international controversy following its ratification, drawing from accusations of anti-Semitism. Controversy Prior to the ratification of the resolution, the main object of controversy was the terminology used in the text to refer to the Temple Mount. Though a sentence was later added to acknowledge the \\"importance of the Old City of Jerusalem and its walls for the three monotheistic religions\\", it referred to the sacred hilltop compound in Jerusalem's Old City only by its Muslim name, \\"Al-Haram al-Sharif\\", without also acknowledging the Jewish name, Har HaBayit, or using more neutral or inclusive terminology. Though the Tomb of the Patriarchs and Rachel's Tomb are both listed with their Islamic and English names later in the document, none of the sites are mentioned by their older Hebrew names, including the Western Wall (Kotel HaMaaravi), which is only referred to as Al-Buraq Plaza / Western Wall Plaza. This led some to accuse UNESCO of denying both Jewish and Christian ties to the Temple Mount. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the document a testament to UNESCO's growing intolerance towards Israel and the Jewish people, likening the resolution to denying Egypt's connection the Pyramids of Giza or China's connection to the Great Wall of China. The resolution was also condemned as anti-Semitic and anti-Zionist propaganda by numerous parties, claiming that the clear attempt to remove non-Islamic ties to Israel and its holy sites is detrimental to the peace process between Israel, Palestine, and the Arab World as a whole. Mexico's envoy to UNESCO, Andrés Roemer, was fired from his position after he refused to give the Mexican government's support of the resolution and walked out of the hall. (The Mexican government later retracted its support of the resolution.) The resolution was also heavily criticized for its apparent demonization of Israel, an example being the condemnation of Israel for preventing further construction on the grounds of the Temple Mount in order to prevent damage, following a prerogative set by the Islamic Waqf that oversees the hilltop compound in 1996. The resolution was condemned by Ban Ki-moon and the Director-General of UNESCO Irina Bokova who said that Judaism, Islam and Christianity have clear historical connections to Jerusalem and \\"to deny, conceal or erase any of the Jewish, Christian or Muslim traditions undermines the integrity of the site. Al-Aqsa Mosque is also Temple Mount, whose Western Wall is the holiest place in Judaism.\\" It was also rejected by the Czech Parliament which said the resolution reflects a \\"hateful anti-Israel sentiment\\", and hundreds of Italian Jews demonstrated in Rome over Italy's abstention. On October 26, UNESCO approved a reviewed version of the resolution, which also criticized Israel for its continuous \\"refusal to let the body's experts access Jerusalem's holy sites to determine their conservation status.\\" Despite containing some softening of language following Israeli protests over a previous version, Israel continued to denounce the text. Following the passing of the resolution, Israel officially cut all ties with UNESCO. Following the document's ratification, UNESCO was met with international condemnation. Palestinian leaders welcomed the decision. At present, it appears tensions are still tight between UNESCO and Israel. In early December, Netanyahu released a stream of tweets sardonically tagging UNESCO with archaeological findings in Israel, indicating there is still conflict between the two parties. The ratification of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, the first UNSC resolution to pass regarding Israel and the Palestine territories since 2009, and the first to address the issue of Israeli settlements with such specificity since Resolution 465 in 1980,Ravid, Barak. \\"Analysis Understanding the UN Resolution on Israeli Settlements: What Are the Immediate Ramifications?\\", Haaretz (December 24, 2016): \\"But it is the first to deal so specifically with the settlements in over 35 years. The previous such resolution, Resolution 465, was adopted by the Security Council in March 1980 (you can read it in full here). That being said, since 1980, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has undergone dramatic changes, the extent of the Israeli settlement enterprise has grown dramatically, and international community's focus on the settlements as a threat to the viability of the two-state solution has also increased markedly.\\" in late December served to seriously intensify conflict between Israel and the UN as a whole. While the resolution did not include any sanction or coercive measure and was adopted under non-binding Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter, Israeli newspaper Haaretz stated it \\"may have serious ramifications for Israel in general and specifically for the settlement enterprise\\" in the medium-to-long term. Netanyahu declared that nations acting against Israel's interests will pay a diplomatic and economic price, and instructed the Foreign Ministry to cancel all aid programs to Senegal, some involving programs to alleviate poverty, in response to the resolution's passage.Itamar Eichner and Tova Tzimuki, Israel retaliates for UNSC resolution with series of countermoves Ynet 25 December 2016 In late January, newly elected Secretary-General of the United Nations António Guterres made clear reference to the fact that a temple once stood on the Temple Mount, and positively asserted its destruction during the siege of Jeruslaem in 70 AD during a speech commemorating International Holocaust Remembrance Day. Mahmoud Abbas, leader of the Palestinian National Authority and president of the State of Palestine later demanded that Guterres recant this claim and submit an apology to the Palestinian people. In response, Guterres instead directly affirmed the existence of a Holy Temple on the Temple Mount, and was condemned by the Palestine National Authority for violating, \\"all legal, diplomatic and humanitarian customs\\", and chastised Guterres for overstepping his role as secretary-general. Israel has not commented on the situation thus-far.

A. brachyelytrus has characters that are shared with cockroaches and mantids and is thought to represent either the sister taxon, or an ancestor to mantids. Alienopterus has shortened forewings and functional hindwings capable of flight that are attached to pads as in the Mantophasmatodea. The foreleg has a femoral brush which is a characteristic of Mantodea. The mouth points downward from the body axis and has biting mouthparts suggestive of a predator. The antenna is long and there are large compound eyes as well as three ocelli on the head (which is never found in the Blattodea).

Name \\"Al-auja\\" means \\"the meandering one\\". This should not to be confused with the Yarkon River in which flows to the Mediterranean Sea in Tel Aviv, known in Arabic by the name \\"Nahr al-Auja\\". During World War I this coincidence led to the term of \\"the line of the two Aujas\\" referring to a strategic line connecting the two river valleys. The Hebrew name is based on the Israeli settlement Yitav, founded in 1970 on the northern river bank, next to the Palestinian village of Al-Auja. \\"Yitav\\" is an acronym for Yad Yitzhak Tabenkin. Geography Wadi Auja is 35 kilometers long and sets the boundary between the Judean Desert and the eastern hillslopes of Samaria. It has a drainage area of 200 square kilometers and descends from a height of approximately 1000 meters above sea level to -315 meters below sea level, where it flows into the Jordan River. The stream starts at Ein Samia, on the eastern slopes of Mount Hazor and flows eastward. Before its arrival to the Jordan Rift Valley, it forms a deep and steep gorge, some 3 kilometers long. In this area some waterfalls are formed. Ein Samia has been diverted to provide water to Ramallah, some 20km away, providing around 30% of the city's needs, and leaving most of the Wadi dry throughout the year. The Auja Spring produces an estimated 9 million cubic metres of water annually, which creates a small oasis that attracts thousands of tourists a year, as well as providing for the farmers of Auja village. The gorge section of the river is a natural reserve, where rows of clifts are exposed and inside them a variety of rare birds of prey and perennial plants can be found. History The area was occupied by Israel in 1967. Today, Wadi Auja is a route used by Palestinian hikers. It is quieter and more isolated than the popular routes hiking routes such as Wadi Qelt.

Factors contributing to this tension included the rise in conversions to Christianity, the emergence of Brahmoism, and the ideologies of social reform adopted by the reformers of the mid-nineteenth century.

Early life Born Gertrude B. Kelly was born Brigid Kelly on February 10, 1862 in Carrick-on-Suir, Ireland to teachers Jeremiah Kelly and Kate Forrest Kelly. To her friends, she was known as Bride. She emigrated with her family to the United States in 1868, settling in Hoboken, New Jersey. Her father went back into teaching in the public school system, becoming a principal of a New Jersey school in 1872. In New Jersey, both of her parents were active in the Land League. Her father was the president of the Jersey City branch of the Land League. Her older brother was electrical engineer John Forrest Kelly. After graduating from high school, Kelly studied medicine in the Women's Medical College of the New York Infirmary for Women and Children, graduating in 1884 and went on to practice as a doctor. Despite being in America, Kelly remained interested in the situation in Ireland and her work in the tenements gave her insight into the lives of the poor. Activism An individualist anarchist in the 1880s, Kelly published frequent articles in the periodicals Liberty and the Irish World. She was the foremost woman contributor to Liberty and hugely praised by the editor Benjamin Tucker. She was a member of the Ladies' Land League in America. She believed in the No Rent Manifesto published by the Irish National Land League in 1881. She was also a supporter of freedom for other nations – she was a member of the Friends of Freedom for India and Friends of New Russia. Her main local causes were in support of women and poor families. She founded a medical clinic in Chelsea as well as being on the surgical staff at the New York Infirmary for Women and Children for over 30 years. She was also secretary of the Newark Liberal League. She wrote numerous papers on surgical and medical procedures, and on social health issues. One of her main objections was with capitalism, which she believed caused the poverty she saw. She spoke against the practices of teaching women embroidery and art rather than making them self-sufficient. She saw herself as an anarchist in the beginning but began to identify as a socialist in later years. In her writings she made statements which were rare for a feminist of the day. She made the point, \\"There is, properly speaking, no woman question, apart from the question of human rights and human liberty\\". Kelly was an atheist who referred to herself as an unredeemed pagan. She never married but lived with her companion Mary Walsh. The Irish Nationalism Kelly claimed to have been a member of almost every Irish association in New York. She was the only female patron of the Gaelic Society in New York and served as the chairwoman of the 1913 Irish Historic Pageant. When a supporter of Irish Home Rule and the United Irish League of America, she organized the United Irishwomen when it looked as though Ulster might be excluded from the Third Irish Home Rule Bill in 1914. In December of that year, Kelly and Irish journalist Sydney Gifford formed the first American auxiliary to the Cumann na mBan, more commonly known as the Irish Women's Council. She was president of the association and arranged new chapters around the country as well as arranging speakers and fundraising. She did not support Irish Volunteer leader John Redmond's move to support the British armed forces in the First World War. Kelly was also pacifist who believed in non-violent protests. She was arrested during an anti-war demonstration during the war. In 1917 she co-founded the Irish Progressive League (IPL). During the war, organisations which criticized British policy were put on the government watch list. As a result of the members of the earlier organisations being listed, the IPL believed they were better positioned to lobby for the Irish Republic in Washington. Kelly was one of the organizers of the American Women Pickets for the Enforcement of America's War Aims which protested at the British Embassy in Washington in 1920. They also organized a strike at Chelsea Piers, which lasted three and a half weeks, in protest of the British Prime Minister's actions in relation to Irish Archbishop Daniel Mannix and the arrest of the Cork Mayor Terence MacSwiney. The strike spread to Brooklyn, New Jersey, and Boston and included Irish, Italian, and African-American workers. The strike at Chelsea Piers was termed \\"the first purely political strike of workingmen in the history of the United States\\" by The New York Sun. In January 1921, Kelly and Kathleen O'Brennan formed an American branch of the Irish White Cross. Legacy Kelly died on 24 February 1934. Two years later, on 16 May 1936, New York Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia dedicated a playground to her in the Chelsea district, the Dr. Gertrude B. Kelly Playground.

He is best known for his work regarding lymphocyte development, particularly the differentiation of immature CD4+8+ (double positive) thymocytes into mature T cells. Singer's work is foundational in the understanding of T cells and MHC-restricted antigen recognition. Singer's work explores the mechanisms with which a body identifies what is self and what is not self. At a time when many researchers understood that T cells recognize self through identification of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) it was not understood how T cells acquire that capability. Using a unique approach to thymus transplantation, Singer showed that it is the thymus that educates self-recognition specificity in T cells. A series of later studies in Singer's lab demonstrated that the property of self-recognition in T cells is acquired during development in the thymus rather than predetermined prior to development or genetically encoded in the genome.  Biography  Singer was raised in Port Jervis, New York, the eldest son of a baker. He studied philosophy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he received his BS in 1968 and met his wife, Dinah Singer. He received his MD from the Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons and was a fellow in immunology at the Rockefeller University before joining the NCI as a clinical associate in the Immunology Branch in 1975. In 1982, Singer established the Experimental Immunology Branch, of which he remained the branch chief.

The event began on December 1, 2015, with The Flash episode \\"Legends of Today\\" and concluded the following day with the Arrow episode \\"Legends of Yesterday\\". The episodes feature characters from DC's Legends of Tomorrow, which was being developed as a spin-off. The crossover sees Barry Allen / Flash and Oliver Queen / Arrow team up to take on Vandal Savage, who is looking for Kendra Saunders and Carter Hall, the reincarnations of Hawkgirl and Hawkman. A crossover between the two series was announced in January 2015 by The CW President Mark Pedowitz, who stated the network's intention to have an Arrowverse crossover every season following the success of the previous year's crossover \\"Flash vs. Arrow\\". By September, the scripts for each episode had been written, with filming occurring shortly before the end of the month and into October 2015. The crossover sees every main cast member of each series who appear at least in their own series, with additional actors and characters also reprising their Arrowverse roles. The episodes received generally positive reviews; however, the Legends setup received mixed responses. Both series experienced season high viewership despite the ratings being down from the previous year's crossover. A subsequent crossover occurred the following year, titled \\"Invasion!\\". Plot Vandal Savage arrives in Central City looking to kill Kendra Saunders. After he attacks Kendra and Cisco Ramon, Barry Allen takes Kendra to Star City and enlists the help of Oliver Queen and his team to protect her. The team is visited by Malcolm Merlyn who informs them that Savage is an immortal. Later, Kendra is kidnapped by Hawkman, but Barry and Oliver rescue her and capture him. He introduces himself as Carter Hall, and tells them he and Kendra are soulmates who have been connected for millennia. They are destined to die, be reborn, and find each other in each lifetime. Carter also reveals that Savage has killed the pair several times, each time growing stronger. Savage acquires the Staff of Horus, a deadly weapon. Kendra unlocks her abilities and becomes Hawkgirl and the team decides to regroup in Central City. Oliver witnesses his ex-girlfriend Samantha Clayton with her son William, and realizes the child is likely his. Meanwhile, Caitlin Snow and Harrison Wells create a serum that will temporarily increase Barry's speed so that he can defeat Zoom. Jay Garrick initially refuses to test the serum, but changes his mind to save Wells when he is shot by Patty Spivot, who mistakes him for Eobard Thawne. Jay advises against using the serum on Barry. Malcolm orchestrates a meeting between Savage, Barry, and Oliver. Savage demands they turn over Kendra and Carter or he will destroy both Central City and Star City with the Staff of Horus. Oliver has Barry perform a paternity test on William and it confirms that Oliver is William's father. Confronting Samantha, she agrees to let him see William on the condition he tell no one, including William himself, that he is the boy's father. Felicity learns of Oliver's paternity and feels betrayed because Oliver is still willing to keep secrets from her, so she ends their relationship. Barry and Oliver devise a plan to deliver Kendra and Carter as a ruse to get close enough to Savage to destroy the staff. The plan goes horribly wrong; Kendra's powers fail and Savage quickly overcomes the element of surprise and kills both her and Carter before using the staff to destroy Central City. Barry escapes and runs fast enough to go back in time to the point of the original negotiation before everyone else dies. Barry informs Oliver of his time travel and the mistakes that led to defeat. They change their approach to the plan and Barry is able to steal the staff. He and Oliver use it on Savage, turning him into ashes. Kendra and Carter decide to use their powers to help others in another city. Cisco gives Kendra a tracking device. Oliver agrees to Samantha's conditions for him to see William. Even though Barry encourages Oliver to tell Felicity about William (she never learned about him due to Barry's time traveling) he decides to continue to keep the secret from her.

There's going to be a lot happening leading up to the crossover, which is serving as a [sort-of] pilot for Legends.\\" Kreisberg described the crossover between both shows as \\"a superhero a-go-go!\\", saying: \\"It's insane to have them all together.\\" Unlike the 2014 crossover, which was two separate self-contained adventures that involved each show, Marc Guggenheim, executive producer on Arrow, said: \\"This [year's] is a crazy, full-on 'To Be Continued' crossover,... it really feels like a 2-hour movie [airing] over two nights.\\" Kreisberg and Guggenheim also reassured fans that both episodes would not focus solely on setting up the spin-off series, and that the crossover is still Oliver Queen and Barry Allen having their own adventure. \\"These [episodes] have important stuff going on for the narratives of both The Flash and Arrow,\\" said Kriesberg, while Guggenheim added: \\"The final moments of The Flash have a pretty big jaw- dropper and we pick up those threads in Arrow. Then we do some things with the characters from Arrow... that are pretty epic and major.\\" In The Flash episode, Caitlin and Harry create a drug called Velocity 6 to make Barry faster against Zoom. Kreisberg commented that \\"It's safe to say that there'll be a few more iterations of that formula\\", but viewers will have to wait and see how everything plays out and the effects on those who use it. Teddy Sears (whose character Jay Garrick uses the drug, which temporarily restores his speed) said while his character is not fixated on restoring his speed, Velocity 6 presents an interesting fix that will tempt him due to his \\"haunting memories\\" of his previous life with powers. =Writing= In July 2015, Greg Berlanti, creator and executive producer on both series, said: > We've just been breaking into it over the last week or so actually ... so > we're, really, excited about it. We've got a great story lined up for > towards the end of the fall, early winter. This year our real hope is to > make a crossover that's even bigger, and even more rewarding for the > audience than the last years. The scripts for the \\"Heroes Join Forces\\" crossover were written in September 2015. Berlanti created the story for the event, and Kreisberg and Guggenheim helped to craft the story of The Flash and Arrow episodes, respectively. The teleplay for The Flash was written by showrunners Aaron and Todd Helbing; Arrows was written by Brian Ford Sullivan and Guggenheim. =Filming= Filming of the two episodes occurred from September 25, 2015, until October 15, 2015. The Flashs episode was directed by Ralph Hemecker, and Arrows by Thor Freudenthal. Berlanti discussed the logistic nightmare of bringing the three series together since the first couple of episodes of Legends of Tomorrow had already been shot before the filming of the crossover episodes. In addition, there were characters from The Flash and Arrow \\"that we were also shooting out of those respective shows before we went into shooting Legends to then have to come back and do the introduction of some of the characters here.\\" Falk Hentschel described the filming as \\"an acting marathon\\" constantly moving from one set to another during the day, but had a blast. Release =Broadcast= The crossover episodes were scheduled to be shown at an exclusive fan screening hosted by AT&T; on November 22, 2015, but it was cancelled to allow more time for the visual effects to be completed. The first part on The Flash aired on December 1, followed by part two on Arrow on December 2, both on The CW. The crossover was simulcast with the US broadcast in Canada on CTV. =Home media= The episodes were released together on Blu- ray and DVD, along with the rest of The Flashs second season on September 6, 2016, and Arrows fourth season on August 30, 2016. Bonus features include behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel. Reception =Ratings= The Flash episode attracted season two's largest viewership – the show's largest since February 17, 2015. The episode attracted 12% more viewers and matched the 18–49 rating of the previous episode, \\"Gorilla Warfare\\". It was down 12% in the 18–49 rating from the previous year's crossover. The Arrow episode attracted season four's largest viewership and 18–49 rating, the best since the previous year's crossover with The Flash on December 3, 2014. Viewership improved by 36% and viewers in the 18-49 demographic increased by 27% over the previous episode, \\"Brotherhood\\". The Canadian broadcast of The Flash was watched by 2.00 million viewers, earning it the highest viewership for that night, and the third highest for the week. The Arrow broadcast had 1.81 million viewers, the fourth highest for that day, and the seventh highest for the week. =Critical response= Alasdair Wilkins writing for The A.V. Club described the crossover as \\"one big 90-minute movie,\\" and found it is only when the viewer is well into the broadcast that it becomes clear that there are two storylines from separate shows. Wilkins found \\"Legends Of Today\\" and \\"Legends Of Yesterday\\" charming feeling they \\"operate on a more epic scale\\" than either show's typical episode. Oliver's paternity storyline felt creaky to Wilkins, and he noted the episodes again strained \\"to set up the latest spin-off\\". Despite these faults, he found \\"the overall effect of this crossover two-parter ... pretty damn impressive,\\" and the \\"team-up story ... grand enough to be more than the sum of its parts\\". Screen Rants Alice Walker also noted the annual Arrow/The Flash crossover suffered from trying to set up Legends. She felt it \\"too much to ask\\" from the busy storylines, criticizing the producers for \\"planting more seeds than they could reap\\". She felt the crossovers had ceased to be \\"a fun way to contrast the two shows,\\" now that they had to set up a new world. The Flash The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an 83% approval rating, based on 12 reviews for the episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Although the plots aren't particularly inspired, the talented, enchanting casts of The Flash and Arrow make this crossover episode an undeniable joy to watch.\\" Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave The Flash episode a score 7.5 out of 10. He was critical of the episode's \\"wonky pacing and story progression\\" and given its \\"legitimate two-part storyline\\" was disappointed it was not more cohesive than the previous year's crossover. He felt the crossover \\"had a fairly rocky start\\" and wondered whether Arrows characters were actually necessary to the storyline. Even so, Scheden said, \\"there was a lot of fun to be had in seeing both teams cross paths and grapple with an increasingly strange world of heroes and villains\\" and was looking forward to a focused conclusion. The A.V. Clubs Scott Von Doviak awarded the episode an \\"A\\", saying: \\"\\"Legends Of Today” is a sterling example of how to do this crossover thing right.\\" He noted that the episode wove ongoing storylines \\"into an expansive DC Universe adventure\\" calling it \\"the most purely enjoyable outing of the season so far\\". Dave Trumbore of Collider gave The Flash episode 3 stars out of 5, saying: \\"Not only did \\"Legends of Today\\" – i.e. Hawkman and Hawkgirl – do a good job introducing most of the main players of Legends of Tomorrow, it also provided a solid setup for the new Arrow episode, \\"Legends of Yesterday\\".\\" He described the show as \\"big, adventurous fun\\" but had the same problem as he had with the previous year's crossover in that when it gave screen time to The Flash \\"it lost sight of its own identity\\". Entertainment Weeklys Jonathon Dornbush gave The Flash episode a positive review, stating, \\"While The Flash is burdened with part 1,\\" setting up the showdown in part 2, \\"Legends of Today\\" has \\"its own big moments and plenty of laughs\\". Giving the episode a 7.5 out of 10, Eric Walters of Paste stated, that \\"Unlike last year, \\"Legends of Today\\" did not feel like a Flash episode featuring Team Arrow.\\" He expected the 2015 crossover would be bigger than previous years' noting: \\"It is, but it's also far from complete.\\" He felt that \\"Legends of Today\\" was not so much a The Flash episode, but more like \\"the first half of something much larger\\". In the end, he wished \\"the show had embraced it fully\\". Den of Geek's Mike Cecchini gave the episode 3.5 stars out of 5, saying: \\"I'm really kind of amazed at just how much work \\"Legends of Today\\" gets done without just becoming a massive mess.\\" He described it as \\"a proper two-parter this year\\" and concluded: \\"Amidst all the Legends of Tomorrow hooplah and the fun of getting the teams together, \\"Legends of Today\\" still manages to move the main Flash season 2 storyline forward in a couple of neat ways.\\" Arrow Rotten Tomatoes reported an 88% approval rating, based on 17 reviews for the episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"This satisfying conclusion to the most ambitious crossover event yet delivers some thrilling surprises and teases out tantalizing possibilities for the wider Arrowverse.\\" Jesse Schedeen gave Arrows episode an 8.7 out of 10, noting that the Flash episode was \\"saddled with the setup\\" while \\"Arrow gets to have fun with the payoff.\\" He felt the pace and storyline issues in \\"Legends of Tomorrow,\\" the Flash episode, were resolved satisfactorily. The inclusion of flashbacks and time travel gave it \\"a larger scope and an added sense of drama\\". As well, the Ollie subplot allowed Stephen Amell \\"to show a much different and more vulnerable side to his character\\". Alisdair Wilkins awarded the episode a B+ noting \\"how much better the show's entire dynamic is this season compared with last year\\". He added that \\"Legends Of Yesterday\\" shows Oliver's conflict between keeping his friends safe and recognizing he cannot be victorious without them. Dave Trumbore felt the Arrow episode tied up the introduction of Hawkgirl and Hawkman and their nemesis Vandal Savage, and effectively set up the launch of The CW's mid-season, spin-off Legends of Tomorrow. He gave it 4 stars out of 5. He added that the crossover specials \\"do a fantastic job of pulling back the camera to reveal the wider world that their heroes and villains share\\". Jonathon Dornbush was impressed with Carlos Valdes' performance, saying: \\"While Oliver naturally takes center stage — and Stephen Amell steps up to the task, arguably giving his best performance on the show yet — the secret MVP of the hour is Carlos Valdes' Cisco, who also happens to steal The Flashs half of the crossover.\\" Mark Rozeman of Paste gave the Arrow episode an 8.8 out of 10, saying, the episode: \\"has the freedom to play around with its toys a bit more\\" compared to the \\"unavoidable amount of world building and backstory [that] ended up massively bogging down the crossover's first installment.\\" He felt the crossover was fun and a \\"rollicking good time\\". Kain praised the shows' creative team for \\"making the special feel like a legitimate event, as opposed to just a half-assed stab at ratings gold\\". Mike Cecchini was pleased that the episode was not \\"another hour of fan service with little substance,\\" and felt \\"Legends of Yesterday\\" was a \\"really good\\" Arrow/Oliver Queen episode. He praised Amell's performance and highlighted that: \\"The two teams really gelled nicely, and just as Barry and Ollie felt like real friends during the episode's dramatic moments, Flash and Green Arrow felt like natural teammates during the superheroic moments.\\" He gave the episode 3.5 stars out of 5. =Accolades= Collider.com named the second annual The Flash and Arrow crossover one of the 10 biggest superhero moments of 2015, saying \\"the two-night crossover event was a great success, reaffirming the fun of the universe they've built and stoking the desire to see it continue to grow\\". Zap2it also named both \\"Legends of Today\\" and \\"Legends of Yesterday\\" as one of the best television episodes of 2015.

History The neighborhood was established in 1935 by an African American landowner, Ross Reid, it was one of the first exclusively African American neighborhoods in Charlotte. The City of Charlotte annexed Reid Park in 1959, and the number of homes and residents grew significantly thereafter. According to residents, in its first 40 years, the neighborhood had a high quality of life. Unfortunately, by the early 1980s, the neighborhood began to decline and crime rose. It became the main attraction for Crack Cocaine dealers and gangs to set up shop, especially around the infamous Dalton village housing Projects. Several homes sustained major renovations in the mid 2000s and by 2013, majority of the homes that where once decaying where now gone or renovated.

This is often done to enhance the aesthetics or flow of the film, allowing the audience to see context—either before or after—of speaking rather than simply the speaking itself. Without split edit, a conversation between two people can feel like a tennis match. Split edits are also used to hide transitions between scenes. They can be very effective in editing dialog scenes shot with a single camera using multiple takes. The ability to cut the picture/video separately from the sound/audio allows the sound from the various takes to flow smoothly, even though the picture cuts are at different places. In longer shots, this allows the editor to use the picture from one take with the sound from another take if the dialog reading is better. Traditionally, split edits have been described as overlapping the sound, not to be confused with overlapping dialogue, where the latter involves laying one sound track over another sound track. With proliferation of computer-based non-linear editing different variants of split edit received their own names based on how the video being edited is presented on the timeline. A variant of split edit when the audio from preceding scene overlaps the video from the following scene is known as L cut. If the audio from the following scene overlaps the video from the preceding scene, then this cut is known as J cut. In 2011 Barry Salt investigated 33 American films made between 1936 and 2014 and noted that \\"the use of J-edits does seem to have increased in recent times, to a proportion roughly equal to that of L-edits\\" although because of the small sample of films studied he was careful not to conclude this to become the trend.

However, some historians are of the opinion that Xiahou Yang Suanjing was not written by Xiahou Yang. It is one of the books in The Ten Computational Canons, a collection of mathematical texts assembled by Li Chunfeng and used as the official mathematical for the imperial examinations. Though little is known about the period of the author, there is some evidence which more or less conclusively establishes the date of the work. These suggest 468 CE as the latest possible date for the work to be written and 425 CE as the earliest date. Contents The treatise is divided into three parts and these are spoken of as the higher, the middle and the lower sections. The first chapter contains 19 problems, the second chapter contains 29 problems and the last chapter contains 44 problems. As in all the older Chinese books, no technical rules are given, and the problems are simply followed by the answers, occasionally with brief explanations. =Section 1= In the first section the five operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square and cube roots are given. The work on division is subdivided into (1) \\"ordinary division\\"; (2) \\"division by ten, hundred, and so on,\\" especially intended for work in mensuration; (3) \\"division by simplification\\" (yo ch'ut). The last problem in the section is as follows: :\\"There are 1843 k'o, 8 t'ow, 3 ho of coarse rice. A contract requires that this be exchanged for refined rice at the rate of 1 k'o, 4 t'ow for 3 k'o. How much refined rice must be given?\\" The answer is 860 k'o, 534 ho. The solution is given as follows: \\"Multiply the given number by 1 k'o, 4 t'ow and divide by 3 k'o and you will obtain the result.\\" (1 k'o = 10 t'ow = 100 ho) Fractions are also mentioned, special names being given to the four most common ones, as follows: :1/2 is called chung p'an (even part) :1/3 is called shaw p'an (small part) :2/3 is called thai p'an (large part) :1/4 is called joh p'an (weak part) =Section 2= In the second section there are twenty-eight applied problems relating to taxes, commissions, and such questions as concern the division by army officers of loot and food (silk, rice, wine, soy sauce, vinegar, and the like) among their soldiers. =Section 3= The third section contains forty-two problems. The translations of some of these problems are given below. # \\"Now for 1 pound of gold one gets 1200 pieces of silk. How many can you get for 1 ounce?\\" Answer: For 1 ounce you get exactly 75 pieces. Solution: Take the given number of pieces, have it divided by 16 ounces, and you will obtain the answer. (Chinese pound was divided into 16 ounces.) # \\"Now you have 192 ounces of silk. How many choo have you?\\" Answer: Four thousand six hundred eight. (It appears that in obtaining the given solution to the problem, pound was divided into 24 choos.) # \\"Now 2000 packages of cash must be carried to the town at the rate of 10 cash per bundle. How much will be given to the mandarin and how much to the carrier?\\" Answer: 1980 packages and 198 2/101 cash to the mandarin; 19 packages and 801 98/101 to the carrier. Solution: Take the total number as the dividend, and 1 package plus 10 cash as the divisor. # \\"Out of 3485 ounces of silk how many pieces of satin can be made, 5 ounces being required for each piece?\\" Answer: 697. Solution: Multiply the number of ounces by 2 and go back by one row. Dividing by 5 will also give the answer. # \\"Now they build a wall, high 3 rods, broad 5 feet at the upper part and 15 feet at the lower part; the length 100 rods. For a 2-foot square a man works 1 day. How many days are required?\\" Answer: 75,000. Solution: Take-half the sum of the upper and lower breadths, have it multiplied by the height and length; the product will be the dividend. As the divisor you will use the square of the given 2 feet.

Incumbent Democrat Paul B. Johnson Jr. was term-limited, and could not run for reelection to a second term. Democratic primary No candidate received a majority in the Democratic primary, which featured seven contenders, so a runoff was held between the top two candidates. It was the first Democratic primary for the governorship since the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, resulting in an accrued registration for Black voters going from 29,500 to 195,000, making overt segregationist rhetoric less acceptable, as the Citizens' Councils complained by asking the contestant \\"why our ideals of states' rights and racial segregation\\" were not being \\"featured in this campaign as in the past.\\" On the other hand, the abolition of poll tax benefited many poor Whites, most of them were supporters of segregation. As a result, each one of the seven candidates aired support for segregation, although witn varying degrees. Waller, who prosecuted Byron De La Beckwith and attacked the Ku Klux Klan, additioned with attacks against civil rights \\"rabble-rousers\\", was the more moderate on the race question along with Winter, who had to embrace segregationnist rhetorics to stay in the run. Barnett attempted to do a come- back but more militant segregationists complained he did not enough during the Ole Miss riot of 1962. Staunch segregationist Williams ironically used the least rhetoric since he could claim to have sacrificed his House career for Goldwater three years ago on 1964, although his supporters handed flyers telling that \\"if William F. Winter is elected governor, the Negroes will run Mississippi.\\" The most segregationist candidate was Jimmy Swan, running on a promise to establish \\"FREE, private, SEGREGATED SCHOOLS for every white child in the State of Mississippi\\" in the first twelve months of his term, or else he would resign and publicly apologize. He called to save Mississippi \\"from the moral degeneracy of total mass integration that Washington has decreed for our children this fall\\", said that to granting equality to the Blacks was to make savagery the equal of civilization and promising to use extreme force against any Black urban riot, which he viewed as a \\"Communist monster\\", and openly courted the Klan, whose his campaign bodyguard Pat Massengale was member; such rhetoric might have contributed to have relatively less extremist voters move to vote Barnett, viewed as more moderate, and similarly winning most extreme segregationists from Barnett He always wore a white suit to demonstrate his beliefs on race. Vernon E. Brown, a 65-year-old tax assessor from Stone County, Mississippi, and C. L. McKinley, a Creole pipefitter living in Pennsylvania, had no campaign organization. The runoff election was won by U.S. Representative John Bell Williams, who defeated state treasurer William Winter. As was common at the time, the Democratic primary had higher turnout than the general election, as it was a given the Democrat would win. Black leaders avoided to publicly support a candidate, for fear he might lose voters. In some places, the MFDP called Blacks to boycott the primaries. =Results= =Runoff= General election =Campaign= Phillips, a former Democratic public service commissioner, had no running-mate. His previous nominee for lieutenant governor, Stanford Morse, endorsed Williams. Phillips later said that the GOP did not at the time realize the importance of offering full candidate slates.\\"Challenging the Status Quo,\\" p. 258 The unopposed Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor, Charles L. Sullivan of Clarksdale, had defeated in his party's primary Governor Paul Johnson, who ran in 1967 for his former post of lieutenant governor. At the time Mississippi governors could not succeed themselves but could sit out a term and enter the next race four years later.\\"Challenging the Status Quo\\", p. 259 Sullivan earlier said that he could work with either Phillips or Williams, but he endorsed the Democratic nominee, having verbally sparred with Phillips at a meeting in Biloxi of the Mississippi Manufacturing Association.Greenville Delta Democrat-Times, October 15, 26, 1967 Clarke Reed of Greenville, who succeeded Yerger as state chairman in 1966, recalled that Phillips did not wish to run for governor again in 1967 but was persuaded to do so my party leaders in need of a candidate though there was little expectation of success. For his second race, Phillips shed his past segregationist image and ran to the middle, as had Williams' unsuccessful primary opponent, state Treasurer William F. Winter, who ultimately won the governorship in 1979. Time magazine called Phillips \\"an erstwhile segregationist who this year appealed for an end to the racial rancor.\\"Time, XC (November 17, 1967), p. 29 Phillips later said that his moderate stance hurt the Republicans at that time but that the party since \\"benefited from the things we did.\\" In a television address, Phillips reaffirmed his belief in segregation but spoke in conciliatory language toward African Americans: > The influence of race ... is so dominant that it is utterly unrealistic to > expect any significant progress in such vital fields as education, economic > development, and federal-state relations until we have brought the race > issue out into the open and begun, at least begun, to deal with it > effectively. ...

He is a member of the Republican Party, not just here ... but at the national level.\\"Meridian Star, October 13, 1967 The Clarion-Ledger judged Phillips' in his second race as \\"a weak candidate with a weak pitch\\" and termed his prospects as virtually \\"hopeless.\\"Jackson Clarion-Ledger, October 18, 1967 Phillips took other heretical positions, having urged a \\"long-range master plan for education\\" and the reinstatement of compulsory attendance, which had been repealed in 1958.Meridian Star, October 17, 1963; estimates were that 84,000 pupils were not attending school in Mississippi in 1967. Phillips questioned the need of the Mississippi Milk Commission, which he said kept the price of milk artificially too high.Hattiesburg American, October 10, 1967 Presidential politics played some role in the 1967 campaign, as Williams stressed his friendship with George C. Wallace of Alabama, who was preparing for an independent candidacy in 1968. Phillips countered that only a Republican, perhaps Nixon or Governor Ronald Wilson Reagan of California, could defeat a national Democratic presidential nominee.

During the Second World War he established a chain of long-range radar stations throughout Australia and the South West Pacific. After the war, he helped in planning the Long Range Weapons Establishment, which he named \\"Woomera\\". Early life Flight training course in December 1930. Pither is seated, second from the left Alfred George Pither was born in Shepparton, Victoria, on 16 October 1908, the oldest of the six children of James Luke Pither, a farmer, and his wife Rosanna Amelia Fletcher. He was educated at Pine Lodge Primary School and Shepparton High School, from which he obtained his leaving certificate. He served in the Australian Army Cadets from 1 July 1925 to 28 October 1926, reaching the rank of corporal. He entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon, on 16 February 1927. On graduation from Duntroon on 9 December 1930, Pither was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Australian Army, but the following day became a pilot officer in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) with the service number O323. After completing No. 10 Flying Training Course, and parachute and signals training, he joined No. 1 Squadron RAAF. He was promoted to flying officer on 1 July 1932. He was admitted to Caulfield Military Hospital on 19 December 1932 with appendicitis, but the operation was botched. A swab was left in his stomach, resulting in infection. He was readmitted, and a kidney had to be removed. Temporarily rendered unfit for flying duties, Pither pursued his interest in signals. He sailed for the UK on the in March 1936, and attended the Royal Air Force (RAF) Long Signals Course at RAF Cranwell. While there, he was promoted to flight lieutenant on 1 April 1936. On returning to Australia he was given command of the RAAF Signals Training School at RAAF Laverton. He reorganised it, and arranged for it to move to a new permanent home at nearby RAAF Point Cook. He was promoted to the temporary rank of squadron leader on 1 September 1939. Second World War Mark 1A Light Weight Air Warning (LW/AW) Radar. The canvas tent enclosure and flies are in position, surrounding the A frame of the radar. On top of the AW Array is the Interrogator Array and above that the Responser Array. On 23 October 1939, shortly after the outbreak of Second World War, Pither was posted to the staff of RAAF Headquarters, where he developed the signals training regimen for the Empire Air Training Scheme, introducing a new curriculum for Wireless Mechanics and Signals training at Point Cook. In September 1940, he was sent to the UK for a training course on radar, then a new and secret development. Promoted to temporary wing commander on 1 January 1941, he returned to Australia by way of the United States and Canada, where he studied the latest developments. While he was in Canada, he married a Sydney-born woman, Lillian Ruth Ball, at Christ Church Cathedral in Vancouver on 13 April 1941. Returning to Australia in May 1941, Pither became the head of Section S7 of the RAAF Directorate of Signals, which was responsible for radar. He established a new school, No. 1 Radio School (later renamed No. 1 Radar School) to train specialists in the operation and maintenance of radar sets. The school officially opened on 4 August 1941, although 23 mechanics had already commenced the first course on 29 July. The course was based on the ASV Mk. I radar set, the only model available in Australia at the time. Later in the year, an RAF officer and three NCOs, with a Chain Home Low set made it possible to also give courses in ground-based radar. On 7 November 1941, the War Cabinet ordered that a series of early warning radar installations be established across northern Australia. Pither, whose S7 Section became the RAAF Directorate of Radar on January 1942, found himself engaged in a desperate race against time after Japan entered the war, and Japanese aircraft soon began appearing over Australia. The only unit under his control was No. 1 Radar School, but he liaised with the Allied Works Council, RAAF airfield construction squadrons and local government bodies, to prepare the required radar installations. He worked closely with the Radio Physics Laboratory (RPL) of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), which developed radar technology, with the New South Wales Government Railways Workshop, Postmaster-General's Department (PMG), Gramophone Company (HMV) and Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) (AWA) that built the radar sets, and with the University of Sydney and the Melbourne Technical College that helped train his radar officers and mechanics, respectively. The Australian Light Weight Air Warning Radar (LW/AW) radar was a success, and was used by the British and American forces as well. By the end of 1942, 136 officers, 500 mechanics and 1,000 operators had been trained, 100 aircraft had been fitted with radar sets and 57 radar stations were operational. This was not accomplished without cutting red tape and treading on toes. In October 1943. Pither was sent to the UK on exchange. There he worked on the radar arrangements for Operation Overlord. In July 1944 he joined No. 80 Wing RAF. He was placed in command of a radio-jamming unit in southern England that was specifically established to jam the electronic guidance systems of German V-2 rockets. His unit followed in the wake of the allied advance into Belgium, continuing its campaign against the V-2 rockets. He returned to Australia in December 1944, and became head of the Directorate of Radar once more, but the crisis had passed and there was little to do. Post-war In October 1945, the wake of the surrender of Japan, Pither headed a three-man team sent to Japan to study the country's scientific achievements. This was concluded in February 1946, and he left for England, where he was the RAAF delegate at the Commonwealth Defence Science Conference in May 1946. In July, he was appointed to the Air Board as Air Member for Technical Services, with special responsibility for guided missiles. Promoted to temporary group captain on 1 March 1947, he became the RAAF Liaison Officer at the new Long Range Weapons Establishment, for which he proposed the name \\"Woomera\\", a proposal that was soon approved. In May 1951, he was seconded to the Department of Supply as the Range Officer at Woomera. He was involved in the testing of guided missiles, and in the British Operation Totem nuclear tests at Emu Field in South Australia in 1953. Pither returned to duty with the RAAF on 14 July 1954, and became Director of Telecommunications and Radar on 20 September 1954. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1956 New Year Honours. On 2 June 1959, he assumed command of No. 1 Aircraft Depot RAAF. He took charge of RAAF Laverton on 21 June 1961. On 29 January 1963 he became staff officer for telecommunication engineering at Headquarters RAAF Support Command in Melbourne. His first wife died in 1964. On 18 December 1964, he married Ethel Constance Jones Wilton at the Methodist Church in Camberwell, Victoria. He retired on 16 February 1966 with the honorary rank of air commodore. In retirement, Pither served as treasurer and councillor of the state branch of the Royal Flying Doctor Service. He died suddenly on 2 July 1971 in Hawthorn, Victoria, from a coronary infarction, and his remains were cremated. He was survived by his wife and the twin son and daughter from his first marriage.

Ja'afar Halid accidentally shot at more than seven people in the scene, resulting in Ong's and two passers- by's death. The incident also left four injured.  Background  Datuk Ong Teik Kwong was a 32-years-old business man and was the chairman of Persatuan Kebajikan Amal CK One. Police have identified Ong as the deputy leader of the notorious Gang 24 in Penang. The Ong's bodyguard, Ja'afar Halid who was believed be mentally unstable, was on the first day at work when the shooting happens.  Shooting  At about 19:30 MYT (11:30 UTC), on the route to Penang, Ong and his business partner, Lim Boon Leng were seated on the front while Ja'afar Halid was seated behind. Halid shot Ong from behind and hit him in the head after having an argument with Ong. The car Ong was driving crashed into several vehicles in front of his. Lim panicked as the bodyguard targeted him and ran out of the car while Halid chasing him, attempted to shoot Lim for multiple times. All the 17 shots missed which resulted in two other deaths and four people injured. Later, Lim got a ride from a female driver who dropped him at petrol kiosk. Lim then called his friends to send him to the Penang hospital. = Casualties = A 28-years-old RTM cameraman, Muhamad Amirul Amin Amir was shot in the chest was sent to the hospital immediately as well as others who were 38-years-old TNB assistant manager, Nurul Huda Abdul Aziz, 33-years-old doctor, Arivarni Krishnann, and a 56-years-old factory worker, Lee Hong Boon.

Champagne is a psychologist and University Professor of Psychology at the University of Texas at Austin known for her research in the fields of molecular neuroscience, maternal behavior, and epigenetics. Research in the Champagne lab explores the developmental plasticity that occurs in response to environmental experiences. She is known for her work on the epigenetic transmission of maternal behavior. Frances Champagne's research has revealed how natural variations in maternal behavior can shape the behavioral development of offspring through epigenetic changes in gene expression in a brain region specific manner. She won the NIH Director's New Innovator Award in 2007 and the Frank A. Beach Young Investigator Award in Behavioral Neuroendocrinology in 2009. She has been described as the \\"bee's knees of neuroscience\\". She serves on the Committee on Fostering Healthy Mental, Emotional, and Behavioral Development Among Children and Youth in the United States.  Education and teaching  Champagne received her B.A. degree in psychology at Queen's University, Canada. She attended graduate school at McGill University, Canada where she obtained both her M.Sc degree in Psychiatry and a PhD degree in Neuroscience where she studied under the mentorship of Michael Meaney. Champagne completed her postdoctoral research at the University of Cambridge in England, where she studied animal behavior. Frances Champagne was hired as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychology at Columbia University in New York City in 2006. Upon tenure- review, Frances was promoted to Associate Profession, a position she remained until 2017. From 2016-2017, Dr. Champagne also served as the Vice Chair in the Department of Psychology. In 2017, she began her current tenure at University of Texas at Austin as a full professor in the Department of Psychology. She maintains her affiliation with Columbia University as an adjunct associate professor within the department of psychology. As a full professor, she teachers courses including but not limited to the developing brain, behavioral epigenetics and ethics, genetics & the brain.  Research  Champagne's research has examined the neurobiology of the parental brain including neural mechanisms underlying individual differences in maternal behavior and the effects of the environment on these neural circuits. Another main research interest is the epigenetic effects of maternal behavior and how epigenetic variation emerge in response to variation in mother-infant interactions experienced during development. She also researches prenatal programming of offspring development and the impact of prenatal exposure to stress, toxins, or nutritional variation on placental and offspring brain gene expression. Paternal-maternal interplay and offspring development is another research main interest of Champagne and is the impact of fathers on mothers and offspring and the epigenetic mechanisms through which this interplay occurs. In addition, she is interested in exploring ways to ameliorate the negative effects of adverse prenatal and postnatal experiences on development by investigating the epigenetic mechanisms that allow offspring to overcome or be resilient to such early life experiences. Champagne has investigated the epigenetic mechanisms via which individual variation in reproductive and social behavior can be induced via variation in early (prenatal and postnatal) life experiences. She has explored the interplay between mothers and fathers in the development of offspring and transgenerational effects of early life experiences. In her new Epigenetics, Development & Neuroscience Lab, she and her lab members explore the changes that can occur throughout development as a result of environmental conditions. Most notably, the effect of prenatal exposure to bisphenols on mother and infant epigenetic and behavioral outcomes. This work is funded through the National Institute on Environmental Health Sciences. Bisphenols, including but not limited to Bisphenol A, otherwise known as BPA have previously been shown to be endocrine disrupting. Additionally, she is a co-investigator continuing the Boricua Youth Study that began at Columbia University, a longitudinal study aimed at understanding the risks and protective factors that Puerto Rican youth experience. This project is funded through the National Institute on Child Health Development. Lastly and most recently, she served on the committee for the Parental Brain Conference in 2018, a meeting focused on the biological and behavioral perspectives in parental health during the summer of 2018.

He graduated from UNSW (BA Hons Theatre and Film), The Victorian College of the Arts (Post-Grad Dip, Directing Theatre) and NIDA Playwrights Studio. He was Artistic Director of Tantrum Theatre in Newcastle, writer-in-residence at Red Stitch in Melbourne and the Literary Associate at ATYP. His 18 plays have been performed across Australia as well as Ireland, the UK and USA. He was Chair of the Australian Writer’s Guild Playwrights’ Committee between 2012 and 2016, and was the recipient of the Fulbright Scholarship Inaugural Professional Playwriting Scholarship in 2014.... In 2012 his play Silent Disco won the Stage Award at the 45th annual AWGIE Awards. Australian arts journalists have described Philpott's writing style as \\"fluid and musical\\", filled with \\"poetic stylistic devices which he employs\\" that demand \\"verbal dynamics and intricate adjustments [from] actors and demand a focus of concentration and a technique of great security and flexibility\\". The Australian Arts review described him as \\"one of the country’s hottest writers, rocketing into the Sydney theatre landscape in his distinctive language\\"http://artsreview.com.au/m-rock/. The Australian newspaper has compared some of Philpott's work to that of Nobel Prize winning author Patrick White Playwrighting and advocacy work His most recent work, The Trouble With Harry, about the criminal trial of an Australian trans man in the 1920s, opened at the 2014 Melbourne Festival. Writing for The Australian newspaper, journalist Chris Boyd compared Philpott's writing to that of Patrick White, and praised Philpott's \\"poetic ear and alien eye\\": ::Philpott’s play about Harry Crawford, who was convicted of the murder of his wife Annie in the early 1920s, is a poetic fugue for voices. The language is heightened without being self-conscious or arch. Philpott’s easy use of a louse-ridden bantam hen (which turns out to be a rooster) as a device is as effective as the bitch-on- heat motif in White’s The Season at Sarsaparilla. ::His account of working- class life circa 1917 has a cool and non-judgemental curiosity. It’s not detached exactly — there’s a lenient fascination that looks a little like envy — but it’s anthropological somehow. An advocate for the Australian writing professionals, coverage and debate over Philpott's call for greater emphasis on Australian-written content on Australian theatre stages has appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald and his suggestion on a five-year-ban on any further productions of Shakespeare to allow for more productions of Australian works was discussed by panelists including Germaine Greer and John Bell on ABC TV's Q & A program Australian theatre professionals discussed in the mainstream media Philpott's call for a ban, such as director Damian Ryan who told the ABC that though he agreed that some of the Shakespeare's works were done too often in Australia, \\"audiences want to watch it\\" and that \\"actors dream of playing these roles and love to set themselves up against this extraordinary test\\". Elsewhere, writer and director Ross Mueller praised Philpott's contributions to original Australian stage writing and Philpott's call for the ban, presenting the opposite view to Greer in saying that: In 2013, Philpott and the Perth Theatre Company had a well-publicised disagreement over authorship when the Company staged Philpott's play Alienation making substantial changes to the text without the playwright's permission. Philpott removed his name from the production and placed notes of protest on theatre seats on the play's opening nighthttp://www.australianstage.com.au/201307066419/reviews/perth/alienation-%7C-perth- theatre-company.html but via a statement through the Australian Writer's Guild stated his retention of intellectual ownership over the original script. The Perth Theatre Company declined to respond publicly, saying only that they were aware “of statements made by certain stakeholders and partners in our production Alienation. PTC strongly disagrees and is disappointed with these statements and considers them to be inaccurate and unwarranted. PTC will continue to operate in a professional manner, and at this stage, does not intend to make any further public comments, preferring to have the relevant matters resolved through agreed resolution processes” Nevertheless, a proposed Penrith season of the production was cancelled, with the Penrith Theatre Company releasing the following statement: ::Unfortunately, Lachlan Philpott has raised concerns that he considers the production of Alienation currently showing by the Perth Theatre Company (which was to show in Penrith between 18 and 27 July 2013), does not reflect his original, scripted or communicated intentions as the playwright. As such the Penrith season of Alienation has been cancelled. [We are] committed to supporting and promoting the works of Australian playwrights such as Lachlan Philpott. Dr Alyson Campbell, Head of Graduate Studies in Performing Arts at the VCA, chose Philpott to speak about HIV as it is represented in Australian theatre for a panel held in Melbourne in 2014, citing Philpott’s need to address the \\"cultural amnesia about HIV in the gay community”. Philpott spent time in Beijing working with Chinese director Wang Chong on a work about China's \\"Little Emperors\\", the legions of now adult males raised as only children under the one-child program. The Age newspaper described the Melbourne production of the work as \\"a collaboration between Australian playwright Lachlan Philpott and Chinese director Wang Chong [that] dives into some of the social implications through heightened, visually striking domestic melodrama\\" and praised its \\"brilliant direction, concept and design\\"  Plays  *Bison (2000): Premiered at Builders Arms Hotel Melbourne 2000 as part of Midwinta Festival, director Alyson Campbell. * Due Monday (2003): Premiered at NIDA Parade Studio 2003, director Luke Mollinger. * Catapult (2004): Premiered at The Mechanics Institute Brunswick Melbourne 2004, director Alyson Campbell. ** Nominated best play Melbourne Fringe Awards 2005. * Colder (2008): First produced at Griffin Theatre May 2008, director Katrina Douglas.

The South Australia News reported that last March 3, 2017, Superjesus was inducted into the South Australia Hall of Fame at the Mortlock Library, State Library Building in Adelaide. Stuart Rudd and Sarah McLeod performed live. Australian guitarist John Brewster-Jones also played a solo rendition while the talented Baker Suite led by guitarist, soloist, and songwriter John Baker performed with the string quartet of Julian Ferraretto and The Yearlings. Early life and family Stuart Rudd grew up in Adelaide. His father was a drummer in a Scottish pipe band.  The Superjesus  In late 1994 Rudd, together with Sarah McLeod (ex-Fallen Down Monster) (lead vocals, guitar), Paul Berryman (drums) and Chris Tennent (lead guitar) formed Hell's Kitchen in Adelaide. Rudd and Tennent had been jamming together for about a year before Rudd tried out for McLeod's latest band. Hell's Kitchen changed their name to the Superjesus on the eve of the Big Day Out in Adelaide on Australia Day long-weekend, January 1996. In August 1996 the band released their debut EP, Eight Step Rail, which reached the ARIA Singles Chart Top 50 in the following February. At the 1997 ARIA Music Awards The Superjesus won Best New Talent for Eight Step Rail and Breakthrough Artist – Single for \\"Shut My Eyes\\".ARIA Music Awards for the Superjesus: * Search Results 'Superjesus': Note: The 2016 ARIA site does not list a second win for 1997: Breakthrough Artist – Single for \\"Shut My Eyes\\". * 1997 winners and nominees: Note: The archive copy of the ARIA site lists two wins for 1997, the 2016 copy of the site does not. * 1998 winners and nominees: * 2001 winners and nominees: In February 1998 they released their debut album, Sumo, which peaked at No. 2 on the ARIA Albums Chart and was certified platinum by ARIA for shipment of 70,000 copies. At the 1998 ARIA Music Awards the Superjesus were nominated for Best Group, Breakthrough Artist – Album and Best Cover Art. The band released their second album, Jet Age, in October 2000, which peaked at No. 5 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Jet Age was nominated at the 2001 ARIA Music Awards, for Best Rock Album and Best Cover Art. In May 2003 the Superjesus released their third album, Rock Music, which reached No. 14 on the ARIA Albums Chart. The first single from the album, \\"Stick Together\\", was co- written by Rudd and McLeod and peaked at No. 35 on the ARIA Singles Chart. In June 2004 the Superjesus split following their 'Rock Music' tour. Rudd explained in a subsequent interview \\"We were having issues with our management, we were having issues with our record company. Internally within the band we weren't having a break and kept constantly working and working, we hadn't had a break for a long time and it just got to the point where we all thought we'll just take an extended break and see where we go with it, and it ended there.' He told Pearl Davies \\"Well it's not that we broke up at all, we just went home after a show, started to do other projects and just never seemed to get back to it. We probably could have put out a statement or something, woops.\\" Rudd toured as a member of Nick Barker & the Reptiles before joining, Southpoor, with Justin Garner (vocals, guitar) (ex-Nick Costa Band, Nick Barker & the Reptiles), Jad Green (drums), and Bill Rankine (guitar, vocals). On 1 December 2007 Southpoor released its debut album, What Doesn't Kill Ya..., on Mixmaster Records, with Barker and Mick Wordley co- producing. Rudd described his work outside of Superjesus, \\"I was doing the Nick Barker tour which was great fun! I went over and played some shows with him in Melbourne and also in Adelaide. I also have a band called [Southpoor] that is playing, and inbetween that I helped the Gels in the studio and producing their album as well.\\" Note: the source misspells his band as \\"Southport\\". The Superjesus reformed for a one-off reunion show in Adelaide on 1 February 2013. McLeod stating that it was Rudd who inspired the decision to reform. Rudd explained, \\"two or so years ago, Sarah [McLeod] and I were having breakfast and we thought about doing something again. We were both really keen on the idea and of course Paul [Berryman] was living overseas. In the meantime I did a few acoustic shows with Sarah which were great fun. I let it be known to the other guys on how much fun was had. So yeah, then Paul came back and it all kinda lined up you know, and in time for a 10 year reunion, so why not. At least we’re all back in Australia now and can do something together again. We have no management; we’re independent right now so it’s just the band. We have a publicist organising some stuff but other than that, we’re coordinating all the flights and everything. A big job.\\" The band, subsequently performed at the Stone Music Festival with Van Halen and Aerosmith in Sydney in April, before embarking on their first national tour in 10 years – The Resurrection Tour – in May and June. In early 2015 the Superjesus undertook a national tour with the Baby Animals. In June that year the Superjesus released their first single in over a decade, \\"The Setting Sun\\". In November they released a second single, \\"St. Peters Lane\\", written by Rudd and McLeod, with Rudd writing the music in Adelaide and sending it to McLeod in Sydney to add the lyrics. Following the release of the single the band embarked on another national tour.

Function microRNAs (miRNAs) are short (20-24 nt) non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in multicellular organisms by affecting both the stability and translation of mRNAs. miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as part of capped and polyadenylated primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that can be either protein- coding or non-coding. The primary transcript is cleaved by the Drosha ribonuclease III enzyme to produce an approximately 70-nt stem-loop precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which is further cleaved by the cytoplasmic Dicer ribonuclease to generate the mature miRNA and antisense miRNA star (miRNA*) products. The mature miRNA is incorporated into a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which recognizes target mRNAs through imperfect base pairing with the miRNA and most commonly results in translational inhibition or destabilization of the target mRNA. The RefSeq represents the predicted microRNA stem-loop. miR-489 acts as tumor suppressor miRNA in breast cancer by inhibiting various oncogenic signaling pathway.

Calvo and starring Erin Wilhelmi, Quinn Shephard, and Susan Kellermann. The film had its world premiere on September 22, 2016 at Fantastic Fest. Filming for Sweet, Sweet Lonely Girl took place in Vernon, Connecticut during late 2015. Plot Adele is a lonely young teenage woman that has been sent to care for her aunt Dora, an agoraphobic who refuses to have any contact with Adele other than a series of messages and rules slid under her door. She seems to have an escape from this bleak existence after meeting Beth, a vibrant woman her own age and Adele's opposite in looks and personality. As they spend more time together Adele begins to adopt some of Beth's behaviors and mannerisms, which include her deliberately purchasing inexpensive versions of the items Dora asks her to buy so she can pocket the money. Adele initially only replaces food items but is eventually persuaded by Beth to purchase an over the counter natural heart medicine for her aunt rather than her prescription heart medication. This inevitably results in Dora's death, which Adele only learns about when the food tray remains untouched. Upon discovering the body Adele takes a ring with a greenish stone off of her aunt's body and calls the ambulance crew to take away the remains. Adele then takes the ring to Beth and leaves it outside of her apartment door, as she believes them to be in a relationship after the two share moments of passion on a beach. She's hurt to discover that this wasn't the case and storms off, leaving Beth to discover the ring on her own. After this Adele pawns her aunt's jewelry and purchases a blouse she had been eyeing for a while. Wearing the blouse Adele goes to a bar and picks up a guy, who is unable to see Beth watching the two of them at the bar. Later Adele is frightened by Beth, who appears behind her and begins acting strangely. Upon hearing a noise upstairs, Adele goes to investigate and experiences inexplicable phenomena, seeing the decrepit figure of her dead aunt. Unable to leave the house, Adele tries to hide in the basement but is discovered by Beth, who now possesses a monstrous figure. The film then shows that Adele's little sister has come to the house to care for her. Adele now resembles an old woman, implying that Beth has stolen her youth - and is much older than she appears - and that the cycle will repeat itself with her little sister.

In 2012, Denver City Council voted to ban all outdoor medical marijuana ads. History In 2012, Denver City Council voted unanimously to ban all outdoor medical marijuana ads in the state of Colorado, where marijuana is legal to purchase for people 21 years of age or older. This ban includes billboards, posters, bus benches, and sign twirlers. Marijuana businesses are still able to advertise on television, radio, online, and on print but must use a disclaimer indicating the products being advertised are for registered Colorado medical marijuana patients only. And according to the law system of California, medical marijuana card can not be received online, it's illegal. The council's Debbie Ortega and Christopher Herndon are behind the proposal which is an expansion of a May plan by Ortega that called for a ban on medical marijuana ads within 1,000 feet of schools, daycares and parks after she received complaints from constituents, Westword reports. Public opinion The medical marijuana community in Denver remains divided on this issue. The Cannabis Business Alliance, one advocacy group that fought against the full ad ban, was disappointed by the outcome. They claim that although they supported the original proposal to ban ads within 1,000 feet of schools and parks, the terms of this full ban are not clear enough in regards to outside marketing that falls outside of billboards, bus benches, and sign twirlers like festivals and merchandise. Kush Magazine went as far as saying that the ban is a violation of the First Amendment. Debate Kush Magazine reported in June that the often loud, over-the-top advertising by medical marijuana dispensaries in Denver has to do with trying to stand out in an overcrowded marketplace—there are approximately 200 dispensaries in Denver alone competing for more than 50,000 valid patients. Pot industry magazine The Medical Marijuana Business Daily says that the ban could force dispensaries to market themselves in more traditional ways making it harder to stand out and much harder to attract local passersby with a showy billboard or sign twirler. The magazine argued that possibly this could be a good thing because the signage the proposed ban addresses has created some backlash. On the other side of the debate is the Medical Marijuana Industry Group (MMIG), a trade association that advocates for responsible medical marijuana regulation at the local, state, and national level, who actively pushed for the ad ban that passed, and says the ban is ultimately positive for the industry. Michael Elliott, the executive director of MMIG explained in a Huffington Post article why he and his group supported the article: \\"The Denver City Council recently passed an ordinance which will eliminate certain troublesome advertising practices utilized by some participants in the medical marijuana industry. My organization, the Medical Marijuana Industry Group (MMIG), supported this ordinance because we believe it finds the right balance between protecting the interests of the medical marijuana community and the citizens of Denver [...] Under the new ordinance, medical marijuana businesses will still have access to a comprehensive range of affordable venues in which to advertise. These include but are not limited to: the print media, merchandising, and web-based solutions including social media. In addition, business signage will still be allowed. But most importantly, patients can be assured that they will have the necessary tools to easily locate and procure their medication. Put simply, this ordinance addresses those concerns most often voiced by Denver’s citizenry, while maintaining the rights of industry participants to market their businesses in an efficient, fair, and cost-effective manner.\\" The Associated Press reports that Colorado attorney Lenny Frieling, an outspoken marijuana legalization advocate, did not want marijuana singled out like this saying, \\"I don't think any medicines should be advertised, period, end of story. Whether it's medical marijuana or something that will give me an erection for eight hours, I find it all inappropriate,\\" Frieling said. \\"Ban it all or don't ban any of it.\\" However most of Denver's city council members disagreed with Frieling and do want to give medical marijuana businesses the ability to advertise—just not in the over-the-top way that some have been. \\"We are still allowing advertising,\\" Councilman Herndon, one of the backers of the ad ban said. \\"We just don't want it in your face.\\" Despite the rules against allowing dispensaries to advertise in the public space, the magazine High Times has sued the state of Colorado in order to gain advertising in print press. The law states that stores providing recreational marijuana can advertise in publications that have \\"reliable evidence that no more than 30 percent of the publication's readership is reasonably expected to be under the age of 21\\". This lawsuit argues that the inability to advertise in magazines, as well as any kind of medium, is a restriction on the freedom of speech article in the US Constitution. However, none of these policies apply to the medical marijuana business. Also accompanying the High Times magazine in this lawsuit is a local publication called Westwood. David Lane, the attorney representing High Times, states that these rules \\"irrationally single out Retail Marijuana Establishments for more stringent advertising restrictions than those regulating the alcohol industry, although the Colorado Constitution calls for the regulation of marijuana ‘in a manner similar to alcohol.’\\" This lawsuit, commencing in February, still has not come to any conclusion. In August of 2014, Colorado public health officials started an advertising campaign targeted at teenagers warning them of the dangers of smoking marijuana during adolescence. The campaign, which is called \\"Don't Be a Lab Rat\\", is displaying human-sized cages across Colorado that display provocative messages about harm the drug can cause while the teenage body is maturing. This campaign, which also includes television commercials, has been criticized by Colorado's legal cannabis industry and has been called a scare tactic. The campaign has been funded with $2 million from the state attorney generals office, as well as the city of Denver, and foundations across the state. Mike Sukle's advertising agency was hired by the state and designed the campaign and has called the job \\"a monumental task\\". Later that August in 2014, the city of Boulder, Colorado’s superintendent, Bruce Messinger, announced that the \\"Don’t Be a Lab Rat\\" campaign would not be appropriate for the community. Messinger stated that his objection to the campaign was the fact that inviting pre-teen to teenage students into massive rat cages was not the most effective way to get their message across. Messinger was quoted saying \\"scare tactics don’t work\\". He then went on in the interview to question the validity of some of the studies referred to in the \\"Don’t Be a Lab Rat\\" campaign. On the other hand, Dr. Larry Wolk, the executive director and chief medical officer at the state health department and one of the driving forces behind \\"Don’t Be a Lab Rat\\", stated that the entire intent of the campaign was to get kids to start talking amongst themselves and with adults about the possible effects of marijuana. Although the campaign was shut down in the schools within Boulder, it has been, according to Dr. Wolk, very successful in other locations. For example, the campaigns that were in Denver’s public library and downtown skate park had received much positive feedback. In response to this campaign, U.S. Representative Jared Polis (D-Colo.) has been quoting saying: \\"It's a bizarre, ill-fated campaign...I think they need to go back to the drawing board on that one.\\" Polis went on to say that \\"Most people who saw [the advertisements] thought they had something to do with PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals), like they are trying to free laboratory rats from the University of Colorado...And also, kids are playing in the cages.\\" While Rep. Polis has been critical, Dr. Wolk says \\"We are pleased that the Don't Be a Lab Rat campaign has served as a catalyst to start a much-needed conversation among teens, parents and influencers about the potential negative effects of marijuana on developing brains...Critique and criticism of the creative elements of the campaign were to be expected and have helped further the conversation.\\" References Advertising Cannabis culture Cannabis in Colorado Denver ","title":"Cannabis advertising in Denver"},{"id":"52490647","text":"Anancylus albofasciatus is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

Sanjayan completed his graduate studies in chemistry from the University of Kerala in 1988 and obtained a master's degree from Banaras Hindu University in 1990. He continued his studies at BHU under the guidance of Arya K. Mukerjee and after securing a PhD in 1994, he did his post doctoral studies at National Chemical Laboratory (NCL) during 1995–98 under the supervision of Krishna N. Ganesh, a Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar laureate. On completion of his studies, he joined NCL as a scientist, but had a second stint of post-doctoral studies at the University of Oxford at the laboratory of G. W. J. Fleet during 2000–01. At NCL, he serves as a senior scientist and as the head of the Sanjayan Lab.  Legacy  Sanjayan and his team of scientists at Sanjayan Lab are involved in the studies of molecular architecture with designer characteristics as well as the design and synthesis of molecules that has relevance in medicinal chemistry, especially in therapeutic uses for treating cancer and cardiac diseases. He is known to have synthesized designer peptide and protein mimetics, hetero- foldamers and tubulin-binding agents for treating cancer. His work also covers the development of new organic dyes. His researches have been documented by way of a number of peer-reviewed articles; ResearchGate, an online article repository of scientific articles, has listed 74 of them.  Awards and honors  Sanjayan, who held the research grant of the International Foundation for Science in 2007, received the Scientist of the Year Award of the National Chemical Laboratory in 2008, the same year as he received the fellowship of the Indo-US Science and Technology Forum. Two years later, he received the Ranbaxy Research Award followed by the Award for Excellence in Drug Research of the Central Drug Research Institute in 2011. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research awarded him the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize, one of the highest Indian science awards, in 2012. The year 2013 brought him two awards, viz. the annual award of the Organization of Pharmaceutical producers of India and the Bronze Medal of the Chemical Research Society of India. Panjab University honored him with the Bhagyatara Award in 2014.  See also  * Krishna N.
