He served as President of the Board of Education in 1924 and between 1929 and 1931 in the first two Labour administrations of Ramsay MacDonald. Background Wallington Hall Born into a liberal aristocratic family (see Trevelyan baronets of Nettlecombe, 1662), Charles was the eldest son of Sir George Trevelyan, 2nd Baronet, and his wife Caroline, daughter of Robert Needham Philips MP. He was the grandson of Sir Charles Trevelyan, 1st Baronet, the elder brother of R. C. Trevelyan and G. M. Trevelyan and the great-nephew of Lord Macaulay. He was the great-great grandson of Sir John Trevelyan, 4th Baronet (1735‚Äì1828). Family legend traced their ancestry to Sir Trevillian, one of King Arthur's knights, who swam ashore on horseback when Lyonesse sank. The family kept three houses year round: Wallington Hall, which the family had owned since 1777, Welcombe House, and a town house in Westminster. The family estates comprised more than 11,000 acres. After Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge, Charles Philips decided upon a political career. Beatrice Webb, his friend, described him as \\"a man who has every endowment - social position, wealth, intelligence, an independent outlook, good looks, good manners\\".A Very British Family: the Trevelyans and their world, Laura Trevelyan, London 2006, page 102 Political career Trevelyan was first a Liberal and later a Labour MP. His eventual political achievements were uneven. As a member of the landed gentry serving in the Labour Party, he was considered by some to be a walking anachronism. Despite this, his own privileges and gentlemanly pursuits always remained intact. Trevelyan was elected Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Elland, Yorkshire, in a by-election in 1899. He served under H. H. Asquith as Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Education between 1908 and 1914, when, as an opponent of British entry into the First World War, he resigned from the government. In 1914, also, he founded the Union of Democratic Control an all- party organisation rallying opposition to the war. In the 1918 general election he lost his Elland seat, running as an Independent Labour candidate.F. Craig, British Parliamentary Election Results 1918-1949 He won Newcastle Central for Labour in 1922 and held it until 1931.leighrayment.com House of Commons: Na H-Eileanan An Iar to Newport He was a member of Ramsay MacDonald's Labour cabinets as President of the Board of Education between January and November 1924 and between 1929 and 1931, resigning when his Education Bill was rejected by the Lords a few months before the Labour government collapsed.AJP Taylor, English History 1914-1945, p 279-280 In 1924 he was sworn of the Privy Council. In 1928 he succeeded his father as third Baronet. In early 1939, following Stafford Cripps and with Aneurin Bevan among others, Trevelyan was briefly expelled from the Labour Party for persisting with support for a \\"popular front\\" (involving co-operation with the Liberal Party and Communist Party) against the National Government.David Rubinstein The Labour Party and British Society: 1880-2005, 2005, Sussex Academic Press, p74. The reference is online here . Apart from his political career Trevelyan was also Lord Lieutenant of Northumberland between 1930 and 1949. He was the last surviving member of the first British Labour Cabinet. Family Trevelyan married Mary Katherine Bell, a younger half-sister of Gertrude Bell and the daughter of Sir Thomas Bell, 2nd Baronet. They had six children including his eldest son, Sir George Trevelyan, whom he disinherited. He passed Wallington Hall, which he had inherited in 1928, to the National Trust, the first such property to be owned by the Trust. He died in January 1958, aged 87.

West of the pass, the port of entry on the Kazakhstan side is Dostyk. Alashankou is from Bole, from √úr√ºmqi, and from Almaty. The weather in Alashankou is harsh. Alashankou is one of China's national first-class ports of entry. The volume of imports and exports passing through Alashankou accounts for 90% of the total for all of Xinjiang. Since 2010 it has surpassed Manzhouli, Inner Mongolia to become the busiest land port-of-entry in China.

Transport  The agreement between the Soviet Union and the China to connect Kazakhstan with Western China by rail was achieved in 1954. On the Soviet side, the railway reached the border town of Druzhba (Dostyk) in 1959. On the Chinese side, however, the westward construction of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang railway was stopped once it reached Urumqi in 1962. Due to the Sino-Soviet split, the railway link was not completed until September 12, 1990. The highway port of entry was opened in December 1995. The railway networks of the two countries use different gauges (China, like most of Europe, uses the standard gauge of , but Russia uses the broader gauge of ), so there are breaks of gauge. It is proposed to build a standard gauge Transcontinental Railway to link Europe and China to bypass these two breaks of gauge. This project was signed in 2004.

Yam nurses stray and injured animals of all kinds, but he never has nice things to say to Joei. Despite this, she persists in flirting with Yam and making unwanted physical advances. Meanwhile, Soy and Tong cuddle, kiss and hug each other at every opportunity. Soy's aunt, the haughty village moneylender, Dok Toh, disapproves of Soy seeing Tong, whom Dok Toh believes is too low class for her niece. She orders Soy and Joei to stay away from Tong and Yam. The social-climbing Dok Toh additionally arranges for Soy to meet the handsome, yet dull, son of the local sheriff, who has a pair of slow-witted henchmen who will help enforce Dok Toh's orders that Joei and Soy never again see Yam and Tong. However, on the night of a village temple fair, Tong and Soy and Yam and Joei sneak away and each couple finds a place to spend the night together. Tong and Soy stay up all night talking about their feelings for one another, while Joei takes sexual advantage of Yam. Dok Toh finds out about Joei and Soy's misadventures and arranges to send them away to Bangkok. Soy will attend a trade school, learning English language and secretarial skills while Joei will learn to be a seamstress and hairdresser. With the money earned while she is in Bangkok, Joei transforms herself by assembling a new wardrobe and undergoing beauty treatments, including having her skin lightened, a prominent mole removed, and her teeth straightened and whitened. In Joei's absence, Yam begins to long for her, discovering that he cares for her after all. Both Soy and Joei write letters to their men, but they hear nothing in return. It turns out that Dok Toh has bribed the postman to deliver letters addressed to Yam and Tong to her, and she in turn dumps the letters into the river. Joei and Soy determine that their letters aren't getting through, so they write to the abbot at the local Buddhist temple and ask him to deliver their letters to Yam and Tong. Yam and Tong, meanwhile, strike out on their own and head for Bangkok to try to find the girls. Neither had ever been to the city before, and did not realize how big the capital was. Discouraged by their lack of success, they return home, but through the efforts of the monk, they finally hear from Soy and Joei. The girls return to Yasothon for Songkran, and Soy is reunited with Tong. Yam is heartbroken when he does not see Joei on the bus. In fact she was on the bus, but because she had drastically changed her appearance, Yam did not recognize her, and showed no interest in Joei when she approached him. The engagement of Soy and the sheriff's son is still on, though. Tong falls into despair, starts drinking and becomes a hopeless alcoholic. On the day of the engagement ceremony, Tong's father shows up with shotgun to disrupt the proceedings. He points out that Soy does not love the sheriff's son and he demands that Tong be allowed to marry Soy. As for Yam, he comes around and sees that Joei is the same woman, even if she's changed on the outside.

The aria is sung by Rodolfo to Mim√¨ when they first meet. In the aria he tells her of his life as a poet, and ends by asking her to tell him more about her life.\\"Che gelida manina\\", Italian and English text, Aria Database. Retrieved 12 November 2019 It is one of the most recorded arias by tenors. Dramatic context A performance of La boh√®me, scene of Rodolfo meeting Mim√¨ before the aria The scene takes place on Christmas Eve in the Latin Quarter of Paris. Rodolfo, a struggling poet, is in his room when he hears someone knocking at the door. He opens the door and sees Mim√¨, a neighbour who has come to his room because her candle has been extinguished and she needs light to go to her room. While in his room, she feels faint and he helps her to sit, and she accidentally drops her room key. Afterwards, with her candle lit, Mim√¨ starts to leave, but finds her key missing. Both their candles then go out, and the two of them search for her room key together in darkness. Rodolfo finds her key but hides it. Rodolfo then touches her hand in the dark and feels the coldness of her hand, and he starts to sing the aria. The song begins in a recitative manner with \\"Che gelida manina, se la lasci riscaldar\\" (\\"What a frozen little hand, let me warm it for you\\"), which quickly turns into an aria. In the song Rodolfo tells Mim√¨ that he is a poet - \\"Chi son? Sono un poeta\\" (\\"Who am I? I am a poet\\"), talks of his life as a poet living in carefree poverty, and about his hopes and dreams. He then admits that she has stolen his heart, and ends by asking her about her life. In reply, Mim√¨ sings her aria \\"S√¨, mi chiamano Mim√¨\\" (\\"Yes, they call me Mim√¨\\"), and the scene concludes in a duet \\"O soave fanciulla\\" where they realise that they have fallen for each other. Composition Teatro Regio in Turin in 1896 The aria was composed by Puccini with libretto by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa. It contains an original feature that Puccini introduced - it has three distinct musical paragraphs that lack tonal balance but are nonetheless coherent as a whole. The initial part is tender, the second part (starting with \\"Chi son? Sono un poeta\\") is distinctly different in tone, bolder and contains a motif for Rodolfo. The third part starts with \\"Talor dal mio forziere\\", the beginning of the 'love' motif used in the opera. In the autograph score of the opera, the opening section of the aria and the preceding passage was originally written in C major rather than D-flat major that is used. The song however may be transposed down half a step by those who find the climactic high C difficult to sing. Performances and recordings La boh√®me is one of the most popular operas, and \\"Che gelida manina\\", being the best-known tenor aria of the opera, is consequently one of the most recorded arias by tenors. Between 1900 and 1980, almost 500 tenors recorded this aria in at least seven different languages. The opera premiered in Turin in 1896 with the role of Rodolfo played by Evan Gorga, although Gorga had difficulty with the high tessitura and the music had to be transposed down for him. Recordings of the aria began a few years after the premiere. An early recording was by Enrico Caruso recorded in 1906. Caruso had reputedly sung the aria in 1897 for Puccini who said: \\"Who sent you to me--God?\\" Beniamino Gigli performed the aria in the 1936 film Ave Maria. The aria was one of the arias recorded by Mario Lanza in his first recordings in 1949; his recording of \\"Che gelida manina\\" won the Operatic Recording of the Year awarded by the National Record Critics Association, and it was later included in RCA's Hall of Fame historical recordings. The first known recording by Luciano Pavarotti is of this aria recorded in 1961 during his professional debut at the Teatro Municipale in Reggio Emilia, and he then recorded the aria in 1963 in London. Pavarotti had made many notable recordings of the song in his performances of La boh√®me, including the 1979 La Scala performance and a 1973 recording conducted by Herbert von Karajan. Lyrics Che gelida manina, se la lasci riscaldar. Cercar che giova? Al buio non si trova. Ma per fortuna √© una notte di luna, e qui la luna l'abbiamo vicina. Aspetti, signorina, le dir√≤ con due parole chi son, chi son, e che faccio, come vivo. Vuole? Chi son? Chi son? Sono un poeta. Che cosa faccio? Scrivo. E come vivo? Vivo. In povert√† mia lieta scialo da gran signore rime ed inni d'amore. Per sogni e per chimere e per castelli in aria, l'anima ho milionaria. Talor dal mio forziere ruban tutti i gioelli due ladri, gli occhi belli. V'entrar con voi pur ora, ed i miei sogni usati e i bei sogni miei, tosto si dileguar! Ma il furto non m'accora, poich√©, poich√© v'ha preso stanza la dolce speranza! Or che mi conoscete, parlate voi, deh! Parlate. Chi siete? Vi piaccia dir! Your tiny hand is frozen! Let me warm it into life. Our search is useless; In darkness all is hidden. Ere long the light of the moon shall aid us, Yes, in the moonlight our search let us continue. So listen, pretty maiden, while I tell you in a moment Just who I am, what I do, and how I live. Shall I? I am, I am, I am a poet. What's my employment? Writing! Is that a living? Hardly! I've wit tho' wealth be wanting; Ladies of rank and fashion all inspire me with passion. In dreams and fond illusions or castles in the air. Richer is none on earth than I! Bright eyes as yours, believe me, Steal my priceless jewels In Fancy's storehouse cherish'd. Your roguish eyes have robb'd me, Of all my dreams bereft me, dreams that are fair yet fleeting. Fled are my truant fancies, Regrets I do not cherish. For now life's rosy morn is breaking, now golden love is waking! Now that I've told my story, pray tell me yours, too, tell me frankly, who are you?

Edmund Carroll Jaeger, D.Sc., University of California, Riverside, Science Library (January 28, 1887 ‚Äì August 2, 1983) was an American biologist known for his works on desert ecology. He was born in Loup City, Nebraska to Katherine (n√©e Gunther) and John Philip Jaeger, and moved to Riverside, California in 1906 with his family. (Nita Hiltner, next reference, says the move was in 1910.) He was the first to document, in The Condor, (photographs by Kenneth Middleham) a state of extended torpor, approaching hibernation, in a bird, the common poorwill. (Joseph Ewan, the preceding reference, says the move was in 1906.) He also described this in the National Geographic Magazine. Life Jaeger first attended the newly relocated Occidental College in Eagle Rock, Los Angeles (in 1914), but moved to Palm Springs in 1915, where he taught at the one-room schoolhouse. At Palm Springs he met artist Carl Eytel, (here for Table of Contents) and authors J. Smeaton Chase and Charles Francis Saunders. These men formed what University of Arizona Professor Peter Wild called a \\"Creative Brotherhood\\" that lived in Palm Springs in the early 20th century. Other Brotherhood members included cartoonist and painter Jimmy Swinnerton, author George Wharton James, and photographers Fred Payne Clatworthy and Stephen H. Willard. The men lived near each other (like Jaeger, Eytel built his own cabin), traveled together throughout the Southwest, helped with each other's works, and exchanged photographs which appeared in their various books. He then returned to Occidental to complete his degree in 1918 and started teaching at Riverside Junior College. Retiring from teaching after 30 years, he worked the Riverside Municipal MuseumRiverside Museum: Permanent Exhibits in Riverside. During all these years Jaeger used his Palm Springs cabin for his research trips across the desert.

History and profile B√∏rsen was founded in 1896 by merchant and editor Theodor Hans Carsten Green.Den Store Danske ‚Äì B√∏rsen In 1899, it was changed into a newspaper with a particular focus on business and stock exchange content. From then and until 1909, B√∏rsen was also formally associated with Grosserer-Societetet (en: The Merchant Society). In 1969 the majority shareholder became the Swedish Bonnier Group. The publishing house changed its name to Forlaget B√∏rsen Ltd. In 1970, the paper was reorganized to almost exclusively feature business news, resulting in an improved net circulation. The success of the Swedish business magazine Veckans Aff√§rer was functional in this change. In January 2016 negotiations were underway for Bonnier Group to sell B√∏rsen to JP/Politikens Hus at the price of 800 million kroner. The Danish Competition and Consumer Authority (Konkurrence- og Forbrugerstyrelsen) indicated that it was opposed to a merger because the combined company would be too dominant in the Danish market. Tuesday 24 January 2017 JP/Politikens Hus A/S said it had withdrawn its offer to merge with Dagbladet B√∏rsen and instead had opted for a 49.9% ownership of Dagbladet B√∏rsen for a price of 400 million Danish kroner. Bonnier Group would have a 50.1% ownership of the company. B√∏rsen is published on weekdays, not on weekends, and is based in Copenhagen. B√∏rsen has no political affiliation, but it supports the free market economy and private business as well as worldwide trade. The paper publishes a list, B√∏rsen Guld. Circulation In 1948 the circulation of B√∏rsen was 8,400 copies. During the last six months of 1957 the paper had a circulation of 7,552 copies on weekdays. It was 7,413 copies in 1960 and 6,934 copies in 1970. Its circulation rose to 31,414 copies in 1980 and to 42,933 copies in 1990. From 1991 to 1994 the paper had a fixed circulation of 42,000 copies. Its circulation was 41,000 copies in 1995, again 42,000 copies in 1996 and 41,000 copies in 1997. It slightly rose to 43,000 copies in 1998 and to 45,000 copies in 1999. B√∏rsen had a circulation of 53,000 copies for both the first quarter of 2000 and for 2000 as a whole, making it one of the top 20 newspapers in the country. Its circulation was 58,000 copies in 2001, 60,000 copies in 2002. and 62,000 copies in 2003 and 67,000 copies in 2004.

Pre-Independence period Lebanese President Alfred Naqqache (right) pictured with President Taj al-Din al-Hasani of Syria. Both men were French appointees. While the Lebanese have been in a constant struggle for independence from foreign powers since the age of the Old Testament, the modern struggle for Lebanese independence can be traced back to the emergence of Fakhr-al-Din II in the late 16th century, a Druze chief who became the first local leader in a thousand years to bring the major sects of Mount Lebanon into sustained mutual interaction. Fakhr-al-Din also brought western Europe back to Mount Lebanon. The French traveler Laurent ƒèArvieux observed massive French commercial buildings in Sidon, Fakhr-al-Din's political centre, where bustling crowds of Muslims, Maronites, Orthodox Christians and Jews intermingled.Deidre Pettet, \\"A Veritable Bedouin: The Chevalier ƒèArvieux in the Camp of the Emir Turabey,\\" in Distant Lands and Diverse Cultures: The French Experience in Asia, 1600-1700, ed. Glen Ames and Ronald Love (Westport: Greenwood Press, 2003), p. 25 Under his rule, printing presses were introduced and Jesuit priests and Catholic nuns encouraged to open schools throughout the land. Fakhr-al-Din's growing influence, disobedience and ambitions threatened Ottoman interests. Ottoman Turkish troops captured Fakhr-al-Din and had him executed in Istanbul in 1635.Harris, William. Lebanon: a history, 600-2011. Oxford University Press, 2012, p. 102. In response to a massacre of Maronites by Druze during the 1860 civil war, 6000 French troops landed near Beirut to ostensibly protect the Maronite communities. The Ottoman sultan had no choice but to approve the French landing at Beirut and review the status of Mount Lebanon. In 1861, the Ottomans and five European powers (Britain, France, Russia, Austria, and Prussia) negotiated a new political system for Mount Lebanon in a commission chaired by Mehmed Fuad Pasha, the Ottoman Foreign Minister. The international commission established a tribunal to punish the Druze lords for war crimes and the commission further agreed on an autonomous province of Mount Lebanon. In September 1864, the Ottomans and Europeans signed the r√®glement organique defining the new entity, including the French recommendation of an elected multi-communal council to advise the governor.Harris, William. Lebanon: a history, 600-2011. Oxford University Press, 2012, p. 159. Electoral representation and rough demographic weighting of communal membership was established after the foundation of the autonomous Mount Lebanon province. A two-stage electoral process became refined over several decades, with secret balloting introduced in 1907. Mount Lebanon became the only Ottoman provincial council that was democratically elected, representing members of the major sects. Elections for one-third of the council seats took place every two years. The governor of Mount Lebanon, a non-Maronite Catholic from outside, was of Ottoman ministerial rank with the title Pasha, though a step below a full provincial governor. Presiding judges of district courts were from the same sect as the largest religious group in the district, with deputy judges representing the next two largest groups. Court decisions had to involve the Court President and at least one other judge. This system facilitated Maronite acquiescence, Druze re-integration and sectarian reconciliation in Mount Lebanon.Harris, William. Lebanon: a history, 600-2011. Oxford University Press, 2012, p. 160. With the onset of World War I, the Ottoman Sultanate began to disintegrate. The Ottomans feared Arab independence. In response, the Ottomans abolished the autonomous province of Mount Lebanon in 1915, putting the mountain communities under emergency military rule. The repression culminated on 6 May 1916, with the hanging of 14 activists and journalists, including proponents of both Arab and Lebanese independence, Christians and Muslims, clerics and secularists. The location of the hangings in central Beirut became known as Martyrs' Square, today the focal point of public Lebanese political expression. Respect for Ottoman authority in the local community collapsed after this event. The Ottomans confiscated grain from the Levant during the war, resulting in a massive famine. Half the population of Mount Lebanon was wiped out.L. Schatkowski Shilcher, \\"The Famine of 1915-1918 in Ottoman Syria,\\" in J. Spagnolo ed., Problems of the Modern Middle East in Historical Perspective: Essays in Honour of Albert Hourani (Reading: Ithaca, 1992), pp. 234-238.Isam Khalife, Lubnan 1914-1918 min khilal Arshif Wizarat al-kharijia al-Faransiya (Beirut: Isam Khalife, 2005), p. 39. Both Schilcher and Khalife estimated up to 200,000 deaths in the mountain. Patriarch Elias al-Huwayyik in 1899. =A Phoenician identity= Following Ottoman repression, the Arabs were fed up with Ottoman rule. After the Turks were expelled from the Levant at the end of World War I, the Syrian National Congress in Damascus proclaimed independence and sovereignty over a region that also included Lebanon in 1920.King, William C. King's Complete History of the World War, The History Associates, 1922, p. 665. In Beirut, the Christian press expressed its hostility to the decisions of the Syrian National Congress. Lebanese nationalists used the crisis to convene a council of Christian figures in Baabda that proclaimed the independence of Lebanon on 22 March 1920.Elie Podeh, The Politics of National Celebrations in the Arab Middle East, Cambridge University Press, 2011 p. 54. Despite these declarations, the region was divided among the victorious British and French according to the Sykes- Picot agreement. Mount Lebanon Maronites under the Maronite Patriarch Elias al-Huwayyik lobbied the French for an enlarged Lebanon to become a Catholic Christian homeland. Patriarch al-Huwayyik shrewdly conflated a new Lebanon with ancient Phoenicia to highlight a unique personality. The Phoenician allusion derived from a European passion for romanticizing antiquity (see Ernest Renan's Mission de Ph√©nicie, 1864).Asher Kaufman, Reviving Phoenicia: The Search for Identity in Lebanon (London: I.B. Tauris, 2004), p. 22. Among the wider public, the resurrection of Phoenicia and the concept of a distinctive Lebanon received stimulus from the literary output of Jibran Khalil Jibran. Jibran drew out feelings of oppression and conflict with established religion and interpersonal tensions. These themes resonated with a multi-sectarian Lebanon. Jibran's combination of Christian ambience with outreach to Muslims reinforced Lebanese nationalist thought. Incorporation of Jibran into school curricula in the 1920s helped make him by far Lebanon's most influential writer. Greater Lebanon from Ra's Naqura in the south to Nahr al-Kabir north of Tripoli, and from the coast to the Anti-Lebanon mountains was established under the French provisional mandate in April 1920. Patriarch al-Huwayyik, with the Ottoman imposed famine in recent memory, insisted on the acquisition of the Biqa valley, a principal food producing area. The French were supposed to guide the population to self-determination with regular progress reports to the League of Nations. In reality, the French arrested and suppressed proponents of self-determination at various times.Harris, William. Lebanon: a history, 600-2011. Oxford University Press, 2012. France confirmed the electoral system of the former Ottoman Mount Lebanon province in setting up a Representative Council for Greater Lebanon in 1922. Two stage elections, universal adult male suffrage, and multimember multi-communal constituencies continued the situation that prevailed in Mount Lebanon up to 1914. The brief term (November 1925-August 1926) of the first civilian High Commissioner, French senator and journalist Henry de Jouvenel, proved decisive in the history of the Lebanese republic. A newly elected Representative Council became the clearinghouse for Lebanese input, and de Jouvenel endorsed it as the de facto constituent assembly. The Representative Council delegated drafting of a constitution to a twelve-member committee. The concept of Greater Lebanon as a Christian/Muslim partnership distinct from its Arab hinterland underpinned the project. The leading lights of the committee were non-Maronite Christians - Michel Chiha, Orthodox chairman Shibli Dammus and the Orthodox Petro Grad. They adapted the 1875 French constitution, and De Jouvenal hastened the Representative Council to enact the draft in May 1926.Salibi, Kamal. The Modern History of Lebanon. New York: Caravan Books, 1977. It included a republic, executive power shared between the President and Prime Minister, a two-chamber legislature, equittable multi-communal representation, and Greater Lebanon as the final homeland of its inhabitants. The Franco-Lebanese Treaty of 1936 promised complete independence and membership within the League of Nations within three years. The conservative French National Assembly refused to ratify the Treaty. When the Vichy government assumed power over French territory in 1940, General Henri Fernand Dentz was appointed as High Commissioner of Lebanon. This new turning point led to the resignation of Lebanese president Emile Edde on 4 April 1941. After 5 days, Dentz appointed Alfred Naccache for a presidency period that lasted only 3 months and ending with the surrender of the Vichy forces posted in Lebanon and Syria to the Free French and British troops. On 14 July 1941, an armistice was signed in Acre ending the clashes between the two sides and opening the way for General Charles de Gaulle's visit to Lebanon, thus ending Vichy's control. Having the opportunity to discuss matters of sovereignty and independence, the Lebanese national leaders asked de Gaulle to end the French Mandate and unconditionally recognize Lebanon's independence. After national and international pressure, General Georges Catroux (a delegate general under de Gaulle) proclaimed in the name of his government the Lebanese independence on 26 November 1941. Countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, the Arab states, the Soviet Union, and certain Asian countries recognized this independence, and some of them even exchanged ambassadors with Beirut. However this didn't stop the French from exercising their authority.http://countrystudies.us/lebanon/21.htm, World War II and Independence. On 8 November 1943, and after electing president Bechara El Khoury and appointing prime minister Riad al-Solh, the Chamber of Deputies amended the Lebanese Constitution, which abolished the articles referring to the Mandate and modified the specified powers of the High Commissioner, thus unilaterally ending the Mandate. The French responded by arresting the President, the Prime Minister, and other cabinet members, and exiling them to an old citadel located in Rashaya. This incident, which unified the Christian and Muslim opinion towards the mandate, led to an international pressure demanding the Lebanese leaders' release and massive street protests. Government of Bechamoun After the imprisonment of the Lebanese officials, the Lebanese MPs reunited in the house of the speaker of parliament, Sabri Hamad√©, and assigned the two uncaught ministers Emir Majid Arslan (Minister of National Defence) and Habib Abou Chahla to carry out the functions of the government. The two ministers then moved to Bechamoun and their government became known as the Government of Bechamoun. The Government was provided shelter and protection in the residences of Hussein and Youssef El Halabi, recognized leaders in Bechamoun. These residences were strategically located, providing optimum protection to the ministers. The newly formed government refused to hold talks with General Catroux or any other mandate official, stressing that any negotiation should be done with the captured government. It also formed a military resistance under the name of the \\"National Guard\\", whose supreme commander was Naim Moghabghab, with the help of Adib el Beainy and Munir Takieddine. This military group fought the battle of independence and later became the core of the Lebanese Army that was later formed in 1946 under the leadership of Emir Majid and Naim Moghabghab. Bechara El Khoury (official portrait). Finally, France yielded to the augmenting pressure of the Lebanese people, as well as the demand of numerous countries and released the prisoners from Rashaya in the morning of Monday 22 November 1943. Since then, this day has been celebrated as the Lebanese Independence Day.www.lgic.org, (1920-1943) Mandate Period and Independence. URL accessed on 7 June 2008.

Flag as drawn and approved by the members of the Lebanese Parliament during the declaration of independence in 1943. Post-Independence period After the independence, the modern Lebanese political system was founded in 1943 by an unwritten agreement between the two most prominent Christian and Muslim leaders, Khouri and al-Solh and which was later called the National Pact (al Mithaq al Watani ÿßŸÑŸÖŸäÿ´ÿßŸÇ ÿßŸÑŸàÿ∑ŸÜŸä ).Harris, William. Lebanon: a history, 600-2011. Oxford University Press, 2012. The National Pact had 4 principles: # Lebanon was to be a completely politically independent state. Lebanon would not enter into Western led alignments; in return, Lebanon would not compromise its sovereignty with Arab states. # Lebanon would have an Arab face and another for the West, as it could not cut off its spiritual and intellectual ties with the West, which had helped it attain such a notable degree of progress. # Lebanon, as a member of the family of Arab states, should cooperate with the other Arab states where possible, and in case of conflict among them, it should not side with one state against another. #Public offices should be distributed proportionally among the recognized religious groups, but in technical positions preference should be given to competence without regard to confessional considerations. Moreover, the three top government positions should be distributed as follows: the president of the republic should be a Maronite and the prime minister, a Sunni Muslim. The speaker of the Chamber of Deputies was reserved for a Shi'i Muslim in 1947. The ratio of deputies was to be six Christians to five Muslims. In 1945, Lebanon became a founding member of the Arab League (22 March) and a founding member of the United Nations (UN San Francisco Conference of 1945). On 31 December 1946, French troops withdrew completely from Lebanon.

It was created in 1974 in Colombia by a group of scientists and professionals led by Farzam Arbab, a renowned physicist who had arrived as a visiting professor to the University of Valle in 1970. There are two main programs‚Äîthe Tutorial Learning System (SAT), a secondary level educational system used by over 25,000 students throughout the Americas, and the University Center for Rural Well-Being (CUBR). The curriculum aims to develop in its students capabilities in five main fields: mathematics, science, language and communication, technology, and service to the community. FUNDAEC's current program director is Bita Correa. Overview In 1974 FUNDAECFUNDAEC is different from FUNDESCU though there are many similarities. FUNDAEC is the Colombian NGO based on Bah√° º√≠ consultations with Colombians starting in the 1970s and developed a number of projects like a secondary curriculum centered on skill development for living in the countryside and minimized urbanization for example. FUNDESCU is an older (from the 1950s) NGO in Panama based on Bah√° º√≠ consultations with Panamanian Indians and developed a system of schools serving largely remote areas. An agricultural project was attempted in the 1990s and was in fact based on cooperation between the Panamanian and Colombian NGOs but was not successful. was founded by group of professors at the University of Valle. According to Gustavo Correa, director of FUNDAEC in 2002, it was originally inspired by a quotation from Bah√° ºu'll√°h - \\"Baha'u'llah talks about man as 'a mine rich in gems of inestimable value.' He says that 'education can, alone, cause it to reveal its treasures, and enable mankind to benefit therefrom'. Its founding ideals included: * Not seeing the people as masses of undernourished people, overwhelmed by problems and needs-housing, employment, sanitation, education, but instead to consider the participants of its programs as irreplaceable resources in a self- sustaining process of change. * The strong conviction that every human being possesses great potentialities that an appropriate educational process can help develop and channel towards service to the community and to society at large. * To analyze problems of poverty and social disintegration keeping an eye on the tendency to reduce people to an object of manipulation by either an unjust market or a deified state, to an insatiable pleasure seeking consumer of goods, or an untiring participant in power struggles. * An acceptance of two interacting aspects of human nature: the basic drive of material survival and the reality of man's spiritual nature, with infinite potentialities for qualities such as love, justice, and generosity. * Avoiding an unbalanced obsession with industrialization unattainable by and undesirable for the majority of humanity; not romantic conceptions of traditional untechnological societies of subsistence and peasant economies but a search for a scientifically and technologically modern society, which, however, would base its educational, economic, administrative, political, and cultural structures on the concept of the integral nature of man rather than his mere material needs. * The rural university would be a social space in which two systems of knowledge, a modern one (in all its sophistication) and a traditional one pertaining to the people of the region would interact in a healthy way to produce important development processes from within the rural population itself. * The Rural University would have to pursue its goals with the understanding that all the processes of rural life, production, simple construction and repair, marketing, the development of human resources, socialization, the flow of information, adaptation and the improvement of technologies, health care and sanitation, and decision‚Äìmaking are in need of structures that may connect them to the corresponding structures of the political, social, economic, and cultural life of an evolving global society. FUNDAEC was instituted as a private development foundation based in Cali, and has developed a number of development projects centered around a goal that rural populations should not only benefit from higher education, but should also actively participate in creating and generating knowledge and technologies, to improve their quality of life and standard of living. FUNDAEC sought to dispel the image of the poor farmer whose life must be planned and managed by more privileged members of society. Projects Projects of FUNDAEC began with the Centro Universitario de Bienestar Rural (CUBR), the \\"University Center for Rural Well-being\\" in 1980 to serve as a basis of expertise for development and review of programs and projects. In 1987, the \\"System for Tutorial Learning\\" (SAT, the Spanish acronym for \\"Sistema de Aprendizaje Tutorial\\") was established which has been used in 13 of the 32 Departments of Colombia by 1996. SAT has been credited, after wide implementation, with cutting the process of urbanization, increases in democratic behavior and aspects of gender equality, extra curricular activities in communities, stopping migratory movement of populations, and established public-private cooperation. The system has been replicated by request of the government and in 1996 was evaluated by the government of Honduras for use there. The curriculum is uniquely formulated for rural students, using a series of highly interactive workbooks, and trained tutors who are themselves from rural areas present the curriculum on a flexible schedule to meet the needs of rural students. The curriculum aims at the skills required for living in the countryside instead of abstract sciences but was developed from the ground up for the rural inhabitants. One way to become a tutor of the program is to graduate from its series of workbooks and start offering a class registered with the government. Since the focus stays in the community, the community becomes stronger. FUNDAEC has won the Change the World -- Best Practice Award for its SAT program from the Club of Budapest and characterized as ‚Äúthe best educatory project of the time‚Äù, according to Ernst Ulrich von Weizs√§cker. By 2002 the SAT system was in use in Honduras, Guatemala, Ecuador, Venezuela, Panama, Costa Rica, Brazil, Colombia and the first phases of the implementation of the program had started in Zambia. Parallel to the SAT project, FUNDAEC began a micro-finance initiative as well.

Berkley Books) Cover art by Paul DiCampli Fire in the Abyss is a science fiction novel by Stuart Gordon, pen name of Richard Gordon, (1983), having as its main character the Elizabethan adventurer Humphrey Gilbert, an actual historical figure, as a time traveler. The first section of the book is set in England and spans Gilbert‚Äôs youth to his fateful voyage to North America. These chapters are well researched and blend historical fact and fictitious events and individuals. Numerous, as well as humorous, notable individuals from 16th century England populate this section, including Nick Udall, headmaster of Eton College, and Thomas Cromwell, Henry VIII's chief minister who was beheaded. The arrogant and occasionally brutal Gilbert works his way up the social ladder of England‚Äôs hierarchical society until he secures the financial and political backing to launch two expeditions to North America, both of which are ultimate failures, the later a deadly disaster. The last which recorded history knows of Gilbert is that he and his ship the \\"Squirrel\\", were lost in a severe storm off Newfoundland in 1583. Since nobody ever saw or heard of him or his ship again, it is generally assumed that the ship went down with all hands, Gilbert included. Gordon's book, however, assumes that Gilbert did not drown but was transported through time to the 20th century, by a secret project of the United States Navy. A similar idea about Gilbert was taken up by another writer, Philip Jos√© Farmer. In Farmer's The Gate of Time (1966), Gilbert is not displaced forward in time but sidewise into an alternate timeline. Plot summary Gilbert awakens in 1983 floating in the north Atlantic when all of a sudden a U.S. submarine emerges from the depths and plucks him from certain death. (The book's cover shows Gilbert on the deck of a modern submarine.) Together with some hundred other \\"Temporally Displaced Persons,\\" or DTIs, the government term for those it‚Äôs kidnapped from other times, Gilbert is illegally incarcerated in a secret installation in Horsefield, New Jersey where authorities conduct experiments designed to extract historical and linguistic secrets from the past. Gilbert is forced to live a pathetic existence of living in a prison and must wear a protective suit just to prevent himself from being infected with deadly modern day viruses and bacteria. Just when hope seems to have run dry Gilbert discovers that he and the other DTIs have developed a telepathic ring, coordinated by the Ancient Egyptian priestess Tari, a follower of the cult of Isis. In this ring they are able to share their dreams, fears and plans for escape. Together with Tari, a Norse giant, a dancer from ancient North America and many others, Gilbert escapes from his illegal confines. This is a deadly plan as the US government is eager, even willing to kill, to keep the scandalous DTIs a secret from the public. Once on the outside Gilbert, Tari and a handful of others find themselves on-the-run and overwhelmed by culture shock. Dodging murderous government agents and curious laymen Gilbert wanders across the American continent, meeting up with crazed Irish nationalists, an anti- government rock group and even working for a time in a San Francisco S&M; parlor, indulging his homosexual desires. One by one Gilbert‚Äôs companions are killed off by accident or murder until he alone finally makes an escape back to England, where he again finds himself an outsider and fugitive. The book, written in the first person, is Gilbert's diary and is intended as proof of the government misdeeds committed against DTI‚Äôs. Gilbert makes many sardonic remarks on the life and institutions of the modern world in general and present-day Britain in particular, but also enjoys disabusing moderns who tend to romanticize the Elizabethan Age. Gordon is especially harsh in his mocking of the political paranoia that infected the United States during the Cold War. Gordon, a Scotsman, does manage to have Gilbert, an Englishman, visit the author‚Äôs home town of Buckie on the northeastern coast of Scotland.

Given a line l and a point P not on l, right- and left-limiting parallels to l through P converge to l at ideal points. Unlike the projective case, ideal points form a boundary, not a submanifold. So, these lines do not intersect at an ideal point and such points, although well defined, do not belong to the hyperbolic space itself. The ideal points together form the Cayley absolute or boundary of a hyperbolic geometry. For instance, the unit circle forms the Cayley absolute of the Poincar√© disk model and the Klein disk model. While the real line forms the Cayley absolute of the Poincar√© half-plane model . Pasch's axiom and the exterior angle theorem still hold for an omega triangle, defined by two points in hyperbolic space and an omega point. Properties * The hyperbolic distance between an ideal point and any other point or ideal point is infinite. * The centres of horocycles and horoballs are ideal points; two horocycles are concentric when they have the same centre. Polygons with ideal vertices =Ideal triangles= if all vertices of a triangle are ideal points the triangle is an ideal triangle. Ideal triangles have a number of interesting properties: * All ideal triangles are congruent. * The interior angles of an ideal triangle are all zero. * Any ideal triangle has an infinite perimeter. * Any ideal triangle has area \\\\pi / -K where K is the (negative) curvature of the plane. =Ideal quadrilaterals= if all vertices of a quadrilateral are ideal points the quadrilateral is an ideal quadrilateral. While all ideal triangles are congruent, not all quadrilaterals are, the diagonals can make different angles with each other resulting in noncongruent quadrilaterals having said this: * The interior angles of an ideal quadrilateral are all zero. * Any ideal quadrilateral has an infinite perimeter. * Any ideal (convex non intersecting) quadrilateral has area 2 \\\\pi / -K where K is the (negative) curvature of the plane. =Ideal square= The ideal quadrilateral where the two diagonals are perpendicular to each other form an ideal square. It was use by Ferdinand Karl Schweikart in his memorandum on what he called \\"astral geometry\\", one of the first publications acknowledging the possibility of hyperbolic geometry. =Ideal n-gons= An ideal n-gon can be subdivided into ideal triangles, with area times the area of an ideal triangle. Representations in models of hyperbolic geometry In the Klein disk model and the Poincar√© disk model of the hyperbolic plane. In both disk models the ideal points are on the unit circle (hyperbolic plane) or unit sphere (higher dimensions) which is the unreachable boundary of the hyperbolic plane. When projecting the same hyperbolic line to the Klein disk model and the Poincar√© disk model both lines go through the same two ideal points.(the ideal points in both models are on the same spot). =Klein disk model = Given two distinct points p and q in the open unit disk the unique straight line connecting them intersects the unit circle in two ideal points, a and b, labeled so that the points are, in order, a, p, q, b so that aq > ap and pb > qb. Then the hyperbolic distance between p and q is expressed as :d(p,q) = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\log \\\\frac{ \\\\left qa \\\\right \\\\left bp \\\\right }{ \\\\left pa \\\\right \\\\left bq \\\\right } , = Poincar√© disk model = Given two distinct points p and q in the open unit disk then the unique circle arc orthogonal to the boundary connecting them intersects the unit circle in two ideal points, a and b, labeled so that the points are, in order, a, p, q, b so that aq > ap and pb > qb. Then the hyperbolic distance between p and q is expressed as :d(p,q) = \\\\log \\\\frac{ \\\\left qa \\\\right \\\\left bp \\\\right }{ \\\\left pa \\\\right \\\\left bq \\\\right } , Where the distances are measured along the (straight line) segments aq, ap, pb and qb. =Poincar√© half-plane model= In the Poincar√© half-plane model the ideal points are the points on the boundary axis. There is also another ideal point that is not represented in the half-plane model (but rays parallel to the positive y-axis approach it). =Hyperboloid model= In the hyperboloid model there are no ideal points.

Freston Tower is a six-storey red brick folly south of Ipswich, Suffolk in the village of Freston. It stands on the banks of the River Orwell. History = Construction date = Arguably the oldest folly in England, the tower has various claims for construction dates, ranging from the 15th to 17th centuries. There is a legend that the tower was built by \\"Lord de Freston\\" in the 15th century for his daughter Ellen, so she could study a different subject on a different floor six days of the week: the 1st floor was dedicated to reception, the 2nd to tapestry working, the 3rd to music, the 4th to painting, the 5th to literature and the 6th to astronomy, complete with instruments for taking observations. This was written about in a novel by Reverend Richard Cobbold entitled Freston Tower and so should not be taken as fact. There is much evidence against this legend, in fact, (documents referring to the construction of the tower within the twelve years preceding 1569) and it is likely that the tower was constructed by Edmond Latymer as a lookout over Freston Reach of the River Orwell. There are further descriptions suggesting a construction date of 1655. Landmark Trust, a historical building preservation charity and the current owner of Freston Tower, suggests the tower \\"was built in 1578 by a wealthy Ipswich merchant called Thomas Gooding\\". = Uses = By 1730, the tower was available to let, complete with furniture. Between 1772 and 1779, Freston Tower was used for small-pox patients under inoculation. Modern use Most recently owned by Claire Hunt until 1999, Freston Tower was donated to the current owner Landmark Trust, a charity that rescues and restores historical buildings. As of 2004, the tower became available to let as a holiday home.

He was one of the regents of the city itself when Pope Paschal II left in 1108 to deal with raising troops. \\"Rome remained the pit of daily rebellion,\\" as Gregorovius says. In 1111, Pierleone negotiated the imperial coronation of the Emperor Henry V. Ever a faithful ally of the pope, in 1117, he retook Rome for him, but was subsequently holed up in his tower by Ptolemy I of Tusculum. After the election of Bishop John of Gaeta as Gelasius II on 24 January 1118, the new pope was thrown into prison by Cencio II Frangipane. It was Pierleone, with his son Peter, Peter the prefect of the city, and the papal gonfalonier Stephen the Norman, who restored the pope's freedom. Pierleone held the Theatre of Marcellus, Tiber Island, and the Castel Sant'Angelo, fortress of the popes. He was the greatest man in Rome in his time, the grandson of a Jew of Trastevere. His large marble sarcophagus is preserved in the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls. Its inscription reads, \\"a man without an equal, immeasurably rich in money and children.\\" Of these children, he left several sons: Leo, Peter (later Antipope Anacletus II), Jordan (later Patrician of the Commune of Rome), Roger, and Huguizon.

It is also referred to as problem-based learning, experiential learning and 21st century learning. It is supported by the work of learning theorists and psychologists Jean Piaget, Jerome Bruner, and Seymour Papert. Jerome Bruner is often credited with originating discovery learning in the 1960s, but his ideas are very similar to those of earlier writers such as John Dewey.(Monroe, 1911) Bruner argues that \\"Practice in discovering for oneself teaches one to acquire information in a way that makes that information more readily viable in problem solving\\".(Bruner, 1961, p. 26) This philosophy later became the discovery learning movement of the 1960s. The mantra of this philosophical movement suggests that people should \\"learn by doing\\". The label of discovery learning can cover a variety of instructional techniques. According to a meta-analytic review conducted by Alfieri, Brooks, Aldrich, and Tenenbaum (2011), a discovery learning task can range from implicit pattern detection, to the elicitation of explanations and working through manuals to conducting simulations. Discovery learning can occur whenever the student is not provided with an exact answer but rather the materials in order to find the answer themselves. Discovery learning takes place in problem solving situations where the learner draws on his own experience and prior knowledge and is a method of instruction through which students interact with their environment by exploring and manipulating objects, wrestling with questions and controversies, or performing experiments. Characteristics Discovery-based learning is typically characterized by having minimal teacher guidance, fewer teacher explanations, solving problems with multiple solutions, use of hand-on materials, minimal repetition and memorization.(Stokke, 2015) There are multiple essential components that are required for successful discovery-based learning(Dorier & Garcia, 2013) which include the following: *Teacher guidance where the emphasis is on building upon students‚Äô reasoning and connecting to their experiences *Classroom culture where there is a shared sense of purpose between teacher and students, where open-mindedness and dialogue are encouraged *Students are encouraged to ask questions, inquire through exploration and collaborate with teacher and peers Teacher's role It has been suggested that effective teaching using discovery techniques requires teachers to do one or more of the following: 1) Provide guided tasks leveraging a variety of instructional techniques 2) Students should explain their own ideas and teachers should assess the accuracy of the idea and provide feedback 3) Teachers should provide examples of how to complete the tasks.(Alfieri, Brooks, Aldrich, & Tenenbaum, 2011) A critical success factor to discovery learning is that it must be teacher assisted. Bruner (1961), one of the early pioneers of discovery learning, cautioned that discovery could not happen without some basic knowledge. Mayer (2004) argued that pure unassisted discovery should be eliminated due to the lack of evidence that it improves learning outcomes. Discovery learning can also result in students becoming confused and frustrated.(Kirschner, Sweller & Clark, 2006) The teachers‚Äô role in discovery learning is therefore critical to the success of learning outcomes. Students must build foundational knowledge through examples, practice and feedback. This can provide a foundation for students to integrate additional information and build upon problem solving and critical thinking skills. Benefits Early research demonstrated that directed discovery had positive effects on retention of information at six weeks after instruction versus that of traditional direct instruction.(Ray, 1961) It is believed that the outcome of discovery based learning is the development of inquiring minds and the potential for life-long learning. Discovery learning promotes student exploration and collaboration with teachers and peers to solve problems. Children are also able to direct their own inquiry and be actively involved in the learning process which helps with student motivation.(Carroll & Beman, 2015) Assisted vs. unassisted discovery A debate in the instructional community now questions the effectiveness of this model of instruction.(Kirschner, Sweller, & Clark, 2006) The debate dates back to the 1950s when researchers first began to compare the results of discovery learning to other forms of instruction. In support of the fundamental concept of discovery learning, Bruner (1961) suggested that students are more likely to remember concepts if they discover them on their own as opposed to those that are taught directly. In pure discovery learning, the learner is required to discover new content through conducting investigations or carrying out procedures while receiving little, if any, assistance. \\"For example, a science teacher might provide students with a brief demonstration of how perceptions of color change depending on the intensity of the light source and then ask them to design their own experiment to further examine this relationship\\".(Marzano, 2011, p. 86) In this example the student is left to discover the content on his/her own. Because students are left to self- discovery of topics, researchers worry that learning taking place may have errors, misconceptions or be confusing or frustrating to the learner.(Alfieri et al., 2011) Research shows that cognitive demands required for discovery in young children may hinder learning as they have limited amounts of existing knowledge to integrate additional information. Bruner also cautioned that such discovery could not be made prior to or without at least some base of knowledge in the topic. Students who are presented with problems without foundational knowledge may not have the ability to work though solutions.(Kirscher, Sweller & Clark, 2006) The meta-analyses conducted by Alfieri and colleagues reconfirmed such findings. Mayer (2004) argues that unassisted discovery learning tasks do not help learners discover problem- solving rules, conservation strategies, or programming concepts. He does acknowledge, however that while under some circumstances constructivist-based approaches may be beneficial, pure discovery learning lacks structure in nature and hence will not be beneficial for the learner. Mayer also points out that interest in discovery learning has waxed and waned since the 1960s. He argues that in each case the empirical literature has shown that the use of pure discovery methods is not suggested, yet time and time again researchers have renamed their instructional methods only to be discredited again, to rename their movement again. Alternatively, direct ‚Äòinstruction where working examples, scaffolding techniques, explicit explanation and feedback are beneficial to learning (Alfieri, 2011). In addition, time spent practising newly learned concepts improves problem solving skills (Pas and Van Gog, 2006). There appears to be benefits to both direct instruction and assisted discovery. Perhaps finding the balance between the two instructional styles will lead to the best learning outcomes for students. In special needs education With the push for special needs students to take part in the general education curriculum, prominent researchers in this field doubt if general education classes rooted in discovery based learning can provide an adequate learning environment for special needs students. Kauffman has related his concerns over the use of discovery based learning as opposed to direct instruction. Kauffman comments, to be highly successful in learning the facts and skills they need, these facts and skills are taught directly rather than indirectly. That is the teacher is in control of instruction, not the student, and information is given to students (2002). This view is exceptionally strong when focusing on students with math disabilities and math instruction. Fuchs et al. (2008) comment, > Typically developing students profit from the general education mathematics > program, which relies, at least in part, on a constructivist, inductive > instructional style. Students who accrue serious mathematics deficits, > however, fail to profit from those programs in a way that produces > understanding of the structure, meaning, and operational requirements of > mathematics ... Effective intervention for students with a math disability > requires an explicit, didactic form of instruction ... Fuchs et al. go on to note that explicit or direct instruction should be followed up with instruction that anticipates misunderstanding and counters it with precise explanations. However, few studies focus on the long-term results for direct instruction. Long-term studies may find that direct instruction is not superior to other instructional methods. For instance, a study found that in a group of fourth graders that were instructed for 10 weeks and measured for 17 weeks direct instruction did not lead to any stronger results in the long term than did practice alone.(Dean & Kuhn, 2006) Other researchers note that there is promising work being done in the field to incorporate constructivism and cooperative grouping so that curriculum and pedagogy can meet the needs of diverse learners in an inclusion setting.(Brantlinger, 1997) However, it is questionable how successful these developed strategies are for student outcomes both initially and in the long term. Effects on cognitive load Research has been conducted over years(Mayer, 2001; Paas, Renkl, & Sweller, 1999, 2004; Winn, 2003) to prove the unfavorable effects of discovery learning, specifically with beginning learners. \\"Cognitive load theory suggests that the free exploration of a highly complex environment may generate a heavy working memory load that is detrimental to learning\\".(Kirschner, Sweller, Clark, 2006) Beginning learners do not have the necessary skills to integrate the new information with information they have learned in the past. Sweller reported that a better alternative to discovery learning was guided instruction. According to Kirschner, Sweller and Clark (2006), guided instruction produces more immediate recall of facts than unguided approaches along with longer term transfer and problem-solving skills. Enhanced discovery learning Robert J. Marzano (2011) describes enhanced discovery learning as a process that involves preparing the learner for the discovery learning task by providing the necessary knowledge needed to successfully complete said task. In this approach, the teacher not only provides the necessary knowledge required to complete the task, but also provides assistance during the task. This preparation of the learner and assistance may require some direct instruction. \\"For example, before asking students to consider how best to stretch the hamstring muscle in cold weather, the teacher might present a series of lessons that clarify basic facts about muscles and their reaction to changes in temperature\\".(Marzano, 2011, p. 87) Another aspect of enhanced discovery learning is allowing the learner to generate ideas about a topic along the way and then having students explain their thinking.(Marzano, 2011) A teacher who asks the students to generate their own strategy for solving a problem may be provided with examples in how to solve similar problems ahead of the discovery learning task. \\"A student might come up to the front of the room to work through the first problem, sharing his or her thinking out loud. The teacher might question students and help them formulate their thinking into general guidelines for estimation, such as \\"start by estimating the sum of the highest place-value numbers\\". As others come to the front of the room to work their way through problems out loud, students can generate and test more rules\\". Further reading  * Bolton, David and Goodey, Noel.

Laserfiche sells its software through value-added resellers distributed throughout the world. History Nien-Ling Wacker founded Compulink Management Center Inc., a custom software development company, in 1974. By the early 1980s, Wacker had identified an emerging need among her clients for an electronic document repository that would provide both secure storage and instant retrieval by any word or phrase in the document. The concept for a PC-based document management system began in 1981 when a client, a large Japanese auto manufacturer, required litigation support for a large volume of documents. At the time, paralegals had to wade through thousands of pages of depositions, entering keywords into a database. Attorneys were limited to searching on keywords to find relevant testimony. Nien-Ling Wacker realized that if a full-text index of every page were available, the search capabilities would be greatly enhanced, and the amount of physical labor required to index the documents would decrease substantially. With the release of WORM drives that cost \\"only\\" $200 for 200MB of diskspace, the conceived system could be made cost effective. The first version of Laserfiche was released in 1987, becoming the first DOS-based document imaging system in the world. The system used commercial off-the-shelf components such as OCR boards from Kurzweil, graphics monitors from Cornerstone, and scanner interface boards by Kofax. =Timeline= In 1993 Laserfiche released the first PC-based client‚Äìserver document imaging system, based on the NetWare Loadable Modules platform. In 2002, Laserfiche 6 marked the company's first foray into MSSQL-based document management. That year, the company also introduced Quick Fields, an automated document processing module, and WebLink, which provided read-only, Web-based access to documents stored in Laserfiche. In 2004, Laserfiche 7 marked the company's first offering for Oracle users. In early 2008, the company released Laserfiche 8, with a re- written workflow engine and integration with Microsoft SharePoint. In August 2008, the company launched Laserfiche Rio, an enterprise content management offering with unlimited servers, named user licensing and bundled functionality including content management, business process management and a thin-client interface called Web Access. In 2009, Laserfiche opened an international office in Hong Kong, creating a separate company Laserfiche International. In 2010, Laserfiche filed a lawsuit against SAP for trademark infringement over the disputed trademark phrase \\"Run Smarter\\". In 2011, Laserfiche announced that the litigation had been settled amicably and involved a license of the ‚ÄúRun Smarter‚Äù trademark. In 2011, Laserfiche released Laserfiche Mobile for iPhone, an app that allows users to capture images with the phone's built-in camera, store them in the Laserfiche repository and include them in digital workflows. Later that year, Laserfiche was listed as a Champion in Info-Tech Research Group's Enterprise Content Management (ECM) for Process Workers Vendor Landscape. According to Info-Tech, ‚ÄúLaserfiche is a stalwart that is exploiting the new capabilities of emerging technology. In 2012, Laserfiche released Laserfiche Mobile for iPad, an app that extends governance, risk and compliance standards to the iPad. Laserfiche said it was profitable since 1994, growing at what Wacker describes as a managed pace. In 2019, Laserfiche announced its integration with Microsoft Office 365, which allows customers to edit Microsoft Office documents directly on the web. Products Laserfiche has two main product lines: Laserfiche Rio and Laserfiche Avante. Laserfiche Rio is designed to meet the needs of large organizations that have more than 100 users.

Langosteira beach. Fisterra (; ) is a municipality in the province of A Coru√±a, in the autonomous community of Galicia, Spain. It belongs to the comarca of Fisterra. Fisterra is on Cape Finisterre, the final destination for many pilgrims on the Way of St. James. Fisterra is on the rocky Costa da Morte (Galician: \\"Coast of Death\\"), named because of the large number of shipwrecks along these shores. The name Fisterra comes from Latin FINIS TERRAE, meaning \\"Land's End\\". This name stems from the fact that this area is on a remote peninsula that is one of the westernmost points of land in Galicia, and hence in Spain. Fisterra is an ancient port and fishing village, formed by narrow streets leading to the Plaza de Ara Solis. The chapel of Nosa Se√±ora do Bon Suceso, dating from the 18th century, is on the plaza. There is a lighthouse on a 600-metre promontory called \\"Monte Facho\\" at the tip of Cape Finisterre overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. On the road up to the lighthouse is the parish church of Santa Mar√≠a de Fisterra which contains the Chapel of Santo Cristo. Fisterra is 108 km from A Coru√±a, and 98 km from Santiago de Compostela. Lighthouse. Geography Fisterra has several beaches like O Rostro, Arnela, Mar de F√≥ra, Langosteira, Ribeira, and Corveiro. Many of the beaches are framed by steep cliffs leading down to the \\"Mare Tenebrosum\\" (or dark sea, the name of the Atlantic in the Middle Ages). There are several rocks in this area associated with religious legends, such as the \\"holy stones\\", the \\"stained wine stones\\", the \\"stone chair\\", and the tomb of Orcabella.Orcabella is a Celtic goddess that takes the form of a hag and has a prodigious sexual appetite. Humans cannot hurt Orcabella; they only see her or feel her. Orcabella has many features that are similar to the Irish crone- goddess, Cailleach Bh√©irre (LA MITOLOG√çA Y EL FOLKLORE DE GALICIA Y LAS REGIONES C√âLTICAS DEL NOROESTE EUROPEO ATL√ÅNTICO , Manuel Alberro, Inst. of Cornish Studies, University of Exeter) History After the discovery of the remains of St. James, pilgrims on the Way of St. James started to arrive from Santiago to Fisterra to worship in front of an image of Sacred Christ, view the relics of San Guillerme, and see the \\"End of the Earth\\". In 1479, a hospital to accommodate the arriving pilgrims was built. Many of the pilgrims were noblemen or otherwise famous. Thousands of visitors continue to arrive in Fisterra every day. Pre-Christian beliefs In the area there are many remnants of pre-Christian beliefs and sacred locations. On Cape Finisterre, some claim that there is the \\"Altar Soli\\", where the Celts engaged in sun worship and assorted rituals. The Monte Facho, on Cape Finisterre, was the place where the Celtic Nerios from Duio carried out their offerings and rites in honour of the sun. St. William of Gellone also lived in a house located there. Near St. William's house, sterile couples would have sexual intercourse on one specific stone to try to conceive, following a Celtic rite of fertility.

A brief history The fishery has always been for both whitefish and herring. The Norsemen came to Scotland from the 9th to 11th centuries and settled in the Northern Isles, Western Isles and on the mainland. They had fish as a large part of their diet, and excavations of Viking sites in Orkney and Shetland have found middens (kitchen waste areas) containing large quantities of fish bones. These bones were mainly of cod, saithe and ling but herring, haddock and whiting bones were also found. They used the line fishing method with hooks and bait. A fleet of Dutch herring busses, c. 1700, escorted by a naval vessel The Dutch had a near monopoly of the herring fishing from the 15th to the 17th centuries. The boats, called busses, were very large. They lay overnight with the drift nets set to catch the herring and were hauled by hand in the morning. The herring were salted and placed in barrels. These barrels were then transferred to small boats called jagers, which were tenders to the busses. These boats took the fish to the markets. The 18th century saw some Scottish fishermen emulate this Dutch method of fishing. In 1718, the government introduced the bounty system to promote large scale fishing. This meant that the government paid a bounty to the boat owner based on the tonnage of the vessel and would also pay a bounty to anyone for simply building a fishing boat. This continued until 1820 and did much to encourage the growth of the fishery. The fishery was valuable and the fleets often came under attack from French and Spanish privateers. Because of this, armed ships were employed to accompany and defend the fishing boats. Despite this, the Dutch style of fishing didn't produce the results the government wanted. The bulk of the Scottish fishery was still using the line and bait method in inshore waters. However, in 1785 the government instituted barrel bounties, which meant that the bounties were payable based on the amount of cured herring produced. This encouraged the herring curers to enter into contracts with the fishermen whereby they would be guaranteed a price for their catch. The 19th century saw the greatest growth in sea fishing on the Scottish east coast. In the early years of that century the boats were very small, made of wood and were either one or two masted. They were not expensive to build and small repairs were carried out by the fishermen themselves. These early boats needed to be light so they could be dragged up the beaches. The fishermen did not venture far from the shore, as these boats were undecked and unstable under stormy conditions. In 1848, a violent storm hit the country and 124 boats were sunk, and 100 fishermen lost their lives. The government appointed Captain John Washington to enquire into the disaster and to make recommendations (the Washington Report). He pointed out that the boats were too small and being without decks prone to water inundation. However, not all of the fishermen were happy about larger decked boats. They felt that heavier boats would be harder to row and decks would make it easier for men to be washed overboard. Also beaching the boats would be impossible. But a good many fishermen took a contrary view and felt that the decked boats was a good idea. They realised that the boats could fish further from the shore and would be better in storm conditions. Larger boats could hold more fish and so profits would be greater. The first decked boat was built in Eyemouth in 1856 and this soon became the norm for the Scottish fishing fleet. These sail boats were of three main types: Skaffies, Fifies and Zulus. Common to all three types were the lug sails, which may have given rise to their name - luggers. The need for the larger boats spurred on the building of harbours all along the east coast, in the 1850s and 1860s. This heralded an enormous change in the size of the herring fishery. Initially, the market for the pickled herring was Ireland and the West Indies where it was fed to slaves. The market received a setback in the 1830s following the ending of slavery on British-owned plantations and, from 1845 to 1851 when the Great Irish Famine forced a mass emigration from Ireland. However, improvements in curing techniques produced a superior product and soon meant that new markets opened up in Russia and the Baltic countries. The fishermen, with the support of the curers, invested in larger boats and additional nets. The fleet grew quickly but was still could only fish for herring during the two months when the fish were off the Scottish east coast. By 1880, there were around 7,000 Scottish boats involved in herring fishing so the fishing season needed to be extended. This led to a migration of a sizeable number of boats and curers to the west coast in May and June. By 1880, the numbers of boats fishing the west coast numbered more than 1,000. In the 1860s, Scottish boats were also to be found in East Anglian waters for the Autumn fishing. Initially, Scottish curers were not present in any great numbers in this fishery but by the end of the 19th century large numbers were represented in Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft. By this time, the Scottish fleet actually outnumbered the local one. The curers soon turned their attention to Shetland for the early summer fishing causing the local Shetland fishermen to adopt the drift net and larger boats. By the early 20th century, more than 1,800 boats fished the Shetland waters. In 1884 the herring industry faced a crisis. The curers wanted an end to the contract system because they could not balance quantity and costs with market conditions and so wanted a move to an auction process. Fishermen wanted the status quo but reluctantly agreed and from 1887 the herring were auctioned. The peak of the herring fishery industry and also its main decline came between 1900 and the First World War. Steam-powered fishing boats appeared towards the end of the 19th century and it was steam drifters that would take the volume of the catch to new heights. The powered winches allowed longer nets to be deployed and their speed enabled the boats to get to market quickly and to return to sea. In those early years of the 20th century, the Scottish catch reached 2 million barrels annually. Before the First World War, Germany and Russia were the main market for British herring. After the war, however, Germany was racked by inflation and was impoverished. Russia underwent the 1917 Revolution and civil war. Other European countries started to compete strongly with the British fleets and for twenty years the industry went into a steep decline. The beginnings of the seine net fishing began in Scotland in 1921 but the use of the large inefficient steam boats greatly hindered this new whitefish fishery. After the Second World War, the Scottish east coast fleet, with government assistance, was totally regenerated becoming mainly a whitefish industry. This in turn declined in the 1970s and 1980s due to overfishing and the subsequent imposition of quotas by the European Union. The herring industry continued to shrink. From the 1960s, trawling and purse-netting were the main methods of pelagic fishing, which not only includes herring but also mackerel. Although a quota is placed on the total herring catch and with no limit on mackerel, this sector is now the healthiest in the Scottish fleet. Fishing boat development =The Scandinavian influence= Viking boat showing clinker planking The Norsemen were skilled seamen and boat builders and their boat designs depended on their needs. Trading vessels were wide, to allow large cargo storage, while raiding boats were long and narrow and very fast. They all used the clinker fashion of planking, i.e. the planks overlapped one another. The boats used for fishing were scaled-down versions of their cargo boats. The Scandinavian influence affected boat building long after the Viking period came to an end. Yoles from the Orkney Island of Stroma were built in the same way as the Norse boats. Early Scottish boat builders copied the Scandinavian designs with their clinker planking and characteristic sharp stems and sterns. =The Skaffie= From the beginning of the 19th century a class of boat called the Skaffie appeared. These were favoured mainly in the Moray Firth region. The early skaffie boats were small with rounded stems and raked sterns. They were two-masted with a tall dipping lugsail and a mizzen sail. Their short keel gave them good manoeuvrability in good weather, but they tended to be unstable in bad weather. They were usually crewed by around six people. Above all, though, they were light enough to be hauled up on to the beaches. The boats were un-decked and provided no shelter for the crew. Because of the vulnerability of the boats, they stayed only a few miles out to sea in full view of the land. These boats were gradually built bigger and could be around long, and partially decked. This came about because the harbours that were constructed from the mid to late19th century meant that the boats no longer needed to be beached. Skaffies were not built in any great numbers after 1900. =The Fifie= Fifie sail drifter - Reaper The \\"Fifie\\" then became the predominant fishing boat on the Scottish east coast. They were used from the 1850s until well into the 20th century. Fifies had a vertical stem and stern with a broad beam, which made them very stable. Their long keel was a disadvantage, especially manoeuvring in confined spaces. These boats were two masted with a main dipping lugsail and a mizzen sail. The masts were set quite far forward and aft to release a good working space. Fifies built from 1860 onwards were all decked, and from the 1870s onwards the bigger boats were built with carvel planking, i.e. the planks were laid edge-to-edge instead of the overlapping clinker style of previous boats. Some boats were now being built up to about in length and were very fast. =The Zulu= A Zulu at Catterline. In 1879, Lossiemouth fisherman, William \\"Dad\\" Campbell came up with a radical design for his new boat. It had the vertical stem of the Fifie and the steeply raked stern of the Skaffie, and he called this boat Nonesuch, registration number INS 2118. She was relatively small, overall with a . The Nonesuch had her registration closed on 12 January 1901 after having been broken up. The Zulu War raging in South Africa at the time gave the name to this new class of boat. The Zulu boats were built to the carvel method of planking. The shape of the Zulus gave the boats a long deck but a shorter keel, which greatly improved their manoeuvrability. Zulus were two-masted boats and carried three sails - a dipping lug fore, a standing lug mizzen and a jib. The sails were very heavy and difficult to haul, and the masts had to be very long and strong. Masts could be tall on boats of in length. Their design produced very fast boats that became invaluable to herring fishing fleets. They got to the fishing grounds quickly and returned swiftly with the catch. Because of these qualities, the Zulus rapidly became very popular along the entire east coast. As the 20th century approached, steam capstans were introduced, and this made the hauling of the sails and nets much easier for the crews. One of the best of those was the capstans patented and built by MacDonald Brothers of Portsoy, in 1908. =The steam boat= The earliest steam powered fishing boats first appeared in the 1890s and used the trawl system of fishing as well as lines and drift nets. These were large boats, usually in length with a beam of around . They weighed 40-50 tons and travelled at . The first steam boats were made of wood, but steel hulls were soon introduced and were divided into watertight compartments. They were well designed for the crew with a large building that contained the wheelhouse and the deckhouse. The boats built in the 20th century only had a mizzen sail, which was used to help steady the boat when its nets were out. The main function of the mast was now as a crane for lifting the catch ashore. They also had a steam capstan on the foredeck near the mast for hauling nets. The boats had narrow, high funnels so that the steam and thick coal smoke was released high above the deck and away from the fishermen. These funnels were nicknamed woodbines because they looked like the popular brand of cigarette. These boats had a crew of twelve made up of a skipper, driver, fireman (to look after the boiler) and nine deck hands. The earliest purpose built fishing vessels were designed and made by David Allan (Born 1840 Orkney)In Leith in March 1875, he converted a drifter to steam power.In 1877 it is said that he built the first screw propelled steam trawler in the world. This vessel was Pioneer LH854.She was of wooden construction with two masts and carried a gaff rigged main and mizen using booms, and a single foresail. Pioneer is mentioned in the Shetland Times of 4 May 1877. In 1878 he completed three steam-powered trawlers: Forward for Methven of Leith and Onward for Sharp and Murray of Cellardyke. In an interview with the Scotsman Mr. Allan stated that his motivation for auxiliary power was to increase the safety of fishermen. However local fishermen saw power trawling as a threat, remember that local boats of this period were or so, Mr. Allan's largest were . Some landowners questioned the sustainability of fish stocks to power trawlers. The Lammas Drive of 1878 states\\" It was reported that D. Allan of Granton had built two steam drifters the Forward and the Onward. The latter was unable to get a Celardyke crew so she fished from Aberdeen.\\" During this time Mr. Allan was also skippering the boats to ensure that they were successful in their catches. In total he built ten boats at Leith between 1877 and 1881. Twenty- one boats were completed at Granton, his last vessel being Degrave in 1886. Because of the prejudices mentioned, most of these were sold to foreign owners, France, Belgium, Spain and the West Indies amongst them. A full, complete account of his ventures can be found on Grantontrawlers.com. David Allan was buried on Christmas Day in South Shields in 1911. On page 14 of the Daily Mirror of 27 December 1911 there is a photograph and a line drawing of Onward. It reads \\"The death was announced in South Shields of Mr David Allan, the founder of the steam fishing industry. In 1877 he designed and built the steam Drifter Onward especially for fishing purposes. He afterwards commanded and worked the vessel himself.\\" Steam fishing boats had many advantages. They were usually about than the sailing vessels so they could carry more nets and catch more fish. This was important, as the market was growing quickly at the beginning of the 20th century. They could travel faster and further and with greater freedom from weather, wind and tide. Because less time was spent travelling to and from the fishing grounds, more time could be spent fishing. The steam boats also gained the highest prices for their fish, as they could return quickly to harbour with their fresh catch. The main disadvantage of the steam boats, though, was their high operating costs. Their engines were mechanically inefficient and took up much space, while fuel and fitting out costs were very high. Before the First World War, building costs were between ¬£3,000 and ¬£4,000, at least three times the cost of the sail boats. To cover these high costs, they needed to fish for longer seasons. The higher expenses meant that more steam drifters were company-owned or jointly owned. As the herring fishing industry declined, steam boats became too expensive. =The seine netter= Seine Netter Petrol and paraffin engines began to be used in 1906. At first, they were mainly fitted to smaller boats of between in length, and they provided auxiliary power to assist the sails. However, as diesel engines became more powerful, the sails were replaced altogether, and the engines were fitted in larger and larger boats. Motor engines were relatively cheap, making them affordable to individual Fishermen. Early engines cost less than ¬£100, and fuel costs were low. These boats also needed less maintenance than steam vessels. The two most popular engine brands were the Gardiner and Kelvin engines. The compact engines meant they could be fitted to existing sailing drifters such as Fifies and Zulus. The traditional Fifie style was better suited to the installation of a motor, which led to the custom building of a number of modified Fifie design boats with motors. In 1920, though, the government changed the rules by removing the guaranteed price for the herring and prices dropped dramatically. In 1921, some Lossiemouth skippers noticed that the Danish seine net boats were landing huge quantities of plaice and other white fish at the English east coast ports. Their interest resulted in a few buying some seine nets and winches and trying this form of fishing. As they perfected seine net fishing, more of the Lossiemouth fleet converted to seine net. But boat design for this type of fishing was still proving to be an obstacle. That, and the cost of the majority steam boats prompted a new style of fishing boat. John Campbell, nephew of William Campbell who designed the first Zulu boat built a wooden boat that resembled, to some extent, the \\"Fifie\\" but had a broad beam. His boat, the Marigold, did very well and over a relatively short period the entire Lossiemouth fleet (the first in Scotland) converted to the seine net. Other east coast ports followed on very quickly. =The trawler= Today, trawl fishing is the main industrial method of catching white fish. These trawlers can catch and store massive amounts of fish. They possess highly sensitive electronic equipment and remove the chance element from fishing. They operate by trawling the nets along the sea bed where the kind of fish they want to catch are located. = Modern fishing methods = =Fishing for demersal species (fish occurring near the seabed)= Bottom trawling ‚Äì single boat trawl net Method of towing This the commonest of the towed fishing gear; it is also known as \\"otter trawling\\". Trawl nets are shaped like a funnel with the sides extended ahead to guide the fish into the net. Otter boards (sometimes called \\"doors\\") spread the towing wires and keep the net open horizontally. The mouth of the net is held open vertically by the use of floats attached to the headline, while weight distributed along the ground rope allows the net to make good contact with the sea floor. The otter boards would scrape along the seabed making noises that attract fish. The fish would congregate between the boards keeping up with them until they tired and the net would then overtake them. This method is used mainly to catch the demersal species such as cod, haddock, whiting and flatfish. The boats themselves can be less than 10 metres in length for inshore fishing to 60 metres or more for deep sea fishing. With the decline in the volumes of roundfish, the growth in fishing for high-priced species such as monkfish and flatfish is being seen. In this case, scraper trawls are used. The nets are shaped differently with a lower headline, longer wings allowing a greater area to be swept. Bottom trawling ‚Äì two boats In pair trawling, each boat has a wire fastened to the net. Because of this, otterboards are not required to hold the mouth of the net open, as the boats maintain at their maximum a distance apart of around . The boats, because they share the load, can be smaller and less powerful yet can tow relatively large gear. These boats can be anything from 15 to 30 metres in length and have a typical combined power of . Again, this form of fishing is mainly for demersal species. Seine netting Scottish seine method Scottish seining, sometimes called fly dragging, has the net attached to two long ropes usually made of leaded polypropylene and around 3 km in length. The net is deployed in a triangular fashion with the first rope attached to a marker buoy, the dhan, to which the boat returns to complete the set. Both ropes are then winched in as the boat steams ahead slowly. Winch speed is gradually increased as the net gets closer to keep the net moving forward and also to herd the fish into the net. Like the trawl, floats and weighted footrope keep the mouth of the net open and in contact with the seabed. This method of fishing takes place on grounds on the continental shelf and not in deep sea. Seine netting is for all forms of whitefish. Twin beam trawling The beam trawl is one where a beam, up to 12 metres in length, is attached to a skid at each end. The beam is situated on top of the skids effectively keeping the top of the net open and the fish are channelled between the skids. Two beam trawls are deployed alongside each other from outrigger booms on each side of the boat. This method is primarily for taking flatfish but these vessels can be used also for scallop dredging. Twin rig trawl This method is to use two trawls side by side. Three wires attach to this combination. Instead of having individual wires connected to each of the nets sides, a common wire attaches to the two inner sides and the outer sides of each net are wired individually. Again otter boards allow the net mouths to spread apart horizontally while floats and ground ropes provide the vertical forces. This gear is usually used for catching target fish such as monkfish, flatfish and nephrops. = Line fishing = Line fishing used no nets. Line fishing boats harnessed a single line, up to a kilometre long, that was trailed behind the vessel. At intervals along that line drop lines were suspended at the end of which was tied a large hook onto which bait was hung. Halibut, cod, haddock, lemon sole, ling and skate were the predominant prey. The line would be released and reeled in using winches. The largest line fishing boat in the Scottish fleet was the Radiation which sailed out of Aberdeen and which predominantly fished Icelandic and Faroe Isles' waters. =Fishing for pelagic species (fish occurring in mid and upper water)= Pelagic gears are designed to catch species such as herring, mackerel, scad, blue whiting and sprats. However pelagic fishing from boats from the Scottish east coast ports normally catch herring and an amount of blue whiting from the northern North Sea. Methods *Single boat pelagic trawl ‚Äì similar to the demersal trawl but the gear is generally lighter, as it does not have to cope with dragging across the seabed. *Pelagic pair trawling ‚Äì operate in a similar method to the demersal pair trawl and again with lighter gear.

It is based upon the 1997 novel Mistress of Spices by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni. The film stars Aishwarya Rai. The soundtrack was created by Craig Pruess, who also contributed to the Bend It Like Beckham soundtrack. Plot Tilo (Aishwarya Rai), an immigrant from India, is a shopkeeper, an unusually strong clairvoyant, and a chosen Mistress of Spices. The Spices she gives to her customers help them to satisfy their certain needs and desires, such as \\"sandalwood to dispel painful memories; black cumin seed to protect against evil eye.\\" As a young girl, Tilo was initiated as one of several young Mistresses of Spices by the First Mother (Zohra Sehgal), who warns the girls about certain rules they must follow, or face dire consequences. They are instructed never to leave their respective stores all around the world, physically touch the skin of the people they meet, or use the great and incomprehensible strength and power of the Spices to their own ends. Tilo ends up in the San Francisco Bay Area in a store called \\"Spice Bazaar\\". Tilo's customers include Haroun, a cab driver (Nitin Ganatra), a grandfather (Anupam Kher) dealing with an American-born granddaughter Geeta (Padma Lakshmi), Kwesi, a man trying to impress his girlfriend (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) and Jagjit, a teenager trying to fit in at school (Sonny Gill Dulay). Her life takes a turn one day, when a young architect named Doug (Dylan McDermott) crashes his motorcycle outside her store. Tilo tends to his injuries while trying to ignore their mutual romantic attraction. Her life changes when he touches her and they begin to fall in love. But the Spices are displeased, and things soon start to go sour in her relationships with her other customers. Haroun gets in an accident, Geeta's family situation does not improve, Jagjit falls in with the wrong crowd at school, and Kwesi's girlfriend breaks up with him. Doug comes to meet her that night and sadly tells her that his Native American-born mother had died. Tilo recognizes that the source of these misfortunes is due to her breaking the rules fit for a Mistress. The First Mother comes to her in a vision and scolds her for choosing Doug over the Spices. She vows that she will return to India, and posts a notice about a closing sale. She goes all out to help her customers one last time and tells the Spices that she will spend just one night with Doug, and then she will give herself utterly to them. She closes the store and goes off with Doug for the night. After a night of love-making, she leaves him a note that she must leave and cannot return, but that she will always deeply love him. Then she goes back to the store and sets the Spices on fire, with her at the center of the flames, as a sign of eternal servitude to the mystical Spices. Doug comes searching for her, and finds the store devastated. But Tilo has not been burned after all; she is still there, alive and barely conscious. There is no sign of a fire, but there has been an earthquake. We see a vision of the First Mother sitting at the beach, telling her that because she demonstrated her willingness to give up everything for the Spices, now she can have everything she desires and the Spices will never desert her again. Doug agrees to help her rebuild the store, and she happily reunites with him as they walk along the beach holding hands.

The Act regulates employment in the province of Ontario, including wages, maximum work hours, overtime, vacation, and leaves of absence. It differs from the Ontario Labour Relations Act, which regulates unionized labour in Ontario. Act coverage The Act sets out the minimum standards that employers and employees must follow in regards to: * Continuity of employment * Payment of wages * Records * Hours of work and eating periods * Overtime pay * Minimum wage http://canlii.ca/en/on/laws/stat/so-2000-c-41/latest/so-2000-c-41.html#sec22.2subsec3 * Public holidays * Vacation with pay * Equal pay for equal work * Benefits plans * Leaves of absence (Pregnancy Leave, Parental leave, Family medical leave, Organ donor leave, Personal emergency leave, Emergency leave, declared emergencies, Reservist leave) * Termination and severance of employment * Lie detectors * Retail business establishments * Reprisal * Temporary help agencies * Building services providers Workers covered The Act defines \\"employee\\" as including: :* a person, including an officer of a corporation, who performs work for an employer for wages, :* a person who supplies services to an employer for wages, :* a person who receives training from a person who is an employer, if the skill in which the person is being trained is a skill used by the employer‚Äôs employees, or :* a person who is a homeworker, and includes a person who was an employee.Act, s. 1(1) There is a prohibition on any employer treating an employee as if the person is not an employee under the Act.Act, s. 5.1(1) Administration The Ministry of Labour administers the Act and its regulations by: * providing compliance support * conducting proactive inspections of payroll records and workplace practices to ensure the ESA is being followed * investigating and resolving complaints * enforcing the and its regulations = Compliance Support = The Ministry of Labour offers publications and services to help employees and employers understand their rights and comply with their obligations. These include an employment standards poster, which employers are required to post in their workplaces; a catalogue of fact sheets and information sheets covering a variety of topics; and interactive online tools and calculators to assist employers and employees to understand provisions of the Act, such as the Termination Tool, the Public Holiday Pay Calculator and the Severance Tool. = Proactive Inspections = Employment standards officers conduct proactive inspections of payroll and other records, including a review of employment practices. An officer performing a proactive inspection will usually visit the employer's business location. Officers may notify the employer in writing before the inspection but are not required to. A notice may set out a list of records and other documents the employer must provide during the inspection. The employer is required to produce the records requested and must answer questions that the officer thinks may be relevant. An officer is able to take away records or other information for review and copying. = Investigating Complaints = In most cases, employees should attempt to contact their employer or former employer (or the client of a temporary help agency, if applicable) about the employment standards right(s) they believe have been violated. However, there might be a good reason for an employee to not contact their employer (e.g. If the employee is afraid to contact the employer or he or she is a young employee). Employees have an opportunity to tell the ministry on the Claim Form why they did not contact their employer, or that they have already contacted their employer. If the employee contacted the employer but the issue was not resolved, the employee does not have to contact his or her employer again. If the parties are unable to resolve the issue on their own, and if the employee has provided all the required information on the Claim Form, the matter is assigned to an employment standards officer for investigation. The employment standards officer may conduct his or her investigation by telephone, through written correspondence, by visiting the employer's premises or by requiring the employee and/or the employer to attend a meeting. During an investigation, both parties have the opportunity to present the facts and arguments they believe are important to their case. If a claim has been submitted against the client of a temporary help agency regarding a possible reprisal or unpaid wages, employment standards officers have the same powers of investigation with respect to the client as they do for an employer. The officer will make a decision based on the best available evidence which may include employer records, client records, employee records, and interviews. After investigating a claim, the employment standards officer makes a decision about whether the employer has or has not followed the Act; If the officer finds that the employer has complied with the Act : * The employee is notified in writing of this decision and can apply for a review within 30 days. If the officer finds that the employer has not complied with the Act : * The employer or the client of a temporary help agency may resolve the issue by voluntarily complying with the officer's decision (i.e., by paying money that is owing to an employee or employees, or by adopting new, or changing existing, workplace practices). * Issue an order against the employer. (For more information, see \\"Enforcement\\", below.) * Officers can also require an employer to post a notice containing specific information about administration or enforcement of the Act, and/or a copy of the report or part of the report with the officer's findings. Some small business owners have complained that the Act treats them as though they were criminals. There are records of employees using the Act to abuse their employers.

The town served as county seat of Idaho County from 1875 to 1902. A stretch of trail opened in 1860 in the Mount Idaho area is believed to be one of the earliest examples of a toll road on record in the region. According to local legend, the owner of this road, Mose Milner, was forced to sell the area to Loyal P. Brown after being permanently disabled in a fight with a mountain lion. Brown is considered the founder of Mount Idaho. The town of Mount Idaho was founded around 1862 as an outpost serving nearby gold mining areas. By 1873 Mount Idaho was connected by stagecoach with Lewiston. During the 1877 Nez Perce War a hotel in Mount Idaho served as a hospital. Some of the dead from that conflict were buried in the town's cemetery. By 1892 Mount Idaho was in competition with nearby Grangeville, some away, as the main town in Idaho County. The county seat was moved from Mount Idaho to Grangeville ten years later. By 1922, when the town's post office closed, Mount Idaho had been effectively assimilated by Grangeville.

It was created based on the need for a common, universal standard of export for Internet Protocol flow information from routers, probes and other devices that are used by mediation systems, accounting/billing systems and network management systems to facilitate services such as measurement, accounting and billing. The IPFIX standard defines how IP flow information is to be formatted and transferred from an exporter to a collector. Previously many data network operators were relying on Cisco Systems' proprietary NetFlow technology for traffic flow information export. The IPFIX standards requirements were outlined in the original RFC 3917. Cisco NetFlow Version 9 was the basis for IPFIX. The basic specifications for IPFIX are documented in RFC 7011 through RFC 7015, and RFC 5103.  Architecture  The following figure shows a typical architecture of information flow in an IPFIX architecture: Exporter IPFIX Collector O--------------------------->O   Observation  Domain  Metering #1  Metering #2 O----------------O----------------O Metering #3     Observation  Observation  Observation  Point #1  Point #2  Point #3 v   \\\\---- IP Traffic --->   v  \\\\--------------- More IP Traffic --->  v \\\\---------------------------------- More IP Traffic ---> A pool of Metering Processes collects data packets at one or more Observation Points, optionally filters them and aggregates information about these packets. An Exporter then gathers each of the Observation Points together into an Observation Domain and sends this information via the IPFIX protocol to a Collector. Exporters and Collectors are in a many-to-many relationship: One Exporter can send data to many Collectors and one Collector can receive data from many Exporters. IEEE communications magazine,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.lcproxy.shu.ac.uk/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber;=5741152  Protocol  Similar to the NetFlow Protocol, IPFIX considers a flow to be any number of packets observed in a specific timeslot and sharing a number of properties, e.g. \\"same source, same destination, same protocol\\". Using IPFIX, devices like routers can inform a central monitoring station about their view of a potentially larger network. IPFIX is a push protocol, i.e. each sender will periodically send IPFIX messages to configured receivers without any interaction by the receiver. The actual makeup of data in IPFIX messages is to a great extent up to the sender. IPFIX introduces the makeup of these messages to the receiver with the help of special Templates. The sender is also free to use user-defined data types in its messages, so the protocol is freely extensible and can adapt to different scenarios. IPFIX prefers the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) as its transport layer protocol, but also allows the use of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP).  Example  A simple information set sent via IPFIX might look like this: Source Destination Packets \\\\------------------------------------------ 192.168.0.201 192.168.0.1 235 192.168.0.202 192.168.0.1 42 This information set would be sent in the following IPFIX message: { border=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" ----- ! bgcolor=\\"#BBBBBB\\"  Bits 0..15 ! bgcolor=\\"#BBBBBB\\"  Bits 16..31 -----  align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#CCCCFF\\"  Version = 0x000a  align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#CCCCFF\\"  Message Length = 64 Bytes -----  colspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#CCCCFF\\"  Export Timestamp = 2005-12-31 23:59:60 -----  colspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#CCCCFF\\"  Sequence Number = 0 -----  colspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#CCCCFF\\"  Observation Domain ID = 12345678 -----  align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#DDDDFF\\"  Set ID = 2 (Template)  align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#DDDDFF\\"  Set Length = 20 Bytes -----  align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#DDDDFF\\"  Template ID = 256  align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#DDDDFF\\"  Number of Fields = 3 -----  align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#DDDDFF\\"  Typ = sourceIPv4Address  align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#DDDDFF\\"  Field Length = 4 Bytes -----  align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#DDDDFF\\"  Typ = destinationIPv4Address  align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#DDDDFF\\"  Field Length = 4 Bytes -----  align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#DDDDFF\\"  Typ = packetDeltaCount  align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#DDDDFF\\"  Field Length = 4 Bytes -----  align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#CCCCFF\\"  Set ID = 256 (Data Set using Template 256)  align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#CCCCFF\\"  Set Length = 28 Bytes -----  colspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#CCCCFF\\"  Record 1, Field 1 = 192.168.0.201 -----  colspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#CCCCFF\\"  Record 1, Field 2 = 192.168.0.1 -----  colspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#CCCCFF\\"  Record 1, Field 3 = 235 Packets -----  colspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#CCCCFF\\"  Record 2, Field 1 = 192.168.0.202 -----  colspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#CCCCFF\\"  Record 2, Field 2 = 192.168.0.1 -----  colspan=\\"2\\" align=\\"center\\" bgcolor=\\"#CCCCFF\\"  Record 2, Field 3 = 42 Packets } As can be seen, the message contains the IPFIX header and two IPFIX Sets: One Template Set that introduces the build-up of the Data Set used, as well as one Data Set, which contains the actual data. When IPFIX is sent over a protocol which keeps a session state (TCP or SCTP), the Template Set need not be retransmitted since it is buffered in Collectors. Since the Template Set can change over time, it must be retransmitted if a new session state is established or if IPFIX is sent over UDP which is a session-less protocol.

Biography Andrews was born in Anniston in Calhoun County in North Alabama, a son of Roger Lee Andrews and the former Beryl Elizabeth Jones. He attended public schools in Birmingham and attended John Herbert Phillips High School there. He then graduated from Mercersburg Academy, a boarding school in Mercersburg, Pennsylvania. Andrews graduated from Princeton University with an A.B. in politics in 1931 after completing an 83-page long senior thesis titled \\"Mr. Charles Evans Hughes. A Study of his Early Life, and Some of His Economic Opinions.\\" He married Ethel Standish Jackson in 1937. Career Associated with National City Bank of New York, from 1931 to 1933, Andrews was then with International Business Machines (IBM), from 1933 to 1936. He became district manager of an Eastman Kodak subsidiary, from 1936 to 1946; and was an advertising executive, from 1946 to 1970, excluding his single term in Congress. An Alabama Republican, Andrews represented Alabama's 4th congressional district, since mainly the 3rd district, in the United States House of Representatives. The district centers on Andrews' birthplace of Anniston. A Democratic candidate for the Alabama House of Representatives in 1956 and for secretary of state in 1958, Andrews switched parties and was a delegate to the 1964 Republican National Convention held in San Francisco, where he was committed to the party's presidential nominee, then U.S. Senator Barry M. Goldwater of Arizona. He was elected to Congress on the Goldwater ticket, which easily prevailed over an unpledged elector slate in Alabama. U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson was not listed on the Alabama ballot. Since almost none of the district's living residents had been represented by a Republican before, it may have seemed surprising that he defeated seven-term Democrat Kenneth A. Roberts, 40,143 (58.6 percent) to 27,800 (40.6 percent). However, most of the district's voters, like most Alabama voters, turned against the Democrats due to the national party's increasingly strong stand on civil rights. Four other Alabama Republicans were elected to the U.S. House with Andrews: James D. Martin of Gadsden, John Buchanan of Birmingham, William Dickinson of Montgomery, and Jack Edwards of Mobile. Andrews served only in the 89th Congress from January 3, 1965 to January 3, 1967. He and other Alabama members opposed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which passed after the landmark African American-led March from Selma to the state capital at Montgomery. In 1966, Andrews was defeated for reelection by about the same margin that he had won in 1964. He was unseated by the Democratic State Senator Bill Nichols. Nichols received 54,515 votes (58.7 percent) to Andrews' 38,402 (41.3 percent). For a time, Andrews chaired the Alabama Fourth Congressional District Republican Executive Committee. He sought to return to Congress in the 1970 general election, when Wallace ran unopposed for a second term as governor. He was overwhelmingly defeated by Nichols, who won 77,701 votes (83.7 percent) to Andrews' 13,217 (14.2 percent). President Richard Nixon appointed Andrews a trustee in bankruptcy court, a position which he held from 1973 to 1985. Death Andrews died in White Plains, Calhoun County, Alabama, on September 25, 2008 (age 99 years, 254 days). He was cremated, and his ashes are interred at Grace Episcopal Church Columbarium, in Anniston, Alabama. Andrews became the oldest former member on November 10, 2007, with the death of former U.S. Representative Augustus Hawkins, a California Democrat. At his death the oldest living former member of the United States Congress. Upon Andrews' death, William H. Avery, the Republican governor of Kansas from 1965 to 1967, became the oldest living former member of Congress.

He was often referred to by his nickname Bomber and was known for his spectacular goals. He joined West Bromwich Albion as a youth in 1961 and turned professional in 1963. In the late 1960s and early 1970s Brown was part of an Albion team that built a reputation as a successful cup side, winning the 1966 Football League Cup Final and the 1968 FA Cup Final and finishing as runners-up in the League Cup in 1967 and 1970. He was the top scorer in Division One in 1970‚Äì71 and received his only England cap at the end of that season. After relegation in 1973, he helped Albion to win promotion back to Division One in 1976. He scored 279 goals in 720 competitive games for Albion, both club records. Brown finished his playing career playing for the New England Tea Men, Torquay United and non-league Stafford Rangers. Since retiring from playing he has worked as a coach and a commentator. Early life One of three siblings, Brown moved at an early age from his birthplace Oldham to Wythenshawe, Manchester.Brown, Homer & Willmore p7 He was a keen Manchester United supporter as a boy, but his football idol was the then Manchester City striker Denis Law, who later signed for United just as Brown was beginning his own career as a footballer.Brown, Homer & Willmore p8 Brown represented the South Manchester Boys team, before progressing to play for Manchester Boys and then the Lancashire County team. He suffered from asthma from three months old until the age of fourteen, but nonetheless had ambitions to play football. As he later said, \\"I'd always wanted to be a professional footballer; that's all I'd ever dreamed of doing.\\"Brown, Homer & Willmore p9 As a 15-year-old, he had agreed to sign for Manchester City when West Bromwich Albion's Manchester- based scout John Shaw persuaded Brown to take a trial at Albion.Brown, Homer & Willmore pp9‚Äì10 Brown responded by scoring a hat-trick in a practice match and some years later reflected:McOwan p5. West Bromwich Albion =First team breakthrough= Brown joined West Bromwich Albion as an apprentice professional on 13 April 1961, earning a wage of ¬£6 a week.Brown, Homer & Willmore p10 After two seasons playing youth football, he made his reserve team debut in the final Central League game of 1962‚Äì63, scoring in a 3‚Äì2 defeat to Manchester United reserves.Brown, Homer & Willmore p15. He turned professional on 27 September 1963 and was immediately called up to the first team squad for the away match at Ipswich Town the following day. Eddie Readfern was unable to participate in the game due to illness, which meant that Brown was given his league debut, just a few days before his 18th birthday; his equalising goal helped Albion to a 2‚Äì1 away win.Brown, Homer & Willmore pp16‚Äì17. Readfern was recalled for the next game however, meaning that Brown immediately returned to the reserves, although Brown did return to the first team in mid-October, when he scored on his home debut which Albion went on to win 4‚Äì3 against Aston Villa.Brown, Homer & Willmore p18. He was selected sporadically by Albion manager Jimmy Hagan during the remainder of 1963‚Äì64 and finished the campaign on five goals in thirteen appearances.Matthews (2007) pp304‚Äì305. In the latter part of the season he missed four league games when he was called up to the England Youth squad for the UEFA European Youth Tournament in the Netherlands. England won the competition but Brown was not selected for any of the games.Brown, Homer & Willmore p19. Brown became a regular first team player during the early part of the 1964‚Äì65 campaign, appearing in Albion's first 12 league games of the season.

Brown remained at the Hawthorns until the summer of 1980 when he moved to the United States to join the New England Tea Men. As well as Albion's two cup triumphs of the 1960s, he had also played a part in their re-emergence as a leading First Division side in the late 1970s, which saw them peak with a third place league finish and run to the UEFA Cup quarter-finals in the 1978-79 season. In 17 years at the Hawthorns, Brown had broken both the appearance and goalscoring records for the Baggies, scoring 218 goals in 574 league games. Both of these records remain intact nearly 40 years later. He returned to the UK after the 1981 NASL season, playing once for the West Bromwich Albion reserve side in September 1981. The following month, on 8 October 1981, the Torquay United managerial team of Frank O'Farrell and Bruce Rioch persuaded Brown to join Torquay, with a second testimonial staged in his honour on 7 December 1981 when Torquay faced Manchester United at Plainmoor. Brown lived up to his reputation with 11 goals in 45 league appearances for Torquay before moving to non-league Stafford Rangers in 1983. He later coached at Birmingham City (in the 1987‚Äì88 season he was assistant to Garry Pendrey) and West Bromwich Albion.

An hour later, the center downgraded the warning to only the region within 600 miles of the epicenter, and an hour after that, it canceled the alert. Damage The event caused very limited damage. The previous large earthquake in Tonga, in 1977, was of a lower magnitude but resulted in more severe damage. A likely cause is that the 2006 quake generated other frequencies that only resulted in resonance in small items.

Background Nagara, as with the other vessels of her class, was intended for use as the flagship of a destroyer flotilla, and it was in that role that she participated in the invasions of the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Design The Nagara-class vessels were essentially identical to the earlier s, using the same hull design, powerplant and layout of armament. The main differences were in the design of the bridge, which was raised to allow for an aircraft hangar and launch platform above the No.2 gun in front of the bridge. Another change was the installation of the new, larger Type 93 torpedoes, which required an extension of the main deck. All vessels in the class were modified extensively during their operational lives, with no two vessels modified in the same way.Stille, Imperial Japanese Navy Light Cruisers 1941-45 , pages 20-27; Service career =Early career= Nagara was laid down on 9 September 1920, launched on 25 April 1921 and completed at Sasebo Naval Arsenal, and commissioned on 21 April 1922.

Early life Keith was born James Ian Baird on 25 July 1908 but usually went by his middle name Ian. He was the eldest son of the Governor- General of Australia and Minister for Transport John Baird, 1st Viscount Stonehaven and Ethel Sydney Keith-Falconer, 11th Countess of Kintore. His younger brother was Hon.

Most modern shoulder pads consist of a shock absorbing foam material with a hard plastic outer covering. The pieces are usually secured by rivets or strings that the user can tie to adjust the size.  History  1906 photograph of early American football uniform with rudimentary shoulder pads worn by Bradbury Robinson, who threw the first legal forward pass The first football shoulder pads were created by Princeton student L.P. Smock in 1877. These were made of leather and wool and were thin, light, and did not provide much protection. In the early years of the 1900s decade, many young football players were killed while playing the sport due to the ferocity of the sport combined with the lack of sufficient protection. In 1905 President Theodore Roosevelt took the initiative to clean up the sport. He decried football as a dangerous sport and certain actions needed to be taken so that the sport could remain legal. These shoulder pads were sewn into the players' jerseys rather than being worn as a separate piece of equipment. Allegedly Pop Warner was the first to have his players wear shoulder pads. When he was coaching at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School, he was the first one to use pads made of fiber rather than cotton. The traditional, separate, over the head shoulder pads first made an appearance around 1910 to help make football a safer sport --these are the same style shoulder pads still used today. However, many players still did not use shoulder pads until the 1950s. In the 1960s, newer technology allowed companies to produce shoulder pads that were made of foam with an outer shell of hard plastic, offering improved protection when being hit. The drawback to these pads were that they did not have very much ventilation. Limited ventilation caused players to dehydrate quicker. This issue was fixed in the 1990s when synthetic fibers were added, making the shoulder pads more breathable. In American Football, shoulder pads have also been a fashion statement as well. In the 80's larger shoulder pads were worn to make players look bigger and to intimidate the opposition. However, in the modern era shoulder pads have been slimmed down to increase mobility. Properly fitting pads are critical. Shoulder pads are fitted to an adult football player by measuring across the player's back from shoulder blade to shoulder blade with a soft cloth tape measure and then adding inch. All points of the pads should be checked to assure proper fit. Maintenance during football season includes monthly checks and replacing worn parts. In terms of American Football, various styles of shoulder pads exist for different positions played. Pads for a quarterback are lightweight and offer freedom of movement. Pads for linemen are designed with few flaps and epaulets, thus reducing the opportunity of being grabbed by the opposition. A player may have a preference for vinyl buckles or elastic straps.

Thousands of ancient carvings in stone were discovered in the C√¥a Valley in the 1980s and 1990s.

The drawings attracted worldwide attention when plans to build a hydroelectric dam across the C√¥a Valley threatened to submerge them. Although hydroelectric development was already well underway, outcry from locals, the scientific community and the media led to dam construction being halted in 1995 after a change in the national government following elections.

The degree of structural pluralism is used to examine how societies are structured, and specifically is a way to explain coverage differences in media markets. Structural pluralism is studied in philosophical, sociological and communication literature. Structural pluralism is what makes civic community a unique form of civil society (Morton, 2000). Structural pluralism represents the extent to which the community has an open and inclusive structure that permits minority voices and opinions to be heard when citizens and citizen groups are addressing community problems (Young, 1999). Communities are discussed in terms of having common institutions, such as governing or other political bodies, religious, educational and economic institutions. These bodies or institutions help to maintain the social order within the community. This concept comes from the field of sociology, but prior to that, stems from writings by Hegel (1821) on civic society. This comes also from the functionalist writings of √âmile Durkheim and Herbert Spencer (Hindman, 1999). Durkheim writes that there are two organizating principle types of societies, that most like the premodern communities, called mechanical solidarity in which ethnic and extended families were central; and that called organic solidarity which examines the relationships of interdependence based on other components, such as work, and social organizations (Durkheim, 1933). These are equated to today's rural and urban societies respectively.  In journalism  Olien, Donohue and Tichenor (1978; Tichenor, Olien, & Donohue, 1980) helped to fold this concept into the communication discipline when they noted that structural pluralism has an effect on the way in which news is presented. Through several studies and publications, they built a model of structural pluralism, and later showed how power relationships work through a systems approach (Donohue, Olien, & Tichenor, 1985; Tichenor, Olien, & Donohue, 1980). As media are typically supportive of the social system and institutions, as well as dependent upon them for gaining access to and gathering material that will be useful to the public, they often reflect the power structure of the community. Movements, groups or discussions that are critical of the social structure are often excluded from newspapers in communities where there is a strongly centralized power structure. An example of such a community would be a town in which a significant portion of adults are employed by one business or industry. Criticism of this business or industry may erode the faith of community members in it and lead to social unrest. Initially the work of the Olien, Tichenor and Donohue camp allowed us to see how diversity in communities is reflected in the reporting style of news organizations. Conflict within communities is more often reported in larger and less homogeneous areas. However, prior to the Olien, Tichenor, Donohue writings came those of Breed (1958) and Paletz, Reichert and McIntyre (1971). In their original pieces, the lack of criticism by the press on central powerholders was discussed. Other studies of the impact of structural pluralism on journalism have looked shown that women are more often represented in areas that are more ethnically diverse (Armstrong, 2002); that newspapers in more diverse communities will be less likely to ignore protest stories or report them in an abbreviated fashion (Stein, et al., 2003); and others. Structural pluralism has been discussed in law journals as a paradigmatic shift regarding the privatization of government entities (Roberts, 2001). \\\\---- See also *Freedom of the press *Cultural diversity References  Durkheim, E.

He was the father-in-law of revolutionary Dimitar Popgeorgiev (1840-1907). Early life Iliya was born in the city of Berovo, at the time part of the Rumelia Eyalet of the Ottoman Empire (in modern eastern North Macedonia), into a poor farmer family. The birthdate is given as 28 May, while the birthyear is unclear; early literature place it at 1805, while Vasil D. Stoyanov said that Ilyo was 45 years of age in 1867 (thus born in 1822). Historian Jovan Had≈æi-Vasiljeviƒá (1866‚Äì1946) said that Ilyo was at most 50 years of age in 1865 (thus born in, or after, 1815). His father was named Marko Popgeorgiev (–ú–∞—Ä–∫–æ –ü–æ–ø–≥–µ–æ—Ä–≥–∏–µ–≤/–ü–æ–ø-–ì–µ–æ—Ä–≥–∏–µ–≤, hence Markov). Ilyo was a prominent Hajduk voyvoda (commander) of cheta's (armed bands) in Maleshevo, Rila and Pirin. Later he worked as a keeper in the Rila monastery. In 1859 he moved to Belgrade. In 1861 he joined the Bulgarian Legion, headquartered in Belgrade, and took part in the Serbian-Turkish War (1876‚Äì77) and Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì78). Liberation of Bulgaria Ilyo used every chance to make a contribution in any war against the Ottoman Empire. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì1878 he operated with a band near Lovech. His band joined the Western divisions of general Joseph Vladimirovich Gourko and participated in the liberation of Sofia, Radomir and Kyustendil. Illyo was one of the Bulgarian representatives at the signing of the Treaty of San Stefano which marked the restoration of Bulgaria in its ethnic borders. It was there he was awarded a medal for bravery.Petrinska, M., Illyo Voivoda zhitie-bitie, Sofia, 1988, Narodna Mladezh, p. 76 Post-Liberation activity The joy from the liberation was short-lived though, as the Treaty of Berlin (1878) soon partitioned the newly liberated country. Bulgaria was divided into three parts: the Principality of Bulgaria, the autonomous province of Eastern Rumelia and Macedonia given back to the Ottomans. The discontent among the people erupted in the Kresna-Razlog Uprising (1878‚Äì1879) in which Illyo took active participation. Illyo Voivoda and his band took part in Serbo-Bulgarian War despite the advancing age of the leader. As part of the Radomir squad they participated in the battles of Breznik, Slivnitsa and Vranje among others. Legacy He fought in battles all his life, and died from old age at the end of the 19th century in Kyustendil. He is a near-mythical figure of the region and has been the subject of many folk songs. Some of his personal belongings are kept in the monastery of St. Archangel Michael which serves as the city museum of Berovo. The house in which Ilyo Voyvoda lived from 1878 to his death in 1898 in Kyustendil survived long enough to be renovated in 1979-1980 and has served as a museum, dedicated to Ilyo Voyvoda and the people's fight for freedom in Kyustendil since 1981.

It is situated on the river Unstrut, 9 km northwest of Hanseatic Naumburg, 63 km from Leipzig and 231 km from Berlin. It is part of the Verwaltungsgemeinschaft (\\"collective municipality\\") Unstruttal. The town is a tourist destination, best known for its vineyards, historic town centre, superb 11th-century castle and associations with Friedrich Ludwig Jahn (founder of modern gymnastics). One of the most prosperous towns in the region, Freyburg is nicknamed 'Tuscany of the North' It is the headquarters of one of the world's largest wine companies. The town and the castle of Freyburg are part of the World Heritage designation ‚ÄúNaumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut‚Äù. History Zscheiplitz view This part of the cultural landscape is closely associated with the powerful noble family of the Ludowings, who left their mark here from 1080 onwards. As counts palatine of Electorate of Saxony and landgraves of Thuringia they belonged to the highest ranks of nobility in the High Middle Ages. = Neuenburg = Most prominent monument to their rank and ambition is the large Neuenburg Castle dating to the period between 1090 and 1220, which is among the biggest and most remarkable castles of its time in all of Europe. It features a double chapel, a residence tower for the ducal family, a very impressive castle keep ‚ÄûDicker Wilhelm‚Äú and vast authentic wall and fortification structures, all dating back to this period. The castle was built around 1090 by the Thuringian count Ludwig der Springer, securing his territory in the east, as did its sister castle Wartburg in the west. Situated in the border region, this fortified castle served military purposes and reflected ambitions, self-confidence and sophistication of the Ludowingians. Already in 1100, Neuenburg Castle was the most important fortification in central Germany and remained of outstanding political and military significance until the 13th century. The Neuenburg Castle was five times larger than Castle Wartburg and was built in the same style, with the latter being known as the most quintessential German castle due to its associations with Martin Luther and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and its role in the origination of the modern German flag. The Neuenburg has also played a significant role over the centuries, hosting historical figures like King Henry I, Holy Roman Emperor Friedrich Barbarossa and the poet Heinrich von Veldeke. By the 13th century, the Neuenburg came under the control of members of the house of Wettin (now the royal family of England). Freyburg, thus, was part of the Electorate of Saxony until it was annexed by Prussia in the 19th century. Not surprisingly, Freyburg has been a strategic military prize throughout history and has been attacked by the Swedish army in the 17th century and the French army in the 19th century under Napoleon. = Old town of Freyburg = In the last quarter of the 12th, Herman I from the Ludovingian dynasty founded the town of Freyburg. The town was built at the food of Neuenburg Castle around a rectangular market place to meet the demands of the increased population, to provide the Neuenburg Castle with merchandise and to secure the passage and revenues of the Unstrut River. The landgraves of Thuringia controlled the road in the valley by erecting this fortified town. The determinative ‚Äúfrey‚Äù (free) referred to the royal freedom granted to it when it was founded and to the baronial privilege of a nearly royal rank, which primarily reveals the self-image of its rulers. In its midst the splendid early gothic church of St. Mary has been preserved, along with large parts of the authentic city walls and the layout of the market square and streets. It is an extraordinary example of planned cities in the High Middle Ages. Monastery Pforta Bordering on the city walls the terraced vineyards of the Schweigenberge is situated, which is in constant use since the High Middle Ages and still operated mainly by the local residents of Freyburg, most of whom run small vineyards for personal use, as has been the case here since medieval times. Pforta from air = Monastery of Zscheiplitz = The Ludowings also constructed the nearby Benedictine nun monastery of Zscheiplitz around 1200. The monastery church has preserved its authentic structure and decorum of the High Middle Ages. The line of sight along the Unstrut river from Zscheiplitz to the Schweigenberge on to Freyburg and to Neuenburg Castle remains unchanged and intact since the High Middle Ages. Between 1825-1852, Freyburg was the home in exile to 18th century gymnastics educator Friedrich Ludwig Jahn. He was widely regarded as the founder of modern gymnastics and left behind the world's first gymnasium in Freyburg. He is buried in Freyburg and his memorial in the town has become a pilgrimage site for gymnasts such as Olympic champion Klaus Koeste and world champion Erika Zuchold.  World Heritage Nomination  Neuenburg view from Freyburg Freyburg is one of the eleven components of the cultural landscape Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut that has been proposed by the Federal Republic of Germany for inscription in the List of World Heritage. It is composed of Neuenburg Castle, the old town of Freyburg, its Schweigenberg vineyard, as well as Zscheiplitz Monastery and is located in the municipality of Sch√∂nburg 4.5 kilometers east of Naumburg at the heart of Federal Republic of Germany in the State of Saxony-Anhalt. The World Heritage nomination is representative for the processes that shaped the continent during the High Middle Ages between 1000 and 1300: Christianization, the so- called ‚ÄúLandesausbau‚Äù and the dynamics of cultural exchange and transfer characteristic for this very period.UNESCO (2017): WHC/17/41.COM/INF.8B1. Neuenburg view Wine Freyburg is the northernmost wine growing region in Germany and Europe and has a wine festival called the \\"Winzerfest\\" every year in September. One of the oldest wine growing regions in Europe, the Freyburg region has more than a thousand years of documented wine growing history. Despite having barely 700 hectares of vineyards under cultivation, the town is the headquarters of one of the world's largest wine companies - Rotk√§ppchen- Mumm. The winery was founded in 1856, and by 2010, captured nearly half the market for sparkling wine in Germany and has a reported turnover of more than US$1 billion (780 million euros). This Freyburg-based producer is one of the five largest producers of sparkling wine in the world, along with Spanish producer Freixenet (headquartered near Barcelona) and French producer Mo√´t Hennessy Louis Vuitton (headquartered in Paris). There are also other smaller wine producers in the region. Wine critics have pointed out that while there were not that many great wines from the Freyburg area, there were also very few poorly made wines. Quality across vineyards tend to be fairly consistent, ranging from average to very good. However, there are a handful of award- winning wine producers that are highly rated by critics, such as Winzerhof Gussek, Weingut U.L√ºtzkendorf and Weingut Bernhard Pawis. Freyburg can grow wine commercially unlike other regions of similar latitudes in Europe is based on the high concentration of heat-retaining calcium in the soil and a micro- climate that make it significantly warmer than nearby Berlin and Leipzig. The river Unstrut runs through it, and is home to large pike, trout, carp and beavers. In the hills surrounding the town, there are deer, wild boar, pheasant and fox. There are many working farms scattered around the region, offering a wide range of fresh and organic produce.

It took place in the valley of the C√¥a River and it was the first significant battle for the new army of 65,000 men controlled by Marshal Andr√© Mass√©na, as the French prepared for their third invasion of Portugal. As the British-Portuguese forces were outnumbered here, on July 22, General Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington sent Brigadier-General Robert Craufurd a letter, saying that he (Wellington) was \\"not desirous of engaging in an affair beyond the Coa.\\" On July 24, Craufurd's Light Division, with 4,200 infantry, 800 cavalry, and six guns, was surprised by the sight of 20,000 troops under Marshal Michel Ney. Rather than retreat and cross the river as ordered by Wellington, Craufurd chose to engage the French, narrowly avoiding disaster. The French objective was to force the Light Division back across the C√¥a in order to besiege Almeida. They succeeded after hard fighting, but then launched a costly assault across the C√¥a, suffering heavy casualties. Battle of the River C√¥a =Order of Battle= British-Portuguese forces engaged were: *Light Division: Major General Robert Craufurd *1st Brigade: Lieut-Col Sydney Beckwith **1/43rd Foot **1/95th Regiment of Foot (Rifles) (1/2 battalion) **3rd Portuguese Ca√ßadores *2nd Brigade: Lieut-Col Robert Barclay **1/52nd Foot **1/95th Regiment of Foot (Rifles) (1/2 battalion) **1st Portuguese Ca√ßadores *Cavalry Brigade: Brig-Gen George Anson **14th Light Dragoons (3 Squadrons) **16th Light Dragoons (2 Squadrons) **1st King's German Legion Hussars *Chestnut Troop, Royal Horse Artillery. The engaged units of Ney's VI Corps included: *Infantry Division: Maj-Gen Julien Augustin Joseph Mermet (7,600) **Brigade: Brig-Gen Martial Maison-Rouge ***25th Light Infantry Regiment (2 battalions) ***27th Line Infantry Regiment (3 battalions) **Brigade: Brig-Gen Mathieu Delabass√© ***50th Line Infantry Regiment (3 battalions) ***59th Line Infantry Regiment (3 battalions) *Infantry Division: Maj-Gen Louis Henri Loison (6,800) **Brigade: Brig-Gen √âdouard Simon ***Legion du Midi (1 battalion) ***Hanoverian Legion (2 battalions) ***26th Line Infantry Regiment (3 battalions) **Brigade: Brig-Gen Claude Fran√ßois Ferey ***32nd Light Infantry Regiment (1 battalion) ***66th Line Infantry Regiment (3 battalions) ***82nd Line Infantry Regiment (2 battalions) *Corps Cavalry Brigade: Brig-Gen Auguste Lamotte (1,000) **3rd Hussar Regiment **15th Chasseurs √† Cheval Regiment *Reserve Cavalry Brigade: Brig-Gen Charles Gardanne (1,300) **15th Dragoon Regiment **25th Dragoon Regiment *Artillery: four foot and two horse artillery batteries =French Offensive= Craufurd committed a serious tactical error by choosing to fight with an unfordable river at his back while badly outnumbered. As such, in the early hours of 24 July, after a night of torrential rain, Ney sent forth Ferey and Loison's divisions to engage the allies. A company of the 95th Rifles came under fire from French artillery as they moved in to attack. French voltigeurs of the 32nd then came up and took the fight to the bayonet, and the heavily outnumbered British broke and fled. The guns of Almeida opened fire on the 95th Rifles, mistaking them for French because of their dark uniforms. They then fell under attack by the French 3rd Hussars, supported by two companies of dragoons. British troops of the 43rd came to assist them. Though fierce fighting broke out, the French advance was halted. Despite orders from Wellington to fall back across the river C√¥a, Craufurd decided to hold his ground as more French arrived and began to deploy in formation. The 15th Chasseurs a Cheval then charged to the south to outflank the British 52nd Light Infantry, while Ferey's French brigade attacked the British positioned near a windmill positioned at the British right, advancing through rough- terrain while Almeida's guns were firing upon them. The French infantry charged the British with fixed bayonet and, under mounting pressure, the allies began to fall back, isolating themselves from the 43rd Light Infantry under attack by the 15th Chasseurs. The 3rd Hussars came into the fight and Craufurd's men took heavy casualties. All this time, while Ney's assaults were being slowed by awful terrain, Almeida was slowly being isolated from the allied force. Craufurd, realising his situation that the French were threatening his only escape (the bridge crossing the river C√¥a), ordered a withdrawal across the river C√¥a, with the British 52nd and 43rd Light Infantry as well as the 95th Rifles protecting their retreat. For the British, matters only became worse. A supply wagon turned over and caused a traffic jam in the retreat across the bridge. The French were gradually driving back the British divisions protecting the withdrawal. Craufurd then ordered these troops to fall back and take position the heights overlooking the bridge and hold that position until the retreat had been made. The French took the heights, but in a move that took the Ney's forces completely by surprise the allies made an assault and held their opponents at bay long enough for the main body of the British-Portuguese to make it across to the other side of the river C√¥a. =Assault across the C√¥a= With the French driving the Light Division back, Ney then attempted attacking across the C√¥a. In the first attempt, grenadiers of the 66th surged towards the bridge under a hail of musketry and cannon fire, failing to get more than halfway across the bridge. The second more strongly-pressed offensive was made by the Elite Chasseurs de la Si√®ge light infantry. Oman writes that they had \\"flung themselves at the bridge, and pushed on till it was absolutely blocked by the bodies of the killed and the wounded, and till they themselves had been almost literally exterminated, for out of a battalion of little more than 300 men 90 were killed and 147 wounded in less than ten minutes.\\" The final attack was once more led by the 66th which was beaten off with little difficulty. =Aftermath= The battle ended with the French having, despite the setback at the bridge, driven the Light Division from the field. Having been beaten back and only narrowly escaped a total rout, Crauford's forces withdrew at midnight, leaving Mass√©na free rein to lay siege to Almeida. Napier and Oman stated that the British Light Division held off the entire 20 000 troops under Ney. However, it was only Ferey and Loison's division that actually engaged the Light Division. French forces engaged were around 6,000 pitched against 4,000 British-Portuguese. Casualties are hard to determine. Both the French and the British-Portuguese were biased. Imperial propaganda reported allied casualties to be at 1,200, while many British sources claimed the loss of 36 killed and 189 wounded as well as 83 missing. On the other hand, French casualties are easier to determine, as both the allies and French estimated around five hundred dead or wounded. The great majority of these casualties were due to Ney's futile attack across the bridge.

Premium finance loans are often provided by a third party finance entity known as a premium financing company; however insurance companies and insurance brokerages occasionally provide premium financing services through premium finance platforms. Premium financing is mainly devoted to financing life insurance which differs from property and casualty insurance. To finance a premium, the individual or company requesting insurance must sign a premium finance agreement with the life insurance premium finance company. The loan arrangement may last from one year to the life of the policy. The premium finance company then pays the insurance premium and bills the individual or company, usually in monthly installments, for the cost of the loan. Typically, clients that engage in this transaction are age 29 to 75; with net worth of $5MM or greater. Premium financing is popular when interest rates are low. Types of life insurance premium financing *\\"Traditional\\" Recourse Premium Finance - The client enters a fully collateralized loan arrangement with the intention of holding the life insurance policy to maturity. Traditional financing arrangements are generally purchased for estate liquidity needs and offer the most advantageous loan rates, fees, and spreads. The client may have an exit strategy using other assets in the estate. Traditional finance is particularly effective for clients who have a large but illiquid net worth. *Non-Recourse Premium Finance & Hybrid Premium Finance are now available. Additionally the collateralized investments may be held by the insured's investment team as long as the collateral money is pledged annually with third party verification of the funds. This is not suitable for the client that has primarily illiquid funds such as real estate. Cash investments are the accepted collateral. *It is important to have an attorney or premium finance platform, familiar with premium finance transactions, review any and all documentation surrounding a premium finance transaction. Currently, specialty premium finance platforms exist to establish consistency and reliability in premium finance transactions. Be sure to notice that any upfront inducements offered to an insured to enter into a premium finance transaction should be viewed as illegal and individual insurance laws should be carefully reviewed (although many states allow insurance agents to rebate a portion of their commission as long as they rebate the same percentage of their commission to all of their clients). *In addition, be aware of programs that require non recourse or are advertising \\"free insurance\\". These programs are likely not carrier endorsed or can include substantial hidden upfront fees. *Additionally, most advisers are utilizing premium finance platforms to aid in the case design, maintenance (annual servicing) of life insurance premium finance cases, thereby mitigating any inherent risk.  Benefits  There are a number of benefits to financing insurance premiums. These include: *Eliminates the requirement for a large up- front payment to an insurance company. *Multiple insurance policies can be attached to a single premium finance contract, allowing for a single payment plan to cover all insurance coverage. *Premium financing is often transparent to the individual or company insured. Brokers transmit the completed premium finance agreement to the premium finance company, and the policy holder is billed as they would be for any other typical insurance policy. *Allows for clients to obtain needed coverage without liquidating other assets. * The main benefit in premium financing is the avoiding the opportunity cost in paying out of pocket. By using other people's money (leveraging a lender's capital), clients can retain a significant amount of capital known as retained capital *Typical client profile: Age 29 to 75; Net Worth $5MM or greater; Business- owner, entrepreneur, professional; Desire to retain capital whilst maximizing wealth transfer & potential tax-free retirement *Especially with advent of indexed universal life insurance and premium finance strategies for these chassis.  Risks and mitigation  Factors to consider: =Interest rate volatility risk= Since the interest due on the money lent to pay premiums is tied to an index, usually the LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) or Prime if interest rates rise, the total interest charge will rise as well. If the policy owner can't afford to pay interest payments then they stand to lose their insurance and be left with significant debt if the surrender value of the policy is less than the balance owed. If this becomes the case the client would have not been able to pay the premiums on a non financed policy in any event so as with anything else make sure your can afford the policy. Responsible lenders take this risk into account when they do their financial underwriting. Typical loan rates are pegged to 1 year LIBOR with a competitive spread of ~ 180 bit/s. Most borrowing rates can be anticipated from 2.5% to 6%; depending on the fluctuation of 1 year LIBOR + the fixed spread. =Renewal risk= The lender may have the right to call the loan at the end of the term. Virtually all premium financing loans have terms of a duration less than the life of the policy. =Carrier credit rating risk= Financing terms are sensitive to the credit rating of the carrier holding the financed policy. Carrier downgrades may result in the lender choosing to not pay additional premiums, requiring the borrower to post additional collateral or call the loan and collapse all the collateral to cover any moneys due to the Lender. Most premium finance platforms require carriers to be S&P; rated A or greater. =Crediting rate risk= Carriers choose the crediting rate of in- force blocks of business at-will. Current crediting rates are not guaranteed. As such, any illustrated arbitrage in interest rates between the policy crediting rate and the loan interest rate may not exist in the future. =Credit spread risk= Life insurance carriers and premium finance lenders use the same fundamental financial instruments. Carriers fund insurance contracts with corporate debt. Lenders provide liquidity at personal debt rates. Corporate debt yields are less than personal debt rates. As such, premium financing may carry a negative spread for the client financing the premiums. Indexed Universal Life insurance, through Indexing, may provide the policy the interest crediting needed to support the arbitrage. =Collateral risk= Most premium financing arrangements that are designed to provide liquidity to the client at death are 100% collateralized. In most cases, the client must either post a Letter of Credit (LOC), securities accounts, other non-financed life insurance policies, annuities or any other hard assets approved by Lender to satisfy collateral. Collateral requirements may vary with economic conditions and could force the client to liquidate positions in order to post collateral. Furthermore, a decrease in the value of collateralized assets (such as real estate or securities) may require the insured or their estate to post additional collateral. =Settlement risk= (Note - Settlement Risk pertains to Life Settlement Transaction, Not all Premium Finance Transactions) Some premium financing programs are sold under the assumption that the policy will have a substantial market value at the end of the term. The client can then exit financing arrangement and realize a gain on investment. The secondary life insurance market is highly volatile. Settlement offers will vary with the interest rate environment and the degree to which capital will \\"wait\\" for a return. Any premium finance program or broker that induces you to enter into a premium finance transaction with the sole purpose of selling the policy after the policy is no longer contestable by the issuing carrier (generally two years) may be illegal and violate a state \\"insurable interest laws\\". =Insurable interest= Insurable interest is a concept that dates back to the English legal system. Wagering on the life of an insured was common, and many times a person with no interest, economic or otherwise, would take out a life insurance contract on a sea captain running dangerous routes, a boxer facing a deadly opponent, etc. This caused the English courts to declare that an individual taking out a life insurance contract on the life of an insured must have an \\"Insurable Interest\\" in their life. This means, in its simplest terms, you must benefit more by having the individual insured alive, than dead. Direct blood relatives certainly have an insurable interest in a family member. A business partner can have an insurable interest in another business partner. This is a very misunderstood concept. Insurable interest either exists when a policy is issued, or it does not. If an insured is premium financing a policy, and his direct blood relatives are named as the beneficiaries when the policy is issued, then insurable interest is never an issue. If an insured changes ownership of the policy as soon as it is issued, but the beneficiaries are related by blood when the policy was issued, there is no insurable interest issues. Life insurance is personal property. It is like a car, a home or any other asset that you own. You have the right to pledge it, sell it or change ownership of it as long as it was issued with the death benefit going to a blood relative or related party, that benefits by having you alive, rather than dead. Recent court cases have been hearing arguments from insurance carriers regarding the sale, or transfer of ownership of policies in courts around the nation (circa 2010) by insureds that have sold their policies to investors. The courts have overwhelmingly found in favor of the insureds, finding that insurable interest existed at the time the policy was issued, and there for the right to sell or transfer the policy after issuance was the choice of the insured enjoyed by any asset holder. Many life insurance carriers have tried, and generally unsuccessfully, to challenge these sales based on insurable interest or by trying to prove that the insured \\"intended\\" to sell the policy. The courts have found that \\"intent\\" is irrelevant, when insurable interest exists at policy issuance.  Current environment  Premium financing arrangements were under intense scrutiny. In-force financed policies are being called for collateral in large numbers. Clients who are \\"underwater,\\" where the loan balance exceeds the policy cash value, are being forced to post additional collateral at low risk-weighted rates and/or surrender the policies and pay the outstanding loan balance out of pocket. Additionally, several carriers who were active in the financing marketplace have been downgraded, causing large- scale exchanges or surrenders from in-force policies. Currently, premium financing is becoming a more regulated industry. All financing sources must be carrier approved, and most lenders have substantial (billions) in assets. Some are specialized premium finance lenders and most are large institutions. Advisers generally use a preferred premium finance platform to assist in properly structuring and maintaining (servicing on an annual basis) life insurance premium finance cases. *Advisers are increasingly concerned about the structure of premium finance transactions and are more fully utilizing information and professional services to include specialized premium finance platforms. With the more recent advent of indexed universal life insurance policies premium finance transactions are becoming popular for their significant retained capital and potential tax-free retirement accumulation.

Characteristics of the class  Umpqua was a Casco-class monitor intended for service in the shallow bays, rivers, and inlets of the Confederacy. These warships sacrificed armor plate for a shallow draft and were fitted with a ballast compartment designed to lower them in the water during battle to reduce the target they provided enemy guns.  Engineering and construction difficulties  Though the original designs for the Casco- class monitors were drawn by John Ericsson, the final revision was created by Chief Engineer Alban B. Simers following Rear Admiral Samuel F. Du Pont's failed bombardment of Fort Sumter in 1863. By the time that the plans were put before the Monitor Board in New York City, Ericsson and Simers had a poor relationship, and Chief of the Bureau of Construction and Repair John Lenthall had little connection to the board. This resulted in the plans being approved and 20 vessels ordered without serious scrutiny of the new design. $14 million US was allocated for the construction of these vessels. It was discovered that Simers had failed to compensate for the armor his revisions added to the original plan and this resulted in excessive stress on the wooden hull frames and a freeboard of only 3 inches. Simers was removed from the control of the project and Ericsson was called in to undo the damage. He was forced to raise the hulls of the monitors under construction by 22 inches to make them seaworthy. As a result, the Navy Department ordered on 24 June 1864 that Umpqua's deck be raised to provide sufficient freeboard. Upon delivery, the monitor was laid up at Mound City, IL; and she saw no commissioned service. In August 1868, she was moved to New Orleans, LA. Her name was changed to Fury on 15 June 1869, but she resumed the name Umpqua on 10 August 1869.  Decommissioning and sale  Umpqua was sold at New Orleans on 12 September 1874 to Nathaniel McKay.

The term is generally used in situations where the way in which the punch has been delivered is considered unfair or unethical, and is done using deception or distraction, hence the term 'sucker' used to refer to the victim. In boxing, a sucker punch‚Äîas is done when 'hitting on the break', for example‚Äîis illegal. For example, when James Butler knocked Richard Grant unconscious after losing a fight to him on points, his license was suspended. It is often thrown from behind‚Äîsuch as in the 'knockout game'‚Äîalthough striking from behind is not a prerequisite for a sucker punch. As a crime During 2013 and 2014, significant media attention was paid to two violent killings involving one-hit punches in Australia. Noting that 91 people had died in Australia in the previous fourteen years from brain trauma as a result of being so hit, a media campaign was launched to refer to them as coward punches. This campaign was supported by the New South Wales Government. The term \\"sucker punch\\" was widely discussed after the New York Jets' starting quarterback, Geno Smith, was sucker punched by a fellow player, IK Enemkpali, on August 11, 2015. The altercation was in the locker room about compensation regarding a $600 airplane ticket. Culture and media The sucker punch has been adapted into many films, video games and other forms of media. It can be used to show the antagonist's vileness, the low morals of an anti-hero, betrayal of someone close to the protagonist, etc. However, it also can be used as a weapon of the protagonist to deal with an unfair situation.In the Lucas Arts 1992 game Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, page 7 of the game manual states, \\"In most cases, you can 'sucker punch' your opponent and win the fight. Keep in mind that you don't get IQ points for using this option.\\" A sucker punch is a major dramatic element in the 2004 film Million Dollar Baby. There are also several videos depicting sucker punches on video- sharing websites such as YouTube, however YouTube forbids such content as a violation of its Community Guidelines and are thus not supposed to be on there. Australian soap operas Neighbours and Home and Away have covered the topic in storylines broadcast in September 2014 and October 2015 respectively. In the Pok√©mon game series, a move has the English name of Sucker Punch. It is a Dark-type move that allows the user to attack before the other Pok√©mon has a chance to, provided that the targeted Pok√©mon is going to attack in that same turn. P. J. O'Rourke has referred to a combination of grain alcohol and Gatorade as \\"sucker punch.\\" The Norwegian singer Sigrid has a song entitled \\"Sucker Punch\\" in her debut studio album of the same name. Prevention techniques Sucker punches tend to be done after employing distraction tactics such as pretending to notice something to trick the victim into looking also, having an accomplice to distract the victim, looking away to get the victim's guard down, or pretending to walk away only to turn around and deliver the strike. As sucker punches rely on a deception they can often be anticipated using methods such as: * holding out the arms in a non-threatening manner, colloquially referred to as 'the fence' in many self-defense circles and communities. Many security personnel‚Äîsuch as those who work as doormen or 'bouncers'‚Äîare trained to do this. * scanning the hands of the potential aggressor for signs of impending violence - such as clenching of the fists or the holding of a weapon, such as a knife * watching the aggressor for sudden movements, or an abrupt de-escalation of conflict, which is often used as a distraction technique. Sucker punches are commonly performed using either a hook-type punch, or a haymaker-type punch, as these are more damaging than straight shots due to the increased distance traveled thus enabling more time for acceleration. Because sucker punches come unexpectedly, people at risk of such blows must be alert to the proximity of potential opponents.

As an officer, in 1944 he was in command of the Allied military mission to the Greek resistance in Thessaly and Macedonia. There he came to know those regions thoroughly. He published a memoir of his war service entitled Venture into Greece in 1983; he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and the Greek Order of the Phoenix. In the postwar period, Hammond returned to academia as senior tutor at Clare College, Cambridge. In 1954, he became headmaster of Clifton College, Bristol and in 1962 was appointed Henry Overton Wills Professor of Greek at Bristol University, a post which he held until his retirement in 1973. He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1968British Academy Fellowship entry and an honorary member of the Centre des Nouvelles √©tudes de l'histoire, de la philosophie et des probl√®mes sociaux √† Clermont-Ferrand in 1988. His scholarship focused on the history of ancient Macedonia and Epirus, and he was considered the leading expert on Macedonia. He was also editor and contributor to various volumes of the Cambridge Ancient History and the second edition of the Oxford Classical Dictionary. He was known for his works about Alexander the Great and for suggesting the relationship of Vergina with Aegae, the ancient Macedonian royal city, before the archaeological discoveries. Personal life Hammond was the father of two sons (both educated at Clifton College) and a daughter Caroline Bammel, a noted historian of the early church.

In 1154, Roger II died and the kingdom of Sicily passed to his fourth son, William I. William dispossessed his half-brother Simon immediately, claiming that Taranto was too important a fief to go to an illegitimate son. Simon held a grudge against the king and was called upon by Matthew Bonnellus to lead the revolt in the capital city of Palermo in 1161. This Simon did, with his nephew, Tancred of Lecce, the bastard son of Roger of Apulia, on 9 March. Simon and Tancred invaded the palace, detained King William, Queen Margaret, and their two sons, and incited a massacre of Muslims. Originally, the older of the king's sons, Roger IV, Duke of Apulia, was destined to be crowned in place of William, but soon the populace supported the accession of Simon himself. Before Simon could put himself forward as a candidate, however, the rebellion had broken down and the people were restless. The insurrectionists were forced to free the king and retreat to their castles. Pardon was given them on condition of exile and many, including Simon, took the offer. Simon did not try to seize the crown on William's death in 1166, as had been feared. Instead, the new king's uncle, Henry, Count of Montescaglioso, laid claim to Taranto and all of Simon's former territories. References *Norwich, John Julius. The Kingdom in the Sun 1130-1194\\\\.

The castle later served as a residence of the Prince-Bishops of Halberstadt. The adjacent settlement was mentioned as a town (civitas) in the 13th century, when it had been fortified with defensive walls and city gates. The ruling Ascanian counts ceded their fief in pawn to the Bishop of Halberstadt in 1288 and finally sold it in 1318. Ravaged by the Thirty Years' War, Wegeleben with the Bishopric of Halberstadt passed to Brandenburg-Prussia in 1648.

Design It was developed with the smaller \\"MAB C\\", also made in .32 and .380 ACP, and with which it has many parts in common. Some later examples marked \\"MAB C\\" are actually a combination of a MAB C \\"slide\\" and barrel with a MAB D frame; these are officially an \\"extended grip\\" MAB C but usually called a \\"MAB C/D\\", although are not so marked. The MAB C was primarily a civilian \\"pocket pistol\\", while the larger MAB D was intended for police and military use. The MAB D was used by the French Army and military police before and after World War II. After German forces occupied France, the MAB D was adopted for use by the Wehrmacht (German army) during World War II; these pistols typically have German acceptance marks stamped into the metal. (As with other weapons, it is not uncommon to find forged German acceptance marks on MAB Ds being sold, including incorrect acceptance marks, incorrect placement, and marks on Type II MABs not manufactured until after World War II.) Following World War II, the MAB D was used by the French military in Indochina. In France, it was used by various French governmental agencies, including the French local police, the Gendarmerie (military police and also civilian countryside police), the customs department, the National Forests Office, and the Banque de France. MAB Ds are now only used as surplus pistols for the French police, who primarily used revolvers before 2000. As with other French firearms, MAB Ds were also used by the military and police of the Kingdom of Morocco, a French protectorate. In the years after World War II, German police forces also used the MAB D. There were two MAB D versions, usually called the Type I and Type II. The Type I MAB D was made 1933‚Äì1945 and used an external muzzle bushing release latch in front of the trigger guard; the Type II used an internal \\"bayonet\\" type release requiring pushing in and turning the muzzle bushing. The MAB factory changed from the Type I to Type II production in June 1945. The MAB D pictured with this article is a Type I.

The celebration of May Day is a common motif throughout Europe and beyond. In Cornwall there are a number of notable examples of this practice including the Obby Oss in Padstow and Furry Dance or Flora day in Helston. The celebrations are in contrast to the Cornish midwinter celebrations that occur every year such as the Penzance Montol Festival and the Padstow Mummer's Day festival. Practice before the 20th century  Prior to the 20th century it was common for young residents of the towns of Penzance and St Ives and other nearby settlements to conduct their own festivities. During this festival it was usual to make 'May Horns' usually fashioned from tin cans and 'May Whistles' made from small branches of the sycamore tree. The tree branches also formed decorations for people's homes. The following is from a contemporary description of the events themselves in 1881 collected by Robert Hunt in 'Popular Romances of the West of England Online Transcript of the original The May Horns procession in 2008 revival of the West Cornwall May Day Celebrations in Penzance > THE first of May is inaugurated with much uproar.

Main designer of the SZD-55 was Tadeusz ≈Åabuƒá. Since the mid- eighties, the best glider in the standard class was undoubtedly the German standard Discus, whose excellent performance was attributed to its unusual triple trapeze wing shape. So it was logical to adopt a similar idea for use of this outline of the new construction: the elliptical contour of the wing leading edge. Documentation of the glider was developed in 1987 same as prototypes for factory numbers X-144 (SP-P501) and X-145 (SP-P502) and flew 15.08.1988 and 03.01.1989 by January Roman. Despite enormous difficulties in obtaining advanced materials (carbon fabric, kevlar) and the need for glass- epoxy laminates, the manufacturer managed to create a glider with an unladen weight of just over 200 kg. Klaus Holighaus, one of the finest manufacturers of gliders (Nimbus and Discus family) stated that if using a fiberglass technology PZL Bielsko factory reached less weight than gliders constructed using carbon fiber and Kevlar that means that they developed a new technology.Polskie szybowce 1945-2011 - Problemy rozwoju - This technology was later improved upon during the design and building of the SZD-56 Diana.

Old town ensemble The Altstadt (Old Town) with St. Stephen's Church is a stop on the scenic German Timber-Frame Road and on the Romanesque Road. History The settlement was first mentioned about 780 when Charlemagne in course of the Saxon Wars crossed the Oker river and had a church dedicated to Saint Stephen erected at a place then called Salingenstede. This church became a centre of the Christian mission among the pagan Saxons, overseen by Hildegrim of Ch√¢lons, and the origin of the later Bishopric of Halberstadt. On 1 April 974, Emperor Otto II issued a deed granting market and mint rights to Seligenstadt, this is commonly regarded as the date of the town's foundation. The name Osterwieck was first mentioned in a 1073 letter by Archbishop Liemar of Bremen to Bishop Burchard II of Halberstadt. Destroyed by a blaze in 1511, the town was rebuilt and today features an ensemble of about 400 Fachwerk buildings.

Steuben wrote war novels based on personal experiences in World War I (especially \\"Durchbruch anno achtzehn. Ein Fronterlebnis\\" Stuttgart:Franckh, 1933) and other novels under his birth name.  Biography  Steuben was born in Wongrowitz, Province of Posen. He participated in World War I. After the war he started as a book-seller apprentice and became finally head of production in the publishing house Franckh-Kosmos in Stuttgart. From 1929 until 1952 Steuben wrote stories on American Indians under his pseudonym. The eight volumes of his Tecumseh anthology follow the Shawnee chief Tecumseh from his childhood to his death. In 1937 Steuben moved to Neustrelitz where he lived as an independent writer. In 1955 he moved again to Pinneberg where he died.  Works  Using the pen name Fritz Steuben, initially for his Native American Indian (Tecumseh) stories, he wrote many of his works under the influence of national socialism. However, contrary to the Western novels of Karl May, famous in Germany, yet temporarily discredited by false claims to authenticity, his fiction was based on real persons and comparatively serious use of sources available to him. In Germany his books had already achieved a circulation of 790,000 copies in the Thirties. After the Second World War the Tecumseh-anthology reappeared ideologically cleaned (or at least superficially politically corrected) by Nina Schindler and is still on sale in this form.

With about 270 square kilometers (104 square miles), the collective municipality of the city of Jerichow is one of the largest municipalities in area size in Germany.  Geography  The city of Jerichow lies on an ancient branch of the Elbe River between Stendal and Genthin, 31 miles (50 kilometers) northeast of Magdeburg. The territory of the collective municipality extends from the center of the city to the east along the northern boundary of the District of Jerichower Land to the state boundary of Brandenburg and from there to the south, a strip of land .  Boroughs  On 1 January 2010, the collective municipality (Einheitsgemeinde) of Stadt Jerichow was founded with the following towns and villages: Annenhof, Altbellin, Altenklitsche, Belicke, Blockdamm, Brettin, Dreih√§user, Dunkelforth, Elisenau, Gro√üdemsin, Gro√üwulkow, G√ºssow, Hahnenh√ºtten, Havemark, Hohenbellin, Jungviehhof, Kade, Kader Schleuse, Karow, Kleindemsin, Kleinmangelsdorf, Kleinwulkow, Kleinwusterwitz, Klietznick, Kuxwinkel, Mangelsdorf (which had already merged with Jerichow on 6 August 2002 Statistische √Ñmter des Bundes und der L√§nder [ Statistical Offices of the Federation and Its States ], \\"Gebiets√§nderungen vom 01.01. bis 31.12.2002 [ Changes in the Communities of Germany from 1 January to 31 December 2002 ]\\", DeStatis: Statistisches Bundesamt [ DeStatis : Federal Office of Statistics ], retrieved 29 December 2013. ), Neubuchholz, Neue H√ºtten, Neuenklitsche, Neuredekin, Nielebock, Redekin, Ro√üdorf, Scharteucke, Schlagenthin, Seedorf, Steinitz, Werdershof and Zabakuck as well as the sheep farm, Wilhelmsthal.

Climate  With the annual precipitation of 530 mm, Jerichow has one of the lowest amounts recorded in Germany. At seven percent the weather stations of the Deutscher Wetterdienst (German Weather Service) were registering low numbers. The driest month is February, with most of the rainfall coming in June. In June, the amount of rain is twice the total for February.  History  Jerichow is not named after a Jericho in the Holy Bible of the Christians. Jerichow was actually an Old Slavic word meaning, \\"riverside settlement of the dominant one\\". Oswald Jannermann, Slawische Orts‚Äì und Gew√§ssernamen in Deutschland : Von Belgrad in Pommern bis Zicker auf R√ºgen [ Slavic Place and Water Names in Germany : From Belgrad in Pomerania to Zicker on the R√ºgen ] (Norderstedt: BoD ‚Äì Books on Demand, 2012), , page 13. Wjerch ( \\"peak\\" ) and zwjercha ( \\"on top\\" ) are Lower Sorbian words derived from fercho, the stem word from Old Slavic for \\"above, dominant\\". The suffix, ‚Äìow, is Old Slavic for \\"water-place\\". There used to be a castle backed by a man-made tributary of the Elbe River, but today only a lump of earth remains with the name of Burgberg (lit. Castle Hill). Jerichow was mentioned for the first time at the end of 1144 by the documents. The occasion was the foundation of the Jerichow Monastery of the Premonstratensian canons with the donation of Hartwig von Stade, the canon of the Cathedral of Magdeburg (with the confirmation from the Holy Roman Emperor, Conrad III of Germany). In the following year, the Premonstratensian canons came from the Kloster Unser Lieben Frauen (Monastery of the Blessed Virgin Mary) in Magdeburg to settle in the town center but, in 1148, they moved to the present location because of the disturbing bustle of the town's marketplace. They built between 1149 and 1172 the collegiate church as a basilica with three naves as well as the east wing of the cloister. These buildings are considered as important works of the Romanesque brick style, the oldest of its kind east of the Elbe River. They would serve for centuries as the landmark for the surrounding areas. In the 13th Century Jerichow received the city charter (Stadtrecht). In 1336 the town was completely destroyed by the flooding from the Elbe River but it was rebuilt and founded in its present location by a local nobleman, Johann III von Buch.

However, its former location is still marked by a deep trench lined with ancient walls of brick. W.

Around 1530, with the Reformation, the Lutheran doctrine took hold of the town and, in 1552, the Monastery was secularized by Hans von Krusemark; a part of the convent's building was reserved for the Elector of Brandenburg's domains. During the Thirty Years War, the Imperial and Swedish armies devastated the village and monastery of Jerichow in 1631. Since 1680, along with the Duchy of Magdeburg, Jerichow belonged to the Electorate of Brandenburg and later the Kingdom of Prussia and to the former Jerichower District. In 1684 and 1685, the Monastery's church was repaired by the order of the Great Elector, Frederick William, to be used as a new Reformed church for the Huguenot refugees. In 1806, Napoleon and his Grande Arm√©e captured the city of Magdeburg and added to the Kingdom of Westphalia, with his brother J√©r√¥me Bonaparte as the King, but the eastern boundary of the new Kingdom stopped at the Elbe River. Jerichow was on the other side of the Elbe so it remained Prussian for the rest of the French occupation (1806‚Äì1814). From 1853 to 1856, at the request of King Frederick William IV of Prussia, Ferdinand von Quast restored the Monastery Church. Around 1870 the convent building was used as a brewery and a distillery. In the present time, there was an extensive renovation of the Monastery Church with the considerable restoration of the Romanesque appearance. With a series of administrative reorganizations, Jerichow remained in the Kingdom of Prussia until 1918, when it became German. At the end of the Napoleonic wars, it was assigned to Landkreis Jerichow II but its district's name was changed in 1952 to Landkreis Genthin and in 1994 to Landkreis Jerichower Land. Jerichow has been a part of the state of Saxony-Anhalt since the 1990 reunification of Germany. = Political Administration = * 1180‚Äì1680 : Holy Roman Empire, Prince-Archbishopric of Magdeburg, (at least since 1588) Amt (District of) Jerichow * 1680‚Äì1701 : Electorate of Brandenburg-Prussia, Province of the Duchy of Magdeburg, Amt Jerichow * 1701‚Äì1816 : Kingdom of Prussia, Province of the Duchy of Magdeburg, Amt Jerichow * 1816‚Äì1918 : Kingdom of Prussia, Province of Saxony, Regierungsbezirk Magdeburg, Kreis (District of) Jerichow II Rolf Jenke, compiler, Territoriale Ver√§nderungen in Deutschland und deutsch verwalteten Gebieten 1874 ‚Äì 1945 [ Territorial Changes in Germany and German-Administrated Areas 1874 ‚Äì 1945 ], retrieved 29 December 2013. * 1918‚Äì1944 : Germany, Province of Saxony, Regierungsbezirk Magdeburg, Kreis (Landkreis since 1939) Jerichow II * 1944‚Äì1945 : Germany, Province of Magdeburg, Landkreis Jerichow II * 1945‚Äì1949 : (Soviet Occupation) Province of Saxony-Anhalt, Landkreis Jerichow II * 1949‚Äì1952 : German Democratic Republic, State of Saxony-Anhalt, Landkreis Genthin * 1952‚Äì1990 : German Democratic Republic, Bezirk Magdeburg, Landkreis Genthin * 1990‚Äì1994 : Germany, State of Saxony-Anhalt, Regierungsbezirk Magdeburg, Landkreis Jerichow II * 1994‚Äì2004 : Germany, State of Saxony-Anhalt, Regierungsbezirk Magdeburg, Landkreis Jerichower Land * 2004‚Äìpresent : Germany, State of Saxony-Anhalt, Landkreis Jerichower Land  Heraldry  = Coat of arms = The coat-of-arms of the collective municipality of Stadt Jerichow was approved on 11 May 2011 by the authorities of the Landkreis Jerichower Land.

Blason: \\"In blue two silver towers with golden tipped and pitched roofs, arched windows, sound holes and ledges, between them a silver nave with a golden roof, with windows and cornices. The towers were accompanied by two golden ears. The golden bottom of the shield is covered with a wavy blue bar.\\" The coat-of-arms, designed by the municipal heraldist J√∂rg Mantzsch, presents in the middle the stylized collegiate church of the Jerichow Monastery with a wavy bar at the bottom. The wavy bar symbolizes the Elbe River, which had, from the earliest times, significant importance to the history of the town. Two accompanying ears, each with eleven grains, are the reference to the formerly independent eleven towns that are now united in the Collective Municipality with Jerichow, and to agriculture, their main industry for many centuries.

The colors of the town are white and blue.Current coat-of- arms of Jerichow Current coat of arms of the town of Jerichow Blason: \\"On the blue field St. George in an silver armor, in his right hand a silver cross- tipped lance, on his left side holding a shield divided in red and silver, with a silver double-towered church in the upper half; on his right side, a golden dragon.'' Until 1999 Jerichow did not have an official coat-of-arms but for centuries it had used as its temporary symbol the changing image of St. George in his armor with the lance and the dragon. From Christian iconography, numerous incarnations of St. George have survived. The earliest seals showed him dressed in a simple robe and standing on the downed and pierced dragon; only in the Middle Ages and then again towards the end of the 19th Century, he was transformed into a knight, complete with a set of armor, a helmet, a shield and more. It is assumed that Jerichow's coat-of-arms also underwent another change because, in 1779, it had a different description. In the archives of the Jerichow Monastery, there is a file with the title \\"Nachrichten von der Stadt Jerichow de Anno 1779\\" (News from the Town of Jerichow for the Year 1779). In this file, the Mayor answered various questions about the town. The thirty-first question is, \\"Was die Stadt im Wappen f√ºhre?\\" (What would the town have in the coat-of-arms?); the answer: \\"Den Ritter St. Georg der den Lindwurm ersticht \\" ‚Äì The knight St. George stabbing the dragon. Old archival documents from 1779: \\"In Jerichow ist die Stadtkirche dem Heiligen Georg geweiht; hierin erkl√§rt sich der Zusammenhang zum Wappenbild. Erste bildliche Zeugnisse des Jerichower Wappens zeigen eine recht naturalistische Darstellung mit Beiwerk und in falschen Tinkturen\\" (In Jerichow the town church is dedicated to St. George, which explains the image on the coat-of-arms. The first visual evidence of Jerichow's coat-of-arms shows a fairly naturalistic representation with accessories and in incorrect tinctures). The redesign of the coat-of-arms was undertaken in 1999 by the municipal heraldist (Kommunalheraldiker) :de:J√∂rg Mantzsch J√∂rg Mantzsch.Former coat-of-arms of Jerichow Former Coat-of-arms of Jerichow Blason (former coat-of-arms): ‚ÄúIn blue on the green ground a knight in silver armor, in his right hand a silver cross-tipped lance, in his left hand a red and silver divided shield with a black fess of twin merlons, on the right side, a snarling brown dragon, on both sides green plants with red petals.‚Äù The coat-of-arms of Jerichow conformed to the common laws. About the connection between the contents of the coat-of-arms, there is not any reliable information. But the fess of merlons in the little shield is meant to symbolize the Premonstratensian collegiate church. = Flag = The flag of the Collective Municipality of Stadt Jerichos is striped in blue-white-blue (1:4:1) (short form: stripes running horizontally; long form: stripes running vertically) and occupied in the middle by the coat-of-arms of the collective municipality. = Flag of the Municipality = The flag is striped blue-white- blue and overlaid with the coat-of-arms of Stadt Jerichow.

Economy  For centuries, agriculture, crafts, breweries and inns were the lifeblood of Jerichow. In 1837, Jerichow had 1,400 residents, a Royal forester and a Royal administrator.

In 1894, Jerichow had its own post office as well as a district court. In 1899, a train station was constructed to connect Jerichow with Genthin and Sch√∂nhausen. The Industrial Revolution came in the 19th Century, leading to the decline of the crafts as well as the economic importance of Jerichow, but the fortunes of the town were revived in 1899 with the establishment of a provincial hospital in the middle of the nearby pine forest. The hospital, with the additions of a psychiatric ward in 1902 and a tuberculosis sanatorium in 1928, soon became an important employer of the town. Today, after an extensive modernization and expansion in 1991, it operates as an AWO (workers' Welfare) hospital AWO Krankenhausbetriebsgesellschaft, \\"AWO Fachkrankenhaus Jerichow besteht seit 110 Jahren [ AWO Specialty Hospital Exists for 110 Years ]\\", Pressemitteilungen der AWO Krankenhausbetriebsgesellschaft mbH [ Press Releases of the AWO Hospital Operations, Inc. ], retrieved 29 December 2013. specializing in psychiatry, psychotherapy, neurosciences and psychotherapeutic medicine. In the town, certain agricultural, artistic and small businesses remain. A housing development was built northwest of Jerichow between 1934 and 1938. Since the end of World War II, the businesses, as well as the train station, have become the major partners of the hospital.  Transport  Jerichow was until 1999 the main train station of the branch line of the rail system of Saxony-Anhalt. The routes to Sch√∂nhausen, Genthin and G√ºsen were built by the Kleinbahn-AG in Genthin. At the same time Jerichow had a maintenance depot for the railcars of the DR-Baureihe VT 2.09 series and their successors.

As such, the burgward was obliged by a document from Otto I the Great in 948 to pay a tithe to the Magdeburg Moritz monastery. This document is considered to be the first mention of the place. At this period, a fortress was built on the site of the old Slavic settlement, and its keep is still part of the fortress today. The castle served as an outpost to protect Magdeburg and secured the important roads to Brandenburg and Zerbst. In 955, Otto I is supposed to have founded M√∂ckern's parish church, following his victory over Hungary on August 10 of that year. Because that day is (St. Lawrence Day), the church was named for the saint. In the 11th century, M√∂ckern acquired a defensive wall (made of boulders since the 12th century), which was equipped with three gates. M√∂ckern already had its town charter. Over the centuries, the sovereignty of M√∂ckern took several twists and turns. In the 12th century, the Margrave of Brandenburg had sovereignty, but in 1196, Otto II, Margrave of Brandenburg gave it to the bishopric of Magdeburg. By the 14th century, M√∂ckern had become the property of Quedlinburg Abbey, which, with the town as a manor, the Count of Arnstein mortgaged. In 1376, the abbey gave Brandenburg back its sovereignty. After that, M√∂ckern was mortgaged several times, including to a family of nobles and to the bishopric of Magdeburg. In 1472, after several trials, the Prince-Elector of Brandenburg renounced the bishopric in favor of his vassal. Ownership of the fief then went to the Counts of Arnstein-Lindow, who held it till 1524, when they died out. In 1710, ownership went to Christian Wilhelm von Munchausen and in 1742, to another family, which held it until 1945. In the 17th century, the town suffered heavy damage from an occupation in 1626 during the Thirty Years' War and a conflagration in 1688. After 1680, the city belonged to the Brandenburg- Prussian Duchy of Magdeburg and was part of the former district of Jerichow. A new town hall was built in 1700 and in 1715, M√ºnchhausen built a new castle to replace the old fortress. His successor, William Hagen, added on to the castle in 1840. A series of heavy clashes between allied Prusso-Russian troops and the Napoleonic French army south of M√∂ckern ended in defeat for the French on April 5, 1813. This became the prelude to the war of liberation against Napoleon and is known as the Battle of M√∂ckern.Wars of Liberation, German part After Prussia's final victory, the kingdom re-organized the district administration. This brought M√∂ckern into the newly formed Jerichower Land district, with Burg as the urban district. The town had previously been a farming town with breweries and open air markets, but and infrastructure began to develop with saw mills, a steam mill and a starch factory, spurred by the opening of a rail line in 1892 between Magdeburg and Loburg. In 1895, the former town hall was replaced by a three-story Renaissance-style building. At the end of the 19th century, M√∂ckern had more than 1,700 inhabitants.  Modern times  The relative prosperity of the town was reflected in the private construction that began in the second half of the 19th century and continued till the beginning of World War I. A row of new streets was built in the western part of town, some with Jugendstil houses. On May 5, 1945 M√∂ckern was occupied by the Red Army, taking the lives of 42 residents. After the end of World War II the Soviet occupying forces instituted a land reform, confiscating land held by nobility. The Hagen family lost the M√∂ckern castle and a branch of the State Archives Magdeburg was installed there. Territorial reform in 1952 placed M√∂ckern first in the Loburg urban district and later back in the Burg district. In 1964, M√∂ckern had a population of 2,904. In the 1960s, a large poultry factory was established, among the largest of its kind in East Germany. After the German reunification, the plant was taken over by a corporate group, securing 400 jobs for the town. Another major employer manufactures laminate flooring which is sold throughout Europe. The former castle owners, the Hagens, also prospered and in 1991, they returned to M√∂ckern and re-purchased parts of their former property. The castle, which remained town property, became M√∂ckern's elementary school in 1998, after the state archives moved out. The town administration of M√∂ckern has been joined with the administration of other towns since 1991. In 2005, despite significant local protest, a remote facility for mentally incompetent criminals was established on a former army base in the Lochow section of town. On 1 January 2009 the villages of K√ºsel Tryppehna and Zeddenick became part of the town, as did Magdeburgerforth on 2 July the same year.

In the ensuing battle, young Roger was killed, by a wayward arrow to the eye. An alternative theory, advanced by William's enemy Falcandus, is that Roger died after repeated kicking by his father, who was in a rage at having been betrayed by his son.

They are so named for their scent, which reportedly smells like a mink. The scent is more akin to that of rotting onions to those unfamiliar with mink. It is also sometimes referred to as the north frog.  Description  The mink frog is a small frog, growing up to . The dorsum is generally green in color, with darker green and brown blotching and the belly is a cream, yellow, or white. They are sexually dimorphic in that males typically have a bright yellow colored throat, while females have a white colored throat, and the tympanum of the male is larger than the eye, while the female's is smaller than or the same size as the eye. The frogs have a pale-colored underside and bright green lips.  Ecology and behavior  The mink frog is predominantly aquatic, living among the vegetation (especially among lily pads) in ponds, swamps, and streams around wooded areas. They feed on a wide variety of things, including spiders, snails, beetles, and other invertebrates. As tadpoles they consume primarily algae and decaying plant matter. = Reproduction = Mating generally takes place in late spring and early summer. These frogs prefer cold, well-oxygenated wetland breeding sites where during the late night hours, but occasionally during the day, males call to attract females while floating on the water's surface or partially resting on floating vegetation. Between 500 and 4000 eggs can be laid by the female at any one time, generally in deep water. Egg masses are usually found close to floating vegetation and hatch within days of being deposited. Tadpoles remain in the larval stage for approximately one year before metamorphosing into froglets. Maturity is reached in a year for males, and two years for females.  Geographic range  Mink frogs are found in the United States in the states of Minnesota, New Hampshire, Wisconsin, Michigan, Maine, Vermont, and New York. They are also found in Canada in the provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Quebec, Ontario, and Manitoba. This largely aquatic frog's southern range limit is at the highest latitude of any North American frog and there is evidence that more southern populations of this frog became extinct within the past century.  Conservation status  In recent years, it seems that the general populations of mink frogs are in decline.Harding, J. (1997) Amphibians and Reptiles of the Great Lakes Region. MI: The University of Michigan Press . In a 1999 study conducted by David Gardiner and David Hoppe it was noted that there was an increase in mink frog deformities. \\"The spectrum of deformities includes missing limbs, truncated limbs, extra limbs (including extra pelvic girdles), and skin webbings. We also describe a newly recognized malformation of the proximal-distal limb axis, a bony triangle. In this abnormality, the proximal and distal ends of the bone are adjacent to one another forming the base of a triangle. The shaft of the bone is bent double and protrudes laterally, the midpoint of the bone forming the apex of the triangle.\\" The study comes to the conclusion that these deformities are a result of exposure to exogenous retinoids, but more study is needed to make a sure determination.

LTDF was subordinate to the authorities of Nazi Germany and Its goal was to fight the approaching Red Army, provide security and conduct Nazi security warfare within the territory, claimed by Lithuanians (see also Nazi German occupation of Lithuania, Generalbezirk Litauen of Reichskommissariat Ostland). LTDF had some autonomy and was staffed by Lithuanian officers, their most notable commander being Lithuanian General Povilas Plechaviƒçius. LTDF quickly reached the size of about 10,000 men. After brief engagements against the Soviet and Polish partisans (Armia Krajowa), the force self-disbanded, its leaders were arrested and sent to concentration camps, and numerous of its members were executed by the Nazis. Many others were either drafted into other Nazi auxiliary services or started forming an armed anti-Soviet resistance, also known as Forest Brothers. The Union of Soldiers of the Lithuanian Territorial Defense Force (Lietuvos vietinƒós rinktinƒós kari≈≥ sƒÖjunga), a veterans organization, was founded in 1997. Earlier mobilisation attempts In the beginning of 1943 Nazi occupational government attempted to raise a Waffen-SS division from the local population as they had in many other countries, but the mobilization was boycotted by the Lithuanians with less than 300 men reporting. The Nazis carried out reprisals against the population and deported 46 prominent figures and members of the intelligentsia to the Stutthof concentration camp. All Lithuanian higher education institutions were closed by the Nazis on March 18‚Äì19. In summer 1943, an \\"All Lithuanian Conference\\", sponsored by the Nazi authorities, allowed for a more successful mobilization campaign. This resulted in the creation of an armed force, that would only act in the territory claimed by Lithuania and would be commanded only by Lithuanian officers. Creation After the Germans suffered losses in the Eastern Front and the Red Army was approaching, Lithuanian General Povilas Plechaviƒçius used the opportunity and continued the negotiations with the Germans. The Nazis finally agreed to create units of Vietinƒó rinktinƒó. The soldiers would wear Lithuanian insignia on their uniforms. Most of his demands were not met, notably a request to transfer officers from police battalions. German Zivilverwaltung agreed not to transfer Lithuanian youth to German labor camps while LTDF was active. At first the plans called for 21 battalions, 250-strong each. Later by Plechaviƒçius' demands the quota was increased to 10,000 men. All the Lithuanian political underground organizations supported formation of LTDF. The formal agreement was signed on February 13, 1944 and on February 16, 1944, the Lithuanian Independence Day, Plechaviƒçius made a radio appeal to the nation for volunteers. The appeal was very successful and estimates put the number of volunteers between 20,000 and 30,000. Eventually the LTDF had a peak strength of about 10,000 men, assigned to 14 battalions. Thirteen battalions were fully formed with 750 men each and the 14th battalion was an officers training battalion in Marijampolƒó. In Nazi manner they were numbered as police battalions 301‚Äì310 and 312‚Äì314. The process of creation was not smooth because Germans did not trust the LTDF. They ordered reorganization of already formed battalions of four companies into battalions of three companies, and were constantly delaying delivery of arms, munitions, means of transportation and communication. Because SS did not trust the Lithuanian officers, they demanded that German officers, called Zahlmeisters, would be inserted into LTDF units. An oath, similar to one used by the Lithuanian armed forces, was prepared. The oath was altered by SS and Police Chief Hermann Harm to include a personal oath to Hitler. Knowing that such an oath is not acceptable to soldiers of LTDF, the ceremony was delayed every time and the oath was not taken until the formation self-disbanded.  Dissent  The Germans were surprised by the number of volunteers as their previous appeals went unheeded. Possibly perceiving the growing popularity of the unit as a threat, they started to interfere, going against the signed agreement. On March 22, 1944, SS Obergruppenf√ºhrer and SD General Friedrich Jeckeln called for 70‚Äì80 thousand subsidiary assistants for the German army. Chief-of-Staff of the Northern Front Field Marshal Walther Model further demanded that the Lithuanians provide personnel for 15 security battalions for the military airports. General Commissioner of Lithuania Adrian von Renteln added his demand for laborers to be sent to work in Germany. They were not the only German officials to issue demands for Lithuanian recruits. Plechaviƒçius rejected and resisted such demands. On April 6, 1944, Plechaviƒçius was given an order to mobilize the entire country. He refused, saying that it is impossible until the formation of his existing detachment was finished; this increased the Germans displeasure with him. In late April, as the German plans to mobilize Lithuanians into the German armed forces became obvious, Plechaviƒçius secretly started organizing Tƒóvynƒós Apsaugos Rinktinƒó, an underground armed forces, which would include Lithuanian Army officers, veterans of the Lithuanian Wars of Independence, and former members of Lithuanian Riflemen Union. All across Lithuania, a network was secretly organized by territorial LTDF officers. The plans were to assemble around 75‚Äì80 thousand men. Most of the organizational structure was laid, and it served as a basis for the armed anti-Soviet resistance. Activities The mission of the LTDF was to defend the country against the approaching Soviet Red Army. Since the Red Army had not entered the Lithuanian lands to which LTDF was confined, the force was used instead to aid the Nazis in their operations against Soviet and Polish partisans operating in the Lithuanian territory. In April, the Polish Armia Krajowa (AK) in the Vilnius Region attempted to begin negotiations with Plechaviƒçius, proposing a non-aggression pact and cooperation against the Nazi Germany. The Lithuanian side refused and demanded that the Poles either abandon the Vilnius Region (disputed between Poles and Lithuanians) or subordinate themselves to the Lithuanians in their struggle against the Soviets. In early May, the LTDF initiated a widespread anti-partisan operation against the Polish and Soviet partisans in the area. Seven battalions were dispatched to man the garrisons in and around the towns of Oszmiana (modern A≈°miany) and Holszany (modern Hal≈°any), notably the villages of Murowana Oszmianka (Muravanaya Ashmyanka) and Grau≈ºyszki (Grau≈æi≈°kƒós, –ì—Ä–∞—û–∂—ã—à–∫—ñ), To≈Çminowo (–¢–∞–ª–º—ñ–Ω–∞–≤–∞, –ì—Ä–æ–¥–∑—ñ–Ω—Å–∫—ñ —Å–µ–ª—å—Å–∞–≤–µ—Ç) and Nowosi√≥≈Çki (–ù–∞–≤–∞—Å—ë–ª–∫—ñ). LTDF units committed atrocities against Polish civilians, notably in Paw≈Ç√≥w (Merkinƒó village in ≈†alƒçininkai District), Grau≈ºyszki and Sienkowszczyzna (–°–µ–Ω–∫–∞—û—à—á—ã–Ω–∞, –ö–∞–ª—å—á—É–Ω—Å–∫—ñ —Å–µ–ª—å—Å–∞–≤–µ—Ç). However, the Polish resistance fought back. On May 4, the 3rd Brigade of AK intercepted and destroyed a company of the Lithuanian 310th Battalion which attempted to pacify the Polish village of Paw≈Çowo. At Grau≈ºyszki, the Lithuanian 301st Battalion suffered 47 casualties, and on May 5 was dispersed by the 8th and 12th Brigades of the Armia Krajowa. On May 6, the 8th, 9th and 13th Brigades of AK defeated two companies of the Lithuanian 308th Battalion, which were burning the villages of Sienkowszczyzna and Adamkowszyczyzna and murdering their inhabitants. Most notably, the Polish resistance organized a concentrated assault against the fortified Lithuanian positions around the village of Murowana Oszmianka. The defenses, reinforced with concrete bunkers and trenches, were manned by the 301st Battalion of the LTDF. During the night of May 13‚Äì14, the 3rd Brigade of the AK assaulted the village from the west and north-west, while the 8th and 12th Brigades attacked from the south and east. The remainder of the Polish forces (13th and 9th Brigades) secured the Murowana Oszmianka ‚Äì To≈Çminowo road. During the battle, the Lithuanian force lost 60 men, while 170 were taken prisoner of war. Another 117 Lithuanian soldiers were taken prisoner later that night in the nearby village of To≈Çminowo. After the battle all Lithuanian prisoners were disarmed and set free with only their long johns and helmets on. The Poles used the element of surprise because the Lithuanians had around 150 more soldiers. The disparity in size, and the fact that Lithuanians no longer felt safe inside their own barracks, only added to the importance of the defeat. Liquidation Since March Germans constantly attempted to use LTDF to mobilize Lithuanians for labor in Germany, Wehrmacht, and Hilfswillige, but such attempts were blocked by Plechaviƒçius. As tensions between Germans and LTDF were growing, Plechaviƒçius even sent a resignation request and suggested to demobilise LTDF on April 12. Demands and tension continued to grow. At the end of April, Plechaviƒçius secretly blocked creation of a list of conscripts into the German army. He opposed the mobilization, announced at the beginning of May (it was supposed to be completed on May 8). The mobilization failed completely, when only 3‚Äì5% of men of conscription age reported to the German authorities. Most of them were not fit for the military service. Plechaviƒçius had personally ordered his officers in territorial branches to ignore the mobilization order. Since April the Germans were considering transforming LTDF into an auxiliary police service of the SS. On May 9, 1944, after the unsuccessful attempt of mobilisation, Friedrich Jeckeln ordered the detachment units in the Vilnius Region to recognize his direct authority. All other units of LTDF were to become subordinates of the regional German commanders. Jeckeln demanded the troops to take an oath to Hitler. Furthermore, the detachment was to wear SS uniforms and use the Heil Hitler greeting. Upon hearing this order, and being informed that it was signed by Jeckeln as early as April 15, Plechaviƒçius opposed this challenge to his authority and rejected the demands. On May 9, he immediately ordered cadets, training in Marijampolƒó, to return home. He also ordered LTDF battalions in the Vilnius Region to stop hostilities with AK forces and return to the assigned garrisons. Plechaviƒçius issued a declaration for his men to disband and disappear into the forests with their weapons and uniforms. The Lithuanian headquarters directed the detachment units in the field to obey only the orders of the Lithuanian chain of command. On May 12, Plechaviƒçius refused to meet with newly appointed Kurt Hintze and sent his chief of staff Urbonas, who told Hintze that Plechaviƒçius never meant to be an SS officer, nor ever wanted to serve in this structure. Jeckeln also suggested that LTDF would fight in the Western Front, but Plechaviƒçius refused. The failures of the operation against the Polish Armia Krajowa resistance, culminating in the LTDF defeat in the Battle of Murowana Oszmianka on May 13‚Äì14, gave the Germans another excuse to assert their control over the formation. Persecutions Plechaviƒçius and his chief of staff Colonel Oskaras Urbonas, were arrested on May 15. Jeckeln and Hintze delivered a speech before the remaining LTDF officers accusing them of banditry, sabotage, and political agenda and threatening them with executions and transfers to concentration camps. Jeckeln announced that LTDF was to be disbanded and disarmed. Soldiers of the LTDF would be transferred to German air defence forces. Anyone who would desert would be shot on sight, causing repressions against their families. Together with other members of the LTDF staff Plechaviƒçius was deported to the Salaspils concentration camp in Latvia. Altogether, 52 LTDF officers ended up in Salaspils, 106 cadets in Stutthof, and 983 soldiers in Oldenburg concentration camps. To make an example, the Nazis shot about 100 former LTDF members, and publicly executed 12 randomly selected soldiers in a Vilnius line-up which consisted of some 800 men. 84 or 86 members of LTDF were shot in Paneriai. While transporting some of the arrested men to Kaunas, one of the prisoners escaped. In retaliation, the Germans then selected NCO Ruseckas for execution on the spot. Since the German regular army guards were stalling the execution, an SS officer did the actual shooting. Most of the soldiers were to be disarmed and arrested by the Germans, but they succeeded disarming only 4 out of 14 battalions. On May 16 German units arrived to liquidate Marijampolƒó officers school, but found only a dozen soldiers; after an attempt to disarm them a firefight started and 4 or 5 soldiers were killed. About 3,500 members of the LTDF were by force drafted into other Nazi formations: several infantry battalions under Colonel Birontas were sent to the Eastern Front, some became guards at Luftwaffe installations outside Lithuania, others were sent to Germany as forced laborers. Many soldiers who managed to evade the Germans, disappeared with their weapons. They formed the core of the armed anti-Soviet resistance, which waged a guerrilla war for the next eight years. Covert Soviet plans for the destruction of the remnants of Plechaviƒçius' army were already created in 1944 and the Soviets would execute or imprison LTDF soldiers they captured. LTDF was the last large mobilization attempt by the Nazis.

Operational history At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Asagumo was assigned to Destroyer Division 9 (Desdiv 9), and a member of Destroyer Squadron 4 (Desron 4) of the IJN 2nd Fleet, escorting Admiral Nobutake Kond≈ç's Southern Force Main Body out of Mako Guard District as distant cover to the Malaya and Philippines invasion forces in December 1941. In early 1942, Asagumo escorted troop convoys to Lingayen, Tarakan, Balikpapan and Makassar in the Netherlands East Indies. During the Battle of the Java Sea, she assisted in sinking the British destroyer , but suffered several hits and the temporary disabling of her engines from the British ship, which killed four crewmen and wounded 19 others. On 18 March, after emergency repairs at Balikpapan, she escorted the repair ship Yamabiko Maru to Makassar, and returned at the end of the month to the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal for repairs. At the end of May, Asagumo joined the escort for the Midway Invasion Force during the Battle of Midway. In July, she was sent to northern waters, patrolling from ≈åminato Guard District towards the Kurile Islands. Afterwards, she was sent south to Truk together with the cruiser , and onwards to Kwajalein, returning to Yokosuka on 8 August 1942. Returning to Truk later that month, Asagumo provided support in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons. From September, she was assigned to patrols from Truk towards Shortland, and in October and November was assigned to nine \\"Tokyo Express\\" high speed transport operations in the Solomon Islands. During this time, she was made the flagship of the 4th Torpedo Squadron, and participated in the Battle of Santa Cruz. During the First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal on 12 November, she assisted in sinking the American destroyer and damaging the cruiser , and afterward assisted the damaged destroyer . During the Second Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, she rescued survivors from the battleship . At the end of the year, she returned to Yokosuka in the company of the aircraft carrier . Returning to Truk in mid-January 1943 in the company of the aircraft carrier , she conveyed a convoy to Wewak in New Guinea. During the remainder of January and February, she assisted in the evacuation of surviving Japanese forces from Guadalcanal and other points in the Solomon Islands. During the Battle of the Bismarck Sea of 1‚Äì4 March she survived numerous air attacks while rescuing survivors from various sunken vessels. During the remainder of March and first week of April, she made several transport runs to reinforce the Japanese position at Kolombangara. She returned to Yokosuka for repairs on 13 April. After repairs were completed in late May, Asagumo was based at Paramushiro in the Kurile Islands. She participated in the Japanese retreat from Kiska Island in July and returned to Yokosuka with in briefly in August. At the end of October, she was reassigned to the IJN 3rd Fleet. She was also modified by the removal of her X-turret, which was replaced by two triple Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Guns. Asagumo returned to Truk in early January 1944 to escort the battleship back to Kure Naval Arsenal. She returned to Singapore with the carriers and in February, returning with Zuikaku to Kure in March and back again to Singapore. She escorted a convoy to Tawitawi in May, from which she escorted the battleship to Davao. During the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June, she was part of Admiral Ozawa's force, but sent on detached duty to Okinawa owing to fuel problems. In July, she returned to Manila, and was in Brunei in mid- October. In October, she was assigned to Vice Admiral Sh≈çji Nishimura's fleet at the Battle of Surigao Strait, Asagumo was torpedoed by the destroyer and subsequently finished off by gunfire from US Navy cruisers and destroyers at position (). Of her crew, 191 were killed, but 39 survivors, including her captain, Commander Shibayama, were taken prisoner by the Americans. Asagumo was removed from the navy list on 10 January 1945. It was said that she rescued survivors of the battleship , which was torpedoed by the destroyer , threw off formation, blew up, broke into two, and sank afterwards, only for them to all go down with the ship when Asagumo sank. Her wreck was discovered by RV Petrel in late 2017, with her hull and superstructure mostly intact.

It goes from Grafton Street in the west to the junction of South Leinster Street and Kildare Street in the east. History and naming Formerly known as St Patrick's Well Lane after a 12th-century well, it was renamed in the 18th century, after the accession to the throne of King William III, a member of the House of Orange-Nassau. To emphasise the point, one of the houses erected a marble bust of William with the couplet: The site of the well is in the grounds of Trinity College, near the Nassau Street exit. Folklore connects the well with Saint Patrick, who (legend states) struck the ground with his staff and brought forth water bubbling to the surface. The well can still be visited by arrangement with the Provost's Office of Trinity College. Two separate visits to the street by United States President Bill Clinton have made headlines. In December 2000, the outgoing US First Family visited the Blarney Woollen Mills store. In March 2017, ex- President Clinton made an unannounced stop to the Kilkenny Store. The street today The south side of the street is commercialised, with newsagents and a music shop to the east of the junction with Dawson Street, and further shops and offices, including a major branch of the Kilkenny Store chain, to the west of it.

Vopper, 532 U.S. 514 (2001), is a United States Supreme Court case relieving a media defendant of liability for broadcasting a taped conversation of a labor official talking to other union people about a teachers' strike.. At trial, the parties stipulated that the taped conversation had been recorded in violation of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act. Nevertheless, the Court held the broadcast was legal.  Background  In 1992 and 1993 the Pennsylvania State Education Association, a teachers' union, was engaged in collective bargaining negotiations with the Wyoming Valley West School Board. In May 1993, the union's chief negotiator, Gloria Bartnicki, was surreptitiously recorded speaking by phone with union president Anthony Kane. Referring to the collective bargaining negotiations, which had grown contentious, Kane said: \\"If they're not gonna move for three percent, we're gonna have to go to their, their homes. . . . To blow off their front porches, we'll have to do some work on some of those guys. (PAUSES). Really, uh, really and truthfully because this is, you know, this is bad news. (UNDECIPHERABLE).\\"Bartnicki, 532 U.S. at 518-19. The intercepted conversation was ultimately broadcast by Fredrick Vopper, a talk radio host. Vopper had received a tape of the conversation from Jack Yocum, who was president of a local taxpayers' association and a vocal opponent of the union. Yocum, in turn, claimed to have obtained the tape from an anonymous tipster. Thus, the identity of the individual who carried out the initial illegal act of wiretapping was not known. This presented the Court with a novel issue: Whether enforcing anti-wiretapping statutes against individuals who merely disseminate material illegally obtained by others runs afoul of the First Amendment, which protects the right of individuals to engage in speech on matters of public concern. Decision The Court held the radio station not liable because the radio station itself had done nothing illegal to obtain the tape. The case means that media defendants are not liable even if a third party violated the law. = Dissenting opinion = Chief Justice William Rehnquist, in his dissenting opinion, was concerned with the effect that the decision would have on speech. He noted that 40 states, the District of Columbia, and the federal government had knowingly disclosed (published) illegally intercepted electronic communication. He also argued that that disclosure would produce a chilling effect in the creation of initial, albeit electronic, speech:  Implications  While the Court declared the relevant wiretapping statutes unconstitutional as applied, the precedential value of the case remains unclear. Under one reading of the majority opinion, courts should apply \\"strict scrutiny\\" in reviewing restrictions on the dissemination of illegally obtained information whenever that information touches on a \\"matter of public concern\\".. This expansive standard would provide robust First Amendment protection to media outlets engaging in the publication of stolen materials. Application of such a rule might, for instance, insulate controversial whistleblower entities like WikiLeaks from liability for publishing government secrets. A much narrower reading is offered by Justice Stephen Breyer's concurring opinion, which was joined by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. Breyer's concurrence would limit First Amendment protection only to instances in which the stolen information involved threats of physical harm.. Others contend the opinion endorses an ad hoc balancing test, requiring courts to engage in a freeform, case-by-case analysis of the relative weight of various interests surrounding disclosure.. The behavior of the lower courts after Bartnicki indicates that in practice, the opinion is being construed narrowly. According to one commentator, writing ten years after Bartnicki was decided, \\"in no case reported to date has the holding in Bartnicki been applied to reach a similar conclusion in an analogous case.\\" It thus appears that Justice Breyer's narrow construction of the holding, which sought to limit the case to its unique facts, has effectively carried the day. Related case On April 20, 2010, the Supreme Court held in United States v. Stevens (the so-called animal torture video case) that the government, with limited exceptions, cannot hold criminally liable someone who distributes a tape of an illegal act if the person had not been complicit in committing.

He was re-elected to the 5th Parliament of the Province of Canada and 6th Parliament of the Province of Canada. David Christie was in frequent contact with George Brown who published The Globe newspaper. In the fall of 1849, David Christie was a founding member of the Clear Grit movement. Along with other Clear Grit supporters, Christie argued for a Canadian brand of republicanism that included the election of a deep number of government representatives. David Christie also coined the term Clear Grit according to Charles Dent, who traces the term to a discussion between Christie and George Brown where Christie criticised any Reformer who would hang back like Brown, declaring \\"We want only men who are Clear Grit\\". In 1858, he was elected to the Legislative Council of the Province of Canada. In 1867, he was summoned to the Senate of Canada representing the senatorial division of Erie, Ontario.

Castle FM broadcasts a mixture of music, news and information for a potential audience of over 50,000 adults in the East Antrim area.  Background  Carrickfergus got its first taste of local radio on Monday 1 June 1998 when the tones of Eddie West welcomed Carrickfergus to the sound of 'Radio Carrickfergus'. Radio Carrickfergus was a two-week trial broadcast provided by 'Galax' and funded by Carrickfergus Borough Council to provide coverage of the town's Waterfront Festival. A small caravan on the 'Castle Green' at the foot of Carrick's 12th- century Norman Castle gave home to presenters on the first day including Paul Buckle (now BBC NI), Stuart Robinson (now Cool FM /Downtown), Ricky K (now Citybeat), Natasha Sayee (now BBC NI) and Eddie West (now Cool FM / Downtown). The station returned in December 1998, June 1999 and December 1999. All these broadcasts were made from the Knightride Centre on Antrim Street (now museum and civic centre). In March 2000, Carrickfergus Borough Council appointed Belfast radio station Belfast CityBeat to provide the service and local radio presenter Stuart Robinson took over as Station Manager. In 2000, the station relocated to a more suitable location at the time in the town's DeCourcy Centre and rebranded to Vibe FM which launched at 9 am on 9 June 2000. In April 2002, Vibe FM ran a competition with the Carrick Times to pick a new name for the radio station which would soon be relaunching. Eventually 'Castle FM' was created as was Stuart Robinson's new concept 'Young Star Search'. The result was a huge boost for the station which went on to attract a record response from listeners and gain awards. Castle FM launched at 9 am on 31 May 2002 and ran to 27 June 2002. The first song played was \\"Walking On Sunshine\\" by Katrina And The Waves. Citybeat provided the Castle FM for the last time in 2004; however, Stuart Robinson launched 'The New Castle FM' as a private venture the following year. The station started at 9 am on 12 August 2005 and enjoyed success. Soon afterwards, Robinson moved away from RSL radio to concentrate on developing his Young Star Search format across Northern Ireland which successfully ran on Belfast Citybeat until his defection to Cool FM and Downtown Radio in 2010. In 2011, it was announced that 'The New Castle FM' would be returning following a six-year break and once again supported by Carrickfergus Borough Council, however David McCammond is now listed as the new licence holder of the service. Robinson continues to retain copyright to the name and Young Star Search format but is no longer involved in their operation at this time. On 4 July 2011 at 9 am, Robinson brought 'The New Castle FM' back to life with Starship's \\"Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now\\"; the station enjoyed success over the following two weeks attracting interviews with members of the local community and even Siva from 'The Wanted' called to show his support. It is not yet known when the station will return to the airwaves.

The book traces the life of physician and anthropologist Paul Farmer with particular focus on his work fighting tuberculosis in Haiti, Peru and Russia. Summary The book is written from the view of author Tracy Kidder. It is set mainly in Haiti and Boston, Massachusetts. Kidder first met his subject, Dr. Paul Farmer, in Haiti in 1994. Farmer was born in Massachusetts and grew up as one of six children in a poor household in Florida. He studied at Duke and Harvard, where he earned his M.D and Ph.D. The rest of the book details Farmer's life and accomplishments, including his work with the health and social justice organization Partners in Health, especially in Haiti, Peru, and Russia. Kidder describes Paul Farmer as follows: :\\"And I was drawn to the man himself. He worked extraordinary hours. In fact, I don‚Äôt think he sleeps more than an hour or two most nights. Here was a person who seemed to be practicing more than he preached, who seemed to be living, as nearly as any human being can, without hypocrisy. A challenging person, the kind of person whose example can irritate you by making you feel you‚Äôve never done anything as important, and yet, in his presence, those kinds of feelings tended to vanish. In the past, when I‚Äôd imagined a person with credentials like his, I‚Äôd imagined someone dour and self-righteous, but he was very friendly and irreverent, and quite funny. He seemed like someone I‚Äôd like to know, and I thought that if I did my job well, a reader would feel that way, too.\\" The book is primarily a biographical work broken into five parts. PART I: Dokt√® Paul Introduces Farmer's work at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts and at Zanmi Lasante founded by PIH in Cange, Haiti. PART II: The Tin Roofs of Cange Describes Farmer's family background and gives accounts of Farmer from sources close to him. Farmer's dedication to PIH led to the breaking off of his engagement to Ophelia Dahl, the daughter of noted author Roald Dahl and actress Patricia Neal. The two have remained close confidantes, and Dahl has continued to work for the PIH organization. PART III: M√©dicos Aventureros In 1995 MDR-TB claimed the life of a close friend known as Father Jack, in Lima, Peru. PIH co-founder, Dr. Jim Kim convinces Farmer to extend PIH into Peru, where they fight against the rigid orders of the DOTS program. This was regulated by the World Health Organization, and largely supported financially by an American benefactor, Tom White. PART IV: A Light Month for Travel Follows Farmer from Haiti to Cuba, Paris, Russia, and other locations in his quest to treat infectious disease. PART V: O for the P In 2000, PIH learns it has been awarded a $45 million grant, by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, to combat MDR-TB in Lima, Peru, along with other organizations. \\"O for the P\\" refers to an expression within PIH that is a shortened form of saying ‚Äúa preferential option for the poor‚Äù.Kidder, Tracy (2003-09-09).

His longtime broadcast partner was the former Ecuadorian professional wrestler Hugo Savinovich, who was the color commentator on the announce team until October 2011. Currently, his partner is Marcelo Rodriguez. Early career Cabrera was born in Bogota, Colombia. During his career as a newsman and radio personality, Cabrera has obtained many coveted awards, including the ACE Awards both in Radio and TV categories. Cabrera has one of the most recognizable voices in both Spanish radio and TV in the United States and is constantly used as a voice over announcer for many important corporations and brand names that wish to advertise their products nationally. Professional wrestling career Cabrera has worked for WWF (now WWE) since 1994 and, alongside Hugo Savinovich and presently Marcelo Rodr√≠guez, has been the Spanish announcer on Spanish language versions of Raw, SmackDown, Superstars, NXT, and pay-per-view (PPV) events. Their audio can be accessed in the United States via the SAP feature on most TV sets. Cabrera and Savinovich had a show on WWE.com called WWE En Espa√±ol (WWE in Spanish), a thirty-minute program that served as a recap of RAW, SmackDown, NXT, and pay-per-view events. The duo taped their one-hundredth episode in April 2006. Rodr√≠guez was a frequent substitute host of the program until October 2011, when he became permanent co-host following the departure of Savinovich from the company. For a brief period, Cabrera and Savinovich starred in a Spanglish mini-show called 28 Segundos. In previous years, while working for WWE on its monthly pay-per- views, the announce table at which he has worked with Savinovich and Rodr√≠guez, more commonly known as the Spanish announcers' table, has become a staple in modern professional wrestling as a convenient device on which for wrestlers to execute dramatic moves, such as the piledriver or the Pedigree, which almost always results in the destruction of the table, as it is designed to collapse on impact. Cabrera and Rodr√≠guez provide live Spanish commentary for all weekly shows from the WWE Television Studios in Stamford, Connecticut and are at ringside for PPV events. This practice temporarily ended in mid-2006. Originally due to the addition of the now-defunct ECW brand, the announce teams of all 3 brands were present for tri-branded pay-per-views (Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series). During this time, Cabrera and Hugo Savinovich provided commentary for these events from the WWE Television Studios but were still placed at ringside for brand- exclusive PPV events. When the brand-exclusive pay-per-view concept ended in 2007, the announce teams of all three brands were placed at ringside for all PPV events. Beginning in 2009, a single three-man announce team, composed of announcers from the two current brands, was designated for pay-per-views. Cabrera and Savinovich returned to ringside for PPVs at The 25th Anniversary of WrestleMania in 2009. However, they were not reinstated full-time until WrestleMania XXVI in 2010. In October 2011, Savinovich left WWE and Marcelo Rodr√≠guez became the permanent Spanish color commentator and co-host of WWE En Espa√±ol. Also in October 2011, Cabrera and Rodr√≠guez were at ringside for the tapings of Raw and SmackDown in Mexico City, Mexico. During the SmackDown tapings, Cabrera took part in a WWE.com exclusive in-ring segment where he helped translate Triple H's dialect to the audience as they announced Mil M√°scaras as the first inductee to the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2012. In TLC: Tables, Ladders and Chairs (2012), the 3MB tag team (Heath Slater, Jinder Mahal, and Drew McIntyre) start to mocking Carlos and Marcelo in a racist way (Kayfabe), including an attack to Ricardo Rodriguez, only to begin a feud with Alberto Del Rio, signalling a face turn for the Mexican duo.http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/WWE_News_3/article_67293.shtml References External links *Carlos Cabrera Bio on WWE.com (Spanish) * 1959 births Living people People from Bogot√° Professional wrestling announcers ","title":"Carlos Cabrera"},{"id":"4996816","text":"Shock were a music/mime/dance/pop group that was notable in the early 1980s for supporting English new wave groups such as Gary Numan, Adam and the Ants, Depeche Mode and Famous Names, led by Steve Fairnie. In 1979, mime artists Tim Dry and Barbie Wilde united with actors Robert Pereno and Lowri-Ann Richards and dancer Karen Sparks to produce Shock. In April 1980, they recruited another mime, Sean Crawford. The line-up changed again with the departure of Karen and the introduction of Carole Caplin. Based in London, England, Shock performed in clubs such as The Ha√ßienda, The Warehouse (Leeds) and The Blitz Club (home of the Blitz Kids) and The Venue (London). With costumes from Kahn & Bell (designers for Duran Duran), miming to music by Fad Gadget, Landscape, Kate Bush and Wilson Pickett, they were in the vanguard of the New Romantic cult of the early 1980s, alongside Boy George, Duran Duran, Steve Strange and Spandau Ballet. Their first record, \\"Angel Face\\" on RCA Records ‚Äì with production by Rusty Egan (Visage) and Richard James Burgess (Landscape) ‚Äì was a dance floor hit, as was the second, \\"Dynamo Beat\\". In 1981, Shock co-starred with Ultravox at the 'People's Palace Valentine's Ball' at the Rainbow Theatre. Lowri-Ann, Barbie and Carole appeared in the video for Landscape's \\"Einstein A Go-Go\\".

Johnny Ace Palmer is an American close-up magician. He is famous within the worldwide magical community for his prodigious sleight-of-hand abilities. Early life Palmer was born in Warren, Ohio, in 1960 and attended Lakeview High School in Ohio until his graduation. Following high school, Palmer attended Kent State University in Ohio in the late 1970s and early '80s. He came to magic early in life, and as a teenager, performed a stage act with his sister, Peggy. Palmer likes to say that he was \\"put on this Earth to do magic.\\" In college, he majored in both theater arts and psychology, stating he wanted to prepare himself for his future career as a magician. Magic career Palmer started performing magic in the early 1970s, many times performing at churches and giving a Christian message with his magic. His mother, Ann Aanne, helped get him bookings and was one time asked what he could do that was really amazing to which she replied, \\"He can pull an eight ball from a thimble.\\" This was not a skill that Palmer had even tried but, because he was very creative, figured out a way to do it for the performance and has been one of his signature skills ever since. Palmer was able to get a job as Bingo the Clown at The Ground Round Restaurant in Niles, Ohio in the late 1970s on the weekends and incorporated his magic to entertain customers before and after their meal. He used Ground Round tokens instead of coins to perform his coin magic and prided himself on being able to do sleights without using gaffed(trick) coins. Working on the weekends afforded Palmer the opportunity to hone his skill with sleight-of-hand and practice his cups and balls routine to help make it the classic it is today. Throughout the 1980s, Palmer entered and competed in a large number of American magic competitions, culminating in his first-place wins at the annual convention of the International Brotherhood of Magicians and the annual convention of the Society of American Magicians. Then he set his sights on international goals, entering the world-championship of magic, a competition called FISM, in 1988. He presented a 10-minute act which was one of the first competition acts to utilize stage techniques in a closeup setting. One routine for which he became known was a version of the Cups & Balls in which the final load was three live baby chicks. Palmer's skills won him the title of World- champion magician. In so doing, he became the first close-up magician in history to receive the Grand Prix award, and only the second American to win (Lance Burton was the first in 1982).FISM - World Championship of Magic - Winners 1982 to 1988 This award is given out only once every three years. The Magic Castle named Palmer Best Close-Up Magician two years in a row (1987, 1988) as well as Lecturer of the Year (1996, 1999). He performs at the Castle twice a year, in September during the week that encompasses Labor Day and in April during the week that encompasses April Fool's Day. As of 2006, Palmer is the only magician to be awarded both the International Brotherhood of Magicians' Gold Cups Award of Excellence (which he received in 1983) and the Society of American Magicians' Gold Medal Award of Honor (which he received in 1986).Career Achievements Palmer was one of the original seven magicians who opened Caesars Magical Empire in June, 1996.Career Achievements However, his home base for nearly two decades has remained suburban Los Angeles. With many awards under his belt, Palmer has turned down many opportunities to pursue a lucrative stage magic career. Instead, he has said that he prefers the excitement and personal contact involved in closeup magic. He has performed tableside magic regularly at many restaurants through the years, including his current weekly gig on Sunday evenings at Earth Wind & Flour in Santa Monica, which he has had since 1994.Now Appearing! Past restaurants in Los Angeles have included the decade that he spent at Zach's Italian Cafe (Studio City) and the several years that he spent at the Green Street Restaurant (Pasadena). Palmer's knowledge was utilized by Mattel when the company vied for the merchandising contract to create toys for the Harry Potter film franchise. Palmer assisted the company in designing toys with a magical theme. Warner Bros. ended up awarding the contract to Mattel. In 1994, the Library of Congress created an exhibit to be displayed at schools, libraries and malls across the country. Called Grand Illusion: The Art and Practice of Magic, the exhibit featured only five living magicians, one of whom was Palmer. Palmer was featured in an episode of the TV series Masters of Illusion aired March 2009. Bibliography Johnny appeared on the cover of The Linking Ring Magazine in 1998.

He is portrayed primarily by Jensen Ackles. Other versions of the character having been portrayed by Hunter Brochu (toddler), Ridge Canipe (child), Nicolai Lawton-Giustra (pre-teen), Brock Kelly and Dylan Everett (teen), and Chad Everett (elderly). Throughout the series, Dean hunts demons, spirits and other supernatural creatures with his younger brother Sam. The brothers are assisted by a rotating cast of friends and allies, such as father figure Bobby Singer (deceased), the angel Castiel and Crowley the demon King of Hell (deceased). Development Dean Winchester was created by Eric Kripke, creator and original showrunner of Supernatural, when he pitched a show to the WB about two brothers who investigate the supernatural.Knight, Nicholas, (Season 1 Companion), p.6 Dean's name is a homage to Jack Kerouac's road-trip novel On the Road, tying into Kripke's concept for an Americana road-trip television series. It was originally intended for the brothers' last name to be \\"Harrison\\" as a nod to actor Harrison Ford, as Kripke wanted Dean to have the \\"devil-may-care swagger of Han Solo.\\" However, there was a Sam Harrison living in Kansas, so the name had to be changed for legal reasons. Combining his interest in the Winchester Mystery House and his desire to give the series the feel of \\"a modern-day Western,\\" Kripke settled on the surname of \\"Winchester.\\" Dean and his brother Sam are from Lawrence, Kansas, due to its closeness to Stull Cemetery, a location famous for its urban legends. Jensen Ackles, who portrays Dean Winchester, was originally asked to audition for the role of Sam, but preferred the character of Dean after reading the script.Knight, Nicholas, (Season 1 Companion), p. 130 Character biography =Preseries= Dean Winchester was born on January 24, 1979 to John and Mary Winchester in Lawrence, Kansas. He is the couple's first child, four years older than his younger brother, Sam. He is named after his maternal grandmother, Deanna Campbell. On November 2, 1983, Mary was killed in Sam's nursery by the demon Azazel, and in the ensuing fire Dean was tasked with carrying Sam out to safety while John unsuccessfully tried to rescue Mary. Since then, Dean has felt responsible for Sam and was always given the job to take care of him while they were growing up. John began investigating the cause of Mary's death and learned about supernatural creatures and the people who hunted them. John became a hunter himself, and trained Dean to be one as well, though both hid the supernatural from Sam until he was 8 years old. The Winchesters constantly moved around the country, living in motels and the homes of John's friends. Dean was left to look after Sam with John being continuously absent during their childhood. When Dean was 16, he was arrested for stealing and spent time in a boy's home where he had the opportunity to go to a regular school, though eventually Dean chose to return to Sam. Prior to the pilot of the series, Sam left to pursue his own life away from the supernatural. John held a grudge against Sam as he felt Sam had abandoned them, while Sam also held a grudge due to the huge argument prior to Sam leaving. John and Dean continued to hunt together and traveled throughout the United States. Dean is known for handling a large number of weapons. His signature looks are black boots, a dark leather jacket and dark flannel shirts with dark blue jeans. He is also known for driving a signature black 1967 Chevrolet Impala Sport Sedan, which he occasionally sleeps in and he has a huge stash of weaponry in the trunk. =Series= Season 1 Dean is 26 years old when the series begins and has been allowed by John to hunt by himself. In the first episode, Dean goes to Sam (who is away at law school), whom he hasn't seen for a few years, and asks for help finding John, who has gone missing. The pair are initially unsuccessful, and at the end of the first episode, Sam's girlfriend Jessica Moore dies the same way their mother did. Sam joins Dean on the road, hunting various supernatural creatures, tracking down their father and searching for the culprit behind the deaths of their mother and Jessica. After eventually reuniting with their father and coming into possession of the Colt, they prepare to strike back against Azazel, a powerful demon with yellow eyes. Season 2 Failing to kill him, they are rammed into by a semi-truck, sending Dean into a coma. Flat-lining, Dean dies but is saved from death at the last second when John makes a deal with the Demon to save his life. After John's soul is taken by the Demon to Hell, Sam and Dean start hunting the Demon, who eventually kidnaps Sam. In a turn of events, Sam is stabbed in the back and killed, forcing Dean to make a deal to save his brother's life. He is given 1 year of life. Dean and Sam are unable to stop the Demon from opening a gate to Hell and freeing Lilith. However, their father escapes as well and gives them the chance they need to kill the Yellow Eyed Demon, before his soul heads to heaven. Season 3 While trying to cope with his impending death and make the best of his final year, Dean begins to start hunting the freed Demons. Meeting a seemingly helpful demon Ruby, Dean learns that he too may become a demon himself if he burns in Hell too long. Learning Lilith to have taken the throne of Hell from Azazel and to hold Dean's life contract in her hands, the brothers eventually confront her. Unable to kill her, Dean is mauled to death by Hellhounds and his soul is dragged to Hell. Season 4 While there Lilith orders a demon called Alastair to brutalize Dean. Dean spends four months dead, equating to 40 years in Hell. Dean had joined Alastair in torturing souls after previously refusing for 30 years. However, Dean awakens from his grave and reunites with family and meets the angel Castiel who (along with the army of angels who were also sent to work together) is revealed to have saved from Hell and resurrected Dean. Struggling with his actions in Hell and trying to get Sam to quit drinking demon blood, Dean meets Azazel again when sent back in time by Castiel. At one point, Dean opened to Sam and revealed how he not only tortured but enjoyed the events while in Hell. Dean encounters another angel Zachariah who implores Dean to keep hunting after he nearly gave it up when learning Alastair had tortured John, who never broke in his time in Hell. During Jump the Shark, Dean and Sam learn of their half-brother Adam with Sam. Although initially disbelieving, Dean is convinced of the relation with pictures. Dean is also against Sam using the teachings of their father on Adam after he is attacked by monsters. At the end, it is revealed that it was a ghoul (that wanted revenge on John for a previous hunt) and impersonating Adam who was killed but Dean saved Sam and the brothers burned Adam's body. Eventually, Dean learns that the angels the want the Apocalypse to start and that if one of the Demon's Special Children, of whom Sam is the only one left, kill Lilith, Lucifer will be free. Castiel helps Dean escape the angels, as Dean kills Ruby (who was a spy for Lilith) but arrives moments too late to stop Lucifer from breaking free. Season 5 After Lucifer is freed, Dean and Sam are teleported onto an airplane by an unknown force (God). Later learning of his role as the vessel for the Archangel Michael and Sam's role as Lucifer's vessel, the brothers meet the King of Crossroads Crowley and fight against the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse to defeat Lucifer. On their search to find a way to defeat Lucifer, the brothers attempt to use the Colt and look for God, but it is revealed that the Colt cannot kill Lucifer and God does not care about the Apocalypse. These actions make Dean decide to become Michael's vessel even if the end result is the deaths of millions of people, however, Sam's faith in Dean pulls him back into finding another solution. Upon the death of the Archangel Gabriel, the brothers discover that by using the rings from the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, they can reopen and trap Lucifer back into Hell. As Dean and Sam already have War and Famine's rings, they search for Pestilence and Death's location, leading Sam to meet his old college friend Brady: the guy who introduced Sam to Jessica and the demon ordered by Azazel to kill Jessica. Dean lets Sam kill Brady after getting the information they need. Learning from Death how to trap Lucifer, Dean eventually lets Sam become the devil's vessel, but his strong bond with Dean helps him fall into Lucifer's Cage with Michael, who is using the boys younger brother Adam as a vessel. Season 6 Quitting hunting and moving in with an ex-one-night-stand, Lisa, Dean begins to move into a normal life but is thrust back into hunting when attacked by a Djinn and mysteriously saved by Sam. Shocked to learn of his brother and maternal grandfather's resurrections, Dean is placed even more on edge when Sam acts cold, ruthlessly and lets Dean get temporarily turned into a vampire. This is mostly shocking because out of the brothers, Sam has always been the gentler of the two. Later learning from Castiel that Sam is lacking a soul, Dean sets out to fix his brother. Getting Sam's soul back, from Lucifer's cage, through Death, the brothers begin to unravel a conspiracy involving Crowley and Castiel. Defeating Eve, the mother of all monsters, Dean cuts ties with Lisa and learns Castiel to have taken Purgatory's souls to become the most powerful angel alive. Season 7 Requesting Death's help, Dean is unable to get Castiel to return the souls of Purgatory in time and the Leviathans break free and begin an effort to take over the Earth. After their father figure Bobby is killed by Dick Roman, the Leviathan leader, they gain an ally through Kevin Tran, a new prophet. With the Word of God, Dean and Castiel kill Roman but are themselves killed in the subsequent explosion and dragged to Purgatory. Season 8 Surviving a full year in Purgatory with the aid of the vampire Benny after being abandoned by Castiel, Dean and Benny eventually escape. Dean is angered to learn that Sam did not even search for him. Reuniting with Kevin, they find another Word of God that details trials to close the gates of Hell. Dean aids Sam in completing the trials, and along the way they encounter the rogue angel Metatron and the Knight of Hell Abaddon. During this time the brothers are also given the Men of Letters bunker as a headquarters, by their paternal grandfather. Dean is horrified to learn Castiel was programmed by the angel Naomi to try to kill him. Capturing Crowley, Dean stops Sam from completing the trials when he learns it will kill his brother. When they begin to head to the hospital, Sam collapses just as the angels begin to fall down to Earth. Season 9 Praying for help, Dean learns Metatron fooled Castiel and stole his grace leaving him human and causing the fall. Aided by an angel named Ezekiel, Dean allows him to possess Sam if it means saving his brother. With Ezekiel in Sam, however, Dean is unable to get any help from Castiel and begins to try to find a way to handle Abaddon. Joining up with Metatron, Ezekiel reveals himself to actually be the angel Gadreel and overpowers Dean, preventing him from saving Kevin. Turning to Crowley for help, Dean manages to purge Gadreel from Sam at the cost of their relationship. Growing desperate to defeat Abaddon, Crowley manipulates Dean into accepting the Mark of Cain, from Dean's ancestor Cain, and aids him in locating the First Blade. Mending his bond with Sam, Dean kills Abaddon and nearly slaughters Gadreel. When finally confronting Metatron, Dean is fatally stabbed and once again dies. His body brought back to the bunker, Dean's reawakens a demon and leaves with Crowley.‚ÄòSupernatural‚Äô Season 10: Mark Sheppard Promoted to Series Regular, Variety, Laura Prudom, May 23, 2014 Season 10 Enjoying his time as a demon and killing several of Abaddon's loyalists, Dean eventually kills an man called Lester Morris and uses his newfound demon powers to confirm what Crowley told him about Sam. Eventually confronting his brother, Dean is pulled into a fight by a soldier named Cole, allowing Sam to use holy water to imprison his brother. Using the demon cure process to try to turn his brother back, Sam lets his guard down and Dean escapes. With the help of Castiel, however, Dean is cured, but still remains an enhanced human with the Mark of Cain. After eventually growing more and more powerful while losing control, Dean learns from Cain, before killing his ancestor, that there is no viable cure. Death later confirms this by revealing that removing the Mark would unleash the Darkness and offers to remove Dean from society on the condition that he kill Sam. Although he initially agrees, Dean relents and kills Death instead. However, due to Sam's earlier machinations, the Mark is removed and the Darkness is unleashed regardless. Season 11 With the Darkness unleashed, Dean and Sam set out to try to find the Darkness, but are shaken to learn that the entity they are hunting is essentially God's sister, who was 'sacrificed' so that he could create the world. Manifesting as a woman who comes to call herself Amara, Dean finds himself unable to kill her due to a twisted attraction, but matters become even more complicated when Castiel consents to act the vessel for Lucifer when he becomes convinced that only an archangel has any chance against Amara. This strategy fails- speculated to be due to Lucifer's status as a fallen archangel- but the Winchesters are eventually contacted by the true God, now revealed to be Chuck Surely, the author who wrote the Winchester Gospels, who is able to make peace with Amara and depart. Dean is shocked when he is reunited with his mother, who was brought back to life by Amara as a thanks for Dean's actions. Season 12 The Winchesters find themselves facing human and supernatural threats when the British branch of the Men of Letters attack the Winchesters to try to take control of America's hunters and Lucifer is left on the run trying to find a new vessel. Lucifer eventually takes the President of the United States as a vessel, but the Winchesters are able to banish him from this host. While the Winchesters discover that Lucifer conceived a child while possessing the President, they are left to guard the child's mother while Mary explores the possibility of an alliance with the British Men of Letters. Although Castiel concludes that Lucifer's child is worth protecting, the potential alliance with the Men of Letters ends when the group prove to be excessively ruthless, to the point of killing a hunter who had assisted the Winchesters on a case because she accidentally killed one of their members. Season 13 The Winchesters are eventually able to banish Lucifer to a parallel universe where the Apocalypse took place 'on schedule', in 2012, but this plan backfired when Lucifer alerted the alternate version of Michael to the existence of the original world, as well as leaving them with the complication of trying to raise Lucifer's suddenly-adult son, Jack Kline. (Jack is 6 months old, chronologically). Jack soon comes to see the Winchesters and Castiel as his 'fathers', while they gain a new ally when they discover that Gabriel survived his death, in season 5, but although they are able to return to the Apocalypse World to rescue several humans (including alternate versions of Bobby Singer and Charlie Bradbury), the alternate Michael, and Lucifer follow them into this world. Stuck for options to stop Lucifer after he takes Jack's grace to charge his own powers, Dean agrees to act as Michael's vessel, but Michael takes control of Dean's body after Lucifer's death. Season 14 Using Dean's body, Michael spends the next few weeks exploring this world until he decides to aid the monsters in taking control of the world as their desires are pure. Dean eventually manifested long enough to demand his freedom. He briefly abandons Dean to continue his own plans while wearing down Dean's willingness to resist, but although Michael eventually takes Dean as his vessel again, with the aid of his family Dean is able to trap Michael in his subconscious. He is later informed by Billie the Reaper, who has replaced Death after his death, that Michael will inevitably escape his prison in every future but the one where Dean seals himself in an Enochian box at the bottom of the ocean, but although Dean starts creating such a box, he accepts Sam's argument that they will still try and find another way first. Dean is briefly reunited with his father after a pearl with magical abilities grants him that which his heart desires. Although Dean hoped that his heart desire would be Michael out of his head, the family reunion was heart touching. John was forced to return to his own time before an alternate time line could ensue. Still abandoning his plan to seal himself in the Malik box, Dean accompanies Sam, Castiel, and Jack in a fairly routine hunt. During this, Dean gets knocked unconscious only to wake and find that Michael has escaped his mind. After slaughtering many hunters in his wake, Michael tortures the Winchesters but is confronted and killed by Jack Kline, who uses his soul to draw on his angelic abilities. In killing Michael, Jack not only burned off his soul, but also absorbed the grace of Michael, restoring him to his powerful state as a Nephilim. Due to this, Dean becomes increasingly more concerned with the condition of Jack's soul. Parallel to this, the previous vessel of Lucifer engages in a plan to raise Lucifer from the empty. Jack is able to stop him in a grotesque killing which leaves Mary Winchester in a state of deep concern. Jack becomes frustrated and accidentally uses his powers to kill Mary. Dean finds out about his mother's death and starts into a fit of anger fueled by grief. On a mission to kill Jack, Chuck makes an appearance, supplying a gun which will do to the holder what it does to the victim. Dean accepts this as a solution for his building anger towards Jack and finds himself aiming, point blank, at Jack. Dean realizes that this is not the solution and drops the gun, eliciting an angered response from Chuck. Sam and Dean begin to realize that their lives have been nothing more than entertainment to Chuck, while he pulls the strings. Chuck kills Jack and releases every evil spirit from hell to attack the trio in a dramatic show of frustration, with a prequel statement \\"Story‚Äôs over. Welcome to the end.\\" Dean characteristically takes a fighting stance as the swarm engulfs him, his brother, and Castiel.  Powers  When turned into a vampire, Dean had greater strength and all of his senses were enhanced. As a human, Dean was the bearer of the Mark of Cain; this granted him extraordinary strength, allowing him to fight on the level of a supercharged angel like Metatron. He also had several psionic abilities, the most notable of which is being able to summon and call the First Blade to him granted it is reasonable range. These powers also included premonitions given in dreams and immunity to both magical and demonic powers. As a demon bearing the Mark of Cain, Dean's strength was multiplied from the time he was a human, allowing him strength on par with, if not greater than, the Knights of Hell. His demonic powers also included a degree of telepathy, being able to read an individual named Lester's mind and learn his history with Sam upon meeting him. During his time as a demon, Dean also possessed the ability to easily regenerate from wounds and as his corrupted soul was possessing his own body, he was exempt from exorcisms that plagued other demons. During the short period as the angel Michael, Dean had powers similar to teleportation, telekinesis and rapid healing.  Skills and abilities  Dean is a skilled and highly resourceful hunter. He is well-versed in multiple types of firearms; he prefers his Colt 1911 and sawed-off shotgun, but is proficient with most other weapons he might acquire. He is also adept with brawling and knife fighting, and has subdued several human assailants with ease and bested physically more powerful creatures such as shapeshifters, vampires and demons. He frequently utilizes improvised weapons and explosive devices; in \\"Croatoan\\", he demonstrated knowledge of chemistry, constructing Molotov cocktails and improvised explosive devices, and in \\"Phantom Traveler\\", he revealed knowledge of electronics and reverse engineering, having built an electromagnetic field detector from an old Walkman radio. Dean also possesses extensive knowledge of the supernatural and mythology, and from season 4 onwards learns and is able to perform spells that are effective against angels. Dean's work as a hunter requires him to impersonate various occupational roles in pursuing his investigations and avoid the attention of law-enforcement. To this end, Dean is well-versed in how police, fire departments and various government agencies (FBI, CDC) typically operate and conduct investigations. In supporting this lifestyle, Dean is also skillful in lock picking, breaking into security systems, carjacking and hustling for pool. Due to his time spent in Hell as Alistair's \\"student\\", Dean has an in- depth knowledge of torture. Dean is also an accomplished mechanic and maintained an intimate knowledge of automobiles and engines since childhood; he maintains his Impala in top condition.

As viceroy of New Spain Cerda Sandoval Silva was only 35 years old when he was named viceroy of New Spain, in May 1688. He arrived in Veracruz in the middle of October. On the road from there to Mexico City he met with his predecessor, Melchor Portocarrero, 3rd Count of Monclova, on November 8, 1688. He arrived at Chapultepec on November 11 and took the oath of office before the Audiencia on November 20, 1688. His solemn entry into Mexico City was December 4, 1688, but his term of office is dated from the earlier swearing-in ceremony. Shortly after his arrival, the viceroy received a message from the governor of New Mexico that three Frenchmen from the French colony in the Seno Mexicano (Texas) had arrived in New Mexico. The viceroy ordered General Alonso de Le√≥n- Gonz√°lez, the governor of Coahuila, to take a detachment of soldiers, a geographer and an interpreter to march to the coast to confront the French. After many days march through desert, the governor arrived in the Bay of San Bernardo, or Espiritu Santo, where he found the French in the process of constructing a fort, but no signs of the French settlers. Hearing from friendly Indians that five of them were with a neighboring tribe in search of workmen, Alonso de Le√≥n-Gonz√°lez sent a detachment to capture them, and after several days the force returned with two of the French adventurers, Jacques Grollet and Jean L'Archeveque, the others having fled. The French held five Spanish prisoners, two of which the Spanish force was able to free. From these ex-prisoners, the governor Le√≥n-Gonz√°lez learned that the French were very interested in colonizing this region. Also in 1689 the viceroy raised funds from the archbishop and the bishops of the colony to send a fleet from the Pacific port of Acapulco in search of pirates marauding in the southern ocean. He also took steps to fight intruders on the Gulf coast, in Tabasco and Campeche. These were Englishmen cutting precious woods to send to Jamaica and Europe. There were only a few English, supervising Mayans who were doing the actual cutting. The Indian workers were well paid in aguardiente and money. There were heavy rains in the year 1689, and Cerda Sandoval was diligent in maintaining the drainage works. In compliance with a royal order of April 1691, Viceroy Cerda Sandoval established schools to teach Spanish to the natives, with considerable success. In the larger populations these were separate schools for boys and for girls, and in the smaller populations, a single school for both sexes. During his government, the viceroy had to deal with Indian revolts among the Tarahumaras in Nueva Vizcaya, and also among the Indians of Texas. The latter were of a generally peaceful disposition, and had indicated their desire to submit to the Spanish and convert to Christianity. The governor of Coahuila had established a presidio among them, and also a mission. However, the mistreatment received from the Spanish soldiers and the Spanish and Mestizo colonists caused the Indians to revolt. The soldiers and missionaries were forced to abandon their posts. The governor of Coahuila y Texas was able to pacify the Indians without bloodshed. =Mexico City Riot of 1692= In 1692 there was a severe drought, causing a shortage of food. The natives attributed this disaster to the earlier appearance of a comet, but more importantly there was no maize in the capital and many people were hungry. On 8 June 1692 a crowd gathered in front of the viceregal palace, which they set on fire. They threw stones and set the archives on fire. Don Carlos de Sig√ºenza y G√≥ngora was able to save most of the documents, at the risk of his life. Some nearby houses and shops were also burned. Sig√ºenza wrote a lengthy and vivid account of the riot, published as \\"Letter of Don Carlos Sig√ºenza y G√≥ngora to Admiral Pez Recounting the Incidents of the Corn Riot in Mexico City, June 8, 1692.\\"In Irving A. Leonard, Don Carlos Sig√ºenza y G√≥ngora, a Mexican Savant of the Seventeenth Century. Berkeley: University of California Press 1929, pp. 210‚Äì277. The viceroy, who had fled to the convent of San Francisco el Grande, was informed by individuals he trusted of the names of the supposed ringleaders of the rioting. Those arrested were three- quarters were Indians, but mixed race castas, and 4 Spaniards were also caught up in the investigation. Of those arrested in the riot, 66 were Indians, of whom 11 were executed, 32 received corporal punishment, 2 received other punishment, and 20 were absolved. Of the mestizo and castizo arrests, 2 were executed, 6 received corporal punishment, and 4 were absolved. Of the mulattoes arrested, 1 was executed, 2 given corporal punishment, and 2 absolved. In addition to these Indians or mixed raced castas, 4 Spaniards were arrested, of whom 1 was executed, 2 received corporal punishment or labor service, and one received other punishment. Overall, 15 were executed, 42 received corporal punishment or labor service, 3 received other punishment (2 public humiliation, 1 public humiliation and exile), and 26 were absolved. Although crown authorities saw the need to administer quick justice, the legal system functioned such that many under suspicion were absolved due to lack of evidence. Those convicted were overwhelmingly male and in all 31 were skilled workers, such as shoemakers, hat makers, tailors, bricklayers, plus miscellaneous artisans and apprentices. Unskilled workers included porters, people, water carriers, and one muleteer.R.

PhD Dissertation, University of California, Santa Barbara 2012. Before leaving Mexico City, the viceroy commissioned Crist√≥bal de Villalpando to do a painting of the main square of Mexico as a kind of souvenir of his tenure as viceroy. Villalpando's 1695 painting, View of the Z√≥calo of Mexico City now in a private collection in the UK, shows a vibrant scene of urban life. Strikingly, however, Villalpando depicts the severe fire damage to the viceregal palace. The viceroy's commissioned painting did not paint out the major riot during his tenure that challenged royal authority.Richard L. Kagan and Fernando Mar√≠as, Urban Images of the Hispanic World, 1493-1793. New Haven: Yale University Press 2000, pp. 160‚Äì163. In 1693, Don Carlos de Sig√ºenza y G√≥ngora published El Mercurio Volante, the first newspaper in New Spain. In 1695, with English help, the viceroy attacked the French who had established a base on the island of Espa√±ola. They were obliterated and 81 cannons were captured. In the same year Cerda Sandoval founded the Presidio at Panzacola, Florida. Also in 1695, during an epidemic, Sor Juana In√©s de la Cruz, the great Mexican poet, died in Mexico City. Later life In September 1695 Cerda Sandoval asked to return to Spain. He tried to turn over the government of the colony to Manuel Fern√°ndez de Santa Cruz, bishop of Puebla, on January 21, 1696. The bishop did not accept, citing his health and his responsibilities as bishop. Shortly thereafter Juan Ortega y Monta√±√©s, bishop of Michoac√°n, did accept the office. Cerda Sandoval returned to Spain, where he died March 12, 1697, in El Puerto de Santa Mar√≠a. Additional information Guti√©rrez Lorenzo, Mar√≠a Pilar.

Most of WANT's broadcast day is simulcast over 1490 AM WCOR, with some exceptions. Programming WANT is primarily focused on serving its community of Lebanon and Wilson County. It can be classified as a full-service radio station, mostly featuring country music, but regularly scheduling programs featuring oldies music, funk music, talk shows, and sporting events. Local news, weather, obituaries, and traffic reports regularly appear on weekdays. Local deejays anchor morning and afternoon drive times with shows that feature country music, trivia, news, weather, and traffic reports. In addition, a long-running local talk show (Coleman & Company) takes one hour of programming each weekday morning (7am to 8am). The show features interviews with local newsmakers and promotes community events. On Saturday nights, the station plays funk & classic R&B; music, hosted by \\"Fantastic Fred Anthony\\", a longtime fixture of the station. Sunday nights now feature an oldies music show. In addition to Lebanon High School football and basketball, the station is an affiliate of the Tennessee Titans radio network. WANT also broadcasts selected intercollegiate sporting events featuring teams associated with Lebanon's Cumberland University. At times when no local programming is offered (such as middays, overnights, and weekends), the station takes programming from the \\"Real Country\\" radio network. When the station is playing country music (whether locally originated or from the \\"Real Country\\" network), it carries the \\"Real Country FM 98.9\\" branding. During other programming blocks, it is simply branded as \\"FM 98.9 WANT\\". The WCOR simulcast is seldom acknowledged, except in the station's legal identifications. History After operating under a construction permit as WJFM, the station's owners petitioned the FCC to change the call letters to WANT (reflecting the original slogan, \\"You'll WANT to listen!\\"). The station first signed on the air on October 1, 1993, and the same day, revived sister station WCOR (then on 900 AM) as a simulcast, after it had been off-the-air for over a year. The station was originally branded as \\"FM 99\\", and was later tweaked to \\"FM 98.9\\" to represent the station's actual frequency.

Early years and playing career Hart was born in Auckland to father Joe, who worked for the bicycle importing company W.H. Worrall and Company, and mother Joan. He was the second of four children; he had an older brother, Graeme, a younger sister Loraine and a younger brother, Ian.Thomas, 1993, p. 13 Hart was educated at Mount Roskill Grammar School, where he was best all-round sportsman, head of his house and deputy prefect in his final year. He then enrolled in a Bachelor of Commerce at University of Auckland in hope of becoming an accountant, but his attention was more focused towards leisure than his studies. Hart no longer qualified for a bursary after failing more subjects in his second year, forcing him to complete his degree part-time.Thomas, 1993, p. 16-17 He was later appointed Group Employee Relations Director for Fletcher Challenge, then New Zealand's largest company. Coaching at Auckland John Hart began his first class coaching career for Auckland in 1982. He coached Auckland to the National Provincial Championship (NPC) title in 1982, 1984 and 1985, and it was during his tenure that, in 1985, Auckland won the Ranfurly Shield from Canterbury and began the series of 61 successful defences that remains a record in shield history. Hart, together with Alex Wyllie, was an assistant coach under Brian Lochore when the All Blacks won the first Rugby World Cup in 1987. In 1988, Lochore retired from coaching and Wyllie was appointed to succeed him, an appointment that upset many, especially Auckland, fans. Hart then refused to be part of the selection panel, but was eventually appointed co-coach with Wyllie for the 1991 Rugby World Cup. In hindsight, this was widely regarded to be a mistake: the personality clash between the two coaches was reflected in a split within the squad into Auckland and Canterbury factions. Following the All Blacks' loss to Australia in the semi-finals, Wyllie resigned, while Hart sought to become head coach, but was beaten to the post by the then Otago coach Laurie Mains. Mains coached the All Blacks to the final of the 1995 Rugby World Cup, which was won by South Africa, continued as coach for a year-end tour to France, after which he resigned and was replaced by John Hart. During Hart's tenure as head coach, the All Blacks achieved their first ever series win in South Africa, in 1996, and won the Tri-Nations three times, in 1996/97 and 1999. But when New Zealand lost unexpectedly to France in the semi-final of the 1999 Rugby World Cup, Hart, like his immediate predecessors, resigned. As head coach, Hart was in charge of the All Blacks for 41 games, winning 31, drawing one and losing nine. In 1990, John Hart was the coach of a New Zealand Under-21 side that toured Australia. Martin Johnson, who captained England to the title at the 2003 Rugby World Cup, was one of the players in the squad. Life after coaching In January 2005, Hart was appointed to the Board of Cullen Sports, owners of the New Zealand Warriors, a New Zealand rugby league club, for which he later served as the Executive Director of Football. He also served on the boards of a number of other companies, provides consultancy services in the fields of human resources and leadership, and is an active speaker on the lecture circuit. In December 2011 Hart resigned from the Warriors and took up a position as the New Zealand PGA Pro-Am organising committee chairman. In the 1997 Queen's Birthday Honours, Hart was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to rugby. Hart is the co-author (with Paul Thomas) of two books, Straight from the Hart (1993) and Change of Hart (1997) (); the latter gives a first-hand account of the transition to professional rugby, in which he played a significant part.

It was published in 1997. The original title of the book was \\"Donnerjack, of Virt√∫\\". Initially, Zelazny intended for it to be the first of an ambitious trilogy, with the two sequels tentatively named \\"The Gods of Virt√∫\\" and \\"Virt√∫, Virt√∫\\". Zelazny completed a few hundred pages of the first novel and left detailed notes for its remainder, which Lindskold completed, attempting to write in his style. Its description of the virtual world of Virtu has been considered as prefiguring the modern internet. Plot Donnerjack is set in a world that has developed a shared, fully immersive virtual reality. This virtual reality, referred to as Virtu, has come to dominate all aspects of society. People work, play, and can lead entire lives in Virtu. The eponymous John Donnerjack is one of the creators of Virtu, and a peerless engineer, capable of building just about anything in his virtual reality. The story follows John's final adventure, where he saves his lover from Death itself, and continues on through the perspective of his son, Jack. Many aspects of Donnerjack directly parallel famous myths and legends, particularly those conforming to Joseph Campbell's theory of the monomyth. It is heavily implied throughout the novel that, though humanity experiences it as a virtual reality simulation, Virtu may actually be an unintentional bridge to the magical realms described in mythology. It is not connected with Jack of Shadows written by Zelazny years before. Critical response Kirkus found it overcomplicated and in need of editing, but full of ideas.

Launched in October 2004 and originally published weekly, it is known for its investigative reporting and describes itself as being ‚Äúdriven by a clearly-stated political agenda and focuses on politics not personalities‚Äù. It was founded, and edited for a number of years by Vincent Browne. In November 2008, it was relaunched under new editor Michael Smith, a former investor in the magazine. The magazine prints ten issues per year and maintains an online presence. Unusually for an Irish media outlet, Village is avowedly left-wing, with a stated aim to challenge \\"the endemically complacent and others by the acute promotion of equality, sustainability and accountability.\\" Journalists who have contributed include Sara Burke, Frank Connolly, John Waters, Justine McCarthy, Gemma O'Doherty, Mary Regan, Naomi Wolf, Conor Brady, and Harry Browne. Other contributors include Niall Crowley, Constantin Gurdgiev, Germaine Greer, Enda Kenny, Conor Lenihan, and John Gormley. Controversy The magazine was sued by anti-Lisbon Treaty campaigner Declan Ganley in 2008 but proceedings were settled. In 2010 Village received legal correspondence from Lord Mayor of Dublin, Oisin Quinn, over allegations he should not have voted on high-rise issues in the city, as he had a stake in property that might benefit from changes. In the end Smith made a successful complaint to the Standards in Public Office Commission (SIPO) which found in 2011 that there had been a minor breach. It was one of only three successful complaints about politicians that had been taken at that stage in SIPO's history. In 2012 Village claimed that if the DPP did not pursue named bankers and allegedly corrupt individuals for corruption and other named offences it would initiate private prosecutions itself. But it did not do so. It claimed that it was to pursue an initiative with Jonathan Sugarman, former liquidity manager, against Unicredit Bank for breaches of regulations, but could not as his career had collapsed and he could not pursue his commitment. In 2014 Village exclusively published the redacted Ansbacher dossier, alleging a long-standing cover-up of ownership of offshore bank accounts by senior public figures and politicians. In 2015, uniquely among Irish-owned print publications Village printed allegations made by Catherine Murphy TD about interest rates paid by Ireland's richest man, Denis O'Brien, to state-owned IBRC bank . In 2016 former Donegal county manager, Michael McLoone, initiated High Court proceedings against Village for defamation after it printed what it claimed was an affidavit opened in court detailing multiple allegations made about planning in Donegal by former senior county planner, Gerard Convie. In March 2017, Village published a controversial cover depicting US President Donald Trump in crosshairs alongside the headline \\"Why Not\\", linked to an editorial explaining why it would be wrong to kill Trump. The headline garnered international coverage, being covered by right-wing outlets abroad, including FOX News. In late 2017 following the publication of multiple accounts from alleged victims of bullying and sexual harassment by Michael Colgan, then director of the Gate Theatre, including those of seven former employees who spoke to The Irish Times, Village published an editorial on the matter. Colgan initiated a defamation action in the High Court in January 2018, claiming the editorial associated him with Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein and actor Kevin Spacey, both of whom have been accused of sexual assault, and in Weinstein‚Äôs case, rape. \\"Your outrageous article seeks to associate our client with and make him the subject of the serious criminal allegations that have been published in the media regarding Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey and others with the clear defamatory inference that our client has been guilty of serious sexual crimes, including rape,\\" Colgan‚Äôs solicitor, Paul Tweed, told the publication in a letter sent on 16 November 2017, six days after the article appeared. But in October 2018 the magazine claimed the proceedings had not been served on the magazine or its editor; and as of November 2019 there was no sign the action was being advanced in the courts. In August 2019, far-right activist Gemma O'Doherty initiated legal action against Village Magazine.

Amatsukaze under attack on 6 April 1945 at South China Sea During the first year of the Pacific War, the destroyer was under the command of Tameichi Hara and participated in the battles of the Java Sea, Eastern Solomons and the Santa Cruz Islands. During the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal Amatsukaze sank the destroyer with two torpedoes and probably damaged with a third, but injudicious use of her searchlights attracted the attention of the light cruiser . The ensuing barrage silenced Amatsukazes guns, knocked out her steering engine and killed 43 of her crew but her turbines were not affected and she was able to withdraw at using emergency manual steering.Hara, pp.134‚Äì142 On 11 January 1944, while escorting a convoy of four ships in the South China Sea, Amatsukaze was torpedoed by the submarine . The resulting magazine explosion severed the bow of the ship and killed 80 crewmen. Miraculously, the ship did not sink. Presumed sunk, the ship was not discovered for six days until she was spotted by a patrol plane. Amatsukaze was eventually towed to Singapore where a temporary bow was rigged. On 6 April 1945, Amatsukaze was attacked by USAAF B-25s, east of Amoy (). Her crew managed to beach the ship; salvage attempts were abandoned on 8 April. On 10 April, the ship was scuttled with explosive charges. In 2012, the wreckage of Amatsukaze was found by a Chinese engineering ship. About 30 tons of the wreckage was salvaged, cut into pieces and sold as scrap metal before the intervention of local relics administration departments. According to Chinese media, a museum will be built to protect the remaining wreckage.http://szb.mnw.cn/html/2012-08/21/content_130105.htmhttp://bbs.zzfish.cn/read- htm-tid-629854.html References Bibliography  * External links * CombinedFleet.com: Kagero-class destroyers * CombinedFleet.com: Amatsukaze history Kager≈ç-class destroyers World War II destroyers of Japan World War II shipwrecks in the South China Sea 1939 ships Maritime incidents in April 1945 ","title":"Japanese destroyer Amatsukaze (1939)"},{"id":"4996982","text":"Elgandal Fort is situated amidst palm groves on the banks of the Manair River (a tributary of the Godavari River), approximately from Karimnagar on the Kamareddy Road in the Indian state of Telangana.

Formerly Celtic Boys Club, it was renamed in August 2018 at a time when four former affiliated individuals were awaiting trial for sexual abuse offences. The club operates teams in age groups from under-9 to under-19 and has helped develop many future professional footballers, particularly for Celtic F.C. with which they have historically had close links. History The Celtic Boys Club was founded in 1966. First based in Maryhill, the club was initially independent from the professional Celtic Football Club, but links started to strengthen as the Boys Club was allowed to use the training facilities at Barrowfield training complex on London Road. John Higgins, a Celtic scout, recognised the benefits of the club and a semi-formal agreement was made where the Under-16 side would act as a nursery for Celtic scouts to find players with potential to play for Celtic FC, although players from the Boys club are under no obligation to sign for Celtic FC. The various Boys Club teams have won numerous honours over the years. Their most notable win to date is their win at under-16 level in the 1974 European Youth Cup, defeating Manchester United 1‚Äì0 in the final, courtesy of a goal by George McCluskey. The club was rebranded in August 2018 as St Patrick's Sports Academy, with a new club logo and different style of green and white strip. =Sexual abuse= In 1996, former Celtic Boys Club player Alan Brazil stated that when he was 13 years old he had been sexually abused by the club manager, Jim Torbett. The allegations were heard at the Glasgow Sheriff Court in 1998, where Torbett was found guilty of shameless and indecent conduct with three juvenile players between October 1967 and March 1974. Torbett was given a prison sentence of 30 months. There have since been further allegations about Torbett; in May 2017 he appeared at Glasgow Sheriff Court having been charged with six offences; in April 2018, Torbett appeared at the High Court in Glasgow where he faced 12 historical sexual abuse charges dating from January 1970 to August 1994; a June 2018 trial date was set. On 5 November 2018 Torbett was found guilty of five counts of sexually abusing children and sentenced to six years in prison. Also in April 2017, Gerald King, a former chairman of Celtic Boys Club, was charged by police with non-recent sexual offences. King, 66, went on trial on 26 November 2018 at Glasgow Sheriff Court where he was accused of lewd and libidinous practices towards five boys and two girls while he was a Glasgow teacher, between August 1983 and June 1989; he was also charged with taking or permitting to be taken indecent images of children between January 1987 and December 1988 at Barrowfield. On 5 December 2018, King was convicted of five charges of using lewd and libidinous practises towards five victims between August 1984 and April 1989, and found guilty of taking indecent pictures of children in February 1987. On 7 January 2019 King was given a three-year probation order, ordered to do community service and put on the sex offenders register for five years. In April 2017, Frank Cairney, a former Celtic Boys Club coach and manager (who, in November 1998, had been acquitted of charges of shameless indecency towards young football players due to lack of evidence), was charged in connection with six alleged historical sexual offences. He appeared at Hamilton Sheriff Court on 11 May 2018, facing ten charges of alleged abuse between 1965 and 1986, including indecent assault, gross indecency and lewd, indecent and libidinous practices and behaviour. After Cairney's defence team requested a delay to investigate witness statements, the trial at Hamilton began in early December 2018 with Cairney, 82, denying all ten charges. On 14 December, Cairney was found guilty of nine charges of sexually abusing young footballers, placed on the sex offenders register and was granted bail before being sentenced. On 7 February 2019, Cairney was jailed for four years. In a trial in May 2019 at Edinburgh High Court, Jim McCafferty was jailed for six years and nine months after pleading guilty to 11 charges of abusing teenagers between 1972 and 1996. The victims abused by McCafferty were at Celtic Boys Club, Celtic's youth team, and youth teams he ran in North Lanarkshire. Professional players developed Celtic Boys Club has helped develop many future professional players, some of whom have gone on to play for Celtic FC.

He is known for coining the word \\"ethno- musicology\\" (which later became ethnomusicology) as a more accurate alternative to the then-preferred term, \\"comparative musicology\\". Biography Kunst was the only child of two musicians, and began to study the violin at only 18 months old. Drawn toward the study of Dutch folk songs, he continued to play violin throughout his life. He earned a degree in law from the University of Groningen in 1917, and pursued a career in banking and law for the next two years. While touring with a string trio the Dutch East Indies, he decided to remain on Java, and found a government post in Bandung. Meanwhile, he became interested in the Indonesian music, especially that of Java. He began an archive of musical instruments, field recordings, books, and photographs for the Batavia Museum (Batavia, Dutch East Indies is the colonial name of Jakarta). In 1936 he returned to the Netherlands, and in that same year became the curator of the Royal Tropical Institute in Amsterdam, which developed into one of the most important institutes of its kind in Europe. Later, he gave lectures on Indonesian music at the University of Amsterdam in 1953 and became a member of the faculty there in 1958. In 1956, Kunst released a bestselling album of folksongs, on Folkways Records, entitled Living Folksongs and Dance-Tunes from the Netherlands. Writings * with C. Kunst Van-Wely.

Rosendal Palace () is a Swedish palace pavilion located on Djurg√•rden, an island in central Stockholm. It was built between 1823 and 1827 for King Karl XIV Johan, the first Bernadotte King of Sweden. It was intended as an escape from the formalities of court life at the Royal Palace. Rosendal Palace was largely designed by Fredrik Blom, one of the leading architects of the time, who received a royal commission to draw and build the palace building after the original buildings burned down. Fredrik August Lidstr√∂mer, Stockholm's City Architect from 1818 to 1824, had been King Karl XIV Johan's primary architect at the construction of the original Rosendal Palace. After it burned down in 1819, Lidstr√∂mer also created the initial drawings for the replacement palace. These were then adapted and redrawn by Fredrik Blom, who had been an assistant to Jonas Lidstr√∂mer, father of Fredrik August Lidstr√∂mer. The Queen's Pavilion at Rosendal Palace (Swedish:Drottningpaviljongen)) and Guard's Cottage (Swedish:Vaktstugan) remained entirely the work of Fredrik August Lidstr√∂mer. The creation of the Rosendal Palace in the 1820s marked the beginning of the development of Djurg√•rden into a stately residential area. When King Oskar II died in 1907, his heirs decided to make Rosendal Palace a museum of the Karl Johan period and of the life of Karl XIV Johan. This makes Rosendal Palace a unique documentation of the European Empire style, in Sweden also known as the Karl Johan style. The Karl Johan style remained popular in Scandinavia even as the Empire style disappeared in other parts of Europe. The palace stands today largely as it did in Karl XIV Johan's lifetime. During the summer months the palace is open to visitors for guided tours. See also * Architecture of Stockholm  References  *Laine, Christian. Rosendals Slott, De Kungliga Slotten.

Akatsuki, built at the Sasebo Naval Arsenal was the first of the ‚ÄúType III‚Äù improved series of Fubuki destroyers, incorporating a modified gun turret which could elevate her main battery of Type 3 127 mm 50 caliber naval guns to 75¬∞ as opposed to the original 40¬∞, thus permitting the guns to be used as dual purpose guns against aircraft.F Fitzsimons, Illustrated Encyclopedia of 20th Century Weapons and Warfare (London: Phoebus, 1977), Volume 10, p.1040. Akatsuki was laid down on 17 February 1930, launched on 7 May 1932 and commissioned on 30 November 1932. Operational history On completion, Akatsuki was assigned to Destroyer Division 6 along with her sister ships, , , and , under the IJN 1st Fleet. She was taking part in maneuvers off Ise Bay on 1 August 1935 when she collided with the submarine at 14:27. I-6 suffered damage to her periscopes. Like others of her type, Akatsuki was modified during the middle 1930s, both to correct design deficiencies and to enhance combat capabilities. She participated in operations in the Second Sino-Japanese War, which broke out in July 1937. =World War II= At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Akatsuki was assigned to Destroyer Division 6 of Desron 1 of the IJN 1st Fleet, and had deployed from Mako Guard District to provide cover for landing operations in British Malaya and later for in operations against the Netherlands East Indies, including the invasion of western Java and in the Philippines.IJN Akatsuki: Tabular Record of Movement She attacked, but failed to sink the submarine on 17 March 1942. After returning to Yokosuka Naval Arsenal for maintenance in March 1942, Akatsuki was reassigned to northern operations, and deployed from ≈åminato Guard District in support of Admiral Boshiro Hosogaya‚Äôs Northern Force in the Aleutians campaign, patrolling waters around Kiska and Attu during June and July, and towing the damaged Hibiki from Kiska back to Paramushiro in the Chishima Islands. She continued to be assigned to northern patrols in the Chishima islands and Aleutian islands through the beginning of August.Morison. Aleutians, Gilberts and Marshalls, June 1942-April 1944. After maintenance at Yokosuka in late July, Akatsuki was reassigned as escort for the new aircraft carriers and , which it accompanied to Truk, and missions in the Solomon Islands and back to Kure Naval District. From October, Akatsuki was used for numerous ‚ÄúTokyo Express‚Äù high speed transport runs throughout the Solomon Islands.D‚ÄôAlbas. Death of a Navy: Japanese Naval Action in World War II.

On the night of 12‚Äì13 November 1942, in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, this unit encountered a task force of U.S. Navy destroyers and cruisers. Operating on the right flank of the Japanese battleships, Akatsuki is often credited with illuminating and then torpedoing : however, her junior torpedo officer, Michiharu Shinya ‚Äì one of her few survivors - later stated unequivocally that Akatsuki was overwhelmed by gunfire before being able to launch any torpedoes.Editors Note 1 http://www.combinedfleet.com/akatsu_t.htmThe Lost Ships of Guadalcanal by Robert Ballard and The Path From Guadalcanal by Michiharu Shinya Soon after illuminating Atlanta, she was heavily hit by American gunfire and sank early in the action near Savo Island at position , with the loss of all but 18 crewmen (out of a total complement of 197), who were later captured by U.S. forces.IJN Akatsuki: Tabular Record of Movement These crewmen were later imprisoned at the Featherston prisoner of war camp in New Zealand. On 15 December 1942, Akatsuki was removed from the navy list.

As son of a high-ranking Soviet diplomat Vladimir Yerofeyev, he spent some of his childhood in Paris, which accounts for why much of his work has been translated from Russian into French, while comparatively little has been translated into English. His father, who was the interpreter for Molotov in the 1940s, wrote a book of memories; his brother is a curator at the Tretyakov Gallery.  Biography  Erofeyev graduated from Moscow State University in 1970, where he studied literature and languages. He then did post-graduate work at the Institute for World Literature in Moscow, where he completed his post-graduate work in 1973 and received his kandidat degree in 1975 for his thesis on Fyodor Dostoyevsky and French existentialism. Erofeyev's work often contains pastiches of Dostoyevsky's work and themes. He became a literary critic, publishing works on Lev Shestov and the Marquis de Sade. He later organised his own literary magazine, Metropol, in which many of the big names of Soviet literature participated, including Vasily Aksyonov, Andrei Bitov, Bella Akhmadulina, and others. The magazine was put into circulation via samizdat, i.e., avoiding Soviet censorship. As a result, Erofeyev was expelled from the Union of Soviet Writers and was banned from being published until 1988, when Mikhail Gorbachev came to power. Victor Erofeyev currently resides in Moscow and frequently appears on Russian television, where he has his own program on the TV channel ¬´Kultura¬ª (\\"culture\\"); he is also a continual guest on a Radio Liberty, Moscow. Alfred Schnittke's opera Life with an Idiot is based on his story with the same name, which he made into a libretto for the composer. The 2012 Finnish documentary movie \\"Russian Libertine\\" is centered on Victor Erofeyev and his view of the protests leading up to the 2012 Russian Presidential election.

It was situated north of the previous ancient capital of Armenia, the city of Artaxata, along the banks of the Metsamor River, 35 km to the south of modern Yerevan. The site of the ancient city is currently not much more than a large hill located between modern Hnaberd (just off the main road through Hnaberd) and Verin Dvin, Armenia. Systematic excavations at Dvin that have proceeded since 1937 have produced an abundance of materials, which have shed light into the Armenian culture of the 5th to the 13th centuries.  Name  Ancient Armenian literary sources almost always give the name of the ancient city of Dvin as Dowin, although Dwin or Duin were eventually widespread. Later authors favored the Dvin appellation, which is the most common form given in scholarly literature.Pavstos Buzand, 5th-century historian The word was thought by Moses of Khorene of Middle Iranian origin, meaning hill, which was followed up in modern scholarly literature, but actually derives from a misunderstanding of Faustus of Byzantium.  History  Map of Dvin The ancient city of Dvin was built by Khosrov III Kotak in 335 on a site of an ancient settlement and fortress from the 3rd millennium BC. Since then, the city had been used as the primary residence of the Armenian Kings of the Arsacid dynasty. Dvin boasted a population of about 100,000 citizens in various professions, including arts and crafts, trade, fishing, etc. After the fall of the Armenian Kingdom in 428, Dvin became the residence of Sassanid appointed marzpans (governors), Byzantine kouropalates and later Umayyad- and Abbasid-appointed ostikans (governors). Under Arsacid rule, Dvin prospered as one of the most populous and wealthiest cities east of Constantinople. Its prosperity continued even after the partition of Armenia between Romans and Sassanid Persians, when it became the provincial capital of Persian Armenia, and eventually it became a target during the height of the Muslim conquests. According to Sebeos and Catholicos John V the Historian, Dvin was captured in 640 during the reign of Constans II and Catholicos Ezra. During the Arab conquest of Armenia, Dvin was captured and pillaged in 640, in the first raids. On January 6, 642 the Arabs stormed and took the city, with many deaths.Walker, C. Armenia-The Survival of a Nation, 2nd Ed., Routledge, London, √ß1990, p. 28 Dvin became the center of the province of Arminiya, the Arabs called the city Dabil. Although Armenia was a battleground between Arabs and Byzantine forces for the next two centuries, in the 9th century it still flourished. Frequent earthquakes and continued warfare led to the decline of the city from the beginning of the 10th century. During a major earthquake in 893, the city was destroyed, along with most of its 70,000 inhabitants. Following a devastating Daylamite raid in 1021, which sacked the city, Dvin was captured by the Shaddadids of Ganja, and ruled by Abu'l-Aswar Shavur ibn Fadl, who successfully defended it against three Byzantine attacks in the latter half of the 1040s. In 1064, the Seljuks occupied the city. The Shaddadids continued to rule the city as Seljuk vassals until the Georgian King George III conquered the city in 1173. In 1201‚Äì1203, during the reign of Queen Tamar, the city was again under Georgian rule. In 1236, the city was completely destroyed by Mongols. Dvin was the birthplace of Najm ad-Din Ayyub and Asad ad-Din Shirkuh bin Shadhi, Kurdish generals in the service of the Seljuks;Lyons, Malcolm Cameron and David Edward Pritchett Jackson, Saladin: The Politics of the Holy War, (Cambridge University Press, 1982), 2. Najm ad-Din Ayyub's son, Saladin, was the founder of the Ayyubid dynasty. Saladin was born in Tikrit, Iraq, but his family had originated from the ancient city of Dvin. Cathedral of St. Grigor Capital of Saint Gregory Cathedral of Dvin Situated in the central square of the ancient city was the Cathedral of Saint Grigor. It was originally constructed in the 3rd century as a triple-nave pagan temple with seven pairs of interior structural supports. The temple was rebuilt in the 4th century as a Christian church, with a pentahedral apse that protruded sharply on its eastern side. In the middle of the 5th century, an exterior arched gallery was added to the existing structure. At the time that the cathedral was built, it was the largest in Armenia and measured 30.41 meters by 58.17 meters. A 2-meter long cross excavated from the site of Dvin Ornate decorations adorned the interior and the exterior of the building. The capitals of the columns were decorated with fern-like relief, while the cornices were carved in the design of three interlaced strands. The interior floor of the structure was made up of mosaic multi-colored soft-toned slabs in a geometric pattern, while the floor of the apse was decorated in the 7th century with a mosaic of smaller stone tiles representing the Holy Virgin. It is the most ancient mosaic depiction of her in Armenia. By the middle of the 7th century, the cathedral was rebuilt into a cruciform domed church with apses that protruded off of its lateral facades. All that remains of the cathedral today are the stone foundations uncovered during archaeological excavations in the 20th century.

Description As the scientific name implies, gray treefrogs are variable in color owing to their ability to camouflage themselves from gray to green, depending on the substrate where they are sitting. The degree of mottling varies. They can change from nearly black to nearly white. They change color at a slower rate than a chameleon. One aspect that is unique to this frog appearance is that its legs feature a dark bandish pattern which then contrast sharply with the black-marked bright yellow or orange under the sides of its legs and arms. Dead gray treefrogs and ones in unnatural surroundings are predominantly gray. The female does not call and has a white throat; however, the male does call and can show a black/gray/brown throat during the breeding season. The female is usually larger than the male. It is important to know when trying to identify this frog that the appearance at a younger age is similar to others of the same species, but as the frog increases in age the appearance varies. They are relatively small compared to other North American frog species, typically attaining no more than . Their skin has a lumpy texture to it, giving them a warty appearance. This species is virtually indistinguishable from Cope's gray treefrog, the only readily noticeable difference being that Cope's Gray treefrog has a shorter, faster call. However, the call rates of both gray treefrogs are temperature dependent and at lower temperatures Cope's gray treefrog can have a call rate approximating that of the gray treefrog. The difference in call can be heard, but it is best quantified by counting the number of pulses per second in their whistled trills. The gray treefrog has a pulse rate of 16 to 34 pulses per second while Cope's gray treefrog has a pulse rate of 34 to 60 pulses per second. Even though there is potential for overlap, because of the temperature dependence of the pulse frequency the two species are easily distinguished where they occur together. At a given temperature, the pulse frequency for the gray treefrog is approximately 1/2 that of Cope's gray treefrog.http://frogcalls.blogspot.com/2016/03/gray-treefrogs-hyla-versicolor- vs-hyla_29.html The gray treefrog also has 48 chromosomes (4n), and is called the tetraploid gray treefrog in scientific literature. Cope's gray treefrog, or diploid gray treefrog, retained its 2n (24) original chromosome count. Hybridization between these species results in early mortality of many larvae, but some individuals survive to adulthood though they have reduced fertility. Both of these similar species have bright-yellow patches on their hind legs, which distinguishes them from other treefrogs, such as the bird-voiced tree frog.Bernard S. Martof et al. (1980). \\"Amphibians and Reptiles of the Carolinas and Virginia\\". Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press. . The bright patches are normally only visible while the frog is jumping. Both species of gray treefrogs are slightly sexually dimorphic. Males have black or gray throats, while the throats of the females are lighter.Thomas F. Tyning (1990). A Guide to Amphibians and Reptiles. Boston: Little, Brown and Company. . Tadpoles have rounded bodies (as opposed to the more elongated bodies of stream species) with high, wide tails that can be colored red if predators are in the system. Metamorphosis can occur as quickly as two months with optimal conditions. At metamorphosis, the new froglets will almost always turn green for a day or two before changing to the more common gray. Young frogs will also sometimes maintain a light green color and turn gray or darker green after reaching adulthood. Distribution and habitat Gray treefrogs inhabit a wide range, and can be found in most of the eastern half of the United States, as far west as central Texas and Oklahoma. They also range into Canada in the provinces of Quebec,Quebec range map , Quebec Biodiversity website Ontario, and Manitoba, with an isolated population in New Brunswick. The gray treefrog is capable of surviving freezing of its internal body fluids to temperatures as low as -8 ¬∞C.Adaptations of Frogs to Survive Freezing The gray treefrog is most common in forested areas, as it is highly arboreal. Its calls are often heard in rural residential areas of the East Coast and the Midwest. It prefers to breed in semipermanent woodland ponds without fish, but it also lays eggs in swamps, vernal pools, man-made fountains and water gardens, and even in rainwater-filled swimming pool covers. Behavior These frogs rarely ever descend from high treetops except for breeding. They are strictly nocturnal. Male gray treefrogs rarely have large choruses, as they are mostly solitary animals, but might vocalize competitively at the height of breeding periods. Gray treefrogs may congregate around windows and porch lights to eat insects that are attracted to the light. During the day they often rest on horizontal tree branches or leaves out in the open, even in the sun. Evidently they are less prone to overheating and desiccation than other amphibians and rely on their superb camouflage to hide them from predators. Breeding D. versicolor in amplexus Video of gray treefrogs breeding and laying eggs Mating calls and chorusing are most frequent at night, but individuals often call during daytime in response to thunder or other loud noises. Gray Treefrog, Missouri Ozarks In captivity Needs are similar to that of the American green treefrog.

He was born in Jerseyville, Illinois, the son of Robert Andrew and Miriam Munson King. In 1883 the family moved to Santa Rosa, California in an attempt to alleviate their son Arthur's chronic asthma. The asthma cleared up, and in 1890 they moved again to Fresno. In 1895 Arthur graduated from Fresno High School, then attended the University of California, Berkeley. He developed an interest in physics, and in 1899 he was admitted into their graduate school. He was awarded a Ph.D. in 1903, the first ever Ph.D. in physics awarded by that university. After winning a Whiting Fellowship, he spent two years in Germany, studying at Bonn and Berlin and travelling in Europe. His academic interests were focused on spectroscopy, and at the time these institutions were leaders in the field. In 1905 he returned to Berkeley and became an instructor. The following year he married Louise Burnett, and the couple would have two sons. The same year he published a paper describing the use of an electric furnace for use in spectroscopy.\\"Uber Emissionsspektra von Metallen im Electrichen Ofen\\", Ann. Phys., Leipzig, 16:360. Published in English as \\"An electric furnace for spectroscopic investigations\\". He was offered a position at Mt. Wilson Observatory in 1907, and took his leave from Berkeley. He spent much of the remainder of his career studying the spectra of elements and molecules, with particular focus on rare- earth elements. He also performed studies of meteors, including their spectra and directional paths. In 1929, he collaborated with Dr. Raymond T. Birge to discover the isotope Carbon-13, based on differences in the spectrum.\\"Science news Letter\\", October 5, 1929. Between 1901 and his retirement he published well over 200 papers in scientific journals. He served as president of the American Meteorical Society for a period, and also as president of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific in 1941. In 1943 he retired, but he became involved in war research at Caltech. There he studied the ballistics of torpedoes launched from aircraft. Finally in 1957, with his health failing, he died in Pasadena, California. The crater King on the far side of the Moon was co-named for him and Edward S. King.

The rule for determining the domain boundary may be as simple as a data type with an enumerated list of values. For example, a database table that has information about people, with one record per person, might have a \\"gender\\" column. This gender column might be declared as a string data type, and allowed to have one of two known code values: \\"M\\" for male, \\"F\\" for female, and NULL for records where gender is unknown or not applicable. The data domain for the gender column is: \\"M\\", \\"F\\". In a normalized data model, the reference domain is typically specified in a reference table. Following the previous example, a Gender reference table would have exactly two records, one per allowed value‚Äîexcluding NULL. Reference tables are formally related to other tables in a database by the use of foreign keys. Less simple domain boundary rules, if database-enforced, may be implemented through a check constraint or, in more complex cases, in a database trigger. For example, a column requiring positive numeric values may have a check constraint declaring that the values must be greater than zero. This definition combines the concepts of domain as an area over which control is exercised and the mathematical idea of a set of values of an independent variable for which a function is defined, as in Domain of a function.

Life Gertudis Bocanegra was born in P√°tzcuaro in what is now the Mexican state of Michoac√°n, to Pedro Javier Bocanegra and Feliciana Mendoza (d. 15 November 1783). She married Lieutenant Pedro Adv√≠ncula Lazo de la Vega, a soldier in the Spanish provincial forces of Michoac√°n; they had four children. Unusually for a woman of her time, Bocanegra had read the principal authors of the Age of Enlightenment. When Mexico's War of Independence began, she was quick to take sides. Her husband and eldest son joined the forces of Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla when the insurgents passed through Valladolid (now Morelia) in October 1810. Both died at the Battle of the Puente de Calder√≥n. She then served as a messenger for the insurgents in the region of P√°tzcuaro and Tac√°mbaro, helping to form a communications network between the principal locations of the rebellion. During the guerrilla war, she was sent to P√°tzcuaro to aid the rebels in the capture of the city. However, she was betrayed and taken prisoner by the royal army in 1817. She was subjected to torture to get her to reveal the names of other rebels, but she refused to give information to the Spaniards. Finally she was tried and found guilty of treason. Sentenced to death, she and one of her fellow insurgents were executed on 11 October 1817 at the Plazuela de San Agust√≠n in P√°tzcuaro. Facing the firing squad, she harangued her executioners before she was shot. She was 52 years old. Legacy She is known in Mexico as \\"La Hero√≠na de P√°tzcuaro\\" (The Heroine of P√°tzcuaro). A plaza was named in her honor in that city, and a bronze statue was erected of her. In popular culture Bocanegra was portrayed by Ofelia Medina in the Mexican biographical film Gertrudis (1992).

It is named after the Irish revolutionaries, P√°draig Pearse and his brother William, who were born there. It was previously called Great Brunswick Street, after the House of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, Hanover line. Location and addresses The western end of Pearse Street meets College Street near Townsend Street. Here, on the northern side, there is a Garda station, followed by the old headquarters of the Dublin Fire Brigade at the Central Fire Station. The Trinity City Hotel is over and beside the old fire station. Office buildings are on the southern side of the street, followed by Trinity College, Dublin. The offices of the Department of Social Protection are on the site of the Queen's Theatre, Dublin. Another building of note is (O'Neill's Pub) 37 Great Brunswick Street which dates from the 1850s and is still in the same ownership today. The DART crosses Pearse street beside St. Mark's church, and east of that is the former Antient Concert RoomsAntient Concert Rooms where W. B.

No. 43 is the former Erasmus Smith Commercial and Civil Service School, a bank and pub bracket the junction with Lombard Street, with Trinity College and the railway station and Goldsmith Hall opposite each other on Westland Row. Further east along the street is the Pearse Street Public Library, which has the Gilbert Library and the City Archives on its first floor. The street then becomes residential, including Pearse Square, until it reaches MacMahon Bridge at Grand Canal Dock, where numerous high-tech offices and high-rise apartment buildings in an area dubbed Silicon Docks can be found. The street becomes Ringsend Road, and later Bridge Street around Ringsend Bridge, on its continuation into Dublin 4. The Cuban embassy is located on this street. People Padraig Pearse, one of the executed leaders of the 1916 Rising, was born at 27 Great Brunswick Street in 1879. His father James established an ecclesiastical architecture and sculpture firm (fashioning stone and marble altars and gravestones) at the site a few years before Padraig‚Äôs birth.

Haslam is also a prominent donor for the University of Tennessee, having provided tens of millions of dollars to the school over several decades. Haslam's son, Jimmy, is the current owner of the Cleveland Browns, and his other son, Bill, is the former Governor of Tennessee. Life and career =Early life= Haslam was born in 1930 in Detroit, Michigan, the son of Melitta (Fry) and James Arthur Haslam.http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/washingtonpost/obituary.aspx?n=marie- haslam-kreuzburg&pid;=1676522http://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/james- arthur-haslam_117836104 His father was a World War I veteran who was, at the time, working for the Studebaker Corporation. The family lived for a time in Pennsylvania before moving to St. Petersburg, Florida. Jim was a star football player at St. Petersburg High School, and had offers to play at several colleges. He eventually chose the University of Tennessee, following a recruiting visit from legendary U.T. coach Robert Neyland. Haslam enrolled at U.T. in 1948. During the Volunteers' 1951 national championship season, he was a starter on an offensive line that helped his Sigma Chi fraternity brother, Hank Lauricella, to an All American season and a second-place finish in the voting for the Heisman Trophy. Haslam was a captain on the 1952 team, but missed the last few games of the season due to eligibility issues. Following graduation, Haslam joined the United States Army, with the commission of Second Lieutenant. He spent several months in Korea following the 1953 armistice that ended combat operations in the Korean War. After returning to Tennessee, he turned down an offer to coach the South Pittsburg High School football team, and instead joined LaFollette, Tennessee-based Fleet Oil. After about a year, Fleet president Sam Claiborne appointed Haslam head of the company's new Sail Oil chain of stations. =Pilot= In 1958, Haslam left Sail Oil to start his own company, having made an agreement with Claiborne that he would not compete in East Tennessee for three years. On October 9, 1958, Haslam and his first wife, Cynthia, incorporated Pilot Oil Corporation, the name of which was inspired by an insurance ad Haslam had seen while traveling in North Carolina. One month later, the company purchased its first filling station in Gate City, Virginia, for $6,000. This first station had four fuel pumps, and sold cigarettes and soft drinks. While waiting for his non-compete agreement with Fleet Oil to expire, Haslam focused on the Virginia and Kentucky areas. A former Pilot board member and early associate of Haslam, Jimmy Smith, later recalled that Haslam would sometimes spend days driving around a city, analyzing its traffic patterns, before deciding on a new location for a filling station. By 1965, Pilot had grown to a dozen stations, but was struggling with debt, and thus sold a 50% stake in the company to Marathon Oil. Marathon provided Pilot with a consistent supply of source oil and a $4 million loan, which allowed the company to further expand. In 1974, Haslam's wife, Cynthia, died suddenly, and his eldest son, Jimmy, then a student at U.T., took her place on the company's board of directors. Shortly afterward, Pilot expanded into the convenience store market. In 1981, Pilot opened its first travel center in Corbin, Kentucky, a move inspired by a visit to fellow U.T. alum Ken Pritchard, who was operating a travel center in Slidell, Louisiana. As Marathon began to complain about Pilot's expansion efforts, Haslam bought out Marathon's share of the company in 1988. In 1994, Pilot acquired 11 Pro Stop stations, making it the nation's second-largest truck stop chain. By 1995, Pilot was operating over 80 travel centers in 33 states and 51 convenience stores in Tennessee and Virginia, and employed over 4,000 people.Melissa Martines, Cynthia Moxley (ed.), Knoxville: Gateway to the South (Community Communications, 1995), pp. 260-261. That year, Haslam's son, Jimmy, moved up to CEO, while his other son, Bill, moved up to president. Haslam became the company's chairman. In 2001, Pilot partnered with Marathon- Ashland to form Pilot Travel Centers, LLC.Josh Flory, \\"Growth and Change: As Business Evolves, Haslam Siblings Find Their Roles Within and Without It,\\" Knoxville News Sentinel, January 18, 2011.

Retrieved: August 23, 2011. By 2008, Pilot was the nation's largest operator of travel centers, with locations in 40 states and Canada, and was the nation's largest seller of over-the-road diesel fuel.Rob Levin (ed.), Knoxville: Center of Innovation (Atlanta: Riverbend Books, 2008), p. 234. That year, Pilot bought out Marathon's share of Pilot Travel Centers for $700 million, and in turn, sold a 47.5% stake to CVC Investments. In 2010, Pilot Travel Centers merged with the bankrupt truck stop chain, Flying J, to form Pilot Flying J. This new company operates over 550 locations in 23 states and Canada, and employs over 23,000 people. =Politics= Haslam has long been involved in politics in Knoxville, Tennessee, where Pilot is headquartered, both in an active role, and as a Republican Party fundraiser. He was a fundraiser for both Senator Howard Baker in the 1960s and President Gerald Ford in the 1970s.Josh Flory, \\"Building on Experience as Knoxville's Mayor, 'Optimistic and Enthusiastic' Haslam Begins Leading State,\\" Knoxville News Sentinel, January 19, 2011. Retrieved: August 23, 2011. He was also appointed chairman of the Knox County Public Building Authority in the early 1970s. As chairman of this group, Haslam, a long-time proponent of metropolitan government, spearheaded the initiative to build the Knoxville City-County Building.Frank Cagle, \\"Big Jim Haslam: Knoxville's History Often a Choice Between Progressive Leadership and the Spirit of Cas Walker,\\" Knoxville Magazine, November 2008. In 1999, Knox County declined to reappoint Haslam to the Public Building Authority, which some interpreted as revenge for his support of a failed metropolitan government initiative the previous year. In 2002, Haslam's son, Bill, ran for mayor of Knoxville, bringing greater public scrutiny to the Haslam family. His opponent in the race, Madeline Rogero, consistently tried to portray Bill Haslam as a puppet of his father and the region's oil interests, which Bill Haslam staunchly denied. She also blamed Jim Haslam for UT's hiring of controversial president, John Shumaker, in 2002. During Bill Haslam's 2010 gubernatorial campaign, his opponents consistently brought up price-gouging allegations levied against Pilot in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. In 2006, Chattanooga mayor Bob Corker, a former college roommate of Jimmy Haslam and long-time family friend, was elected to the United States Senate. Jimmy Haslam was the financial manager for his campaign. Jim Haslam was the Tennessee state co-chairman for the 2012 presidential campaign of Republican candidate Mitt Romney.Tom Humphrey, \\"Gingrich Mounting Tennessee Campaign as Poll Numbers Surge,\\" Knoxville News Sentinel, December 3, 2011.

Part of this money was used to construct the new College of Business building, the James A. Haslam II Business Building, and part will be used to construct a new building for the School of Music, which will be named for Natalie Haslam. The money will also support construction of the Baker Center and renovations to Neyland Stadium. The Haslams are also major donors to numerous Knoxville-area institutions, including the Knoxville Museum of Art, the Knox-Area Rescue Ministries, the East Tennessee Historical Society, the Foothills Land Conservancy, the Boys and Girls Club, United Way, St. John's Episcopal Church, and the Knoxville Zoo. In 2006, three of the zoo's newborn lion cubs were named Ann, Bill, and Jimmy, in honor of Haslam's children.

Career Born and brought up in Weaste, Salford, McAvoy's first professional contract was given to him by Salford. He joined Salford in 1994 from Eccles ARL, where he played alongside Adrian Morley, Ian Watson and Carlo Napolitano. He made 118 appearances for the Salford City Reds, scoring 75 tries during his five-year stint at the club. Representative In 1994, McAvoy played for Great Britain under-21s against Australia. McAvoy won caps for England while at Salford in 1996 against Wales, and while at Bradford Bulls in 1999 against France, and France (sub). During his time at Salford, McAvoy was given the captaincy of the Great Britain Academy squad when they toured in New Zealand. He was also selected in the England squad for the 1996 European Championship, and he made his d√©but against Wales before being named in the squad for the 2000 World Cup. 1998‚Äì2003 Super League giants Bradford Bulls signed Nathan in 1998.

They are about the same size and shape as a pencil, hence the name. They were introduced during World War II and developed at Aston House, Hertfordshire, UK.  Types  = Number Ten delay switch = One type, the British Number Ten Delay Switch (official name, \\"Switch, No. 10, Delay\\" and often referred to as a \\"timing pencil\\"), was made of a brass (or in later versions aluminium) tube, with a copper section at one end which contained a glass vial of cupric chloride (the liquid was widely and erroneously reported to be sulfuric acid), while beneath the vial was a spring-loaded striker under tension and held in place by a thin metal wire. The timer was started by crushing the copper section of the tube to break the vial of cupric chloride, which then began to slowly erode the wire holding back the striker. When the wire eventually parted, the striker was propelled down the hollow centre of the detonator, hitting the percussion cap at the other end of the detonator. Number ten delay switches had delays ranging from 10 minutes to 24 hours and were accurate to within plus or minus two or three minutes in an hour's delay, and plus or minus an hour in a 12-hour delay, though environmental conditions could affect this. The switches were typically issued in packs of five, all the switches in a pack having the same delay. In use, two switches with the same delay (from different packs if possible) would be placed in the explosive charge in case one switch failed. ;Using a No. 10 delay switch: = L-Delay (\\"No. 9 delay switch\\") = Another, subsequent type, was developed by Millis Jefferis of MD1 known as the \\"Lead Delay switch\\" or officially \\"Switch, No. 9, L Delay\\". Instead of relying on the chemical action of a corrosive liquid on metal (which was subject to temperature variation), it used a piece of metal under stress - the metal in question being a lead alloy that was extremely affected by mechanical creep. A piece of this lead was notched to a set diameter, the diameter setting the time delay. When the starting pin was removed, this wire was placed under tension by the spring- loaded striker, and began to gradually stretch. After certain time it would snap at the notch and allow the striker to hit the percussion cap. The delay could be set from a matter of minutes to hours. Manufacture was entirely by MD1.Macrae, Churchill's Toyshop Generally speaking L-delays were slightly less reliable and had shorter delays, but were more reliable underwater (if a No. 10 fuze developed a leak, water would dilute the corrosive liquid and increase the delay or stop the fuze from working). = Percussion igniter = Another type of time pencil had a percussion cap but no detonator attached. Instead there was a crimping attachment at one end to allow pyrotechnic fuse to be crimped on. When a time pencil of this type fired, it would light the fuse which would burn towards a detonator crimped onto the other end. Because standard safety fuse burns at around half a metre per minute, it is not practicable to provide delays of more than a few minutes in this way. It was also possible to connect a pencil detonator to so-called \\"instantaneous fuse\\" (not to be confused with detonating cord) which had an unusually fast burn rate of over 7 metres per second.  Characteristics  Pencil detonators are colour-coded to indicate the nominal time delay, which can range from 10 minutes through to 24 hours. No. 10 delays were normally issued in a tin of 5, all of the same delay, while L-delays were issued in a larger tin which included a mixture of different delays to suit a variety of operations. The time delay of a No. 10 varies according to the concentration of the corrosive liquid in the vial. It is widely reported that the wire thickness varied also, but in fact all used the same diameter of wire. The time delay of a No. 9 is determined solely by the thickness of the notch in the wire, the spring tension, and the temperature. Pencil detonators could be used with any explosive provided a suitable booster was attached. However, plastic explosives (which did not require a booster) were particularly useful during the sabotage missions in which they were often employed. There were also a number of special charges issued with a time pencil already incorporated e.g. some types of limpet mines. After being activated a pencil detonator is silent in operation. It does not fizz or make any other noise. However, unlike clockwork timers, pencil detonators only give approximate time delays. For example, a 2-hour pencil detonator might be accurate to plus or minus 5 minutes, whereas the version offering a 6-hour delay could have a precision of plus or minus 15 minutes. Both No. 9 and No. 10 delays were also significantly affected by the ambient temperature, and were issued along with a chart of temperature corrections--but no thermometer. For example, a pencil detonator designed to fire 24 hours after being activated could in reality give a 30-hour delay - if the weather was very cold. Similarly, during hot weather pencil detonators designed to fire after a 12-hour delay could in reality trigger detonation within 10 hours. The main virtue of pencil detonators is their small size and light weight, plus the fact that they are very quick and easy to use. These are important points during covert operations.  Usage  For very high-value targets it is recommended that two pencil detonators from different batches be used together. That way if one detonator fails the other will almost surely blow the charge. Note that if both detonators were going to work, the explosion will occur at the minimum of the two times; thus this method will also slightly reduce the average delay. Pencil detonators saw heavy use during the Second World War by the Special Air Service, Special Operations Executive and groups such as the French Resistance. A number of pencil detonators were used to detonate the massive amatol charge hidden inside HMS Campbeltown during the St Nazaire Raid of 1942. The ship exploded over an hour later than anticipated. Approximately 12 million pencil detonators were produced in Britain during the war. However, in recent years they have been superseded by electronic timers which are more accurate and provide much longer delay times. Pencil detonator used in the July 20 plot in 1944 exhibitied in Milit√§rhistorisches Museum der Bundeswehr in Dresden (Germany) The briefcase bomb used in the July 20 plot used a captured British pencil detonator inserted into a block of British plastic explosives weighing approximately two pounds. The bomb was set to 30 minutes and detonated as planned, but Hitler survived with minor injuries. Stauffenberg could not prepare the second block, though. He got rid of it while driving through the forest to the airfield. His driver, Leutnant Erich Kretz, reported seeing Werner von Haeften throw something into the woods in his mirror.

The English rule provides that the party who loses in court pays the other party's legal costs. The English rule contrasts with the American rule, under which each party is generally responsible to pay its own attorneys' fees, unless a statute or contract provides for that assessment. The rationale for the English rule is that a litigant (whether bringing a claim or defending a claim) is entitled to legal representation and, if successful, should not be left out of pocket by reason of his or her own legal fees. It should be borne in mind that, in virtually all English civil litigation, damages are merely compensatory.

By 2016, the commemorations had taken place in 132 countries across the globe. The founders of the International Day Against Homophobia, as it was originally known, established the IDAHO Committee to coordinate grass-roots actions in different countries, to promote the day and to lobby for official recognition on May 17. That date was chosen to commemorate the decision to remove homosexuality from the International Classification of Diseases of the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1990. History Louis-Georges Tin, founder of the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia The day, as a concept, was conceived in 2004. A year-long campaign culminated in the first International Day Against Homophobia on May 17, 2005. 24,000 individuals as well as organizations such as the International Lesbian and Gay Association (ILGA), the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (IGLHRC), the World Congress of LGBT Jews, and the Coalition of African Lesbians signed an appeal to support the \\"IDAHO initiative\\". Activities for the day took place in many countries, including the first LGBT events ever to take place in the Congo, China, and Bulgaria. The date of May 17 was specifically chosen to commemorate the World Health Organization‚Äôs decision in 1990 to declassify homosexuality as a mental disorder. In 2009, transphobia was added to the name of the campaign, and activities that year focused primarily on transphobia (violence and discrimination against transgender people). A new petition was launched in cooperation with LGBT organizations in 2009, and it was supported by more than 300 NGOs from 75 countries, as well as three Nobel Prize winners (Elfriede Jelinek, Fran√ßoise Barr√©-Sinoussi, and Luc Montagnier). On the eve of May 17, 2009, France became the first country in the world to officially remove transgender issues from its list of mental illnesses. Frenchman Louis- Georges Tin was founder of the day, and acted as its Committee Chairperson until his resignation in September 2013. He was succeeded by internationally renowned Venezuelan trans rights activist, lawyer and law professor Tamara Adri√°n, who became one of the first trans legislators in Latin America in 2015. Louis-Georges Tin and two other Committee members started a hunger- strike in June 2012 to urge the French president Hollande to introduce a UN resolution decriminalising homosexuality.IDAHO founder begins hunger strike for UN resolution on decriminalising homosexuality retrieved 29 June 2012 In France, same-sex marriage has been legal since 18 May 2013; a decision announced on May 17. Biphobia was added to the name of the campaign in 2015. The Enforcement Act of Judicial Yuan Interpretation No. 748 that legalised same-sex marriage in Taiwan was passed on International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia in 2019, with the law coming into effect on 24 May 2019. Goals and activities The main purpose of the May 17 mobilisations is to raise awareness of violence, discrimination, and repression of LGBT communities worldwide, which in turn provides an opportunity to take action and engage in dialogue with the media, policymakers, public opinion, and wider civil society. One of the stated goals of May 17 is to create an event that can be visible at a global level without needing to conform to a specific type of action. This decentralized approach is needed due to the diversity of social, religious, cultural, and political contexts in which rights violations occur. May 17 around the world La Moneda Palace illuminated in LGBT flag for 2017 IDAHO The day is particularly strong in Europe and Latin America, where it is commemorated with public events in almost all countries. May 17 is also marked in multiple countries in all world regions including, in 2013, 32 of the 76 countries in the world where same-sex relationships are criminalised. Common actions include large- scale street marches, parades and festivals. In Cuba, for example, Mariela Castro has led out a huge street parade in honor of May 17 for the past 3 years. In Chile in 2013, 50,000 people took to the streets to mark May 17, and the VIII Santiago Equality march. Arts and culture-based events are also common. For example, Bangladeshi activists organised the music festival \\"Love Music Hate Homophobia\\" in 2013. Albanian LGBT activists have, in 2012 and 2013 been organising an annual Bike (P) Ride for May 17 through the streets of the capital Tirana. In 2013, the day's Committee called for international actions for a Global Rainbow Flashmob to mark May 17. Activists in 100 cities, in 50 countries participated with diverse public events spanning coloured balloon releases, dance flashmobs, musical events, and performance and street art. On Friday, May 17, 2019, Taiwan became the first country in Asia to legally recognize same-sex marriage. In Nepal, this day is celebrated as International Day Against Queer / MOGAI -phobia' as well as IDAHOT. Official recognition In 2003 the Canadian organization Fondation √âmergence instituted a similar event, the National Day Against Homophobia, which was held on June 1. In 2006, they changed the date to May 17, in order to join the international movement. In 2006, The Declaration of Montreal was created and adopted by the 2006 World Outgames. The Declaration demanded that the United Nations and all states recognize May 17 as the International Day Against Homophobia. In 2007, in Aosta Valley (Italy), the government approved the support for the IDAHOT In 2010, Lula, then president of Brazil, signed an act that instituted May 17 as the National Day Against Homophobia in his country. The day is also officially recognized by the EU Parliament, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, the UK, Mexico, Costa Rica, Croatia, the Netherlands, France, Luxembourg and Venezuela. It is also recognized by numerous local authorities, such as the province of Quebec or the city of Buenos Aires. In 2012, the city of Liverpool, England created a pioneering programme of events in association with the organisation Homotopia, called IDAHO 50. The event was supported by 50 leading organisations based in Liverpool. On March 21, 2014, Mexico declared, by Presidential Decree, May 17 as the National Day Against Homophobia. See LGBT rights in Mexico. Venezuela's National Assembly (AN) officially recognized May 17 as the Day against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia on May 12, 2016. AN Deputy Tamara Adrian, also international Chairwoman of the IDAHO Committee, hailed the legislative act as a \\"sign of change\\" in a Venezuela where \\"everyone has equal rights and opportunities\\". In several other countries (e.g. Argentina, Bolivia, Australia, and Croatia), national civil society coalitions have called upon their authorities to have May 17 officially recognized. Impact , 69 countries still criminalize same-sex relationships, which means that millions of gays, lesbians and bisexuals are unable to live their lives openly. Also, in 26 countries, transgender individuals are subjected to punishments, and they're disproportionely at risk of violence across the globe. IDAHOBIT is frequently used as a platform for organizing initiatives to advance the fight for the rights of LGBT+ groups in many countries, even in those (like Uganda) in which homosexuality is criminalized.

They may be built into luggage, or may be external locks such as padlocks or lockable straps. They are typically relatively simple low security locks. Security Luggage locks are typically low security locks. The shackles have a small diameter, and are easy to clip using bolt cutters or similar equipment. Luggage locks based on a pin tumbler lock design usually use only three or four pins, making them susceptible to lockpicking, even with tools as simple as a bent paperclip. TSA Accepted In the United States the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) requires access to luggage without the passenger being present; to allow travelers to lock their luggage they have accepted certain locks which they can open and relock.The TSA recommend that TSA accepted locks be used, as luggage locked using other methods must be opened by force in order to be inspected. Luggage locks accepted by the TSA can be opened by the authorities using publicly known universal \\"master\\" keys. Locks using this system are produced to meet standards set by Travel Sentry. Under agreement with the TSA, it is Travel Sentry that sets the standards for these locks and approves each design. Every lock with the Travel Sentry identifying mark (red diamond) is accepted by the TSA.

This resulted in the choice of the dual purpose (DP) 15.5 cm/60 3rd Year Type naval guns as the main battery in five triple turrets capable of 55¬∞ elevation. These were the first Japanese cruisers with triple turrets.Patton, Japanese Heavy Cruisers of World War Two, pp. 47-52 Secondary armament included eight 12.7 cm/40 Type 89 naval guns in four twin turrets, and 24 Type 93 Long Lance torpedoes in four rotating triple mounts. To save weight, electric welding was used, as was aluminum in the superstructure, and a single funnel stack. New impulse geared turbine engines, driving four shafts with three-bladed propellers gave a top speed of , which was better than most contemporary cruiser designs and the Mogami class has twin balanced rudders, rather than the single rudder of previous Japanese cruiser designs. The class was designed from the start to be upgraded into heavy cruisers with the replacement of their main battery with 20 cm/50 3rd Year Type naval guns in twin turrets. However, in initial trials in 1935, and were plagued with technical problems due to their untested equipment, welding defects, and also proved to be top-heavy with stability problems in heavy weather. Both vessels, and their yet-to-be-completed sisters, and Suzuya underwent a complete and very costly rebuilding program. Once rebuilt, the design, with its very high speed, armor protection, and heavy armament was among the best in the world during World War II. Service career =Early career= Fus≈ç. Suzuya was launched on 20 November 1934 at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal in a ceremony attended by Emperor Hirohito. She was completed in January 1936, but on completion was immediately placed in the reserves while waiting for dry dock space to permit reconstruction and modifications based on experience gained during trials of Mogami to strengthen her welds, and to add bulges to her hull to reduce weight. She was officially commissioned on 31 October 1937; however instead of entering active service, she immediately returned to dry dock for refit work to upgrade her main battery to the heavy cruiser format with 20 cm/50 3rd Year Type naval guns. These upgrades were completed on 30 September 1939, at which she was assigned to Kure Naval District as CruDiv7 of the IJN 2nd Fleet with her sister ships Mogami, Mikuma and Kumano. Suzuya, under the command of Captain Masatomi Kimura, was dispatched on 23 January 1941 as part of a show of force following the Battle of Ko Chang in the Franco-Thai War. She returned to Kure for maintenance, and then took part in training exercises and drills in Japanese home waters though June. From July 1941, she participated in the occupation of Cochinchina, French Indochina from her forward operating base on Hainan, after Japan and Vichy French authorities reached an understanding on use of air facilities and harbors. At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Suzuya was assigned to cover the invasion of Malaya as part of Vice Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa's First Southern Expeditionary Fleet, providing close support for landings of Japanese troops at Singora, Pattani and Kota Bharu. On 9 December 1941, the reported sighting of Royal Navy Force Z (the Royal Navy battleship , battlecruiser and supporting destroyers). The report was received by light cruiser , which relayed the message to Admiral Ozawa aboard his flagship, . However, the reception was poor and the message took another 90 minutes to decode. Moreover, I-65s report was incorrect about the heading of Force Z. Two Aichi E13A1 \\"Jake\\" floatplanes from Suzuya and Kumano attempted to shadow Force Z, but both were forced to ditch due to lack of fuel. Only Suzuyas crew was recovered. The following day, Force Z was overwhelmed by torpedo bombers of the 22nd Air Flotilla from Indochina. In December 1941, Suzuya was tasked with the invasion of Sarawak, together with Kumano, covering landings of Japanese troops at Miri. From her base at Cam Rahn Bay, she sortied with Kumano to cover landings of troops at Anambas, Endau, Palembang and Banka Island, Sabang on Sumatra and Java in the Netherlands East Indies from the end of December 1941 to the middle of March. Suzuya also participated in the seizure of the Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean on 20 March 1942. =Indian Ocean Raids= From 1 April 1942 CruDiv 7 based from Mergui, Burma joined with CruDiv 4 to participate in the Indian Ocean raids. Mikuma, Mogami and destroyer detached and formed the \\"Southern Group\\", which hunted for merchant shipping in the Bay of Bengal, while Suzuya, Kumano, and covered the northern areas. Ch≈çkai, light cruiser , aircraft carrier and destroyers , , formed a center group to reinforce northern or southern wings as necessary. Over the next few weeks, the northern groups claimed kills on a 4,986-ton American merchant vessel Exmoor, British 7,621-ton freighter Autoclycus, British 9,066-ton freighter Malda and the 2,440-ton British freighter Shinkuang. In total the commerce raiding expedition sank over twenty ships during their brief stay in the Bay of Bengal. Afterwards, Suzuya was withdrawn back to Kure for repairs, and was then sent to Guam to join the Midway Invasion Task Force. =Battle of Midway= On 5 June, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, CINC of the Combined Fleet ordered CruDiv 7 to shell Midway Island in preparation for a Japanese landing. CruDiv 7 and DesDiv 8 were away from the island, so they made a high-speed dash at . The sea was choppy and the destroyers lagged behind. At 2120, the order was canceled. However, this dash placed CruDiv 7 within torpedo range of the submarine , which was spotted by Kumano. Kumano signaled a 45¬∞ simultaneous turn to starboard to avoid possible torpedoes. The emergency turn was correctly executed by the flagship and Suzuya, but the third ship in the line, Mikuma, erroneously made a 90¬∞ turn. Behind her, Mogamis navigator, watching Suzuya, did not see Mikumas movement and turned 45¬∞ as commanded. This resulted in a collision in which Mogami rammed Mikumas portside, below the bridge. Both vessels were severely damaged. Suzuya returned to Kure on 23 June and CruDiv 7 was transferred to the IJN 3rd Fleet. After returning to Singapore, CruDiv 7 (Suzuya and Kumano) were tasked with covering the Invasion of Burma from 28 July 1942. While in the Straits of Malacca, Suzuya was attacked by Royal Netherlands Navy submarine , which fired four torpedoes, but missed. However, with the American invasion of Guadalcanal on 7 August, Suzuya was quickly recalled to the Pacific front. =Operations in the Solomon Islands= On 24 August 1942, CruDiv 7 joined Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo's Carrier Strike Force (, , and ) with cruiser northeast of Guadalcanal. During the resultant Battle of the Eastern Solomons, aircraft from the carrier sank the aircraft carrier Ry≈´j≈ç; but Suzuya was too far away to be in the combat. Suzuya subsequently patrolled between Truk and the Solomon Islands through the middle of October. On 26 October 1942, Nagumo's Carrier Strike force engaged the aircraft carriers , , battleship and cruiser in the Battle of Santa Cruz, sinking Hornet and damaging other ships. The battle was a long-range air battle, and again Suzuya was far enough away to avoid direct combat. In early November, CruDiv 7 was ordered to reinforce Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa's Eighth Fleet at Shortland, and participated on the bombardment of Henderson Field on Guadalcanal on 14 November. Suzuya, cruisers , , Ch≈çkai, Kinugasa and and destroyers , , , , and bombarded the air strip with 989 203 mm (8 in) shells. On withdrawing, the task force was attacked by the submarine (which missed) and aircraft from Enterprise and Guadalcanal. Kinugasa was sunk, Ch≈çkai and Maya were damaged; Suzuya escaped unscathed, and through early January 1943 continued her patrols and coverage of transport convoys between Truk, Kavieng and Rabaul. Suzuya returned to Kure on 12 January 1943 for repairs, at which time additional AA guns and a Type 21 air search radar were installed. She returned to Kure again on 6 April, at which time her dual machine guns were replaced by two triple-mount Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Guns. Suzuya departed Yokosuka on 16 June 1943, with another major resupply convoy to the Solomon Islands, and shuttled back and forth from Truk to Rabaul through the end of the year. On 18 July, Suzuya was attacked by Guadalcanal-based United States Marine Corps TBM Avengers off Kolombangara, but escaped without damage. On 3 November, Suzuya with Mogami and Chikuma were dispatched from Rabaul to bombard American forces that just landed at Empress Augusta Bay, Bougainville Island, but the raid was prevented to reach gun range thanks to US Admiral Merill's victory, sinking the cruiser Sendai. Suzuya was back in Rabaul harbor on 5 November, when the United States launched an attack with 97 planes from the carriers Saratoga and . Suzuya was one of the few ships not hit in the raid. Line drawing of Suzuya as she appeared in 1944 On 1 February, Suzuya assisted with the evacuation of Truk. Suzuya went into refit at Singapore on 24 March, at which time an additional eight single-mount Type 96 25 mm AA guns were installed. =Battle of the Philippine Sea= On 13 June 1944, Admiral Soemu Toyoda, CINC, Combined Fleet, activated the \\"A-Go\\" plan for the defense of the Mariana Islands. Suzuya was assigned to Admiral Kurita's \\"Force C\\" with the battleships , and aircraft carriersZuih≈ç, , , and cruisers , , Maya, Ch≈çkai, Kumano, Chikuma, , and . Later in the day, the Mobile Fleet's aircraft attacked Task Force 58 off Saipan, but suffered overwhelming losses in the \\"Great Marianas Turkey Shoot\\". At 2030 on 20 June, two hours after she was hit by torpedoes by Grumman TBM Avengers from the aircraft carrier , the exploded and sank. That night, Suzuya retired with the remnants of the Japanese fleet to Okinawa. Back in Kure on 25 June 1944, Suzuya was refit once again. Four triple-mount and 10 single-mount Type 96 25 mm AA guns were installed, bringing the total to 50 barrels (14√ó3 and 18√ó1) and a Type 22 surface search radar and Type 13 air-search radar were fitted. On 8 July, Suzuya departed Kure back for Singapore and Brunei, and was involved in fleet training and patrols in the Singapore-Brunei area through October. By this time, her Type 22 Kai 4M radar was upgraded to Kai 4S for fire control. =Battle of Leyte Gulf= In late October, the Japanese fleet assembled in Brunei in response to the threatened American invasion of the Philippines. On 25 October 1944, in the Battle off Samar, Suzuya engaged the three \\"Jeep carriers\\" in American Task Group 77.4, but was attacked by ten TBM Avenger torpedo-bombers. A near-miss destroyed her port propeller. At 1050, Suzuya was attacked by 30 other carrier aircraft. Another near-miss caused the Long Lance torpedoes in Suzuyas No. 1 torpedo tubes to explode, which in turn started other fires and damaged the starboard engine rooms and the No. 7 boiler room. Suzuya was abandoned at 1150, and at 1322 sank at . Destroyer took off Captain Teraoka and 401 crewmen. US warships later rescued more sailors. Suzuya was removed from the navy list on 20 December 1944. Though it has yet to be located, the wreck of the Suzuya is believed to lie in some 27,600 feet (8,412 meters) of water, making her one of the deepest shipwrecks on record.

Initially these were mostly in the attractive t√™te-b√™che format, but they also published a few single volumes, in the early years, and that number grew until the doubles stopped appearing in about 1978. The t√™te-b√™che format was discarded in 1973, but future double novels were continued for a while, Between 1952 and 1968, the books had a letter-series identifier; after that date they were given five- digit numeric serial numbers. The list given here covers every Ace book that was not a double, published between 1952 and 1978 (or later), for all genres. It gives a date of publication; in all cases this refers to the date of publication by Ace, and not the date of original publication of the novels. For more information about the history of these titles, see Ace Books, which includes a discussion of the serial numbering conventions used and an explanation of the letter-code system.

He is best known for his role in the development of the Colossal Cave Adventure game. Biography =Early programming career= Woods teamed with James M. Lyon while both were attending Princeton in 1972 to produce the unprecedented, excursive INTERCAL programming language. Later, he worked at the Stanford AI lab (SAIL), where among other things he became the SAIL contact for, and a contributor to, the Jargon File. He also co-authored \\"The Hacker's Dictionary\\" with Mark Crispin, Raphael Finkel, and Guy L. Steele Jr.\\"The computer contradictionary\\" by Stan Kelly-Bootle =Work on Adventure= Woods discovered the Colossal Cave Adventure game by accident on a SAIL computer in 1976. After contacting the original author by the (now antiquated) means of sending an e-mail to crowther@sitename, where sitename was every host listed on ARPANET, he heard back from William Crowther shortly afterward. Given the go-ahead, Woods proceeded to add enhancements to the Adventure game, and then distributed it on the Internet. It became very popular, especially with users of the PDP-10. Woods stocked the Kentucky cave that Crowther had written with new magical items, creatures, and geographical features. Crowther's game, which originally featured few supernatural elements, was transformed into a loose fantasy world featuring elements from role playing games.Jerz, Dennis G. (Summer 2007). Somewhere nearby is Colossal Cave Digital Humanities Quarterly. Woods can thus, in a sense, be considered one of the progenitors of the entire genre of computer adventure games and interactive fiction. By 1977 tapes of the game were common on the Digital user group DECUS, and others (see The Soul of a New Machine by Tracy Kidder for a human history of this period).

Habitat The plant is found growing on sandy or chalky soils. It is present at an altitude of above sea level. It grows in dry weedy places and roadside ditches, and in cereal crop fields. The plant has become quite rare in central and southern Europe because of the increased use of herbicides and intensive soil cultivation. This species is grown as an ornamental plant. Description Consolida regalis reaches on average in height. The stem is erect, hairy and very branched at the top. The roots grow into the soil up to a depth of , so the plant can survive long periods of drought. The leaves are alternately arranged. The inflorescence is a cluster with five to eight hermaphrodite flowers. The flowers are dark blue or purple with five sepals. The upper sepal is prolonged in a spur of long, pointing toward the back. There are eight to ten stamens. The flowering period extends from May through August. The flowers are pollinated by hymenoptera and lepidoptera. The seeds ripen from June through September. All plant parts are poisonous in large doses, especially the seeds, that contain up to 1.4% of alkaloids.

In April 2013 he announced he was stepping down as University of BC president, following an eight year term. He was named Officer of the Order of Canada in 2015.\\"Four Nova Scotians among Order of Canada honourees\\". The Chronicle-Herald, July 1, 2015. and, on 1 October 2017, he became the 346th Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. Education Toope graduated from Harvard University in 1979 with a Bachelor's degree in English Literature and European History. He then received two law degrees from McGill University in 1983, where he served as Editor-in-Chief of the McGill Law Journal. In 1987, he finished his PhD at Trinity College, Cambridge. Career After completing his PhD, Toope joined McGill University's faculty. He served as dean of McGill University Faculty of Law from 1994 to 1999. He is the youngest person to have held the position. During his tenure as dean, he led the then-largest capital campaign in Canadian law faculty history to build a new Law library, and oversaw the renewal of the faculty's curriculum. Toope then headed the Trudeau Foundation, named in honor of Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau.Waldie, P., \\"Cambridge‚Äôs Canadian leader seeks answers and justice for its slave-trade past‚Äîand finds controversy\\", The Globe and Mail, December 16, 2019. The Foundation is an independent, private, and non-partisan Canadian educational foundation that focuses on identifying outstanding talent in the social sciences and humanities, thereby building a network to promote public debate on issues of societal importance. The Foundation awards five fellowships and 15 doctoral candidate scholarships annually to recognize outstanding achievement in the humanities and social sciences that exemplify innovative public policy approaches and a commitment to public engagement. Established in 2002, the Foundation manages an endowment of more than C$140 million. In 2006, Toope became the 12th president and vice-chancellor of the University of British Columbia succeeding Martha Piper. He also held an academic position at the university as a tenured professor of law. He assumed the presidential post on July 1, 2006, and held the position for eight years, until June 30, 2014. On April 3, 2013, it was announced that Toope would leave the UBC presidency effective June 2014 to \\"pursue academic and professional interests in international law and international relations\\". In January 2015, Toope became the Director of the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs. On October 2, 2017, he became the first the 346th person to serve as Vice-Chancellor at Cambridge University in England, becoming the first non- Briton to do so. He is concurrently Professor of International Law at the Faculty of Law, a Professorial Fellow of Clare Hall, and an Honorary Fellow of Trinity College. Toope has consulted extensively to the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade and to the Canadian International Development Agency. He has won publishing awards from the American Society of International Law and the Canadian Tax Foundation. He has also conducted various human rights seminars for government officials in Canada, Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia, and was a member of the UN observer delegation to the first post-apartheid South African elections. He has also served as Research Director, Office of the Special Representative concerning the Royal Commission on Aboriginal People in 1991. In 2017, he received an honorary doctorate from McGill University. His service to the community includes serving on the boards of non-governmental organizations that promote human rights and international development, including the Canadian Human Rights Foundation, the World University Service of Canada and the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances.Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto, CV of Stephen J.

During his annual university address, in 2020 he announced Cambridge was removing fossil fuel investments from its portfolio. Controversy Stephen Toope caused controversy in relation to Jesus College's China/UK Global Issues Dialogue Centre. The China Centre website praised Xi Jinping‚Äôs ‚Äúnational rejuvenation‚Äù, until The Telegraph newspaper pointed out the term had been extensively used by Mao Tse- Tung for his policies. The Dialogue Centre published in February a supposedly independent report about telecommunications reforms. It praised Huawei, advancing ideas on the subject beneficial to Chinese interests.The report carried a laudatory foreword from the vice-chancellor of Cambridge University, Stephen Toope. On July 9, 2020, after Freedom of Information requests, Jesus College admitted it had accepted ¬£200,000 for the Dialogue Centre from a branch of the Chinese State Council, ¬£55,000 from another branch for the China Centre and ¬£150,000 from Huawei for the digital report Prof. Toope had glowingly praised. Until then, not even the Fellows of Jesus College ‚Äì the governing body ‚Äì had been informed.

He also served as the fifth mayor of the city of Oakland in 1859, and represented the 4th District in the California State Assembly from 1860-61. He also represented Oakland Township for many years on the Board of Supervisors of Alameda County, starting in 1857. He was elected to the board of trustees of the Town of Berkeley in 1884. He was instrumental in founding the First Congregational Church of Oakland.http://firstoakland.org/fccohistory.html Biography Shattuck was born in Crown Point, Essex County in northern New York state. His mother was Betsy Mather, a descendant of Increase Mather who was the president of Harvard from 1685 to 1701. His father Weston Shattuck, a native of Massachusetts, was a farmer who died when Francis was 12. Francis earned a teaching certificate by age 18 and was a schoolteacher for four years. He then moved to a small town in Vermont and worked as a store clerk, until he heard of the discovery of gold in California. He and a friend, George Blake, by then also his brother-in-law, took off for California. In 1852, Shattuck and Blake, and two partners they met in the gold fields, William Hillegass and James Leonard, claimed four adjoining strips of land in the area that became the central part of Berkeley. (See Kellersberger's Map) Shattuck was instrumental in getting the Central Pacific Railroad to construct a branch line into Berkeley in 1876, which connected the community and University of California with the main line and the railroad's ferry to San Francisco. Shattuck died after he was knocked down by a man exiting from a train that Shattuck was trying to board on Shattuck Avenue. He was buried with his wife Rosa M. Shattuck, his sisters, and their husbands George Blake, Henry H. Havens and Benjamin F. Lee at the Mountain View Cemetery in Oakland. Legacy Shattuck had four sisters, Millicent K. Blake, Elizabeth Havens, Mary A. Shattuck, and Eliza L. Lee. Millicent married Shattuck's original partner, George Blake. Shattuck, though married (wife: Rosa Maria Morse, b. 6/12/1834, d. 9/12/1908), died childless. His estate, including several Berkeley properties, went to his wife and to his nephew, John W. Havens, the son of his sister Elizabeth Helen Shattuck Havens. The principal avenue in the city of Berkeley, Shattuck Avenue, is named for him, as is a smaller street, Kittredge. The Hotel Shattuck Plaza occupies the site of his original home.

D. chrysoscelis is diploid, having two complete sets of chromosomes, the usual condition in vertebrates. D. versicolor is tetraploid, having double the usual number of chromosomes. Generally, D. versicolor is believed to have evolved from D. chrysoscelis in the last major ice age, when areas of extremely low temperatures divided populations. Despite currently sharing habitat, the two species generally do not interbreed. Description Showing variation in color Both D. chrysoscelis and D. versicolor have black-marked bright orange to yellow patches on their hind legs, which distinguishes them from other tree frogs, such as D. avivoca. The bright-yellow pattern is normally hidden, but exposed when the frog leaps. This \\"flash pattern\\" likely serves to startle a predator as the frog makes its escape.Tesler, P. Exploratorium The Amazing, Adaptable Frog. The Exploratorium. San Francisco. Similar hidden bright patterns are common in various Lepidoptera, for instance moths of the genus Catocala.Sargent. (1969). A suggestion regarding hindwing diversity among moths of the genus Catocala OF (Noctuidae). Journal of the Lepidopterists' Society 23: 261-264. Both species of gray tree frogs are slightly sexually dimorphic. Males have black or gray throats in the breeding season, while the throats of the females are lighter.Tyning, T. F. (1990). A Guide to Amphibians and Reptiles. Boston: Little, Brown and Company. . D. chrysoscelis male showing black throat Skin secretions from this species may be irritating or toxic to mouth, eyes, other mucous membranes. Distribution and habitat The range of D. chrysoscelis is more southerly; it is apparently the species found in the lower elevation Piedmont and Coastal Plain of Virginia and the Carolinas. In those areas, D. versicolor may be present only in the Appalachians. The bird-voiced tree frog, D. avivoca, is similar to D. chrysoscelis and D. versicolor, but is smaller (25‚Äì50 mm in length vs 32‚Äì62 mm for the gray tree frog). Behavior Metamorphs are typically green calling. In the Southeastern United States, Cope's gray tree frog breeds and calls from May to August. Isolated males start calling from woodland areas during warm weather a week or more before migrating to temporary ponds to breed. There they form aggregations (choruses) and call together. Chorusing is most frequent at night, but individuals often call during daytime in response to thunder or other loud noises. Eggs are laid in batches of 10 to 40 on the surfaces of shallow ponds and other small bodies of water. These temporary bodies of water usually lack fish, and females preferentially lay their eggs in water bodies that lack fish or other predatory vertebrates and have lower desiccation risk. Eggs hatch in about five days and metamorphosis takes place at about 45‚Äì65 days.Rubio, M. Atlanta's Backyard Herps. Accessed 2 June 2013.

He came to Sicily with Peter of Blois and Stephen du Perche at the direction of Rotrou, Archbishop of Rouen, cousin of Queen Margaret of Navarre, originally as a tutor to the royal children of William I of Sicily and Margaret. His mother was Bona, a patron of the Abbey of Cluny and a devota et fidelis nostra of the king in 1172. His father is unknown. From his name he was long thought to be an Englishman (\\"Walter of the Mill\\") but this interpretation is now rejected in favour of ophamilius referring to Walter as William II's protofamiliaris, the senior confidant of the king in his royal household, the familiaris regis. Biography Walter's first appearance in the historical record is at court as the Latin tutor of the children of William I in 1160. He rose through the ranks until he was a canon of the Cappella Palatina and a candidate for the vacant archiepiscopal throne of 1168, after the deposition of Stephen du Perche. According to Hugo Falcandus, Walter succeeded \\"less by election than by violent intrusion.\\" Nevertheless, without the support of the queen regent or of the influential Thomas Becket, his faction bribed Pope Alexander III into confirming his election and he was consecrated in the Cathedral of Palermo on 28 September. He received distinctly double-edged congratulations from Peter of Blois, who refers in a letter to his \\"humble birth\\". Walter was a constant companion of the court of William II, whose tutor he had been. He accompanied William to Taranto to await his Byzantine bride and, failing that, he crowned Joanna, daughter of Henry II of England, as queen consort on 13 February 1177. In 1174, the first fruits of a plan of the king and the vice-chancellor, Matthew of Ajello, began to flower. The pope issued the first of a short series of bulls favouring the cause of creating a new archdiocese in Sicily, centred on the Benedictine Cluniac abbey of Monreale, a recent foundation of William's. The abbot of said abbey would automatically be consecrated archbishop by any prelate of the realm approved of the king. The tradition of the Hagia Kyriaka, the chapel of the old Greek Orthodox metropolitans of Sicily, on the grounds of Monreale greatly strengthened the king's cause in an era when tradition was so valued. The archbishop of Palermo was greatly diminished in power by the consecration of the first archbishop of Monreale, in the spring of 1176. Walter began the construction of a new cathedral in Palermo at this time, to counter the effects of the beautiful Monreale, the new mausoleum of the Hauteville dynasty. On William's death in 1189, Walter fought vainly against the archbishop of Monreale over the body of the king. In 1184, Walter gave his support to the marriage of Constance, daughter of Roger II, with Henry, son of Frederick Barbarossa. He was one of the only ones, for Constance, as the only legitimate heir to the throne, was long confined to a monastery due to a prophecy that \\"her marriage would destroy Sicily\\". Although he supported Constance to succeed William II, at the request of Pope Clement III, he had to crown Tancred of Lecce king in his cathedral in early January 1190. He died of natural causes early in 1191 and was buried in his rebuilt cathedral. Besides the cathedral, reworked so many times over the centuries, Walter left as architectural nods to his patronage of the arts the chapels of Santa Cristina and Santo Spirito. The latter is the \\"church of the Vespers,\\" the church in front of which the first insult and the first murder of the Sicilian Vespers took place in 1282. Richard of S. Germano called him and Matthew \\"the two firmest columns of the Kingdom.\\" Modern historiography has been less kind. John Julius Norwich calls him \\"the most baleful influence on the kingdom,\\" because \\"there is no evidence of his having taken a single constructive step to improve the Sicilian position or to advance Sicilian fortunes.\\" He has been reckoned a leader of the feudatories against which all Sicilian kings fought for their royal prerogatives and, by Ferdinand Chalandon, as an imperialist who supported Henry in order to stand opposed to the inevitable civil war. In literature, Walter, on the basis of his supposed English birth, was credited as the author of a Latin rudiments by John Bale in the 1550s. L√©opold Hervieux identified Walter with the Anglo-Norman author Gualterus Anglicus. He went so far as to suggest that Gualterus' (Walter's) Latin versifications of Aesop's fables were intended to instruct and entertain the young William II. References Sources *Loewenthal, L. J. A.

He is currently the third-base and infield coach for the Los Angeles Angels of Major League Baseball. Early years Born in Bangor, Maine, Butterfield is the son of the late Jack Butterfield, a longtime college baseball coach who was vice-president of player development and scouting for the New York Yankees from 1977 until his death in November 1979. The younger Butterfield attended the University of Maine, where his father was head baseball coach from 1957 to 1974, and still resides in Orono, Maine. He also attended Valencia Community College and graduated from Florida Southern College, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1980. In 1976, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League, where he helped lead the team to the league title. Playing career During his active career, Butterfield was a second baseman in the Yankees' minor league system, playing for five seasons (1979‚Äì83) and batting .249 with one home run in 397 games played, largely at the full-season Class A level. A switch hitter who threw right-handed, he was listed at tall and . Early coaching career Butterfield's coaching career began during his professional playing days as a part-time assistant at Florida Southern (1979) and Eckerd College (1980‚Äì81). After his playing career ended, he became a roving infield instructor in the Yankees' organization, then a coach at different levels of the Bombers' farm system. He also managed the Short Season-A Oneonta Yankees (1989) and Class A Greensboro Hornets (1990) and Fort Lauderdale Yankees (1992), before joining the Major League staff of Yankees' manager Buck Showalter as first-base coach in 1994‚Äì95. After he was replaced by Joe Torre as the Yankees' pilot after the season, Showalter was promptly named the first manager of the expansion Arizona Diamondbacks, set to begin play during the National League season. Hired with two seasons to prepare for the team's debut, Showalter brought several Yankees' instructors with him to Phoenix, including Butterfield, to implement the Diamondbacks' player development program. Butterfield was named roving minor league infield instructor in 1996 and then, in 1997, manager of the D-backs' Rookie-level team, the Arizona League Diamondbacks. Butterfield then became the first third-base coach in the Diamondbacks' Major League history, serving under Showalter in 1998‚Äì2000. After Showalter's firing following the season, Butterfield returned to the Yankees as a minor league manager, helming the Tampa Yankees of the Class A Florida State League (2001) and beginning 2002 as manager of the Triple-A Columbus Clippers of the International League. However, the Clippers got off to a poor, 12‚Äì25 start and Butterfield was fired on May 16, 2002. Less than three weeks later, on June 3, 2002, Carlos Tosca, a coaching colleague of Butterfield's with the Diamondbacks, was appointed manager of the Toronto Blue Jays. He hired Butterfield as his third-base coach, beginning a -year tenure for Butterfield in Toronto. During that time, Butterfield served under four different Blue Jay managers.  Infield coaching career  Butterfield has earned a reputation throughout baseball as a premier infield coach. Orlando Hudson, who was recognized as one of the best defensive second baseman in baseball during his 11-year MLB career, and winner of the Gold Glove Award in and , has stated that Butterfield deserves immense credit for making him the defensive player he is. Under Butterfield's tutelage Aaron Hill, a shortstop by trade, became an above-average defensive second baseman. Butterfield worked very closely with the young and talented Blue Jays third baseman Brett Lawrie. It was announced on September 30, , that Butterfield would be the bench coach for the Blue Jays in , replacing Ernie Whitt. On October 30, 2009, it was announced that Butterfield would once again be the Blue Jays' third base coach for the 2010 season. During the 2010 off-season Butterfield was one of four finalists for the Blue Jays' managerial job, along with John Farrell, DeMarlo Hale, and Sandy Alomar Jr.. Two years later, after Farrell's return to the Red Sox as their manager for , Butterfield was again a finalist for the Jays' managerial opening. When John Gibbons got the Blue Jays' job, Butterfield joined Farrell and the Red Sox on October 30, 2012, as third-base coach. He served through the Red Sox' 2013 World Series championship season, coaching third base, positioning the infielders defensively, working with young players Will Middlebrooks and Xander Bogaerts, and helping to convert Mike Napoli from catcher to first baseman. Butterfield was rehired for with the rest of Farrell's staff after the World Series triumph, and remained the team's third-base and infield coach through October 26, 2017, when, two weeks after Farrell's firing, Butterfield took a similar job on the staff of the Chicago Cubs. Butterfield was hired by the Los Angeles Angels as their third base coach prior to the 2020 season.

PhoneArena gave the phone a 6.1 out of 10, complimenting its big display size, solid build and good ringing volume but panning its big size and low camera quality stating \\"The 6131 is a typical mid-level phone and the only thing that stands out in its specifications are the displays' supported colors. Yet they do not look that good in reality. It's big-sized and relatively well built, and the opening mechanism is a big plus but closing the phone with only one hand is a problem as there are no mechanics to help you do this. The speaker made a nice impression as it's loud and clear, but the sound during a call is not that good, and the vibrating alert is too weak. We're glad that there is a music player but it lacks advanced functionality and is quite uncomfortable, unlike the Radio which has an easy to use interface.\\"  References  External links *Official Nokia 6131 page *Official Nokia 6131 NFC page *Official Nokia 6126 page 6131 Mobile phones introduced in 2006 ","title":"Nokia 6131"},{"id":"4997609","text":"Jabez Vodrey (1795‚Äì1861) was the first English potter west of the Appalachian Mountains. Early years Vodrey was born on January 14, 1795 in Tunstall, an area in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire. This is a centuries-old center of the English pottery industry. He is thought to be a cousin of Frederick Vodrey, who emigrated from Staffordshire to Dublin, Ireland in the late 19th century and founded an art pottery there. Emigration and first American potteries In 1827, Vodrey and his wife, Sarah Nixon Vodrey, emigrated to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania United States, with another Staffordshire potter, William Frost. Vodrey and Frost operated a pottery in Pittsburgh for about two years. In 1829, Vodrey moved alone to Louisville, Kentucky, where he continued to work as a potter for the next decade. In 1839, Vodrey moved to Troy, Indiana (Perry County), on the Ohio River. There he took over the operation of the abandoned pottery of James Clews. It was not a success, as skilled labor was almost impossible to procure. Years in East Liverpool, Ohio In March 1847, Vodrey came to East Liverpool, Ohio, where he found work in the area's booming pottery industry. He began in East Liverpool with the manufacture of clay smoking pipes and by 1848, had formed a partnership with William Woodward, a wealthy farmer. Together, the two men produced simple yellow ware and Rockingham Pottery. Within months, their small pottery was destroyed by fire, but the men began to rebuild the pottery with the financial backing of brothers James and John Simpson Blakely. The new pottery of Woodward, Blakely and Company called its ware Phoenix, in honor of their success in rising from the ashes of the first pottery Woodward and Vodrey had founded together. By 1852, the company employed more than six dozen workers in five buildings. A series of serious setbacks, including an Ohio River flood and a strike, decimated the business and by the end of 1857, it was essentially defunct. Meanwhile, Vodrey's sons William, James and John were busy converting an abandoned East Liverpool church into a pottery. By the spring of 1858, the Vodrey and Brother Pottery Company was operating at full capacity, producing Rockingham and yellow ware. Later life Jabez Vodrey died in 1861. His son John was killed in the Battle of New Hope Church, Georgia while fighting for the Union Army's 46th Pennsylvania Infantry on May 25, 1864. Despite these setbacks, the family pottery prospered for an additional six decades. In 1876, the pottery began production of white ironstone. In 1896, it changed its name to the Vodrey Pottery Company and semi-porcelain became part of its offerings. Until it closed its doors for good in 1928, Vodrey Pottery produced domestic and commercial dinnerware and chamber ware. Vodrey and his wife, Sarah Nixon Vodrey, are both buried at East Liverpool's Riverview Cemetery. Descendants of the Vodrey family remain in the area.

The ship was named after Mount Kinugasa, located in Yokosuka, Kanagawa, Japan. Background Kinugasa and her sister ship were originally planned as the third and fourth vessels in the of heavy cruisers. However, design issues with the Furutakas resulted in modifications including twin turrets and an aircraft catapult. These modifications created yet more weight to an already top-heavy design, causing stability problems. Nevertheless, Kinugasa played an important role in the opening stages of World War II. Service career =Pre-World War II= Kinugasa was completed on 30 September 1927 at the Kawasaki shipyards in Kobe. Her early service was as flagship of the Fifth Squadron (Sentai), and she operated for virtually her entire career with that unit and the Sixth and Seventh Squadrons. In 1928, she became the first Japanese combat ship to carry an aircraft catapult. During a training exercise on 11 July 1929, the Japanese submarine I-55 accidentally collided with Kinugasa while using Kinugasa as a target. I-55 suffered damage to her bow plating in the collision. Kinugasa served off the China coast in 1928‚Äì1929 and on several occasions during the 1930s. Placed in reserve in September 1937, Kinugasa was extensively modernized at the Sasebo Navy Yard and not recommissioned until the end of October 1940. =World War II= In 1941, Kinugasa was assigned to Cruiser Division 6 (CruDiv6), as flagship of Rear Admiral Aritomo Goto as part of the First Fleet under overall command of Vice Admiral Takasu Shiro. CruDiv 6 consisted of Kinugasa, , and . At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, CruDiv6 was engaged in the invasion of Guam, following which it participated in the second invasion of Wake Island. From January‚ÄìMay 1942, Kinugasa was based out of Truk, in the Caroline Islands where it provided protection for the landings of Japanese troops in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea at Rabaul, Kavieng, Buka, Shortland, Kieta, Manus Island, Admiralty Islands and Tulagi. Battle of Coral Sea At the Battle of the Coral Sea, CruDiv 6 departed Shortland and effected a rendezvous at sea with the light carrier At 11:00 on 7 May 1942, north of Taguli Island, Sh≈çh≈ç was attacked and sunk by 93 Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers and Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bombers from and . The following day, 46 SBDs, 21 TBDs and 15 Grumman F4F Wildcats from Yorktown and Lexington severely damaged the carrier above the waterline and forced her retirement. Furutaka and Kinugasa, undamaged in the battle, escorted Sh≈çkaku back to Truk. World War II recognition drawing of Kinugasa Kinugasa was withdrawn to Japan in June 1942 for repairs, and returned to Truk by 4 July. Following the major reorganization of 14 July 1942, Kinugasa came under the newly created Eighth Fleet under Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa, based at Rabaul. The Battle of Savo Island In the Battle of Savo Island on 9 August 1942, the four heavy cruisers of CruDiv 6 (Aoba, Kako, Furutaka and Kinugasa), the heavy cruiser , light cruisers and and destroyer engaged the Allied forces in a night gun and torpedo action. At about 23:00, Ch≈çkai, Furutaka and Kako all launched their reconnaissance floatplanes. The circling floatplanes dropped flares illuminating the targets and all the Japanese ships opened fire. The Allied cruisers , , and were sunk. The cruiser was damaged as were the destroyers and . On the Japanese side, Ch≈çkai was hit three times, Kinugasa twice (once in her No. 1 Engine Room by an 8-inch shell from Vincennes that did not explode but caused some damage, killed one man and wounded another,Lacroix, Japanese Cruisers, p. 307 and one in a storeroom aft that was flooded by a 5-inch shell from Patterson), Aoba once, and Furutaka was not damaged. The heavily laden American invasion transports off Guadalcanal were unprotected, but Admiral Mikawa, unaware that Admiral Fletcher had withdrawn his aircraft carriers covering the invasion, feared an air attack at daybreak and ordered a retirement. Captain Sawa of Kinugasa, frustrated, launched a spread of torpedoes from Kinugasas starboard tubes at the Allied transports distant, but all missed. The following day as CruDiv6 approached Kavieng, Kako was torpedoed and sunk by the US submarine . Battle of Cape Esperance At the Battle of Cape Esperance on 11 October 1942, CruDiv 6's (Aoba, Furutaka and Kinugasa), and destroyers and departed Shortland to provide cover for a troop reinforcement convoy by shelling Henderson Field on Guadalcanal. The fleet was spotted, coming down \\"the Slot\\" at , by two Vought OS2U Kingfisher reconnaissance floatplanes. So alerted, the radar-equipped American cruisers , , , and and five destroyers steamed around the end of Guadalcanal to block the entrance to Savo Sound. At 22:35, Helenas radar spotted the Japanese fleet, and the Americans successfully crossed the Japanese \\"T\\". Both fleets opened fire, but Admiral Goto, thinking that he was under friendly fire, ordered a 180-degree turn that exposed each of his ships to the American broadsides. Aoba was damaged heavily, and Admiral Goto was mortally wounded. Furutaka was hit by a torpedo that flooded her forward engine room and was subsequently sunk by , and . Kinugasa straddled Boise and Salt Lake City with 8-inch salvos, knocking out Boises No. 1 and 2 turrets. Kinugasa sustained four hits in the engagement. The following morning, Kinugasa was attacked but not damaged by five American planes, and then returned to Shortland. Naval Battle of Guadalcanal On 14 October 1942, Kinugasa was designated flagship of Crudiv 6. The following day, Kinugasa and Ch≈çkai bombarded Henderson Field on Guadalcanal with a total of 752 8-inch shells. From 24‚Äì26 October and 1‚Äì5 November, Kinugasa and Ch≈çkai provided cover for replacement convoys of troops and equipment to bolster Japanese defenses at Guadalcanal. On 14 November, during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, Kinugasa was attacked by Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers and Douglas SBD Dauntlesses from and USMC Avengers from Guadalcanal. At 09:36, a 500-pound bomb hit Kinugasas machine gun mount in front of the bridge, starting a fire in the forward gasoline storage area. Captain Sawa and his executive officer were killed by the bomb, and Kinugasa gradually began to list to port.

Map of the Kyiv Reservoir. The Kyiv Cistern (), locally the Kyiv Sea, is a large water reservoir located on the Dnieper River in Ukraine. Named after the city of Kyiv, which lies to the south, it covers a total area of within the Kyiv Oblast. The reservoir was formed in 1960-1966, as a result of the Kyiv Hydroelectric Power Plant dam being built at Vyshhorod. The reservoir is mainly used for hydroelectricity generation, industrial and public consumption, and irrigation. The reservoir is 110 km in length, 12 km in width, has a depth of four to eight meters, a volume of , and a usable volume of . The reservoir, together with the Kakhovka Reservoir, the Dnieper Reservoir, the Kamianske Reservoir, the Kremenchuk Reservoir, and the Kaniv Reservoir, has created a deep-water route on the river. However, the construction has also contributed to significant environmental problems such as the diminished flow velocity which reduces water oxygenation, and has a negative result on the balance of aquatic life forms. Also, during its construction some nearby villages were flooded. One of these was Teremtsi, where the residents of the village persuaded Soviet authorities to let them stay, only to be evacuated later in 1986.  Safety issues  Like all Dnieper reservoirs, Kyiv reservoir poses potential threat of tremendous flooding if its dam is destroyed. Moreover, it contains additional major threat - after the Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster in 1986, radionuclides washed away by rains badly contaminated the bottom silt of the reservoir. During the years following the disaster, there were suggestions to drain the reservoir because it was too shallow. It appeared that, if done, this might have created the threat of radioactive dust travelling by wind, possibly affecting Europe. A similar threat is permanently discussed regarding the potential destruction of the reservoir's dam (as a result of natural accident or terrorist damage). But the authorities continue to dismiss such dangers as unreal, claiming to be in full control of the dam's safety. However, serious concerns were raised in 2005, when a fake terrorist alert was made. 263px 237px 237px 265px  See also  * Threat of the Dnieper reservoirs * –ö–æ–º—Å–æ–º–æ–ª—å—Å–∫–∞—è –ø—Ä–∞–≤–¥–∞ –æ–± —É–≥—Ä–æ–∑–∞—Ö –ø–ª–æ—Ç–∏–Ω—ã –ö–∏–µ–≤—Å–∫–æ–π –ì–≠–° –∏ –≤–æ–¥–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–∏–ª–∏—â–∞ * ‚Äú–ê—Ä–≥—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç—ã –∏ —Ñ–∞–∫—Ç—ã‚Äù –æ —Ä–µ–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö —É–≥—Ä–æ–∑–∞—Ö –¥–∞–º–±—ã –ö–∏–µ–≤—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –≤–æ–¥–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–∏–ª–∏—â–∞ –∏ –ì–≠–° * ‚Äú–ò–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–∏—è‚Äù –æ –ø—Ä–æ–±–ª–µ–º–∞—Ç–∏–∫–µ –ø–ª–æ—Ç–∏–Ω—ã –ö–∏–µ–≤—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –≤–æ–¥–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–∏–ª–∏—â–∞ –∏ –ì–≠–° * –≠–∫—Å–ø–µ—Ä—Ç –£–ù–ò–ê–ù –æ–± —É–≥—Ä–æ–∑–∞—Ö –¥–∞–º–±—ã –ö–∏–µ–≤—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –≤–æ–¥–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–∏–ª–∏—â–∞  External links  * Reservoirs of the Dnieper River Geography of Kyiv Reservoirs built in the Soviet Union Reservoirs in Ukraine Geography of Kiev Oblast ","title":"Kyiv Reservoir"},{"id":"4997636","text":"Donald Woods (1933‚Äì2001) was a South African journalist and activist.

National Life and Accident began in 1900 as the National Sick and Accident Association, a mutual company. It was reorganized as a stock company and adopted the National Life name shortly thereafter. It was purchased by a rival company in 1982. The motto of National Life & Accident was \\"We Shield Millions\\". The radio station call letters \\"WSM\\" seen on the microphones of the Grand Ole Opry reflected the motto of National Life, which the insurance company owned until the 1980s. \\"Sick and accident\\" policies In December 1901, the National Sick and Accident Association was sold to C. A. Craig to settle an estate. By 1902, the company was nearly insolvent. In the early years, the company's business consisted primarily of low-premium, low-benefit \\"sick and accident\\" policies, which is a form of disability insurance that paid the owner a stated amount for every week he was unable to work due to illness or injury. To prevent fraud, it was necessary for the amount of the benefit to be somewhat less than what the insured earned through regular employment. The vast majority of these policies, especially in the early years, were sold on the \\"debit system\\" (also called \\"home service insurance\\"), meaning that an insurance agent employed by the company, usually the one responsible for selling the policy initially, made periodic visits to the clients home to collect the premium (and, generally, to sell or attempt to sell more insurance). The frequency of these visits varied but was usually (especially in the early years) weekly; in later years, more of the collection visits were on a biweekly or monthly basis. Most of the company's clients were African Americans. Industrial life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance The company soon expanded into \\"industrial life insurance,\\" so called because it was generally aimed at industrial workers, which was also sold on the debit system, and accidental death and dismemberment insurance, which rather than a weekly income paid a stated, fixed amount, if the insured died by accident or lost sight or use of an eye or a limb. The industrial life insurance plans were usually for small face amounts: typically $250, $500, or $1,000 in the early year. They featured double indemnity for accidental loss of life, which could be triple indemnity or even more if death occurred as the result of an accident on a public conveyance. (For this reason these plans were often derided by their detractors as \\"streetcar insurance.\\") Expansion The company gradually expanded its operations to the southern eastern seaboard and eventually covered most of the continental U.S. except for the northeastern states, the Rocky Mountain states, and the Pacific Northwest. It also began to write \\"ordinary life\\" insurance to better risks, such as middle class office workers, religious ministers, accountants, bankers, and similar persons. Its greatest marketing development, however, was probably its beginning WSM radio October 5, 1925. Taking its callsign from the company's motto, We Shield Millions (which was in turn taken from its shield-shaped logo), the station began to broadcast advertising, including the company's own messages, over its powerful 1,000 watt station, which in January, 1927 powered up to 5,000 watts, and in November, 1932, became a 50,000-watt Clear channel station (clear channel meaning no other station could broadcast on that frequency). Its studios were initially in the National Life office building in downtown Nashville at Seventh and Union Streets. On November 28, 1925, management began the program that was soon the become the Grand Ole Opry, which made country music (then generally referred to as \\"hillbilly music\\") more mainstream than it had been previously. On September 25, 1950, the company spawned Nashville's first television station, WSM-TV (now WSMV-TV). Economic changes The company, along with nearly all U.S. life insurers, faced a crisis with the coming of the Great Depression in 1929; like many of them, it survived largely by offering its clients policy loans against the plans' cash values. With World War II came another crisis due to the manpower shortage brought about by conscription; in some areas, premium collections, at least on a weekly basis, had to be curtailed (gasoline rationing played a factor here as well) and many clients who were used to having their premiums collected in person by an agent found themselves having to take the initiative to mail in their premiums or lose their coverage. By the mid-1960s the company had outgrown its home office location in downtown Nashville. It had also been somewhat shamed when one of its principal competitors, the Life and Casualty Insurance Company of Tennessee (\\"L&C;\\"), built a 31-story skyscraper which had opened in 1957 and which was, briefly, Nashville's only skyscraper and the tallest building in the Southeast. The new National Life building, across the street from the Tennessee State Capitol, had 30 stories and was both considerably larger and located on higher ground, so it appeared to be grander than that of its rival, which was part of the intended effect. By this point, the television studios of WSM (which had begun in 1950 and was the first Nashville television station) had moved to West Nashville near the station's transmitting tower; the radio stations were soon to follow. About the same time as plans were finalized to move the station, a plan was announced to build a theme park on the property of Rudy's Farm, a sausage company located in the Pennington Bend of the Cumberland River. This park opened in 1972 and was known as \\"Opryland USA.\\" Other than the usual selection of thrill rides and \\"kiddie rides,\\" the park featured shows of all genres of American music, not just country. Construction began on the new Grand Ole Opry House at about the same time, and the Opry left the Ryman Auditorium for the new facility in March 1974. At about the same time as the home office move was undertaken, a holding company was formed to buy all National Life stock. This organization was known as \\"NLT Corporation,\\" with the \\"NL\\" standing for \\"National Life\\" and the \\"T\\" standing for Third National Bank, one of Nashville's leading banks at the time (acquired in the 1990s by SunTrust). However, banking laws and regulations thwarted the attempt to acquire Third National; the holding company business form was maintained. Another important development of the 1970s was the phasing out of weekly premiums; the former weekly premium amount was multiplied by 4.3 and became the monthly premium for the coverage. In the early 1980s, Houston's American General Corporation, another insurance holding company, announced a hostile takeover bid for NLT. NLT made a counter-offer to buy out AGC. In 1982 AGC, which had owned rival Life and Casualty since the 1960s, triumphed. Having acquired NLT, AGC began to merge the former rivals (not fully completed until almost the end of the decade) and to spin-off the \\"non-core\\" assets of NLT, particularly the entertainment properties. The Grand Ole Opry, Opryland theme park, WSM and fledgling cable television network TNN: \\"The Nashville Network\\" were sold to what became Gaylord Entertainment Company. American General would later merge into New York-based American International Group (AIG). Its division of the corporation is now branded as American General. In the late 1990s the former National Life/American General building was sold to the State of Tennessee and is today known as the William R. Snodgrass Tennessee Tower, named in honor of the state's former comptroller.

The largest sector of employment was agriculture in husbandry, which employed 19.1% of the economically active population, followed by wholesale and retail, which employed 16.8% and manufacturing, which employed 11.9%.  Climate  History Lienzo de Tlaxcala showing the conquest of the town of Tlaltenanpan In 1530, the Valley of Tlaltenango was inhabited by the indigenous Caxcans who farmed the land on the river banks and certainly enjoyed the abundance of flora and fauna of the mountain ranges that surrounded the valley. The meaning of the word Tlaltenango in the Caxcan language (land surrounded by walls) alludes to the mountainous landscape of the valley. Between these walls, the Sierra del Mixt√≥n to the east and the Sierra de Tepeque to the west, transited Nu√±o Beltr√°n de Guzm√°n and his soldiers, leaving, according to the historian Peter Gerhard, ‚Äúa path of corpses and destroyed houses and crops, impressing surviving males into service and leaving women and children to starve.‚Äù Frame 56 of the Lienzo de Tlaxcala describes a battle in which the Caxcans of ‚ÄúTlaltenapa‚Äù defended their lands against the Spanish and their Tlaxcaltec allies. The memories of this first encounter with the Spanish must have tormented the inhabitants of Tlaltenango and its surrounding area. So great was the anguish that in 1531, from the mountains near El Te√∫l, they launched an attack against the Spanish who were attempting to build a town named the Town of the Holy Spirit of Guadalajara near what is now Nochistl√°n. The Town of Guadalajara was left in ruins and the Spanish had to make another three attempts before the town finally survived in its present location (the Atemajac Valley) where it was built in 1542. In 1541, the Caxcans took up arms against the Spanish once again, with their Tepehuan, Zacatec and Guachichil allies. From the Sierra del Mixt√≥n, which is today known as Sierra de Morones, the indigenous allies of the region attacked the Spanish. The Mixt√≥n War lasted less than two years, but peace was not long-lived. In 1550, the seeds of war sprouted once again with the great Chichimeca War, a war fought by a great number of Chichimec ethnic groups (Chichimec was a pejorative term used by civilized ethnic groups of the south to describe the nomadic ethnic groups of the north). This war lasted almost forty years. While it seems that the residents of the Valley of Tlaltenango did not participate in this rebellion, the region suffered the consequences of war nevertheless due to the chaos all around it. For having submitted to the Spanish Crown, The Caxcan towns of the area around Tlaltenango suffered attacks from the north launched by their former allies, the Zacatecs. The war only came to an end when the Viceroy Lu√≠s de Velasco decided to purchase peace with the Chichimecs. As part of the peace offering, the Viceroy used the power of the Royal Treasury to dissitribute clothing, tools and food to the Chichimecs in return for their pacification and recognition of the Spanish Crown. In addition, he recruited hundreds of Tlaxcaltec families to move and live among the Chichimecs so as to convert them to the Catholic faith and to a sedentary lifestyle by teaching them agricultural methods. Needless to say, at the end of the 16th century there were very few Spaniards that lived in the vicinity of Tlaltenango. In the decade of 1540, probably after the Mixt√≥n War, the towns of the valley were entrusted as encomiendas to a number of Spaniards. The town of Tlaltenango was entrusted to Toribio de Bola√±os, Tepechitl√°n to Pedro de Bobadilla, a soldier of Nu√±o Beltr√°n de Guzm√°n, and El Te√∫l was an encomineda of Juan Delgado. It is unlikely that these individuals were able to exercise their rights over the indigenous populations during the 16th century, given that the successive rebellions would have made it difficult. However, with the end of war, Spaniards began arriving and settling among the newly pacified indigenous inhabitants of the region. In 1550, the town of Tlaltenango had 132 houses, in which lived 626 persons. By 1561, the tributary population (adult males) reached 379. In 1570, the tributary population had reached 1,000 individuals and there were 20 Spaniards living in the town of Tlaltenango. The valley had more than 8,000 inhabitants. Such a rapid increase in population indicates a great inflow of migrants into the region during that time. Three years later, most certainly due to disease and war, the population of the town had decreased to only 380 tributaries. By 1584, the population had still not recovered, as there were just over 3,000 inhabitants, nearly all indigenous. These inhabitants were nourished by the corn, chile and beans that they would sow in their farms along the Tlaltenango River, by peaches, quinces, figs and cactus pears that grew in the valley and by chickens and turkeys that they raised. By 1616, the number of Spaniards in the Valley was high enough for the indigenous inhabitants to complain about the damages caused to their farms by the steer and horses of the Spaniards. Racial mixing between the Spanish and Amerindians of the region existed in those early years. The documented complaints of the indigenous inhabitants include the extramarital affairs of Diego Gonz√°lez and Diego L√≥pez, both Spaniards, with Indian women and those of Juan de Miramontes, also a Spaniard, with a mestizo woman who was the wife of a Tlaxcaltec. We also know that the Bobadilla, trustees of Tepechitl√°n, were mestizos, since the first trustee, Pedro de Bobadilla married and had offspring with an indigenous woman. The local indigenous population was the main supply of labor for the salt mines in Santa Maria y El Pe√±ol Blanco in the early 17th century. The town and its surrounding wooded mountains were also key suppliers of wood fiber used for construction of the frontier towns of Jerez and Colotl√°n. The jurisdiction of Tlaltenango included at least three sawmill and charcoal plants in the 17th century. On July 18, 2008 there was a massive flash flood, killing 3, and affecting 15,000 of the town's people.

The town is surrounded by several areas of the Kiskuns√°g National Park. The mayor is Ferencz Lehoczki. Croats in Hungary call this town Vakier ≈Ωivko Mandiƒá: Hrvatska imena naseljenih mjesta u Mad≈æarskoj, (compare older Hungarian name, Vadkert). History The town has been called Soltvadkert since 1900. Before that, it was called Vadkert, which is a reference to the region's active wildlife in Hungary. It was founded in 1376. While Hungary was occupied by the Turkish army, Soltvadkert lost much of its population. In the beginning of the 1740s, Baron Orczy moved German settlers to Soltvadkert. The town has quickly developed its main center of tourism in the county. Lake Vadkert (also called B√ºd√∂s-t√≥), is nearby Soltvadkert. It attracts many tourists every year from all over Europe. Soltvadkert is well known throughout Europe for its wine production which goes back centuries in history. Its multicultural past, present, and future mainly depends on the grape and wine industry. Geography and environment Soltvadkert is located at 46¬∞34'41\\" North, 19¬∞23'45\\" East. The village of Selymes located south of the town towards Kiskunhalas is administratively part of Soltvadkert. =Climate= Soltvadkert is known nationally for its long and warm summers. Demographics As the census of 2001 the people of Soltvadkert identified themselves as: * Hungarian - 98.0% * Romani - 0.7% * Mixed/Other - 1.3% Economy Soltvadkert is the center of one of the biggest wine regions in Hungary. There are grapes on over 8,000 ha in the area. Soltvadkert is home to a variety of grapes. The town annually produces about 250-300 thousand hl of wine . Education Soltvadkert is home to the Lajos Kossuth Elementary and Middle School (in Hungarian: Kossuth Lajos √Åltal√°nos √©s M≈±v√©szeti Alapiskola), but does not have any high schools. Religion Soltvadkert belongs to those rare Hungarian towns that have a Lutheran church in the center. This is due to the high number of German immigrants in the 18th century who built the church. Freedom of religion was, however, forbidden, and the Roman Catholic archbishop and his servants of Kalocsa have many times destroyed the church. A new Lutheran church was built in 1837, which is still in a very good shape. During the centuries, schools and other church-oriented buildings were constructed around it. The church currently has three bells in use. Inside the church there is a historical Rieger organ, which was installed in 1908. On the side of the church wall is a German sign which states: \\"Dies ist der Denckstein der evangelica Kirche in Vadkert\\" (This is the cornerstone of the Lutheran church of Vadkert). After 40 years of persecution, the Lutheran community is still active in Soltvadkert. The Roman Catholic Church has been represented in Soltvadkert since 1737. It is currently the biggest Christian denomination in town by population. The first church was built in the 18th century for Baron L≈ërinc Orczy. Since 1908, a larger church has also been in use. In 1722, seven Calvinist families moved to Vadkert from Germany. Others followed them in the 1740s. After years of religious persecution, they were finally allowed to build a church, which was finished at noon on September 26, 1794. The Baptist mission started in 1891 in Soltvadkert. As of the year 2000, there are over two hundred followers of the church. The history of the Pentecostal church in Soltvadkert goes back to 1935. The Pentecostal movement, which started in 1900 in the United States, reached Soltvadkert after World War I. Soltvadkert was home to a thriving Jewish community before World War II. Almost all Soltvadkert Jews were murdered during The Holocaust; the surviving few emigrated to Budapest or left the country.

It played a decisive role in the 1992‚Äì1993 war between Abkhazia and Georgia, rallying militants from the North Caucasian republics. Its forces have been accused by Georgia of committing war crimes, including the ethnic cleansing of Georgians. The Confederation has been inactive since the assassination of its second leader Yusup Soslanbekov in 2000. Creation On the initiative of the Abkhaz ethno-nationalist movement Aidgylara, the Assembly of the Mountain Peoples of the Caucasus was established in Abkhazia's capital Sukhumi on 25 and 26 August 1989. On 13 and 14 October 1990, the Assembly held its second congress in Nalchik, where it was transformed into the so-called Mountain Republic. On 4 November 1990, in Nalchik, its membership was expended, and it was renamed Confederation of Mountain Peoples of the Caucasus. 16 nations of the Caucasus joined the Confederation. The Assembly elected the president (Musa Shanibov) and 16 vice-presidents. Yusup Soslanbekov was the chairman of the Caucasian Parliament and Sultan Sosnaliyev was appointed the head of the Confederation's military department. War in Abkhazia Following the outbreak of war as Georgian troops entered Abkhazia in August 1992, the Confederation held its 11th parliamentary session in Grozny. A clear purpose of the establishment of this organization became obvious after this Session. The Confederation created assault detachments of volunteers with that were later deployed in Abkhazia during the war. The confederation raised about 1,500 volunteers, half of them reportedly from Chechnya. It has also been reported that notorious Chechen warlord Shamil Basayev became commander of CMPC forces in 1992. The president of the Confederation Musa Shanibov and the chairman of the parliament Iysuph Soslanbekov made an official statement: > \\"As there is no other way to withdraw Georgian occupants' army from the > territory of the sovereign Abkhazia and in order to implement the resolution > of the 10th Session of the CMPC, we order:Chervonnaya Svetlana, Conflict in > the Caucasus: Georgia, Abkhazia and the Russian Shadow, p. 131 # All > headquarters of the Confederation have to dispatch volunteers to the > territory of Abkhazia to crash the aggressor militarily. # All military > formations of the Confederation have to conduct military actions against any > forces who oppose them and try to reach the territory of Abkhazia by any > method. # To announce Tbilisi as a zone of disaster. At that use all > methods, including terrorist acts. # To declare all people of Georgian > ethnicity on the territory of Confederation as hostages. # All type of > cargoes directed to Georgia shall be detained.\\" The Central Headquarters of the Confederation led by Yusup Soslanbekov had been in charged to implement practical measures against the \\"enemies of Abkhazian people\\". CMPC forces took place in the storming operation of Gagra where hundreds of civilians were killed. On October 3, Abkhazian and Confederate formations launched a full-scale attack on villages of Kamani and Shroma (near Gumista River) that was repelled by Georgian forces. =Sukhumi Massacre= On September 27, 1993 the Abkhaz side violated the UN-mediated cease-fire agreement (Georgian side had agreed to pull out all heavy artillery and tanks from Sukhumi in return for cease-fire) by storming defenceless Sukhumi. The Confederates moved into Sukhumi and started to sweep through streets of the city. As the city was engulfed by heavy fighting, civilians took refuge in abandoned houses and apartment buildings. Some of the civilians of Georgian ethnicity were massacred after their discovery by the Confederates. By late afternoon the remainder of Georgian troops surrendered to the Abkhaz side. The majority of Georgian POWs were executed on the same day by Abkhaz formations and Confederates. Few civilians and military personnel managed to survive the massacre. The massacre continued for two weeks after the fall of Sukhumi (See Ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Abkhazia).Human Rights Watch report GEORGIA/ABKHAZIA: VIOLATIONS OF THE LAWS OF WAR AND RUSSIA'S ROLE IN THE CONFLICT, March 1995.Chervonnaia, Svetlana Mikhailovna.

It experienced a brief revival in December 1994, when Shanibov rallied thousands across the North Caucasus to block roads to the Russian forces heading to Grozny. However, the change of power in Shanibov‚Äôs home republic, Kabardino-Balkaria, in favor of strongly pro-Moscow leader, prevented him from exerting any political influence in the region, forcing him to retire from politics in 1996. Since then, the organization has had no role in the Caucasus affairs.

It was widely used especially in Central European countries. Diamond vaults are concave-convex ceilings so complex that, as their name suggests, they invoke the facets of a cut gemstone. First appearing in 1471 at Albrechtsburg castle in Meissen, Germany, they were employed for almost a century in locations as far apart as Gdansk on the Baltic to Bechyne in Southern Bohemia (today's Czech Republic). From the historical point of view, diamond vaults show the continuing vitality of the Gothic architecture in Central Europe, at a time when the rediscovery of the classical past in Renaissance Italy was changing the course of building. Architecturally, they offer some of the most impressive examples of geometrical experimentation and versatility in both secular and sacred spaces. The design of diamond vaults involved an understanding of how the whole interior is shaped through a correlation of its geometry, spatial composition and support system. The vaults have the ability visually to integrate or to compartmentalise interiors, to make them appear to expand through seamless recession or to diminish them by the presence of claustrophobic, heavily projecting ridges. They can add an element of playful irregularity to symmetrical spaces, or conversely can harmonise oddly shaped interiors. Their plasticity is enhanced by the contrasting play of light and dark across their surfaces. Diamond vaults are among the most original, yet least-known, creations of the Medieval architecture.

Members of HMBANA follow the annually revised \\"Guidelines for the Establishment and Operation of a Donor Human Milk Bank\\" which include protocols for soliciting donors and collecting, processing, and distributing the milk. In addition, some states have required standards for donor human milk banks. However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), states that \\"the FDA has not been involved in establishing these voluntary guidelines or state standards.\\" https://www.fda.gov/science-research/pediatrics/use-donor-human-milk Some of these protocols are described below. According to a joint statement by the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF): \\"The best food for a baby who cannot be breastfed is milk expressed from the mother's breast or from another healthy mother. The best food for any baby whose own mother's milk is not available is the breastmilk of another healthy mother\\" (UNICEF, p. 48). \\"Where it is not possible for the biological mother to breast feed, the first alternative, if available, should be the use of human milk from other sources. Human milk banks should be made available in appropriate situations\\" (Wight, 2001). History A 1930s breast pump in action on a hospital patient The Canadian Nurse described in 1939 how nurses at the Royal Victoria Montreal Maternity Hospital travelled to Boston to learn from the successful programme at the Directory for Mother's Milk, Inc., set up by Dr Fritz Talbot. It was \\"a miniature dairy with all modern appliances\\". The quick freezing of fractions of an ounce of breastmilk had been perfected earlier that decade by researchers at Borden Labs. The women recruited were paid by the ounce, and visited daily by a nurse, as most would not have had refrigeration at home. The Maternity Hospital kept a stock of about 1000 frozen ounces. Screening donors Milk donors are new mothers who are in good health, whose infants are growing, thriving, and under six months old when they begin (Arnold, 1997). Some milk banks accept milk from mothers whose baby is up to a year old. Women who have given their baby up for adoption, acted as a surrogate, or are a bereaved mother may also donate. Because there is some risk of passing infections and viruses to babies through breast milk, donors must undergo a medical screening and a blood test to rule out infectious diseases such as HIV-1 and-2, hepatitis B and C and syphilis (Arnold, 1997). After administering a verbal or written questionnaire, healthcare providers for the mother and her baby must sign statements confirming that both are in good health. The mother must not smoke or regularly use any medications, herbs, or megavitamins. If she or her baby has a common cold, she should not express milk for donation until they have recovered. If she consumes alcohol, she must wait out an \\"exclusion period\\" of twelve hours before expressing milk for donation. For a premature or medically fragile recipient baby, even a tiny amount of alcohol, medications, or herbs in the milk may be problematic. Collection Methods of collection and types of containers used vary among milk banks. Donors are educated about hygienic milk expression and given containers in which to express their milk. Some milk banks have collection points where couriers pick up donations, some have mothers deliver the milk to the facility, and others ask women who live far away to freeze and ship their milk to the milk bank. Screening and processing milk In addition to careful screening of donors, each batch of milk is tested for bacterial counts before pasteurization. Some milk banks pool milk before testing it, others test each mother's milk as it comes in before it is pooled. Milk banks require freezers and pasteurizers for processing milk. Most milk banks have two freezers, for unprocessed and processed milk. The HMBANA guidelines state that \\"all milk should be heat treated for 30 minutes at 62.5 ¬∞C. Heat treatment of milk occurs at 62.5¬∞C for 30 minutes (Holder pasteurizing)\\" (Arnold, 1997, p. 243). At the end of pasteurization, another sample of milk is tested to make sure the treatment was effective. Colony counts should be zero and no bacterial growth should be detected (Arnold, 1997). Containers for pasteurizing must be able to withstand heating and cooling without breakage or leaking. Most containers are recyclable, usually glass or plastic. Distribution Donor milk is dispensed by prescription from the recipient's physician. Often, it is used within the hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) for premature or critically ill babies. Sometimes, however, donor milk is shipped to recipients' homes. In these cases, it is frozen, packed in special containers, and shipped over night. Breast milk content of mothers of premature babies differs from that of mothers of full term babies (Wight, 2001). Therefore, most milk banks separate \\"preemie milk\\" - milk collected in the first 30 days after delivery of an infant less than 36 weeks gestation - from \\"term milk.\\" Costs The HMBANA Guidelines stipulate that donors not be paid for their milk. However, hospitals and recipients are required to cover some of the cost for collection, processing and distribution of milk which may be from $3.00 to $5.00 an ounce. This remains a much lower cost than pasteurized milk can be obtained otherwise. Community fundraising and grants also help milk banks meet expenses. The guidelines ensure that no one is denied donor milk for lack of ability to pay. For non-hospitalized recipients, the milk bank will often work with the family to obtain coverage for processing fees (Arnold, 1997). However, insurance companies rarely cover donor milk, except under unusual circumstances (Griffith, 2002). In some states, and under some circumstances, Medicaid and WIC will cover the costs of using banked milk (Arnold, 1999, Wight, 2001). When hospitals order banked milk for their NICUs it is often brought into the pharmacy and billed through the hospital. In these cases, insurance companies are much more likely to cover the processing fees than for outpatients (Arnold, 1997). Donors Communities with milk banks use different methods to educate and solicit donors including brochures in doctors' offices and hospital information packets. Referrals also come from childbirth educators, nursing mothers groups, and La Leche League. Like blood banks, milk banks sometimes use newspaper, television and radio ads to solicit donors, especially when supplies are low (Arnold, 1997). NICUs with successful breastfeeding promotion and support often have mothers with excess milk, and they are frequently given information about how to donate their milk. In addition, mothers of infants who die sometimes choose to donate their milk. Currently, many of the milk banks will receive milk from donors in states throughout the United States depending on their supply. Donors should always contact the closest milk bank first. Recipients Premature infants are the most frequent recipients of donor breast milk. Full term babies with gastrointestinal (GI) disorders also sometimes receive banked milk. Occasionally, adopted babies and mothers who cannot nurse their healthy babies use banked milk as well, often at their own expense. When there is milk available some milk banks will distribute it to adults who are immuno- compromised. Preliminary research indicates that breast milk can have nutritive, immunologic and palliative effects for cancer patients (Radetsky, 1999). Adults with GI disorders and organ donation recipients can also benefit from the immunologic powers of breast milk. More research is needed in these areas. Risks and mitigation Two concerns are often raised by potential donor milk recipients and health care providers regarding potential risks of using banked human milk: # Viruses, including HIV, have been shown to transmit through breast milk. However, as mentioned above, breast milk donors are screened very carefully. In addition, each batch of milk is screened and pasteurized and retested for the presence of bacteria. \\"There have been no documented cases of disease transmission from donor milk provided by a milk bank operating under standard practice.\\" (Arnold, 1999, p. 3) All of the milk banks listed below abide by the Guidelines of HMBANA. Potential donors are excluded from donating under the following circumstances: #*Receipt of a blood product or blood transfusion, or a tissue or organ transplant within the last 12 months. #*Regular use of more than 2 ounces of hard liquor or its equivalent in a 24-hour period. #*Regular use of over-the-counter drugs or systemic prescriptions (replacement hormones and some birth control hormones are acceptable). #*Use of mega-dose vitamins and/or pharmacologically active herbal preparations. #*Total vegetarians (vegans) who do not supplement their diet with vitamins. #*Use of illegal drugs or tobacco products. #*Silicone breast implants #*A history of hepatitis, systemic disorders of any kind or chronic infections (e.g. HIV, HTLV, TB) (Arnold, 1999) # Some of the worthwhile components of breast milk are compromised in the pasteurization process. However, many are not. \\"Donor milk retains its bioactivity despite partial or complete loss of some components\\" (Arnold, 1999, p. 3). The enzymes in breast milk (e.g. lipase) appear to be most affected by the heat. However, immune factors are less sensitive to heat and growth factors and fatty acids are stable at pasteurization temperatures. The lower the temperature at which safe processing can take place the better (Arnold, 1999). HMBANA Guidelines reflect careful research in this area. Milk banks Below is a list of states/provinces that have HMBANA member milk banks in North America: *Alberta (NorthernStar Mothers Milk Bank, Calgary) *Alabama (Mothers' Milk Bank of Alabama, Birmingham, Alabama) *British Columbia (BC Women's Provincial Milk Bank, Vancouver) *California (*Mothers' Milk Bank, San Jose) *Colorado (Mothers' Milk Bank at Presbyterian/St. Luke's Medical Center, Denver) *Florida (Mothers' Milk Bank of Florida, Orlando, Florida) *Illinois (Mothers' Milk Bank of the Great Western Lakes, Elk Grove Village, Illinois) *Indiana (The Milk Bank, Indianapolis) *Iowa (Mothers' Milk Bank of Iowa, Iowa City) *Louisiana Ochsner Baptist New Orleans *Massachusetts (Mothers' Milk Bank Northeast, Newton Upper Falls) *Michigan (Bronson Mothers' Milk Bank, Kalamazoo) *Mississippi (Mothers' Milk Bank of Mississippi, Flowood, Mississippi) * Missouri (Heart of America Mothers' Milk Bank, Kansas City) * Montana (Mothers' Milk Bank of Montana, Missoula) *North Carolina (WakeMed Mothers' Milk Bank and Lactation Center, Raleigh) *Ohio (OhioHealth Mothers' Milk Bank, Columbus) * Oklahoma (Oklahoma Mothers' Milk Bank, Oklahoma City) * Ontario (Rogers Hixon Ontario Human Milk Bank, Toronto) * Oregon (Northwest Mothers' Milk Bank, Portland, Oregon) * Pennsylvania (CHOP Mothers' Milk Bank, Philadelphia; Three Rivers Mothers' Milk Bank, Pittsburgh) * South Carolina (Mothers' Milk Bank of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina) *Texas (Mothers' Milk Bank at Austin, Austin; Mothers' Milk Bank of North Texas, Fort Worth) *Virginia (The King's Daughters Milk Bank, Norfolk, Virginia) Besides the individual milk banks in the above states/provinces, HMBANA has sent donor milk to hospitals in 39 states and 3 provinces. Milk banking alternatives Private milk donation is an alternative arrangement to milk donation through the Human Milk Banking Association of North America. Private donation is a less formal method of donation that involves direct connection between mothers donating milk and the families receiving donations. Many families engaging in private milk donation, include blood testing and complete donor screening while involving a supportive care provider. This is a modern continuation of the ancient concept of the wet nurse.

In 1883, Friedrich Dahl observed that they were deflected by the sound waves from a violin and labelled them 'hearing hairs'. Morphology Unlike the ordinary setae, which are tapered, the trichobothria have the same gauge throughout their length. They fit into the bottom of a broad and deep cup to which connects a membrane with extreme flexibility which adds an extraordinary mobility to them. The least air vibration is able to get them moving and to excite the small group of sensory cells which ensures their innervation. Distribution Trichobothria are present in most orders of the Arachnida, except in Solifugae, Ricinulei and Opiliones (Grass√©, 1949). Although the distribution of trichobothria on the bodies of arachnids is often used by systematists (especially in Scorpiones and Pseudoscorpiones), few interordinal patterns are apparent (Shultz, 1990).

Its length is 10-15 centimeters or (4-8 inches) though the largest known specimen is 7.6 cm (3 in). It gets its name from its circular mouth, filled with small teeth: the name ‚Äúcyclothone‚Äù means in a circle or around and ‚Äúmicrodon‚Äù means small teeth. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the veiled anglemouth is of Least Concern due to its abundance in most oceans and the little effect human impact has on its population growth. Some of the veiled anglemouth's physical features include a brown to black body with a radiating, or expansive, bioluminescent pigment over its head and fins. Distribution and Habitat The veiled Anglemouth is found to be more abundant at higher latitudes, typically 60-50 degrees North. The range of the veiled anglemouth includes anywhere from the Atlantic, Mediterranean and Pacific oceans and even extends to the Black Sea. It is a deep-sea fish found at a maximum depth of 5,300 m, though it typically spends its time in depths of 3,000 - 4,000 m. It is still unknown whether the veiled Anglemouth migrates, studies have shown that migration, if present, will not significantly affect population densities. Population Veiled anglemouth catches are typically composed of adult females, implying that younger anglemouths mature elsewhere or that the fish breeds seasonally in such a way that all the younger fish grew into adulthood by the time catches took place. Studies have shown, however, that breeding is not done on an entirely seasonal basis, which puts the temporal displacement of younger individuals into question. Due to few environmental factors, the veiled anglemouth's population trends are very stable. In fact, some estimates place c. microdon as one of the most abundant fish in the deep Atlantic accounting up to 80% of the fish individuals. The high prevalence of females during veiled anglemouth catches is likely due to the animal's ability to change sex. It is believed sex reversal typically occurs when the fish reaches 22 ‚Äì 24 mm (0.86 ‚Äì 0.94 in) in length. Human Uses The veiled anglemouth has no direct use for human consumption. However, it is believed to be a source of food for many commercial fish. Physical Characteristics The veiled anglemouth is sometimes referred to as the small-eyed lanternfish because of its ability to bioluminesce, typically near its belly and around the eyes. The veiled anglemouths also possess the ability to change their sex. As noted above, most catches are typically female. Studies have shown that female density of veiled anglemouth populations are the determining factor whether males will make the switch into a female once they reach a certain length. This sex exchange is irreversible, so once a male becomes female it can never return to being male. Diet The veiled anglemouth is believed to feed on copepods and other tiny crustaceans that are available to it. Another known prey item of veiled anglemouths are ostracods.

Members were companies that specialized in, or had departments that specialized in, market research, consumer opinion and related marketing intelligence. Individuals who were marketing research practitioners could also become members. Located in Washington D.C. the Marketing Research Association was founded in 1957. The MRA's chief product was membership. It was also active in advocating industry positions on legislative and regulatory issues. In January, 2017, the Marketing Research Association merged with CASRO to form the Insights Association. Membership Membership principally included access to a common code of conduct and set of best practices; industry-related news briefs and publications, including its trade-oriented magazine, Alert; invitation to MRA's annual conference and to meetings of its regional chapters; access to market research videos, online training seminars, papers and directories; access to professional certification; legislative updates; governmental advocacy; and access to an online jobs board. Annual membership dues are dependent on the applicant's company size and relationship to the marketing research industry. Some membership-only products are sold separately (i.e., not included in the annual membership fee). The organization said it has approximately 3,000 members. Conferences MRA held three annual conferences, the Corporate Researchers Conference CRC St. Louis, The Insights & Strategies Conference ISC San Diego and The CEO Summit Napa Valley. Governmental Affairs MRA's Governmental Affairs section monitored statutory and legislative issues that affected market researchers, such as consumer data privacy legislation and court rulings in each of the 50 United States and in other countries, including social media legislation, legal issues pertaining to consumer privacy for medical care and prescriptions (such as HIPAA-related rulings), anti-spam legislation, telephone surveys, political polling, and similar issues. On topics such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) of 1991, the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) and Department of Commerce's support of rules restricting access to consumer data, and various Congressional consumer privacy acts, the MRA publicly advocated (i.e., lobbies legislators and other governmental officials to adopt) positions that support the organization's goals. Opposition to these positions generally cames from consumer rights organizations and their lobbyists. Professional Education The University of Georgia's online course, \\"Principles of Marketing Research,\\" is based on an MRA-developed curriculum entitled \\"Market Research Core Body of Knowledge.\\" Scholarships for this course were provided annually by the MRA to one or more qualifying applicants. The Marketing Research Association also offered a Professional Researcher Certificate (PRC) administered through the organization's website. Both of these programs were open to members at additional cost. Board of directors The MRA Board of Directors included Jill Donahue, Chairman of the Board; Debby Schlesinger-Hellman, PRC, Immediate Past Chairman; Ted Donnelly, Ph.D., PRC, Vice Chair, Vaughn Mordecai, PRC, Treasurer; Dan Womack, PRC, Secretary; and David W. Almy, Chief Executive Officer. The Board also included six Directors at Large: Scott Baker, PRC, Janet Baldi, Jim Bryson, Jerry Haselmayer, Jeffrey Henning, PRC and Elizabeth Merrick.

She was named after the Sendai River in southern Ky≈´sh≈´. Sendai was the lead ship of the three vessels completed in her class of light cruisers, and like other vessels of her class, she was intended for use as the flagship of a destroyer flotilla. Service career =Early career= Sendai was completed at the Mitsubishi Nagasaki shipyards on 29 April 1924. Immediately on completion, she was assigned to Yangtze River patrol in China. She played an important role in the Battle of Shanghai in the opening stages of the Second Sino-Japanese War, and later covered the landings of Japanese forces in southern China. =Invasions of Southeast Asia= On 20 November 1941, Sendai became flagship of Destroyer Squadron 3 (DesRon 3) under Rear Admiral Shintaro Hashimoto. At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Sendai was engaged in escorting transports carrying Lieutenant General Tomoyuki Yamashita and the Japanese 25th Army to invade Malaya. At 23:45 on 7 December 1941, Sendai and her destroyer squadron (, , , and ) commenced a bombardment of Kota Bharu, Malaya. They were attacked by seven RAAF Hudson bombers, which sank one of the transports and damaged two others. On 9 December 1941, the submarine reported sighting of Royal Navy Force Z (the Royal Navy battleship , battlecruiser and supporting destroyers). The report was received by Sendai, which relayed the message to Vice Admiral Jisabur≈ç Ozawa aboard his flagship, the heavy cruiser . However, the reception was poor and the message took another 90 minutes to decode. Moreover, I-65s report was incorrect about the heading of Force Z. The following day, Force Z was overwhelmed by torpedo bombers of the 22nd Air Flotilla from Indochina. On 19 December 1941, off Kota Bahru in the South China Sea, Royal Netherlands Navy submarine sighted Sendai escorting the second Malaya Convoy's 39 transports. At 11:15, Sendais floatplane, a Kawanishi E7K2 \\"Alf\\", spotted and bombed O 20, which was also attacked by the destroyers Ayanami and with depth charges. That night, O 20 surfaced to recharge her batteries, and a flame from her engines' exhaust gave her away; she was sunk by Uranami. Sendai made three more troop convoy escort runs to Malay at the end of December 1941 and in January 1942. On the fourth run, on 10 January 1942, the US submarine spotted the convoy and fired two torpedoes at the last transport, but both missed. On the fifth run, on 26 January, Sendai and her convoy were attacked by the destroyers and about north of Singapore in the Battle off Endau. The torpedoes from the Allied vessels missed, and the destroyer and Sendai returned gunfire. Thanet was sunk, while Vampire was undamaged and escaped to Singapore. From February through March, Sendai was assigned to cover Japanese landings in Sumatra, and in sweeping the sea lanes and the Strait of Malacca for British and Dutch vessels escaping from Singapore. At the end of March, Sendai covered the landing of one battalion of the IJA's 18th Infantry Division at Port Blair, Andaman Islands. At the end of April, Sendai returned to Sasebo for repairs. =Battle of Midway= On 29 May 1942, Sendai departed with the Main Body of the Combined Fleet for Midway. The Main Body remained behind Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo's First Carrier Striking Force and thus did not engage American forces. Sendai returned to Kure on 14 June 1942 without having seen combat. =Solomon Islands campaigns= On 15 July 1942, DesRon 3 was reassigned to the Southwest Force to cover operations in Burma and raids in the Indian Ocean, arriving at Mergui, Burma 31 July. However, with American landings on Guadalcanal, the planned Indian Ocean operations were cancelled and Sendai was sent to Makassar, Davao and Truk instead, to escort troop convoys to Rabaul, New Britain and Shortland, Bougainville. On 8 September, Sendai shelled Tulagi, and on 12 September she and the destroyers Shikinami, and bombarded Henderson Field, Guadalcanal. Sendai remained active in Solomon Island operations through November 1942, participating in both the First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal (where she remained as distant cover) and the Second Naval Battle of Guadalcanal (where she was attacked by the battleship 's main guns but escaped undamaged). On 25 February 1943, Sendai was reassigned to the Eighth Fleet at Rabaul under Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa and remained on patrol around Rabaul through April. Returning to Sasebo in May, Sendai was repaired and modified. Her No.5 gun mount was removed and two triple 25 mm AA gun mounts and Type 21 radar were installed. Repairs were completed 25 June 1943 and Sendai returned to Truk on 5 July. On 7 July, Rear Admiral Baron Matsuji Ijuin assumed command of DesRon 3. During the next three months, Sendai operated out of Rabaul covering reinforcement convoys to Buin, Papua New Guinea and Shortland. On 18 July 1943, off Kolombangara, the group was attacked by Guadalcanal-based Marine Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers, and two days later by North American B-25 Mitchell medium bombers but was not damaged; it also escaped damage after being bombed by a Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bomber on 1 November 1943. The following day, 2 November 1943, at the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay, the Japanese fleet attempting to reinforce Bougainville was intercepted by Task Force 39 with the light cruisers , , and and destroyers , , , , , , and . The Japanese force included the cruisers , , Sendai and with destroyers , , , , , . Shigure spotted the American destroyers at , turned hard starboard and launched eight torpedoes. Sendai also turned hard starboard, but bore down on Shigure, barely avoiding a collision. All four Allied cruisers took Sendai under radar directed 6-inch fire. They hit her with their first salvo and more thereafter, setting her afire. Sendai sank the following morning at , along with Hatsukaze. Captain Shoji and 184 crewmen went down with the ship, but 236 other crewmen were rescued by destroyers. On 3 November 1943, Admiral Ijuin and 75 more survivors from Sendai were rescued by the Japanese submarine . Sendai was removed from the Navy List on 5 January 1944.

Davis Chair in Constitutional Law, director for The Center for Children, Law, and Ethics, former director of the Center for Biotechnology, Law, and Ethics, and faculty advisor for the Law, Science and Technology Society. Smolin deals with international adoption scandals (see child laundering) and is the creator of an informational website on international adoption called Adopting Internationally. He has been interviewed and submitted content on the subject to National Public Radio,Adoption Stories Gone Bad ABC News, Al Jazeera,http://english.aljazeera.net/programmes/peopleandpower/2009/06/20096249112454512.html Al Jazeera interview begins at 15:27 The New York Times, The Salt Lake Tribune,http://www.sltrib.com/ci_11700836 The Salt Lake Tribune, Adoption scandal has prompted only minor changes, 2-14-09 CBC Radio,CBC radio broadcast: Celebrity Adoption The Podcast for Tuesday June 16, 2009 and Radio Netherlandshttp://static.rnw.nl/migratie/www.radionetherlands.nl/features/amsterdamforum/070708af- redirected For export only?http://static.rnw.nl/migratie/www.radionetherlands.nl/thestatewerein/otherstates/tswi070621smolin- redirected Stolen Children and others.http://will.illinois.edu/focus580/interview/focus081217b Focus 580 with David Inge Illinois Public Media Dec. 17, 2008 He recently presented on adoption issues at the Korean Women's Development Institute in Seoul, Korea; the Second International Symposium on Korean Adoption Studies in Seoul, Korea; and (as an independent expert) at the Hague Special Commission on the Practical Operation of the Hague Adoption Convention. His law review article, Child Laundering, written in 2005, won Cumberland's inaugural Lightfoot, Franklin and White Faculty Scholarship Award for the most significant scholarly work published during the preceding year,http://cumberland.samford.edu/cumberlandblank.asp?ID=931 Cumberland dean's news and is consistently listed in the 10 Most Popular Articles in the bepress Legal Series. His own family's international adoption, discovery that their children were stolen, and ultimately successful, though arduous, six year search for the girls' original birth family in India was featured on NPR's Morning Edition titled Adoption Stories Gone Bad, and by ABC News. Career Smolin graduated first in his class and Order of the Coif from the University of Cincinnati College of Law. He is an internationally recognized expert in the field of intercountry adoption, and a nationally recognized expert in Bioethics and Biotechnology; Reproductive Constitutional law; Family and Juvenile law; and Law and Religion. He has testified before legislative committees in the U.S. Congress, as well as five states on constitutional issues. Smolin joined the Cumberland faculty in 1987 after clerking for Senior Judge George Edwards of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit from 1986-1987. Prior to that Smolin worked in a psychiatric hospital. He has also served as an adjunct professor at the interdenominational Beeson Divinity School. Smolin is the author of over 35 articles, primarily published as law review articles, though some of his works have appeared in journals such as First Things. =Intercountry adoption= Much of Smolin's recent academic work regards international adoption, child trafficking and child laundering. Two articles gaining attention are available for download at bepress legal repository. Al Jazeera interview - Stolen Babies - People and Power segment On June 24, 2009 Smolin appeared in an interview with Al Jazeera on the subject of stolen babies from Guatemala, (see Human trafficking; Child laundering) after both the US Department of Justice and the Bureau of Consular Affairs at the US State Department declined to be interviewed and declined to comment on the subject. Smolin referred to his own situation involving his stolen adopted daughters and said that there is no easy solution to child laundering because it is usually successful and is too often the perfect crime. He went on to say that the Office of Children's Issues at the State Department should immediately facilitate DNA testing of the children and mothers who claim their children were stolen. He said adoptive parents should attempt to acquire DNA testing of their adoptive children so that they can form partnerships with the birth family. Celebrity adoptions and the subsidiarity principle Smolin has said that celebrity adoptions highlight the problems with intercountry adoption. While not being expressly opposed to celebrity adoption or international adoption, Smolin believes in the need for an implementation of the subsidiarity principle as it relates to international adoption because the huge amount of money channelled into adopting a child pales in comparison to the relatively small amount of money that could, in many circumstances, be used to reunite broken families and improve conditions within the child's culture and country of origin.http://www.cbc.ca/podcasting/pastpodcasts.html?42#ref42 He states the need to: > Reform international adoption by putting a priority on keeping children in > their original family and within their community. Smolin also believes that without a safe adoption system, comparatively wealthy families seeking to adopt children from impoverished nations are in a position to exploit that poverty, and where $20‚Äì30,000 may be spent to adopt a child, several hundred dollars may be all that is needed to reunite a child with that child's family and substantially improve conditions within the child's community. In general he believes that one major problem with international adoption is that the adoptions system is corrupted by far too much money and that there are no real consequences for violating adoption regulations. =Debate with Jane Aronson= On June 16, 2009 Smolin debated Jane Aronson on the topic of celebrity adoptions for CBC Radio. Both showed appreciation for one another with Smolin stating he admired Aronson's work in helping orphanages and improving international communities which are the sources for adoptive children, and Aronson stating \\"I'm glad to be on the program with you David because you're a smart and warm human being.\\" Aronson stated the issue is poverty and that there is no social services network to provide for the families. Smolin's views are, in part, stated above. Cumberland School of Law Symposium on International Adoption On April 15, 2005 Smolin, with the cooperation of Cumberland School of Law, hosted a Symposium on International adoption. The purpose was to \\"take advantage of the gathered expertise to explore the question of how international adoption can be reformed to ensure respect for the rights and dignity of birth families, children and adoptive families [the adoption triad].\\". Richard Cross, a senior special agent for Immigration and Customs Enforcement [ICE] assigned to the ICE Human Trafficking Unit in Seattle, Washington, spoke at the event. His entire lecture and audio file from the lecture are available for download on Cumberland's website.Full lecture of special agent Richard Cross Richard Cross's full video and audio lecture available here > Richard Cross, the lead federal investigator for the prosecution of Lauryn > Galindo for visa fraud and money laundering involved in Cambodian adoptions, > estimated that most of the 800 adoptions Galindo facilitated were fraudulent > --either based on fraudulent paperwork, coerced/induced/recruited > relinquishments, babies bought, identities of the children switched, > etc.Desiree Smolin and David Kruchkow, Why Bad Stories Must Be Told, The > Adoption Agency Checklist, Adopting Internationally website Recently Smolin, along with his wife, launched Adopting Internationally website, a website meant to provide information regarding \\"the complex issues associated with international adoption.\\" The site includes personal stories and academic analysis.Desiree Smolin and David Kruchkow, Why the Bad Stories Must be Told, The Adoption Agency Checklist, The site is also based, in part, on the Smolin's personal experience in the field of international adoption, and the Smolins are unabashedly dedicated to reforming intercountry adoption \\"so that it may consistently and reliably assist all members of the adoption triad (birth families, adoptees, and adoptive families).\\" =Biotechnology, law and ethics= Smolin heads Cumberland Law School's Center for Biotechnology, Law, and Ethics, a center unlike any other of its kind in the United States.Center for Biotechnology, Law and Ethics Research focuses on contemporary bioethical dilemmas and issues related to the Center's Annual Symposium, which is typically co-sponsored by the Cumberland Law Review. The Center has attracted numerous experts including ethicist Gregory Pence, atmospheric scientist John Christy, and U.S. Congressman Artur Davis. Each year the Cumberland Law Review typically publishes an issue featuring articles by visiting speakers. =Human rights= Smolin is a human rights advocate but approaches the international movement with concerns, which can be summed up in the conclusion to his paper Will International Human Rights Be Used as a Tool of Cultural Genocide? The Interaction of Human Rights Norms, Religion, Culture, and Gender published by the Journal of Law and Religion. Smolin's basic view regarding the scope of the international movement is that not all worthy human causes deserve to be labeled or acted upon as a right. He believes that doing so could erode or destroy the most basic human rights if the international movement gained enough power to enact all of its goals.

It is registered as a local historic landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History Hillside first opened in the Fall of 1901 on the nearby southwest corner of Le Roy Avenue and Virginia Street.History of the Berkeley Public Schools, Cowan, 1918, Internet Archives This first Hillside, constructed under the auspices of the newly formed Hillside Club,The shrinking legacy of Volney D. Moody and his heirs, Daniella Thompson, BAHA, 2008 for the Berkeley Public Schools, was one of the hundreds of structures that was destroyed by the 1923 Berkeley fire. The school was temporarily relocated, from late 1923 until August 1926, to the University School (1414 Walnut Street) while a new school building was constructed. The Berkeley School District built the present structure in 1925 on the site of several homes that were destroyed by the same fire that destroyed the original Hillside.Amanda Bartlett, \\"This historic Berkeley school could be overhauled as a tech billionaire's fantasy home\\", San Francisco Chronicle, November 3, 2019. It was designed by prominent Berkeley architect Walter H. Ratcliff. A major seismic retrofit was made in the 1930s and an additional wing added in 1964-65. The 1930s work included upgrades pursuant to the Field Act which resulted from the 1933 Long Beach earthquake. The building is landmarked for the degree to which it is intact, along with the quality of both architectural design and construction. In the early 1970s, Hillside became a primary school (K-3) as part of a district-wide re- organization. In 1982 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places (#82000961).berkeleyheritage.comOriginal Historic Preservation Nomination Form and In 1983, the school district closed HillsideMinutes, School Board Meeting, May 4, 1983 because of a declining school age population, and because it sits near or on the Hayward Fault. The Berkeley Montessori School (since renamed The Berkeley School) and the Berkeley Chess School leased part of the site. In 2012, the Berkeley Unified School District sold the school to the German International School of Silicon Valley (GISSV). GISSV replaced damaged walkways and entrance steps and removed a deteriorated temporary building that had been had been situated on the old Kindergarten playground since the early 1970s, and in early 2016, replaced the original slate shingles with new historically accurate slate shingles and also replaced the original copper gutters, which had been vandalized and stolen. The school used it for their Berkeley campus from August 2012 until December 2016, when they closed the building due to unmet seismic retrofit needs. Diggings nearby show the fault may be braided in the area, and an active fault trace below the building cannot be ruled out. In 2018, the German School sold the property to Finnish entrepreneur , who plans to use it for a residence, makerspace and artist studios. Area residents have used Hillside's playground as a de facto neighborhood park since it was constructed; a pedestrian path is heavily used. In 2009, with sale of the site to a housing developer pending, local residents proposed a special assessment district to fund purchase of the playground section of the site. =BUSD Principals= * Clara.

The novel is a hallucinatory account of a recluse's stay at a remote house, and his experiences of supernatural creatures and otherworldly dimensions. On encountering Hodgson's novels in 1934, American horror writer H. P. Lovecraft praised The House on the Borderland and other works by Hodgson at length,Lovecraft, H. P. Supernatural Horror in Literature, and Terry Pratchett has called the novel \\"the Big Bang in my private universe as a science fiction and fantasy reader and, later, writer\\".Pratchett, Terry: \\"On The House on the Borderland\\" in Horror: Hundred Best Books, page 100, edited by S Jones & K Newman, Carroll & Graf paperback, 1998 Plot summary On the third day of their fishing holiday to the remote Irish village of Kraighten, Tonnison and Berreggnog stumble upon the ruins of a strangely shaped house on a large lake. They discover the mouldering journal of the Recluse, an unidentified man who recorded his last days in the house before its destruction. The Recluse begins his journal with descriptions of how he acquired the house, along with his daily life with his sister and his faithful dog, Pepper. He started the diary to record the strange experiences and horrors occurring in and around the house. The Recluse relates a vision in which he travels to a remote and vast arena, \\"the Plain of Silence\\", surrounded by mountains with representations of mythological beast-gods, demons, and other \\"bestial horrors\\" on their slopes. In the center of the plain stands a house almost identical to his own, except that the house in the arena is much larger and appears to be made of a green jade-like substance. Along the way, he sees a huge, menacing humanoid with swine-like features. Shortly after his vision of the \\"arena,\\" the Recluse is attacked by humanoid pig-like creatures that he names \\"the swine-things\\", which appear to come from the depths of a great chasm under the house. The struggle with these creatures lasts for several nights of increasing ferocity, but the man kills several of the creatures and drives them off. As he searches for the origin of the swine- things, the man finds a pit beyond the gardens where a river descends into the earth. There he finds a tunnel leading to the great chasm. A rock slide dams the water in the pit. The man is trapped, but Pepper rescues him. The house transports the Recluse to an unknown place called \\"the Sea of Sleep\\" where he briefly reunites with his lost love. Tonnison and Berreggnog must stop reading there as the house's collapse has destroyed much of the journal. Except for an enigmatic fragment, the book becomes unreadable between the passage describing \\"the Sea of Sleep\\" and a later entry titled \\"The noise in the night\\". They realise that the water from the dammed pit has overflowed to create the lake. They suppose that the destroyed section of the journal may have explained other mysteries about the house. They resume when readable text resumes. As the Recluse's story continues, he notices that the passage of day and night has increased in speed, eventually blurring into a never-ending twilight. As he watches, his surroundings decay and collapse to dust. His own body ages, dies and becomes one with the dust. The dead world slowly grinds to a halt and the sun goes out after several million millennia. Once the world ends, the man's spirit floats through space, seeing angelic, human, and demonic forms passing before his eyes. He sees again the house's counterpart in the Arena and enters. He finds himself back in his own study on Earth, with everything apparently returned to normality, with one exception: Pepper is dead, gone to dust. The malicious swine-beast from his earlier journeys to the \\"arena\\" has followed him back to his own dimension. The creature infects the man's new dog (kept outside) with a luminous fungal disease. Although the man shoots the suffering animal, he also contracts the disease. The manuscript ends with the man, by then partly covered by the fungal growth, locked (from the outside only) in his study as the creature comes through a trap door in the basement from the chasm under the house. As he ponders suicide to end his suffering, the creature tries to open the study door and the diary abruptly ends. Tonnison and Berreggnog search for information about the man and his circumstances. They learn that the house was long believed to be evil before the unsociable old man and his elderly sister acquired it. Monthly supplies were brought in by a man who would say nothing about the Recluse. After several years, the man returned early one day from his delivery trip, rather hurriedly, and said that the house had mysteriously fallen into the chasm. The two travelers leave Kraighten and never return. The novel ends with a five- verse poem titled \\"Grief\\", found behind the fly-leaf of the diary. Characters  *Tonnison and his friend Berregnog: Two British gentleman who escape to Ireland for an enjoyable week of fishing. Tonnison does not openly address his friend (the narrator of the opening and closing chapters) by the last name, Berregnog, anywhere in the text. It is mentioned purely in the caption that summarizes how Hodgson \\"came by\\" the strange manuscript. *The Recluse: The author of the manuscript, an unknown man who owns the House on the Borderland, his narrative is the basis of the novel. He is a middle-aged, studious man who sought out the house as a place he could live out his days in solitude. He has a rational view of the world that becomes shaken by his experiences. He is cared for by his elderly, spinster sister. *Mary: The Recluse's old sister, she lives with him and acts as his housekeeper. *Pepper: His dog, a large, sturdy, brave and loyal beast who does anything to help out his master, regardless of the danger. *Unnamed woman/Lover: The former sweetheart of the Recluse, she had died years before he purchased the old house in Ireland (her exact marital status not given). The house's ability to transport him inter-dimensionally to her remote abode at \\"the sea of sleep\\" is what holds him from leaving his house in Ireland. She warns him of the danger of remaining in his house and that it (and no doubt its counterpart \\"en- rapport\\" in the \\"arena\\" many parsecs and dimensions removed) was \\"long given over to evil and was founded on grim arcane laws\\". Yet they both agree that were it not for the fantastic ability of his house to bring them together (in her dimension), they would never have been reunited. *Large Swine-Thing: A humanoid bipedal creature with the repellent head and face of a huge swine; of malign appearance and intent, it glows with a shimmering phosphorescence. The creature briefly appears during the Recluse's first visit to the \\"other\\" house in the remote arena of the \\"plain of silence\\", and once more near the end of the narrative, having somehow crossed back to the dimension (Ireland) of the Recluse. It is also able to exert some telepathic or hypnotic influence over the Recluse. *Swine-Things: Humanoid bipedal creatures with pallid-coloured pig-like heads and stature approximately the size of a grown man. They emerge from \\"the pit\\" and make repeated stealthy attempts to break into the house of the Recluse. They communicate with each other in a guttural and thick oleaginous speech which betokens a cunning sentience. Described by the Recluse as \\"half-beast, half-something else, and entirely unholy\\" with eyes which betray a \\"horribly human intelligence\\" ... \\"superhumanly foul\\". *The Old House (on the inter-dimensional borderland): The old house is of such central importance to the story that it assumes something of a character's persona. The narrative of the Recluse informs us that the house has had a bad reputation for 200 years prior to his ownership (which is a few generations before the time of the book) and hence he acquired it for a ridiculously low price. Little else is revealed about its history, and the villagers of Kraighten (40 miles distant of Ardrahan, located somewhere in the west of Ireland) all shunned it and believed it to be haunted and that it \\"was built by the Devil\\". It is located a considerable distance downstream of the unnamed river near the village and is surrounded by a great garden. The stone house appears to have been built over a vast circular chasm (learned about halfway through the journal), has a huge multiroom cellar embellished with weird fantastic sculptures, and is outwardly covered in \\"little curved towers and pinnacles, with outlines suggestive of leaping flames ... while the body of the building is in the form of a circle\\". As the title of the book hints, it is a \\"house on the borderland\\", a portal to other dimensions and serves as author Hodgson's means of transporting its owner the Recluse (and readers of the story) over vast distances of space and time. The house is linked to a larger counterpart with which it is \\"en-rapport\\"; located on a distant world (either in another dimension or at the other \\"end\\" of this universe). When Tonnison and Berreggnog discover the house (in Ireland) it has fallen into \\"the chasm\\". All that is left is an overgrown wilderness of a once-great garden estate and a small fragment of what was (probably) the study, on a huge spur of rock which juts out over a vast circular chasm. The story then becomes a flashback or framed narrative via the journal of the Recluse discovered by them in the ruins. Literary significance and criticism The book was a milestone that signalled a radical departure from the typical Gothic fiction of the late 19th century. Hodgson created a newer more realistic/scientific cosmic horror that left a marked impression on those who would become the great writers of the weird tales of the middle of the 20th century, particularly Clark Ashton Smith, and H. P. Lovecraft.\\"The Night Land: H.P.Lovecraft on William Hope Hodgson\\" David Pringle rated The House on the Borderland three stars out of four and called the novel a \\"frightening tale\\". David Pringle, The Ultimate Guide To Science Fiction. New York: Pharos Books: St.Martins Press, 1990. (p.153). Reviewing the book, Neil Barron called it \\"An imaginative tour de force whose power transcends its patchwork construction; the cosmic vision sequence makes it equally interesting as a scientific romance, but it definitely strikes what its admirer H. P. Lovecraft sought to define as \\"the true note of cosmic horror\\".\\" Neil Barron, Fantasy and Horror : a critical and historical guide to literature, illustration, film, TV, radio, and the Internet. Lanham, Md. : Scarecrow Press, 1999. (p. 121) Release details This novel was first published in Britain by Chapman and Hall, Ltd. London in 1908. Its most popular version was by Arkham House Press, Sauk City, Wisconsin, in 1946 as part of The House on the Borderland and Other Novels, the same publishers that brought out many books by other authors of weird fiction, such as H. P. Lovecraft. Adaptations =In print= In 2000, DC Comics‚Äô mature reader imprint Vertigo published a 96-page color graphic-novel adaptation The House on the Borderland, with story by Simon Revelstroke and art by Richard Corben. The book is available in soft and hardcover and contains an introduction by British comic writer Alan Moore. Revelstroke updated Hodgson's initial \\"manuscript discovery\\" frame to 1952 Ireland, and while he made an effort to retain most of the original plot and dialogue, excepting the very last page, the climax is purely Revelstroke's invention. In the credits, Revelstroke listed himself as a \\"Carnacki Fellow\\" currently \\"teaching at the Glen Carrig School of Nautical Horticulture\\", both direct (and fictional) references to Hodgson's other literary works. The adaptation was nominated for an International Horror Guild Award for Best Illustrated Narrative.http://www.horroraward.org/prevrec.html#2000 =In music= The English Doom metal band Electric Wizard featured the song \\"The House on the Borderland\\" on their Electric Wizard/Reverend Bizarre (2008) split EP.

Groundbreaking was originally scheduled for 2007. When completed, it was to contain condominiums, office space, a Kimpton-brand Hotel Palomar Nashville, and retail space. The building was originally planned to have 70 stories and stand in height. That would have made it the tallest building in the Southern United States and the tallest building in the US outside of New York City and Chicago, surpassing Bank of America Plaza in Atlanta by . However, in December 2008, developer Tony Giarratana announced that the project would be downsized, due to the economic recession.

The building's physical address would have been 505 Church Street, on the southwest corner of Church and Fifth Avenue North, which was for many years the location of a Cain-Sloan department store. Giarratana announced on July 18, 2006 that it had slated Turner Construction Co. of New York to complete the project. Construction of the building was slated to begin once half of the 400 residential apartment units had been sold. By late December 2007, 102 of the 400 units had been presold. When the plan was overhauled in December 2008, this timetable was revoked. The official website for Signature Tower was taken offline around December 2009. In November 2011, Giarratana announced that he was going to use the site to build a smaller, mixed use tower called 505 CST, which was eventually redeveloped into a residential tower called 505.

He wrote in all literature genres, from poetry through essays to theatre plays. Building his own style, he used French symbolism, impressionism, expressionism, psychological realism and is considered the father of futurism in Hungarian literature. Biography Portrait by Lajos Tihanyi from 1914 Kosztol√°nyi was born in Szabadka, Austria- Hungary (today Subotica, Serbia) in 1885. The city served as a model for the fictional town of S√°rszeg, in which he set his novella Skylark as well as The Golden Kite. He was the child of √Årp√°d Kosztol√°nyi (1859‚Äì1926), physics and chemistry professor and headmaster of a school, and Eul√°lia Brenner (1866‚Äì1948), who was of French origin. He started high school in Szabadka but because of a conflict with his teacher was expelled, and so he graduated as a private student in Szeged. Kosztol√°nyi moved to Budapest in 1903, where studied at the University of Budapest and met the poets Mih√°ly Babits and Gyula Juh√°sz, and later for a short time in Vienna before quitting and becoming a journalist‚Äîa profession he continued for the rest of his life. In 1908, Kosztol√°nyi replaced the poet Endre Ady, who had left for Paris, as a reporter for a Budapest daily. In 1910, his first volume of poems, The Complaints of a Poor Little Child, brought nationwide success and marked the beginning of a prolific period in which he published a book nearly every year. He met the actress Ilona Harmos in the winter of 1910; they got married on 8 May 1913. Kosztol√°nyi died in 1936 from cancer of the palate. Writings The literary journal Nyugat (Hungarian for \\"West\\"), which played an invaluable role in the revitalization of Hungarian literature, was founded in 1908 and Kosztol√°nyi was an early contributor, part of what is often called the \\"first Nyugat generation\\", publishing mainly in poetry. Starting in the 1920s he wrote novels, short stories, and short prose works, including Nero, the Bloody Poet (to the German edition of which Thomas Mann wrote the introduction), Skylark, The Golden Kite, Korn√©l Esti and Anna √âdes. In 1924 he published a volume of verse hearkening back to his early work, entitled The Complaints of the Sad Man. Kosztol√°nyi also produced literary translations in Hungarian, such as Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, The Winter's Tale, Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, Thornton Wilder's The Bridge of San Luis Rey, Lord Alfred Douglas' memoirs on Oscar Wilde, and Rudyard Kipling's \\"If‚Äî\\". He was the first authentic translator of Rilke's poetry, and he worked a Hungarian masterpiece after Paul Val√©ry's Cimetiere Marin. Bibliography * Nero, a v√©res k√∂lt≈ë (1922).

The earlier 851 had introduced liquid cooling, computerized fuel injection and four-valve heads to the company's two cylinder motors. In 1991 Ducati increased the capacity of the 851 to 888 cc to create the 888. Both engines featured the Desmoquattro valvetrain concept in which a four valve per cylinder motor was given desmodromic valve actuation, with cams both opening and closing the valves.

Kamber (1971) (born May 7, 1943)Community Leaders and Noteworthy Americans (1975), page 456 is an American labor union activist and political consultant in the United States. A Democrat, he worked for the AFL-CIO in the 1970s before forming The Kamber Group, a public relations firm, in 1980. The Kamber Group worked for Democratic Party candidates and labor unions for 25 years, becoming one of the most well-known \\"boutique\\" P.R. firms in Washington, D.C. Kamber sold The Kamber Group in 2005 to Carmen Group Lobbying, where he remains president of its subsidiary, Carmen Group Communications. Kamber is a frequent guest on national and local television and radio programs, newspapers and magazines, and is a published author. He currently is an adjunct professor at The American University. Early life and career Kamber, an Assyrian-American, was born in 1943 in Chicago, Illinois, and attended public schools there.\\"Bravo: Victor Kamber,\\" Zenda, May 3, 1999. Kamber subsequently attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. During his undergraduate schooling, Kamber joined the Phi Gamma Delta collegiate social fraternity. In 1965, he along with Samuel E. Honneger and Joseph Mullins worked tirelessly to establish the Delta Colony of Phi Gamma Delta at the University of New Mexico which later became the Alpha Nu Chapter of Phi Gamma Delta in 1966. He worked on the presidential campaign of United States Senator Barry Goldwater.Hartson, \\"GOP Lawyer Defends Donovan, Advises Bush,\\" Associated Press, October 5, 1984. He earned his bachelor's degree in 1965. In 1968, Kamber worked on the presidential campaigns of Nelson Rockefeller and Richard Nixon.Krebs, \\"Notes on People,\\" New York Times, August 16, 1980. Kamber later received a Master of Arts degree from the University of New Mexico, a J.D. from the Washington College of Law at the American University, and a master of laws from George Washington University (he received this last degree in 1972). Kamber later was an administrative assistant to United States Representative Seymour Halpern (R-New York). In 1970, Kamber was convicted of forgery while teaching at Prince George's Community College (PGCC). At the time, Kamber was president of the national Young Republicans' leadership training school in Chicago. Federal officials accused him of submitting a forged letter to his draft board in 1968. The letter had ostensibly been signed by the president of PGCC and attested that Kamber was a faculty member there. But PGCC president John Handley testified he had not seen the letter, had not authorized it and had not signed it. Kamber was acquitted of charges that he did not teach at the community college, but convicted of forgery and sentenced to two years in prison.\\"Young G.O.P. Aide Convicted by U.S. in Draft Fraud Case,\\" New York Times, April 4, 1970: \\"Former Young G.O.P. Aide Gets Two Years in Forgery,\\" New York Times, June 16, 1970. AFL-CIO career After his conviction, Kamber worked as a lobbyist for the Building and Construction Trades Department (BCTD) of the AFL-CIO. Under Robert Georgine, also a Republican, Kamber rose quickly to become the department's chief lobbyist. Kamber's tenure at BCTD was marked by a significant drop in the political power of the AFL-CIO on Capitol Hill. In 1977, Kamber and the BCTD persuaded the Democratic leadership in the House of Representatives to rush a common situs picketing bill onto the floor in the hopes of stampeding members of Congress to approve the legislation. Instead, the tactic lead to a major defeat for labor.Dewar, \\"Carter Wage-Floor Plan Deals Labor New Blow,\\" Washington Post, March 25, 1977; Dobkin, \\"Organized Labor, Outmaneuvered, Faces Even More Difficulty,\\" Associated Press, March 24, 1977. After the defeat of the picketing bill, Kamber was tapped by AFL-CIO president George Meany to head a labor law reform task force. Kamber's goal was to prioritize the AFL-CIO's labor law reform goals, strategize a plan for building support for the bill, and winning the legislation's enactment. The effort never got off the ground, as political changes in Congress put the labor federation on the political defensive.Shabecoff, \\"Labor Turning From Lobbying to New Political Tactics in Growing Struggle for Influence on Legislation,\\" The New York Times, June 23, 1977. The Kamber Group years Kamber left the AFL-CIO in 1980 and founded his own public relations firm, The Kamber Group. :During his first year, his announced goal was to become the \\"Hill & Knowlton of the left,\\" but his current anniversary press kit observes that the firm is \\"often referred to as the 'Bob Gray and Company of the left,'\\" a reference to the fast-growing Georgetown concern with strong White House ties.Clarity, and Gailey, \\"Briefing,\\" The New York Times, June 15, 1983. The Kamber Group quickly known as one of Washington's hottest public relations firms.\\"Public Relations: Best of the Best,\\" The Hill, May 7, 2003. In time, it became one of the nation's largest independently-owned consulting and public relations firms.Mewborn, \\"Real Estate News for December 2003,\\" Washington Life Magazine, December 2003. Almost immediately, Kamber took on some very high-profile clients. He established a legal defense fund for Rep. Frank Thompson, Jr. (D-New Jersey), who was caught in the federal government's Abscam sting.Sinclair, \\"Friends in Labor, Arts Set Up Defense Fund for Thompson,\\" The Washington Post, April 12, 1980. He also supported a movement to draft Sen. Ted Kennedy for the Democratic presidential nomination.Gailey, \\"A Political Action Unit of the Left,\\" The New York Times, February 10, 1982. In 1982, Kamber founded the Progressive Political Action Committee (ProPAC). ProPAC was a political action committee which sought to counteract political election spending by the National Conservative Political Action Committee (NCPAC) by supporting Democratic candidate for federal office. Kamber served as ProPAC's treasurer. ProPAC shut down its operations in 1983.\\"Washington News Briefs,\\" United Press International, May 11, 1981. Kamber did not neglect his labor roots, however. He was counsel for the NFL Players Association during the 1982 National Football League strike.Serrin, \\"Garvey Sought Labor Support,\\" The New York Times, September 28, 1982. He also served as a public relations consultant and spokesman for the Laborers' International Union of North America (LIUNA). In April 1983, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations heard testimony that reputed Chicago mobster Tony Accardo \\"hand-picked\\" Edward T. Hanley of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees and Angelo Fosco of LIUNA to be presidents of their respective unions. Kamber helped LIUNA strategize a political and public relations response to the allegations.Goeller, \\"Senate Panel Told Mob Figure Picked Union Leaders,\\" Associated Press, April 27, 1983. Kamber pushed his consulting firm to get into labor organizing campaigns as well. In 1984, he sued Ray Rogers, president of Corporate Campaigns, Inc., over Rogers' attempt to patent the term \\"corporate campaign.\\"Keller, \\"For Union Ally, It's All in the Name,\\" The New York Times, May 2, 1984. He also advised Doris Turner in her unsuccessful re-election bid for president of the Drug, Hospital, and Health Care Employees Union (better known as Local 1199) in 1986.Fink and Greenberg, Upheaval in the Quiet Zone, 1989. In 1984, Kamber served as a national campaign advisor to Sen. Alan Cranston during his run for the U.S. presidency.Raines, \\"Cranston Going After Labor Backing,\\" New York Times, February 23, 1983. However, Kamber eventually resigned as political and public relations consultant to the campaign after complaining that Cranston's personal staff pushed him to the side.Condone, \\"Personalities,\\" The Washington Post, October 19, 1983. The relationship between Kamber and the Cranston campaign deteriorated further when Kamber sought a temporary restraining order freezing the campaign's funds. Kamber claimed the Cranston campaign owned him $150,000, but the funds were unfrozen a short time later.\\"Campaign Funds Unfrozen,\\" Associated Press, February 27, 1984. In 1987, Kamber established Americans Against Government Control of Unions. The outfit was a non-profit company whose goal was to build public opinion against government takeovers of corrupt labor unions. William Olwell, vice president of the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW), was the group's treasurer. Kamber formed the group as UFCW, the Teamsters and other unions were under investigation for labor racketeering and domination by organized crime. Although The Kamber Group was working for the Teamsters at the time, Kamber asserted that the formation of his new organization was unrelated to the government's investigation of the Teamsters.Weinstein and Ostrow, \\"Teamsters Rally Forces to Battle U.S. Takeover,\\" Los Angeles Times, September 10, 1987. In 1988, Kamber played a key role in helping re-affiliate the Teamsters with the AFL-CIO. The union had been ejected from the labor federation in the 1950s over charges of corruption, but the AFL-CIO had been asking the Teamsters to rejoin the federation throughout the 1980s. William H. Wynn, president of UFCW, and BCTD president Georgine, assisted by Kamber, negotiated the Teamsters' return.Noble, \\"Washington Talk: Labor Union Consultants; Big Winner in Teamsters' Return,\\" The New York Times, January 8, 1988. Kamber turned his attention back to politics in 1992. He supported the U.S presidential candidacy of Sen. Tom Harkin.Kramer, \\"The Political Interest: The Vulture Watch,\\" Time, February 10, 1992. Although he did not become involved in a presidential campaign to the extent that he did in 1984, Kamber nevertheless played a big role in the 1992 election. In July of that year, he established a political action committee called Americans for Change. The group's goal was to raise $1 million to run attack ads against President George H. W. Bush.Dine, \\"PR Executive Plans 'Attack Campaign' on Bush,\\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch, July 21, 1992; Schwartz, \\"The Democrats' Floyd Brown,\\" The Washington Post, July 23, 1992. In 1993, Kamber led the battle to end a Republican filibuster of the nomination of William B. Gould IV to be chair of the National Labor Relations Board. The Republicans eventually gave up the filibuster, and Gould was confirmed.Kamber, \\"The GOP Is Smearing A Good Man, and Mr. Clinton Should Fight Back,\\" Washington Times, December 13, 1993. In 2002, Kamber became a paid spokesman for the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, acting as political consultant and public relations expert for the union.Smith, \\"Endorsement From Union Is Reno's First,\\" St. Petersburg Times, February 6, 2002. In 2003, Kamber established the Kamber Group Political Action Fund, a political action committee. Kamber became the PAC's treasurer. =USW/AFT scandal= In 1984, the United Steelworkers hired Kamber to direct several key organizing and collective bargaining campaigns.Serrin, \\"Organized Labor Is Increasingly Less So,\\" The New York Times, November 18, 1984. Kamber subsequently was forced to take responsibility for a scandal which involved the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), another AFL-CIO affiliate. In February 1985, Albert Shanker, then president of the AFT, announced at a news conference his union had convinced the New York State Teachers Retirement System to withdraw $450 million from Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company because the bank had poorly administered workers' pension funds. Shanker also announced that the union had convinced the Pennsylvania School Employees' Retirement System to withdraw $300 million from the same bank, and that five other state teachers' retirement funds were expected to do the same. AFL-CIO officials said the AFT had convinced the retirement systems to withdraw the funds to protest loans Manufacturers Hanover had made to the Phelps Dodge mining corporation, which was involved in a bitter strike with the steelworkers.Noble, \\"Reporter's Notebook: Shanker 'Clarification,'\\" The New York Times, February 23, 1985. Shanker was later forced to retract his statement. The pension fund deal had never existed, he said a few days later. The state retirement funds had withdrawn only $200 million from the bank. Shanker also admitted the fund withdrawals had been going on since mid-1984, and had nothing to do with the strike at Phelps Dodge. Shanker angrily said that he had been \\"taken advantage of,\\" and blamed Kamber. Kamber accepted responsibility, saying, \\"We're paid to take the blame, so we're at fault.\\" Closure of The Kamber Group On November 11, 1994, The Kamber Group's offices on were badly damaged by fire caused by an electrical short. Kamber is a noted collector of political memorabilia and art. Along with the loss of records, an estimated $300,000 in art‚Äîmost of it from Kamber's personal collection, on loan to The Kamber Group‚Äîwas also lost.Romano, \\"The Reliable Source,\\" The Washington Post, November 17, 1994; Groer, \\"The Party Guy's Own Party,\\" The Washington Post, May 31, 2001; Koncius, \\"A Stylish Backdrop For Vic Kamber's Exotic Collections,\\" The Washington Post, February 7, 1985.

He is a member of the Economic Club of Washington, and treasurer for the National Theatre. In 2006, Kamber received the PR News Hall of Fame Award. Electoral campaign innovations Kamber is noted as an innovative political campaigner. In 1979 Kamber purchased the Politicards name, a company that had put out a set of playing cards featuring the image of political candidates and public officials in 1972.Stumbo, \\"Politicards Sweeping the Nation\\" - LA Times article Dec 27, 1971 He went on to produce his own sets of playing cards under the Politicards name for election years 1980 and 1984. In 1996, the Politicards name was reclaimed by Peter Green, the artist responsible for the original deck in 1972. The cards, known as \\"Politicards,\\" were widely imitated over the years, especially by the most-wanted Iraqi playing cards. In 1984, Kamber created \\"Rappin' Ronnie\\", a music video which depicted a rapping President Ronald Reagan. The video was broadcast on \\"Convention Television,\\" a closed-circuit television \\"magazine program\\" broadcast to delegates at the Democratic National Convention. The video depicted a stuttering Reagan saying his trademark \\"W-w-w-w-well well well\\".Tuttle, \\"The Kamber Group: Liberal House Thrives, Paradoxically, in Reagan '80s,\\" Business Review, May 6, 1985. The music video eventually aired on MTV, and was featured in \\"Homer Loves Flanders\\", a fifth-season episode of The Simpsons. In 1992, Kamber started a PAC, Americans for Change, hoping to be the Democratic party's answer to Floyd Brown, the Republican party's opposition research specialist known for inethical, negative campaign tactics.Howard Kurtz, \\"The Democrats' Floyd Brown,\\" Washington Post, July 23, 1992. =Role in the Reagan assassination attempt= Robert F. Bonitati, an aide to President Reagan, credits Kamber with saving his life during the Reagan assassination attempt. Bonitati, a friend of Kamber's, was leaving the Washington Hilton Hotel with the president. Kamber pulled Bonitati aside for a few seconds. Just then, Reagan exited the hotel and John Hinckley, Jr. shot and wounded him and three others. \\"Bonitati has often said his brief conversation with Kamber may have saved his life.\\" Bonitati later joined The Kamber Group as a vice president, and set up a \\"nonpartisan\\" flower shop with Kamber.Conconi, \\"Personalities,\\" The Washington Post, April 1, 1986.

History In November 1979, Tose was established at Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto as independent entity from Toa Seiko Co., Ltd. In April 1984 they began to develop video games, a year later educational software. Tose's head office was moved Otokuni-gun, Kyoto Prefecture in May 1986. Event software development began in April 1987. In July 1988, new head office in Yamazaki, Kyoto was completed. Starting in May 1990, Tose began developing software for Game Boy and Super Famicom (Super NES). In August 1999, Tose was listed on the Osaka Securities Exchange 2nd Section and Kyoto Stock Exchange. In October of that year, the Kyoto Head office was opened at Shijo-Karasuma, which integrate the business of head office functions and the Karasuma CG Center.

She was a daughter of Stephen V of Hungary and his wife Elizabeth the Cuman. Mary served as Regent in Provence in 1290‚Äì1294 and in Naples in 1295‚Äì96, 1296‚Äì98, and 1302, during the absences of her consort. Family Mary's mother followed the Shamanist religion, like other Cumans. She was considered a Pagan by contemporary Christians of Europe and Elizabeth had to convert to Catholicism in order to marry Maria's father, Stephen. It's unknown at what age she chose Christianity, but could be possible that she was already raised as an Orthodox in the Hungarian royal court since her childhood. Mary was the second of six children. Her sisters, Elizabeth and Catherine both became Queen of Serbia. Another sister, Anna married Andronikos II Palaiologos. Mary's only brother was Ladislaus IV of Hungary. Her paternal grandparents were B√©la IV of Hungary and his wife Maria Laskarina. Her maternal grandparents could have been K√∂ten, leader of a tribe of Cumans and an unknown mother. Life In 1270, when Mary was only twelve years of age, she married the future Charles II of Naples. The wedding took place in Naples on 6 August 1270. The marriage was intended as a double alliance between Naples and Hungary to support the intended conquest of Byzantium by Naples, but it did not serve its purpose as her brother in 1272 made an alliance with Byzantium as well. Maria accompanied Charles on his trips and spent 1278-82 in Provence with her consort. In 1284, she made her first political act: when Charles was taken captive by Aragon, she made the decision to free the Aragonese prisoner Beatrice of Hohenstaufen. In 1285, Charles became monarch but remained in Aragonese prison. She did not take part in the regency for him in Naples, but remained in Provence, where she did take part in the administration from time to time, though she was not formal regent. In 1288, she took part in the negotiations of her consort's release, and the same year, she made a peace treaty with Aragon. Charles was released the same year, and they returned to Naples together. In 1290-94, she was regent for him in Provence. Mary's tomb in Naples On 10 July 1290, Mary's brother, Ladislaus IV of Hungary died childless. The question now was who would succeed him: he had four sisters, three of them outlived him, all four had married powerful rulers and all four had their own children. On 21 September 1290, Mary claimed the throne of Hungary. She was up against her two sisters, Catherine and Elisabeth, and their children, plus the children of her younger sister Anna. The Pope confirmed her sole rights in Hungary on 30 August 1295. However, Catherine's son, Stephen Vladislav II of Syrmia, was still a dangerous rival for Mary and Charles Martel. In the end, Charles Martel gave his cousin Slavonia as a compromise. Charles Martel was only titular King of Hungary, it was Mary's grandson who became King, Charles I of Hungary. Ultimately the claims of the sisters Mary and Catherine were united in a common descendant when the pair's great-great-granddaughter, Mary of Hungary, ascended to the Hungarian throne in 1382. When the line of Charles Martel and the Angevins in Hungary died out, it was Sigismund, a remote descendant of Bela IV, whose family succeeded. During 1290, Mary's sister Elisabeth fled from Bohemia with her son because her husband had lost favour and was executed, Mary allowed Elisabeth and her son to stay in Naples with her, before she became a nun, but escaped and remarried to Stephen Uro≈° II Milutin of Serbia (brother of Catherine's husband) Elizabeth's stay in Naples is documented during July 1300. In 1294, Mary returned with Charles to Naples. She was his representative at the negotiations with the Pope in 1295-96. Between 1296 and 1298, she served as regent of Naples in the absence of her consort. She served as regent the last time in 1302. After this, she lost her influence over states affairs, and retired to pious duties such as to finance convents and churches. Mary's husband died in August 1309. There is no evidence that she became a nun, which has sometimes been rumored, but she did spent a lot of her time in convents.

She was noted for her hectic private life, and her lesbian relationship with Djuna Barnes was fictionalized in Barnes' novel Nightwood. Early life Wood was born in Mankato, Kansas, the second of four children. Her father later moved the family to St. Louis, Missouri. In 1918 her mother and younger brother succumbed to the influenza epidemic of 1918. Two months previous to their deaths, Wood enrolled at the St. Louis School of Fine Art at Washington University. It is likely there that she learned the technique of silverpoint drawing, for which she is best known. In 1920, Wood and a fellow art student, Myra Marglous, applied for passports and left for Paris to continue studying art. Relationships While in Paris, Wood frequented Berlin and was said to have enjoyed excessive alcohol consumption, and being involved in casual sexual relationships. Accounts have described her as \\"boyish-looking\\", standing almost 6 feet tall, and \\"sexually magnetic\\". In the fall of 1921, Wood and photographer Berenice Abbott met. They were briefly lovers and remained close friends for life. Abbott later introduced Wood to poet Djuna Barnes, and made photographic portraits of both of them. Wood also had a brief relationship with the poet Edna St. Vincent Millay during the early 1920s. Wood's relationship with Djuna Barnes lasted 8 years and was deemed the \\"great love\\" of each of their lives. From 1921 to 1929 their relationship was fueled by sex, alcohol, and marred by infidelities, jealousy, and violence. Barnes was known for her jealousy with her lovers; Wood was known to be promiscuous with many women. Although Barnes wanted their relationship to be monogamous, Wood regularly sought out casual sexual partners of both sexes. Barnes, also, was never faithful. Wood became involved in an affair with a wealthy woman named Henriette Alice McCrea-Metcalf, leading to the end of her relationship with Barnes. When Wood moved to Greenwich Village in New York City in 1928, Metcalf followed. Wood continued to write and visit Barnes, to whom Wood still professed her love, but Barnes refused to become involved with Wood on a regular basis. By 1932, Wood was more of an unofficial courtesan to Metcalf, and Metcalf supported Wood's art studies in Florence. In 1934, they moved to Sandy Hook, Connecticut. In Westport, Connecticut, Wood began a gourmet catering business that ultimately failed. Her relationship with Metcalf was complicated by Wood continuing to seek out drinking and sexual companions of both sexes, and Wood became increasingly unfaithful. When, Nightwood, Barnes' best-known novel, was published in 1936, Wood, called \\"Robin Vote\\" in the book, was outraged. Wood is said to have felt misrepresented, and claimed that the publication of the book ruined her life. Career Although very little of her work survives, many of her drawings accompany collections of Djuna Barnes. Wood's sketchbook from a trip to Berlin remains in the Barnes Papers at the University of Maryland, College Park. Her work drew strongly on images from nature. Wood's silverpoint drawings were exhibited at least once, at Milch Galleries in New York City in 1931 where Mary Fanton Roberts reviewed her work favorably. Later life Around 1942 or 1943, her relationship with Metcalf had deteriorated to a breaking point due to Wood's unfaithful sexual activities and lack of any gainful employment. Metcalf offered Wood money to move out of their shared house and effectively ended their sixteen-year relationship. Once the separation was complete, Metcalf reportedly never spoke to Wood again, even when Wood, dying, is said to have requested to see her. Wood became involved with Margaret Behrens, a realtor and antique dealer, and she moved into Behrens' home in Monroe, Connecticut. They were together until Wood's death. Death Wood died of metastasized breast cancer in Danbury Hospital in 1970. Her ashes were interred in the Behrens family plot in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Legacy Author Sarah Schulman dedicated her 2018 novel Maggie Terry, to Thelma Wood. In an interview she stated Wood was, \\"historically, one of the world‚Äôs worst girlfriends who ever lived. She was the bad girlfriend of Djuna Barnes and she drove Djuna Barnes so crazy that she was the muse for Djuna Barnes‚Äôs work. So the book is dedicated to bad girlfriends.\\" References 1901 births 1970 deaths American expatriates in France Lesbian artists LGBT artists from the United States LGBT people from Kansas LGBT people from Missouri Artists from St. Louis Deaths from breast cancer Deaths from cancer in Connecticut Artists from New York City 20th-century American sculptors People from Monroe, Connecticut People from Sandy Hook, Connecticut Sculptors from New York (state) Sculptors from Missouri ","title":"Thelma Wood"},{"id":"4997996","text":"Ellicott Square Building, Buffalo, New York, 1896 D.H.

The Passing of the Great Race: Or, The Racial Basis of European History is a 1916 book by American eugenicist, lawyer, and amateur anthropologist Madison Grant (1865-1937). Though influential, the book was largely ignored when it first appeared; it went through several revisions and editions, but was never a best seller.Spiro (2009) p 167 Grant expounds a theory of Nordic superiority and argues for a strong eugenics program.

The Aryan Language In Asia = First section = Cover of the 1st edition (1916) The first section deals with the basis of race as well as Grant's own stances on political issues of the day (eugenics). These center around the growing numbers of immigrants from non-Nordic Europe. Grant claims that the members of contemporary American Protestant society who could trace their ancestry back to Colonial times were being out-bred by immigrant and \\"inferior\\" racial stocks. Grant reasons that the United States has always been a Nordic country, consisting of Nordic immigrants from England, Scotland, and the Netherlands in Colonial times and of Nordic immigrants from Ireland and Germany in later times. Grant feels that certain parts of Europe were underdeveloped and a source of racial stocks unqualified for the Nordic political structure of the U.S. Grant is also interested in the impact of the expansion of U.S. Black population into the urban areas of the North. Grant reasons that the new immigrants were of different races and were creating separate societies within America including ethnic lobby groups, criminal syndicates, and political machines which were undermining the socio-political structure of the country and in turn the traditional Anglo-Saxon colonial stocks, as well as all Nordic stocks. His analysis of population studies, economic utility factors, labor supply, etc. purports to show that the consequence of this subversion was evident in the decreasing quality of life, lower birth rates, and corruption of the contemporary American society. He reasons that the Nordic races would become extinct and the United States as it was known would cease to exist, being replaced by a fragmented country, or a corrupted caricature of itself. = Second section = The second part of the book deals with the history of the three European races: Nordic, Alpine, and Mediterranean, as well as their physical and mental characteristics. This part of the book ties together strands of thinking regarding Aryan migration theory, ethnology, anthropology, and history into a broad survey of the historical rise and fall, and expansion and retraction, of the European races from their homelands. It similarly connects the history of America with that of Europe, especially its Nordic nations.  Nordic theory  \\"Maximum Expansion of Alpines\\" ‚Äî Map from The Passing of the Great Race showing the \\"essentially peasant\\" (p. 228) Alpine migrations into Europe. \\"Expansion of the Pre-Teutonic Nordics\\" ‚Äî Early Nordic influence spreading over the continent. Grant's book is an elaborate work of racial hygiene detailing the racial history of the world. He draws on the scientific theories of genetics and Darwinian evolution, as well as the writings of previous eugenicists and racialist authors, to create a clearly written synthesis aimed at the general reader.Spiro (2009) pp. 157‚Äì158 In summary, the book elaborates Grant's interpretation of contemporary anthropology and history, which he sees as revolving chiefly around the idea of race rather than environment. He specifically promotes the idea of the Nordic race as a key social group responsible for human development; thus the subtitle of the book is The Racial Basis of European History. Grant also supports eugenics, advocating the sterilization of \\"undesirables\\", a treatment possibly to be extended to \\"types which may be called weaklings\\" and \\"perhaps ultimately to worthless race types\\": > A rigid system of selection through the elimination of those who are weak or > unfit‚Äîin other words social failures‚Äîwould solve the whole question in one > hundred years, as well as enable us to get rid of the undesirables who crowd > our jails, hospitals, and insane asylums. The individual himself can be > nourished, educated and protected by the community during his lifetime, but > the state through sterilization must see to it that his line stops with him, > or else future generations will be cursed with an ever increasing load of > misguided sentimentalism. This is a practical, merciful, and inevitable > solution of the whole problem, and can be applied to an ever widening circle > of social discards, beginning always with the criminal, the diseased, and > the insane, and extending gradually to types which may be called weaklings > rather than defectives, and perhaps ultimately to worthless race types. \\"Expansion of the Teutonic Nordics and Slavic Alpines\\"‚ÄîFurther Nordic expansion, as well as the Alpines. Other messages in his work include recommendations to install civil organizations through the public health system to establish quasi-dictatorships in their particular fields with the administrative powers to segregate unfavorable races in ghettos. He also mentions that the expansion of non-Nordic race types in the Nordic system of freedom would actually mean a slavery to desires, passions, and base behaviors. In turn, this corruption of society would lead to the subjection of the Nordic community to \\"inferior\\" races who would in turn long to be dominated and instructed by \\"superior\\" ones utilizing authoritarian powers. The result would be the submergence of the indigenous Nordic races under a corrupt and enfeebled system dominated by inferior races. = Grant's view of Nordic theory = Nordic theory, in Grant's formulation, was largely copied from the work of Arthur de Gobineau that appeared in the 1850s, except that Gobineau used the study of language while Grant used physical anthropology to define races. Both divided mankind into primarily three distinct races: Caucasoids (based in Europe, North Africa, and Western Asia), Negroids (based in Sub-Saharan Africa), and Mongoloids (based in Central and Eastern Asia). Nordic theory, however, further subdivided Caucasoids into three groups: Nordics (who inhabited Scandinavia, northern Germany, Austria-Hungary, parts of England, Scotland and Ireland, Holland, Flanders, parts of northern France, parts of Russia and northern Poland, and parts of Central Europe), Alpines (whose territory stretched from central Europe, parts of northern Italy, southern Poland to the Balkans/Southeastern Europe, central/southern Russia, Turkey and even into Central Asia), and Mediterraneans (who inhabited southern France, the Iberian peninsula, southern Italy, Greece, Wales, parts of England and Scotland, North Africa, and parts of the Middle East and Central and South Asia). \\"Present Distribution of the European Races\\"‚ÄîGrant's vision of the status quo, with the Nordics in red, the Alpines in green, and the Mediterraneans in yellow. In Grant's view, Nordics probably evolved in a climate which \\"must have been such as to impose a rigid elimination of defectives through the agency of hard winters and the necessity of industry and foresight in providing the year's food, clothing, and shelter during the short summer. Such demands on energy, if long continued, would produce a strong, virile, and self-contained race which would inevitably overwhelm in battle nations whose weaker elements had not been purged by the conditions of an equally severe environment\\" (p. 170). The \\"Proto-Nordic\\" human, Grant reasoned, probably evolved in \\"forests and plains of eastern Germany, Poland and Russia\\" (p. 170). The Nordic, in his hypothesis, was \\"Homo europaeus, the white man par excellence. It is everywhere characterized by certain unique specializations, namely, wavy brown or blond hair and blue, gray or light brown eyes, fair skin, high, narrow and straight nose, which are associated with great stature, and a long skull, as well as with abundant head and body hair.\\" Grant categorized the Alpines as being the lowest of the three European races, with the Nordics as the pinnacle of civilization. > The Nordics are, all over the world, a race of soldiers, sailors, > adventurers, and explorers, but above all, of rulers, organizers, and > aristocrats in sharp contrast to the essentially peasant character of the > Alpines. Chivalry and knighthood, and their still surviving but greatly > impaired counterparts, are peculiarly Nordic traits, and feudalism, class > distinctions, and race pride among Europeans are traceable for the most part > to the north. Grant, while aware of the \\"Nordic Migration Theory\\" into the Mediterranean, appears to reject this theory as an explanation for the high civilization features of the Greco-Roman world. > The mental characteristics of the Mediterranean race are well known, and > this race, while inferior in bodily stamina to both the Nordic and the > Alpine, is probably the superior of both, certainly of the Alpines, in > intellectual attainments. In the field of art its superiority to both the > other European races is unquestioned. Yet, while Grant allowed Mediterraneans to have abilities in art, as quoted above, later in the text in a sop to Nordic Migration Theorists, he remarked that true Mediterranean achievements were only through admixture with Nordics: > This is the race that gave the world the great civilizations of Egypt, of > Crete, of Phoenicia including Carthage, of Etruria and of Mycenean Greece. > It gave us, when mixed and invigorated with Nordic elements, the most > splendid of all civilizations, that of ancient Hellas, and the most enduring > of political organizations, the Roman State. To what extent the > Mediterranean race entered into the blood and civilization of Rome, it is > now difficult to say, but the traditions of the Eternal City, its love of > organization, of law and military efficiency, as well as the Roman ideals of > family life, loyalty, and truth, point clearly to a Nordic rather than to a > Mediterranean origin. In this manner, Grant appeared to be studiously following scientific theory. Critics warned that Grant used uncritical circular reasoning. His desirable characteristics of a people ‚Äî \\"family life, loyalty, and truth\\" ‚Äî were claimed to be exclusive products of the \\"Nordic race\\".Madison Grant, The Passing of the Great Race: Or, The Racial Basis of European History (New York, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1916), p. 139. Thus, whenever such traits were found in a non-Nordic culture, Grant said that they were evidence of a Nordic influence or admixture, rather than casting doubt on their supposed exclusive Nordic origin.  Reception and influence  By 1937, the book is said to have sold 17,000 copies in the U.S. The book received positive reviews in the 1920s, but Grant's popularity declined in the 1930s. Among those who embraced the book and its message was Adolf Hitler, who wrote to Grant to personally thank him for writing it, referring to the book as \\"my Bible.\\"Stefan K√ºhl. 2002. Nazi Connection: Eugenics, American Racism, and German National Socialism. Oxford University Press, p. 85 Spiro (2009) explains its modest sales by five factors: *The book appeared when the anti-German propaganda machine was shifting into high gear, with images of German soldiers raping nuns and bombing cathedrals. *The message was anti-democratic and anti- Christian, which did not sit well with the patriotic public. *Hereditarianism ran counter to the belief in education, hard work, and \\"pulling oneself up by one's bootstraps.\\" *Immigration during the First World War declined because ships were allocated to the war effort. *The work was categorised by the publisher as \\"science\\" and so never had a chance at mass popularity.Spiro (2009) p 161 Grant researched the published scientific literature, especially in anthropology, to support his notions of Nordic racialism. According to Grant, Nordics were in a dire state in the modern world, where after their abandonment of cultural values rooted in religious or superstitious proto- racialism, they were close to committing \\"race suicide\\" by miscegenation and being outbred by inferior stock, which was taking advantage of the transition. Nordic theory was strongly embraced by the racial hygiene movement in Germany in the early 1920s and 1930s; however, they typically used the term \\"Aryan\\" instead of \\"Nordic\\", though the principal Nazi ideologist, Alfred Rosenberg, preferred \\"Aryo-Nordic\\" or \\"Nordic-Atlantean\\". Stephen Jay Gould described The Passing of the Great Race as \\" ‚Ä¶ the most influential tract of American scientific racism ‚Ä¶ \\"Stephen Jay Gould, Bully for Brontosaurus: Reflections in Natural History (New York, New York: W. W. Norton, 1991), p. 162. Grant was involved in many debates on the discipline of anthropology against the anthropologist Franz Boas, who advocated cultural anthropology in contrast to Grant's \\"hereditarian\\" branch of physical anthropology. Boas and his students were strongly opposed to racialist notions, holding that any perceived racial inequality was from social rather than biological factors.Baker (1998), 104-107 Versions of their debates on the relative influence of biological and social factors persist in contemporary anthropology. Grant advocated restricted immigration to the United States through limiting immigration from East Asia and Southern Europe; he also advocated efforts to purify the American population though selective breeding. He served as the vice president of the Immigration Restriction League from 1922 to his death in 1937. Acting as an expert on world racial data, Grant also provided statistics for the Immigration Act of 1924 to set the quotas on immigrants from certain European countries. Even after the statute was passed, Grant continued to be irked that even a smattering of non-Nordics were allowed to immigrate to the country each year. He also assisted in the passing and prosecution of several anti- miscegenation laws, notably the Racial Integrity Act of 1924 in the state of Virginia, where he sought to codify his particular version of the \\"one-drop rule\\" into law. Grant became a part of popular culture in 1920s America. Author F. Scott Fitzgerald made a lightly disguised reference to Grant in The Great Gatsby. Tom Buchanan was reading a book called The Rise of the Colored Empires by \\"this man Goddard\\", a combination of Grant and his colleague Lothrop Stoddard. (Grant wrote the introduction to Stoddard's book The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy.) \\"Everybody ought to read it\\", the character explained. \\"The idea is if we don't look out the white race will be ‚Äî will be utterly submerged. It's all scientific stuff; it's been proved.\\" Ernest Hemingway might also have alluded to The Passing of the Great Race in the subtitle of his book The Torrents of Spring; A Romantic Novel in Honor of the Passing of a Great Race. The book was a parody of contemporary writers and would thus be referring to them sarcastically as a \\"great race\\". Americans turned against Grant's ideas in the 1930s; his book was no longer sold, and his supporters fell away.Spiro (2009) p 347 In Europe, however, Nordic theory was adopted during the 1930s by the Nazis and others. Grant's book and the genre in general were read in Germany, but eugenicists increasingly turned to Nazi Germany for leadership. Heinrich Himmler's Lebensborn (\\"Fount of Life\\") Society was formed to preserve typical Nordic genes, such as blond hair and blue eyes, by sheltering blonde, blue-eyed women.Spiro (2009) p 363-64 The book was also the earliest emergence of the white genocide conspiracy theory as The Passing of the Great Race specifically focuses on an aforementioned supposed \\"race suicide\\" of Nordics by non-Nordics.

The concept of ready schools is part of the larger school readiness movement, which seeks to better prepare children for school and schools for children.  History  The concept was popularized in the 1990s by the United States National Education Goals Panel, a taskforce of educators and politicians. The purpose of this taskforce was to set national educational policy in terms of readiness goals for children and schools. This work was discontinued with the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act. Ready schools work was continued at the state level, particularly in North Carolina, and through initiatives led by the Annie E. Casey Foundation and the W.K. Kellogg Foundation. The National Educational Goals Panel (1998) recognized that preschool and family support services may not be sufficient to enable children to learn skills that precede an ability to succeed academically. The Panel stated that schools had a responsibility to be ready to meet the diverse needs of children. The ten key principles that the panel considered essential to achieving ‚Äúready‚Äù schools are that schools must: * Smooth the transition between home and school * Endeavor to achieve continuity between early care and education programs and elementary schools * Help children learn and understand their complex world * Strive to help every child achieve success * Help every teacher and every adult who interacts with children during the school day be successful * Introduce or expand approaches shown to raise achievement * Alter practices and programs if existing ones do not benefit children * Serve children in communities * Take responsibility for results * Have strong leadership  State work  =North Carolina= The North Carolina School Goal Team developed a self-assessment instrument for schools. The portion of the instrument described here is very specific in recommending requirements for teachers and administrators and also address types of programs, practices, curricula, and interactions that should occur with children. These expectations go beyond what many states feel they can track and measure. The team specified that: * Administrators and teachers read, process, and understand the National Association for the Education of Young Children‚Äôs (NAEYC) Developmentally Appropriate Practices. * The school use developmentally appropriate assessment instruments. These instruments must identify individual differences and needs and allow a determination of reasonable expectations of children‚Äôs capabilities. * The curriculum address each child‚Äôs needs * Curricula offer learning centers, value ‚Äúplay‚Äù as the work of young children, and provide interrelated, hands-on, active learning. * Curricula have a meaningful context for learning rather than having children learn different skills in isolation. * Curricula integrate children‚Äôs new experiences with their previous experiences through project work and mixed- grouping (ability/age) in a way that is not hurried. * Teachers use a wide variety of teaching materials and methods. * Teachers develop children‚Äôs social skills with conflict resolution strategies taught in meaningful contexts. * The daily schedule for children balance open-ended and structured time as well as include daily rituals and routines. * Teachers use language and communication development as a rich and valued curriculum component. * Teachers use multicultural materials and nurture the cultural and linguistic diversity of students. * Teachers assess each child‚Äôs growth and development through work samples, student and parent interviews, teacher observations, photographs, etc. * Teachers practice inclusion, placing children in the least restrictive environment. * Teachers participate in research-based, state-of- the-art on-going professional development. Recommendations for facilities are not as extensive and tend to be discussed along with issues such as class size. The same North Carolina self-assessment instrument for schools not only expects that the physical environment is welcoming to children and arranged in learning centers to encourage choice, problem solving, and discovery, but also anticipates the availability of some services on-site. Specifically, children would receive on-site health assessments for physical, vision, and dental health annually (Report of the Ready Schools Goals Team, 2000).  Foundation Initiatives  The W.K. Kellogg Foundation launched the Supporting Partnerships to Assure Ready Kids (SPARK) Initiative in 2001 to create community partnerships that prepare children for school and schools for children. The W.K. Kellogg Foundation uses nine Pathways to Ready Schools to frame the ready schools work being done through the SPARK initiative. The nine pathways are: #Children succeed in school #The school environment encourages a welcoming atmosphere #Strong leadership exists at every level #The school is connected to early care and education #The school connects culturally and linguistically with children and families #There is a high level of parental involvement #The school forms partnerships with the community #The school seeks out and uses assessment results #The school constantly seeks to improve its quality  Examples of Ready Schools  The SPARK Initiative Level Evaluation Team identified four diverse schools throughout the United States that display characteristics of ready schools. These schools are International Community School in Decatur, Georgia; Ka 'Umeke Ka'eo Public Charter School in Hilo, Hawaii; La Mesa Elementary School in Albuquerque, New Mexico; and Nailor Elementary School in Cleveland, Mississippi (Simons & Curtis, 2007). The first large-scale implementation of a ready schools framework was launched in the Miami-Dade County Public School System (the fourth largest school district in the country). This major, urban school reform effort seeks to raise the quality of both pre-school and elementary schools throughout Miami-Dade County by focusing on school transitions, a quality rating and improvement system for early childhood programs, teacher professional development (Ready Schools University), strong school leadership and effective community partnerships. The initiative incorporates the Pathways to Ready Schools framework that came out of the Kellogg SPARK initiative, and was influenced by the PK3 framework developed by the Foundation for Child Development. Ready Schools Miami is funded by a grant from the W.K. Kellogg foundation to the Early Childhood Initiative Foundation and The Lastinger Center for Learning at the University of Florida.

Cooperation Both the Tr·ªãnh and Nguy·ªÖn families were descended from close friends and aides to the hero-Emperor L√™ L·ª£i who liberated ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát from Chinese rule of Ming Dynasty and started the L√™ Dynasty in 1428. By 1520 a succession of weak emperors had brought the country into a state of civil war (see L√™ Dynasty's civil war). For the next 20 years the Tr·ªãnh and Nguy·ªÖn clans fought as allies against the usurper M·∫°c ƒêƒÉng Dung who took the throne of the emperor L√™ Cung Ho√†ng. When L√™ dynasty was restored in 1533,The M·∫°c dynasty still in the power and retreated to Cao Bang gradually. Both Tr·ªãnh and Nguy·ªÖn joined together as the alliance to against the M·∫°c dynasty to restore fully territory of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát to L√™. In theory, they both were fighting on behalf of the L√™ Emperor L√™ Trang T√¥ng but in reality, the Emperor was a figurehead with little or no power. Partition The prime mover in the period from 1525 onwards was Nguyen Kim. His daughter married the young head of the Tr·ªãnh family Trinh Kiem. Around 1530, the rebels of Le Dynasty royalist were forced into exile in Lan Xang (modern-day Laos) but they gathered a new army and captured some southern provinces of Dai Viet. In 1545, Nguyen Kim and subsequently his eldest son Nguyen Uong was assassinated and his son-in-law, Trinh Kiem, took control over the Royal army after that. 13 years later (in 1558) Tr·ªãnh Ki·ªÉm gave the rulership over the southernmost province of Quang Nam to Nguyen Hoang, the second son of Nguyen Kim and his wife's brother. The suspicious causes of death of his father and brother and the takeover of his brother in law probably caused bitter resentment in Nguyen Hoang and the later rivalry between the 2 families. For the next 55 years, Nguyen Hoang ruled Quang Nam. He gradually asserted his control over the province and extended his control south into the remaining Champa lands. Periodically, he sent military forces north to help the Trinh in their long fight against the M·∫°c dynasty. In 1570 Trinh Kiem died and was succeeded by his second son Trinh Tung, a vigorous leader who captured Hanoi from the M·∫°c king in 1572. However, the M·∫°c emperor (Mac Mau Hop) recaptured the city the next year. 20 years later, Trinh Tung, again captured Hanoi and executed Mac Mau Hop in 1592. In 1593, Nguyen Hoang went personally to the court, bringing money and an army to help destroy the remaining Mac armies. Once the M·∫°c were defeated, Nguyen Hoang held the office of Grand Vizier for the next 7 years. However, his nephew Trinh Tung became increasingly wary of Nguyen Hoang's influence in the court and tried to put him under surveillance by having Ho√†ng near him at all time. Nguyen Hoang adopted Trinh Tung's 2 important generals as his nephews and incited them to rebel against their commander. When the rebels stormed the court, Trinh Tung fled with the Emperor while Ho√†ng took to the Southern Provinces, never to return. In 1600 the old Nguyen ruler broke relations with the Trinh court and titled himself as the Vuong (a term meaning prince or king). Hoang died in 1613. The new leader of the Nguyen, Nguyen Phuc Nguyen, continued his father's policy of defiance, but also initiated friendly relations with the Europeans sailing into the area. A foreign trading post was set up in Hoi An. By 1615 the Nguyen were producing their own bronze cannons with the aid of Portuguese engineers. The first campaign Map of Vietnam showing (roughly) the areas controlled by the Tr·ªãnh, Nguy·ªÖn, M·∫°c, and Champa about the year 1640 In 1620, Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c Nguy√™n officially refused to send taxes to the court in Hanoi. A formal demand was made to the Nguy·ªÖn to submit to the authority of the court, and it was formally refused. In 1623 Tr·ªãnh T√πng died and was succeeded by his son Tr·ªãnh Tr√°ng. Now Tr·ªãnh Tr√°ng made a formal demand for submission, and again Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c Nguy√™n refused. Finally in 1627 open warfare broke out between the Tr·ªãnh and the Nguy·ªÖn. For four months a large Tr·ªãnh army battled against the Nguy·ªÖn army but were unable to defeat them. The result of this war was that Vietnam had effectively been partitioned into northern and southern regions, with the Tr·ªãnh controlling most of the north and the Nguy·ªÖn controlling most of the south; the dividing line was the Gianh River in Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh Province. This border was very close to the Seventeenth parallel (in actuality the B·∫øn H·∫£i River located just to the south in Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Province), which was imposed as the border between North Vietnam and South Vietnam during the Partition of Vietnam (1954‚Äì75). While the Tr·ªãnh ruled over a much more populous territory, the Nguy·ªÖn had several advantages. First, they were on the defensive. Second, the Nguy·ªÖn were able to take advantage of their contacts with the Europeans, specifically the Portuguese, to purchase advanced European weapons and hire European military experts in fortifications. Third, the geography was favorable to them, as the flat land suitable for large organized armies is very narrow at this point of Vietnam; the mountains nearly reach to the sea. After the first assault, the Nguy·ªÖn built two massive fortified lines which stretched a few miles from the sea to the hills. The walls were built north of Hu·∫ø near the city of ƒê·ªìng H·ªõi. The Nguy·ªÖn defended these lines against numerous Tr·ªãnh offensives which lasted till 1672. The story from this time is that the great military engineer was a Vietnamese general who was hired away from the Tr·ªãnh court by the Nguy·ªÖn. This man is given the credit in Vietnam for the successful design of the Nguy·ªÖn walls. Against the walls the Tr·ªãnh mustered an army of 100,000 men, 500 elephants, and 500 large ships (Dupuy \\"Encyclopedia of Military History\\" pg. 596). The initial attacks on the Nguy·ªÖn wall was unsuccessful. The attacks lasted for several years. Later campaigns Upper:Goa style arquebuses - Probably were widespread in Vietnam during the 17th century In 1633 the Tr·ªãnh tried an amphibious assault on the Nguy·ªÖn to get around the wall. The Tr·ªãnh fleet was defeated by the Nguy·ªÖn fleet at the battle of Nhat-Le. Around 1635 the Tr·ªãnh copied the Nguy·ªÖn and sought military aid from the Europeans. Tr·ªãnh Tr√°ng hired the Dutch to make cannons and ships for the Royal army. In 1642-43, the Tr·ªãnh army attacked the Nguy·ªÖn walls. With the aid of the Dutch cannons, the Tr·ªãnh army broke through the first wall but failed to break through the second. At sea, the Tr·ªãnh, with their Dutch ships Kievit, Nachtegaels and Woekende Book were destroyed in a humiliating defeat by the Nguy·ªÖn fleet with their Chinese style galleys.Reid p. 230.Hoang, p. 83.Wiest, p. 23.Li, p. 96.Weiss, p. 176. Tr·ªãnh Tr√°ng staged yet another offensive in 1648 but at the battle of Truong Duc, the Royal army was badly beaten by the Nguy·ªÖn. The new L√™ king died around this time, perhaps as a result of the defeat. This now left the door open for the Nguy·ªÖn to finally go on the offensive. Nguy·ªÖn offensive The Nguy·ªÖn launched their own invasion of northern Vietnam in 1653. The Nguy·ªÖn army attacked north and defeated the weakened Royal army. Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh Province was captured. Then H√† Tƒ©nh Province fell to the Nguy·ªÖn army. In the following year, Tr·ªãnh Tr√°ng died as Nguy·ªÖn forces made attacks into Ngh·ªá An Province. Under a new Tr·ªãnh Lord, the capable Tr·ªãnh T·∫°c, the Royal army attacked the Nguy·ªÖn army and defeated it. The Nguy·ªÖn were fatally weakened by a division between their two top generals who refused to cooperate with each other. In 1656 the Nguy·ªÖn army was driven back all the way to their original walls. Tr·ªãnh T·∫°c tried to break the walls of the Nguy·ªÖn in 1661 but this attack, like so many before it, failed to break through the walls. The end of the fight In 1672, the Tr·ªãnh army made a last effort to conquer the Nguy·ªÖn. The attacking army was under the command of Tr·ªãnh T·∫°c's son, Tr·ªãnh CƒÉn, while the defending army was under the command of Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c T·∫ßn's son Prince Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c Thu·∫≠n. The attack, like all the previous attacks on the Nguy·ªÖn walls, failed. This time the two sides agreed to a peace. With mediation supplied by the government of the Kangxi Emperor, the Tr·ªãnh and the Nguy·ªÖn finally agreed to end the fighting by making the Linh River the border between their lands (1673). Although the Nguy·ªÖn nominally accepted the L√™ King as the ruler of Vietnam, the reality was, the Nguy·ªÖn ruled the south, and the Tr·ªãnh ruled the north. This division continued for the next 100 years. The border between the Tr·ªãnh and the Nguy·ªÖn was strongly guarded but peaceful. Conquest of Hu·∫ø - 1775 The long peace came to an end in 1774. At the time, the Nguy·ªÖn were under heavy assault from T√¢y S∆°n army and part of their force had been defeated in recent fighting in Cambodia. The result was, the army in the north defending Hu·∫ø was weak. Tr·ªãnh Sam, one of the last Tr·ªãnh Lords and ruler of the north, launched his attack on the Nguy·ªÖn on 15 November 1774. For the first time, the Nguy·ªÖn walls were broken and captured. In February 1775, the Nguy·ªÖn capital of Hu·∫ø was captured by the Royal (Tr·ªãnh) army. After some fighting with the army of the T√¢y S∆°n, a treaty was signed and the Tr·ªãnh army left the destruction of the Nguy·ªÖn to the southern rebels. A dozen years later the Tr·ªãnh Lords would be thrown out of Vietnam by the youngest and most popular of the T√¢y S∆°n brothers. The model of a riverine warship (M√¥ng ƒê·ªìng) during Tr·ªãnh's era in XVII. Legacy To fight against the larger and more powerful Imperial army under Tr·ªãnh clan, Nguy·ªÖn lords actively expanded their territory to the South into the former land of the Champa empire. They annexed much of the area that is now the southern half of Vietnam. Both sides were enthusiastic in foreign technologies and welcoming to outsiders. From foreign traders, craftsmen and mercenaries (mostly from Portugal, Holland, China and Japan), both sides acquired advanced civil and military technologies such as mechanics, shipbuilding and artillery construction, as well as cultural and religious elements. This long period played an important role in the formation of Vietnamese identity. The Dutch brought Vietnamese slaves they captured from Nguy·ªÖn lord territories in Qu·∫£ng Nam Province to their colony in Taiwan.Mateo, p. 125.

Career His uncle, William Gordon, had retired as Member of Parliament for Aberdeenshire in 1854 and Haddo put himself forward as his successor. However, Haddo had contracted what was probably tuberculosis, and he went to Egypt to spend a few months in a warm climate. Despite being absent from Scotland and not having canvassed the constituency, Haddo won the election and returned to take his seat in the House of Commons, in good health, a year later. He left the Commons after inheriting his father's title in 1860 and made a second trip to Egypt. Aberdeen had previously converted to Evangelicalism and it was in Egypt that he campaigned for the Coptics to convert to his own faith.

In 1966, riding on horseback ceased to be part of police duties for new members of the RCMP. The unit then moved to Pakenham, Ontario in 1968 and became a separate unit. The RCMP and the Musical Ride were all men at its foundation. The first female came into the unit in 1981.

The landscape includes a river, moraine, a forest with under-story herbs and wildlife, a rail-trail that moves through the site, and cultural history spots. The park is part lowland and part upland. History Shady Rest was originally owned and operated by the Price family. In 1985, Mrs. Price, who was the sole owner after her husband David died, wanted to ensure that the site would be retained as a natural resource and retreat along with the related Heartland Pathways rail bed that runs through the site. Mrs. Price contributed significantly to the purchase of the rail bed. In 1995, after Mrs. Price's death, the formal purchase of Shady Rest was arranged for preservation purposes and to allow the site to return to nature and dedicate it as a natural area. A non-profit organization, the Sangamon Valley Conservancy (SVC), was funded for that purpose by a number of contributors. Additionally, in 2006, a park was established by the Piatt County Forest Preserve District with the use of a grant from the Illinois Clean Energy Community Foundation to create a new place to fish, canoe, and hike.New Forest Preserve Park Near White Heath Blue Ridge Backwoods, Retrieved on April 15, 2008 Natural history The recreational nature of the woods remains identifiable by the presence of big and small but no in-between trees. This indicates that the site was at one point cleared of small trees and brush to create a park-like setting. As the site returned to nature the under-story plants have burgeoned, and they make a beautiful display in spring. A number of under-story herbs continue throughout the summer and fall. Settlers sought to suppress fires, so there is an excess of maples that in nature would have been culled by fire (to which maples are susceptible). Two recreation era houses remain on an upland ridge that is part of the Cerro Gordo moraine. One house is occupied, the other is a Price family retreat, and serves as an example of the inexpensive and vernacular cabin-like buildings of the period. The Cerro Gordo Moraine, which runs through Shady Rest, was the southern border of a lake that covered the lowlands extending north to Centreville. Eventually the lake broke through at Shady Rest. This breakthrough formed the Sangamon River, which runs through the site. Rail trail An abandoned Illinois Central rail-bed trail, owned by Heartland Pathways, runs through the site with a bridge and trestle over the Sangamon River that is an attraction. Shady Rest provides a convenient rest stop on the HP hiking and biking trail. The rail-bed introduces an element of railroad history. Steam trains took on water from the river at this location. The Monticello Railway Museum (MRRM) abuts the Heartland Pathways trail at White Heath, just a mile away. It is possible that the museum could extend to Shady Rest, giving museum visitors the opportunity to visit a bottomland forest and historic recreational site. Some historic railroad interests would like to extend the MRRM's tracks to Lodge to join a Norfolk Southern mainline to complete a tourist circuit south to Monticello and back to the Railway Museum. Activities In its heyday, Shady Rest sported a number of small cabins, a club house, three residences and the space for tenting and recreational activities. In recent years Shady Rest has been used as a retreat. The cabins have been torn down and the forest has grown back. The flood plains to the north that are spring-wet and are summer-dry could be used as dry-season trails. When the river is high there is the potential for canoeing on the Sangamon River from Mahomet to Decatur. The site is ideal site for artists and people wanting to enjoy the aesthetics of an outdoor setting. In the community Shady Rest is currently being transferred by the Sangamon Valley Conservancy to the Piatt County Forest Preserve, with the aid of a Clean Energy Community Foundation Grant. The grant will pay the Forest Preserve to reimburse SVC for the loans that HP and SVC solicited in order for SVC to buy the site. The Piatt County Forest Preserve will then become the owners in perpetuity and caretakers of the site. The grant will pay approximately $4,000 per acre to release the people who have made tangible loans to SVC for the preservation. The grant does not cover preservation costs incurred by Heartland Pathways or others in the twenty years prior to the SVC purchase. The transfer of Shady Rest to the Forest Preserve allows a tax base for the natural and cultural restoration, maintenance and interpretation of the park.

The particles are held there by surface tension. Normally the surface tension does not in itself give rise to an attraction or repulsion among particles on a meniscus. A capillary interaction requires that the particles are pushed or pulled away from the meniscus, for instance because of their weight, if the particles are large and heavy enough. It has been proposed by Nikolaides et al. that the observed attractions are the result of an electrostatic pressure on the liquid interface, due to electric charges on the particles. The electrostatic pressure arises because the dielectric constants of the liquids differ. Due to the pressure, the liquid interface deforms. This pressure is balanced by a simultaneous electrostatic force acting on the charges, and hence on the particle itself. The force has been coined the electrodipping force by Kralchevsky et al. - it dips the particle in one of the liquids. According to Nikolaides, the electrostatic force engenders a long range capillary attraction. However, this explanation is controversial; other authors have argued that the capillary effect of the electrodipping force is in fact cancelled by the electrostatic pressure on the interface, so the resulting capillary effect would be insignificant.

He began his career working with Max Reinhardt in Vienna. When Reinhardt moved to the United States in the early 1930s, Horner travelled with Max Reinhardt's production group acting as his stage manager. Max Reinhardt's staging of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream (1934) for the summer Hollywood Bowl season in Los Angeles, Harry Horner was the production's stage manager and also an actor in the production. Following Max Reinhardt to New York, Harry Horner assisted Reinhardt in his staging of the Biblical musical spectacle The Eternal Road (Der Weg der Verheissung); the production had music by Kurt Weill; conducted by Harry Horner; opening at the Manhattan Opera House 1/7/1937-5/15/1937 with scenic design, costume design and lighting by Norman Bel Geddes. Max Reinhardt, disgusted with Norman Bel Geddes lack of interest by not showing up for production rehearsals, pressed Harry Horner into acting as art director supervising the sets, costumes, and the lighting. Because Horner had been faithful to Reinhardt as his stage manager, Reinhardt knew that he could depend upon Horner's many faceted talents and abilities. Consequently, Harry Horner fell into the scenic design craft and was employed as a stage designer. Harry Horner designed the scenery for the drama Lady In The Dark, a drama with a musical dream sequence (music: Kurt Weill); opening January 23, 1941 ‚Äì June 15, 1941 (reopening 10/2/41-5/30/42, revived 2/27/43-5/15/43). Harry Horner's stage design legacy is the first use of a center stage donut turntable ring, inner and outer turntable rings moving simultaneously and in reverse of each other. The innovative stage design for Lady In The Dark was the first turntable usage on a Broadway stage. During World War II, he served as production designer and set designer for the U.S. Army Air Forces show Winged Victory.Hart, Moss. Winged Victory (cast & crew credits), Random House, 1944 He won an Oscar in 1949 for his work on William Wyler's The Heiress and another in 1961 for Robert Rossen's drama The Hustler. Gene Callahan was The Hustler film's set decorator. When Gene Callahan was nominated in the Oscar Art Direction category for Elia Kazan's America, America, Harry Horner drew the set sketch for Gene, which was used in the telecast's program Art Direction category. One of his first notable successes was George Cukor's A Double Life (1947) and he soon found himself up on the Oscar podium in 1949 for his work on William Wyler's The Heiress. He worked with Cukor again in 1950 on Born Yesterday and then tried his hand at directing on several TV series, including Gunsmoke.Library of Congress Performing Arts Encyclopedia: David Meeker, Jazz on the Screen, Library of Congress, 2007 http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/loc.natlib.jots.200015912/default.html He was nominated for a third time in 1969 for Sydney Pollack's 30s drama They Shoot Horses, Don't They?.American Film Institute, Creating Film Texture: A Conversation with Harry Horner, 1970. http://www.fathom.com/feature/122576/index.html Horner directed a few films beginning with Red Planet Mars and Beware, My Lovely both in 1952.

The Tektite program was the first scientists-in-the-sea program sponsored nationally. The habitat capsule was placed in Great Lameshur Bay, Saint John, U.S. Virgin Islands in 1969 and again in 1970.  Habitat  The Tektite habitat was designed and built by General Electric Company Space Division at the Valley Forge Space Technology Center in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. The Project Engineer who was responsible for the design of the habitat was Brooks Tenney, Jr. Tenney also served as the underwater Habitat Engineer on the International Mission, the last mission on the Tektite II project. The Program Manager for the Tektite projects was Dr. Theodore Marton at General Electric. The habitat appeared as a pair of silos: two white metal cylinders 4 m in diameter, 6 m high, joined by a flexible tunnel and seated on a rectangular base in 15 m of water.  Tektite I  On 28 January 1969 a detachment from Amphibious Construction Battalion 2 augmented by an additional 17 Seabee divers from both the Atlantic and Pacific fleets as well as the 21st NCR began the installation the habitat in Great Lameshur Bay in the U. S. Virgin Islands.Seabeemagazine online They had it completed on February 12. Three days later four U.S. Department of Interior scientists (Ed Clifton, Conrad Mahnken, Richard Waller and John VanDerwalker) descended to the ocean floor to begin the ambitious diving project dubbed \\"Tektite I\\". By March 18, 1969, the four aquanauts had established a new world's record for saturated diving by a single team. On April 15, 1969, the aquanaut team returned to the surface with over 58 days of marine scientific studies. More than 19 hours of decompression time were needed to accommodate the scientists' return to the surface. The United States Office of Naval Research coordinated Tektite I. Much of the research for Tektite I centered on humans in this new environment. Topics investigated would include: biology (blood changes, sleep patterns, oxygen toxicity), decompression and decompression sickness, microbiology and mycology.  Tektite II  The United States Department of the Interior coordinated Tektite II, with part of the funding coming from NASA, which was interested in the psychological study of the scientific teams working in closed environments, similar to that of spacecraft. The missions were carried out in the summer of 1970 in Great Lameshur Bay, St. John Island, U.S. Virgin Islands, at a depth of 43-ft. Tektite II comprised ten missions lasting 10‚Äì20 days with four scientists and an engineer on each mission. The fifth mission, designated Mission 6-50, was the first all-female saturation dive team. The elite team of scientist-divers included Renate Schlentz True of Tulane, team leader Sylvia Earle, Ann Hurley Hartline and Alina Szmant, graduate students at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and Margaret Ann \\"Peggy\\" Lucas Bond, a Villanova electrical engineering graduate who served as Habitat Engineer. The Tektite II missions were the first to undertake in-depth ecological studies from a saturation habitat. Medical and human research oversight for Tektite II was well documented in a series of reports covering a project overview, saturation diving, lessons learned from Tektite I, application to Tektite II, medical responsibilities and psychological monitoring, medical supervision duties medical and biological objectives project logistics, lessons learned, excursions to deeper depths from storage pressure, decompression tables, general medical observations, psychological observations, blood changes and general program conclusions.  Tektite III  Tektite III (Project Tektite) was a wholly owned and operated California 501 C(3) Non-Profit Corporation. Harold C. Ross was Project Manager. When Tektite II ended General Electric placed the habitat in storage in Philadelphia. A group of interested parties purchased the habitat from General Electric for $1.00 with the stipulation it would be removed from the GE storage facility. The habitat was trucked across the United States to Fort Mason in San Francisco where it was placed on display. Attempts were made to refurbish the habitat so it could be used in San Francisco Bay as a teaching tool. By 1980 the habitat was fully restored and certified to be used underwater, but funds for actually submerging and operating the habitat again were not available. While the habitat was on display at Fort Mason, many school children were taken through the habitat free of charge by volunteers. Unfortunately lack of funds ended the project and the habitat was moved to storage along the Oakland Estuary in 1984. After several years, the habitat again deteriorated. In 1991 the habitat was dismantled by welding school students and the metal was recycled.Tektite Underwater Habitat Museum - Tektite III (archived from the original) - Note that this page states: \\"Web page text edited and revised with permission from James W.

It is a subfield of the more general epidemiology. It has roots in sociological studies of the early 20th century. However, while sociological exposures are still widely studied in psychiatric epidemiology, the field has since expanded to the study of a wide area of environmental risk factors, such as major life events, as well as genetic exposures. Increasingly neuroscientific techniques like MRI are used to explore the mechanisms behind how exposures to risk factors may impact psychological problems and explore the neuroanatomical substrate underlying psychiatric disorders.Susser E, Schwartz S, Morabia A, Bromet EJ. Psychiatric Epidemiology: Searching for the Causes of Mental Disorders. New York: Oxford University Press, 2006. History Sociological studies of the early 20th century can be regarded as predecessors of today's psychiatric epidemiology. These studies investigated for instance how suicide rates differ between Protestant and Catholic countries or how the risk of suffering from schizophrenia is increased in neighborhood characterized with high levels of social isolation. After World War 2 researchers began using community surveys to assess psychological problems. By the 1980s the development of new diagnostic assessment instruments and reliable criteria for mental disorders given by the DSM-3 began a trend to estimating the prevalence of mental disorders next to symptoms. As an example, in an attempt to measure the prevalence of mental illness in the United States, Lee Robins and Darrel A. Regier conducted a study called the Epidemiological Catchment Area Project which surveyed samples of the general population at five sites across America. In the study, it was found that about a third of all Americans suffer from mental illness at some point in their lives. This statistic is often referred to as lifetime prevalence. Today, epidemiological studies focus on the etiology of mental disorders, i.e. the identification and quantification of causes underlying psychiatric problems and their mechanisms, rather than mere estimation of prevalence. It is not ethically possible to experimentally expose study participants to stressors suspected to cause psychiatric disorders, thus epidemiological techniques are required to study the etiology. For this purpose longitudinal studies, which follow children and adults for a long period of time, often for many years, are particularly useful. These allow the study of naturally occurring exposures and how they affect changes in psychiatric symptoms. Two notable historical studies focusing on etiology are the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study and the Christchurch Health and Development Study. These studies began in the 70's and studied the impact of perinatal problems, genetic variants, sexual abuse and other adverse exposures on psychological problems in childhood and later in adulthood. Assessment of disorders Many different instruments are used to assess mental disorders in epidemiological studies depending on the age of the participants, available recourses and other considerations. Studies featuring adolescents and adults often use structured interviewing, a technique in which a series of questions is administered by interviewers to determine whether an individual is disordered or nondisordered. Alternatively, questionnaire are used, which can be administered more easily. In epidemiological studies featuring children, psychopathology is often assessed using parent report, however, multi-informant approaches, e.g. the simultaneous use of parent, teachers and self-report, is popular as well. Exposures studied =Genetic= Psychiatric disorders show substantial heritability according to twin studies. A meta-analysis of most twin-studies conducted found a combined heritability of 46% for psychiatric disorders. Given the large contribution of genetic variants on psychiatric disorders, one major focus of psychiatric epidemiology is psychiatric genetics. A combination of family and molecular studies are used within psychiatric epidemiology to uncover the effects of genetics on mental health. Twin studies estimate the influences of all genetic variants and effects, but, due to relying purely on relatedness information, are limited in explaining the specific genetic mechanisms and architecture underlying psychiatric traits. Molecular studies confirm findings from family studies that genetic variants can partly explain the occurrence of psychological problems, e.g. by quantifying the total contribution of common genetic variants. Furthermore an increasing number of specific genetic loci are being associated with psychiatric disorders in large genome-wide association studies =Environmental= Next to genetic exposures, a wide variety of environmental exposures are being studied as well, such as nutrition,, urbanicity, stressful life events, and bullying. In contrast to genetic studies, the investigation of environmental exposures of psychiatric problems face the question of bidirectional causality. For example, both directions of causation are possible: experiencing social stress might cause depression, or being depressed might worsen relationships with others and thus cause social stress (or it may even be the case that both interact, possibly as a self-reinforcing feedback loop). Finding an association between the occurrence of an environmental exposure and a disorder could be the result of either or both situations. Multiple strategies exist in psychiatric epidemiology to assess the direction of causality. One possibility is measuring the exposure and outcome multiple times. Researchers can then analyze how much a change in psychiatric symptoms can be attributed to the exposure at a previous time point, but also whether changes in the exposure can be predicted by previous symptom levels (cross-lagged model). Such a model was e.g. applied to the study of internalizing and externalizing psychological problems and stressful life events. Both, psychiatric problems as well as life events, were measured multiple times during grade 7,8,9,10 and 12. The researchers observed that stressful life events precede both internalizing and externalizing psychological problems, but appear to be also the result of experiencing such symptoms. An alternative approach is the use of twin studies, because discordance between monozygotic twins suggests environmental effects. =Prenatal= Brain development is a complex process that starts during the early stage of embryogenesis and continues into adulthood. Studies focusing on risk factors of exposure on early brain development, have found differences in brain anatomy in children of mothers that consumed marihuana compared to unexposed control subjects, emphasizing the importance of intrauterine risk factors in early brain development. Population-based imaging studies Population-based imaging studies attempt to find neurobiological substrates to explain psychiatric symptomatology. These studies have mainly used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences to study the brain at a population scale: MRI sequences can be used to noninvasively study structural (e.g. volumetric) brain differences between individuals. Other examples of MRI sequences are functional MRI (fMRI), studying activational patterns of the brain and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), measuring the development and integrity of white matter tacts. These techniques have been used at various developmental stages, examples for each stage are discussed below. =Pediatric population= Imaging studies in children showed a significant association between autistic traits and gyrification patterns (winding patterns) of the brain on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). DTI studies, focusing on white matter development, showed that cognitive ability in children is positively associated with white matter integrity, as expressed by fractional anisotropy (FA). =Elderly population= Population-based studies in a large elderly population found a significant association between vascular white matter disease and depressive symptoms.

Countervailance in formal political theory dates back at least to Medieval times, especially in Roman Catholic and early Protestant movements, not all of which were successful in achieving their own ends. The Conciliar Movement, although ultimately ending in failure to reform the Catholic church, \\"raised issues that are fundamental in all domains of social organization, and it contributed to the understanding of the general principle of countervailance, which eventually became the foundation of modern constitutionalism.\\" This political organization stands in contrast to polities such as principalities where \\"various princes were absolute rulers in their domain\\" or in modern examples of totalitarian governments. In the 20th century, \\"Countervailing Power\\" is a theory of political modification of markets, formulated by American economist John Kenneth Galbraith in his 1952 book American Capitalism. In the classic liberal economy, goods and services are provided and prices set by free bargaining. According to Galbraith, modern economies give massive powers to large business corporations to bias this process, and there arise 'countervailing' powers in the form of trade unions, citizens' organizations and so on, to offset business's excessive advantage.EconomyProfessor.com, Retrieved 2008-08-25 On page 126 of this book, Galbraith elaborates on countervailing power in the sphere of economics when he states: > \\"The development of countervailing power requires a certain minimum > opportunity and capacity for organization, corporate or otherwise.

This would have been a formidable task but it has been > accomplished in Scandinavia where the consumer's co-operative, instead of > the chain store, is the dominant instrument of countervailing power in > consumers' goods markets.\\" Seventeenth century England was an active time for the development of countervailance theory. Although much political discourse during the period was focused on the matter of sovereignty, or absolutism for the sovereign as, for example, we observe in the writings of Thomas Hobbes, the principle \\"significance of seventeenth-century England for constitutional theory was that during this period the concept of sovereignty was replaced by the concept of checks and balances.\\" The evolution of political practice in England paralleled the evolution in theory, for it was during this period that \\"the operational dynamics of the system developed in accordance with the countervailance model of government.\\" While the trend reversed somewhat under the power of Oliver Cromwell and the era of the later Stuarts, and was therefore rather uneven over the flow of the 17th century, the Glorious Revolution of 1688 \\"firmly established the principles of dispersed power and checks and balances as the central pillars of English constitutionalism.\\"  See also  * Separation of powers References Political theories ","title":"Countervailing power"},{"id":"4998482","text":"Soul Supreme (real name David √Östr√∂m), born 1983, is a hip hop producer from Sweden.

Silverstein spent the last 36 years of his life in solitary confinement for killing Corrections Officer Merle Clutts at the Marion Penitentiary in Illinois. Prison authorities described him as a brutal killer and a former leader of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang. Silverstein maintained that the dehumanizing conditions inside the prison system contributed to the three murders he committed. He was held \\"in a specially designed cell\\" in what is called \\"Range 13\\" at ADX Florence federal penitentiary in Colorado.Supermax: A Clean Version Of Hell - 60 Minutes - CBS News He was the longest-held prisoner in solitary confinement within the Bureau of Prisons at the time of his death.‚ÄùAmerica‚Äôs Most Dangerous Prisoner?‚Äù BBC News August 2001 Early life Thomas Silverstein was born in Long Beach, California, to Virginia Conway. Conway had divorced her first husband in 1952 while pregnant with Silverstein and married Thomas Conway, who Silverstein claimed was his biological father. Four years later, Virginia divorced Conway and married Sid Silverstein, who legally adopted her son. Silverstein was timid, awkward, shy, and frequently bullied as a child in the middle-class neighborhood where the family lived, in part because his peers mistakenly believed he was Jewish. Virginia Silverstein demanded that her son fight back, telling the boy that if he ever came home again crying because he had been beaten up by a bully, she would be waiting to give him another beating. Silverstein states, \\"That's how my mom was. She stood her mud. If someone came at you with a bat, you got your bat and you both went at it.\\" At age fourteen, Silverstein was sentenced to a California Youth Authority reformatory where, he said, his attitudes about violence were reinforced. \\"Anyone not willing to fight was abused.\\" In 1971, at age nineteen, Silverstein was sent to San Quentin Prison in California for armed robbery. Four years later, he was paroled, but he was arrested soon after along with his father, Thomas Conway, and his cousin, Gerald Hoff, for three armed robberies. Their take was less than $11,000. In 1977, Silverstein was sentenced to fifteen years for armed robbery, to be served at United States Penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas.Earley, P: The Hot House Life Inside Leavenworth Prison. Bantam Books, 1993 Silverstein in a police photograph taken in 1975 after an arrest for armed robbery. Murders at USP Marion While at Leavenworth, Silverstein developed ties with the Aryan Brotherhood. In 1980, Silverstein was convicted of the murder of inmate Danny Atwell, who reportedly refused to serve as a mule for heroin being moved through the prison. He was sentenced to life without parole and transferred to the United States Penitentiary in Marion, Illinois (USP Marion), which was then a high security facility. The conviction was overturned in 1985 after it emerged that the jailhouse informants who testified at his trial had perjured themselves on the stand. At Marion, Silverstein was housed in the \\"Control Unit\\", a virtual solitary confinement regime reserved for extreme \\"management problems\\" (prisoners prone to assaultive and disruptive behavior) in the prison. In 1981, Silverstein was accused of the murder of Robert Chappelle, a member of the D.C. Blacks prison gang. Silverstein and another inmate, Clayton Fountain, were convicted and Silverstein received an additional life sentence. Silverstein maintained his innocence. While Silverstein was on trial for Chappelle's murder, the Bureau of Prisons transferred Raymond \\"Cadillac\\" Smith, the national leader of the D.C. Blacks prison gang, from another prison into the control unit in Marion. From the moment Smith arrived in the control unit, prison logs show that he began trying to kill Silverstein. \\"I tried to tell Cadillac that I didn't kill Chappelle, but he didn't believe me and he bragged that he was going to kill me,\\" Silverstein recalled. \\"Everyone knew what was going on and no one did anything to keep us apart. The guards wanted one of us to kill the other.\\" Silverstein and Clayton Fountain killed Smith with improvised weapons, stabbing him 67 times. After Smith was dead, they dragged his body up and down the catwalk in front of the cells, displaying it to other prisoners. Silverstein received another life sentence. =Murder of Correction Officer Clutts= Correction Officer Merle Clutts On October 22, 1983, Silverstein killed Correction Officer Merle Clutts at USP Marion.https://www.bop.gov/about/history/hero_clutts.jsp After being let out of his cell for a shower, Silverstein used a ruse to get Clutts to walk ahead of him and positioned himself between Clutts and other officers. He stopped outside the cell of another inmate, Randy Gometz. Gometz passed a homemade prison knife, known as a shank, to Silverstein and unlocked Silverstein's handcuffs with a homemade key. Silverstein then attacked Clutts, stabbing him several dozen times. Silverstein later claimed that he murdered Clutts in retaliation for Clutts' deliberately harassing him. Among other things, Clutts was accused of destroying paintings by Silverstein.The Hot House, inside Leavenworth. Book. A few hours later, Silverstein's friend, Clayton Fountain (also an Aryan Brotherhood member) used the same strategy to kill another correction officer, Robert Hoffmann. USP Marion was subsequently placed on an indefinite lockdown, which ultimately lasted for 23 years. Following the murder of Clutts, Silverstein was transferred to the United States Penitentiary, Atlanta, where he was placed in solitary confinement. His security status was recorded as \\"no human contact.\\" The events surrounding the murders of Correction Officers Clutts and Hoffmann inspired the design of the federal supermax prison, the United States Penitentiary, Florence ADX (USP Florence ADX) in Colorado, which opened in 1994 and was built to house the most dangerous inmates in the federal prison system. Silverstein and Gometz were both held at ADX Florence. Fountain died at the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri in 2004. Riot in Atlanta and transfer to Leavenworth During the 1987 Atlanta Prison Riots, Cuban detainees at the Atlanta federal penitentiary released Silverstein from his isolation cell. They handed Silverstein over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Hostage Rescue Team one week later. Bureau of Prisons officials were reportedly afraid that Silverstein would begin killing correctional officers held hostage by the Cubans. Before the Cubans released Silverstein to Bureau of Prisons, the Cubans let Silverstein out of his isolation cell and Silverstein was able to roam freely about the prison. One of the prison guards being held hostage had a history of being kind to Silverstein. (When the guard would handcuff Silverstein he would make it a point to ask Silverstein if his handcuffs were too tight). He was confronted by Silverstein and was ultimately spared by him. Bureau of Prisons negotiators were able to convince the Cuban riot leaders to hand over Silverstein as a gesture of good faith, a relatively easy decision for them, given that Silverstein's status was peripheral to the aims of the Cuban leaders during the riot. Silverstein was subsequently moved back to Leavenworth, where he stayed for the next 18 years. In 2005, when USP Leavenworth was downgraded to a medium-security facility, Silverstein was moved to ADX Florence, a supermax facility in Colorado. His earliest theoretical date of release was November 2, 2095. Allegations of torture and injustice Silverstein claimed that \\"no human contact\\" status is essentially a form of torture reserved for those who kill correctional officers. \\"When an inmate kills a guard, he must be punished,\\" a Bureau of Prisons official told author Pete Earley. \\"We can't execute Silverstein, so we have no choice but to make his life a living hell. Otherwise other inmates will kill guards too. There has to be some supreme punishment. Every convict knows what Silverstein is going through. We want them to realize that if they cross the same line that he did, they will pay a heavy price.\\" Ted Sellers, a former convict who met Silverstein during 25 years spent in prison, said he became a \\"legend\\" at Leavenworth. Sellers told BBC News Online, \\"He is not as bad as they portray. Sure he is dangerous if they push him to the wall. But there were some dirty rotten guards at Marion‚Ä¶ They would purposely screw you around. You are dealing with a person locked up 23 hours a day. Of course he's got a short fuse.\\" Death Silverstein died on May 11, 2019, after spending 36 years in solitary confinement; no cause was given.

A hogan ( or ; from Navajo ' ) is the primary, traditional dwelling of the Navajo people. Other traditional structures include the summer shelter, the underground home, and the sweat house. A hogan can be round, cone-shaped, multi-sided, or square; with or without internal posts; timber or stone walls and packed with earth in varying amounts or a bark roof for a summer house,Franciscan Fathers, An Ethnologic Dictionary of the Navajo Language. 1910 Saint Michaels, Arizona, reprinted 1929 by Max Breslauer; Leipzig, Germany. with the door facing east to welcome the rising sun for wealth and good fortune. Today, while some older hogans are now still used as dwellings and others are maintained for ceremonial purposes, new hogans are rarely intended as family dwellings. Traditional structured hogans are also considered pioneers of energy efficient homes. Using packed mud against the entire wood structure, the home was kept cool by natural air ventilation and water sprinkled on the dirt ground inside. During the winter the fireplace kept the inside warm well into the night. This concept is called thermal mass. Modern application and revival The preference of hogan construction and use is still very popular among the Navajos, although the use of it as a home shelter dwindled through the 1900s, due mainly to the requirement by many Navajos to acquire homes built through government and lender funding ‚Äì which largely ignored the hogan-style and cultural needs of a community ‚Äì in preference for HUD-standardized construction. Modern day hogan. Hogan at Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park With government and lender requirements requiring low costs, as well as bathrooms and kitchens, the hogan as a person's home was dwindling away, save for those who could build their own. That began to officially change in the late 1990s with various small projects to find ways to bring the hogan back. In 2001, it began changing significantly with a joint-venture of a partnership involving the Navajo Nation, Northern Arizona University, the US Forest Service and other private and public partners ‚Äì to begin manufacturing and building log hogans from a Navajo-majority owned log home factory in Cameron, Arizona, next to the Cameron Chapter House. Using surplus small-diameter wood being culled out of the Northern Arizona forests to mitigate devastating wildfires, and with a series of meetings between elders, medicine men, and project leaders ‚Äì a log hogan revival is being born on the Navajo Nation. While keeping the sacred space of the hogan relatively untouched, and also meeting the requirements for modern home amenities, an ancient tradition is now once again beginning to flourish. Along with assuring the survival of a cultural heritage, this project has also created new jobs, summer school construction experience for Navajo teens, public buildings, and much more.

He was a leading composer of operas in his native Venice in the 1660s and 1670s and was also known for composing in other genres of vocal music. Between 1665 and 1675 he spent most of his time in Hanover, where he held the post of Kapellmeister to Duke Johann Friedrich of Brunswick-L√ºneburg - returning frequently to Venice to compose operas for the Carnival. In 1676 he became vice maestro di capella at San Marco in Venice. Early work in Italy and work as Kapellmeister Duke Johann Friedrich of Brunswick-L√ºneburg Sartorio was the brother of composer and organist Gasparo Sartorio and architect Girolamo Sartorio who also had connections with the theatre. Beyond birth records, the first known information about Sartorio relates to the mounting of his first opera, Gl'amori infruttuosi di Pirro, at the Teatro di San Giovanni Grisostomo in Venice on 4 January 1661. His second opera, Seleuco, did not come until five years later when it was produced at the Teatro San Luca on 16 January 1666. The year before, he had been appointed to the position of Kapellmeister to Duke Johann Friedrich of Brunswick-L√ºneburg; just months after the duke had assumed authority over the Principality of Calenberg upon his elder brother Georg Wilhelm's inheriting of the Principality of L√ºneburg. Friedrich ruled over the Calenberg subdivision of the duchy from 1665 until his death in 1679, fourteen years later. Friedrich was a highly intelligent and educated sovereign who had converted to Roman Catholicism in 1651. Upon becoming duke, he instituted the Catholic rite to his court, which accordingly led to his choice of Sartorio, a Catholic, as Kapellmeister. The duke had met Sartorio upon one of his four visits to Italy, one of which was for the purpose of lending the Republic of Venice substantial military aid against the Turks. Sartorio began his duties as Kapellmeister on Trinity Sunday 1666 not too long after the Duke's new palace in Herrenhausen near Hanover was finished. The palace's design was inspired by the Palace of Versailles and is famous for its gardens, the Herrenhausen Gardens. As Kapellmeister, Sartorio had at his disposal six instrumentalists and seven or eight singers, the majority of which were Italian. For the group, Sartorio composed music for the Kapelle, a missa brevis, and several vesper psalms and cantatas in both the stile antico and the stile moderno. In addition, the group's repertory included masses, motets and psalms by Henri Dumont, Bonifatio Gratiani and Orazio Tarditi. Some of the group's music was discovered in 1958 in an organ bellows in the village of H√ºpede. Trips home to Venice Sartorio worked in Hanover up until 1675, during which time he returned frequently to Venice in the winter, both to compose operas for Carnival and to hire musicians for service at court. His first trip back to his native city was in 1666‚Äì1667. During this time his remarkable duo operas, La prosperit√† d'Elio Seiano and La caduta d'Elio Seiano, were produced on 15 January and 3 February 1667. Originally the librettist, Nicol√≤ Minato, had intended for the two works to be performed on successive evenings, but it appears that either Sartorio or the theatre management overturned this decision. Sartorio's second visit to Venice was for the Carnival of 1669‚Äì1670, during which his next opera, L'Ermengarda regina de' longobardi, was performed. The librettist, Pietro Dolfin, a friend of both Sartorio and Duke Johann Friedrich, administered the duke's theatre loges and corresponded regularly with him between 1669 and 1678. Sartorio‚Äôs next stay in Venice lasted an entire year, from January or February 1672 to Carnival 1672‚Äì1673. On 19 February 1672 his well known opera L'Adelaide was given for the first time. The libretto was again by Dolfin, who later reworked some of Gissilla's arias into a cantata by adding recitatives. Sartorio seems to have responded to Dolfin's wish to have the recitatives set, for a Cantata di Gissilla is extant; it was apparently conceived for a pupil of Dolfin's named Lucretia, who had sung a role in the opera, probably that of Gissilla. Sartorio was supposed to return to Hanover at the end of the season in which L'Adelaide premiered, but poor health prevented him from travelling. He was further motivated to stay by an invitation to write one of two operas to be performed at the Teatro di San Luca during the next Carnival season. The Duke assented to Sartorio's extended stay, largely because of a lengthy and persuasive correspondence by Dolfin, who expressed concerns over Sartorio's physical health and emphasized the honour of being asked to compose the opera. Sartorio thereupon offered L'Orfeo, a variation on the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice with comic interludes and elaborate sub-plots featuring such incongruous characters as Hercules, Achilles, and Thetis. This work premiered on 14 December 1672. For the theatre's second opera of the season, Francesco Cavalli was commissioned. Cavalli was then near the end of a long and successful career as an operatic composer. However, when his newest work, Massenzio, went into rehearsal, it was found unsuitable by the theatre managers \\"for lack of spirited ariettas.\\" They therefore assigned Sartorio the task of writing his own music to the same libretto just 13 days before the opera premiered on 25 January 1673. Sartorio wrote 78 arias and duets to fulfil his assignment. Later life in Italy After spending two more years in Hanover, Sartorio left the service of Duke Johann Friedrich permanently in April 1675, although he still called himself Friedrich's court composer in the manuscripts of his remaining operas and in other documents. Upon his departure, the Duke gave him a gift of 50 thalers and a golden chain. The two men remained on good terms and corresponded often with each other about negotiations with singers or visits on his behalf to cloistered ladies. Sartorio settled in Venice in 1675, taking up residence in the San Giovanni Grisostomo quarter of the city. He won the position of vice maestro di cappella of the St Mark's Basilica, narrowly defeating Carlo Grossi for the post and assuming his position there on 7 May 1676. A set of eight-part psalms for two choirs that he wrote for the basilica were published in 1680; notably being his only printed volume of music. On 17 December 1676, his opera Giulio Cesare in Egitto premiered in Venice to a resounding success. He composed four more operas between 1677 and 1679. Sartorio was supposed to have been visited by Duke Friedrich in early 1680, but the duke died on 18 December 1679 in Augsburg at the start of his fifth journey to Italy. Towards the end of 1680, Sartorio began composing another opera, La Flora, but he died before he could finish the work. He had been ill for seven months prior to his death. The Teatro San Angelo had commissioned La Flora, and not wanting to give it up, hired Marc'Antonio Ziani to finish it. The opera was eventually performed at that house as the first opera of the new Carnival season. Giovanni Legrenzi succeeded him as vice maestro di cappella of the St Mark's Basilica.

Protestant reformator Martin Luther grew up in Mansfeld, and in 1993 the town became one of sixteen places in Germany to be designated a Lutherstadt for this reason. Geography It is situated east of the Harz mountain range on the river Wipper, a left tributary of the Saale, about northwest of Halle. Together with neighbouring Eisleben, it is part of the historic Mansfeld Land region, roughly corresponding to the former district of Mansfelder Land which in 2007 merged into present Mansfeld-S√ºdharz district. Mansfeld station is a stop on the Mansfeldbahn railway line (Wipperliese), a branch of the Berlin- Blankenheim railway, running from Klostermansfeld to Wippra. =Town districts= The township currently comprises 15 districts (Ortschaften): {  valign=\\"top\\"  * Abberode * Annarode * Biesenrode * Braunschwende * Friesdorf  valign=\\"top\\"  * Gorenzen * Gro√ü√∂rner * Hermerode * Mansfeld proper * M√∂llendorf  valign=\\"top\\"  * Molmerswende * Piskaborn * Ritzgerode * Siebigerode * Vatterode } History The House of Mansfeld, whose members belonged to the Saxon nobility and served as counts in the Hassegau, was first documented in a 973 deed. The counts built Mansfeld Castle, whose foundations date back to the late 11th century, when one Hoyer of Mansfeld served as field marshal to Emperor Henry V. The first reference of the fortress coincides with the extinction of the elder line in 1229. The estates were inherited by the Lords of Querfurt, who also adopted the comital title, calling themselves Counts of Mansfeld from that time on. Mansfeld town and castle, 1650 engraving by Matth√§us Merian The settlement of Mansfeld received town privileges in 1400, and grew through the development of copper and silver mining, an activity in which Hans Luder from M√∂hra, father to Martin Luther and Mansfeld citizen from 1484, was employed as a master smelter. Luther's family had arrived into a modest prosperity, he himself attended the local school between 1488 and 1496. The building known as \\"Luther's School\\" had to be torn down and rebuilt in 2000 due to structural problems. His parents' house is preserved and today a museum. Luther also acted as an altar server at the St George parish church. The Counts of Mansfeld had already lost Imperial immediacy in 1580.

Arae (abbreviated to 41 G. Ara), also known as GJ 666, is a trinary star system in the constellation Ara. Although often called just 41 Arae, it is more accurate to call it 41 G. Arae, as the number 41 is the Gould designation (Flamsteed only covered the northern hemisphere). The primary star in this system is a G-type main sequence star with a stellar classification of G8V. It has about 81% of the mass of the Sun, and 79% of the Sun's radius. The fainter member of the pair, a red dwarf, has a peculiar spectrum that shows a deficiency in elements with a higher atomic number than Helium. No planetary companions have been detected in orbit around these stars. The two stars share a highly elliptical orbit that takes several centuries to complete. The estimates of the period range from 693 to 2,200 years, and the average separation of the two stars is about 210 AUs (or 210 times the average distance between the Earth and the Sun). 41 G. Arae is most likely a triple, comprising the following components: Gliese 666A supposed as a spectroscopic binary, and Gliese 666B as its companion. Two other visual companions were proposed, but neither share the system's motion. This system has a relatively high proper motion, moving over a second of arc across the sky each year. The space velocity components of this system are = . The stars in this system show low chromospheric activity, and have a net space velocity of 52 km/s relative to the Sun. This, in combination with their low metallicity, shows that the pair belongs to the old disk population. See also * List of star systems within 25‚Äì30 light-years References External links * 41 G.

In the 1970s and 80's he used explosives to destroy various propaganda symbols of communism and distributed anti-communist leaflets; he got caught and was tried four times, received various forms of punishment including imprisonment; he served a grand total of 40 months in prison. After his release from prison in 1987 he signed the Charter 77 proclamation. Even when he wasn't imprisoned he suffered extensive discrimination from the Czech communist authorities and their Secret Police (StB). He was eventually rehabilitated of all the communist era convictions and they were rendered null and void. After the so-called Velvet Revolution of 1989 he worked in the Civic Commissions (these were administering clearances to the members of the ordinary Police force) and later was nominated by the Confederation of Political Prisoners to work at the Security Information Service (BIS), a Czech intelligence agency and once admitted there, he achieved a rank of Captain and was regarded as one of its best officers. In 2001, when he came to the conclusion that an ultra-left wingers of the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia were behind several unsolved explosions that took place in his home town of Prerov (of which he is an honorary citizen), he was fired from BIS and soon after that arrested and imprisoned on 7 unsubstantiated charges. He was held in custody only few days short of a year and spent a portion of that time in a psychiatric hospital. In spite of numerous requests the then-president V√°clav Havel refused to look into the matter and grant him clemency, even though Havel was well known for his extensive use of clemency while in office. On the other hand, in 2001 Havel pardoned Huƒç√≠n's mother, accused of illegal possession of firearms. Similarly several petitions with thousands of signatures to the Czech Senate went unheeded. Huƒç√≠n's trial ran for five years without public being admitted into the court room (on pretense that the court was dealing with classified materials) and on one occasion even being ejected by a brutal force from the court house. In November 2005 he was acquitted of all charges, an appellate court confirmed the verdict on April 21. 2006 in Olomouc. During those 5 years, while out of the custody, he could not find any work because prospective employers feared the persecution by the authorities. After he was acquitted, there was no compensation or even an apology coming to Vladimir Huƒç√≠n from the Czech Republic or BIS for his wrongful imprisonment. Any documents related to his case are effectively closed to the public (as well as to himself) and even Parliamentary Security Commission was not allowed to see them by the BIS. Vladim√≠r Huƒç√≠n tried (unsuccessfully) for a seat in the Senate in 2006 and again in 2008. Through his website and through the interviews with the media Vladim√≠r Huƒç√≠n continues to point out the persons he deems unfit for their public office. He co-authored two books which describe his ordeal, \\"Nen√≠ to o mnƒõ ale o n√°s\\" (It's about us, not about me) and \\"Hrdin≈Øm se nedƒõkuje\\" (Heroes don't receive thanks); especially the first one is a plentiful source of information about him and his work.

Written while Gabrieli was the organist at St Mark's Basilica, Venice, the music was designed to be performed in this unique building. The individual groups of musicians and singers would have been spatially separated around the grand architecture creating a polychoral, antiphonal texture that is difficult to replicate in modern performances.

The piece mainly uses simple chords (I, IV and V), but the use of suspensions, consonant fourths, passing notes, and other sophisticated uses of dissonance create points of tension and excitement. The work is usually scored in A minor but the lack of the G# gives the modal (Aeolian) tonality. Many phrases end with a Tierce de Picardie where the music will end with an A major chord.

His father, Stephen the Posthumous, was the posthumous son of Andrew II of Hungary although Stephen's brothers considered him a bastard. Andrew grew up in Venice, and first arrived in Hungary upon the invitation of a rebellious baron, Ivan K≈ëszegi, in 1278. K≈ëszegi tried to play Andrew off against Ladislaus IV of Hungary, but the conspiracy collapsed and Andrew returned to Venice. Being the last male member of the House of √Årp√°d, Andrew was elected king after the death of King Ladislaus IV in 1290. He was the first Hungarian monarch to issue a coronation diploma confirming the privileges of the noblemen and the clergy. At least three pretenders‚ÄîAlbert of Austria, Mary of Hungary, and an adventurer‚Äîchallenged his claim to the throne. Andrew expelled the adventurer from Hungary and forced Albert of Austria to conclude a peace within a year, but Mary of Hungary and her descendants did not renounce their claim. The Hungarian bishops and Andrew's maternal family from Venice were his principal supporters, but the leading Croatian and Slavonian lords were opposed to his rule. Hungary was in a state of constant anarchy during Andrew's reign. The K≈ëszegis, the Cs√°ks, and other powerful families autonomously governed their domains, rising up nearly every year in open rebellion against Andrew. With Andrew's death, the House of √Årp√°d became extinct. A civil war ensued which lasted for more than two decades and ended with the victory of Mary of Hungary's grandson, Charles Robert. Childhood ( 1265‚Äì1278) Andrew was the son of Stephen the Posthumous, the self-styled Duke of Slavonia, and his second wife, Tomasina Morosini. Andrew's father was born to Beatrice D'Este, the third wife of Andrew II of Hungary, after the king's death. However, Andrew II's two elder sons, B√©la IV of Hungary and Coloman of Halych, accused Beatrice D'Este of adultery and refused to acknowledge Stephen the Posthumous as their legitimate brother. Andrew's mother, Tomasina Morosini, was the daughter of wealthy Venetian patrician Michele Morosini. The exact date of Andrew's birth is unknown. According to historians Tibor Alm√°si, Gyula Krist√≥, and Attila Zsoldos, he was born in about 1265. Stephen the Posthumous nominated his wife's two kinsmen, including her brother Albertino Morosini, as Andrew's guardians before his death in 1272. Pretender (1278‚Äì1290) Andrew is brought to Hungary from Venice to fight against King Ladislaus the Cuman (from the Illuminated Chronicle) Andrew came to Hungary for the first time in 1278 at the invitation of a powerful lord, Ivan K≈ëszegi. K≈ëszegi wanted to play Andrew off against Ladislaus IV of Hungary. Andrew, who was the only male member of the royal family besides the king, adopted the title of \\"Duke of Slavonia, Dalmatia and Croatia\\" and marched as far as Lake Balaton. Andrew achieved nothing, however, and went back to Venice in autumn. Andrew returned to Hungary at the beginning of 1290. On this occasion, Lodomer, Archbishop of Esztergom, also urged him to come, since the archbishop wanted to dethrone the excommunicated Ladislaus IV with the assistance of Ivan K≈ëszegi. Before Andrew was successful, Arnold Hah√≥t, an enemy of the K≈ëszegis, invited him to the fort of ≈†trigova and captured him. Hah√≥t sent Andrew to Vienna, where Albert I, Duke of Austria, held him in captivity. Three Cuman assassins murdered Ladislaus IV on 10 July 1290, and Archbishop Lodomer subsequently dispatched two monks to Vienna to inform Andrew of the king's death. With the monks' assistance, Andrew left his prison in disguise and hastened to Hungary. Reign =Coronation and pretenders (1290‚Äì1293)= Upon Andrew's arrival, his opponents tried to bribe Theodore Tengerdi, Provost of the Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r Chapter, not to hand over the Holy Crown of Hungary to the soon-to-be-king, but the prior refused them. Archbishop Lodomer crowned Andrew king in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r on 23 July. The lords and prelates swore loyalty to Andrew only after he issued a charter promising the restoration of internal peace and respect for the privileges of the nobility and the clergymen. He then appointed the most powerful noblemen, who had for years administered their domains independently of the monarch, to the highest offices. Amadeus Aba, who dominated the northeastern parts of the kingdom, was made palatine, Ivan K≈ëszegi, the lord of the western parts of Transdanubia, became master of the treasury, and Roland Borsa remained the voivode of Transylvania. Andrew held a diet before 1 September. To put an end to anarchy, the \\"prelates, barons and noblemen\\" ordered the destruction of castles which had been erected without royal permission and the restoration of estates that had been unlawfully seized to their rightful owners. Andrew promised that he would hold a diet each year during his reign. Andrew's royal seal There were several other challengers to Andrew's claim to the throne. Rudolf I of Germany claimed that Hungary escheated to him after Ladislaus IV's childless death, because Ladislaus IV's grandfather, B√©la IV of Hungary, had sworn fidelity to Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor during the Mongol invasion of Hungary. Although Pope Innocent IV had years before freed B√©la IV of his oath, Rudolf I of Germany attempted to bestow Hungary on his own son, Albert of Austria, on 31 August. The self-declared \\"Andrew, Duke of Slavonia\\"‚Äîan adventurer who claimed to be identical to Ladislaus IV's dead younger brother‚Äîalso challenged King Andrew's right to the crown and stormed into Hungary from Poland. He was shortly thereafter forced to return to Poland, where he was murdered. Andrew married Fenenna, the daughter of Ziemomys≈Ç of Kuyavia, before the end of 1290. Andrew then held a general assembly for the barons and the noblemen of five counties to the east of the river Tisza‚ÄîBihar, Kraszna, Szabolcs, Szatm√°r, and Szolnok‚Äîat Nagyv√°rad (Oradea) in early 1291. The assembly outlawed Stephen Balogsemj√©n, a staunch supporter of the late Ladislaus IV, for major trespass. From the assembly, Andrew went to Gyulafeh√©rv√°r (Alba Iulia). Here he issued the decrees of his 1290 diet at the assembly of the local noblemen, Saxons, Sz√©kelys and Romanians, in February or March. Around the same time, Andrew dismissed Amadeus Aba and made Ivan K≈ëszegi palatine. Ladislaus IV's sister Mary, wife of Charles II of Naples, announced her claim to the throne in April 1291. The Baboniƒái, Frankopans, ≈†ubiƒái, and other leading Croatian and Slavonian noble families accepted her as the lawful monarch. Andrew's main concern, however, was Albert of Austria's claim. He invaded Austria, forcing Albert to withdraw his garrisons from the towns and fortresses‚Äîincluding Pressburg (Bratislava) and Sopron‚Äîthat he had captured years before, many of which were held by the K≈ëszegis before their conquest. The Peace of Hainburg, which concluded the war, was signed on 26 August, and three days later Andrew and Albert of Austria confirmed it at their meeting in K√∂pcs√©ny (Kopƒçany). The peace treaty prescribed the destruction of the fortresses that Albert of Austria had seized from the K≈ëszegis. The K≈ëszegis rose up in open rebellion against Andrew in spring 1292, acknowledging Mary's son, Charles Martel, as King of Hungary. The royal troops subdued the rebellion by July, but the K≈ëszegis captured and imprisoned Andrew during his journey to Slavonia in August. Andrew was liberated within four months, after his supporters sent their relatives as hostages to the K≈ëszegis. =Rebellions and attempts to consolidate (1293‚Äì1298)= Upon Andrew's request, his mother, Tomasina, moved to Hungary in 1293. Andrew appointed her to administer Croatia, Dalmatia, and Slavonia. Due to her activities, the Baboniƒái, ≈†ubiƒái, and the Dalmatian towns acknowledged Andrew's rule. Andrew visited the northern parts of Hungary and ordered the revision of former land grants in February. After his return to Buda, he again made Amadeus Aba palatine. In August, Andrew arranged a marriage between his cousin, Constance Morosini, and Vladislav, son of Stefan Dragutin of Serbia, who had earlier acknowledged Charles Martel's claim to Hungary. Andrew's denarius Roland Borsa besieged and captured Benedict, Bishop of V√°rad's fortress at Fenes (Fini»ô) on 23 May 1294. Andrew held a general assembly and outlawed Borsa. According to historian Attila Zsoldos, he made Nicholas K≈ëszegi palatine on this occasion. Andrew laid siege to Borsa's fort at Adorj√°n (Adrian). The siege lasted three months before the fort fell to Andrew in October. Andrew replaced Roland Borsa with Ladislaus III K√°n as voivode of Transylvania, but the former preserved all his domains in the lands east of the Tisza. The Croatian lord Paul ≈†ubiƒá again turned against Andrew and joined the camp of Charles Martel in early 1295, but Charles died in August. Within two months, the Baboniƒái also rebelled against Andrew. Early the next year, the recently widowed King Andrew visited Vienna and arranged a marriage with Duke Albert's daughter Agnes. The K≈ëszegis soon rose up in open rebellion. Andrew declared war on the rebels, and Archbishop Lodomer excommunicated them. Andrew and Albert jointly seized the K≈ëszegis' main fort at K≈ëszeg in October, but could not subdue them. Andrew's mother seems to have died at the end of the year because references to her activities disappear from the contemporaneous documents. Matthew III Cs√°k, whom Andrew had made palatine in 1296, turned against Andrew at the end of 1297. Andrew's staunch supporter, Archbishop Lodomer, died around the same time. In early February 1298, Andrew visited Albert of Austria in Vienna and promised to support him against Adolf of Nassau, King of Germany. Andrew sent an auxiliary troop, and Albert of Austria routed King Adolf in the Battle of G√∂llheim on 2 July. =Last years (1298‚Äì1301)= oligarchs\\" (powerful lords) in the early 14th century Andrew held an assembly of the prelates, noblemen, Saxons, Sz√©kelys, and Cumans in Pest in the summer of 1298. The preamble to the decrees that were passed at the diet mentioned \\"the laxity of the lord king\\". The decrees authorized Andrew to destroy forts built without permission and ordered the punishment of those who had seized landed property with force, but also threatened Andrew with excommunication if he did not apply the decrees. At the gathering, he appointed his uncle, Albertino Morosini, Duke of Slavonia. After the close of the diet, Andrew entered into a formal alliance with five influential noblemen ‚Äì Amadeus Aba, Stephen √Åkos, Dominic R√°t√≥t, Demetrius Balassa and Paul Sz√©cs ‚Äì who stated that they were willing to support him against the Pope and the bishops. Gregory Bicskei, the Archbishop-elect and Apostolic Administrator of Esztergom, forbade the prelates to participate at a new diet which was held in 1299. The prelates ignored the archbishop's order and Andrew deprived him of Esztergom County. A group of powerful lords‚Äîincluding the ≈†ubiƒái, K≈ëszegis and Cs√°ks‚Äîurged Charles II of Naples to send his grandson, the 12-year-old Charles Robert, to Hungary in order to become king. The young Charles Robert disembarked in Split in August 1300. Most Croatian and Slavonian lords and all Dalmatian towns but Trogir recognized him as king before he marched to Zagreb. The K≈ëszegis and Matthew Cs√°k, however, were shortly reconciled with Andrew, preventing Charles' success. Andrew's envoy to the Holy See noted that Pope Boniface VIII did not support Charles Robert's adventure, either. Andrew, who had been in poor health for a while, was planning to capture his opponent, but he died in Buda Castle on 14 January 1301. According to historians Attila Zsoldos and Gyula Krist√≥, the contemporaneous gossip suggesting that Andrew was poisoned cannot be proved. Andrew was buried in the Franciscan church in Buda. Years later, Palatine Stephen √Åkos referred to Andrew as the \\"last golden branch\\" of the tree of King Saint Stephen's family, because with Andrew's death the House of √Årp√°d, the first royal dynasty of Hungary, ended. A civil war between various claimants to the throne‚ÄîCharles Robert, Wenceslaus of Bohemia, and Otto of Bavaria‚Äîfollowed Andrew's death and lasted for seven years. The civil war ended with Charles Robert's victory, but he was forced to continue fighting against the K≈ëszegis, the Abas, Matthew Cs√°k, and other powerful lords up to the early 1320s. Family Andrew's first wife, Fenenna of Kuyavia (d. 1295), gave birth to a daughter, Elizabeth, in 1291 or 1292. Elizabeth became engaged to Wenceslaus, the heir to Wenceslaus II of Bohemia, in 1298, but the betrothal was broken in 1305. She joined the Dominican convent at T√∂ss where she died a nun on 5 May 1338. She is now venerated as Blessed Elizabeth of T√∂ss. Andrew's second wife, Agnes of Austria, was born in 1280. She survived her husband, but did not marry again; she died in the K√∂nigsfelden Monastery of the Poor Clares in 1364.

God replies to Moses that the time will come when Pharaoh himself will actually drive the Israelites out of Egypt; and that on behalf of his covenant with the Patriarchs, God will redeem the Israelites \\"with a strong hand and an outstretched arm\\", so that they will know him.

In the case of bricks in Old Testament Egypt -- river clay is usually composed of very fine particles and so would dry slowly -- adding straw would \\"open up\\" the clay, allowing it to dry more readily in the sun. In addition to aiding in drying, the linear nature of straw adds stability to the clay brick in much the same way that rebar or wire mesh reinforce modern day concrete. Bricks made without straw would break and crumble easily. Adobe bricks used around the world are generally only sun dried but grasses, straw and other materials are added to the clay for the same basic reasons.

In 1174 it was one of the casalia (villages) given to Phillipe le Rous.Strehlke, 1869, p. 8, No. 7; cited in R√∂hricht, 1893, RHH, p. 137, No. 517; cited in Ellenblum, 2003, p. 109, note 16 and Frankel, 1988, p. 255 In 1236 descendants of Phillipe le Rous confirmed the sale of the fief of Deir Henna.Strehlke, 1869, p. 64, No.81; cited R√∂hricht, 1893, RHH, p. 269, No. 1069; cited in Frankel, 1988, p. 265 According to architectural researcher Andrew Petersen, no traces of Crusader occupation were found in the village.Petersen, 2001, p. 132 =Ottoman era= The remains of the Zaydani mosque and fortress of Deir Hanna, built by Sa'd el-Omar, the brother of Zahir al-Umar Deir Hanna became a base for the ZaydƒÅnƒ´ family in the 18th century, and thus its importance grew with Zahir al-Umar's rise to power during that time. In the early to mid-18th century, Zahir gave his elder brother, Sa'd el-Omar, control of the village and nearby Arraba.Philipp, 2013, p. 33 The two villages served as the rural stronghold of the Zaydani family, and before taking the port town of Acre, Zahir resided in Deir Hanna and used it as his principal base of operations. Sa'd commissioned the construction of most of Deir Hanna's fortifications and in 1732-33, he built its mosque.Sharon, 2004, pp. 56-57. When Sa'd died in 1767, Zahir's son Ali requested control over the village, but Zahir refused, earning him Ali's resentment.Joudah, 1987, pp. 53-54. Following Zahir's defeat and death at the hands of the Ottoman military in 1775, Ali al-Zahir took over Deir Hanna. The Ottoman governor Jezzar Pasha launched a military campaign against Zahir's sons and besieged Deir Hanna. The strength of the village fortress allowed Ali to withstand the siege for several months until Jezzar received reinforcements from the Kapudan Hasan Pasha in July 1776. With the siege intensifying, Ali managed to escape the village and seek safety in Mount Lebanon, settling in the village of Niha. On 22 July, heavy damage to the fort by Ottoman cannon fire forced the remaining defenders to surrender. The surviving defenders of Deir Hanna were expelled from the village with their families by Jezzar, who subsequently demolished large parts of the village's fortress. Sa'd el-Omar is credited with the construction of the village fort's high inner walls, which at the time had 12 towers. Zahir is credited with the construction of the outer walls, while Ali al-Zahir had two towers built off of the eastern and western sides of the fort. Both of the latter towers were separated from the fortress and were meant to serve as additional protection in the event of a siege.Sharon, 2004, p. 57 The Zaydani mosque of Deir Hanna, before its destruction in 1776, had been the \\"most famous of all the Zaydani's buildings in the Galilee\\", according to historian Moshe Sharon.Sharon, 2004, p. 58 Local tradition claims that the mosque was built on top of an older Crusader-era church and that Jezzar Pasha had been so impressed by Sa'd's mosque, that he copied its design for his namesake mosque in Acre. Local peasants re-inhabited Deir Hanna sometime after Jezzar's assault, but the village did not recover its prominence and no longer posed a threat to Ottoman authority.Orser, 1996, p. 465 In 1838, Deir Hanna was noted as a Christian and Muslim village in the Esh-Shagur district, located between Safad, Acca and Tiberias.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol. 3, 2nd appendix, p. 133 In 1875 Victor Gu√©rin found 40 Muslim and four Greek Orthodox Christian families living in Deir Hanna.Gu√©rin, 1880, pp. 463 -464 In 1881, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described the village and the building works of the Zahir al-Umar era as: \\"High walls all around the village, which is built of stone. The walls have round towers ...\\" It is situated on the top of a high ridge, and contains about 400 Christians. It is surrounded by olive-groves and arable land. Water is obtained from cisterns and an old paved birkeh [pool] to the north of the village.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 364 A population list from about 1887 showed that Deir Hanna had about 365 inhabitants; 280 Muslims and 85 Catholic Christians.Schumacher, 1888, p. 174 =British Mandate period= The church at Deir Hanna, 2012 In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Dair Hanna had a population of 429; 320 Muslims and 109 Christians,Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub-district of Acre, p. 37 where all the Christians were Orthodox.Barron, 1923, Table XVI, p. 50 By the 1931 census the population had increased to 563; 427 Muslims and 136 Christians, in a total of 117 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 100 In the 1945 statistics, it had 750 Arab inhabitants; 540 Muslims and 210 Christians,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics, 1945, p. 4 with a total of 15,350 dunams of land.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics.

Many of the inhabitants fled north but some stayed and were not expelled by the Israeli soldiers.Morris, 1987, p. 226 Deir Hanna remained under Martial Law until 1966. Deir Hanna forms the Land Day triangle with Sakhnin and Arraba. The town has been through a thorough modernization process in the last 10 years, and now has a full education system, health care facilities and sports playgrounds. Landmarks Deir Hanna has a castle from the Zahir al- Umar era. Parts of the castle are still standing, as are the town walls, the old village church and a mosque, and it is considered a tourist attraction.

A population was eradicated when the volcano erupted around 1840 and pyroclastic flows swept all sides of the island.

Here is a detailed explanation of the names used for Transnistria, both official and unofficial, as they appear in the local languages and in English. Official names, long Transnistria has three official languages: Russian, Moldavian (in the Cyrillic alphabet), and Ukrainian. In each of the three national languages the name reads: *Russian: –ü—Ä–∏–¥–Ω–µ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤—Å–∫–∞—è –ú–æ–ª–¥–∞–≤—Å–∫–∞—è –†–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∞ (Pridnestrovskaya Moldavskaya Respublika), abbreviated –ü–ú–† *Moldavian Cyrillic: –†–µ–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–∞ –ú–æ–ª–¥–æ–≤–µ–Ω—è—Å–∫—ç –ù–∏—Å—Ç—Ä—è–Ω—ç (Republica MoldoveneascƒÉ NistreanƒÉ), abbreviated –†–ú–ù *Ukrainian: –ü—Ä–∏–¥–Ω—ñ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤—Å—å–∫–∞ –ú–æ–ª–¥–∞–≤—Å—å–∫–∞ –†–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª—ñ–∫–∞ (Prydnistrovs'ka Moldavs'ka Respublika), abbreviated –ü–ú–† The abbreviations of each name in the official languages also appear on the Transnistrian coat of arms. The Constitution of Transnistria gives the official name as Pridnestrovskaia Moldavskaia Respublica (PMR).See Constitution Some authorities, such as the President's office, translate this name to English as the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic. The official abbreviation in English is PMR. Official names, short The official shortform name (the name in daily usage) in Russian is \\"–ü—Ä–∏–¥–Ω–µ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤—å–µ\\", Pridnestrovie, which literally means \\"Cisdniestria\\". Short name in Romanian Nistrenia (–ù–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–µ–Ω—è in Cyrillic), in Ukrainian –ü—Ä–∏–¥–Ω—ñ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–≤'—è - Prydnistrovya. The PMR government favours not to translate the country name when written in English.What's in a name: \\"Pridnestrovie\\" vs \\"Transnistria\\" Per a 2000 presidential naming decree, the official transliteration in Latin script is Pridnestrovie. Other names in use In Russian, the names used for Transnistria are always consistently either Pridnestrovskaia Moldavskaia Respublica or Pridnestrovie (the two official names, long- and short- respectively). However, in English a wide variety of names have been used to describe the region, among them: Trans- Dniester, Transdnistria, Transdniestria, Transdniestr, Trans-Dniestria, Transdniester, Transniestria, Transdnestr, also Trans-Dnjestr and Trans- Dnjester. The government of Moldova refers to the region St√Ænga Nistrului, which means \\"Left Bank of the Dniester\\" although in the Moldavian Latin script, the official name is Republica MoldoveneascƒÉ NistreanƒÉ (which translates to English as \\"Nistrian Moldavian Republic\\"). The European Court of Human Rights used the name Moldavian Republic of Transdniestria or Moldovan Republic of Transnistria (MRT), while Organization for Security and Co- operation in Europe and others sometimes refer to it as the Transnistrian Moldovan Republic (TMR). Author Charles King, in his book The Moldovans, uses the names Dnestr Republic and Dnestr Moldovan Republic (DMR). Naming background All of the names cited above have their root in the name of the river Dniester. In Romanian/Moldavian, the river is known as Nistru. The name \\"Transnistria\\" is Romanian/Moldavian and literally means \\"beyond the river Dniester\\". The name has been in use in Romania as early as 1924, but it was popularized internationally during World War II. Therefore, this name is very offensive to the locals. In both Russian and Ukrainian, the name has a more literal meaning as it is called \\"Cisdniestria\\" which means \\"On this side of the Dniester\\", \\"By-The-Dniester\\" or \\"On-The-Dniester\\" (as opposed to beyond the Dniester).

The state park features Forrest Lake and Native American petroglyphs. History In 1950, the nearby city of Kirksville was in need of a larger and more reliable water supply than the Chariton River could provide. Following voter passage of a special bond issue, land was acquired to construct a dam across Big Creek, a tributary of the Chariton.We Would Just Like To Say Thank You by Chris Sieren & David Snyder, The Chariton Collector, Spring 1984 Upon completion in summer 1952, the new body of water was named Forrest Lake in honor of Missouri Governor Forrest Smith. The family of local physician George Laughlin donated surrounding the lake for the establishment of a recreation area. The city of Kirksville matched the donation by purchasing an additional . The lands were presented to the state of Missouri free of charge in return for the promise of establishing a state park. Upon its official dedication in July 1953, it was named Thousand Hills State Park, in honor of Doctor Laughlin's Thousand Hills Farm that had formerly occupied the land.A Book of Adair County History, Published by the Kirksville-Adair County Bicentennial Committee, 1976 Petroglyphs A series of Native American rock carvings, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, are protected in an enclosed observation and interpretation center. The carvings are estimated to date back at least 1,500 years. Activities and amenities The park's lake is used for fishing, swimming, and both motorized and non-motorized boating. A marina offers boat and equipment rentals. Two campgrounds provide a total of 57 campsites. Overnight accommodations are also offered at seven duplex cabins.

It is the first Sonic game developed by Backbone Entertainment, for the PlayStation Portable. The game was also supervised by members of Sega Studio USA including Takashi Iizuka. One year later, in 2007, a sequel called Sonic Rivals 2 was developed by the same company for the same platform. Gameplay Sonic Rivals is a side-scrolling video game similar to the original Sonic the Hedgehog games for the Sega Genesis, but with a 2.5D perspective. Characters race to the finish line while avoiding the level's obstacles. The game contains six zones, each with three respective acts, the third being a boss battle, totaling in 17 stages. Boss battles at the end of levels require the player to defeat the boss before the competing character does. Five different characters are playable; Sonic the Hedgehog, Knuckles the Echidna, Shadow the Hedgehog, Silver the Hedgehog, and Metal Sonic, but gameplay is identical for all characters. The game features power-ups to collect that offer additional offensive and defensive abilities. Sonic Rivals features several different modes. In Story Mode, each of the four playable characters have separate story lines, and must race each other to the finish line in each stage in order to thwart Doctor Eggman's various schemes. In Challenge Mode, the player is given a goal to complete, such as hitting your opponent a certain number of times during a race or battle. Wireless Play Mode features multiplayer games and races whereby players can wager cards, or just race for fun. It is played ad hoc, and players can customize their racers using collectible cards won in Single player, trade cards with friends, and wager cards on races. Also a cup circuit mode is available where players race a rival for the chance to win a specific cup. The game includes an extensive collectible card system that spans a total of 150 cards. Performing specific objectives throughout the game will give the player a collectible cards. Such tasks include finishing a level, getting a certain number of rings, hitting your rival a certain number of times and getting to the goal within a certain amount of time. The cards themselves feature pictures of characters and boxart from a variety of past games in the Sonic series. The cards themselves are used to unlock secret costumes and items that alter the appearance of the characters. While they add a customizable aspect to the game, they are merely aesthetic; they do not affect gameplay. Plot When the mysterious Onyx Island appears out of nowhere, Sonic and Tails fly there to investigate. They confront Doctor Eggman, who reveals his latest device: a camera which can turn people and things into cards, having already done so to Amy. He turns Tails into a card just as Knuckles arrives, angry at Eggman for using his device on the Master Emerald as well. Eggman announces his plan to conquer the world by turning everything to cards, challenging Sonic and Knuckles to stop him as he flees. The two heroes both set out independently to stop his plan. Elsewhere, Shadow receives a distress signal from Eggman, but upon finding him, the doctor denies sending one. He later receives a communication from Rouge warning him she has stumbled upon a dangerous secret about Eggman, but she is turned to a card before she can continue. Suddenly, Silver appears from the future, and tells Shadow he needs to get to Eggman first. After numerous conflicts, the heroes discover that Dr. Eggman had been imprisoned in a card before everything began, and that the Eggman the heroes have been interacting with is Eggman Nega in disguise. Nega is revealed to have traveled back from the future, plotting to use the camera to remove Eggman's failed schemes from existence and rewrite their family history, with Onyx Island being a future version of Angel Island he brought back to further his plan. His ruse exposed, Nega escapes into space, planning to use his camera to turn the whole planet into a card. The heroes rescue Tails and the real Eggman, who aid them in reaching Nega's space station to stop his plan. After a final battle with the heroes, Nega is defeated and captured in a card. The prisoners of the other cards are restored, and Silver takes Onyx Island and Nega's card with him back to the future. Development and release Sonic Rivals was developed as a collaborative effort between Sega and Backbone Entertainment for the PlayStation Portable (PSP). The game's concept originated from a traditional platform game Backbone designed. Takashi Iizuka became involved with the game, and he changed its direction to a racing game. The majority of development was handled by Backbone with assistance from Sega Studio USA, although some aspects, such as the story, were done by Sega. The developers chose to create the game on the PSP over the Nintendo DS, due to its stronger processing power and higher graphical quality. According to producer Taylor Miller, the goal of the developers was to return to the gameplay style of the original Sega Genesis Sonic games, but with new elements such as competition. In designing the stages, Sega provided Backbone with level design maps from all the 2D games as a reference, and Backbone looked to all games up to Sonic Rush for inspiration. Building alternate paths‚Äîa common feature of the original games‚Äîwas cited as challenging, with the goal of allowing as many rivalry interactions as possible. In choosing playable characters, Backbone focused on characters who maintained the biggest rivalries in the Sonic franchise, such as Sonic and Shadow. Silver, then a new character, was added to \\"mix things up\\". One challenge was coming up with the art direction for the game; Backbone sought to maintain the look and feel of Sonic while still stylizing the game to stand out. Kazuyuki Hoshino and Hiroshi Nishiyama assisted with art and environment direction, respectively. The game's existence was revealed on GameStop's website in May 2005, though Sega denied it was in development. Sonic Rivals was announced on May 6, 2006. It was showcased at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) later that month, and at the Games Convention in August 2006. The game was released in North America on November 17, 2006, and Europe on December 1, 2006. Reception Sonic Rivals received mixed reviews from critics. It received a score of 66.17% on GameRankings and 64/100 on Metacritic. IGN praised the graphics, sense of speed, and multiplayer mode, but criticized the game's controls and some level designs. Similarly, GameSpot called it \\"fast and fun\\", but did not like the \\"trial and error\\" based gameplay needed due to the level designs.

The stated goal of both NVSL and NVSL-Dive is \\"...to develop in the children participating in its program‚Äîa love for the sport, advanced aquatic skills, teamwork, and the principles of good sportsmanship.\\" More than 15,000 children participate in the League's programs. NVSL-Swim The Northern Virginia Swimming League (NVSL) currently consists of 102 teams divided into 17 divisions, with six teams in each division. The official website is www.mynvsl.com. For 2014, approximately 17,000 children participate in the NVSL. The league's motto is to promote \\"A love for the sport, advanced aquatic skills, teamwork, and the principles of good sportsmanship.\\" Each team participates in five dual meets. There are five age groups for both boys and girls: 8&U;, 9-10, 11-12, 13-14, and 15-18. Swimmers compete in freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke and butterfly individual events; in freestyle relays for the 8&U; age group, and in medley relays for all other age groups; and in mixed age relays one each for boys and girls, for a total 52 events in a dual meet. NVSL-Swimming Individual All-Stars The NVSL Individual All-Stars swim meet is a competition between select swimmers in each age group and event. The races consist of swimmers with the top 18 times league-wide, with two alternate swimmers in case one or more scheduled swimmers are not present. Cards are pulled for additional swimmers in case either of the alternates or multiple scratches are made. While most NVSL meets are focused on team competition, the Individual All-Stars meet is more oriented toward the league's best individual swimmers. There is also an All-Star Relay Carnival meet for the 18 top relays league-wide based on performance at each Division Relay Carnival held the week before. The relay carnivals are held earlier in the season on Wednesday evenings. The NVSL Individual All-Stars meet is held on the first Saturday in August. There is no team score for this meet. However, the NVSL All-Star Relay Carnival is a scored team meet, and a winner is determined by total points at the end of the meet. In addition to the five dual meets for each team, the NVSL also schedules a Division Relay Carnival for each division, its All-Star Relay Carnival, Division Individual Championship meets for each division and Individual All-Stars. NVSL-Dive Beginning in 1957, NVSL-Dive began sponsoring dive competition in Northern Virginia. The teams are sponsored by local community pools with diving boards. NVSL-Dive is currently composed of 47 teams that are divided into 8 divisions. The teams compete weekly over the course of a 5 week season, and a team is named the division champion. Meets are held on Tuesday evenings from late June through late July. In a dual meet, each team is allowed a total of 32 divers. Following the conclusion of the regular season, each division holds an Individual Division Championship, which is used to qualify for the League's Individual All-Star Championship Meet, which is typically held the first Sunday in August. Divers are divided by gender into four age categories: Freshmen (10 & under - 3 dives), Juniors (11-12 - 4 dives), Intermediates (13-14 - 5 dives), and Seniors (15 and older - 6 dives). The category is determined by the diver's age on June 1 of each year. Divers are allowed to compete through the summer following their graduation from high school NVSL- Dive championships NVSL-Dive hosts the annual Cracker Jack Invitational. This meet is the world's largest one-day diving competition. At the 2009 meet, which was hosted by Truro in Annandale, Virginia, 354 divers (218 girls and 136 boys) competed. Established in 1987 to provide a skill-appropriate championship for beginning divers. The first Cracker Jack Invitational was held at Freedom Park and attracted approximately 600 divers. For many years, this meet was hosted by Overlee pool in Arlington, Virginia, and moved to Cardinal Hill in Vienna for 2007 and 2008. In 2012, the meet was hosted by Mansion House. Since its beginning in 1987, more than 9,000 divers have competed at Crackerjack. NVSL-Dive sponsors an annual 3-meter meet. Col. Wallace R. Martin arranged for the meet to be held at his home pool, Tuckahoe, in 1968 and then again every year thereafter for the rest of his life. Martin died in 1977, and in 1978 the NVSL 3-Meter Meet was renamed the Wally Martin 3-Meter Championship in his memory. NVSL Hall of Fame The NVSL and NVSL- Dive recognize graduating high school seniors who are NVSL divers and/or swimmers. The MacDuff Scholarship, created in 1991, is awarded annually to two NVSL swimmers or divers in honor of George MacDuff. The President's Scholarship, created in 1994, was named to honor all those volunteers who have served the youth of Northern Virginia. The Olivia Aull Spirit Scholarship was created in 2008 to honor Olivia Aull, and recognizes spirited swimmers and divers. The Swim Ninja Scholarship was created in 2010 and is sponsored by Swim Ninja LLC. It is awarded annually to an NVSL swimmer who serves his or her community as a leader both in and out of the water. Alejandro Wick was inducted into the NVSL Hall of Fame after scoring 23 points on the year and making it to All-Star Relays.

It was developed as a school project at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University, Prague, and is distributed under the GNU General Public License. BIRD supports Internet Protocol version 4 and version 6 by running separate daemons. It establishes multiple routing tables, and uses BGP, RIP, and OSPF routing protocols, as well as statically defined routes. Its design differs significantly from GNU Zebra and Quagga. Currently BIRD is included in many Linux distributions, such as Debian,Debian - Details of package bird in squeeze. Packages.debian.org. Retrieved on 2014-05-30. Ubuntuhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/bird and Fedora.bird  Package Info  koji. Koji.fedoraproject.org. Retrieved on 2014-05-30. BIRD is used in several Internet exchanges, such as the London Internet Exchange (LINX), LONAP, DE-CIX and MSK-IX as a route server, where it replaced Quagga because of its scalability issues. According to the 2012 Euro- IX survey, BIRD is the most used route server amongst European Internet exchanges. In 2010, CZ.NIC, the current sponsor of BIRD development, received the LINX Conspicuous Contribution Award for contribution of BIRD to the advancement in route server technology.  Design  BIRD implements an internal routing table to which the supported protocols connect. Most of these protocols import network routes to this internal routing table and also export network routes from this internal routing table to the given protocol. This way information about network routes is exchanged among different routing protocols. Using the kernel protocol this internal routing table may be connected to the actual kernel routing table. This allows BIRD to export network routes from its internal routing table to the kernel routing table and optionally also learn about network routes from the kernel routing table (created externally by the administrator or by other means) and import these routes into its internal routing table. Filters may be used to control what network routes are imported into the internal routing table or exported to the given protocol. Network routes may be accepted, rejected or modified using filters. BIRD also supports multiple internal routing tables and multiple instances of supported protocol types. Protocols may be connected to different internal routing tables, these internal routing tables may exchange information about network routes they contain (controlled by filters) and each of these internal routing tables may be connected to a different kernel routing table thus allowing for policy routing. Configuration is done by editing the configuration file and telling BIRD to reconfigure itself. BIRD changes to the new configuration without the need to restart the daemon itself and restarts reconfigured protocols only if necessary. There is also an option to do a soft reconfiguration, which doesn't restart protocols but may leave some stale information such as changed filters not filtering out already exported network routes.

The action taken by the Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland governments as a result of these attacks shattered the IRA and resulted in the former being free from IRA activity by the end of World War II. The campaign The Taoiseach of the Irish Free State, √âamon de Valera, complained about the occupation of Irish soil with the arrival of American soldiers in Northern Ireland as part of the war effort against Nazi Germany. This influx of foreign soldiers encouraged the northern command of the IRA, under the auspices of newly appointed commander Hugh McAteer, to reorganise and on 25 March 1942 agree a new campaign against the British military and war effort in Northern Ireland. Over the first few months of the campaign, a few attacks against the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in Strabane, Dungannon, and Belfast, resulted in the death of two RUC constables and the wounding of two others. Six IRA members, including Joe Cahill, were arrested during the Belfast incident and sentenced to death for the murder of one of the constables. A petition signed by around two hundred thousand people calling for mercy was gathered by those calling for a reprieve, and several days before the date of the executions, all but one was commuted. The sole IRA member executed was Tom Williams who was hanged at Crumlim Road gaol, Belfast, on 2 September 1942, resulting in the IRA intensifying their attacks. After the bombing of Randalstown RUC station, and more gunfire attacks against the RUC in parts of West Belfast and across the border area between Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State, around 320 members and suspected members of the IRA, including Hugh McActeer, were arrested across Northern Ireland. One historian, Bowyer-Bell, reports a total of 60 armed attacks by the IRA in the three months up to December 1942, carried out by the remaining fifty to sixty IRA members still at large. In the first few months of 1943, jail breaks at Crumlin Road and Derry gaols saw 23 IRA members, including McAteer, escape. This however failed to inspire a resumption of activity. Many of the escapees had crossed the border into County Donegal in the Free State and were subsequently recaptured by the Irish Army. The few others that escaped arrest sought refuge from pursuit rather than resuming their attacks. IRA northern command units in south Londonderry and south Armagh were no longer able to function as required, and contact with units in Counties Cavan and Monaghan started to wane. Bowyer-Bell states of the late-1943 to mid-1943 period that the local commanding officers preferred to avoid arrest, and that anything associated with the IRA such as parades, training, and even meetings ended with fear of internment at Curragh.Bowyer Bell, J. ‚Äì The Secret Army ‚Äì The IRA, page 229. 1997 3rd Edition. By the end of World War II in 1945, the northern command of the IRA, largely as a result of the stern response from the Free State, had been reduced to a few wanted men with Northern Ireland entirely free from IRA activity. The Northern Ireland government couldn't publicly acknowledge the fact their neighbour had essentially defeated the IRA, and the Irish Minister of Justice, Gerald Boland, was heard to boast during the period that \\"the IRA was dead and he had killed it\\".Bowyer Bell, J. ‚Äì The Secret Army ‚Äì The IRA, page 235. 1997 3rd Edition. Chronology of campaign =1942= * Easter Sunday ‚Äì a heavy gunfight in Belfast left a RUC constable dead, with six IRA members arrested in Cawnpore Street in response. In Dublin, Irish Special Branch attempted to arrest Lasarian Mangan and Brendan Behan. When Mangan seemed to hesitate in using his gun, Behan was heard to shout \\"Use it, use it. Give it to me and I will shoot the bastards.\\". Behan was later arrested in Dublin and received fourteen years in prison. The third incident in the time line involved Frank Morris, who began shooting when detained at a RUC border checkpoint in Strabane. He was captured 10 hours later that day, found hiding, immersed up to his neck in river water. * 20 April ‚Äì A new IRA Army Council was elected in the wake of these incidents. At this time it is known that Eoin McNamee in his capacity as Adjutant General met with German agent G√ºnther Sch√ºtz shortly before this. * 15 August ‚Äì IRA Army Council meets to confirm the details of the Northern campaign and to draw up a Campaign Proclamation. By this stage the arms and munitions from the IRA's Western and Eastern Command areas had been assembled on the border ready for transport into Northern Ireland. * 30 August ‚Äì IRA GHQ sends word to waiting units to begin the transfer of arms into Northern Ireland. That night three tons of material were transported over the border into Newry, County Down. Two lorries were used to transport the material through RUC checkpoints without incident. The arms were then stored in a barn attached to McCafferty's farm outside Hannahstown, County Antrim. The member overseeing the operation on the ground, Daragh O'Connor reported back to GHQ Belfast in person. His message was that the operation had been successful, and distribution of the material could now begin. Unfortunately for the IRA, a member sent to help Daragh O'Connor to the farm by members of the RUC who proceeded to raid the building. In the ensuing gun battle O'Connor was shot dead and 3 tons of arms seized. This however, was not the only shipment of arms into Northern Ireland the IRA had made, and the others were to remain, as yet, undetected. * 1 September ‚Äì The Army Council issued a General Army Order that in the event of the execution of Tommy Williams, all CO's were to take aggressive action. * 2 September ‚Äì Tom Williams' execution at 8am, The first attack afterwards, scheduled was to take place against a British Army barracks in Crossmaglen, County Armagh. Twenty IRA members were led by Patrick Dermody in a commandeered lorry and accompanying car. According to IRA member Harry White, who wrote about the raid in his book of memoirs \\"Harry\\", they hoped to capture a British officer and hang him. * 3 September ‚Äì The front of a police barracks in Randalstown, Co. Antrim, was demolished by a mine and a RUC sergeant was injured. * 4 September ‚Äì The ambush of an IRA patrol in Belfast resulted in James Bannon being wounded. The same day a mine failed to detonated during the attack on Belleek, RUC barracks, Co. Fermanagh. * 5 September ‚Äì Two RUC were killed in Clady, County Tyrone. While a failed attack in Belfast saw Gerry Adams Sr. wounded by the RUC. * 9 September ‚Äì Sergeant Denis O'Brien, a serving Irish Special Branch officer and himself a former IRA member, was shot dead by 3 IRA members outside his home in Ballyboden, Rathfarnham, County Dublin. This action was directly against IRA Army Council orders which forbade any operations of a military nature in √âire. Notice of a five thousand pound reward was issued for information leading to the apprehension of O'Brien's killers along with a list of men wanted in connection with the incident. Michael Quill was later apprehended by the RUC and turned over to Irish Special Branch in connection with the incident. This led to his internment in January 1943. Following the initial raid in September, the RUC and Irish Special Branch stepped up their efforts against the IRA. A series of arms finds and arrests were made. * 10 September ‚Äì Belfast IRA lost two members when they were surrounded in a house and captured. * 30 September ‚Äì Patrick Dermody was killed by Irish Special Branch following a gun battle in County Cavan. A member of Garda S√≠och√°na (Irish Police) also died due to friendly fire from his colleagues. * 12 October ‚Äì McAteer and his Director of Intelligence, O'Reilly, were arrested in Northern Ireland by the RUC Criminal Investigation Department (CID). McAteer was later sentenced to 15 years imprisonment for treason, and his position taken over by Charlie Kerins, who was later relieved by Harry White in late October. * 19 October ‚Äì Maurice O'Neill, was captured by Garda S√≠och√°na during a raid on a safe house in Holly Road, Donnycarney, County Dublin. A detective died during the raid. Harry White escaped and travelled to Belfast to take over as OC for Northern Command. During his trial by Military Tribunal in √âire, O'Neill was represented by Se√°n MacBride. MacBride failed however, to win O'Neill a reprieve and he was executed by the Irish Government on 12 November 1942. * October ‚Äì An RUC member was killed in an IRA attack on Donegall Pass, RUC station in Belfast. =1943= * 15 January ‚Äì IRA northern command commander, Hugh McAteer, along with another IRA member escaped over the wall of Crumlin Road gaol, Belfast. * 14 February ‚Äì IRA Army Council despite losing the ability to carry out their campaign resolved that \\"A political arm be formed representative of the whole country, whose constitution shall be based on the Constitution of the Republic proclaimed in arms in 1916 and ratified by the free vote of the Irish people in 1918.\\"Report of the General Headquarters Staff Council, Sunday 14 February, Northern Command Area. * 21 March ‚Äì 21 IRA prisoners escape from Magilligan prison in Derry. * 24 April 1943‚Äì The IRA, including McAteer, took over the Falls Road Broadway cinema in Belfast, and whilst holding its staff at gunpoint, forced the cinema audience to take part in a commemoration of the Easter Rising. A Proclamation of the 1916 Easter Rising was read out to the audience along with the IRA Army Council's annual statement, which included a denouncement of the American military presence in Northern Ireland as an \\"..invasion of our rights...\\" and warned that US troops could expect to be targeted in any \\"..resumption of hostilities between the Irish Republic [as invested in the IRA] and Great Britain.\\" * May ‚Äì IRA members who had escaped from Derry gaol were re-arrested. * October ‚Äì McAteer rearrested.

DePauw (11 October 19186 May 2005) was a traditionalist Catholic priest and founder of an organization that he called the Catholic Traditionalist Movement.  Early life  DePauw was born in Stekene, Belgium, the son of a newspaper editor. After graduating as a Diplomate in Classical Humanities, magna cum laude, from the College of St. Nicholas, he entered the diocesan seminary of Ghent for his philosophical and theological studies. During the Second World War he served as a combat medic with the 9th Belgian Infantry Hunters Regiment, and was taken prisoner at Dunkirk in 1940. After escaping from prison camp, he returned to his seminary studies and was ordained priest for the Diocese of Ghent in 1942. He served as a battle-field chaplain with the Belgian Underground Army and the Polish 1st Armoured Division until the end of the war.  Education and career  For three years DePauw studied at the University of Leuven, where he earned a bachelor's degree in canon law and a licentiate in canon law, moral theology and church history. In 1949 DePauw joined his family in the United States. He served as an assistant priest in two New York City parishes: St. Stephen's in Manhattan and St. Clare's in The Bronx. At the same time he pursued graduate studies at The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. In 1953 he received a doctorate in canon law with a dissertation entitled The Educational Rights of the Church and Elementary Schools in Belgium. From 1952 to 1963 DePauw taught canon law at Mount Saint Mary's Seminary in Emmitsburg, Maryland. In 1955 he requested and was granted incardination from the Diocese of Ghent to the Archdiocese of Baltimore and was named academic dean of the seminary.Cuneo, Michael W., The Smoke of Satan: Conservative and Traditionalist Dissent in Contemporary American Catholicism, JHU Press, 1999, p. 90 On 9 May 1955 he became a United States citizen. While teaching at the seminary, he contributed articles to the New Catholic Encyclopedia, the Encyclopedic Dictionary of the Bible, Homiletic and Pastoral Review, and Ephemerides Theologicae Lovanienses. During the Second Vatican Council he was called to Rome to serve as a peritus, a theological advisor to bishops at the Council. At the request of the Cardinal Secretary of State, Amleto Giovanni Cicognani, Pope Paul VI made him a domestic prelate with the title Right Reverend Monsignor. Towards the end of the Second Vatican Council DePauw came into conflict with Cardinal Lawrence Shehan, Archbishop of Baltimore, over the interpretation of the council's teachings, particularly about liturgical matters. In January 1965 DePauw incorporated an organization called the Catholic Traditionalist Movement in New York State, purportedly with the support of Cardinal Francis Spellman, Archbishop of New York. Shehan demanded that DePauw break with the organization. In summer 1965 Shehan removed DePauw from teaching duties at Mount Saint Mary's Seminary and transferred him to a parish in a Baltimore suburb. Shortly thereafter DePauw left for Rome. On 15 November 1965 Luigi Faveri, Bishop of Tivoli in Italy, signed a document transferring DePauw's incardination from the Archdiocese of Baltimore to the Diocese of Tivoli. Faveri said that he had taken this step at the request of Cardinal Spellman and of the Cardinal Secretary of the Holy Office, Alfredo Ottaviani. This transfer would have allowed DePauw to continue his work with the Catholic Traditionalist Movement in New York. In January 1966 after the attempted transfer from Baltimore to Tivoli became public, Cardinal Shehan said that the transfer was never legally completed and that DePauw was still a priest incardinated in the Archdiocese of Baltimore. In order to excardinate and incardinate, a priest must request excardination of his bishop, and it must be granted. As Cardinal Shehan was following the universal law of the Church, the Bishop of Tivoli supported Cardinal Shehan. Shehan suspended DePauw from his priestly functions. Bishop Blais Kurz, the exiled Prefect Apostolic of Yungchow in China, supported DePauw. On 23 June 1968 DePauw established the Ave Maria Chapel in Westbury, Long Island, where he ministered until his death. He became well known among traditionalist Catholics for his Sunday radio Mass, his video and audio cassettes, and pamphlets. He edited two magazines: Sounds of Truth and Tradition and Quote .. Unquote. His two best- known works are the Traditional Roman Catholic Mass and The Challenge of Peace through Strength, a critique of the American Catholic bishops' pastoral letter on war and peace, The Challenge of Peace. DePauw died on 6 May 2005. References External links * Catholic Traditionalist Movement * Fr.

It is mostly known for being the manufacturing location of the Swiss railway clock.  History  Sumiswald Castle, former home of Teutonic Knights' commandery Sumiswald village church, built in 1510-12 Aerial view from 400 m by Walter Mittelholzer (1922) Sumiswald is first mentioned in 1225 as Smoldeswalt. The name either comes from the Germanic settler \\"Suomolt\\" or the Latin term summa vallis (\\"bank over the valley\\"). The von Sumiswald family is first mentioned in 1135. They probably took their name from a, now vanished, castle in the area. The last member of the family, L√ºtold, donated the village, land and churches in Sumiswald and Escholzmatt to the commandery of the Teutonic Knights of the \\"Ballei\\" Swabia-Alsace-Burgundy. In 1525, the town bought its way out of serfdom, but stayed a part of the Teutonic Knights even after the Protestant Reformation was introduced in 1528; Sumiswald was sold to the city of Bern for 36,000 Reichs thaler in 1698. The village Church of St. Mary was first mentioned in 1225 along with the village. The old church was replaced with a new building in 1510-12. When Bern adopted the new faith of the Protestant Reformation, the village converted and the municipality acquired the patronage rights over the church. Hans Haslibacher, who was decapitated on October 20, 1571 in Bern because of his Anabaptist conviction came from Sumiswald; his decapitation was the last execution of an Anabaptist in Bern. The village was surrounded by a number of alpine meadows and seasonal alpine herding was an important part of the local economy. The first contracts governing ownership and access to the meadows are from 1498. In the following century many of the high forests were cleared to provide additional meadows for grazing. In 1572 the municipality passed laws to limit further clearing to prevent total deforestation. The settlements of Wasen, Ey and Gr√ºnen all developed out of small seasonal herding camps. In the following centuries ownership of the fields in the valley and the alpine meadows became firmly entrenched, creating a class of wealthy landowners and a class of poor artisans, day laborers and sharecroppers. The poor were forced to begin small scale spinning and weaving to supplement their income. By the 18th century, Sumiswald, was a local center of the yarn and cloth trade as well as horse breeding and cheese production. It attempted to become a market town, but other surrounding market towns blocked the attempt five times in the 18th century. Finally in 1801 Sumiswald was granted the right to hold five yearly fairs. Following the 1798 French invasion, Sumiswald became the capital of the Helvetic Republic district of Unteremmental. After the collapse of the Republic and 1803 Act of Mediation it joined the newly created Trachselwald District. In the 19th century the local yarn and cloth industry declined and was replaced with other industries including manufacturing musical instruments. The construction of the Emmental road in 1875, the Ramsei-Huttwil railroad in 1908 and the Sumiswald-Wasen rail line in 1915 brought new factories and industry to the municipality. Today Sumiswald is a regional cultural and economic center, with workers commuting into the municipality from surrounding villages. There are secondary schools in Sumiswald and Wasen as well as a retirement home. Geography Sumiswald, view from the tower of Castle Trachselwald Sumiswald consists of three villages (Sumiswald, Gr√ºnen and Wasen), two hamlets (Gammenthal and Griesbach) and scattered farm houses and alpine meadows in the lower Emmental.

For his role in the investigation of the Whiskey Ring, he was considered the first special prosecutor. Early life Born near Danville, Virginia, he moved with his parents to Lincoln County, Missouri, studied on his own while a farm hand, taught school, was admitted to the bar in 1844, and practiced. Political career Henderson was a member of the Missouri House of Representatives in 1848-1850 and 1856‚Äì1858, and was active in Democratic politics. He was commissioned a brigadier general in the Missouri State Militia in 1861, commanding federal forces in northeast Missouri. On January 17, 1862 Henderson was appointed to the U.S. Senate as a Unionist to fill the vacancy caused by the expulsion of Trusten Polk. Later that year, Henderson was elected to a full six-year term in the U.S. Senate. =13th Amendment= As a United States Senator representing a slave state, Henderson co-authored and co-sponsored the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution permanently prohibiting slavery in the United States. Henderson's original proposal, made January 11, 1864, was submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee, and on February 10, 1864, it presented the Senate with a proposal combining the drafts of congressmen James Mitchell Ashley (Republican, Ohio), James Falconer Wilson, (Republican, Iowa), Charles Sumner (Republican, Massachusetts), and Henderson.Congressional Proposals and Senate Passage Harper Weekly. The Creation of the 13th Amendment. Retrieved February 15, 2007 John B. Henderson in his elder years. On January 31, 1865, the 13th Amendment was approved by the U.S. Congress, and on February 1, 1865, it was signed by President Abraham Lincoln. On April 14, 1865, Lincoln was assassinated before the amendment was ratified by the State of Georgia on December 6, 1865. While in the Senate, Henderson was chairman of the Committee to Audit and Control the Contingent Expense (Thirty-ninth Congress) and a member of the Committee on Indian Affairs (Thirty-ninth and Fortieth Congresses). During President Andrew Johnson's impeachment trial, Henderson broke party ranks, along with six other Republican senators and voted for acquittal. These seven Republican senators were disturbed by how the proceedings had been manipulated in order to give a one-sided presentation of the evidence. Senators William Pitt Fessenden, Joseph S. Fowler, James W. Grimes, John B. Henderson, Lyman Trumbull, Peter G. Van Winkle,\\"Andrew Johnson Trial: The Consciences of Seven Republicans Save Johnson\\". and Edmund G. Ross of Kansas, who provided the decisive vote,\\"The Trial of Andrew Johnson, 1868\\". defied their party and public opinion and voted against impeachment. After the trial, Ben Butler conducted hearings on the widespread reports that Republican senators had been bribed to vote for Johnson's acquittal. In Butler's hearings, and in subsequent inquiries, there was increasing evidence that some acquittal votes were acquired by promises of patronage jobs and cash cards.David O. Stewart, Impeached: The Trial of President Andrew Johnson and the Fight for Lincoln's Legacy (2009), pp. 240-249, 284-299. Henderson was not a candidate for reelection to the Senate in 1868 and left the U.S. Senate on March 4, 1869. Henderson was an unsuccessful candidate for Governor of Missouri and later U.S. Senator. In 1875, he was appointed by Ulysses Grant as a special United States attorney for prosecution of the Whiskey Ring at St. Louis. After attempting to stifle Henderson's investigation of the president's personal secretary, Grant fired Henderson on the basis that Henderson's statements to a grand jury regarding Grant were impertinent. Following criticism, Grant appointed a new special prosecutor, James Broadhead, to continue the investigation. In 1877, Henderson was appointed a commissioner to treat with hostile tribes of Indians. Later life Henderson moved to Washington, D.C. in 1888, was a writer, and resided in the capital until his death in 1913. Interment was in Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn, New York.

He fought at the Battle of Gettysburg and was killed in action at the Battle of the Wilderness. Early life Jones was born in Charlottesville, Virginia. At West Point, he was nicknamed \\"Rum\\" Jones for his fondness for alcohol. He graduated in 1841, ranking 39th in a class of 52. Nineteen of his classmates would become Civil War generals, including John F. Reynolds, Nathaniel Lyon, Robert S. Garnett, Richard B. Garnett, Amiel W. Whipple, and Israel B. Richardson, all of whom would also die in combat. Assigned as a second lieutenant to the 7th Infantry, he was on frontier duty before returning to the U.S. Military Academy in 1845 as an assistant instructor of infantry tactics, serving until 1852. From 1854 until 1855, he served on a board commissioned to revise rifle and light artillery military tactics, and received a promotion to captain on March 3, 1855. Jones performed garrison duty at various forts across the country for a short period before participating in the Utah War from 1858 until 1860. Civil War With the outbreak of the Civil War and Virginia's secession, Jones resigned his commission in the United States Army on May 27, 1861 to enter the Confederate service as a captain of artillery. He was appointed a colonel of infantry and served in what became the Army of Northern Virginia. He participated as a staff officer in Stonewall Jackson's Shenandoah Valley Campaign of 1862, Front Royal, the Seven Days Battles, the Second Battle of Bull Run, Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville. In May, Jones was promoted to brigadier general in Edward \\"Allegheny\\" Johnson's division to replace John R. Jones (not related). During Johnson's assault on Culp's Hill at Gettysburg, Jones suffered a severe wound to his thigh that put him out of action. Some sources say that it was a head wound, but in his official report, Jones cites extreme hemorrhaging of his thigh. In August, Robert E. Lee called Jones \\"a good commander\\" when he assigned him to lead the brigade vacated by William \\"Extra Billy\\" Smith, who had returned to Virginia as governor. Late in the year, Jones was wounded again during the Mine Run Campaign. In the early days of the Overland Campaign of 1864, Jones was killed at the Wilderness while attempting to rally his wavering men. His brigade had taken a position on the south side of the Orange Turnpike. Shortly before 1:00 p.m., it was hit hard by Brig. General Joseph J. Bartlett's V Corps brigade, which began pushing back the Confederates, many in disorder. Jones and his aide-de-camp Robert Early were killed while desperately trying to restore order. Jones's body was eventually returned home and buried in Maplewood Cemetery in Charlottesville.Eicher, p. 324. Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell wrote of Jones's death in his official report on the Wilderness, \\"I considered his loss an irreparable one to his brigade.\\" Jones's sister was married to famed Confederate general A.P.

However, Rastus (a shortening of Erastus, the Greek name of, especially, Erastus of Corinth) has never been particularly popular as a black name. For example, the 1870 census reported only 42 individuals named Rastus in the United States, of whom only four were Black or mulatto. Rastus--as a stereotypically happy black man, not as a particular person--became a familiar character in minstrel shows.

He was most notable for his service as a United States Representative (1921-1923) and a U.S. Senator (1929-1935). Early life Patterson was born in Springfield, Missouri on September 15, 1876. He attended public and private schools, Drury College, (Springfield) and the University of Missouri in Columbia. He graduated from the law department of Washington University (St. Louis) in 1897, was admitted to the bar later that year, and commenced practice in Springfield. Start of career From 1903 to 1907, Patterson served as prosecuting attorney of Greene County. In 1912, Patterson was appointed to the Missouri Republican State Committee, and he served until 1920. Patterson was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1920 and served in the 67th Congress, March 4, 1921 to March 3, 1923. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1922 and resumed the practice of law in Springfield. He was a presidential elector in 1924. From 1925 to 1928, Patterson resided in Kansas City, Missouri and was United States district attorney for the western district of Missouri. He resigned in 1928 in order to accept the Republican nomination for United States Senator. U.S. Senate Patterson won the general election in November 1928. He took his Senate seat the following year and served one term, March 4, 1929 to January 3, 1935. While in the Senate, he was chairman of the Committee on Mines and Mining (72nd Congress). His chief legislative accomplishment was sponsorship of the Lindbergh Law, which enabled federal authorities to investigate kidnappings if the victims were transported across state lines. Patterson served during the Great Depression, which was largely blamed on Republican economic policies. He consistently opposed the New Deal remedies of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, which made him unpopular in Missouri. As a result, Patterson was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in the 1934 election, losing the general election to the Democratic nominee, Harry S. Truman. Later career After leaving the Senate, Patterson resumed the practice of law in Springfield. For several years, Patterson was a member of the Missouri Appellate Judicial Commission. Death and burial Patterson suffered a stroke in July 1954. His health deteriorated and he died in Springfield on October 22, 1954. He was buried at Maple Park Cemetery in Springfield. Family Patterson was married to Ada Holman of Springfield (1877-1957). They were the parents of two children, Paul (1902-1924) and Hadley (1908-1958).

Bonavena on Revista Room In Cigars are manufactured in Cuba by Habanos S.A. and in Dominican Republic by Spanish Altadis, a subsidiary of Imperial Brands.  History  According to Adriano Martinez, a former executive of Habanos S.A. giving testimony in Min Ron Nee's Illustrated Encyclopedia of Post-Revolution Havana Cigars, the \\"Trinidad\\" brand was first produced in 1969Marca Trinidad on Habanos.com at the El Laguito factory in Havana.Trinidad Robustos T on Puro Habano In the early 1990s, the cigar received much attention in Cigar Aficionado after an interview with Avelino Lara (formerly the manager of El Laguito, and a producer of cigars for the Graycliff Hotel in Nassau, Bahamas until his death on October 27, 2009). In the 1992 interview, Lara claimed that Trinidad was an ultra-exclusive brand that only Fidel Castro was authorized to hand out as diplomatic gifts. Lara also claimed Trinidads were of a higher quality than the much-lauded Cohibas that had formerly been diplomatic exclusives before their mass-market release in 1982. Two sources have contradicted Lara's claims: President Fidel Castro himself and the afore-mentioned Mr. Mart√≠nez. In an interview with Cigar Aficionado, when asked about Trinidads, Castro stated that he only gave Cohibas away as diplomatic gifts, and in his autobiography; my life, he claims to know very little of the Trinidad brand. In the Illustrated Encyclopedia, Mart√≠nez stated that Trinidads were actually a lower-level diplomatic gift than Cohiba cigars, made with a tobacco blend similar to that used in the Cohiba vitolas, but without the third barrel fermentation that Cohibas receive. In 1995, Cigar Aficionado hosted the Dinner of the Century in Paris, France, where, among other rarities, the guests became the first outside of diplomatic circles to taste Trinidad cigars. In February 1998, the Trinidad brand was released for public consumption at an opening ceremony in the Habana Libre Hotel in Havana. The initial release was only in one size: the Fundador. Though Mart√≠nez and others maintain that the blend did not change in the transition from a diplomatic gift to a mass- marketed cigar, the size did. The diplomatic Trinidads only came in one size, that of a Laguito No. 1 (the same as the Cohiba Lancero). The Fundador instead comes in a new size with a factory name of Laguito Especial, the same length as a Laguito No. 1 but with a ring gauge of 40 instead of 38. In November 2003 at a black tie dinner hosted by British importer Hunters & Frankau at the Hilton Park Lane in London, England, three new sizes were debuted for the Trinidad line: the Coloniale, the Reyes, and the Robusto Extra.

An inhabitant of the area is known as a Ru√©s (plural Rueses). It contains three parroquias: A R√∫a de Valdeorras, Roblido and San Xuli√°n. Geography The municipality of A R√∫a is bordered on the north by lugu√©s de Quiroga and in the east by Vilamart√≠n de Valdeorras east, it is part of the Diocese of Astorga. A R√∫a is on the northern edge of the Valdeorras valley. The Cereixido hills are on the northern part of the municipality, with Cabeza Porri√±as (1.221 m) as its highest point. The river Sil marks the southern boundary of the municipality. The temperate Mediterranean climate is marked by low rainfall and dry summers. Its micro climate and terrain makes the region excellent for viticulture. History According to Pliny the Elder, before the arrival of the Romans, A R√∫a and the rest of the comarca of Valdeorras was occupied by the Celtiberian Cigurri tribe (also known as the Egurri). The medieval and modern name of the comarca is derived from this tribe meaning \\"valley of the Cigurri\\" (Val de Geurres) The Cigurri were part of the Cismontani branch of the Asturian people. They spoke the Celtic Gallaecian language. The Romans under Emperor Augustus invaded in 25 BC leading to the Asturian war which lasted until 19 BC, although there were minor rebellions until 16 BC. Near A R√∫a and Pet√≠n was the location of the Forum Cigurrorum, the political center of the Cigurri, located on the via Nova (via XVIII) between Bracara Augusta and Asturica Augusta. After the Germanic invasions, the municipality was part of the Suebic Kingdom and then the Visigothic Kingdom. It was known as Geurres or Giorres and was home to a mint during the reigns of Witteric and Suintila (603‚Äì631). Muslims ruled the region briefly until king Alfonso I of Asturias (739‚Äì757) retook the region in the Reconquista. The comarca of Valdeorras was depopulated after its capture by Alfonso I as part of the Desert of the Duero, a buffer zone he created between Asturias and the Muslim states. During the reign of Ordo√±o I of Asturias (850‚Äì866) the re-population of the uninhabited zone began. The people who descended the mountains of the north for the uninhabited valleys were called foramontanos: meaning \\"out of the mountains.\\" A R√∫a, also known as San Esteban de La R√∫a during the Middle Ages, was the historical capital of Valdeorras. The region was under the successive rule of the Kingdom of Asturias, Kingdom of Galicia, Kingdom of Leon and the Crown of Castile. During the Spanish War of Independence, Spanish guerrillas and Napoleon's Grande Arm√©e clashed in the region. Until the new administrative division of Spain in 1833, Valdeorras was part of the province of El Bierzo, and was considered part of Leon. Afterwards, it became a comarca of Galicia. The opening of the Palencia-A Coru√±a railway line on 1 September 1883 was a decisive moment for the economy of the region. Economy Since ancient times Valdeorras has been a wine- producing region due to its climate and position on the river Sil. Its main source of income remains the production of wines and spirits. The identity of the municipality is unequivocally linked to the wine and its multiple warehouses attest to this. Acting as a test of the quality of its wines, in 2011, the renowned winemaker Robert M. Parker's cataloged them among the elite in world of wines. Although within the municipality there is no mining, many residents of the area are active in the extraction of slate in other municipalities of the district. Besides wine and slate, other activities that invigorate economic activity in the municipality are: power generation, carpentry, goods transportation, hospitality, food, a factory was built recently and auxiliary automotive industry.

The Christopher Center is Valparaiso's fourth library and replaces the former Henry F. Moellering Library, which was demolished in 2005 to make way for the forthcoming student union. As a result, the facilities holdings within the Christopher Center are now known as The Moellering Collection. Construction and architecture Comprising of space, the building was designed by Esherick Homsey Dodge & Davis of Chicago, which sought to \\"break the mold\\" of institutional libraries. Part of a $33 million project, the Christopher Center was made possible through gifts from alumni and friends, including a $16 million gift from Jay Christopher and his wife Doris. Support of the University's Three Goals, One Promise campaign made construction of the building possible. Among the major donors to the building project are those whose gifts are recognized in special areas of the building. The grid-like structure flanking the south and east sides of the building's exterior provides an interesting appearance for the building while serving as a valuable sun screen. This protects the books from harmful, constant exposure to sun rays and helps soften the sunlight entering the two-story reading room overlooking Resurrection Meadow south of the chapel. At the same time, spaces throughout the facility are bathed in natural light. Building features The wireless building accommodates current study preferences by replacing study carrels with soft furniture in \\"living room\\" settings, several complete with fireplaces. Food and beverages are available at a caf√© on the premises. There are some 2,400 data ports and 88 wireless access points in the building, all connected by of data cable. Computer clusters are located amply throughout the building, totaling over 250 individual computers available for student use. Sunshades also automatically lower when too much sunlight is entering the building, and raise when it is dark outside. Books and other traditional information resources mix with computers and access to the Internet on every floor. The computer-driven, robotic Automated Storage and Retrieval System uses space efficiently and allowed the overall shelving capacity in the center to increase to 600,000 volumes without having to increase the size of the building. Automated storage and retrieval system Perhaps the best representation of Christopher Center's integration of traditional library services with current technology is the Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS). This combination of robotics and computer system has the capacity to store 300,000 files. Two stories high, the system features bins stacked along two aisles. Materials that are used infrequently by students or faculty are maintained in this location. Larger view of the library When one of the 60,000 items is requested, the robotic system locates and retrieves the publication in about 15 seconds. Using a bar code logged into it, the management computer system runs the robot and simultaneously registers the volume's current location in the one of its 1,872 bins. Designed like a combination car-jack and fork lift, the computer-controlled cranes move along the aisles and up or down the stacks of bins to retrieve the requested material and place it on a tray desk in the main circulation area. Provided by a gift from alumnus Herbert F. Stride, this automated storage and retrieval system is one of the first five installed for use in libraries in the nation. Collections The Christopher Center Special Collections have a particular strength in Reformation-era theology, with an emphasis on collecting various early editions of the writings of Martin Luther. Included in the general collections are several decades' worth of back issues of journals and government documents. The Center collects official government maps from the U.S. Geological Survey, National Imagery and Mapping Agency, the CIA, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior. It is an Army Map Service depository for a special collection of 70,000 maps. The collection also contains National Geographic Society, maps as well as local, state, national and international maps. There are 2,200 LPs in the center's audio/visual collection, ranging from classical to blues, retro and jazz. In total, there are over 2,300 sound recordings (CDs, LPs, cassette tapes), 1,900 visual recordings (DVDs and VHS tapes), and 1,400 CD-ROMs for academic and recreational purposes.
