After its two sister ships both mysteriously sank in the Acadian peninsula, drowning nine men, and the only two other ships built to the same specifications met identical fates, the Marc Guylaine became the subject of great fear that it would meet a similar end. The government eventually agreed to purchase the \\"cursed\\" ship from its captain, and subsequently renamed it and moved it out of Atlantic Canada, selling it to a fishing corporation on the Pacific Coast where it remains in service today as the Freeport. Construction In 1969, Saint John Shipbuilding built three identical 126-tonne fishing trawlers named the Lady Audette II, the Marc Guylaine II and the Lady Dorianne II.Miramar Ship Index, Lady Audette II, Marc Guylaine II, Lady Dorianne II The original engineering records for the Dorianne and Audette were obtained by the Marine Museum of the Great Lakes at Kingston for their records-collection.

Everybody aboard was presumed killed, although the ship and bodies were never found.Important Dates in the Islands de La Madeleine In December, the Ministry of Transportation was urged to not give up its search for the ship, since the previous sinkings of two identical ships were still unexplained and it was hoped that the wreckage might provide a clue to its fate.Bourque, Claude.

It was named for the Convention of Aguascalientes of October to November 1914.  Formation  Prior to the formation of the Constitionalist and Conventionists, the two groups worked together to defeat General Victoriano Huerta. Huerta had overthrown President Francisco Madero and taken over the government in 1913. Opposition to Huerta was led by Venustiano Carranza, along with generals, Pancho Villa and √Ålvaro Obreg√≥n. They were loosely allied with Emiliano Zapata. Together, they defeated Huerta in 1914. At The Convention of Aguascalientes in the fall of 1914, the winning revolutionary factions were unable to agree and a civil war ensued between the Constitutionalists and Conventionists.  Goals  The Conventionists called for more radical, immediate land reform which Carranza‚Äôs government did not agree with. They also wanted to implement the Plan of Ayala (1911), written by Emiliano Zapata calling for the redistribution of land. In addition, Villa and Zapata wanted a decentralized federal government with more state autonomy. With this, the Conventionists garnered the support of the countryside.  Participation in the civil war and fall  At the start of the civil war, the Conventionists captured Mexico City in late 1914. There were approximately 150,000 soldiers in both factions in 1915. By spring of 1915, Obreg√≥n began to defeat the Conventionists. Zapata retreated to his home state, occasionally sending troops to Villa. Villa was defeated at the Battle of Celaya, followed by losses at Le√≥n, Santa Ana, Aguascalientes, and Agua Prieta. By 1917, Carranza was elected president and the civil war was over. Guerilla skirmishes would continue separately by the armies of Zapata and Villa near their home states. In 1919, Zapata was killed by Carranza‚Äôs government. Villa signed a peace treaty with Carranza‚Äôs successor, Adolfo de la Huerta in 1920 but died in an ambush three years later in 1923.

TOC  Background  When the liquid forms an interface with a gas phase, a molecule on the border has quite different physical properties due to the unbalance of attracting forces by the neighboring molecules. At the equilibrium state of the liquid, interior molecules are under the balanced forces with uniformly distributed adjacent molecules. However, relatively fewer number of molecules in the gas phase above the interface than condensed liquid phase makes overall sum of forces applied to the surface molecule direct inside of the liquid and thus surface molecules tend to minimize their own surface area. Such an inequality of molecular forces induces continuous movement of molecules from the inside to the surface, which means the surface molecules has extra energy, which is called surface free energy or potential energy, and such an energy acting on reduced unit area is defined as surface tension. This is a frame work to interpret relevant phenomena which occurs surface or interface of materials and many methods to measure the surface tension has been developed.Adamson, Arthur W.; Alice P. Gast (1997). Physical Chemistry of Surfaces (6th ed.). Wiley Interscience. Among the various ways to determine surface tension, Du No√ºy ring method and Wilhelmy slide method are based on the separation of a solid object from the liquid surface, and Pendant drop method and Sessile drop or bubble method depend on the deformation of the spherical shape of a liquid drop. Even though these methods are relatively simple and commonly used to determine the static surface tension, in case that the impurities are added to the liquid, measurement of surface tension based on the dynamic equilibrium should be applied since it takes more time to obtain a completely formed surface and this means that it is difficult to achieve the static equilibrium as a pure liquid does.Bubble Pressure Method at kruss-scientific.com The most typical impurity to induce dynamic surface tension measurement is a surfactant molecule which has both of hydrophilic segment, generally called ‚Äúhead group‚Äù and hydrophobic segment, generally called ‚Äútail group‚Äù in a same molecule. Due to the characteristic molecular structure, surfactants migrate to the liquid surface bordering gas phase until an external force disperse the accumulated molecules from the interface or surface is fully occupied and thus cannot accommodate extra molecules. During this process, surface tension decrease as function of time and finally approach the equilibrium surface tension (œÉequilibrium).Dynamic Methods at lauda.de Such a process is illustrated in figure 1. (Image was reproduced from reference) File:Bubble1.jpg :Figure 1 ‚Äì Migration of surfactant molecules and change of surface tension (œÉt1 > œÉt2 > œÉequilibrium)  Maximum bubble pressure method  One of the useful methods to determine the dynamic surface tension is measuring the \\"maximum bubble pressure method\\" or, simply, bubble pressure method. Bubble pressure tensiometer produces gas bubbles (ex. air) at constant rate and blows them through a capillary which is submerged in the sample liquid and its radius is already known. The pressure (P) inside of the gas bubble continues to increase and the maximum value is obtained when the bubble has the completely hemispherical shape whose radius is exactly corresponding to the radius of the capillary. Figure 2 shows each step of bubble formation and corresponding change of bubble radius and each step is described below. (Image was reproduced from reference) File:Bubble2.jpg :Figure 2 ‚Äì Change of pressure during bubble formation plotted as a function of time. A, B: A bubble appears on the end of the capillary. As the size increases, the radius of curvature of the bubble decreases. C: At the point of the maximum bubble pressure, the bubble has a complete hemispherical shape whose radius is identical to the radius of the capillary denoted by Rcap. The surface tension can be determined using the Young‚ÄìLaplace equation in the reduced form for spherical bubble shape within the liquid. \\\\sigma=\\\\frac{\\\\Delta P_{\\\\rm {max}} \\\\times R_{\\\\rm {cap}}}{2} (œÉ: surface tension, ŒîPmax: maximum pressure drop, Rcap: radius of capillary) D, E: After the maximum pressure, the pressure of the bubble decreases and the radius of the bubble increases until the bubble is detached from the end of a capillary and a new cycle begins. This is not relevant to determine the surface tension. Currently developed and commercialized tensiometers monitors the pressure needed to form a bubble, the pressure difference between inside and outside the bubble, the radius of the bubble, and the surface tension of the sample are calculated in one time and a data acquisition is carried out via PC control. Bubble pressure method is commonly used to measure the dynamic surface tension for the system containing surfactants or other impurities because it does not require contact angle measurement and has high accuracy even though the measurement is done rapidly. ‚ÄúBubble pressure method‚Äù can be applied to measure the dynamic surface tension, particularly for the systems which contain surfactants. Moreover, this method is an appropriate technique to apply to biological fluids like serum because it does not require a large amount of liquid sample for the measurements.Hubbard, Arthur T. (2002). Encyclopedia of Surface and Colloid Science (Vol. 1). CRC press, pp. 814‚Äì815 Finally, the method is used for an indirect determination of the surfactant content of industrial cleaning or coating baths because the dynamic surface tension in a particular range of bubble formation rates shows a strong correlation with the concentration.

Morganella infections It has a commensal relationship within the intestinal tracts of humans, mammals, and reptiles as normal flora. Although M. morganii has a wide distribution, it is considered an uncommon cause of community- acquired infection and it is most often encountered in postoperative and other nosocomial infections such as urinary tract infections. Historical identification and systematics Morganella morganii was first described by a British bacteriologist H. de R. Morgan in 1906 as Morgan's bacillus. Morgan isolated the bacterium from stools of infants who were noted to have had \\"summer diarrhea\\". Later in 1919, Winslow et al. named Morgan's bacillus, Bacillus morganii. In 1936, though, Rauss renamed B. morganii as Proteus morganii. Fulton, in 1943, showed that B. columbensis and P. morganii were the same and defined the genus Morganella, due to the DNA-DNA hybridization. M. morganii has two subspecies ‚Äì M. m. morganii and M. m. columbensis. However, in 1962, a review article by Ewing reported that M. columbensis had been re- identified as Escherichia coli, thereby removing that organism from the genus Morganella. Microbiology M. morganii grown on blood agar Morganella morganii is facultatively anaerobic and oxidase-negative. Its colonies appear off-white and opaque in color, when grown on agar plates. M. morganii cells are straight rods, about 0.6‚Äì0.7 Œºm in diameter and 1.0‚Äì1.7 Œºm in length. This organism moves by way of peritrichous flagella, but some strains do not form flagella at 30 ¬∞C. M. morganii can produce the enzyme catalase, so is able to convert hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen. This is a common enzyme found in most living organisms. In addition, it is indole test-positive meaning that this organism can split tryptophan to indole, pyruvate, and ammonia. Methyl red tests positive in M. morganii, an indicator dye that turns red due to the bacterium's acid production during fermentation. Although a rare human pathogen, M. morganii has been reported as a cause of urinary tract infections, nosocomial surgical wound infections, peritonitis, central nervous system infection, endophthalmitis, pneumonia, chorioamnionitis, neonatal sepsis, pyomyositis, necrotizing fasciitis, and arthritis. Numerous cases of nosocomial infection have been described, usually as postsurgical wound infections or urinary tract infections. Patients in whom bacteremia develops are typically immunocompromised, diabetic, or elderly, or have at least one serious underlying disease. Role of bacteria M. morganii consists of two species: M. morganii and M. sibonii. M. morganii has been regarded as a normally harmless opportunistic pathogen, but some strains carry \\"antibiotic- resistant plasmids\\" and have been associated with nosocomial outbreaks of infections. Several reports indicate M. morganii causes sepsis, ecthyma, endophthalmitis, and chorioamnionitis, and more commonly urinary tract infections, soft tissue infections, septic arthritis, meningitis, and bacteremia, in the latter 2 cases with frequent fatal consequences. In a rare case published in 2003, a patient presented with bilateral necrosis of both upper and lower eyelids. Upon microbial analysis, the areas were shown to have heavy growth of M. morganii. Treatment and antibiotic resistance Treatment of M. morganii infections may include: *Ticarcillin *Piperacillin *Ciprofloxacin *Third-generation and fourth-generation cephalosporins A study conducted at the University Hospital at Heraklion, Crete, Greece showed a 92% success rate in the use of these antibiotics. However, some M. morganii strains are resistant to penicillin, ampicillin/sulbactam, oxacillin, first- generation and second-generation cephalosporins, macrolides, lincosamides, fosfomycin, colistin, and polymyxin B. The emergence of highly resistant strains of M. morganii have been associated with use of third-generation cephalosporins. Polymicrobial infections are most abundantly caused by this microbe which additionally damages the skin, soft tissues, and urogenital tract; these can be cured through use of the aforementioned antibiotics.

Historical records show Emperor Tewodros built a huge cannon called Sebastopol in 1868, in Gondar Province at a village named Gafat, and took it to the mountain of Maqdala. Later, under the reign of Emperor Menelik, an ammunition factory was established in 1911, which started producing cartridges for Wejigra and Wechefor rifles.\\"FDRE Defense Industry, May 2008 page 8 The basis for modern defense industry was laid with the establishment of the then Emperor Haile Selassie ammunition factory in 1953 with the cooperation of the government of Czechoslovakia.

Due to the serious attention given towards building a strong defense industry, the Derg regime set out to build various defense factories with support from the former Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc nations. In 1986, the government issued a directive to form a Defense Industry Commission reporting to the council of ministers which would be responsible for administration, production and strategic direction.

First isolated in 1977, a wide range of structures and derivatives have been found or developed throughout the world. Due to the extensive number of structures available, this review will focus on the more important groups here while covering their occurrence, biological activity, biosynthesis, and laboratory synthesis.  Chemical classification  Indolocarbazoles belong to the alkaloid sub-class of bisindoles. The most frequently isolated indolocarbazoles are Indolo(2,3-a)carbazoles; the most common subgroup of the Indolo(2,3-a)carbazoles are the Indolo(2,3-a)pyrrole(3,4-c)carbazoles. These can be divided into two major classes - halogenated (chlorinated) with a fully oxidized C-7 carbon with only one indole nitrogen containing a Œ≤-glycosidic bond and the second class consists of both indole nitrogen glycosylated, non- halogenated, and a fully reduced C-7 carbon.  Occurrence  The first isolated ICZ, dubbed staurosporine (STA) was in 1977 from a culture of Streptomyces staurosporeus found in a soil sample from Iwate Prefecture, Japan. The proper stereochemistry was not proven until 1994. Over the course of the next decade, further study of the compound showed some fungi inhibition, hypotensive activity, and most importantly, a broad protein kinase inhibitor. The next landmark discovery came with the detection of rebeccamycin (REB) in a sample of Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes, again in soil, but this time in a sample from Panama. REB was found to act against leukemia and melanoma in mice, and also against human adenocarcinoma cells. Since 1977, ICZs have been discovered all over the world in actinomycetes, bacteria commonly found in soil. Numerous forms have tested positive for anti-tumor activity, such as 7-hydroxy-STA and 7-oxo-STA2. Some of the strains from which ICZ compounds have been found are Actinomadura melliaura in Bristol Cove, California, Streptomyces hygroscopicus in Numazu Prefecture, Japan, Micromonospora sp. L-31-CLO-002 from Fuerteventura Island, Canary Islands, Spain, and Actinomadura sp. Strain 007 from Jiaozhou Bay, China. The wide distribution of the various strains that produce these compounds is not surprising due to the number of properties these compounds can take on with limited functionalization on the specie‚Äôs part. In addition to actinomycetes, ICZs have been found in slime molds (myxomycetes), blue-green algae (cyanobacteria, and marine invertebrates. Like the ones derived from actinomycetes, the ones found in myxomycetes cover an expansive range of derivatives and functionalizations. Two of the more important ones to date have been Arcyriacyanin A, which was found to inhibit a panel of human cancer cells by effecting PKC and protein tyrosine kinase, and lycogalic acid dimethyl ester A (found in Tokushima, Japan from Lycogala epidendrum), which showed strong antiviral activity. A few of the strains of myxomycetes studied are Arcyria ferruginea and Arcyria cinerea, both from Kochi Prefecture, Japan. Three species of cyanobacteria has been found to produce ICZ compounds. Nostoc sphaericum from Manoa Hawaii, Tolypothrix tjipanasensis from Vero Beach, Florida, and Fischerella ambigua strain 108b from Leggingen, Switzerland. An interesting note on the first two is that many of the ICZ derived from them do not have the annelated pyrrolo[3,4-c] unit. The final major group in which ICZs are found are various marine invertebrates. Three species of tunicate, one mollusk, one flatworm, and one sponge have been discovered in places ranging from Micronesia to New Zealand. Testing for further invertebrate production is ongoing by both genetic and phylum-based studies. Biological activity Indolocarbazoles have been found to exhibit a wide range of activities, which makes their range of presence in nature unsurprising. Because of this variety, the following section will examine their modes of action in bacterial and mammalian cells independently, with special attention paid to cancer cell effects. The general modes of action found in mammalian cells are inhibition of protein kinases, inhibition of eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase, and intercalative binding to DNA. The number of protein kinases thought to exist in the human genome exceeds six hundred, making a nanomolar inhibitor such as STA extremely useful for both treatment of various diseases and study of protein kinases in a variety of functions. Since this discovery, a vast effort has been undergone to make highly specific STA and REB derivatives. One of the major lessons learned from initial research on STA was the development of the pharmacophore model for a protein kinase inhibitor in which a bidentate hydrogen donating system flanked by various hydrophobic groups inserts into the binding site. The information derived from this original pharmacophore has led to the synthesis of highly specific inhibitors against a number of protein kinases, including PKC, cyclin-dependent kinases, G-protein coupled receptor kinases, tyrosine kinase, and cytomegalovirus pUL97 protein. Topoisomerase I and II cleave and relegate one and two sides of a DNA strand, respectively, and are consequently vital parts of cell reproduction. Studies have found that in REB-like structures, the imide function of the pyrrole segment acts to interact with Topoisomerase I, the main carbon backbone acts as an intercalative inhibitor, and the sugar moiety undergoes DNA groove binding. The latter two actually act in unison due to the three- dimensional structure of a glycosylated REB molecule. The Top1 inhibitor section binds to cleavable DNA-Top1 complexes so as to prevent the relegation step. Because of this, sensitivity is based on quantity of Top1 present, making cells undergoing constant reproduction and growth (namely tumor cells) most vulnerable. At this point, bacterial inhibition of Top1 has not been founding using ICZs. Because of this, it is thought that most of the anti-cell growth function of ICZs comes from inhibition of various protein kinase groups and intercalative DNA binding. Studies on Streptomyces griseus with in vitro protein labelling have led to inhibition of a wide range of cellular functions. This led to the theory that there were several eukaryotic protein kinases present required for secondary metabolism. Biosynthesis Unfortunately, only biosynthesis of REB, STA, and K252a have been studied in depth. This section will emphasize the REB pathway due to how well studied it is. The pathway begins with the modification of L-tryptophan to 7-chloro-L- tryptophan. This is done by catalysis using RebH in vitro halogenation and RebF (a flavin reductase) to provide FADH2 for the halogenase. RebO (a tryptophan oxidase) then deaminates, after which it is further reacted with another one of itself and RebD (a heme containing oxidase). This forms the majority of the carbon backbone, which then undergoes decarboxylative ring closure using RebC and RebP. A glycosylation occurs using RebG and NDP-D- glucose, which finally goes through methylation by RebM. These latter tailoring enzymes have been noted as permissive in terms of both aglycons/acceptors and glycosyl/alkyl donors. A parallel pathway has been put forth for the structurally related disaccharide-substituted indolocarbazole AT2433, the aminopentose of which is also found appended to the 10-membered enediyne calicheamicin. Information for this pathway, along with those of K252a and STA, was derived from information on known genes, enzymes, and intermediates. The two types of studies done on these pathways are in vivo studies of gene disruption of L. aerocolonigenes or recombinant strains of S. albus. The second type of experiment consisted of in vitro experiments done on cell extracts. Synthesis Laboratory synthesis of ICZs has been a topic of great interest since their discovery. Unfortunately, due to the somewhat complex nature of the molecule and the high level of reactivity of carbons on indole molecules, a facile high yield synthesis has yet to be found. Despite this, there have been many ways found to produce this compound in its various forms. Of special interest is one of the better REB syntheses, found in 1999. The process begins by producing 7-chloroindole-3-acetamide by treating 7-chloroindole with a series of reagents, shown farther down. This molecule is then glycosylated and reacted with methyl 7-chloroindole-3-glyoxylate to produce an intermediate that goes on to stabilize into the final product. While this process is one of the better ones to date, it is still work and time intensive, going through 12 total steps and only yielding 12%.  Further developments  Ever since the birth of ICZ research in the late seventies, the field has been burgeoning with continued advances in both technology and organic chemistry techniques. While only a handful of ICZ based compounds have made it past stage II clinical trials, the sheer variety that these molecules can take on leaves much still unexplored territory. Of particular recent interest in synthesis techniques is the use of palladium based catalysts, which have been found to be excellent activators for use in formation of carbon-carbon bonds.

The now-vacant Battery Peck emplacement was then modified as well, for .90 mm M1 Anti-Motor Torpedo Boat guns.http://fortwiki.com/Battery_AMTB_8_-_Peck Following conversion, which was completed by the summer of 1943, Battery New Peck became the Examination battery for the Advanced Harbor Entrance Control Post No. 1, located on the roof of Battery Potter, also at Fort Hancock. This was one of three harbor entrance control posts operating in New York Harbor. The primary command and control post was located within Fort Tompkins, an older masonry coast defense fort dating from the 1840s, located high on the bluffs on the Fort Wadsworth reservation in Staten Island, with vantages overlooking the entire harbor and all sea approaches. The second was the Advanced Harbor Entrance Control Post No. 1 at Fort Hancock, which was responsible for confirming the identification of every last Allied ship within all convoys, as well as other vessels, as they entered into New York Harbor from the open ocean, all as the U-boat War and the Battle of the Atlantic raged off the Jersey Shore. Advanced Harbor Entrance Control Post No. 2 was at Fort Tilden on Long Island, and supervised the out-bound convoys heading out to sea. These were no small feats, as convoys could have an average number of over 100 ships. U.S. Army Harbor Defense of New York Annex Report, 1944 Twenty-four hours a day, New York Harbor hummed with hundreds of fully laden ammunition ships, fuel tankers, freighters, and troop ships. These were supplied by a hub of highways and railroads connecting factories and refineries, all leading into massive storage facilities ringing the harbor in New York and New Jersey. With 60% of all Allied war material destined for Africa, the Mediterranean, and the European Theater leaving from New York, Brigadier General Philip S. Gage, Sr, the New York Harbor Defense Commander, testified before Congress, stating, \\"I am the defender of twenty million people and the industrial heartland of the nation.\\"U.S. Army Harbor Defense of New York Annex Report, 1944. The primary threat to all American harbors at this time was commerce raiding and blockships, which could offer a far more devastating attack than that of a conventional warship. With such a high concentration of war material in so dense an area, if a Merchant raider could sneak past the harbor forts disguised as an Allied vessel, they could barrage the harbor infrastructure and supply depots with deck guns in a surprise attack. A blockship attack was also greatly feared. The US Navy reported to the US Army harbor defense command that a scuttled enemy vessel in the outer harbor in deep water would take a minimum of thirty days to raise or clear. With the Ambrose Channel blocked, this would effectively bring the flow of supplies going overseas to a halt for a month.U.S. Army Harbor Defense of New York Annex Report, 1944. Therefore, maximum effort was taken to ensure that only Allied vessels would gain entrance to the harbors. As ships approached New York Harbor, they would be flashed a challenge code from the Advanced Harbor Entrance Control Post No. 1 via signal lamp; signal flags could also be used. Vessels that got their challenge code reply wrong, failed to follow protocol, or simply acted suspiciously, would be ordered to halt, pending an immediate investigation and inspection via boarding, conducted by the US Navy and/or US Coast Guard. This order would also be issued in conjunction from the examination vessel, anchored near the mouth of the Ambrose Channel. A US Navy destroyer or a US Coast Guard cutter would often be orbiting the area as a guard ship, supporting the Examination vessel.U.S. Army Harbor Defense of New York Annex Report, 1944 If a vessel still failed to stop, and ignored the Guard ship and Examination vessel, Battery Gunnison / New Peck would be been alerted via telephone by the Harbor Entrance Control Post No. 1; a description of the vessel's class, paint scheme, national flag flown, speed, and proximity to the nearest buoy in either the Ambrose or Sandy Hook Ship Channels. Observers in fire control towers assigned to Battery Gunnison / New Peck would immediately begin tracking the ship, and relaying information to the Battery's plotting room. Once the proper calculations were made, the ship would be brought under fire via \\"bring to\\" shots fired by the battery. These were warning shots using inert shells, fired well in front of the vessel, straight into the water, to get its attention with the shell splash. If the vessel still failed to heave- to at this time, Battery Peck would begin \\"destructive fire\\" with armor- piercing, high-explosive ammunition to neutralize the threat before it could get close enough to attack the harbor or scuttle in one of channels.U.S. Army Harbor Defense of New York Annex Report, 1944. The Jersey shore was considered a full war-zone during World War II, and operations at Fort Hancock were on a \\"Shoot First - Ask Later\\" mindset in dealing with potential threats. So tense was the nature of the defense, and so real the threat, that from September 1943, and September 1944, Battery Gunnison / New Peck would open fire on thirteen separate occasions.U.S. Army Harbor Defense of New York Annex Report, 1944. On each occasion, the vessels turned out to be Allied ships. The battery remained on 24-hour alert status through the end of World War 2. Battery New Peck was put into caretaker status following the end of World War II in 1945. It fired for the last time in 1948, when a Reserve Officer Training Corps Coast Artillery class came to Fort Hancock and performed annual summer target practice. Although the coastal defense component of Fort Hancock's history ended in 1948, it remained on active duty as an Air Defense Artillery post from the early 1950s to 1974 with anti-aircraft guns, and later on, Nike Ajax and Hercules missiles. In the early 1960s, the two M1900 guns and carriages were removed from the battery and brought down to a government storage facility in Maryland, pending their placement in a military museum that was yet to be built. The roof of now empty Battery Gunnison / New Peck structure was used as a recreational trap-shooting range for the soldiers at Fort Hancock. In 1974, Fort Hancock closed, and was ceded to the National Park Service as part of Gateway National Recreation Area. The two M1900 rifles and carriages were still in storage in Maryland, where they had been for nearly a decade; the museum where they were to be placed was never built. The National Park Service quickly worked with the US Army to have them returned, and the guns and carriages came home on a bitterly cold day in February 1976.Tom Hoffman, USNPS Fort Hancock Park Historian For the next 27 years, and stripped of all its original equipment save for the two shot hoists, sand, grit, salt corrosion, and vandalism took a heavy toll on the battery and the guns.

While other coastal batteries around the nation - Battery 519 at Ft Miles, DE; Battery Osgood-Farley, Ft. MacArthur, CA; Battery Worth, Ft. Casey, WA; as well as several others - have been well preserved, with some form of ordinance in their emplacements (non-correct display weaponry), or offer extensive museum displays of artifacts in the battery's rooms, only Battery Gunnison/New Peck is preserved and restored as a seacoast battery. It is also the only gun battery in the United States with its own Facebook Page and Instagram Account. https://www.instagram.com/battery_gunnison_new_peck/ Of all former concrete seacoast artillery emplacements in the United States, it is the only battery to offer the full spectrum of ammunition service, correct weaponry, and a working range section. Both guns have been restored so visitors can traverse (turn) the guns, and articulate the breech blocks. Original Army spotting telescopes dating to the 1940s allow visitors to view and track ships on the horizon. Internally, the battery is lit with original 100-year-old Army Corps of Engineers electrical fixtures. The powder and shell magazines are filled with inert (non-functioning) six inch shell bodies and powder canisters. In the Plotting Room, an M3 plotting board has been recreated, as well as other pre-computer devices for tabulating mathematical solutions for the guns. Visitors can talk to one another at all locations, as the telephone network has also been rebuilt, using vintage EE-91 Coast Artillery telephones.Battery Gunnison/New Peck Preserved: Visitors are invited to stop by to chat and learn more about restoration of Battery Gunnison/New Peck and the historic time period of July 1943 at Fort Hancock., NPS In the spring of 2017, a restoration milestone was achieved when the concrete ammunition bridges leading from the ammunition shot hoists to the gun platforms were reintroduced. In November 2017, the battery commander's station stairs were custom fabricated and installed. Another key project, the reintroduction of period-correct exterior lighting, which was begun in the summer of 2015, and was completed in October 2019.

The shock occurred in the Friuli region in northeast Italy near the town of Gemona del Friuli. 990 people were killed, up to about 3,000 were injured, and more than 157,000 were left homeless. Earthquake The quake struck at 21:00:13 (20:00:13 UTC). Seventy- seven villages in the Friuli region were affected. Gemona del Friuli was greatly damaged and despite extensive emergency measures and international aid by the end of 1976 15,000 people were still living in camping trailers, 1000 in tents and 25000 in evacuation centres. The damage was estimated at $4.25 million. Much of the town has since been reconstructed. The tremor was felt in Venice as well as neighboring Austria, Switzerland and Slovenia (at the time SFR Yugoslavia). In Slovenia, the upper Soƒça valley and the Brda area was particularly affected, with the village of Breginj nearly completely demolished. The earthquake damaged several buildings in Nova Gorica and was felt also in the Slovenian capital, Ljubljana. USGS ShakeMap showing the intensity of the 1976 Friuli earthquake The Italian Government nominated Chamber of Deputies member Giuseppe Zamberletti as coordinator of aid efforts on behalf of the regional administration. The national funds were assigned to the reconstruction of the damaged buildings by Zamberletti and the regional council of Friuli Venezia Giulia. From September to December 1976 all the earthquake victims were accommodated into prefabricated buildings, in order to better cope with the winter. Many local inhabitants lived in the Government supplied trailers for many years while homes were rebuilt. After Zamberletti's mandate the regional government of Friuli Venezia Giulia was able to completely rebuild many towns, thanks to an accurate resource management, however some towns took over a decade to fully recover. Nowadays, many years after the tragedy, the State's intervention, the earthquake management and reconstruction in Friuli Venezia Giulia are seen as a great example of efficiency and reliability.

Launched as the Cunard liner RMS Aurania she was requisitioned on the outbreak of war to serve as an armed merchant cruiser. Damaged by a U-boat while sailing with an Atlantic convoy, she was purchased outright and converted to a floating workshop, spending the rest of her life as a support ship for the navy. Peacetime career As one of the post-Great War \\"A-class\\" ocean liners, RMS Aurania was built by Swan Hunter and Wigham Richardson Ltd. at their Wallsend-on-Tyne yard for Cunard and launched on 6 February 1924. Her sisters included RMS Alaunia and RMS Ausonia. With the merger of Cunard and the White Star Line in 1933, she continued to serve with the resulting company, Cunard White Star Ltd. War career With war looming, she was requisitioned by the Admiralty on 30 August 1939 and converted to serve as an armed merchant cruiser, which involved the fitting of a number of guns. The conversion was completed on 2 October 1939. On completion of the work she entered service protecting trade sailing through the North Atlantic, covering the convoys. She was initially assigned to the Northern Patrol, followed by the Bermuda and Halifax Escort Force and then the North Atlantic Escort Force. Aurania lying in Rothesay Bay on 24 October 1941, after having been damaged in the Atlantic On 21 October 1941 she was sailing as an escort for convoy SL 89, bound from Halifax to the Clyde. She was straggling behind the convoy with a group of four other armed merchant cruisers and was sighted by , under the command of Reinhard Hardegen. At 04.28 hours he fired three torpedoes at her, two of them hitting the Aurania in the bow and under the bridge. The ship began to flood at the Number 3 hold, causing a list to port that eventually reached 25 degrees. The Auranias cargo of empty drums acted to keep her afloat, and the captain was able to reduce the list to 15 degrees and get underway again. Meanwhile, other convoy escorts had chased U-123 away from the scene. During the confusion a lifeboat had been launched containing six men, but it swamped upon hitting the water. One of the escorts, the Hunt class destroyer , picked up three of the men, but was unable to locate the others. Some hours later U-123 came across the sinking lifeboat, with a single survivor, and took him prisoner. Meanwhile, Aurania was escorted back to Rothesay Bay by the sloop , arriving on 23 October. The Germans claimed that she had been sunk. She was laid up, spending the period between November 1941 and March 1942 with Plymouth Command. She was bought outright by the Admiralty on 24 March 1942 and selected for conversion to a Heavy Repair Ship. Work began that December and lasted until July 1944. She was commissioned in August as HMS Artifex and after carrying out trials was prepared for service in the Pacific theatre. She sailed to join the British Pacific Fleet in early 1945, and by March was being deployed out of Manus in the Admiralty Islands, supporting the ships of Task Force 57. Artifex took passage to Leyte on 19 April to support ships involved in the attacks against the airfields in the Sakishima-Gunto Islands. She remained here throughout April and much of May, sailing for Manus again on 20 May. She remained here for the rest of the war. On being released from the British Pacific Fleet in September she sailed back to Britain. Postwar Artifex was kept in commission after her return and was assigned to the training establishment at Rosyth, which was used to train artificer apprentices. She remained here as a training ship until 1955, when she was paid off and reduced to the reserve. She continued to be based at Caledonia though as a tender. She was finally laid up at the Dockyard and placed on the disposal list. HMS Artifex was sold for scrapping to BISCO on 28 December 1960 and departed Rosyth under tow on 7 January 1961, bound for the shipbreakers at Spezia.

Name Dre≈ænica was first mentioned in written sources in 1178 as Dresnitz and Dresniz (and in 1291 as Dresnica, and in 1351 as Dresnize). The name is a univerbized form derived from *Drƒôz≈æ—åna voda (literally, 'forest creek') or *Drƒôz≈æ—åna v—ås—å (literally, 'forest village'), derived from the Slavic word *drƒôzga 'forest, thicket'. Place names of similar origin include Dre≈ænik and Dresden.Snoj, Marko. 2009. Etimolo≈°ki slovar slovenskih zemljepisnih imen. Ljubljana: Modrijan and Zalo≈æba ZRC, p. 127.  History  In 1747, the Parish of Dre≈ænica was founded. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, it was a prosperous village with more than 1,000 inhabitants. During that time, the current church was built on the site of a previous, smaller one. At the outbreak of World War I, most of the inhabitants were evacuated to the interior of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In the first months after the Italian attack on Austria-Hungary, the village was occupied by Italian troops and the rest of the inhabitants were sent to internment camps in Italy, where many died of malnutrition and bad conditions. The village was almost completely destroyed during the Battles of the Isonzo, but the church remained completely intact. After the war, in 1918, it was occupied by Italian troops and annexed to Italy in 1920. Between 1920 and 1941, many locals emigrated abroad, mostly to Argentina and Yugoslavia, and the number of inhabitants dropped significantly. During World War II, especially after the Italian armistice, the area was an important center of Slovenian partisan resistance. Between September 10 and November 1, Dre≈ænica was part of the liberated territory, known as the Kobarid Republic, administered by the local anti-Fascist resistance (composed by partisans, former TIGR members, and unaffiliated insurgents). In November 1943, it was occupied by Nazi German forces, but the Partisan resistance remained strong in the surrounding mountainous area around Mount Krn. In 1945, it was liberated by the Partisans and put under Yugoslav military administration. Between June 1945 and September 1947, Dre≈ænica was cut off from Kobarid, which was put under Anglo-American military administration. This caused a severe economic crisis and many people emigrated from the village, either to the nearby Anglo-American zone, to Tolmin, or to the interior of Slovenia. In September 1947, it was officially annexed to Yugoslavia and included in the Socialist Republic of Slovenia. Church Facade and north side of Sacred Heart Church (2017) The main attraction in the village is the church, dedicated to the Sacred Heart.

Parts of it lie within the city limits of La Habra, Buena Park, and La Mirada, with most of it sprawling across western Fullerton between Ralph B. Clark Regional Park and Euclid Street north of Rosecrans Avenue. The foothill region to the east and south is known as Sunny Hills. There is also an East Coyote Hills area, on the east side of Fullerton, that has been almost completely developed for residential real estate. The remaining open-space area is currently the subject of a long-running dispute over residential development, pitting conservationists against a pro-development majority on the city council. A division of Chevron is currently proposing to develop the portions of the land that are suitable for development, while leaving the remainder as open space. Name The hills received their name from the nearby Rancho Los Coyotes; by the 1870s they were being called Coyote Hills. The name is appropriate, since coyotes do inhabit the area. Development The West Coyote Hills was once a major oil field, dating back to 1890. Extraction has long since ceased, and most of the West Coyote Hills has been developed for residential and commercial use, as well as West Coyote Hills Park.

Eucalyptus trees and buckwheat in a meadow in Coyote Hills. Plant life The undeveloped areas of Coyote Hills are vegetated with coastal sage scrub.Schad, Afoot and afield in Orange County, Wilderness Press, 1996, p. 5Schoenherr, Wild and beautiful: a natural history of open spaces in Orange County Native species include buckwheat and prickly pear. Nonnative plants include pepper trees, tobacco trees, and mustard. There are no creeks, except for ephemeral freshets after storms, and no native riparian species such as oaks. Mature eucalyptus trees and some pine trees grow along some of the fence lines, where the area abuts housing tracts and the city's trail system. Topography The area has been modified by large earth-moving projects to reduce the number of steep hills and canyons, allowing Gilbert Street to be constructed and real estate developments and later a golf course to be built on the west side of Gilbert. East of Gilbert Street, the undeveloped area consists mainly of a large, sun-exposed, gentle north-facing slope. The larger area west of Gilbert contains rugged terrain, predominantly south-facing slopes, and a large, long, dry, flat-bottomed canyon that runs north-south. The canyon bottom has been paved, and provides a fire road accessible from the nearby fire station on Rosecrans Avenue. The steep sides of the canyon were terraced and networked with asphalt roads for oil drilling. Impressive cliffs are a landmark visible to motorists on Rosecrans Avenue.

Fossils U.S. Geological Survey researchers have found invertebrate fossils representing 184 taxa from 158 localities in the \\"San Pedro\\" Formation in the Coyote Hills, including various species of annelids, mollusks, arthropods, and echinoids; the fossils suggest a late Pliocene to early Pleistocene age for outcrops of the formation. The occurrence of the bivalve Solamen columbianum in the area marks its first occurrence as a fossil.

World Tour (sometimes referred to as the I Am... Tour) was the fourth concert tour by American recording artist Beyonc√© Knowles launched in support of her third studio album, I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008). The tour was announced in October 2008 embarked in March 2009 with five rehearsal shows in North America. The tour consisted of 108 shows in total, visiting the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia. Preparations for the shows began eight months prior to the beginning of the tour with twelve-hour rehearsals for two months. Knowles described the shows as her best and most theatrical from all of her tours. The set list for the concerts included songs from Knowles' three studio albums as well as several covers of other artists and a Destiny's Child medley. The central theme of the tour was to showcase the difference between Knowles' dual personality; her emotional side and her onstage persona, Sasha Fierce which was also demonstrated in the dual album I Am... Sasha Fierce. The show featured two stages ‚Äì the main one and a smaller B-stage where Knowles was transferred during the middle of the show. She was backed by an all-female band, female background dancers and a big LED screen. Thierry Mugler collaborated with Knowles on the costumes and had a creative advisor role further working on the choreography, lighting and production. Chris March made the costumes usable for stage and helped in their making. For the ballads, Knowles wore longer dresses while for the performances of the up-tempo songs, more make-up and more revealing outfits were worn. The fashion and Knowles' look and figure received praise from critics. I Am... received acclaim from music critics who praised Knowles' performance abilities calling her the best female performer. A concert in Malaysia was cancelled by Knowles after several Muslim groups tried to ban it although she agreed to tone down her look according to the country's standards. The tour was commercially successful grossing $86.0 million from 93 shows in total. Separate performances of several songs were broadcast on different channels and two concerts were released as live albums; the live performance at the I Am... Yours revue was released in a CD/DVD format in 2009 and footage of the tour was released on the similarly titled live album in 2010. Background In 2006, during an interview with MTV News, Beyonc√© introduced an aggressive alter ego, Sasha Fierce, which also served as her stage persona. She added that the persona is a complete opposite of her when not performing by characterizing her as \\"aggressive... strong... fearless.\\" Beyonc√©'s third album I Am... Sasha Fierce introduced Sasha Fierce as her alter ego. she revealed that Sasha was born during the making of her single \\"Crazy in Love\\" (2003). The plans for a 2009 tour in support of the album were announced in October 2008 by Billboard magazine. The tour dates for the European leg were announced in December 2008. During an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Beyonc√© confirmed that she would be backed by the all-female band which had also accompanied her for her previous The Beyonc√© Experience tour (2007). Rehearsals for the tour lasted eight months during which the set list for the shows was also constructed. Beyonc√© further revealed that the twelve-hour rehearsals for the tour included dancing the choreography in heels for two months before it commenced. During an interview, Beyonc√© emphasized how she needed to prepare to channel her alter ego for the performances. According to Beyonc√©, the shows were supposed to be a mixture of several of her musical preferences, including jazz, hip- hop, ballet and fashion. The tour kicked off in late-March 2009 with five rehearsal shows in North America. It officially commenced in late April 2009, at Arena Zagreb in Croatia later visiting six continents, namely the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia. The six-week North American leg of the I Am... tour kicked off on June 21 with a show at Madison Square Garden in New York and finished with a four-night residency at Encore in the Wynn Las Vegas from July 30, 2009 to August 2, 2009. The tour finished with a concert at Queen's Park Savannah in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, with 108 shows in total. Beyonc√© and her organization, The Survivor Foundation, became the spokesperson for General Mills' Hamburger Helper campaign entitled, \\"Show Your Helping Hand\\". The campaign's mission was to provide more than 3.5 million meals to local food banks in North America. Knowles encouraged spectators to bring non-perishable foods to her North American concerts to be donated to the campaign. According to the campaign's official website, nearly three millions meals and over $50,000 have been donated. Development Beyonc√© revealed that the hardest aspect of coming up with the tour's set list was managing to fit her decade-long song catalogue in a two-hour show. According to her, the tour was supposed to be more emotional than The Beyonc√© Experience in order to reflect the \\"real[,] raw and more sensitive\\" nature of the I Am... portion of the double album. Beyonc√© expressed frustration that snippets of the show appeared online after the first shows on the opening leg, thus \\"ruining\\" the surprise factor of the concert experience; however she also appreciated the fact that it can act as a \\"little sneak peek\\" for fans to decide if they indeed want to attend. French designer Thierry Mugler served as the creative advisor while also being responsible for Beyonc√©'s wardrobe. He contributed in the design of lighting, choreography, production and directed three sequences for the concert. According to his creative vision, the shows were intended to represent mise-en-sc√®ne by incorporating technical aspects with fashion in order to capture the emotions behind the songs. He added, \\"There will be a lot of dramatization and metamorphosis on stage. Some very strong effects have been inspired directly by Beyonc√©, and only she could make [them] happen on stage.\\" Onstage, Beyonc√© was backed by her ten-piece all-female band, Suga Mama, which included two drummers, two keyboardists, a percussionist, a horn section, three backup vocalists called the Mamas, and a lead guitarist. The show featured two stages, namely a simple main stage with a pop0up set of stairs, an LED background screen, and glass risers for Suga Mama and The Mamas as well as a smaller B-stage in the midst of the audience for the later portions of the show. During the concerts, Beyonc√© went through six costume changes; during the breaks, The Mamas harmonized. The set list included songs from all of Beyonc√©'s three studio albums that had been published, a Destiny's Child medley and several covers of other artists. Several critics noted that the songs on the set list were divided into ballads and more up-tempo songs to coincide with the central theme of I Am... Sasha Fierce ‚Äì the dual personality of Beyonc√©. Beyonc√©'s costumes were changed in order to coincide with the songs' nature; during performances of ballads, she wore longer white dresses while for the uptempo songs, she had more revealing outfits and make-up. Fashion Thierry Mugler design sketches for the wardrobe of the I Am... tour. The words \\"Feminine. Free. Warrior. Fierce\\" were used as inspiration for the look during the concerts. Thierry Mugler served as the main costume designer for the tour. Beyonc√© was acquainted to and enraptured by his work at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute Gala, titled \\"Superheroes, Fashion and Fantasy\\" (2008) where she saw several of his haute couture pieces that were on display. Beyonc√© discussed the possibility of using the costumes with Tina Knowles. She met with Mugler in Paris in September of the same year and started exchanging ideas for costume designs and the following month he was contracted as the designer for the tour. While designing, the main concept Mugler wanted to illustrate was the duality between \\"being a woman and a warrior\\" through his own creative perception; the words \\"Feminine. Free. Warrior. Fierce\\" were the overarching inspiration. He felt, \\"Sasha Fierce is another aspect of Beyonc√©'s personality, she is Fierce on stage and Beyonc√© in real life... Beyonc√© is a very sophisticated 'stage animal', which means that she is truly instinctive. Beyonc√© expresses herself through the two aspects of her personality.\\" Furthermore, the elaborate costumes were related to the meanings of the songs performed. A seventy one piece wardrobe was designed for Beyonc√© and her dancers and band. For the shows, Beyonc√© adopted ten different looks. American fashion designer Chris March also worked with Mugler ensuring the costumes were suitable for stage purposes. On July 23, 2009, March filed a lawsuit against Mugler for allegedly not paying him for the work he did on the wardrobe. Metal pieces, fishnets, gloves, power shoulders and golden leotards were all incorporated in the costumes, the majority of which were form-fitting and exposed the singer's legs. Michael Quintanilla of San Antonio Express-News thought the fashion was akin to a \\"high-tech Blade Runner world\\". For the performance of several songs, Beyonc√© also wore leopard-print pants and glow- in-the-dark bra with a blinking beacon affixed to her body. The fashion and Beyonc√©'s look during the shows received praise from critics. Randall King of the Winnipeg Free Press noted that the fashion was inspired by \\"1970s space movie\\" fashion by Bob Mackie. Alice Jones of The Independent noted: \\"[the list of] 30 songs introduces us to any number of different Beyonc√©s ‚Äì showgirl, balladeer, feminist, rock chick, gangster queen, cyborg ‚Äì via off-stage costume changes and a leotard for every mood\\". Kathy McCabe of The Daily Telegraph noted that the shows featured \\"some of the most elaborate and revealing costumes of her career\\" thus far. A writer of the Evening Chronicle wrote that the sparkling outfits managed to capture the singer's personality with looks ranging from \\"NYPD cop to bride to Wonderwoman and beyond\\" all the while emphasizing her physique. Holly Burnes of The Daily Telegraph also praised the fashion writing that the singer's look included \\"one incredible costume after another: from a Mad Max look... to an angelic wedding dress Jay Hanna of The Sunday Times compared Beyonc√©'s look to a goddess, particularly with the costume she wore for \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\". Concert synopsis The show started with Beyonc√©'s silhouette appearing on a smoky stage, walking towards the front while singing several lines of \\"D√©j√† Vu\\". Dressed in a gold leotard and stilettos, she was quickly joined by two dancers in catsuits proceeding to perform \\"Crazy in Love\\"; during the performance of the song glitter and confetti were dropped on stage. \\"Naughty Girl\\" was performed next as bright orange lights were displayed on stage. For the performance of \\"Freakum Dress\\", Beyonc√© was accompanied by a guitarist onstage, bending backwards during the song's bridge. \\"Get Me Bodied\\" followed, for which the singer was engaging in elaborate dance routines with her background dancers. Following a short break, Beyonc√© proceeded singing songs from the I Am... portion of the album, dressed in a white leotard. \\"Smash Into You\\" was performed on top of a flight of stairs. For \\"Ave Maria\\", her background dancers turned her white dress into a wedding gown by attaching a veil to her head. Excerpts of Sarah McLachlan's \\"Angel\\" and Franz Schubert's Ave Maria\\" were performed at the end. She continued on to sing \\"Broken-Hearted Girl\\" wearing a white bustier with a sheer, flowing wrap. Outtakes from the music video of \\"If I Were a Boy\\" were Beyonc√© appeared to perform the aforementioned song dressed as a cop wearing Ray-Bans and a leather breastplate. Excerpts from Alanis Morissette's \\"You Oughta Know\\" and Tupac Shakur's \\"California Love\\" were incorporated in the middle of the song.Music World Entertainment (2010) Beyonc√© ‚Äì I Am... World Tour (Liner Notes) Columbia Records. A video interlude directed by Melina Matsoukas was shown set to \\"Sweet Dreams\\". The video showed a robotic Beyonc√© interacting with a cheetah as a mechanical voice intoned Sasha Fierce. Beyonc√© then appeared on stage dressed in a leopard-print leotard to perform \\"Diva\\". She appeared at the top of the staircase with her backup female dancers; a video interlude showing a five-year old Beyonc√© singing and dancing was shown in the middle of the song. She then sang \\"Radio\\" while the clip of her dancing as ac child was still projected on the screen. \\"Me, Myself and I\\" was introduced with a brief speech about female empowerment. \\"Ego\\" and \\"Hello\\" were performed afterwards. The show continued with a short medley performed by her backup singers, The Mamas, followed by another video interlude, featuring Sasha Fierce. Beyonc√© appeared on stage after a gong bang; she was lifted out of a 20-foot train by a harness and performed \\"Baby Boy\\" while high-stepping and front-flipping above the audience. She was then lowered to the B-stage where she finished the song and continued with a cover Dawn Penn's \\"You Don't Love Me (No, No, No)\\". A stripped-down version of \\"Irreplaceable\\" was sung afterwards with frequent crowd interactions. Beyonc√© then continued with \\"Check On It\\" and a medley of Destiny's Child hits including \\"Bootylicious\\", \\"Jumpin' Jumpin'\\", \\"Independent Women\\", \\"Bills, Bills, Bills\\" and \\"Survivor\\". Performances of \\"Upgrade U\\" and \\"Video Phone\\" followed. For the performance of the two songs, Beyonc√© was accompanied by two female dancers and three male dancers, one of whom recorded a live stream of her with a camera throughout the routine during the performance of the latter song. This was followed by a rendition of \\"Say My Name\\" where she interacted with members of the audience, asking them to say her name. The concert followed back at the main stage where for the penultimate section, Beyonc√© appeared wearing a gown and singing \\"At Last\\". A footage of her performance of the song at Barack Obama's inauguration as President of the United States, video images of civil rights era footage and snippets from her performance of the song in the movie, Cadillac Records (2008) were shown on the screen behind here. \\"Listen\\" was performed afterwards. This was followed by a YouTube video interlude featuring imitations of the choreography of \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\" performed by fans as well as Barack Obama and Justin Timberlake. Beyonc√© then performed the song's trademark choreography accompanied by two female back-up dancers. For the finale, an extended version of \\"Halo\\" was performed while the singer descended from the stage to shake hands with fans in the front rows. She then went to the top of the staircase and repeatedly said \\"I am\\", awaiting the crowd to say it back. The letters \\"I am... yours\\" were displayed on the screen as she exited the stage. Critical response The tour received rave reviews from critics. Mike Ross of the website Jam! rated Beyonc√©'s performance with 4.5 out of 5 stars, praising the \\"high-production\\", the singer's wide vocal range and her \\"riveting presence\\". Stephanie Classen of The Star Phoenix remarked, \\"Beyonc√© doesn't really need the bells and whistles of a big stadium show, but it sure makes for an unforgettable concert.\\" Randall King of the Winnipeg Free Press graded the tour 4 stars out of 5 and praised the \\"back and forth\\" switch between the double persona throughout the show with the singer exhibiting both \\"raw energy\\" and \\"feeling\\"-induced ballads. Alice Jones of The Independent emphasized how the singer managed to \\"sing her heart out\\" in various musical styles that characterze the show's songs while further praising the energetic choreography and the vocals that range from \\"caramel smooth to honeyed foghorn\\". She concluded her review by saying, \\"Watching Beyonc√© sing and strut her stuff can feel at best overawing, at worst, alienating\\". Ben Ratliff of The New York Times observed that the show would make spectators question themselves how the singer managed to put on a \\"dazzling show\\" both physically and organizationally; he further praised the singer's \\"hollering voice, her imperious movement, her costume changes and the show's crush of concepts with their long tails of reference\\". Deborah Mcaleese and Lauren Mulvenny of The Belfast Telegraph described the show as \\"incredible... mind blowing... [and] electrifying\\". A writer of Evening Chronicle wrote that the show's set abounded with \\"bling, glamour and, most importantly, enthusiasm\\", further praising her for the well-coordinated balance between \\"hit[ting] every note\\" and following elaborate choreographies. Jay Hanna of The Sunday Times felt that the show's encore (\\"Halo\\") was the most memorable moment of the set. She also praised the singer's \\"enviable\\" dancing skills, \\"spectacular production and audio visuals\\" but noted that some songs \\"let down\\" the performance by being less melodic. Jay Lustig of The Star-Ledger described the show as a \\"bona fide pop spectacle\\" with futuristic themes throughout. Jim Farber from the Daily News viewed the tour as \\"a huge upgrade in charm, humor and chops\\" as compared to The Beyonc√© Experience and added that \\"Beyonc√©'s presence punctuated her singing like an exclamation point\\". Describing the show as simultaneously \\"spellbinding, exhausting to watch and hugely slick\\", Michael Cragg of musicOMH noted that the highlights included songs from the Sasha Fierce half of the album. Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone magazine praised the show, lauding the singer for her work ethic and the ability to execute singing, dancing and posing at the same time. Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News, commented \\"Through six outfit changes, bombastic ballads, high-energy singles and a daring high-wire journey from the stage to the center of the arena, Beyonc√© delivered over and over again.\\" A writer of Billboard magazine noted that Knowles \\"brought all the fierceness\\" on stage for the tour. The Australians Patrick Emery noted that Knowles showcased her self-assurance and professionalism in \\"full view\\". Comparing her performance with Michael Jackson's live shows, Renee Michelle Harris of the South Florida Times writes, \\"[Knowles] owns the stage with her trademark swagger and intensity... showcasing her powerful vocals without missing a note, often while engaged in vigorous, perfectly executed dance moves\\". Holly Burnes of The Daily Telegraph noted that the performance was almost inimitable and added \\"Whether crumping, sweeping across the stage in towering heels, or simply standing still, Beyonce was dynamite, blasting the benchmark for concert performers forever\\". Simon Colling from The West Australian described the performance as \\"powerhouse\\" and added, \\"Beyonce's high-energy, high-voltage mix of song (loud, commercial R&B;) and dance recalled names like Tina Turner, Aretha Franklin and rapper Missy Elliott... [and] Mariah Carey\\". Joanna Horowitz of The Seattle Times noted that despite the inclusion of almost 10 different musical styles in the show's set list, the singer's \\"own [musical] signature\\" and focus were lacking. Nevertheless, Horowitz praised the singer's performing skills and summarized the concert as \\"a hip-hop Cirque du Soleil ‚Äî sequins galore, dramatic dance numbers, and Beyonc√© at one point soaring\\". The Observers Barbara Ellen wrote, \\"she is a force of nature ‚Äì delivering one of the most enjoyable well-paced shows I've seen in years\\". However, she noted that Knowles is \\"so steeped in professionalism that what should be magical can become mechanical.\\" Noting influences by Tina Turner and Barbra Streisand during the tour, Ann Powers of Los Angeles Times writes: \\"And she danced like only Beyonce can dance, with a combination of power, grace and smarts that fully unites Broadway choreography with urban street innovations ... Indeed, her production can be seen as a retelling of pop's history from a feminine viewpoint -- and as an argument for Beyonce as the ultimate realization of the female pop dream.\\" Ben Ratliff of The New York Times summarized the tour's concept as \\"the duality of well-meaning good girl and rapacious animal-robot- dance-titan.\\" Jay Lustig of The Star-Ledger concluded that the album's split personality was reflected in the show naturally enough. However, Barbara Ellen of The Observer wrote, \\"Another irritant is the much-trumpeted 'duality' nonsense with Sasha Fierce, Beyonc√©'s alter-ego for her latest album. All 'Sasha' does here is flail about in a video, no different from regular Beyonc√©, except for a gold dress and a hairdo that veers dangerously towards Liberace.\\" Similarly, Ann Powers from the Los Angeles Times wrote that the only thing which was not fully realized was the show's \\"overarching\\" theme, \\"Beyonce meant to represent herself as a split personality, tender and open on the one hand, indomitable and rather scary on the other. But Beyonce has chosen the wrong dichotomy to represent herself.\\" Commercial performance Tickets for the American leg of the tour were available for pre-sale for members of Knowles' fan club on April 20, 2008 and the official tickets went on sale to the general public through Ticketmaster on April 25. In late May 2009, Knowles' label announced through a press release that the singer decided to set aside 2,000 seats for each date on her then-forthcoming North American tour at a discounted price of $20. After already selling 1,000 tickets per show for the special low price, the last 1,000 discounted seats for each show were made available to the public on May 29, 2009 through Ticketmaster (with the exception of the artist's four-night residency at the Encore at Wynn Las Vegas). Due to the big demand, Sony Music announced additional dates in England, Asia and South America. In May 2009, Knowles' official website was peppered with requests by disappointed fans ‚Äî from Boston; Anchorage, Alaska; Tampa, Florida; St. Louis and Montreal ‚Äî who asked from her to come to their towns. Knowles broke her record of concert attendees by selling out the Morumbi Stadium in S√£o Paulo, Brazil, with over 60,000 tickets sold. It was reported to Billboard that as of September 16, 2009, from the 53 shows, Knowles grossed $53.5 million and drawn 667,509 fans from the mostly 15,000-seat arenas. In 2009, the tour was nominated for Eventful Fans' Choice Award at the 6th Annual Billboard Touring Awards. The tour grossed $86 million from 93 concert shows and 108 show total grossed $119,5 million. Controversy in Malaysia In September 2009, it was announced by the Associated Press that Knowles would be bringing her show to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia on October 25, 2009, but it would be without some of her usual tricks. After encountering what became familiar opposition from religious groups in a predominantly Muslim country, Knowles agreed to tone down some parts of her act. A spokesperson for the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party stated: \\"We are against Western sexy performances; we don't think our people need that.\\" However, a rep soon came from the concert's Malaysian organizer, stating that \\"all parties have reached an amicable understanding\\" about the performance. He went on saying that Knowles should be regarded as a \\"role model\\" and an \\"embodiment of success\\" because of her philanthropic work, including campaigns against poverty and domestic violence. The Marctensia promoter further told the Associated Press: \\"We are confident that Beyonc√©'s concert will once and for all silence international critics and put Malaysia back on track and move up the ranks in presenting A-list international pop concerts in this region and further boost tourism.\\" However, it was ultimately announced in October 2009 that the concert has been postponed in the wake of accusations by Islamic conservatives that the show would be \\"immoral and unclean\\". Malaysian promoter Marctensia said in a statement that the show has been postponed to a future date to be announced shortly, and added \\"The postponement is solely [the] decision of the artist and has nothing to with other external reasons.\\" Another representative declined to comment on whether the show was postponed due to the heavy criticism it was receiving from religious leaders in the country. The show also faced oppositions by Islamic conservatives in Egypt who branded it as an \\"insolent sex party\\" that threatens the Muslim nation's \\"social peace and stability\\" and tried to encourage people against going to the concert. Two years prior to the performance, Knowles scheduled a show in Malaysia but backed out due to similar protests regarding her performance. Recordings and broadcasts Knowles performing \\"Crazy in Love\\" with Jay-Z during the I Am... tour stop at The O2 arena in London While Knowles was on tour, she was asked to perform a Las Vegas residency-type of show. Knowles and her team produced the shows in seven days and entitled it I Am... Yours. She performed an unplugged, acoustic styled show different from the rest of her tour, at the Encore Theater in Las Vegas. The show on August 2, 2009 was recorded and later released as a DVD, audio CD and television special in late November 2009 titled I Am... Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas. The DVD was commercially successful peaking at number one on the Nielsen SoundScan Music DVD chart. It was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Another live CD/DVD of the tour was released as I Am... World Tour in late November 2010. The album contained performances from different stops of the tour blended with personal footage of Knowles' backstage work and thoughts about the tour and her life. It served as the directorial debut for Knowles. The DVD was commercially successful becoming the best selling DVD in the world in 2010. Parts of the show in Vancouver on March 31, 2009 were recorded and have been used for commercial use, as well as photos from the show used in the official tour book and other promotional items. \\"If I Were A Boy\\" and \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\" from the show in New Orleans were recorded and shown on TV One as a part of the Essence Music Festival in 2009.

The principle is to measure the weight of drops of a fluid of interest falling from a capillary glass tube, and thereby calculate the surface tension of the fluid. We can determine the weight of the falling drops by counting them. From it we can determine the surface tension. http://www.fpharm.uniba.sk/fileadmin/user_upload/english/Fyzika/The_surface_tension_of_liquids_measured_with_the_stalagmometer.pdf  Stalagmometer  A stalagmometer, straight form. A stalagmometer is a device for investigating surface tension using the stalagmometric method. It is also called a stactometer or stalogometer. The device is a capillary glass tube whose middle section is widened. The volume of a drop can be predetermined by the design of the stalagmometer. The lower end of the tube is narrowed to force the fluid to fall out of the tube as a drop.http://history.nih.gov/exhibits/galleries/instrument/2.html In an experiment, the drops of fluid flow slowly from the tube in a vertical direction. The drops hanging on the bottom of the tube start to fall when the volume of the drop reaches a maximum value that is dependent on the characteristics of the solution. At this moment, the weight of the drops is in equilibrium state with the surface tension. Based on Tate‚Äôs law:T. Tate, Phil. Mag. 22, 176 (1864). \\\\ mg=2\\\\pi r \\\\sigma The drop falls when the weight (mg) is equal to the circumference (2œÄr) multiplied by the surface tension (œÉ). The surface tension can be calculated provided the radius of the tube (r) and mass of the fluid droplet (m) are known. Alternatively, since the surface tension is proportional to the weight of the drop, the fluid of interest may be compared to a reference fluid of known surface tension (typically water): \\\\frac {m_1}{\\\\sigma_1}=\\\\frac {m_2}{\\\\sigma_2} In the equation, m1 and œÉ1 represent the mass and surface tension of the reference fluid and m2 and œÉ2 the mass and surface tension of the fluid of interest. If we take water as a reference fluid, \\\\sigma=\\\\sigma_{H_2O}\\\\times\\\\frac {m}{m_{H_2O}} If the surface tension of water is known which is 72 dyne/cm, we can calculate the surface tension of the specific fluid from the equation. The more drops we weigh, the more precisely we can calculate the surface tension from the equation. The stalagmometer must be kept clean for meaningful readings. There are commercial tubes for stalagmometric method in three sizes: 2.5, 3.5, and 5.0 (ml). The 2.5-ml size is suitable for small volumes and low viscosity, that of 3.5 (ml) for relatively viscous fluids, and that of 5.0 (ml) for large volumes and high viscosity. The 2.5-ml size is suitable for most fluids.http://www.wilmad- labglass.com/group/1632  Modified method  The stalagmometric method was improved by S. V. Chichkanov and colleagues, who measured the weight of a fixed number of drops rather than counting the drops. This method for determining the surface tension may be more precise than the original method, especially for fluids whose surface is highly active.

It is native to the deserts of the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, where it grows amongst desert shrubs. This is an annual herb producing a slender, spidery erect stem to about 70 centimeters in maximum length. The leaves are lance-shaped to oblong with rippled edges and roughly pointed ends. Most of the leaves grow near the base of the plant. The inflorescences appear at the ends of the slim stem branches. They bear a few pale pink flowers, each just a few millimeters long, with adjacent reddish or pinkish bracts.

Charke was born in London. He initially worked as a dancing-master before being appointed by Colley Cibber as leader of the orchestra at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1729. Soon thereafter, he began performing as a solo violinist and singing in small roles at the theatre. He eventually graduated to lead roles in the musical productions at Drury Lane, starring in such productions as Henry Carey‚Äôs The Contrivances (1729) and Cibber‚Äôs Damon and Phillida (1729). Charke possessed a good sense of humor and had a talent for wit, which he ultimately made use of in pantomimes, mostly as a composer but also as a writer. He wrote several amusing \\"Medley Overtures\\" that became highly popular for pantomime performances during the 1730s and 1740s. He authored only one pantomime, Harlequin Restored, or, The Country Revels, which contained music by both himself and Thomas Arne and premiered at Drury Lane on 14 December 1732 (although the Burney Collection of newspapers showing contemporary playbills give the date as 20 March 1732). In addition to his contribution to pantomimes, Charke composed one ballad opera, The Festival, which premiered in 1734 and starred Susannah Maria Cibber. He also contributed songs to W.R. Chetwood's The Lovers Opera (1729) and The Generous Freemason (1730), and to James Miller's The Humours of Oxford (1730). Charke's private life was somewhat tragic. In 1730, he married his manager's youngest daughter, Charlotte Cibber, with whom he quarreled incessantly. Only a few months into their marriage, he began to pursue affairs with other women. He also had a penchant for gambling and for spending money frivolously. In the summer of 1736, he fled England for Jamaica in order to avoid his gambling debts and debtor's prison. He became ill shortly after arriving in Jamaica, dying in either late 1737 or early 1738. Sources *Roger Fiske and Linda Troost: \\"Richard Charke\\", Grove Music Online ed. L.

It was established in Chapter 2 of the 1998 amendments to the Higher Education Act of 1965 which awarded financial assistance to students and colleges from the federal government. GEAR UP was authored by Congressman Chaka Fattah and signed into law by President Bill Clinton in October, 1998.  Purpose  The goal of GEAR UP is to increase the number of these students who matriculate into in-state public universities. The grant operates on a six-year grant program. The grants are divided into two groups: state grants and partnership grants. State grants must include a plan to contact students prior to the prospective students arriving as university students. The plan must show an intention to increase the rate of college-going for low-income students in addition to providing a scholarship to students. In addition, it must prepare students to succeed at the college level. Partnership grants have the same goals, however, they are only required to fulfill the early intervention component. Partnership grants may support scholarship efforts for low-income students as well. Both grant types work to assist cohorts of students, beginning in the seventh grade. This cohort is followed by the grant program throughout high school, with some students receiving scholarships to help them attend in-state public universities. For a State agency to be eligible to apply for a GEAR UP grant, the agency must be designated by the governor of that State. Each state may only apply for up to one GEAR UP grant at a time. For partnership grants, applying partnerships must consist of \\"one or more local educational agencies and one or more degree-granting institutions of higher education and not less than two other community organizations or other entities such as businesses, professional organizations, or state agencies\\" to be eligible. Unlike state grants, partnerships may apply for, and receive, multiple partnership grants concurrently. All applicants are able to access Grants.gov to retrieve the application (that may be downloaded and completed offline) and then upload the complete application back to the website. Applicants that are awarded grants (\\"grantees\\") are required to submit annual performance reports to ensure that their implementation of these funds falls in line with the mission of the US Department of Education. Nationally, GEAR UP programs have at least helped to spur some interest about college in low-income communities. in 2006, 66 percent of student survey respondents had spoken with someone about college entrance requirements. Of this same population, 55% of students were able to speak with someone about the availability of financial aid. Funding for the program has grown in recent years, increasing from $301,639,000 in fiscal year 2015, to $322,754,000 in fiscal year 2016, to 339,752,985 in fiscal year 2017. On March 21, 2018, Congress agreed to increase the national funding for GEAR UP programs by 2.9 percent.  Early Intervention and College Awareness Program  The GEAR UP chapter focuses heavily on the Early Intervention and College Awareness Program. This program provides a guarantee of financial aid to low-income students who have obtained a secondary diploma or its equivalent.Watt, K., Huerta, J., Lozano, A. (2007). \\"A comparison study of AVID and GEAR UP 10th-grade students in two high schools in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas.\\" Journal of Education for Students Placed at Risk. 12(2). 185-212. doi:1080/10824660701261136.x. The program was also designed to aid students in elementary and high school to be aware of the benefits of higher education, and to reach the educational level necessary to attend an institute of higher education. Institutions eligible for grant money include states, partnerships between middle schools, high schools, colleges and universities, and community organizations and businesses. The grant also stipulates that at least 50% of the participants must be eligible for free or reduced-price lunch, or are at or below 150% of the Federal poverty level.Watt, K., Huerta, J., Lozano, A. (2007). \\"A comparison study of AVID and GEAR UP 10th-grade students in two high schools in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas.\\" Journal of Education for Students Placed at Risk. 12(2). 185-212. doi:1080/10824660701261136.x. Each entity devises its own plan, submits the plan to the Secretary of Education, and evaluates the plan on a biennial basis. The submitted plan must describe the activities to be implemented and provide the necessary assurances that the grant money will be matched by the entity; Other existing programs will not be undermined by the new plan or any of the conclusive evaluation results. Eligible entities must implement the plan so it impacts students for the first time no later than their seventh grade year, therefore many programs are initiated in middle schools and extended to the associated high school. Entities receiving grant money are given a fair amount of autonomy. Each plan is devised and implemented independent of other entities. However, each plan must include comprehensive mentoring, counseling, outreach, and supportive services, including financial aid counseling, providing information and activities regarding college admissions, achievement tests, and application procedures, and improving parental involvement. Funds can support identification of at-risk children, after school and summer tutoring, assistance in obtaining summer jobs, academic counseling, volunteer and parent involvement, providing former or current scholarship recipients as mentor or peer counselors, skills assessment, providing access to rigorous core courses that reflect challenging academic standards, personal counseling, family counseling and home visits, staff development, programs for students of limited English proficiency, and summer programs for remedial, developmental or supportive purposes. For students who successfully complete the middle school and high school programs, there are scholarships available. In order to be eligible for this students must be less than 22 years of age and have participated in the early intervention component of the program. Not more than 10% of the students from a secondary school can be eligible, in a process requiring application and dependent in part on class rank. These students must attend in-state higher education institutes, unless the college or university provides for portability of funding. If so, students are required to complete a prescribed set of courses and maintain satisfactory progress. The scholarships provided must be no less than 75% of the average cost of attendance for an in-state student in a four-year program at a public institution, and no less than the maximum Federal Pell Grant for that fiscal year. However, the total award to any one student cannot exceed that student's cost of attending the school. The program also allows a small percentage, only 0.75% to be used in assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of an entity's plan. When the program was passed in 1998, $200 million was appropriated for the following fiscal year, and for five years after. Since the passing of the bill, this program has been met with general approval. It was particularly successful in Connecticut. However, because each entity designs and implements unique plans, the results of the GEAR UP program have been varied.  Chicago GEAR UP Alliance  The Chicago GEAR UP Alliance has been in existence since 1999, and since then has been operating out of the Center for College Access and Success.The fiscal institution for the Chicago GEAR UP Alliance is Northeastern Illinois University, and they partner with many local higher education institutions such as Roosevelt University, DePaul University, Loyola University, Truman College, while also partnering with community based organizations such as Heartland Alliance, Youth Guidance, and New Concepts Mentor Connection. The Chicago GEAR UP Alliance works with the Chicago Public Schools to combine resources, knowledge, and experience to implement their plan within the Chicago Public School System. The last graduating class for the Chicago GEAR UP Alliance was the class of 2011, which featured 65% of students enroll in college, 95% of students complete the FAFSA, received over $30 million in scholarship awards, and out of the 24 Gates Foundation Scholarship award winners, 12 of them were GEAR UP students. The class of 2011 also saw more than 80% of the students graduate high school, and of the 65% of students who enrolled in college, 64% of those students continued their college careers beyond their first year. One of the staples of the Chicago GEAR UP Alliance is the \\"Freshman Connection\\" program. The Freshman Connection program has been directly associate with a 5.4% increase in student on-track status and a 4% increase in student passing algebra rate. When comparing non-GEAR UP students with GEAR UP students at the end of their freshman year in high school, the students who participated in Freshman Connection were 6% more likely to graduate on time, and 6% more likely to stay in college beyond their first year. On September 22, 2014, Arne Duncan, the U.S. Secretary of Education, announced that there will be $82 million given to 41 different grants across the country. Of these 41 grants, Northeastern Illinois University will receive the largest, totaling $40 million over a span of 7 years. This money will reach 14 high schools and 36 elementary and middle schools in the Chicago Public School system. Currently, the Chicago GEAR UP Alliance operates within these high schools for the classes of: 2016 and 2017: Clark, Clemente, Curie, Foreman, Harlan, Kelly, and Roosevelt High School. 2017 and 2018: Bogan, Corliss, Douglass, Dunbar, Farragut, Foreman, Hancock, Harlan, Hope, Hubbard, Hyde Park, Julian, Kelvyn Park, Little Village, Manley, Raby, Robeson, Roosevelt, Senn, Solorio, Spry Community Links, Engelwood Technical Prep Academy, Uplift, and Well Community Academy. 2020 and 2021: Bogan, Farragut, Foreman, Goode, Harlan, Hubbard, Julian, Kelly, Morgan Park, Robeson, Roosevelt, Senn, Solorio, and Engelwood Technical Prep Academy.

Name Like similar names (e.g., Jel≈°evec, Jel≈°evica, and Jel≈°je), the name Jev≈°ƒçek is derived from the common noun jel≈°a 'alder', referring to the local vegetation.  History  During the 12th Battle of the Isonzo, also known as the Battle of Caporetto, Jev≈°ƒçek was the location of the breakthrough to Mount Matajur. Mount Matajur was designated a key geographical goal of the German Alpine corps striking from Tolmin under the leadership of Hermann Freiherr von Stein. On the night of October 25, 1917, Erwin Rommel encamped at the Brgolic farm in Jev≈°ƒçek and studied his map for his advance on Mount Matajur. For his accomplishments during the battle and the conquest of Mount Matajur, Rommel later received the Prussian award Pour le M√©rite. At the invitation of the Kobarid Museum, the Italian journalist and writer Paolo Rumiz visited Jev≈°ƒçek in 2017 during the filming of his documentary La Strada di Rommel. La Strada di Rommel follows Rommel's path as described in his book Infantry Attacks. The documentary also follows Rommel to Jev≈°ƒçek and also makes a stop at the outdoor museum at the Brgoliƒç farm, where Rommel encamped and made his plans for the conquest of Mount Matajur during the battle, and at the Nje≈æna house.

The project renovated an Italian First World War trench that the Italian army had left unoccupied during the battle; this allowed Rommel to enter the village unopposed and created a hole in the Italian defense of Mount Matajur. The Kobarid museum also installed a memorial plaque at the Brgoliƒç farm, where Rommel encamped during the battle. =Livek History Trail: The Livek Story= In 2019, part of the Italian First World War defensive line above Jev≈°ƒçek underwent maintenance work that involved clearing some of the trenches in the project History Trails in the Soƒça Valley Local Activity Group Area (Tematske poti na obmoƒçju LAS Dolina Soƒçe).

Life  The son of the humanist Uberto Decembrio, Piero Candido Decembrio was born in Pavia, and named after his father's employer Peter of Candia. He was a pupil of his father's friend and teacher Manuel Chrysoloras in Florence. In 1419 he became secretary to Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan, and served in this post for nearly thirty years, continuing as secretary of the Ambrosian Republic after the Duke's death. When Francesco Sforza came to power in the city, Decembrio lost his position. He then found work in the chancery of Pope Nicholas V, but with several other humanists, he left after the accession of Pope Callixtus III and travelled instead to the Neapolitan court of Alfonso the Great of Aragon. After Alfonso's death in 1458 he returned to Rome as secretary to Pius II and then to Milan in 1460. In 1466 he was granted a pension by the Duke of Ferarra.

Formally, let a_1, \\\\ldots, a_m\\\\in {\\\\mathbb C}^d be the columns of the matrix A, which are assumed to be normalized such that a_i^H a_i = 1. The mutual coherence of A is then defined as :M = \\\\max_{1 \\\\le i e j \\\\le m} \\\\left a_i^H a_j \\\\right.

This concept was reintroduced by David Donoho and Michael Elad in the context of sparse representations. A special case of this definition for the two-ortho case appeared earlier in the paper by Donoho and Huo. The mutual coherence has since been used extensively in the field of sparse representations of signals. In particular, it is used as a measure of the ability of suboptimal algorithms such as matching pursuit and basis pursuit to correctly identify the true representation of a sparse signal.

It is one of the largest public parks in Istanbul.  History  In the Byzantine era, the entire area, where today the park stretches, was covered with cypress trees and known as \\"Kyparades\\" or \\"Cypress Forest\\". It became known as \\"Feridun Bey Park\\", when the uninhabited land was granted in the mid-16th century to Ni≈üancƒ± Feridun Bey, a Lord Chancellor in rank in the Ottoman Empire. In the 17th century, Ottoman sultan Murad IV (reigned 1623-1640) presented the estate to Emir G√ªne Han, a Safavid Persian commander, who surrendered his sieged castle without any resistance, and followed him back to Istanbul. The name \\"Feridun Bey Park\\" was changed to \\"Emirg√ªne\\", which in time became corrupted to \\"Emirgan\\". During the centuries, the estate's owner changed several times, and by the end of the 1860s, it was owned by Khedive Ismail Pasha (reigned 1863-1879), Ottoman governor of Egypt and Sudan. The area was used as the backyard of a large wooden yalƒ± that he built on the shore of the Bosphorus. Further, he built within the park area three wooden pavilions, which still exist.. The heirs of the Khedive's family sold the estate in the 1930s to Satvet L√ºtfi Tozan, a wealthy Turkish arms dealer, who granted the park grounds, the three pavilions included, later in the 1940s to the City of Istanbul during office of Governor and Mayor L√ºtfi Kƒ±rdar (1938-1949).  Present Day Emirgan Park  A pond with fountain in the Emirgan Park The park, owned and administered today by the Metropolitan Municipality of Istanbul, covers an area of on a hillside, and is enclosed by high walls. Inside the park with two decorative ponds are plants of more than 120 species. The most notable rare trees of the park's flora are: Stone Pine, Turkish pine, Aleppo Pine, Blue Pine, Eastern White Pine, Maritime Pine, Japanese Cedar, Norway Spruce, Blue Spruce, Atlas Cedar, Lebanon Cedar, Himalayan cedar, Beech, Ash tree, Sapindus, Babylon Willow, Hungarian Oak, Colorado White Fir, Maidenhair tree, California incense-cedar, Coast Redwood and Camphor tree. Many jogging tracks and picnic tables make the Emirgan Park a very popular recreation area for the local people, especially during the weekends and holidays. The three historic pavilions, called after their exterior color as the Yellow Pavilion, the Pink Pavilion and the White Pavilion were restored in time between 1979-1983 by the Touring and Automobile Club of Turkey under its CEO √áelik G√ºlersoy, and opened to the public as cafeteria and restaurant. =Tulip Festival= Tulip Festival Emirgan 2018 The Emirgan Park is closely associated with the tulip, the traditional flower, which gave its name to an era (1718-1730) of the Ottoman Empire. A special garden was established in Emirgan Park in the 1960s to revive the city's tradition of tulip cultivation. Since 2005, an annual international tulip festival is organized here every April making the park attractive and very colorful with these flowers.  Yellow Pavilion  The Yellow Pavilion () is a large wooden mansion in the form of a chalet built by Khedive Ismail Pasha between 1871-1878 as a hunting lodge and guest house. Situated in the center of the park and overlooking the Bosphorus, the two-storey mansion with one balcony, one terrace and a basement is constructed on an area of . It consists of four rooms, one hall and a kitchen in the lower floor and three rooms and one salon in the upper floor. Its layout reflects the architecture of the traditional Ottoman house with a salon encircled by many living rooms. The ornaments at the ceilings and the walls were the work of the court architect Sarkis Balyan. The ceilings are enriched with oil painted flower figures and the facades with outstanding carvings. The high doors and windows, as well as the opulent interior decorations in bright colors reflect the glory of that era. A pond is situated to the northeast, next to the mansion. Used only by the owners from the very beginning, the pavilion was restored within four months in the beginning of the 1980s with due diligence, furnished with antiques and opened to the public as a cafeteria. The Yellow Pavilion, the main base of the park, is run since 1997 by Beltur, the tourism company of the Metropolitan Municipality of Istanbul. Up to 100 guests can be served at the premise in summer and winter time.  Pink Pavilion  The Pink Pavilion (), one of the three mansions in the park built by Khedive Ismail Pasha, is a two- storey, typical Ottoman house. Named after its exterior's original color of cranesbill flower pink, the pavilion reflects the glory of its history with fine ornaments. The pavilion is used as a cafeteria on weekends. Furthermore, it is available for conventions and wedding ceremonies. In the summer months, the premise can accommodate up to 350 guests, for cocktails up to 500 people. In the winter time, groups of up to 150 guests can be served.  White Pavilion  The White Pavilion () is the third mansion within the Emirgan Park built by Khedive Ismail Pasha. It is only far from the Yellow Pavilion. The two-storey wooden building bears the architectural characteristics of the neo- classical style. The mansion is used in the daytime as a cafeteria and in the evenings as a restaurant of Turkish-Ottoman cuisine.

Sanlam is the largest insurance company in Africa.It is listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, the Namibian Stock Exchange and the A2X. Established in 1918 as a life insurance company, Sanlam Group has developed into a diversified financial services business. It's five business clusters comprise Sanlam Personal Finance, Sanlam Emerging Markets, Sanlam Investments, Sanlam Corporate and Santam. The group's areas of expertise include insurance (life and general), financial planning, retirement annuities, trusts, wills, short-term insurance, asset management, risk management and capital market activities, investment and wealth. The group operates in South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Mauritius, Malawi, Zambia, Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, Mozambique, India, Malaysia and the UK, and has business interests in the US, Australia, Burundi, Lesotho and the Philippines. It has a stake in micro-insurance specialists, UK-based Micro-Ensure Holdings Limited, which has a footprint across Africa and India servicing more than 10 million enrolled clients. It‚Äôs 2018 acquisition of SAHAM Finances has made it Africa‚Äôs biggest non-banking financial services player and has given it exposure to Morocco, Angola, Algeria, Tunisia, Niger, Mali, Senegal, Guinea, Burkina Faso, Cote D‚ÄôIvoire, Togo, Benin, Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia. History The Suid-Afrikaanse Nasionale Trust en Assuransie Maatskappij Beperk (South African National Trust and Assurance Company Limited), Santam, was registered on 28 March 1918. It was then decided to convert the life assurance department into a separate company, and the Suid- Afrikaanse Nasionale Lewens Assuransie Maatskappij Beperk (South African National Life Assurance Company Limited), Sanlam, was registered on 8 June 1918. Sanlam, the subsidiary, later became the spearhead of the operation, while Santam remained focused on short-term insurance. Sanlam showed a small profit at the end of its first year, declared a bonus, and continued to grow consistently from there. Santam remained the controlling shareholder until 1954 when Sanlam became an independent mutual life assurance company, as well as the largest single shareholder in Santam. Over the years, Sanlam's focus gradually shifted from traditional life insurance to providing a broader range of financial products and services. In 1998 Sanlam demutualised, listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) Ltd and the Namibian Stock Exchange. This changed Sanlam from a mutual entity into a public company with a share capital, namely Sanlam Life Insurance Ltd. At the same time a separate company, Sanlam Ltd, was installed as the parent company of the Sanlam group of businesses. The group was also restructured into several independent businesses within a federal business structure. Today, Sanlam is a diversified financial services provider with an extensive product offering catering for all market segments. The group has consistently grown its local as well as an international footprint ‚Äì it now has a presence in 33 African countries also India, Malaysia, the UK and Ireland, the USA, Australia and the Philippines. In 2018, Sanlam concluded its $1.1 billion acquisition of SAHAM Finances. Additionally, the group announced details of its R11 billion BEE deal, which will see it increasing its direct black shareholding to 18% and black economic ownership to 35%.  Economic empowerment  Sanlam has since 1993 contributed to broad-based black economic empowerment (B-BBEE) through the group‚Äôs partnership with Ubuntu-Botho Investments. The Ubuntu-Botho B-BBEE partnership resulted in a broad-based black empowerment consortium buying a 10% shareholding in Sanlam in what was to become one of the most far-reaching black empowerment transactions in South Africa to date. In December 2013, the initial 10-year contractual period of the transaction with Ubuntu-Botho ended, with a final total of 66.5 million deferred shares qualifying for conversion to ordinary shares. The deal created value of about R15 billion, making it arguably one of the most successful transactions of its kind in South African history. In 2014, an agreement was reached to extend the partnership with Ubuntu-Botho into the future. In 2018, Sanlam announced details of BEE transactions, which will increase its direct black shareholding to 18% and black economic ownership to 35%. The Group will sell 5% of its issued shares to new and existing B-BBEE shareholders, creating a master trust that caters to 80% of the intended beneficiaries, with Ubuntu-Botho benefitting from the other 20%.

It is a Catholic, unaided, English medium, minority school. It is an all-boys school, kindergarten through secondary, and able to be very selective in its admissions.  History  St Xavier‚Äôs School, Durgapur, was situated in several places from the first proposal for its founding in 1960 until its permanent location in 1967. It occupied premises at an ophthalmic factory of MAMC, at a primary school, at MAMC township, at ABL township, and at DSP-Hindustan Steel. The foundation stone at the present location was laid on 18 February 1966 on land permanently leased to the Calcutta Jesuits by the West Bengal government . In January 1967, St. Xavier‚Äôs School was transferred from the MAMC Primary School to its new and permanent building. Fr. A.Wautier, S.J., from Belgium was the chief architect in bringing the school to completion. In 1969, after the Sisters of Apostolic Carmel raised their school to a high school, Xavier became boy‚Äôs only. In 2001, on the expiration of a 35-year lease, the DSP authorities demanded a large sum of money for further lease, and the Jesuits decided to move out of DSP after a five years grace period. The then Headmaster tried his best to get a piece of land near the Bidhan Nagar close to the present main school for relocation of the primary wing so as to separate the secondary and eventually a 10+2 section, but this proved futile. In May 2006 the primary from Mirabai section was shifted to a new wing at the main campus. As of 2013, Xavier has classes up to std. 10. Xavier is an English Medium School affiliated to the Council for Indian Certificate of Secondary Education, New Delhi. Campus The school campus covers 40 acres, a third of it tropical trees.

Located in Seoul, Republic of Korea, it is one of the 25 government approved law schools. It has the lowest student to faculty ratio in the country. It plans to specialize in real estates law and offers scholarship to all students. 50% of the students will receive half scholarship and the other 50% of the students will get full scholarship. History Dr. You Suk Chang established the Chosun Political Science School in 1946 and later became Konkuk University in 1959. In 1954 the College of Law was established. The College graduated around 8,000 students since its founding. In 2009, the College of Law was changed to law school and no longer accepts undergraduates. =Chronology= * May 1946 -Chosun Political Science School established. * February 1959 -Law Department at the College of Politics established * January 1965 -The College of Law and Politics separated from the College of Politics. * October 1987 -The College of Law was separated from the College of Law and Politics. * March 1988 -Closure of the second campus of the College of Law * March 2003 -Undergraduate enrollment each year increased from 120 to 200. * August 2006- Completion of the Law Library and Annex * March 2009- First class for Law School Admission Admission to Konkuk Law is highly selective: For the class entering in 2009, there were approximately 304 applicants, of which 40 were admitted. 22 applicants had a perfect TOEIC score and the median composite LEET score was around 115. The applicants were varied; there were many who come from U.S. and Canadian universities as well as U.S. licensed attorneys. About 2/3 were male. The applicants were evaluated based on their undergraduate GPA, LEET (standardized law school admission exam), admissions essays and personal/case interviews. Konkuk Law also gave one and half hour written exam which tests the applicants analytical skills. Interviews were conducted by five faculty members who evaluate the applicant's personal merit and logical skills. Seoul National University produced the largest number of acceptance- twelve, followed by Yonsei University, eleven and Korea University and Ewha Womans University each producing two. Sogang University, Hongik University, Chung-Ang University, Sookmyung Women's University, Pusan National University, George Washington University, University of California, Berkeley each had one acceptance.Í±¥Íµ≠ÎåÄ Î°úÏä§Ïø® Ìï©Í≤©Ïûê Î∞úÌëú‚Ä¶ÎπÑÎ≤ïÌïô Ï†ÑÍ≥µ 85%, Konkuk Today, December 11, 2008 Only 15% of them majored in law as undergraduate ‚Äì the percentage of L.L.B (bachelor of law), those who studied law in college is much higher in other schools, such as Korea University where the ratio was 59%.

A large French army under the command of the Duke of Berwick besieged and captured the fortress, which was lightly garrisoned and in poor condition. Context On the death of Augustus II on 1 February 1733, the Polish throne was claimed by both his son, Augustus III, and by Stanislas I, father in law of Louis XV. Whilst a body double ostensibly left Brest by sea, Stanilas crossed Germany incognito and arrived at Warsaw on 8 September. On 12 September Stanislas was elected king of Poland by the diet. On his election Russia and Austria (backing Augustus III) invaded Poland. By 22 September Stanislas, who did not have a proper army, had to take refuge in Danzig (now known as Gda≈Ñsk), there to await the French help he had been promised. On 5 October, Augustus III was proclaimed king under protection from Russian forces at Warsaw. Great Britain, the Dutch Republic, Sweden, Denmark and the Republic of Venice recognised that Austro-Russian aggression against Poland was the casus belli and pledged to remain neutral. Spain, coveting the Kingdom of Naples and Sardinia, which coveted the Duchy of Milan, sided with France. Louis XV's courtiers (including the princes of Conti and Eu, the counts of Clermont, Charolais and Belle-Isle, the duc de Richelieu, but also Maurice de Saxe, Augustus III's half-brother and the former lover of Anna Ivanovna, now the tsarina of Russia) joined up under marshal James FitzJames to form an army for invading the Rhineland with the objective of distracting Austria from events in Poland and gaining the Duchy of Lorraine. Prelude The village and fortress of Kehl was located near the Margraviate of Baden (now part of the German state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, but then part of the Holy Roman Empire), just across the Rhine River from the French city of Strasbourg. The fortress at Kehl, and that at Philippsburg to the north, provided strategic military control over major crossings of the upper Rhine, which formed the boundary between French-controlled Alsace and the various principalities of the empire. Nominally the responsibility of the emperor, maintenance and defense of the fortress belonged to the Swabian Circle, which was largely dominated by the Duchy of W√ºrttemberg. Although some imperial troops were stationed there in January 1733, the commander of the fortress was the W√ºrttembergian lieutenant general Baron Johann August von Phull, and most of its garrison consisted of Swabian troops. When the war broke out, numerous works to repair and expand the fortress were underway, but key defenses near the Rhine were incomplete. On 12 October, French troops under Belle-Isle and Silly marched into the Duchy of Lorraine and seized its capital, Nancy. Control over the remainder of Lorraine was rapidly established, and the two commanders left garrisons throughout the duchy before sending the bulk of their forces into Alsace to focus on the campaign on the Rhine. Also on 12 October, Berwick ordered troops from the Strasbourg encampment to cross the Rhine. At a point near Auenheim, about below Kehl, they constructed a ship bridge and crossed 4,000 men to the east bank. Near Goldscheuer, above the fortress, they began constructing another bridge. Two days later, the bulk of the Berwick's army had crossed the Rhine. General Phull, when the French began their movements, destroyed the bridge between Kehl and Strasbourg, and also destroyed those houses and other buildings outside the fortress that might provide the attacking French any sort of shelter. Siege Berwick first ordered the construction of a line of circumvallation. Local villagers were among those pressed into service for its construction, which was anchored at both ends by the Rhine, above and below the fortress. Berwick's quartermasters also made demands to the surrounding villages for the delivery of provisions to the besiegers. The Duke of W√ºrttemberg signed a supply agreement that he characterized in reports to the emperor as being concluded under the greatest duress. By 17 October Berwick was ready to begin digging siege lines, and it became apparent to Phull that the fortress' river-facing hornwork was Berwick's target when the latter began construction of batteries on the island between Kehl and Strasbourg. On 18 October Phull issued detailed instructions to his commanders concerning the tactics of defense and retreat. The hornwork was to be held until it was either breached or its artillery rendered useless, at which point the defenders were to fall back first to the covered way between the hornwork and the main fortress, and then to the fortress proper. The French began digging siege trenches on the night of 19 October. By 21 October the siege lines reached an unfinished lunette on the Rhine-facing side of the fortress, and the French began setting up a battery there on 23 October. The defenders were by this time reduced to musket fire and grenades, as most of their artillery had been dismounted or destroyed by enemy fire. On 23 October the French opened fire not only on the hornwork, but also began battering the walls of the main fortress with cannon fire. After two failed assaults by Berwick's grenadiers, they succeeded in briefly occupying the hornwork; it was reoccupied by the Germans the next day. The defenders attempted a sortie against the French positions near the hornwork, but it was repulsed. By 27 October, the French had established numerous batteries and were mercilessly battering the main fortification. About 4 pm on 28 October, the French barrage started a fire on the hornwork that was severe enough that its commander requested permission from Phull to withdraw; this permission was granted. Phull then held a council, in which it was determined that only 500 men were combat-ready, and that the fortress might hold out at most three more days. Consequently, Phull raised the white flag around 8 pm on 28 October. The garrison marched out of the fortress on 31 October with the full honors of war, and was escorted to the imperial defense line at Ettlingen. Aftermath The onset of bad weather ended the French campaign for the year, and Berwick, after consolidating his control over the area, quartered his troops for the winter on the French side of the Rhine. In 1734 Berwick continued the campaign down the Rhine, successfully flanking the Austrian defense line at Ettlingen, and continuing with the siege of Philippsburg, during which he was killed by a shell. That siege was successfully concluded by his second in command, the marquis d'Asfeld, and marked the end of significant military operations in the Rhine valley for the war. Pursuant to the 1738 Treaty of Vienna that ended the war, France eventually withdrew from Kehl and Philippsburg, but eventually annexed Lorraine.

Developed from discussions related to the armistice, the declaration outlined the parties' commitment to peace and stability in the Middle East and their opposition to the use or the threat of force. They pledged to take action within and outside the United Nations to prevent violations of the frontiers or armistice lines. Further, they reiterated their opposition to the development of an arms race.A Concise History of the Arab-Israeli Conflict, Background to the 1956 War, p. 123 The declaration also stipulated close consultation among the three powers, with a view to limiting the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli arms race; it was issued on 25 May 1950.Gale Encyclopedia of the Mideast & N. Africa, Tripartite Declaration (1950), 2004 Motivations The Western powers aimed to maintain stability and the free flow of oil, to neutralize the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict, and, if possible, to convince Arabs and Israelis to make common cause with the West against the threat of Soviet encroachment. The United States was the central force behind the agreement: President Dwight Eisenhower viewed it as a proper instrument to ensure neutrality of the West, particularly the United States in the Arab- Israeli conflict. The ultimate purpose was to prevent any seizure in the Middle East by force. Impact According to Gerald M. Steinberg, the \\"agreement did not prevent the Arab states from obtaining weapons through their alliance relationships with suppliers, but Israel was excluded.... Little foreign aid was provided by the United States, and Israeli military officials who sought to purchase weapons and ammunition in the United States were rebuffed.\\" =NEACC= In June 1952, the parties set up the Near East Arms Coordinating Committee (NEACC) through which they co-ordinated their arms sales to all parties in the conflict. The United States sold virtually no arms in the Middle East, leaving those markets to Britain and France, with considerable competition between the two. The NEACC functioned reasonably well for more than three years. Both Britain and France periodically withheld arms from the rivals in the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli dispute, primarily when states took action that threatened either British or French regional interests. The three powers recognized, however, that the Arab states and Israel needed to maintain a certain level of armed force for purposes of internal security and legitimate self-defense. They declared that they would consider arms requests in light of those principles, including requests that would permit the countries to \\"play their part in the defense of the area as a whole.\\" An important but somewhat- unenforceable clause of the Tripartite Agreement also stressed that the three powers would sell arms only with an assurance that the purchasing nations would not use them for acts of aggression against other nations. =Czech arms deal affects declaration= The Czech arms deal of September 1955 in which the Soviet Union agreed to sell Egypt $250 million worth of modern weaponry, made irrelevant Western efforts to limit the flow of arms. In April 1956, France began to transfer large quantities of modern arms to Israel. ‚ÄúFrance had been supplying Israel with arms since the early 1950s under the terms of a secret Franco-Israeli arms arrangement (in violation of the Tripartite Agreement, but with American support and encouragement).\\" References Sources Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict 1950 documents ","title":"Tripartite Declaration of 1950"},{"id":"20641897","text":"Richard Hol - portrait by J.J.

His conservative music showed the influence of Ludwig van Beethoven, Felix Mendelssohn, and Robert Schumann and the Leipzig school, though as a conductor he offered Dutch audiences the more revolutionary music of Hector Berlioz and Richard Wagner.  Life  Richard Hol followed a course in piano under Jan George Bertelman at the royal conservatory of Amsterdam; after his graduation in 1844 he made a living as piano accompanist. In part on the basis of his choral compositions he was appointed director of the Amsterdamse Toonkunstkoor in 1857. In 1862, when Johannes Verhulst was appointed to the position, Hol removed to Utrecht, where he came to occupy the center of musical life, taking up the post of Ferdinand Kufferath in directing the city concerts (stadsconcerten) and the Utrecht Toonkunstkoor for the remainder of his life. In addition he was organist at the cathedral, 1869‚Äì1888. From 1875 he served as director of the Stedelijke Muziekschool at Utrecht, teaching music theory and history himself. Among his prominent pupils were Johan Wagenaar, who succeeded him as teacher and cathedral organist, and Catharina van Rennes. In his last years Hol published pieces in numerous journals and served from 1894 until his death as editor of the organ journal Het Orgel. When the Nederlandsche Toonkunstenaars-Vereeniging was founded in 1875, he served as its first director. Among the many decorations he received was his appointment in 1875 as a corresponding member of the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise. He composed an anthem for Transvaal, in use until the British occupied it in 1887. His posthumous reputation remained largely confined to Dutch audiences and choral singing groups, until his four symphonies began to be recorded at the close of the 20th century. His vaderlandische legende (\\"patriotic legend\\") for chorus, orchestra and organ, De Vliegende Hollander (\\"The Flying Dutchman\\"), Op. 70 (1874) was described in 1904 as frequently performed, in Le guide musical, reviewing a concert with a performance of the ballad, in The Hague..

As a member of the reigning House of Bourbon, he was a Prince of the Blood. Biography The second son of Louis III, Prince of Cond√©, and Louise-Fran√ßoise de Bourbon, Charles de Bourbon-Cond√© was made governor of Touraine in 1720. He fought in Hungary in the war against the Ottoman Turks and won distinction at the battle of Belgrade. In 1728 he became one of the candidates for the hand of the wealthy heiress Maria Zofia Sieniawska, supported by Louis XV in an attempt to gain a strong position in Poland before the royal election. He was gouverneur of his nephew Louis Joseph, Prince of Cond√©. Debauched, violent, wrathful, sadistic, bloodthirsty and occasionally murderous, barely within the bounds of sanity, and incredibly arrogant, not least on account of his rank, which gave him gross impunity as a royal prince, Charles, Count of Charolais, never ceased to appear in the news of his time. Heredity may have played a part, as his father Louis was popularly known as le Singe Vert, or the Green Monkey, to his contemporaries because of his ugliness and depravities. Perhaps unsurprisingly given his rank, overwhelming police reports about Charles de Bourbon were long kept secret. These relate, among other appalling depravities, Charles's kidnap and detainment of women and girls for use in sadistic orgies he arranged with other debauchees. Some historians have seen in him an inspiration for certain characters in the novels of the Marquis de Sade. In one particular instance, in the street and in front of witnesses, this nobleman, a relative of the king, fired his pistol and killed, coldly and without reason other than his own pleasure, a man who had the misfortune of being within reach of his weapon. The regent Philippe d'Orl√©ans was truly shocked by this heinous crime, and summoned the count to say that, while he could not punish him on account of his rank, he would willingly forgive anyone who took reciprocal action. Another story tells of how in a drunken rage, he assaulted and badly injured the unfortunate driver of the Spanish ambassador who had parked his carriage in an alley beside the Louvre usually reserved for cars of the princes of the blood. He allegedly secretly married a certain Jeanne de Valois-Saint-R√©my, a descendant of Henri II via an illegitimate branch; their supposed son, Louis Thomas Charles (1718‚Äì1799), was declared illegitimate by the king and was later exiled to England. He had two illegitimate children with Marguerite Caron de Rancurel: #Marie Marguerite de Bourbon (1752‚Äì1830), who married Denis Nicolas, comte de Puget; #Charlotte Marguerite √âlisabeth de Bourbon (1754‚Äì1839), who married (son of Marshal de Lowendal). On his death the county of Charolais reverted to the king. Some years later it was granted to a brother of the future Louis Philippe I. He was buried at the √âglise Coll√©giale Saint-Martin, Montmorency.

He last played for Redbridge and has represented England's Learning Disability team. Chandler began his career as a trainee with Charlton Athletic, turning professional in April 1994 and making his league debut the following season. In 1994, Chandler along with teammate Lee Bowyer was found to have tested positive for cannabis after a training ground check. Both received bans of several months. On his return, Chandler found it difficult to break into the Charlton first team and in March 1997 was loaned to Torquay United. He made his Torquay debut against Lincoln City at Sincil Bank, but lasted only 20 minutes before going off with an ankle injury. He returned a fortnight later and played a further three league games for the Gulls. Chandler was released by Charlton at the end of the 1996‚Äì97 season, having played just two league games, scoring once. In August 1997 he signed for Lincoln City, and played in the defeat away to Burnley in the League Cup on 26 August. Struggling to break into the first team, he was loaned to Yeovil Town on 28 November 1997. He scored on his Conference debut the following day against Cheltenham Town at the Huish. He remained at Yeovil until the end of January 1998, but returned to Lincoln at the end of the loan period. He subsequently joined Chesham United, before signing for Slough Town on 26 November 1998. However, he could not agree terms with Slough and a day later was sold to Yeovil Town for ¬£3,500. He was released by Yeovil manager David Webb on 4 May 2000, but returned on 3 July on a three-month trial, Webb apparently having a change of heart.

He was sacked by Purfleet in April 2003 for a 'breach of club discipline'. He subsequently joined Thurrock, moving to Ford United in August 2003. He captained Ford to the First Round proper of the FA Cup, but scored an extra-time own goal as Ford lost at home to Port Vale. Ford changed their name to Redbridge the following year and Chandler was surprisingly released from the renamed club, joining East Thurrock United in June 2004. In July 2004, Chandler made his debut for the England Learning Disability team, playing in a 16‚Äì0 win against hosts Sweden in the Global Games. He was sent off in the following match, against Brazil, for violent conduct as England progressed to the semi-finals with a 4‚Äì3 victory. He left East Thurrock in November 2005, joining Leyton, but in April 2006 moved on to Heybridge Swifts. He subsequently rejoined East Thurrock United and returned to Redbridge in December 2007.

It is native to the Americas, including most of South and Central America, Mexico, and the southernmost continental United States from California to Florida. This is a perennial bunchgrass growing in upright clumps 60 to 120 centimeters tall. The straw-colored stems have nodes at intervals which are fringed with fluffy hairs. The leaves are 20 to 30 centimeters long and blue-green when new, drying to a reddish yellow. The inflorescence is a feathery array of spikelet units. Each unit is composed of one hairy, tan, fertile spikelet with a twisted awn up to 3.5 centimeters long twinned with a stalked, sterile spikelet which is much smaller and lacks an awn. The long-haired spikelets are wind-dispersed. In its native range, this grass is useful as a forage for grazing animals and a groundcover for revegetating cleared land.Forest Service Fire Ecology It is very drought resistant. It is considered an indicator of rangeland damage, as it is often one of the first native species to be eliminated when an area is overgrazed. It is known elsewhere as an introduced species and sometimes a weed, such as in Hawaii. It is grown as an ornamental plant for its showy inflorescences.

History Its genesis is well documented in letters from which we know that Liszt was Richard Wagner's guest in the Palazzo Vendramin on the Grand Canal in Venice in late 1882. Liszt may have had a premonition there of Wagner's death which inspired the first version of the work: a piano piece in , written in December 1882 (which remained unpublished until the Rugginenti edition of 2002). This piece was recomposed the next month, in January 1883, and very shortly thereafter arranged for violin or cello and piano. The piano version was published in 1885, with minor changes (this version is today usually called La lugubre gondola II). This was the only version of this piece published in Liszt's lifetime. Wagner died in Venice on February 13, 1883, and the long funeral procession to Bayreuth began with the funeral gondola to Venice's Santa Lucia railway station. Liszt was by now almost certainly considering the piece to be a Wagner memorial, and in 1885 he returned to the string version and replaced the last three bars with a twenty-bar coda. This was probably done before the publication of the solo version, because the new extended string version does not contain the minor alterations in the published solo version. According to Liszt's correspondence with Lina Ramann, La Lugubre Gondola was originally to have been entitled Troisi√®me √©l√©gie and was to have been dedicated to her. There is an undated manuscript, clearly from the end of Liszt's life, of a starker version of the piece in for piano solo - virtually a new composition. It remained unpublished until 1927, when it was published alongside the other version of the piece, but with the same title. So since 1927, the piece has been known as La lugubre gondola II, and the hitherto unpublished piece is usually called La lugubre gondola I. It is unfortunate that the numbering which attached itself to these two works puts them out of chronology. The opening single melodic line of La Lugubre Gondola No. 2 can be seen to be inspired by Wagner‚Äôs unending melodies, and the unresolved diminished sevenths and unfinished phrases are reminiscent of the Prelude to Wagner's Tristan und Isolde. Liszt then develops this into a more lyrical, romantic line.

Gameplay The gameplay of the game is comparable to Evochron Renegades, in which the player takes the role of a mercenary pilot in the fictional Evochron sector of space. The gameplay is a freeform sandbox approach, and allows the player to seamlessly switch from any of the available roles without menu-interfaces. Traditional roles include, among others, mining, trading, pirating, exploring, bounty hunting, and military flight. Similarly to earlier Evochron titles, the gameplay is considered to be \\"seamless\\". Like in Evochron Renegades, all environments are interactive. All nebulae can be flown through, with some of the clouds actively disabling or hindering player and AI ship systems. Planets can be descended upon in real-time and used to trade upon, a feature often praised in the now classic Frontier: Elite II. Atmospheric flight differs significantly from space flight, although the controls remain identical. Asteroid fields allow the player to mine and use them as temporary cover, in combat, from missile and gunfire. Larger asteroids sometimes include tunnel systems that can be explored and used for combat advantages. Objects like planets, stars, and black holes all exert a gravitational pull on the ship. Flight in Evochron Legends is a hybrid between heavy- and low-inertia flight. By using a ship- system called the inertial dampening system (IDS) the player can choose to let the ship automatically adapt the course to the cockpit orientation or to let the ship keep its current heading and speed to turn the ship freely during flight due to the lack of friction in space. The graphics of Evochron Legends New features and improvements New features include military combat ships ranging from light scouts to heavy interceptors that can be purchased and flown by players, and new capital ships such as Cruisers, Battleships, Command Ships, and Destroyers that can engage in war zone battles. In addition, the game makes a huge jump forward in graphical aspects \\\\- where Evochron Renegades' graphics were considered 'functional' rather than 'flashy', Evochron Legends has more highly detailed textures and new effects such as stellar accretion discs and more planetary ring types. New roles have been added, including passenger transport, energy transport, crafting, and capital ship escorting. ;War Zones Currently, three systems feature war zones, in which the player engages the Vonari along with the military. Through dockable carriers available in the war zones, players can buy themselves military crafts if wished for. By engaging in military missions, the player gains a military rank that allows buying more powerful military crafts. ;Crafting A new feature is called crafting, in which players use raw commodities to create second-level commodities or usable items. This is done at special constructor stations, which allows the player to create items and more valuable commodities. An amount of platinum can be converted into a long-range probe, and amounts of metal can be crafted into armor plating. Some items can only be crafted by combining multiple commodities together. ;Commodities New commodities include oxygen, water, gold, and silver. Some of these (oxygen, water) can be gathered from planetary atmospheres and surface. Gold and silver are rare commodities that are both valuable and crucial to create some of the crafted items. ;Environments While most of the environments from Evochron Renegades return, including planets, cities, stars, stations, nebulae, asteroid fields, and caves, the nebula class that disturbed weaponry has been replaced by a high-energy nebula that jams the jump-drive of the player. For the multiplayer mode, it is being presented as a good place for a hard and honest fight between clans. Also, dockable carriers and constructor stations are new environments. ;Difficulty The difficulty of the game has been tweaked, giving the game a slightly more balanced learning curve. The learning curve is still considered steep, especially during the first combat situations. The training mode has received a full makeover, allowing the player to choose for either a full training or only focussing on certain aspects. Story quest The story revolves around one person chasing the Phantom class battle carrier from Arvoch Conflict and Evochron Renegades. The story seems to be as optional as possible, although completing the quest will yield beneficial advantages. The story quest will let the player go on a hunt after beacons that are scattered throughout the universe. Unlike earlier games, the player will need to fulfill certain requirements for the beacon to activate, making the story more 'red line'--like for players new to the series. Although the story builds further on the earlier Starwraith 3D Games lore, it is self-explanatory and does not require earlier knowledge of the story. Multiplayer Multiplayer in the Evochron series has offered the seamless profile system since its very beginning. In this system, a pilot profile made will always be available on any game server that is not purely set to multiplayer profiles. In this way, players are free to work on their spacecraft in single player. Capture the flag-like objects have been added, allowing players and clans to set up a CTF match seamlessly. Notable locations for such a match include within a high- energy nebula and the interior of a large asteroid. Any person can host a (dedicated) game server for a predetermined number of players. Other players are required to use a compatible version of the client to connect to the server, and to have identical universe files. The host of the game sets any rules, although rules are only controlled through players and not enforced by the game itself. In this way, the freeform spirit of the game is retained.

He made numerous portraits for nobility and government officials. Josef Kriehuber left more than 3000 lithographs, with portraits of many people. AEIOU Encyclopedia: \\"Kriehuber, Josef\\", 2008, (see webpage URL in References below). Schubert and His World: A Biographical Dictionary H.P. Clive, 1997, p.104, Google Books link: Books-Google-104. Self-portrait of Josef Kriehuber, Lithography, 1860 Robert Schumann, Lithograph by Josef Kriehuber, in 1839 Monument at the Wiener Zentralfriedhof cemetery.  Life  Josef Kriehuber was born in Vienna, Austria on 14 December 1800. He was first trained by his brother Johann Kriehuber, then studied at the Vienna Academy under Hubert Maurer, then moved to Galicia, where he devoted himself to horse painting. He worked as a lithographer for several Viennese publishing houses. With nearly 3,000 works, Josef Kriehuber was the most important portrait lithographer of the Viennese Biedermeier period. Kriehuber is also noted for his studies of the Prater park. He taught at the Vienna Theresianum academy. Kriehuber was only 13 years old when he went to the art-class in the Imperial Academy in Vienna. In 1818, he accompanied the prince Sanguszko as a drawing- master to Poland. In 1821 he returned to Vienna. To earn himself money for the course at the academy, and for the cost of living, he became one of the most industrious lithographic employees of the publishing company Trentsensky. In 1826, his first portraits using the new printing technique of lithography appear. In the next few decades, Kriehuber becomes the most sought-after and best-paid portraitist of Biedermeier Vienna. His success probably stems from the fact that he is a master of portraying men as more distinguished, and women as prettier, than they are in reality. His works, an image of the Viennese society of this epoch, include nearly 3000 portrait-lithographs, along with a few hundred water-colours. There are but few well-known persons of that time who did not have their portrait made by Kriehuber. Names include: Francis I of Austria, F√ºrst von Metternich, Josef Radetzky, Franz Grillparzer, Johann Nestroy, Archduke Johann, Friedrich Halm, Friedrich Hebbel, Hammer- Purgstall, Franz Schubert, Anton Diabelli, Robert Schumann, Giacomo Meyerbeer, Carl Czerny, Franz Liszt, Sigismond Thalberg, Ole Bull, Niccol√≤ Paganini, Elias Parish Alvars, Fritz Reuter, Therese Krones, Fanny El√üler, Archduke Karl Ludwig, Sophie of Austria, Marie-Louise of Austria, Johann Kaspar von Seiller, Hector Berlioz, Stephan Endlicher, Ignaz von Seyfried, Moritz Gottlieb Saphir, Carl von Ghega, Wilhelm von Tegetthoff, Ferdinand Maximilian von Austria. In 1860 he was hailed as first artist awarded the Franz Joseph Order in Austria. With the advances of photography, however, commissions fell off; Kriehuber's last years were overshadowed by poverty. He died on 30 May 1876, in his native city of Vienna. His final resting place, now an honorary grave, is in Vienna's \\"Zentralfriedhof\\" (central cemetery). Significant collections of his works are in the Albertina (Vienna), and in the portrait collection of the Austrian National Library in Vienna. Since 1889 a street in Vienna-Margareten (Vienna's 5th district), has been named after Kriehuber.

He is the younger son of King Duncan and brother to Malcolm, the heir to the throne. Donalbain flees to Ireland after the murder of his father for refuge. He is based upon a personage in an account of King Duncan in Holinshed's Chronicles, a history of Britain familiar to Shakespeare.Bevington, David. Four Tragedies. Bantam, 1988. He is ultimately based on the historical King Donald III of Scotland. In the original text of the First Folio his name is spelled Donalbaine, and is sometimes also spelled Donaldbain. Origin Shakespeare's Donalbain is based upon 'Donald Bane' in the account of King Duncan from Holinshed's Chronicles (1587). There, he makes his only appearance in the narrative after King Duncan is murdered. He then decides to seek refuge in Ireland where, the reader is informed, he was \\"cherished by the king of that land\\". After his departure, Macbeth uses \\"great liberality\\" toward the Scottish nobles in order to gain their favour, and rules capably for seventeen years before being defeated by Malcolm and his English forces. Holinshed's historical personage is Donald III of Scotland. Historically, Donalbain (Donald Ban/Donald the Fair) seized the Scottish throne after the death of Malcolm and reigned off and on for a few years but was ultimately succeeded by Malcolm's son Edgar. Role in the play Donalbain appears in a few early scenes in the play as a silent member of his father's entourage. He speaks only in 2.3 when, after his father's murder, he decides to flee to Ireland. His brother decides to seek refuge in England. Donalbain tells Malcolm that their \\"separated fortune / Shall keep us both the safer\\". With his father and brother, Donalbain represents moral order in the play, and contributes to the father/son motif of the play. Although it is easy to argue that Donalbain does not contribute to the play, granted his lack of appearance, he plays his role by supporting Malcolm as his son and Duncan as his father. He is also a boost to the King's character, as neither of his sons is involved in foul play in the play. The ending of Roman Polanski's film of Macbeth, in which Donalbain, returning to Scotland after the death of Macbeth, hears the witches murmuring in the heather and gets off his horse to investigate, alludes to the historical fact that Donald III seized the throne after the death of Malcolm.

It remains the most successful team in the history of the Italian Serie A, with 19 championships. History HC Bolzano was founded in 1933 and in the first twenty years of its existence, home games were played in an outdoor rink until 1953, when the club moved into the Bolzano Exhibition Hall, which was the first artificial ice was available. Eleven of the nineteen Italian league titles were won there before the team moved in 1994, to the newly built Palaonda/Eiswelle. At the same time, the team also participated in the Alps League in part, an international ice hockey competition, attended by teams from Slovenia and Austria were involved. In addition to a master and three runner-up titles in this competition, the team also won another seven Italian titles, the last of which in 2012 was given the three-time winning the Coppa Italia, the Italian League Cup competition. Other achievements include three gains of the Supercoppa Italiana and the Six Nations tournament, also called Caucasian Ligacup, in 1994. In 2013, the HC Bolzano applied again for inclusion in the Erste Bank Eishockey Liga (EBEL), after earlier applications failed each time due to the resistance of the Italian Ice Hockey Federation. However, the chaotic conditions in the Serie A paved the way to acceptance, since a large part of the club that was from the second division had been released. The move was also largely motivated by the need of a new major sponsor to help clear their financial situation. Known as the HCB S√ºdtirol in the EBEL (the main sponsor is the tourism promotion agency of the Alto Adige ‚Äì S√ºdtirol region), Bolzano had surprisingly successful inaugural season in 2013‚Äì14. On the back of a heavy recruitment scheme which centred in signing Canadian players of Italian heritage, Bolzano finished in fourth place by the end of the Regulation season. In the EBEL finals, they went on to win the championship by defeating the EC Red Bull Salzburg in the finals, and in doing so becoming to first non-Austrian based club to win the Austrian Championship. With the victory of the EBEL championship, Bolzano ensured qualification to the first edition of the Champions Hockey League, a prestigious tournament for European clubs. Despite their status of EBEL defending Champions, Bolzano due to numerous financial difficulties that risked compromising the entry of the team in these competitions, were late in confirming their status for a second EBEL season. In May 2016 it was announced that the South Tyrol energy producer Alperia would become the main sponsor of the team. In 2018 the HC Bozen Alperia defeat the EC Red Bull Salzburg in game-7 of the final to win the EBEL championship for a second time. After the successful final, historic captain Alexander Egger announced his retirement from professional ice hockey.

Situated amidst backwaters, around 12 km (7.5 mi) from the city center, Kumbalangi is a major tourist attraction and is famous for its Chinese fishing nets. Location and geography Kumbalangi island is 16 km2 in area. It is situated around 15 km from the Ernakulam Junction Railway Station and around 40 km from the Cochin International Airport. Population and economy Nearly 1,00,000 people live in the village. The main occupation in Kumbalangy is fishing, and there are over 100 Chinese nets in the backwaters that face the village. Groves of mangroves separate the land from the water, providing a breeding ground for prawns, crabs, oysters and small fishes. It is home to fishermen, farmers, labourers, toddy tappers and coir spinners. An occupation which has seen quite a revival is that of boatmen. The village is well connected by road to the mainland, and the local community did not patronize them very much. However, tourists are keen on cruises. Fisher folk and boatmen also demonstrate various fishing techniques for the tourists. Model tourism village In 2003 the Kerala government selected several villages as model villages. The Kumbalangy Integrated Tourism Village project is meant to transform the tiny island into a model fishing village and tourism spot. The panchayat (village council), with financial assistance from the state government, is implementing the project. \\"The Kumbalangy project was set in motion in 2003 to help the local people, the economy and the locality through tourism,\\" says M C Sivadathan, President of the Kumbalangy panchayat. \\"And in order to achieve this, we have done away with many concepts typical of tourism elsewhere. Our idea is to create job opportunities for the villagers, while also ensuring that tourists have a good time seeing and experiencing real village life,\\" he explains. Currently, ten houses offer rooms to visitors. This facility is generally within a residence, where two or more rooms with attached baths are set aside for guests. The tourists sit with the host family and eat the same food. They can walk through the village, watch fishermen at work, fish themselves, go canoeing and visit the farms. Tourists also find that there is no huge communication gap, because at least one member in a family, if not all, can converse in English. =Artists' village= Under the Kumbalangy project, Kalagraamam, an artists' village, is also being set up. The initial plans were to erect a cottage in the middle of the backwaters. Later, the panchayat members, tourism secretary and the tourism minister all agreed that this would disturb the backwaters ecology. Kalagraamam, therefore, will now stand on four acres of land inside Kumbalangy. It will showcase the traditional fishing equipment and handicrafts of the region. =Infrastructure= The Kumbalangy panchayat is aware that being a tourist destination also brings with it greater responsibilities. \\"Tourists will not come unless there are proper roads and lights. So, the roads and canals have been strengthened, CFC lamps have been installed, and 600 biogas plants have been set up for waste management. Kumbalangy is also the first panchayat in the state to set up such a waste management system. A park has also been constructed for visitors to relax in. The most remarkable thing about this project is that what we do for the tourists also directly benefits the local population,\\" Sivadathan says. =Popular culture= The 2019 Malayalam- language movie Kumbalangi Nights is set here.

Puthencruz plays a pivotal role in connecting different smaller villages and other surrounding towns to Ernakulam as it lies in the outer ring of Ernakulam City. Puthencruz is rapidly developing into a city and will be at the pivot of expansion of the Ernakulam municipal area.

Kolenchery Church was built in the 7th century, and has many subsidiary ones like Kurinji and Poothrikka. When the new cross was established as a belief by the locals to get rid of an infectious disease called \\"Masoori\\", the procession of the main festival from the mother church of Kolenchery extended up to Pannikuzhy kara, the people started to tell that \\"the procession shall extend to the Puthen Kurisu\\". The name of the place in time changed to Puthankurisu, and was Portuguesised to Puthencruz. Earlier names of this place was also termed as 'Puttumanoor' and 'Puliyirangum Kara' in many records.

As of 2019, it is undergoing a ‚Ç¨150 million reconstruction to become Bolands Quay, a development of new residences and commercial, retail, and civic spaces. The mill site includes a number of buildings. There are two six-storey stone warehouse buildings dating from the 1830s, and others on Barrow Street dating from the 1870s. The majority of the complex consisted of concrete silos built between the 1940s and 1960s. The mill stopped production in 2001 and the site had been derelict since then. Within the complex of buildings, the older 19th century stone block buildings facing onto Ringsend Road and onto Grand Canal Dock together with two terraced houses on Barrow street are listed as protected buildings by Dublin City Council. The taller concrete silos on the site were not protected structures, and were demolished during the construction in 2017-2018. The site is in an area dubbed \\"Silicon Docks\\"Google (a reference to Silicon Valley) as it has become location for high-tech multinationals such as Google and Facebook.

On 2 December 2014 a site notice was posted which indicated plans for the site. This notice included details of: # Building A - a two-storey building on the corner of Barrow Street and Ringsend Road, \\"to be retained and restored for retail/restaurant/cafe use\\", with new windows and an entrance on Ringsend Road # Buildings B1-B5 - ranging from five to eight storeys, to \\"be retained and restored for office use, and retail/restaurant/cafe use at ground level\\" # Building C - six storeys on Ringsend Road, and fronting the dock # Building D - two storeys plus basement, currently 33 and 34 Barrow Street, retained and restored for retail/restaurant/cafe use. # Factory building - two storey brick gables, to be partially demolished, with refurbishment to match that of building C, and planned for cultural/exhibition use. # New Office Building 1 - five storeys increasing to 14 storeys (max. building height ), fronting Barrow Street and accommodating office use # New Office Building 2 - five storeys increasing to 13 storeys (max. building height ), fronting Barrow Street and accommodating office use # New Residential Building 3 - fifteen storeys (max. building height ), with 30 two-bedroom units and 2 three-bedroom units, with a reception at ground floor and gym at first floor # Three new pedestrian routes from Barrow Street, new civic waterfront square adjacent to the dock, a bridge link along the dock connecting the square to McMahon Bridge (Ringsend Road), with a second open space to the south of the factory building. # Three levels of underground parking under buildings 1, 2, and 3, and a new vehicular ramp to replace existing ramp alongside the Mason Hayes & Curran building. The National Asset Management Agency took control of the site in late 2012. On 19 May 2014, it was reported that Google was considering the derelict site for further development of the company in the area. In May 2018, it was announced that Google had bought the site from the National Asset Management Agency for ‚Ç¨300 million. =Previous plans= The Boland's Mill site initially had planning permission for an office, residential and retail/hotel redevelopment granted by the Dublin Docklands Development Authority (under Section 25 of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Act, 1997).

It is one of the panchayaths in Peerumedu taluk. The area is marked by a cool climate as the region is situated at an elevation of more than above the sea level. Elappara is famous for its vast tea plantations.  History  The history of present Elappara begins in 1836 with the clearing of the Vembanadu region by Henry Baker, a C.M.S. missionary. The first estate to start the tea industry in high-range was the Tyford estate and the first plantation Penshwarast - both of which are situated in Elappara panchayath. During the Kollam era, the regions including Elappara were a part of the Thekkumkur kingdom and were later acquired by Manavikrama Kulasekara Perumal, the founder of the Poonjar dynasty. History says that Manavikrama was on his journey to Poonjar and took rest at 'Thangalpara,' near Kolahalamedu. Even today we can see the remnants of Minakshi idols in the rocks, indicating its history. In the 1870s, various plantations had emerged in this region. The tea cultivated here was known by the name Peerumedu hybrid tea, a type native to China. By 1896, the area was fully utilized for tea cultivation. Later, in the 1900s, the people that worked in these plantations permanently settled there.  Administration  Elappara panchayath was formed in 1953, including 17 wards, and it belongs to the Azhutha block of Peerumedu taluk.

The village of Kannan Devan Hills in Devikulam Taluk, was given on lease on 11 July 1877 by the Poonjar Thampuran to John Daniel Munroe, of London and Peermedu, for tea plantation. The lands and plantations were later resumed by the Government of Kerala by the Kannan Devan Hills (Resumption Of Lands) Act, 1971. Kannan Devan Hills (Resumption of Lands) Act, 1971 History The tradition that Col Arthur Wellesley, later to be the Duke of Wellington, leading a British detachment from Vandiperiyar to Bodinayakanur, then over the High Range and into the Coimbatore plains to cut off Tipu Sultan's retreat from Travancore, was the first English man in the High Range appears to be belied by the dates involved. If the story is a dozen years too early for Wellesley, it is quite possible that some other officer in General Meadow's Army may have had that distinction. Unfortunately, no record of that pioneering mountain crossing has been traced. What is available is a record of the surveying of this terrain in 1816-17 by Lt Benjamin Swayne Ward, son of Col Francis Swayne Ward to whom we owe many of the early views of Madras and South India Now available in lithoprints.Ref: Book : A planting Century 1893 - 1993 Author: S.Muthiah Published By: East-West Pvt Ltd., 62-A Ormes Road, Kilpauk, Madras-600010 Year of Publication: 1993 1 Ward and his assistant Lt Eyre Connor were on orders to map the unexplored country between Cochin and Madurai and so they followed the Periyar into the mountains and then headed north into what at that time was described as ‚Äò‚Äò the dark impenetrable forests of the High Range‚Äô‚Äô. They lost men to at least one elephant charge, suffered agony from leech bites and once ran so short of food that a deer run down and being feasted on by wild dogs was manna for the party and their jungle guides. The subsequent report by Ward and Connor was to lead to the Periyar Dam project, completed only in the 1890s,but for the present they were more pre occupied getting into the mountains that they could see towering in the distance from Bodi. Then, on 14 October 1817, ‚Äò‚Äòthe weather having improved the ascent into the High Range began‚Äô‚Äô. Their first major camp was at a flat promontory at 6000 feet. And this was ever afterwards to be known as Top Station. Moving north, they saw to their south the Cardamom Hills, a slope 45 miles long and 30 wide from the heights above Bodi stretching into Travancore. To their north there appeared to be grasslands on high rock peaks. And in front of them, ‚Äò‚Äòan outstanding mountain, shaped like an elephant‚Äôs head‚Äô‚Äô. On 8 November, they established camp at the confluence of three rivers, which they judged to be the centre of the district, and from Munnar (Moonar ‚Äì three rivers), as it came to be known, they surveyed the area, discovered the ancient village of Neramangalam in ruins but surmised that it might well have been from here that ivory and peacock feathers, pepper and cardamom, sandalwood and other timber went to the lands to the West across the Arabian Sea\\". It was to be nearly 50 years later that Sir Charles Trevelyan, Governor of Madras, instructed Col Douglas Hamilton to explore the hill country in the western part of the Madras Presidency, requesting special advice on the feasibility of establishing sanatoria for the British in the South and of developing revenue- earning projects without endangering the environment, as had happened in Ceylon where coffee had destroyed not only the rain forest but also paddy cultivation in the north ‚Äì central rice bowl of ancient Ceylon. Marching south along the Anamallai, Hamilton saw ‚Äò‚Äòthe grandest and most extensive (view) I have ever beheld; some of the precipices are of stupendous magnitude and the charming variety of scenery comprising undulating grassy hills, wooded valleys, rocky crags, overhanging precipices, the green rice fields far below in the valley of the Anchanad, the grand mass of the Pulunies (beyond) and the blue ranges in the far distance, present a view far beyond my power to describe‚Ä¶‚Äô‚Äô On 7 May 1862, Hamilton set out to climb Anaimudi, following a ‚Äò‚Äòwell worn elephant path, ascending the opposite slope by a series of short zigzags that were so perfect and regular that we could scarcely Eravikulam plateau (later Hamilton‚Äôs Plateau), watered by two streams, one of which bordered the Eravikulam swamp before cascading down 1000 feet in a beautiful waterfall. Separating the plateau from Anaimudi was a deep, thickly forested ravine ‚Äì later called Inaccessible Valley and, detouring it, they began the climb from the east to the peak. ‚Äò‚ÄòOn our return, we followed an elephant path for several miles, the gradient of this path was truly wonderful, these sagacious animals avoiding every steep or difficult ascent, except at one hill which was cleverly zigzagged, owing to masses of sheer rock preventing a regular incline being taken.‚Äô‚Äô It was to be 15 years later before another report came in. But this was more significant from the viewpoint of this history, for though it came as a result of the shikar expeditions of the ever-exploring John Daniel Munro, he was an opener ‚Äì up of land and a pioneering planter first and a shikari second. Reporting on the High Range in 1877, he wrote, ‚Äò‚Äò Exclusive of the low Unjenaad valley which is not above 3100 feet, the area within these boundaries may be roughly estimated at 200 square miles with an elevation over 5000 ft ‚Ä¶ Much of this is worthless land, but there is a good deal fit for cultivation ‚Ä¶ Coffee ‚Ä¶ would succeed well at a somewhat lower elevation, and Tea and Cinchona would grow miles available for these purposes, and there being the great inducement of a good climate, it will doubtless not be many years before these fine hills get occupied‚Äô‚Äô. And Munro, who always had a long ‚Äì range view of things, indeed proved right again. Mention has already been made of the journey into these hills by Henry Turner and his half ‚Äì brother ‚ÄòThambi‚Äô A W Turner, the concessions that Munro, then Superintendent of the Cardamom Hills for the Raja of Travancore, got them from the Raja, and the Society the three of them formed in 1879 with Rs 450,000 capital. The agreement they entered into with the Rajah read in part: ‚Äò‚ÄòThe annual sum of one half British rupee on every acre of land other than grassland comprised in such deed which has already been or shall hereafter from time to time be opened up for the purpose of cultivation or otherwise‚Äô‚Äô. While Thambi Turner began in 1879 clearing the forest round the Devikulam camp, later to become the taluk headquarters, Henry returned to Madras and began looking for others willing to take up land here. The first to do so was Baron George Otto Von Rosenberg of Dresden and his sister who were kin of the Turners by marriage. The Baron opened up Manalle, later a part of the family‚Äôs Lockhart Estate, and it was developed by his son Baron John Michael in the 1890s, the first tennis court in the hills being added. It was property that was to remain for years in the family. Then came A H Sharp, who opened up Parvathi in the wilds and planted the first tea, to be followed by C Donovan. In1881 came E J Fowler to open up Aneimudi Estate and in 1882, C O Master and G W Claridge, C W W Martin, a fellow of Henry Turner‚Äôs in the Madras Civil Service , sent his 18 ‚Äì year ‚Äì old nephew Aylmer Ffoulke Martin (Toby) to open Sothuparai near Chittavurrai in 1883 and Toby Martin ever seemed to be clearing new land for others after that. Other estates of this era were H M Knight‚Äôs Surianalle, Panniar belonging to J A Hunter and K E Nicoll and the Turners‚Äô Talliar where the last coffee in the High Range flourished on 700 acres. Every one of them benefited from the experience of Ceylon planter John Payne, whom Henry Turner ‚Äòimported‚Äô in 1881. Payne not only opened up Talliar with coffee for the Turners, but he taught his fellow planters in the High Range road tracing, draining and general thottam work. He also cut a riding road, Payne's Ghat, from Devikulam to Periakanal and opened the district up to ‚Äòcivilisation‚Äô. In the Eighties, it was only their indomitable will that kept the planters going in this wilderness. They lived in grass ‚Äì thatched huts with mud and wattle walls and surrounded their homes with elephant trenches. The only medical aid each planter had was ‚Äò‚Äò his own medicine chest and he had to doctor himself and his coolies with only Doctor Short‚Äôs old book on Medicine in India to help him‚Äô‚Äô. It was 1889 before the pioneers saw the first European woman in the hills. That was when Baron Otto brought up his wife, the daughter of Henry Gribble of the Madras Civil Service; another Gribble girl married one of the Turner brothers. And in 1890 Toby Martin brought his bride ‚Äì and they were to live decades in these hills. An event which helped considerably to improve the lives of the early planters was when Claridge and Toby Martin descended from Top Station to Bottom Station (Koranganie at the head of the Bodi Pass) and went on to Bodinayakanur. There they met Suppan Chetty, who appeared to be the village leader, and negotiated him to send up rice and other provisions by headload and bring down cinchona bark and other products for onward transport. Soon bullocks, donkeys and ponies were brought in to help. This link with Suppan Chetty and his adopted son Alaganan Chetty, later an M L A, was to continue into recent times with their successors, M/s A S Alaganan Chetty & Sons. Another event of significance was the arrival of John Ajoo, A Chinese, at Talliar Estate. One of six Chinese brought out by the East India Company to advice on tea planting and manufacture in the Nilgiris, he was recruited by Henry Turner and sent to the High Range. A small field of tea around the Munnar Estate Manager‚Äôs bungalow was once 13 acres in extent and used to be called ‚ÄòChinaman‚Äôs Field‚Äô. John Ajoo's son John Antony Ajoo later owned a small estate called Vialkadavu next to Talliar in which the Turner family long retained an interest. By 1894, 26 estates, all of them small ‚Äì holdings, were functioning on the Society's lands but none was doing well as the cinchona boom began to go bust. The Society, by now, was in financial difficulties and it advertised its land widely in British and Indian newspapers. One of the first to respond was the North and South Sylhet Company, a subsidiary of Finlay Muir, arrived in India in December 1894 to finalise the transaction, then decided to visit the High Range with his son James and P R Buchanan and W Milne (from Ceylon). Accompanying them was H M Knight, a pioneer in the Anamallais and at the time a prominent proprietary planter. James Muir's record of that journey from 17 December 1894 till 5 January 1895 is not without interest, revealing as it does the conditions of the times. It reads in excerpts: ...arrived at Madras on the morning of 12 December ... next few days were occupied in negotiations regarding the purchase of the shares of the ... Society ...and Rs 69/- per share was the price arranged to be paid after deductions for losses and money spent during the year ended 30 November 1894... ... We arrived at Ammayanayakanur at 11:30 am the train being 23 minutes late, and ... had dinner at 6 pm and about 7‚Äôo clock started in the bullock transit ‚Äì there being four of these carts altogether ‚Äì to do some 40 miles, to a village called Tayne(Theni). The bullock transits, and the carriage of all stores to Bodynaikanur, are managed by the United Carrying Company and one has to write the agent of this company at Ammayanayakanur for all that may be required. After a not very comfortable night in these wagons we arrived at Tayne ... We started for Bodynaikanur ‚Äì Sir John being carried in a chairpart of the way ... In the bullock transits mattresses are necessary and indeed one wants as much as possible under one, so as to break the jolting of the carts. We got away from Tayne shortly after 7, and reached Bodynaikanur about half past ten. The distance is supposed to be only some nine miles, but the bullock carts which carried our things went slowly, and Sir John, being carried part of the way in a chair, also caused delay. A large chair had been specially prepared in Madras, but when we arrived at Tayne we could not find what had become of it, and there was a small one there, which Mr Brown had sent back from Bodynaikanur. On arrival at Body we were advised not to stop long there, but to push on to Mettor the same day as there as severe cholera at Bodi and in the surrounding country ... We found the chair which had been sent from Madras at Bodi and it was sent off with 10 carrying coolies, about one O‚Äô clock, to go three miles along the road to Mettor and to wait there. The weight of the chair was 140 pounds, and the coolies had to be promised extra money when they got to Devikulam to induce them to go. Thirty ‚Äì two coolies went with us from Bodi in addition to the 10 chair coolies, but the larger number of these were required for stores and parts of the tents which had not been already sent on. The bungalow at Bodi ... (had a) very obliging (man who was) a fair cook. (We were very sorry to learn that he has since died of cholera, so that it was most fortunate we hurried on to Mettor, as Mrs Knight and Mr Graham who were only a short time at the bungalow also caught cholera and the former died.) ... As the road was bad and steep the bearers made but little progress, (so Sir John) left the chair ...riding the rest of the way to Mettor ... The distance from Bodi to the foot of the ghaut is about 3 miles, the rest of the way being all an ascent and the road a very poor one, even for pack ponies, and would require a great deal of money to be spent on it would be passable for carts .... The chair coolies were started off ... to go 5 miles along the road to Devikulam ... The road ... would require a great deal to be done to it before it could be fit for bullock cart traffic ... We walked and rode in turn till we got to Devikulam... the distance between Mettor and Devikulam is about 14 ¬Ω miles... At Devikulam ... went over the map of the Society's land with the Baron... ...(at) Mr Grigg's Camp ... Sir John and Mr Milne had numerous conversations with Mr Grigg as to roads, the prompt opening out of the property and other matters connected herewith. Mr Grigg strongly advised that a main road should immediately be made through the centre of the property, that it should be constructed economically, and a careful statement kept of the outlay in connection with it, and he undertook to recover the amount from the Travancore Sircar to continue the road to the West from the Society's boundary to Cochin which he thought would be the best Shipping Port for the Society's produce ... He also thought the alignment of the proposed railway might be so altered as to enable the traffic between Cochin and the Society's estate to be carried on this line to advantage part of the way ... Sir John inquired if Mr Grigg would like to have a piece of land specially made over to him so that he might arrange for an additional house being erected, thereon, for the accommodation of the resident as a health resort. Mr Grigg replied he would very much like to have a suitable site for this purpose not far from where his camp was erected, and a cross was made on the map then, before Sir John, and Mr Grigg indicating the spot, and Sir John undertook to request the directors of the North and the South Sylhet Tea Companies to make a gift of whatever land Mr Grigg, after further consideration, might select for this purpose... The soil in the forest is deep and rich, and the river can be utilized to drive a large quantity of machinery. A beginning should be made here with both Tea and Coffee as soon as the requisite labour can be obtained. The forest is much infested with leeches and precautions had to be taken against them... It is proposed not to decide where to put coffee until the jungle is all burned off, so as the area that will be put into tea and the area that will be put into coffee is not yet fixed. 1 January 1895 It was arranged that Mr Payne should give part of his time to the society to be spent first of all in selecting suitable coffee land inside or outside of the society's boundaries, and that afterwards he should superintend and be entirely responsible for all the work thereon. For this it was arranged that he should receive a salary of Rs 3000/- per annum, for the present, to be paid monthly. Mr A Ff Martin, presently managing Sothuparai was, with Mr Payne's approval, selected to be his first assistant with this work, and it was arranged that Mr Martin should receive a salary of Rs 100/- per month for his partial services as from 1 January 1895, and until the date when he should come over entirely to the service of the society, from which date his salary was to be Rs 300/- per month, for two years and after that Rs 350/- per month, for one year, always provided he gave entire satisfaction to Mr Payne, under whose orders he was to be. This arrangement however was not to come into force until Mr. Martin had cleared himself to Mr Payne's satisfaction of the charges brought against him by Mr James Turner. The road ... from Marioor to Chinnar, is just about as bad as could be imagined, and, in many places, is not unlike the rocky bed of a mountain stream ... it being impossible to ride ‚Äì the horses having to be guided with great care by the syces, but at the end of 3 miles we came to a level road and here we found 3 bullock gharries ... waiting for us ... Sir John lay down in one of them and the other two were loaded with the baggage... The first 4 miles or so of the road that we had to do to Oodamullapet, our destination, were very bad and heavy with sand, and we made very slow progress, but after that we got on to an excellent road ...‚Äô‚Äô H M Knight was appointed the first General Manager, but with his new bride having just died, he was making plans to leave the country. Nevertheless, opening up of the jungle continued under Payne and with other experienced planters brought in from Ceylon. And A Suppan Chetty‚Äôs Pankajam Company at the foot of the ghats. In 1897, the Kannan Devan Hills produce company was registered as a separate company with a capital of 1.5 million and together with, a few years later, the American Direct Tea Trading Company Ltd., another member of the Finlay Group, became holders of almost the entire concession, except for a few estates first planted in the lower reaches by the pioneers. They owned 26 Estates, a few with coffee, most with cinchona. With a growing work force and increasing hills produce, Willie Milne, who had been brought back from Ceylon to become the second General Manager, raised with Toby Martin‚Äôs help a herd of 500 bullocks to ensure transport up and down the ghat. ‚Äò Bullocky Bill‚Äô Lee was put in charge of the cattle farm on the Kundale flats which was tended by vets brought out from England. Communication between estates was by runner and the planters kept horses on the estate for their use ‚Äì and their wives‚Äô. Mrs Toby Martin remembered years later, \\" The rivers were mostly unbridged; so it was quite the thing to dash into them with water up to the girths, hoping to get over fairly dry. The monsoon put great tests on everybody, but then everybody was able to ride well\\". When Milne left for Ceylon in 1899, H Leybourne Davidson became General Manager and transport and communications continued to be a priority, even as more acres were opened and it became certain that tea was to be the main crop. He established telephone communication between all estates. Once it was determined that the Kundale Valley, from Munnar to Chittavurrai Estate and Top Station, was the proper dividing line of the property on which the main road should be laid to feed the estates on either side, he got work going on the road, contracting it to out to the Gordon brothers, and began planning a ropeway from top station to the start of Kotagudi Ghat, Bottom Station. The rope way was an ingenious construction, 2 ¬º miles in length and dropping 5000 feet, built by Gideon and William Kemle from Periyar Dam scrap. The ropeway was opened in 1900 with great fanfare and provided splendid service for many years. Mrs Martin described it \\" as a great and wonderful undertaking. The difficulty of combating the very rocky and steep country together with that of preventing wild elephants from pulling down standards and interfering in general with the work, was great for both engineers and workmen. Besides this, the fever ... caused suffering to many ... Gideon Kemle... died a few years afterwards of (it) ...\\" Once the ropeway was completed, Davidson decided to speed up traffic from Munnar. A monorail trameline was laid from Munnar to Top Station along the road. Large platforms, fitted with one large wheel to run on the road and a smaller wheel to run on a single rail, were drawn by bullocks. Later, ponies, posted at intervals, were used and speeded traffic from about 4 mph to 6 mph. The tea chests were loaded on the platforms and if passengers wanted to use the ‚Äòtram‚Äô two easy chairs were placed on the platform and luggage piled all around them; from Top Station the passengers would have to tolerate the discomfort of bandies to reach Bottom Station and onwards. A tea chest moved from Kannan Devan to England the Davidson way went through various adventures, which is perhaps why Davidson became Sir Leybourne. The tea chest moved from the estates to munnar by bullock cart, be loaded on to the monorail platform to be moved to Top Station, be transported from there in Suppan Chetty's bullock carts to Ammayanayakanur railway station, then by train to Tuticorin, and, finally, by lighter to the steamer in the road! P R Buchanan took over as General Manager in 1901 and there began the fastest, most extensive opening up of the High Ranges, virgin jungles being felled, often with armed watchmen providing the workmen protection from the elephants and other wild life. When, in 1908, he started building a 2‚Äô gauge light steam railway to replace the monorail, another link was added in this ingenious transport chain; the train would bring chests up to the point the tracks had been completed, then the goods were headloaded and taken to what was left of the monorail and its platform! The railway was eventually opened for traffic in 1909 and even had 1st and 2nd class accommodation. When Buchunan left in 1911, Kanan Devan had grown to over 11,500 acres, while Anglo ‚Äì American had over 1500 acres under tea; there were only about 3000 acres held by others, much of which was eventually to be taken over by Malayalam Plantations. Herbert Lloyd Pinches now took over and, taking a cue from the way the ropeway and the pioneering Munnar Factory were powered, he started the Munnar Valley Electric Works, which supplied power to nine factories within a radius of six miles. This was the first electric power supplied for tea manufacture in India. In time, much of the High Range would get its power from the MVEW grid. By 1924, Pinches had ensured that most of the kanan Devan property had been cleared and developed, though development continued till 1932. That was when disaster struck. ‚ÄòThe Flood‚Äô, already referred to, burst upon the High Range in July, parts of it receiving 195‚Äô‚Äô in that month. When a big landslide blocking a road burst, the water gushed into Munnar, flooded the town, damaged the road and destroyed the railtrack. When recovery began, Pinches decided there would be no railway again and decided on a new ropeway, from Munnar to Bodi via Top Station. The first path of this ropeway, work on which was started in 1925, was in three sections, Top Station to Chittavurrai Estate, from there to Sothuparai and Pattupatty, then the third stretch to Munnar. The 14 ¬Ω mile ropeway, with hangers carrying 400 lb loads, could, at full capacity, carry 25 tons a day. The ropeway, which cost a little over Rs 760,000 was opened on 3 December 1926. In 1930, the old Top Station ‚Äì Kotagudi ropeway was replaced by a modern roads thrust their way through the hills and motor transport made the slow ropeways outmoded. As the era of motor transport began to get into its stride, there came World War II followed by the winds of change. How the High Range had grown by then, from about 6000 acres cultivated in 1894 to over 28000 acres in 1952! The changing scene saw the recruitment of Indian planters, Rengaswamy Chetty of the Suppan Chetty family the first Kanan Devan management recruit. But he resigned before long and N S Dhar was recruited. He was to stay with the company over 30 years. In 1964, Finlay‚Äôs teamed with Tata‚Äôs jointly start to the first instant tea factory in the country and by 1967, with devaluation, Finlay‚Äôs began taking a closer look at the new Indian scene. Several European planters, many of them third generation High Rangers, left and, soon, Indian managers outnumbered the expatriates. Then, in 1971, the Kerala Government wanted to ‚Äòresume‚Äô all land in the Kanan Devan Hills that had not been used for plantations. This would have deprived the company of over 18,000 acres of Eucalyptus used for estate fuel, along with hundreds of acres within estate boundaries. Negotiations that went on till 1974 ‚Äì the successful culmination of which marked the Tata Group's subsequent involvement with Kerala ‚Äì led to Government agreeing to leave most of the eucalyptus and all the land within the estates to the company, leaving it with a compact 57,000 acres. And with that the old Kanan Devan concession came to an end. The last of the changes came with the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act of 1973; the Act hastened Finlay's final decision. Finlays diluted their Sterling Share capital by the full 60 per cent (when only 25 per cent was called for at the time for plantation companies) and Tata ‚Äì Finlay's was born on 1 January 1976. A new era had begun in the Indian plantation industry. When Finlay's sold their remaining share holdings, including those in the northeast, in 1983, the company became Tata Tea Ltd., the \\" largest integrated tea company in the world\\". Today Kannan Devan Hills is a popular tourist spot. Due to the harsh working conditions of the Kannan Devan Hills Plantation, the female workforce organized the Munnar Plantation Strike of 2015, which inspired many surrounding plantation workers to better their working conditions. Demographics Western Ghats from Kannan Devan Hills India census, Kanan Devan Hills had a population of 68205 with 34473 males and 33732 females.

In 1893, Crawford, along with brother-in-law, Milo Clinton Treat (1841‚Äì1925) (husband of his late sister Clara Minerva Crawford), formed Emlenton Gas Co., the first natural gas corporation which first operated in Corning, Ohio. Crawford made a fortune after reserves of oil and natural gas were discovered on Eben's farm in 1901. He later formed the Ohio Fuel Supply Company, which merged with the much larger Columbia Gas & Electric in 1926, and became one of the leading American utilities companies of the 20th century. By 1931, he was the chairman of the board of Columbia Gas & Electric, owner of Lone Star Gas Co. in Texas, helped develop Western Public Service Corporation, and a major investor in significant oil and gas reserves in Mexico. He also served as a trustee of the Union Trust Company of Pittsburgh. Personal life In 1927, 66-year-old Crawford married Annie Laurie Warmack (1900‚Äì1984), a native of St. Louis who was 27. She was the daughter of Robert Warmack (1862‚Äì1924), the wealthy founder of the International Shoe Company, and Martha Sharp Warmack (1869‚Äì1956). In 1932, when Crawford was 71, his only child was born, reportedly in Crawford's personal railroad carriage. The family had two homes, one in the Squirrel Hill section of Pittsburgh and a second home (previously his father's residence) at 304 Hill Street, Emlenton, PA. Their daughter was: * Martha Sharp \\"Sunny\\" Crawford (1932‚Äì2008), who married Prince Alfred von Auersperg (d. 1992) in 1957. They divorced in 1965 and she remarried in 1966 to Claus von B√ºlow, a former aide to oilman J. P. Getty. They divorced in 1988, following her injury in 1980, and she died in 2008 after having been in a coma for nearly 28 years. Crawford died on April 6, 1935. Upon his death, he left his estate to his widow and his three-year-old daughter, valued at more than US $100 million (UK¬£75 million). His widow, who remarried in 1957 to Russell Barnett Aitken (1910‚Äì2002), who owned Champ Soleil in Newport, Rhode Island, and their daughter moved to New York City and Greenwich, Connecticut, at a home known as \\"Tamerlane\\".

In 2019, the Bike Park at Sunday River was discontinued, after 13 years of operation. According to resort officials, \\"Topography and other factors contributed to the decision to close.

While the course is open to the public, memberships are also available from Harris Golf, who operates the golf club in partnership with Sunday River. Mountain Biking The Sunday River Mountain Bike Park first opened in the summer of 1991 and was one of the first resorts to offer lift-serviced mountain biking to a full network of trails. The park closed in the fall of 2003, but reopened in August 2007 with some of the original trails, and a few new ones as well. As of 2009, mountain biking is accessed via the Chondola and provides up to 25 miles of terrain. As of the summer of 2019 the mountain bike park is no longer in operation.

Upputhara panchayat, belonging to the block panchayat of Kattappana, is situated in the southern part of Idukki district in the Peermade taluk. The panchayat is bordered by the Periyar River in the east, the Meenmutti Lake in the west, the Chinnar River and the Karintharuvi River in the south and the Kakkathode protected forests in the north. Upputhara is located in the Western Ghats region of Kerala that borders on the neighbouring State of Tamil Nadu. Geographically, Upputhara is divided into six types of land forms; mountains, highly steep land, moderately steep land, valleys, marshy lands and rocky lands. Of these six land forms, about 40 percent of the total area is classified under valleys. Next in importance are marshy lands, slightly steep land, mountains, very steep land and rocky lands, in that order. Valleys and marshy lands together accounted for 62 percent of the area. Owing to the presence of large tracts of land with undulating topography, agriculture in Upputhara is faced with several challenges such as soil erosion. The entire region around Upputhara remained uninhabited till about the early part of the 20th century. Upputhara was one of the regions to which migration of farmers from other parts of Kerala = took place. A group of seven Christian households came to Upputhara in 1910 from the Meenachil taluk of Kottayam district after acquiring licence from the Government of Travancore to establish tea plantations. The first migration to begin cultivation of crops outside the plantation segment took place, however, only later by the mid-1930s. This type of migration to regions outside the plantation segment was mainly steered by a policy of the Government of Travancore to distribute pattas (possession rights) to migrant farmers in previously uninhabited areas. The largest flow of migrants into Upputhara and its surrounding regions took place in the 1950s. Farmers who migrated into Upputhara after the 1930s were primarily involved in the cultivation of coffee, pepper and a few tuber intercrops. Tea was cultivated only in large plantations. From the cultivation of only a few crops in the 1950s, the cropping pattern in Upputhara became diversified significantly by the 1990s. Data for the panchayat for the year 1996-97 shows that the cultivation of tea accounts for the largest area ‚Äì about 59 per cent of the gross cropped area. Pepper, cultivated in 17 per cent of the gross cropped area, is the second most important crop in terms of cultivated area. Coffee (8.1 percent of the gross cropped area) and cardamom (4 percent of the gross cropped area) are the other main crops. Cultivation of banana, tapioca and coconut are also practised. . Upputhara is in news these days following the frequent earthquakes around the place. The villagers are in fear, as the tremours may cause the delicate Mullaperiyar Dam to burst at any time. If the dam breaks, the 1,000 houses in Upputhara will be the first to washed away. Educational institutions * St.Philomena's Higher Secondary School * OM Lower Primary School Hospitals * Community Health Centre (CHC) * Govt Homeopathic Centre Demographics The panchayat comprises an area of 135 km2. India census, Upputhara had a population of 20596 with 10292 males and 10304 females. Scheduled castes formed about 15 percent of the population in that year.

It is the most widely distributed moonwort, growing throughout the Northern Hemisphere across Eurasia and from Alaska to Greenland, as well as temperate parts of the Southern Hemisphere.  Description  This is a small plant growing up to 30cm in height from an underground caudex. The leaf is pinnate and is divided into a sterile frond and a fertile frond. The sterile frond of the leaf has 4 to 9 pairs of fan- shaped leaflets or pinnae. The fertile part of the leaf is very different in shape, with rounded, grapelike clusters of sporangia producing spores by which it reproduces. As in other members of the family Ophioglossaceae, this species is eusporangiate, the sporangia derived from more than one initial cell and having sporangial walls more than one cell thick. Their spores develop into underground, mycotrophic gametophytes. Moonworts die down at the end of summer, frequently lying dormant for several seasons before re-appearing.The Illustrated Field Guide to Ferns and Allied Plants of the British Isles; Jermy & Camus; First edition; 1991  Distribution  Moonwort has a circumpolar distribution, being recorded in Eurasia, North America and Greenland. It also occurs in north Africa, the Himalayas, and temperate zones of Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand and South America.Welsh Ferns; Hutchinson & Thomas; Seventh edition; 1996 Although its distribution is patchy, and it may be locally rare, it is rated as of least concern in The IUCN Red List of threatened species. There is evidence of some decline in the British Isles, and in Ukraine, 189 loci were recorded, 118 before 1980, 58 after 1980 and 13 after 1980. In Britain it is found mainly in the north and west, while in the lowlands of England it has been largely lost and the decline continues. For example, in Worcestershire it had been recorded at seven sites in the past but now appears to be restricted to a single site. Habitat and ecology Botrychium lunaria is a species which grows on relatively dry to moist short grassland, meadows, small woods, heaths and moors frequently on higher ground and rarely in forests, either deciduous or pine, or open woodland. It has also been recorded on dune slacks. Within Europe the common moonwort is a characteristic species of four habitats, namely acid Alpine and sub-Alpine grassland, southern Balkan montane grasslands, closed sand steppes in central Europe and grasslands in Finland and Scandinavia. It will also colonise brownfield sites such as spoil heaps and shale brings, this is especially notable in central Scotland. It has a preference for neutral to alkaline soils, often over limestone or chalk, or in other lime-rich habitats. It occurs up to . In the younger and adult states it is reliant on mycorrhizal relationships and this means that it can be vulnerable to disturbance of the soil. The presence of rotting plant material may be required for this fern to grow successfully.

He is known for his work with Alessandro Cortini of Nine Inch Nails in Modwheelmood, Early life His pursuit of music began early, playing saxophone in jazz orchestras in the afternoon and learning to play Iron Maiden songs in the evenings. Eventually, his desire to play music for a living led him to the United States where he quickly worked his way into the Los Angeles music scene. Musical Collaborations Hillstrom met Nine Inch Nails keyboardist Alessandro Cortini in early 2000. The two began an intense collaboration, forming electro rock act Modwheelmood. The duo released their debut EP, Enemies & Immigrants, on Buddyhead records to critical acclaim. Their busy schedules hindered touring at that time but they have since built an impressive following of loyal fans. Meanwhile, Hillstrom also joined the original Eels bassist Tommy Walter in the band Abandoned Pools. The band toured the US, Japan, Canada, and UK, opening for bands like Lenny Kravitz, Garbage, and The White Stripes. Pelle continued to dig into the scene, working as hired guitarist for producers like Patrick Leonard (Madonna, Elton John, Pink Floyd), Polarbear (Korn, Bootsy Collins, Snoop Dogg), Marc Jameson (Christina Aguilera, Felix da housecat), Redcola (commercials for Nike, Ford, Kodak, etc.), and Brad Wood (Smashing Pumpkins, The Bangles, Pete Yorn). In 2005, he formed the act Forever Like Red and got signed to the Echo Label in the UK and to Chrysalis Publishing in the U.S. The band relocated to London in 2006 and recorded their debut album, Distance. The Sunday Times gave it four stars and called the band the next U2. Hillstrom toured the UK and Scotland extensively in 2007. They opened for acts like Silverchair and Pete Murray, Aerosmith, Crowded House, Jet, and Chris Cornell. The single, What Will You Pay, written by Hillstrom and Cameron Meshell, was aired on BBC 1 and the band's song Dream On was featured in an episode of the hugely popular TV show Hollyoaks in England. Hillstrom worked on various projects as a songwriter and artist for Chrysalis. Modwheelmood has now released five EPs; ? (released in 2003), Enemies & Immigrants (released on Buddyhead in 2006), Pearls to Pigs, Vol. 1 (released in 2007), Pearls to Pigs, Vol. 2 (released in 2008), and Pearls to Pigs, Vol. 3 (released in 2008). As well as Things Will Change, the companion remix disc to Enemies & Immigrants (released in 2007). He continues to work with Cortini and Modwheelmood is producing new material.  Komox  In 2014, Hillstrom joined the lineup of Komox, which includes frontman, Bryce Soderberg (Lifehouse), and drummer, Kris Persson. In January 2016, Komox released their debut EP, Dreaming Awake Volume 1. The band has been performing consistently around Los Angeles, San Diego and Las Vegas. Hillstrom and the rest of Komox signed a management deal with Kamelian, LLC, a label and management company headed by Michael Jackson's nephew and Tito Jackson's eldest son, Taj (3T). Pelle has co-penned two songs, Anything and Human, from the second volume of the Dreaming Awake due for release the summer of 2016.

Education and career Ameisen graduated in 1969 from Universit√© Ren√© Descartes (Paris V) Facult√© de M√©decine Cochin Port-Royal. He had been professor of medicine at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University and an attending physician at New York Presbyterian Hospital for fifteen years, when he opened a cardiology practice in Manhattan in 1994. He was appointed visiting professor of medicine at the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center in 2008 based on his work on the mechanisms and treatment of addiction. Baclofen After hearing anecdotal reports that the muscle relaxant baclofen was, like naltrexone, acamprosate and topiramate, modestly effective at reducing the cravings of addictions, he experimented on himself, and proposed a new treatment model for addiction that is evidence- based. He first postulated that unlike other diseases for which suppression of symptoms is not associated with improvement of prognosis (such as: bacterial pneumonia, relief of unstable angina with medical means without surgery etc...), in addiction, suppression of symptoms (craving, preoccupation, thoughts etc...) should suppress the disease altogether since addiction is, as he observed, a \\"symptom-driven disease\\". Of all \\"anticraving\\" medications used in animals, only one - baclofen - has the unique property of suppressing the motivation to consume cocaine, heroin, alcohol, nicotine and d-amphetamine. The effect is dose-dependent. Since complete suppression of dependence using a medication had never been described in the medical literature, Ameisen wrote up his own case report. The peer reviewed journal, Alcohol and Alcoholism, published it on December 13, 2004, after praising the paper. In his paper, as in those that followed in JAMA, Lancet, CNS Drugs etc., Ameisen urged for randomized trials to test suppression of alcohol dependence using high-dose baclofen. In 2008, Ameisen wrote a best-selling book, The End Of My Addiction, published in France as Le Dernier Verre (The Last Glass), describing his experience of curing his alcoholism with baclofen. In 2007, an Italian team also showed the effectiveness and the safety of baclofen as a treatment for alcohol addiction. Death Ameisen died of a myocardial infarction on July 18, 2013.

Avaris was occupied by Asiatics from the end of the 12th through the 13th Dynasty (early second millennium BC). The site is known primarily for its Minoan frescoes. Tell el- Dab'a, Egypt. Identification of the site Excavations in the area were started in 1885 by √âdouard Naville. Between 1929 and 1939, Pierre Montet excavated at Tanis, 20km to the north, finding remarkably rich tombs. He believed that he found the location of Avaris, and his opinion was widely accepted at the time. Yet others, such as Labib Habachi, one of the pioneering Egyptian Egyptologists, were not convinced. In 1941-42 he excavated at Tell el-Dab'a for the Egyptian Antiquities Service and came to the conclusion that this was in fact Avaris: Recent investigations of cemeteries at Avaris have been conducted as part of thirty years of joint excavations by the Austrian Archaeological Institute of Cairo, led by Manfred Bietak, and since October 2010 by Irene Forstner-M√ºller. An interesting thrust of the latest investigations has to do with the historic epidemic at Avaris in 1715 BC, documented in archaeology and surviving papyrus. The nature of civilization at Tell el-Dab‚Äôa is understood from archaeological examination of the site. Excavations have discovered buildings, namely residences, tombs, and temples, that combine Egyptian and Canaanite architectural styles. The society of Tell el-Dab‚Äôa interacted with individuals from other regions who influenced their frescos. Although the remains have been damaged by the marshy environment as well as by the continual rebuilding and agriculture on the site, archeologists have shown that this city was occupied by a wealthy society with a large sacred precinct and unusual burial practices. From 1951 to 1954, Shehata Adam partly excavated the 12th Dynasty site of Ezbet Rushdi near Tell El-Dab'a. Architecture =Residences= Tell el-Dab‚Äôa experienced an increase in immigration during the period 1610‚Äì1590 BCE. Between 1590 and 1570 BCE, the population of Tell el-Dab‚Äôa faced overcrowding. Due to space restrictions, small houses were built in cemeteries, and children were buried in the doorways of larger houses. Tombs became incorporated into the structure of the houses. During the early Hyksos period, members of lower social classes built their houses around their master‚Äôs house. This is not as evident during the later Hyksos Period due to the overcrowding and damage caused by agriculture. The size of the houses of Tell el-Dab‚Äôa indicates the affluence of the inhabitants. In the north-east periphery area, the houses were very small, reflecting poorer classes. In contrast, in the eastern area of Tell el-Dab‚Äôa, the remains of large houses with stairs leading to upper floors were discovered, indicating that the more wealthy members of the society lived there. Towards the end of the Hyksos period, between 1600 and 1570 BCE, the rulers of Tell el-Dab‚Äôa felt threatened by the possibility of attack. They therefore built a thick enclosure wall around the city for defense. =Tombs= The tomb styles and methods used to bury the dead in Tell el-Dab‚Äôa were Canaanite. The tombs consist of vaulted mud-brick chambers. They reflect the belief in the afterlife of the inhabitants of Tell el-Dab‚Äôa, similar to that of the Egyptians. Grave goods were often buried with the bodies. Servant and donkey burials are recognized as remarkable burial practices of Tell el- Dab‚Äôa. The servant and donkey burials were practiced between 1680 and 1660 BCE. They were most popular during the period of Asiatic immigration at the beginning of the Hyksos reign. The servants were not buried in the same manner as the tomb owners: the servants were buried at a different orientation in the tomb in order to show their position in the hierarchy of Tell el-Dab‚Äôa. They were buried across the tomb entrance, facing the door. This is interpreted as the servants waiting for the instructions of the tomb masters, which would be a component of the ideal life in the afterlife. Three servant burials have been found at Tell el-Dab‚Äôa. The servants appear to have been buried at the same time as the tomb owners during a servant sacrifice. The donkey burials took place throughout the history of Tell el Dab‚Äôa. The donkeys were generally found in pairs in front of the tombs at the site. The donkeys may have been sacrificed when the tomb owner died as they were both buried at the same time. The donkeys emphasize the society‚Äôs belief in the afterlife: donkeys were closely associated with expeditions and could thus be connected with the journey between life and death. =Temples= Excavations at Tell el-Dab‚Äôa have uncovered temples that date to the Hyksos period. The temples exhibit Egyptian and Canaanite styles. By convention, the entrances of the temples are in the north wall and the temples are orientated NNW-SSE. Items such as bronze daggers, ax heads, and jugs have been found at these complexes. The most noteworthy temple is Temple I. It is in the Egyptian style and dates to between 1680 and 1660 BCE. It contains three sanctuaries and in its courtyard, there is evidence of an altar upon which sacrifices may have been made. The outside walls were made of mud-brick that was whitewashed. Traces of blue paint have been found on the walls. Artistic influence =Minoan frescos= In 1987, thousands of fragments of Minoan wall paintings were discovered in the ancient gardens that adjoin the palace complex of Tell el- Dab‚Äôa, on the site of a fortress of the early New Kingdom. The fragments show techniques, subjects, and styles that are characteristic of Minoan frescos. The frescos were applied as buon fresco, a defining aspect of Minoan works. They include scenes of maze-like patterns, bulls and bull-leapers, the flying gallop, griffins, and leopard and lion hunts, images associated with the Minoan artistic culture. The Minoan wall paintings from Tell el-Dab‚Äôa therefore show that the early Manfred Bietak's report on Tell el-Dab'a18th dynasty rulers were open to works and themes from the eastern Mediterranean. The Hyksos and Minoan societies were in contact, potentially through itinerant artists who transferred Minoan technology to Tell el-Dab‚Äôa. The population of Tell el-Dab‚Äôa may have also included Aegean families, resulting in direct connections between Aegean and Egyptian art. The bull-leaping scenes depicted on the fresco fragments are considered to be indistinguishable from those found in Minoan palaces. The theme of bull leaping is identified in particular with Knossos, Crete. The fresco was painted in the Minoan bull-leaping fresco style: a dark-skinned individual with dark, wavy hair wearing Minoan-style clothing, namely the kilt, boots, and armbands, is depicted performing a flip over a bull‚Äôs back. Nanno Marinatos tentatively formed a two-fold scene of the lion and leopard hunting fragments in 1994. Leopards are depicted hunting deer against a red background in the upper scene of the fresco while lions chasing an ibex is illustrated in the lower region. Other fragments show boots. It was thus deduced that a hunting scene was depicted. In addition, Bietak included a photograph of a leopard in his work that shows its rear parts. The animal‚Äôs legs and tail are fully extended in the flying gallop pose in order to show motion, a common representational technique of Minoan art. =Cypriot pottery= Approximately 500 pieces of Cypriot pottery, containing oil and perfume, were discovered at Tell el-Dab‚Äôa. Pendent Line, Cross Line, and White Painted V styles of White Painted Cypriot pottery compose the largest component of exported pottery to Tell el-Dab‚Äôa, indicating that Tell el-Dab‚Äôa had trade relations with Cyprus. The majority of the exported pieces were of the ‚Äúbroad band‚Äù tradition. A single rim fragment from a jar of the White Painted V Fine Line Style was found at the site. The Hyksos citadel must have been constructed towards the end of the Hyksos Period (ph. D/2), as fragments of Cypriot Bichrome Ware have been found in sand dumps deposited in order to raise the land for the construction.Manfred Bietak, The Palatial Precinct at the Nile Branch (Area H) auaris.at Ezbet Rushdi Ezbet Rushdi is a small village about 1 km north-east of Tell el-Daba. A temple and a settlement of the Middle Kingdom period have been discovered there by recent excavations. Previously excavated by Shehata Adam, who discovered a temple east of the village, the Austrian Archaeological Institute re-excavated the site in 1996. It was discovered that, prior to the construction of the temple, there was already an early 12th dynasty settlement there.Ernst Czerny, Ezbet Rushdi www.auaris.at See also *Tanis References Cities in ancient Egypt Archaeological sites in Egypt Former populated places in Egypt Nile Delta Minoan archaeology Hyksos cities in ancient Egypt ","title":"Tell El-Dab'a"},{"id":"20642883","text":"is a former Japanese Nippon Professional Baseball player.

The goal of the IAI is to augment the scientific capacity in the region and to provide information to policy makers in a useful and timely manner. Its primary objective is to encourage research beyond the scope of national programs, by advancing comparative and focused studies based on scientific issues important to the region as a whole. The IAI's Mission To develop the capacity of understanding the integrated impact of present and future global change on regional and continental environments in the Americas and to promote collaborative research and informed action at all levels. The IAI's Core values IAI pursues the principles of scientific excellence, international cooperation and full and open exchange of scientific information relevant to global environmental change. The IAI's Vision The IAI was envisaged as an intergovernmental instrument by which scientists and decision makers of countries throughout the Americas might jointly address the critical issues associated with global change in the region. Background As evidenced by the participation of most of the world's leaders in the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, June 1992, the phenomenon of global change is perceived as one of the most critical challenges facing the world today. Physical and socio-economic evidence of global change related phenomena such as ozone depletion, loss of biological diversity and changes in rainfall patterns and intensity, can be found in all areas of the world. Regardless of whether the particular phenomenon is natural or human-induced, its effects often cross geopolitical borders. Thus, many environmental issues must be addressed scientifically as global or regional problems, with steps towards mitigation or alleviation taken at a national level. History In response to the plea of a regional approach entity to address global change issues, sixteen nationsArgentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, United States, and Uruguay. in the Americas signed the Agreement establishing the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research on May 13, 1992, in Montevideo, Uruguay. The treaty has been ratified by all 16 signatories and has been acceded to by three other American nations.Guatemala, Jamaica, and Venezuela. The agreement came into force on March 12, 1994, thus creating the IAI.. To accomplish IAI's mission and goals, in 1992 contributing scientists and science managers of the region crafted an initial Science Agenda. In 1997, in response to the evolving regional priorities, the IAI Scientific Advisory Committee revised the initial Science Agenda, re-arranged it and included new pressing issues in the current IAI Science Agenda. Each member country participating in the IAI benefits from the enhancement of regional relationships, the establishment of new institutional arrangements, open exchange of scientific data, and information generated by the Institute's research programs, and the implementation of IAI Training and Education Programs. The United States National Science Foundation hosted the IAI Secretariat from September 1994 until September 1996. Afterwards, the IAI became fully operational at the IAI Directorate located in the campus of the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE) in S√£o Jos√© dos Campos, Brazil.

It is a joint venture of HKT and . SUN Mobile store in Choi Yuen Estate. New World Mobility Limited and New World Mobility was a subsidiary and a brand of New World PCS respectively; New World PCS itself was a subsidiary of New World Development. However, New World Development sold the shares of its successor CSL New World Mobility in 2013. The brand New World Mobility was active until 2014, which was changed to SUN Mobile in the same year; but the legal person New World Mobility Limited was once dormant until re-active again in 2008Data in Hong Kong Companies Registry as a joint venture of CSL New World Mobility and Telecom Digital. During the period of dormant, the brand was operated by sister company of New World Mobility Limited. History =New World Mobility= New World Mobility Limited was launched in 1998 and previously parented by New World PCS Limited, which the latter was incorporated in 1995. New World Mobility, as a brand, was launched in 1997. New World Mobility Limited later became dormant in 2003, which the brand was operated by New World PCS directly. New World PCS was also the licence holder of personal communication services since 1996. New World PCS became a public company indirectly, via a backdoor listing. A listed company Asia Logistics Technologies acquired New World PCS Holdings (parent of New World PCS) from New World Development and renamed itself into New World Mobile Holdings in 2004. In March 2006, New World PCS Limited merged with Hong Kong CSL Limited to form a new intermediate holding company called CSL New World Mobility, whose shareholders are Australian telecommunications company Telstra (76.4%) and New World Mobile Holdings (23.6%). New World Mobility became one of the brands of the holding company's mobile services. In October 2006, New World Mobile Holdings sold its 23.6% stakes of the intermediate holding company to New World Mobile Holdings' parent company New World Development. New World PCS Limited was also renamed to CSL Limited, as a subsidiary of the new holding company in 2008. New World Mobility Limited was back from dormant also in 2008, which CSL Limited owned 60% stake since 2008‚Äì09 financial year. The rest of the stake of New World Mobility Limited, was acquired by also in 2008; the latter was a mobile virtual network operator of brands such as \\"Rabbit\\", which bought the network usage from other companies.

Since its founding in 1945, the United Nations political bodies had not discussed LGBT rights (regarding equality regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity) until 1994 through the favorable resolution of the Toonen v. Australia case by the UN Human Rights Committee, which dictated that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states that laws against homosexuality are a violation of human rights. After that, in September 1995, sexual orientation became a topic of debate in the negotiations on the Draft of the 1995 Beijing Platform for ActionShelagh Day (1996) \\"Women's Sexual Autonomy: Universality, Sexual Rights and Sexual Orientation at the Beijing Conference\\". Canadian Women's Studies / Les Cahiers de la Femme, Vol. 16, Number 3.

Book available at: http://www.sxpolitics.org/frontlines/book/index.php, Chapter available at: http://www.sxpolitics.org/frontlines/book/pdf/capitulo9_united_nations.pdf at the 4th World Conference on Women. While the proposed language on \\"sexual orientation\\" was eventually dropped from the text, it was the first time governments took a public and explicit stance for or against the inclusion and recognition of sexual orientation as part of women's right to control their sexuality. Furthermore, at that conference Beverley Palesa Ditsie became the first openly lesbian person to address the United Nations regarding LGBT issues, calling for States to adopt resolutions that recognized sexual diversity. In April 2003, Brazil presented a resolution prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. However, in the ensuing debates the Commission voted to postpone discussions on the resolution until 2004. In December 2006, the discussions expanded to include gender identity, when Norway presented a joint statement on human rights violations based on sexual orientation and gender identity at the Commission on Human Rights on behalf of 54 states. This was followed by a joint statement presented at the General Assembly by Argentina on behalf of 66 states in December 2008. The 2008 statement in support of LGBT rights in the General Assembly prompted a statement backed by the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in opposition to LGBT rights. Both statements remain open for signature, and neither has been officially adopted by the General Assembly. On June 17, 2011, South Africa led a resolution at the UNHRC requesting that the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) draft a report \\"documenting discriminatory laws and practices and acts of violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity\\" to follow up and implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action.Human Rights Council Resolution, 17th session The resolution passed with 23 votes in favour to 19 against, with 3 abstentions. It was the first such resolution and was hailed as \\"historic\\". The report, which came out in December 2011, documented human rights violations based on sexual orientation and gender identity, including hate crimes, criminalization of homosexuality, and discrimination. High Commissioner Navi Pillay called for equitable ages of consent; comprehensive laws against discrimination based on sexual orientation; prompt investigation and recording of hate crime incidents; the repeal of laws criminalizing homosexuality; and other measures to ensure the protection of the rights of LGBT persons. The text of the report from the UNHRC is dated on 17 November 2011.Discriminatory laws and practices and acts of violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity, A.HRC/19/41 In July 2014, the United Nations (as an employer) announced it would extend equal benefits to employees in same-sex unions entered into in jurisdictions where they are legal. In September 2014, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Uruguay led on a follow up resolution at the UNHRC. This second resolution on \\"human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity\\" passed with an increased vote margin (25 to 14, 7 abstentions), reflecting the trend for increased support by member states to address these issues at the international level. It requested the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to update the 2011 report \\"with a view to sharing good practices and ways to overcome violence and discrimination, in application of existing international human rights law and standards\\". The update was presented to the Human Rights Council in June 2015. In 2016, the UNHRC passed a resolution to appoint an Independent Expert to find the causes of violence and discrimination against people due to their gender identity and sexual orientation, and discuss with governments about how to protect those people. This long-term OHCHR-based mandate has been seen as the UN's \\"most overt expression of gay rights as human rights\\". Also in 2016, the UN Security Council condemned the Orlando nightclub shooting; this statement marked the first time the U.N. Security Council used language recognizing violence targeting the LGBT community. Background Same-sex relationships are currently illegal in 72 countries and punishable by death in eight. In the 1980s, early United Nations reports on the HIV/AIDS pandemic made some reference to homosexuality. The 1986 Human Freedom Index, in judging the human rights record of each nation, included a specific question with regards to the existence of criminal laws against homosexuality. In its 1994 decision in Toonen v. Australia, the UN Human Rights Committee‚Äîwhich is responsible for the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)‚Äîdeclared that laws criminalizing consensual same-sex relations between adults are in violation of international human rights law. In 2003, Brazil tabled a Resolution at the UN Commission on Human Rights, stressing that human rights apply to all human beings regardless of sexual orientation. The resolution was indefinitely deferred (the Commission itself ceased in 2006 when the UN replaced it with the Human Rights Council). Since 2008, the 34 member countries of the Organization of American States have unanimously approved a series of resolutions affirming that human rights protections extend to sexual orientation and gender identity. Since 2000, the UN General Assembly has included a reference to sexual orientation in its biennial resolutions on extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary executions, as did the former Commission on Human Rights. The latter had also addressed the use of the death penalty for sexual relations between consenting adults in its annual resolutions on the death penalty between 2002 and 2005. In recent years the General Assembly resolution on executions also covered gender identity as a ground for protection.  Joint statements  A series of joint statements on sexual orientation and gender identity by Member States at the UN General Assembly and Human Rights Council between 2006 and 2011 provides evidence of increasing support for the issues among UN Member States. Following meetings between international advocacy leader Louis George Tin and French Minister of Human Rights and Foreign Affairs Rama Yade in early 2008, Yade announced that she would appeal at the UN for the universal decriminalization of homosexuality; the appeal was quickly taken up as an international concern. Co-sponsored by France (which then held the rotating presidency of the EU) and the Netherlands on behalf of the EU, the declaration had been intended as a resolution; it was decided to use the format of a declaration of a limited group of states because there was not enough support for the adoption of an official resolution by the General Assembly as a whole. The declaration was read out into the General Assembly Record by Ambassador Jorge Arg√ºello of Argentina on 18 December 2008‚Äîthe first declaration concerning gay rights read in the General Assembly. The statement includes a condemnation of violence, harassment, discrimination, exclusion, stigmatization, and prejudice based on sexual orientation and gender identity that undermine personal integrity and dignity. It also includes condemnation of killings and executions, torture, arbitrary arrest, and deprivation of economic, social, and cultural rights on those grounds. The statement asserts: \\"we recall the statement in 2006 before the Human Rights Council by fifty four countries requesting the President of the Council to provide an opportunity, at an appropriate future session of the Council, for discussing these violations\\". Additionally, it says \\"we commend the attention paid to those issues by special procedures of the Human Rights Council and treaty bodies and encourage them to continue to integrate consideration of human rights violations based on sexual orientation and gender identity within their relevant mandate\\", indicating the Yogyakarta Principles, which provide definitions in detail on sexual orientation and on gender identity as a document on international human rights law.The Preamble of The Yogyakarta Principles =Support= Several speakers addressing a conference on the declaration noted that in many countries laws against homosexuality stemmed as much from the British colonial past as from alleged religious or tradition reasons. Voicing France's support for the draft declaration, Rama Yade asked: \\"How can we tolerate the fact that people are stoned, hanged, decapitated and tortured only because of their sexual orientation?\\" UK-based activist Peter Tatchell said of the declaration: Signatories 96 member-states of the United Nations have sponsored the declaration in support of LGBTQ+ rights in the General Assembly, in the UNHRC, or in both. Sponsoring nations are listed below.In turnaround, US signs UN gay rights document. Reuters. March 18, 2009http://m.hrw.org/news/2014/09/26/un- landmark-resolution-anti-gay-bias Africa  (formerly opposition)  (formerly opposition) * (initiative) Americas   (initiative)    (initiative) Asia   * Europe    (initiative)     (initiative) * Signed as \\"the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia\\"   (initiative)  * Oceania  (formerly opposition)   =Opposition= Among the first to voice opposition for the declaration, in early December 2008, was the Holy See's Permanent Observer at the United Nations, Archbishop Celestino Migliore, who claimed that the declaration could be used to force countries to recognise same-sex marriage: \\"If adopted, they would create new and implacable discriminations. For example, states which do not recognise same-sex unions as 'matrimony' will be pilloried and made an object of pressure.\\" A key part of the Vatican opposition to the draft Declaration relates to the concept of gender identity. In a statement on 19 December, Archbishop Migliore noted: \\"In particular, the categories 'sexual orientation' and 'gender identity', used in the text, find no recognition or clear and agreed definition in international law. If they had to be taken into consideration in the proclaiming and implementing of fundamental rights, these would create serious uncertainty in the law as well as undermine the ability of States to enter into and enforce new and existing human rights conventions and standards.\\" However, Archbishop Migliore also made clear the Vatican's opposition to legal discrimination against homosexuals: \\"The Holy See continues to advocate that every sign of unjust discrimination towards homosexual persons should be avoided and urges States to do away with criminal penalties against them.\\" In an editorial response, the Italian newspaper La Stampa called the Vatican's reasoning \\"grotesque\\", claiming that the Vatican feared a \\"chain reaction in favour of legally recognised homosexual unions in countries, like Italy, where there is currently no legislation.\\" The United States, citing conflicts with US law, originally opposed the adoption of the nonbinding measure, as did Russia, China, the Holy See, and members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). The Obama administration changed the US position to support the measure in February 2009. An alternative statement, supported by 57 member nations, was read by the Syrian representative in the General Assembly. The OIC-led statement rejected the idea that sexual orientation is a matter of genetic coding and claimed that the declaration threatened to undermine the international framework of human rights, adding that the statement \\"delves into matters which fall essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of states\\" and could lead to \\"the social normalization, and possibly the legitimization, of many deplorable acts including paedophilia\\". The OIC failed in a related attempt to delete the phrase \\"sexual orientation\\" from a Swedish-backed formal resolution condemning summary executions. Recently, though, the phrase was removed (with 79 votes to 70) and then subsequently restored (by a vote of 93 to 55). Signatories In 2008, 57 UN member nations initially co-sponsored the opposing statement. Three countries (Fiji, Rwanda and Sierra Leone) later switched their position to support the original resolution backing LGBTQ+ rights in 2011, leaving 54 countries as continued sponsors of the statement opposing LGBTQ+ rights. The countries that removed themselves as co-sponsors of the statement opposing LGBTQ+ rights are specifically noted below (all subsequently sponsored the statement supporting LGBTQ+ rights). Africa         Americas * Asia      (initiative)  Oceania  - Switched to declaration supporting LGBTQ+ rights in 2011.  The United Nations LGBTI Core Group  An informal group of United Nations Member States was established in 2008 to focus on LGBTI rights intergovernmentally‚Äîby (most notably) ongoing collaboration between Global South and Global North state diplomats. , the UN LGBTI Core Group is co-chaired by Argentina and the Netherlands; includes further Member States Albania, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Ecuador, El Salvador, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Montenegro, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States and Uruguay; the European Union (UN-recognized regional body of states); the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (UN executive agency); and two non-governmental organizations, Human Rights Watch and Outright Action International. Unclassified discussions open to the public at UNHQ occur once or twice a year and an RSVP is regularly announced on Twitter. An event held on December 10, 2015 looked at The Economic Cost of LGBT Exclusion and offered fiscal effects from exclusionary practices from the World Bank who estimated it to be 5% of GDP and included the companion video released by the UN's Free & Equal campaign. International concerns of the UN such as extreme hunger or clean water supplies could be remedied if this 5% of GDP was reallocated. At that meeting, the UNDP announced the launch of their LGBTI Inclusions Index, a global collection of data which they hope will help sway minds and move countries toward a brighter future for LGBTQ+ citizens. Another topic speaker on that day was the CEO of Out & Equal who recounted her 20-year efforts working with Fortune 500 and 1000 companies watching them move from 5% inclusion in 1995 to 90% inclusion by 2015. On September 20, 2017, the Group held an event entitled Ending Violence and Discrimination against LGBTI Persons. This included firsthand reports of Human Rights violations. For May 17, 2018 on International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia, the UN LGBTI Core Group Special Event Celebrating our Allies opened with remarks by the UK Ambassador. During the 2018 UN LGBTI Core Group meeting, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said: \\"More than 70 countries criminalise consensual same-sex relationships, and also criminalise transgender people based on their appearance. These laws subject LGBTQ+ people to long prison sentences, and in some cases physical punishment. They also implicitly encourage prejudice, hatred and violence. But laws can change (‚Ä¶) we need to see more countries taking steps to bring their laws and practices in line with the fundamental equality of all their people. It is essential that we defend and protect the LGBTI community, from every kind of violence and discrimination. There should be nothing 'controversial' about stopping people being murdered, or executed by agents of the State, simply because of who they are or whom they love. Tackling extreme violence does not require new norms.\\" UN Human Rights Council A resolution submitted by South Africa requesting a study on discrimination and sexual orientation (A/HRC/17/19) passed, 23 to 19, with 3 abstentions, in the UNHRC on June 17, 2011. This is the first time that any United Nations body approved a resolution affirming the rights of LGBTQ+ people. The resolution called on the office of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay to draw up the first UN report \\"documenting discriminatory laws and practices and acts of violence against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity\\". The votes on this resolution were as follows: African States (13) ' initiative' * ‚Äî No * ‚Äî Abstain * ‚Äî No * ‚Äî No * ‚Äî No * ‚Äî No * ‚Äî Suspended * ‚Äî No * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî No * ‚Äî No * ‚Äî No * ‚Äî Abstain Asian States (13) * ‚Äî No * ‚Äî No * ‚Äî Abstain * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî No * ‚Äî Absent * ‚Äî No * ‚Äî No * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî No * ‚Äî No * ‚Äî No * ‚Äî Yes Eastern European States (6) * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî No * ‚Äî No * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî Yes Latin American & Caribbean States (8) * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî Yes Western European & Other States (7) * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî Yes The High Commissioner's report, released December 2011, found that violence against LGBTQ+ persons remains common, and confirmed that \\"Seventy-six countries retain laws that are used to criminalize people on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity\\" (para. 40), and that \\"In at least five countries the death penalty may be applied to those found guilty of offences relating to consensual, adult homosexual conduct\\" (para. 45). The High Commissioner's report led to a panel discussion by the Human Rights Council in March 2012. The divided nature of the UN (and the Council in particular) was again evident. Former UN Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon described violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation as \\"a monumental tragedy for those affected and a stain on the collective consciousness\\" (para. 3), and many others voiced similar concerns. However, \\"A number of states had signaled their opposition to any discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity by leaving the Council chamber at the start of the meeting\\", and \\"A number voiced their opposition on cultural or religious grounds, or argued that sexual orientation and gender identity were new concepts that lay outside the framework of international human rights law\\" (para. 11) The UNHRC adopted a second resolution related to sexual orientation and gender identity on September 26, 2014. Among other things, the resolution calls a report from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on best practices for combating discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. It passed by a vote of 25 to 14, marking the first time the UNHRC adopted a resolution on sexual orientation and gender identity with the majority of its members. The second resolution voting was as follows: African States (13) ' initiative' * ‚Äî No * ‚Äî Absent * ‚Äî No * ‚Äî Abstain * ‚Äî Abstain * ‚Äî No * ‚Äî No * ‚Äî No * ‚Äî No * ‚Äî No * ‚Äî Abstain * ‚Äî Abstain * ‚Äî Yes Asian States (13) * ‚Äî Abstain * ‚Äî Abstain * ‚Äî No * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî Abstain * ‚Äî No * ‚Äî No * ‚Äî No * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî No * ‚Äî No * ‚Äî Yes Eastern European States (6) * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî No * ‚Äî Yes Latin American & Caribbean States (8) * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî Yes Western European & Other States (7) * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî Yes * ‚Äî Yes =Independent Expert on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity= In 2016, the UNHRC passed a resolution to appoint an independent expert to find the causes of violence and discrimination against people due to their gender identity and sexual orientation, and discuss with governments about how to protect those people. Accordingly, Vitit Muntarbhorn, a Thai international law professor experienced in UN fieldwork, was the first UN Independent Expert on Protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity (IE-SOGI). Victor Madrigal-Borloz, a Costa Rican jurist experienced in human rights internationally, started 1 January 2018 as the second and current mandate-holder.{ On July 12, 2019 a vote to renew this position for another three years was passed by the Human Rights Council. =Intersex rights resolution= In March 2019, the United Nations Human Rights Council adopted without a vote a resolution brought by South Africa on the rights of intersex people that \\"expresses concerns about existing discriminatory regulations, rules and practices that require some women and girl athletes to medically reduce their blood testosterone levels by undergoing unnecessary, humiliating and harmful medical procedures or hormone therapy in order to participate in women's events in competitive sports\\". The resolution also requests the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner of Human Rights to prepare a report on the intersections between race and gender discrimination in sports. It recognises the multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination that women and girls face in sports settings, because of their race and sex, and the right to bodily integrity and autonomy, among other things. UN Secretary-General and Secretariat On 25 September 2018, United Nations Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres expressed support for a move towards greater respect for LGBTQ+ rights. In a pre-recorded speech, he addressed members of the UN LGBTI Core Group. He also praised India for legalising gay sex after the repeal of Section 377. He told attendees: \\"The United Nations stands up for the rights of the LGBTI community. Many of its members are imprisoned, abused and even killed simply for who they are or whom they love.\\" He added: \\"Progress has been made in recent years, including this month with the decision by the Supreme Court of India. But so long as people face criminalisation, bias and violence based on their sexual orientation, gender identity or sex characteristics, we must redouble our efforts to end these violations. As we celebrate the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, let me underscore that the United Nations will never give up the fight until everyone can live free and equal in dignity and rights.\\" His speech was well received by LGBTQ+ activists, who praised it as an encouraging step. =Treatment of UN staff= In July 2014, it was announced that the United Nations (as an employer) would extend equal benefits to its employees who have entered into same-sex unions in jurisdictions where they are legal. Under the new policy, staff who have married a same-sex spouse in a jurisdiction will receive the same benefits and recognition as those in heterosexual marriages, regardless of whether same-sex marriage is legal in their country of citizenship. Former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon supported a move towards greater respect for gay rights. He stated: \\"Human rights are at the core of the mission of the United Nations. I am proud to stand for greater equality for all staff, and I call on all members of our UN family to unite in rejecting homophobia as discrimination that can never be tolerated at our workplace.\\"United Nations will now recognize gay marriage  UN agencies and entities  Agencies and entities in the UN system have increasingly addressed human rights issues relating to sexual orientation, gender identity and intersex status in recent years. An early and important milestone was in 1994 when the World Health Organisation clarified that homosexuality was neither a disorder nor a disease when it removed sexual orientation from the International Classification of Diseases. Since then other UN entities have made efforts to integrate issues concerning LGBTI persons into their work, including the OHCHR, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the International Labour Organization (ILO), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). For example, in 2013 the ILO issued the results of a pilot research on discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity; in 2014, UNDP released a discussion paper on transgender health and human rights; also that year, UNICEF published an issues paper on eliminating discrimination against children and parents based on sexual orientation and/or gender identity; and since 2013 the OHCHR has dedicated ongoing efforts to produce a multipronged awareness-raising campaign, ‚ÄúFree & Equal‚Äù, relating to the human rights of LGBTI persons. In 2014, the OHCHR, UNDP, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF, UN Women, ILO, UNESCO, WHO, the World Bank and UNAIDS issued a joint report providing a snapshot of the work of UN bodies in combating discrimination and violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity, and related work in support of LGBTI communities around the world, together with a contact list of focal points in each UN entity and links and references to documents, reports and other materials that can be consulted for further information. In 2015, the ILO, OHCHR, UNAIDS, UNDP, UNESCO, UNFPA, UNHCR, UNICEF, UNODC, UN Women, WFP and WHO issued a joint statement calling on States to act urgently to end violence and discrimination against LGBTI adults, adolescents and children.

C. Hope, was a British born civil servant of the Government of India. His duties included Public Works, and he was an active layman of the Anglican Church.  Life  Hope Bridge of Surat was built on Tapi river when he was district collector and magistrate. The bridge's foundation was laid in 1874 and it was completed in 1877. The bridge was dismantled in 2015 and replaced by new bridge keeping the old design of Hope Bridge. Born in 1831, Theodore Hope was the only child of Dr. James Hope, F.R.S., a wealthy physician at St George's Hospital, whose research in connection with heart disease was cut short by his death from consumption in middle life. Theodore's mother, Anne was an author. Hope was privately educated for the most part, with spells at Rugby School, and afterwards at Haileybury, then the East India Company's college. From frequent yachting practice abroad he was able to secure a master's certificate before he was 20; and when he joined the Bombay Civil Service in 1853 he spoke five European languages. Within two years of landing Hope became Inspector in Gujarat, India for the newly formed Education Department. With native scholars such as Dalpatram, he prepared a series of Gujarati textbooks later come to be known as Hope Vachanmala (Hope's Readers). Next he served Sir George Clerk, the Governor, as private secretary, and then was given charge of the Ahmedabad district, where he pursued his archeological hobbies, and when he came home on long leave in 1865-66 he published three large works of the architectural monuments of Ahmedabad, Bijapur, and Dharwar. Returning to India, he spent eight years as Collector of Surat, and in 1871 he was called to Bombay, to preside over a committee appointed to deal with the unsatisfactory state of municipal finance. For a time he filled the post of the Commissioner there. He represented his province in the Viceregal Legislature in India and served also as secretary in the Revenue Department, and was made Secretary for Famine at the close of 1876. In 1880 he was appointed provisional member of the Bombay Government, but did not take up the post, as he was required at headquarters as Secretary of the Finance Department. In 1882 he became Public works Member of the Governor-General's Council and his 5¬Ω years in that position were marked by a railway development which raised the open mileage from 8,000 to 14,000, and also by an advance of 20 per cent in the area of land brought under irrigation. He was made a C.I.E. in 1882, and a K.C.S.I. four years later. He left India in 1888. Sir Theodore married in 1866 to Josephine Fulton, the only daughter of Mr. J. W. Fulton, of Braidujle House, Co. Down. They had no children. He died on 4 July 1915 and is buried at Highgate Cemetery. =Books= He had published Gujarati Bhashanu Vyakaran (The grammar of Gujarati language) (1858) which was one of the earlier attempt to write grammar of Gujarati. another book is Surat, Broach and Other Old Cities of Goojerathttps://www.google.co.in/books/edition/Surat_Broach_and_Other_Old_Cities_of_Goo/zE3UPQAACAAJ?hl=en References External links * 1831 births 1915 deaths Administrators in British India Founders of Indian schools and colleges Gujarati-language writers English-language writers from India Indian Civil Service (British India) officers Knights Commander of the Order of the Star of India Companions of the Order of the Indian Empire ","title":"Theodore Hope"},{"id":"20643365","text":"Zoar is an unincorporated community located in Sussex County, Delaware.

History =Design and Construction= The Saddlehorn Caretaker's House and Garage was designed in 1934 by architect W.G. Carney of the National Park Service's Western Division of the Branch of Plans and Design. The structure was built between 1935 and 1936 by members of the Civil Conservation Corps, its construction being funded with money appropriated from the Emergency Conservation Work (ECW) Act of 1933. The house and the associated properties are located at the intersection of Rim Rock Drive and the Saddlehorn Loop, named after a distinctive nearby rock formation. Many of the construction workers were sourced from the CCC and were hired with New Deal Relief appropriations. They were trained by locally sourced stonemasons and carpenters. The construction was administered by Public Works Administration. Materials for the build were sourced from the immediate vicinity around the site, and from the Rim Rock Drive construction project, which was also located in the Colorado National Monument. =Functions= The structure was designed with a domestic nature in mind. The house and garage was used to shelter workers of the Civilian Conservation Corps. The workers were based out of Camp NM-2-C, which was set up in March 1933 at the Monument Canyon trail-head but was moved to a more permanent location at Saddlehorn. There had been no permanent structure for the CCC to use while working in the area up until the construction of the building. In addition to the Caretaker's house, there had also been plans drawn up in 1935 to construct: *A baseball field (labeled \\"Baseball Field for CCC Camp\\") *A permanent administration building to take over from the Caretaker's house *A recreation hall *A mess hall *A latrine *Five barracks to house workers Plans for a much larger, more permanent camp had been finalized by mid-1935. There is a record from the park's Chief Ranger that one of the structures was set on fire as a fire training exercise. The last buildings were removed in the early 1960s when newer facilities were built elsewhere. The Caretaker's House and Garage ceased to be used in 1942, as the majority of workers either volunteered or were drafted into military service in World War Two. The National Register of Historic Places lists the house and garage as 'vacant/not in use' as of June 2020. Architecture The exterior of the structure is described by Kathy McCoy of the National Park Service as being: \\"...gabled, of moderate rise, and is covered with cedar shingles. The main structure at the gable ends has weatherboard wood siding with exposed log purlin ends. Louvered vents are located under each gable. The residence has one off-center coursed ashlar sandstone chimney. The two small wings at either end of the building have gabled roofs. All wood trim is painted rust color. A detached stone garage is located to the southwest and is associated with the residence.\\"https://npgallery.nps.gov/NRHP/GetAsset/NRHP/94000306_text The interior features a living room, two bedrooms, a kitchen, and bathroom.

This is a hobby that began so a comparison could be made of any two teams in a given sport, so as to get an indication on which team would win and by how many points if a game were played between them. Its intent is predictive as opposed to retrodictive. It compares the strength of all the teams in a given sport in a numerical valued order from the best to the worst, as if all the teams were to play against one another. A team's power rating reflects how a team has performed from all the games played, not just one or two, taking into account wins and losses, the opposing teams' power ratings and the actual score difference of the games played. This explains why team A may have a higher power rating than team B, even though team B may have beaten team A or have a better won/lost record. The ratings are compiled by using only statistical and historical data. The most recent games played are more meaningful in compiling the ratings. Only games played against the teams in the ratings are used to formulate the power ratings. A diminishing returns principle is used to prevent higher rated teams from gaining power rating points and moving up in the rankings when the victory margin is being run up against a weaker team.

The two-mile-long tunnel drains into the Braddock Run tributary of Wills Creek. Tunnel construction The Hoffman Drainage tunnel was an engineering triumph of its age. Built in the period 1903 through 1906, it was hand-driven through solid rock for two miles to provide an outlet for water that was flooding the coal mines. Since the water had proven to be too much for the steam pumps, coal production was stagnating. After an engineering survey of the tunnel project by the Consolidation Coal Company, a contract was let to Mr. Phillip Jenkins, Sr. of Wales. Work was begun from both ends in November 1903 by Jenkins' four sons, William, Edward, James, and Phillip, Jr. The Jenkins crew were familiar with hard rock mining from their native Wales, but this work was different from coal mining. To speed progress, a shaft was sunk 181 feet deep inside Hoffman Mine number 3. From the bottom, the men dug in both directions, giving four working faces, including the exit portals. The tunnel proceeds in a straight line, except for an 18 degree turn located some 400 feet from the east (exit) portal. The tunnel is a uniform 8 feet in height and width, and follows a downgrade of some 1/3 percent. This put the exit 40 feet lower than the drainage area in the mine, which was more than sufficient for adequate flow. The excavation work proceeded in three shifts per day, involving blasting through hard rock. Working conditions were described as \\"wretched\\" due to cold water seepage. The men worked in rubber waders. A pump was added near the exit at the horseshoe curve of the Eckhart Branch of the Cumberland and Pennsylvania Railroad (C&P;), to help control the flow. The miners used lard oil lamps for illumination. Drilling for the blasts was done by hand, with a three-man crew. The excavated rock was removed through Hoffman number 3 mine, and dumped on the slate banks. Later, a mule was lowered into the central shaft, and served there as a draft animal for six months. William Jenkins was in charge of the dynamite and his brother James supervised the digging. They stayed resided at the nearby Clarysville Inn while the work was under way. During the dig, there were only two accidents, and only one man died. The project cost $300,000. The tunnel was punched through on Saturday, July 21, 1906 at 9 pm. It was found to be off by less than three inches. The Frostburg Mining Journal of September 15, 1906, proclaimed, \\"The Great Work Complete.\\" Inside the mines, the pumps were silenced, and gravity took over to lower the water level. It is estimated that 9,000,000 gallons of water were drained in 24 hours. Mining operations The impact on the coal workings was immediate. A tremendous amount of coal, previously inaccessible, was now available, and over 50 additional men were employed to work the coal. In addition, working conditions in the mines improved. Thirteen miles of mine drainage ditches fed the tunnel. Observers noted in the Cumberland News of 1906 that the volume of water carried by Braddock Run was ten times greater after the tunnel had been operating for two months. The draining water's red coloration and odor of sulfur was noted as far downstream as Wills Creek in the Narrows. Maintenance continued until about 1953 and the mines closed around 1960. As of February 2000, the concrete portal arch at the east or drainage end was still standing. The overburden upstream for some 30 meters is gone, and some timbering can be seen in the stream bed. The water seems to emerge upward from the end of a blind canyon and flows through the arch. The inscription on the arch can still be clearly read: \\"1903-1906, Hoffman Drainage Tunnel, Length 2 miles.\\" Aftermath The east end of the tunnel with its associated concrete arch is located next to one of the bridge abutments that carried the C&P; horseshoe curve over the creek at that point. Tunnels such as the Hoffman Drainage Tunnel have been a cause of acid mine drainage. The water flow in February 2000 was quite brisk, with no obvious smell of sulfur, but with a decided red tinge to the water.

It aired immediately after the previous episode, \\"Because You Left\\" and a clip-show that recapped the first four seasons. \\"The Lie\\" was written by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, who were named executive producers prior to the start of production on season five; and directed by executive producer Jack Bender. In 2007, Hugo \\"Hurley\\" Reyes has trouble concealing the lie of the Oceanic 6. Kate Austen meets Sun-Hwa Kwon. At the island, the survivors come under attack by a large unseen force. The episode received mainly positive reviews from critics, with IGN giving the episode 7.8 out of 10, and The A.V. Club awarded it a B+. Plot On the island, the remaining survivors are back in the past, attempting to start a fire, when they are attacked by a barrage of flaming arrows. Some of the survivors are able to escape, but Neil \\"Frogurt\\" and a few others are killed, and James \\"Sawyer\\" Ford (Josh Holloway) and Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell) are separated from the group. Lost in the jungle, they are captured by a group of armed military men who demand to know who they are, asserting that the island is theirs. The men are about to cut off Juliet's hand to extract information, when John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) ambushes them, helping Sawyer and Juliet free themselves. In 2007, following the events of \\"Because You Left\\", Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) and Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) part ways, with Ben taking Locke's body to a butcher for safekeeping. Ben tells Jack to collect any personal items he really wants and meet up with him in six hours.

On the way, Hurley is pulled over by deceased Oceanic Flight 815 survivor and former police officer Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez), who gives him advice on how to avoid the real cops. Upon arriving home, Hurley's dad, David (Cheech Marin), covers for them when the police show up and suggests that Hurley take Sayid to the hospital. Hurley refuses, and David ends up taking Sayid to Jack, who is successful in reviving him. At home, Hurley confesses to his mother Carmen that the Oceanic Six have been lying; she believes him, though doesn't understand his disjointed story.

The three indicators are: * Health: the under-five mortality rate (the probability of dying between birth and five years of age, expressed as a percentage on a scale of 0 to 340 deaths per 1,000 live births). This means that a zero score in this component equals an underfive mortality rate of 0 deaths per 1,000 live births, and a score of 100 equals our upper bound of 340 deaths per 1,000 live births. The upper bound is higher than any country has ever reached; Niger came the closest in the 1990s with 320 under-five deaths per 1,000 live births. * Nutrition: the percentage of under fives who are moderately or severely underweight. The common definition of moderately or severely underweight, which we use here, is being below two standard deviations of the median weight for age of the reference population. * Education: the percentage of primary school-age children who are not enrolled in school. For our measure of education deprivation, we use the opposite of the Net Primary Enrolment rate‚Äîi.e., 100‚Äîthe NER. This gives us the percentage of primary school-age children who are not enrolled. What does the Child Development Index tell us about how children are faring around the world? Are some countries making good progress in improving child well-being? Is it getting worse in other countries? The Child Development Index answers these questions. The index measures child well-being over three periods from 1990. Japan is in first place, scoring just 0.4. Niger in Africa is in 137th place, with the highest score, 58, in 2000‚Äì2006. Overall, child well-being has improved by 34% since 1990, but progress is slow.  Analysis of results  Children are doing worse in Sub-Saharan Africa than any other region. Africa scores 35 in the Index, reflecting the high level of deprivation in primary schooling, child health and child nutrition. It is also making the slowest progress, improving child well-being by only 20% over 1990‚Äì2006. However, progress has been very mixed; some countries in Africa have done incredibly well, while others did spectacularly badly. Countries like Malawi cut child deprivation in half, enrolling more than 90% of primary school children. But some of the poorest children in Africa live in countries suffering from conflict and poor governance; such as Zimbabwe and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Slow progress in reducing child mortality and malnutrition is a particular problem; one in six babies born in Africa will not live to see their fifth birthday. Rich and poor countries worldwide must urgently choose to tackle this problem. East Asia has made considerable progress in child well-being in recent years, improving it by 45% over 1990‚Äì2006, reducing deprivation to a score of just 8.5; only one other developing region, Latin America, scores better. It has the best level of primary school enrolment and has managed to halve its child mortality rate over 1990‚Äì2006. Much of this progress is because of China's significant improvement, where almost two-thirds of the region's children live. China has made tremendous progress in increasing people's incomes; nonetheless 417,000 children under the age of 5 years still died in China in 2006 alone. Countries like Malaysia and Thailand did even better in all 3 of the areas the CDI measures. But, as in other regions of the world, government policy plays an important role in children's lives. For example, Myanmar saw almost no improvement at all. And in many countries, the poorest, most isolated groups are being left behind. South Asia has a high level of deprivation, scoring 26.4; this is 3 times worse than East Asia. It is also making slow progress, improving child well-being by just 32% over 1990‚Äì2006 (compared to East Asia's 45% improvement). This is because India (where almost three-quarters of the region's children live) made the least progress of any country in South Asia; just a 27% improvement. In this region, child nutrition is a substantial obstacle; almost 1 in 2 children is underweight. The region's enrolment indicator improved by 59% while its nutrition indicator improved by only 14%. Higher levels of economic growth in the region are not widely translating into reduced child deprivation. The Latin America and the Caribbean region made substantial progress in improving child well-being in the 1990s, scoring 6.8 in our index of child deprivation, the lowest of any developing country region. It made the most percentage improvement of any region in the world, reducing child deprivation by 57% over the period, 1990-2006. This improvement was largely driven by reductions in child mortality and increases in primary school enrolment. The region's child mortality rate is now the lowest of any developing region. The region's poorer countries, like Peru and El Salvador, have started to catch-up with the levels of child well-being seen in better-off countries in the region. The Middle East and North Africa region scores 11.2 in our index, worse than East Asia but only a third as bad as Sub-Saharan Africa, and has reduced its level of child deprivation by 41% over 1990‚Äì2006. However, there is considerable variation within the region. Yemen is doing poorly, with a large increase in malnutrition over the period. And in several countries, such as Djibouti and Jordan, progress has stalled in some areas. In addition, the region includes Iraq, Lebanon, and the occupied Palestinian territory where child deprivation has increased. In contrast, several large countries such as Morocco, Egypt and Algeria have made substantial improvements. Again, little improvement has been made in reducing child malnutrition in the region as a whole. The region containing Central and Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States, for which data are much sparser in the early 1990s, saw an improvement of almost 15% in its index score between 1995‚Äì1999 and 2000‚Äì2006. Its score stands at 9.2, slightly worse than East Asia and slightly better than the Middle East and North Africa. Turkey, with a large child population, made the most progress in the region, reducing its score from 20 in the early 1990s to 7 for 2000‚Äì2006. The Child Development Index shows that there is a low level of deprivation in developed countries in the three basic areas of child rights that it measures. On a scale of 0‚Äì100, these countries score 2.1, the lowest regional Index score worldwide. There is still some variation between these countries however; for example the United States has a child mortality rate that is twice of Japan's and worse even than that of Cuba's. 2008 CDI Report The report was launched in London on 10 December 2008. Its focus was on \\"Holding governments to account for children's wellbeing\\". The paper was written by Sarah Hague at Save the Children UK, with support from Sophie Elmhirst and David Mepham. In headline terms, the report shows that: * there are still high levels of child poverty and deprivation in many countries (albeit often hidden from the public spotlight) * income levels are a poor indicator of progress in reducing child deprivation * children's wellbeing does not necessarily improve in line with adult wellbeing * there is considerable variation ‚Äì between countries, globally and within regions ‚Äì in terms of the rights, opportunities and wellbeing that children enjoy, with the obvious implication that national political and policy choices matter enormously for children's wellbeing.  Criticisms  In a note on the index, Achim Wolf, a student at the University of York, observed that the CDI is obtained by averaging the three variables on health, education and nutrition. This method of aggregation \\"presupposes that these variables can be compared with one another\\", which is however not the case. Indeed, the three units are on different scales and have different ranges, making this method hard to justify in this case. He goes on to offer an alternative index using more established methods and finds that while, in general, the results do not vary considerably, some countries shift by up to 18 places in the ranking. The paper was mentioned in the International Society for Child Indicators' Newsletter of May 2009.

She was the elder of the two daughters of Francis I, Duke of Brittany (died 1450), by his second wife, Isabella of Scotland. Since the Breton War of Succession, Brittany had been understood to operate according to the semi-Salic Law: women could only inherit if the male line had died out. As expected from the provision of the Treaty of Gu√©rande, which ended the war, neither Margaret nor her younger sister Marie were recognized as heirs to the duchy. After her father's death, her uncle Peter II of Brittany succeeded as Duke of Brittany. He was also childless, and to avoid any subsequent dispute, he arranged the marriage of Margaret to his first cousin, Francis of √âtampes, the second in the order of succession and the last male left of the Breton House of Montfort; also, he arranged the marriage of the younger sister Marie to John II, Viscount of Rohan, the most powerful noble in Brittany. On 13 or 16 November 1455, Margaret was married to Francis of √âtampes, her first cousin once removed, at the Ch√¢teau de l'Hermine in Vannes. She became Duchess of Brittany upon his accession in 1458. Their only son John, Count of Montfort, died at a young age. Margaret died on September 25, 1469 at the Ch√¢teau de Nantes in Nantes.

Pi Kap was the first pedagogical sorority. History = Beginnings = On November 17, 1894, in Ypsilanti, Michigan, nine female student from Michigan State Normal School formed a secret club called J.P.N. In a nod to the fashion of the day, the letters of this club stood for Jolly Petticoats Nine. Other J.P.N. members recall the secret meaning as Just Progressive Normalites. For three years, J.P.N. grew as a Latin-lettered club. In 1896, membership was thirteen. In 1897, Alice Eddy Snowden assisted the J.P.N.s to transform themselves to a Greek-lettered organization. After careful consideration of Greek syntax and semantics, Pi Kappa Sigma was chosen as the name. Pi Kappa Sigma planted chapters at different campuses throughout the United States. In 1915, the sorority worked to become national. The first national convention was held. There, goals for increasing membership and chartered chapters were established. A new membership pin was designed. The constitution was revised. Authorization for a publication (the Laurel) was given. Pi Kappa Sigma's status as a \\"pedagogical sorority\\" prevented it from being admitted into the National Panhellenic Conference. = The Association of Education Sororities = In 1917, two members of the Association for Pedagogical Sororities (A.P.S.), Sigma Sigma Sigma and Alpha Sigma Alpha, invited Pi Kap to join their association. Pi Kap accepted, and was soon joined by Delta Sigma Epsilon. At the third national convention of A.P.S., the sororities changed A.P.S. to Association of Education Sororities (A.E.S.) Over the next decade, Theta Sigma Upsilon, Alpha Sigma Tau, and Pi Delta Theta became A.E.S. members. = Becoming an NPC Sorority = In November 1947, the National Panhellenic Conference (NPC) invited Pi Kappa Sigma and her A.E.S. peers into \\"associate membership with reservations.\\" With this invitation the A.E.S. immediately dissolved. In June of the following year, the reservations cited by the NPC were removed. The former A.E.S. sororities became associate members of the NPC. Pi Kappa Sigma, in a 1949 publication, hoped to become a full member by 1951. There were two problems for Pi Kappa Sigma and the move into the NPC. First, many Pi Kaps also held membership in NPC groups, having joined before 1947. These sisters were forced to choose between Pi Kap and their NPC sorority. Pi Kap, like all sororities faced with this adjustment, suffered losses. The second problem was the chartering of chapters at \\"unqualified institutions\\". Under the rules of the NPC, Pi Kap had to withdraw such chapters from the roll until those institutions could attain the proper accreditation. Again, Pi Kap lost members. The history book (1949) included total membership records after the NPC affiliation. The \\"grand total membership\\" was 9,241 sisters. There were 32 active chapters and 15 inactive. National conventions were held every two years from 1915 up to 1931, then every three years. = Merging with Sigma Kappa = Pi Kappa Sigma remained an NPC affiliated sorority for only ten more years. In 1959, it was absorbed by Sigma Kappa.  Insignia and Traditions  The first badge was a shield design with \\"thirteen turquoise set in laurel leaves surrounding Pi Kappa Sigma\\" At the first convention, a new badge was designed. The younger Pi Kaps wanted \\"one with a more definite shield patterns and something symbolic of secrecy\\". The sisters claimed that since other sororities had pins symbolizing secrets, so should the Pi Kappa Sigmas. The second badge was a \\"modified triangular shield with a narrow gold bevel surrounding a field of black enamel. At the top is a small diamond surrounded by thirteen points of gold. Across the center of the field are the Greek letters Pi Kappa Sigma in gold, and beneath them a Greek lamp in gold.\\" The pledge pin was a \\"triangle slightly modified; upper part is of turquoise-blue enamel with the letters Pi Kappa Sigma in gold.\\" The coat-of-arms was authorized by the Grand Chapter in 1927 and is described as a \\"quartered shield [gold and blue] shaped like the pin. Upper dexter quarter is a Greek lamp; in the lower sinister quarter, a five point star; at the point of interest, overlapping the quarters is an open book. The crest is an effulgent star of thirteen points resting upon a wreath. Beneath the shield are two crossed laurel branches; below them is a scroll with Pi Kappa Sigma in Greek letters.\\" The first initiation ritual was that of J.P.N. In October 1902, there was a new initiation and pledge rituals recorded by hand. These rituals were \\"very similar\\" to what the sorority was using in 1949. Minor changes in phrasing and a few additions were done in later years. Pledge ribbons were given to new members before the official pledging ceremony. = Founder's Day Prayer = > Our heavenly Father, we thank thee for the joy of this day.

Kerala State lies in the south-west part of India. In India's Ninth Five-Year Plan, each state within the national federation was expected to draw up its own annual plan and the People's Plan was an offshoot of it.Peoples planning : kerala's dilemma by K P Kannan, Seminar 485 2000 In the beginning of the ninth plan, the Government of Kerala took a bold decision to devolve 35 percent of the state development budget down from a centralized bureaucracy to local governments where local people could determine and implement their own development priorities. This was implemented through the People's Plan Campaign (PPC) under the joint supervision of the Department of Local Self- Government and State Planning Board. New Government in power In 1996 on assuming power, the ruling left democratic party took the agenda of decentralization as the first priority item. Outcome Studies on the performance of the people's planning and decentralization tend to show a mixed trend: it is not a resounding success but also not an utter failure. There were several issues that hampered the plan from the start and these included \\"weak and highly centralised administrative setup and inadequacy in administrative procedure, lack of experience, and inadequate database.\\" These challenges often prevent the state government to pass the financial and management functions to the local level. However, recent developments start to demonstrate efficiencies once administrative controls are eliminated. This is attributed to the elimination of the opportunity for administrative corruption as well as the increased transparency due to the involvement of several people at several levels of the decision-making process.

The band consisted of Victoria Hesketh (vocals, synthesizer), Lucy Catherwood (guitar) and Marie France (bass). Formation The trio met in August 2005 at the University of Leeds. Hesketh answered an online advertisement posted by Lucy Catherwood and Marie France looking for a lead singer to start a band. They were influenced by such artists as The Bangles, Blondie, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Ladytron, The Killers, Billy Idol, Gang of Four, The Slits and The Rapture. The band got their name through randomly picking words from a hat. With only a few songs written, Dead Disco began playing gigs around the north of England; their live gig in the headline slot at the \\"In the City\\" event in Manchester gained them enough recognition to get a recording stint with James Ford. Working with Ford in his London attic studio, the band issued a limited release of their debut single \\"The Treatment\\" in April 2006 on the record label High Voltage. Their second release \\"City Place\\" was a digital-only release through Playlouder Records. With the success of several sell out gigs and an appearance at the Leeds Festival, the band moved to Los Angeles to begin recording their debut album with Greg Kurstin. However, it was around this time that Hesketh herself began to write songs not in keeping with the band's \\"indie\\" style. Choosing a new musical direction, Hesketh left Dead Disco; they officially revealed their disbandment on their Myspace blog in December 2008. In an interview with The Times, Hesketh spoke about her gradual shift away from the band: \\"All the time I'd been hiding my own songs and finally I had to make the sort of music I actually wanted to listen to. [...] Before I used to always think, 'What would a jazz performer do?' or 'What would the band do?'‚ÄîNow it's so easy because it's 'What would I do?' It's just me.\\" In a later interview Hesketh noted that the bands' label was pressuring the group to have a certain style and that her bandmates lost confidence in her because she wanted to write \\"cheesy\\" songs. Releases Dead Disco released four singles: #\\"The Treatment\\" (2005, High Voltage) #\\"City Place\\" (2006, Playlouder) #\\"Automatic\\" (2006, Fierce Panda) #\\"You're Out\\" (2007, 679) For both \\"The Treatment\\" and \\"Automatic\\", Dead Disco teamed up with producer James Ford. \\"Automatic\\" was the final single to be released by label Fierce Panda. \\"You're Out\\" was produced by Greg Kurstin of The Bird and the Bee, who has also worked with Kylie Minogue, Gwen Stefani, Peaches and Sophie Ellis-Bextor. \\"City Place\\" was also included on the 2006 Dance to the Radio compilation What We All Want. Split A Myspace post in December 2008 confirmed that the group had come to an end, and that the members were working on new projects: Hesketh as Little Boots; and Catherwood and France as Video Villain. Catherwood and France also founded clothing brand Art Disco which started originally whilst on tour with Dead Disco due to the high demand they had for their self designed merchandise.

Pang was named as Electoral Affairs Commission chairman for three years from 17 August 2006; following the enactment of the Interception of Communications and Surveillance Ordinance, Pang was named one of the panel judges to consider applications. Judgment controversy In December 2008, Pang came under criticism from Chief Justice Andrew Li for having handed down three different judgments for one case. It appeared that Pang had forgotten what he had ruled in the first place. Leung Chin-man affair Serving as Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Post-service Employment of Civil Servants when the application of old school friend Leung Chin-man was considered, Pang declared his interest and did not partake in the vote. Leung's application was eventually approved, hastily. Pang said the decision to allow Leung to take up employment with a major property developer was based on papers and briefs provided by the Civil Service Bureau, which he considered to be sufficient and accurate at the time. The approval sparked a political storm.

This population probably colonized Norfolk Island from New Zealand during the Pleistocene. It became extinct around the turn of the 20th century.  Ecology  John Hunter's Birds & flowers of New South Wales drawn on the spot in 1788, '89 & '90 By Henrik Gronvold The abundance of the Norfolk pigeon at the time of the island's settlement is unknown. Early records indicate the presence of the bird, but do not contain any information on its numbers. Based on the behaviour of the other subspecies, it is likely that the bird relied upon fruiting plants for food.  Extinction  The extinction of the Norfolk pigeon was caused by a combination of the introduction of cats and weasels, habitat destruction by human settlers, and direct hunting by humans. Prior to European settlement, the bird had been hunted by Polynesian settlers of the island. When Europeans reached the island, however, the birds remained and the Polynesians did not. The Europeans took up the bird as a food source. An officer of the penal colony there, Ensign Abel Dottin William Best, recorded the species as still quite common in 1838, with his journals mentioning his successful hunting of 72 birds, including 25 on September 18, 1838. The last sighting occurred in 1901. Direct hunting by humans was probably the dominant cause of extinction.  Specimens  The first description of the species was given by John Latham, in his 1801 work Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici. Twenty specimens of the Norfolk Pigeon are known. Three of these are in the Natural History Museum, Leiden, two in the Natural History Museum New York and one specimen in World Museum Liverpool. DNA extracted and sequenced from toepad tissue revealed that the Norfolk Island pigeon is genetically sister to the New Zealand Hemiphaga novaeseelandiae population.  Memorials  The Government of Norfolk Island released a stamp commemorating the bird on February 24, 1971.

On February 4, the Russian army, including Cossacks but also some Prussian hussars and commanded by colonel Novosinovits-Menshikov (who took up residence on the Ghent Kouter) entered the town as liberators.Straatnamen Gentbrugge, p 68 (illustrated by the famous Ilya Repin painting) Local enthusiasm turned into concern as 200-300 Russian troops camping just outside Ghent in the fields of Ledeberg (close to present-day Moscou) engaged in plundering from the local peasants. A town delegation went to Brussels to obtain the departure of the Cossacks on February 7, leaving only Prussians in charge of Ghent. Published on the Ghent city administration website.

As French troops continued to resist the Coalition forces, on March 14, the 1st regiment of Don Cossacks, 250 men, commanded by the 80-year-old Colonel Bishalov (soon to be dubbed \\"Peetje Kozak\\" or \\"Grandpa Cossack\\" by the Ghent population) arrived in Ghent. Bishalov resided at the Kouter, but, because of their reputation, the soldiers were not welcome to settle anywhere within city walls and endlessly moved around before, on February 18, they left for the north to defeat a French army unit at Sas van Gent. After this battle, the entire Russian force left for Deinze in the south but Bishalov's Cossacks returned on March 9, again to defend the town against the resisting French. The Cossacks were now housed in tents and granaries in the fields of Ledeberg and Gentbrugge. On March 24, the Cossacks celebrated Emperor Alexander I's accession day, by organizing, amongst other things, a cavalcade in the centre of Ghent, turning the Kouter into a manege. On March 26, after a fierce battle with French troops, Bishalov retreated to Melle, but four days later his troops fought their way back. As French resistance in western Flanders faltered, on April 2, Bishalov finally left Ghent for Mons. Well into the twentieth century, however, Ghent parents would frighten their children into obedience by threatening to get Grandpa Cossack to punish their mischief. When on June 29, Russian Emperor Alexander I visited Ghent, he was only greeted by Prussian troops. During Napoleon Bonaparte's Hundred Days in 1815, a detachment of the Russian army is again reported in the Veldwijk of Gentbrugge. During the 19th and 20th century, Ledeberg and Moscou gradually became part of Ghent city, first turning into residential suburbs and later into working-class housing areas. Moscou was also marked by the construction of a railway junction (serving the Ghent railway lines to Brussels and Antwerp) and of a freight station, both on the border of Gentbrugge and Merelbeke. There was a growing need for public transport to provide easy connections with the centre of Ghent. Tram lines between both ends of Moscou and the South Station neighbourhood of Ghent have operated since the beginning of the 20th century. In 1913, during the Ghent World Exhibition, one of these lines was famously powered by camels.75 Jaar Tramlijn van Gent naar \\"Moscou\\", p 42 (with photograph) Tram 4 on its way to Moscou The tram line between Ghent's main railway station, Sint-Pieters, and the south end of Moscou (now line 4) to which Moscou used to thank most of its notoriety outside Ghent, started operating in 1931. Notwithstanding its population growth, Moscou was never an independent town or village, and with the rest of Gentbrugge became a part of Ghent in 1977. Since this merger of communes, which erased the border between Ledeberg and Gentbrugge, the borders of Moscou have become a little fluid. The Ghent city administration restricts Moscou (merged with the smaller neighbourhood of Vogelhoek) to what used to be part of Gentbrugge, near Merelbeke railway station, Working Together in the Neighbourhood - Ghent city administration but local inhabitants often incorporate adjacent parts of Ledeberg, like the Papeleu park with its Russian-style apartment block A building often said to typify Soviet architecture in Ghent Most of the action in the 2008 Flemish film Moscow, Belgium, which put Moscou on the international map, also takes place in Ledeberg.(Belgian newspaper in Dutch, about the actual location of the filming and the apartment block https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/u11o309e)  Population statistics In 2004 Moscou had 4,747 inhabitants, an 0.8% decrease in comparison with 1997 (during the same period, the population of Ghent increased by 2.8% to 230,723 inhabitants). Moscou's population includes few people of non-Belgian origin (5.4% versus 13.1% in the whole of Ghent) but a rather high proportion of older people (in the 45-64 age bracket).

Life and work  Petrus Ryff was born in Basel, Switzerland. He was the son of Daniel Ryff (1529‚Äì1612), and Ursula Zimmermann, and the grandnephew of Basler chronicler Fridolin Ryff. Petrus Ryff enrolled in the University of his hometown in 1569; he received the B.A. in 1572 and the M.A. degree in 1576. He continued to study medicine, following the lectures of Theodor Zwinger, Thomas Erastus, Felix Plater, and Johann Nicolaus Stupanus. He was awarded his medical doctorate in 1584. After that he practiced medicine for a few years, until he succeeded Christian Wursteisen as Professor of Mathematics at the University of Basel in 1586, a position he held until his death in 1629. In 1596 he became a Consultant of the School of Medicine, where he was an active member and 7 times Dean. He was the author of several books of mathematics, astronomy, and astrology. Among the last is a prognostication for 1594. However, Petrus Ryff is best remembered for continuing and publishing the Basler Chronicles his granduncle Fridolin Ryff maintained between 1514 and 1541. After Fridolin died the chronicles were bequeathed to his daughter Magdalena, who passed them on to Petrus Ryff. He continued the chronicles from 1543‚Äì1585, and in 1585 he published the chronicles. The Basler Chroniken were edited and re-published in 1872 by the Historische und Antiquarische Gesellschaft zu Basel. They provide an invaluable source of information about the history of Basel, and that part of Europe in the 16th century.  Selected works  *De affectibus cordis, disputatio. Basel: 1584.

However, it had no formal organization until the 1950s when it finally adopted the name Knights of the Altar, becoming the official altar servers of then San Roque Parish Cathedral. The Insignia The organization had no previous formal logo. The organizational logo is stylized as a characterization of the service that the altar servers are doing which is composed of the following symbolization: ‚Ä¢ The Four colors (white, violet, red and green) - represent the four liturgical colors appropriate moods to a season of the liturgical year or may highlight a special occasion where (Red ‚Äì blood/fire, Green ‚Äì life, growth, hope, Violet- penance, atonement, expiation, and White - Purity, Holiness, Joy, Innocence and Triumph) ‚Ä¢ The figure wearing long clothing with a heart and semi-emphasized head signify the Altar servers themselves that offer their services holistically and with love and wisdom to the youth, the people and mainly to God.

George was the heir of King George III of the United Kingdom. After the death of George III in 1820, Prince George became King of the United Kingdom and Hanover, as George IV. Caroline became Queen, but George despised her and sought a divorce by accusing his wife of infidelity. Majocchi appeared as a prosecution witness in her subsequent trial for adultery. Though the foundation of his evidence was held to be true, he was widely suspected of perjury and caricatured. Majocchi was hired by Caroline's major-domo, Bartolomeo Pergami, as a manservant in 1815 in Naples.Robins, Jane (2006). Rebel Queen: How the Trial of Caroline Brought England to the Brink of Revolution. Simon & Schuster. . pp.63‚Äì64. By 1818, he had left her service, and in 1819 he gave evidence to the \\"Milan commission\\", which had been set up by the Vice-Chancellor John Leach on the instructions of Prince George to gather evidence of Caroline's adultery.Robins, pp.76‚Äì79. George and Caroline had been estranged for many years, and had led separate lives since 1796 but divorce was illegal under English law unless one of the parties could prove adultery. By mid-1820, George had inherited the throne from his father, George III, and he felt he had enough evidence to get the Parliament of the United Kingdom to agree to a divorce between him and Caroline. On 5 July, a bill was introduced into Parliament \\"to deprive Her Majesty Queen Caroline Amelia Elizabeth of the Title, Prerogatives, Rights, Privileges, and Exemptions of Queen Consort of this Realm; and to dissolve the Marriage between His Majesty and the said Caroline Amelia Elizabeth.\\" The bill charged that Caroline had committed adultery with Bartolomeo Pergami, the head servant of her household, and that consequently she had forfeited her rights to be queen consort. The bill was effectively a public trial of the Queen, whereby the government could call witnesses against Caroline, who would be cross-examined by her legal advisors. By voting on the bill, members of the Houses of Parliament would be both jury and judges.Robins, pp.142‚Äì143. Majocchi was the first witness for the prosecution. The prosecution's reliance on Italian witnesses of low birth led to anti-Italian prejudice in Britain. The witnesses had to be protected from angry mobs,Robins, pp.187‚Äì188. and were depicted in popular prints and pamphlets as venal, corrupt and criminal.Robins, pp.188‚Äì191. Street-sellers sold prints alleging that the Italians had accepted bribes to commit perjury.Robins, p.191. On 21 August, the day Majocchi's testimony opened, Caroline entered the chamber of the House of Lords. Shortly afterward, Majocchi was called. As he was led in, Caroline rose and advanced towards him, flinging back her veil. She apparently recognised him, exclaimed \\"Theodore!\\", and rushed out of the House.The Journal of the Hon. Henry Edward Fox, afterwards fourth and last Lord Holland, 1818‚Äì1830, p.41 quoted in Robins, p.192. Her sudden sensational departure was seen as \\"burst of agony\\" by The Times,The Times, 23 August 1820 but others thought it the mark of a guilty conscience.As recorded in Fox's journal, the letters of Sara Hutchinson, and public placards quoted in The Times newspapers, all quoted in Robins, pp.192 193. It led her defence team to advise her against attending in future unless specifically requested.Thomas Denman, 1st Baron Denman's journal quoted in Robins, p.196. Majocchi implied that Caroline and Pergami had shared a bath. In this contemporary cartoon, Caroline is showered suggestively by a spray of bathwater from Pergami's crotch. Under examination by the Solicitor General for England and Wales John Singleton Copley, Majocchi testified that Caroline and Pergami eat breakfast together, had adjoining bedrooms, and had kissed each other on the lips. He said Pergami's bed was not always slept in, and he had seen Pergami visit the Queen wearing only underwear and a dressing gown.Majocchi's testimony quoted in Robins, p.193. He said that they had slept in the same tent during a trip around the Mediterranean, and that Pergami had attended the Queen, alone, while she was having a bath.Majocchi's testimony quoted in Robins, p.194. The following day, his astonishing testimony continued with the revelation that when Caroline and Pergami were travelling together in a carriage, Pergami kept a bottle with him so he could relieve himself without having to step down from the coach.Majocchi's testimony quoted in Robins, p.196. The situation in the House became more absurd, as the Solicitor General asked Majocchi about a male exotic dancer employed by Caroline, after which Majocchi demonstrated a dance by pulling up his trousers, extending his arms, clicking his fingers, and shouting \\"vima dima!\\", while moving his body up and down in a suggestive fashion.Robins, pp.196, 213‚Äì214. The Times newspaper was disgusted, and informed its readers that it regretted being \\"obliged\\" to report \\"filth of this kind\\". During Majocchi's cross-examination, conducted by Henry Brougham, Majocchi replied \\"Non mi ricordo (I don't recall)\\" more than 200 times. The phrase was repeated so often, it became a national joke, and featured in cartoons and parodies.Robins, pp.197‚Äì199. Majocchi's credibility as a witness was destroyed.Robins, p.199. Eventually, the bill failed but Caroline died less than a year later. She was excluded from the coronation, and was never crowned. The examination of Majocchi led to a significant ruling by the Lords on the legal tactic of witness impeachment by use of the witness's prior inconsistent statement which is still studied in classes on the law of evidence to this day.

The railway station opened with the rest of the line on 2 December 1867 and closed to passengers on the 2 November 1953. The line closed completely in 1963 and was dismantled with the station site becoming part of the Derwent Walk Country Park. The station was infamous at the time for the unsolved 1911 murder of its stationmaster. Unsolved murder On the night of Saturday 7 October 1911 the sixty-year-old stationmaster, Joseph Wilson, was shot when returning home after closing his office at the station. Although he did not die instantly, when questioned, Wilson was unable to say who had shot him. The motive for the killing was probably robbery as Wilson was in the habit of carrying the day's takings from the booking office to his house, a trip of 50 yards, when he left for the night. On the day in question, however, he had transported the money earlier in the day. Although the murder hunt, still one of the largest in the northeast, involved two hundred officers, nobody was convicted of the crime. The prime suspect was the relief porter Samuel Atkinson who was arraigned at the local Magistrates' Court for the murder and sent for trial at the Assize Court in Durham. At the opening of the trial the local Chief Constable William E Morant appeared and offered no evidence against Atkinson, who was released.

In part one, Buffy endures Career Week at school while Spike hires assassins to kill her; a fierce fighter who identifies herself as \\"Kendra the Vampire Slayer\\" shows up in Sunnydale. In part two, Angel is kidnapped by Spike for a ritual in which Drusilla is restored to health.  Plot  = Part one = Spike works on a cure for Drusilla. Dalton, a vampire transcriber, is unable to decipher the book stolen from the library which contains a cure. Drusilla informs Spike that they need a key because the book is in code. Buffy witnesses Dalton stealing an object from a mausoleum, but he escapes when she is distracted by another vampire. She enters her bedroom and finds Angel waiting to warn her of grave danger. Buffy reports to Giles, and he is concerned when she tells him about the theft from the mausoleum. Spike and Drusilla examine the key stolen by Dalton, a gold cross. Spike decides to call the Order of Taraka, an ancient guild of assassins, to rid himself of Buffy once and for all. Back at school, Willow is taken into a secluded lounge area to be recruited by a leading software company, along with Oz, the boy who has been watching her for weeks. At the mausoleum, Giles realizes that Josephus du Lac, the author of the book stolen from the library, is buried there and that the book's key was taken from the mausoleum. The assassins begin to arrive. A large, intimidating man exits a bus, and a door-to-door beauty salesman attacks Buffy's next-door neighbor. A young woman attacks an airplane worker in the cargo hold of a plane, escaping with little difficulty. Giles tells Buffy, Xander, and Willow about the \\"du Lac Cross\\" which can be used as the key, and he enlists their help with further research. Buffy arrives at the ice skating stadium for a date with Angel. She is attacked, but Angel arrives in time to help her fight off the assassin whom she kills with the blade of her skate. Angel, recognizing the assassin's ring, warns Buffy that she should leave Sunnydale and hide. The female from the plane watches from the shadows. The assassin next-door to Buffy's house feeds on the neighbor's body by disintegrating into hundreds of writhing mealworms which can reshape themselves into limbs at will. Buffy is paranoid and jittery, suspicious of each person who passes by in the hallways at school, including Oz. Buffy arrives at Angel's empty home and falls asleep in his bed. Angel goes to Willy's bar for information, and Willy finally confirms Angel's suspicions that Spike is behind the assassins. Before Angel can leave, he is attacked by the mysterious female. She locks him in a metal cage in front of an eastern window, with only a few hours until sunrise. Giles reveals that the missing manuscript contains a ritual to restore a weakened vampire back to health. Xander and Cordelia enter Buffy's house, and Xander searches for her while Cordelia waits downstairs. She hears a knock at the door and lets in the mealworm assassin. In Angel's bedroom, Buffy is attacked by the mysterious woman. They fight, and the woman tells Buffy that her name is Kendra the Vampire Slayer. = Part two = Realising that they are both slayers, Buffy and Kendra go to Giles for assistance in explaining the situation. They learn that Kendra was called when Buffy temporarily died in her fight with The Master in \\"Prophecy Girl\\". Meanwhile, Willy has saved Angel from certain death, but sold him out to Spike. Spike takes Angel back to the warehouse, where he will be held until he can be sacrificed to restore Drusilla to full strength. Xander and Cordelia run and hide in the basement, although before long they are arguing with each other. After an unexpected kiss, they rush to escape, running past the attacking mealworm assassin. At school, Buffy, whose test results recommend a career in law enforcement, attends a career seminar. The police officer leading the seminar tries to shoot Buffy. Oz is shot and slightly injured as he pushes Willow out of harm's way. Kendra comes to Buffy's rescue, and they fight off the attacker. The Scoobies then gather in the library, where Giles announces that Spike intends for Angel to die in the ritual to restore Drusilla. Angel is tortured by Drusilla, both emotionally and physically; she pours holy water on him as she reminds him about how he killed her whole family. Angel taunts Spike with insinuations that Spike is unable to satisfy Drusilla, in the hope that Spike will kill him before he can be used to cure Drusilla. Meanwhile, Kendra gains a newfound respect for Buffy's qualities as a slayer. Later, the slayers go after Willy to learn what happened to Angel; they force Willy to take them to the location of Spike and Angel. However, Willy leads them to the assassins, and the ritual has already begun. Buffy attacks Spike to save Angel, and Kendra and the Scooby Gang arrive to back her up. Xander and Cordelia lure the mealworm assassin underneath a door into a liquid glue trap. Willow and Giles stake a vampire while Buffy and Kendra fight several of their own. Spike starts a fire and rushes to rescue the unconscious Drusilla, hoping that the ritual has had time to cure her. Buffy prevents their exit, crushing them in falling rubble. She helps the weakened Angel to exit the building. With the danger over, it is time for Kendra to leave. Buffy and Kendra discuss their position as slayer. Kendra remarks that Buffy considers slaying to be a job when it is actually a part of who she is. The two, now friends, say their goodbyes and Buffy is left with a new outlook on her position as the slayer, as well as the knowledge that she is no longer alone in her calling. At the remains of the church, Spike lies seriously injured under the rubble. Drusilla rises, the ritual having worked and restored her to full power. She carries her partner out of the debris, promising to return the favor and make him as powerful as her. Production * The hold of the plane in which Kendra arrived in Sunnydale was turned upside down and used as a sewer tunnel in later episodes. The ice rink, called Iceland, is found in Paramount, California, around 25 miles from where Buffy was filmed. * Sarah Michelle Gellar is a fan of ice skating in real life, and lists ice skating as one of her hobbies, which, according to writer Marti Noxon in the DVD commentary for the episode, is the reason ice skating was incorporated into part one. * Seth Green mentioned in an Ultimate TV talk that the line \\"I mock you with my monkey pants\\" was initially dreamt by Alyson Hannigan. Joss Whedon decided to insert it in the episode. Marti Noxon said in her DVD commentary for the episode that all the lines after Oz's compliment about Willow's smile were ad- libbed by Seth and Alyson.

On the night of Justus' death the presbyter (priest or bishop) Sebastian was told in a dream that Justus' body had been washed ashore in spite of the weights meant to hold it down. Sebastian gathered his fellow believers and they went searching for the body, which they found on what is today Riva Grumula. Justus was then buried not far from the shore where he had been found. In late antique times the area near Piazza Hortis in Trieste was a cemeterial one and there is a good possibility that the former basilica of the Holy Martyrs at the corner of Via Ciamician and Via Duca d'Aosta was built on Justus' tomb. In the Middle Ages the body of Justus was translated to a chapel adjacent to the church of Mary Mother of God (present day Duomo), attested since the sixth century. When, in the 10/11c, the chapel was joined to the church, the cathedral, though dedicated to Mary Mother of God, became known as cathedral of Saint Justus. He is patron saint of the city and diocese of Trieste.Catholic on line He is also patron saint of Albona (in Istria), San Giusto Canavese and Misilmeri in Sicily. His feast day is 2 November, but the celebration of it is postponed for liturgical reasons until the following day, and thus 3 November is often given as the date of the feast. Early representations of the saint are limited to Trieste itself, and in particular to the cathedral.Lexikon der christlichen Ikonographie, vol. 7, cols. 257-258 They are: the silk icon in the treasury of the cathedral, the 12th century mosaic in the left apse, where Justus is shown with Saint Servulus, the Romanesque statue on the bell tower, a series of frescoes discovered in the cathedral in 1959, the miniature in the 14/15c breviary of the Chapter of the Cathedral of Trieste.

These sororities are defunct. Individual chapters may have affiliated with National Panhellenic Conference (NPC) sororities.  Aloquin  Aloquin was founded as a co-educational organization in 1905 at Ohio University called The Union. As a co-ed organization, its purpose was \\"to raise social and moral standards of college life.\\" Splitting along gender lines in 1910, the men became affiliated with Phrenocon, a national association, while on September 12 1912, the 65 women of the Ohio University Union became Aloquin, from the combination of the Latin words for \\"why not?\\" This was quickly extended to \\"Why not strengthen? Why not encourage?\\" Its aim was to \\"promote a spirit of democracy and equality.\\" They hoped to establish high ideals of college work. They wanted to \\"foster principles which will develop integrity, morality, and strength of character. ... best type of womanhood... bond of union between students and alma mater.\\".According to the Women's Fraternities blog, accessed 31 Aug 2020. Aloquin's colors were blue and gold. The pin was an \\"A\\" set with sixteen pearls. The sorority held a convention in Athens Ohio on December 12, 1913. A national president and a general secretary were elected. Aloquin sorority chartered two more chapters: * 1905 - Alpha - Ohio University * 1914 - Beta? - Ohio State University * 1915 - Gamma? - Wittenberg College Ohio University's chapter affiliated with Zeta Tau Alpha in 1922; OSU's went with Chi Omega in 1919; Wittenburg's reorganized as Theta Gamma Rho in 1918, and later, became a chapter of Kappa Delta in 1927. Of the OSU chapter, Chi Omega's history recalled that the Aloquins \\"decided that there would be many more advantages derived from membership in a national fraternity than from a local state organization.\\" (Ferguson, p. 188)  Beta Delta Pi (ŒíŒîŒ†)  The Alpha chapter began as D.D.D. in January, 1887 at Bucknell Female Institute. On September 15, 1887, the sorority changed its name to Beta Delta Pi. Little else is known about this sorority. A Beta chapter was chartered at Miss Gordon's Private School in Philadelphia. The Lambda chapter was colonized at Toronto in 1914. Lambda decided \\"something must be done to strengthen our position nationally.\\" ( Alpha Gamma Delta Quarterly, p. 89). The sorority was \\"renewed\\" in 1916 (Women of Today, 1925). The 1917 edition of Toronto's yearbook gave the following chapters: *Alpha, Lewisburg, PA *Beta, Philadelphia, PA *Gamma, New York City, NY *Delta, Stamford, CT *Epsilon, Chevy Chase, MD *Eta, Peekskill-on-the-Hudson, NY *Theta, Hollidaysburg, PA *Iota, Atlantic City, NJ *Lambda, Toronto, Canada The Lambda chapter of Beta Delta Pi affiliated with Alpha Gamma Delta in early 1919. The colors were: nile green and pink (L'Agenda 1895).  Delta Chi Alpha (ŒîŒßŒë)  Delta Chi Alpha was one of the first Greek-lettered organizations for collegiate women. It was founded in May 1878 at Ohio Wesleyan University. The badge was silver with a monogram of the letters \\"encircled by a frosted wreath\\" (Baird's 1879). The colors were cardinal and ecru. In 1879, the membership was twenty-five. In 1882, the fraternity established a Beta chapter at Beaver College. (The Phi Gamma Delta 1882, p. 76). * 1878 - Alpha - Ohio Wesleyan University * 1882 - Beta - Beaver College Alpha chapter, at Ohio Wesleyan, affiliated with Kappa Alpha Theta (Baird's 1898). It is not known what happened to Beta chapter.  Kappa Sigma Tau (ŒöŒ£Œ§)  Kappa Sigma Tau existed at Northwestern University prior to World War I. In 1919, the group reorganized as Campus Club but could not compete with the Y.W.C.A. In April 1922, the group became the Kahniga fraternity. There were 22 founders. The name was soon changed to Kappa Sigma Tau. It collapsed \\"during the war years\\". Baird's (1930) gives the roll as follows: * 1922 - Alpha - Northwestern University * 1924 - Beta - Illinois * 1927 - Gamma - Mississippi * 1928 - Delta - Lake Forest College There was a national council meeting at a convention. The journal was The Gold and White. The badge was \\"a gold crescent with a row of ten pearls on the left side and one pearl at the point on the right. Gold letters spelling Kappa Sigma Tau are placed vertically on a raised onyx crescent in the center of the badge\\" (Baird's 1930, p. 602). The colors were Gold and White. The flower was the yellow rose. yellow rose. The coat-of-arms was \\"on a fess between three mullets in chief and a lamp in bend a pair of balances. Crest is a crescent\\" (Butterfield, p. 46). The Lake Forest's Delta chapter affiliated with Alpha Xi Delta in 1932. The other three dissolved.  Phi Delta (Œ¶Œî)  Phi Delta was created from the combination of two local sororities: Sigma Epsilon (New York University, 1919) and Alpha Delta Omicron (New York State Teachers College at Albany). These two groups came together to form Phi Delta on 19 January, 1927. (Although October 25, 1919, the founding date of the eldest unit was explained as the official founding date). Baird's (1930) stated the objects are \\"to create a friendly spirit among the girls of the institutions represented, to uphold the honor spirit of the institution, and to develop the abilities of members for most effective college life\\" (p. 322). By 1930, there were six active chapters, apparently coming from six different local chapters, with a total of 223 members: * 1919 - Alpha New York State Teachers College at Albany [Phi Delta] * 1919 - Beta New York University (NYU) [Sigma Epsilon] * 1927 - Gamma UCLA [Pi Sigma] * 1927 - Epsilon Cincinnati [Phi Beta] * 1927 - Zeta George Washington University (GWU) [Alpha Sigma Theta] * 1929 - Eta Temple University [Phi Alpha] SUNY Albany's online archives state that Phi Delta was founded for Protestant women, and that it was the first sorority for Protestant women founded at a state university. Baird's (1930) described the insignia thus: \\"The badge is a Phi, studded with pearls, superimposed upon a plain gold Delta. The pledge pin is a black shield with a gold sword and star. Colors are gold and black. The flower is the yellow tea rose\\" (p. 322). The Phi Delt was the bi-monthly magazine. Butterfield (p. 42) described the coat-of-arms as \\"...sable a sinister bend or, superimposed by a white open book proper on which in turn is superimposed a torch palewise, or, flamed argent. [With a] Crest. An eagle displayed, or\\" (\\"or\\" meaning \\"golden\\", in heraldry). The motto was the sorority's name, which was placed on the banner underneath the shield. Phi Delta suffered from the Great Depression. In 1935, the NYU and GWU chapters affiliated with Beta Phi Alpha; Cincinnati became an Alpha Delta Pi chapter. UCLA struggled for a short time as a local, and ultimately dissolved. Albany remained a local until 1973 (Baird's). = Phi Delta (local) = For the next 40 years, Alpha chapter functioned as a typical social sorority. The chapter had residences at 146 and 278 Western Ave (SUNY Albany archives). The Constitution (1967) gives the purpose of the sorority > as a social and fraternal organization, shall be to uphold the honor Spirit > of the University, to create a friendlier spirit among the girls of the > University, to strengthen the scholastic standing of the University, and to > develop the abilities of the girls for the benefit of the college life. Article IV, Section VII of the Constitution (1967) explained that Phi Delta permitted honorary membership > to those men and women who have shown distinguished ability in the field of > education and leadership, and possess such qualities as Phi Delta stands > for; and men and women who have shown sincere interest and have given > service to Phi Delta, upon election. Section X of the same Article explained faculty membership as > a man or woman of the University faculty who has shown distinguished ability > in the field of education and leadership. During the 1960s, Phi Delta opened membership to African- American and Jewish women (SUNY Albany archives). In 1973, the sorority dissolved.  Pi Sigma Gamma (Œ†Œ£Œì)  Pi Sigma Gamma was founded in 1919 by two University of California at Berkeley students, Alice H. Cassidy and Kathleen D. Coghlan. Baird's (1930) reports the following chapters and membership numbers: *1919 - Alpha - University of California, Berkeley *1921 - Beta - Washington *1926 - Gamma - Hunter College *1928 - Delta - UCLA Total membership was 439. National conventions were held throughout the 1920s. The sorority had several publications: a song book, a Pledge Manual, a Handbook for Pledges. Its magazine was Triple Wing (Baird's 1930, p. 610). Butterfield (p. 45) described the coat-of-arms as \\"A group of emblems within a shield outline, three book, lamp, and crossed swords are employed in the device.\\" The UCLA chapter closed in 1930. The remaining chapters affiliated with Beta Sigma Omicron in 1932. With the merger, Beta Sigma Omicron gained the chapters at Washington and Hunter, while California and possibly UCLA merged with the Beta Sigma Omicron chapters there.  Sigma Sigma Delta (Œ£Œ£Œî)  On November 11, 1924, the society Lanterna Laetitiae was organized at Bucknell University. Four years later, their decision to become a national organization prompted the name change to Sigma Sigma Delta. The sorority had \\"open membership as a fundamental principle\\" (Bucknell University website). Four additional chapters were chartered: Susquehanna, Northwestern, Baldwin-Wallace, Ohio Marietta (Baird's). Northwestern's came from the local Aeukiga and Baldwin-Wallace's from the Calumet Club (Baird's). In Ohio Marietta's catalogue (1933), the sorority is listed as \\"Sigma Sigma Delta National Open Sorority\\" (p. 23) By 1938, all chapters had dissolved or disaffiliated. Northwestern's went to Phi Omega Pi. Baldwin-Wallace's reorganized as local Theta Tau Delta, then affiliated with Phi Mu. The sorority's official colors were green and white. Its flower was the white carnation. Its publication was The Evergreen. (L'Agenda).  Inline citation referencess  *1. Butterfield, Emily H. (1931) College Fraternity Heraldry.

It was first published in 1882 by Chatto and Windus, in a volume entitled Tristram of Lyonesse and Other Poems. Swinburne himself considered Tristram of Lyonesse to be the crowning achievement of his poetic career (quoted by Harrison, p. 96). William Morris (referring to this poem) commented that Swinburne's work 'always seemed to me to be founded on literature, not on nature'.Oxford Companion to English Literature, ed. by M. Drabble, 5th ed. Oxford University Press, 1985; p.999  Contents  The poem consists of 4488 rhyming pentameters and is divided into ten different sections: one 'Prelude' and nine 'Cantos'. It is usually preceded, as in Tristram of Lyonesse and Other Poems by a dedicatory sonnet to Swinburne's friend Theodore Watts- Dunton. Below is a brief summary of the content of the poem's different parts: Prelude The 'Prelude' starts with a hymn to love and then places Iseult among the twelve beautiful women of myth and story, each of whom represents a different month of the year. It ends with Swinburne's apology for adding yet another retelling to the already lengthy literature written on the subject of Tristan and Iseult. I. The Sailing of the Swallow In the poem's first canto the actual story begins, with elaborate descriptions of both Iseult and Tristram sailing to King Mark of Cornwall whom Iseult is to marry. The future lovers discuss various tales of the Matter of Britain and Tristram sings two love-songs to please the innocent Iseult. The canto ends with their drinking of the love-potion and their fateful first kiss. II. The Queen's Pleasance The ship arrives in Cornwall and Iseult marries King Mark. By trickery, however, she spends her first marriage-night with Tristram while her hand-maid Brangwain sleeps with King Mark. Swinburne tells of the lovers' fortunes in Tintagel, which abruptly end when the evil knight Palamides carries Iseult away. After Tristram has chased and killed Palamides, the lovers retreat together to a bower in the woods and are allowed the first full consummation of their love, which Swinburne describes in abundant detail. III. Tristram in Brittany The third canto recounts Tristram's exile in Brittany, and opens with what will be the first in a series of three dramatic monologues. In it, Tristram laments his fate and deplores the Gods in typical Swinburnian fashion. He is awakened from his melancholy musings by nature and the advent of a new spring which erupts all around him. The canto ends with Tristram's meeting with the young Isuelt of the White Hands, whose name beguiles Tristram into marrying her. IV. The Maiden Marriage Yet having married Iseult of the White Hands, Tristram's mind wanders back to his days in Cornwall with Iseult of Ireland, and we learn how by betrayal their adulterous love was finally discovered, upon which King Mark sent Tristram to the top of a cliff to be executed. Tristram, however, managed to escape from his bonds, to dive from a great height down into the ocean and with great hardships to finally reach the shores of Brittany. Thus reminded of his first love, Tristram is unable to consummate his marriage-night with Iseult of the White Hands. V. Iseult at Tintagel That same night Iseult of Ireland sits up alone in her room in King Mark's palace. While outside her window the sea and the night-winds battle it out, she delivers a dramatic monologue full of violent blasphemy and bitter lamentation, at the end of which she ruefully watches the sun rise and breaks down in tears. VI. Joyous Gard To his dismay Ganhardine the brother of Iseult of the White Hands then discovers that his sister, notwithstanding her marriage with Tristram, still remains a virgin. Tristram explains that he cannot forsake his first love and, Ganhardine demanding to see her, the two travel to Tintagel. As it happens, King Mark is out hunting when the men arrive, and Tristram flees with Iseult of Ireland to Camelot, where they finds grace from Launcelot and Guinevere, that other famous adulterous couple. By their grace Tristram and Iseult are allowed to stay at Launcelot's seaside castle Joyous Gard, where they enjoy their second sustained period together, sweetly conversing about their love. VII. The Wife's Vigil At the same time over in Brittany, Iseult of the White Hands grows bitter with the shame of her unconsummated marriage; looking out over the British channel she vows, in the poem's third dramatic monologue, that she will take revenge upon her husband by whatever means fate will give her. VIII. The Last Pilgrimage Also Tristram and Iseult's second brief stay together comes to an end: Tristram is called upon by King Arthur to defeat the Giant Urgan, and Iseult is called back to Tintagel by her husband King Mark. Tristram defeats Urgan and sets sail once more for the coast of Brittany, leaving behind him for the last time the shores of Britain. In Brittany he is immediately met by a knight who is also called Tristram and who implores him to help him free his love from the hands of eight felonious knights. Tristram accepts his plea and the two name-fellows decide to waylay the eight knights besides the sea, where they will pass the following morning. While they lie in waiting, Tristram is roused by the dawn and, throwing off his clothes, he meets the ocean for a last glorious swim. He then defeats the evil knights but is wounded fatally in the event, and only with great difficulty does he manage to reach the castle where his wedded wife, Iseult of the White Hands, awaits him. IX. The Sailing of the Swan The poem's last canto begins with a long hymn to fate, and tells of the final fortunes of Tristram and Iseult. The former is so sore wounded that only Iseult of Ireland's healing skills can now give him any help. Ganhardine decides to set sail for Tintagel to bring Iseult of Ireland to the wounded Tristram, and they agree that Ganhardine will hoist a white sail if he returns with Iseult on board, and a black one if he returns alone. In the end he does return to Brittany with Iseult and a white sail, but Iseult of the White Hands takes her final revenge and tells Tristram that the returning sail is black instead, upon which he dies immediately. When Iseult arrives and sees her lover newly dead, she bends over him, kisses him one last time, and dies from grief. The lovers are then buried by King Mark, who finally discovers the cause of their love and pardons them. Their grave in turn is swallowed by the ocean where they find their final rest.

Another Indiana startup, Bright Automotive, was forced to end operations the week before after applying for the same loan in 2008 and being unable to continue waiting for the DOE to act on the application. On March 13, 2012, Secretary Chu testified before a Senate hearing partly related to claims made by Carbon Motors CEO William Santana Li regarding the politicization of loans granted by the DOE stating \\"Politics is not a factor, period. It has to do with the finances of the company, the viability of the loan.\\" In early March 2013, Carbon Motors began to remove equipment and vacate the plant in Connersville. The lease on the plant was allowed to expire on March 31, 2013. The company's website and YouTube channel were taken down around the same time. By April 2013, the company effectively shut down. On May 22, 2013, three former Carbon Motors executives filed a lawsuit against the company for unpaid, deferred wages.  The E7  Carbon Motors was formed to develop and produce the E7, the first purpose-built police car ever made. The E7 was to be only available for law enforcement agencies to purchase. The prototype was first revealed in 2008 on the \\"Pure Justice\\" tour. The E7 had an expected release date of 2012. It was designed in part by American law enforcement officers for the sole purpose of producing a vehicle to be most effective to police.FAQ The company stated that, in order to keep the vehicle out of private ownership, when an agency wishes to dispose of an E7, it would either be sold to another law enforcement agency or returned to the factory to be parted out. The price was intended to be \\"competitive\\" considering the cost of equipping a conventional car for police work and how long each vehicle lasts. The Carbon E7 was to be built to last 250,000 miles, compared with 75,000 to 120,000 miles for the typical patrol car. = Specifications = The vehicle was to be equipped with a BMW straight-six turbo-diesel engine, which is more fuel efficient than current gasoline engine police car engines. It was designed to be rear wheel drive, have a six-speed automatic transmission, be governed to a top speed of 155 mph, and accelerate from 0-60 mph in 6.5 seconds. It also featured numerous safety features, including 75 mph rear- impact crash capability, and optional ballistic protection panels. The vehicle also had law enforcement equipment designed into the vehicle intended to be installed during production so agencies wouldn't need to purchase equipment from other companies and then install them on the vehicle.Specifications The front seats of the E7 were designed for comfort while wearing a duty belt.‚ÄúThe Machine‚Äù to Clean Up Crime in 2012 = Equipment = According to Carbon Motors Corporation, the E7 was to have numerous features and options available, including:Specifications-Selected Features and Options * NIJ Level III-A (or better) ballistic protection (front doors and dash panel) * Purpose- designed seat for use with on-body equipment and seat heating and ventilation * Head-up display * Reverse backup camera * Remote start capability * Engine features to enable extended idling as well as operating in extreme conditions (heat and cold) * Driver-specific intelligent key * 360 degree exterior surveillance capability, with fully automatic recording * Automatic license plate recognition system, programmable and upgradeable * Video and audio surveillance of rear passenger compartment * Nightvision compliant interior illumination * Integrated forward looking infrared system (FLIR) * Integrated shotgun and rifle mounts * Secure weapons storage * Optimized storage capability (compartment and cargo), to store police gear ranging from spare restraints to forensic equipment * Integrated front and rear passenger compartment partition * Isolated ventilation for front and rear compartments * Rear seats designed to accommodate handcuffed suspects/prisoners * Security features to prevent escape of prisoners * Rear passenger compartment designed to be washed by hosing down * Integrated push bumpers and PIT capability * Integrated aerodynamic emergency lights with sirens = In popular culture = The Carbon E7 is featured in the 2010 video game Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit as one of the vehicles available for use when playing as a police officer. While all other playable vehicles (such as the Ford Crown Victoria, Chevrolet Caprice, Dodge Charger, and other well-known vehicles) have performance statistics such as top speed listed, most of the E7's statistics are listed as \\"CLASSIFIED\\". However, the vehicle was removed from the remastered version of the game released in 2020 due to Carbon being defunct and the car never entering production.Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered is missing some classic cars See also * Police car * Police officer * Peace officer References https://web.archive.org/web/20100529055709/http://www.carbonmotors.com/news- releases/list/2 External links * Carbon Motors homepage * \\"Cops help dream up high-tech police car,\\" CNN article on Carbon E7 *Article at Autonews.it *Article at Autoblog.it *2010 Design News article Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 2003 Vehicle manufacturing companies disestablished in 2013 Police vehicles Defunct motor vehicle manufacturers of the United States ","title":"Carbon Motors Corporation"},{"id":"20644659","text":"right Rino Piccolo (born 14 February)Ludovico and Teresa is an international film producer, and film commissioner.

Berkshire Country Day (BCD) is an independent school for pre-schoolers through eighth grade. It is located at 55 Interlaken Road/Route 183 in Berkshire County, Massachusetts near the town of Lenox.http://www.berkshirecountryday.org www.berkshirecountryday.org History BCD was founded in 1946 by a group of local parents who wanted to give their children a certain style of education which they felt was not available in the area. It began with 12 students in one building on the campus of the Lenox School for Boys, an Episcopal all-boys boarding school. History of BCD Initially, the school covered only grades 1-6 and tuition ranged from only $150 to $310, depending on the grade. In 1957, the school expanded to include a seventh and eighth grade and kindergarten and preschool, and moved into two new buildings. The school's main building, housing the pre-k through sixth grade, was moved to the Starks' former family home on Walker Street in Lenox. The seventh and eighth grade, on the other hand, were housed in Bassett Hall, a building close by, which is now Kemble Inn. BCD's enrollment soared from 58 students in 1958 to 183 in 1963. Brook Farm, circa 1891 Then, in 1963, the school purchased its current campus, the Brook Farm Campus. Initially, the campus was only used by the younger students for classes, while the older students continued using the Walker Street Building, frequenting the new campus for sports and co-curricular activities. This arrangement lasted for only a year, as the Walker Street building was destroyed in a fire. In the academic year 1967-68, the school expanded to include ninth grade. In 2000, the school opened Berkshire Country Day Secondary School (BCD2s), a high school division of the school consisting of grades 9-12. BCD's ninth grade was separated from BCD and became a part of BCD2s. The high school was located on Winthrop Campus, the summer home of the Boston University Tanglewood Institute, which the school rented from Boston University during the academic year. However, in June 2007 at the end of the academic year, BCD2s was closed, although the ninth grade class option was kept and added back to the BCD student body. Currently, the school resides at its Brook Farm campus, serving students from 2-years-old through eighth grade. BCD is still permitted by Boston University to use the West St. Theater for its upper school theater productions, talent show, and film festival. The 27 acre natural campus includes several regulation playing fields, a pond used for kayaking and ice skating and new wings have been added to the original historic buildings. =Brook Farm Campus= Kayaking on Barrett Pond Berkshire Country Day School is located at the Brook Farm campus near Lenox, Massachusetts. The campus grounds date back to the 1890s and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as it was once a working farm for the Anson Phelps Stokes' Shadowbrook estate. Mr. Stokes built the 1,000 acre estate, complete with a mansion that encompassed 100 rooms and stretched 410 feet, as a \\"summer cottage\\" in 1892‚Äì1896. After ten years (in 1906) the family sold the estate to Mr. Spencer Shotter. It was then leased to Mrs. Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt in 1916 and 1917 before being sold to Mr. Andrew Carnegie. Mr. Carnegie inhabited the estate until 1919 when he passed. The New England Province of the Society of Jesus purchased the estate in 1922 and used it as their seminary. Unfortunately, in 1956 the entire Shadowbook mansion burned to the ground in a tragic fire. The Society rebuilt a new brick building on the site of the previous mansion and maintained it for their society until 1970. The estate laid vacant until 1983, when the Kripalu Center purchased the mansion's section of the property. Meanwhile, the farm section of the estate had been passed down through the family to Stokes' son, Anson Phelps Stokes, Jr., who lived there with his family. The old Shadowbrook farm is now the current campus of BCD. It consists of the original farm buildings, as well as new additions recently built. The fields that were once farmed and used for animal pasture are now sports fields and playgrounds, and much of the woodland is traced with hiking trails. Also, in 1972, a house for the head of school was built at the rear of the property. Art The many different arts courses offered to the classes at BCD include both visual and performing arts, ceramics, painting & drawing, mixed media, sculpture, jewelry design, woodcraft, vocal ensemble, digital music composition, and guitar ensemble. Students from preschool through Grade 8 participate in art, music, and chorus classes throughout the year. Students also partake in shop class, and have the option of participating in band or chorus. Division structure The school is sectioned into four divisions: Admissions Process *Early Childhood Early Childhood includes Beginner 2 year olds and up to Pre-Kindergarten. The school embraces the Reggio Emilio format of inviting and sustaining ongoing learning. Early Literacy skills are developed through imaginative play and daily exposure to books. Math concepts are investigated through hands on use of materials such as manipulatives, puzzles and blocks. Students begin to learn about the science process by engaging in their physical world and in focused activities such as caring for animals and following the weather. *Lower School The Lower School includes Kindergarten and grades 1, 2, and 3 and is carefully structured to support every child's individual journey, stimulating their minds and supporting their natural strengths. The focus of the Lower School is supporting and promoting each student's academic development as well as their social and emotional growth. Hands-on science labs provide opportunities to learn by doing. *Middle School Middle School, consisting of Grades 4,5,and 6, is where students study the academic classes as well as arts, foreign language, and technology. In these years the students adeptly move from the concrete to the abstract. They become independent learners, and motivated individuals and community members. *Upper School Upper School consists of 7th and 8th graders who demonstrate increasing levels of achievement in academics, the arts and athletics. Students are stewarded by a team of two teachers who serve as advisors and homeroom teachers guiding the social-emotional curriculum during these crucial adolescent years. Extracurriculars Activities Berkshire Country Day School offers varied and excellent extra- curricular opportunities - Band, Ceramics, Chorus, Creative Writing, Drama, Newspaper, Photography, Yearbook, Competitive Sports including Soccer, Lacrosse, Gymnastics & more.

Improved fretting fatigue and stress corrosion performance has been documented, even at elevated temperatures where the compression from other metal improvement processes relax. The resulting deep layer of compressive residual stress has also been shown to improve high cycle fatigue (HCF) and low cycle fatigue (LCF) performance.  History  Unlike LPB, traditional burnishing tools consist of a hard wheel or fixed lubricated ball pressed into the surface of an asymmetrical work piece with sufficient force to deform the surface layers, usually in a lathe. The process does multiple passes over the work pieces, usually under increasing load, to improve surface finish and deliberately cold work the surface. Roller and ball burnishing have been studied in Russia and Japan, and were applied most extensively in the USSR in the 1970s. Various burnishing methods are used, particularly in Eastern Europe, to improve fatigue life. Improvements in HCF, corrosion fatigue and SCC are documented, with fatigue strength enhancement attributed to improved finish, the development of a compressive surface layer, and the increased yield strength of the cold worked surface. LPB was developed and patented by Lambda Technologies in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1996. Since then, LPB has been developed to produce compression in a wide array of materials to mitigate surface damage, including fretting, corrosion pitting, stress corrosion cracking (SCC), and foreign object damage (FOD), and is being employed to aid in daily MRO operations. To this day, LPB is the only metal improvement method applied under continuous closed-loop process control and has been successfully applied to turbine engines, piston engines, propellers, aging aircraft structures, landing gear, nuclear waste material containers, biomedical implants, armaments, fitness equipment and welded joints. The applications involved titanium, iron, nickel and steel-based components and showed improved damage tolerance as well as high and low cycle fatigue performance by an order of magnitude.  How it works  The basic LPB tool is a ball, wheel or other similar tip that is supported in a spherical hydrostatic bearing. The tool can be held in any CNC machine or by industrial robots, depending on the application. The machine tool coolant is used to pressurize the bearing with a continuous flow of fluid to support the ball. The ball does not contact the mechanical bearing seat, even under load. The ball is loaded at a normal state to the surface of a component with a hydraulic cylinder that is in the body of the tool. LPB can be performed in conjunction with chip forming machining operations in the same CNC machining tool. The ball rolls across the surface of a component in a pattern defined in the CNC code, as in any machining operation. The tool path and normal pressure applied are designed to create a distribution of compressive residual stress. The form of the distribution is designed to counter applied stresses and optimize fatigue and stress corrosion performance. Since there is no shear being applied to the ball, it is free to roll in any direction. As the ball rolls over the component, the pressure from the ball causes plastic deformation to occur in the surface of the material under the ball. Since the bulk of the material constrains the deformed area, the deformed zone is left in compression after the ball passes.  Benefits  The LPB process includes a unique and patented way of analyzing, designing, and testing metallic components in order to develop the unique metal treatment necessary to improve performance and reduce metal fatigue, SCC, and corrosion fatigue failures. Lambda modifies the process and tooling for each component to provide the best results possible and to ensure that the apparatus reaches every inch on the component. With this practice of customization along with the closed-loop process control system, LPB has been shown to produce a maximum compression of 12mm, although the average is around 1-7+mm. LPB has even been shown to have the ability to produce through-thickness compression in blades and vanes, greatly increasing their damage tolerance over 10-fold, effectively mitigating most FOD and reducing inspection requirements. No material is removed during this process, even when correcting corrosion damage. LPB smooths surface asperities during machining, leaving an improved, almost mirror-like surface finish that is vastly better looking and better protected than even a newly manufactured component.  Cold working  The cold work produced from this process is typically minimal, similar to the cold work produced by laser peening, only a few percent,http://www.lambdatechs.com/laser-shock-peening.html but a great deal less than shot peening, gravity peening or, deep rolling. Cold work is particularly important because the higher the cold work at the surface of a component, the more vulnerable to elevated temperatures and mechanical overload that component will be and the easier the beneficial surface residual compression will relax, rendering the treatment pointless. In other words, a component that has been highly cold worked will not hold the compression if it comes into contact with extreme heat, like an engine, and will be just as vulnerable as it was to start. Therefore, LPB and laser peening stand out in the surface enhancement industry because they are both thermally stable at high temperatures. The reason LPB produces such low percentages of cold work is because of the aforementioned closed-loop process control. Conventional shot peening processes have some guesswork involved and are not exact at all, causing the procedure to have to be performed multiple times on one component. For example, shot peening, in order to make sure every spot on the component is treated, typically specifies coverage of between 200% (2T) and 400% (4T). This means that at 200% coverage (2T), 5 or more impacts occur at 84% of locations and at 400% coverage (4T), it is significantly more. The problem is that one area will be hit several times while the area next to it is hit fewer times, leaving uneven compression at the surface. This uneven compression results in the whole process being easily \\"undone\\", as was mentioned above. LPB requires only one pass with the tool and leaves a deep, even, beneficial compressive stress. The LPB process can be performed on-site in the shop or in situ on aircraft using robots, making it easy to incorporate into everyday maintenance and manufacturing procedures. The method is applied under continuous closed loop process control (CLPC), creating accuracy within 0.1% and alerting the operator and QA immediately if the processing bounds are exceeded. The limitation of this process is that different CNC processing codes need to be developed for each application, just like any other machining task. The other issue is that because of dimensional restrictions, it may not be possible to create the tools necessary to work on certain geometries, although that has yet to be a problem.

They were written and directed by series creator Joss Whedon. \\"Part 1\\" first aired on May 18, 1999 and \\"Part 2\\" first aired on July 13, 1999. The second part was to originally be aired on May 25, 1999, but was postponed due to the episode's content and the occurrence of the Columbine High School shootings one month prior. The episodes are the last to feature David Boreanaz as a series regular due to his starring in the spin-off series Angel. Fellow series regular Charisma Carpenter (Cordelia), who had been with the show since its first episode, also left the series to star alongside Boreanaz. Plot =Part 1= The episode opens with the gang preparing for their graduation: Cordelia and Xander discuss the color of their gowns, and Willow speaks to Buffy about all she'll miss about high school. Buffy is considering skipping graduation to fight Mayor Wilkins, until Xander joins them and informs the two that the Mayor's to be the commencement speaker at graduation. Faith visits college professor Lester Worth on behalf of the Mayor, and kills him. She reports the kill to the Mayor, who has Faith change into a dress and tells her the ascension is her day as well as his. In class, Anya speaks to Xander and, when he mentions the ascension, her expression becomes grave. In the library, Buffy shows Giles and Wesley the newspaper which details the murder of Worth. Buffy suspects Faith to be the culprit and the three agree the professor must have known something the Mayor wanted kept secret. Xander and Anya arrive, Anya having experienced a previous ascension. She tells them about a sorcerer who became the pure-demon Lohesh - unlike human-demon hybrids like vampires, pure-demons are much stronger and much larger. The Mayor waltzes into the library and smugly comments that he'll eat Buffy come graduation day. Upon hearing this Giles, in a fit of rage, stabs him with a sword; but the Mayor is unharmed, and merely scolds Giles for his impetuous violence ‚Äì a bad example in the presence of children. He leaves with the cheery promise that some of their deaths will be quick. At home, Buffy packs a suitcase for Joyce and convinces her to leave town for safety. Willow vents her worries to Oz, and chides him for his detachment; panic would be a more normal human response. Oz interrupts her with a passionate kiss, and when Willow asks what he's doing, he replies that he is \\"panicking\\". The two finally consummate their relationship. Buffy and Angel discuss Worth's work, which Buffy doesn't understand. The two discuss the confusing nature of their relationship, when Angel is struck in the back by an arrow fired by Faith, which misses his heart. At the library, the arrow is removed, and Giles and Wesley go over Mr. Worth's files, which indicate that Worth found a gigantic carcass underneath the rubble of a volcanic eruption, which he believed may have been a new type of dinosaur. The group assumes this must be some sort of demon, when Angel falls to the ground - the arrow has been poisoned with a toxin fatal to vampires. Faith reports her attack to the Mayor, and amuses him with a few stories from her childhood before he continues preparations for the ascension. Wesley tells Buffy the Watcher's Council refuses to help Angel because he is a vampire, but Willow's research reveals the poison has a cure - the blood of a Slayer. Buffy arrives at Faith's apartment intent on getting her blood. Faith warns Buffy that she'll never take her alive and a battle to the death ensues, eventually ending up on the roof. Meanwhile, Giles and Xander find that the Mayor will transform into the demon Olvikan, and find an unseen picture of him in a book - the illustration is four pages long. The Mayor is also alerted to the trouble at Faith's place. On the edge of the roof, Buffy stabs Faith with the knife Faith had received as a birthday gift from the Mayor. Faith congratulates Buffy for killing her, punches her to the ground with a brutal back hand, then leaps off the roof onto a truck on the street below to escape, denying Buffy her blood. The fall knocks her out, and Buffy watches as the truck carries her away. =Part 2= Buffy and Angel looking at each other before parting Giles informs Cordelia that Buffy has quit the council and no longer requires a watcher. Buffy tells Angel that his only cure is the blood of a slayer and since he can not use Faith, he will have to use hers. Angel begs her to not make him drink, but succumbs after physical violence from Buffy, incapacitating her in the process. A fully healed Angel carries her to the hospital for treatment, meanwhile in a nearby room Mayor Wilkins is standing over Faith, beaten and comatose, being informed by the Doctor that she may never wake up. The Mayor attempts to suffocate Buffy, but he is stopped by Angel and leaves. In a dream, Faith tells Buffy that \\"human weakness never goes away, even his\\". When Buffy wakes she approaches her friends, ready to go to war with the Mayor. In the library, Buffy finishes detailing a plan and the gang agree the plan is crazy, but is their only option. Angel remembers that the Mayor was seriously grieving over Faith. The Mayor and Buffy detail their respective plans to their allies, and Buffy's friends recruit other students to help. Wesley tells Cordelia that he will be returning to England following the ascension; they kiss. Buffy and Angel talk over weapons, and Angel tells Buffy he will be saying goodbye after the battle. A grief-stricken Buffy unwraps the knife she used to stab Faith, still stained with her blood. The graduation ceremony begins and Principal Snyder welcomes the students before the Mayor takes the podium. During his speech he starts to convulse, an eclipse turns the sky into night, and the Mayor transforms into Olvikan, a giant snake-like demon. At Buffy's command, the entire student body removes their robes to reveal weapons and crosses. They attack Olvikan with flame throwers and arrows. The mayor‚Äôs vampires surface but Xander has a group fire flaming arrows at them, slaying many. They flee but run into Angel, Wesley and the sports jocks, who go hand to hand with them. Xander leads the students in an attack from the rear. One vampire feeds on Harmony. Olvikan strikes Larry and kills him, then devours the protesting Snyder. Buffy catches Olvikan's attention with Faith's knife, describing in graphic detail how she stabbed her. The demon chases Buffy through the school to the library, which has been filled with explosives. Buffy dives out a window and Giles detonates the explosives, blowing up the school and killing Olvikan. Giles presents Buffy with her diploma, rescued from the debris. Buffy then sees Angel and they share a final, longing look at each other before Angel leaves. The gang, minus Giles, gathers and Oz tells them all to take a moment to deal with what happened, that they all survived. Buffy agrees that it was a great battle, but Oz corrects her by saying it was high school they survived. The scene fades on a charred yearbook for Sunnydale Class of 1999. Reception Reviews for the BBC said Part 1 lacked energy and the build-up to the Buffy-Faith confrontation was slow. It praised the humor and menace displayed in the library scenes. Part 2 was described as suitably epic for a season finale, preparing the ground for the Angel spin-off series and building to a fast-paced and large-scale climax. The final performances of Armin Shimerman as Principal Snyder, and Harry Groener as the Mayor, and throughout the season, were noted. Noel Murray of The A.V. Club said \\"Graduation Day\\" was a \\"wonderfully calibrated mix of life-lessons, dramatic moments, thrilling heroics and well-observed character interactions\\". He complimented the performance of Harry Groener. Controversy During the time of its airing, the episode caused a great deal of controversy in the media. The Columbine High School massacre, which took place only four weeks before the airing of Part One, was widely blamed on violence in entertainment. The WB Television Network had already pulled the plug on an earlier episode, \\"Earshot\\" (which itself was not aired until September), and feared that several scenes in \\"Graduation Day, Part Two\\" would provoke high school students to do the same thing, especially those depicting the entire graduating class handling weapons against the Mayor. On May 25, 1999, only two hours before \\"Graduation Day, Part Two\\" was due to air, The WB suddenly decided to replace it with a re-run from earlier in the season, \\"Band Candy\\". This sudden move received huge attention in the media and thousands of letters were sent to the network demanding that the season finale be shown. Sarah Michelle Gellar publicly spoke out against the decision, Seth Green agreed that the episode should have been broadcast in its original slot. The WB did not air the episode until July 13, 1999, almost two months after it was originally scheduled; since nearly all US schools end their term in May or June, it was then felt safe. The episode attracted 6.5 million viewers, which is typically high for the WB during summer, and comparable to what the other episodes of the season had received. As the episode was not delayed in Canada, many bootleg digital downloads were available. Joss Whedon, the creator of the show, stated, \\"Bootleg the puppy.\\" References External links Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 3) episodes 1999 American television episodes Television programs

Founded in 1899 \\"to regenerate the Drama\\", it followed the Independent Theatre Society in this activity. Its plays particularly included the first performances of plays that had been banned for public performance by the Lord Chamberlain. George Bernard Shaw, Harley Granville Barker, St. John Hankin, Gilbert Murray and Clifford Bax were all involved with the company. Its council decided in 1930 that the rise of other groups like the Gate Theatre meant the Society's work was complete and, though a 1930 proposal for its dissolution was defeated, it fell into abeyance on the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. Its aims were continued post- war by the English Stage Company, the resident company at the Royal Court Theatre.

1985.Page at Internet Speculative Fiction Database. It is included in the anthology American Gothic Tales edited by Joyce Carol Oates'. American Gothic Tales: Edited with Introduction by Joyce Carol Oates, New York: Plume, 1996  Plot summary  The story features a poet who seems to be growing mad and nearing insanity. He has lost his inspiration for poetry until, that is, he discovers the hothouse. He talks of a naked girl and a drunken nurseryman who both haunt his mind. He wonders how a person who tends to green plants and spend his days in a room full of life be such a drunk. Plants are peaceful and not intended to be cared for by people so dark and clumsy. The nurseryman haunts the madman. The man wants nothing more than to enter into the hothouse and be safe from the cold. Not only is the hothouse bounded by ice, with no way to get in, but the mans heart has also grown cold with no way to fill in the hole in his chest. All the man wants is to feel wanted. For days the nurseryman would not let him in. From outside the man can see wonderful colors filling up the hothouse. Contrary to the outside, all frozen and cold and colorless. The man tries to get the nurseryman to let him in but he never does. The man becomes very enraged and feels very unwanted. suddenly, he sees a figure fall from the top of the biology lab that rose above the hothouse. The figure smashed right through the frozen glass of the hothouse. The pressure from the smash magically opened the door, so naturally the man waiting outside walked in. The man walked over the figure and saw a naked girl. She had long black hair and just a bit of blood coming from the corner of her mouth. The man wondered why she had jumped, if she have been pushed, and why was she naked. Next thing he knew the nurseryman latched onto her and began rolling and tumbling over the naked girl. Then both of the bodies lay there almost as one and seemingly dead. The madman sits next to them and takes out the nurseryman's heart. Then the bodies are taken out and the madman returns to wherever he came from.

Called ‚Äúavuncular and beloved‚Äù by some, he was known for his modernizing approach to teaching at Al-Azhar University, preaching moderation and embracing modern science as a religious duty. Early life Abdel-Halim Mahmoud was born on 12 May 1910 in the village of Abou Ahmed (now Al Salam), in the Sharqia Governorate, 50 kilometers north east of Cairo, Egypt. He memorized the Qur'an at an early age and then started his studies at Al-Azhar University where he graduated in 1932. He then continued his studies in France, where he obtained a Doctorate degree in Philosophy from the Universite de Paris - La Sorbonne in 1940. Views According to scholars Moshe Albo and Yoram Meital, themes that reoccurred in Mahmoud's writing were: > the importance of knowledge and education; the superiority of Islamic morals > and ethics; the uniqueness of Muslim history; the integration of Islamic > spirituality and jurisprudence; the ultimate negation of the Other (e.g., > the Western, Zionist, communist, secular, and heretic); the ascendance of > Islamic theology and law; and the need to reform Egyptian politics and > society in accordance with the pillars of Islam. =Islamic law= Mahmoud was a consistent supporter of the replacement of Egypt's civil law code with Sharia. He argued that the Hudud (those sharia punishments which are mandated and fixed) punishment of amputation of a thief's hand was ordained by God and when implemented by Ibn Saud had brought law and order to Saudi Arabia‚Äîeven though it only had to be carried out seven times. On the other hand, Mahmoud issued a shariah fatwa supporting a minimum marrying age of sixteen for girls, despite the fact he acknowledged Shariah tradition did not specify any exact age. He argued \\"developed societies have set the age of marriage at sixteen, and this is appropriate\\".\`Abd al-Halim Madmud, Fatawa, 2:132, 434 =Science= For Mahmoud, \\"any reform -- whether on the personal level or on the level of society -- begins with science, be that science religious or material..... Whether we begin the path of reform from the vantage point of theoretical science or from that of material or empirical science, our endeavours must be imbued with a purpose. This purpose is an Islamic obligation, as science must be the basis for the path towards God. Indeed, knowledge is a form of worship and a form of jihad.\\" During his tenure as Grand Imam, Al-Azhar witnessed unprecedented reform and revival, including the introduction of new faculties, teaching methods and management style. =Sufism= Abdel-Halim Mahmoud is also remembered for reviving Sufism through his prolific writings and lectures on the matter. He was greatly influenced by the sudanes Sufi Sheikh Mohammed Osman abdu Al-Burhany whom his knowledge helped him reform his ideologies and concepts in Sufism \\"Abd al- Halim Mahmud (1910-1978) is remembered as the former rector of al-Azhar who wrote a great deal on Sufism. He is referred to by his honorific title, 'al- Ghazali, in 14th Century A.H.'2 , a title he was given because of his unique ability to integrate the exoteric and esoteric dimensions of Islam (which are often considered contradictory at first glance). He became influential in 1960-1970s, the Sadat period in which Islamic revivalism began its rise to prominence in Egypt.\\" \\"Abd al-Halim presents tasawwuf as a scientific method that would enable people to comprehend the ultimate reality. The essence of tasawwuf is defined as knowledge (ma\`rifa) of the metaphysical domain. Metaphysics is the science of explaining the hidden aspects of God and clarifying his prophecies. He emphasised its distinction of 'mysticism'-he proposed that tasawwuf is not a mere superstitious method, but a field of science (Mahmud Al-Munqidh: 224-233). \`Abd al-Halim cites \`Abbas Mahmud al-\`Aqqad (d. 1964) in saying that ma\`rifa is an intellectual realm which neither physical science, cognition (fikr), nor various types of mental perception (basira etc.) have access to. Tasawwuf is the only science that can enter this realm, because although other sciences are bound to human capacity, tasawwuf is not (cited from ibid. 352-353).\\" \\"Abd al-Halim's Sufism consists of three elements-\`ilm, jihad, and \`ubudiya. First was \`ilm, the knowledge of Islamic Law. He emphasizes the significance of living according to shari\`a, and stipulates that Islamic Law is to be understood and practiced accordingly. Moreover, he cites Abu Hamid al-Ghazali's work, which declares that God will bless those who acted according to their knowledge of Law-no matter how ignorant they might be-but would punish those who ignored the law irrespective of their knowledge4. Second is jihad, the effort to situate oneself within social reality and to solve the problems one faces. \`Abd al-Halim's ideal image of Sufi is not exemplified through the concept of 'mystic' (those who live in seclusion, practicing asceticism). He states rather that Sufi must be committed to solving the problems of the time, and gives the example of \`Abd al-Qadir al-Jazai'rli (d.1883), who fought for the defence of Algeria against France (ibid. 15-16). Third is \`ubudiya, servitude to God: being correct and devoted. When \`ubudiya is attained, ma\`rifa is granted, and God showers the believer with Mercy (ibid. 12)\\".Paper originally prepared by Hatsuki Aishima for an international conference \\"Sufism, Culture, Music\\" held from 12 to 15 November 2005 in Tlemcen, Algeria Sources * Manhaj al-islah al-islami fi- al-mujtam' (The Method of Islamic Reform in Society), Abdel-Halim Mahmoud, Cairo: General Egyptian Book Organisation (GEBO), 2005. * \\"The Grand Imams of Al-Azhar (Shuyukhul Azhar)\\" at www.sunnah.org.

History  Crypt and sarcophagi Capital of the crypt Charlotte of Bourbon The Merovingian foundation of Abbess Theodochilde or Telchilde, was founded traditionally in 630, inspired by the visit of St. Columban, the travelling Irish monk who inspired monastic institution-building in the early seventh century. As part of its Celtic heritage, Jouarre was established as a \\"double community,\\" i.e., a community of monks as well as nuns, both under the rule of the abbess, who in 1225 was granted immunity from interference by the bishop of Meaux, answering only to the pope. The Merovingian (pre-Romanesque) crypt beneath the Romanesque abbey church contains a number of burials in sarcophagi, notably that of Theodochilde's brother, Agilbert (died 680), carved with a tableau of the Last Judgment and Christ in Majesty, highlights of pre-Romanesque sculpture. In the mid-ninth century the abbey acquired relics of St. Potentian; the relics assembled at Jouarre attracted pilgrims. The reputation of the house stood so high the abbey received a visit from Pope Innocent II in 1131 and was able to house a synod in 1133. The abbess's submission to the bishop of Meaux did not come about until Bossuet held the post in 1690.Bossuet vs. Jouarre's Women The abbey is an important pilgrimage center. A fortified town was built around it and gave birth to the present city of Jouarre. At the time of the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre (1572), the abbess Charlotte of Bourbon (1547‚Äì1582) converted to Protestantism and escaped from the abbey in a cart of hay, and fled to Germany. She married William I of Orange-Nassau. The present monastery buildings, once again occupied by Benedictine nuns, date from the eighteenth century; their traditional vegetable and fruit garden (potager) are notable.

Founded in 1984 by Eric Francis Coppolino, it is a fortnightly magazine with wide-ranging news, arts, literary and sports features concerning both campus and community events and issues. Before September 2009, Generation Magazine was a weekly magazine predominantly featuring news, multimedia review, and literary articles. Beginning in its first year, Generation received numerous awards in the Columbia Scholastic Journalism Competition. The publication maintains a history of producing eleven issues per academic semester which are distributed throughout the greater Buffalo area as well as across campus. All staff members are currently undergraduate students, contributing to its self-proclaimed title as \\"The Student Voice Since 1984.\\" However, the magazine traces its lineage back to the 1960s, and is the longest surviving and most successful in a series of student magazines on the campus. Generation's immediate predecessor was The Current, which lost its funding and offices after illegally attempting to impeach Coppolino, then its managing editor, for publishing a satire on a conservative campus publication. Generation has strict freedom of speech accommodations in its charter, which was written by Coppolino in the aftermath of The Current incident. Generation's content is uncensored, often featuring crude language and humor in editorials and columns. In the past, its content included investigative features, news content, and feature stories. The magazine has always had an activist or advocacy journalism slant. Generation's fortnightly press run is 5,000 copies per issues over the 14 issue volume. It advertises itself as one of the largest student-run magazine on the East Coast of the United States. Before September 2009, the Generation printed 8,000 copies per issue over 22 issues. The publication has been involved in creating many auxiliary projects, including Reach, the campus student handbook for many years. It is published by [Sub-Board I, Inc.], the not-for-profit student services corporation at the university. Sub Board provides some funding and a business structure for the magazine.  Generation on hiatus  At the end of the fall semester in 2008, Sub Board I, Inc. decided to pull Generation's charter. Sub Board then elected a new editor in chief. Generation went through several name changes over the summer but was eventually renamed Generation shortly before the fall semester began. Under the new editor in chief, the publication took on some drastic changes, including: making it into a biweekly publication, colorizing every page and making them glossy and removing the popular \\"I'm Right, You're Wrong\\" section and personals. Sub-Board I, Inc. voted to suspend Generation for the rest of the fall semester on the day the first issue was released.http://ubspectrum.com/article/60  Post-hiatus  Generation did return from hiatus and was published between January 2010 and April 2014.

They are also the 101st and 102nd episodes of the show overall. The two constituent episodes were both aired on October 2, 2001 on UPN. The episodes were written by Marti Noxon and David Fury and directed by David Grossman. The Scooby Gang resurrect Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar), after her death in the previous episode. Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) returns to England, and a group of biker demons wreak havoc on Sunnydale.  Plot  =Part 1= With Buffy having been dead for five months, the Scooby Gang continue to patrol, led by Willow, whose power is progressing steadily. They use the often-imperfect Buffybot to conceal Buffy's death from any lurking enemies, as well as from social workers who believe Buffy to be Dawn's guardian. Meanwhile, at the magic shop, Giles is packing up his items in preparation for his return to England. Willow announces plans to resurrect Buffy by magic with Anya having found the last mystical artifact Willow needs on eBay. She conceals her intentions, however, from Giles, Spike and Dawn. A vampire survives his encounter with the Buffybot and realizes the real Slayer is gone. He tells a demon biker gang, which sets out to attack Sunnydale. Willow slaughters a baby deer in preparation for her ritual of resurrection. Giles leaves for England. Willow, Xander, Anya, and Tara gather at Buffy's grave and Willow begins the ritual. As it progresses, the demon bikers wreak havoc in the town and damage the Buffybot when it intervenes. They trail the Buffybot as it tries to find Willow, interrupting the ritual at its conclusion. After the bikers destroy an essential artifact of the resurrection spell, the Scooby gang members flee in multiple directions from the attacking demons, convinced the ritual has failed. Unbeknownst to them, Buffy has been resurrected and has awakened, still buried in her coffin. =Part 2= Xander carries Willow to the magic shop where Tara and Anya are to meet them. The demon bikers batter the Buffybot. The resurrected Buffy breaks out of her coffin and claws her way to the surface, confused and traumatized. Spike steals a motorcycle from a demon and rides off with Dawn, intent on escaping the demons still rampaging through Sunnydale. The disoriented Buffy roams through the town, coming upon demon bikers - Hellions - as they complete the destruction of the Buffybot. As she flees them, she stumbles across Willow and her allies, but runs from them as well. As they pursue her, they are attacked by the demons, but Buffy turns and defeats them then runs again. The biker leader wakes and attacks Xander and the others. Willow uses magic against him and when he turns to attack Willow it is Tara who kills him with an axe. Spike and Dawn find the head of the destroyed Buffybot. As Spike investigates it, the head suggests to Dawn the real Buffy has returned; distraught, she runs away. Still in shock, Buffy returns alone to the site of her death, the top of Glory's tower. Dawn finds her there and climbs the unstable structure in pursuit. Buffy prepares to restage her death, but Dawn interrupts and tries to convince her to come down. Still confused, Buffy asks if she's in hell. As the tower collapses, Buffy's instinct to protect Dawn takes control, and she carries her sister down a rope to the ground.

D√ºsseldorf: Droste, 1997, pp. 97‚Äì8. DSAP‚ÄìLinke was led by Heinrich Scheibler, who had been the chairman of the Lodz-Nord party branch of DSAP and who in 1930 had become member of the DSAP Party Council. Schlieber had advocated that DSAP should seek cooperation with other leftwing parties, for unity between socialists and communists in struggle against reaction. Other founding members of DSAP‚ÄìLinke were Johann R√ºckert, Oskar Fiebig, Adolf Jedich, and Joseph Dillner.Blachetta-Madajczyk, Petra. Klassenkampf oder Nation?: deutsche Sozialdemokratie in Polen 1918‚Äì1939. Schriften des Bundesarchivs, 49. D√ºsseldorf: Droste, 1997, pp. 95‚Äì7. After the split, the relations between DSAP‚ÄìLinke and the mother-party DSAP (or DSAP‚ÄìRechts, i.e. 'DSAP‚ÄìRight', as DSAP‚ÄìLinke branded the party) were antagonistic. DSAP‚ÄìLinke characterized DSAP and the Polish Socialist Party (PPS) as 'social fascists', arguing that the leaderships of those two parties were laying the foundations for fascism in Poland. The DSAP press organs, on their behalf, began using the spelling 'Szajbel' for Scheibler's name, thus insinuating that he was Jewish (Scheibler wasn't of Jewish origin, but had married a Jewish woman). The peak of activity of DSAP‚ÄìLinke coincided with the 1930 October‚ÄìNovember campaign ahead of the parliamentary election. DSAP‚ÄìLinke contested the election in coalition with the Polish Socialist Party ‚Äì Left, running on joint lists titled PPS‚ÄìLewica (List 23). The bloc propagated the formation of a Workers-Peasants government and self-rule for national minorities, political stands that attracted sharp attacks from the Sanacja government and the Centrolew opposition coalition (in which the DSAP participated). The Polish government classified the DSAP‚ÄìLinke as 'crypto- communist'. The list on which Scheibler was the number 2 candidate was declared invalid by the Polish government.Blachetta-Madajczyk, Petra. Klassenkampf oder Nation?: deutsche Sozialdemokratie in Polen 1918‚Äì1939. Schriften des Bundesarchivs, 49. D√ºsseldorf: Droste, 1997, p. 99. On January 5, 1931 DSAP‚ÄìLinke organized an assembly in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. The political police, assisted by uniformed policemen, arrested all participants and party materials were seized. 46 participants were accused of anti-state activities. In October 1931, a legal case against twenty-two party cadres accused of connections with the Soviet Union, was opened. Scheibler was threatened with two years imprisonment, but on March 23, 1932 he was found 'not guilty'.Blachetta- Madajczyk, Petra. Klassenkampf oder Nation?: deutsche Sozialdemokratie in Polen 1918‚Äì1939. Schriften des Bundesarchivs, 49. D√ºsseldorf: Droste, 1997, pp. 99‚Äì100. After a short existence, DSAP‚ÄìLinke became defunct. Already after the 1930 election, the view inside the party was that the party was lacking prospects for the future. Sometime around 1932 Scheibler joined the Communist Party of Poland (KPP). Most members of the political activist core of DSAP‚ÄìLinke also joined KPP. Some former DSAP‚ÄìLinke members rejoined DSAP.

January by urban areas The Mobile Statbank from Statistics Denmark The natural harbour and strategic location have given K√∏ge a long history as a market town. Today, that past is evident in a well-preserved old town centre with many half-timbered houses. K√∏ge is located in the Copenhagen metropolitan area and is connected to downtown Copenhagen by the E line of the S-train commuter rail system. K√∏ge is also on the Copenhagen-Ringsted Line that was opened in June 2019. The new line positioned K√∏ge as a central hub in Denmark's transport system.  History  Like most Danish cities, the origins of K√∏ge precede written history. K√∏ge was first recognized as an official market town in 1288, as a contrast to the ecclesiastical center at that time ‚Äì Roskilde, and was an important merchant town during the late Middle Ages. During the local witchhunt, called K√∏ge Huskors (1608‚Äì1615), at least 15 people were convicted of witchcraft and burned at the stake. K√∏ge suffered during the wars between Denmark and Sweden (1643‚Äì1720, ‚Üí Battle of K√∏ge Bay). In 1807, the town and surrounding area was the scene of the Battle of K√∏ge between British and Danish troops. K√∏ge remained a small town until the late 19th century, when industrial development and population growth began. Today, K√∏ge form the core of the 18th largest urban area in Denmark.

Born in Harlem, New York, he used his deep knowledge and experience of that borough to produce films that tell unique and often inspiring stories of Harlem's history. Based at Thirteen/WNET in New York City, William Miles produced many films dedicated to the African-American experience that have been broadcast nationwide. Miles' interest in creating historical documentaries was nurtured through 25 years of restoring archival films and early feature classics for Killiam Shows, Inc. and the Walter Reade Organization in New York City. Miles' film archive is held by the Washington University Film & Media Archive. in St. Louis, Missouri. In addition to Miles' films, the collection contains all of the elements that went into the production process such as interviews, stock footage, photographs, research, producer notes, scripts, and Miles' personal papers. Filmography Miles' breakthrough film was Men of Bronze, which opened at the New York Film Festival in 1977 and was later broadcast on PBS. This film tells the story of the black American soldiers of the 369th Infantry Regiment, known as the Harlem Hellfighters, who, because of segregation in the U.S. Army, fought under the French flag in World War I. The regiment spent more time in the front-line trenches that any other American unit, fighting alongside French, Moroccan, and Senegalese soldiers. His best-known work, the four-part series I Remember Harlem (1981), is a comprehensive look at this famous borough's diverse history. Beginning in the 17th century and going up to the early 1980s, the film chronicles the changes in Harlem. The program's episodes include segments on Harlem's early history and settlement, the Harlem Renaissance, the Great Depression in Harlem, the Civil Rights Movement and political activism in the era of Malcolm X, and the problems and redevelopment of the '70s. The Different Drummer: Blacks in the Military (1983) concentrated on African-American soldiers in recent decades. Miles's three-part program Black Champions (1986) dealt with African-American athletes and their role in the fight against discrimination. Important topics included the impressive performances of various black athletes at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, Jackie Robinson's integration of Major League Baseball, Althea Gibson's achievements in tennis, and the careers of early black football stars. Miles co-produced the film on literary legend James Baldwin: The Price of a Ticket, which debuted in 1989 as an episode of PBS's American Masters series. Black Stars in Orbit (1990), a documentary about African-Americans in the space program, was followed by Liberators: Fighting on Two Fronts in World War II (1992), which Miles co-produced with Nina Rosenblum. The latter program continued Miles's focus on the experiences of black soldiers and centered on the liberation of Nazi concentration camps. The Black West, an episode of the TBS series, The Untold West, presented the story of African Americans in the U.S. west in the late 19th century. Mr. Miles has won an Emmy Award, been nominated for an Academy Award, and was inducted into the Black Filmmaker's Hall of Fame. He has also received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Association of Independent Video and Filmmakers (AIVF) for his outstanding contributions to the history of African Americans in the medium of film.

Throughout his teenage years, he produced numerous images containing putti, chubby male children usually nude and sometimes winged.

With a population of 7,581 (as of 1 January 2020),BY3: Population 1 January, by urban areas The Mobile Statbank from Statistics Denmark it is the main town and the administrative seat of the T√∏nder Municipality. History The first mention of T√∏nder might have been in the mid-12th century, when the Arab geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi mentioned the landmark Tu(r)ndira, which might have been a reference to either T√∏nder, or the nearby town of M√∏gelt√∏nder. T√∏nder was granted port privileges by the Hanseatic League in 1243, making it Denmark's oldest privileged market town. In 1532 it was hit by severe floods, with water levels reaching 1.8 m in St Laurent's church, 5.3 m above sea level. In the 1550s, T√∏nder's port lost direct access to the sea due to dykes being built to the west of town at the direction of Duke Hans the Elder of Schleswig- Holstein-Haderslev, the son of Frederick I of Denmark. The town centre is dominated by houses from the late 17th and early 18th century, when the town experienced rapid growth as a result of its lace industry. Prior to 1864, T√∏nder was situated in the Duchy of Schleswig, so its history is intertwined with the contentious history of Schleswig-Holstein. In the 1920s, when the Schleswig Plebiscite incorporated Northern Schleswig into Denmark, 76.5% of T√∏nder's inhabitants voted to remain part of Germany and 23.5% voted to join Denmark. During World War I, a Zeppelin base was operated in T√∏nder by the Imperial German Navy. The base was attacked by the British on 19 July 1918, in what is known as the Tondern raid. Seven Sopwith Camels from the aircraft carrier bombed the base, hitting two of the three airship hangars. The Zeppelins L.54 and L.60 inside one hangar were destroyed and a balloon inside the other was damaged. After this, T√∏nder was abandoned as an active airship base, and was used only as an emergency landing site. A wartime aircraft hangar survives, as do some of the ancillary buildings, but only the foundations remain of the large airship hangars. The site now houses a museum, named the Zeppelin and Garrison Museum T√∏nder. After the First World War, T√∏nder was detached from Germany, in spite of the majority of its population casting a pro-German vote in the Schleswig Plebiscites - as T√∏nder was included in Zone I, which as a whole had a strong pro-Danish majority. In the years that followed, German political parties enjoyed a majority in the city council, and until 1945, the city was officially bilingual. After the end of the German occupation of Denmark, the political influence of the German population dwindled considerably. In spite of the improvement in cross-border traffic, the location of the town continued to hamper industrial growth through the late 20th century, although some companies did set up businesses. Tourism has grown in importance. In 1989, T√∏nder Seminarium, the oldest teacher training college in Scandinavia, established in 1788, was closed. Attractions Pedestrian street Every August, the T√∏nder Festival offers visitors a wide variety of traditional and modern folk music. The Scouts of T√∏nder are twinned with Hemyock, in Devon, England, and make exchange trips between the countries every few years.  Marriage  As T√∏nder is the first town over the border in Denmark from Germany, the town has been a particularly popular place to elope since the 1960s. This is especially true for couples of mixed-nationalities, particularly between Europeans citizens and non-European citizens. This is due in part to Denmark's liberal marriage laws, compared to those in nearby Germany which requires a minimum of three months administration and the ceremony has to be in German. However, in Denmark it can be done in just around a week, with fewer documents required and the vows can be done in languages other than the national language. In 2007, over 2500 marriages were done at T√∏nder town hall by non-resident couples compared to just 150 local couples.

It has the distinction of being the first lucha film starring any of the \\"Big 3\\" (Santo, Blue Demon, Mil M√°scaras) to be produced in English. It was a tribute to the 1960s Mexican horror and lucha libre films and was the first of a trilogy of Mil Mascaras films that includes Academy of Doom (2008) and Aztec Revenge (2015). Plot An Aztec mummy is resurrected in a ceremony in which the blood of a human sacrifice is dripped onto the mummified remains. The mummy possesses a scepter with a jewel that can be used to control people‚Äôs minds for purposes of world conquest. Mil M√°scaras learns of the mummy‚Äôs plans and is determined to thwart him. When the scepter fails to do so, the mummy attempts to control Mil's mind by exploiting the hallucinogenic effects of Aztec magic mushrooms and the allure of identical twin seductresses. Mil tracks the mummy to an abandoned monastery but is captured. After escaping with the help of the Professor, Mil is joined by a team of luchadores in a battle against the mummy's warriors. Mil eventually defeats the mummy and entombs him forever.

Critical response The film screened at festivals around the world, garnering awards and award nominations along with very positive critical reviews. In particular, a review from the Cine Fantastico festival in Estepona, Spain, suggested that the film may be the best ever made in the traditionally Mexican lucha genre, despite being produced in the United States. Reviews from major film critics were similarly positive, with PopMatters' Bill Gibron calling it \\"amazing movie entertainment... rivals any super hero film made in the mainstream\\" and M. J. Simpson giving it an 'A' (the highest letter grade). Similarly positive reviews accompanied the film's theatrical release in 2009, with Fangoria magazine giving it 3.5 skulls (out of 4).

The screenplay focuses on two lonely people who tentatively forge a relationship over the course of three days. Dustin Hoffman plays an American composer who loses his job and his position of father of the bride in the course of a single day overseas while Emma Thompson plays an airport worker with a jaundiced view of relationships. Plot Divorced American Harvey Shine writes jingles for television commercials, a job not in keeping with his dream of being a jazz pianist and composer. His position at work is tenuous as he departs for London to attend his daughter Susan's wedding. Upon arrival at Heathrow Airport, he encounters Kate Walker, a single Londoner who works collecting statistics from passengers as they pass through the terminals. Tired and anxious to get to his hotel, Harvey brusquely dismisses her when she approaches him with the survey. Arriving at his hotel Harvey discovers that he is the only wedding guest booked in there. He is hurt to discover that his ex-wife Jean has rented a house to accommodate everyone who is attending from the States, except him. At the dinner on the night preceding the wedding, it becomes increasingly clear Harvey is now an outsider to his daughter's life and is being excluded from the clan around his ex-wife's new husband Brian. Their politeness towards him is insincere and makes him feel embarrassed and uncomfortable. Harvey tells Susan that he will be attending the ceremony but not the reception because he has to urgently return to the States. Susan replies that, as her step-father, Brian has been more of a father to her in the last few years than Harvey has and that she is going to ask him to give her away at her wedding. Meanwhile, Kate is on a blind date that is not going well. After taking a phone call from her neurotic mother Maggie, she returns to the table to discover that her date has bumped into friends at the bar and invited them to join them. Feeling socially awkward and excluded from the group, she eventually goes home. The following morning Harvey attends the wedding and then leaves immediately for the airport, having been excluded again and seated at the back of the church instead of the front in his true place next to his daughter. Owing to the heavy London traffic he is delayed and misses his flight back to the States. When he calls his boss to advise him he will be returning later than planned he is fired. Needing to drown his sorrows, Harvey goes to an airport bar and sees Kate who is there having a solitary lunch. Recognizing her from the day before, he apologizes for his rude behavior. She initially resists the attention he is paying her but soon they're both glad to finally have an honest, genuine conversation with someone. Harvey, feeling lonely and not wanting to stay in an hotel by the airport, follows Kate and joins her on the train to Paddington station. He asks if he can walk her to her writing class on the South Bank. She accepts his offer and is pleased when he offers to wait for her and meet her afterwards. As they stroll along the South Bank River Thames, Harvey mentions he is missing Susan's wedding reception, and Kate urges him to go. He finally relents, but only if she will accompany him. Kate insists that she is not properly dressed for such an occasion, so Harvey buys her a dress and the two head to the Grosvenor House Hotel, where they are welcomed by Susan and squeezed in at two places on the children's table. When 'the-father-of-the- bride' is called upon to make a toast, Brian rises and begins to speak but Harvey interrupts claiming his right as her biological father. He then delivers a touching, eloquent speech that redeems him with his daughter and endears him to Kate. Following the bride and groom's first wedding dance, the groom calls Harvey up to dance with his daughter. He happily does so, and then all the guests join them on the dance floor. Harvey is enjoying himself on the dance floor and Kate is left at the children's table, finding herself again in the same position as on the blind date. She starts to feel socially awkward and out of place, alone in the room full of strangers. Harvey is dancing and appears to have forgotten Kate. She bears her feelings as long as she can and eventually quietly leaves. Soon after Harvey returns to the table to find her gone. Harvey, now looking for Kate, goes into the corridor and seeing her waiting for the elevator, he disappears into a side room where there is a piano and begins to softly play one of his own jazz compositions. She hears the music and follows it, finding Harvey smiling and waiting for her. He asks her to stay and return to the reception so he can dance her socks off. She agrees and they have a great time together. Following the reception, Harvey and Kate walk and talk through London until dawn. Upon parting they exchange a single, gentle kiss and agree to meet at noon later that day. Back at his hotel, Harvey experiences serious heart palpitations having had to use the stairs as both lifts are out of order. He is taken to hospital. Forced to stay over night for treatment he misses the appointment with Kate, who turned up as agreed and waited for him. Upon being discharged the next day Harvey receives a call from his boss who has discovered that he needs Harvey to continue handling the account at work. He urges Harvey to return as soon as possible. Harvey quits his job, deciding he prefers to remain in London and explore the possibility of a relationship with Kate. He tracks down Kate's work number and calls her to explain but she refuses to take the call. He goes looking for her at the airport and eventually tracks her down at her writing class. He explains why he missed their rendezvous and tells her that he wants to stay in London and begin a relationship with her. Overcautious about romance because of so much past emotional pain, Kate resists, but finally agrees to give things a chance to his suggestion that they see what the future might bring. As they slowly stroll away along the South Bank, Harvey invites Kate to ask him the questions she would have asked him at the airport terminal, and this time, he happily answers, telling her his place of residence \\"...is in transition.\\" Cast * Dustin Hoffman as Harvey Shine * Emma Thompson as Kate Walker * Eileen Atkins as Maggie Walker * Kathy Baker as Jean * James Brolin as Brian * Liane Balaban as Susan Shine * Daniel Lapaine as Scott Wright * Richard Schiff as Marvin * Dennis Gimes as Bus Driver Production According to interviews with Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman in An Unconventional Love Story: The Making of Last Chance Harvey, a bonus feature on the DVD release of the film, both had been anxious to work with each other again ever since completing Stranger Than Fiction. When screenwriter/director Joel Hopkins approached her with the script, Thompson suggested he tailor it to accommodate Hoffman, who agreed to portray Harvey if Hopkins would allow his actors the leeway to improvise some of their scenes. Hopkins complied, and several of Harvey and Kate's conversations were ad-libbed while keeping within the dictates of the plot.

I reluctantly gave in to this imperfect movie, despite the cornball dialogue, pedestrian filmmaking, some wincing physical comedy and Mr. Hoffman‚Äôs habit of trying to win the audience over by simply staring at the camera with a hapless deadpan that says: Look at me, I‚Äôm still cute as a button, still cute as Benjamin in The Graduate, and I‚Äôm still kind of lost and still very much in need of your love.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called the film a \\"tremendously appealing love story surrounded by a movie not worthy of it. For Dustin Hoffman . . . it provides a rare chance to play ... an ordinary guy. For Emma Thompson, there is an opportunity to use her gifts for tact and insecurity . . . When Last Chance Harvey gets out of their way and leaves them alone to relate with each other, it's sort of magical. Then the lumber of the plot apparatus is trundled on, and we wish it were a piece for two players . . . [W]hat's good is very good . . . Pitch perfect. But then the dialogue fades down, and the camera pulls back and shows them talking and smiling freely, and the music gets happier, and there is a montage showing them walking about London with lots and lots of scenery in the frame . . . Last Chance Harvey has everything it needs but won't stop there. It needs the nerve to push all the way. It is a pleasure to look upon the faces of Hoffman and Thompson, so pleasant, so real. Their dialogue together finds the right notes for crossing an emotional minefield. They never descend into tear- jerking or cuteness. They are all grown up and don't trust love nearly as much as straight talk. Hopkins deserves credit for creating these characters. Then he should have stood back and let them keep right on talking. Their pillow talk would have been spellbinding.\\" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle observed, \\"One's enjoyment of Last Chance Harvey will depend on how suitable one considers the pairing of these characters and how felicitous one considers the pairing of these performers. The latter is most important, because if you enjoy Hoffman and Thompson together, you might be able to overlook the ghastly prospect of poor Kate's throwing her life away on this guy. To be sure, Thompson and Hoffman are watchable and engaging, and that counts for something. But they don't look right as a couple, and each is more interesting in his or her scenes apart than they are together.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly graded the film B-, calling it \\"a losers- in-love comedy with no big surprises, but in the age of Internet dating, the prospect of two strangers trying this valiantly to connect in public carries a dash of romantic heroism . . . These two deserved the intimate incandescence of their own Before Sunrise, rather than the slightly generic sentimentality of a cross-Atlantic Marty. But Hoffman and Thompson are each good enough to bring out a glow in the other.\\" Marjorie Baumgarten of the Austin Chronicle said, \\"With its thin plot and its title character an American abroad in London, Last Chance Harvey comes across as something like a Before Sunrise for the less-than-nubile set. Were that writer/director Hopkins' dialogue and visualization as scintillating as Richard Linklater's is in his Sunrise/Sunset romances. Of course, the combined acting brilliance of Hoffman and Thompson could elevate the hoariest of clich√©s and turn almost anything they touch golden ‚Äì and that is most often the case with Last Chance Harvey. But no one's skills can transcend the kooky banality of a trying-on-dresses montage or burnish the somewhat creepy way in which Harvey first comes on to Kate. Still, these two prove a pleasure to watch, and their conversations are realistic troves of give and take . . . Middle-aged romances are, sadly, hard to find on the silver screen, so it's with some hesitation I pronounce Last Chance Harvey not up to snuff. Yet if we are to see any more romances starring characters old enough to have witnessed both Hoffman and Thompson winning Oscars, it's our responsibility to go out and support this one.\\"Austin Chronicle review Claudia Puig of USA Today noted, \\"The film's biggest asset is the pitch- perfect performances of the two stars. They have a gentle rapport that unfolds convincingly after some initial testiness. It takes two consummate actors to make quickly escalating chemistry feel so natural. We find ourselves heartily rooting for them. Hoffman and Thompson rise above the sometimes obvious story arc, and the result is a surprisingly tender and appealing love story.\\" Joshua Rothkopf of Time Out New York rated the film three out of five stars and commented, \\"If anything can be said to be wrong with so benign an affair, it‚Äôs simply that Last Chance Harvey doesn‚Äôt feel much like cinema. Little excites the material visually; the film‚Äôs dully lensed Blighty lends nothing to the drama. But to watch Hoffman and Thompson work the lines is to witness two extremely unlikely stars recapture the essence of their appeal: The tiny neurotic is suddenly Romeo again, while the cool Brit melts in the light of affection. For some, that will be enough.\\" Awards and nominations Dustin Hoffman was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor ‚Äì Motion Picture Musical or Comedy but lost to Colin Farrell in In Bruges. Emma Thompson was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress ‚Äì Motion Picture Musical or Comedy but lost to Sally Hawkins in Happy-Go-Lucky.

Executed between 1645 and 1652, Bernini intended to show Truth allegorically as a naked young woman being unveiled by a figure of Time above her, but the figure of Time was never executed. Bernini still expressed a wish to add the figure as late as 1665.Wittkower, p. 268. Bernini's rationale for creating the work was, according to his son Domenico, as a sculptural retort to attacks from opponents criticising his failed project to build two towers onto the front of St. Peter's Basilica. Cracks had appeared in the facade due to the inability of the foundations to support the towers and Bernini's architectural expansion received the blame, although historians are unsure as to the validity of this legend.Mormando, p.156 Bernini began the preparatory work for Truth Unveiled by Time in 1645, during the critical period after the death of his main patron pope Urban VIII, and the figure of Truth was largely complete by 1652. Despite never completing the figure of Time, Bernini left the sculpture in his will in perpetuity to the first-born of the Bernini family; although in fact Bernini tried to sell the work to Cardinal Mazarin of France. It remained in the family (displayed on a tilted stucco block during the 19th century) until 1924, when it was purchased by the Italian government and transferred to its current home on a plinth in room VI of the Galleria Borghese.G Galleria Borghese 2 Its plinth there was originally tilted but it is now on a flat plinth after a recent restoration, leaving Truth more upright as it was originally displayed.

The publication of his 1978 book, Histologic Diagnosis of Inflammatory Skin DiseasesA.B. Ackerman, Histologic Diagnosis of Inflammatory Skin Diseases, Lea and Febiger, Philadelphia 1978 was a landmark both in Ackerman's career and for the profile of dermatopathology. It is one of the few medical texts that looks like a coffee table art book. It introduced the concept of pattern diagnosis- the examination of a slide at scanning magnification and analysis of the silhouette of lesion rather than of its cells to a large audience. It also was organized by an algorithm rather than by disease, as opposed to most pathology or dermatology textbooks. Starting in 1992, he became a member of the faculty of Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia.

Limits The ancient principality of Moldavia comprised the entire Moldavian Plateau and some neighbouring geomorphological units like the Carpathians The Moldavian Plateau is bounded (in clockwise order): * to the west by the Eastern Carpathian Mountains (), * to north and north-east by the Podolian Plateau (), * to the east and south east by Black Sea Lowland across which to the east stretches the Pontic Plain (), part of the Eurasian steppe () and to the south towards the Black Sea the Bugeac Plain (), (3,210 km2 in Moldova) * to the south by the Romanian Plain, also known as Wallachian Plain and BƒÉrƒÉgan Plain (), and * to the southwest by the Vrancea Hills (), part of the Subcarpa»õii de curburƒÉ (literally \\"Curvature Subcarpathians\\" The Moldavian Plateau composes over two-thirds of the territory of the medieval Principality of Moldavia, with the Eastern Carpathian Mountains and the Bugeac Plain representing the remaining part. This fact is the origin of the name of the plateau. This geographic area (including Eastern Carpathians and the Bugeac) is also called (especially by historians) the Carpathian-Dniester-Pontic region, or the Carpathian-Dniester region, since it is bounded by the Carpathians to the west, by the river Dniester to the north and east, and by the Black Sea (Pontus Euxinus) and the Danube to the south-east and south. Genesis The Moldavian Plateau was formed at the end of the Neogene through sediments, over an old continental platform, the East European Platform. Afterwards, the settled sediments, which were brought in by rivers from the Carpathian Mountains, were modeled by the elements giving the plateau its current aspect. The materials that formed the sediments are gravel and sand. Hardened, they formed gritstones. All over the plateau, the latter are interspersed with clays, or badlands, which produce landslides. The slope of the terrain follows the direction of the rivers: from northwest to southeast. Along them, the altitude decreases from to under . The strata are disposed in North-South and northwest-southeast aligned layers, producing asymmetric valleys and ridges. Among the latter are the steep edge of the B√¢rlad Plateau (), known as the Ia»ôi Ridge (), the edge of the Central Moldavian Plateau (), known as the Corne»ôti Hills, and the edge of the Dniester Hills, known as the Dniester Ridge. The relief in the valleys of the rivers and creeks is quite conspicuous, so that the valleys have large terraces and hillocks. The Siret Passage (), ramified in the north with the Moldova Valley, and Suceava Valley cuts the main part of the plateau from the Moldavian Subcarpathians. The Prut Passage cuts the Plateau in half in the north-south direction. The Dniester Passage bounds it from the Podolian Plateau and the Pontic Plain. Its ramification RƒÉut Passage separates the main part of the Moldavian Plateau from the Dniester Hills Composition The Moldavian Plateau comprises several distinct regions: * The Bukovinian Subcarpathians in the northwest. * The Moldavian Subcarpathians in the west and southwest, has altitudes of up to , but also includes depressions. * The Suceava Plateau (), situated in the northwest, has altitudes that exceed and long ridges. * The Dniester Hills (), also known as Northern Moldavian Plateau (Podi≈üul Moldovei de Nord), situated in the north and northeast, ridges along the Dniester River and has elevations of approximately . * The Moldavian Plain (), in the center-north has elevations of approximately : ** The Jijia Plain, west of the river Prut. ** The Middle Prut Valley, east of the river Prut, creeks tributary to the Prut, . ** The BƒÉl»õi Steppe, east of the river Prut, creeks tributary to the Dniester, . * The B√¢rlad Plateau (), situated in the south-center occasionally has heights over , but is generally sloped from north at to the south at . * The Central Moldavian Plateau (), situated in the center and southeast, has elevations that in the north-south direction decrease in altitude from to under . * The Bugeac Plain, the last continuation of the Pontic-Caspian steppe. Climate The climate of this plateau is transitional Temperate Continental. Overall, the altitude affects the climate, with annual mean temperatures in the Suceava Plateau ranging between and and precipitation of to per year and, with annual mean temperatures of to and precipitation of to in the Moldavian Plain or B√¢rlad Plateau. The main influence on the climate is Dry Continental with frequent cold north winds in winter. In the Suceava Plateau and the Dniester Hills, there is an influence of Scandinavo-Baltic climate with the circulation of masses of polar air in the winter. Waters Streams on the plateau flow into the Siret, Prut, or Dneister rivers. The Prut has the Jijia as its principal tributary. The Siret traverses and‚Äîwith the exception of the Subcarpathians‚Äîlimits the Moldavian Plateau The lack of precipitation has required water management in the Jijia Plain and in the BƒÉl»õi steppe which serves as a reservoir and for fish farming; Lake Drac≈üani is the most largest of these. Other bodies of water are the rivers Siret and Prut (Lake St√¢nca-Coste≈üti, Lake DubƒÉsari), in the Siret Passage.  Natural resources  The Moldavian Plateau holds hydrocarbon resources (petroleum and the associated gases), which are extracted in the southwest portion. In the northwest are found Romania's most important reserves of kaolin (china clay), extracted and used to produce porcelain. Hemp is cultivated in the Suceava plateau, cereals and wine grapes (Vitis vinifera) in the Jijia Plain, BƒÉl»õi steppe, B√¢rlad Plateau and Central Moldavian Plateau. In the Siret Passage they cultivate potatoes and sugar beets. Animals Characteristic of the plateau are mammals such as goats, wild boars, wolves, foxes, European wildcats, lynxes, badgers, and hares. Birds include black grouse, woodpeckers, cuckoos, pheasants, quails, hawks, owls, and fish include perch and the carp- like barbel.

The name of the breed derives from , the name of Agrigento in local Sicilian language. There were in the past more than 30,000 head in the hills and coastal zone of the province. Today, however, this breed is in danger of disappearance. History The Girgentana was first described by Arturo Magliano in 1930; the origins of the breed are unknown. The animals could have been introduced to Sicily by Greek colonists about 700 BC, or in the eighth century AD by Arab invaders. identified the Girgentana with Capra prisca and the Ram in a Thicket statues excavated at Ur by Leonard Woolley in 1927‚Äì28. Leopold Adametz proposed that it is descended, at least in part, from the markhor, Capra falconeri, a species of Central Asian goat-antelope; the horns are superficially similar, but spiral in opposite directions ‚Äì the right horn of the Girgentana spirals clockwise from the base (like a corkscrew), while in the markhor it is the left. The Girgentana is one of the eight autochthonous Italian goat breeds for which a genealogical herdbook is kept by the Associazione Nazionale della Pastorizia, the Italian national association of sheep-breeders. It was formerly numerous in the province of Agrigento, where there were more than 30,000 in the coastal area and the hilly hinterland. It has since fallen rapidly, to the point that measures for its protection may be needed. At the end of 1993 the population was estimated at 524. The conservation status of the breed was listed as \\"endangered\\" by the FAO in 2007. At the end of 2013 the registered population was 390. Characteristics The Girgentana goat has characteristic horns, twisted into a spiral form. It has a long beard and a primarily white coat with grey-brown hair around the head and throat. It has a good production of high-quality milk.

Biography He was born in Radeberg and died in Berlin. He studied law and worked as an actuary for the courts, administrator and chancery clerk. In 1800, he used his private means to devote himself to writing. After 1820, he worked as a censor in the area of belles lettres, with enviable objectivity striking his own works from the catalog. Extremely proficient in metrical composition, and commanding an inexhaustible fund of drollery, he cultivated with especial success the comical poetic tale, frequently inclining toward frivolity, but teeming with fun. Many of his works have been illustrated by Johann Heinrich Ramberg, a renowned illustrator and painter of the Goethe era. The widespread popularity of Langbein's Schw√§nke (1792, 21st ed. 1888) was almost equaled by that of his merry tales in prose, such as Thomas Kellerwurm (1806), Magister Zimpels Brautfahrt, and others, distinguished for inventive faculty and pleasing diction. Although a productive writer, his means were meager until the King granted him a pension. As a person, he was amiable and kind, although somewhat anxious. As a writer, he was reproached for being frivolous and superficial. His writing was inventive and showed talent for humor and verse, but completely lacked the poet's touch. While he was much read with enjoyment by the public of the 1820s, this speaks more against the times than against the writer, who was very conscious of his shortcomings.

Education and personal life Anne E. Derse completed her Bachelor of Arts in French and Linguistics from Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1976 and her Master of Arts in International Relations from Johns Hopkins University's Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) in 1981. She also graduated with distinction from the State Department's Economic and Commercial Studies program in 1989. Derse is married to fellow (now retired) foreign service officer E. Mason \\"Hank\\" Hendrickson. Career Derse joined the Department of State in 1981, and served in Trinidad and Tobago from 1981 to 1983. From 1985 to 1988 she followed her husband to Singapore, where he served as First Secretary of the United States Embassy in Singapore there; however, he was expelled by the Singaporean government in May 1988 for his alleged involvement with opposition politicians Francis Seow and Patrick Seong, in an incident which came to be known as the \\"Hendrickson affair\\". Her most influential role came in 1999 when, as Minister Counselor for Economic Affairs at the U.S. Mission to the European Union (USEU), she led the Mission's economic team covering U.S.-EU economic relations and served as the last U.S. Commissioner on the Tripartite Gold Commission, which adjudicated sovereign claims for Nazi gold recovered by the Allies after World War II. In late 2004 she assisted in establishing the new U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, serving there as Minister Counselor for Economic Affairs. Derse was the U.S. Ambassador to the Republic of Azerbaijan from May 2006 until July 2009. On June 4, 2009, it was announced that Derse would be appointed by President Barack Obama to serve as ambassador to Lithuania. She was confirmed by the Senate on July 24, 2009. She was sworn in on September 28, 2009, and presented her credentials on October 14, 2009.

Prevotella spp. are members of the oral, vaginal, and gut microbiota and are often recovered from anaerobic infections of the respiratory tract. These infections include aspiration pneumonia, lung abscess, pulmonary empyema, and chronic otitis media and sinusitis. They have been isolated from abscesses and burns in the vicinity of the mouth, bites, paronychia, urinary tract infection, brain abscesses, osteomyelitis, and bacteremia associated with upper respiratory tract infections. Prevotella spp. predominate in periodontal disease and periodontal abscesses.  Role in gut microbiota  Research of human microbiota show that human gut is mainly inhabited by two phyla of bacteria ‚Äì Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, the latter mostly dominated by Bacteroides and Prevotella genera. Prevotella and Bacteroides are thought to have had a common ancestor. Formally, the two genera were differentiated in 1990. However classification is still undergoing, for example Bacteroides melaninogenicus has been reclassified and split into Prevotella melaninogenica and Prevotella intermedia. Either Prevotella or Bacteroides dominates the gut and they were proposed to be antagonistic. Prevotella is more common in non-Westernised populations consuming plant-rich diet. In Western populations it has also been associated with vegetarian or Mediterranean diets rich in fruits and vegetables. In accordance, genome analysis of Prevotella copri showed it was deficient in the ability to degrade host glycans and is more genetically equipped for plant glycan degradation. In a study of gut bacteria of children in Burkina Faso (in Africa), Prevotella made up 53% of the gut bacteria, but were absent in age-matched European children. Studies also indicate that long- term diet is strongly associated with the gut microbiome composition‚Äîthose who eat plenty of protein and animal fats typical of Western diet have predominantly Bacteroides bacteria, while for those who consume more carbohydrates, especially fibre, the Prevotella species dominate. However, Prevotella has been also associated to gut inflammation. It was demonstrated that increased levels of P. copri might contribute to chronic inflammation in HIV patients. One single species isolate P. copri CB7 has been used for different studies that showed it can be beneficial or detrimental, depending on the context. Prevotella is a large genus with high species diversity and high genetic diversity between strains. A recent study on Prevotella derived from humans compared the gene repertoires of its species derived from different body sites of human. It also reported an open pan- genome showing a vast diversity of the gene pool. In addition to genetic and overall microbiota differences in host the high genetic variety of Prevotella makes it difficult to predict their function that can be different in different individuals.  Role in vaginal microbiota  Prevotella species are also common vaginal commensals. Increased abundance of Prevotella in vaginal mucosa has been associated to bacterial vaginosis. Prevotella was shown to be the most heritable bacterial group in vaginal microbiome and its abundance was linked to body mass index and hormonal milieu. Prevotella bivia produces lipopolysaccharides and ammonia that are part of vaginal mucus. It is also associated with epithelial cytokine production and enhances the growth of other bacterial vaginosis-associated organisms, such as Gardnerella vaginalis. The later in turn was found to stimulate growth of P. bivia.  Pathogenicity  Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens were associated with inflammatory periodontal diseases, such as pregnancy gingivitis, acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis and adult periodontitis. Together with Porphyromonas gingivalis they are known as black-pigmenting anaerobes. All three require haemin as the source of iron for their growth. These species were shown to bind lactoferrin that is released together with the contents of neutrophils during inflammation and bleeding in periodontitis patients. Lactoferrin inhibits the growth of P. gingivalis but not the Prevotella species. Inorganic iron and iron-binding proteins such as transferrin and lactoferrin do not support the growth of P. intermedia, however hemin‚Äìiron- containing compounds which include hemin, human hemoglobin, bovine hemoglobin, and bovine catalase stimulate the growth of Prevotella intermedia. Hemoglobin- binding protein on the cell surface of P.intermedia has been described. P. copri has been correlated with onset of rheumatoid arthritis. An overgrowth of Prevotella and a reduction of Lactobacillus have been correlated with the onset of osteomyelitis in mice. The reduction of Prevotella in model mice led to an increase of Lactobacillus showing a protection effect against osteomyelitis. Thus, changes in the microbiota Prevotella may be related to the development of osteomyelitis.

Milde is situated in the borough of Ytrebygda about south of the city centre of Bergen and about southeast of the village area of Hjellestad on the other side of the peninsula. As a basic statistical unit Milde had a population of 516 as of 1 January 2008. Milde has been settled for a long time, there being evidence of cultivation of grain since around the year 100 AD, while the cultural landscape dates back to around the year 200 BC. Milde peninsula has been surrounded by water on all sides since 1996, when a channel was built between the bays of V√•gsb√∏pollen and Vestrepollen. Arboretum and Botanical Garden of Bergen is located in Milde. The modern neighborhood is built upon the lands of the two farms that historically have made up Milde: Store Milde and Lille Milde. The original farm was first recorded circa 1530 and was subsequently divided into two parcels, although ownership largely remained undivided until 1816. Toward the end of the Middle Ages, the property belonged to the Dominican convent in Bergen. The farms were in royal ownership from 1624‚Äì1639. Store Milde Store Milde is a manor house located on Hjellestad peninsula in the borough of Fana, on the north side of Fanafjorden. The manor house reached its present size during the second half of the 1600s. Bergen merchant Sander Janson (1595-1649) owned Milde from 1639. It is probable that he expanded the main building into a manor house with landscaped garden. In 1723, the farms were foreclosed by Henrich Henrichsen Weinwich (1676-1733). Weinwich probably rebuilt part of the main building. The manor house was rebuilt in the Rococo style around 1784, when Johan Frederik Cappe (1742‚Äì1817) owned Store Milde. In 1909 Store Milde was taken over by the municipality of Fana. In 1916, architect Ole Landmark designed a restoration. Store Milde has been protected by under Norwegian Cultural Heritage since 1924.

Powell Sr., is the Quaker conference and retreat center of the New York Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends, located in Old Chatham, New York.Powell House Website  Use  Powell House is used primarily for religious conferences and similar gatherings of members and attenders of meetings belonging to New York Yearly Meeting. It is also used for meetings of Yearly Meeting committees or conferences sponsored by them. The programs include a wide variety of educational, inspirational, and organizational activities for youth and adults related to the religious, benevolent, and social concerns of the Religious Society of Friends. The facilities are available for use by affiliated Friends‚Äô organizations and other religious or educational groups having interests compatible with those of Friends. Short-term sojourners are sometimes accommodated.  History  In 1960 Elsie Powell donated residential property to New York Yearly Meeting. The yearly meeting decided to establish a retreat center on the property. Powell House held a 40th anniversary celebration in 2000. During 2008 and 2009 the Anna Curtis Center underwent renovation.Anna Curtis Center Renovation Blog The renovation included several energy-saving improvements such as the installation of solar panels and a radiant floor heating system. It made more space for conference activities and increased the sleeping capacity of the facility. It also made the facility handicapped accessible.  Campus  Powell House's campus now consists of Pitt Hall, the Anna Curtis Center, a director‚Äôs residence, a youth directors‚Äô residence, and fifty-seven acres of land with a campground and two wildlife ponds. Pitt Hall is where the majority of the adult conferences are held. The Anna Curtis Center, also known as the Youth Center, is where youth conferences are usually held.  Youth program  The youth program has conferences designed for several age groups. There are conferences for 4th and 5th graders, 6th through 8th, and 9th through 12th graders. Most youth conferences run from Friday dinner to Sunday lunch and have around 40 attenders. WinterSong and EarthSong are special youth conferences for which both buildings are required because there are nearly double the usual number of attendees. Earthsong celebrates the spring and the seniors who are graduating from the program. Wintersong celebrates warmth, community, and light in winter. Youth from 7th to 12th grades are invited to these conferences. = Activities = Typical conferences consist of the following elements: *Session: A time when the whole group gathers for discussion, games, or other activities. *Small group discussions *Free time *Meals and snacks: The youth help with dishes, cooking, cleaning, and other tasks and learn a good work ethic. *Work projects: The attenders are asked to help with some project that needs doing on the campus. *Workshops: Attenders choose to attend a workshop. Adults from the Quaker community are often asked to lead workshops for the youth. *Self space: A period in the middle of the conference set aside for relaxation and alone time. *Quiet time: Just before bed time the group gathers to here a story and say good night. = Leadership in the youth program = At most youth conferences there are only two adult leaders (the directors) and one adult presence (AP). Because most of the youth want to be there and enjoy the program immensely there is very little need for authoritative figures, however several Junior Councilors (JCs) are chosen for every 4th and 5th grade and 6th through 8th grade conference. JCs are youth slightly older than the youth attending the conference, who also attend conferences themselves. Once a year there is a JC training conference (JCT) during which attenders learn leadership and mediation skills. JCs lead small group discussions, work projects, games, meal and snack crews, and workshops. They are also expected to set an example for the other youth and help maintain the community's safety and order.

In contrast, categorical theories or models explain variation using qualitatively different states.  In physics  In physics, for example, the space-time continuum model describes space and time as part of the same continuum rather than as separate entities. A spectrum in physics, such as the electromagnetic spectrum, is often termed as either continuous (with energy at all wavelengths) or discrete (energy at only certain wavelengths). In contrast, quantum mechanics uses quanta, certain defined amounts (i.e. categorical amounts) which are distinguished from continuous amounts.  In mathematics and philosophy  A good introduction to the philosophical issues involved is John Lane Bell's essay in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. A significant divide is provided by the law of excluded middle. It determines the divide between intuitionistic continua such as Brouwer's and Lawvere's, and classical ones such as Stevin's and Robinson's. Bell isolates two distinct historical conceptions of infinitesimal, one by Leibniz and one by Nieuwentijdt, and argues that Leibniz's conception was implemented in Robinson's hyperreal continuum, whereas Nieuwentijdt's, in Lawvere's smooth infinitesimal analysis, characterized by the presence of nilsquare infinitesimals: \\"It may be said that Leibniz recognized the need for the first, but not the second type of infinitesimal and Nieuwentijdt, vice versa.

In social sciences (in general), psychology and psychiatry  In social sciences in general, psychology and psychiatry included, data about differences between individuals, like any data, can be collected and measured using different levels of measurement. Those levels include dichotomous (a person either has a personality trait or not) and non- dichotomous approaches. While the non-dichotomous approach allows for understanding that everyone lies somewhere on a particular personality dimension, the dichotomous (nominal categorical and ordinal) approaches only seek to confirm that a particular person either has or does not have a particular mental disorder. Expert witnesses particularly are trained to help courts in translating the data into the legal (e.g. 'guilty' vs. 'innocent') dichotomy, which apply to law, sociology and ethics.  Linguistics  In linguistics, the range of dialects spoken over a geographical area that differ slightly between neighboring areas is known as a dialect continuum.

The fundamental notion that a physical property can be \\"quantized\\" is referred to as \\"the hypothesis of quantization\\".Wiener, N. (1966). Differential Space, Quantum Systems, and Prediction. Cambridge: The Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press This means that the magnitude of the physical property can take on only discrete values consisting of integer multiples of one quantum. For example, a photon is a single quantum of light (or of any other form of electromagnetic radiation). Similarly, the energy of an electron bound within an atom is quantized and can exist only in certain discrete values. (Atoms and matter in general are stable because electrons can exist only at discrete energy levels within an atom.) Quantization is one of the foundations of the much broader physics of quantum mechanics. Quantization of energy and its influence on how energy and matter interact (quantum electrodynamics) is part of the fundamental framework for understanding and describing nature. Etymology and discovery The word quantum is the neuter singular of the Latin interrogative adjective quantus, meaning \\"how much\\". \\"Quanta\\", the neuter plural, short for \\"quanta of electricity\\" (electrons), was used in a 1902 article on the photoelectric effect by Philipp Lenard, who credited Hermann von Helmholtz for using the word in the area of electricity. However, the word quantum in general was well known before 1900.E. Cobham Brewer 1810‚Äì1897. Dictionary of Phrase and Fable. 1898. It was often used by physicians, such as in the term quantum satis. Both Helmholtz and Julius von Mayer were physicians as well as physicists. Helmholtz used quantum with reference to heat in his articleE. Helmholtz, Robert Mayer's Priorit√§t on Mayer's work, and the word quantum can be found in the formulation of the first law of thermodynamics by Mayer in his letter dated July 24, 1841. In 1901, Max Planck used quanta to mean \\"quanta of matter and electricity\\", gas, and heat. In 1905, in response to Planck's work and the experimental work of Lenard (who explained his results by using the term quanta of electricity), Albert Einstein suggested that radiation existed in spatially localized packets which he called \\"quanta of light\\" (\\"Lichtquanta\\").. A partial https://en.wikisource.org/?curid=59468 English translation is available from Wikisource. The concept of quantization of radiation was discovered in 1900 by Max Planck, who had been trying to understand the emission of radiation from heated objects, known as black-body radiation. By assuming that energy can be absorbed or released only in tiny, differential, discrete packets (which he called \\"bundles\\", or \\"energy elements\\"), Planck accounted for certain objects changing color when heated.Brown, T., LeMay, H., Bursten, B. (2008). Chemistry: The Central Science Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Education On December 14, 1900, Planck reported his findings to the German Physical Society, and introduced the idea of quantization for the first time as a part of his research on black-body radiation. As a result of his experiments, Planck deduced the numerical value of h, known as the Planck constant, and reported more precise values for the unit of electrical charge and the Avogadro-Loschmidt number, the number of real molecules in a mole, to the German Physical Society. After his theory was validated, Planck was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery in 1918. Quantization While quantization was first discovered in electromagnetic radiation, it describes a fundamental aspect of energy not just restricted to photons.Melville, K. (2005, February 11).

The player's ability to tolerate lag depends on the type of game being played. For instance, a strategy game or a turn-based game with a slow pace may have a high threshold or even be mostly unaffected by high lag. A game with twitch gameplay such as a first-person shooter with a considerably faster pace may require a significantly lower lag to provide satisfying gameplay. Ping time Ping time is the network latency between a player's client and the game server as measured with the ping utility or equivalent. Ping time is an average time in milliseconds (ms). The lower one's ping is, the lower the latency is and the less lag the player will experience. High ping and low ping are commonly used terms in online gaming, where high ping refers to a ping that causes a severe amount of lag; while any level of ping may cause lag, severe lag is usually indicated by a ping of over 100 ms. This usage is a gaming cultural colloquialism and is not commonly found or used in professional computer networking circles. In games where timing is key, such as first-person shooter and real-time strategy games, a low ping is always desirable, as a low ping means smoother gameplay by allowing faster updates of game data between the players' clients and game server. High latency can cause lag. Game servers may disconnect a client if the latency is too high and may pose a detriment to other players' gameplay. Similarly, client software will often mandate disconnection if the latency is too high. High ping may also cause servers to crash due to instability. In some first- person shooter games, a high ping may cause the player to unintentionally gain unfair advantages, such as disappearing from one location and instantaneously reappearing in another, simulating the effect of teleportation, thus making it hard for other players to judge their character's position and subsequently making the player much more difficult to target. To counter this, many game servers automatically kick players with a ping higher than average. Conversely, a high ping can make it very difficult for the player to play the game due to negative effects occurring, making it difficult for the player to track other players and even move their character. Rather than using the traditional ICMP echo request and reply network packets to determine ping times, video game programmers often build their own latency detection into existing game packets (usually based on the UDP protocol) instead. Some factors that might affect ping include: communication protocol used, Internet throughput (connection speed), the quality of a user's Internet service provider and the configuration of firewalls. Ping is also affected by geographical location. For instance, if someone is in India, playing on a server located in the United States, the distance between the two is greater than it would be for players located within the US, and therefore it takes longer for data to be transmitted. However, the amount of packet-switching and network hardware in between the two computers is often more significant. For instance, wireless network interface cards must modulate digital signals into radio signals, which is often more costly than the time it takes an electrical signal to traverse a typical span of cable. As such, lower ping can result in faster Internet download and upload rates.  Causes  A simplified game architectureWhile a single-player game maintains the main game state on the local machine, an online game requires it to be maintained on a central server in order to avoid inconsistencies between individual clients. As such, the client has no direct control over the central game state and may only send change requests to the server, and can only update the local game state by receiving updates from the server. This need to communicate causes a delay between the clients and the server, and is the fundamental cause behind lag. While there may be numerous underlying reasons for why a player experiences lag, they can be summarized as insufficient hardware in either the client or the server, or a poor connection between the client and server. Hardware related issues cause lag due to the fundamental structure of the game architecture. Generally, games consist of a looped sequence of states, or \\"frames\\". During each frame, the game accepts user input and performs necessary calculations (AI, graphics etc.). When all processing is finished, the game will update the game state and produce an output, such as a new image on the screen and/or a packet to be sent to the server. The frequency at which frames are generated is often referred to as the frame rate. As the central game state is located on the server, the updated information must be sent from the client to the server in order to take effect. In addition, the client must receive the necessary information from the server in order to fully update the state. Generating packets to send to the server and processing the received packets can only be done as often as the client is able to update its local state. Although packets could theoretically be generated and sent faster than this, it would only result in sending redundant data if the game state cannot be updated between each packet. A low frame rate would, therefore, make the game less responsive to updates and may force it to skip outdated data. Conversely, the same holds true for the server. The frame rate (or tick rate) of the server determines how often it can process data from clients and send updates. This type of problem is difficult to predict and compensate for. Apart from enforcing minimum hardware requirements and attempting to optimize the game for better performance, there are no feasible ways to deal with it. Perhaps the most common type of lag is caused by network performance problems. Losses, corruption or jitter (an outdated packet is in effect a loss) may all cause problems, but these problems are relatively rare in a network with sufficient bandwidth and no or little congestion. Instead, the latency involved in transmitting data between clients and server plays a significant role. Latency varies depending on a number of factors, such as the physical distance between the end-systems, as a longer distance means additional transmission length and routing required and therefore higher latency. Routing over the Internet may be extremely indirect, resulting in far more transmission length (and consequent latency) than a direct route, although the cloud gaming service OnLive has developed a solution to this issue by establishing peering relationships with multiple Tier 1 network Internet Service Providers and choosing an optimal route between server and user. In addition, insufficient bandwidth and congestion, even if not severe enough to cause losses, may cause additional delays regardless of distance. As with the hardware issues, packets that arrive slowly or not at all will make both the client and server unable to update the game state in a timely manner. Online game systems utilizing a wireless network may be subject to significant lag, depending on the architecture of the wireless network and local electromagnetic interference impacting that network. Electromagnetic interference (e.g. from a microwave oven) can cause transmitted packets to be lost, requiring a retransmission which incurs latency. Although radio propagation through the air is faster than light through an optical fiber, wireless systems are often shared among many users and may suffer from latency incurred due to network congestion, or due to network protocols that introduce latency.  Effects  The noticeable effects of lag vary not only depending on the exact cause, but also on any and all techniques for lag compensation that the game may implement (described below). As all clients experience some delay, implementing these methods to minimize the effect on players is important for smooth gameplay. Lag causes numerous problems for issues such as accurate rendering of the game state and hit detection. In many games, lag is often frowned upon because it disrupts normal gameplay. The severity of lag depends on the type of game and its inherent tolerance for lag. Some games with a slower pace can tolerate significant delays without any need to compensate at all, whereas others with a faster pace are considerably more sensitive and require extensive use of compensation to be playable (such as the first-person shooter genre). Due to the various problems lag can cause, players that have an insufficiently fast Internet connection are sometimes not permitted, or discouraged from playing with other players or servers that have a distant server host or have high latency to one another. Extreme cases of lag may result in extensive desynchronization of the game state. Lag due to an insufficient update rate between client and server can cause some problems, but these are generally limited to the client itself. Other players may notice jerky movement and similar problems with the player associated with the affected client, but the real problem lies with the client itself. If the client cannot update the game state at a quick enough pace, the player may be shown outdated renditions of the game, which in turn cause various problems with hit- and collision detection. If the low update rate is caused by a low frame rate (as opposed to a setting on the client, as some games allow), these problems are usually overshadowed by numerous problems related to the client- side processing itself. Both the display and controls will be sluggish and unresponsive. While this may increase the perceived lag, it is important to note that it is of a different kind than network-related delays. In comparison, the same problem on the server may cause significant problems for all clients involved. If the server is unable or unwilling to accept packets from clients fast enough and process these in a timely manner, client actions may never be registered. When the server then sends out updates to the clients, they may experience freezing (unresponsive game) and/or rollbacks, depending on what types of lag compensation, if any, the game uses. Lag due to network delay is, in contrast, often less of a problem. Though more common, the actual effects are generally smaller, and it is possible to compensate for these types of delays. Without any form of lag compensation, the clients will notice that the game responds only a short time after an action is performed. This is especially problematic in first-person shooters, where enemies are likely to move as a player attempts to shoot them and the margin for errors is often small.  Solutions and lag compensation  There are various methods for reducing or disguising delays, though many of these have their drawbacks and may not be applicable in all cases. If synchronization is not possible by the game itself, the clients may be able to choose to play on servers in geographical proximity to themselves in order to reduce latencies, or the servers may simply opt to drop clients with high latencies in order to avoid having to deal with the resulting problems. However, these are hardly optimal solutions. Instead, games will often be designed with lag compensation in mind. Many problems can be solved simply by allowing the clients to keep track of their own state and send absolute states to the server or directly to other clients. For example, the client can state exactly at what position a player's character is or who the character shot. This solution works and will all but eliminate most problems related to lag. Unfortunately, it also relies on the assumption that the client is honest. There is nothing that prevents a player from modifying the data they send, directly at the client or indirectly via a proxy, in order to ensure they will always hit their targets. In online games, the risk of cheating may make this solution unfeasible, and clients will be limited to sending relative states (i.e. which vector it moved on or shot in). = Client-side = As clients are normally not allowed to define the main game state, but rather receive it from the server, the main task of the client-side compensation is to render the virtual world as accurately as possible. As updates come with a delay and may even be dropped, it is sometimes necessary for the client to predict the flow of the game. Since the state is updated in discrete steps, the client must be able to estimate a movement based on available samples. Two basic methods can be used to accomplish this; extrapolation and interpolation. Extrapolation is an attempt to estimate a future game state. As soon as a packet from the server is received, the position of an object is updated to the new position. Awaiting the next update, the next position is extrapolated based on the current position and the movement at the time of the update. Essentially, the client will assume that a moving object will continue in the same direction. When a new packet is received, the position may be corrected slightly. Interpolation works by essentially buffering a game state and rendering the game state to the player with a slight, constant delay. When a packet from the server arrives, instead of updating the position of an object immediately, the client will start to interpolate the position, starting from the last known position. Over an interpolation interval, the object will be rendered moving smoothly between the two positions. Ideally, this interval should exactly match the delay between packets, but due to loss and variable delay, this is rarely the case. Both methods have advantages and drawbacks. * Interpolation ensures that objects will move between valid positions only and will produce good results with constant delay and no loss. Should dropped or out-of-order packets overflow the interpolation buffer the client will have to either freeze the object in position until a new packet arrives, or fall back on extrapolation instead. The downside of interpolation is that it causes the world to be rendered with additional latency, increasing the need for some form of lag compensation to be implemented. * The problem with extrapolating positions is fairly obvious: it is impossible to accurately predict the future. It will render movement correctly only if the movement is constant, but this will not always be the case. Players may change both speed and direction at random. This may result in a small amount of \\"warping\\" as new updates arrive and the estimated positions are corrected, and also cause problems for hit detection as players may be rendered in positions they are not actually in. Often, in order to allow smooth gameplay, the client is allowed to do soft changes to the game state. While the server may ultimately keep track of ammunition, health, position, etc., the client may be allowed to predict the new server- side game state based on the player's actions, such as allowing a player to start moving before the server has responded to the command. These changes will generally be accepted under normal conditions and make delay mostly transparent. Problems will arise only in the case of high delays or losses, when the client's predictions are very noticeably undone by the server. Sometimes, in the case of minor differences, the server may even allow \\"incorrect\\" changes to the state based on updates from the client. = Server- side = Unlike clients, the server knows the exact current game state, and as such prediction is unnecessary. The main purpose of server-side lag compensation is instead to provide accurate effects of client actions. This is important because by the time a player's command has arrived time will have moved on, and the world will no longer be in the state that the player saw when issuing their command. A very explicit example of this is hit detection for weapons fired in first-person shooters, where margins are small and can potentially cause significant problems if not properly handled.  Rewind time  Another way to address the issue is to store past game states for a certain length of time, then rewind player locations when processing a command. The server uses the latency of the player (including any inherent delay due to interpolation; see above) to rewind time by an appropriate amount in order to determine what the shooting client saw at the time the shot was fired. This will usually result in the server seeing the client firing at the target's old position and thus hitting. In the worst case, a player will be so far behind that the server runs out of historical data and they have to start leading their targets. This is a WYSIWYG solution that allows players to aim directly at what they are seeing. But the price is an aggravation of the effects of latency when a player is under fire: not only does their own latency play a part, but their attacker's too. In many situations, this is not noticeable, but players who have just taken cover will notice that they carry on receiving damage/death messages from the server for longer than their own latency can justify. This can lead more often to the (false) impression that they were shot through cover and the (not entirely inaccurate) impression of \\"laggy hitboxes\\". One design issue that arises from rewinding is whether to stop rewinding a dead player's lagged commands as soon as they die on the server, or to continue running them until they \\"catch up\\" to the time of death. Cutting compensation off immediately prevents victims from posthumously attacking their killers, which meets expectations, but preserves the natural advantage of moving players who round a corner, acquire a target and kill them in less time than a round trip to the stationary victim's client. Rewinding can be criticised for allowing the high latency of one player to negatively affect the experience of low-latency players. Servers with lag compensation will sometimes reduce the length of player history stored, or enforce ping limits, to reduce this problem.  Trust clients  It is possible for clients to tell the server what they are doing and for the server to trust the data it receives. This method is avoided if at all possible due to its susceptibility to cheating: it is a simple matter to route network data through a second computer which inserts fabricated hit messages or modifies existing ones, a technique which cannot be detected by anti-cheat tools. However, the sheer scale of some games makes computationally expensive solutions like rewinding impossible. In Battlefield 3, for example, a \\"hybrid hit detection\\" system is used where clients tell the server that they hit and the server performs only a vague test of plausibility before accepting the claim. Trusting a client's results otherwise has the same advantages and disadvantages as rewinding.  Make clients extrapolate  A less common lag solution is to do nothing on the server and to have each client extrapolate (see above) to cover its latency. This produces incorrect results unless remote players maintain a constant velocity, granting an advantage to those who dodge back and forth or simply start/stop moving. Extended extrapolation also results in remote players becoming visible (though not vulnerable) when they should not be: for example if a remote player sprints up to a corner then stops abruptly at the edge, other clients will render them sprinting onward, into the open, for the duration of their own latency. On the other side of this problem, clients have to give remote players who just started moving an extra burst of speed in order to push them into a theoretically-accurate predicted location. = Design = It is possible to reduce the perception of lag through game design. Techniques include playing client-side animations as if the action took place immediately, reducing/removing built-in timers on the host machine, and using camera transitions to hide warping.  Cloud gaming  Cloud gaming is a type of online gaming where the entire game is hosted on a game server in a data center, and the user is only running a thin client locally that forwards game controller actions upstream to the game server. The game server then renders the next frame of the game video which is compressed using low-lag video compression and is sent downstream and decompressed by the thin client. For the cloud gaming experience to be acceptable, the round-trip lag of all elements of the cloud gaming system (the thin client, the Internet and/or LAN connection the game server, the game execution on the game server, the video and audio compression and decompression, and the display of the video on a display device) must be low enough that the user perception is that the game is running locally. Because of such tight lag requirements, distance considerations of the speed of light through optical fiber come into play, currently limiting the distance between a user and a cloud gaming game server to approximately 1000 miles, according to OnLive, the only company thus far operating a cloud gaming service. There is also much controversy about the lag associated with cloud gaming. In multiplayer games using a client/server network architecture, the player's computer renders the game's graphics locally and only information about the player's in-game actions are sent to the server. For example, when the player presses a button, the character on- screen instantly performs the corresponding action. However, the consequences of the action such as an enemy being killed are only seen after a short delay due to the time taken for the action to reach the server. This is only acceptable as long as the response to the player's input is fast enough. When using cloud gaming, inputs by the player can lead to short delays until a response can be seen by them. Inputs must first be transmitted to the remote server, then the server must start rendering the graphics of the action being performed and stream the video back to the player over the network, taking additional time. Thus, the player experiences a noticeable delay between pressing a button and seeing something happen on-screen. Depending on the skill and experience of the player, this can cause disorientation and confusion similar to Delayed Auditory Feedback and hampers navigation and aiming in the game world. When rapidly inputting a long combination move, the on-screen character will not be synchronized with the button presses. This usually causes severe confusion in the player resulting in the failure of the combination move. The extra input lag can also make it very difficult to play certain single player games. For example, if an enemy takes a swing at the player and the player is expected to block, then by the time the player's screen shows that the enemy has commenced attacking, the enemy would have already struck and killed the player on the server.

As of 1 January 2020, it has a population of 12,926.BY3: Population 1 January, by urban areas The Mobile Statbank from Statistics Denmark Situated on the west side of the Hiller√∏d Motorway, between Farum Lake to the north and S√∏nders√∏ Lake to the south, it is surrounded by forest on three sides. Modern V√¶rl√∏se emerged around V√¶rl√∏se station in the 1950s. The original centre of the parish was the village of Kirke V√¶rl√∏se, located three kilometres to the west. The two communities have now almost merged. History The environs of V√¶rl√∏se in 1736 Kirke V√¶rl√∏se is mentioned in 1321‚Äì23 as Vetherl√∏sa makl√¶. The meaning of the name is unclear but it may be an old name for the lake S√∏nders√∏. The suffix -l√∏se means \\"area used for grazing in a clearing\\" (\\"gr√¶sgang i lysning\\"). The word makl√¶ (magle) means Freat (store). With the opening of the Slangerup Rail Line in 1906, Lille V√¶rl√∏se (\\"Little V√¶rl√∏se\\"), a smaller village three kilometres to the east, obtained a more favorable location. Its surroundings was redeveloped with summer houses in the 1940s. DSB took over the Slangerup Rail Line in 1945, shortening it with Farum as the new terminus in 1943. The rapid growth of Copenhagen's suburbs in the 1950s and 1960s also affected Lille V√¶rl√∏se, whose population quintupled between 1950 and 1970. The civil parish of V√¶rl√∏se formed the basis of V√¶rl√∏se Municipality which existed until 2006. It was merged January 1, 2007 with the former Farum Municipality to form Fures√∏ Municipality. Description V√¶rl√∏se has a small town centre with apartment buildings and a retail center surrounding V√¶rl√∏se station. Fures√∏ Town Hall is located just north of the station. The rest of the town mainly consists of single-family detached homes and terraced housing. Kirke V√¶rl√∏se and V√¶rl√∏se have now almost merged with the establishment of a business district in the western outskirts of V√¶rl√∏se.

Here the page offers many different languages. When an HTTP client (generally a web browser) requests a URL that points to a directory structure instead of an actual web page within the directory, the web server will generally serve a default page, which is often referred to as a main or \\"index\\" page. A common filename for such a page is \`index.html\`, but most modern HTTP servers offer a configurable list of filenames that the server can use as an index. If a server is configured to support server-side scripting, the list will usually include entries allowing dynamic content to be used as the index page (e.g. \`index.php\`, \`index.shtml\`, \`index.jsp\`, \`default.asp\`) even though it may be more appropriate to still specify the HTML output (\`index.html.php\` or \`index.html.aspx\`), as this should not be taken for granted. An example is the popular open source web server Apache, where the list of filenames is controlled by the DirectoryIndex directive in the main server configuration file or in the configuration file for that directory. It is possible to make do without file extensions at all, and be neutral to content delivery methods, and set the server to automatically pick the best file through content negotiation. If the server is unable to find a file with any of the names listed in its configuration, it may either return an error (generally 404 Not Found) or generate its own index page listing the files in the directory. It may also return a 403 Index Listing Forbidden. Usually this option is also configurable. History A scheme where web server serves a default file on per-subdirectory basis has been supported as early as NCSA HTTPd 0.3beta (22 April 1993), which defaults to serve \`index.html\` file in the directory. This scheme has been then adopted by CERN HTTPd since at least 2.17beta (5 April 1994), which its default supports \`Welcome.html\` and \`welcome.html\` in addition to the NCSA-originated \`index.html\`. All later web servers support this default file scheme in one form or another; usually configurable, with \`index.html\` being one of the default file names. Entrance Since the index page of website's root directory is often the first page of a Web site that a user sees, it is sometimes used to offer a menu of language options for large Web sites that use geo targeting. It is also possible to avoid this step, for example by using content negotiation.

Jijia Plain has altitudes of cca. 200m, lower than the surrounding Suceava Plateau, Dniester Hills, and B√¢rlad Plateau. The surrounding hills are characterized by deep gorges, and the term plains is employed to denote the fact that the area in-between the hill formations is visibly more lean and less slant. The natural vegetation of this area of smooth hills is silvosteppe (forest-steppe). Nowadays it is intensely farmed. Jijia River is a tributary to the river Prut. The region is a traditional agricultural area, favored by the black earth (earth with a very high natural fertility).

She was first introduced as the female protagonist and one of the main playable characters of the 2001 role-playing video game Final Fantasy X, appearing as a summoner embarking on a journey to defeat the world-threatening monster Sin alongside her companions, including the male protagonist Tidus. Yuna reappears in Final Fantasy X-2, where she becomes the protagonist, searching for a way to find Tidus two years following his disappearance. Yuna has also been featured in other Square Enix games, notably Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy. Yuna is one of several \\"leading lady\\" characters permeating many Final Fantasy player parties. She is preceded in this role by Rosa Farrell from Final Fantasy IV, Lenna Tycoon from Final Fantasy V, Terra Branford from Final Fantasy VI, Tifa Lockhart from Final Fantasy VII, Rinoa Heartilly from Final Fantasy VIII, and Garnet Til Alexandros XVII from Final Fantasy IX, and she is succeeded in the role by Ashelia B'nargin Dalmasca from Final Fantasy XII, Lightning from Final Fantasy XIII, and Lunafreya \\"Luna\\" Nox Fleuret from Final Fantasy XV (though in the case of the latter, she was a non-player, but nonetheless came the closest to filling the role). Tetsuya Nomura based Yuna's overall design on hakama, but also wanted to give her outfit something that would flow and so gave her a furisode. Nomura said that her name means \\"night\\" in the Okinawan language, which contrasts with Tidus' name, which is Okinawan for \\"sun\\". For Final Fantasy X-2, the game's staff wanted Tetsu Tsukamoto to redesign her costume to reflect her personality and the game's atmosphere. Yuna's character was well received by many media critics and fans and in particular praised for her relationship to Tidus, as well as her characterization and sex appeal. Despite this positive reception, there was a mixed reception for her role in Final Fantasy X-2 due to her redesign. Appearances In Final Fantasy X, Yuna is introduced as a summoner who can use healing magic and is able to summon powerful magical entities called aeons with help from spirits known as Fayths. Already known throughout Spira as the daughter of High Summoner Braska, who previously brought a brief respite from Sin's destruction ten years earlier, Yuna decides to embark on the summoner's pilgrimage to become a High Summoner herself. Yuna must journey to temples across the world, acquire the aeon from each and summon the Final Aeon in a battle that will kill them both. She gradually becomes more open and falls in love with Tidus. Upon arriving at the place where Yuna can summon the final aeon, Tidus persuades the group to look for another way to defeat Sin without using any sacrifices. After entering Sin's body, Yuna and her guardians defeat the disembodied spirit of Yu Yevon, who is responsible for reviving Sin after each defeat, allowing an eternal Calm to start in Spira. However, Tidus disappears as he is the product of the Fayth, who could not depart until Sin's defeat. In Final Fantasy X-2, set two years after Final Fantasy X, Yuna is a member of the sphere hunting group Gullwings, along with Rikku and Paine. In the game's international version, the Gullwings go their separate ways before the game's opening, with Yuna returning to Besaid Island. The trio then reunite to explore a tower. In X-2, Yuna journeys to Spira in search of the truth behind a sphere containing a video featuring a man resembling Tidus in prison. During her journey, Yuna discovers the man from the sphere was actually Shuyin, a spirit who wishes to destroy Spira in revenge for the death of his lover, Lenne. The Gullwings defeat Shuyin who departs to the afterlife with Lenne's spirit. Depending on the player's progress throughout the game, the Fayth may revive Tidus so that she can reunite with him. The HD Remastered version of the game adds a new audio drama where Yuna becomes a part of the group called Yevoners whose main temple is located on Besaid. In the story she breaks up with Tidus after telling him she loves somebody else before declaring she will fight Sin once again. She also appears in Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy, an action game that features several Final Fantasy characters, as one of the characters to be summoned by the goddess Cosmos to participate in a war against her rival, Chaos. For this game, Yuna appears in her Final Fantasy X form, but sightly arranged to fit with the game's cast. Additionally, she has an alternative design based on Yoshitaka Amano's illustration, and a wedding dress from Final Fantasy X. Her Final Fantasy X-2 regular form was made available as downloadable content. She also appears in Dissidia Final Fantasy NT as a warrior summoned by Cosmos's heir apparent, Materia, to take part in a war with her rival, Spiritus. However, Yuna is one of many characters summoned far away from the war and arrives well after its completion. Outside the Final Fantasy series, Yuna appears in Kingdom Hearts II as a pixie along with Paine and Rikku. Bribed by Maleficent into spying on Leon's group, the pixies eventually switch sides after being abandoned by the witch and told of Sora's cause. Yuna is also featured in the board game style video game Itadaki Street Special, appearing alongside Auron and Tidus, and represents Final Fantasy X in the rhythm game Theatrhythm Final Fantasy. Multiple figures and figurines of Yuna were produced by various manufacturers, including a 2001 figure by Square. A 2003 audio CD Final Fantasy X-2 Vocal Collections features performances by Mayuko Aoki, Marika Matsumoto and Megumi Toyoguchi, the voice actresses for Yuna, Rikku and Paine, respectively. Creation and development According to Tetsuya Nomura, he based Yuna's overall design on hakama, a type of traditional Japanese clothing. Nomura said that when he learned the character was to perform a dance called the \\"sending,\\" he wanted to give her outfit something that would flow. For this reason, the specific type of kimono he chose for her was a furisode, a long- sleeved kimono. Nomura also said that he adorned Yuna's dress and necklace with images of the hibiscus flower also called \\"yuna,\\" and that her name carries the meaning of \\"night\\" (Â§ï„Å™) in Okinawan, establishing a contrast between her and the lead male protagonist of Final Fantasy X, Tidus, whose Japanese name („ÉÜ„Ç£„Éº„ÉÄ) translates to \\"sun\\" (Â§™ÈôΩ) in Okinawan. This contrast is also represented in-game by items named for the sun and moon that empower Tidus' and Yuna's most powerful weapons. Nomura explains that while all these subtle details may be unneeded, he wanted his designs to have meaning behind them. Yuna's re-design for Final Fantasy X-2 The positive fan reaction to Final Fantasy X convinced the developers to continue the story of Yuna and other characters with Final Fantasy X-2. Costume designer Tetsu Tsukamoto said that the radical design changes for Yuna from one game to the other reflected a huge cultural change. Producer Yoshinori Kitase added that they did not want to make Final Fantasy X-2 feel like an extension of its predecessor, so they changed the clothing of Yuna, Rikku and others' to make them seem more active. This was accomplished before the story and setting were created. Because Yuna, Rikku and Paine live in a more care-free world, the designers wanted them to be able to dress up, a feature which became key to the gameplay. Scenario writer Kazushige Nojima described her new outfit as a \\"natural reaction to the heavy stuff she wore in FFX.\\" Yuna's singing performance was used to demonstrate the pop feel that the game incorporates. Final Fantasy X director Motomu Toriyama said her personality was the result of not having her bear the responsibility of being a summoner anymore. He added that while \\"she could be seen as a completely different person, ... deep in her heart, she is the same old Yuna.\\" In the Japanese versions of the games Yuna has been voiced by Mayuko Aoki. Hedy Burress provides the character's voice in the English adaptations of the game. In voicing Yuna, Burress remembers trying to translate Yuna's duty, respect and honor, but also wanting to retain the gentleness and femininity of her character. When commenting on how the audiences would react to Final Fantasy X, Burress said that she wanted them to participate in the game itself and to \\"transport them into a completely different world\\" through the voices. Reception Yuna received positive critical reception for her appearance in Final Fantasy X. Chris Reiter of Gaming Target ranked her as the third best \\"PlayStation 2 babe\\", describing her as \\"the star heroine whose soft features, kindness, and her unique story makes her one of the better beauties to love.\\"Chris Reiter, PlayStation 2: Heroes, Villains, Babes, and Bad Boys ‚Äì Part 2, Gaming Target, October 28, 2005. In 2008, Chip ranked her as the 13th top \\"girl of gaming\\". In 2012, Larry Hester of Complex ranked the original version of Yuna as the 20th \\"hottest\\" video game character yet. That same year, Heath Hooker of GameZone ranked Yuna the ninth top Final Fantasy character, calling her \\"one of the strongest female characters in the entire Final Fantasy franchise\\" and stating \\"the depth of character Yuna presents to the player is unfathomable and is one reason why she lands on this list.\\" In 2013, Complex editors Michael Rougeau and Gus Turner listed Yuna at number 21 on the list of the greatest heroines in video game history. ranked Yuna as the sixth greatest Final Fantasy character of all time. However, PSU.com retrospectively called Yuna an underrated character and stated that she was overlooked due to Auron and Rikku. GamesRadar listed Yuna as one of the 25 best new characters of the 2000s, describing the romance between her and Tidus as \\"legendary\\" and Yuna herself as compassionate, generous and dutiful. Yuna and Tidus were included on the list of \\"great loves\\" by Matthew Rorie of GameSpot in 2006, while AJ Glasser of GamesRadar in 2008 listed them as the second best Square Enix couple. Their kiss scene was declared as number two best in video games by Lisa Foiles of The Escapist, and Yuna's abortive wedding with Seymour was also ranked as the third memorable matrimony in the history of PlayStation by Official PlayStation Magazine in 2014.Official PlayStation Magazine UK 92 (January 2014), page 30. Yuna's design change in Final Fantasy X-2 received a mixed reception. Rob Wright of Tom's Hardware included her among the 50 greatest female characters in video game history. Jeremy Dunham of IGN praised the clothing designs, combining \\"proven and recognizable Final Fantasy styles\\" with a \\"revealing neo-modern fashion sense\\", referencing her warrior costume as a stand-out, and also said that English voice actress Hedy Burress' portrayal seemed more comfortable as opposed to the previous game. Brad Shoemaker of GameSpot praised Burress' voice acting, saying that it brought her fully to life in accordance with the other changes in the character. The book Packaging Girlhood: Rescuing Our Daughters from Marketers' Schemes described Yuna's appearance as being a \\"sexy MTV video star\\", adding that it is a \\"lesson to girls that being brave, strong, and ready to fight can only last so long ‚Äì the next adventure is fashion, boyfriends, and sex.\\" GameSpy's Raymond \\"Psylancer\\" Padilla called her \\"the video-game vixen of my dreams.\\" Christian Nutt, also of GameSpy, described Burress' portrayal of Yuna in X-2 as superb. Various publications compared Yuna to other fictional characters, including the Charlie's Angelss Natalie Cook as portrayed by Cameron Diaz; and Tomb Raider star Lara Croft, due to her attire and gun-wielding skills. In 2008, GameDaily listed the Final Fantasy X-2 incarnation of Yuna as one of the top 50 hottest video game women, praising her revealing outfit as well as her alternate costumes. That same year, she was ranked as the tenth on top Final Fantasy character by IGN, commenting that while her original appearance made her \\"fine eye-candy\\" and her sending scene was one of the best works by the CG studio Square Visual Works, it was the sequel that gave her more confidence and attitude, as well as \\"a gratuitously exploitative costume that ranks among the series' finest bits of fanboy-baiting.\\" The character also gained a significant and enduring popularity among the gamer public, especially in Japan. Readers of Game Informer voted Yuna's relationship with Tidus as the best of 2001. Yuna was voted the 10th most popular video game character in Japan in a 2008 Oricon poll, as well as 16th in a similar poll by Famitsu 2010. In a 2010 ASCII Media Works poll in which Japanese fans would vote whose video game or manga character would like to name their children after, Yuna came second in the female category. In official Square Enix polls, Yuna was voted the third most commonly favorite female Final Fantasy character in 2013 and the most popular Final Fantasy heroine in 2014.

Techniques involve destruction of property, by either using tools to disable or the use of arson to destroy what activists believe is being used to injure animals, people or the environment. These actions are sometimes called ecotage and there are marked differences between their actions in the United States and the United Kingdom. With many different reasons why ELF activists carry out economic sabotage, a communique to the press claiming the responsibility for arson against urban sprawl in December 2000, described the reason a cell took an action. As Elves usually do, they claimed that burning down the house was non-violent because it was searched for any living creatures; an issue which is much debated within the environmental movement.Best & Nocella 2006 p. 410 Some of the most common and notable attacks are against the development of multimillion-dollar houses, a frequent target in the ELF campaign. In a communique to the press from the group's \\"above-ground spokesperson\\", Craig Rosebraugh, that was later published in The Environmental Magazine, the group said in November 2000: =Press office= The North American Earth Liberation Front Press Office (NAELFPO or ELFPO) was relaunched in October 2008, receiving anonymous communiques from activists, for distributing to the press and public, to discuss the motives, ideologies and history behind such actions. Craig Rosebraugh served as an unofficial spokesperson for the ELF Press Office in North America from 1997 to early September 2001.Craig Subpoenaed to Federal Grand Jury in Eugene; ELF Investigation Continues, Portland Indymedia, February 15, 2006. Doubts have been raised about whether Rosebraugh or other unofficial spokespeople have ties to the cells involved, although the press office claim they do not know the identities of ELF members. =Support networks= Prisoner support networks support ELF prisoners, such as Spirit of Freedom (ELPSN), an English website listing all Earth Liberation prisoners, as well as a variety of other prisoners of conscience. There are also ELF support networks in Belgium, Italy, North America, and Poland, which collectively coordinate the support of prisoners, as well as websites for specific prisoners, such as for; Rod Coronado, Jeff \\"Free\\" Luers, Daniel McGowan, Briana Waters and Tre Arrow. Prisoner support websites include: *Support Rod Coronado *Free Free Now (Jeff Luers) *Support For Daniel McGowan *Support Eric McDavid *Free Tre Arrow *Support Briana Waters The networks distribute literature written by those in prison, to their supporters and other support groups, and sometimes raise funds for those who require financial aid in their cases.About: Spirit of Freedom , Earth Liberation Prisoners Support Network. =Philosophy= Earth liberationists, are a diverse group of individuals with a variety of different ideologies and theories. These include; animal liberationists, anti-capitalists, green anarchists, deep ecologists, eco-feminists, and anti-globalisationists.Manes, Christopher, 1990. Green Rage: Radical Environmentalism and the Unmaking of Civilization, Boston: Little, Brown and Co. Elves argue that direct action is required to aid the earth liberation movement, also referred to as eco- resistance movement, and a part of the radical environmental movement. The ELF claim that it would be similar to how the ALF has projected forward the animal liberation movement. There was also the intention that in the same way animal liberationists \\"help out\\" with legal campaigns, earth liberationists would aid above-ground environmental organizations, notably Earth First!, by acts of ecotage.Best & Nocella 2006 p. 50 & 51. Origin =United Kingdom= The symbol of Earth First!: a monkey wrench and stone hammer. The Earth Liberation Front was founded in 1992 in Brighton, England by members of the Earth First! (EF!) environmental movement at the first-ever national meeting. At the time, EF! had become very popular, so people's concerns were based on maintaining this popularity and by doing so not associating with overt law-breaking. There was no universal agreement over this, but it was accepted amongst the movement that British EF! would instead continue to advocate and focus on civil disobedience and mass demonstrations. If people wanted to participate in acts of ecotage, the new name \\"Earth Liberation Front\\" would be used, with its name and guidelines derived from the Animal Liberation Front (ALF), another movement that uses direct action to liberate animals or sabotage companies using them. It was understood that the simplicity of the guidelines was a crucial factor to engage as many people as possible to the new cause, with the intention that the ELF would quickly become as popular as the ALF.FIRE , Greenfield. Earth Night The very first ELF action is unknown, or undocumented, but one of the first and most notable actions was on April Fool's Earth Night 1992, a night organized by activists to carry out ecotage and also one of the first of them. The Elves, as they were also known, targeted Fisons, a peat company accused of destroying the peat bogs causing ¬£50,000‚Äì70,000 worth of damage. Pumps, trucks and other machinery belonging to the company were destroyed after legal campaigners, Friends of the Earth, spent two years advocating a boycott of the company. Green Anarchist magazine publicized the communique with the demands from the ELF:Best & Nocella 2006 p. 51-52 EF! Journal In the September‚ÄìOctober 1993 issue of the Earth First! Journal, an anonymous article announced the creation of the ELF in England. It said the ELF is a movement of independently operating eco- saboteurs that split from the British EF! movement, which has focused directly on public direct actions. The author noted that unlike the ALF which seeks publicity: \\"ELF cells, for security reasons, work without informing the press and do not claim responsibility for actions.\\" Development of the ELF abroad =Europe= The ELF quickly spread across to Europe by 1994, with actions first occurring in the Netherlands, Germany, Russia, Scandinavia, New Zealand, Italy, Ireland, Poland, Spain, France and Finland, and the name starting to be used across the globe.ELF actions have been reported in; Australia, Canada, Colombia, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Poland, Russia, Scandinavia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom and the United States.Best & Nocella 2006 p. 19, 52 & 53 The Earth Liberation Front is widely regarded as the Animal Liberation Front's younger sibling, because of the relationship and cooperation between the two movements. It is believed that cells rapidly established themselves in new countries because of the global outreach of Earth First! and the connection between the two groups.Best & Nocella 2006 p. 47. British Elves were also making contact with like-minded activists, informing them about the ELF and its tactics, with missionaries targeting specifically France, Spain, Germany, and the Netherlands. Within two years, McDonald's had been vandalized in Germany and Poland, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol had been sabotaged, and high- emission vehicles had been destroyed. Hunting towers were torn down in the Netherlands and Germany, which was presumably inspired by similar actions against hunting by the ALF.Best & Nocella 2006 p. 52. =North America= Canadian ELA The first time it was known that an earth liberation action had happened in North America, was in 1995, in Canada, by a group calling itself the Earth Liberation Army (ELA).Globe and Mail, Toronto, 12 July 1995. They were considered by the European Elves at the time to be \\"transatlantic cousins\\". On 19 June 1995, the ELA burned down a wildlife museum and damaged a hunting lodge in British Columbia.Best & Nocella 2006 p. 55. United States On Columbus Day 1996, activists spraypainted \\"504 years of genocide\\" and \\"ELF\\" on the walls of a public relations office, as well as a McDonald's restaurant in Oregon, the actions were the very first by the ELF in the United States. The same restaurant then had its locks glued and spraypainted again, but this time in support of the British McLibel Two, two activists who had distributed anti-McDonald's leaflets. The next day, it was reported that another two McDonald's restaurants, again in Oregon, had their locks glued by ELF activists.Best & Nocella 2006 p. 55Diary of Actions of the Earth Liberation Front 1996‚Äì2001 , reposted by Portland Indymedia. The only other reported action of the year was on Christmas Day, when a fur farm was raided in Michigan and 150 mink released into the wild by the Great Lakes ELF.Best & Nocella 2006 p. 56. The Fox, a Chicago area Fox River environmental activist, began ELF style operations in the early 1970s and continued into the 1980s, while the peak number of ELF actions occurred in early 1990s. ELF activities declined in the United States after 2003, and by 2012 there were next to none. Mexico In late November 2008, a group calling itself Eco-Anarquista Por El Ataque Directo (Eco-anarchist cell supporting direct attack) claimed responsibility for several recent actions, including half a dozen Molotov cocktails thrown at tren f√©rreo (metro rail) in Mexico City, incendiary sabotage against Telmex, and a Molotov cocktail thrown at a Banamex ATM. The group claimed that these attacks were a form of protest against the construction of a new rail line (line 12), in Mexico City (D.F.) and Mexico State. The construction had caused deforestation and the eviction of many families. Soon after this initial group of actions, the Frente de Liberaci√≥n de la Tierra (Earth Liberation Front) claimed responsibility for a number of actions including the sabotage of a construction machine on December 30, 2008, arson at the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico (UNAM) and the March 22nd, 2009 burning of construction equipment in Guadalajara, Jalisco. =South America= Argentina Over the first months of 2012, several car arson cases in Buenos Aires were claimed by the \\"Frente de Liberacion de la Tierra\\", stating that \\"... we propose to destroy property from the bourgeoise class from Palermo to Villa Devoto who are sure that everything will stay the same, but some individuals are tired of this and pretend to continue with this initiative to expand the daily riots...\\" Notable attacks: 1998‚Äì2009 =1996‚Äì1999= The ELF gained state attention in the state of Oregon in 1996 when they burned down the Oakridge Ranger Station. The ELF gained national attention for a series of actions which earned them the label of eco- terrorists, and one of the top domestic terror threats in the United States.Earth Liberation Front is now FBI's No. 1: Mainstream media finally pick up on the concern of ecoterrorism, Property Rights Foundation of America, Inc, March 2001. This came after the burning of a ski resort in Vail, Colorado, on October 19, costing $12 million.Eco-Terror Incictments: 'Operation Backfire' Nets 11 , FBI, 20 January 2006. In a communique to the press, the ELF said: Actions also included sabotaging power lines, the burning of an SUV dealership, and the burning down of a logging headquarters causing $1 million in damages. The Elves wrote to the local paper \\"Let this be a lesson to all greedy multinational corporations who don't respect their ecosystems,\\" with most actions taking place in Oregon. The defendants in the case were later charged in the FBI's \\"Operation Backfire\\", which included 17 acts of property destruction.Defendants plead guilty in Operation Backfire case , FBI, November 9, 2006. The ELF then set fire to Michigan State University on New Year's Eve, using a gasoline bomb to cause $1.1 million in damages, because of a program to provide GMO plants to African farmers. ELF spokesmen claimed Monsanto had been a major contributor to funding the program; however, the only funding from Monsanto Corp. was a one-time sum of $2,000 to send five African students to a conference on biotechnology. The next day, commercial logging equipment was set on fire, with \\"ELF\\" and \\"Go Log in Hell\\" spraypainted on a truck. In March 2008, four activists were charged for both the arsons.4 linked to radical group indicted in MSU arson, Detroit Free Press, March 11, 2008. =2000= On November 27, in Colorado, the ELF burned the Legend Ridge mansion and sent a message to the Boulder Weekly saying \\"Viva la revolution!\\" Damages were estimated at $2.5 million.ELF , Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise. =2001= In March, a total of thirty SUVs were torched, belonging to Joe Romania's dealership, in Oregon, with damages estimated at $1 million. The action was claimed in support of Jeff \\"Free\\" Luers, who targeted the very same dealership and was in court for the charges at the time. He was then sentenced to twenty-two years in jail, later revised to ten. On May 21, a fire destroyed laboratories, offices, and archives at the Center for Urban Horticulture, University of Washington, causing a total of $7 million in damages. The arson destroyed 20 years of research and plant and book collections. The ELF claimed responsibility based upon the incorrect belief that the University was involved in genetic engineering of poplar trees.ELF members gained nothing by the UW arson, and so much was lost , Crosscut.com, May 30, 2008, No genetic engineering was being conducted. In the wake of the attack, an FBI spokeswoman in Portland, Oregon said \\"I don't think there's any doubt the ELF is upping the ante\\".Earth Liberation Front, stepping up arson campaign , Associated Press, June 2, 2001. On November 21, ELF member Ian Wallace planted incendiary devices outside of two buildings on the campus of Michigan Technological University in Houghton, Michigan during the early morning hours. The devices failed, and on March 21, 2009, Wallace was sentenced to three years in prison for the incident by Judge Robert Holmes Bell, who said Wallace \\"didn't intend to hurt anybody, (but) this is a serious offense.\\" Said Wallace after his conviction, \\"I have been consumed by shame for what I have done,\\" Wallace said. \\"My greatest blessing is that no one got hurt.\\" =2003= On January 1, in Girard, Pennsylvania, jugs of gasoline were set under three vehicles at Bob Ferrando Ford Lincoln Mercury and set ablaze. Two pickup trucks, one Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) and a car were destroyed causing $90,000 in damages. Steve Dartnell of Fairview claimed responsibility for the attack. On August 1, a 206-unit condominium in San Diego was destroyed, with a banner left at the scene saying \\"If you build it, we will burn it\\", signed \\"The E.L.F.s are mad\\". The damages totaled $20 million after flames reached an estimated in the air, as over a hundred firefighters attempted to put out the fire. The destruction was the movement's most financially damaging action against a target, with a local preservation group calling the action pointless, noting that \\"You can go and burn something down, but it's just going to get built again.\\"Militant group suspected of torching condo project , Sign On San Diego, August 2, 2003. Exactly three weeks later, 125 SUVs and hummers were torched in Los Angeles costing a total of $3.5 million, with \\"I love pollution\\" spray-painted at the scene,Eco protesters and US anti-terror law, The Guardian, March 2, 2005. and a month later, homes being built in San Diego were targeted again, this time costing an estimated $450,000 in damages.Unfinished homes destroyed; banners point to militant environmental group ELF , Sign on San Diego, September 20, 2003. =2006= The FBI's most recent report stated that there had been over 1,200 \\"criminal incidents\\", within January 2006. A nearly completed house, worth $3 million, was burnt to the ground in Washington. It was reported that a bed-sheet was draped across the front gate, with a message reading \\"Built Green? Nope black. McMansions and RCDs r not green,\\" a reference to rural cluster developments. =2008= One of the latest ELF arsons was reported on the morning of March 3, when explosive devices set fire to four multimillion- dollar homes from the 2007 Seattle Street of Dreams in Echo Lake, Washington, causing $7 million in damage.Luxury Homes Burn in Apparent Eco-Attack, Associated Press, March 3, 2008. Authorities described the act as \\"domestic terrorism\\" after finding \\"ELF\\" spray-painted in red letters, mocking claims that the homes were environmentally friendly: \\"Built Green? Nope black! McMansions in RCDs r not green. ELF.\\"'Street of Dreams' homes torched; eco- terrorists suspected, Seattle pi, March 3, 2008. =2009= On March 23, the ELF claimed the burning of an excavator in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico. In one of many recent anonymous communiques, the ELF reported to Bite Back; \\"Maybe we have not collapsed the system of domination with these actions, but it begins with actions like these.\\"Bite Back, March 23, 2009 On September 4, ELF claimed responsibility for using a stolen excavator to overturn two AM radio towers belonging to the station KRKO near Seattle, Washington; they claimed that radio waves are dangerous. A Texas man was arrested after construction workers found a disabled construction vehicle graffitied with the words \\"ANOTHER TRACTOR DECOMMISSIONED BY THE E.L.F.\\" =Other movements= ELA and Environmental Rangers The first major report of a name other than ELF being used to claim ecotage was in October 1998, when the Earth Liberation Army (ELA) claimed to be responsible for causing $12 million in damages to Vail Ski Resort by setting fire to several buildings and four chairlifts.Waste & abuse ‚Äì the controversy over a temporary dirt road built by Vail Resorts and its effect on wetlands, BNet, September 27, 1999. Two years later, in Oregon, three SUVs were destroyed by placing jugs of gasoline under the vehicles, with the ELA calling for others to \\"[c]ontinue the fight to remove the profit motive from the killing of the environment (biophysical).\\" Jeff Luers was later convicted of arson, as part of the Operation Backfire case, along with other ALF and ELF defendants.Resentencing date set for Jeff Luers, Freedom4um, 29 December 2007. There have also been other groups that have caused similar damage as the ELF, within 2001 reports that \\"eco- terrorist\\" attacks, known as \\"ecotage\\", had increased. These included the ELF, the ELA, and another name being used ‚Äì the \\"Environmental Rangers\\" who use similar tactics.The eco-terrorist anthrax connection, ESR, October 21, 2001. Activists have also used the names \\"The Moles\\", \\"The Grey Wolves\\", \\"Westcountry Wildlife Cell\\", \\"Eco-Animal Defense Unit\\", and \\"Radical Brigades for Ecological Defence\\", as well as others.Best & Nocella 2006 p. 52-56. Environmental Life Force The Environmental Life Force, also known as the Original ELF, was the first radical group to use explosive and incendiary devices to promote pro-environment causes. It was founded by John Hanna, who was the only member of the group to be arrested and convicted for the use of explosives on federal property. Although it was an eco-guerilla entity with similar philosophies to the current ELF (Earth Liberation Front), which formed fifteen years later, there was no formal link between the two groups, and founders of the Earth Liberation Front may not have even been aware of the existence of the Environmental Life Force. Despite this, it has acknowledged in written communications that Dave Foreman, who founded Earth First! three years after the original ELF, was in communication with Hanna in the mid-1980s, before the Earth Liberation Front was founded, which was after Foreman cut ties with the Earth First! movement.ELF Archives, Original ELF. Police response, and convictions =First ELF arrest= In 1994, Dutch authorities and police made claims that British ELF activists were traveling abroad to cause sabotage, which was disputed by ELF. Later that year the first Earth Liberation Prisoner (ELP) was caught and later charged. Known as Paul S., he was arrested and accused of carrying out an 18-month campaign of vandalism in the Netherlands against road construction sites. The Dutch government attempted to declare him insane, because of his inability to provide a political reason for his actions, other than his care for the environment. This was unsuccessful and the prisoner was sentenced to three years for damaging property =British police raids= Due to the increased popularity of the environmental movement, as well as the animal liberation movement and estimates that five ALF actions occurred per day, police carried out a series of raids against animal rights and environmental activists. In total, there were 55 homes raided against suspected ALF and ELF activists, including an individual in Italy. The police had not managed to charge anyone with any illegal activities, until on January 16, 1996, when six men were charged for a five-year ALF/ELF campaign. They were sentenced a year later each to three years for conspiracy to incite violence in the name of animal and earth liberation.Best & Nocella 2006 p. 52 & 53 =Operation Backfire= Daniel G. McGowan was charged for two counts of arson and conspiracy in the FBI's \\"Operation Backfire\\". He pleaded guilty to avoid a life sentence, without testifying against his co-defendants, some of whom had done so against him. The term Green Scare, alluding to the Red Scares, periods of fear over communist infiltration of U.S. society, is a term popularized by environmental activists to refer to legal action by the U.S. government against the radical environmentalist movement. It is first known to have appeared in 2002 in the wake of the February 12 congressional hearings titled \\"The Threat of Eco- Terrorism\\" which discussed groups including the Earth Liberation Front (ELF) and the Animal Liberation Front (ALF). In late 2005 and early 2006, as part of Operation Backfire, US grand juries indicted a total of 18 activists on a range of charges related to \\"violent acts in the name of animal rights and environmental causes\\".Operation Backfire Press Conference , FBI, January 20, 2006. According to the FBI, many of these acts were carried out on behalf of the ELF and was considered as one of the largest arrests of environmental activists in American history. The operation resulted in the arrest of Chelsea Dawn Gerlach, William C. Rodgers, and Daniel McGowan. In 2008, the FBI increased the reward for handing over four suspects to $50,000. The four, two Americans and two Canadians, are believed to have fled the U.S. through Mexico and are possibly hiding in Syria, Russia, China or India. The announcement of an increased manhunt came on the tenth anniversary of the bombing in Vail. A 2011 NPR report claimed some of the people associated with this group were imprisoned in a highly restrictive Communication management unit. Data & Graphics: Population Of The Communications Management Units, Margot Williams and Alyson Hurt, NPR, 3-3-11, retrieved 2011 03 04 from npr.org Cooperation with the ALF =Philosophy= *Radical environmentalists consider the ELF to be the environmental wing of the Animal Liberation Front, effectively acting as the Eco-ALF. Evidence of this include names used such as the \\"Westcountry Wildlife Cell\\" and then later \\"ALF: Eco-Animal Defense Unit\\". *The ELF is also considered to be the ALF's younger sister,Updates from the Frontlines: ALF and ELF , San Diego Indymedia, January 10, 2003. forming 16 years later and due to the fact that the guidelines, as well as the name itself, were derived from the movement. *Despite the movements only forming alliances in 1996/1997, activists such as Rod Coronado were known to be active in both the ALF and ELF dating back before the names were officially used together.Toni Bartone. Total Liberation in Erie , Thomas Merton Center. Noel Molland, a former ELF activist, writes in Steven Best's Igniting a Revolution that: =History= During the mid-1990s, the Western Wildlife Unit, an ELF branch in Britain, was responsible for various acts of animal rights themed violence. The vandalism included spiking trees as well as targeting anglers. However, it wasn't until sometime later, in the United States, that a joint claim of responsibility was made. Molland also writes that the first established ALF and ELF action was established on March 14, 1997, when the \\" Animal Liberation Front ‚Äì Eco-Animal Defense Unit\\" claimed the spiking of 47 trees in a clearcut area, Oregon. This was only a few months after the fur farm had been raided by the Great Lakes ELF, which also highlighted the overlap in direct action for animal rights and environmentalism. The group intended to state that the farm they had raided was a joint effort between members of the Animal and Earth Liberation Front. Five days later, the \\"Bay Area Cell of the Earth and Animal Liberation Front\\" claimed the firebombing of the University of California, an animal research laboratory that was still under construction at the time. Also later that year, on November 29, there was another joint ALF & ELF claim, this time releasing 500 wild horses and torching the Bureau of Land Management in Burns, in protest of BLM's intention to round up the wild horses and process them for the sale of horsemeat.Best & Nocella 2006 p. 56 However, this claim contradicts the Southern Poverty Law Center, which states that the first incident of cooperation between the two movements was 6 months before these events on October 27, 1996, when the ALF & ELF were both responsible for firebombing a Forest Service truck in Detroit, Oregon. Then three days later both groups claimed the arson at the U.S. Forest Service Oakridge Ranger Station, at the cost of $5.3 million. It was then reported that a week before the Bay Area cells fur farm raid, on March 11, 1997, four trucks were torched, at the Agricultural Fur Breeders Co-Op. The damage totaled $1 million and the action was again claimed by the ALF & ELF.Eco-Violence: The Record, Southern Poverty Law Center. As the ELF was becoming well established through its actions, on 21 June 1998, the United States Forest Service wildlife research center near Olympia, Washington was set on fire with \\"Eco-Defense\\" and \\"Earth Liberation\\" spray-painted on construction machinery, which had received extensive damage in New Jersey on the 2nd Feb. Both the actions were claimed jointly by the ALF & ELF and were estimated to have caused one of the worst damages yet, estimated at $1.9 million. The same claim was made when 310 animals were taken from a fur farm involved in experimental research-based in Madison, Wisconsin, which were stolen on the 3rd of July.Earth Liberation Front Timeline (Where did the website go?) , Portland Indymedia, 1992‚Äì2001.Best & Nocella 2006 p. 57. =Actions= : Timeline of Animal Liberation Front actions: 2000‚Äì2004 and 2005‚ÄìPresent A fire by an ALF cell; the Oxford Arson Squad, causing ¬£500,000 in damages to Londbridges boathouse, Oxfordshire on 4 July 2005. Actions claimed by both the ALF and ELF jointly have appeared across the globe, nearly as much as the ELF has, causing more activists from the ALF and other movements to become involved; believing in \\"No Compromise in Defence of Mother Earth\\", a popular Earth First! the slogan used and populated in the 1980s.No Compromise in Defence of Mother Earth\\", Earth First!. Despite this, in comparison to the ALF, there have been few communiques in recent years that have been released to the media or ELF Press Offices. This is largely due to the style of the ELF, who are much less likely to report their actions, or even leave a message to notify their targets regarding why they have been attacked. Although ALF and ELF combined actions have continued,Bite Back Archive, See ELF. one of the latest string of jointly claimed arsonsBite Back Archives, See 2002/2003 for ALF/ELF. was publicised was in November 2002, when activists sent a communique to Bite Back and also the ELF Press Office, claiming responsibility for the arson at Mindek Brothers Fur Farm.

In nature, strange matter is hypothesized to occur in the core of neutron stars, or, more speculatively, as isolated droplets that may vary in size from femtometers (strangelets) to kilometers, as in the hypothetical strange stars. At high enough density, strange matter is expected to be color superconducting. Ordinary matter, also referred to as atomic matter, is composed of atoms, with nearly all matter concentrated in the atomic nuclei. The nuclear matter is a liquid composed of neutrons and protons, and they are themselves composed of up and down quarks. Quark matter is a condensed form of matter composed entirely of quarks. If quark matter contains strange quarks, it is often called strange matter (or strange quark matter), and when quark matter does not contain strange quarks, it is sometimes referred to as non- strange quark matter.  Definition  In particle physics and astrophysics, the term is used in two ways, one broader and the other more specific. # The broader meaning is simply quark matter that contains three types of quarks: up, down, and strange. In this definition, there is a critical pressure and an associated critical density, and when nuclear matter (made of protons and neutrons) is compressed beyond this density, the protons and neutrons dissociate into quarks, yielding quark matter (probably strange matter). # The narrower meaning is that quark matter is more stable than nuclear matter, i.e. that the true ground state of matter is quark matter. The idea that this could happen is the \\"strange matter hypothesis\\" of Bodmer and Witten. In this definition, the critical pressure is zero. The nuclei that we see in the matter around us, which are droplets of nuclear matter, are actually metastable, and given enough time (or the right external stimulus) would decay into droplets of strange matter, i.e. strangelets.  Strange matter that is only stable at high pressure  Under the broader definition, strange matter might occur inside neutron stars, if the pressure at their core is high enough (i.e. above the critical pressure). At the sort of densities and high pressures we expect in the center of a neutron star, the quark matter would probably be strange matter. It could conceivably be non-strange quark matter, if the effective mass of the strange quark were too high. Charm quarks and heavier quarks would only occur at much higher densities. A neutron star with a quark matter core is often called a hybrid star. However, it is hard to know whether hybrid stars really exist in nature because physicists currently have little idea of the likely value of the critical pressure or density. It seems plausible that the transition to quark matter will already have occurred when the separation between the nucleons becomes much smaller than their size, so the critical density must be less than about 100 times nuclear saturation density. But a more precise estimate is not yet available, because the strong interaction that governs the behavior of quarks is mathematically intractable, and numerical calculations using lattice QCD are currently blocked by the fermion sign problem. One major area of activity in neutron star physics is the attempt to find observable signatures by which we could tell, from earth based observations of neutron stars, whether they have quark matter (probably strange matter) in their core.  Strange matter that is stable at zero pressure  If the \\"strange matter hypothesis\\" is true then nuclear matter is metastable against decaying into strange matter. The lifetime for spontaneous decay is very long, so we do not see this decay process happening around us. However, under this hypothesis there should be strange matter in the universe: # Quark stars (often called \\"strange stars\\") consist of quark matter from their core to their surface. They would be several kilometers across, and may have a very thin crust of nuclear matter. # Strangelets are small pieces of strange matter, perhaps as small as nuclei. They would be produced when strange stars are formed or collide, or when a nucleus decays.

He played firstly as a scrum-half, and later in his career (with more success) at fly half. Career Mazzariol first played at Benetton Treviso, where he became a professional for the season of 1995/96. He would play for his home team until 2002/03, then moving to Gran Parma Rugby, where he played until 2009/10, when he finished his career. The Italian fly half then signed for Rugby Parma F.C. at 2005/06, where he still plays. Mazzariol played in the 2006 Heineken Cup play-off game against the Dragons kicking 11 vital points in a 24-16 victory. He won for Benetton Rugby Treviso 5 titles of the Italian Champiopnship, in 1996/97, 1997/98, 1998/99, 2000/01 and 2002/03, and the Cup of Italy, in 1998. He won for Rugby Parma F.C. the Cup of Italy, in 2007 and 2008. Mazzariol holds 33 caps for Italy, from 1995 to 2004, having scored 2 tries, 13 conversions and 15 penalties, 81 points in aggregate. He did not have more caps mostly due to the strong opposition from Alessandro Troncon. He was a member of the Italian Squad at the 1995 Rugby World Cup finals, but his first match was only at 14 October 1995, in a 34-22 loss to France. He played at both the 1999 Rugby World Cup finals and the 2003 Rugby World Cup finals. His only presence at Six Nations was in 2002.

The adjective real in this context was introduced in the 17th century by Ren√© Descartes, who distinguished between real and imaginary roots of polynomials. The real numbers include all the rational numbers, such as the integer ‚àí5 and the fraction 4/3, and all the irrational numbers, such as (1.41421356..., the square root of 2, an irrational algebraic number). Included within the irrationals are the transcendental numbers, such as (3.14159265...). In addition to measuring distance, real numbers can be used to measure quantities such as time, mass, energy, velocity, and many more. The set of real numbers is denoted using the symbol R or \\\\mathbb{R}. Real numbers can be thought of as points on an infinitely long line called the number line or real line, where the points corresponding to integers are equally spaced. Any real number can be determined by a possibly infinite decimal representation, such as that of 8.632, where each consecutive digit is measured in units one tenth the size of the previous one. The real line can be thought of as a part of the complex plane, and the real numbers can be thought of as a part of the complex numbers. Real numbers can be thought of as points on an infinitely long number line These descriptions of the real numbers are not sufficiently rigorous by the modern standards of pure mathematics. The discovery of a suitably rigorous definition of the real numbers‚Äîindeed, the realization that a better definition was needed‚Äîwas one of the most important developments of 19th-century mathematics. The current standard axiomatic definition is that real numbers form the unique Dedekind-complete ordered field up to an isomorphism, whereas popular constructive definitions of real numbers include declaring them as equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences (of rational numbers), Dedekind cuts, or infinite decimal representations, together with precise interpretations for the arithmetic operations and the order relation. All these definitions satisfy the axiomatic definition and are thus equivalent. The set of all real numbers is uncountable, in the sense that while both the set of all natural numbers and the set of all real numbers are infinite sets, there can be no one-to-one function from the real numbers to the natural numbers. In fact, the cardinality of the set of all real numbers, denoted by \\\\mathfrak c and called the cardinality of the continuum, is strictly greater than the cardinality of the set of all natural numbers (denoted \\\\aleph_0, 'aleph-naught'). The statement that there is no subset of the reals with cardinality strictly greater than \\\\aleph_0 and strictly smaller than \\\\mathfrak c is known as the continuum hypothesis (CH). It is known to be neither provable nor refutable using the axioms of Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory including the axiom of choice (ZFC)‚Äîthe standard foundation of modern mathematics. In fact, some models of ZFC satisfy CH, while others violate it.  History  Real numbers (‚Ñù) include the rational numbers (‚Ñö), which include the integers (‚Ñ§), which in turn include the natural numbers (‚Ñï) Simple fractions were used by the Egyptians around 1000 BC; the Vedic \\"Shulba Sutras\\" (\\"The rules of chords\\") in, , include what may be the first \\"use\\" of irrational numbers. The concept of irrationality was implicitly accepted by early Indian mathematicians such as Manava , who were aware that the square roots of certain numbers, such as 2 and 61, could not be exactly determined.T. K. Puttaswamy, \\"The Accomplishments of Ancient Indian Mathematicians\\", pp. 410‚Äì11. In: . Around 500 BC, the Greek mathematicians led by Pythagoras realized the need for irrational numbers, in particular the irrationality of the square root of 2. The Middle Ages brought about the acceptance of zero, negative numbers, integers, and fractional numbers, first by Indian and Chinese mathematicians, and then by Arabic mathematicians, who were also the first to treat irrational numbers as algebraic objects (the latter being made possible by the development of algebra). Arabic mathematicians merged the concepts of \\"number\\" and \\"magnitude\\" into a more general idea of real numbers. The Egyptian mathematician Ab≈´ KƒÅmil ShujƒÅ ibn Aslam was the first to accept irrational numbers as solutions to quadratic equations, or as coefficients in an equation (often in the form of square roots, cube roots and fourth roots).Jacques Sesiano, \\"Islamic mathematics\\", p. 148, in In the 16th century, Simon Stevin created the basis for modern decimal notation, and insisted that there is no difference between rational and irrational numbers in this regard. In the 17th century, Descartes introduced the term \\"real\\" to describe roots of a polynomial, distinguishing them from \\"imaginary\\" ones. In the 18th and 19th centuries, there was much work on irrational and transcendental numbers. Johann Heinrich Lambert (1761) gave the first flawed proof that cannot be rational; Adrien-Marie Legendre (1794) completed the proof,. and showed that is not the square root of a rational number.. Paolo Ruffini (1799) and Niels Henrik Abel (1842) both constructed proofs of the Abel‚ÄìRuffini theorem: that the general quintic or higher equations cannot be solved by a general formula involving only arithmetical operations and roots. √âvariste Galois (1832) developed techniques for determining whether a given equation could be solved by radicals, which gave rise to the field of Galois theory. Joseph Liouville (1840) showed that neither e nor e2 can be a root of an integer quadratic equation, and then established the existence of transcendental numbers; Georg Cantor (1873) extended and greatly simplified this proof. Charles Hermite (1873) first proved that e is transcendental, and Ferdinand von Lindemann (1882), showed that is transcendental. Lindemann's proof was much simplified by Weierstrass (1885), still further by David Hilbert (1893), and has finally been made elementary by Adolf Hurwitz and Paul Gordan. The development of calculus in the 18th century used the entire set of real numbers without having defined them rigorously. The first rigorous definition was published by Georg Cantor in 1871. In 1874, he showed that the set of all real numbers is uncountably infinite, but the set of all algebraic numbers is countably infinite. Contrary to widely held beliefs, his first method was not his famous diagonal argument, which he published in 1891. For more, see Cantor's first uncountability proof.  Definition  The real number system (\\\\mathbf{R} ; {}+{} ; {}\\\\cdot{} ; {}<{}) can be defined axiomatically up to an isomorphism, which is described hereafter. There are also many ways to construct \\"the\\" real number system, and a popular approach involves starting from natural numbers, then defining rational numbers algebraically, and finally defining real numbers as equivalence classes of their Cauchy sequences or as Dedekind cuts, which are certain subsets of rational numbers. Another approach is to start from some rigorous axiomatization of Euclidean geometry (say of Hilbert or of Tarski), and then define the real number system geometrically. All these constructions of the real numbers have been shown to be equivalent, in the sense that the resulting number systems are isomorphic. = Axiomatic approach = Let R denote the set of all real numbers, then: * The set R is a field, meaning that addition and multiplication are defined and have the usual properties. * The field R is ordered, meaning that there is a total order ‚â• such that for all real numbers x, y and z: ** if x ‚â• y, then x + z ‚â• y + z; ** if x ‚â• 0 and y ‚â• 0, then xy ‚â• 0. * The order is Dedekind-complete, meaning that every non-empty subset S of R with an upper bound in R has a least upper bound (a.k.a., supremum) in R. The last property is what differentiates the reals from the rationals (and from other more exotic ordered fields). For example, the set of rationals with square less than 2 has rational upper bounds (e.g., 1.42), but no rational least upper bound, because the square root of 2 is not rational. These properties imply the Archimedean property (which is not implied by other definitions of completeness), which states that the set of integers is not upper-bounded in the reals. In fact, if this were false, then the integers would have a least upper bound N; then, N ‚Äì 1 would not be an upper bound, and there would be an integer n such that , and thus , which is a contradiction with the upper-bound property of N. The real numbers are uniquely specified by the above properties. More precisely, given any two Dedekind-complete ordered fields R1 and R2, there exists a unique field isomorphism from R1 to R2. This uniqueness allows us to think of them as essentially the same mathematical object. For another axiomatization of ‚Ñù, see Tarski's axiomatization of the reals. = Construction from the rational numbers = The real numbers can be constructed as a completion of the rational numbers, in such a way that a sequence defined by a decimal or binary expansion like (3; 3.1; 3.14; 3.141; 3.1415; ...) converges to a unique real number‚Äîin this case . For details and other constructions of real numbers, see construction of the real numbers.  Properties  = Basic properties = * Any non-zero real number is either negative or positive. * The sum and the product of two non-negative real numbers is again a non-negative real number, i.e., they are closed under these operations, and form a positive cone, thereby giving rise to a linear order of the real numbers along a number line. * The real numbers make up an infinite set of numbers that cannot be injectively mapped to the infinite set of natural numbers, i.e., there are uncountably infinitely many real numbers, whereas the natural numbers are called countably infinite. This establishes that in some sense, there are more real numbers than there are elements in any countable set. * There is a hierarchy of countably infinite subsets of the real numbers, e.g., the integers, the rationals, the algebraic numbers and the computable numbers, each set being a proper subset of the next in the sequence. The complements of all these sets (irrational, transcendental, and non-computable real numbers) with respect to the reals, are all uncountably infinite sets. * Real numbers can be used to express measurements of continuous quantities. They may be expressed by decimal representations, most of them having an infinite sequence of digits to the right of the decimal point; these are often represented like 324.823122147..., where the ellipsis (three dots) indicates that there would still be more digits to come. This hints to the fact that we can precisely denote only a few, selected real numbers with finitely many symbols. More formally, the real numbers have the two basic properties of being an ordered field, and having the least upper bound property. The first says that real numbers comprise a field, with addition and multiplication as well as division by non-zero numbers, which can be totally ordered on a number line in a way compatible with addition and multiplication. The second says that, if a non-empty set of real numbers has an upper bound, then it has a real least upper bound. The second condition distinguishes the real numbers from the rational numbers: for example, the set of rational numbers whose square is less than 2 is a set with an upper bound (e.g. 1.5) but no (rational) least upper bound: hence the rational numbers do not satisfy the least upper bound property. = Completeness = A main reason for using real numbers is that the reals contain all limits. More precisely, a sequence of real numbers has a limit, which is a real number, if (and only if) its elements eventually come and remain arbitrarily close to each other. This is formally defined in the following, and means that the reals are complete (in the sense of metric spaces or uniform spaces, which is a different sense than the Dedekind completeness of the order in the previous section). : A sequence (xn) of real numbers is called a Cauchy sequence if for any there exists an integer N (possibly depending on Œµ) such that the distance is less than Œµ for all n and m that are both greater than N. This definition, originally provided by Cauchy, formalizes the fact that the xn eventually come and remain arbitrarily close to each other. A sequence (xn) converges to the limit x if its elements eventually come and remain arbitrarily close to x, that is, if for any there exists an integer N (possibly depending on Œµ) such that the distance is less than Œµ for n greater than N. Every convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence, and the converse is true for real numbers, and this means that the topological space of the real numbers is complete. The set of rational numbers is not complete. For example, the sequence (1; 1.4; 1.41; 1.414; 1.4142; 1.41421; ...), where each term adds a digit of the decimal expansion of the positive square root of 2, is Cauchy but it does not converge to a rational number (in the real numbers, in contrast, it converges to the positive square root of 2). The completeness property of the reals is the basis on which calculus, and, more generally mathematical analysis are built. In particular, the test that a sequence is a Cauchy sequence allows proving that a sequence has a limit, without computing it, and even without knowing it. For example, the standard series of the exponential function :e^x = \\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{x^n}{n!} converges to a real number for every x, because the sums :\\\\sum_{n=N}^{M} \\\\frac{x^n}{n!} can be made arbitrarily small (independently of M) by choosing N sufficiently large. This proves that the sequence is Cauchy, and thus converges, showing that e^x is well defined for every x. = \\"The complete ordered field\\" = The real numbers are often described as \\"the complete ordered field\\", a phrase that can be interpreted in several ways. First, an order can be lattice-complete. It is easy to see that no ordered field can be lattice-complete, because it can have no largest element (given any element z, is larger), so this is not the sense that is meant. Additionally, an order can be Dedekind-complete, as defined in the section Axioms. The uniqueness result at the end of that section justifies using the word \\"the\\" in the phrase \\"complete ordered field\\" when this is the sense of \\"complete\\" that is meant. This sense of completeness is most closely related to the construction of the reals from Dedekind cuts, since that construction starts from an ordered field (the rationals) and then forms the Dedekind-completion of it in a standard way. These two notions of completeness ignore the field structure. However, an ordered group (in this case, the additive group of the field) defines a uniform structure, and uniform structures have a notion of completeness; the description in the previous section Completeness is a special case. (We refer to the notion of completeness in uniform spaces rather than the related and better known notion for metric spaces, since the definition of metric space relies on already having a characterization of the real numbers.) It is not true that R is the only uniformly complete ordered field, but it is the only uniformly complete Archimedean field, and indeed one often hears the phrase \\"complete Archimedean field\\" instead of \\"complete ordered field\\". Every uniformly complete Archimedean field must also be Dedekind-complete (and vice versa), justifying using \\"the\\" in the phrase \\"the complete Archimedean field\\". This sense of completeness is most closely related to the construction of the reals from Cauchy sequences (the construction carried out in full in this article), since it starts with an Archimedean field (the rationals) and forms the uniform completion of it in a standard way. But the original use of the phrase \\"complete Archimedean field\\" was by David Hilbert, who meant still something else by it. He meant that the real numbers form the largest Archimedean field in the sense that every other Archimedean field is a subfield of R. Thus R is \\"complete\\" in the sense that nothing further can be added to it without making it no longer an Archimedean field. This sense of completeness is most closely related to the construction of the reals from surreal numbers, since that construction starts with a proper class that contains every ordered field (the surreals) and then selects from it the largest Archimedean subfield. = Advanced properties = The reals are uncountable; that is: there are strictly more real numbers than natural numbers, even though both sets are infinite. In fact, the cardinality of the reals equals that of the set of subsets (i.e. the power set) of the natural numbers, and Cantor's diagonal argument states that the latter set's cardinality is strictly greater than the cardinality of N. Since the set of algebraic numbers is countable, almost all real numbers are transcendental. The non-existence of a subset of the reals with cardinality strictly between that of the integers and the reals is known as the continuum hypothesis. The continuum hypothesis can neither be proved nor be disproved; it is independent from the axioms of set theory. As a topological space, the real numbers are separable. This is because the set of rationals, which is countable, is dense in the real numbers. The irrational numbers are also dense in the real numbers, however they are uncountable and have the same cardinality as the reals. The real numbers form a metric space: the distance between x and y is defined as the absolute value . By virtue of being a totally ordered set, they also carry an order topology; the topology arising from the metric and the one arising from the order are identical, but yield different presentations for the topology‚Äîin the order topology as ordered intervals, in the metric topology as epsilon-balls. The Dedekind cuts construction uses the order topology presentation, while the Cauchy sequences construction uses the metric topology presentation. The reals are a contractible (hence connected and simply connected), separable and complete metric space of Hausdorff dimension 1\\\\. The real numbers are locally compact but not compact. There are various properties that uniquely specify them; for instance, all unbounded, connected, and separable order topologies are necessarily homeomorphic to the reals. Every nonnegative real number has a square root in R, although no negative number does. This shows that the order on R is determined by its algebraic structure. Also, every polynomial of odd degree admits at least one real root: these two properties make R the premier example of a real closed field. Proving this is the first half of one proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra. The reals carry a canonical measure, the Lebesgue measure, which is the Haar measure on their structure as a topological group normalized such that the unit interval [0;1] has measure 1. There exist sets of real numbers that are not Lebesgue measurable, e.g. Vitali sets. The supremum axiom of the reals refers to subsets of the reals and is therefore a second-order logical statement. It is not possible to characterize the reals with first-order logic alone: the L√∂wenheim‚ÄìSkolem theorem implies that there exists a countable dense subset of the real numbers satisfying exactly the same sentences in first-order logic as the real numbers themselves. The set of hyperreal numbers satisfies the same first order sentences as R. Ordered fields that satisfy the same first-order sentences as R are called nonstandard models of R. This is what makes nonstandard analysis work; by proving a first-order statement in some nonstandard model (which may be easier than proving it in R), we know that the same statement must also be true of R. The field R of real numbers is an extension field of the field Q of rational numbers, and R can therefore be seen as a vector space over Q. Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice guarantees the existence of a basis of this vector space: there exists a set B of real numbers such that every real number can be written uniquely as a finite linear combination of elements of this set, using rational coefficients only, and such that no element of B is a rational linear combination of the others. However, this existence theorem is purely theoretical, as such a base has never been explicitly described. The well-ordering theorem implies that the real numbers can be well-ordered if the axiom of choice is assumed: there exists a total order on R with the property that every non-empty subset of R has a least element in this ordering. (The standard ordering ‚â§ of the real numbers is not a well-ordering since e.g. an open interval does not contain a least element in this ordering.) Again, the existence of such a well-ordering is purely theoretical, as it has not been explicitly described. If V=L is assumed in addition to the axioms of ZF, a well ordering of the real numbers can be shown to be explicitly definable by a formula., chapter V. A real number may be either computable or uncomputable; either algorithmically random or not; and either arithmetically random or not.  Applications and connections to other areas  = Real numbers and logic = The real numbers are most often formalized using the Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel axiomatization of set theory, but some mathematicians study the real numbers with other logical foundations of mathematics. In particular, the real numbers are also studied in reverse mathematics and in constructive mathematics., chapter 2. The hyperreal numbers as developed by Edwin Hewitt, Abraham Robinson and others extend the set of the real numbers by introducing infinitesimal and infinite numbers, allowing for building infinitesimal calculus in a way closer to the original intuitions of Leibniz, Euler, Cauchy and others. Edward Nelson's internal set theory enriches the Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory syntactically by introducing a unary predicate \\"standard\\". In this approach, infinitesimals are (non-\\"standard\\") elements of the set of the real numbers (rather than being elements of an extension thereof, as in Robinson's theory). The continuum hypothesis posits that the cardinality of the set of the real numbers is \\\\aleph_1; i.e. the smallest infinite cardinal number after \\\\aleph_0, the cardinality of the integers. Paul Cohen proved in 1963 that it is an axiom independent of the other axioms of set theory; that is: one may choose either the continuum hypothesis or its negation as an axiom of set theory, without contradiction. = In physics = In the physical sciences, most physical constants such as the universal gravitational constant, and physical variables, such as position, mass, speed, and electric charge, are modeled using real numbers. In fact, the fundamental physical theories such as classical mechanics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, general relativity and the standard model are described using mathematical structures, typically smooth manifolds or Hilbert spaces, that are based on the real numbers, although actual measurements of physical quantities are of finite accuracy and precision. Physicists have occasionally suggested that a more fundamental theory would replace the real numbers with quantities that do not form a continuum, but such proposals remain speculative. = In computation = With some exceptions, most calculators do not operate on real numbers. Instead, they work with finite-precision approximations called floating-point numbers. In fact, most scientific computation uses floating-point arithmetic. Real numbers satisfy the usual rules of arithmetic, but floating-point numbers do not. Computers cannot directly store arbitrary real numbers with infinitely many digits. The achievable precision is limited by the number of bits allocated to store a number, whether as floating-point numbers or arbitrary-precision numbers. However, computer algebra systems can operate on irrational quantities exactly by manipulating formulas for them (such as \\\\sqrt{2}, \\\\arcsin (2/23), or \\\\textstyle\\\\int_0^1 x^x \\\\,dx) rather than their rational or decimal approximation. It is not in general possible to determine whether two such expressions are equal (the constant problem). A real number is called computable if there exists an algorithm that yields its digits. Because there are only countably many algorithms, but an uncountable number of reals, almost all real numbers fail to be computable. Moreover, the equality of two computable numbers is an undecidable problem. Some constructivists accept the existence of only those reals that are computable. The set of definable numbers is broader, but still only countable. = \\"Reals\\" in set theory = In set theory, specifically descriptive set theory, the Baire space is used as a surrogate for the real numbers since the latter have some topological properties (connectedness) that are a technical inconvenience. Elements of Baire space are referred to as \\"reals\\".  Vocabulary and notation  Mathematicians use the symbol R, or, alternatively, ‚Ñù, the letter \\"R\\" in blackboard bold (encoded in Unicode as ), to represent the set of all real numbers. As this set is naturally endowed with the structure of a field, the expression field of real numbers is frequently used when its algebraic properties are under consideration. The sets of positive real numbers and negative real numbers are often noted R+ and R‚àí, respectively; R+ and R‚àí are also used.√âcole Normale Sup√©rieure of Paris, ‚Äú‚Äù (‚ÄúReal numbers‚Äù) , p. 6 The non-negative real numbers can be noted R‚â•0 but one often sees this set noted R+ ‚à™ {0}. In French mathematics, the positive real numbers and negative real numbers commonly include zero, and these sets are noted respectively ‚Ñù+ and ‚Ñù‚àí. In this understanding, the respective sets without zero are called strictly positive real numbers and strictly negative real numbers, and are noted ‚Ñù+* and ‚Ñù‚àí*. The notation Rn refers to the Cartesian product of n copies of R, which is an n-dimensional vector space over the field of the real numbers; this vector space may be identified to the n-dimensional space of Euclidean geometry as soon as a coordinate system has been chosen in the latter. For example, a value from R3 consists of a tuple of three real numbers and specifies the coordinates of a point in 3‚Äëdimensional space. In mathematics, real is used as an adjective, meaning that the underlying field is the field of the real numbers (or the real field). For example, real matrix, real polynomial and real Lie algebra. The word is also used as a noun, meaning a real number (as in \\"the set of all reals\\").  Generalizations and extensions  The real numbers can be generalized and extended in several different directions: * The complex numbers contain solutions to all polynomial equations and hence are an algebraically closed field unlike the real numbers. However, the complex numbers are not an ordered field. * The affinely extended real number system adds two elements +‚àû and ‚àí‚àû. It is a compact space. It is no longer a field, or even an additive group, but it still has a total order; moreover, it is a complete lattice. * The real projective line adds only one value ‚àû. It is also a compact space. Again, it is no longer a field, or even an additive group. However, it allows division of a non-zero element by zero. It has cyclic order described by a separation relation. * The long real line pastes together ‚Ñµ1* + ‚Ñµ1 copies of the real line plus a single point (here ‚Ñµ1* denotes the reversed ordering of ‚Ñµ1) to create an ordered set that is \\"locally\\" identical to the real numbers, but somehow longer; for instance, there is an order-preserving embedding of ‚Ñµ1 in the long real line but not in the real numbers.

Despite no concrete evidence to support the concept, belief in fan death persists to this day in Korea, and also to a lesser extent in Japan. Origins of the belief Where the idea came from is unclear, but fears about electric fans date almost to their introduction to Korea, with stories dating to the 1920s and 1930s warning of the risks of nausea, asphyxiation, and facial paralysis from the new technology.\\"Strange Harm From Electric Fans\\", Jungoe Ilbo (Domestic and International Daily), July 31, 1927, \\"The rotating fan blades create a vacuum directly in front, and the intensity of the resulting air flow always results in an insufficient supply of oxygen to the lungs.\\" One conspiracy theory is that the South Korean government created or perpetuated the myth as propaganda to curb the energy consumption of South Korean households during the 1970s energy crisis, but Slate reports that the myth is much older than that ‚Äì probably as far back as the introduction of electric fans in Korea, and cites a 1927 article about \\"Strange Harm from Electric Fans\\". Proposed causes =Asbestos= During the 1970s Korea experienced a sharp increase in the use of asbestos for building as it had a number of flame retardant properties. Inhalation of asbestos fibres can lead to various serious lung conditions, including asbestosis and cancer. The material used in buildings can easily become friable, and the dust ends up resting on surfaces until disturbed by moving air around. When in an enclosed space, asbestos dust or fibres pose a legitimate health risk if the air is continually disturbed, as it may allow fibres to remain in the air for longer periods or even encourage more fibres to become airborne as the current airborne fibres become trapped in the victims lungs and are replaced by the phenomena of Brownian motion and the fan-disturbed air. Projections are expecting an increase in the number of cases of asbestos related lung cancers as the latency period for the illness can be anywhere from 10 to 40 years. =Hyperthermia (heat stress)= Air movement will increase sweat evaporation, which cools the body. But in extreme heat and high humidity it will increase the heat stress placed on the body, potentially speeding the onset of heat exhaustion and other detrimental conditions: The American Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) discourages people from using fans in closed rooms without ventilation when the heat index (a combination of temperature and humidity) is above . The EPA does, however, approve of using a fan if a window is open and it is cooler outside, or in a closed room when the heat index is lower.Excessive Heat Events Guidebook, United States Environmental Protection Agency. \\"Annex B: Use of Portable Electric Fans During Excessive Heat Events ... Don't Use a portable electric fan in a closed room without windows or doors open to the outside. ... Don't Use a portable electric fan to blow extremely hot air on yourself. This can accelerate the risk of heat exhaustion. ... Annex C: Excessive Heat Events Guidebook in Brief ... Don't direct the flow of portable electric fans toward yourself when room temperature is hotter than 90 ¬∞F.\\" =Hypothermia= Hypothermia is abnormally low body temperature caused by inadequate thermoregulation. As the metabolism slows down at night, one becomes more sensitive to temperature, and thus supposedly more prone to hypothermia. Most at risk would be someone in frail health over an extended period of time. Investigative autopsies of fan death victims showed that those suffering from issues like heart problems or alcoholism may have had their condition exacerbated by the temperature drop and thus could succumb to that illness more easily.Surridge, Grant.

He was a member of the Bornholm school of painters. Biography Lergaard was born at Vorup in Randers, Denmark. He first trained at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen. He subsequently taught at the Royal Academy (1917‚Äì20). He spent a few years in Norway, where he lived until 1928 and where he became interested in Norwegian landscape painting. Niels Lergaard biography from Invaluable.com. Retrieved 11 December 2008. In the late 1920s, he moved to the picturesque Danish island of Bornholm where he joined the art colony known at the Bornholm school of painters (Bornholmerskolen). His paintings displayed the careful construction that characterized his work, for example in his landscapes of Gudhjem. He painted the sea, with a high horizon, the coast, figures with precisely constructed silhouettes, or Bornholm‚Äôs steep cliffs. In the 1940s his art moved towards ever-increasing simplification. With strong violet and purple colors that dominate. The dark colours he used in the 1930s were gradually replaced by a lighter palette. He worked to release new expressive possibilities from oil colours and in this way further emphasized the luminous power and depth of the picture plane. Thus his landscapes display a deeply symbolic, transcendent power. From 1959 to 1964, Lergaard was a professor at the Royal Academy. In 1965 he received the Eckersberg Medal.

These services involve the planning, organizing, directing and handling of agricultural produce in such a way as to satisfy farmers, intermediaries and consumers. Numerous interconnected activities are involved in doing this, such as planning production, growing and harvesting, grading, packing and packaging, transport, storage, agro- and food processing, provision of market information, distribution, advertising and sale. Effectively, the term encompasses the entire range of supply chain operations for agricultural products, whether conducted through ad hoc sales or through a more integrated chain, such as one involving contract farming. Agricultural marketing development Congestion at a market in Abidjan A typical market in Africa Efforts to develop agricultural marketing have, particularly in developing countries, tended to concentrate on a number of areas, specifically infrastructure development; information provision; training of farmers and traders in marketing and post-harvest issues; and support to the development of an appropriate policy environment. In the past, efforts were made to develop government-run marketing bodies but these have tended to become less prominent over the years. =Agricultural Market infrastructure= Efficient marketing infrastructure such as wholesale, retail and assembly markets and storage facilities is essential for cost-effective marketing, to minimize post-harvest losses and to reduce health risks. Markets play an important role in rural development, income generation, food security, and developing rural- market linkages. Experience shows that planners need to be aware of how to design markets that meet a community's social and economic needs and how to choose a suitable site for a new market. In many cases sites are chosen that are inappropriate and result in under-use or even no use of the infrastructure constructed. It is also not sufficient just to build a market: attention needs to be paid to how that market will be managed, operated and maintained. Rural assembly markets are located in production areas and primarily serve as places where farmers can meet with traders to sell their products. These may be occasional (perhaps weekly) markets, such as haat bazaars in India and Nepal, or permanent. Terminal wholesale markets are located in major metropolitan areas, where produce is finally channelled to consumers through trade between wholesalers and retailers, caterers, etc. The characteristics of wholesale markets have changed considerably as retailing changes in response to urban growth, the increasing role of supermarkets and increased consumer spending capacity. These changes may require responses in the way in which traditional wholesale markets are organized and managed. Retail marketing systems in western countries have broadly evolved from traditional street markets through to the modern hypermarket or out-of-town shopping center. In developing countries, there remains scope to improve agricultural marketing by constructing new retail markets, despite the growth of supermarkets, although municipalities often view markets primarily as sources of revenue rather than infrastructure requiring development. Effective regulation of markets is essential. Inside a market, both hygiene rules and revenue collection activities have to be enforced. Of equal importance, however, is the maintenance of order outside the market. Licensed traders in a market will not be willing to cooperate in raising standards if they face competition from unlicensed operators outside who do not pay any of the costs involved in providing a proper service.Tracey-White, J. Retail markets planning guide. FAO, Rome, 1995. =Market information= Efficient market information can be shown to have positive benefits for farmers and traders. Up-to-date information on prices and other market factors enables farmers to negotiate with traders and also facilitates spatial distribution of products from rural areas to towns and between markets.Aparajita Goyal , Information, Direct Access to Farmers, and Rural Market Performance in Central India, July 2010 Most governments in developing countries have tried to provide market information services to farmers, but these have tended to experience problems of sustainability. Moreover, even when they function, the service provided is often insufficient to allow commercial decisions to be made because of time lags between data collection and dissemination.Andrew W. Shepherd , Market information services ‚Äì Theory and Practice. FAO, Rome, 1997 Modern communications technologies open up the possibility for market information services to improve information delivery through SMS on cell phones and the rapid growth of FM radio stations in many developing countries offers the possibility of more localised information services. In the longer run, the internet may become an effective way of delivering information to farmers. However, problems associated with the cost and accuracy of data collection still remain to be addressed. Even when they have access to market information, farmers often require assistance in interpreting that information. For example, the market price quoted on the radio may refer to a wholesale selling price and farmers may have difficulty in translating this into a realistic price at their local assembly market.Andrew W. Shepherd , Understanding and Using Market Information. FAO, Rome, 2000 Various attempts have been made in developing countries to introduce commercial market information services but these have largely been targeted at traders, commercial farmers or exporters. It is not easy to see how small, poor farmers can generate sufficient income for a commercial service to be profitable although in India a new service introduced by Thomson Reuters was reportedly used by over 100,000 farmers in its first year of operation. Esoko in West Africa attempts to subsidize the cost of such services to farmers by charging access to a more advanced feature set of mobile-based tools to businesses. =Marketing training= Farmers frequently consider marketing as being their major problem. However, while they are able to identify such problems as poor prices, lack of transport and high post-harvest losses, they are often poorly equipped to identify potential solutions. Successful marketing requires learning new skills, new techniques and new ways of obtaining information. Extension officers working with ministries of agriculture or NGOs are often well-trained in agricultural production techniques but usually lack knowledge of marketing or post-harvest handling.Grahame Dixie Horticultural Marketing, Marketing Extension Guide 5, FAO, Rome, 2007. =Enabling environments= Agricultural marketing needs to be conducted within a supportive policy, legal, institutional, macro-economic, infrastructural and bureaucratic environment. Traders and others are generally reluctant to make investments in an uncertain policy climate, such as those that restrict imports and exports or internal produce movement. Businesses have difficulty functioning when their trading activities are hampered by excessive bureaucracy. Inappropriate law can distort and reduce the efficiency of the market, increase the costs of doing business and retard the development of a competitive private sector. Poor support institutions, such as agricultural extension services, municipalities that operate markets inefficiently and inadequate export promotion bodies, can be particularly damaging. Poor roads increase the cost of doing business, reduce payments to farmers and increase prices to consumers. Finally, corruption can increase the transaction costs faced by those in the marketing chain. =Agricultural marketing support= Most governments have at some stage made efforts to promote agricultural marketing improvements. In the United States the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) is a division of USDA and has programs that provide testing, support standardization and grading and offer market news services. AMS oversees marketing agreements and orders research and promotion programs. It also purchases commodities for federal food programs. USDA also provides support to agricultural marketing work at various universities. In the United Kingdom, support for marketing of some commodities was provided before and after the Second World War by boards such as the Milk Marketing Board and the Egg Marketing Board. These boards were closed down in the 1970s. As a colonial power, Britain established marketing boards in many countries, particularly in Africa. Some continue to exist although many were closed at the time of the introduction of structural adjustment measures in the 1990s. Several developing countries have established government-sponsored marketing or agribusiness units. South Africa, for example, started the National Agricultural Marketing Council (NAMC) as a response to the deregulation of the agriculture industry and closure of marketing boards in the country. India has the long-established National Institute of Agricultural Marketing. These are primarily research and policy organizations, but other agencies provide facilitating services for marketing channels, such as the provision of infrastructure, market information and documentation support. Examples from the Caribbean include the National Agricultural Marketing Development Corporation (NAMDEVCO) in Trinidad and Tobago and the New Guyana Marketing Corporation in Guyana. =Recent developments= New marketing linkages between agribusiness, large retailers and farmers are gradually being developed, e.g. through contract farming, group marketing and other forms of collective action.Helen Markelova and Ruth Meinzen-Dick Collective action and market access for smallholders: A summary of findings. CAPRi/IFPRI 2007 Donors and NGOs are paying increasing attention to ways of promoting direct linkages between farmers and buyersAndrew W. Shepherd Approaches to linking producers to markets. FAO, Rome, 2007 within a value chain context. More attention is now being paid to the development of regional markets (e.g. East Africa) and to structured trading systems that should facilitate such developments. The growth of supermarkets, particularly in Latin America and East and South East Asia, is having a significant impact on marketing channels for horticultural, dairy and livestock products.Reardon, T., C.P. Timmer, C.B. Barrett, J. Berdegue. ‚ÄúThe Rise of Supermarkets in Africa, Asia, and Latin America,‚Äù American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 85 (5), December 2003: 1140-1146. Nevertheless, ‚Äúspot‚Äù markets will continue to be important for many years, necessitating attention to infrastructure improvement such as for retail and wholesale markets.

However, the goddesses are not discussed as frequently as gods (devas). Parvati appears in late Vedic texts dated to be pre-Buddhist, but verses dedicated to her do not suggest that her characteristics were fully developed in the Vedic era. All gods and goddesses are distinguished in Vedic times, but in post-Vedic texts, particularly in the early medieval era literature, they are ultimately seen as aspects or manifestations of one Devi, the Supreme Power.Fuller, Christopher John (2004). The Camphor Flame: Popular Hinduism and Society in India. Princeton University Press, , page 41 Devi is the supreme being in the Shakta tradition of Hinduism; in the Smarta tradition, she is one of the five primary forms of Brahman that is revered. In other Hindu traditions, Devi embodies the active energy and power of Deva, and they always appear together complementing each other. Examples of this are Parvati with Shiva in Shaivism, Saraswati with Brahma in Brahmanism and Lakshmi with Vishnu in Vaishnavism.Stella Kramrisch (1975), The Indian Great Goddess, History of Religions, Vol. 14, No. 4, page 261Ananda Coomaraswamy, Saiva Sculptures, Museum of Fine Arts Bulletin, Vol. 20, No. 118, page 17 Devi-inspired philosophy is propounded in many Hindu texts such as the Devi Upanishad, which teaches that Shakti is essentially Brahman (ultimate metaphysical Reality) and that from her arises prak·πõti (matter) and purusha (consciousness) and that she is bliss and non-bliss, the Vedas and what is different from it, the born and the unborn and all of the universe. Shakti is Parvati, Shiva‚Äôs wife. She is also mentioned as the creative power of Shiva in Tripura Upanishad, Bahvricha Upanishad and Guhyakali Upanishad. Devi identifies herself in the Devi Upanishad as Brahman in her reply to the gods stating that she rules the world, blesses devotees with riches, that she is the supreme deity to whom all worship is to be offered and that she infuses ƒÄtman in every soul. Devi asserts that she is creator of earth and heaven and resides there. Her creation of the sky as father and the seas as mother is reflected as the 'Inner Supreme Self'. Her creations are not prompted by any higher being and she resides in all her creations. She is, states Devi, the eternal and infinite consciousness engulfing earth and heaven, and 'all forms of bliss and non-bliss, knowledge and ignorance, Brahman and Non-Brahman'. The tantric aspect in Devi Upanishad, says June McDaniel, is the usage of the terms yantra, bindu, bija, mantra, shakti and chakra. Among the major world religions, the concept of Goddess in Hinduism as the divine feminine, has had the strongest presence since ancient times. Examples =Parvati= Parvati in her warrior form riding a lion Parvati is the Hindu goddess of love, beauty, purity, fertility and devotion, divine power and killing asua.Dehejia, H.V. Parvati: Goddess of Love. Mapin, .James Hendershot, Penance, Trafford, , pp 78.Chandra, Suresh (1998). Encyclopaedia of Hindu Gods and Goddesses. , pp 245‚Äì246 She is the Adi Parashakti. She is the mother goddess in Hinduism and has many attributes and aspects. Each of her aspects is expressed with a different name, giving her over 10008 names in regional Hindu mythologies of India, including the popular name Gauri.Keller and Ruether (2006). Encyclopedia of Women and Religion in North America. Indiana University Press, , pp 663 Along with Lakshmi (goddess of wealth and prosperity) and Saraswati (goddess of knowledge and learning), she forms the trinity of Hindu goddesses.Schuon, Frithjof (2003). Roots of the Human Condition. , pp 32 Parvati is the wife of Shiva - the destroyer, recycler and regenerator of universe and all life.Balfour, Edward The Encyclopaedia of India and of Eastern and Southern Asia. , pp 153. She is the mother of Hindu gods Ganesha and Kartikeya.Haag, James W. et al. (2013). The Routledge Companion to Religion and Science, Routledge, , pp 491‚Äì496 Rita Gross states,Gross, Rita M. (1978). Hindu Female Deities as a Resource for the Contemporary Rediscovery of the Goddess. Journal of the American Academy of Religion 46(3): 269‚Äì291. that the view of Parvati only as ideal wife and mother is incomplete symbolism of the power of the feminine in the mythology of India. Parvati, along with other goddesses, are involved with the broad range of culturally valued goals and activities. Her connection with motherhood and female sexuality does not confine the feminine or exhaust their significance and activities in Hindu literature.She manifests in every activity, from water to mountains, from arts to inspiring warriors, from agriculture to dance. Parvati's numerous aspects, states Gross, reflects the Hindu belief that the feminine has universal range of activities, and her gender is not a limiting condition. In Hindu belief, Parvati is the recreative energy and power of Shiva, and she is the cause of a bond that connects all beings and a means of their spiritual release.Ananda Coomaraswamy, Saiva Sculptures, Museum of Fine Arts Bulletin, Vol. 20, No. 118 (Apr., 1922), pp 17Stella Kramrisch (1975), The Indian Great Goddess, History of Religions, Vol. 14, No. 4, pp. 261 Devi is portrayed as the ideal wife, mother, and householder in Indian legends.Wojciech Maria Zalewski (2012), The Crucible of Religion: Culture, Civilization, and Affirmation of Life, , pp 136 In Indian art, this vision of ideal couple is derived from Shiva and Parvati as being half of the other, represented as Ardhanarisvara.Betty Seid (2004), The Lord Who Is Half Woman (Ardhanarishvara), Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies, Vol. 30, No. 1, Notable Acquisitions at The Art Institute of Chicago, pp. 48‚Äì49MB Wangu (2003), Images of Indian Goddesses: Myths, Meanings, and Models, , Chapter 4 and pp 86‚Äì89.A Pande (2004), Ardhanarishvara, the Androgyne: Probing the Gender Within, , pp 20‚Äì27 Parvati is found extensively in ancient Indian literature, and her statues and iconography grace ancient and medieval era Hindu temples all over South Asia and Southeast Asia.Hariani Santiko, The Goddess DurgƒÅ in the East-Javanese Period, Asian Folklore Studies, Vol. 56, No. 2 (1997), pp. 209‚Äì226Ananda Coomaraswamy, Saiva Sculptures, Museum of Fine Arts Bulletin, Vol. 20, No. 118 (Apr., 1922), pp 15‚Äì24 =Lakshmi= Lakshmi Lakshmi, also called Sri, is the Hindu goddess of wealth, fortune, and prosperity (both material and spiritual). She is the consort and active energy of Vishnu.A Parasarthy (1983), Symbolism in Hinduism, CMP, , pages 57‚Äì59 Her four hands represent the four goals of human life considered important to the Hindu way of life ‚Äì dharma, kƒÅma, artha, and moksha.Rhodes, Constantina (2011).

State University of New York Press, , pp. 29‚Äì47, 220‚Äì252.Divali - THE SYMBOLISM OF LAKSHMI National Library and Information System Authority, Trinidad and Tobago (2009) She is also part of Tridevi which consists of Lakshmi, Parvati (goddess of power, fertility, love, beauty), and Saraswati (goddess of music, wisdom, and learning). In the ancient scriptures of India, all women are declared to be embodiments of Lakshmi. The marriage and relationship between Lakshmi and Vishnu as wife and husband, states Patricia Monaghan, is \\"the paradigm for rituals and ceremonies for the bride and groom in Hindu weddings.\\"Monaghan, Patricia. (ed.) (2010). Goddesses in World Culture, Volume 1. Praeger, , pp. 5‚Äì11. Archaeological discoveries and ancient coins suggest the recognition and reverence for goddess Lakshmi in the Scytho-Parthian kingdom and throughout India by the 1st millennium BCE.Vishnu, Asha (1993). Material life of northern India: Based on an archaeological study, 3rd century B.C. to 1st century B.C. , pp. 194‚Äì195. She is also revered in other non-Hindu cultures of Asia, such as in Tibet.Miranda Shaw (2006), Buddhist Goddesses of India, Princeton University Press, , Chapter 13 with pages 258‚Äì262 Lakshmi's iconography and statues have also been found in Hindu temples throughout Southeast Asia, estimated to be from second half of 1st millennium CE.Roveda, Vitorio (June, 2004). The Archaeology of Khmer Images. As√©anie 13(13): 11‚Äì46.O goddess where art thou? S. James, Cornell University (2011) In modern times, Lakshmi is worshipped as the goddess of wealth. The festivals of Diwali and Sharad Purnima (Kojagiri Purnima) are celebrated in her honor.Jones, Constance (2011). Religious Celebrations: An Encyclopedia of Holidays, Festivals, Solemn Observances, and Spiritual Commemorations (Editor: J Gordon Melton), , pp. 253‚Äì254, 798. =Saraswati= Image of goddess Saraswati Saraswati, is the Hindu goddess of knowledge, music, arts, wisdom and learning. She is the consort of Brahma.Encyclopaedia of Hinduism, p. 1214; Sarup & Sons, The earliest known mention of Saraswati as a goddess is in Rigveda. She has remained significant as a goddess from the Vedic age through modern times of Hindu traditions. Some Hindus celebrate the festival of Vasant Panchami (the fifth day of spring) in her honour,Vasant Panchami Saraswati Puja , Know India - Odisha Fairs and Festivals and mark the day by helping young children learn how to write alphabets on that day.The festival of Vasant Panchami: A new beginning, Alan Barker, United Kingdom She is also part of Tridevi which consists of Saraswati, Parvati (goddess of power, fertility, love, beauty), and Lakshmi (goddess of material wealth, prosperity, and fortune). Saraswati is often depicted dressed in pure white, often seated on a white lotus. She not only embodies knowledge but also the experience of the highest reality. Her iconography is typically in white themes from dress to flowers to swan ‚Äì the colour symbolizing Sattwa Guna or purity, discrimination for true knowledge, insight and wisdom.Jean Holm and John Bowke (1998), Picturing God, Bloomsbury Academic, , pages 99‚Äì101 She is generally shown to have four arms, but sometimes just two. The four hands hold items with symbolic meaning ‚Äî a pustaka (book or script), a mala (rosary, garland), a water pot and a musical instrument (lute or vina). The book she holds symbolizes the Vedas representing the universal, divine, eternal, and true knowledge as well as all forms of learning. A mƒÅlƒÅ of crystals, representing the power of meditation, a pot of water represents powers to purify the right from wrong. The musical instrument, typically a veena, represents all creative arts and sciences, and her holding it symbolizes expressing knowledge that creates harmony.Griselda Pollock and Victoria Turvey-Sauron (2008), The Sacred and the Feminine: Imagination and Sexual Difference, , pages 144‚Äì147 The Saraswatirahasya Upanishad of the Yajurveda contain ten verses called \\"dasa sloki\\" which are in praise of Sarasvati. In this Upanishad, she is extolled as > You are the swan gliding over the pond of creative energy, waves and waves > of creative forces emanating from your form! Radiant Goddess resplendent in > white, dwell forever in the Kashmir of my heart. Saraswati is also found outside India, such as in Japan, Vietnam, Bali (Indonesia) and Myanmar.Thomas Donaldson (2001), Iconography of the Buddhist Sculpture of Orissa, , pages 274‚Äì275 =Durga and Kali= Vedic literature does not have any particular goddess matching the concept of Durga. Her legends appear in the medieval era, as angry, ferocious form of mother goddess Parvati take the avatar as Durga or Kali.Kinsley, David (1988). Hindu Goddesses: Vision of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Traditions. University of California Press, . She manifests as a goddess with eight or ten arms holding weapons and skulls of demons, and is astride on a tiger or lion.Pattanaik, Devdutt (2014). Pashu: Animal Tales from Hindu Mythology. Penguin, , pp. 40‚Äì42.Kempton, Sally (2013). Awakening Shakti: The Transformative Power of the Goddesses of Yoga. , pp. 165‚Äì167. In Skanda Purana,Devi Bhagbhatpuran and other purans Parvati assumes the form of a warrior-goddess and defeats a demon called Durg who assumes the form of a buffalo. In this aspect, she is known by the name Durga. In later Hindu literature, states Jansen, she is attributed the role of the \\"energy, power (shakti) of the Impersonal Absolute\\". In the Shaktism traditions of Hinduism, found particularly in eastern states of India, Durga is a popular goddess form of Parvati. In the medieval era composed texts such as the Puranas, she emerges as a prominent goddess in the context of crisis, when evil asuras were on the ascent. The male gods were unable to contain and subdue the forces of evil, . The warrior goddess, Parvati, she kills the asura, she is thereafter invincible and revered as \\"preserver of Dharma, destroyer of evil\\".Jansen, Eva Rudy (2001). The Book of Hindu Imagery: Gods, Manifestations and Their Meaning. Holland: Binkey Kok, , pp. 133‚Äì134, 41. Durga's emergence and mythology is described in the Puranas, particularly the Devi Mahatmya. The text describes KƒÅlƒ´'s emerging out of Parvati when she becomes extremely angry. Parvati's face turns pitch dark, and suddenly Kali springs forth from Parvati's forehead. She is black, wears a garland of human heads, is clothed in a tiger skin, rides a tiger, and wields a staff topped by a human skull. She destroys the asuras. Literature on goddess Kali recounts several such appearances, mostly in her terrifying but protective aspects. Kali appears as an independent deity, or like Durga, viewed as the wife of Shiva. In this aspect, she represents the omnipotent Shakti of Shiva. She holds both the creative and destructive power of time. Kali, also called Kalaratri, is called in Yoga Vasistha as Prak·πõti or \\"all of nature\\". She is described in the text, state Shimkhanda and Herman, as the \\"one great body of cosmos\\", and same as Devis \\"Durga, Jaya and Siddha, Virya, Gayatri, Saraswati, Uma, Savitri\\".Shimkhada, D. and P.K. Herman (2009). The Constant and Changing Faces of the Goddess: Goddess Traditions of Asia. Cambridge Scholars, , pp. 212‚Äì213. She is the power that supports the earth, with all its seas, islands, forests, deserts and mountains, asserts Yoga Vasistha. She is not to be confused with the Kali Yuga, which is spelled similarly yet holds a different meaning. The Kali Yuga is presented as a threat to Mother India, with pictures from the nineteenth century depicting the age as a \\"ferocious meat-eating demon\\" in comparison to India's depiction of \\"a cow giving milk to her children\\".Religions in the Modern World The largest annual festival associated with the goddess is Durga Puja celebrated in the month of Ashvin (September‚ÄìOctober), where nine manifestations of Parvati (Navadurga) are worshipped, each on a day over nine days. These are: Shailaputri, Brahmacharini, Chandraghanta, Kushmanda, Skandamata, Katyayani, Kaalratri, Mahagauri and Siddhidaatri. =Tridevi= In the feminist Shaktidharma denomination of Hinduism, the supreme deity Mahadevi manifests as the goddess Mahasaraswati in order to create, as the goddess Mahalaxmi in order to preserve, and as the goddess Mahakali (Parvati) in order to destroy. These three forms of the supreme goddess Mahadevi are collectively called the Tridevi. =Sita= Sita Sita, an incarnation of Lakshmi, is the wife of Rama, an avatar of Vishnu. She is shakti or prakriti of Rama as told in the Ram Raksha Stotram. In Sita Upanishad, a shakta Upanishad, Sita is extolled as the supreme goddess. The Upanishad identifies Sita with Prakrti (nature) which is constituted by \\"will\\" ichha, activity (kriya) and knowledge (jnana). The Upanishad also states that Sita emerged while furrowing, at the edge of the plough. She is extolled as one of the Panchakanya for her virtuous qualities; taking their names destroys all sins. Her life story and journeys with her husband Rama and brother-in-law Lakshmana are part of the Hindu epic Ramayana, an allegorical story with Hindu spiritual and ethical teachings.A Arni A. and M Chitrakar M. Sita's Ramayana, Tara, However, there are many versions of Ramayana, and her story as a goddess in Hindu mythology. Her legends also vary in southeast Asian versions of the epic Ramayana, such as in the Ramakien of Thailand where she is spelled as Sida (or Nang Sida).SN Desai (2005), Hinduism in Thai Life, Popular Prakashan, , pages 86‚Äì107, 121‚Äì123 In Valmiki Ramayana, Sita is repeatedly expressed as manifestation of Lakshmi, as the one who blesses abundance in agriculture, food, and wealth. She is referred to golden goddess, wherein after Rama (Vishnu) is bereaved of her, he refuses to marry again, insists that he is married solely and forever to her, and uses a golden image of Sita as a substitute in the performance of his duties as a king. Sita, in many Hindu mythology, is the Devi associated with agriculture, fertility, food and wealth for continuation of humanity. =Radha= Sculpture of Radha Radha means \\"prosperity, success, and lightning.\\" She is the female counterpart of Krishna. In Puranic literature such as the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, she is known as the Goddess of love. She is known as goddess from the 12th century onwards and has figured prominently in the poems of Vidyapati (1352‚Äì1448) as a cosmic queen. She is also considered as an incarnation of Lakshmi. According to legend, Radha was married but she had mystical intimacy with Krishna. Radha was made famous through Jayadeva's Gitagovinda poems. She was born as a milkmaid. She is considered a goddess of the heaven (Goloka) who was considered a combination of Shakti and Vishnu's power. Her love affair with Krishna was set in Vraja and its surrounding forests much before Krishna married Rukmini and Satyabhama. Her attribute is lotus and she has always been a part of the bhakti movement symbolising \\"yearning of human soul drawn to Krishna\\". In South India she is considered as Bhumidevi and is linked to Saraswati. The Gitagovinda (12th century), a lyrical drama, a \\"mystical erotic poem\\", describes the love of Krishna and gopis, Radha in particular, a symbolism for the human soul. =Mahadevi= In the sixth century when Devi Mahatmya came into practice the name Devi (goddess) or Mahadevi (Great Goddess) came into prominence to represent one female goddess to encompass the discrete goddesses like Parvati and so forth. In the Hindu mythology, Devi and Deva are usually paired, complement and go together, typically shown as equal but sometimes the Devi is shown smaller or in the subordinate role. Some goddesses, however, play an independent role in Hindu pantheon, and are revered as Supreme without any male god(s) present or with males in subordinate position. Mahadevi, as mother goddess, is an example of the later, where she subsumes all goddesses, becomes the ultimate goddess, and is sometimes just called Devi. The counterpart of Mahadevi is Mahadeva who is Shiva so many people think of Mahadevi as Parvati. Tripura Sundari, one aspect of Mahadevi, is shown above with all major male gods as smaller, subordinate and subsumed. Theological texts projected Mahadevi as ultimate reality in the universe as a \\"powerful, creative, active, transcendent female being.\\" The Puranas and Tantra literature of India celebrates this idea, particularly between the 12th‚Äì16th century, and the best example of such texts being the various manuscript versions of Devi Bhagavata Purana with the embedded Devi Gita therein.Eva Rudy Jansen, The Book of Hindu Imagery: Gods, Manifestations and Their Meaning, Holland: Binkey Kok, , pages 127‚Äì128Tracy Pintchman (2001), Seeking Mahadevi: Constructing the Identities of the Hindu Great Goddess, State University of New York Press, , pages 1‚Äì12, 19‚Äì32, 191‚Äì192 Devi Bhagavata Purana gives prime position to Mahadevi as the mother of all- encompassing the three worlds and gives her the position of being all of universe ‚Äì the material and the spiritual. In the Upanishadic text Devi Upanishad, a Sakta Upanishad and an important Tantric text probably composed sometime between the ninth and fourteenth centuries the Goddess is addressed in the most general and universal of terms, as Mahadevi, and represents all goddesses as different manifestations of her. The Lalita Sahasranama (Thousand names of Lalita (Parvati) states that Mahadevi is known by different synonyms such as Jagatikanda (anchors the world), Vishvadhika (one who surpasses the universe), Nirupama (one who has no match), Parameshwari (dominant governor), Vyapini (encompasses everything), Aprameya (immeasurable), Anekakotibrahmadajanani (creator of many universes), Vishvagarbha (she whose Garba or womb subsumes the universe), Sarvadhara (helps all), Sarvaga (being everywhere at the same time, Sarvalokesi (governs all worlds) and Vishavdaharini one who functions for the whole universe). The Mahadevi goddess has many aspects to her personality. She focuses on that side of her that suits her objectives, but unlike male Hindu deities, her powers and knowledge work in concert in a multifunctional manner.Tracy Pintchman (2001), Seeking Mahadevi: Constructing the Identities of the Hindu Great Goddess, State University of New York Press, , pages 25, 35 note 8 The ten aspects of her, also called Mahavidyas (or great forms of her knowledge) are forms of Parvati and they are: Kali, Tara, Tripura Sundari, Bhairavi, Bhuvanesvari, Chhinnamasta, Dhumavati, Bagalamukhi, Matangi and Kamala. =Tantra and Devis= Yantra are used as icons for Devi in Tantra; above is Tripura- Bhairavi yantra Tantric literature such as Soundarya Lahari meaning \\"Flood of Beauty\\", credited to Adi Shankaracharya a shakta or tantric poem, is dedicated to the Supreme Deity of the sect, Parvati who is considered much superior to Shiva. It celebrates Parvati and her feminine persona. It is an approach to the tantra through Parvati. In Shakti Tantra traditions, Devis are visualized with yantra and are a tool for spiritual journey for the tantric adept. The adepts ritually construct triangle yantras with proper use of visualization, movement, and mantra. The adepts believe, state John Stratton Hawley and Donna Marie Wulff, that \\"to establish such yantra is to place the macrocosm within oneself\\", and doing so can yield temporal benefits, spiritual powers or enlightenment.John Stratton Hawley and Donna Marie Wulff (1998), Devi: Goddesses of India, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 64‚Äì67 A tantric text titled \\"Vigyan Bhairav Tantra\\", 'Vigyan' meaning \\"consciousness\\" is a conversation between Shiva and Parvati rendered in 112 verses, elaborates on \\"wisdom and insight of pure consciousness.\\" Devi Puja is the worship of Parvati which is observed through four forms of Devi Yantra; the first is Tara that exists in the realm of the fourth chakra representing the spiritual heart; Saraswati emanates in the first chakra; Lakshmi forms the second chakra; and Parvati is at the heart of the third chakra and completes the chakra. Worship through this Yantra leads to the realization of \\"cosmic energy\\" within oneself. Matrikas Matrikas, that is, the mothers, are seven or eight female divinities, which are depicted as a group. They are all forms of Parvati. They are Brahmani, Vaishnavi, Maheshvari, Indrani, Kaumari, Varahi and Chamundi or Narasimhi. The Matrikas concept are important in Tantric traditions.MB Wangu (2003), Images of Indian Goddesses, Abhinav Publications, , page 41 They are described in the Isaanasivagurudevapaddhati, as creations to facilitate Lord Shiva face his adversary Andhakasura. All the Matrikas are depicted in a sitting position known as the Lalitasana and bedecked with heavy jewellery. Scholars state that the concept of Matrikas as powerful goddesses emerged in the early 1st millennium AD, and possibly much earlier.Chakravati, Dhilp (2001).

It is classified as a category 3 station by the Deutsche Bahn.  History  The station was opened on 12 December 1859 by the Bavarian Eastern Railway Company, when the Nuremberg‚ÄìSchwandorf‚ÄìRegensburg route was taken into service. Just under four years later, on 1 October 1863, the Schwandorf‚ÄìWeiden line was opened and, in 1865, it was extended to Eger. The link to Cham was opened on 7 January 1861 and in autumn of that year the line was opened all the way through to Prague via Furth im Wald and Pilsen. The result was that two lines passed through the town, one in a north-south and one in an east-west direction. These lines still exist, although Schwandorf can no longer be called a \\"railwayman's town\\" as used to be the case.  Infrastructure and facilities  The station has eleven main lines of which five are used for passenger services. The home platform and the two island platforms are 38 cm high and do not meet the requirement for barrier-free admission. In the station building, there is a ticket machine, a newsagent, a bakery, and a shop for travellers with a bistro.  Transport links  About a hundred trains runs daily from Schwandorf station.

He is currently music director of the National Arts Centre Orchestra in Ottawa, as well as principal associate conductor of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. Shelley was the unanimous winner of the 2005 Leeds Conductors Competition. From 2009 to 2017 he was chief conductor of the Nuremberg Symphony Orchestra. He is also artistic director of the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen's Echo and Deutsche Gr√ºnderpreis winning \\"Zukunftslabor\\". Background The son of the pianists Howard Shelley OBE and Hilary Macnamara, Shelley learned piano from his mother and cello from his grandmother. In 1992, he won a music scholarship to Westminster School from The Hall School Hampstead. He studied cello with Timothy Hugh, Steven Doane and Johannes Goritzki at the Royal College of Music and at the Robert Schumann Hochschule, D√ºsseldorf respectively. Master-classes with Mstislav Rostropovich, Janos Starker and Aldo Parisot led him to France, Italy and North America. He was a member of the World Orchestra for Peace during the 2003 tour with Valery Gergiev. He studied conducting with Professor Thomas Gabrisch in D√ºsseldorf and worked closely with Yan-Pascal Tortelier as his assistant conductor, among others with the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain. Early career In 2001, while still studying in D√ºsseldorf, he founded the Schumann Camerata, a chamber orchestra with whom he subsequently performed over 80 concerts, including a substantial tour of Russia, with performances in Moscow, Kazan, Simbirsk, Samara, Saratov, Volgograd and Astrachan. In 2005, he won first prize in the 2005 Leeds Conductors Competition, with the press describing him as \\"the most exciting and gifted young conductor to have taken this highly prestigious award. His conducting technique is immaculate, everything crystal clear and a tool to his inborn musicality.\\" In the same year, Shelley conceived the \\"440Hz\\" project, a series of concerts involving prominent German television and stage personalities, to attract young adults to the concert hall. Guest artists have included Konrad Beikircher, G√∂tz Alsmann&Band;, Wise Guys (band), Blank & Jones, BASTA, Ensemble Six, Miki, Curse, Reen, Mellow Mark, Ono, Chima, Marlies Petersen and Ralf Bauer. In 2009, Shelley became Artistic Director of the Zukunftslabor project of the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen with whom he went on to win the 2012 Echo Klassik award in the category of Youth Engagement. Nuremberg Symphony Orchestra In September 2009, Shelley was named the youngest ever Chief Conductor of the Nuremberg Symphony Orchestra, with an initial contract of four years. In 2011, his contract was extended to 2017. During his tenure the orchestra dramatically increased their international touring, travelling to China, Italy, the Czech Republic and Austria. Live recordings of their performances in Vienna's Musikverein and Prague's Smetana Hall were released on Colosseum Records. For nine consecutive years Shelley conducted and presented Nuremberg's ‚ÄòKlassik Open Air‚Äô concerts - Europe's largest annual classical concerts - performing to a combined audience of over 500,000. His final concert was attended by over 80,000 people. He concluded his Nuremberg tenure at the close of the 2016‚Äì2017 season. Shelley's first album for Deutsche Grammophon, with Daniel Hope and the Stockholm Philharmonic, was released in September 2014.

In the spring of 2019, Shelley led the NAC Orchestra on a landmark European tour in celebration of the National Arts Centre's 50th Anniversary. Over 17 days, they travelled to Saffron- Walden, London, Paris, Utrecht, Copenhagen, Stockholm and Gothenburg. The tour marked the first international performances of the NAC Orchestra's flagship Life Reflected project. Entitled CROSSINGS, the tour included eight concerts featuring four internationally renowned Canadian soloists: Jan Lisiecki, James Ehnes, Erin Wall and David D Q Lee. Each and every concert included at least one major work by a Canadian composer. The tour also included 60 learning activities and community events. Wherever they went, Shelley and NAC Orchestra musicians worked with community partners and young musicians to share their passion, make some music, and offer workshops and master classes.

He won the Pulitzer Prize for History in 1924. He was educated at Princeton University and Harvard University and taught at both institutions, as well as the University of Oxford, Miami University, and Bowdoin College. Though he trained as a lawyer, his career was mostly academic, devoted to constitutional history. He was a member of several learned societies and served as President of the American Historical Association in 1935‚Äì1936. Early life and career McIlwain was born March 15, 1871, in Saltsburg, Pennsylvania. In 1894 Princeton University awarded him a bachelor's degree. He then moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he served as a clerk within a law firm while studying the law. In 1897 he was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar in Allegheny County. Though McIlwain remained interested in law through his life, he quickly abandoned his legal career. In 1898 he received a master's degree from Princeton University, and began teaching Latin and history and coaching track and field at the Kiski School in Saltsburg. He left in 1901 to pursue a master's degree at Harvard University. After obtaining the degree in 1903 he began teaching history at Miami University. Academic career In 1905 Woodrow Wilson, then President of Princeton University, instituted a preceptorial system, a modified version of the tutorial system of Oxbridge, at Princeton. After interviewing McIlwain personally, Wilson appointed him to the inaugural group of 45 Princeton preceptors. McIlwain remained at Princeton until 1910, when he left to become the Thomas Brackett Reed Professor of History and Political Science at Bowdoin College. There he published his first book, The High Court of Parliament and Its Supremacy, which caught the attention of fellow historians and led to his appointment in 1911 as an assistant professor of history at Harvard. He was named a full professor of history and government in 1916. McIlwain spent the rest of his academic career at Harvard, where he taught courses on the constitutional history of England and the history of political theory. In 1918 he edited a collection of political treatises and speeches of James VI and I, the king of England, Scotland, and Ireland. In 1923 he published The American Revolution: A Constitutional Interpretation, in which he argued that the American Revolution came about because of a disagreement over the interpretation of the constitution of the United Kingdom. The following year he received the Pulitzer Prize for History for this book. In 1926 he was appointed the Eaton Professor of the Sciences of Government at Harvard. In 1932 he published another book, The Growth of Political Thought in the West. In 1934 he was named a Fellow of the Medieval Academy of America. He served as President of the American Historical Association 1935‚Äì1936. He was also a member of the American Philosophical Society and a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy. In 1940 McIlwain published Constitutionalism: Ancient and Modern, in which he identified government power and an independent judiciary and the countervailing forces underlying constitutionalism. He also discussed the ancient Roman and English roots of United States constitutionalism. He published a revised version of this book in 1947. During 1944 McIlwain served as the George Eastman Visiting Professor at Oxford, the first person named to that post since the start of World War II. At Oxford he was a member of Balliol College. He retired from Harvard in 1946. Later life and legacy McIlwain received honorary doctorates from the University of Chicago in 1941 and Yale University in 1951. He corresponded with the World Federalist Movement's Committee to Frame a World Constitution in the mid-1940s. He died June 1, 1968. In 1986 a preceptorship at Princeton was established in his name.

It is also known as Kosikovsky House, Elisseeff House and Barrikada cinema theater.  Preceding buildings  In 1716-1720, the area between the Moika River and Bolshaya Morskaya Street was the site used to build Mytnyi Dvor (), a project by Georg Johann Mattarnovy and Nicolaus Friedrich Harbel. This building had a two-story gallery and a tower overlooking the Moyka, and it was commonly called Gostiny Dvor () (not to be confused with the modern Gostiny Dvor in Saint Petersburg that was built later, in 1757). It was destroyed in a fire in 1736. After the fire, the site remained empty until 1755, when architect Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli constructed a single-story wooden temporary Winter Palace to be a residence for Empress Elizabeth Petrovna while the new permanent Winter Palace was being built. The palace spanned the entire space from the Moyka River to Malaya and Morskaya streets, occupied today by Chicherin House at Nevsky 15 and Chaplin's House at Nevsky 13. The history of the palace is linked to the history of the first Russian theater. When famous actor Fyodor Volkov was invited to come from Yaroslavl to Saint Petersburg in 1757, he became the director of the Imperial Theater. Performances were held in the palace, in a specially prepared hall. Empress Elizabeth lived in this palace until her death there on December 25, 1762.  Chicherin House  1830s By 1767 the wooden palace had deteriorated so badly that it had to be demolished. Empress Catherine II gave the vacant land to Nikolai Ivanovich Chicherin, a brother of Denis Ivanovich Chicherin, who was commander of the military unit in which Gregory and Alexey Orlov served. The Orlov brothers helped Catherine rise to the power in a coup. After she became empress, Denis Chicherin was appointed governor of Siberia, and Nikolai Chicherin was appointed chief police general of Saint Petersburg. Chicherin ordered a house to be built on the site and a four-story building was constructed in 1768-1771. It is not known for certain who the architect was. It has been suggested that it could have been Vallin de la Mothe, Yury Felten, Alexander Kokorinov or Andrey Kvasov. The nearby Green Bridge across the Moyka river was renamed Police Bridge due to its proximity to the police chief's home. The architecture, in rigorous neoclassical style, is a rare example of the corner of a building forming a semicircular arc. The facade on one street flows smoothly into the facade on the intersecting street, in a united ensemble. Chicherin's family lived in the third floor. The first floor featured various shops including a bookstore. All the other apartments were for rent. One of the tenants in 1780-1783 was Giacomo Quarenghi. In 1778, Saint Petersburg's second music club opened in Chicherin House, where weekly concerts and masquerades were performed. Attendees included Alexander Radishchev, Denis Fonvizin, Ivan Starov and Fedot Shubin. The club was unable to operate at a profit and was closed in 1792.  Kurakin House  In 1792, Chicherin's children sold the property to prince Alexei Kurakin who lived there since 1792. One of the tenants in the Kurakin's house was Mikhail Speransky. Young Speransky impressed Kurakin with help on a business letter, and was immediately offered a job as the prince's scribe. That was the start of Speransky's spectacular career. In 1800-1806 the owner of the house was Abram Peretz, merchant, prominent financier, ship building contractor and salt supplier.  Kosikovsky House  Photo of Chicherin House taken around 1900 From 1806, the ownership passed to merchant Kosikovsky. In 1814-1816 new section of the house was built alongside Bolshaya Morskaya street. Architect Vasily Stasov led this project. The facade of the new section featured twelve columns to commemorate victory in the War of 1812 over Napoleon. In this part of the building, on the first floor Frenchman Pierre Talon open restaurant Talon. Alexander Pushkin used to visit this restaurant, and in his novel in verse Evgeny Onegin he also sent there Onegin himself: Talon was closed in 1825. At the same time, Alexander Pluchart had established Pluchart's Publishing House and bookstore at Kosikovsky House. That's where Nikolai Gogol's Revisor and Russian translation of Goethe's Faust were first printed. The editorial office of Pavel Svinyin's journal Otechestvennye Zapiski was also located at the building. Publisher Nikolai Gretsch lived in house, and decembrist Wilhelm K√ºchelbecker stayed at his place in 1825. In 1820th, Vincenco Madenri had a sculpture workshop in the Kosikovsky house. This was where malachite was used for the first time for interior work. In 1828 Russian writer, composer and diplomat Alexander Griboedov rented an apartment in Kosikovsky house. From here he left to Russian consulate in Tehran, where he was killed by a mob during riots.  Elisseeff House  1906 In 1858 the property was acquired by the Elisseeff brothers - two sons of the merchant Elisseeff - the founder of the Elisseeff Trading House. From 1858 to 1870 the building was reconstructed under the project of Nikolai Grebenka. The shape of windows facing Nevsky Prospekt was partially changed, and new section was built on the Moyka side of the building. The Elisseeff brothers were patrons of the arts, and collectors. All Auguste Rodin's sculptures which are in the Hermitage Museum collection were first collected by the Elisseeff family. In 1860 the Elisseeffs opened a 'Salon' in the house, which existed until 1914. Honorable members of the assembly included Pyotr Vyazemsky, Faddei Bulgarin and others. Here, the writers such as Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Ivan Turgenev and Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin read their works. In 1886 the Elisseeff House hosted the premiere of Modest Mussorgsky's opera Khovanshchina. In January 1862, count Grigory Kushelev-Bezborodko founded a chess club in the Elisseeff House. Club members included Nikolai Chernyshevsky and Dmitri Mendeleev. However, the police started to get reports, that club members engage in political discussions about constitution and revolution, Chernyshevsky makes speeches, and there is no playing chess. In March of the same year police closed the club.  House of Arts  After 1917 October Revolution, most members of the Elisseeff family fled from Russia. They, however, did not believe that the new rule would last long, so they left everything behind them. The legend has it that they hid most of their treasures in the walls of the house. These treasures were never found. In 1919-1923, Maxim Gorky established House of Arts in the former Elisseeff House. Following fashionable then modernism, it was abbreviated as DISK (from Russian Dom Iskustv - House of Arts). At times of Russian Civil War and post war devastation, apartments were provided artists, writers, poets and composers such as Viktor Shklovsky, Osip Mandelstam, Alexander Grin (who wrote the novel Scarlet Sails here), Olga Forsh (who wrote the novel Palace and Prison here). Korney Chukovsky, Mikhail Zoshchenko, Robert Rozhdestvensky, Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin worked here. House of Arts hosted poet studio led by Nikolay Gumilyov. This is where he was arrested on August 3, 1921 and later executed. During these difficult years the book printing was very limited, and House of Arts plays important role in the cultural life of the city through Literature Evenings. These were gathering where Alexander Blok, Maxim Gorky, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Andrei Bely, Anna Achmatova, Fyodor Sologub and Herbert Wells participated and read their works. Olga Forsh described the life in House of Arts in her novel Crazy Ship.  Barrikada  In 1923, the cinema theater Light ribbon was opened in the building. In 1931 it was renamed as Barrikada. During the 1920s, the young Dmitri Shostakovich, then a student at Leningrad Conservatory, worked as a pianist accompanying the silent films. However, he didn't last long at this job. He was fired as he was distracting the audience from the films with his piano playing. Barrikada remained open even during the Siege of Leningrad. It was screening war documentaries and pre-war movies. The fact that the cinema stayed open during the siege became an important symbol for the city, as well as a source of information. Barrikada operated until the late 1980s. By then the deteriorated condition of the building forced its closure. In 1998 the money for repairs were found and the theatre was open again. In 2006 the building was closed for 'reconstruction'. However, in June 2007, it became known that the historical building was demolished. In place of the original building, a new one was erected, looking similar to the Chicherin House. It is believed that the building had to be re-constructed to allow for a swimming pool to be installed on the roof for the guests staying at the lucrative hotel. The original interiors of the building have been lost in this reconstruction.

In the spring of 1922 a power struggle led to his being accused of conspiring to overthrow the revolutionary government. He was arrested and executed along with prime minister Bodoo on August 31, 1922. Early life and career Chagdarjav was born in 1880 in present-day Selenge Province. He was a member of the quasi-provisional government established in Kh√ºree in 1911 as Manchu control over the country collapsed and was later appointed Minister of Finance under the Bogd Khan's first government. He took part in negotiations during the Kyakhta Conference in which Mongolia sought international recognition of its status as an independent state, but ultimately had to settle for recognition of a de facto autonomy under Chinese auspices. Leaving government service in 1915, Chagdarjav pursued a career as a private trader traveling to Great Britain, Italy and Russia in 1916-1917.Sanders, Alan J. K., Historical Dictionary of Mongolia, 2010, . p. 143 =Formation of the MPRP= In 1919 Chagdarjav joined the secret revolutionary group Konsulyn Denj (Consulate Hill) in Kh√ºree (present-day Ulaanbaatar). Together with Dogsomyn Bodoo, Khorloogiin Choibalsan, and Darizavyn Losol he formed the basic nucleus of the groupBaabar 1999, pg 198 which joined with Damdin S√ºkhbaatar's Z√º√ºn H√ºree organization in June 1920 to form the Mongolian People's Party (MPP).Baabar 1999, p. 199 Chagdrajav was one of seven revolutionaries (the famous \\"First Seven\\") chosen to travel to the USSR in June 1920 to establish contact with the Soviets. Other delegates included Soliin Danzan, Dansrabilegiin Dogsom, Damdin S√ºkhbaatar, Khorloogiin Choibalsan, Dogsomyn Bodoo and Darizavyn Losol. Chagdrajav and Danzan traveled together to Moscow where they met with Vladimir Lenin. Head of Provisional Government Chagdarjav was appointed prime minister of the provisional revolutionary government established at a secret MPP meeting in the Russian- Mongolian border town of Troitskosavsk from March 1‚Äì3, 1921 (later known as the First Party Congress of the MPRP).Baabar, B., 1999, pp 216 However, just over a month later, on April 16, 1921 he was relieved of his duties and dispatched as the party's representative to Urianhay (Tuva).Sanders 1996, p. 27 Bodoo then took over as both Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. Death Soon after the victory of the Outer Mongolian Revolution of 1921, strife erupted within the party as various factions jockeyed for power, particularly between Soliin Danzan and Prime Minister Bodoo. In 1922, Danzan accused Bodoo, Chagdarjav and others of plotting with the charismatic independence leader Ja Lama as well as with the Chinese and Americans, to undermine the revolution and establish an autocratic government. Despite Bodoo's resignation from government on January 7, 1922,Baabar 1999, p. 231 Danzan nevertheless pursued the charges.

Tetsuya Nomura created Rikku, and the character is voiced by Marika Matsumoto in Japanese and by Tara Strong in English. Rikku first appears in Final Fantasy X as one of its protagonists, where she accompanies her cousin Yuna and others on a journey to defeat the monster Sin. Rikku again appears as a protagonist in the games direct sequel, 'Final Fantasy X-2. In that game, she, Yuna, and new friend Paine journey to find missing Final Fantasy X protagonist Tidus. Square originally planned to make Rikku the protagonist of her own game, but the developer canceled the idea. In order to make a game revolving around a group of female heroes, Final Fantasy X-2's protagonists became Yuna, Paine, and Rikku. To reflect the changing social mores between game titles, Rikku wears much more casual and minimal clothing in Final Fantasy X-2 than the games' predecessor. Rikku generally received a positive reception, with her Final Fantasy X-2 design receiving praise for its attractiveness. Some critics have considered her attire to be fan service, and her character development thin. Most fans, however, have expressed positive views of her cheerful and bubbly personality. The character has appeared on many lists of fans' favorite Final Fantasy characters. Concept and creation Rikku first appeared in Final Fantasy X. Tetsuya Nomura designed her as a 15-year-old Al Bhed girl. She is Cid's daughter and Brother's younger sister. After the game's release, the video game press reported that she might get her own game, code-named \\"Rikku Version\\". However, this was later confirmed to not be in the works. Rikku, along with Yuna, were the leads Final Fantasy X-2 and were the only characters from Final Fantasy X to appear. Developers chose her in order to create a game that centered on women. Tetsu Tsukamoto, the designer of Final Fantasy X-2s \\"alternate\\" costumes, explained that Rikku's outfit was the product of a cultural change in Spira, the world Rikku inhabits. The staff also wished to make that cast seem more physically active. Rikku is voiced by Marika Matsumoto in Japanese and by Tara Strong in English. Strong was offered an audition by Final Fantasy X casting director Jack Fletcher. Before her audition, the Fletcher gave Strong recordings of the Japanese version of Rikku and a description of the character. Many of Strongs lines ended with \\"you know\\" in order to match the English dub with the character's mouth movements, particularly to end the sentence with a vowel sound. They decided to make this a vocal tic for her. Appearances Rikku first appears in Final Fantasy X as one of its protagonists. She helps Tidus when he first arrives as a stranger in Spira, but then she disappears during an attack from the monster Sin. Upon meeting Tidus again at the Moonflow, she becomes the last character to join her cousin Yuna's entourage of guardians. Rikku's attitude is somewhat childish but is mostly quite cheerful and positive. She does occasionally suffer from instances of anxiety. This feeling originates from being attacked by a fiend on a beach when she was young; her brother then tried to destroy it with a Thunder spell. However, he missed and electrocuted her instead. Cid's sister married Braska, which makes Braska Rikku's uncle. This relationship also makes Rikku Yuna's cousin. Rikku wishes to prevent Yuna from going through with her summoner pilgrimage as she will die in the process of defeating Sin. Rikku returns in Final Fantasy X-2 once again as a protagonist, now 17 years old. She is also the one who convinces Yuna to leave the land of Besaid and go on a journey along with their new friend Paine. Rikku convinces Yuna by showing her a mysterious sphere featuring a person resembling Yuna's lost love, Tidus. Rikku appears in the game Theatrhythm Final Fantasy: Curtain Call as a playable character. Her appearance resembles a chibi-esque version of her Final Fantasy X-2 character. She also appears alongside Yuna and Paine in Kingdom Hearts II as a miniature fairy version of herself wearing modified versions of her Final Fantasy X-2 attire. The game Itadaki Street Special features a miniature Rikku also in her Final Fantasy X-2 outfit, along with Yuna and Paine. Rikku also appears as a character in the game World of Final Fantasy. =Merchandise= Rikku, along with characters Paine and Yuna, received a series of singles performed by Marika Matsumoto in a collection called \\"Final Fantasy X-2 Vocal Collection - Rikku\\". The three characters also had figurines produced by Play Arts. They were the first figurines Play Arts produced in-house. Various manufacturers also released figurines of Rikku, including Square Soft, Coca-Cola, Bandai, Hobby Japan, Square Enix, and Kotobukiya, and Amono Shiro. Game accessory maker Hori also released a special PlayStation memory card in 2003. Reception alt= Rikku has received generally positive reception since appearing in Final Fantasy X and X-2. Final Fantasy fans voted her the 13th best female Final Fantasy character. Famitsu readers ranked her as one of the best video game characters. She has been identified as one of the most attractive female characters in and outside of the series by IGN, Play, UGO, and G4TV readers. Complex identified her outfit as the main reason to play Final Fantasy X-2. Houston Press expressed disappointment that the story of Final Fantasy X focused so much on Tidus, noting how much more interesting the relationship between Rikku and Yuna was. Game Informer identified her as a character they would like to be around due to an abundance of positive energy. Digitally Downloaded enjoyed her character as well, noting she was their ideal rogue and praised her for her uplifting attitude. They also found her a highlight of Final Fantasy X and hoped to see her in Dissidia Final Fantasy. Game Informer was critical of the sexualization of Rikku, noting her as being underage. Digitally Downloaded noted that her outfit in Final Fantasy X-2 was fan service. They also noted, however, that it was story-related as it demonstrated the liberation of her society from restrictive rules between games. Despite enjoying her \\"bubbly personality\\" in the face of hardships, they felt that there was not much depth to her character, and that people were too focused on her outfit. CNET felt Rikku was a highly underrated character, though noting that she was mostly known for her outfit and \\"being scared\\" than her engineering prowess. Tara Strong was awarded \\"Outstanding Achievement in Character Performance -- Female\\" for her portrayal of Rikku by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences. Game Informer identified Rikku as one of Strong's most notable roles.

It was built in 1913 as a stop for the Western Maryland Railway (WM). The building was operated as a passenger station until the WM ended service in 1959, and it continued to be used by the railway until 1976. It was subsequently restored and currently serves as a museum and offices, as well as the operating base for a heritage railway. Description The station was designed by Baltimore architect C. M. Anderson, and sited on a filled-in basin at the terminus of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal.Amtrak, Washington, D.C. \\"Great American Stations: Cumberland, MD.\\" Accessed 2012-05-16. The building is a large commercial-style building that expresses the architectural functionalism of the turn of the 20th century. The brick structure is nine bays long and three bays wide, with two monumental stories on the west facade and three stories on the east. A one-story platform shelter runs along the west facade and extends out toward the tracks. History The WM began daily through-train passenger service between Baltimore and Chicago, by way of Cumberland, on June 15, 1913. For several years the premier trains on the route, the Chicago Limited and Baltimore Limited, featured Pullman sleeping car service. Other WM trains ran between Cumberland and Elkins, West Virginia. The number and variety of passenger trains decreased through the years of the Great Depression and afterward. The WM ended its passenger train service between Cumberland and Baltimore in 1953, and the Cumberland-Elkins trains ended in 1959. The WM used the upper floors of the station for its Western Division offices, and a control tower, even after the railroad's absorption into the Chessie System, until the dispatchers were reassigned in 1976. The building slowly fell into disrepair, and Chessie leased it, and later sold it to the Kelly Tire Company to store tires. The City of Cumberland subsequently bought the building for one dollar. Restoration With the advent of the initiative in Cumberland to create a scenic railroad using the former WM trackage north out of the city, the station was partially restored in 1990. Full restoration did not begin, however, until the creation of the Canal Place Preservation and Development Authority in 1996.Canal Place Preservation and Development Authority, Cumberland, MD. \\"Canal History/Future Plans.\\" Accessed 2012-05-16. This restoration created a museum area for the National Park Service on the first floor; a waiting area, gift shop, and cafe on the second floor; and office spaces on the third and fourth floors. Exterior work included the construction of an elevator tower; third, display track; a second platform; handicapped passenger accessibility ramp; and the restoration of the platform shelters, WM employee memorial, and the pedestrian railroad underpass. Today the building is part of a preservation district called Canal Place, a facility operated by the Canal Place Preservation and Development Authority. The station houses offices of the Authority, the Western Maryland Scenic Railroad, a visitors center for the C&O; Canal National Historic Park, and leased offices to local officials and businesses.

The entranceway was through a tile-roofed projecting pavilion (the center leg of the \\"E\\") containing a terra cotta fountain with a dolphin motif. The first floor had raised bricks every ninth course or so, giving the appearance of rustication. Different bonds of brick (including American bond and English bond) were used throughout to add textural interest. Fanlike terra cotta motifs were inserted above second floor windows. Cartouches of terra cotta were placed between the top-floor windows, and decorative terra cotta eave brackets were beneath the roof. Three-sided multi-paned bay windows projected into the courtyard. The interior of the building originally held 102 apartments. Decorative elements included wood frame moldings and hallway cornices with leaf motifs.

He was introduced as the protagonist of the role-playing video game, Final Fantasy X, in 2001 as a 17-year-old expert in the fictional sport of blitzball from the city of Zanarkand. After a mysterious creature named Sin attacks his hometown, Tidus is apparently transported to the world of Spira. Shortly after his arrival he meets Yuna, a mage and her guardians. The group will soon set out on a pilgrimage to destroy the creature which attacked Tidus' city; by joining them, Tidus hopes to find his way home. He has appeared in other video games, including the Final Fantasy X sequel Final Fantasy X-2, the Kingdom Hearts series, and several Square Enix crossover games. Tidus was designed by Tetsuya Nomura with a cheerful appearance, in contrast to previous Final Fantasy protagonists. Scenario writer Kazushige Nojima wanted to expand the relationship between player and character with monologues describing the game's setting. Tidus is voiced primarily by Masakazu Morita in Japanese and James Arnold Taylor in English. Both actors enjoyed voicing the character, and Morita also performed his motion capture. He has been generally well received by video-game critics. Tidus' cheerful personality and heroic traits make him an appealing protagonist, contrasting with previous male characters in the franchise. His character development and romantic relationship with Yuna are considered among the best in video games, although reviewers and fans were divided on Taylor's voicing. Tidus has been popular with fans, often ranking as one of the best Final Fantasy characters in polls. Action figures and Tidus-related jewelry have been produced, and he is a popular cosplay character.  Creation and development  According to Yoshinori Kitase, Tidus and Yuna's romance was a focus of Final Fantasy X. Before the development of Final Fantasy X, game scenario writer Kazushige Nojima was concerned about the relationship between the player and the main character in a Final Fantasy title and wanted to try to make the story easier to follow. Since the player and the main character find themselves in a new world, Nojima wanted Tidus' understanding of that world to track the player's progress in the game. Nojima felt that Tidus was the easiest character to draw in the first half of Final Fantasy X, because character and player learn about the storyline together. Nojima created a brief description of Tidus for character designer Tetsuya Nomura, and Nomura created a sketch for input from Nojima and other staff members. Nomura was asked to design Tidus differently from the game's theme so he would stand out. Movie director Hiroshi Kuwabara noted the difficulty the developers had in making Tidus and the other main characters realistic. The staff wanted to use an undead person as a playable character, and Tidus was meant to be that character. During Final Fantasy X development, however, Nojima saw a film with a similar idea for its protagonist. The role of an undead person was then given to a secondary character, Auron. Nomura mentioned the contrast between the lead male and female protagonists established by their names; Tidus' name is based on the Okinawan word for \\"sun\\", and Yuna's name means \\"night\\" in Okinawan. The contrast is also indicated by the items required to empower their celestial weapons: the sun sigil and crest for Tidus, and the moon sigil and crest for Yuna. The developers had difficulty with Tidus and Yuna's kissing scene, since they were unaccustomed to animating romantic scenes. According to Visual Works director Kazuyuki Ikumori, this was due to the use of 3D models, and it was revised several times due to a negative response from female staff members. Director Yoshinori Kitase said that in the development of Final Fantasy X, one of the staff's main objectives was to focus on the romance between Tidus and Yuna. Nojima said that he cried during the game's ending, when Tidus and Yuna separate and Tidus vanishes. Designer Nomura said that he wanted Tidus' clothing and accessories to suggest a relationship with the sea. Tidus' clothing has a distinctive blue motif; his blitzball team logo, based on a fish hook, is an amalgam of the letters \\"J\\" and \\"T\\" (the first letters of Tidus' name and that of his father, Jecht). Because a player can change Tidus' name, the character is not referred to by name in audible dialogue; however, a character in Dream Zanarkand uses Tidus' name in a dialogue box. The only other in-game appearance of his name is \\"Tidu\\" in Spiran script on the nameplate of an Auroch locker in the Luca stadium. Before Final Fantasy Xs release, Tidus was known to the media as Tida. In early 2001, PlayOnline changed the character's name to \\"Tidus\\". Because his name is never spoken in Final Fantasy X, its intended pronunciation has been debated. Interviews with James Arnold Taylor and spoken dialogue in the English versions of Dissidia Final Fantasy, Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy, and Kingdom Hearts (with cameo appearances by the character) indicate that it is pronounced (); in the English version of Kingdom Hearts II, Tidus' name is pronounced (). According to Taylor, it was pronounced during the localization of Final Fantasy X because the narrator of an early English trailer pronounced it that way. For the sequel, Final Fantasy X-2, producer Kitase thought that the greatest fan expectation was for the reunion of Tidus and Yuna after their separation in the first game. The game generated rumors about Tidus' connection with the villain, Shuyin, who was physically similar and had the same actors. Square responded that such a storyline, given Tidus' nature, would be too complicated. For the remastering of Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2, producer Kitase's motivation was to have people too young to have played the games experience them; his son was only old enough to know the characters of Tidus and Yuna from Dissidia Final Fantasy and its prequel. = Personality = According to Nomura, he wanted to give Tidus a cheerful persona and appearance after designing serious, moody main characters for Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII. He wanted to continue the recent trend of sky-related names, and Kazushige Nojima chose a name based on tiida (Okinawan for \\"sun\\"). Nojima called Tidus' personality \\"lively\\" and compared him to Final Fantasy VIIIs Laguna Loire and Zell Dincht, two other cheerful characters. Tidus was initially a rude plumber who was part of a delinquent gang, but Kitase said he would be a weak protagonist and he was made an athlete instead. His relationship with his father was based on \\"stories throughout the ages, such as the ancient Greek legends\\" and would reveal the key to the weakness of Sin, the game's main antagonist. Kitase noted that, in contrast to previous orphan characters seen in the franchise, Tidus' character arc included accepting Jecht's seeking redemption for Tidus' child abuse. Kitase felt that the voice acting and facial expression were crucial to Tidus at this stage. Motomu Toriyama said that when Final Fantasy X was released, he saw the story from Tidus' point of view: \\"about parent, child and family\\". =Voice actors= Masakazu Morita voiced Tidus in Japanese. He called the character a career highlight, comparable to his voicing of Bleach manga protagonist Ichigo Kurosaki. Morita also enjoyed performing Tidus' motion capture, which gave him a greater understanding of the character's personality; when he recorded Tidus' dialogue for the game, he moved his body. Morita said that Tidus was his favorite, calling him \\"the most outstanding, most special character to me\\". As his first work as an actor, he has fond memories of voicing Tidus and interacting with other Final Fantasy X staff members. Morita said that there was no difficulty in working as Tidus, since the character's personality was similar to his own, and he did not need to study the character. However, he was concerned that if fans did not enjoy Tidus it would impact his career. When it announced the Japanese actor, Square said that Morita was chosen because he also did the motion capture for Zell (which would make fans remember previous games). Across Final Fantasy X there are also flashback scenes which depict a seven-year old Tidus. For these scenes Tidus is instead voiced by Y≈´to Nakamura. For the fighting game Dissidia Final Fantasy, Morita returned to voice Tidus. He was concerned about being able to perform the character's lines like the original Final Fantasy series, since it had been nearly a decade since he voiced Tidus. By that time, he was also more accustomed to acting as Ichigo and Keiji Maeda from Capcom's Sengoku Basara hack-and-slash games and the characters had a different vocal tone than Tidus'. When Moriata returned to voice Tidus, he tried to make it match his original performance. When the game director complimented Morita for keeping the character's tone, Morita was relieved and joked that he felt younger. alt=A blond man wearing a short black shirt James Arnold Taylor was Tidus' English-language voice. Taylor was offered the role by voice director Jack Fletcher (who believed that he would fit the character), and translator Alexander O. Smith explained Tidus to him. In contrast to Morita, Taylor made the character friendlier and less serious with the staff's approval. After recording Final Fantasy X, Taylor said that he would enjoy voicing Tidus again; the character was \\"like an old friend to me now. I know so much more about him now than I did when we first started, knowing hardly anything about him. I would really hate it if anybody else voiced him\\". Recording the game took Taylor three-and-a-half months, and he enjoyed the experience. According to Taylor, it would be unrealistic for Tidus to hide emotion. He said that although there were things he would change about his performance (such as the scene where Tidus and Yuna begin laughing together), he was grateful for the warm fan reception of his work. Smith felt that the forced-laugh scene was adapted well from the original Japanese scene, because of how \\"stilted and out of place\\" it was in the original version. Smith was confused by Morita and Mayuko Aoki's performance, but after discussing it with Nojima he found it well done in both languages and called it \\"awkward\\" and \\"funny\\". When Final Fantasy X was re-released in 2013, Taylor said that he was proud to be Tidus' voice. For Dissidia NT, Taylor commented that while Tidus' new role would seem new to players due to how he is led once again into battle, people would still find him as an appealing new trait.  Appearances  = Final Fantasy X series = In Final Fantasy X, Tidus is a player in the underwater sport of blitzball in an advanced, technological version of Zanarkand. Belying his cheerful, carefree attitude, Tidus hates his absent father, Jecht‚Äîinitially because of his mother's neglect, and later for their rivalry at blitzball. During a blitzball tournament, Zanarkand is destroyed by a huge, shrouded creature known as Sin. Sin transports Tidus and Jecht's friend, Auron, to the world of Spira. After his arrival on Spira, Tidus drifts to the island of Besaid and joins a number of guardians on a journey to help Yuna defeat Sin. Tidus joins them in the hope of finding his way home. When he meets Auron, Tidus learns that Jecht and Auron made the same pilgrimage ten years before to protect the summoner Braska (Yuna's father) and defeated Sin (who was reborn as Jecht). As the journey continues, Tidus, losing hope that he will return home, begins a romantic relationship with Yuna and swears not to let her die after the guardians tell him that Sin's battle will kill her. When the party approaches Zanarkand, Tidus learns that he and Zanarkand are the dreams of dead people known as fayth. \\"Dream\\" Zanarkand was created when Sin was born during the war between Zanarkand and Bevelle and the original Zanarkand was destroyed. If Sin is permanently defeated, the summoning of Dream Zanarkand and its people (including Tidus) will cease. In the real Zanarkand, the group decides to find a way to destroy Sin which does not require the sacrifice of a guardian or a summoner. They attack Sin, entering its shell. They eventually find Jecht (whom they must defeat to eliminate Sin), and Tidus makes peace with his father in the aftermath. After defeating the spirit of Yu Yevon (who is responsible for Sin's rebirth), the fayth are allowed to leave and the summoning of Dream Zanarkand ends. As he vanishes, Tidus says goodbye to his friends and joins the spirits of Auron, Jecht and Braska in the afterlife. Tidus makes few appearances in the plot of the 2003 sequel, Final Fantasy X-2, although meeting him is the player's objective. Two years after the events of Final Fantasy X, Yuna sees a sphere with a young man (resembling Tidus) trapped in a prison. She joins the Gullwings, a sphere-hunting group, and travels around Spira in the hope of finding more clues that Tidus is alive. The individual in the sphere is later revealed as Shuyin. Depending on the player's development during the game, the fayth will appear to Yuna at the end and tell her that they can make Tidus return to her. He then appears in Spira, and he and Yuna are reunited. In another final scene, Tidus (unsure whether or not he is still a dream) wants to remain with Yuna. He is also an unlockable character as Star Player, a blitzball player. In Final Fantasy X-2: International + Last Mission (the game's updated version), Tidus is a playable character for battles. An extra episode, set after the original game's play- through, reveals that he is living in Besaid with Yuna. An illusion of Tidus also appears as a boss character. Tidus' dialogue, monologues and songs were included on the Final Fantasy X Vocal Collection and feel/Go dream: Yuna & Tidus CDs. Although he does not fully understand that he is not the fayth dream, Tidus feels that disappearing would be preferable to making Yuna cry again. The novel Final Fantasy X-2.5 ~Eien no Daishou~, set after Final Fantasy X-2, explores Tidus and Yuna's visit to Besaid Island 1,000 years before. The HD remastered version of Final Fantasy X and Final Fantasy X-2, Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster, adds an audio drama (Final Fantasy X: Will) in which Tidus is a new blitzball star who appears to be concealing an injury. After Yuna breaks up with him, Tidus helps her on a quest to defeat a reborn Sin. Tetsuya Nomura made a revision of Tidus's design for this game, hinting it will be used in a possible Final Fantasy X-3. = Other appearances = He also appears in games outside the Final Fantasy X fictional universe, and a younger version is a friend of the protagonists Sora and Riku in the Kingdom Hearts series. In Kingdom Hearts, Tidus appears with younger versions of Wakka and Final Fantasy VIIIs Selphie as an optional sparring opponent. The character makes a cameo appearance in Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, and is mentioned briefly in Kingdom Hearts II. A digital replica of Tidus is a boss character in Kingdom Hearts Coded, and he appears with Auron and Yuna in the board game-based Itadaki Street Special. In Dissidia Final Fantasy (an action game with several Final Fantasy heroes and villains), Tidus is the hero from Final Fantasy X: a warrior from the goddess, Cosmos, whose father works for the rival god Chaos. Tidus has two uniforms in this game, and his thoughts and actions refer to Final Fantasy X. With the cast, he reappears in the prequel Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy and represents Chaos in the previous war. Tidus is confronted by Yuna and offers his life to save her from an attack by the villain Emperor, but is saved by Jecht to become a warrior of Cosmos. In addition to his previous outfits, Tidus has a design based on an illustration by Square artist Yoshitaka Amano. He appears in the third entry in the series, Dissidia Final Fantasy NT. Tidus is a playable character in the Theatrhythm Final Fantasy rhythm game. He also appears in World of Final Fantasy, and Fortune Street: Dragon Quest & Final Fantasy 30th Anniversary. Tidus' disappearance between Final Fantasy X and its sequel is also explained in the game Mobius Final Fantasy. Trapped in an underworld-like place known as Palamecia, Tidus joins forces with a warrior known as Wol. The two join on a quest to become fully Warrior of Light though Tidus uses as a distraction since he does not care about his own well-being, satisfied with his actions in Spira. After seeing one of Yuna's creatures disappear from Palamecia, Tidus decides to search for a way to return to Spira. Following more battles, Tidus finds a crystal which allows him to be teleported back to the world. His latest appearance is in the mobile phone game Final Fantasy Explorers-Force  Reception  =Critical= Tidus had a positive reception in video-game publications. Raymon Padilla of GameSpy called him a \\"garishly dressed Leonardo DiCaprio\\", whose his flaws make him appealing. According to GameSpot reviewer Greg Kasavin, players might not initially like the character but would eventually find him \\"suitably endearing\\". Kasavin wrote that Tidus had the \\"surprising depth\\" characteristic of past Final Fantasy protagonists, and called the game's ending \\"emotionally charged and satisfying\\". PSXextreme's Arnold Katayev liked Tidus' easygoing personality, contrasting it with those of previous (antisocial) Final Fantasy protagonists. Atlus character designer Kazuma Kaneko called him \\"a dashing lead character\\". GameZone praised Tidus' role as the male lead compared with previous characters for its \\"perpetual feel of youth and innocence\\". In the book, Dungeons, Dragons, and Digital Denizens: The Digital Role-Playing Game, authors Gerald A. Voorhees and Joshua Call compared Tidus with Final Fantasy VII protagonist Cloud Strife in appearance and weapon; however, they found Tidus more realistic than Cloud. In Console video games and global corporations, Mia Consalvo that despite Tidus was designed from a Western's perspective which contrasted the others' Eastern designs, the game managed to blend their looks and appeal to the audience. Although the revelation of his true nature in the game's ending was third on 1UP.com's list of top-five video-game spoilers (reducing \\"at least two 1UP staffers to a state of misty-eyed mourning\\"), Tidus' resurrection in the sequel was called unrealistic. GamesRadar's Dave Meikleham found the character's fate in the first game confusing; he appears to be alive in the epilogue despite his disappearance, which is not explained until the sequel's end. Matthew Walker of Cheat Code Central wrote that Tidus told his father he hated him in the climax, but later appreciated him. Kotaku also noted that despite Tidus being a victim of child abuse due to Jecht's misbehaviour, the two characters developed in the story, making up in the end. According to Walker, the game's final scene was intended to give hope that Tidus was alive; Walker found the ending (where Sin's defeat makes Tidus disappear) sad. The character was compared to Squall Leonhart, the protagonist of Final Fantasy VIII. The staff of IGN noted differences in appearance between them, contrasting Squall's dark-colored outfit and \\"permanent mope\\" with Tidus' brighter outfit and weapon and \\"an indelible grin\\". Kurt Kalata of Gamasutra found Tidus a more entertaining character than Squall, albeit \\"a bit whiny\\". GameSpot criticized his English-language voicing, saying that they would have preferred \\"an almost-mute lead character, a la Squall\\". 1UP found him the worst-dressed video-game character, citing Nomura's \\"deal with it\\" outfit design; despite the \\"preposterous\\" design, Square could \\"successfully sell\\" Tidus as Final Fantasy Xs main protagonist. In the English-language version, IGN said that the character \\"has a tendency to speak a little too high and fast when he gets excited\\". Andrew Long of RPGamer criticized James Arnold Taylor's work, saying that Tidus is supposed to sound \\"impulsive and energetic\\" but his dialogue is \\"stupid and childish\\". Eurogamer's Tom Brawell agreed, calling Tidus' voice \\"whiny\\" and \\"detestable\\". Despite his dislike of the voice acting, Chris Carter of Destructoid enjoyed playing as Tidus in the crossover fighting game Dissidia Final Fantasy and looked forward to its reboot. On the other hand, PSXextreme liked Taylor's work in voicing Tidus. In the book Gaming Lives in the Twenty-First Century, the writers recalled that Tidus' characterization differs in the original Japanese release of Final Fantasy X and its English dub; the localized version failed to emulate the original Tidus. In a Final Fantasy X scene, Yuna tells Tidus to laugh (to cheer him up) and Tidus forces a laugh. Although fans criticised the laughter as too forced, Taylor stated that it was an intentionally \\"awkward, goofy, dumb laugh.\\" The relationship between Tidus and Yuna was listed as one of the video-game \\"great loves\\" by GameSpot, which called it \\"one of the best (and ultimately saddest) examples\\" of mature romance in games and cited its progression through the story as one of the game's best elements. GamesRadar found the relationship realistic, noting that they still try to reunite despite their sacrifices. Kotaku's Mike Fahey wrote that the popularity of Tidus and Yuna's relationship and his fading away at the game's end forced Square to make a sequel so they could meet again. Gamasutra's Leigh Alexander, calling Tidus a \\"forgettable hero\\", nevertheless praised his and Yuna's relationship. In 2001, Tidus and Yuna won Game Informer Best Couple of the Year award. Their kiss was ranked the second-best in video games by Lisa Foiles of The Escapist. Kotaku called the scene one of gaming's most romantic, and IGN listed Tidus and Luna as one of gaming's greatest couples. Yuna's English voice actress, Hedy Burress, said that Tidus' interaction with Yuna gave her a humanized, \\"womanly aspect\\". The 1UP.com staff described Tidus as the \\"good kind of jock\\" because of his support for the game's other protagonists, but his anger and growth kept him from being a \\"stereotypical boy scout\\". According to Eurogamer's Tom Brawell, Tidus and the other characters \\"make much more dignified and believable decisions than those made by their predecessors in other Final Fantasy games\\". NowGamer and Digital Spy found the remastered game lacking in emotion, but Destructoid said that its models still look good in comparison to newer role-playing games released. =Popularity= The older Tidus from Will has highly popular within gamers of Dissdia NT according to its director although Nomura claimed they could not use it in the game until the release of another Final Fantasy X sequel. Tidus' character has also appeared in popularity polls and features in video-game publications. He was Final Fantasy X second-most-popular character (behind Auron) in a fan poll. Complex listed him as the second-best Final Fantasy character, surpassed only by Cloud. His caring, cheerful personality (contrasting with previous Final Fantasy protagonists) was praised. GameZone ranked Tidus the third-best Final Fantasy character (behind Cloud and Sephiroth, also from Final Fantasy VII), and Heath Hooker called him \\"a complete mixture of everything cheesy and everything emotional\\". Tidus was the fourth-most-popular male Final Fantasy character in a 2012 Square Enix poll. In a Famitsu poll, Tidus was voted the 20th-best video-game character in Japan. Christian Nutt of GamesRadar wrote that despite initial issues, Tidus' character development during the game made him more likable; Nutt ranked him the fourth-best Final Fantasy hero. Tidus and Yuna were included in The Inquirers list of most memorable video-game couples, with Tidus' self- sacrifice and their farewell noted. To commemorate the franchise's 20th anniversary, Square released figurines of Tidus and other Final Fantasy protagonists. In 2020, Tidus was also voted as the seventh best character in the entire Final Fantasy franchise in a Japanese poll by NHK. According to Square Enix producer Shinji Hashimoto, Tidus cosplay has been popular. The character has also inspired action figures and jewelry. For the first two X games' rerelease, Nomura redesigned Tidus based on his older appearance from the audiodrama Will. For the franchise's 30th anniversary, Square presented Tidus' new design in a museum. Director Takeo Kujiraoka from Dissidia NT noted that the staff received multiple requests by fans to include Tidus' Will look as an alternative design but Nomura said it was not possible as the company would first need to develop Final Fantasy X-3.

If lightning hits the structure, it will preferentially strike the rod and be conducted to ground through a wire, instead of passing through the structure, where it could start a fire or cause electrocution. Lightning rods are also called finials, air terminals, or strike termination devices. In a lightning protection system, a lightning rod is a single component of the system. The lightning rod requires a connection to earth to perform its protective function. Lightning rods come in many different forms, including hollow, solid, pointed, rounded, flat strips, or even bristle brush-like. The main attribute common to all lightning rods is that they are all made of conductive materials, such as copper and aluminum. Copper and its alloys are the most common materials used in lightning protection.Copper lightning protection systems save lives, billions; Building and Architectural News, #80, Winter 1995;  History  The principle of the lightning rod was first detailed by Prokop Divi≈° in P≈ô√≠mƒõtice in 1753. Divi≈° worked like a lightning rod Nevyansk Tower in Russia crowned with a metallic rod grounded through a complex system of rebars (some are seen at the basement) Franklin's earliest papers on electricityI. Bernard Cohen, The Two Hundredth Anniversary of Benjamin Franklin's Two Lightning Experiments and the Introduction of the Lightning Rod, in: Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, Vol. 96, No. 3. (Jun. 20, 1952), pp. 331‚Äì366. Hemingray insulator As buildings become taller, lightning becomes more of a threat. Lightning can damage structures made of most materials, such as masonry, wood, concrete, and steel, because the huge currents and voltages involved can heat materials to high temperature. The heat causes a potential for structure fire. = Russia = A lightning conductor may have been intentionally used in the Leaning Tower of Nevyansk. The spire of the tower is crowned with a metallic rod in the shape of a gilded sphere with spikes. This lightning rod is grounded through the rebar carcass, which pierces the entire building. The Nevyansk Tower was built between 1721 and 1745, on the orders of industrialist Akinfiy Demidov. The Nevyansk Tower was built 28 years before Benjamin Franklin's experiment and scientific explanation. However, the true intent behind the metal rooftop and rebars remains unknown. = Europe = The church tower of many European cities, which was usually the highest structure in the city, was likely to be hit by lightning. Early on, Christian churches tried to prevent the occurrence of the damaging effects of lightning by prayers. Peter Ahlwardts (\\"Reasonable and Theological Considerations about Thunder and Lightning\\", 1745) advised individuals seeking cover from lightning to go anywhere except in or around a church.Seckel, Al, and John Edwards, \\"Franklin's Unholy Lightning Rod \\". 1984. There is an ongoing debate over whether a \\"metereological machine\\", invented by Premonstratensian priest Prokop Divi≈° and erected in P≈ô√≠mƒõtice near Znojmo, Moravia (now Czech Republic) in June 1754, does count as an individual invention of the lightning rod. Divi≈°'s apparatus was, according to his private theories, aimed towards preventing thunderstorms altogether by constantly depriving the air of its superfluous electricity. The apparatus was, however, mounted on a free- standing pole and probably better grounded than Franklin's lightning rods at that time, so it served the purpose of a lightning rod.See the following two articles for conflicting views of this being an independent invention by Divi≈°: After local protests, Divi≈° had to cease his weather experiments around 1760. = United States = In what later became the United States, the pointed lightning rod conductor, also called a lightning attractor or Franklin rod, was invented by Benjamin Franklin in 1752 as part of his groundbreaking exploration of electricity. Although not the first to suggest a correlation between electricity and lightning, Franklin was the first to propose a workable system for testing his hypothesis. Franklin speculated that, with an iron rod sharpened to a point, \\"The electrical fire would, I think, be drawn out of a cloud silently, before it could come near enough to strike.\\" Franklin speculated about lightning rods for several years before his reported kite experiment. In the 19th century, the lightning rod became a decorative motif. Lightning rods were embellished with ornamental glass balls\\"Antique Lightning Rod Ball Hall of Fame\\". Antique Bottle Collectors Haven. (glass lightning balls collection) (now prized by collectors). The ornamental appeal of these glass balls has been used in weather vanes. The main purpose of these balls, however, is to provide evidence of a lightning strike by shattering or falling off. If after a storm a ball is discovered missing or broken, the property owner should then check the building, rod, and grounding wire for damage. Balls of solid glass occasionally were used in a method purported to prevent lightning strikes to ships and other objects. The idea was that glass objects, being non-conductors, are seldom struck by lightning. Therefore, goes the theory, there must be something about glass that repels lightning. Hence the best method for preventing a lightning strike to a wooden ship was to bury a small solid glass ball in the tip of the highest mast. The random behavior of lightning combined with observers' confirmation bias ensured that the method gained a good bit of credence even after the development of the marine lightning rod soon after Franklin's initial work. The first lightning conductors on ships were supposed to be hoisted when lightning was anticipated, and had a low success rate. In 1820 William Snow Harris invented a successful system for fitting lightning protection to the wooden sailing ships of the day, but despite successful trials which began in 1830, the British Royal Navy did not adopt the system until 1842, by which time the Imperial Russian Navy had already adopted the system. In the 1990s, the 'lightning points' were replaced as originally constructed when the Statue of Freedom atop the United States Capitol building in Washington, D.C. was restored.Statue of Freedom http://www.aoc.gov/cc/art/freedom.cfm The statue was designed with multiple devices that are tipped with platinum. The Washington Monument also was equipped with multiple lightning points,The Point of a Monument: A History of the Aluminum Cap of the Washington Monument: The Functional Purpose and the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor gets hit by lightning, which is shunted to ground.  Lightning protection system  Lightning protection system at a launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. A lightning protection system is designed to protect a structure from damage due to lightning strikes by intercepting such strikes and safely passing their extremely high currents to ground. A lightning protection system includes a network of air terminals, bonding conductors, and ground electrodes designed to provide a low impedance path to ground for potential strikes. Lightning protection systems are used to prevent lightning strike damage to structures. Lightning protection systems mitigate the fire hazard which lightning strikes pose to structures. A lightning protection system provides a low-impedance path for the lightning current to lessen the heating effect of current flowing through flammable structural materials. If lightning travels through porous and water-saturated materials, these materials may literally explode if their water content is flashed to steam by heat produced from the high current. This is why trees are often shattered by lightning strikes. Because of the high energy and current levels associated with lightning (currents can be in excess of 150,000 A), and the very rapid rise time of a lightning strike, no protection system can guarantee absolute safety from lightning. Lightning current will divide to follow every conductive path to ground, and even the divided current can cause damage. Secondary \\"side- flashes\\" can be enough to ignite a fire, blow apart brick, stone, or concrete, or injure occupants within a structure or building. However, the benefits of basic lightning protection systems have been evident for well over a century.NFPA-780 Standard for the Installation of Lightning Protection Systems 2008 Edition Laboratory-scale measurements of the effects of [any lightning investigation research] do not scale to applications involving natural lightning.Vernon Cooray (ed.) Lightning Protection, The Institution of Engineering and Technology, 2010, pp. 240-260, p 320 Field applications have mainly been derived from trial and error based on the best intended laboratory research of a highly complex and variable phenomenon. The parts of a lightning protection system are air terminals (lightning rods or strike termination devices), bonding conductors, ground terminals (ground or \\"earthing\\" rods, plates, or mesh), and all of the connectors and supports to complete the system. The air terminals are typically arranged at or along the upper points of a roof structure, and are electrically bonded together by bonding conductors (called \\"down conductors\\" or \\"downleads\\"), which are connected by the most direct route to one or more grounding or earthing terminals.Benjamin Franklin and Lightning Rods ‚Äì Physics Today January 2006, Accessed 2008-06-1 9:00pm GMT. Connections to the earth electrodes must not only have low resistance, but must have low self-inductance. An example of a structure vulnerable to lightning is a wooden barn. When lightning strikes the barn, the wooden structure and its contents may be ignited by the heat generated by lightning current conducted through parts of the structure. A basic lightning protection system would provide a conductive path between an air terminal and earth, so that most of the lightning's current will follow the path of the lightning protection system, with substantially less current traveling through flammable materials. Originally, scientists believed that such a lightning protection system of air terminals and \\"downleads\\" directed the current of the lightning down into the earth to be \\"dissipated\\". However, high speed photography has clearly demonstrated that lightning is actually composed of both a cloud component and an oppositely charged ground component. During \\"cloud-to-ground\\" lightning, these oppositely charged components usually \\"meet\\" somewhere in the atmosphere well above the earth to equalize previously unbalanced charges. The heat generated as this electric current flows through flammable materials is the hazard which lightning protection systems attempt to mitigate by providing a low-resistance path for the lightning circuit. No lightning protection system can be relied upon to \\"contain\\" or \\"control\\" lightning completely (nor thus far, to prevent lightning strikes entirely), but they do seem to help immensely on most occasions of lightning strikes. Steel framed structures can bond the structural members to earth to provide lightning protection. A metal flagpole with its foundation in the earth is its own extremely simple lightning protection system. However, the flag(s) flying from the pole during a lightning strike may be completely incinerated. The majority of lightning protection systems in use today are of the traditional Franklin design. The fundamental principle used in Franklin-type lightning protections systems is to provide a sufficiently low impedance path for the lightning to travel through to reach ground without damaging the building.NFPA-780 Standard for the Installation of Lightning Protection Systems 2008 Edition ‚Äì Annex B.3.2.2 This is accomplished by surrounding the building in a kind of Faraday cage. A system of lightning protection conductors and lightning rods are installed on the roof of the building to intercept any lightning before it strikes the building.  Structure protectors  Landscape suited for purpose of explanation: (1) Represents Lord Kelvin's \\"reduced\\" area of the region;Sir William Thomson, Papers on Electrostatics and Magnetism. (2) Surface concentric with the Earth such that the quantities stored over it and under it are equal; (3) Building on a site of excessive electrostatic charge density; (4) Building on a site of low electrostatic charge density. (Image via .) = Lightning arrester = Lightning rod on a statue. In telegraphy and telephony, a lightning arrester is a device placed where wires enter a structure, in order to prevent damage to electronic instruments within and ensuring the safety of individuals near the structures. Lightning arresters, also called surge protectors, are devices that are connected between each electrical conductor in a power or communications system, and the ground. They help prevent the flow of the normal power or signal currents to ground, but provide a path over which high- voltage lightning current flows, bypassing the connected equipment. Arresters are used to limit the rise in voltage when a communications or power line is struck by lightning or is near to a lightning strike. = Protection of electric distribution systems = In overhead electric transmission (high- tension) systems, one or two lighter gauge conductors may be mounted to the top of the pylons, poles, or towers not specifically used to send electricity through the grid. These conductors, often referred to \\"static\\", \\"pilot\\" or \\"shield\\" wires are designed to be the point of lightning termination instead of the high-voltage lines themselves. These conductors are intended to protect the primary power conductors from lightning strikes. These conductors are bonded to earth either through the metal structure of a pole or tower, or by additional ground electrodes installed at regular intervals along the line. As a general rule, overhead power lines with voltages below 50 kV do not have a \\"static\\" conductor, but most lines carrying more than 50 kV do. The ground conductor cable may also support fibre optic cables for data transmission. In some instances, these conductors are insulated from direct bonding with earth and may be used as low voltage communication lines. If the voltage exceeds a certain threshold, such as during a lightning termination to the conductor, it \\"jumps\\" the insulators and passes to earth. Protection of electrical substations is as varied as lightning rods themselves, and is often proprietary to the electric company. = Lightning protection of mast radiators = Radio mast radiators may be insulated from the ground by a gap at the base. When lightning hits the mast, it jumps this gap. A small inductivity in the feed line between the mast and the tuning unit (usually one winding) limits the voltage increase, protecting the transmitter from dangerously high voltages. The transmitter must be equipped with a device to monitor the antenna's electrical properties. This is very important, as a charge could remain after a lightning strike, damaging the gap or the insulators. The monitoring device switches off the transmitter when the antenna shows incorrect behavior, e.g. as a result of undesired electrical charge. When the transmitter is switched off, these charges dissipate. The monitoring device makes several attempts to switch back on. If after several attempts the antenna continues to show improper behavior, possibly as result of structural damage, the transmitter remains switched off. = Lightning conductors and grounding precautions = Ideally, the underground part of the assembly should reside in an area of high ground conductivity. If the underground cable is able to resist corrosion well, it can be covered in salt to improve its electrical connection with the ground. While the electrical resistance of the lightning conductor between the air terminal and the Earth is of significant concern, the inductive reactance of the conductor could be more important. For this reason, the down conductor route is kept short, and any curves have a large radius. If these measures are not taken, lightning current may arc over a resistive or reactive obstruction that it encounters in the conductor. At the very least, the arc current will damage the lightning conductor and can easily find another conductive path, such as building wiring or plumbing, and cause fires or other disasters. Grounding systems without low resistivity to the ground can still be effective in protecting a structure from lightning damage. When ground soil has poor conductivity, is very shallow, or non-existent, a grounding system can be augmented by adding ground rods, counterpoise (ground ring) conductor, cable radials projecting away from the building, or a concrete building's reinforcing bars can be used for a ground conductor (Ufer ground). These additions, while still not reducing the resistance of the system in some instances, will allow the [dispersion] of the lightning into the earth without damage to the structure.NFPA-780 Standard for the Installation of Lightning Protection Systems 2008 Edition ‚Äì Annex B ‚Äì B.4.3 Additional precautions must be taken to prevent side-flashes between conductive objects on or in the structure and the lightning protection system. The surge of lightning current through a lightning protection conductor will create a voltage difference between it and any conductive objects that are near it. This voltage difference can be large enough to cause a dangerous side-flash (spark) between the two that can cause significant damage, especially on structures housing flammable or explosive materials. The most effective way to prevent this potential damage is to ensure the electrical continuity between the lightning protection system and any objects susceptible to a side-flash. Effective bonding will allow the voltage potential of the two objects to rise and fall simultaneously, thereby eliminating any risk of a side-flash.NFPA-780 Standard for the Installation of Lightning Protection Systems 2008 Edition ‚Äì Annex C = Lightning protection system design = Considerable material is used to make up lightning protection systems, so it is prudent to consider carefully where an air terminal will provide the greatest protection. Historical understanding of lightning, from statements made by Ben Franklin, assumed that each lightning rod protected a cone of 45 degrees.Donlon, Tim, \\"Lightning Protection for Historic Buildings\\". Cathedral Communications Limited, 2001. This has been found to be unsatisfactory for protecting taller structures, as it is possible for lightning to strike the side of a building. A modeling system based on a better understanding of the termination targeting of lightning, called the Rolling Sphere Method, was developed by Dr Tibor Horv√°th. It has become the standard by which traditional Franklin Rod systems are installed. To understand this requires knowledge of how lightning 'moves'. As the step leader of a lightning bolt jumps toward the ground, it steps toward the grounded objects nearest its path. The maximum distance that each step may travel is called the critical distance and is proportional to the electric current. Objects are likely to be struck if they are nearer to the leader than this critical distance. It is standard practice to approximate the sphere's radius as 46 m near the ground.Installation requirements for lightning protection systems ‚Äì UL 96A 4.7.3.4.2 An object outside the critical distance is unlikely to be struck by the leader if there is a solidly grounded object within the critical distance. Locations that are considered safe from lightning can be determined by imagining a leader's potential paths as a sphere that travels from the cloud to the ground. For lightning protection, it suffices to consider all possible spheres as they touch potential strike points. To determine strike points, consider a sphere rolling over the terrain. At each point, a potential leader position is simulated. Lightning is most likely to strike where the sphere touches the ground. Points that the sphere cannot roll across and touch are safest from lightning. Lightning protectors should be placed where they will prevent the sphere from touching a structure. A weak point in most lightning diversion systems is in transporting the captured discharge from the lightning rod to the ground, though.Lightning protection installation, Lightning rods are typically installed around the perimeter of flat roofs, or along the peaks of sloped roofs at intervals of 6.1 m or 7.6 m, depending on the height of the rod.Installation requirements for lightning protection systems ‚Äì UL 96A 8.2.2 When a flat roof has dimensions greater than 15 m by 15 m, additional air terminals will be installed in the middle of the roof at intervals of 15 m or less in a rectangular grid pattern.Standard for the installation of lightning protection systems 2008 edition ‚Äì NFPA-780 4.8.2.4 = Rounded versus pointed ends = Pointed lightning rod on a building The optimal shape for the tip of a lightning rod has been controversial since the 18th century. During the period of political confrontation between Britain and its American colonies, British scientists maintained that a lightning rod should have a ball on its end, while American scientists maintained that there should be a point. , the controversy had not been completely resolved. It is difficult to resolve the controversy because proper controlled experiments are nearly impossible, but work performed by Charles B. Moore, et al.,C. B. Moore, William Rison, James Mathis, and Graydon Aulich, \\"Lightning Rod Improvement Studies\\". Journal of Applied Meteorology: Vol. 39, No. 5, pp. 593‚Äì609. Langmuir Laboratory for Atmospheric Research, New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, Socorro, New Mexico. April 10, 1999. in 2000 has shed some light on the issue, finding that moderately rounded or blunt-tipped lightning rods act as marginally better strike receptors. As a result, round-tipped rods are installed on most new systems in the United States, though most existing systems still have pointed rods. According to the study, In addition, the height of the lightning protector relative to the structure to be protected and the Earth itself will have an effect., Tesla, \\"Lightning-Protector\\"., Griscom, \\"Transmission-line lightning-proofing structures\\". Page 25, Column 5. (cf. [‚Ä¶] the charge on a leader as a function of height above ground[‚Ä¶]) = Charge transfer theory = The charge transfer theory states that a lightning strike to a protected structure can be prevented by reducing the electrical potential between the protected structure and the thundercloud. This is done by transferring electric charge (such as from the nearby Earth to the sky or vice versa)., Richard Ralph Zini, et al., Non-contaminating lightning protection system. Claim one and claim ten.John Richard Gumley, , Lightning air terminals and method of design and application Transferring electric charge from the Earth to the sky is done by installing engineered products composed of many points above the structure. It is noted that pointed objects will indeed transfer charge to the surrounding atmosphereEmitter of ions for a lightning rod with a parabolic reflector, Manuel Domingo Varela, .Lightning-protector for electrical conductors, Johathan H. Vail, . and that a considerable electric current can be measured through the conductors as ionization occurs at the point when an electric field is present, such as happens when thunderclouds are overhead. In the United States, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) does not currently endorse a device that can prevent or reduce lightning strikes. The NFPA Standards Council, following a request for a project to address Dissipation Array[tm] Systems and Charge Transfer Systems, denied the request to begin forming standards on such technology (though the Council did not foreclose on future standards development after reliable sources demonstrating the validity of the basic technology and science were submitted).Casey C. Grant, \\"To: Interested Parties\\" = Early streamer emission (ESE) theory = ESE lightning rod mounted at the Monastery of St. Nicholas Anapausas (ŒúŒøŒΩŒÆ œÑŒøœÖ ŒëŒ≥ŒØŒøœÖ ŒùŒπŒ∫ŒøŒªŒ¨ŒøœÖ), Meteora, Greece The theory of early streamer emission proposes that if a lightning rod has a mechanism producing ionization near its tip, then its lightning capture area is greatly increased. At first, small quantities of radioactive isotopes (radium-226 or americium-241) were used as sources of ionizationB. Charpentier, S. Rodde: \\"Decommissioning of radioactive lightning rods in France\\", Autorit√© de s√ªret√© nucl√©aire (ASN), March 2012 between 1930 and 1980, later replaced with various electrical and electronic devices. According to an early patent, since most lightning protectors' ground potentials are elevated, the path distance from the source to the elevated ground point will be shorter, creating a stronger field (measured in volts per unit distance) and that structure will be more prone to ionization and breakdown., Bumbraugh, \\"Lightning protection system and method\\". AFNOR, the French national standardization body, issued a standard, NF C 17-102, covering this technology. The NFPA also investigated the subject and there was a proposal to issue a similar standard in the USA. Initially, an NFPA independent third party panel stated that \\"the [Early Streamer Emission] lightning protection technology appears to be technically sound\\" and that there was an \\"adequate theoretical basis for the [Early Streamer Emission] air terminal concept and design from a physical viewpoint\\".Bryan, R. G., et al., 1999, \\"Report of the Third-Party Independent Evaluation Panel on the Early Streamer Emission Lightning Protection Technology\\".) The same panel also concluded that \\"the recommended [NFPA 781 standard] lightning protection system has never been scientifically or technically validated and the Franklin rod air terminals have not been validated in field tests under thunderstorm conditions.\\" In response, the American Geophysical Union concluded that \\"[t]he Bryan Panel reviewed essentially none of the studies and literature on the effectiveness and scientific basis of traditional lightning protection systems and was erroneous in its conclusion that there was no basis for the Standard.\\" AGU did not attempt to assess the effectiveness of any proposed modifications to traditional systems in its report.Report of The Committee on Atmospheric And Space Electricity of The American Geophysical Union on The Scientific Basis for Traditional Lightning Protection Systems The NFPA withdrew its proposed draft edition of standard 781 due to a lack of evidence of increased effectiveness of Early Streamer Emission-based protection systems over conventional air terminals. Members of the Scientific Committee of the International Conference on Lightning Protection (ICLP) have issued a joint statement stating their opposition to Early Streamer Emission technology.Mousa, Abdul M. \\"Scientists Oppose Early Streamer Air Terminals\\", 1999. ICLP maintains a web page with information related to ESE and related technologies.ICLP ESE issue webpage Still, the number of buildings and structures equipped with ESE lightning protection systems is growing as well as the number of manufacturers of ESE air terminals from Europe, Americas, Middle East, Russia, China, South Korea, ASEAN countries, and Australia.  Analysis of strikes  Lightning strikes to a metallic structure can vary from leaving no evidence‚Äîexcept, perhaps, a small pit in the metal‚Äîto the complete destruction of the structure.Rakov, et al., Lightning: physics and effects, p. 364 When there is no evidence, analyzing the strikes is difficult. This means that a strike on an uninstrumented structure must be visually confirmed, and the random behavior of lightning renders such observations difficult.Martin A. Uman, Lightning Discharge. Courier Dover Publications, 2001. 377 pages. Donald R. MacGorman, The Electrical Nature of Storms. Oxford University Press (US), 1998. 432 pages. Hans Volland, Handbook of Atmospheric Electrodynamics, Volume I. CRC Press, 1995. 408 pages. There are also inventors working on this problem,Method and apparatus for the artificial triggering of lightning, Douglas A. Palmer, Lightning rocket, Robert E. Betts, such as through a lightning rocket. While controlled experiments may be off in the future, very good data is being obtained through techniques which use radio receivers that watch for the characteristic electrical 'signature' of lightning strikes using fixed directional antennas.Lightning locating system, Ralph J. Markson et al., .Lightning locating system, Airborne Research Associates, Inc., .System and method of locating lightning strikes, The United States of America as represented by the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Single station system and method of locating lightning strikes, The United States of America as represented by the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration, . Through accurate timing and triangulation techniques, lightning strikes can be located with great precision, so strikes on specific objects often can be confirmed with confidence. The energy in a lightning strike is typically in the range of 1 to 10 billion joules. This energy is released usually in a small number of separate strokes, each with duration of a few tens of microseconds (typically 30 to 50 microseconds), over a period of about one fifth of a second. The great majority of the energy is dissipated as heat, light and sound in the atmosphere.  Aircraft protectors  Aircraft are protected by devices mounted to the aircraft structure and by the design of internal systems. Lightning usually enters and exits an aircraft through the outer surface of its airframe or through a static dischargers. The lightning protection system provides safe conductive paths between the entry and exit points to prevent damage to electronic equipment and to protect flammable fuel or cargo from sparks. These paths are constructed of conductive materials. Electrical insulators are only effective in combination with a conductive path because blocked lightning can easily exceed the breakdown voltage of insulators. Composite materials are constructed with layers of wire mesh to make them sufficiently conductive and structural joints are protected by making an electrical connection across the joint. Shielded cable and conductive enclosures provide the majority of protection to electronic systems. The lightning current emits a magnetic pulse which induces current through any loops formed by the cables. The current induced in the shield of a loop creates magnetic flux through the loop in the opposite direction. This decreases the total flux through the loop and the induced voltage around it. The lightning-conductive path and conductive shielding carry the majority of current. The remainder is bypassed around sensitive electronics using transient voltage suppressors, and blocked using electronic filters once the let-through voltage is low enough. Filters, like insulators, are only effective when lightning and surge currents are able to flow through an alternate path.  Watercraft protectors  A lightning protection installation on a watercraft comprises a lightning protector mounted on the top of a mast or superstructure, and a grounding conductor in contact with the water. Electrical conductors attach to the protector and run down to the conductor. For a vessel with a conducting (iron or steel) hull, the grounding conductor is the hull. For a vessel with a non-conducting hull, the grounding conductor may be retractable, attached to the hull, or attached to a centerboard.  Risk assessment  Some structures are inherently more or less at risk of being struck by lightning. The risk for a structure is a function of the size (area) of a structure, the height, and the number of lightning strikes per year per mi2 for the region.NFPA-780 Standard for the Installation of Lightning Protection Systems 2008 Edition ‚Äì Annex L.1.3 For example, a small building will be less likely to be struck than a large one, and a building in an area with a high density of lightning strikes will be more likely to be struck than one in an area with a low density of lightning strikes. The National Fire Protection Association provides a risk assessment worksheet in their lightning protection standard.NFPA-780 Standard for the Installation of Lightning Protection Systems 2008 Edition ‚Äì Annex L The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) lightning risk-assessment comprises four parts: loss of living beings, loss of service to public, loss of cultural heritage, and loss of economic value. Loss of living beings is rated as the most important and is the only loss taken into consideration for many nonessential industrial and commercial applications.  Standards  The introduction of lightning protection systems into standards allowed various manufactures to develop protector systems to a multitude of specifications.

Before enrolling to the Kyiv University, Skrypin was a journalist-trainee for the Poltava newspaper Komsomolets Poltavshchyny in 1990. While studying in the Institute of Journalism of Kyiv University in 1991-1997, Skrypin worked for number of newspapers and television studios and channels. *1991-1992 ‚Äì journalist for a newspaper \\"Ukrayina Moloda\\" *1992-1993 ‚Äì freelancer for \\"Hart\\" television studio *1993-1995 ‚Äì journalist for the Center of creative television *1995-1996 - co-owner, journalist-producer for the private firm \\"Agency of producers\\" Soon after the graduation, in 1996-1998 Skrypin worked as a reporter and chief ‚Äì editor of a news block and hosting the program \\"Dobroho ranku, Ukrayina\\" on the state television channel UTN (today - Pershyi Natsionalnyi). Since September 1998, he has been working as an anchor‚Äìeditor for a news program \\"Vikna. Press digest\\" on STB television channel. In January 1999, his program was renamed to \\"Vikna. At the midnight\\", while also he was hosting program and \\"Mediaclub\\". Due to the total political censorship on Ukrainian TV channels as far as on STB also, Skrypin had to leave in 2002. In 2002 he joined the new radio-broadcasting project on internet led by Andriy Kulykov \\"Hromadske Radio\\". During the parliamentary proceedings, which were dedicated to the situation of the freedom of speech in Ukraine, Skrypin had appeared with his colleague Andriy Shevchenko. He stated authoritatively about non-permissibility of the censorship and brought an accusation against the existing President Leonid Kuchma. Skrypin accused him in being the one and the first who made such unbearable conditions, when the journalist can't work by specialty. Skrypin is the co-author of the Channel 5 so-called \\"true news\\". He started to work from the very beginning until June 2006 as chief-editor and also as a television host of the summarized program \\"Chas\\". Skrypin resigned in June 2006 due to a reason of development absence and also because there was an absence of straight scheme of decision-making. Among other things, the new chief-editor was appointed without any discussions with Skrypin as that time chief-editor. Starting on 14 August 2006 and until 31 January 2008 he worked as a media director, \\"RBC-Ukraine\\" inform agency (affiliate of the RBC Information Systems). After that Skrypin was a radio host of the \\"Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty\\" Ukrainian Service (RFE/RL). Starting on 19 January 2009, he became the author and the host of television program \\"Truth of Roman Skrypin\\" at TVi television channel. On 23 February he was elected as a chief of the Ukrainian Independent media union. There were 31 votes for his candidature among 57 delegates attended the 2nd congress of the Independent media union, which took place in the House of scientists, Kyiv, Ukraine. On 2 April Roman Skrypin headed informational service of TVi and eventually became the vice editor-chief at \\"TVi\\" for Yevgeniy Kiselyov.

It is characterized by volume or rate of flow, physical condition, chemical and toxic constituents, and its bacteriologic status (which organisms it contains and in what quantities). It consists mostly of greywater (from sinks, bathtubs, showers, dishwashers, and clothes washers), blackwater (the water used to flush toilets, combined with the human waste that it flushes away); soaps and detergents; and toilet paper (less so in regions where bidets are widely used instead of paper). Sewage usually travels from a building's plumbing either into a sewer, which will carry it elsewhere, or into an onsite sewage facility (of which there are many kinds). Whether it is combined with surface runoff in the sewer depends on the sewer design (sanitary sewer or combined sewer). The reality is that most wastewater produced globally remains untreated, causing widespread water pollution, especially in low-income countries: a global estimate by UNDP and UN-Habitat is that 90% of all wastewater generated is released into the environment untreated. In many developing countries the bulk of domestic and industrial wastewater is discharged without any treatment or after primary treatment only. The term sewage is nowadays regarded as an older term and is being more and more replaced by \\"wastewater\\". In general American English usage, the terms \\"sewage\\" and \\"sewerage\\" mean the same thing.Funk & Wagnall's Standard Dictionary (International Edition) New York, 1960, p. 1152. In common English usage, and in American technical and professional English usage, \\"sewerage\\" refers to the infrastructure that conveys sewage. Overview Before the 20th century, sewers usually discharged into a body of water such as a stream, river, lake, bay, or ocean. There was no treatment, so the breakdown of the human waste was left to the ecosystem. Today, the goal is that sewers route their contents to a wastewater treatment plant rather than directly to a body of water. In many countries, this is the norm; in many developing countries, it may be a yet-unrealized goal. Current approaches to sewage management may include handling surface runoff separately from sewage, handling greywater separately from blackwater (flush toilets), and coping better with abnormal events (such as peaks stormwater volumes from extreme weather). Proper collection and safe, nuisance-free disposal of the liquid wastes of a community are legally recognized as a necessity in an urbanized, industrialized society.McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology (View excerpt at Answers.com  Types  Greywater samples before and after treatment in a constructed wetland in Peru * The wastewater from residences and institutions, carrying bodily wastes (primarily feces and urine), washing water, food preparation wastes, laundry wastes, and other waste products of normal living, are classed as domestic or sanitary sewage. * Liquid-carried wastes from stores and service establishments serving the immediate community, termed commercial wastes, are included in the sanitary or domestic sewage category if their characteristics are similar to household flows. Wastes that result from industrial processes such as the production or manufacture of goods are classed as industrial wastewater, not as sewage. * Surface runoff, also known as storm flow or overland flow, is that portion of precipitation that runs rapidly over the ground surface to a defined channel. Precipitation absorbs gases and particulates from the atmosphere, dissolves and leaches materials from vegetation and soil, suspends matter from the land, washes spills and debris from urban streets and highways, and carries all these pollutants as wastes in its flow to a collection point.  Pollutants  = Organic pollutants and nutrients = Sewage is a complex mixture of chemicals, with many distinctive chemical characteristics. These include high concentrations of ammonium, nitrate, nitrogen, phosphorus, high conductivity (due to high dissolved solids), high alkalinity, with pH typically ranging between 7 and 8. The organic matter of sewage is measured by determining its biological oxygen demand (BOD) or the chemical oxygen demand (COD). = Pathogens = Sewage contains human feces, and therefore often contains pathogens of one of the four types:Andersson, K., Rosemarin, A., Lamizana, B., Kvarnstr√∂m, E., McConville, J., Seidu, R., Dickin, S. and Trimmer, C.

Traditional techniques involve filtering, staining, and examining samples under a microscope. Much more sensitive and specific testing can be accomplished with DNA sequencing, such as when looking for rare organisms, attempting eradication, testing specifically for drug-resistant strains, or discovering new species.Poliovirus detected from environmental samples in Israel Drug resistant bug review: NDM-1 in New Delhi‚Äôs sewage, WHO calls to action, recent outbreaks of antibiotic resistant bacteria Raw Sewage Harbors Diverse Viral Populations Sequencing DNA from an environmental sample is known as metagenomics. = Micro-pollutants = Sewage also contains environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutants.

Health and environmental aspects All categories of sewage are likely to carry pathogenic organisms that can transmit disease to humans and animals. Sewage also contains organic matter that can cause odor and attract flies. Sewage contains nutrients that may cause eutrophication of receiving water bodies; and can lead to ecotoxicity.  Collection  Stockholm Old Town formerly deposited sewage on the street to be flushed away by rain. National Museum in Warsaw. A system of sewer pipes (sewers) collects sewage and takes it for treatment or disposal. The system of sewers is called sewerage or sewerage system (see London sewerage system) in British English and sewage system in American English. Where a main sewerage system has not been provided, sewage may be collected from homes by pipes into septic tanks or cesspits, where it may be treated or collected in vehicles and taken for treatment or disposal. Properly functioning septic tanks require emptying every 2‚Äì5 years depending on the load of the system. Treatment Sewage treatment is the process of removing the contaminants from sewage to produce liquid and solid (sludge) suitable for discharge to the environment or for reuse. It is a form of waste management. A septic tank or other on-site wastewater treatment system such as biofilters or constructed wetlands can be used to treat sewage close to where it is created. Sewage treatment results in sewage sludge which requires sewage sludge treatment before safe disposal or reuse. Under certain circumstances, the treated sewage sludge might be termed \\"biosolids\\" and can be used as a fertilizer. In developed countries sewage collection and treatment is typically subject to local and national regulations and standards. Disposal Raw sewage is also disposed of to rivers, streams, and the sea in many parts of the world. Doing so can lead to serious pollution of the receiving water. This is common in developing countries and may still occur in some developed countries, for various reasons ‚Äì usually related to costs. Ships at sea are forbidden from discharging their sewage overboard unless three miles or more from shore.   Sewage can be converted to biogas using anaerobic digestion. Increasingly, agriculture is using untreated wastewater for irrigation. Cities provide lucrative markets for fresh produce, so are attractive to farmers. Because agriculture has to compete for increasingly scarce water resources with industry and municipal users, there is often no alternative for farmers but to use water polluted with urban waste, including sewage, directly to water their crops. There can be significant health hazards related to using water loaded with pathogens in this way, especially if people eat raw vegetables that have been irrigated with the polluted water. The International Water Management Institute has worked in India, Pakistan, Vietnam, Ghana, Ethiopia, Mexico and other countries on various projects aimed at assessing and reducing risks of wastewater irrigation. They advocate a ‚Äòmultiple-barrier‚Äô approach to wastewater use, where farmers are encouraged to adopt various risk-reducing behaviours. These include ceasing irrigation a few days before harvesting to allow pathogens to die off in the sunlight, applying water carefully so it does not contaminate leaves likely to be eaten raw, cleaning vegetables with disinfectant or allowing fecal sludge used in farming to dry before being used as a human manure.Wastewater use in agriculture: Not only an issue where water is scarce!

Legislation = European Union = Council Directive 91/271/EEC on Urban Wastewater Treatment was adopted on 21 May 1991, amended by the Commission Directive 98/15/EC. Commission Decision 93/481/EEC defines the information that Member States should provide the Commission on the state of implementation of the Directive.

Urechia (most common version of Vasile Alexandrescu Urechia, ; born Vasile Alexandrescu and also known as UrechiƒÉ, Urechea, Ureche, Popovici- Ureche or Vasile Urechea-Alexandrescu; February 15, 1834 - November 21, 1901) was a Moldavian, later Romanian historian, Romantic author of historical fiction and plays, academic and politician. The author of Romanian history syntheses, a noted bibliographer, heraldist, ethnographer and folklorist, he founded and managed a private school, later holding teaching positions at the University of Ia≈üi and University of Bucharest. Urechia was also one of the founding members of the Romanian Academy and, as frequent traveler to Spain and fluent speaker of Spanish, a corresponding member of the Royal Spanish Academy. He was the father of satirist Alceu Urechia. As an ideologue, Urechia developed \\"Romanianism\\", which offered a template for cultural and political cooperation among Romanians from several historical regions, and formed part of a Pan-Latinist campaign. An activist in favor of the Moldavia's union to Wallachia and a representative of the liberal wing, he was briefly Moldavian Minister of Religious Affairs, and later a prominent member of the National Liberal Party. For more than three decades, Urechia represented Covurlui County in the Romanian Kingdom's Chamber of Deputies and Senate. He was Education Minister under two successive National Liberal administrations, and, during the 1890s, he founded the Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians, which focused on encouraging the aspirations of Romanians living in Austria-Hungary. Often portrayed as an amateurish and inconsequential presence in Romanian literature and science, Urechia was involved in a decade-long controversy with Junimea, a conservative literary society which advocated professionalization. Among those involved on the Junimist side were literary critic Titu Maiorescu and poet Mihai Eminescu. Like other contributors to the liberal magazine Revista ContimporanƒÉ, Urechia was a notorious target of Maiorescu's campaign against \\"inebriation with words\\", and ultimately sided with the anti-Junimist author Alexandru Macedonski, becoming a contributor to Literatorul magazine. The polemics touched on his private life, after claims surfaced that he was secretly leading a polygynous lifestyle. Name V. A. Urechia was known to his contemporaries by several name variants: his rival Eminescu once described him as having \\"seven names\\".CƒÉlinescu, p.529 Urechia, which the writer added in adult life, is a variant of urechea (Romanian for \\"the ear\\"), often transcribed as ureche (\\"ear\\").

Biography =Early life= Born in Piatra Neam≈£, Urechia was the son of Alexandru Popovici, a member of the boyar class in Moldavia and a titular culcer; his mother, Eufrosina (or Euphrosina) n√©e Manoliu. Both had been widowed or divorced from previous marriages, and Vasile had stepsiblings from each parent. After the culcer 's death, he and three other of Eufrosina's youngest children, all of them below legal age, moved in with their mother, who remarried serdar Fotino. In spring 1848, he was in Ia≈üi, where he witnessed the failed rebellion provoked by the Romantic nationalist and liberal current with which he would later affiliate. He debuted in journalism upon the end of the 1840s, when he wrote pieces condemning Transylvanian-born educators for promoting a version of Romanian which overemphasized the language's connection with Latin. During most of the 1850s, the young Vasile Alexandrescu was in France, spending most of his time in Paris, where he received his Baccalaur√©at (1856), and trained for a Licence √®s Lettres degree. Urechia frequented exiles from both Danubian Principalities (Moldavia and Wallachia), growing close to the Wallachian politico C. A. Rosetti. Having written his debut literary works, some grouped in 1854 under the title Mozaic de novele, cugetƒÉri, piese ≈üi poezii (\\"A Mosaic of Novellas, Musings, Plays and Poetry\\"), he also completed a debut novel, Coliba MƒÉriucƒÉi (\\"MƒÉriuca's Cabin\\", in 1855). The plot was loosely based on Uncle Tom's Cabin, by the American abolitionist writer Harriet Beecher Stowe, and was adapted to the realities of Romani slavery in Moldavia. He was at the time collaborating on Steaua DunƒÉrii, a unionist magazine co-edited by the Moldavian intellectuals Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu and Vasile Alecsandri, where he published a Romanian-language translation of Canci√≥n a las ruinas de It√°lica (\\"Song to the Ruins of Italica\\"), a Spanish Renaissance poem written by Rodrigo Caro, but attributed by scholars of the day to Fernando de Rioja.CƒÉlinescu, p.321 A believer in Pan-Latinism, he popularized the cause of Romanians through articles published in the Romance-speaking press of France and Spain, and founded Opiniunea, a magazine for Moldo-Wallachian exiles in Paris. During 1856, as the Crimean War brought an end to Imperial Russian administration in the two countries and its Regulamentul Organic regime, the exiles saw an opportunity for action in favor of the union. During the Peace Treaty Conference of that year, Urechia was secretary of a Romanian Bureau which popularized the unionist cause among the participants, and proposed a Romanian state under a foreign ruler, whom Urechia wanted to be of \\"Latin\\" origin. =Late 1850s and first ministerial appointment= Luiza Urechia ca. 1869-1875, portrait by Nicolae Grigorescu In August 1857, he married the upper-class Spanish woman Francisca Dominica de Plano, whose father had been the personal physician of Queen regent Isabella II. Eugen Denize, \\"CƒÉlƒÉtori rom√¢ni √Æn Spania secolului al XIX-lea\\" , in Tribuna, Nr. 28, November 2003, p.9 The wedding at the Romanian Orthodox Chapel in Paris. He was in Spain from 1857 to 1858 and again in 1862, researching local archives and Spanish education. Francisca introduced her husband to several figures in Spain's cultural and political life: poets Ram√≥n de Campoamor y Campoosorio and Gaspar N√∫√±ez de Arce, the future leaders of the First Republic Emilio Castelar y Ripoll and Francisco Pi y Margall, as well as dramatist Manuel Tamayo y Baus. During the following decade, Urechia also traveled to Greece, Switzerland, Italy and the German Empire. Upon his 1858 return to Moldavia, Urechia was appointed court inspector in Ia≈üi County and Romanian language teacher at a gymnasium level. After 1860, he held a Romanian-language and Classical Literature chair at the newly founded University of Ia≈üi. His wife Francisca died a young woman, most likely before 1860, and Urechia remarried, to the German amateur musician Luiza \\"Zettina\\" Wirth. In 1859-1860, as the political union was being effected under the rule of Alexander John Cuza as Domnitor, V. A. Urechia briefly served as Moldavia's Minister of Religious Affairs in the KogƒÉlniceanu administration. During his term in office, he awarded scholarships to local undergraduates, sending them to complete their education in the universities of France, Spain, Portugal and the Kingdom of Sardinia. Also then, he published the literary criticism volumes Schi≈£ƒÉri de literaturƒÉ rom√¢nƒÉ (\\"Sketches of Romanian Literature\\", 1859) and O vorbƒÉ despre literatura desfr√ÆnatƒÉ ce se √ÆncearcƒÉ a se introduce √Æn societatea rom√¢nƒÉ (\\"A Word on the Profligate Literature that Threatens to Introduce Itself into Romanian Society\\", 1863). He was still involved in building connections with France while pursuing his interest in ethnography, and joined the Paris-based Soci√©t√© d'Ethnographie, collaborating closely with its chairman L√©on de Rosny. He also became an active member of the Institut d'Ethnographie and the Heraldry Society of France. Beginning in 1861, he was publishing the Ia≈üi-based magazine Atheneul Rom√¢n. A pro-liberal venue, it was noted for reacting against Urechia's former associate Alecsandri over the latter's conservative views.Vianu, p.245 The Atheneul Rom√¢n society was the nucleus of a country- wide cultural movement, which Urechia claimed was instrumental in establishing both the Romanian Academy (founded 1866) and the Romanian Athenaeum (founded 1888). Urechia's initiative was inspired by his admiration for the Spanish institution Ateneo de Madrid. =Relocation to Bucharest= In November 1864, Urechia moved to unified Romania's capital, Bucharest, having been granted a seat at the local university's Faculty of Letters, but continued to manage a \\"V. A. Urechia Institute\\", his private school. He was also employed as Head of Department in the Education Ministry, in which position he helped his future rival, Titu Maiorescu, who was at the time facing allegations of misconduct and pressured to resign from his teaching position.Ornea, p.284-285 Also then, as a bibliographer and avid book collector, he was among those tasked by Cuza with drafting the common statute of public libraries throughout the country. He was one of the Romanian Academy's original members upon its 1866 foundation as the Academic Society, and subsequently participated in setting up its Library. Urechia served as vice-chairman and general secretary of the Academy for several terms, was president of its Historical Section, and supervised a number of its cultural programs. Dissolved in Ia≈üi due to lack of members, the Atheneul Rom√¢n club was reestablished in the capital during 1865. That year, he published two books: Femeia rom√¢nƒÉ, dupre istorie ≈üi poesie (\\"The Romanian Woman in History and Poetry\\") and Balul mortului (\\"The Dead Man's Ball\\"). After Cuza's replacement with Carol I, Urechia successfully ran in the November 1866 election for a Chamber seat in Covurlui County. He was a member of Parliament for the next 34 years, moving from Chamber to the Senate, and pushing legislation to modernize the education system. Also in 1866, Urechia published an essay of fables, which centered on the work of Dimitrie ≈¢ichindeal (or Chichindeal), an early 19th-century poet from Banat. In 1867, he completed work on his best-known literary contribution to local theater, a three-act drama or melodrama inspired by the 17th-century life of Costea Bucioc. The same year and the next, he published Despre elocin≈£a rom√¢nƒÉ (\\"On Romanian Eloquence\\"), Poezia √Æn fa≈£a politicei (\\"Poetry vs. Politics\\") and Patria rom√¢nƒÉ (\\"The Romanian Motherland\\"). He was in Spain from spring 1867 to autumn 1868, perfecting his knowledge of Castilian and carrying out an extended research into local archives, being received as corresponding member of the Royal Spanish Academy (April 2, 1868). Together with fellow intellectual and amateur archaeologist Alexandru Odobescu, Urechia represented Romania at the 1869 World Archaeological Congress in Paris. He and Luiza Wirth divorced at some point after 1868. In parallel, Urechia published several new works of historical fiction, including, in 1872, the drama Episod de sub Alecsandru cel Bun (\\"An Episode from the Rule of Alexander the Good\\"). In 1872, he also premiered the one-act comedy OdƒÉ la Elisa (\\"An Ode to Elisa\\"), which he had written during 1869. =Conflict with Junimea= A major event in V. A. Urechia's career occurred in 1869, when Maiorescu and his like-minded friends established Junimea society in Ia≈üi. At the time, Urechia was editing the journal Adunarea Na≈£ionalƒÉ, which initially regarded the Junimists with sympathy, despite the fact that Maiorescu was already making his anti-liberal agenda public.Ornea, p.284 By the early 1870s however, Urechia had become engaged in a major cultural polemic with the Junimists, which reflected the liberal-conservative and Romantic-Neoclassical splits within Romanian society. Although usually adverse to other liberal factions, including the group formed around historian Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu and Nicolae Ionescu's Frac≈£iunea liberƒÉ ≈üi independentƒÉ, he united with them in condemning Junimea 's views and cultural guidelines.Ornea, p.281 Also during that decade, he openly sided with the radicals around C. A. Rosetti, who would, in 1875, contribute to the creation of the National Liberal Party.Ornea, p.285 Urechia collaborated with Dimitrie August Laurian and ≈ûtefan MichƒÉilescu on the anti-Junimist, Romantic and pro-liberal tribune Revista ContimporanƒÉ after 1873. Critic and historian Tudor Vianu saw Urechia as the group's spiritus rector,Vianu, p.236 while literary historian George CƒÉlinescu wrote: \\"[the journal] had prestige and, intimately, the Junimists grew worried.\\"George CƒÉlinescu, p.515 In its first issue, it hosted Urechia's study on 17th century Moldavian chronicler Miron Costin and his writings, as well as historical pieces by Gheorghe Sion and Pantazi Ghica, all of which were soon after criticized by Maiorescu in his essay Be≈£ia de cuvinte (\\"Inebriation with Words\\").Boia, p.86; CƒÉlinescu, p.515; Ornea, p.291-293; Vianu, p.236-237 Titu Maiorescu, Be≈£ia de cuvinte √Æn \\"Revista ContimporanƒÉ\\" (wikisource) In parallel, Urechia had a conflict with the Jewish writer and pedagogue Ronetti Roman, whom he had employed teacher at his Institute.CƒÉlinescu, p.554 In his pamphlet Domnul Kanitferstan (Mr. Kanitferstan\\"), Ronetti Roman reported having been shocked to discover that Urechia was an antisemite. Michael Shafir, \\"Un 'desuet' (sau actualitatea lui Ronetti Roman)\\", in Contemporanul, Nr. 8/2009 After the Russo-Turkish War which granted Romania its independence, Urechia represented the country to the International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences, and presided over one of its sessions. Later in the year, he was invited to participate in the Congress on literature in London, England. In 1879, he was elected member of an Aromanian cultural league, the Macedo-Romanian Cultural Society, becoming its president the following year and editing its historiographic textbook, Albumul macedo-rom√¢n (\\"The Macedo-Romanian Album\\"). He was presented with a bronze medal by the Soci√©t√© d'Ethnographie in 1880, and, the following year, received its medal of honor. The same body created the Urechia Prize for Ethnographic Research, first awarded in 1882, and awarded him lifetime membership of the Institut d'Ethnographie. Between 1878 and 1889, he grouped his earlier writings under the title Opere complete (\\"Complete Works\\"). =Political preeminence and Literatorul years= Title page of Istoria rom√¢nilor, Volume III, 1892 Title page of Istoria ≈ücoalelor, Volume IV, 1901 In 1881-1882, Urechia was Romania's Education Minister under National Liberal Premiers Dimitrie BrƒÉtianu and Ion BrƒÉtianu, in the newly proclaimed Kingdom of Romania. According to George CƒÉlinescu, his appointment had been prepared since 1880. CƒÉlinescu cites Urechia's intense correspondence with Alexandru Odobescu, who was then living in Paris. Odobescu had initially asked Urechia to manage his chair at the University, and, CƒÉlinescu argues, his tone became \\"fawning\\" as Urechia received confirmation for his political ambitions.CƒÉlinescu, p.348 As Minister, Urechia tasked Odobescu with approaching Hermiona, the widow of French historian Edgar Quinet and daughter of Romanian intellectual Gheorghe Asachi, and recovering some of Quinet's notes for publishing in Albumul macedo-rom√¢n. While reviewing and reshuffling the Ministry, Urechia dismissed the socialist and atheist activist Ioan NƒÉdejde from his position as teacher,CƒÉlinescu, p.546 and played a part in the decision to curb the spread of socialism among the faculty of Ia≈üi University. However, he cast aside political preferences to assign Junimist author Ion Luca Caragiale the position of inspector in the counties of Suceava and Neam≈£.Vianu, p.180 Urechia had prepared a program for administrative reform at several levels, but the brevity of his term prevented him from putting it into practice. By then, Urechia had also begun collaborating with the younger anti- Junimist and later Symbolist poet Alexandru Macedonski. In 1881, Minister Urechia granted Macedonski the Bene-Merenti medal 1st class, even though, CƒÉlinescu argues, the poet had been a civil servant for no more than 18 months.CƒÉlinescu, p.519 A year later, he appointed Macedonski to the post of Historical Monuments Inspector. Also in 1882, he accepted Macedonski's offer to become president of a society formed around the magazine Literatorul.CƒÉlinescu, p.529; Vianu, p.351 In 1883, following Macedonski's attacks on Junimist author Mihai Eminescu, later recognized as national poet, the irreverent exposure of Eminescu's mental illness and the widespread condemnation which ensued, Literatorul went out of print.CƒÉlinescu, p.519, 520-521; Vianu, p.353-361, 387 It resurfaced sporadically after that date, notably in 1885, as Revista LiterarƒÉ, and continued to receive contributions from Urechia, Anghel Demetriescu, Th. M. Stoenescu and Bonifaciu Florescu, but was eventually turned by Macedonski into a voice for the local Symbolist movement.CƒÉlinescu, p.516, 520; Vianu, Vol.II, p.363 Urechia grew disillusioned with National Liberal politics, and voted against his party when he felt that their politics no longer coincided with his own views. By 1885, he also made his peace with Junimea, which was generally offering its support to the newly founded Conservative Party, and became a collaborator of its mouthpiece Convorbiri Literare, contributing essays and stories until 1892.Vianu, p.237 Also in 1885, he published his novella Logof. Baptiste Veleli (\\"The LogofƒÉt Baptiste Veleli\\"), set in the 17th century. His varied scientific interests led him to correspond with Iuliu Popper, the Romanian- born explorer of Patagonia, who notably described to Urechia the lawlessness of Punta Arenas, Chile. Ioan Stanomir, \\"Toate p√Ænzele sus!\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 100, January 2002 Late in his life, V. A. Urechia concentrated on historical research. This led him to write and publish Istoria rom√¢nilor (\\"The History of Romanians\\", 14 vols., 1891‚Äì1903) and Istoria ≈ücoalelor (\\"The History of Schools\\", 4 vols., 1892‚Äì1901).CƒÉlinescu, p.529; Ornea, p.297 After 1889, he also resumed activities in the area of bibliography, turning his own collection into a public library to benefit Gala≈£i city. He also edited and collected the work of Miron Costin, producing and editing an eponymous 1890 monograph, together with a similar work dedicated to 19th century Moldavian intellectual Gheorghe Asachi. In 1891, his scattered essays, novellas, memoirs and stories based on Romanian folklore themes were collectively published by as Legende rom√¢ne (\\"Romanian Legends\\"). That year, he left for London, where he attended the International Congress of Orientalists and received the honorary diploma for supporting the Congress' activities at an international level. During the final part of the 1880s, V. A. Urechia partook in a scandal involving LazƒÉr ≈ûƒÉineanu, a foreign-educated Jewish-Romanian linguist, during which time he made a series of antisemitic statements. ≈ûƒÉineanu, who, like most other members of the Jewish community, was not legally emancipated, had been assigned to a Faculty of Letters position by Titu Maiorescu, at the time Education Minister in a Conservative Party cabinet. Urechia and his partisans reacted strongly against this measure, arguing that ≈ûƒÉineanu was made unqualified by his ethnicity, until ≈ûƒÉineanu presented his resignation to Maiorescu. Laszlo Alexandru, \\"Un savant cƒÉlcat √Æn picioare (I)\\", in Tribuna, Nr. 151, December 2008 In 1889, when ≈ûƒÉineanu requested naturalization, Urechia intervened with the National Liberal politician Dimitrie Sturdza, head of a committee charged with enforcing nationality law, asking him to deny the request. A deadlock ensued and, in both 1889 and 1895, the matter came to be deliberated by the Senate. Although it won support from both Conservative Premier Petre P. Carp and the Chamber, Urechia again spoke out against enfranchise in the Senate, and, largely as a result of this appeal, a majority of his colleagues voted with him on both occasions. =Cultural League establishment and final years= The unveiling of Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu's monument in Gala≈£i, an event attended by Urechia (1893) The early 1890s saw Urechia's involvement in the cause of Romanians living outside the confines of the Old Kingdom. Like other liberal activists, he hoped to see Romania united with Transylvania and the Banat, regions then included in Austria-Hungary and administered by the Kingdom of Hungary. Urechia viewed with sympathy the formation of a National Party in that region, and supported it throughout the Transylvanian Memorandum movement of 1892, when many of its leaders were jailed by Hungarian authorities. He appealed for support throughout Europe, and, in 1893, collected the interventions of his foreign peers in a single volume, known in Romanian as Voci latine. De la fra≈£i la fra≈£i (\\"Latin Voices. From Brothers to Brothers\\"). As leader of the newly founded Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians, he campaigned in the international press, resulting in some 500 newspaper articles on the Memorandum trial. These actions made partisans of Austria-Hungary regard him as an agent of dissent. In 1894, he was engaged in a heated polemic over these issues with the Hungarian officer Istv√°n T√ºrr, who had published articles condemning the Memorandum participants and their Bucharest-based partisans. It involved other politicians in 1895, when Urechia attended the Interparliamentary Union's Conference in Brussels, Belgium, and debated the matter with members of the Hungarian legislature. Urechia was vice-president of the Senate in 1896-1897. During those years, he became Chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur, honorary member and later honorary president of the Conseil H√©raldique de France, foreign member of the French Archaeological Society, and associate member of the Spanish Red Cross, and Ecuador's consul general to Romania. Attending the October 1899 International Congress of Orientalists in Rome, he organized a Pan-Latinist festivity centered on Trajan's Column, with the participation of Luigi Pelloux cabinet ministers and the Transylvanian peasant activist Badea C√¢r≈£an. Although the ceremony enjoyed popularity and coverage in the press, Urechia and his Cultural League were frustrated by lack of funds in their attempt to organize a living exhibit of Romanian customs. He attended the 1900 congress of the Union of Latin Students, meeting in the French town of Al√®s, and delivered an opening speech in which the main theme was Pan-Latinism. The same year, he published a series of memoirs and travel writing pieces, under the title Din tainele vie≈£ii (\\"Some of Life's Secrets\\"). Urechia died in Bucharest at age 67. His funeral oration was delivered by archaeologist Grigore Tocilescu, while the Academy's commemorative session was presided over by his former rival Hasdeu. Ideology, literary contributions and cultural debates =Tenets= V. A. Urechia was a prolific author, whose bibliography reportedly exceeds 600 individual titles, covering both fiction and scientific works. Reflecting on the period, modern-day historian Lucian Boia argues that, while Urechia stood above all his pro-liberal academic colleagues in respect to his \\"industriousness\\", they all lacked scientific competence. Boia, who notes that Urechia's works are generally compilations, concludes that their author was motivated by \\"fervent but na√Øve patriotism\\".Boia, p.81 Urechia's main contribution was as an ideologue of the liberal current, and relates to his version of patriotism, called rom√¢nism (\\"Romanianism\\"). Seen by him as distinct from nationalism, it involved the ongoing promotion of a common spiritual identity among Romanians, a focus on popularizing local folklore, and a cultural version of Pan-Latinism. From early on, Urechia argued in favor of a federal Latin bloc to counter the threats of Pan-Slavism and Pan- Germanism. In 1859, a letter he sent to Sardinian Premier Camillo Benso di Cavour, in which he introduced the Moldavian scholarship recipients to the University of Turin, made reference to Pan-Latin sentiments and the Romanian origins: \\"Turn our young Romanians into something better than savants; make them Latins, proud descendants of Rome, the mother of their nation.\\" Part of his subsequent studies dealt with the comparative linguistics of Romance: like many of his fellow intellectuals, Urechia was determined to find the exact position of Romanian in relation to the Latin language, Standard Italian or Italian dialects (see History of the Romanian language). Teresa Ferro, \\"Le concordanze della lingua romena con i dialetti italiani: storia delle ricerche e prospettive di studio\\", in the University of Ia≈üi's Philologica Jassyensia, Nr. 1-2/2005, p.37-38 Thus, in an 1868 essay, Urechia theorized a \\"parallelism\\" between Romanian and Friulian, his conclusion being similar to one earlier voiced (and eventually discarded) by Graziadio Isaia Ascoli. Urechia saw in the application of Romanianism a cultural battle for improvement, writing: \\"A nation incapable of developing is incapable of defending its existence. This is why all nations, recognizing in culture the primordial condition of their existence and grandeur, have struggled to make use of all their forces in order to advance culturally. [...] For today culture is the strongest and non-invincible weapon.\\" His writings frequently made the controversial claim that Romanians had perfected various elements of human civilization before all other peoples (see Protochronism).Boia, p.81, 86-87 Based on his theories about social cohesion, Urechia also expressed his distaste for political factionalism. An article of his in Adunarea Na≈£ionalƒÉ reacted against the split between the National Liberal group (the \\"Reds\\") and the Conservative Party (the \\"Whites\\"): \\"Victory will only be possible when Romanianism is neither red nor white\\". Late in his life, the writer coined another term, daco-rom√¢nism (\\"Daco-Romanianism\\"), which referenced the ancient territory of Dacia and, through it, to the ideal of grouping together all territories inhabited by Romanians outside the Old Kingdom's borders. This allusion to Transylvania contributed to his polemic with Austro-Hungarian authorities, who came to regard the term with suspicion. At the same time, Urechia sought to build contacts with representatives of other Romance- speaking communities in the Balkans, Aromanians as well as Megleno-Romanians and Istro-Romanians, as well as with Romanian leaders from Bukovina and Bessarabia. After the Russo-Turkish War, when Romanian rule was extended to formerly Ottoman Northern Dobruja, he called for the region's Romanianization through colonization and changes in toponymy. Urechia's had conflicting attitudes on the cohabitation of Romanians and ethnic minorities. His Coliba MƒÉriucƒÉi, one of the first novels in Romanian literature to explore social problems from a critical perspective, and written just as slavery was being outlawed in Moldavia, he expresses sympathy for the persecuted Romani community. In contrast with this approach, the statements made by Urechia in his conflict with LazƒÉr ≈ûƒÉineanu show an antisemitic side to his Romanianism, which academic Michael Shafir rates as \\"cultural\\" and \\"economic\\" rather than \\"racial\\". While debating ≈ûƒÉineanu's status in academia, Urechia claimed: \\"A person foreign to our nation's fiber could never awaken in the mind and heart of the young generation the image of our past [...]. How will that person recognize those pulsations in the historical life of Romanians, when he has nothing in common with [the people's] aspirations?\\" Urechia was especially adverse to ≈ûƒÉineanu's study on the traditional references to Jews as \\"Tatars\\" and Uria≈üi, as a reference to an Early Medieval presence of Khazars in present-day Romanian territories. He therefore publicly accused ≈ûƒÉineanu of making it seem that the Jews had a historical precedent over Romanians. Literary critic Laszlo Alexandru writes that Urechia's reading of the text was \\"in bad faith\\", and his conclusions \\"slanderous\\". In 1895, during the final Senate vote on ≈ûƒÉineanu's naturalization, Urechia gave an applauded speech in which he likened the linguist with the Trojan Horse, urging his fellow parliamentarians not to allow \\"a foreigner into the Romanian citadel\\". =Be≈£ia de cuvinte= As part of their Romantic reaction against the Junimist call for professionalization, controlled modernization and Westernization, the Revista ContimporanƒÉ group sought to portray the liberal approach as motivated by historical precedence. George CƒÉlinescu writes: \\"By studying, as superficially and bombastically as they did, a [medieval] chronicler [...], the group sought to inculcate the idea of tradition.\\" Titu Maiorescu had by then reacted against this approach, accusing his adversaries of enforcing \\"forms without substance\\" (that is, ill-adapted to the Romanian realities which they claimed to address), and directed his accusations specifically against the University of Bucharest faculty, exposing the heads of department for lacking training in their fields of choice.Boia, p.80-81 Maiorescu replied to his adversaries in Be≈£ia de cuvinte, where he emphasized his group's overall rejection and occasional derision of traditional Romanian literature, and commented that both the model and its defenders had produced a characteristically prolix style.CƒÉlinescu, p.515; Vianu, p.235-237 The Junimist figure also focused on discussing errors in Urechia's works, particularly when it came to his pronouncements on the philosophy of history. According to Maiorescu, the context had conflated two separate topics into one phrase, and unwittingly made it seem that the 18th-century philosophe Voltaire was active in the 17th century.CƒÉlinescu, p.416; Ornea, p.292 Titu Maiorescu, RƒÉspunsurile \\"Revistei Contimporane\\" (wikisource) CƒÉlinescu used this point to illustrate Maiorescu's polemic technique, which involved presenting his adversaries with \\"propositions cruelly selected from the textbook on logic\\". The text referenced other false claims made by Urechia, questioning his competence. It cited him arguing that the 4th-century Imperial Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus was a source on the 5th-century rule of Attila the Hun, that philosophers Gottfried Leibniz and Ren√© Descartes were historians, and that painter Cimabue was an architect.Ornea, p.292 In what Lucian Boia deems \\"perhaps [his] most successful page\\", Maiorescu ridiculed Urechia's claim that 18th-century Wallachian poet IenƒÉchi≈£ƒÉ VƒÉcƒÉrescu was superior to Germany's Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.Boia, p.86 Urechia, Laurian, Ghica and Petru GrƒÉdi≈üteanu decided to issue a common reply to Maiorescu's accusations, using Rosetti's newspaper Rom√¢nul as their venue.Ornea, p.293 One of Urechia's texts in the series accused Maiorescu of \\"mocking for the urge of mocking\\", and called Be≈£ia de cuvinte \\"an unqualifiable diatribe\\".Vianu, p.236-237 He defended his group as the true representatives of a cultural line leading back to the Wallachian uprising of 1821, and rhetorically asked Maiorescu: \\"could it be true that in these 50 years all that was planted in the national soil are feather grass and creeping thistle?\\"Ornea, p.294-295 Tudor Vianu, who believes Urechia had \\"too much knowledge of things\\", cautions that \\"[his] pen would slide too fast over paper\\". He defines Urechia's reply as \\"gauche and prolix\\". While he criticizes Urechia's views on history, literary historian Z. Ornea believes that he was justified in opposing Junimist \\"exclusivism\\", especially when rejecting Maiorescu's theory that the state needed to redesign its educational system by closing down universities and building more primary schools.Ornea, p.295-296 Maiorescu himself answered to his critics in another article, detailing their rebuttals and arguing that they were proof of ignoratio elenchi.CƒÉlinescu, p.416; Ornea, p.293 Elsewhere, the same critic stated his amusement at reading in Adunarea Na≈£ionalƒÉ that the 1859 union had spurred on the Risorgimento and German unification, and that the 1784 Transylvanian rebellion had made possible the French Revolution.Boia, p.86-87 An unsigned article published the conservative newspaper Timpul in 1877, believed by literary historian Z. Ornea to be the work of Maiorescu, accuses V. A. Urechia, Xenofon Gheorghiu, Nicolae Ionescu, ≈ûtefan ≈ûendrea, Andrei Vizanti and others of being inactive academics and corrupt public figures.Ornea, p.293-295 Such criticism was being repeated in later years: writing some twenty years later, Urechia expressed his disappointment that a Bucharest journal had more recently mocked his activist stance and had referred to him as a \\"road junction orator\\". Personal life Urechia's marriage to Luiza produced three children: sons Nestor and Alceu and daughter Corina. The Urechias' relationship, likened by CƒÉlinescu to a \\"Greek tragedy\\", was the topic of innuendo and scandal. Painter Nicolae Grigorescu was allegedly in love with Luiza Wirth, and painted several portraits of her, including one in the nude. George LƒÉcƒÉtu≈ü, Ioana Calen, \\"Comoara de 50 de milioane euro pierdutƒÉ de Muzeul de ArtƒÉ\\", in Cotidianul, January 23, 2007 The latter painting was described by CƒÉlinescu as \\"indiscreet [and] voluptuous\\". Their marriage was allegedly a m√©nage √† trois, involving Luiza's sister Ana. Rumors also had it that the two other Wirth sisters, Carlotta, who was Queen Elisabeth's music tutor, and Emilia, wife of Romanian Army General Staff Chief Nicolae Dona, were also V. A. Urechia's lovers. Such claims of sororal polygyny were notably popularized by Eminescu, who once described Urechia as a \\"poor fellow who has two keep two sisters as his wives.\\" Story has it that Dona's son, officer Alexandru Guri≈£ƒÉ, was Urechia's illegitimate son. Oblivious to this, Guri≈£ƒÉ had fallen in love with Corina and was planning to marry her, before Urechia stepped in and revealed that they would be committing incest. The two lovers committed suicide. After her divorce from Urechia, Luiza lived with I. G. Cantacuzino; their son was Gheorghe Cantacuzino-GrƒÉnicerul, future general and provisional leader of the fascist Iron Guard. In early 1882, after she remarried a man named Hristu Cu≈£iana, but died in August of the same year. Legacy Urechia, flanked by writers Alexandru Vlahu≈£ƒÉ (left) and Barbu ≈ûtefƒÉnescu Delavrancea, in an 1889 photograph 2016 postage stamp commemorating 125 years since Romania joined the Interparliamentary Union and featuring Urechia, who led its first delegation Junimist sentiments regarding Urechia were backed by several authoritative critics in later periods. Thus, CƒÉlinescu dismissed the author's overall contribution to literature as \\"mawkish\\", and referred to Legende rom√¢ne as \\"almost trivial in style.\\" In contrast, Vianu believes the latter to be \\"entertainingly told\\". According to the 1995 Cambridge Guide to Theatre, Urechia was \\"most successful as an author of historical melodramas\\", but, like his contemporaries George Bengescu-Dabija, Haralamb Lecca, Ronetti Roman and Grigore Ventura, is \\"no longer in fashion.\\" From early on, Urechia was defended against criticism by people who shared his views. In his speech to commemorate the writer's death, Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu claimed: \\"As an agitator for the benefit and growth of the Romanian nation, Urechia was sublime; no one shall replace him, nothing shall be able to shadow him when it comes to our national history, in which he will endure as an archangel of enthusiasm in the memory of all Romanians\\". According to cultural historian Ovidiu Pecican, Hasdeu, with political support from National Liberal leader Ion BrƒÉtianu, managed to impose a nationalist cultural model to compete with Junimea, thus ensuring that both Urechia and his rival ≈ûƒÉineanu, alongside George Dem. Teodorescu, Grigore Tocilescu, George Ionescu-Gion, Alexandru Vlahu≈£ƒÉ and other Bucharest-based figures, addressed an alternative and autonomous milieu. Ovidiu Pecican, \\"Noi exerci≈£ii exegetice eminescologice\\", in Observator Cultural, Nr. 444, October 2008 Partly building on the observations made by literary critic Alexandru George, Z. Ornea notes that, for all his \\"real inadequacies\\", Urechia \\"was but moreover became incontestably superior to many members of [Junimea] who were much amused when reading Maiorescu's admirable lampoon.\\"Ornea, p.296-297 Ornea also concluded that, with his final historical works, particularly Istoria ≈ücoalelor, Urechia contributed texts \\"relevant to this day\\".Ornea, p.297 Although Maiorescu's early treatment of Urechia's work left an enduring impact on his public image, the author came to be viewed with more sympathy during the 20th century. Among the influential monographs which reclaimed part of his writings was one published by Alexandru George in 1976. According to Ornea, it and other such works \\"reclaim a fairer and more lenient posterity.\\" Urechia's work as a teacher and cultural promoter also reflected on intellectual life: dramatist Alexandru Davila was one of the V. A. Urechia Institute graduates,CƒÉlinescu, p.653 and, according to Tudor Vianu, Urechia's post-1870s support for Macedonski, together with similar efforts by Ionescu-Gion, Tocilescu, Anghel Demetriescu, Bonifaciu Florescu, Th. M. Stoenescu, was largely responsible for passing down \\"a better and truer image of the abused poet.\\"Vianu, Vol.II, p.388-389 After World War I, Alceu Urechia issued protests against the intellectual establishment, who, he argued, had obscured his father's contribution to the historical process whereby Greater Romania had been created. Historian Nicolae Iorga, who took over chairmanship of the Cultural League in 1932, paid tribute to his predecessor, referring to his \\"unbound wish to be of service in every area and his great talent to win over by means of an appealing form of vanity\\". Although their author was the recipient of much criticism over his inconsistencies, V. A. Urechia's books enjoyed a steady popularity. This was in particular the case with Legende rom√¢ne, parts of which were translated into Italian. Unlike his other texts, Legende was prevented by Hungarian censors from circulating within Transylvania, and had to make its way in only through the Cisleithanian part of the monarchy. It was republished in a 1904 definitive edition by Editura Socec. His Albumul macedo- rom√¢n and Voci latine were placed by art historian Gheorghe Oprescu among \\"the most beautiful and elegant turn-of-the-century Romanian books.\\" In 1878, to mark his presence at the International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences, the Soci√©t√© d'Ethnographie presented Urechia with a bust in his likeness, sculpted by Wladimir Hegel. Thirty-three years later, his Transylvanian collaborators dedicated him an album, which included a poem written especially for him by George Co≈übuc. Urechia's book collection, which he had turned into a public library, is managed by the city of Gala≈£i. In addition to the writings of his adversaries Maiorescu and Eminescu, Urechia was the subject of satirical pieces written by various other authors. They include his employee Ronetti Roman and the Junimist figure Iacob Negruzzi.Vianu, p.88 Grigorescu's portraits of Luiza Urechia, including the nude (which is said to be worth 100,000 euros), found their way into the art collection of General Dona's son, physician Iosif Dona, and were later inherited by the National Museum of Art. The museum lost ownership of the entire Dona collection in 2007, after its property rights were successfully disputed in court by rival claimants.

History Velcro, invented by de Mestral Swiss electrical engineer George de Mestral invented his first touch fastener when, in 1941, he went for a walk in the woods and wondered why burdock seeds clung to his coat and dog. He discovered it could be turned into something useful. He patented it in 1955, and subsequently refined and developed its practical manufacture until its commercial introduction in the late 1950s. The fastener consisted of two components: a lineal fabric strip with tiny hooks that could \\"mate\\" with another fabric strip with smaller loops, attaching temporarily, until pulled apart. Initially made of cotton, which proved impractical, the fastener was eventually constructed with nylon and polyester.

It is across the Nile from Mit Ghamr city of Ad Daqahliyah governorate. History In the 12th century, Zefta was an important regional trading center, especially for textiles; silk, flax, indigo, sesame, and sugar were among the commodities bought and sold here. Some of these products were consumed locally, while others were sent to other towns, including Cairo. In the 1670s, Abbas Agha, the Chief Eunuch of the Ottoman Empire, made a large waqf endowment consisting of diverse Egyptian properties. Zefta was home to the single largest number of properties he endowed, leading Jane Hathaway to describe it as his \\"pet charity\\". Among Abbas Agha's endowments in Zefta was a large complex where coffee beans were pounded and roasted, along with an associated coffeehouse. Hathaway hypothesizes that, given its earlier importance as a trade center, 17th-century Zefta remained an important entrepot where boats carrying coffee from Suez to Cairo would stop. From Zefta, the coffee would then have been taken into other towns for consumption. Other properties Abbas Agha endowed in Zifta included a qaysariyya, caravanserai, fifteen shops and two workshops, and a school teaching the Qur'an - the only school included in the endowment. He also left four copper vessels to the physicians of Zefta, a rare exception to the rule that waqf endowments must consist of immovable property. The 1885 Census of Egypt recorded Zifta as a city in its own district in Gharbia Governorate; at that time, the population of the city was 11,087 (5,571 men and 5,516 women). Zefta is well known in the modern Egyptian history during the 1919 uprising, lately called Egyptian Revolution of 1919, when the British occupation expelled Saad Zaghloul Pasha out of Egypt along other leaders of Wafd Party and were exiled to Malta, the people of Zefta, led by Youssef El Guindi, gathered and declared their independence of the crown and named it Zefta Republic. The town of Zefta has also seen the birth of Mostafa Younis, who works in the field of aviation, Fouad Younis, who works as an accountant and the engineer Moghad Younis. Zefta, is the location of one of Nile barrages built during 1881‚Äì1952 to control the Nile flow. Notable figures born in or around Zefta include: Kimon Evan Marengo, Mostafa Kamal Tolba , Mostafa El-Sayed, Mark Ibn Kunbar, Ahmed Seif al-Islam Keshty and Eman Hassaballa Aly.

Corbet was a strict disciplinarian, who regularly beat his men for the slightest infractions: so brutal was his regime that he provoked two mutinies, one simply at the rumour he was coming aboard a ship. These uprisings caused him to become even more vicious in his use of punishments and when he took his frigate HMS Africaine into action off √éle Bourbon, his men failed to support him and may even have murdered him. In addition to his obsession with discipline and obedience, Corbet was regarded as an inefficient commander, whose standards of gunnery and training were so poor that when his ship did go into action it was ill-equipped to fight the French frigates stationed in the Indian Ocean. Early service Corbet was born in Shropshire; otherwise little is known of his childhood and youth. No connection of Corbet's paternal line has been discovered to the ancient Shropshire armigerous family: his parents were Robert Corbet of Wexford, Ireland, a captain in the Royal Navy and Susannah Woodward; his grandfather was the Rev Francis Corbet, Dean of St Patrick's, Dublin; his great- grandfather was Thomas Corbet, a merchant from Dunganon, Tyrone. In December 1796, he was promoted to lieutenant and in 1801 served in the Egyptian campaign in command of the cutter . She was wrecked off the coast of Egypt while under his command. In 1802 he was promoted to commander and in 1803 took command of the sloop HMS Bittern in the Mediterranean, catching the eye of Lord Horatio Nelson, who was impressed by him and in 1805 promoted him to captain in command of the frigate HMS Amfitrite. Whilst in command of Bittern he chased a French privateer, Hirondelle for 36 hours in a flat calm, with his crew at the sweeps the whole time. Four months later he moved to HMS Seahorse and in 1806 was transferred to the Jamaica station. In November 1806 Corbet returned to Britain and commissioned HMS Nereide, escorting transport ships to the British invasion of the River Plate. During his time in command of Nereide, Corbet gained a reputation for brutality, inflicting 134 floggings in just 211 days, with an average of 17 lashes each time. Even by the standards of the time, this was a vicious regime. After the collapse of the expedition, Nereide was attached to the squadron at the Cape of Good Hope and in 1808 was sent for refit at Bombay. On arrival Corbet assumed command of the port over the local officers, provoking a strong rebuke from the admiral in command of the Far East station, Sir Edward Pellew. In Bombay his crew, frustrated by the brutal and arbitrary treatment meted out by their captain, issued a complaint against him. In response Corbet requested a formal court martial, but was forced to wait until his ship returned to the Cape of Good Hope due to a shortage of captains of sufficient rank. Corbet neglected to explain this to the crew and when he ordered them to sail for the Cape they mutinied in the belief that their complaint had been ignored. The mutiny was suppressed by local forces in Bombay and when Nereide did reach the Cape ten men were tried and one hanged for disobedience. At his court martial, Corbet insisted that \\"Severity must depend upon circumstances, and whenever I have been severe, circumstances have rendered it necessary\\" and was cleared of unnecessary cruelty, instead being issued with a minor reprimand for beating his men with sticks larger than those required by Admiralty instructions. Mauritius campaign In late 1808, Nereide was attached to the squadron under Josias Rowley ordered to blockade the French colonies of √éle Bonaparte and √éle de France. In the Action of 31 May 1809, French frigate Caroline captured two East Indiamen and took them into Saint Paul on √éle Bonaparte. Rowley counterattacked by storming the port and capturing the East Indiamen and Caroline. Corbet and Nereide played an important part of the attack, entering the harbour to engage the French ships from close range. Caroline was renamed HMS Bourbonnaise and Corbet given command, sent back to Britain with despatches. On arrival in Britain in early 1810, Corbet was transferred to HMS Africaine, which ship was deemed more appropriate for service in the Indian Ocean, to which Corbet was ordered to return. When word that Corbet was to take command arrived on board Africaine, the crew protested to the Admiralty, furious that such a brutal captain had been placed in command of them. They also warned that they would take steps to prevent Corbet from embarking the ship should he attempt to come aboard. Claiming mutiny, Corbet requested support and Admiral Edward Buller was sent aboard to listen to the crews complaints. In addition, the frigate HMS Menelaus pulled alongside and threatened to fire on the mutineers unless they allowed Corbet aboard. Under pressure, the crew relented and Corbet took command. Returning to the Indian Ocean, Corbet was destined for Madras when he stopped at Rodriguez and discovered that most of Rowley's squadron had been destroyed at the Battle of Grand Port. Recognising that Rowley needed urgent reinforcement, Corbet immediately sailed to √éle de France. Arriving off the island on 11 September, Rowley discovered the small French ship No. 23 sheltering inshore and attacked it with his ship's boats. The attack was a failure, the boat party suffering heavy casualties and Corbet sailed for √éle Bourbon (formerly √éle Bonaparte) to land his wounded. There he united with Rowley's flagship HMS Boadicea and two smaller ships and attacked the French blockading force of the frigates Astr√©e and Iphig√©nie under Pierre Bouvet. During the night of 12 September, Africaine outran her compatriots and attacked both French ships in the darkness. On the second broadside from Astr√©e, Corbet's right foot was shot off, the captain collapsing to the deck and being taken below. Although their captain had gone, the crew continued to fight and Astr√©e hauled off to allow Iphig√©nie to attack. Two hours later, Africaine surrendered, her casualties mounting and the ship in a battered state. The French took possession but later abandoned the ship when Boadicea arrived. By the time British officers had resumed control of the ship, Corbet was dead. Almost immediately rumours spread that his death had not simply been the result of his wound: Stories were repeated in reputable histories that Corbet had been either murdered by his crew, or committed suicide to avoid the shame of defeat. Although the truth is unknown, Corbet's crew had displayed an unwillingness to enter action with him in command and once he was dead expressed a desire to pursue the French ships despite their own damage and casualties. The debate about Corbet's final action continued for many years: the contemporary historian Basil Hall was the subject of a lawsuit in 1820 over his claim that Corbet's men had refused to load their cannon and preferred death at the hands of the French to continued service under their brutal captain. The case was proven and Hall forced to make a retraction. Attention has also focused on Corbet's failure to train his men in the accurate and efficient use of their cannon, preferring to maintain the order and cleanliness of his ship than exercise his gun teams. In literature A fictionalised account of the events leading up to Corbet's death is given in Patrick O'Brian's novel, The Mauritius Command, in which Rowley is replaced as the commander of the squadron by O'Brian's protagonist, Jack Aubrey.

He is more prominently mentioned in the post-Vedic Hindu epics and the mythologies in the Puranas. In the epics, he is conflated with Purusha. Although Brahma is part of the Brahma-Vishnu-Shiva Trimurti, ancient Hindu scriptures mention multiple other trinities of gods or goddesses which do not include Brahma.David White (2006), Kiss of the Yogini, University of Chicago Press, , pages 4, 29 During the post vedic period, Brahma was a prominent deity, however he was slowly out shadowed by Vishnu, Shiva and Shakti. During the period Brahma was frequently attacked by Buddhist and Jain followers. Early texts suggest that Brahma created himself in a golden egg known as Hiranyagarbha. After he created himself, he then created the entire universe, Vedas and people. The avatar Varaha was first attributed to Brahma. Later Puranas describe him as emerging from a lotus, connected to the navel of Lord Vishnu. Other Puranas suggest that he is born from Shiva or his aspects,Stella Kramrisch (1994), The Presence of Siva, Princeton University Press, , pages 205-206 or he is a supreme god in diverse versions of Hindu mythology.Charles Coulter and Patricia Turner (2000), Encyclopedia of Ancient Deities, Routledge, , page 258, Quote: \\"When Brahma is acknowledged as the supreme god, it was said that Kama sprang from his heart.\\" Brahma, along with other deities, is sometimes viewed as a form (saguna) of the otherwise formless (nirguna) Brahman, the ultimate metaphysical reality in Vedantic Hinduism.Jan Gonda (1969), The Hindu Trinity, Anthropos, Bd 63/64, H 1/2, pages 212-226David Leeming (2009), Creation Myths of the World, 2nd Edition, , page 146; David Leeming (2005), The Oxford Companion to World Mythology, Oxford University Press, , page 54, Quote: \\"Especially in the Vedanta Hindu Philosophy, Brahman is the Absolute. In the Upanishads, Brahman becomes the eternal first cause, present everywhere and nowhere, always and never. Brahman can be incarnated in Brahma, in Vishnu, in Shiva. To put it another way, everything that is, owes its existence to Brahman. In this sense, Hinduism is ultimately monotheistic or monistic, all gods being aspects of Brahman\\"; Also see pages 183-184, Quote: \\"Prajapati, himself the source of creator god Brahma ‚Äì in a sense, a personification of Brahman (...) Moksha, the connection between the transcendental absolute Brahman and the inner absolute Atman.\\" In an alternate version, some Puranas state him to be the father of Prajapatis. According to some, Brahme does not enjoy popular worship in present-age Hinduism and has lesser importance than the other members of the Trimurti, Vishnu and Shiva. Brahma is revered in ancient texts, yet rarely worshiped as a primary deity in India.Brian Morris (2005), Religion and Anthropology: A Critical Introduction, Cambridge University Press, , page 123 Very few temples dedicated to him exist in India; the most famous being the Brahma Temple, Pushkar in Rajasthan.SS Charkravarti (2001), Hinduism, a Way of Life, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 15 Brahma temples are found outside India, such as at the Erawan Shrine in Bangkok.Ellen London (2008), Thailand Condensed: 2,000 Years of History & Culture, Marshall Cavendish, , page 74 Origin and meaning The origins of Brahma are uncertain, in part because several related words such as one for Ultimate Reality (Brahman), and priest (Brahmin) are found in the Vedic literature. The existence of a distinct deity named Brahma is evidenced in late Vedic text.Bruce Sullivan (1999), Seer of the Fifth Veda, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 82-83 A distinction between spiritual concept of Brahman, and deity Brahma, is that the former is a genderless abstract metaphysical concept in Hinduism,James Lochtefeld, Brahman, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A‚ÄìM, Rosen Publishing. , page 122 while the latter is one of the many masculine gods in Hindu tradition.James Lochtefeld, Brahma, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A‚ÄìM, Rosen Publishing. , page 119 The spiritual concept of Brahman is far older, and some scholars suggest deity Brahma may have emerged as a personal conception and visible icon of the impersonal universal principle called Brahman. In Sanskrit grammar, the noun stem brahman forms two distinct nouns; one is a neuter noun br√°hman, whose nominative singular form is '; this noun has a generalized and abstract meaning. Contrasted to the neuter noun is the masculine noun brahm√°n, whose nominative singular form is '.In Devanagari brahma is written .

Brahma is first discussed in verse 5,1, also called the Kutsayana Hymn, and then expounded in verse 5,2. In the pantheistic Kutsayana Hymn, the Upanishad asserts that one's Soul is Brahman, and this Ultimate Reality, Cosmic Universal or God is within each living being. It equates the Atman (Soul, Self) within to be Brahma and various alternate manifestations of Brahman, as follows, \\"Thou art Brahma, thou art Vishnu, thou art Rudra (Shiva), thou art Agni, Varuna, Vayu, Indra, thou art All.\\" In the verse (5,2), Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva are mapped into the theory of Gu·πáa, that is qualities, psyche and innate tendencies the text describes can be found in all living beings.Max Muller, The Upanishads, Part 2, Maitrayana-Brahmana Upanishad, Oxford University Press, pages 303-304Jan Gonda (1968), The Hindu Trinity, Anthropos, Vol. 63, pages 215-219 This chapter of the Maitri Upanishad asserts that the universe emerged from darkness (Tamas), first as passion characterized by action qua action (Rajas), which then refined and differentiated into purity and goodness (Sattva). Of these three qualities, Rajas is then mapped to Brahma, as follows:Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 344-346 While the Maitri Upanishad maps Brahma with one of the elements of Gu·πáa theory of Hinduism, the text does not depict him as one of the trifunctional elements of the Hindu Trimurti idea found in later Puranic literature.GM Bailey (1979), Trifunctional Elements in the theology of the Hindu Trim≈´rti, Numen, Vol. 26, Fasc. 2, pages 152-163 =Post-Vedic, Epics and Puranas= In Vaishnava Puranic scriptures, Brahma emerges on a lotus from Vishnu's navel as Vishnu (Mahavishnu) creates the cosmic cycle, after being emerged by Shiva. Shaivite texts describes that Shiva told Vishnu to create, Shiva ordered Vishnu to make Brahma. During the post vedic period, Brahma was a prominent deity. The early texts describes that there was nothing, but an eternal ocean. From which, a golden egg, called Hiranyagarbha, emerged. The egg broke open and Brahma, who had created himself within it, came into existence (gaining the name Swayambhu). Then, he created the universe, the earth and other things. He also created people to populate and live on his creation. However during that period Brahma was frequently attacked by Buddhist, Jains and even within Hinduism by Vaishnavas and Shaivites. Brahma could not survive these attacks and lose his importance. The post-Vedic texts of Hinduism offer multiple theories of cosmogony, many involving Brahma. These include Sarga (primary creation of universe) and Visarga (secondary creation), ideas related to the Indian thought that there are two levels of reality, one primary that is unchanging (metaphysical) and other secondary that is always changing (empirical), and that all observed reality of the latter is in an endlessly repeating cycle of existence, that cosmos and life we experience is continually created, evolved, dissolved and then re-created.Tracy Pintchman (1994), The Rise of the Goddess in the Hindu Tradition, State University of New York Press, , pages 122-138 The primary creator is extensively discussed in Vedic cosmogonies with Brahman or Purusha or Devi among the terms used for the primary creator,Jan Gonda (1969), The Hindu Trinity, Anthropos, Bd 63/64, H 1/2, pages 213-214 while the Vedic and post-Vedic texts name different gods and goddesses as secondary creators (often Brahma in post-Vedic texts), and in some cases a different god or goddess is the secondary creator at the start of each cosmic cycle (kalpa, aeon). Brahma is a \\"secondary creator\\" as described in the Mahabharata and Puranas, and among the most studied and described.Asian Mythologies by Yves Bonnefoy & Wendy Doniger. Page 46 Born from a lotus emerging from the navel of Vishnu after emerging on order of Shiva, Brahma creates all the forms in the universe, but not the primordial universe itself. In contrast, the Shiva-focussed Puranas describe Brahma and Vishnu to have been created by Ardhanarishvara, that is half Shiva and half Parvati; or alternatively, Brahma was born from Rudra, or Vishnu, Shiva and Brahma creating each other cyclically in different aeons (kalpa). Thus in most Puranic texts, Brahma's creative activity depends on the presence and power of a higher god. Sculpture of Brahma flanked by Yama and Chitragupta, Tamil Nadu, 10th Century In the Bhagavata Purana, Brahma is portrayed several times as the one who rises from the \\"Ocean of Causes\\".Richard Anderson (1967), Hindu Myths in Mallarm√©: Un Coup de D√©s, Comparative Literature, Vol. 19, No. 1, pages 28-35 Brahma, states this Purana, emerges at the moment when time and universe is born, inside a lotus rooted in the navel of Hari (deity Vishnu, whose praise is the primary focus in the Purana). The scriptures assert that Brahma is drowsy, errs and is temporarily incompetent as he puts together the universe. He then becomes aware of his confusion and drowsiness, meditates as an ascetic, then realizes Hari in his heart, sees the beginning and end of the universe, and then his creative powers are revived. Brahma, states Bhagavata Purana, thereafter combines Prakriti (nature, matter) and Purusha (spirit, soul) to create a dazzling variety of living creatures, and tempest of causal nexus. The Bhagavata Purana thus attributes the creation of Maya to Brahma, wherein he creates for the sake of creation, imbuing everything with both the good and the evil, the material and the spiritual, a beginning and an end.Richard Anderson (1967), Hindu Myths in Mallarm√©: Un Coup de D√©s, Comparative Literature, Vol. 19, No. 1, page 31-33 The Puranas describe Brahma as the deity creating time. They correlate human time to Brahma's time, such as a mahƒÅkalpa being a large cosmic period, correlating to one day and one night in Brahma's existence. The stories about Brahma in various Puranas are diverse and inconsistent. In Skanda Purana, for example, goddess Parvati is called the \\"mother of the universe\\", and she is credited with creating Brahma, gods, and the three worlds. She is the one, states Skanda Purana, who combined the three Gunas - Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas - into matter (Prakrti) to create the empirically observed world.Nicholas Gier (1998), The Yogi and the Goddess, International Journal of Hindu Studies, Vol. 1, No. 2, pages 279-280 The Vedic discussion of Brahma as a Rajas-quality god expands in the Puranic and Tantric literature. However, these texts state that his wife Saraswati has Sattva (quality of balance, harmony, goodness, purity, holistic, constructive, creative, positive, peaceful, virtuous), thus complementing Brahma's Rajas (quality of passion, activity, neither good nor bad and sometimes either, action qua action, individualizing, driven, dynamic).H Woodward (1989), The Lak·π£ma·πáa Temple, Khajuraho and Its Meanings, Ars Orientalis, Vol. 19, pages 30-34Alban Widgery (1930), The principles of Hindu Ethics, International Journal of Ethics, Vol. 40, No. 2, pages 234-237Joseph Alter (2004), Yoga in modern India, Princeton University Press, page 55 Iconography Brahma is traditionally depicted with four faces and four arms.Kenneth Morgan (1996), The Religion of the Hindus, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 74 Each face of his points to a cardinal direction. His hands hold no weapons, rather symbols of knowledge and creation. In one hand he holds the sacred texts of Vedas, in second he holds mala (rosary beads) symbolizing time, in third he holds a sruva or shruk ‚Äî ladle types symbolizing means to feed sacrificial fire, and in fourth a kamandalu ‚Äì utensil with water symbolizing the means where all creation emanates from. His four mouths are credited with creating the four Vedas. He is often depicted with a white beard, implying his sage-like experience. He sits on lotus, dressed in white (or red, pink), with his vehicle (vahana) ‚Äì hansa, a swan or goose ‚Äì nearby.Philip Wilkinson and Neil Philip (2009), Mythology, Penguin, , page 156 Chapter 51 of Manasara- Silpasastra, an ancient design manual in Sanskrit for making Murti and temples, states that a Brahma statue should be golden in color.PK Acharya, A summary of the MƒÅnsƒÅra, a treatise on architecture and cognate subjects, PhD Thesis awarded by Rijksuniversiteit te Leiden, published by BRILL, , page 50 The text recommends that the statue have four faces and four arms, have jata- mukuta-mandita (matted hair of an ascetic), and wear a diadem (crown). Two of his hands should be in refuge granting and gift giving mudra, while he should be shown with kundika (water pot), akshamala (rosary), and a small and a large sruk-sruva (laddles used in yajna ceremonies). The text details the different proportions of the murti, describes the ornaments, and suggests that the idol wear chira (bark strip) as lower garment, and either be alone or be accompanied with goddess Saraswati. Brahma is associated largely with the Vedic culture of yajna and knowledge. In some vedic yajna Brahma is summoned in the ritual to reside and supervise the ritual in the form of Prajapati. Brahma's wife is the goddess Saraswati.Elizabeth Dowling and W George Scarlett (2005), Encyclopedia of Religious and Spiritual Development, SAGE Publications, page 204David Kinsley (1988), Hindu Goddesses: Vision of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Traditions, University of California Press, , pages 55-64 She is considered to be \\"the embodiment of his power, the instrument of creation and the energy that drives his actions\\". Brahma had not taken avatar instead believed to descend directly whenever required in Satya Yuga, Treta Yuga and Dvapara Yuga. Temples Tenggerese Hindus in Indonesia believe Mount Bromo is Brahma himself and make pilgrimage during Yadnya Kasada =India= Brahma temples are relatively rare in India. Above: Brahma temple in Pushkar, Rajasthan. Very few temples in India are primarily dedicated to Lord Brahma and his worship. The most prominent Hindu temple for Brahma is the Brahma Temple, Pushkar. Other temples include a temple in Asotra village, Balotra taluka of Rajasthan's Barmer district known as Kheteshwar Brahmadham Tirtha. Brahma is also worshipped in temple complexes dedicated to the Trimurti: Thanumalayan Temple, Uthamar Kovil, Ponmeri Shiva Temple, in Tirunavaya, the Thripaya Trimurti Temple and Mithrananthapuram Trimurti Temple. In Tamil Nadu, Brahma temples exist in the temple town of Kumbakonam, in Kodumudi and within the Brahmapureeswarar Temple in Tiruchirappalli. There is a temple dedicated to Brahma in the temple town of Srikalahasti near Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh. There are a Chaturmukha Brahma temple in Chebrolu, Andhra Pradesh, and a seven feet height of Chatrumukha (Four Faces) Brahma temple at Bangalore, Karnataka. In the coastal state of Goa, a shrine belonging to the fifth century, in the small and remote village of Carambolim, Sattari Taluka in the northeast region of the state is found. A famous icon of Brahma exists at Mangalwedha, 52 km from the Solapur district of Maharashtra and in Sopara near Mumbai. There is a 12th-century temple dedicated to him in Khedbrahma, Gujarat and also a Brahma Kuti Temple in Kanpur. Temples exist in Khokhan, Annamputhur and Hosur. =Southeast Asia= A shrine to Brahma can be found in Cambodia's Angkor Wat. One of the three largest temples in the 9th- century Prambanan temples complex in Yogyakarta, central Java (Indonesia) is dedicated to Brahma, the other two to Shiva (largest of three) and Vishnu respectively.Trudy Ring et al (1996), International Dictionary of Historic Places: Asia and Oceania, Routledge, , page 692 The temple dedicated to Brahma is on the southern side of ≈öiva temple. A statue of Brahma is present at the Erawan Shrine in Bangkok, Thailand and continues to be revered in modern times. The golden dome of the Government House of Thailand houses a statue of Phra Phrom (Thai representation of Brahma). An early 18th-century painting at Wat Yai Suwannaram in Phetchaburi city of Thailand depicts Brahma.Chami Jotisalikorn et al (2002), Classic Thai: Design, Interiors, Architecture., Tuttle, , pages 164-165 The name of the country Burma may be derived from Brahma. In medieval texts, it is referred to as Brahma-desa.Arthur P. Phayre (2013), History of Burma, Routledge, , pages 2-5Gustaaf Houtman (1999), Mental Culture in Burmese Crisis Politics, Tokyo University of Foreign Studies, , page 352 =East Asia= Phra Phrom at Ten Thousand Buddhas Monastery, Sha Tin, Hong Kong Brahma is a popular deity in Chinese folk religion and there are numerous temples devoted to the god in China and Taiwan. Brahma is known in Chinese as Simianshen (ÂõõÈù¢Á•û, \\"Four-Faced God\\") or Fantian (Ê¢µÂ§©), Tshangs pa in Tibetan and Bonten in Japanese. Difference between Brahma, Brahman, Brahmin and Brahmanas Brahma (, brahmƒÅ) is distinct from Brahman. Brahma is a male deity, in the post-Vedic Puranic literature, who creates but neither preserves nor destroys anything. He is envisioned in some Hindu texts to have emerged from the metaphysical Brahman along with Vishnu (preserver), Shiva (destroyer), all other gods, goddesses, matter and other beings. In theistic schools of Hinduism where deity Brahma is described as part of its cosmology, he is a mortal like all gods and goddesses, and dissolves into the abstract immortal Brahman when the universe ends, then a new cosmic cycle (kalpa) restarts. The deity Brahma is mentioned in the Vedas and the Upanishads but is uncommon, while the abstract Brahman concept is predominant in these texts, particularly the Upanishads. In the Puranic and the Epics literature, deity Brahma appears more often, but inconsistently. Some texts suggest that god Vishnu created Brahma, others suggest god Shiva created Brahma, yet others suggest goddess Devi created Brahma, and these texts then go on to state that Brahma is a secondary creator of the world working respectively on their behalf. Further, the medieval era texts of these major theistic traditions of Hinduism assert that the saguna (representation with face and attributes) Brahma is Vishnu, Shiva, or Devi respectively, and that the Atman (soul, self) within every living being is the same or part of this ultimate, eternal Brahman. Brahman (, brahman) is a metaphysical concept of Hinduism referring to the ultimate reality. According to Doniger, the Brahman in the Hindu thought is the uncreated, eternal, infinite, transcendent, the cause, the foundation, the source and the goal of all existence. Brahmin (, Brahmin)Monier Williams (1899), brahmin, Monier William's Sanskrit-English Dictionary, 2nd Edition, Oxford University Press is a varna in Hinduism specializing in theory as priests, preservers and transmitters of sacred literature across generations.James Lochtefeld (2002), Brahmin, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A‚ÄìM, Rosen Publishing, , page 125 The Brahmanas, or Brahmana Granthas, (, brƒÅhma·πáa) are one of the four ancient layers of texts within the Vedas.

As he gets younger he starts feeling more and more confident about himself. Although he first believes the condition is some psychosomatic illness, and initially hides his transforming body from his wife, he soon discovers she knows full well about his predicament, denying him escape from the house. It is strongly implied his wife understands it or is responsible for it (after the realisation that his wife's expected baby is in fact him), however it is never truly revealed what the origin of the condition is, so Freeman continues to get younger, becoming more childlike and tired in the process. After a while Freeman reaches the point where he looks like a toddler and eventually disappears into his wife's womb and his life ends at his conception.

Waste is any substance which is discarded after primary use, or is worthless, defective and of no use. A by-product by contrast is a joint product of relatively minor economic value. A waste product may become a by-product, joint product or resource through an invention that raises a waste product's value above zero. Examples include municipal solid waste (household trash/refuse), hazardous waste, wastewater (such as sewage, which contains bodily wastes (feces and urine) and surface runoff), radioactive waste, and others. Definitions What constitutes waste depends on the eye of the beholder; one person's waste can be a resource for another person. Though waste is a physical object, its generation is a physical and psychological process. In the United States, people who work with waste professionally use four terms - trash, garbage, refuse, and rubbish; trash is dry, garbage is wet, refuse is both and rubbish is refuse plus construction and demolition debris. The definitions used by various agencies are as below. =United Nations Environment Program= According to the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal of 1989, Art. 2(1), \\"'Wastes' are substance or objects, which are disposed of or are intended to be disposed of or are required to be disposed of by the provisions of national law\\".‚ÄúBasel Convention.‚Äù 1989. =United Nations Statistics Division= The UNSD Glossary of Environment StatisticsGlossary of Environment Statistics . 1997. UNSD. Updated web version 2001. describes waste as \\"materials that are not prime products (that is, products produced for the market) for which the generator has no further use in terms of his/her own purposes of production, transformation or consumption, and of which he/she wants to dispose. Wastes may be generated during the extraction of raw materials, the processing of raw materials into intermediate and final products, the consumption of final products, and other human activities. Residuals recycled or reused at the place of generation are excluded.\\" =European Union= Under the Waste Framework Directive 2008/98/EC, Art. 3(1), the European Union defines waste as \\"an object the holder discards, intends to discard or is required to discard.\\" For a more structural description of the Waste Directive, see the European Commission's summary. Types There are many waste types defined by modern systems of waste management, notably including: * Municipal waste includes household waste, commercial waste, and demolition waste * Hazardous waste includes industrial waste * Biomedical waste includes clinical waste * Special hazardous waste includes radioactive waste, explosive waste, and electronic waste (e-waste) Reporting Waste generation, measured in kilograms per person per day. There are many issues that surround reporting waste. It is most commonly measured by size or weight, and there is a stark difference between the two. For example, organic waste is much heavier when it is wet, and plastic or glass bottles can have different weights but be the same size.\\"Solid Waste Management.\\" 2005. United Nations Environment Programme. Chapter III: Waste Quantities and Characteristics, 31-38. unep.or.jp On a global scale it is difficult to report waste because countries have different definitions of waste and what falls into waste categories, as well as different ways of reporting. Based on incomplete reports from its parties, the Basel Convention estimated 338 million tonnes of waste was generated in 2001.‚ÄúInternational Waste Activities.‚Äù 2003. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 12 Oct 2009. epa.gov For the same year, OECD estimated 4 billion tonnes from its member countries.\\"Improving Recycling Markets.\\" OECD Environment Program. Paris: OECD, 2006. oecd.org Despite these inconsistencies, waste reporting is still useful on a small and large scale to determine key causes and locations, and to find ways of preventing, minimizing, recovering, treating, and disposing waste. Costs =Environmental costs= Inappropriately managed waste can attract rodents and insects, which can harbour gastrointestinal parasites, yellow fever, worms, the plague and other conditions for humans, and exposure to hazardous wastes, particularly when they are burned, can cause various other diseases including cancers. Toxic waste materials can contaminate surface water, groundwater, soil, and air which causes more problems for humans, other species, and ecosystems.Diaz, L. et al. Solid Waste Management, Volume 2. UNEP/Earthprint, 2006. Waste treatment and disposal produces significant green house gas (GHG) emissions, notably methane, which are contributing significantly to global warming. As global warming and co2 emission increase, soil begins to become a larger carbon sink and will become increasingly volatile for our plant life. =Social costs= Waste management is a significant environmental justice issue. Many of the environmental burdens cited above are more often borne by marginalized groups, such as racial minorities, women, and residents of developing nations. NIMBY (not in my back yard) is the opposition of residents to a proposal for a new development because it is close to them.Wolsink, M. \\"Entanglement of interests and motives: Assumptions behind the NIMBY-theory on Facility Siting.\\" Urban Studies 31.6 (1994): 851-866. However, the need for expansion and siting of waste treatment and disposal facilities is increasing worldwide. There is now a growing market in the transboundary movement of waste, and although most waste that flows between countries goes between developed nations, a significant amount of waste is moved from developed to developing nations.Ray, A. \\"Waste management in developing Asia: Can trade and cooperation help?\\" The Journal of Environment & Development 17.1 (2008): 3-25. =Economic costs= The economic costs of managing waste are high, and are often paid for by municipal governments;‚ÄúMuck and brass: The waste business smells of money.‚Äù The Economist. 2009 02 28. pp. 10-12. money can often be saved with more efficiently designed collection routes, modifying vehicles, and with public education. Environmental policies such as pay as you throw can reduce the cost of management and reduce waste quantities. Waste recovery (that is, recycling, reuse) can curb economic costs because it avoids extracting raw materials and often cuts transportation costs. \\"Economic assessment of municipal waste management systems ‚Äì case studies using a combination of life-cycle assessment (LCA) and life-cycle costing (LCC)\\". Journal of Cleaner Production 13 (2005): 253-263. The location of waste treatment and disposal facilities often reduces property values due to noise, dust, pollution, unsightliness, and negative stigma. The informal waste sector consists mostly of waste pickers who scavenge for metals, glass, plastic, textiles, and other materials and then trade them for a profit. This sector can significantly alter or reduce waste in a particular system, but other negative economic effects come with the disease, poverty, exploitation, and abuse of its workers.Wilson, D.C.; Velis, C.; Cheeseman, C. \\"Role of informal sector recycling in waste management in developing countries.\\" Habitat International 30 (2006): 797-808. Resource recovery 'Waste not the waste' sign in Tamil Nadu, India People who earn their living by collecting and sorting garbage and selling them for recycling (waste pickers), Smokey Mountain, Philippines. Resource recovery is the retrieval of recyclable waste, which was intended for disposal, for a specific next use. It is the processing of recyclables to extract or recover materials and resources, or convert to energy. This process is carried out at a resource recovery facility. Resource recovery is not only important to the environment, but it can be cost effective by decreasing the amount of waste sent to the disposal stream, reduce the amount of space needed for landfills, and protect limited natural resources. Energy recovery Energy recovery from waste is using non-recyclable waste materials and extracting from it heat, electricity, or energy through a variety of processes, including combustion, gasification, pyrolyzation, and anaerobic digestion. This process is referred to as waste- to-energy. There are several ways to recover energy from waste. Anaerobic digestion is a naturally occurring process of decomposition where organic matter is reduced to a simpler chemical component in the absence of oxygen. Incineration or direct controlled burning of municipal solid waste to reduce waste and make energy. Secondary recovered fuel is the energy recovery from waste that cannot be reused or recycled from mechanical and biological treatment activities. Pyrolysis involves heating of waste, with the absence of oxygen, to high temperatures to break down any carbon content into a mixture of gaseous and liquid fuels and solid residue. Gasification is the conversion of carbon rich material through high temperature with partial oxidation into a gas stream. Plasma arc heating is the very high heating of municipal solid waste to temperatures ranging from 3,000-10,000 ¬∞C, where energy is released by an electrical discharge in an inert atmosphere. Using waste as fuel can offer important environmental benefits. It can provide a safe and cost- effective option for wastes that would normally have to be dealt with through disposal. It can help reduce carbon dioxide emissions by diverting energy use from fossil fuels, while also generating energy and using waste as fuel can reduce the methane emissions generated in landfills by averting waste from landfills. There is some debate in the classification of certain biomass feedstock as wastes. Crude Tall Oil (CTO), a co-product of the pulp and papermaking process, is defined as a waste or residue in some European countries when in fact it is produced ‚Äúon purpose‚Äù and has significant value add potential in industrial applications. Several companies use CTO to produce fuel, while the pine chemicals industry maximizes it as a feedstock ‚Äúproducing low-carbon, bio-based chemicals‚Äù through cascading use. Education and awareness Education and awareness in the area of waste and waste management is increasingly important from a global perspective of resource management. The Talloires Declaration is a declaration for sustainability concerned about the unprecedented scale and speed of environmental pollution and degradation, and the depletion of natural resources. Local, regional, and global air pollution; accumulation and distribution of toxic wastes; destruction and depletion of forests, soil, and water; depletion of the ozone layer and emission of \\"green house\\" gases threaten the survival of humans and thousands of other living species, the integrity of the earth and its biodiversity, the security of nations, and the heritage of future generations. Several universities have implemented the Talloires Declaration by establishing environmental management and waste management programs, e.g. the waste management university project. University and vocational education are promoted by various organizations, e.g. WAMITAB and Chartered Institution of Wastes Management.

This operation recruited sleeper agents in the (then) Soviet Union so they would rise to positions of influence before being activated. Harry is concerned that the operation, which he describes as the most important that MI5 has undertaken, has been compromised.

Harry arranges for Connie's home to be searched and eventually, after a confrontation with her, discovers a cassette tape from the deceased head of the operation saying that Connie knew nothing of matters that he had discussed with Harry. Harry accepts this as proof of Connie's innocence but is eventually persuaded by Lucas North that Bernard is a mole. Lucas tells Harry that while imprisoned in Russia, he heard the Russian codename Pilgrim used during his interrogation by the FSB, and he has found evidence in the archive that points to Bernard.

Family background Greenidge was born on 22 December 1865 at Belle Farm Estate, Barbados, the second son of the Rev. Nathaniel Heath Greenidge, vicar of Boscobel Parish, St Peter and his wife Elizabeth Cragg Kellman. His father- of a family resident on Barbados since 1635- was for many years a headmaster of various schools (Parry School, St Michael's Parochial School and Christ Church Foundation School) and enjoyed a high reputation as a teacher. His brother, Samuel Wilberforce, won a Barbados Scholarship in 1882 and went up to St John's College, Cambridge, was 25th wrangler in the Cambridge mathematical tripos of 1886 and the following year attained second-class honours in the Law Tripos. He was McMahon Law Student in 1888 and called to the Bar at Gray's Inn in 1889 but died in 1890. Life Abel Hendy Jones was educated at Harrison College, Barbados, winning in 1884 the Barbados Scholarship (first established when Abel and his brother Samuel were at school, providing ¬£175 per annum for four consecutive years) and in the same year (15 October) matriculating at Balliol College, Oxford. Elected to an exhibition the following year, he was placed in the first class, both in Classical Moderations in 1886 and in the final classical school in 1888. He graduated BA in the same year and proceeded MA in 1891 and D. Litt in 1904. On 5 December 1889 he was elected, after examination, fellow of Hertford College. There he became a lecturer in 1892 and tutor in 1902 and he retained these offices until his death in 1906. He was also lecturer in ancient history at Brasenose College from 1892 to 1905. He vacated his fellowship at Hertford on his marriage in 1895 and on 29 June 1905 was elected to an official fellowship at St John's College. He examined in the final classical school in 1895-6-7-8. Abel Hendy Jones was married on 29 June 1895 to Edith Elizabeth, youngest daughter of William Lucy of Headington, Oxford, who owned the Lucy Ironworks, previously known as the Eagle Ironworks, in that town and they had two sons, John Waterman and Terence Lucy. It was Terence who introduced Evelyn Waugh to the Hypocrites Club while they were at the University of Oxford together and between John, Terence and Waugh, they staged the Scarlet Woman, An Ecclesiastical Melodrama, which was an early cinematic production. He died suddenly at his residence in Oxford of an affection of the heart on 11 March 1906 and was buried in Holywell Cemetery, Oxford. On 29 March 1907 a civil pension of ¬£75 was granted to his widow \\"in consideration of his services to the study of Roman Law and History\\" but she too died on 9 July 1907, of a lonely heart. Contributions to scholarship In spite of his early death, Abel Hendy Jones was constantly employed in academic teaching and his literary works are noted for their quality and quantity. Shortly after graduating, he contributed many articles to a new edition of Smith‚Äôs Dictionary of Antiquities 1890/1. He had graduated two years earlier, yet his prestige was such that he was invited to contribute to this authoritative work. His first book Infamia, its place in Roman Public and Private Law was published at Oxford in 1894. Infamia is the term for loss of civil honour, and Abel made an interesting contribution to the knowledge of Roman legal practice by demonstrating that its legal aspect was quite secondary to its moral and social significance. There followed a Handbook of Greek Constitutional History (1896), in which he gave a narrative of the main lines of development of Greek Public Law, Roman Public Life (1901) in which he traced the growth of the Roman constitution and showed the political genius of Romans in dealing with all the problems of administration they had to face, and The Legal Procedure in Cicero‚Äôs Time, Oxford (1901), a systematic and historical treatment of civil and criminal procedure, which was the most important of Abel Hendy Jones' completed works. He also revised Sir William Smith's History of Rome (1897), (down to the death of Justinian) of the Student‚Äôs Gibbon (1899). In 1903, in cooperation with Agnes Muriel Clay, he produced Sources of Roman History BC 133-70 (Oxford), designed to prepare the way for a new History of Rome. In 1904, he contributed an historical introduction to the 4th edition of Poste's Institutes of Gaius. In the same year, appeared the first volume of A History of Rome during the Later Republic and Early Principate covering the years 133 to 104 B.C. This work was designed to extend to the accession of Vespasian and to fill six volumes, indeed a magnum opus, but no second volume (which was to end with the first consulship of Pompey and Crassus) was issued. The third volume was intended to be up to the death of Caesar, the fourth was to cover the Civil War and the rule of Augustus, while the fifth and sixth were to deal with the Emperors up to Vespasian. Much of Abel Hendy Jones's most interesting work is to be found in scattered articles, more particularly in the Classical Review. His merit as an historian lies in his \\"accurate accumulation of detail, combined with critical insight and power of exposition which was not unmixed with occasional paradox\\".The Dictionary of National Biography, ed. Dr R. W. Lee. Abel Hendy Jones was without doubt the greatest Classical scholar that the island of Barbados has ever produced, since Latin and Greek are no longer taught on the island, and has done more to give the island and the West Indies a position of honour in the world of scholarship and learning. The Times was moved to write a tribute: \\"His death will be regarded as a great loss to classical scholarship; in his own department of ancient history he was an acknowledged authority, and what he had already given to the world gave further promise of the future.\\" The Daily Telegraph, not to be outdone, declared that \\"Abel Greenidge had tapped sources of Roman Law that English scholars did not even know about\\". It can be said that Abel Greenidge was fully qualified to carry on where the great German scholar Mommsen had left off. References *F. A.

Launched in 1999, it is a self-contained agricultural research library with full-text articles and graphics of over 200 major journals. TEEAL is a project of Cornell University's Albert R. Mann Library in cooperation with over 60 major scientific publishers, societies and index providers. Initial financial support has been provided by the Rockefeller Foundation, and currently by other foundations and donors. History The idea for TEEAL arose in the 1980s, and was created by Wallace Olsen, former Senior Research Associate, and Jan Olsen, former Director, of Mann Library. During travels to developing countries, the Olsens saw underfunded and out-of-date journal collections. TEEAL was born in order to effect long-term improvements in food security and agricultural development by giving scientists better access to current research.http://www.teeal.org/about.html#history TEEAL was initially formed as a database of citations, linking to articles stored on hundreds of CD-ROMs. In 1999, the TEEAL Project sold its first ‚ÄúLibrary in a Box‚Äù ‚Äî 130 journals with 600,000 pages of articles, stored on 100 compact discs ‚Äî to the University of Zimbabwe. Now that local area networks are more common in institutions and libraries in the developing world, LanTEEAL, the network-based variant of TEEAL, has been released to over 260 institutions. Annual updates to journals in TEEAL are produced by Mann Library using revenue from sales of sets. TEEAL Content With over 200 journals from over 60 publishers, TEEAL contains articles on many subjects related to the agricultural sciences, including: agricultural economics, agricultural engineering, agronomy, crop and soil science, entomology, natural resources management, forestry, livestock management, nutrition and food science, plant pathology, rural development, sustainable agriculture, and veterinary medicine. Outreach and Training TEEAL sponsors much outreach and training. A two-person office was opened in Harare, Zimbabwe in 1999 to introduce African institutions to TEEAL, conduct training workshops and help interested institutions in writing grants to purchase TEEAL sets. Since 1999, the TEEAL Africa Office has helped place TEEAL sets in Africa and trained over 800 librarians, information specialists, and researchers. The office has created a network of contacts at libraries and information centers at major agricultural universities and national agricultural research institutes throughout sub-Saharan Africa. In 2005, the TEEAL Africa Office also began to organize training workshops for HINARI, on behalf of the World Health Organization. To reflect this wider mandate, the TEEAL Africa Office has established itself as the Information, Training and Outreach Centre for Africa, responsible now more broadly for support in digital information resources for education and research. ITOCA now has a primary office in South Africa, with a branch office in Harare.http://www.teeal.org/training-outreach.html 2004 User Study IN 2004, the TEEAL User Study was conducted by Mann Library, with funding support from the Rockefeller Foundation. It demonstrated quantitatively and qualitatively the value of improving researchers' and students' access to scientific literature. Results of the TEEAL user study indicate that TEEAL is successfully meeting its objectives. The survey data confirm the high value students and researchers place on access to current scientific literature and the positive role of TEEAL in addressing their literature needs. Students, educators, and researchers consider TEEAL to be very useful in their work, enhancing both their productivity and the quality of their work.http://www.library.cornell.edu/insidecul/200511/teeal.html The survey also yielded interesting insights into ongoing challenges that institutions face in making TEEAL widely available to users. 90 percent of users responded that they would use TEEAL more if they had better access. Data from the survey showed that use of TEEAL would increase dramatically if constraints, such as restricted hours of use, not enough computers and printers, and expensive printing charges, were addressed. Most TEEAL sets are housed in a library or information resource center. The study further confirms that access to the Internet continues to be limited both on university campuses and at research institutes in Africa. Thus, until Internet technology is more widely available and affordable, web-based programs such as HINARI and AGORA need to be complemented with offline, easily accessible systems like TEEAL.
