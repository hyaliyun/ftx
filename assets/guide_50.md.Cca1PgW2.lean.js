It was released in Spain on 6 January 2017. The film opened to lukewarm critical response, but was a commercial success, grossing $30.5 million against its ‚Ç¨4 million budget. The Invisible Guest has spawned three remakes in different languages. Plot Spanish businessman Adri√°n Doria is out on bail after being arrested for the murder of his lover, Laura Vidal. His lawyer, F√©lix Leiva, hires prestigious defense attorney Virginia Goodman who visits him early one morning with the news that the prosecutor has found a witness who will be testifying in front of a judge soon, so he must tell the whole story quickly. Adri√°n tells Virginia how he and Laura ended their affair months ago but received a call blackmailing them to come to a rural hotel with ‚Ç¨100,000. At the hotel, Adri√°n was knocked unconscious and awoke to find Laura dead in the bathroom. The police arrive and, finding the room door locked and chained from the inside, break in. The windows are locked and the handles removed during the winter, leaving Adri√°n the only suspect. After his arrest, his wife leaves him and takes their young daughter. Virginia insists Adri√°n is not telling her the whole truth. Adri√°n then narrates further back, how he claimed to be in Paris but was really in a cabin with Laura. As they drive back to Barcelona through Sierra y Ca√±ones de Guara, Adri√°n tries to convince her to end their adulterous relationship. Distracted, Adri√°n swerves into the oncoming lane to avoid a deer, clipping another car, which hits a tree. Although they are unhurt, the driver of the other car, a bank employee named Daniel Garrido, 23, is killed. Laura rationalizes that it is not entirely their fault since Daniel was texting and not wearing his seat belt. When another car approaches, Laura pushes Daniel's body down across the passenger's seat, and she and Adri√°n pretend to exchange insurance information. She answers Daniel's phone when it rings to continue the ruse, and the other driver leaves, convinced. Laura waits for a towtruck in Adri√°n's car, which will not start, while Adri√°n dumps Daniel's car in a lake with his body in the trunk. Adrian remains around the place of the accident, while Laura departs with the towtruck towing Adrian's car. Later on, Laura, upset, returns to the place of the accident (where Adrian is still waiting) driving Adrian's car, and tells him how his car was repaired. An automotive engineer, Tom√°s, drove by and offered to help Laura, who claimed she hit a deer. He towed Adrian's car to his (Tom√°s') house to fix it. While talking to Tom√°s' wife, Elvira, Laura sees some photographs and realizes Daniel Garrido is their son. Laura, who still has Daniel's phone in her pocket, hides it in their couch as Elvira calls, looking for her son. As Laura leaves in Adri√°n's car, Tom√°s Garrido notices her adjusting her seat, proving that she was lying when she claimed she was driving. He notes the car's number plates as Laura leaves. After Adri√°n sells his car and reports it stolen, he parts ways with Laura, hopefully for good. Within a few days, Adri√°n is summoned to the police station, as Tom√°s has reported his plate number to the police. F√©lix arranges for a false alibi for Adri√°n in Paris, and bribes the police to remove Adri√°n's name from the Garrido case file. When the news report that Daniel is on the run after embezzling money from the bank, Adri√°n confronts Laura, who admits that she had taken Daniel's wallet when they put his body in the trunk; later on, using the information of Daniel, Laura, whose husband works for the same bank, hacked into Daniel‚Äôs account and stole money to create a fake trail. Adri√°n tells her that what she did is wrong, but Laura threatens to frame him too. Adri√°n is named European Businessman of the Year, and Tom√°s poses as a reporter during the ceremony to confront him. Tom√°s notices that Adri√°n pulls out the same cigarette lighter he saw when fixing the car. He begs Adri√°n to tell him where his son's body is to bury him as security removes Tom√°s. Days later, Adri√°n receives a photo of a lake with instructions to take Laura to the rural hotel with ‚Ç¨100,000. Adri√°n thinks the blackmailer may be the driver they saw after the accident, if he followed Adri√°n as he dumped the car into the lake. Back in the present, Virginia suggests that to save himself, Adri√°n could claim he saw the face of the man who hit him in the rural hotel room and that attacker was Tom√°s. She tells Adri√°n that there was no surprise witness (referring to the witness Virginia mentioned when she and Adrian just met each other), and she only told him that to force him to tell the truth of the whole story quickly. Adri√°n then reveals he had always known it was Tom√°s, as he did see his face, but was also testing Virginia. Virginia suggests planting an item of Laura's in the trunk of Daniel's car with Daniel's body, and claiming she acted alone. Adri√°n then confesses that as he was pushing the car into the lake, Daniel woke up, as he was only unconscious; an autopsy would reveal he drowned. Virginia is shocked but states she will not reveal this to the judge. Virginia says Laura's autopsy shows she was suffering from anxiety, likely from a guilty conscience, and suggests Adri√°n is lying to make it seem like Laura was the mastermind behind their deceit. However, Virginia says she believes Tom√°s framed him because Elvira (the wife of Tom√°s) works at the rural hotel where Laura's body was found, and that's why the Garridos chose that place: Elvira could have easily unlocked the window for her husband to escape after killing Laura, and later locked the window, making it seem like nobody else came in. Virginia says Tom√°s has been stalking him (Adri√°n), F√©lix and even herself, and points to an apartment across the street, where Tom√°s is lurking. She continues to push Adri√°n, who finally admits that he killed Laura and staged the scene. F√©lix phones and leaves a message on Adri√°n's home voicemail machine, urging him to call back as he was unable to reach him on his cellphone. Virginia suggests he return F√©lix's call as they take a quick 10-minute break. She exits the apartment and begins to quickly walk with great urgency. Adri√°n meanwhile turns on his cellphone and calls F√©lix: F√©lix again says to Adrian that he could not get a hold of him due to his cellphone being off, so he informs that the prosecution's witness is indeed the other driver, but his silence was successfully bought. As F√©lix questions how the meeting with Virginia is going, the call begins to go in and out with high pitched tones, Adri√°n then realizes the pen exploded and stained his shirt with ink due to a signal interruption caused by the cellphone call, revealing that the pen Virginia had given to him was bugged and their entire conversation with her had been recorded. He recalls Virginia turning off his phone previously, most probably so the cellphone signal would not disrupt the recording. He looks into the other apartment and sees Tom√°s standing next to Virginia, who reveals herself to be Elvira Garrido in disguise. Using the confession Elvira coerced from Adri√°n, Tom√°s calls the police as the real Virginia Goodman arrives at Adri√°n's apartment.

Built in 1855, it was deactivated sometime around World War II and was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. History This light was built to supplement the East Rigolets Light, which marked the other end of the passage and which was built by the Pleasonton administration in 1838. It was constructed in 1855 as part of a set of four lights which were erected around Lake Pontchartrain that year, all to the same design: a square house with an overhanging hipped roof, the lantern at the peak. The light was extinguished at the beginning of the Civil War, but as Union forces gained control of the area it was relit in November 1862, using a ship's lantern. Two days later the keeper, Thomas Harrison, was found shot to death. He was the only keeper killed on duty during the war. A year later the light was renovated and equipped with a fifth-order Fresnel lens. Storm damage was a constant issue, with major repairs coming in 1888 to erect a new breakwater and wharf, and after the hurricane of 1915, the house was put on a new foundation of concrete pilings which raised it by six feet. The light was deactivated around World War II (sources differ as to whether it went dark in 1939 or 1945) but survived for many years, supplanted by an automated post light and day marker located further offshore; it was sold to private interests but was left unmaintained.

Sheep by the river Pine trees  Life  Droste-Roggemann completed school in Bad Zwischenahn where she excelled in drawing. She lived with her parents and siblings in a house on Bahnhofstra√üe. The house was demolished many years ago and today there is an old people's home on the property where Drose-Roggemann's parents used to live. After finishing school, Droste- Roggemann decided to become an artist. She was able to finance her education and other trips from an inheritance. Around 1890, she left her parents' home and travelled to Weimar and Dresden. Both cities had art academies, whose teachers gave private painting and drawing lessons as an additional source of income. Since women were not yet admitted to art academies, private classes were the only available option for Droste-Roggemann. She probably lived in Dresden between 1890 and 1891, where she became acquainted with the Oldenburg painter Bernhard Winter, who went to the Kunstakademie Dresden in 1887 and studied painting there until 1891. Until 1900 Droste-Roggemann undertook many study trips, on which she created oil paintings and pencil sketches. She created many pencil sketches with location details of her excursions to the mountains in Scandinavian countries. Droste-Roggemann lived in Bad Zwischenahn from 1901, and became acquainted with the merchant Oskar Droste (1851‚Äì1941) from Bremen who had taken over a peat factory in the village. They married in 1902 and Louise took the surname Droste-Roggemann. In 1904 a daughter was born, their only child. Since her return to Bad Zwischenahn, the artist took every opportunity to paint from nature.

It was established in 1971 as a subsidiary of the Japanese firm Rohm. History The Japanese semiconductor company Rohm established Exar as a California-based American subsidiary in 1971. At that time, the integrated circuit boards designed and manufactured by Rohm were developed in the United States, and establishing an American subsidiary provided closer ties to the design process and provided a marketing foothold. In the early 1980s, when Exar was running sales figures of around annually, only about ‚Öì of sales were through its parent, Rohm. Part of the success of Exar and Rohm in the early 1980s stemmed from proprietary technologies developed between the two. As a result of pressure from the U.S. Government for Japan to reduce its involvement in American industry, in particular in the semiconductor industry, Rohm began slowly divesting itself of Exar. Following Exar's initial public offering in 1985, Rohm's share of ownership had dropped to under 70%. Exar's acquisition of Exel Microelectronics in the mid-1980s contributed heavily to a financial downturn in the company. Exar purchased Exel for its technology, but also for its chip fabrication facilities; however, unbeknownst to Exar at the time of purchase, those plants were not run-ready and required large amounts of capital investment, which ate into Exar profits through the end of the decade. In response to these problems, Rohm reversed its position on Exar by purchasing outstanding stock, leading to its again fully owning the company. Reacquisition by Rohm freed Exar to fully capitalize assets acquired from Exel and turn up the investment in research and development, leading again to profitability based in large part of new introductions in the EEPROM and ASIC product spaces. After Rohm had rescued the company and supported its return to profitability, it changed course and began divesting again, leading in 1990 to holding less than 50 percent of Exar. From its inception, Exar's top executive staff and board had been picked by Rohm, and consisted largely of Japanese expatriates. This changed in 1992 when Rohm removed Exar's chief executive officer, Nabuo Hatta, who had served in an executive post since at least 1985, when he was president of the company. Exar's board subsequently hired George Wells, a Scotsman educated at the University of Glasgow, as the company's new chief executive; Wells had previously held positions at General Electric and LSI Logic. Wells oversaw a reorganization and re-prioritization of product offerings and introduced a culture of quality, leading to major increases in sales and income. Armed with a large cash surplus, and following Rohm's final divestment of Exar assets in 1994, Wells went on an acquisition spree in 1994 and 1995 which led to the purchases of Origin Technology, Micro Power Systems, Startech Semiconductor and Silicon Microstructures; all in all, these purchases enriched the technologies available to Exar. Acquiring so many companies in such a short period had consequences for the company, and Exar lost its profitability by early 1995. On April 3, 2009, Exar Corporation closed the acquisition of hi/fn, inc., a transaction which included stock and about in cash. On March 22, 2013, Exar acquired the assets of Altior in Eatontown, New Jersey. On July 5, 2013, it acquired Stretch, Inc. On June 3, 2014, it acquired most of Integrated Memory Logic Limited. On March 29, 2017, MaxLinear Inc. announced it would buy Exar Corporation for about $661.6 million cash. The acquisition of Exar Corp for $687 million was completed in May 2017.

He was demolished by the emperor who took the suggestion from Zhang Cong and later came back into the capital by the help of Xia Yan, the successor of Zhang Cong. Xu Jie spent over 20 years in the Grand Secretariat and held the position of Chief Grand Secretary about 6 years. One of the most well-known political conflicts during his time was his opposition to the former Senior Grand Secretary, Yan Song. Xu Jie eventually took over the cabinet by the 42nd year Jia Jing Emperor was in reign. In the later period of his political life, Xu Jie tried to improve the efficiency of the Ming cabinet, and in doing so, he provided patronage to many politicians who would become influential in Ming politics.  Biography  = Early life = Xu Jie was born in Xuanping, Zhejiang in 1503(sixteenth year of Hongzhi), while his father was working there as the assistant county magistrate. Allegedly, when Xu was less than one year old, he fell into a well but lived on. While he was about five years old, he plummeted from a mountain, but his clothing snagged on a branch and saved him from death. As Xu Jie grew older, he started to study. Once he was reading books in a claim haunted house, locals found him finished his lessons without any accidents, which impressed Xu Jie's father Xu Fu. Followomg the resignation of Xu Fu, Xu Jie went back to his home town, Huating. He studied beside a small lake called \\"Shao Hu\\"(), which became his first pseudonym. When he grew up, he was described as a pale and handsome man of short stature.History of Ming,Vol.213 After his eighteenth birthday, Xu Jie gained his degree of Juren by ranked seventh in the provincial civil service examination held at Yingtian in the first year of Jiajing. In 1523, Xu became s jinshi, ranked third in imperial examination. He began to work at the Hanlin Academy. When the Chief Grand Secretary, Zhang Cong (), advised Jiajing Emperor to replace Confucius's posthumous title \\"Wenxuan King\\" () with \\"Extremely Sage Departed Teacher\\" () and reform the ceremony for worship, Xu Jie showed himself to be resolutely opposed to that despite being summoned and upbraided by Zhang. To make matters worse, his opposition was deemed to be offensive to the emperor. Then the latter launched a scathing attack on him. Later, Xu submitted a memorial that was probably inappropriate for such an issue: \\"Your Majesty, your own sagacious counsels overwhelmingly exceeded my discernment ().\\" The emperor said such an action was ingratiating, and ordered the erection of a \\"Monument of the Sycophant ()\\" to ridicule him.Â§©Â∫úÂª£Ë®ò, Vol. 9 What's more, Xu was exiled to Yanping, Fujian. After a period of filial mourning for his mother, he returned to Beijing and was appointed the Jijiu (Á•≠ÈÖí, [Libationer], the Principal of the Imperial University) of Guozijian . After that, he successively served as Vice Minister of Rites, Vice Minister of Personnel, and Minister of Rites, entering the Grand Secretariat in 1552. Xu won prestige among the lower officials, since he seldom appeared condescending to them. When Altan Khan attacked Beijing, he appealed to the emperor to stay in the Forbidden City and convoke a council of senior officials. The emperor agreed and asked him how to respond to Altan Khan's demands. Xu proposed drawing out the negotiations in order to buy time to muster reinforcements; when the reinforcements arrived, the enemy would flee. The emperor was full of praise for his idea. In his term, Xu transferred Gao Gong and Zhang Juzheng into the Grand Secretariat. Also, at one point Hai Rui criticized Jiajing Emperor on an inappropriate occasion, and was sentenced to death. Xu managed to dissuade the emperor and saved Hai Rui. After the death of the Jiajing Emperor, Xu drafted the testamentary edict of the emperor to say that all the imperial rituals, construction, jewellery and textiles that had been required before were no longer needed. Moreover, he declared that the punishments of the Great Rites Controversy should be reversed. = Political struggle with Yan Song = As Xu entered the Grand Secretariat, the heated political struggle between him and Yan Song began. The Jiajing Emperor privileged Xu, but nurtured the distaste at the outset. Yan stressed Xu was disloyal before the emperor, made Xu's position untenable. Xu salvaged the situation with his great talent in qingci (, green poetry; a special poetry for prayer in the Taoist ceremony written on a green paper), which delighted the emperor devout to Taoism. Xu was regarded as a schemer even in the official biography. Once Yan Song learned that Qiu Luan (), a frontier official friendly with Xu, was convicted of crimes, Yan had intended to implicate Xu in this case. However, astonished to find out the telltale was Xu himself, he had to drop the plan. The emperor wanted to renovate a palace where he used to live that was destroyed in a fire. He told Yan Song of his intention, but was dissatisfied over Yan Song's suggestion to move back into the Forbidden City. The emperor then turned to Xu, who assured the reconstruction would be finished within several months, supervised by himself. Xu was deemed to be the closest adviser to the emperor instead of Yan ever since. Fearing retaliation in the future, Yan Song hosted a banquet for Xu Jie where his family prostrated themselves before Xu while Yan himself toasted and begged Xu to care for his family if he died some day. Nonetheless, Xu Jie eventually plotted Yan Song's downfall, causing the Yan family to be exiled and Yan's son Yan Shifan to be executed.History of Ming, Vol.308 = Retired life = Xu retired and returned to his hometown in the summer of 1568. His prestige gave his family members and retainers the freedom to make trouble there without fear of retribution. The arable land they encroached measured up to 240,000 mu (equivalent of about 33600 acre or 136 km2), which had come to Hai Rui's notice. Hai's uncompromising enforcement enraged Xu. So he bribed a censor to impeach Hai.

He was the editor of the Journal of Social Philosophy for 16 years (1988-2005) and general editor of the seven volume Issues in Contemporary Ethics series in the 1970s. According to Zachary Goldberg, professor at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t M√ºnchen, French‚Äôs contributions to a wide spectrum of philosophical discussions made him an influential figure in the areas of moral responsibility and the agency of individuals and collectives.Zachary Goldberg editor, Reflections on Ethics and Responsibility: Essays in Honor of Peter A. French, Springer, 2017, xiii. French is best known for his work on collective and corporate responsibility, especially his theory that corporations should be treated as members of the moral community and held morally responsible for their actions.‚ÄúThe Corporation as a Moral Person‚Äù in American Philosophical Quarterly, July 1979. Reprinted in Ethical Issues in Business, ed. by Donaldson and Werhane, Prentice-Hall, 1983 and subsequent editions; Collective Responsibility, ed. by May and Hoffman, Rowman and Littlefield, 1992; and in numerous anthologies and in many languages. According to Professor Jeffrey Moriarty in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy French is ‚Äúa seminal thinker on corporate moral agency.‚Äù He is responsible for developing the argument that firms have internal decision- making structures through which they act intentionally.Jeffery Moriarty, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ‚ÄúBusiness Ethics,‚Äù First published Thu Nov 17, 2016, https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-business/#CorpMoraAgen In \\"The Corporation as a Moral Person\\" French coined the term Corporate Internal Decision Structures (CID Structures) and defined a CID Structure as an organization of personnel for the exercise of a corporation‚Äôs power with respect to its ventures and interests. According to French a CID Structure produces decision-making, ratification, and action processes thereby forming a corporation into a functioning intentional morally responsible entity. He identified two sorts of rules crucial to CID Structures: organizational rules and policy/procedure rules. Organizational rules define levels of authority. Policies and procedures are recognition rules for identifying a decision or an act as having been made or performed for corporate reasons.For an account of French‚Äôs position on corporate moral responsibility over various iterations and that of his critics see, ‚ÄúReflections on Corporate Moral Responsibility and the Problem Solving Technique of Alexander the Great‚Äù by John Hasnas, Journal of Business Ethics, May 2012, Volume 107, Issue 2, 183‚Äì195. French expanded, defended, and modified this theory in publications in subsequent years.Collective and Corporate Responsibility, Columbia University Press, 1984; Corporate Ethics, Harcourt, Brace, 1995; Responsibility Matters, University Press of Kansas, 1992; and a number of articles in philosophy and law journals. According to Michael Kerlin in the Journal of Business Ethics French‚Äôs work on corporate ethics is ‚Äúof intellectual sophistication with real world applications.‚ÄùMichael J. Kerlin, ‚ÄúPeter French, Corporate Ethics and The Wizard of Oz,‚Äù Journal of Business Ethics, 1997. When the United States Supreme Court issued its ruling in Citizens United v. FEC, some philosophers and legal theorists wrote to French claiming his work had laid the groundwork for the treatment of corporations as persons and asked if he was willing to change his position on corporations and write an opinion piece for the New York Times. French declined and responded in a paper published in the festschrift honoring him that the Court‚Äôs majority opinion does not represent his position on corporate moral personhood. French noted that Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in his concurring opinion that corporate speech is ‚Äúthe speech of many individual Americans who have associated in a common cause, giving the leadership of the corporation the right to speak on their behalf.‚ÄùCitizens United v. Federal Election Commission, 558 U. S. 310 (2010) 1, Scalia, J., concurring, No. 08‚Äì205. French argued that corporations do not speak for their employees, stockholders, or others affiliated with them. There is no necessary connection between what corporate speech expresses and the beliefs, desires, interests, plans, and goals of such individuals. Corporations speak qua corporate entities and the political speech of individuals is already protected.\\"Coda\\" of \\"Moral Belief/Behavior Discordance and Prizing\\" in Zachary Goldberg editor, Reflections on Ethics and Responsibility: Essays in Honor of Peter A. French, Springer, 2017, 240-242 French distinguished two distinct types of collectivities in his discussions of collective responsibility: aggregates and conglomerates. According to Marian Smiley, French defines an aggregate collectivity as merely a group of people to whom collective responsibility cannot be ascribed. A conglomerate collectivity for French is an organization of individuals whose identity is not exhausted by the conjunction of the identities of the persons in the organization. Conglomerate collectivities can be held collectively responsible.Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ‚ÄúCollective Responsibility,‚Äù First published August 8, 2005; substantive revision June 14, 2010 by Marion Smiley, https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/collective-responsibility/ On French's account, responsibility may be distributable or non-distributable over the membership of a collectivity depending on the type. French also coined the term ‚Äúthe responsibility barter game‚Äù to describe the common way people negotiate with each other to try to lessen or avoid personal responsibility for bad outcomes. According to Jane E. Jadlos writing in The Journal of Religion for French ‚Äúresponsibility is not a truth of some sort about the world, but a set of practices used to describe and understand individual and social behavior.‚ÄùJane E. Jadlos,\\"Responsibility Matters,\\" The Journal of Religion July 1994, Volume 74, Issue 3.

Biography  After his training Fezer was initially a curate in Leinfelden-Echterdingen, then head pastor in Stuttgart and T√ºbingen. From 1926 to 1959 he was the Professor for Practical Theology at the University of T√ºbingen. He was Chair of the Protestant Seminary there from 1931 to 1959 while simultaneously Rector of the University from 1933 to 1959. For a short time he was the head of the German Christians movement which sought to institute Nazi racial policies in the German Protestant Church. He petitioned for membership in the Nazi Party in May 1933. In 1933 he assumed leadership of the German Christian Student Union. He served as a delegate to the \\"Conference to Resolve the Question of the Church\\" in 1933. He served as the Interim Leader of the German Evangelical Church after the victory of the Nazi-led German Christians in Church elections across Germany. Despite his relationship with Nazism and cooperation with the Nazi-appointed Bishop Theopil Wurm, he sought to preserve the independence of his faculty and seminary from Nazi and German Christian encroachment. Fezer's talent for preaching was recognized early in his career. As chair of the seminary he was known as the \\"Man of the Word,\\" and he was renowned outside of his seminary and across W√ºrttemberg for his lectures and seminars. His own homiletical theology was influenced by the theology of Adolf Schlatter. Because of his commitment to Nazism and membership in the German Christians movement, Fezer's work lost all credibility after the war.  Published works  * Das Wort Gottes und die Predigt.

It is the fourth installment in the SteamWorld series of games and the direct sequel to 2013's SteamWorld Dig. It was released on 21 September 2017 for Nintendo Switch in the Nintendo eShop, on Steam for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux, on the PlayStation Store for PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita, on the Nintendo eShop for Nintendo 3DS, and Stadia. Publisher Rising Star Games released physical retail copies of the game for the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 in 2018. Gameplay Carrying on from its predecessor, SteamWorld Dig, SteamWorld Dig 2 puts players in control of Dorothy, a steam-driven robot searching for Rusty, the protagonist of the previous game who disappeared. Gameplay largely involves exploring a vast underground mine, coming up against enemy creatures while finding various resources as the player digs their way downwards. As the game progresses, Dorothy can gain abilities and weapons such as pressure bombs, a hookshot, and a pneumatic arm that can punch through rock. Any resources found can be traded in for cash in the game's hub world, where the player can upgrade their health, weapons, and abilities. Each of the weapons have perks that can be activated by installing Upgrade Cogs found in secret areas. More blueprints for upgrades become available to the player by either increasing their level by killing enemies or completing quests, or by finding artifacts hidden in the mines. Plot The story takes place in between the events of SteamWorld Dig and SteamWorld Heist.https://www.destructoid.com/steamworld-dig-2-will-take- place-between-the-first-game-and-steamworld-heist-457454.phtml Following Rusty's disappearance at the end of SteamWorld Dig, Dorothy, a robot who he had befriended, travels to the mining town of El Machino in order to search for him. Along the way, she comes across Fen, a remnant of the Vectron that Rusty had previously fought, who joins Dorothy as a navigator. While searching the mines for Rusty while also hearing rumors of him turning into a monstrous machine, Dorothy comes across a group of humans led by Rosie, who claims that mysterious machines are triggering earthquakes. Dorothy goes to destroy these machines, only to discover that Rosie had lied to her. In actuality, the machines were built by Rusty to prevent Rosie from harnessing a powerful energy source to get rid of all robots. Dorothy manages to defeat Rosie and rescue Rusty, only for the energy source to become unstable, prompting Fen to stay behind while she warps the two to safety, allowing them to escape on a rocket with the other El Machino residents before the planet explodes. As the robots explore space in order to set up a new civilization, Dorothy remains hopeful that she will one day be reunited with Fen. Reception The game released to positive reviews, with a score of 88 out of 100 on Metacritic. Critics praised its improvements upon the original, as well as its world and gameplay. The game was nominated for \\"Best Portable Game\\" in Destructoid Game of the Year Awards 2017, for \\"Best Switch Game\\" and \\"Best Action-Adventure Game\\" in IGN's Best of 2017 Awards, for \\"Game Engineering\\" at the 17th Annual National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers Awards, and for \\"Best Indie Game\\" at the 2018 Golden Joystick Awards.

Frontpage of the libretto of the opera L'amore soldato composed by Felici in 1769 as conserved in the International Museum and Music Library in Bologna Life Alessandro Felici‚Äôs father was Bartolomeo Felici, Kapellmeister of the Florentine church of San Marco. Bartolomeo taught his son how to play the organ and music composition, while contemporarily, Felici studied with violinist Giuseppe Castrucci.Cristina Ciccaglione Badii, Felici.

XVIII, in Dizionario biografico degli italiani, vol. 46, Roma, Istituto dell'Enciclopedia Italiana, 1996, available on-line at Treccani.it (Italian site). When he was 14 years old, he was already well known in Florence for his virtuosity on the harpsichord and organ.Mario Fabbri, La giovinezza di Luigi Cherubini nella vita musicale fiorentina del suo tempo, in Luigi Cherubini nel II centenario della nascita. Contributo alla conoscenza della vita e dell'opera, Firenze, Olschki, 1962, pp. 16-19. He showed interest in composing for the theater, and in 1765 his father sent him to Naples, the Italian city known for its bustling opera scene. In Naples, he studied dramatic theater with Gennaro Manna. Felici returned to Florence in 1767 and began composing his own operas, distinguished as being much more cuttingly expressive than the works of his contemporaries (anticipating the romantic period),Robert Lamar Weaver, Felici, Alessandro, in The New Grove of Music and Musicians. Second Edition, ed. Stanley Sadie, executive editor John Tyrrell, vol. 8: Egypt to Flor, London, Macmillan, 2001-2002, pp. 654-655. which guaranteed his immediate and notable success. We know of more than ten theatrical works,Marcello De Angelis (editor), Melodramma, spettacolo e musica nella Firenze dei Lorena, Firenze, Giunta Regionale Toscana/Milano, Bibliografica, 1991, documents 119, 154, 170, 178, 180, 197, 208, 224, 427. not only performed in Florence but also in Rome, Venice, Turin, Milan, and even as far as Madrid and Leipzig. In 1769, his opera entitled Apollo in Tessaglia inaugurated the concerts of the Ingegnosi Academy. He was also very engaged in composing sacred and instrumental music, of which the keyboard pieces stand out: they shaped the modern conception of the concert as well as sonate composed in the same time in London and Vienna: his works for harpsichord, as observed by Fausto Torrefranca, anticipate some themes of Mozart and Clementi.Torrefranca obtained a manuscript, probably autographed, with the six sonatas for harpsichord by Felici, today conserved at the Venice Conservatory, on which he annotated many impressions in pencil. In the margins of Sonata V, Torrefranca wrote: ¬´What does it remind me of? Maybe Mozart?¬ª. Cfr.

Felici‚Äôs career was unexpectedly interrupted by tuberculosis, which was the cause of his death at the young age of twenty-nine. His only critic was marquis Eug√®ne de Ligniville, who wrote in a letter to Giovanni Battista Martini that his hunting dog knew more about counterpoint than Felici.Duccio Pieri, Il marchese Eugenio de Ligniville.

The Musical Documentation Center of Tuscany (Centro Documentazione Musicale della Toscana [it]) discovered works by Felici in the Venturi Music Collection in Montecatini Terme.Hiroko Kishimoto (ed.), Il Fondo musicale Venturi nella Biblioteca comunale di Montecatini Terme: catalogo, Firenze, Giunta Regionale Toscana/Milano, Editrice Bibliografica, 1989. The librettos of his operas are mostly conserved at the Conservatory in Florence, in the Florentine Marucelliana Library, in the International Museum and Music Library in Bologna, in the Giorgio Cini Foundation in Venice and in the Staatsbibliothek in Berlin. Recordings In 1969 classical band Solisti Romani (Massimo Coen, Mario Baruffa, Luigi Lanzillotta), with Paola Bernardi playing the harpsichord, recorded the Concerto in F major for harpsichord by Felici in the Auditorium of the Discoteca di Stato in Rome. After being published in various forms (LP, CD), the recording was digitalized by the Italian Central Institute of Audio and Audiovisual Property on its own website.

It can aid in understanding why a policy was implemented, the policy's effects, and how the policy could apply to the policymakers' jurisdiction. Before a policy is adopted it goes through a process that involves various combinations of elected official(s), political parties, civil servants, advocacy groups, policy experts or consultants, corporations, think tanks, and multiple levels of government. Policy can be challenged in various ways, including questioning its legality. Ideally policymakers develop complete knowledge about the policy; the policy should achieve its intent and efficiently use resources. Policy learning through globalization has helped government organizations become more competitive. Policymakers have easy access to global policy knowledge through the internet, access to think tanks, international institutions such as the United Nations, International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the World Bank and individual experts.  How policymakers learn  In the 1960s academics started to study how policymakers learn about policies. During that time countries were experiencing social, political, economic and technological change. Researchers discovered that governments in different countries faced similar problems in policies and programs amidst uncertainty on how to handle problems in financing its welfare programs. Policymakers start to learn about policy through facts, first-hand experiences or from the experiences of others. Policy instruments and policy implementation are the steps to policy learning. Policymakers review policy objectives, tools and implementation strategies. When implementations fail, reviews look for the cause(s). Adjustments in objectives, tools and implementation are considered.  Instrumental policy learning  Instrumental policy learning is the acquisition of knowledge about the effectiveness of various policy instruments and implementations. Policymakers must make choices about the appropriate policy intervention tool(s) to use. The intent is to discover the most effective tool(s) that consume the least resources. Policymakers can employ seven major policy instrument types. * Direct provision‚Äìservices that governments provide directly, such as publicly operated schools * Subsidies‚Äìcash infusions given by government to reduce the cost for the producer or consumer such as dairy farmers who receive subsidies to keep consumer costs low. * Taxation‚Äìcollection of money from individuals and/or businesses, such as a value-added tax. * Contract‚Äìan agreement between a government and a private entity to provide goods or services. * Authority‚Äìgovernment action implementing legislation with accompanying enforcement. * Regulation‚Äìgovernment action driven by administrative action rather than legislation, governing domains such as the environment and public health. (Some private groups regulate themselves independent of the government.) * Exhortation‚Äìencouragement without coercion, such as campaigns against littering or encouraging fire prevention. After choosing a policy instrument, the details for employing the instrument must be arranged. Implementation carries risks of failing in various ways, such as ineffectiveness, unacceptable delays and excessive costs. Practices that improve success rates include setting reasonable expectations, allowing adequate time and sufficient resources, having clear communication and understanding policy objectives, minimizing the number of approvals, simplifying management structures and aligning all relevant groups around the implementation, along with mechanisms to adapt the implementation in accord with subsequent experience to correct problems and take advantage of new opportunities. = Top-down approach = The top-down approach involves allowing high-level policymakers set objectives and define implementation strategies. Lower level implementers carry out the policy. Objectives must be clearly defined and the implementation tools must be selected based on the implementation strategy. Policy designers need to assess the commitment of policy implementers who could be teachers, police officers, social workers or private sector workers. One example of the top-down approach was in 1973 when the US Congress passed a policy limiting the driving speed to 55 mph on America‚Äôs freeways under the National Maximum Speed Law. The policy objective was to reduce gasoline consumption. In addition to increased travel times, a side effect was the reduction of freeway fatalities. = Bottom-up approach = The bottom-up approach helps policymakers to evaluate whether policy goals are open to more than one interpretation. Does the policy implement a statute, or reflect rules, practices and/or norms such as energy policy or criminal procedure? Are the policy goals internally consistent? How will the policy affect the activities of workers who directly provide services? Bottom-up approaches require policymakers to involve both service providers and service recipients in refining goals, strategies and activities. This bottom-up approach starts from consumer-facing bureaucrats and moves up to the top policymakers. Should the policy face pushback, policymakers must be open to negotiations for a compromise approach. The bottom-up approach emphasizes low level policy implementers, but policy learners must not attempt to frustrate the goals of top policymakers. In America, the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) adopted policyies that would have benefited from bottom-up perspectives. When NCLB was passed, many states struggled to figure out what was required. All states had to get their education plans approved by U.S. Department of Education. Once the education plan was approved, each state had to incorporate NCLB into the state's framework of educational governance and to use the legislation to achieve the state's own goals. If the U.S. federal government had consulted with each state about its education policies, performances, and future goals, teachers and the government would have had a better understanding on what policy objectives were achievable.  Challenges  Policy learning has not been embraced in some countries. Some countries that were once colonized fear that embracing policies recommended by outsiders will allow other countries to exploit their resources. Rockefeller (1966) claimed that in Latin America in the early 1960s free-market policies were in competition with communist propaganda in Latin American countries. At the time American business were claimed to be exploiting the people and their resources. However, companies such as Chase Manhattan Bank launched a program in Panama to improve cattle raising by training ranchersr to follow the scientific advances of seeding, feeding and breeding cattle more effectively. This process improved the quality of beef, which encouraged higher meat consumption, improved dietary standards and made Panama a beef exporter. European countries created the Euro to simplify trading between European Union countries. Adopting the Euro would remove currency risk and the cost of currency conversion, and provide a common monetary policy among members. Policy learning took places as more European countries learned that joining the Eurozone would give them access to other markets. Citizens of EU member countries could travel to other EU countries within the Schengen area without transiting a border checkpoint. The learning did not reach all policy sectors. Some EU countries kept their budgets in near balance amid strong growth and employment, while others' budgets were so far out of balance that their overall debt created fears about their ability to make their payments.

(April 21, 2015) \\"Air quality map shows Toronto's most polluted neighbourhoods.\\" The Star. As a result of the city's large population, substantial waste is produced annually. Polluted air can be found throughout the city with noticeable hot spots including the Scarborough Town Centre, Highway 427 intersecting Highway 401, and the downtown area. This leaves inhabitants of these areas at greater risk of the development of respiratory issues and other health conditions.Perrotta, K. (1999). \\"Environmental Health Issues in The City of Toronto\\". Toronto Public Health. 5-27. Water pollution from the city impacts the nearby environment as well. Sewage and harmful emissions have led to the presence of contaminants such as mercury, lead, and flame retardants within the waters of Lake Ontario.Melymuk, L.; Robson, M.; Csiszar, S.A.; Helm, P.A.; Kaltenecker, G.; Backus, S.; Bradley, L.; Gilbert, B.; Blanchard, P.; Jantunen, L.; and Diamond, ML. (2014) \\"From the city to the lake: loadings of PCBs, PBDes, PAHs, and PCMs from Toronto to Lake Ontario.\\" Environmental Science and Technology (48)7: 3732-41 There is evidence that harmful emissions from the city have lessened over the years as a result of local and Ontario based initiatives.Chubb, C. (August 17, 2015). \\"Breathe easier: Smog-free days the norm as city's air quality improves.\\" City News. In 2014, the city of Toronto celebrated a year without a smog alert for the first time in 20 years. Improvements to air quality have been linked to the closure of coal-fired power plants and the reduced demand for electricity in the city. Initiatives such as the Toronto Environmental Alliance and Greening Greater Toronto continue to address environmental issues in the city. Air pollution It is estimated by Toronto Public Health that air pollution in Toronto from all sources currently causes 1,300 premature deaths and 3,550 hospitalizations within the city annually.Gower, Stephanie; Macfarlane, R.; Belmont, M.; Bassil, K.; Campbell, M. (April 2014) \\"Path to Healthier Air: Toronto Air Pollution Burden of Illness Update. Technical Report\\". Toronto Public Health. Over half of Toronto's air pollution is emitted within the city's boundaries with the largest local source being traffic including all types of on-road vehicles. The second largest source of emissions affecting local air quality is fuels used to heat and cool homes and businesses.\\"Local Air Quality Studies\\". City of Toronto Reports, Policies, Plans and Research, retrieved on March 28th 2017. Research carried out at the University of Toronto has shown noticeable air pollution hot spots near highways and major intersections that can have three to four times the city‚Äôs average amount of ultrafine particles from by vehicle exhausts. One of the main emissions from vehicles is NOx (nitrogen oxide) which transforms in the air to NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), which is one of the most common pollutants consistently linked to health impacts. High concentrations of NOx occur along Toronto's major highways including Highway 427, Highway 401, Highway 400, the Don Valley Parkway, and the Gardiner Expressway, as well as the downtown area. These gases contribute to the formation of smog, ozone, and acid rain. =Smog= Smog alerts are issued by Toronto Public Health when air conditions in the city are poor enough to be harmful to a resident's health. The alerts are given in order to encourage residents to take precautions in order to protect their health, usually by limiting the amount of time spent outdoors in locations of heavy smog.\\"Air Pollution and Health\\". City of Toronto Air Pollution and Health. Retrieved on March 28th 2017. A study led by the University of Toronto found remarkable improvements in regional air pollution in the city since 2000.Allen, Kate. (August 21, 2014) \\"Toronto is smog free for the first summer in decades. But why?\\" The Star. For comparison, there were 53 smog days in 2005, and in 2014 and 2015 there were no recorded smog days.Artuso, A. (August 21, 2016) \\"The heat's been on - but the smog has not.\\" Toronto Sun. Concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides, two precursor components of smog, have been steadily decreasing in the city. A 2006-2016 analysis has shown that common air pollutant concentrations have dropped, and a 31% decrease in fine particulate matter and a 42% decrease in nitrogen dioxide has been noted. However, ozone, another smog component, continues to persist at levels that violate Canada-wide standards. Improvements to smog and air pollution as a result of lessened emissions have been noticed throughout the city. Experts from the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change have linked these lessened emissions to the closure of coal- fired generating stations, the lessened demand for electricity throughout the city, and initiatives such as Drive Clean. The weather plays an important role in the formation of smog as well. Hot summers contribute to the increased use of electricity throughout the city, and to the warm and dry atmosphere. Despite lessened emissions in the city, smog remains a possibility as warm temperatures allow for pollutants to react in the atmosphere more quickly. This leads to the possibility of high ozone levels despite the drop in pollutants which commonly lead to the production of ozone. In the hot, dry summer of 2012, some of the highest summertime ozone concentrations were recorded within the city. With these ozone concentrations came eight smog advisories despite the consistently lower ozone levels witnessed in the years leading up to 2012. =Air toxics= Air toxics, also known as toxic air pollutants, are pollutants in which long term exposure may cause serious health effects such as cancer, reproductive effects, birth defects, or other harmful environment and ecological effects. In Toronto, the overall burden of illness from air toxics is unknown; however, local data suggests that traces of benzene, tetrachloroethylene, and lead are present in Toronto‚Äôs air, posing a health risk in areas of high concentration.Gower, Stephanie; Macfarlane, Ronald. (March 2014) \\"Health Assessment for the Cumulative Air Quality Modelling Study - Wards 5 and 6 including the South Etobicoke and Lakeshore Neighbourhoods.\\" Toronto Public Health. Regulations are currently in place to reduce harmful emissions from air toxics. Under the city of Toronto's Environmental Reporting and Disclosure Bylaw of 2011, the use of tetrachloroethylene, also known as perchloroethylene or PERC, is now heavily tracked, requiring owners of dry-cleaning facilities to record detailed accounts of how it is used and recycled.\\"Environmental Reporting and Disclosure Bylaw (Municipal Code Chapter 423) Guide to Reporting\\". (January 2013) Toronto Public Health, City of Toronto. This is significant as PERC has been commonly used at dry cleaning facilities, and many owners have violated regulations in the past when using this toxic chemical.Blatchford, Andy. (February 2011) \\"Toxic dry-cleaning chemical is Canada's top eco-villain.\\" The Globe and Mail. According to Toronto's Medical Officer of Health, PERC ranks among the top eight chemicals of highest concern in the city.Marshall, Heather. (May 2015) \\"Spotlight on PERC.\\" Toronto Environmental Alliance. =Pollution from industrial sources= Industrial sources are a major contributor to the release of pollutants within Toronto. Sewage incinerators and other treatment plants across the city are often a large source of harmful pollutants such as nitrogen oxide, chromium mercury, and carbon dioxide (CO2).Marshall, Heather. (January 2016) \\"Air Pollution from Burning Sewage.\\" Toronto Environmental Alliance.\\"Health Impact Assessment of Biosolids Management Plan for Highland Creek Treatment Plant.\\" (October 2015) Medical Officer of Health, City of Toronto.

Retrieved on May 28th, 2017. The plant is one of Toronto's largest polluters, emitting over 38 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) every day as a result of its old incinerator.\\"Sewage incineration at Highland Creek Treatment Plant.\\" Toronto Environmental Alliance. Retrieved on March 28th, 2017. The city is currently debating options on how to best upgrade the facility. Possibilities include the continued burning of biomass on site by upgrading the nearly 40-year-old incinerator, or transporting the biomass off site to be stored elsewhere.Hasham, Alyshah. (March 2013) \\"Landfill or incinerator: What's the future of Toronto's trash?\\" The Star. Local businesses also contribute heavily to the amount of pollutants produced from industrial sources. The National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI) investigates and reports upon the release of pollutants across Canada. The NPRI currently does not track small and medium-sized facilities such as dry cleaners, auto repair shops, and printing companies, which represent the majority of facilities in Toronto. This has caused Toronto Public Health to conclude that harmful illnesses attributed to industrial processes in the city are underestimated. To address this, Toronto Public Health has led the development of an Environmental Reporting and Disclosure Bylaw that requires local businesses to track and report on the manufacture, process, use and release of 25 priority substances. As part of the bylaw, the program ChemTRAC was created, which helps businesses identify major sources of chemicals in their facilities and analyses their releases. ChemTRAC is now fully operational and is intended to reduce pollution from industrial and commercial sources by increasing public awareness.\\"ChemTRAC\\". City of Toronto Environmental Health.

Retrieved on March 28th, 2017.\\"Water Pollution in Toronto.\\" Toronto Environmental Alliance. Retrieved on March 28th, 2017. Many Toronto businesses and institutions dispose of harsh cleaning chemicals, degreasers, and heavy metals through the sewer system. Toronto Water can remove some of these contaminants when the wastewater is treated at one of their treatment plants; however, many toxic chemicals remain and are often released into Lake Ontario. In 2011, over 7 tonnes of cadmium, mercury, lead, and nickel were released into Lake Ontario from Toronto facilities. A study conducted in 2009 and published in 2014 by the University of Toronto and Environment Canada sampled Toronto's tributaries and treated wastewater for PCBs, flame retardants (including polybrominated diphenyl ethers or PBDEs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polycyclic musks (PCMs). The study found that Toronto sends an estimated 5,000 pounds of PAHs, 1,500 pounds of PCMs, 55 pounds of PCBs, and 40 pounds of PBDEs annually to the nearshore of Lake Ontario, approximately 25 miles out into the lake.Bienkowski, Brian.

Initiatives and environmental groups Many environmental groups in Toronto have been working towards addressing the multitude of environmental issues in Toronto. The Toronto Environmental Alliance (TEA) has been campaigning locally since 1988 to address urban environmental issues. TEA engages with City Councillors and has influenced policy shift towards environmentally sustainable programs.

He serves as deputy assistant secretary of defense for counternarcotics and global threats, and he previously served as the national security adviser to the United States Attorney General and as a former Senior Director for Intelligence Programs for the United States National Security Council (NSC). Early life and career Cohen-Watnick gained a Bachelor of Arts degree in History and Political Science from the University of Pennsylvania in 2008 and then reportedly worked for the Office of Naval Intelligence after graduation. Before joining the White House, Cohen-Watnick worked for the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), beginning in 2010, where he served in Miami, Haiti, Virginia and Afghanistan. Cohen-Watnick was accepted into the training program for the Defense Clandestine Service. Cohen-Watnick underwent training at Camp Peary (commonly known as \\"The Farm\\"), where he was trained by the Central Intelligence Agency. He was assigned to Afghanistan, with a GS-13 rank. He was temporarily assigned to the Defense Intelligence Agency Headquarters in 2014. Cohen-Watnick left the DIA for the NSC on 20 January 2017. Tenure on the National Security Council Cohen-Watnick was brought into the United States National Security Council by Michael T. Flynn, the former Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency and President Donald Trump's first National Security Advisor. He was named the NSC's Senior Director for Intelligence Programs. This directorship was intermittently held by detailed CIA officers. Like Cohen-Watnick, the immediate preceding Senior Director from the Obama Administration was a political appointee. Some viewed Cohen-Watnick's appointment as a sign of Trump's mistrust of the CIA. Following Flynn's resignation in February 2017, the new National Security Advisor, H. R. McMaster, attempted to remove Cohen-Watnick, but he was overruled by Trump. McMaster attempted to replace Cohen-Watnick with CIA official Linda Weissgold, the author of the infamous Benghazi talking points and member of the \\"Benghazi dream team\\", a group of intelligence community analysts assembled to counter the Congressional investigation into the Benghazi Affair. It is alleged that Cohen-Watnick inadvertently identified reports suggesting that members of Trump's campaign team had been subjected to incidental surveillance by the United States intelligence community, as part of an unrelated review of privacy procedures. This information was passed on to Chairman of the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence Devin Nunes by Assistant White House Counsel Michael Ellis. In April 2017 the Associated Press quoted a U.S. official as saying that although Cohen-Watnick had access to those kinds of intelligence materials, he did not play a role in helping Nunes gain access to the documents. According to a U.S. official, Cohen- Watnick was not involved in showing the material to Nunes, did not clear Nunes onto the White House grounds, did not review the material with Nunes, and was not even aware that the material was going to be shared with Chairman Nunes. It has been reported that Cohen-Watnick has advocated using the American intelligence community to overthrow the current Iranian government. The White House announced Cohen-Watnick's dismissal on August 2, 2017, following policy disagreements with National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster over Afghanistan, Iran, and Intelligence Oversight. According to The Washington Post, Cohen- Watnick resigned following a power shift under McMaster. Upon Cohen-Watnick's departure, the White House commented that \\"General McMaster appreciates the good work accomplished in the NSC's Intelligence directorate under Ezra Cohen's leadership... General McMaster is confident that Ezra will make many further significant contributions to national security in another position in the administration.\\" In late September 2017, Cohen-Watnick was reportedly succeeded by Michael Barry. = Support for Counterintelligence Initiatives = In May 2017, Cohen-Watnick and the FBI Assistant Director for Counterintelligence reportedly advocated for strong law enforcement actions against Chinese government officials conducting operations targeting Chinese dissidents and asylum seekers inside the United States, against objections from Acting Assistant Secretary of State Susan Thornton. Cohen-Watnick reportedly charged Thornton with \\"improperly hindering law-enforcement efforts to address China‚Äôs repeated violations of U.S. sovereignty and law.\\" On December 25, 2017, The Washington Post reported that in the weeks before Trump‚Äôs inauguration, Brett Holmgren, Cohen-Watnick's predecessor in the Obama White House, briefed Cohen-Watnick on the actions the Obama Administration had taken to counter Russian active measures. Once in the job, Cohen-Watnick sent out memos identifying counterintelligence threats, including Russia‚Äôs, as his top priority, officials said. He convened regular meetings in the White House Situation Room at which he pressed counterintelligence officials in other government agencies, including the CIA, to finalize plans for Russia, including those left behind by the Obama team, according to officials in attendance. By spring, national security adviser H. R. McMaster, senior White House Russia adviser Fiona Hill and Cohen-Watnick began advocating measures to counter Russian disinformation using covert influence and cyber-operations, according to officials.  Justice Department  In April 2018, he rejoined the Trump administration in the Department of Justice, advising Attorney General Sessions on counterterrorism and counterintelligence. Defense Department In May 2020, Cohen-Watnick was appointed as deputy assistant secretary of defense for counternarcotics and global threats. By September 2020, he was Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations/Low Intensity Conflict. Personal life Cohen-Watnick is a member of the Union League of Philadelphia, a Republican-leaning Patriotic Society. He married Rebecca Miller in November 2016.

Consumers can determine the shelf life for a drug by checking its pharmaceutical packaging for an expiration date. Drugs which are past their shelf life can decompose and either be ineffective or even harmful. Standard advice from drug manufacturers and some health organizations is to dispose of drugs after the expiration date printed on the packaging. However, the published expiration date is not an absolute indication that a drug has spoiled. Consumers and organizations sometimes use expired drugs for medical treatment either as a cost saving measure or because they otherwise cannot access drugs which are not expired. Medical authorities find it difficult to discuss when consumers can safely use drugs after the printed expiration date because it is difficult to obtain clear information. Labeled expiration date versus true expiration Manufacturers print expiration dates on drug bottle labels. The labeled expiration date is a manufacturer's promise for a time until which the drug will have full efficacy and be safe as manufactured. The labeled expiration date is not an indication of when a drug has become ineffective or unsafe to use. Many drugs are effective for years after their expiration dates. However, it is difficult for anyone including researchers and physicians to find information to verify how much any given drug will degrade in efficacy or become unsafe over time. Drug manufacturers never support the use of drugs after the expiration date because that could make them liable if something went wrong. The expiration date printed on drug packaging will differ from the true expiration date of the drug. Before the true expiration of a drug, its active ingredient will retain its potency. Also before expiration, no components of the drug will degrade to become harmful. Since products continually change over time, the characteristics of any drug are not unchanging but instead estimated with assay measurements to be within the specification required by the government regulator where the drug is sold. As a general estimate, a drug becomes unfit for use when 10% of the active ingredient is degraded. Before choosing an expiration date to print the manufacturer must first decide a true expiration date. After a manufacturer has decided what true expiration date it has set, then it will decide another date to make public and advertise on the packaging of the drug. The printed expiration date will always be sooner than the true expiration date, because the drug should always be effective and safe before the labeled expiration date if kept properly. Options for expired drugs =Disposal= The United States' Center for Drug Evaluation and Research officially recommends that drugs past their expiration date be disposed. It has been argued that this practice is wasteful, since consumers and medical facilities are encouraged to purchase fresh medication to replace their expired products, also resulting in additional profits for pharmaceutical firms. =Consumer use as normal= Some consumers can face the difficult position of being unable to afford their medication, and choosing between using expired medication or forgoing medication. An epipen is an example of an expensive medication which someone might consider using after expiration because of inability to purchase newer medication. Some common drugs which authorities say are always unsafe if expired include nitroglycerin, insulin, and liquid antibiotics. Consumers sometimes store drugs which they ought not use, regardless of being expired. People who have leftover antibiotics might feel that they can use them safely if they are not expired, or even if they are expired. Medical authorities recommend that no one use prescription drugs except under a physician's care. Authorities also encourage care in storing over-the-counter drugs, discarding them on a regular schedule, and using them as directed when appropriate. =Drug recycling= Drug recycling is a fringe and experimental concept but in some places it happens. Sometimes, an individual or organization will have valuable medicine which they do not intend to use. If that medication could be used by other people before its expiration, then sometimes, interested parties discuss drug recycling to transfer ownership of the drugs away from the party which will not use them to the party which needs them. In such discussions, anyone considering the transfer of drugs will also consider if drugs could be used before their expiration. Shelf Life Extension Program To reduce the cost to the military of maintaining stockpiles of certain pharmaceuticals, the United States Department of Defense and the Food and Drug Administration operate a joint initiative known as the Shelf Life Protection Program (SLEP), which evaluates the long-term effectiveness of medications stockpiled by the DoD and other government agencies. Under the program, medications are tested for safety and stability for extended periods of time in controlled storage conditions. In many cases, medications tested were found to be effective for years past their printed expiry dates; a 2006 study by the Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences found that two-thirds of 122 medications tested through SLEP remained effective for an average of at least four additional years. In 2016, the DoD reported that the program had helped save the department $2.1 billion on replacing stockpiled medications.

His primary concerns are analytical aspects of the music, and history of Bruckner performance. He is a contributing editor of the Bruckner Collected Edition in Vienna, sponsored by the International Bruckner Society.  Career  He was Professor of Physics at Hudson Valley Community College in Troy, New York, U.S.A., from 1965 to 2001, and is the author of a comprehensive four-volume textbook of introductory university physics.  Bruckner Editions  For the Collected Edition, at the request of Leopold Nowak, Carragan prepared a new edition of Bruckner's Second Symphony in two versions (1872 and 1877). Carragan reconstructed for the first time the first version of Bruckner's First (1866), the previously unheard versions of the Third from 1874 and 1876, and of the Fourth from 1878, as well as the 1888 intermediate versions of the Eighth. He has also devoted himself to completing Bruckner's Ninth symphony. That completion has been widely performed and recorded, Notes on the completion of the Finale of the Ninth Symphony of Bruckner by S√©bastien Letocart., the most recently in a revised version from 2017. Carragan has served as consultant in many performances of Bruckner symphonies. In 1991 he was accorded the Gold-Plakette of the Brucknerbund Ober√∂sterreich, and in 2010 he was awarded the Kilenyi Medal of Honor of the Bruckner Society of America.  Schubert Editions  For the Franz Schubert anniversary of 1978, Carragan completed and performed several of Schubert's unfinished piano sonatas, and ten years later he prepared a four-movement version of the Schubert's Eighth symphony which has been recently recorded in Germany and Japan. Other Works With respect to the baroque era, Carragan made arrangements of a concerto for four violins by Antonio Vivaldi, Op. 3, no. 1, for four harpsichord, as well as a concerto for two violins, Op. 3, no. 8, arranged after J.S.

It is a product which commercial company Inmar sells to health care providers who wish to present a Consumer Drug Take-Back Program. Drug disposal is the discarding of drugs. Individuals commonly dispose of unused drugs that remain after the end of medical treatment. Health care organizations dispose of drugs on a larger scale for a range of reasons, including having leftover drugs after treating patients and discarding of expired drugs. Failure to properly dispose of drugs creates opportunities for others (of whom the drug is unintended) to take them inappropriately. Inappropriate disposal of drugs can also cause drug pollution. People dispose of drugs in various ways; even organizations with expertise on drugs may give inconsistent information to consumers about drug disposal. Sources of drugs Medication waste includes both hazardous and non-hazardous waste, controlled substances, and expired pharmaceuticals. Medication waste can come from multiple levels in the drug's lifespan. First, it can come from production factories from where they were created. This includes unwanted pharmaceutical ingredients and materials that can no longer be used in the drug manufacturing process. Second, medication waste can be generated from healthcare facilities including hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies. Medication waste from this source can be from over prescribing of drugs from healthcare providers, hospital labs, expired drugs, opened drug containers and partially used medications. Furthermore, these wastes can include materials, such as syringes, vials, IV bags, and tubing that contain excess drugs or contaminated in the process of handling hazardous pharmaceuticals, such as chemotherapy drugs. Some states have regulations that require healthcare facilities to destroy unused medications. Lastly, pharmaceutical waste can come from excessive consumption of over-the-counter medications from patients. Sometimes normal use of a drug can result in waste. For example, when someone uses a dermal patch, after the patch is used, it will still retain significant potency, necessitating safe disposal. Reasons for disposal of drugs Medical authorities advise that consumers not store any drug that they would not have a reason at present to possess. Storing drugs creates a possibility that someone will use them inappropriately and suffer harm. Accidental ingestion of medications prescribed for another individual is a leading source of poisonings in American households. According to Poison Control Centers in the United States, in 2007 approximately 23,783 of 255,732 cases involving inappropriate medication use were associated with inadvertent exposure. 5,000 of these cases involved children under the age of 6 years old. Due to the variations in the way children's bodies metabolize drugs, medication poisoning in children can be extremely fatal. Methods for disposal =Disposal for individuals and communities= The most obvious way for individuals to dispose of drugs is through the household waste management service. Experts advise checking other options first because simply discarding drugs with other trash creates the possibility that someone could use them and be harmed. Medical authorities recommend against disposing of drugs by passing them on to other consumers. The best source of local advice will be the community pharmacy. Pharmacies already handle drugs and will recommend what sort of disposal method is most appropriate. Many pharmacies will collect drugs and dispose of them as a community service. Some regions have special government services that offer to take back and dispose of drugs. Sometimes, either a pharmacy or government service will provide a way to mail drugs to a special drug disposal facility. If there are no other options and one must put drugs into the trash, a recommended safer way to do so is by mixing the drug with unattractive trash. Putting pills into the toilet can cause drug pollution, but this might be justified as a way to quickly disposing of dangerous drugs. There have been many attempts in the United States to encourage consumers to bring their leftover drugs to disposal centers. Some examples of disposal programs include having a special event at a community center with prior advertisements for people to bring their drugs to the event, or otherwise educating individuals and concerned organizations about the correct way to dispose of drugs. One study reviewing the efficacy of these programs found that their impact was too low to have the desired result of decreasing community access to leftover drugs. =Disposal for organizations and industry= Disposal of large amounts of drugs can cause drug pollution and negatively impact the environment. Organizations might choose to dispose of large amounts of drugs by returning them to the manufacturer, putting them in landfills, using Incineration, or dumping the drugs into sewers. Disposal of controversial drugs Drugs associated with substance abuse and prohibited drugs receive special attention in their disposal. The police might seize such drugs as contraband, and then have to destroy them. In other cases, some legal drugs create risks for abuse and need more attention in disposal than drugs that are not attractive for abuse. It is challenging for governments to discuss how to properly dispose of controversial drugs. One small regional study in the United States reported the outcomes of a public health program to take back unused opioids. This study found that individuals who returned opioids tended to return more than half of what they were prescribed, which could be an indication that these people had twice as much medication as they wanted. The study was too limited to form a general conclusion, but it provided information to guide further discussion and research on whether people would participate in opioid take-back programs, what sorts of drugs are more likely to be returned, and how much people would return. There is a list of medications in which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends to be disposed of via flushing down the toilet if consumers are unable to take these drugs to a drug take-back program. These medications contain controlled substances that are dangerous to pets and other people in the home and should be disposed of immediately when no longer needed. Examples include Dilaudid (hydromorphone hydrochloride) tablets, fentanyl patches and morphine sulfate oral solution. These products should immediately flush due to high potential for abuse and overdose.  Worldwide Drug Disposal Practices  = European Union = In 2001, the European Parliament released a Directive regarding the disposal practices of medicinal products. Directive 2001/83/EC stated that the outer packaging of medications needed to include special disposal precautions. In 2004, the EU put out another directive that further clarified the 2001 directive and called for establishment of medication collection protocols and information regarding specific collection protocols for the state or country be placed on the packaging. United Kingdom As outlined in National Health Service SI 2014/349: The National Health Service (Pharmaceutical and Local Pharmaceutical Services) Regulations 2013, local pharmacies are obligated to take back unused and unwanted medications generated in the home. Per these same regulations, pharmacies are responsible for sorting the medications and returning them to the NHS. = Canada = Canada has no specific nationwide drug take back or disposal policy, but most provinces have individual plans.Health Canada. Pharmaceutical disposal programs for the public: A Canadian perspective. Health Canada environmental impact initiative. 2009. http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.productstewardship.us/resource/resmgr/imported/Takeback%20(2).pdf. Accessed 2018-11-01 Most pharmacies in Canada can take back unused and expired medications any day of the year.  National Regulations in the United States  In the United States, used prescriptions are serious safety concerns because they can be accidentally ingested, overdosed or diverted for illegal use. To address these concerns, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) created National Prescription Drug Take-Back Days that occurs twice annually in April and October. These Take Back Days are part of a mission to create safe medication disposal sites, prevent drug diversion or transfer of the prescribed drug for illicit use, and provide education for the public. In April 2017, the 13th National Drug Take Back Day included 5,498 collection sites across the country and 450 tons unused or expired prescription medicines were collected. Additionally, The National Association of Drug Diversion Investigators (NADDI) sponsors a website to locate Rx Drug Drop Boxes for safe medication disposal outside of National Prescription Drug Take-Back Days. = Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 = The \\"Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010\\" was proposed to amend the \\"Controlled Substances Act\\" created in 1970 which prohibits the disposal of controlled substances unless a member of law enforcement has authorization from the DEA to directly receive and dispose of the controlled substance. This bars drug take-back programs from being able to receive and dispose of controlled medications for members of the public, which in turn can lead to the potential misuse of these drugs. Misuse of prescription medications has been a growing epidemic, with deaths from opioids quadrupling since 1999. It was shown that in 2006, about 1/3 of new prescription drug abusers were 12-17-year-olds. With these statistics, Congress decided to take an active role in trying to make drug take-back programs more readily available. Therefore, the \\"Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010\\" was created to allow the Attorney General permission in creating new policies to provide citizens ‚Äúconvenient and safe‚Äù disposal of their unwanted medications to authorized people or facilities. Congress created this act with a goal of preventing drug diversion and environmental harm/pollution by these drugs. = Other Take Back Programs = In addition to the drug disposal of 2012, other national agencies have also promoted the use of the drug take-back programs. In 2011, White House announced the first national Prescription Abuse Prevention Plan. The Prescription Abuse Prevention Plan expanded support to the prescription drug disposal programs and decreased the supply of unused prescription drugs. The Environmental Protection Agency also encouraged the use of prescription drug disposal programs with guidelines for household disposal of medication and recommendations on the incineration of the household pharmaceutical product. The American Pharmacist Association and Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America also partnered with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to raise awareness for consumers to properly dispose of medication. The campaign encouraged consumers to not flush unused medications or pour them down the sink. The campaign also recognized pharmacists' role to inform consumers of the different disposal techniques and which medications are appropriate for flushing. Examples of State Regulations = Alameda County Safe Drug Disposal Ordinance = Alameda County was the first county in the United States to make the manufacturer pay for safe disposal of pharmaceutical waste. This ordinance required companies that manufacture drugs sold and distributed in Alameda County must operate and pay for a \\"Product Stewardship Program.\\" Examples of these programs include a drug kiosk or mail-back program and volunteer collectors, such as law enforcement and pharmacies. Due to this program 8 other counties in California adopted similar programs, including San Mateo, Santa Barbara, Santa Clara, Marin, Los Angeles, Santa Cruz, Sonoma, Contra Costa, San Luis Obispo, and Tehama Counties. =California State Board of Pharmacy= In California, entities including pharmacies in retail and hospital settings may host drug take-back programs as long as they follow requirements under Article 9.1 of Division 17 of Title 16 of the California Code of Regulations. These pharmacies are required to register with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and notify the Board of Pharmacy and DEA within 30 days of starting or stopping a program. These pharmacies must have collection receptacles located in authorized locations and have liners that are certified to meet American Society for Testing Materials standards. The pharmacies must also follow protocols like accepting prescription drugs to be sent back to an authorized DEA destruction site and no employee can be part of the program if they have a history with controlled substance-related felonies. The pharmacy may not sort, count, or review the unwanted prescription medications once collected and they are required to report tampering of any receptacles to the Board of Pharmacy within 14 days. It is important to note that these pharmaceutical take-back programs only take prescription medications, not drug samples or medical waste. = California Senate Bill 212 = On September 30, 2018, California passed SB 212: Solid waste: pharmaceutical and sharps waste stewardship. Similar to the Alameda County Ordinance, this is a statewide drug and needle program funded by manufacturers or distributors. The bill requires that these entities create their own stewardship program or be part of a stewardship program, which will be approved by CalRecycle. The bill mandates a minimum of 5 collection sites per county or if the county is larger it requires 1 per 50,000 people. They also require retail pharmacies to serve as an \\"authorized collector.\\" Authorized collectors serve their counties in one location or 15% of store locations in the county, depending which is greater. The bill will begin January 2019, with approvals by CalRecyle completed and implementation of the programs started January 2021.

The generation of an active sub-atmospheric pressure or vacuum builds the basis of chest drain management. A vacuum is defined as ‚Äúspace with zero pressure‚Äù generating a difference in pressure between the pleural space and the atmosphere creates sub-atmospheric pressure in the pleural space, which is used to generate a vacuum in the chest drains.  History  The so- called ‚Äúcentral vacuum‚Äù was the first sub-atmospheric pressure device available. Sub-atmospheric pressure of around 100 cm of water column was historically generated at a central location in the hospital. This ‚Äúcentral vacuum‚Äù was available throughout the entire hospital, as it was proved via a tubing system. It was referred to as ‚Äúwall suction‚Äù. Reduction valves that reduce the negative pressure to a therapeutically reasonable range were commercially available later. Due to this, multi-chamber suction ‚Äì the use of three-chamber systems ‚Äì was developed. In the 1960s, the first pumps (Emerson- Pump) were available. These and other systems launched later generated a fixed ‚Äúnegative pressure‚Äù. These pumps couldn‚Äôt compensate for an inadequate position of the collection chamber of a siphon. Since 2008, an electronically driven and regulated system is available, generating a ‚Äúnegative pressure‚Äù on demand.  Suction process  External suction (previously referred to as active suction) is used to create a sub-atmospheric pressure at the tip of a catheter. As the atmospheric pressure is lower compared to the intrapleural pressure, the lack of external suction (which was previously referred to as passive suction) is used to drain air and fluids. Traditional drainage systems are not able to suction sub-atmospheric pressure in the pleural space. These systems only allow for a regulation of pressure via the system itself but cannot regulate sub-atmospheric pressure in the pleural space.  Drain types  = Heber- and B√ºlau- Drain principles = Two different principles are used in chest drainage management: The Heber-Drain principle and the B√ºlau- Drain principle. The ‚ÄúHeber-Drain‚Äù is based on the Heber principle, which uses hydrostatic pressure to transfer fluid from the chest to a collection canister. It produces permanent passive suction. As the Heber drain is a classical gravity drain, the canister must be placed below chest level to be active. The difference in height between the floor and the patient bed determines the resultant sub-atmospheric pressure. With a difference, for example, of 70 cm in height, a pressure of minus 70 cm of water is created. A water seal component is always combined with a Heber-Drain. The ‚ÄúB√ºlau-Drain‚Äù is based on the B√ºlau principle and creates a permanent passive suction within a closed system that is based on the Heber-Drain principle. The pulmonologist Gotthard B√ºlau (1835-1900) used this system in 1875 for the first time for the treatment of pleural empyema. = Mediastinal drain = This type of drainage is mainly used in cardiac surgery. Mediastinal drains are placed behind the sternum and/or next to the heart. The main indication in these cases is the monitoring of post-operative bleeding. Whether these drains are used with active suction or not depends on factors such as personal preference and experience of the physician, individual patient-related factors etc... = Pericardial drain = Drainage of the pericardium can be achieved by puncture (transcutaneously) or surgically. In the first case, small-bore catheters not suitable for the drainage of blood (e.g. hemopericard) are used. Pericardial drains are mostly used with the help of gravity. As a pericardial drain is placed surgically, a largo bore drain is used with a decreased probability of clogging. = Chest drainage systems =  One-chamber-system  The simplest system that is sufficient for chest drainage is a one-chamber system. It uses either a Heber-drain or an active suction source and comprises a single collection canister. For active or passive air evacuation, a water seal component is attached. To ensure that all air is sucked out when using a Heber-drain, manual support might be needed. To prevent a pneumothorax or subcutaneous emphysema when the patient is not able to breathe out or cough out surplus air, the height between the patient bed and the ground might need adjustment. As air leaks are not always easy to observe, some one-chamber systems are limited when it comes to the treatment of huge air leaks, especially when the patient produces a lot of foam.  Two-chamber-system  In a two-chamber system air and fluid are directed to a first collection canister. Gravity keeps the fluid in the first canister, whereas air is directed into a second canister. The air can either actively or passively be released via a water seal. Two-chamber systems are mainly used for patients with huge air leaks. These patients often produce foam due to protein rich surfactant that might enter the tubing toward the patient.  Multi-chamber- system  Early three-chamber systems used an extra glass bottle filled with water as a third water-vacuometer chamber in addition to a two-chamber system. The sub-atmospheric pressure was controlled with a pipe. The higher the pipe depth, the lower the generated pressure in the pleural space. These systems were used in times of the central vacuum and are not used anymore as they caused accidents and were not very ease to use. The mechanics of these systems depended on high flows (20l/min) for the system to be considered active.  Digital systems  Portable electronic system In modern portable, digital chest drainage systems, the collection chamber is integrated into the system. During the suction process, fluid will be collected in the chamber and air discharged into the atmosphere. Digital chest drainage systems have many advantages compared to traditional, analogue systems: * Mobility: enhanced mobility increases the quality of life and accelerates the recovery. * Real time data collection: air leaks and fluid production can be tracked in real time by following the paddle-wheel-principle in ml/min * Objective data measurement: discrepancies in evaluation of the clinical course are significantly lower when using an electronic system compared to classical systems. * Double lumen tubing: allows for a separation of fluid and air, sub- atmospheric pressure is measured via the thinner of the two tubes. This allows one to monitor the sub-atmospheric pressure very close to the pleural space; therefore, the system works correctly, irrespective of where it is placed. Data measured next to the pleural space comes quite close to the real pressure within the pleural space * Shortened drainage time: Healing is a dynamic process. On average, one day less is needed for chest drainage time when using electronic systems after anatomic resections * Increased safety, reduced workload: alarm features increase safety of the treatment and reduce the workload of nursing staff Electronic systems do not apply permanent suction but monitor the patient very closely and are activated when needed. On average, after an uncomplicated lobectomy, an electronic pump is active for 90 minutes within 2.5 days.

Conservation concerns begin at collection and continue through preparation, storage, examination, documentation, research and treatment when restoration is needed.  Collection  261x261px Insect collecting can be done in many different ways depending on the kind of insects being collected and from which habitats. Both hobbyists and professional entomologist have found particular ways to collect with minimal damage to their specimens. Following established techniques helps begin the conservation of insect specimens from the beginning by eliminating as much potential damage as possible. It must be done delicately to ensure that neither the collector nor the live insect itself will cause harm to the distinctive features such as wings, legs and antennae that give purpose to the collection. Special collection nets, traps and techniques must be utilized in consideration of how easily breakage can happen. A kill jar is often used to immediately immobilize the insect before it can damage itself.  Preparation  The way an insect specimen is prepared is often the first step in their conservation. They have to be carefully prepared with the appropriate methods depending on their size, anatomy, and potentially delicate features to ensure they will not break before they begin their role as a specimen available for study, research and display. Some specimens must be prepared using a dry method and others with liquid to preserve. The choice made will preserve key features necessary for identification and represent the insect's living form as closely as possible. = Pinning = thumb The process of pinning insect specimens is a dry method to preserve and display collections and requires special entomological equipment to accomplish effectively. It is used primarily for hard-bodied, medium to large specimens and is beneficial for easier study and color preservation. Flies and butterflies, though they are partially soft-bodied, are also best preserved through pinning because when preserved in fluid their hairs and/or scales will either clot or fall off.Ross, H. H., 1962, How to collect and preserve insects p. 20 Retrieved from Biodiversity Heritage Library 2017-03-16 Some smaller specimens may still be pinned use minuten pins, which are much thinner, to avoid breakage. Insects are pinned on foam block or specialized pinning blocks that provide support for the limbs while drying and may be moved to another specialized, protected display case after they have dried completely, at which point they will be more brittle. The pin is most often driven through the thorax of the insect just to the right of the mid-line to preserve the appearance of at least one side should any damage occur from pinning. The exception is butterflies, dragonflies and damselflies, which are pinned through the middle of the thorax.National Park Service, 2006, Curation of insect specimens Conserve O Gram 11/8 Retrieved 2017-03-30 Enough of the pin must be left both above and below the specimen to allow for labeling below and handling.National Park Service, 2006, Curation of insect specimens Conserve O Gram 11/8 Retrieved 2017-03-30 thumb = Carding = Carding is used when pinning would destroy too much of the specimen because its size is quite small.Ross, H.

A pin is then driven through the broad side of the point for mounting. A soluble glue that can be removed with solvents when necessary is used to adhere the right side of the thorax of the specimen to the point opposite the pinned side. The point is sometimes bent to allow the specimen to present in the same position as normally pinned specimens. = Wet specimen = A wet specimen is a specimen preserved in fluid, often 70% alcohol. Specimens that would receive this preservation technique are usually soft-bodied, such as caterpillars, larva, and spiders because of their soft abdomens. This is done to minimize shriveling allowing the identifying characteristics to be preserved as true to life as possible. Hard-bodied insects may also be preserved temporarily in alcohol before pinning.National Park Service, 2006, Curation of insect specimens Conserve O Gram 11/8 Retrieved 2017-03-30 = Slides = Slides of very small insects are also kept as part of insect collections.  Core aspects of conservation  The American Institute for Conservation (AIC) describes in their Code of Ethics the aspects of conservation to include: preventive conservation, examination, documentation, treatment, research and education. Each of these areas also apply to the conservation and restoration of insect specimens. = Preventive conservation = Insect collections may suffer multiple types of degradation including fading colors from light exposure, mold growth from improper humidity and temperature levels, and infestations from pests that feed on dried insect,Texas A&M; Agrilife Extension, (n.d.)

Routine cleaning  In addition to maintaining a clean storage environment for specimens, it is sometimes necessary to clean the specimens themselves. Cleaning incredibly delicate and brittle dry insect specimens is done carefully and methodically. The conservator chooses the appropriate method based on the kind of insect that needs cleaning and how robust it is. Cleaning tools vary widely, but generally clean watercolor brushes are used to gently dust the specimens, sometimes with a stereo microscope for very small specimens, warm water and/or alcohol baths used with or without an ultrasonic cleaner, and lens blowers to gently blow away dust, or dry the specimen after a cleansing bath.Ingles-LeNobel, Johan, J. (March, 2017). How to clean insects Retrieved 2017-04-08  Proper storage  A common way to prevent damage from pests intent to feed on insect specimens and dust accumulation in a collection is to keep them in sealed boxes or cabinets.Icon, The Institute of Conservation, 2013, Care and conservation of zoological specimens Retrieved 2017-03-30 When properly sealed, they can also aid in preventing damages cause by relative humidity (RH) and temperature fluctuations.Szczepanowska, H., Shockley, F., Furth, D. G., Gentile, P., Bell, D., DePriest, P. T., Mecklenburg, M., Hawks, C. Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections. (2013). Effectiveness of entomological collection storage cabinets in maintaining stable relative humidity and temperature in a historic museum building. Collection Forum, 27(1-2), 43-53. Wet specimens are kept in separate vials or jars and in a secure cabinet, tray or shelf. Fluid levels are regularly monitored to ensure specimens are completely immersed in fluid, though a well-sealed jar or vial will prevent excessive evaporation.National Park Service, 2006, Curation of insect specimens Conserve O Gram 11/8 Retrieved 2017-03-30  Safe handling  Proper handling for insect specimens prevents the excessive breaking of legs, antennae and other body parts that could then easily be lost. Curved forceps may be used to allow more precision and less chance of the brittle specimen coming in contact with the handler. The handler picks up the specimen by the pin, which is placed with enough space below the specimen for the handler to put in the pinning block and enough space above to grip without touching the specimen.National Park Service, 2006, Curation of insect specimens Conserve O Gram 11/8 Retrieved 2017-03-30 The flour beetle, a common pest affecting dried insect specimens.  Integrated pest management  Integrated pest management (IPM) is a specialized modern pest control used in museums.Buck, R. A., & Allman Gilmore, J. (2010). Museum registration methods 5th edition. Washington, DC: The AAM Press All IPM systems begin with regular sanitation and monitoring of collections to detect castings from various pests, and checking insect traps laid out to capture and identify which pests are present. Some pests, such as carpet beetles and flour beetles, feed on dried insects.Ross, H. H., 1962, How to collect and preserve insects p. 27 Retrieved from Biodiversity Heritage Library 2017-03-16 When an infestation is present, treatment may be necessary. Freezing is commonly used to rid insect collections of pests.Canadian Conservation Institute, (1997), Controlling insect pests with low temperature CCI Notes Retrieved 2017-04-08 Alternatively, inert gases may be used for an anoxic fumigation - depriving the pests of oxygen to exterminate, and in extreme cases chemical fumigation proven to be safe for collections and people may be used.Furth, D., Dec. 1995, Pest control in entomological collections Insect collection news No. 10 Retrieved 2017-03-30 = Examination = Verdigris is present near the pin and an antenna is missing. Assessing the condition of an insect collection is done regularly and the results are recorded accordingly. The conservator observes the specimens in high detail remarking all areas of damage, or altered states of the specimen. Tools used during this process may include a strong light source, magnifying glass and handling tools that allow the conservator to pick up the specimen from the pin without touching it. The observations made during the examination process result in the conclusions drawn for a treatment plan if necessary.Appelbaum, B. (2010). Conservation treatment methodology. San Bernardino, CA. The conservator is knowledgeable of the kinds of deterioration to look for specific to insect specimens.  Common agents of deterioration  * Pests - Evidence of pests are recognized in castings of insects, their droppings or the damages they have caused from chewing on specimens. * Mold - Mold is most likely to grow when humidity is high. * Verdigris - A blue-green hair-like crystallization caused by reaction to copper and brass entomological pins and the fats from the insects internal organs.Icon, The Institute of Conservation, 2013, Care and conservation of zoological specimens Retrieved 2017-03-30 = Documentation = The documentation of insect specimens is carried out in many different aspects of a specimen's existence. Documented information begins with the capture of an insect. The collector records information about capture method, place and date of capture and any relevant habitat information in field notes. This information is then transferred to labels and collection records. The documentation path then continues with every recorded observation or treatment the specimen receives. Killing agents, preservation agents, rehydrating agents, and fumigants are all important to record.Morse, J., Dec. 1992, Insect collection conservation Insect collection news No. 8 Retrieved 2017-03-30 This then informs any future decisions for conservation actions.  Labeling  As a minimum, labels contain the place and date of collection, and the identification of genus and species. On pinned insects, the labels are likewise pinned with the space left under the specimen on the same pin.National Park Service, 2006, Curation of insect specimens Conserve O Gram 11/8 Retrieved 2017-03-30 There are various ways to write the information on labels, but an ink that will not fade or come off in liquid is generally used. The paper is ideally 100% cotton or linen rag to avoid yellowing or embrittlement of the paper as it ages.Morse, J., Dec. 1992, Insect collection conservation Insect collection news No. 8 Retrieved 2017-03-30 145x145px  Photographing and digitization  With improvements in digital photography and web resources, many natural history museums have begun a new kind of documentation through digitization, bringing high quality images and associated information to anyone with access to the Internet. Large databases can hold vast amounts of information improving research efforts. Pen and ink scientific illustration of a dragonfly.  Illustrating  Scientific illustration of insects is an older technique used to preserve information about collected insects. It visually documents insects, and unlike photography, can add intellectual ideas about anatomy and behavior of the insect through artists' renditions. Scientifically informed observation of specimens combined with technical and aesthetic skill yields the highly detailed illustrations necessary for the documentation of each species that is illustrated.Hodges, E. R. S. (2003). The guild handbook of scientific illustration: Second edition. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, Inc.  Description of the state of the specimen and treatments  This area of insect specimen documentation comes after the close examination of specimens by conservators. The conservator records all of the visual information about the specimen that can be gleaned from detailed inspection. Conclusions are drawn from inspection and potential treatments are also documented to inform researchers and future conservators. Researching ticks helps develop health guidelines against the diseases they spread. = Research = Researching the collections of insects provides important information that develops knowledge about ecology, human health and crops.Ross, H. H., 1962, How to collect and preserve insects p. 23 Retrieved from Biodiversity Heritage Library 2017-03-16 Well-kept records aid the researcher in identifying whether there are differences in an observed specimen because of damages, treatments or deterioration.

It is highly preferable that any treatment applied be reversible or done with little risk to the specimen. For example, broken limbs may be glued back on, which has traditionally been done with white glue. The advantage to white glue being that it is removable in warm water.National Park Service, 2006, Curation of insect specimens Conserve O Gram 11/8 Retrieved 2017-03-30 Another common problem is pest infestation. When dried insect collections have suffered an infestation, the affected specimens can be frozen or sealed with inert gases to kill the pests without harming the specimens.Furth, D., Dec. 1995, Pest control in entomological collections Insect collection news No. 10 Retrieved 2017-03-30 Other treatments might include simply refilling wet specimens' jars with alcohol to ensure the specimens are completely submerged, cleaning specimens of dust and debris, or repositioning specimens for display or research. In the case that a specimen needs to be repositioned, the conservator will \\"relax\\" the specimen in a jar with a rehydrating substrate to move the limbs without breaking them. The technique used will vary among conservators. Some use a relaxing jar that the specimen is left in for days with the substrate of choice, others may choose to use a warm water bath with a drop of detergent. Whatever treatments are used are diligently documented. = Education = Conservation of insect specimens is done in large part to preserve the information for the public. The display of collections in museums and their interpretation offer one avenue that accomplishes this effort. However, websites offer a unique opportunity to disseminate information to a broad audience with layers of information to give general information or to provide depth where desired. These websites are often also provided by museums and their collections. Below is a list of some major educational endeavors with interests in insect specimens.

The ship was constructed throughout late 1942 and early 1943 before being deployed to the European theater, where it undertook supply operations in support of Allied troops in North Africa and Italy. It was sunk by a German U-boat in February 1944.  Construction  LST-348 was constructed at the Norfolk Naval Yard beginning on November 10, 1942, to be used for convoy operations in the European theater. The ship was launched on February 7, 1943 and commissioned two days later. Under the command of Lieutenant Stephenson Jennings, an officer in the United States Naval Reserve, the ship was assigned to the European theater.  Service history  LST-348 joined the Italian Campaign of World War II by July 1943 deploying supplies and reinforcements throughout North Africa and Italian coastline in support of the Allied invasion of Sicily. In September 1943, the ship supported Operation Avalanche, the landings at Salerno. On January 22, 1944, LST-348 was assigned to support the Anzio beachhead. In late January, the ship was heavily attacked by Axis aircraft while operating around the beachhead, resulting in several near misses. After moving further south, the ship came under heavy bombardment from shore-based artillery before being relieved by LST-377 in early February. On February 20, 1944, while sailing from Nisida to Anzio, LST-348 was struck on her port side by a torpedo fired from the German U-boat U-410. LST-348 was struck once more on her port side before orders were received to abandon ship. The ship was the ordered to be scuttled starting a large fire on board which would be extinguished once a third and final torpedo would sink the ship. Twenty-four members of the ship's crew perished, while 79 were rescued. Two battle stars were awarded to the ship for its World War II service. Following the ship's sinking, an investigation found that at the time of the attack, LST-348 had not been at the required readiness condition. Her guns had not been manned and only limited lookouts had been stationed. Jennings was subsequently reprimanded for these oversights.

Completed during the First World War, she served as a troop ship and was nearly sunk by a German naval mine, but without loss of life. Between the wars she operated commercially in the Pacific Ocean, before returning to military service in the Second World War. Her final civil role was to carry Islamic pilgrims from Indonesia to Mecca, before being scrapped in 1960. Description The ship was long, with a beam of . She had a depth of . She was powered by two triple expansion steam engines, which had cylinders of 22in (56 cm), and diameter by stroke. The engines drove twin screw propellers. They were rated at 622 nhp and were built by Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company. She was assessed at , . Construction The ship was ordered on 3 March 1914, intended for the Ocean Steamship Company's Trans-Pacific Service, and was built at the yard of Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company Ltd at Greenock on the River Clyde in Scotland. On completion in November 1916, she was taken-up as a troopship by the Admiralty under the Liner Requisition Scheme. The United Kingdom official number 137527 and Code Letters JPNG were allocated. Her port of registry was Liverpool. First World War Her maiden voyage in January 1917 was from her home port of Liverpool to the Far East, under Captain George Flynn. On 6 February 1917, Tyndareus struck a mine which had been laid by the merchant raider, SMS Wolf, while about 10 miles (16 km) off Cape Agulhas, the geographic southern tip of the African continent. The explosion tore a large hole in the forward part of her hull and she began to sink by the head. On board were 30 officers and 1,000 men of the 25th (Garrison Service) Battalion, The Middlesex Regiment, who were bound for Hong Kong, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel John Ward, who was the Liberal‚ÄìLabour Member of Parliament for Stoke-upon-Trent. The troops were paraded on deck in their life jackets while a roll call was taken. According to an account published in the Cape Times, the soldiers then began to sing \\"There's a Long Long Trail A-Winding\\" and \\"It's a Long Way to Tipperary\\" while waiting for further orders, which the journalist described as a \\"fine story of British pluck, recalling that of the Birkenhead\\". Despite rough seas, all the troops were successfully transferred to another Blue Funnel ship, SS Eumaeus, and the hospital ship, HMHS Oxfordshire, which had responded to Tyndareus's SOS signals. A British cruiser, HMS Hyacinth, arrived from Simonstown accompanied by a tug to assist the stricken troopship. The captain of Hyacinth ordered that Tyndareus be beached, as it was a hazard to shipping, but Captain Flynn ignored the order and by skillful seamanship and damage control, was able to take the sinking ship safely into Simonstown, where she could be repaired. The Governor General of South Africa, Viscount Buxton, wrote to the chairman of the Blue Funnel Line, congratulating the company and the ship's builders on the design features of the hull which enabled the ship to be saved, which he presumed were \\"consequent upon the loss of the Titanic\\". King George V sent a message to the troops which read: \\"Please express to the officers commanding the Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment my admiration of the conduct displayed by all ranks on the occasion of the accident to Tyndareus. In their discipline and courage they worthily upheld the splendid tradition of Birkenhead, ever cherished in the annals of the British Army.\\" An oil painting of the soldiers parading on deck was made by Stanley Llewellyn Wood. A memorial stone was commissioned by Lieutenant Colonel Ward recording the gallantry of his men, and was erected on Victoria Peak on Hong Kong Island; it was brought to London in 1994 and is now at the National Army Museum in Chelsea. Interwar period Returned to the Blue Funnel Line in 1920, Tyndareus finally began her intended \\"Trans-Pacific Service\\" which ran from Hong Kong to Tacoma, Washington, via Japan, Vancouver and Seattle. She was briefly taken-up as a troopship in 1927 to take British reinforcements to Shanghai during the \\"China Affair\\". In 1934, her Code Letters were changed to GMKX. Second World War In 1940, Tyndareus was requisitioned again to carry troops and military stores. In October 1940, she was one of 32 Allied merchant and transport ships that formed Convoy BN 7, which was on passage from Bombay to Suez via Aden with a heavy naval escort. On 20 October, the convoy was attacked by four Italian destroyers off Massawa in the Red Sea. One Italian destroyer was sunk without loss to the transports, although a British destroyer was disabled and towed to safety. The last wartime convoy for Tyndareus was MKS.99G from Gibraltar to Liverpool, arriving on 12 May 1945. Postwar In 1949, Tyndareus was refitted at a cost of ¬£126,650 to take Muslims on the Hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, with accommodation for 2,500 pilgrims. First sailing from Indonesia to Jeddah in 1950, she continued without a serious breakdown until a replacement was acquired in 1960. She finally arrived at Hong Kong on 9 September 1960, where she was broken up.

This book contains the prophecies attributed to the prophet/priest Ezekiel, and is one of the Books of the Prophets. Chapters 20 to 24 contain a series of \\"predictions regarding the fall of Jerusalem\\",Davidson, A. B. (1893), Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on Ezekiel 20, accessed 28 November 2019 and this chapter contains three separate prophecies centering on the inevitable punishment due to the city's guilt. Text The original text was written in the Hebrew language. This chapter is divided into 32 verses. =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text tradition, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), Aleppo Codex (10th century), Codex Leningradensis (1008). There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BC. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; \\\\mathfrak{G}B; 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; \\\\mathfrak{G}A; 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; \\\\mathfrak{G}Q; 6th century). Structure The chapter has three divisions.Section headings in the New King James Version The first contains a denunciation of the various sins of Jerusalem coupled with a promise of judgment (verses 1-16). The prophet then compares Jerusalem to metal filled with impurities, and promises that God will purge the impurities by burning (17-22). Ezekiel then justifies the judgment against Jerusalem in terms of wrongful acts committed by various leaders, including prophets, priests, and the nobility (23-31). Verse 2 :‚ÄúNow, son of man, will you judge, will you judge the bloody city? Yes, show her all her abominations! NKJV The phrase \\"Son of man\\" (Hebrew: ◊ë◊ü÷æ◊ê◊ì◊ù -) is used 93 times in the book of Ezekiel to address the prophet. Each of the three sections in this chapter commence with God's word to the \\"son of man\\" (verses 2, 18 and 24). Verse 18 : Son of man, the house of Israel has become dross to Me; :: they are all bronze, tin, iron, and lead, in the midst of a furnace; :: they have become dross from silver. NKJV This verse introduces the figure of a smelting furnace. * \\"Dross\\" (Hebrew: ◊°◊ô◊í or ◊°◊ï◊í, , plural: ◊°◊í◊ô◊ù): \\"what is removed from metal\\", usually of silver; \\"the refuse of metal\\", \\"scoria\\", baser metal that is separated from the purer metal by melting. As silver is purified in the furnace to remove the floating dross until the reflection of the image of the refiner is shown from its molten surface, the judgment of Israel was for the purpose of purification.The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha, Augmented Third Edition, New Revised Standard Version, Indexed.

Her sire, Sir Ivor was an American-bred colt who was trained in Europe and won The Derby and the Washington D C International in 1968 before standing as a breeding stallion in Kentucky. Sir Ivor's other major winners included Ivanjica, Cloonlara and Bates Motel. Lady Capulet's dam Cap and Bells was a successful racehorse and broodmare. Her other foals included Drone, an undefeated racehorse and successful breeding stallion, and Sir Wimborne, winner of the National Stakes and Royal Lodge Stakes. She was descended from the influential British broodmare Mistrella (foaled 1907) whose descendants have included The Oaks winners Beam and Light Brocade. Racing career =1977: three-year-old season= A lack of physical maturity, coupled with the effects of a viral infection, meant that Lady Capulet did not race as a two-year-old. Poor ground conditions hampered her training in the spring of 1977 and it was not until 13 May that she made her first racecourse appearance in the Irish 1000 Guineas over one mile at the Curragh Racecourse. With the stable's first-choice jockey Lester Piggott opting to ride the Princess Elizabeth Stakes winner Lady Mere she was partnered by Tommy Murphy. The Athasi Stakes winner Orchestration started favourite ahead of Bold Fantasy, Lady Mere and Lady North with Lady Capulet starting a 16/1 outsider in a fourteen-runner field. After being restrained in the early stages Lady Capulet moved up on the outside a quarter of a mile from the finish to dispute the lead with Bold Fantasy and Nanticious before accelerating away from her rivals. She won by three lengths and a head from Bold Fantasy and Lay Mere with Nanticious (later to win the Ribblesdale Stakes) taking fourth place. In June the filly was sent to England and was made odds-on favourite for the Coronation Stakes in which she was ridden by Piggott. On this occasion, however, her lack of experience seemed to tell as she was beaten a head into second by Orchestration. Piggott was again in the saddle later that month when Lady Capulet started odds-on favourite for the Pretty Polly Stakes over ten furlongs at the Curragh. She failed to reproduce her best form and finished third, five lengths behind the winner Claire's Slipper, appearing to be unsuited by the distance and the good-to-firm ground. She was later found to have been suffering from a \\"blood disorder\\". Assessment In 1977, the independent Timeform organisation gave Lady Capulet a rating of 116, seventeen pounds behind their top three-year-old filly Dunfermline. In the Irish Free Handicap for three-year-olds, she was rated the second best filly, one pound behind Orchestration. Breeding record Lady Capulet never raced again after her defeat in the Pretty Polly and was retired from racing at the end of 1977 to become a broodmare. She produced at least thirteen foals and four winner between 1980 and 1996: *Donna Sabina, a chestnut filly, foaled in 1980, sired by Nonoalco. Unraced. *All Ashore, grey filly, 1982, by Nureyev *Sheristadar, grey filly, 1983, by Shergar *Entitled, chestnut colt, 1984, by Mill Reef. Won Desmond Stakes, third in the Irish Derby. *Zakarif, bay mare, 1988, by Lomond. Unraced. *El Prado, grey colt, 1989, by Sadler's Wells. Won four races including the National Stakes. Later the Leading sire in North America, with his winners including Medaglia d'Oro and Kitten's Joy. *Portrait Gallery, grey colt, 1990, by Sadler's Wells. Won three races, second in Blandford Stakes. Sire of National Hunt horses. *Pia Tiara, bay filly, 1991, by Sadler's Wells. Won one race in Japan. *Royal College, bay colt, 1992, by Sadler's Wells. Failed to win in three races. *Antonia Bin, grey filly, 1993, by Sadler's Wells. Failed to win in two races. *Asakusa Arondel, chestnut colt, 1994, by Caerleon. Failed to win in eight races. *Lake Valentia, bay filly, 1995, by Fairy King. Unplaced on only start. *Valnerina, grey filly, 1996, by Caerleon. Unraced.

The project began as a studio-only effort with Lunn writing and performing all parts. While he remains the driving creative force, Panopticon has since expanded to include a lineup of musicians for live performances. The music features many familiar elements of black metal, but additionally incorporates bluegrass and Appalachian folk. In addition to sounds typical to heavy metal music, such as distorted guitars and rapid drumming, Panopticon also incorporates a diverse range of additional instrumentation, such as banjos, fiddles, bells, synthesizers and acoustic guitars. Lunn is an avid outdoorsman, and some listeners have noted the influence of the natural world on Panopticon's music; for example, in a review of the album Autumn Eternal on Pitchfork.com, one music critic noted, \\"one can easily imagine a Henry David Thoreau-like figure retreating to the woods to contemplate personal, spiritual, and environmental concerns.\\" Lunn's music has also been described as \\"natural, organic, and methodical, masterful in its writing, fiery and alive in its execution.\\"  Concept and material  Panopticon is named after utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham's concept for a prison, which implies a surveillance state. Other philosophers such as Michel Foucault have argued that in today's modern \\"disciplinary\\" society, other hierarchical structures such as the army, the factory, the school, and the hospital have evolved to fit Bentham's concept for a panopticon. Lunn is himself an anarchist, and political themes underlie many of the band's releases. To date, Panopticon has released eight full- length albums, one a double-CD (or four-LP) set, and eight split albums, plus a compilation containing remixed and remastered versions of Panopticon's third and fourth albums. All of Panopticon's albums apart from the first are concept albums. The albums often vary widely in style, in many cases influenced by the subject matter. Panopticon's self-titled debut album was originally self- released in 2008 on Lunn's own Lundr Records (Lundr is the Nordic form of Lunn's name; his family is of Norwegian descent). All packaging in the initial release was self-created, and the songs were accompanied by lengthy essays Lunn had written describing their content. The initial release was limited to 200 copies. It was later reissued on Pagan Flames Records with different packaging; the essays were not included in this release. Physical releases of the album feature a cover of the crust punk band Amebix's song \\"ICBM\\"; the album also includes a song named for anarchist/feminist Emma Goldman. In 2009, Lunn released Collapse and two splits, one with Los Angeles-based black metal band Lake of Blood and another with Louisville, Kentucky-based avant-garde metal act Wheels Within Wheels. The Lake of Blood split included a metal song about the execution of Sacco and Vanzetti and a moody acoustic piece with samples discussing the genocide of American Indians. The Wheels Within Wheels split included a bluegrass re-arrangement of a song from the first album and a song discussing the Haymarket massacre. Collapse is a concept album themed around what Lunn regards as the inevitable ecological collapse of modern civilization. The album includes a lengthy bluegrass interlude at the end of its first track, and it incorporates substantial post-rock influence throughout the album. The final song is entirely acoustic. The vinyl re- release features an Amebix cover, \\"The Beginning of the End\\", featuring Amebix's vocalist, Rob \\"The Baron\\" Miller. ...On the Subject of Mortality is Panopticon's third album, though its material was initially released on split CDs with the Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based band When Bitter Spring Sleeps and the Courtenay, British Columbia-based band Skagos. The album was later reissued as a two-LP set. The album is themed around death and religion, and it incorporates substantial samples from the Swedish film The Seventh Seal. In the liner notes, Lunn encourages listeners to watch the film. The album is an example of the blackgaze style, as it incorporates substantial influence from the shoegaze genre. Lunn attempted a do-it-yourself production here, to his eventual dissatisfaction; as a result, it was entirely remixed and remastered in 2016, alongside Social Disservices, for a collection entitled Revisions of the Past. Around this time, Panopticon released a second split with Wheels Within Wheels. This is his first of several releases not to feature printed lyrics, as Lunn felt they were too personal; he suggested in the liner notes that listeners could believe the songs were about whatever they wished. This split also features a blackgaze style and incorporates a large amount of clean singing. Social Disservices, Panopticon's fourth album, is themed around Lunn's criticism of the foster system and social services more generally. The album has a bleak style informed by punk bands; at the same time, it features lengthy, complex compositions (the longest, \\"Patient\\", tops the twenty-minute mark), and it is his first of many releases to feature guest violinist John Becker (sometimes credited as Johan Becker), whose contributions have since become a distinct fixture of Panopticon's sound. According to the liner notes, \\"A portion of the profits from this record go to families in crisis and abuse victims.\\" Kentucky, Panopticon's fifth album, is sometimes regarded as its commercial breakthrough. More of the album than ever before consists of bluegrass music, though the three longer compositions are metal and the song \\"Black Waters\\" is closer to ambient music. The album discusses the labor struggles surrounding coal mining in Kentucky, with substantial samples from the documentary Harlan County, USA. Three songs on the album are covers of old labor standards. Lunn donates a substantial portion of his profits from the album to the charity Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, which stands in opposition to the environmentally destructive mining practice of mountaintop removal. Panopticon's next split releases were with the Washington, D.C.-based band Vestiges and the Maine-based band Falls of Rauros (entitled Brotherhood; Lunn had contributed drums to Falls of Rauros' 2011 release The Light That Dwells in Rotten Wood, recorded when the band did not have a permanent drummer). The Vestiges split incorporated a cover of Suicide Nation, while Brotherhood was inspired by time Lunn had spent in Norway with Falls of Rauros and as a result is more strongly influenced by second-wave black metal than Panopticon's usual fare. Panopticon's sides of both split albums have not had their lyrics released. Roads to the North and Autumn Eternal, Panopticon's sixth and seventh albums, are considered the second and third parts of a trilogy with Kentucky, though their lyrics have not been released. Roads to the North coincided with Lunn's move from Louisville, Kentucky to rural Minnesota, and reviewers have noted a substantial melodic death metal influence on the album. It also incorporates a lengthy three-part suite inspired by progressive rock. Two of the album's eight songs (\\"Norwegian Nights\\" and the first part of \\"The Long Road\\") are entirely acoustic bluegrass compositions. Autumn Eternal incorporates somewhat shorter songs than the band's usual fare, but otherwise continues in a familiar fashion. The Scars of Man on the Once Nameless Wilderness is a two-hour double album with two distinct parts. The first part features metal inspired by Nordic bands like Bathory and Windir (the third song is directed to Windir's Valfar). The second part features mostly acoustic music; though occasional passages with electric guitar appear, the album is mostly bluegrass, folk, and country music with occasional influence from post-rock. While printed lyrics still don't appear in the packaging, there are explanations for the concept behind the album and every song. The album is Lunn's lament for the decline of wilderness and the difficulty of obtaining silence, inspired by the writings of environmentalist Sigurd Olson. Lunn donates some of the proceeds from the album to the Listening Point Foundation, a group dedicated to preserving Olson's legacy.

He began incorporating elements of serialism and musique concrete in the 1950s, and wrote for increasingly larger orchestral forces. Shibata accepted a professorship at Tokyo University of the Arts in 1959, where he remained until 1969, and while there his compositions incorporated aspects of aleatory music. He wrote pieces which used graphic or artistic scoring notations and made use of microtonal sonorities. From 1973 he composed theater works which combined elements of Japanese folk music with European-derived song structures.

He specialised in creating sculptures and graphic art based on the female form. The Moissey Kogan Archive of the European Cultural Foundation, in Bonn, collects and captures the entire work of the artist. Kogan is sometimes confused with Russian painter Moisey Kogan, (1924-2001), who specialized in colorful oil paintings of Russian village life, landscapes, churches etc. Biography =Early life= Moissey Kogan (also known as Moise or Moshe) was born to a Jewish merchant in the town of Orhei. From an early age, he was interested in craftsmanship and acquired his artistic skills auto-didactically. In 1889, he moved to Nagyb√°nya, an artist's colony in Hungary, where he was taught by the painter Simon Holl√≥sy. From 1903, Kogan spent time in the Bavarian city of Munich, where he enrolled at the Munich Academy of Fine Arts, studying under the sculptor, Wilhelm von R√ºmann. =Artistic career= A Selection of medals produced by the artist Moissey Kogan His artistic career began in 1908, when he exhibited for the first time in Paris, at the Salon d'Automne. The following year, he became one of the founding members of the Expressionist group Neue K√ºnstlervereinigung. During this period in Paris, Kogan was supported by the sculptors Rodin and Maillol. His talents were noticed by the art collector and patron Karl Ernst Osthaus, who worked for Kogan in later years, and offered the young artist a teaching position at the Folkwang Museum in Hagen. This situation was short-lived, and Kogan moved back to Munich, and then Paris, At the invitation of Henry van de Velde, he briefly taught at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Weimar. He led a transient life during this period, and lived variously in Switzerland and Berlin as well. In Berlin, he was promoted by the prominent art-historian Max Sauerlandt and in the 1920s, Kogan's art was exhibited alongside artists from the Berlin Secession. Kogan mixed mainly in artistic circles, and maintained relationships with figures such as Kandinsky, Jawlensky and Maillol. He was an active participant in the Salon d'Automme, where he served on the jury and was eventually elected vice-president of the sculptural department in 1925. From 1925 until his death, he varied his time between Paris and the Netherlands, where he had connections with collectors and artisans. In 1933, he ceased travel to Germany on account of the increasingly anti-Semitic atmosphere, indeed some of his works were exhibited at the Entartete Kunst exhibition in Berlin, 1938. From the late 1930s, Kogan began to withdraw from public life. On 11 February 1943, he was deported from Drancy internment camp to Auschwitz concentration camp, where he would die two weeks later. It wasn't until the 1960s that his fate was discovered. =Work= Illustration f√ºr das Buch Jizo. Galerie Flechtheim, Berlin 1922 Kogan began his career working with gems, producing medals, plaques, vases, embroidery and drawings. He subsequently turned to sculpture after his time in Paris and acquaintance with the sculptors Maillol and Rodin. He became interested in the female form and the concept of grace. The majority of his work consists of small sculptures and reliefs in the neoclassical style. At first he worked with terracotta, later moving to gypsum. He very rarely worked with bronze, due to the expense of the material. Kogan did not date his work, and so it isn't possible to ascertain the years of origin today. In the 1920s, Kogan produced numerous wood and lino-cuts as well as etchings. In his drawings, he worked with chalk, coal, and pencils. Despite this versatility, Kogan infuriated the gallery owner and art-dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, who insisted that he worked incredibly slowly, and very rarely finished his commissions on time.Fitschen, 2002 According to the art-historian Gerhart S√∂hn: > The fragile grace of his figures, their sensual and spiritual body language > are of Hellenistic-looking cheerfulness. The inner restlessness that Kogan > has driven around his life has come to rest in his art. The quiet world of > his work is timeless, and yet he maintains himself alongside the great > currents of contemporary sculpture. Kogan's graphic works are also devoted > exclusively to female figures. The visual language is the same as in the > sculptural works. The soft contours and lines of the body determine the > composition of the picture, not infrequently at the expense of anatomical > correctness. Even expressive expressions avoid everything that is > angular.G√∂tte, 2003 Kogan's works are in many museums, including the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, the Lehmbruck Museum in Duisburg, the Kunsthalle Bremen and in the art collection of the Essen Folkwang Museum. He's also in the Moritzburg National Gallery in Halle, in the Hamburg Museum of Arts and Crafts, The Haubrich Collection at the Ludwig Museum in Cologne and the St√§dtische Galerie at Lenbachhaus in Munich. He is also in the collection of MoMA.  Notes  References *bin Gorion, E. (1935) Philo-Lexicon: Handbuch des j√ºdischen Wissens.

Its orbit is retrograde, which is opposite to the direction of most other bodies in the Solar System. It was discovered on 26 November 2014, by astronomers of the Pan-STARRS survey at Haleakala Observatory on the island of Maui, United States. The unusual object is the first example of an asteroid in a 1:‚Äì1 resonance with any of the planets. A study has suggested it may be an interstellar asteroid captured 4.5 billion years ago into an orbit around the Sun.  Nomenclature  The Hawaiian name Ka ªepaoka ªƒÅwela is composed of ka 'the',  ªepa 'tricky' or 'mischievous', referring to its contrary orbit, o 'of', and Ka ªƒÅwela 'Jupiter'.ulukau HAWAIIAN ELECTRONIC LIBRARY The name was created by A Hua He Inoa, a Hawaiian-language program dedicated to naming objects discovered with Pan-STARRS. The A Hua He Inoa program consists of Hawaiian language experts and astronomers at the  ªImiloa Astronomy Center. Their submitted name was approved by the International Astronomical Union on 9 April 2019. Prior to the naming of Ka ªepaoka ªawela, it was given the provisional designation during 16‚Äì31 January 2015, for being the 12,750th object first observed in that period. It was then numbered and added to the minor planet catalog by the Minor Planet Center on 2 March 2018 (), after its orbit became sufficiently determined.  Orbit  Orbital diagram Orbit (side- view) compared to Jupiter Ka ªepaoka ªawela orbits the Sun at a distance of 3.2‚Äì7.1 AU once every 11 years and 8 months (4,256 days; semi-major axis of 5.14 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.38 and an inclination of 163¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. Its period is close to the 11.86-year period of Jupiter. During one Jovian year, Jupiter moves 360¬∞ around the sun whereas Ka ªepaoka ªawela moves 366.3¬∞ in the opposite direction. The eccentricity of its orbit allows it to alternately pass inside and outside of Jupiter's orbit at its closest approaches of 176 million kilometers. Each time it passes near Jupiter its orbital elements, including its period, are slightly altered. Over thousands of years the angle between the position of the asteroid and its perihelion minus the angle between Jupiter and the asteroid's perihelion tends to oscillate around zero with a period of about 660 years and an amplitude of about 125¬∞, although sometimes this difference slips by a whole 360¬∞. The adjunct diagram shows one complete orbit of asteroid Ka ªepaoka ªawela in a frame of reference rotating with Jupiter. The view is from the north looking south onto the Solar System. The dot in the middle is the Sun and the green circle is the orbit of Earth. The black circle shows the size of the orbit of Jupiter but in this frame of reference Jupiter (the red dot) stays almost stationary at the point on the circle directly to the right of the sun. The orbit of this asteroid is shown in blue when it is above the plane of the orbit of Jupiter, and in magenta when it is below the plane of the orbit of Jupiter. The second diagram shows one complete orbit of asteroid Ka ªepaoka ªawela in a frame of reference rotating with Jupiter. The view is from the side looking into the Solar System. The Sun is the yellow disk in the middle. The plane of the orbit of Jupiter is shown in black, but in this frame of reference Jupiter (the red dot) stays at the right end of the black line. The orbit of this asteroid is shown in blue when it is above (north of) the plane of the orbit of Jupiter, and it is shown in magenta when it is below (south of) the plane of the orbit of Jupiter. Perturbations from Jupiter maintain the stability of this orbit over millions of years. Simulations show that it has been in its co-orbital relation with Jupiter for at least a million years and will continue for at least another million years. It is somewhat of a mystery how this asteroid (or comet) got into this orbit, but it is thought that at some time in the distant past it was put into an orbit resembling its present orbit by an interaction with Saturn, and then its orbit was perturbed into the state it is in today. Likewise, in the far future it may eventually get close enough to Saturn to be expelled from its present co- orbital relation with Jupiter. Ka ªepaoka ªawela shows apparent retrograde motion in the sky while it is on the far side of the sun, rather than at opposition with the sun.  Possible interstellar origin  A statistical search for stable orbits by Fathi Namouni and Helena Morais using one million objects with similar orbits to that of Ka ªepaoka ªawela identified 27 that were stable for 4.5 billion years, the lifetime of the Solar System. Using this result they concluded that Ka ªepaoka ªawela has been in its retrograde resonance with Jupiter since the origin of the Solar System instead of it being an object that is only briefly in this orbit that was observed by chance using the Copernican principle. Since its retrograde orbit is in the opposite direction as objects that formed in the early Solar System they posit that Ka ªepaoka ªawela has an interstellar origin. If confirmed, this origin would have implications on current theories such as the detailed timing and mechanics of planet formation, and the delivery of water and organic molecules to Earth. Others suggest that Ka ªepaoka ªawela originated in the Oort cloud or that it acquired a retrograde orbit due to interactions with Planet Nine, and that it is a short term resident of its current resonance. Given the small fraction of object with orbits like Ka ªepaoka ªawela that survive for the life of the Solar System, they find that a primordial population of similar objects must have been an implausible ten times as large as the current asteroid belt if it was an interstellar object captured during the formation of the Solar System. Another potential source of retrograde Jupiter trojans are escaping near-Earth asteroids.

Reza is a magician/illusionist that tours around world with his pre host and backup dancers. He got his passion for magic from a set of metal rings that linked together right in front of his eyes.  Early life  Borchardt claims to have had a \\"vision and dream to make magic for big audiences\\" from a very early age. His interest in magic began at the age of 6, when he first saw a magic show at Hillcrest Elementary School in Brookings. At 7 years old, Borchardt asked for a magic kit for his birthday and put on performances at his school.  Performances  At 15 years old, Borchardt left Brookings for Branson, Missouri, where he performed 18 shows per week for 6 weeks. He has performed more than 100 shows in the town, and was voted Branson's Magician of the Year in 2016. In 2013, Borchardt announced 45 shows at the Mundo Imperial Forum in Acapulco, Mexico, and has been described as \\"the nation's top touring illusionist\\" and \\"one of the fastest rising young stars in the country\\" by the Brookings Register. From April 2014 until August 2015, Borchardt was a member of The Revollusionists, a spinoff show from The Illusionists, and in 2015, the Starlite Theater in Branson announced that Rez's show, Edge of Illusion, would be open from March until September 2016. According to the theater, who Borchardt performed for on his 100th show in Branson, \\"His stage props are the largest in town, and his act is engaging, enthralling and infused with humor and charm ... Edge of Illusion highlights the new age of magic and misdirection with sleek, seamless fun and a fresh take on all things ordinary.\\" In 2018, Borchardt performed on the show Penn & Teller: Fool Us, but failed to fool the hosts. Borchardt tours the United States, redeveloping his show as he does so. Borchardt claims that a lot of what he performs is inspired by music, movies and pop culture.  Other work  Borchardt has done a number of fundraisers for charity. In 2010, Borchardt partnered with the Brookings Red Cross chapter in order to stage a benefit show for the organization, and August 2015 he teamed up with the charitable organization Star of Hope to make Hunger Vanish, in a campaign to provide 640,000 school lunches for Haitian children. In 2013, Borchardt appeared on MTV alongside Never Shout Never. More recently, in 2016 Reza appeared on a 1 hour episode of the popular Japanese TV Show, Sekai No Hatte Madde Itte Q, and in 2017, Borchardt appeared on Duck Dynasty.

The majority of Egyptian New Zealanders are Christians, predominantly Coptic Christianity, which is in contrast to the religious affiliation to Islam of the majority of the population of ethnic Egyptians within modern Egypt. Centuries of a steady continuous rate of conversions of the local indigenous Egyptian population has resulted in modern Egypt's Muslim majority, although the indigenous Christian Church of Egypt has retained a sizeable minority throughout its history, up until today. Christians comprise much of the Egyptian diaspora, both in New Zealand and elsewhere. The majority religion of Egypt before the introduction of Islam from Arabia was Christianity, and prior to introduction of Christianity to Egypt the majority religion was the Ancient Egyptian religion. Some New Zealand citizens and residents declared membership of the Coptic Orthodox Church. Most Egyptian Christians, however, may simply have declared themselves \\"Christian\\" without specifying the Coptic denomination, while other Egyptian Christians may belong to various other denominations, either born into or converted. Emigration Emigration from Egypt was significant in the late 1940s and 1950s, disproportionately so for non-Muslim religious minorities escaping the growing Arab nationalist movement in Egypt which saw the overthrow of the Egyptian monarchy and the subsequent Suez Crisis.Museum of Victoria In total numbers, Egyptian Christians were the largest contingent of emigrants to leave Egypt for other countries, including to New Zealand. Christians were the second largest in terms of proportion to their original community size in Egypt. Egyptian Jews, as a proportion of their original community size in Egypt, were the largest emigrant community to leave Egypt (they were the second largest in total numbers). The number of Jews in Egypt numbered around 75,000 in 1948, and following the establishment of the State of Israel that same year, almost the entire population left in the subsequent years during the Jewish exodus from Arab lands, settling largely in Israel, United States, Europe, Latin America, as well as Australia and New Zealand. Officially, only 6 Jews remain in Egypt today.

The accident killed five pedestrians and injured six more. The bus, a 2001 Volvo B7TL double- decker operated by Lincolnshire RoadCar, was operating a scheduled passenger service between Skegness and Chapel St Leonards when the driver, 50-year-old Stephen Topasna, lost control of the vehicle on Sea Lane in Ingoldmells. The bus veered onto the pavement, striking a number of pedestrians, before swerving back into the road coming to a stop after colliding with a BMW car just beyond a pelican crossing, where it had struck another group of pedestrians. With five fatalities, the Ingoldmells bus crash was the worst accident involving a bus in the United Kingdom since the M40 minibus crash in 1993. The accident remained the deadliest bus accident in the United Kingdom during the 21st century until it was surpassed by the 2017 M1 motorway crash involving a minibus. Background The bus involved in the accident was a three-year-old Volvo B7TL double-decker with East Lancs Vyking bodywork, operated by Lincolnshire RoadCar. The bus was registered Y903 OTL and carried fleet number 903 with Lincolnshire RoadCar. Following the crash, the bus was repaired and re-entered service, re-registered to Y926 OJL and given new fleet number 900 to hide its identity. Following Stagecoach's acquisition of Lincolnshire RoadCar in 2005, the bus gained fleet number 16900 in the Stagecoach national fleet, remaining in service with Stagecoach in Lincolnshire at their Scunthorpe depot until 2014, when it was withdrawn and scrapped due to damage from another road traffic accident earlier that year. At the time of the accident, the bus was operating on route 1 from Skegness to Chapel St Leonards, via Ingoldmells. Accident Fantasy Island amusement park in Ingoldmells, close to the site of the accident The bus was being driven along Sea Lane in Ingoldmells, close to the Fantasy Island amusement park, at the time of the accident. Immediately prior to the accident, driver Stephen Topasna pulled the bus into a bus stop in a lay-by by the side of the road in order to pick up passengers. The accident occurred as Topasna accelerated the bus away from the lay-by; due to pedal confusion, Topasna unintentionally caused the bus to accelerate instead of brake after pulling back into the road, leading to a loss of control. The bus continued to accelerate for 22 seconds after pulling away from the bus stop, reaching a top speed of 41 mph before losing control and mounting the pavement. Passengers on board reported hearing the driver shouting that the bus had no brakes. After losing control, the bus struck a number of pedestrians on the pavement, before veering back into the road. The bus then struck a BMW car in the road, before failing to stop in time for a pelican crossing, striking a group of pedestrians on the crossing before finally coming to a halt 176 metres after setting off. The accident occurred on the busiest day of the year for the amusement park, and the area was busy with pedestrians. In total, the accident killed five pedestrians and injured six more, including two critically. Two people remained trapped underneath the bus for around half an hour after it came to a halt. Three people were pronounced dead immediately at the site of the accident; a fourth died several hours later, while a fifth pedestrian died the following day in hospital. Aftermath The pedestrians who were killed in the accident were later named as 37-year-old Joanne Warren and her two sons, 5-year-old Jacob Warren and 4-month-old Leyton Warren, all from Leicester; and husband and wife 33-year-old Richard Rhodes and 30-year-old Paula Rhodes from Mansfield, Nottinghamshire. Inquests into the accident were opened on 19 April. Following the accident, the section of Sea Lane on which the accident took place was pedestrianised, following numerous protests and a petition signed by 5,000 people. However, the pedestrianisation of Sea Lane was later criticised for splitting Ingoldmells in half, causing further traffic problems, which resulted in Sea Lane being reopened to traffic again, but with safety measures in place, such as a 20mph Zone, Speed Bumps, Crash Barriers and new pedestrian crossings. http://islandquest.co.uk/news.php?mode=view&id;=1 A memorial stone to the victims of the accident was unveiled on 25 June 2004. =Charges against Lincolnshire RoadCar= Bus company Lincolnshire RoadCar appeared in court in connection with the accident in February 2005, potentially facing a charge of operating a vehicle with defective brakes, which the company denied. On 8 August, Lincolnshire RoadCar were found guilty of breaching safety provisions for allowing the driver to operate the vehicle type without proper training and for operating a vehicle with faulty brakes; they were fined ¬£2,000 at Skegness Magistrates Court. The bus had been serviced two days prior to the accident, and an engineer spotted and rectified three faults with the braking system; however, they failed to rectify a fault with the brake slack adjuster. However, it was also confirmed that the faulty brakes had not caused the accident and would have had only a minor effect on the outcome of the accident. Lincolnshire RoadCar initially planned to appeal the verdict. However, the appeal was dropped in October 2005. =Charges = Topasna was later charged with five counts of causing death by dangerous driving and one count of driving without due care and attention. Topasna admitted the charges upon appearance at Lincoln Crown Court on 18 October 2005, stating that he had mistakenly pressed the accelerator instead of the brake in a case of pedal confusion. On 9 November, Topasna was sentenced to five years in prison in connection with the accident.

He played a prominent role in the government of the Principality of Mingrelia, which became an autonomous subject of the Russian Empire in 1804. Dadiani's principal historical work is The History of the Georgians, whose final chapters are an indispensable source for the early modern history of western Georgia. Nikoloz Dadiani, his name hypocorized to Niko, was named didi, Georgian for \\"big\\", to distinguish him from his younger namesakes in the Dadiani family.  Political career  Nikoloz Dadiani was a son of Giorgi Dadiani (died 1799), brother of Katsia II Dadiani, Prince of Mingrelia. His involvement in the politics and government of Mingrelia began in October 1804, when he became a member of the regency council for his underage relative, Levan V Dadiani, a grandson of Katsia II. The council was presided by Levan's mother, the dowager-princess Nino. A few months earlier, Mingrelia had become part of the Russian Empire as an autonomous principality. In 1805, Didi-Niko Dadini led a Mingrelian delegation to St. Petersburg sent to address the principality's territorial grievances with its neighbors. On his return, Dadiani found himself at odds with the dowager-princess, whom he accused of using the regency council to appease her own ambitions. After Levan V Dadiani became of age and Nino was sidelined from Mingrelia's government in 1811, Didi-Niko Dadiani's influence grew. The prince-regnant Levan had little interest in government affairs and day-to-day administrative routine and relied on Didi-Niko, who served as a chancellor (mdivanbegi) for years and, between 1804 and 1811, composed a new government code, known as dasturlama, to improve Mingrelia's governance. Didi-Niko Dadiani was a loyal subject to the Russian crown. As part of the Mingrelian forces (\\"militia\\"), he fought on the Russian side in the Russo-Turkish War (1806‚Äì1812), Russo-Persian War (1804‚Äì13), and Russo-Turkish War (1828‚Äì1829). He, further, aided the Russians in suppressing the western Georgian rebellions of 1810 and 1819‚Äì1820. He was made major-general and awarded the Order of St. Anna, First Class.  A historian  During his years in government, Dadiani wrote his major historical work, The History of the Georgians (·É•·Éê·É†·Éó·Éï·Éî·Éö·Éó ·É™·ÉÆ·Éù·Éï·É†·Éî·Éë·Éê, k'art'velt' ts'khovreba), which he completed in 1823. It is composed of three parts; the first two segments are based, respectively, on the medieval compendium, kartlis tskhovreba, and the history by Prince Vakhushti. The final part is an original work, dealing mostly with the history of western Georgia between 1749 and 1823 and containing many valuable, otherwise unrecorded details. He also wrote a travelogue of his mission to Russia, which has not survived. Dadiani died in 1834 and was buried at the Martvili Monastery. He was married twice; first, to Mariam n√©e Eristavi of Guria and, then, after her death in 1802, Ekaterine Marshania from Abkhazia. He had seven children‚Äîtwo daughters and five sons. His descendants are still extant.

The background depicts the September 14, 1782 review of Continental Army troops Washington staged there as an honor for the departing French commander Comte de Rochambeau and his army. The painting was a gift from Trumbull to the president's wife, Martha Washington, and is now owned by the Winterthur Museum. Trumbull next received a commission from the City of New York and painted a much larger version, George Washington, with a new background, Evacuation Day of New York City, November 25, 1783, the return of Washington and the departure of British forces. It is on display in the Governor's Room of New York City Hall. Description General George Washington is in full military uniform, a blue coat over buff waistcoat and pants. He is standing in front of his white horse, Blueskin, leaning on the saddle and holding the reins. Seen through the legs of the horse is a romanticized depiction of Washington's September 14, 1782 display of his Continental Army troops in honor of the Comte de Rochambeau, commander in chief of the French Expeditionary Force which had marched with him earlier to Yorktown, Virginia and, with the support of a French fleet lying offshore, helped force the October 19, 1781 surrender of British general Cornwallis and bring about a peace. Upon Rochambeau's return north almost a full year later, Washington staged a formal review of his troops at their encampment Verplanck's Point on the North River (today's Hudson) by the Comte. It was an honor due \\"his Excellency\\" both for his aid during the war and generosity in distributing to the Continental force arms, equipment, and clothing provided by France and captured by them from the British at Yorktown, as well as a thanks to the nation of France for its military assistance in winning the Colonies their freedom. Stony Point and the Hudson Highlands are also visible on the horizon. History The painting was a gift to Martha Washington by Trumbull. After her death, the portrait was bequeathed to her granddaughter, Elizabeth Parke Custis Law. It remained in the family until sold to Henry Francis du Pont, who then donated it to his museum in 1964. In 1982, the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association purchased a modern copy of the painting by Adrian Lamb for display at Mount Vernon. Critical reception Martha Washington's grandson, George Washington Parke Custis, wrote in his Recollections and private memoirs of Washington that: Legacy In 1889, for the centennial celebration of the inauguration of Washington as the first President of the United States, the original portrait, then owned by Edmund Law Rogers, grandson of Elizabeth Parke Custis Law, and the second, the city hall version, were on display together at the Metropolitan Opera House, New York City. In 1982, a silver coin with a 30 dollar value was issued for Antigua & Barbuda commemorating the 250th anniversary of Washington's birth with this image of him at Verplanck's Point on the reverse side. In 2017, Philip Mead, chief historian at the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia, and museum curators found that a watercolor panorama by Pierre Charles L'Enfant was of this 1782 encampment at Verplanck's Point and included Washington's canvas marquee tent. R. Scott Stephenson, director of curatorial affairs at the museum, has stated that although the tent is not seen in Trumbull's painting, \\"because of this new watercolor and the research we've done, we can tell it shows Washington standing right in front of the tent.\\" George Washington George Washington by John Trumbull, 1790, New York City Hall In July, 1790, Trumbull received a commission from the corporation for the City of New York, led by Mayor Richard Varick, to paint the president's portrait. The result, George Washington, was a scaling-up of Washington at Verplanck's Point to nearly four times its size. Also known as Washington and the Departure of the British Garrison from New York City, it is a ( x ) full-length portrait in oil, generally similar in composition and character to its source but for its backdrop, which has been switched from Rochambeau's September 1782 review of the Continental Army to Evacuation Day, Washington's return to New York City upon the British forces' November 25, 1783 departure. This painting is located in the historic Governor's Room of New York City Hall.

Voters chose four representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. New Hampshire voted for Republican nominee, Senator Warren G. Harding of Ohio, over the Democratic nominee, Governor James M. Cox of Ohio. Harding ran with Governor Calvin Coolidge of Massachusetts, while Cox ran with Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt of New York. Harding won New Hampshire by a margin of 20.45%. His victory in the New England states was helped by the local popularity of his running mate, Calvin Coolidge, a traditional New England Yankee born in the small-town of Plymouth Notch in neighboring Vermont, who had started his political career in neighboring Massachusetts as its governor. Despite this, New Hampshire would be Cox's second-strongest antebellum free state (after Indiana) by popular vote percentage and third-strongest (after Indiana and Cox's Ohio) in terms of percentage margin. Overall the Granite State voted by a two-party margin of 5.72% more Democratic than the nation at-large ‚Äì which is the most Democratic relative thereto New Hampshire has ever voted since the Republican Party was founded.Counting the Votes; New Hampshire Although Cox carried no counties, Hillsborough and longtime national bellwether Co√∂s would prove his strongest counties in New England.
